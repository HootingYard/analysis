  text: 'Attaching clamps to the slats with quarter-inch gulliver bolts, I smeared
    the lattice-work with a decoction of binding-agents and threaded the netting through
    the tin clips, allowing me to dislodge the hasp on the paddle in order to provide
    enough purchase on the metal flanges which were arranged in rotation beside the
    colour-coded pails, the white one being strapped to a clogged bracket, the red
    one spinning on the torque engine, the blue one held in place by rubber frets,
    and the black one chiming against the aluminium knob on the wicket, which had
    been fastened to the anchorage unit by a system of winches controlled by a clay
    handle on the bole, against which pellets were fired at pre-arranged intervals
    by the steam gun just below the fourth set of nozzles, cleverly positioned at
    such a distance from the first three sets to provide a constant stream of gases
    to pass over the tarpaulin, in which punctures had been made to allow ease of
    passage for the andiron tubes carrying ballbearings to the spandrel and thus on
    to the rotating wooden platform, upon which the greased hinges chafed against
    the pulleys sufficiently for the sparks to ignite sulphur bombs inside the bakelite
    carriage, without endangering the pads, bulbs and chocks on the hooter, at the
    sounding of which the intricately-wired snares would snap shut and entrap the
    oiled plasticine clumps, thus momentarily halting the recurrent biting movements
    of the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of todge into the motor around which
    I had placed canvas bags packed with candles in order to steady the persistent
    rattling of the ticker on the back of the iron sledge underneath the trolley carrying
    the double battery-powered hammer which served to agitate the drum containing
    the four-inch blades detached from the rusted bowl of the compass, held in place
    on the rocket by a monstrous titanium screw wedged against the plackets of the
    grit distributor I had earlier customised by locking its gut probes into position
    with no less than twenty six separate multiple-gate plugs, on each of which a
    scorched zinc disc swivelled in response to the magnetic properties of the special
    basin receiving the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling out of the glass
    globe tethered to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate by chains which
    ran parallel to the lengths of string tied at one end to the pirate''s aureole
    and at the other to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags I had stolen
    from the same warehouse which provided the hooks for the plank balanced uneasily
    across the gap between the pinboard and the hodometer fitted with small beeswax
    parcels lashed to the crane from which dangled several springs and coils loaded
    with lead weights and enamelled cubes the purpose of which became apparent when
    the gleaming cork was plunged into the canister of boiling duckpond water kept
    at constant temperature by hastily-repaired piping fed by siphons and buttressed
    by giant prongs from the surfaces of which had been expunged precisely engraved
    instructions for the use of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the
    derrick next to the pumps on the tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange
    taffeta swaddling material as a sop to the git who provided the jars, flakes and
    asbestos-free wing cranks I required for timing the bleaching operation on the
    plastic squirting mechanism moulded out of discarded beetle caps salvaged from
    a manufacturer of resins whose grotesque sponge hood had been incorporated into
    the workings of the shiny magnesium tripod atop which lurked a uranium pill squashed
    underneath a varnished Icelandic pan containing phosphorus hoops and a glamorous
    leather trumpet pitched towards a cobalt beaker lit up by the Mackenzie Beam angled
    obliquely next to a yellow fustian canopy covering a massive trellis to which
    were glued an up-ended cone veiled by cotton-wool wrapped around a toy horse with
    a propellor caked in mercury powering the fulcrum and bails on the fractured tub
    countersunk behind the crust of a feather on a stool with pins affixed to the
    leaching grille placed askew atop the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Incredible
    as it may seem, I had stitched the flap to the basket with insufficiently strong
    cord, and it now became dangerously loose.
