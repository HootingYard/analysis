  text: 'Here are some unbearably exciting stories by Frank Key:

    Gigantic Bolivian Architectural Diagrams

    Mr Bewg''s Reference

    By Aerostat to Hooting Yard

    Some Ponds, A Hotel, The Hollyhocks

    About Belt, Bong & Yaw

    Sidney The Bat Is Awarded The Order Of Lenin (a Stalinist children''s story)

    Not a story as such, just a very long sentence from The Crunlop Experiment. I
    think it works on its own terms, even out of context.
