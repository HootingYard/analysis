  text: "Dear Mr Corncrake\nRe: Mr B Bewg, 164 Dismal Terrace, Hoon\nThank you for\
    \ your letter of 14 July regarding the above-named. I am happy to provide him\
    \ with a reference.\nI have known Mr Bewg for ten years, ever since he took up\
    \ the position of scrivener, dogsbody and wretch in my vast gloomy factory perched\
    \ on the hillside next to the lunatic asylum. At the time I engaged Mr Bewg I\
    \ suspected that he had some past connection with the latter institution, and\
    \ in the decade since I have had no reason to revise my opinion.\nYou ask me to\
    \ comment on my impression of Mr Bewg's \"suitability for the job\". Forgive me\
    \ if I find this difficult. I do not wish to do violence to our mother tongue,\
    \ but to use the word \"suitability\" in conjunction with Mr Bewg is to mock the\
    \ Queen's English. Indeed, it is to make a mockery of Sense itself.\nMy problems\
    \ with Mr Bewg began on his very first morning in my employ. To settle him in,\
    \ I had instructed him to carry out a menial task, removing bits of goo from the\
    \ interior walls of a vat. To facilitate his progress, he was supplied with a\
    \ variety of tools including a pencil sharpener, a pin-cushion, and a decidedly\
    \ ferocious blowtorch. No sooner had I turned my back than Mr Bewg became embroiled\
    \ in a tussle with my pet panther, which--crazed with hunger--managed to slip\
    \ its leash and embed its razor-sharp fangs in his left leg. For this impertinence\
    \ I had no option but to dock Mr Bewg his first month's wages.\nIt was not a good\
    \ start, but I had had many a ne'er-do-well working for me in the past, and believed\
    \ that I could yet mould Mr Bewg into a marginally less repellent specimen of\
    \ human dregs. To this end, I assigned him to work in the filthiest, dankest wing\
    \ of the factory, where he was expected to spend all day dragging sacks full of\
    \ huge iron lumps backwards and forwards through infested tunnels for no apparent\
    \ purpose. So ineptly did Mr Bewg execute his duties that I was forced to withhold\
    \ his pay for a further year. I wrung my hands with frustration, but the man was\
    \ impossible. Given a simple task, he was utterly incapable of completing it with\
    \ the requisite speed, good humour and fawning obeisance that one expects.\nTo\
    \ give just one example: Mr Bewg failed to budge one particularly heavy sack (containing\
    \ a score of medium-sized anvils) a single inch, despite being given all of four\
    \ and a half minutes to drag it eight hundred yards along a stinking tunnel in\
    \ which small bonfires of sulphur had been ignited only moments before. I set\
    \ a wolfhound yapping at his heels, but to no avail. The man was purely and simply\
    \ workshy. But I am a fair man, and I had no wish to consign him irrevocably into\
    \ the underclass of the unemployed and unemployable.\nInstead, I agreed with Mr\
    \ Bewg that he could embark upon a training scheme. In return for a modest fee\
    \ to be paid to me daily, in cash, I offered to provide him with a comprehensive\
    \ course of training in a multiplicity of disciplines, both within the factory\
    \ and in the adjoining administrative hellhole. In the first week alone, we covered\
    \ a huge range of skills: licking my boots till they gleamed, prostrating himself\
    \ on his stomach whenever I came within two hundred yards of him, and slobbering\
    \ with happiness at the mere mention of my name.\nAt this stage in what can only\
    \ roughly be called his \"career\", Mr Bewg crawled into my palatial office one\
    \ day to request my assistance with a personal matter. Tempted though I was to\
    \ have him savaged by giant badgers, I reclined in my unbelievably comfortable\
    \ executive armchair and heard him out. He confessed that he was in some financial\
    \ difficulties and begged me to help. Sipping my glass of ruinously expensive\
    \ wine, I delivered a stern lecture on the virtues of thrift and idly beat him\
    \ about the skull with a copy of Self-Help. I admitted that I was in a position\
    \ to pay his paltry debts a billionfold if I wished to, but that such a course\
    \ of action would not in the long run be of the slightest benefit to him. I then\
    \ advised him that he could earn a few extra pounds by selling various of his\
    \ bodily organs and thus better his financial situation while basking in the knowledge\
    \ that he was being self-reliant rather than coming cap-in-hand to his employer.\
    \ To prove my point, I offered to buy one of his kidneys and two pints of his\
    \ blood on the spot, for which I would pay him fourpence. As the bulk of his debts\
    \ were monies owed to me, I generously docked the fourpence from his account.\
    \ In this way, I was able to relieve him of the responsibility of handling any\
    \ cash himself, and thereby falling prey to the inevitable temptation to fritter\
    \ the money away on food, clothing, and medicine. Only after this transaction\
    \ had taken place did I set the giant badgers onto him.\nNot long after this incident,\
    \ Mr Bewg announced that he had found himself another job, and wished to terminate\
    \ his contract of employment. If his inane burbling was to be believed, he had\
    \ been offered the post of Assistant Slave at a charnel-house, the main duties\
    \ being to crawl on his hands and knees in foul pits of ordure. While I listened\
    \ patiently, he explained that he felt this post would give him opportunities\
    \ undreamed of in his current position, and that he was prepared to take a cut\
    \ in salary in order to take up the offer. Poking at him with a stick, I nodded\
    \ my consent. I had no wish to stand in his way. My only concern was that he would\
    \ have the common decency to fulfil the terms and conditions of his contract before\
    \ setting off for greener pastures. I then reminded him of the form he had signed\
    \ on his first day at the factory, the main clauses of which stated that in order\
    \ to leave, he was required to give forty years notice and to repay every single\
    \ penny of his salary since day one. To my surprise, Mr Bewg--who moments before\
    \ had been adamant that he wanted to leave--now said that he would like a few\
    \ more days to consider the matter. Once again I nodded my assent, then summoned\
    \ fourteen of my assistants, who bundled Mr Bewg out of my office and set him\
    \ to work on his latest task, which was to lie face down in a muddy ditch while\
    \ a herd of demented bison charged over him.\nIn view of the above, I must admit\
    \ that I cannot in truth recommend Mr Bewg to you. His work is shoddy, his attendance\
    \ and punctuality leave much to be desired, and I have the gravest doubts about\
    \ his character. His sickness record is thoroughly unsatisfactory, and I have\
    \ been put in the uncomfortable position of having to threaten various members\
    \ of the medical profession with monstrous violence after they had the temerity\
    \ to issue Mr Bewg with certificates recommending that he stay off work for half\
    \ an hour. However, should you decide to ignore my warnings and offer a job to\
    \ Mr Bewg, I will have great pleasure in delivering what is left of him to your\
    \ premises upon the expiry of his notice period in forty years time.\nYours sincerely\n\
    \  B. Git\nBack to stories"
