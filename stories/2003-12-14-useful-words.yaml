  text: "Vigilant readers of the Hooting Yard Search Engine Lure will note within\
    \ it the splendid word \u201Cbewolfenbuddlement\u201D. Like \u201Csolipsism\u201D\
    , this is a coinage by Horace Walpole, but sadly one which never caught on. When\
    \ the future George III was a teenager, his grandfather tried to marry him off\
    \ to a European princess, much to the dismay of George's mother. The name of the\
    \ princess was Sophia Caroline Maria, daughter of the Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenb\xFC\
    ttel. Under his mother's influence, George became fretful and aghast at the proposal,\
    \ and\u2014as Walpole wrote\u2014he \u201Cdeclares violently against being bewolfenbuttled\u201D\
    . To resurrect the word successfully, perhaps it is necessary to widen it from\
    \ the sense of being forced into an arranged marriage to being forced into anything\
    \ one doesn't want to do. Start using it today!"
