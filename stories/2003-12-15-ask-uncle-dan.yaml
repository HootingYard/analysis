  text: "Dear Uncle Dan\nI read in an old encyclopaedia that Charles Brockden Brown\
    \ (1771-1810), author of Arthur Mervyn: or Memoirs of the Year 1793, Alcuin: A\
    \ Dialogue, Wieland: or The Transformation, Edgar Huntly: or Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker,\
    \ Ormond: Or, The Secret Witness, Clara Howard, Somnambulism and other stories,\
    \ Carwin: The Biloquist And Other American Tales And Pieces, An Address To The\
    \ Government Of The United States On The Cession Of Louisiana, An Address To The\
    \ Congress Of The United States On The British Treaty, and A Prospectus of a System\
    \ of General Geography, was a frail, studious child, reputed a prodigy, and encouraged\
    \ by his parents in that frantic feeding upon books which was expected, in those\
    \ days, of every American boy of parts. What I want to know is, how can I become\
    \ a \u201Cboy of parts\u201D?\nYours sincerely,\nHorst\nPS\u2014I am not American.\
    \ I was born in Sumatra and now live in Belgium.\nUncle Dan says:\nWhat you need,\
    \ my boy, is vim. Vim is the trade name of a range of household cleaning products.\
    \ Indeed, a scouring powder called Vim was one of the first products created by\
    \ William Lever, the soapmaking tycoon whose family firm merged with a Dutch margarine\
    \ manufacturer in 1930 to create that modern titan Unilever. As I am sure you\
    \ know, Horst, Unilever owns Dove, Lipton, Ragu, Calve, Hellmans, Knorr, Domestos,\
    \ Cif, Axe, Rexona, Calvin Klein, Cerrutti, Valentino perfumes, Bird's Eye, Domestos,\
    \ Impulse, Vaseline, Ponds\u2014that's right, Horst, Ponds!\u2014Signal, Comfort,\
    \ Slimfast, Magnum, Solero, Findus, and Ben & Jerry's. But I digress. We are talking\
    \ about soap. Perhaps, young man, you are not of a technical bent? There are enticing\
    \ opportunities in the soapmaking world for artistic temperaments too! You could,\
    \ for example, design soap labels such as the one shown below.\n\nBefore modern\
    \ soap, of course, people often used lye, which is still used today when preparing\
    \ the Swedish delicacy known as Lutefisk, which is basically codfish jellied in\
    \ lye. So, my lad, I'll wager that if you eat a big bowl of that every day you\
    \ will indeed become a boy of parts.\nUncle Dan recommends wikipedia."
