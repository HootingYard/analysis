  text: "I know, I know\u2026. this is not really the place to come to read about\
    \ the doings of celebrities. Thereagain, that's just what makes Hooting Yard so\
    \ different, so appealing. In any case, this isn't exactly news, just something\
    \ I feel ought never to be forgotten.\nQUESTION : Has Tara Palmer-Tomkinson ever\
    \ done anything to justify her existence?\nANSWER : Oddly enough, the answer is\
    \ a resounding \u201CYes!\u201D. The French writer Raymond Roussel once claimed\
    \ that, in time, his fame would eclipse that of Napoleon Bonaparte: and who knows,\
    \ he may yet be proved right. I venture to suggest that Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's\
    \ name will likewise ring down the centuries, yea, e'en unto the time when, as\
    \ Carl Sagan so memorably put it, \u201Cthe earth is a charred cinder, and the\
    \ sun\u2026 dead\u201D. Why should this be so? Recall the first series of that\
    \ wretched television programme I'm A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! There\
    \ is one superb moment when Tara and the log-obsessed Tony Blackburn are clearing\
    \ up the camp. The other participants\u2014including Uri Geller\u2014have left.\
    \ Tara stoops to pick something up. She looks at it, whatever it is, distastefully.\
    \ Then, handing her find to Tony, she pronounces the immortal words: \u201CThese\
    \ are Uri's underpants. Burn them\u201D."
