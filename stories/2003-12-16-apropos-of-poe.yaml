  text: 'William Fearing Gill''s book Edgar Allan Poe--After Fifty Years begins with
    a supremely bad-tempered paragraph:

    "When Rufus W. Griswold, "the pedagogue vampire," as he was aptly termed by one
    of his contemporaries, committed the immortal infamy of blighting a collection
    of Edgar Allan Poe''s works, which he found ready at hand, by supplementing his
    perfunctory labors with a calumniating memoir of the poet, nearly fifty years
    ago, there were many protests uttered by the poet''s contemporaries at home and
    abroad. Charles Baudelaire, the Poe of French literature, in his tribute to the
    dead poet, indignantly wrote: "What is the matter with America? Are there, then,
    no regulations there to keep the curs out of the cemeteries?" In view of the fact
    that the Griswold biography of Poe has been incontestably discredited, and proved
    to be merely a scaffolding of malevolent falsehoods--the outcome of malice and
    mendacity--the deference paid to Griswold and his baleful work in the memoir accompanying
    the latest publication of Poe''s writings seems well-nigh incomprehensible."'
