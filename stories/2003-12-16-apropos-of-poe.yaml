  text: "William Fearing Gill's book Edgar Allan Poe\u2014After Fifty Years begins\
    \ with a supremely bad-tempered paragraph:\n\u201CWhen Rufus W. Griswold, \u201D\
    the pedagogue vampire,\u201C as he was aptly termed by one of his contemporaries,\
    \ committed the immortal infamy of blighting a collection of Edgar Allan Poe's\
    \ works, which he found ready at hand, by supplementing his perfunctory labors\
    \ with a calumniating memoir of the poet, nearly fifty years ago, there were many\
    \ protests uttered by the poet's contemporaries at home and abroad. Charles Baudelaire,\
    \ the Poe of French literature, in his tribute to the dead poet, indignantly wrote:\
    \ \u201DWhat is the matter with America? Are there, then, no regulations there\
    \ to keep the curs out of the cemeteries?\u201C In view of the fact that the Griswold\
    \ biography of Poe has been incontestably discredited, and proved to be merely\
    \ a scaffolding of malevolent falsehoods\u2014the outcome of malice and mendacity\u2014\
    the deference paid to Griswold and his baleful work in the memoir accompanying\
    \ the latest publication of Poe's writings seems well-nigh incomprehensible.\u201D"
