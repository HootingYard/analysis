  text: 'Go immediately to the ReR Megacorp and buy this album:


    Here are some of the credits:

    Lukas Simonis--guitars & mandolin. Bob Drake--bass & guitars. Chris Cutler--drums
    & electrified kit. Frank Key--liner notes & illustrations, naming of album & track
    titles.

    You can see a larger version of the cover here, read some of the liner notes (among
    other things) here, or for your general edification and delight visit Chris and
    Bob. Incidentally, Bob has a magnificent online art tutorial which is highly recommended.

    Here is the Amazon.com editorial review :

    "Vril is an adrenalized, poppy, rampant batch of rock guitar instrumentals. The
    Shadows, The Ventures, Surf music, early Hendrix are invoked, but they''re all
    put through the intense mangle of 21st century thinking and studio trickery. It''s
    a twangy guitar album gone mad, complete with a fascinating art-and-texts booklet
    which reads like a liner notes by Edgar Allen Poe. The album features three unlikely
    avant-garde musicians: Dutch guitarist Lukas Simonis, bass player/mastering wiz
    Bob Drake and famed percussionist Chris Cutler."

    Breathless prose, eh? Flattering though it may be to be compared to the great
    neurasthenic one, I''m not sure I see the connection.* And couldn''t they have
    spelled Allan correctly?

    * NOTE : Bob Drake writes (17th December 2003) : "It is true. Have you not read
    any of Edgar Allen Poe''s work? (Not to be confused with Edgar Allan Poe.) He
    mentions stolen paint, calcium, unguents, poultices, swollen diagrams, purposeless
    turnips, cilliated plumula, and cormorants in every one of his works." To enrich
    your experience of Bob''s informative letter, I have added those links so you
    can see what he''s talking about. But beware! Following any of them will lead
    you away from Hooting Yard--possibly pursued by big fearsome owls--so do make
    sure you come back


    You know, Virginia Woolf was right!'
