  text: "Go immediately to the ReR Megacorp and buy this album:\n\nHere are some of\
    \ the credits:\nLukas Simonis\u2014guitars & mandolin. Bob Drake\u2014bass & guitars.\
    \ Chris Cutler\u2014drums & electrified kit. Frank Key\u2014liner notes & illustrations,\
    \ naming of album & track titles.\nYou can see a larger version of the cover here,\
    \ read some of the liner notes (among other things) here, or for your general\
    \ edification and delight visit Chris and Bob. Incidentally, Bob has a magnificent\
    \ online art tutorial which is highly recommended.\nHere is the Amazon.com editorial\
    \ review :\n\u201CVril is an adrenalized, poppy, rampant batch of rock guitar\
    \ instrumentals. The Shadows, The Ventures, Surf music, early Hendrix are invoked,\
    \ but they're all put through the intense mangle of 21st century thinking and\
    \ studio trickery. It's a twangy guitar album gone mad, complete with a fascinating\
    \ art-and-texts booklet which reads like a liner notes by Edgar Allen Poe. The\
    \ album features three unlikely avant-garde musicians: Dutch guitarist Lukas Simonis,\
    \ bass player/mastering wiz Bob Drake and famed percussionist Chris Cutler.\u201D\
    \nBreathless prose, eh? Flattering though it may be to be compared to the great\
    \ neurasthenic one, I'm not sure I see the connection.* And couldn't they have\
    \ spelled Allan correctly?\n* NOTE : Bob Drake writes (17th December 2003) : \u201C\
    It is true. Have you not read any of Edgar Allen Poe's work? (Not to be confused\
    \ with Edgar Allan Poe.) He mentions stolen paint, calcium, unguents, poultices,\
    \ swollen diagrams, purposeless turnips, cilliated plumula, and cormorants in\
    \ every one of his works.\u201D To enrich your experience of Bob's informative\
    \ letter, I have added those links so you can see what he's talking about. But\
    \ beware! Following any of them will lead you away from Hooting Yard\u2014possibly\
    \ pursued by big fearsome owls\u2014so do make sure you come back\n\nYou know,\
    \ Virginia Woolf was right!"
