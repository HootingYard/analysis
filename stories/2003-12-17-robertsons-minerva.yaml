  text: To hell with the Wright Brothers, or Percy Pilcher, or any of those other
    aviation pioneers being celebrated this week. The man for me is Robertson. In
    1804 he published in Vienna a plan for La Minerva, an aerial vessel destined for
    discoveries, and proposed to all the Academies of Europe, by Robertson, physicist.
    The Minerva would have a balloon of 150 feet in diameter, made of unbleached silk,
    coated within and without with india-rubber. For some reason it was imperative
    that the balloon be manufactured in Lyons. Atop the balloon would gleam a weathercock,
    "the symbol of watchfulness", and at the sides would be two purely ornamental
    wings. Suspended from the balloon would be a ship, containing a small boat ("in
    which the passengers might take refuge in case of necessity, in the event of the
    larger vessel falling on the sea in a disabled state"); a store for water, wine
    and other provisions; silk ladders; closets; the pilot's room; an observatory
    containing compasses "and other [unspecified] scientific instruments"; a room
    "fitted up for recreations, walking, and gymnastics"; a kitchen, medicine room,
    theatre and music room; a study; and lastly, tents for the "air-marines". Tragically,
    the Minerva was never built.
