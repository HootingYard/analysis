  text: "Mention of an \"intense mangle\" in the Amazon.com review (see below, 16th\
    \ December) reminded me of a similarly infelicitous phrase I came upon recently.\
    \ When George W Bush made his state visit to Britain, The Guardian invited the\
    \ usual suspects to write open letters to him for a special edition of the G2\
    \ supplement. The so-called \"Poet Laureate\" Andrew Motion contributed a poem,\
    \ the first stanza of which is:\n\n  The child who has lost his arms\n  thought\
    \ he was catching a ball\n  when the bomb his enemies dropped\n  bounced through\
    \ his dapper hall.\nThis titanic piece of versifying repays considerable attention.\
    \ Just one point to ponder--in the fourth line, why is the boy's hall \"dapper\"\
    ? Is he in the hall because it rhymes with ball? Have you ever visited someone's\
    \ house and, looking around admiringly, announced, \"My, isn't this dapper?\"\
    \ No, you have not. Nor has anyone else. Ever."
