  text: 'Captain Flask, of the HMS Corrugated Cardboard, was a bad and dangerous man.
    He never washed his hair, and he was fond of tormenting badgers. His ship was
    falling apart, because whenever any of his miserable crew tried to repair something,
    like the rigging, or a fo''c''sle, or even the whole orlop deck, he would fly
    into a rage like something out of the Old Testament, and the crew would be cowed,
    and go back below decks to their scrimshaw and grog.

    Every day, all day, and every night, all night, Captain Flask lurched around the
    deck, shouting at the sky. In the pocket of his weskit, where his fob watch ought
    to have been, he kept a supply of tin baubles, and he would throw these at any
    birds that came within his range, particularly guillemots, which he loathed, and
    cormorants, which he did not understand, but his aim was not good, and he usually
    missed.One of his arms was withered from scrofula.

    His fob watch lay, abandoned, in the untidy drawer of his escritoire, hidden among
    old pencils, bits of calico, drawing pins, bottle tops, cornflakes and dust. Every
    morning at six o'' clock, or whatever that is in maritime parlance, Captain Flask
    drank a whole pint of milk of magnesia.

    Oh, he was such a bad man! Such a dangerous man!'
