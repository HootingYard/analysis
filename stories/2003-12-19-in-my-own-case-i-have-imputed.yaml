  text: "\u201CIn my own case I have imputed my early baldness to growth in intellectuality\
    \ and spirituality induced by my fondness for and devotion to books. Miss Susan,\
    \ my sister, lays it to other causes, first among which she declares to be my\
    \ unnatural practice of reading in bed, and the second my habit of eating welsh-rarebits\
    \ late of nights. Over my bed I have a gas-jet so properly shaded that the rays\
    \ of light are concentrated and reflected downward upon the volume which I am\
    \ reading. Miss Susan insists that much of this light and its attendant heat falls\
    \ upon my head, compelling there a dryness of the scalp whereby the follicles\
    \ have been deprived of their natural nourishment and have consequently died.\
    \ She furthermore maintains that the welsh-rarebits of which I partake invariably\
    \ at the eleventh hour every night breed poisonous vapors and subtle megrims within\
    \ my stomach, which humors, rising by their natural courses to my brain, do therein\
    \ produce a fever that from within burneth up the fluids necessary to a healthy\
    \ condition of the capillary growth upon the super-adjacent and exterior cranial\
    \ integument.\u201D\n\u2014Eugene Field, The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac.\n\
    Eugene Field also wrote, among many other works, the children's rhyme Wynken,\
    \ Blynken & Nod. He had a childhood sweetheart with the marvellous name Captivity\
    \ Waite. I wonder if she was any relation to the splendid Asenath Waite in H P\
    \ Lovecraft's The Thing On The Doorstep? Glubb\u2026 glubb\u2026 glubb."
