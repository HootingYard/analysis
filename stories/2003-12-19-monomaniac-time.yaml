  text: "I have always been heartened by those people who devote the best part of\
    \ their lives to some abstruse activity, or field of learning, to the exclusion\
    \ of all else. Sometimes I can quite envy that focus. Take, as an example, Kjell\
    \ Scharning, indefatigable collector of bird-related postage stamps. His site\
    \ is a marvel. Click on the ostrich and go and look, and lose yourself for hours\u2026\
