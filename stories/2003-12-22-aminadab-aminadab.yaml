  text: '"Aminadab! Aminadab!" shouted Aylmer, stamping violently on the floor. Forthwith
    there issued from an inner apartment a man of low stature, but bulky frame, with
    shaggy hair hanging about his visage, which was grimed with the vapours of the
    furnace ... "Throw open the door of the boudoir, Aminadab," said Aylmer, "and
    burn a pastille."
