  text: How are we to get the measure of Dobson? We do not know his first name. We
    know neither the year of his birth, nor that of his death. (We do know that he
    is buried near his favourite lighthouse.) Virtually every last scrap of his work
    has been destroyed. All that remains is a short play, The Glue In The Palace Was
    Rarefied; The Putty Was Dreadful. This astonishing drama has only ever been performed
    once, on the London radio station Resonance FM, by Pansy Cradledew and Evrah--and
    even then, it was misattributed to someone called Istvan Scrimgeour. Here, then,
    for your pleasure & education, is Dobson's majestic work in all its glory!
