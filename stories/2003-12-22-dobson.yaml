  text: "How are we to get the measure of Dobson? We do not know his first name. We\
    \ know neither the year of his birth, nor that of his death. (We do know that\
    \ he is buried near his favourite lighthouse.) Virtually every last scrap of his\
    \ work has been destroyed. All that remains is a short play, The Glue In The Palace\
    \ Was Rarefied; The Putty Was Dreadful. This astonishing drama has only ever been\
    \ performed once, on the London radio station Resonance FM, by Pansy Cradledew\
    \ and Evrah\u2014and even then, it was misattributed to someone called Istvan\
    \ Scrimgeour. Here, then, for your pleasure & education, is Dobson's majestic\
    \ work in all its glory!"
