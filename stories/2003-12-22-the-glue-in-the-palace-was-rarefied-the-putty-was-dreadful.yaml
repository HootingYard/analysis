  text: "A Play For Two Voices by Dobson\nBim\u2014Look, here is a photograph of Gervase\
    \ wearing spats.\nBam\u2014Exactly what colour is that basin?\nBim\u2014I am standing\
    \ behind a plinth.\nBam\u2014Can I have a look at that owl?\nBim\u2014Do you know\
    \ how to darn a balaclava?\nBam\u2014I tell you, it is made of tin!\nBim\u2014\
    Let me have those bus tickets you are clutching.\nBam\u2014I shudder when I think\u2026\
    \nBim\u2014Oh look! A cormorant!\nBam\u2014I need to get a bandage.\nBim\u2014\
    That pane of glass gives me the creeps.\nBam\u2014Must I chew fennel?\nBim\u2014\
    Lend me a pin.\nBam\u2014Rotate that thing again while I fetch the trumpets.\n\
    Bim\u2014I thought it was an anagram of Pol Pot.\nBam\u2014You unblock the drains\
    \ & I\u2019ll wear a curious hat.\nBim\u2014At eight o clock I will have to go\
    \ to the pantry.\nBam\u2014Did you know that Gerard Manley Hopkins mesmerised\
    \ a duck?\nBim\u2014Perhaps Maisie has gone to her boudoir.\nBam\u2014Is that\
    \ real dust?\nBim\u2014The carapace of reason has been submerged in a puddle of\
    \ confusion.\nBam\u2014I can hear the dying groans of a police officer.\nBim\u2014\
    That is a very untidy lid!\nBam\u2014Please show me how to use the whisk.\nBim\u2014\
    He used to have two of those cartons, but one was crushed.\nBam\u2014Leave that\
    \ cutlery where it belongs.\nBim\u2014Can I take that delicious pudding back to\
    \ my chalet?\nBam\u2014Hand me that chaffinch.\nBim\u2014Worse things happen at\
    \ sea.\nBam\u2014Perhaps it used to be a hydroelectric power station.\nBim\u2014\
    I had a nightmare about hens.\nBam\u2014There is a very good biography by Grevel\
    \ Lindop.\nBim\u2014There is something sinister about that pot of mustard.\nBam\u2014\
    Have one of my spangles.\nBim\u2014Tarry not \u2018neath the fat & sparkling stars.\n\
    Bam\u2014I come from haunts of coot & hern.\nBim\u2014(ecstatically) So do I!\n\
