  text: 'A Play For Two Voices by Dobson

    Bim--Look, here is a photograph of Gervase wearing spats.

    Bam--Exactly what colour is that basin?

    Bim--I am standing behind a plinth.

    Bam--Can I have a look at that owl?

    Bim--Do you know how to darn a balaclava?

    Bam--I tell you, it is made of tin!

    Bim--Let me have those bus tickets you are clutching.

    Bam--I shudder when I think...

    Bim--Oh look! A cormorant!

    Bam--I need to get a bandage.

    Bim--That pane of glass gives me the creeps.

    Bam--Must I chew fennel?

    Bim--Lend me a pin.

    Bam--Rotate that thing again while I fetch the trumpets.

    Bim--I thought it was an anagram of Pol Pot.

    Bam--You unblock the drains & I''ll wear a curious hat.

    Bim--At eight o clock I will have to go to the pantry.

    Bam--Did you know that Gerard Manley Hopkins mesmerised a duck?

    Bim--Perhaps Maisie has gone to her boudoir.

    Bam--Is that real dust?

    Bim--The carapace of reason has been submerged in a puddle of confusion.

    Bam--I can hear the dying groans of a police officer.

    Bim--That is a very untidy lid!

    Bam--Please show me how to use the whisk.

    Bim--He used to have two of those cartons, but one was crushed.

    Bam--Leave that cutlery where it belongs.

    Bim--Can I take that delicious pudding back to my chalet?

    Bam--Hand me that chaffinch.

    Bim--Worse things happen at sea.

    Bam--Perhaps it used to be a hydroelectric power station.

    Bim--I had a nightmare about hens.

    Bam--There is a very good biography by Grevel Lindop.

    Bim--There is something sinister about that pot of mustard.

    Bam--Have one of my spangles.

    Bim--Tarry not ''neath the fat & sparkling stars.

    Bam--I come from haunts of coot & hern.

    Bim--(ecstatically) So do I!
