  text: Here is another classic from the vaults, By Aerostat to Hooting Yard. The
    original text has not been tampered with, even though it probably ought to be.
    Please note that the character Dobson in this story is not related to Dobson the
    playwright (see below, 22nd December), nor are either of them connected to either
    of The Two Dobsons, protagonists of that classic British chiller of 1947. The
    British Film Institute maintains its bizarre refusal to acknowledge the existence
    of this cinematic masterpiece. That doyen of film historians, Thorold Dickinson,
    always used to make his excuses and leave whenever anyone attempted to mention
    it in conversation. My father said that if he had had a penny for every time he
    had seen Dickinson sweeping off with his greatcoat about his shoulders, he would
    have been a very rich man.
