  text: 'by Frank Key

    Oh, I so wanted this to be a seafaring yarn. I wanted to hear the wind in the
    rigging, smell the salt tang in the breeze, roll with the creak and lurch of old
    wooden boards on the deck. I wanted to write a maritime tale, of a fabric woven
    of ships'' cables and hawsers, an arctic wind blowing through it and birds of
    prey hovering over it. I wanted to prattle on about smacks, bilgewater, fo''c''sles,
    and splicing the mainbrace, whatever that means. Pirates would appear, cutlasses
    gleaming. Perched in the crow''s nest, I would yell "land ahoy!", then scurry
    down the rigging to help tamp down the binnacles.

    At first, things had looked hopeful. I had received my instructions from Dobson.
    As ever, he was precise: "Track down Burble. Beat him to death with a club. Wrap
    him in chains and throw him down a flooded mineshaft. I shall expect a full report
    upon your return. Dobson."

    As soon as I had read his memo, I doused it in highly inflammable chemicals and
    took it down to the boiler room of my building. There, in solitude and gloom,
    I placed it in the roaring furnace. The flames licked up towards my face, and
    I turned away. I knew the tears would not be long in coming.

    It had been two years since one of Dobson''s communiques had uprooted me from
    my rut and catapulted me into frantic adventure; three years before that I had
    been sent on a mission, ranging over four continents; the year before that embroiled
    in a world-shattering plot; and there had been at least half a dozen earlier escapades.
    No doubt these Dobson-inspired excitements were meant to be wild and life-enhancing,
    yet I yearned for tedium and futility. Trudging out of the boiler room, I began
    to sob. It would be weeks, perhaps months, before I could once again wallow in
    monotony and ennui.

    Despite my misgivings, I am very particular about my work. Dobson has even accused
    me of being finicky. I began to pack at once, having dusted down the enormous
    haversack which I always carry on my assignments. Within an hour of receiving
    my instructions, the packing was done, and I was perched on a wooden stool in
    my kitchen, wolfing down a bowl of slops. I had no idea when next I would eat.
    Having twice been struck by lightning while doing Dobson''s bidding, I had taken
    the precaution of sprinkling finely-ground purslane on to my slops, and stashing
    a small pouch of the stuff in my haversack. Another half hour and I was out of
    the door and on my way. The weather was incomprehensible: I shall not record it
    here. I checked my watch by the gasworks'' clock and spat into a hedgerow.

    It was not for me to question why Dobson wanted Burble obliterated, yet I could
    not help feeling a small pang of surprise. I had always understood Burble to be
    a trusted agent, a man who could be relied upon. I knew for a fact that he had
    been invaluable when Perkins and Throwback contracted the dengue, and were ensnared
    by a band of repressed mahouts. I could only assume that he had lately committed
    some heinous offence for which Dobson could not forgive him. What on earth could
    he have done? But I could not allow myself to dwell on such matters. It would
    not get the dog bathed, the roof fed, or the baby mended, whatever that saying
    is. I spat into a hedgerow and lurched onwards.

    Over the years, I have paid a great deal of attention to gaits, and have a repertoire
    of ambulatory techniques which the greatest of actors would envy. My usual form
    of locomotion is a sort of huffish lope. It should go without saying that, when
    engaged on one of Dobson''s missions, I take diligent pains to disguise this.
    Prancing, hobbling, limping, trudging and scampering can all be brought into play.
    I am unusually adept at hurtling, stamping and scuttling, and have on occasion
    found it useful to bound, stride, plod, gad, or stalk. However, in the initial
    stages of any mission, I am an inveterate lurcher. I find that it aids the circulation,
    hones the brain, and abolishes any creeping panic. One day I shall write an essay
    explaining why.

    I lurched to the docks, of course: all Dobson''s assignments begin at the docks.
    While heating up the pan of slops in my kitchen, I had done a spot of preliminary
    research. The first thing I had to do was to find Burble, and he could be anywhere.
    Leafing through my card index, I traced his movements over the past year. He had
    spent Easter with Woodenberry in the Antarctic, swiftly moving on through Bloody
    Foreland, Concrete, Lake Disappointment, Elk, Flin Flon and Gubbio. I already
    knew that he had been in Hobart for most of July. I was unable to discover his
    whereabouts during the latter part of that month or for the first week in August.
    On the eighth, however, he turned up in Innsmouth, staying only a couple of days
    before a frantic spree through Jubbulpore, Kintap, Largs, Middle Tongue, Novi
    Bug, Orb, Pickle Crow, Quorn, Reindeer Depot and Splat. He spent Christmas in
    Teutoburger Wald and, typically, saw in the new year at Unst. Again there was
    a gap, then Burble turned up once more, in February, in Ventry, then in Weed.
    After that he travelled through Xacxicz, Yodd, and Zug. An intriguing fellow,
    I thought to myself. But was he still in Zug? I could only find out by going there:
    after all, I had to start somewhere.

    I allowed half an hour for the slops to digest, using the time to trawl through
    the shipping timetables. I could make head nor tail of them. My head spun, shimmers
    and jangles frolicked in my brain, and I nearly threw up my slops. I ingested
    a handful of crushed mugwort and immediately felt better. A damned good lurch,
    weighed down by my massive haversack, helped to dispel further the throbbing in
    my skull.

    It took just four hours to arrive at the docks. They were splendid, but indescribable.
    I think Dobson attempted to write about them in one of his absurd pamphlets, but
    as usual I cannot remember a word of it. It hardly matters. I lurched past a group
    of stevedores, who were mucking about with torque wrenches, baskets, lengths of
    flax, that sort of equipment. One of them, resplendent in a toxic vest, hailed
    me.

    "You there!" he cried, "Can you lend us a hand with these torque wrenches, baskets,
    and lengths of flax?"

    "I''ll do what I can," I replied, easing my haversack to the ground and rolling
    up my shirt sleeves. This was a break I could ill afford to ignore. My plan was
    to stow away on board a steamer bound for Zug''s nearest port, wherever it was.
    This subterfuge was essential. It was quite impossible for me to buy a ticket,
    have my name appear on a passenger list, dine at the captain''s table, take part
    in deck-board pingpong tournaments, and suchlike hooha. I could not risk incurring
    Dobson''s wrath: look what lay in store for Burble. This was the perfect opportunity.
    If I could win the confidence of these stevedores, by dint of garrulity and bonhomie,
    they would hopefully assist me to board a ship in secret. I spat on my hands.

    "How can I help?" I asked.

    "Could you help us put these torque wrenches into these baskets and wrap these
    lengths of flax around them?" said the stevedore. I nodded my assent.

    Everything went according to plan. Some weeks later, exhausted, my spirit virtually
    broken, I was holed up below the decks of the Milquetoast Jesuit, due to sail
    any day to a port near Zug. My stevedore pals had been magnificent. Having identified
    the ship, they bribed one of the crew to arrange a space for me, hidden among
    the stowage in the hold, where I could lie safely concealed for the duration of
    the voyage. This matelot, who was grimy and incoherent, was also to ensure that
    I did not starve or perish from thirst, although I had no worries on that count,
    as I had packed several bags of mush in my haversack.

    At dead of night, I shared a last flagon of grog with the stevedores. We sat around
    a rusted oildrum in a particularly smelly corner of the dockyard, our only light
    a storm-lantern hanging from a nail rammed into the crumbling wall. At the appointed
    hour, the matelot arrived. We heard his snivelling before he came into view. This
    could not be tolerated: absolute silence would be necessary if we were to avoid
    discovery. The matelot apologised, with much slobbering, explaining that only
    seconds before his arrival he had developed a massive nosebleed. One of the stevedores
    was all for wrapping a tourniquet round his neck to staunch the flow, but I managed
    to intervene, unleashing from my pocket a medical dictionary and brandishing it
    above my head. I always carried this little booklet with me on my assignments.
    Dobson had written it many years ago, and forbade his agents to move so much as
    an inch without it. Although it is woefully lacking in diagrams, it is a boon
    to the amateur, shedding a Dobsonian light on all sorts of maladies and distempers,
    including agues, biting by mad dogs, choleric fluxes, dislocations, epidemics,
    frenzy, gall, hoarseness, inflammations, jaundice, knots in the flesh, loss of
    teeth, megrims, noise in the ears, obstructions of the spleen, pestilence, quinsy,
    ringworm, strangury, tetters, unmentionable horrors, vexation, whitlows, xenoglossic
    fury, yowling, and zombiedom. Where and when Dobson picked up all this information
    I cannot say. He certainly underwent no medical training to speak of, unless his
    autobiography is a pack of lies. That would not surprise me. Leaving the stevedores
    to bone up on nosebleeds, I rummaged in my haversack and took out some hound''s-tongue
    and knapweed. Both had been crushed to a powder and stored in leathern pouches.
    I had only the grog to work with, but I made an infusion and commanded the matelot
    to drink it in one hurried slurp. Moments later, the bleeding stopped. He wiped
    his mouth and chin with a filthy rag and let out a belch. It was time to go.

    Three weeks later, under cover of a pitch black night sky, I boarded the packet
    steamer Milquetoast Jesuit. The matelot and I had had innumerable adventures in
    the interim, none of which I shall record here. Dobson would only complain. We
    made our way down into the stowage without being seen. The matelot had prepared
    for me a rough wooden box, stacked among a heterogeneous jumble of crates, hampers,
    barrels and bales. Dribbling, he assured me that no member of the crew would ever
    come anywhere near this part of the hold. The air, what there was of it, was disgusting
    and fetid. In the stinking gloom, we shook hands. I understood that the ship was
    to set sail at any time in the next four days, and that I would not see my accomplice
    again until we were out at sea.

    Left to myself, I lit my Curpin lantern and examined the wooden box which would
    be my home for the next few weeks--or so I thought. The matelot had done me proud.
    The box had been lined with plush crimplene. Cushions stuffed with natural sea-sponge
    were strewn about, as were little pot pourris of pimpernel and lavender. A rickety
    wooden shelf had been whacked up along one side of the box, containing a splendid
    library of books with which I could pass the time. Most of the titles were pulp
    science fiction or detective stories, including The Zinc Lozenge by Cupper, The
    Windy Quaker by Dawlish, The Case of the Tonsured Drunks by Kurt Pith, and The
    X-Ray-Eyed Galley-Slave by Sinbad Hoonjaw. I was pleased, however, to note that
    I had been provided with a couple of stern devotional tracts, Prayer and Imbecility
    by Monsignor Todge, and A Flask of Potage by Moop and Trellis. Underneath the
    shelf was a metal canister. I removed the lid, and found that it was a portable
    refrigerator, packed with highly expensive bottles of wine. Next to the canister
    was a dinky tray laden with a corkscrew, wineglass, and binary muffets. There
    was no sign of any food, but I had my bags of mush. Placing my haversack in the
    cleverly-designed cubby-hole of the box, I reclined on the straw pallet, arranged
    some of the cushions around me, and tried to shrug off the foul stench assaulting
    my nostrils. Within minutes, I was fast asleep. Meanwhile, up on deck and unbeknown
    to me, the purser was smearing all the lifeboats with a decoction of oakum and
    wormwood. According to Dobson, this sort of thing is quite common, although ships''
    crews are loth to admit it.

    When I woke up in my dark and smelly box, my watch had stopped. Here was a predicament:
    I had no idea how long I had been asleep. As I took cognizance of my surroundings,
    it soon became apparent that the Milquetoast Jesuit was still in port. I cracked
    open one of the wine-bottles and swigged it through clenched teeth. Unfortunately,
    after a period of sleep my co-ordination was not at its best, and I managed to
    bash and dislodge one of my incisors. The wine swilled around in my gob, mingling
    with blood which was now pouring from my gums. Had the matelot thought of packing
    a first aid kit? I doubted it. I spat into one of the pot pourris and cursed heaven.
    As I did so, I was astonished to hear the sound of footsteps and snivelling coming
    from somewhere among the ramshackle stacks of stowage. Moments later, the matelot
    appeared, a torch clutched in his grimy fist. "What on earth are you doing here?"
    I hissed. The fool was meant to stay away from me until we were safely out to
    sea. If my presence were discovered now, I would without doubt be ejected from
    the ship and have my haversack impounded by the maritime authorities: the same
    fate that had befallen Perkins at the outset of the expropriated vinegar case.
    Dobson had been livid. The matelot did not reply. He merely handed me a scrunched
    up piece of paper and, turning on his heel, scurried off. I was bewildered, but
    only for a moment. Spitting out another gobbet, I unscrunched the piece of paper:
    it was blank. What inanity was this? The matelot must have taken leave of his
    senses. In a sudden fury, I tore the paper to shreds, then settled back on the
    pallet to eat a bag of mush. Only as the last mouthful slithered down my throat
    did it occur to me that I must have looked at the wrong side of the paper. I was
    about to gather the shreds from the floor when the Curpin lantern went out. I
    was plunged into complete darkness, unable to see my hand in front of my face.
    Hm.

    Luck, as Dobson says, begins with L. Another thing that begins with L is lout''s-skull,
    a rare and spiky herb found only on a few mountain slopes in Van Glubb''s Land.
    If boiled in a little oil, it is good for shrunken sinews, and it helps to relieve
    the dropsy and diseases of the spleen. Among its more unlikely properties, lout''s-skull
    will, under certain conditions, become incandescent and burst into an all-consuming
    conflagration like unto the fires of hell itself. As luck would have it, a crate
    of desiccated lout''s-skull was among the cargo of the Milquetoast Jesuit, and
    the conditions in the hold were just right for the inferno to be provoked. My
    Curpin lantern did not, as I thought, go out: rather, I was temporarily blinded
    by the intense brilliance of explosive lout''s-skull. The noise came afterwards,
    a horrible sucking and seething sound, redolent of leeches, tiny pigs, and things
    that suck and seethe. The water in the harbour evaporated. The ship itself simply
    vanished, blown to smithereens. I have no idea how I walked out of the devastation
    alive, clutching my haversack. But I did.

    My first thought was to find the matelot, or at least to ascertain whether he
    was alive or dead. After all, he may have disembarked just before the explosion,
    or he may have survived it, as I had. I was about to prance into the nearest tavern
    when I was waylaid by a spangled monster. It was hilariously unkempt, and its
    provenance was dubious. Luring me into a shadowy nook, it drooled and growled,
    growled and drooled. My pulse raced. I tried to work out how I could reach the
    turpentine gun in my haversack before the monster did something unspeakable. I
    need not have worried. It was Perkins, of course.

    "I bring news from Dobson," he said, unravelling himself from his stupendous disguise
    and lighting a cheroot.

    "Gosh," I said. Then, pulling myself together, I asked Perkins as calmly as I
    could what Dobson had to say. It was almost unprecedented to receive a further
    message following initial instructions: Dobson trusted his agents to get on with
    the job. In truth, I felt indignant, and told Perkins as much.

    "Ach!" he snarled, "Dobson, Dobson, Dobson. He is in his dotage, you know that.
    He hardly knows what he''s doing anymore." He paused, seeming to agonise for a
    moment.

    "Forgive me, I should not speak so. Dobson is Dobson, and that is enough. Let
    me tell you his message." Perkins spent about ten minutes rummaging through a
    variety of pockets, pouches, fobs, sockets, recesses and vanity bags before triumphantly
    brandishing a crumpled shoe-box in my face.

    "Here it is!" he cried, tears of joy streaming down his face. Removing the lid
    from the box, he took out a little booklet, leafed through the pages, stopped
    at one and, wagging his finger in the air, read:

    "Re: Burble. His travels over the last year are a series of lavish untruths. I
    was nearly taken in. He has been holed up in Hooting Yard all the time. I am not
    trying to interfere but I thought you ought to know. Dobson."

    Bang went my chances of writing a seafaring yarn. Hooting Yard was only two hours
    away, by bus. Perkins and I vanished into the nearest tavern to get drunk. As
    we toped, we talked. And as we talked, we discovered a mutual interest in the
    more outre aspects of Dobson''s history: his love of abnormal biscuits; his residence
    for eight years in a cod doss-house; the time he suffered from exposure in a foundry;
    his guilt about horses; the day he was injured by a jack-hammer; his insistence
    that a kraken had appeared in his latrine; his macabre napkin; his ounce of pebbles;
    his questionable rubric; his slabs of titanium; his illegal adoption of an unhinged
    vintner; his waterlogged xylographs; and his predilection for yellow zips. After
    innumerable pints of sour beer, we reeled out of the tavern, Perkins turning off
    towards the abandoned fireworks depot while I hurtled to the bus stop, where I
    discovered that all buses between the docks and Hooting Yard had been taken permanently
    out of service due to imponderable resin and pomposity. I lay prostrate on a paving
    slab and devoured another bag of mush. Then I returned to the tavern.

    I eventually travelled to Hooting Yard by hot-air balloon, or aerostat. I met
    the pilot--if that is the word--in the tavern. Her name was Mopsa Blomqvist, and
    she agreed to carry me and my haversack purely as ballast. In other words, we
    would be hurled over the side should occasion arise. This was of no concern to
    me, as I had a parachute in my haversack: ha! Mopsa was bound for the outskirts
    of Hoon, carrying a strangely assorted cargo including a barometer and compass,
    flags, anchors, cork jackets, a packet of pamphlets, a bottle of brandy, some
    biscuits, apples, two useless silk-covered aerial oars, an equally useless rudder,
    and a moulinet--a sort of hand-operated revolving fan. We got up safely, and I
    settled back to read some of the pamphlets. I was startled to discover that Dobson
    had written one of them. It was a tetchy little tract entitled Ninety-Two Uses
    and Abuses of Mustard. I barely got beyond the first few sentences: the prose
    was terse but doltish. Peering over the rim of the basket, I saw the sort of scene
    one sees from the basket of a balloon. We had been in the air for perhaps quarter
    of an hour when we were buffeted by an unearthly flock of spiny winged things.
    I am afraid that I screeched with fright. Mopsa Blomqvist showed rather more presence
    of mind, lashing at the malevolent beasts with a gleaming cutlass. But it was
    too late: the air-bag had already been punctured, and we began immediately to
    lose altitude. Mopsa carried out a number of exciting technical adjustments involving
    the gores, valves and flaps of the aerostat. Meanwhile, I searched desperately
    in my haversack for the parachute. Our descent quickened.

    "We are plummeting towards the ground very fast," shouted Mopsa, "Hold on to your
    hat!"

    "I am not wearing a hat," I replied, quaking with terror.

    "Here!" she cried, tossing me a worm-eaten biretta. I thwacked it on to my skull
    in the nick of time. We crashed to earth, with much bumping, thumping, and a series
    of splats.

    Miraculously, I was unharmed. Mopsa herself suffered only a lesion on her brow,
    although the spokes on her wheelchair were terribly mangled. We dragged ourselves
    clear of the silk and wicker wreckage and fetched up in a ditch. Mopsa had managed
    to salvage the biscuits and the useless rudder. I expelled a mouthful of mud and
    reached into my haversack for various bits and pieces of navigational equipment,
    including an extensively detailed map.

    "Look!" gasped Mopsa, as she dallied with a biscuit, "There are the gates of Hooting
    Yard!"

    What an old slowcoach I was!--so busy rooting around in my haversack that I did
    not use my eyes. Mopsa was right. I followed her pointing finger and saw a tremendous
    brickish portal, ornamented with lozenged carvings of quicklime, bilberry and
    glunt. I had reached my destination. Somewhere behind those gates lurked Burble,
    and I was coming for him. Mopsa''s wheelchair was soon knocked back into shape,
    and she rattled off towards the outskirts of Hoon. Before she left, and despite
    my protestations, she insisted that I take half of her biscuits. As soon as her
    back was turned, I ground them into the muck beneath my boot. I could not bear
    the distractions of shortbread: my mush-bags would suffice.

    I traced Burble easily, and carried out Dobson''s instructions without a hitch.
    The flooded mineshaft was on a patch of waste ground four or five miles from Hooting
    Yard. Somewhat gratuitously, I wiped the blood off my hands with Burble''s own
    cravat. It had been embroidered by hand--his sweetheart''s?--depicting in intricate
    detail a selection of uproarious scenes from the Old Testament. For a moment,
    I considered keeping it as a souvenir. Pah! What a thought. I tossed it down the
    mineshaft, at the bottom of which lay the fresh corpse of Burble. Taking a blowtorch
    out of my haversack, I incinerated the wheelbarrow in which I had trundled his
    body to this detestable spot. When all that remained was a pile of ashes, I turned
    away and began the long plod back to Hooting Yard. The night air reeked of Stalinism.
    I pulled my cardigan tighter around my body and lit up one of Perkins'' cheroots.
    As I plodded, I rehearsed in my head the opening lines of the report I would write
    for Dobson.

    "Your instructions arrived at midnight. I was dog tired, having spent the evening
    slaughtering a colony of flies. Nevertheless, I took immediate steps. My first
    thought was to select the weapon. You specified a club, and I hoped I would not
    be straying too far from your intentions by using a leaden madge. I went up to
    the attic to fetch it. There was no battery in my torch, and I clambered - "

    Such drivel! Would Dobson be interested in all the detail? But he had asked for
    a full report, and he was going to get one. " - and I clambered over the huge
    iron crates which were stacked in my loft. I could hardly see a thing. Eventually,
    I identified the correct crate, and blasted it open. Inside, underneath a pile
    of anti-matter, I found the madge. It had last been used to pound some ragwort
    into oblivion, and minute traces of the plant were embedded on the head. The madge
    would need a thorough cleaning. Descending from the attic, I filled the bath,
    donned a rather fetching kit of protective clothing, and hurled a glorious array
    of chemical preparations into the piping hot water. I then plunged the madge into
    the bath."

    These not unpleasant--though wholly fictional--recollections were interrupted
    before I was even half-way back to Hooting Yard. A figure loomed before me in
    the darkness. As I closed upon it, I saw that it was Crunlop.

    "Why, Crunlop!" I cried, "You have the appearance of a maniac. You are dishevelled
    and frowsty and pale. Your teeth are clenched and, although the light is not good,
    I can see that your features are distorted by an awful rictus. You are brandishing
    a dirk."

    Crunlop made no reply, but lunged towards me, aiming the dirk at my throat. If
    I were to avoid a grisly death, I would have to act fast. I stepped to one side,
    swivelled, ducked, and shimmied in an alarming fashion designed to bewilder my
    assailant. At the same time, I eased the haversack from my shoulders, lifted it
    above my head, and brought it crashing down on Crunlop''s skull. He crumpled to
    the ground. Removing Dobson''s medical dictionary from the haversack, I satisfied
    myself that Crunlop was dead. I then made a thorough search of his countless pockets.
    It was almost dawn before I finished emptying them, spreading their contents out
    on the ground around his body. Among the aniseed balls, bleach, corks, diuretics,
    ergot, floorcloths, gobstoppers, hurricane-lamps, ink, jam, kale, landing-nets,
    morris tubes, nard, orts, polio vaccines, quicksilver, rep, shears, tholes, ukulele
    strings, valves, wading, xanthene, yoghurt and zootomy diagrams, I found what
    I was looking for. I knew that Crunlop was too stupid to destroy his instructions
    from Dobson, as I always did, and there in the midst of the rubbish was a small
    piece of paper, torn none too carefully from a notebook, on which Dobson had scrawled
    his orders. I spat into the bracken, and read them.

    "Track down Scrimgeour. Waylay him, and slit his throat with a dirk. Then bury
    him under a geologically improbable pile of rocks. I shall expect your report
    as soon as possible. Dobson." Perkins had hinted that Dobson''s brain was now
    a puny and curdled thing, but, still, I was crushed by this revelation. I slumped
    to the ground, scrunching a piece of Crunlop''s rep in my fists. Tiny things with
    dozens of legs scurried around me, climbing on to my socks and into my boots.
    I left them to get on with it.

    The dawn blasted me out of my stupor. I could not remain sitting around in the
    open country next to a dead man, the contents of his pockets strewn around me:
    I would look for all the world like a common robber. My first thought was to throw
    Crunlop down the flooded mineshaft, but I was a couple of miles away from it now,
    and I could hardly drag his body that far. His girth was vast. I think that was
    why Dobson had hired him. In his essay Triton Among The Minnows, Dobson expounded
    at length upon his loathing of all that was microscopic, elfin, or wee. He only
    employed me because I am almost seven feet tall, although I have been shrinking
    recently. It is most perplexing, the more so because my usual font of medical
    information, Dobson''s dictionary, has absolutely no light to shed on the condition.
    I had been planning to tax him with this, perhaps in a little postscript to my
    report. Well, now there would be no report.

    Aha! It was obvious, obvious. Dobson would assume I was dead, and who was I to
    gainsay him? Snorting with glee, I hurriedly buried Crunlop under a pile of rocks.
    The wasteland outside Hooting Yard could hardly have been bettered for providing
    a geologically improbable mound, as demanded in the instructions. I heaped great
    lumps and clodges of stuff on top of Crunlop. Bauxite rubbed shoulders with thop,
    chert with marl, wunt with calcium. By the time I had finished, I was matted with
    filth. I gathered together Crunlop''s pitiful agglomeration of odds and ends,
    including the dirk, and shoved the lot into my haversack.

    When I got back to Hooting Yard it was lunchtime. I sat by the canal and devoured
    an enormous pot of boiling custard. One day I would be able to go home, but first
    I had to send Dobson a report: Crunlop''s report. I stole a barge and spent a
    couple of years moored in an unspeakable fen. I assumed the air of a bargee, sprouting
    decisive mustachios and wearing a brocade mantle of some antiquity. I sold off
    the barge''s cargo of rotting vegetable matter and made myself at home. I had
    wanted to write a seafaring yarn, but this would have to do. As I sat at my little
    escritoire, water rats gnawing at my boots, the stench of bilgewater wafting around
    me, I listened to the clanking of dredgers and the screeching flocks of beasts
    with wings. I had never been so happy. I took up my pencil and wrote:

    "Dear Dobson. Scrimgeour has been obliterated. He did not put up a struggle. I
    am sending the dirk to you under separate cover. Farewell. Crunlop."'
