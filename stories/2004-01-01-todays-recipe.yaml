  text: 'To make Patis, or Cabbage Cream. Take thirty Ale pints of new milke, and
    set it on the fire in a Kettle till it be scalding hot, stirring it oft to keep
    it from creaming, then put in forth, into thirty Pans of Earth, as you put it
    forth, take off the bubbles with a spoon, let it stand till it be cold, then take
    off the Cream with two such slices as you beat Bisket bread with, but they must
    be very thin and not too broad, then when the Milk is dropped off the Cream, you
    must lay it upon a Pye-plate, you must scour the Kettle very clean and heat the
    Milk again, and so four or five times. In the lay of it, first lay a stalk in
    the midst of the Plate, let the rest of the Cream be laid upon that sloping, between
    every laying you must scrape Sugar and sprinkle Rose-water, and if you will, the
    powder of Musk, and Amber-greece, in the heating of the Milk be carefull of smoak.
