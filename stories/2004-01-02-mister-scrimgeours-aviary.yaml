  text: 'Last Tuesday, Mr Scrimgeour realised his lifelong ambition. Five hundred
    yards to the south of the Pang Hill Orphanage, he threw open the gates of his
    aviary. The tots had been gathered outside for three hours, the tinier ones literally
    wetting themselves with excitement. The big fat sun battered down: it was a cloudless
    day.

    Mr Scrimgeour had announced the opening of his aviary only the day before, but
    work had been going on for months, if not years. The parentless infants had grown
    used to the sight, from the orphanage windows, of a gigantic fence of corrugated
    iron. Suddenly, overnight, it was gone, the outer walls of the aviary visible
    at last. As they ate their breakfast porridge, they were told that they would
    be the very first visitors. Mr Scrimgeour did not even want to be paid.

    And now, at noon, they marched solemnly in, their excitement replaced by awe.
    At first, there were no birds to be seen. Beyond the main gate, at the end of
    a muddy pathway, were two further gates: huge, of beaten bronze, and each with
    a sign upon it, a single word, black on white, in letters so plain and clear that
    even the most myopic infant could read them, if they could read at all, and many
    of them could not, because the Pang Hill Orphanage was a notoriously ill-run institution,
    the principal an unscrupulous ex-mariner who picked his staff from wretched sinks
    of iniquity down by the docks. Between the gates stood Mr Scrimgeour, wearing
    a peculiarly dainty hat.

    "Hello, hello, oh hello children!" he cried, his jollity somewhat forced. "You
    must come and see my birds! But you must choose. You may only enter through one
    gate. On one side, you will find cages containing specimens of all the birds that
    the Bible says are clean. And on the other, the birds that the Bible says are
    unclean. The choice is yours!"

    The poor little Godless tinies looked at each other, and at Mr Scrimgeour, and
    at the gates. Whatever may lie behind them, the gates themselves were identical--neither
    glistening and shiny nor stained and splattered with muck. They did not know that
    behind one gate they would find turtle doves, pigeons, quails, sparrows, swallows,
    cocks and hens, partridges and cranes, and that behind the other were eagles,
    ossifrage, ospreys, vultures, gledes, kites, ravens, owls, great owls, little
    owls, hawks, nighthawks, cuckoos, cormorants, swans, pelicans, gier eagles, storks,
    herons, lapwings, bats, ostriches, peacocks and bitterns. The poor little mites
    had no idea at all, and they could certainly not ask for guidance from the ruffians
    in whose charge they languished. No doubt, dear reader, you have read your Bible
    and can run to the orphans'' aid, and while you are about it, release the bats!'
