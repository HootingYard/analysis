  text: 'One of the more profound mysteries of modern Hollywood is the career of Kevin
    Costner. He makes a hugely expensive, brainless film--as actor, director, producer
    or any combination thereof--which is critically reviled and commercially disastrous,
    and lo! rather than being cast into the outer darkness, gets to do the same thing
    again--and again. Truly puzzling.

    Which is by way of preamble to one of our favourite parlour games, Costner! Players
    take it in turns to name Kevin Costner-related films ad nauseam, the winner being
    the last one to raid their memory-banks successfully. Tactics are crucial--how
    long should one delay playing a triumphant "Tin Cup!!!"?'
