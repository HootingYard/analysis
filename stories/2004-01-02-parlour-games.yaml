  text: "One of the more profound mysteries of modern Hollywood is the career of Kevin\
    \ Costner. He makes a hugely expensive, brainless film\u2014as actor, director,\
    \ producer or any combination thereof\u2014which is critically reviled and commercially\
    \ disastrous, and lo! rather than being cast into the outer darkness, gets to\
    \ do the same thing again\u2014and again. Truly puzzling.\nWhich is by way of\
    \ preamble to one of our favourite parlour games, Costner! Players take it in\
    \ turns to name Kevin Costner-related films ad nauseam, the winner being the last\
    \ one to raid their memory-banks successfully. Tactics are crucial\u2014how long\
    \ should one delay playing a triumphant \u201CTin Cup!!!\u201D?"
