  text: "Patrick Delany was an 18th century Irish clergyman, a friend of Jonathan\
    \ Swift, who--among other writings--produced fifteen issues of a weekly entitled\
    \ The Humanist in 1757. Among topics addressed in its pages were: the renouncing\
    \ of docked tails for horses; the lawfulness of eating blood; the procreation\
    \ of man after the Flood; and the advantages of polygamy.\nWas The Humanist a\
    \ forerunner of Hooting Yard? I think it was! Here is Delany announcing his intentions\
    \ in the first issue: the paper \"would interest itself in all the concerns of\
    \ human nature ... which means not only amusement ... but likewise something more\
    \ than mere amusement ... being calculated to convey some little useful and entertaining\
    \ knowledge of various kinds, historical, classical, natural, moral, and now and\
    \ then a little religion\".\nOne other note about Delany: he was highly ambitious\
    \ and lived extravagantly beyond his means. At his parish outside Dublin, he decided\
    \ to improve the grounds, and the few acres of land were subjected to an attempt\
    \ to show how \"the obdurate and straight line of the Dutch might he softened\
    \ into a curve, the terrace melted into a swelling bank, and the walks opened\
    \ to catch the vicinal country.\"\nIn An Epistle Upon An Epistle (1730), Swift\
    \ recounted his follies:\nBut you, forsooth, your all must squander\n  On that\
    \ poor spot, call'd Dell-ville, yonder;\n  And when you've been at vast expenses\n\
    \  In whims, parterres, canals and fences,\n  Your assets fail, and cash is wanting;\n\
    \  Nor farther buildings, farther planting;\n  No wonder when you raise and level,\n\
    \  Think this wall low, and that wall bevel.\n  Here a convenient box you found,\n\
    \  Which you demolish'd to the ground;\n  Then built, then took up with your arbour,\n\
    \  And set the house to Rupert Barber."
