  text: 'Today I was idly glancing through the Sunday morning television schedules,
    as I so rarely do, when I noticed something quite intriguing on Channel 5:

    6.35 Dappledown Farm. 7.00 The Save-Ums! 7.30 Oswald. 7.45 Make Way For Noddy.
    8.00 The Book of Pooh.

    Sadly it was already past 7.30 by the time I read this, so I missed the programme,
    but how interesting that the channel throws in a fifteen-minute documentary about
    JFK''s alleged assassin among all those children''s shows. I fully expect in future
    weeks to see the slot filled with shows such as Wilkes Booth, Princip, Sirhan
    and Tsafendas.'
