  text: At Hooting Yard we have a pantheon of saints, characters past and present,
    fictional and factual, to whom we award the Tin Badge of Tantarabim, or even the
    Button of Beb. Every now and then potted biographies of such figures will appear
    here. One lost hero to whose cult we have never subscribed, however, is James
    Dean. It's not so much active dislike as indifference--sorry, James. I mention
    this only because, apropos of nothing at all, I have always been delighted by
    the name of the other driver involved in Dean's fatal car crash in 1955--one DONALD
    TURNUPSEED, no less. (Turnupseed survived the crash and died peacefully forty
    years later.)
