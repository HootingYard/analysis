  text: "Sir,: Idly scanning your website today I couldn't help noticing the similarity\
    \ between the parlour game Costner! (see below, 2nd January), and the ancient\
    \ East Anglian game of Tull!, which helped me pass many a cold Norwich evening\
    \ back at the start of the 1980s. They appear to be alike in many respects, except\
    \ for the fact that Tull! contestants would have no use for such phrases as \u201C\
    Field of Dreams\u201D or \u201CTable for Five\u201D, since the object of the game\
    \ was to torment one's opponent beyond the point of exhaustion with old Jethro\
    \ Tull album titles. A typical opening gambit might be, \u201CHeavy Horses\u201D\
    , prompting the reply \u201CSongs from the Wood\u201D. \u201CMinstrel in the Gallery\u201D\
    \ would very likely follow, then maybe \u201CThick as a Brick\u201D or \u201C\
    Too Old To Rock n Roll, Too Young To Die\u201D, until, as with Costner!, someone\
    \ would inevitably play the trump card: in this case, \u201CAqualung\u201D. Whoever\
    \ managed to dredge up the most examples of codpiece-wearing, standing-on-one-leg-style\
    \ flute-infested tomfoolery was declared the winner. Indeed, perhaps the two games\
    \ are more closely connected than previously imagined, since Ian Anderson of the\
    \ Tull was renowned for his \u201Cinteresting\u201D stage gear of medieval tights\
    \ and pointy boots\u2014an outfit later modelled to no good effect by our Kevin\
    \ in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.\nI beg to remain, etc etc,\n  Max Decharne"
