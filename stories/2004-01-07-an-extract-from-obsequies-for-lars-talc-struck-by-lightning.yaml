    Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in memory of Lars Talc. How can I do justice
    to the memory of such a man? Let me say this. He owed me a great deal of money.
    He was covered in dust. He couldn''t tell the difference between a heron & a moorhen.
    He never learned the rules of ice hockey. He was often plagued by mysterious boils.
    He had a scar on his left shin. He confused the different metallic elements. His
    hair was often unkempt. He set fire to a bible. His pigs were neglected. Adept
    at pingpong, he weighted his bat. He once suffered from scrofula. His tent had
    many holes. He never wore a hat. His gas bills drove him crackers. He spoke umpteen
    languages. His mother told me he was terrified of swans. Geology was beyond him.
    He hankered for doilies. He counted toads. His bath was made of tin. His first
    marriage was disastrous. He could not ride a bicycle. He spat out mayonnaise.
    He avoided paying for hotel rooms by clambering down fire escapes. Once he built
    his own bridge. He burned himself in effigy. He loved to eat turnips. He often
    drooled. His thumbs were deformed. Rust and rime engaged his attention. He was
    much travelled. He designed his own pen-nibs. He kept a photograph of Ricardo
    Montalban in his bureau. His eyesight was atrocious. Candles have been lit for
    him. His credentials were spotless. He punched a fishmonger. He gutted huts. Linctus
    slithered down his throat. He owned dozens of fret-saws. He thought the moon was
    his lover. In Didcot he wept. He fed flamingos with cream crackers. In certain
    circles his name was mud. He kept his gutta-percha in a gunny sack. The sight
    of geese made him anxious. He smoked cheroots. He re-counted toads. He held aloft
    a blubber-lantern on the banks of a duckpond. His saliva was bitter. Taxes were
    levied upon him. He had a zest for crumpled things. In parks he pondered. He bit
    his fingernails. He chewed spinach. At a pinch he would talk for hours on the
    subject of straw. He wiped his bottom with leaves. He wrote a book about gnats.
    He mumbled through a tube. Things dangled from the ceiling of his boudoir. He
    lost on the horses. He wrapped a tortoise in blankets. As a youth he survived
    on crusts. His father painted difficult maps. Often he behaved like a madman.
    Twigs and branches fell unremarked in his garden. Rowing held no allure for him.
    He dabbed at his brow with ointments. He was fond of cormorants. He coaxed mice
    from their nooks. He was knocked down by a runaway bus. Clods of earth surrounded
    him. He could be petulant. He strained things in a muslin net. He pulverised a
    diving board with his bare hands. Morse code baffled him. He nearly became a marine.
    He moved his arms towards the lake. Under a cow tower he looked at planks. He
    overcame his stutter. His sheep had worms. He crossed himself. He played at bagatelle.
    He spied a crocus. He fainted. He snored. He panted. He sprayed. His stomach.
    His hearing aid. His cuffs. His gristle. His sponge. His batteries. His hardship.
    His chutney. His paths. His windows. His calcium. His rudders. His vinegar. His
    seeds. His nettles. His sores. His stool. His plastic. His incandescence. Autumn.
    Shipwreck. Curtains. Exile. Frost. Balconies. Pandaemonium. Hedgerows. Banisters.
    Carpets. Hinges. Remembrance. Hair. Custard. Dribble. Fanfares. Dampness. Bauxite.
    Trousers. Canals. Boskage. Lasciviousness. Tunics. Spigots. Iron. Cranks. Floozies.
    Doppelgangers. Tin. Bales. Agony. Loss. Lust. Love. Crack. Bang. Crunlop. Lars
    Talc is dead.'
