  text: '"Peering at you from the top of a dark pine tree with its staring yellow
    eye, the grackle is certainly uncanny. There, very early in the spring, you may
    hear its cracked and wheezy whistle, for, being aware that however much it may
    look like a crow it belongs to another family, it makes a ridiculous attempt to
    sing. When a number of grackles lift up their voices at once, some one has aptly
    likened the result to a ''good wheel-barrow chorus!'' The grackle''s mate alone
    appreciates his efforts as, standing on tiptoe, with half-spread wings and tail,
    he pours forth his craven soul to her through a disjointed larynx. With all their
    faults, and they are numerous, let it be recorded of both crows and grackles that
    they are as devoted lovers as turtle-doves."
