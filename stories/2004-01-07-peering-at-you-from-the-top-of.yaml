  text: "\u201CPeering at you from the top of a dark pine tree with its staring yellow\
    \ eye, the grackle is certainly uncanny. There, very early in the spring, you\
    \ may hear its cracked and wheezy whistle, for, being aware that however much\
    \ it may look like a crow it belongs to another family, it makes a ridiculous\
    \ attempt to sing. When a number of grackles lift up their voices at once, some\
    \ one has aptly likened the result to a \u2018good wheel-barrow chorus!\u2019\
    \ The grackle's mate alone appreciates his efforts as, standing on tiptoe, with\
    \ half-spread wings and tail, he pours forth his craven soul to her through a\
    \ disjointed larynx. With all their faults, and they are numerous, let it be recorded\
    \ of both crows and grackles that they are as devoted lovers as turtle-doves.\u201D\
