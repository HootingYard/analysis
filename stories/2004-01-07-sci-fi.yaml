  text: "Rummaging through the latest acquisitions in the secondhand books section\
    \ of my local charity shop, I noticed that someone had donated a large number\
    \ of sci-fi paperbacks, including quite a collection of E.E. \u201CDoc\u201D Smith.\
    \ I'm not much of a science fiction buff myself\u2014I didn't buy any of them\u2014\
    but I was reminded how rare it is for an author to be published under what is\
    \ basically a nickname. This ought to be encouraged: double initial, abrupt three-letter\
    \ nickname, surname. So I look forward to new editions of the work of M.M. \u201C\
    Nap\u201D Proust, S.S. \u201CGod\u201D Beckett, even M.M. \u201CGit\u201D Amis.\
    \ Readers are invited\u2014even cajoled\u2014to send in their own suggestions.\n\
    While we are on the subject of sci-fi, sort of, it is worth mentioning Hugo Gernsback,\
    \ the man after whom the Hugo awards were named. Long, long ago, the science fiction\
    \ critic Dave Langford wrote a piece about my work, Key Reading,* in which at\
    \ one point he compared me to the bastard offspring of Samuel Beckett and Hugo\
    \ Gernsback. At the time, I had not read any Gernsback\u2014indeed, I am afraid\
    \ to say I had never even heard of him: I had to ask Dave for information. The\
    \ years went by and still I never read anything by the man. Now, at last, I have\
    \ done so. Towards the end of 2003 I found a copy of Ultimate World. What can\
    \ I say? Here is a brief extract from chapter one:\nIt was 2330 when Dubois and\
    \ his wife went to bed that night. Reclining on their auto bedprop, they were\
    \ watching the late Color Picture News as it flashed on the large bedroom mirror,\
    \ when without warning, the dateline, June 24 1996, the picture, sound and news\
    \ all disappeared together. Simultaneously, a small tornado roared into the bedroom\
    \ from the open west and south windows. The flimsy nightgown of Duke's wife was\
    \ neatly ripped off her and disappeared through the west window, leaving her completely\
    \ nude. Duke, wearing the latest style one-piece abrijama fared better-at least\
    \ he stayed dressed. He immediately noted that his normal weight of 180 pounds\
    \ had almost vanished and that the tornado-like wind was not the reason. He and\
    \ Donny held on desperately to the top of the bed while all sorts of light household\
    \ objects sailed past them, some of them colliding painfully with their bodies.\
    \ Donny's array of perfume bottles seemed to explode as the glass stoppers, popping\
    \ like champagne corks in the rarefied air, sucked the perfume out in colored,\
    \ miniature comet-tails which disappeared through the window. Duke and Donny had\
    \ a hard time breathing. Their bodies by now were floating horizontally while\
    \ they were still frantically clutching the top of the bed. Donny's screams sounded\
    \ faintly in the tornado's roaring blast, as did Duke's shouted encouragements.\n\
    \u201CThe house must be in a near-weightless, negative gravitational field,\u201D\
    \ he yelled. \u201CI can't weigh more than 20 pounds. There are some 20,000 cubic\
    \ feet of air in the house that normally weighs 1,600 pounds\u2026but now weigh\
    \ only 150 or 160 pounds. Heavy new outside air is being sucked in with a weight\
    \ difference of some 1,400 pounds\u2026That creates the tornado, since lighter\
    \ air is pushed out violently.\u201D\nWhile he spoke, the air suddenly calmed\
    \ down and both Donny and Duke sank gently, like two falling leaves, exhausted\
    \ on their large bed. Duke, always the man of science, suddenly jumped from his\
    \ reclining position, but instantly regretted the move, as his head collided with\
    \ the ceiling. Ruefully rubbing his forehead, he slowly landed on his feet, then\
    \ cautiously made his way to the bathroom.\nWhat genius! What melodrama! What\
    \ technical data!\n* NOTE : The links & postal address details in Dave's article\
    \ are no longer valid."
