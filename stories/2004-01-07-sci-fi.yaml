  text: 'Rummaging through the latest acquisitions in the secondhand books section
    of my local charity shop, I noticed that someone had donated a large number of
    sci-fi paperbacks, including quite a collection of E.E. "Doc" Smith. I''m not
    much of a science fiction buff myself--I didn''t buy any of them--but I was reminded
    how rare it is for an author to be published under what is basically a nickname.
    This ought to be encouraged: double initial, abrupt three-letter nickname, surname.
    So I look forward to new editions of the work of M.M. "Nap" Proust, S.S. "God"
    Beckett, even M.M. "Git" Amis. Readers are invited--even cajoled--to send in their
    own suggestions.

    While we are on the subject of sci-fi, sort of, it is worth mentioning Hugo Gernsback,
    the man after whom the Hugo awards were named. Long, long ago, the science fiction
    critic Dave Langford wrote a piece about my work, Key Reading,* in which at one
    point he compared me to the bastard offspring of Samuel Beckett and Hugo Gernsback.
    At the time, I had not read any Gernsback--indeed, I am afraid to say I had never
    even heard of him: I had to ask Dave for information. The years went by and still
    I never read anything by the man. Now, at last, I have done so. Towards the end
    of 2003 I found a copy of Ultimate World. What can I say? Here is a brief extract
    from chapter one:

    It was 2330 when Dubois and his wife went to bed that night. Reclining on their
    auto bedprop, they were watching the late Color Picture News as it flashed on
    the large bedroom mirror, when without warning, the dateline, June 24 1996, the
    picture, sound and news all disappeared together. Simultaneously, a small tornado
    roared into the bedroom from the open west and south windows. The flimsy nightgown
    of Duke''s wife was neatly ripped off her and disappeared through the west window,
    leaving her completely nude. Duke, wearing the latest style one-piece abrijama
    fared better-at least he stayed dressed. He immediately noted that his normal
    weight of 180 pounds had almost vanished and that the tornado-like wind was not
    the reason. He and Donny held on desperately to the top of the bed while all sorts
    of light household objects sailed past them, some of them colliding painfully
    with their bodies. Donny''s array of perfume bottles seemed to explode as the
    glass stoppers, popping like champagne corks in the rarefied air, sucked the perfume
    out in colored, miniature comet-tails which disappeared through the window. Duke
    and Donny had a hard time breathing. Their bodies by now were floating horizontally
    while they were still frantically clutching the top of the bed. Donny''s screams
    sounded faintly in the tornado''s roaring blast, as did Duke''s shouted encouragements.

    "The house must be in a near-weightless, negative gravitational field," he yelled.
    "I can''t weigh more than 20 pounds. There are some 20,000 cubic feet of air in
    the house that normally weighs 1,600 pounds...but now weigh only 150 or 160 pounds.
    Heavy new outside air is being sucked in with a weight difference of some 1,400
    pounds...That creates the tornado, since lighter air is pushed out violently."

    While he spoke, the air suddenly calmed down and both Donny and Duke sank gently,
    like two falling leaves, exhausted on their large bed. Duke, always the man of
    science, suddenly jumped from his reclining position, but instantly regretted
    the move, as his head collided with the ceiling. Ruefully rubbing his forehead,
    he slowly landed on his feet, then cautiously made his way to the bathroom.

    What genius! What melodrama! What technical data!
