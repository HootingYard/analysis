  text: "Reader Glyn Webster writes to broaden the topic of authorial nicknames (see\
    \ below, 7th January):\nDr. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger. His nickname \u201C\
    The Forest of Incandescent Bliss\u201D was given to him by his godfather, the\
    \ Chinese Nationalist leader Sun Yat Sen; it is a Chinese pun on \u201CPaul Linebarger\u201D\
    . He wrote his sci-fi under the pseudonym \u201CCordwainer Smith\u201D. Disappointingly\
    \ \u201CPaul \u2018Forest of Incandescent Bliss\u2019 Linebarger\u201D never appeared\
    \ on book covers because he had a respectable day job devising pyschological warfare\
    \ techniques for the American army:\n\u201CWhile in Korea, Linebarger masterminded\
    \ the surrender of thousands of Chinese troops who considered it shameful to give\
    \ up their arms. He drafted leaflets explaining how the soldiers could surrender\
    \ by shouting the Chinese words for love, duty, humanity, and virtue\u2014words\
    \ that happened, when pronounced in that order, to sound like I surrender in English.\
    \ He considered this act to be the single most worthwhile thing he had done in\
    \ his life.\u201D\n\u201CThe Forest of Incandescent Bliss\u201D is a marvellous\
    \ nickname, almost on a par with the title adopted by ex-President Mbuto of Zaire,\
    \ who, in the 1970s, dubbed himself \u201CThe All-Powerful Warrior Who Because\
    \ Of Endurance And An Inflexible Will To Win, Will Go From Conquest To Conquest\
    \ Leaving Fire In His Wake\u201D."
