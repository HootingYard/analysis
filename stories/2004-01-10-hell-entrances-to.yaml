  text: Reader Tim Drage has drawn my attention to a hugely informative website which
    provides photographic documentation of Entrances to Hell in the UK. Were I in
    the habit of handing out awards, trophies & cups--other than the Tin Badge of
    Tantarabim or the Button of Beb--I have no doubt this site would win one.
