  text: "Reader Tim Drage has drawn my attention to a hugely informative website which\
    \ provides photographic documentation of Entrances to Hell in the UK. Were I in\
    \ the habit of handing out awards, trophies & cups\u2014other than the Tin Badge\
    \ of Tantarabim or the Button of Beb\u2014I have no doubt this site would win\
    \ one."
