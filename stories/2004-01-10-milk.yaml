  text: 'Sir Atholl Oakley (1900-1987) was a champion wrestler, an impresario of giants,
    organiser of "rugged holiday cruises" and an authority on Lorna Doone. His wrestling
    career began after he was beaten up by a gang of thugs. He built up his physique
    by drinking eleven pints of milk every day, a regimen designed by the giant wrestler
    Hackenschmitt, who later told Oakley that the quantity of milk prescribed was
    "a misprint".
