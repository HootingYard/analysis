    \ organiser of \u201Crugged holiday cruises\u201D and an authority on Lorna Doone.\
    \ His wrestling career began after he was beaten up by a gang of thugs. He built\
    \ up his physique by drinking eleven pints of milk every day, a regimen designed\
    \ by the giant wrestler Hackenschmitt, who later told Oakley that the quantity\
    \ of milk prescribed was \u201Ca misprint\u201D.\nSource : The Daily Telegraph\
