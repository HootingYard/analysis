  text: '...the wind in the willows, the wind in the windows, the will in the windows,
    the wills in the window, Goop, the executor, saw that the will had been lodged
    in the casement window, it was hidden behind the curtain, although he was not
    certain, the will in the window, the lady in the lake, the lake like the lady,
    the lake in the la di da, the break in the lake, the Beak Keepsake, for a keepsake,
    in her locket, the lady in the lake kept a beak, the beak of a bird, the third
    bird, the first bird was a chaffinch, the second was a vulture, the third bird
    was dead, its beak had been detached and she kept it as a keepsake in her locket
    in her pocket, the quick and the dead, the dead and the sick, the sick and the
    sad, the sick man was sad, he wrote his will, he plighted his troth, he was as
    sick as a dog, he was sick in the trough, the tooth of the truth, those shoes
    of his, his shoes, the truth of boots and shoes, a boot is a shoe, the beauty
    of boots, the mutiny on the Bounty, a bountiful feast, the test of the best, deceit
    is a crime, the crime of the tooth, the truth of the crime, in Much Hadham, is
    that true? I''ve not checked, the check and the stripe, the striped and the hooped,
    the patterned and plain, the brain drain, the drain at the kerb, the kerb of the
    path, the path of life, the death of earth, the dearth of crime, the crime of
    passion, the scarlet pimpernel, the pimpled and sick, the sickness unto death,
    rude health, untold wealth, pelf, filthy lucre, Lord Lucan, the Charge of the
    Light Brigade, the raid of the brigade, the raid was made, the maid was late,
    the tale was told, as bold as brass, the caste system, a Shropshire Lad, baize,
    the toll of bells, the bells of hell, Beelzebub''s bells, that swelling brogue,
    that broken shell, a-wassailing we will go...'
