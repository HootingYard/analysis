  text: According to Alexandre Dumas in his Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine, "the young
    wild duck shot at the end of August is called an albran. Albrans, which are to
    an ordinary duck as a partridge is to a hen, are broiled on the spit and served
    on toast soaked in their own juices, to which are added the juice of bitter oranges,
    a little soy sauce, and some grains of fine pepper". That being the case, what
    exactly is contained in those packets of All-Bran sold by the Kellogg people?
    I think we should be told.
