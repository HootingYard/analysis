  text: "According to Alexandre Dumas in his Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine, \u201C\
    the young wild duck shot at the end of August is called an albran. Albrans, which\
    \ are to an ordinary duck as a partridge is to a hen, are broiled on the spit\
    \ and served on toast soaked in their own juices, to which are added the juice\
    \ of bitter oranges, a little soy sauce, and some grains of fine pepper\u201D\
    . That being the case, what exactly is contained in those packets of All-Bran\
    \ sold by the Kellogg people? I think we should be told."
