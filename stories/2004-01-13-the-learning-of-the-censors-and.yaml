    \ They condemned a recondite treatise on Trigonometry, because they imagined it\
    \ contained heretical opinions concerning the doctrine of the Trinity; and another\
    \ work which was devoted to the study of Insects was prohibited, because they\
    \ concluded that it was a secret attack upon the Jesuits.\u201D\nP. H. Ditchfield,\
