  text: '"The learning ... of the censors and critics was often indeed remarkable.
    They condemned a recondite treatise on Trigonometry, because they imagined it
    contained heretical opinions concerning the doctrine of the Trinity; and another
    work which was devoted to the study of Insects was prohibited, because they concluded
    that it was a secret attack upon the Jesuits."
