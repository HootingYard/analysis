  text: 'by Frank Key

    The first pond is called POSTAGE STAMP POND not, as one might think, due to its
    tininess--for it is indeed a tiny pond!--but because it was the scene of the 1898
    Postage Stamp Riots. You will recall from your schoolbooks that the introduction
    of a new machine at the sorting office led to unrest.

    The second pond is named MEE JAWR POND which is thought to be a corruption of
    the name Midge Ure. Mr Ure was a balladeer & minstrel of the last century, now
    largely forgotten, although there exists a dwindling band of devotees who gather
    together underneath railway bridges and viaducts to sing extempore versions of
    his profound meditation upon vapidity, Vienna--it means nothing to me. Appropriately
    enough, this pond is unfathomably deep.

    The third pond, everybody''s favourite, is called POND O'' CAKES. It was in this
    pond, on a teeming day in April in the year of the Munich Air Disaster, that a
    canister of protoplasmic goo from another dimension was found in the fishing-net
    of a little tike named Chevenix Perkins. Young Perkins was the only-begotten son
    of the disgraced insecticide merchant Slawkenbergius Perkins, late, not of this
    parish, but of another parish entirely, where eldritch groans and wailings would
    often be heard emerging from dilapidated barnyards and abandoned bomb shelters,
    the like of which--the groans and wailings, that is--no human ear ought ever be
    suffered to hear in this brief mortal existence. (That sentence is a translation
    from the original Hungarian.) Little Chevenix gave his find to the Museum At-or-Near-the-Gruesome-Copse
    at Ack, from where it has since disappeared.

    Pond number four was for a long time nameless, but has recently been dubbed BIRDS''
    POND because of the masonry pillar just to the north, on which is inscribed this
    sentence from John Burroughs'' Birds And Poets (1877) : "The defiant scream of
    the hawk circling aloft, the wild whinny of the loon, the whooping of the crane,
    the booming of the bittern, the vulpine bark of the eagle, the loud trumpeting
    of the migratory geese sounding down out of the midnight sky; or by the seashore,
    the coast of New Jersey or Long Island, the wild crooning of the flocks of gulls,
    repeated, continued by the hour, swirling sharp and shrill, rising and falling
    like the wind in a storm, as they circle above the beach or dip to the dash of
    the waves,--are much more welcome in certain moods than any and all mere bird-melodies,
    in keeping as they are with the shaggy and untamed features of ocean and woods,
    and suggesting something like the Richard Wagner music in the ornithological orchestra."

    The fifth pond, WORSE-THINGS-HAPPEN-AT-SEA POND is barely what you would call
    a pond at all. It has been called a puddle. Some have dubbed it a mere. One authority
    on landlocked pools of water has called it a tarn, albeit inaccurately, as it
    is at (or at least near) sea level. It would appear that the appellation "authority"
    is thus equally inaccurate, although few have questioned it, as the pond-boffin
    concerned is none other than Cloris Preen, niece of the notorious Lothar, and
    ex-wife of the beetle-browed turps magnate Hengist Shad. Cloris Preen''s Universal
    Gazetteer of Ponds, Meres & Similar Bodies of Water Across The Globe, Indexed
    By Depth, Hue & Mean Temperature, With Thousands of Diagrams & Lots & Lots of
    Exciting Maps is reputedly the longest single-volume book ever published, although
    most scholars hold it in contempt. Worse-Things-Happen-At-Sea Pond is notable
    for the weird iridescent glow it emits on certain saints'' feast days, usually
    those of St Bartholomew (24th August), often invoked against nervous diseases
    and twitching, St Ambrose (7th December), patron saint of beekeepers and wax refiners,
    and St Rita of Cascia (22nd May) patron saint of desperate cases. Should Cloris
    Preen be classed as a desperate case?

    We come now to FIENDISH POND, home to a bewildering array of aquatic life forms
    which I am afraid I have not had time to catalogue. Some of them look like monsters
    from H P Lovecraft--and those are the less frightening ones! Terrorised infants
    can often be seen running away screaming from this pond, only to become entangled
    in a nearby thicket of nettles and bindweed, the poor mites.

    Shuddering, let us attempt to push the tentacled and sucker-festooned denizens
    of Fiendish Pond to the backs of our minds and consider instead MARY MOONMAN POND,
    named after one of the key witnesses to the assassination of John F Kennedy on
    22nd November 1963. Her name is (was?) in fact Mary Moorman, but the blond, swashbuckling
    ne''er-do-well who painted the signboard affixed to a wooden post stuck in the
    mud to the southwest of the pond was hard of hearing, and his error has never
    been corrected. In any case, Mary Moorman, or Moonman, ought better be known as
    Marymoon Man, thus more appropriately named alongside her fellow witnesses Badge
    Man, Umbrella Man, Black Dog Man, and far too many more Men than we have space
    for here. This seems as good a time as any to throw in the little-known fact that
    alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was interred under the name William Bobo.

    From Mary Moonman Pond, strike east, tread carefully around the Place of Strewn
    Grotesque Pebbles, and you will find yourself within spitting distance of PARACELSUS
    POND named, of course, for the 16th century alchemist Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus
    Bombastus von Hohenheim, the man whom all abecedarians hold in high honour, as
    among his coinages were both alcohol and zinc. Of more concern to us here is the
    way in which faint yet compelling links and patterns can be traced across the
    centuries. Mention has already been made of the turps tycoon Hengist Shad, whose
    fortune was based on the oleoresins exuded from coniferous trees consisting of
    more or less viscid solutions of resin in a volatile oil, and lo! we find that
    the very same turpentine was an essential constituent of Paracelsus'' celebrated
    weapon-salve, the recipe for which was as follows: Take of moss growing on the
    head of a thief who has been hanged and left in the air; of real mummy; of human
    blood, still warm--of each, one ounce; of human suet, two ounces; of linseed oil,
    turpentine, and Armenian bole -of each, two drachms. Mix all well in a mortar,
    and keep the salve in an oblong, narrow urn. [My emphasis.] The supposed linkage
    may seem tenuous, if it were not for the fact that the very next pond we stumble
    upon is called..

    HUMAN SUET POND. Reads like an anagram, doesn''t it? And indeed it is, for this
    is an artificial pond--obvious from its perfectly ellipsoid shape--which was dug
    in 1962 by one Thomas Pundune (anag.) to mark the publication of Richard Milhous
    Nixon''s book Six Crises. Careful study of the pond reveals half a dozen partly
    submerged plastic baubles, each of which is designed to represent one of the then
    future president''s half-dozen formative events, the most exciting of which--I
    refer to both bauble and crisis--is the "goodwill" tour of South America in 1958,
    when Nixon and his wife, the saintly Pat, were attacked and nearly killed by pro-Communist
    mobs in Venezuela. Pundune was a great admirer of the only Quaker ever to order
    the bombing of Cambodia, although he underwent his own "crisis" in 1971--the details
    are blurry, but it had something to do with a yeast infection--disavowed Nixon,
    pond and baubles, and retired to a Bewilderment Home on a bleak hillside. He may
    still be there, haunted, ancient and drooling, for all I know. But his pond remains
    a very lovely thing, and has always been popular with the picnicking element.

    Next on our fascinating tour is Pangfabuloquislinguette Pond, known colloquially
    as MUCH-DRAGGED POND as it has the distinction of being the most frequently dragged
    pond in the land. The police forces of this bailiwick--and there are at least
    seven different so-called Law Platoons who claim it as their own--all have a perplexing
    mania for sending frogmen equipped with forensically-approved nets into the pond
    at the least opportunity. Sometimes they do not even wait for a crime to be committed.
    Scarcely a week goes by without a nylon fence being erected around this splendid
    pond, a team of yellow-jacketed walkie-talkie-wielding myrmidons materialising
    out of the blue, and then a series of faint splashes as the dashing frogmen set
    about their task. Their trawls have even been productive, on occasion. The grim--or
    perhaps grimy--poisoner Gervase Tanquod was convicted on the basis of a phial
    of smee riddled with his fingerprints which he had tossed into the pond while
    pursued by bloodhounds. It proved to be the only evidence against him, yet it
    was--as the trial judge put it--"the hinge on which the case swings". (This judge,
    incidentally, was fond of ironmongery metaphors in his summings-up, and regularly
    invoked hinges, lever handles, snap hooks, latches, sealing lugs, padlocks, mobile
    aeration screens, safety chains, chink devices, transom window gears, espagnolette
    bolts, bevels, sash pulleys, pressed brackets and even fire tongs to illuminate
    his never less than draconian judgements.) Tanquod he sent to the jug for forty
    years, which amounted to a death sentence, as the fiend was already in his eighties
    when he was at last apprehended. Much-Dragged Pond has also been noteworthy as
    a popular location for film-makers, no doubt because as morning mists hang over
    its still surface (on those rare days it is not being dragged) it has a magical
    atmosphere, like one imagines Avalon, say, or Narnia, or the Blister Lane Bypass.
    Note too the solitary heron standing vigil at the edge of the pond.

    Of CLYTEMNESTRA! POND we need say nothing.

    VON PIGFLASK POND is named for Horst Helmut Von Pigflask, the noted percussionist,
    who created his own sonic universe using just a couple of biscuit tins, a thermos
    flask half-full of milk, and a few odds and ends scavenged from a rusting ship.
    "The milk," he famously declared, "must be sour, at least four days sour, or it
    has no ton, no timbre." At one time an habitue of the same Marseilles dockyard
    drinking dens as that scallywag Lothar Preen, Von Pigflask had a huge falling-out
    with his mentor on 12th October 1959. Despite both protagonists keeping voluminous--if
    not to say obsessive--diaries, neither of them has a word to say about this incident.
    Preen''s journal entry for the day is the usual vain, self-serving hyperbole,
    while Von Pigflask writes a long list of farm implements annotated with pencil-drawn
    symbols in some indecipherable private code. What can it all mean? The sad thing
    is that no one, then or now, ever really cared. On the following day, Von Pigflask
    hired a dinghy from one of his disreputable acquaintances, put out to sea, and
    vanished. Perhaps because his police files had been mislaid, his absence went
    unremarked; certainly there is no trace of him whatsoever until at some point
    in the late 1960s when reports began to circulate that he was a founder member
    of the blues-rock pioneers Blodwyn Pig. To this day the other original members,
    Mick Abrahams, Jack Lancaster, Andy Pyle and Ron Berg deny ever having heard of
    the great percussionist, let alone giving him free rein with his tins, flask and
    rusty flotsam on their debut album Ahead Rings Out. There is no doubt, however,
    that it was Von Pigflask himself who appeared unannounced on stage at the 1974
    Jazz Festival in Ulm, where he performed a 16-second untitled improvisation before
    scuttling away into the tenebrous German twilight. Two more years passed before
    his triumphant return to the world stage, the patching up of differences with
    Preen, and the ear-splitting genius of his late work. In 1996, by now aged and
    suffering increasingly from the bindings, he retired and settled in Winnipeg.
    His final years were spent on the upper floors of a gleaming skyscraper, where
    he took great pleasure in his pet tortoise and worked for hours every day on a
    seemingly endless list of anagrams of Pol Pot, Ayn Rand, U Thant and Yoko Ono.

    STAGNANT INKY-BLACK FATHOMLESS SPOOKY POND is the thirteenth and final pond in
    this survey. How ill-named it is! Tiny ones may well flee screaming from Fiendish
    Pond, as we have seen, but not from here. On the contrary; it is not uncommon
    for beadles and matrons from the Parish Home for Poor Wretched Mud-Splattered
    Orphans to bring their charges here for an afternoon of gambol and frolic. O how
    the air rings with the joyous cries of the tots as they play pin-the-paper-to-the-cardboard,
    sitting at the edge of the pond with their grubby little feet splashing in the
    water! How they gobble down their small tin bowls of custard and watercress with
    toothsome relish! If you, as an adult, dear reader, need to have your heart''s
    cockles warmed, why not join one of the regular charabanc excursions which leave
    from Haemoglobin Towers at noon every Thursday, and witness this scene for yourself?
    The cost is reasonable--not "criminally expensive" as one curmudgeon wrote in
    a letter to the Hooting Yard Bee--and if you bring your own packed lunch you can
    even join in the antics! Pray heaven that you do not give credence to that other
    Bee correspondent who wrote a farrago of nonsense about getting bats entangled
    in his hair! Nor ought you listen to malicious gossip about the pond being riddled
    with vivid blue poisonous toads. A brisk walk around the pond will soon diffuse
    the diesel fumes from the charabanc, and you will no longer have a headache.'
