  text: And there was a man named Gervase Birdlip resident at that time in Uttoxeter.
    He hailed originally from Helsinki, where his parents used to polish shields with
    old rags. Birdlip had lived for many years lived in a caravan on the outskirts
    of Helsinki. It was a dilapidated caravan. Nobody knew why he had moved to Uttoxeter.
    Nobody knew whether or not his papers were in order. Nobody knew for how many
    years he had been alive on this terrifying and miraculous planet. Nobody knew
    why his teapot leaked. Nobody knew why his left shoulderblade was emblazoned with
    a magnificent tattoo of a cormorant. Nobody knew why his gas bills were so preposterous.
    Nobody knew that he was ashamed of his club foot. Nobody knew that he skulked
    about in the orchard. Nobody knew what he kept in that mysterious iron pail. Nobody
    knew the angle of his hat. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. It is a sad story.
