  text: "\u201CWhen a cow came slouching by in the field next to me, a mere artist\
    \ might have drawn it; but I always get wrong in the hind legs of quadrupeds.\
    \ So I drew the soul of the cow; which I saw there plainly walking before me in\
    \ the sunlight; and the soul was all purple and silver, and had seven horns and\
    \ the mystery that belongs to all the beasts.\u201D \u2014G. K. Chesterton"
