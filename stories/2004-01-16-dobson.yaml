  text: "Dobson the pamphleteer, that is, rather than Dobson the playwright (see 22nd\
    \ December and 1st January). Plans have been announced for a new series of \u201C\
    self-help\u201D titles, which Dobson has apparently been working on with some\
    \ gusto. They include: Teach Yourself Petulance; Mucking About For Fun & Profit;\
    \ Idiot's Guide To Moral Turpitude; Fecklessness Made Simple; Learn To Doze In\
    \ Just 24 Hours!; How To Be In A Bad Mood; Lassitude The Easy Way; Making A Fool\
    \ of Yourself for Dummies; Idiot's Guide To Social Gaffes; Bluff Your Way to Pomposity;\
    \ Five Simple Steps To Lying Around Aimlessly; Tomfoolery Made Simple; Teach Yourself\
    \ Frowning; Make Your Own Faux Pas; and The Seven Habits of Craven & Wretched\
    \ People."
