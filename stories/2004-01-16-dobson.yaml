  text: 'Dobson the pamphleteer, that is, rather than Dobson the playwright (see 22nd
    December and 1st January). Plans have been announced for a new series of "self-help"
    titles, which Dobson has apparently been working on with some gusto. They include:
    Teach Yourself Petulance; Mucking About For Fun & Profit; Idiot''s Guide To Moral
    Turpitude; Fecklessness Made Simple; Learn To Doze In Just 24 Hours!; How To Be
    In A Bad Mood; Lassitude The Easy Way; Making A Fool of Yourself for Dummies;
    Idiot''s Guide To Social Gaffes; Bluff Your Way to Pomposity; Five Simple Steps
    To Lying Around Aimlessly; Tomfoolery Made Simple; Teach Yourself Frowning; Make
    Your Own Faux Pas; and The Seven Habits of Craven & Wretched People.'
