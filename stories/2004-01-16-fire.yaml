    The origin of fires is now so narrowly inquired into by the officers of the Brigade,\
    \ by means of inquests, that we have been made acquainted with a vast number of\
    \ curious causes, which would never have been suspected. From an analysis of fires\
    \ which have occurred since the establishment of the Brigade, we have constructed\
    \ the following [list]:\nCurtains 2,511\u2014Candle 1,178\u2014Flues 1,555\u2014\
