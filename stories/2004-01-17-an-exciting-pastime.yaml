  text: 'Frederica Seeger''s Entertainments For Home, Church & School (1910) is packed
    with unbearably exciting diversions. Here, for example, is "Lighting The Candle"
    :

    This feat is a very amusing one, and is performed as follows: Two persons kneel
    on the ground, facing each other. Each holds in his left hand a candle in a candlestick,
    at the same time grasping his right foot in his right hand. This position compels
    him to balance himself on his left knee. One of the candles is lighted; the other
    is not. The holders are required to light the unlighted candle from the lighted
    one. The conditions are simple enough, but one would hardly believe how often
    the performers will roll over on the floor before they succeed in lighting the
    candle. It will be found desirable to spread a newspaper on the floor between
    the combatants. Many spots of candle-grease will thus be intercepted, and the
    peace of mind of the lady of the house proportionately spared.'
