  text: "Frederica Seeger's Entertainments For Home, Church & School (1910) is packed\
    \ with unbearably exciting diversions. Here, for example, is \u201CLighting The\
    \ Candle\u201D :\nThis feat is a very amusing one, and is performed as follows:\
    \ Two persons kneel on the ground, facing each other. Each holds in his left hand\
    \ a candle in a candlestick, at the same time grasping his right foot in his right\
    \ hand. This position compels him to balance himself on his left knee. One of\
    \ the candles is lighted; the other is not. The holders are required to light\
    \ the unlighted candle from the lighted one. The conditions are simple enough,\
    \ but one would hardly believe how often the performers will roll over on the\
    \ floor before they succeed in lighting the candle. It will be found desirable\
    \ to spread a newspaper on the floor between the combatants. Many spots of candle-grease\
    \ will thus be intercepted, and the peace of mind of the lady of the house proportionately\
    \ spared."
