  text: "Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, I know the misery of being inconvenienced by\
    \ a person from Porlock. It happened thus. It was a Wednesday, I recall, teeming\
    \ with Hooting Yard's most tremendous rainfall for forty years. I was sat at the\
    \ kitchen table attempting to insert a new pair of laces into my gleaming big\
    \ black leather boots. Minnie was at her spinet, as usual, idly tinkling. I suspected\
    \ that soon the tinkling would cease and she would launch into an impassioned\
    \ performance of one of her ten thousand and twenty two songs. I hoped she would\
    \ play my favourite, the Anthem for a Brutish Haberdasher, or perhaps her mangled\
    \ sea shanty Bring Me Your Winding Sheet, O Mother of Mine. As I fiddled ineptly\
    \ with the laces, our door crashed open and a hirsute and drenched individual\
    \ burst into the room. In an instant, a puddle formed at his feet. Minnie continued\
    \ to tinkle.\n\u201CI come,\u201D announced the stranger, in a declamatory roar\
    \ as if he were addressing a vast crowd of huddled petitioners, \u201CI come not\
    \ from haunts of coot and hern. Nor do I come in response to your whistle, my\
    \ lad.\u201D\n\u201CI was not whistling,\u201D I replied.\n\u201CPrecisely!\u201D\
    \ he continued, \u201CI come from Porlock, and I am going to confiscate your aglets.\u201D\
    \nSo saying, he withdrew from the pocket of his bright yellow windcheater a pair\
    \ of garden secateurs, swiftly cut the aglets off the ends of my brand new laces,\
    \ and charged out into the downpour. He did not close the door behind him. I held\
    \ my head in my hands and began to weep. Minnie played the pounding opening chords\
    \ of Dismal Corncrakes."
