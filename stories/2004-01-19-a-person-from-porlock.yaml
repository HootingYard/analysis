  text: 'Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, I know the misery of being inconvenienced by
    a person from Porlock. It happened thus. It was a Wednesday, I recall, teeming
    with Hooting Yard''s most tremendous rainfall for forty years. I was sat at the
    kitchen table attempting to insert a new pair of laces into my gleaming big black
    leather boots. Minnie was at her spinet, as usual, idly tinkling. I suspected
    that soon the tinkling would cease and she would launch into an impassioned performance
    of one of her ten thousand and twenty two songs. I hoped she would play my favourite,
    the Anthem for a Brutish Haberdasher, or perhaps her mangled sea shanty Bring
    Me Your Winding Sheet, O Mother of Mine. As I fiddled ineptly with the laces,
    our door crashed open and a hirsute and drenched individual burst into the room.
    In an instant, a puddle formed at his feet. Minnie continued to tinkle.

    "I come," announced the stranger, in a declamatory roar as if he were addressing
    a vast crowd of huddled petitioners, "I come not from haunts of coot and hern.
    Nor do I come in response to your whistle, my lad."

    "I was not whistling," I replied.

    "Precisely!" he continued, "I come from Porlock, and I am going to confiscate
    your aglets."

    So saying, he withdrew from the pocket of his bright yellow windcheater a pair
    of garden secateurs, swiftly cut the aglets off the ends of my brand new laces,
    and charged out into the downpour. He did not close the door behind him. I held
    my head in my hands and began to weep. Minnie played the pounding opening chords
    of Dismal Corncrakes.'
