  text: "When he wasn't inventing the computer, Charles Babbage spent much of his\
    \ time getting het up about what he called \u201Cstreet disturbances\u201D. These\
    \ seem to have consisted almost entirely of what most people call \u201Cmusic\u201D\
    . He wrote a helpful list of \u201Cinstruments of torture permitted by the Government\
    \ to be in daily and nightly use in the streets of London\u201D:\nOrgans, Bagpipes,\
    \ Brass bands, Accordians, Fiddlers, Halfpenny whistles, Harps, Tom-toms, Harpsichords,\
    \ Trumpets, Hurdy-gurdies, Shouting out objects for sale, Flageolets, Religious\
    \ canting, Drums, Psalm-singing.\nAnd apart from the Government, responsible for\
    \ allowing this mayhem, Babbage knew who to blame: \u201CTavern-keepers, Public-houses,\
    \ Girl-shops, Beer-shops, Coffee-shops, Servants, Children, Visitors from the\
    \ country, Ladies of doubtful virtue, Occasionally titled ladies; but these are\
    \ almost invariably of recent elevation, and deficient in that taste which their\
    \ sex usually possess\u201D.\nWould Babbage have approved of mp3s? Discuss."
