  text: That wretched man Ben Elton has carved a career for himself writing appalling
    musicals, picking over rock music's back catalogues like a vulture over carrion--We
    Will Rock You based on Queen, Tonight's The Night on Rod Stewart, and so, gruesomely,
    on. Before London's theatreland chokes on this lethal diet, a corrective is clearly
    needed. Work needs to begin on Bittern Storm Over Ulm, Pin Back Your Ears! and
    Perfume Bottle Atomiser Air Bulb Invention, doing for Henry Cow, Charles Ives
    and Captain Beefheart & The Magic Band what Elton has done for Mercury & co and
    Stewart.
