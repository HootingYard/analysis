  text: 'A while ago I found a truly majestic publication in a secondhand bookshop
    on Charing Cross Road. It''s a 76 page A6 booklet, spineless, with a yellow card
    cover, entitled Further Science--Book 20, written and published by Norman Davies
    in 2001. Infuriatingly, there is neither a jot nor tittle of further information--no
    address, contact details, or anything. The contents include topics such as: Hedge
    Auras; Dragonflies; World Monkeys; Near Death; World Flag Psychology; and National
    Bill Hooks. If anyone knows anything more about Norman Davies, or how I could
    obtain Further Science Books 1 to 19 (and 21 onwards?) please contact me immediately!

    As I have no way of asking Mr Davies'' permission to reproduce his work, I pondered
    not doing so; but my resolve was broken. Here, then, is an extract. It is entitled
    "Ancestral Birds" (sic throughout):'
