  text: "A while ago I found a truly majestic publication in a secondhand bookshop\
    \ on Charing Cross Road. It's a 76 page A6 booklet, spineless, with a yellow card\
    \ cover, entitled Further Science\u2014Book 20, written and published by Norman\
    \ Davies in 2001. Infuriatingly, there is neither a jot nor tittle of further\
    \ information\u2014no address, contact details, or anything. The contents include\
    \ topics such as: Hedge Auras; Dragonflies; World Monkeys; Near Death; World Flag\
    \ Psychology; and National Bill Hooks. If anyone knows anything more about Norman\
    \ Davies, or how I could obtain Further Science Books 1 to 19 (and 21 onwards?)\
    \ please contact me immediately!\nAs I have no way of asking Mr Davies' permission\
    \ to reproduce his work, I pondered not doing so; but my resolve was broken. Here,\
    \ then, is an extract. It is entitled \u201CAncestral Birds\u201D (sic throughout):"
