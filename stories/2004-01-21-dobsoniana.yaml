  text: 'News has reached us that Dobson, that indefatigable and infamous pamphleteer,
    is at work on his autobiography. Telephone calls, faxes and emails requesting
    further details went unanswered, so we sent the Tatterdemalion Hobbledehoy to
    ransack Dobson''s shed under the cover of a pitch black night when no stars were
    visible a-twinkling in the firmament. He managed to retrieve these four perplexing
    excerpts:

    My mother''s brooch was blue. She took me to the lake and punched my jaw. She
    threw my breakfast into a pond. I banged my head against a barge the day she showed
    me the canal.

    There were massive shutters in that room, and I had never left it. Ah, I had brilliantine
    in my hair. There were roses, there were lockets, I was lacking something, so
    unnerved--but for my hatred she''d''ve seen it, even eaten it, got it on her eyelash,
    crushed it, broken it, eked it out of someone''s purse or loved it, lusted after
    it. So here''s my signifier--you can read it, you can keep it. You''re so fucking
    thick you don''t even know what to do with it. Well ... eyebrows, hair, my pastels,
    then breakfast and a lover. Oh come on, you must be guessing. Or maybe you''re
    just so fetching. I''m done with fleshing out my lying. My hair is in a tangle
    and I haven''t paid the rent. But I had brilliantine in my hair, and yours were
    better shutters. Damn it, I couldn''t even see your rubbish, but I had brilliantine
    in my hair.

    When I stood at the edge of the lake, when I stood on the bridge, when I looked
    at the water, when I saw the broken fountain, when I broke my neck, when I lay
    awake all night, when I couldn''t see a thing, when my mind began to snap, when
    I was spoon-fed cocoa, when what I said went askew, when they proffered me jam,
    when my tongue was hanging out, when I loitered in Ulm, when the diving-board
    cracked beneath me, when I fell into a pond, when I was all washed up, when I
    ate too much chocolate, when nothing broke my spirit, when I hosted a TV chat-show,
    when I went to a wedding, when I broke down in tears, when I was in despair, when
    bracken snagged my socks, when illness cast a shadow, when death appeared lascivious,
    when sadness crushed my feelings, when I was struck by lightning, when all I did
    was worry, when I threw in the towel, when I was scorched in deserts, when no
    one gave me biscuits, when all I had was breathing, when my gas bill sent me bonkers,
    when you told me that I''d had it, all I wanted was [illegible]

    When the tiny Mexican house on stilts was revealed, behind such rich brocade curtains,
    and we fell in love, Captain Snap''s wooden leg was rammed between us. He was
    a brutish man, vengeful, hirsute and lewd, prone to piss in vinegar jars and to
    take our clocks to bits. I remember how he left the parts--dial, hands, cogs and
    springs--littered about our flat, smeared with marmalade, peppered with talc,
    and reeking of his dubbin. We walked on either side of him, mouthing words of
    ire and loathing, as he limped--stump-clunk, stump-clunk, stump-clunk--by the
    wharf, jabbering and shouting. Oh, he never made any sense. Captain Snap''s wooden
    leg was rammed between us. I took a hunting rifle and shot him through the head.Then
    we were together, darling, and he was good and dead.'
