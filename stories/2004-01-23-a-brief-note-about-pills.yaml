  text: "Please do not confuse toad-pills--those \"tiny pink miracles of batrachian\
    \ well-being\" as Dobson called them in his engaging pamphlet How I Counted All\
    \ The Toads In Scandinavi (out of print)--with other sorts of pills, not least\
    \ those of Lockyer, whose tomb in Southwark Cathedral commemorates his genius:\n\
    Here Lockyer lies interr'd, enough : his name\n      Speaks one hath few competitors\
    \ in fame ;\n      A Name soe Great soe Generall'e may scorne\n      Inscriptions\
    \ wh doe vulgar tombs adorne :\n      A diminution to write in verse\n      His\
    \ eulogies wh most men's mouths rehearse.\n      His virtues and his PILLS are\
    \ so well known,\n      That envy can't confine them under stone.\n      But they'll\
    \ survive his dust and not expire\n      Till all things else at th'universall\
    \ fire.\n      This verse is lost, his PILL Embalmes him safe\n      To future\
    \ times without an Epitaph :\nRepair'd Octobr 1741\n      Deceast Aprill ye 26th\
