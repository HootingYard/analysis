  text: 'I am Cedric Spraingue, and I have inspected all the lighthouses of Hoon.
    This is my report. On the fourteenth of July, having had my crutches freshly varnished,
    I set out for the Port of Tongs, my knapsack packed with mustard cakes, celery
    stalks, a flask of slops, my notebook and pencil, several pins, a length of string,
    a wristwatch with a frayed strap, and many, many other things which at present
    I cannot divulge.

    I had to wait for three hours at the railway station, during which time I shunned
    the other human beings in the waiting-room, preferring to crouch in an alcove
    to jot down some prepatory notes for my tour of lighthouse inspection. There are
    twenty six lighthouses in Hoon, and rigorous planning would be necessary.

    I had decided to begin with the Port of Tongs lighthouse for three reasons:

    1. It is the lighthouse furthest from my home in Hooting Yard, being precisely
    forty six and a half motes distant. That figure has been verified--as have all
    the motages in my report--by Dobson''s bittern-robot measuring device. Each time
    I note the distance from one site to another, you may imagine this splendid metal
    bird soaring across the sky at unimaginable speed, its beak spewing forth ticker-tape.

    2. It is the oldest of the Hoon lighthouses by a good half-century.

    3. There is a toad hospital on the outskirts of the port, and Lillian, my toad,
    is sick. She has been struck by repeated fits of the chumpots, and I will be able
    to collect supplies of serum, paste, and toad-pills.

    The train journey was remarkably eventful. The guard''s van was struck by lightning.
    A pig wandered onto the track and missed death by seconds. A passenger, florid
    of face and decked out in clerical garb--a Jesuit perhaps--broke his ankle while
    attempting to step over a suitcase abandoned in the corridor. We suffered a temporary
    derailment. The toilets were flooded. Seven or eight handkerchiefs, donated by
    passengers, were needed to stem the ticket collector''s nosebleed. A small child
    frantic with mischief pulled the communication cord, causing a halt of some hours.
    Bacteria released from a mysterious package made all those in the rear carriage
    violently sick. A monomaniac with grubby fingernails walked up and down the length
    of the train declaiming his theories on colourless gases.

    There were other incidents, to be sure, but eventually the train arrived at the
    Port of Tongs. End of preamble.'
