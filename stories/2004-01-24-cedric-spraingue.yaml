  text: Cedric Spraingue, Inspector of Lighthouses (see below, 23rd January), ought
    not be confused with his relative Cedric William Spraingue. Quite why this confusion
    recurs is quite beyond reason and is a source of misery and teeth-gnashing to
    their descendants, the Spraingue kin of Blister Lane, who are the only people
    I know apart from the Kennedy clan to live in a "compound". In a last ditch attempt
    to clear up the matter, short of knocking a few heads together, here is a narrative
    regarding Cedric William. A cursory reading should make quite plain that he was
    not the same man whose lighthouse inspections have become the stuff of legend.
    The text is entitled The Phial of Broth.
