  text: 'To be given a Sop. The full quotation should be "to give a sop to Cerberus".
    Cerberus was Pluto''s three-headed dog set at the gates of the Infernal Regions
    over which Pluto was King. The Greeks and Romans when burying their dead put into
    the hands of the corpse a cake. The idea was that the cake was a sop to Cerberus
    to allow the dead to pass unmolested.
