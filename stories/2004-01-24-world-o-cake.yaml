  text: "To be given a Sop. The full quotation should be \u201Cto give a sop to Cerberus\u201D\
    . Cerberus was Pluto's three-headed dog set at the gates of the Infernal Regions\
    \ over which Pluto was King. The Greeks and Romans when burying their dead put\
    \ into the hands of the corpse a cake. The idea was that the cake was a sop to\
    \ Cerberus to allow the dead to pass unmolested.\nSource : Encyclopaedia of Phrases\
    \ & Origins by Edwin Radford (1945)"
