    YOU WILL NEED:

    Sharp scissors, a ruler, a blunt knife for scoring fold lines, and a suitable
    adhesive.

    INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Print out diagrams one and two [see the end of this chapter] on whatever thickness
    of card is suitable for your printer.

    2. Cut out all the pieces along the solid lines. Be careful to include all the
    tabs on the smaller pieces.

    3. Score along all the dotted lines using a ruler and a blunt knife. This makes
    it much easier to fold the pieces properly.

    4. Make the outside of the house first. Fold the card as shown below, with the
    picture on the outside. Apply glue to the area marked A and stick firmly on the
    inside.


    5. Then take the roof and fold along the three lines marked. Put glue on the areas
    marked B and C and stick firmly on top of the house. Make sure it''s the right
    way up!

    6. Now take the inside piece. Snip carefully along the solid lines into the picture
    as marked. Don''t cut too far! Fold the card as shown below, with the picture
    on the inside. Apply glue to the blank tabs and stick firmly outside the box.


    7. You will notice that there are lots of small free-standing pieces, too many
    for all of them to fit. Choose a few you like best and stick the tabs to the floor,
    walls, or ceiling of the house.

    8. Slide the inner box into the outside and your customised House of Turps is
    complete!
