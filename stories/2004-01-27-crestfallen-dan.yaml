  text: 'Crestfallen Dan lived in a hut on the edge of the inaccurately-named Unending
    Marshes. He had a metal plate in his skull, following a childhood picnic-hamper
    incident. He was mildly lantern-jawed. Whenever he wrote about being lantern-jawed,
    or about lanterns, Crestfallen Dan invariably used the archaic spelling, viz.
    "lanthorn". He often had occasion to write the word because, shunning human company,
    he lived alone and ran a lighting-fixture advice service by post. He spent a fortune
    on postage stamps! Crestfallen Dan did not possess a telephone, but if he had
    done so it would have availed him not, because there was no telephone pole within
    miles upon miles of his nondescript hut. He had only a handful of correspondents,
    or customers, but they were exceedingly loyal to him, for Crestfallen Dan knew
    more about lighting-fixtures than anyone else, ever, alive or dead, and his advice
    was always couched in clear and simple language that even a splinterbrain could
    understand. Crestfallen Dan himself lit his hut with the aid of a single Tilly
    lamp. He was that kind of man.
