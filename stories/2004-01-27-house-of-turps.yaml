  text: Apparently, the House of Turps is somewhere in the vicinity of Pang Hill on
    the way to the duckponds. There is a thrilling story of the same name which may
    appear here at some point, certainly before such time as the earth is a charred
    cinder and the sun dead, as Carl Sagan so eloquently put it. Meanwhile, your doughty
