  text: Apparently, the House of Turps is somewhere in the vicinity of Pang Hill on
    the way to the duckponds. There is a thrilling story of the same name which may
    appear here at some point, certainly before such time as the earth is a charred
    cinder and the sun dead, as Carl Sagan so eloquently put it. Meanwhile, your doughty
    editor is pleased to present you with the chance to Build Your Own House of Turps.
