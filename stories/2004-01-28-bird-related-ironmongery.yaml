  text: 'It is a curious fact that the crowbar is one of the very few tools to be
    named after our avian cousins. Things have come to a pretty pass when our habits
    of nomenclature are so bereft. It is in an attempt to rectify this sorry state
    of affairs that the manufacturing arm of the Hooting Yard Foundation is working
    on the production of an exciting new range of ironmongery products, to wit: guillemot
    bolts; lapwing nozzles; lark basins; coot clips; teal pins; bittern jacks; little
    bittern jacks; snow bunting tacks; flamingo hasps; grebe locks; moorhen horns;
    corncrake hinges; raven sticks; tern rotors; buzzard extractors; and pipit wrenches.'
