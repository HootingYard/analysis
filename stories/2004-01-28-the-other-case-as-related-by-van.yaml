  text: "\u201CThe other case, as related by Van Swieten, in his commentaries upon\
    \ Boerhaave, is that of a learned man, who had studied, till be fancied his legs\
    \ to be of glass: in consequence of which he durst not attempt to stir, but was\
    \ constantly under anxiety about them. His maid bringing one day some wood to\
    \ the fire, threw it carelessly down; and was severely reprimanded by her master,\
    \ who was terrified not a little for his legs of glass. The surly wench, out of\
    \ all patience with his megrims, as she called them, gave him a blow with a log\
    \ upon the parts affected; which so enraged him, that he instantly rose up, and\
    \ from that moment recovered the use of his legs.\u201D \u2014 Anon (\u201CAn\
    \ Oxonian\u201D), Thaumaturgia"
