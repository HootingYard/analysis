  text: '"The other case, as related by Van Swieten, in his commentaries upon Boerhaave,
    is that of a learned man, who had studied, till be fancied his legs to be of glass:
    in consequence of which he durst not attempt to stir, but was constantly under
    anxiety about them. His maid bringing one day some wood to the fire, threw it
    carelessly down; and was severely reprimanded by her master, who was terrified
    not a little for his legs of glass. The surly wench, out of all patience with
    his megrims, as she called them, gave him a blow with a log upon the parts affected;
    which so enraged him, that he instantly rose up, and from that moment recovered
    the use of his legs." -- Anon ("An Oxonian"), Thaumaturgia'
