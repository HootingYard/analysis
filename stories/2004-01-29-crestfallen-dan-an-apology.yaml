  text: 'In an item about Crestfallen Dan published on 27th January (see below), we
    stated that he "lit his hut with the aid of a single Tilly lamp". Dan''s solicitor
    has written to us as follows:

    "My client takes great exception to being accused of lighting his hut with a Tilly
    lamp. This is a vile calumny. You should be aware that Crestfallen Dan is not
    only crestfallen but litigious. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that my practice
    would have fallen into desuetude long ago were it not for his keen sense of injustice.
    I have lost count of the number of luncheons we have had in the convivial surroundings
    of the Cow & Pins tavern, and not a pudding is consumed without my client apprising
    me of yet further besmirchment of his character. Crestfallen Dan''s hut is lit
    by Wotan and Tantalum lamps. Unless a correction to this effect is published on
    your site with all due haste, I will have no alternative but to have you set upon
    by the Men With Whisks & Celery!"

    The Hooting Yard Foundation apologises unreservedly for any distress caused by
    our unfounded Tilly lamp assertion, than which there is no viler calumny, and
    we are pleased to confirm that Crestfallen Dan uses the lamps advertised below.
