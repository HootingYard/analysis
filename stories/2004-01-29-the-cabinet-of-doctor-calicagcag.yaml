  text: "It was a stormy and hideous night. A ferocious gale uprooted sycamores, hollyhocks,\
    \ and strange unearthly shrubs which grow only in Finland. Thunderclaps deafened\
    \ the major domo of the orphanage. Lightning bolts blinded the crapulous Stalinist\
    \ funeral director. Then came the rain, a torrential downpour unleashed by storm-clouds\
    \ blacker than the blackest thing the human mind can comprehend. The temperature\
    \ plummeted. Rain turned to hail, assailing with ten thousand merciless pin-pricks\
    \ the pathetic figure of a man trudging through the streets of Helsinki dressed\
    \ only in shirt-sleeves and boxer shorts. The man was the notorious forger, quack\
    \ and charlatan Inigo Hoist. Moments before, he had been denuded of the rest of\
    \ his clothing and ejected from the hovel of his concubine, who had taken exception\
    \ to the odour on his breath of sour custard and hibiscus. Hoist managed to reach\
    \ his doctor's surgery without being crushed by a felled sycamore. He hammered\
    \ on the door, wailing desperately. At long last Doctor Calicagcag drew back the\
    \ fourteen bolts on his door and let Hoist in. The good doctor was wearing a rhinoceros\
    \ mask of beaten bronze. He cackled, and shoved the snivelling Hoist into his\
    \ sinister cabinet. Then he began to adjust the dials on the control panel\u2026\
    \u2026.\nTo be continued"
