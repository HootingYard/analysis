  text: 'At a loose end one blustery Thursday morning, Dobson decided to write a lengthy
    critical analysis of the The Life & Times of Captain Cake. He began, as he always
    did, by sharpening his pencil. That done, in a single burst of inexplicable enthusiasm,
    he penned an essay much, much longer than his usual pamphlets. It is a bewildering
    piece of work, caustic and trenchant even by Dobson''s standards, and was issued
    in fifteen weekly instalments. Flush with cash from the sale of his Big Mysterious
    Piece of Hardboard, Dobson took out advertisements in the press to announce his
    new part-work, offering the first issue at a discount price, and including a two-inch
    high plastic figurine of Captain Cake* as further inducement.

    Each of the fifteen instalments addresses a different aspect of the text. So,
    for example, Volume IV is entitled Welk, Bankhead, Loy : There''ll Be A Welcome
    In The Hillsides while Volumes VIII and IX both concentrate entirely on the game
    of ping pong. Long out of print, this superb (if unintelligible) essay is ripe
    for reassessment in the 21st century which Dobson did not live to see. Over the
    coming months, the Hooting Yard Foundation hopes to publish on this site a hypertext
    version of the essay. Be in no doubt that it will prove a boon to scholars worldwide.

    * NOTE : The distinguished critic and pirate F. X. Gilliblat claims that the figurine
    bears no resemblancewhatsoever to Captain Cake. He may well be right.'
