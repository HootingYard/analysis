  text: '"All hands on deck!" cried Captain Cake. He looked so much like Lawrence
    Welk. His crew were grim. They played ping pong on the poop deck, with spite and
    hate. But Captain Cake, he hacked and choked, and took his buckets to shops on
    shore, where he saw Tallulah Bankhead. She was a card sharp in the dockyards.

    Now Captain Cake had gone to seed. He looked as if he had been cursed by some
    bright-fanged Aztec God. I think it might be called Abraxas--either that or Myrna
    Loy, whose face loomed huge when he shut his eyes. Wracked by palsy, his hands
    were withered, and all his timbers had been shivered.
