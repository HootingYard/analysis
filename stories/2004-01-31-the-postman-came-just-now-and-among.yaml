  text: "\u201CThe postman came just now, and among the letters he brought was one\
    \ from North Wales. It was fat and soft and bulgy, and when it was opened we found\
    \ it contained a bit of seaweed. \u2026 \u201COh, how it smells of Sheringham,\u201D\
    \ said one. \u201CNo, there is the smack of Sidmouth, and Dawlish, and Torquay\
    \ in its perfume,\u201D said another.\u201D \u2014 Alfred George Gardiner (\u201C\
