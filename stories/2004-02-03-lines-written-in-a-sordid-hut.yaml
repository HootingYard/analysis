  text: "The dilapidated walls, the mouldering plaster, the blackened mantel-pieces,\
    \ the stained and polluted wainscots\u2014under license of a fop! Wrath, wrath\
    \ immeasurable, unimaginable, unmitigable, burned at my heart like a cancer; the\
    \ worst had come, among weeds and forgetfulness, the blank treachery of hollowness.\
    \ A pageant of vapory exhalations; thick clouds and vapours. Hoist by the fop's\
    \ petard, I could but drool.\nSource : Clapped In Irons, Booed In Zincs\u2014\
    Prose Poems by Gervase Beerpint, edited and annotated by Dobson."
