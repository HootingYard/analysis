  text: 'The dilapidated walls, the mouldering plaster, the blackened mantel-pieces,
    the stained and polluted wainscots--under license of a fop! Wrath, wrath immeasurable,
    unimaginable, unmitigable, burned at my heart like a cancer; the worst had come,
    among weeds and forgetfulness, the blank treachery of hollowness. A pageant of
    vapory exhalations; thick clouds and vapours. Hoist by the fop''s petard, I could
    but drool.
