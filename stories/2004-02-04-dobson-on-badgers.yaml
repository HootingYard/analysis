  text: "My loathing of squirrels is a matter of public record. To my chagrin, less\
    \ attention has been paid to my admiration of\u2014indeed, devotion to\u2014badgers,\
    \ despite the fact that for many years I have been a Fledgling Satrap of the Blister\
    \ Lane Institute of Badger Enthusiasts, and only last week was awarded a small,\
    \ charming, albeit greasy, tin badge by our esteemed Director. The citation was\
    \ ill-written and ungrammatical, probably because it was composed, under duress,\
    \ by my arch-enemy Perkins, of whom more anon.\nI recall clearly the most handsome\
    \ badger I ever clapped eyes upon. It was sitting, or lying, or just generally\
    \ disporting itself on the garden wall of a neighbour. It was so still that I\
    \ assumed it was in a badger-like doze. The morning was, after all, grimly hot.\
    \ I ran into my house (The Dobson Compound) to fetch a camera, intending to take\
    \ a snapshot to add to my album of over seventeen badger photographs. When I returned,\
    \ panting, the badger was still still. I approached closer. Imagine my disappointment\
    \ when I discovered that the badger was in fact made of plasticine! It had been\
    \ abandoned by that tiresome variety artiste Edith O'Shaughnessy (see below).\n\
