  text: 'My loathing of squirrels is a matter of public record. To my chagrin, less
    attention has been paid to my admiration of--indeed, devotion to--badgers, despite
    the fact that for many years I have been a Fledgling Satrap of the Blister Lane
    Institute of Badger Enthusiasts, and only last week was awarded a small, charming,
    albeit greasy, tin badge by our esteemed Director. The citation was ill-written
    and ungrammatical, probably because it was composed, under duress, by my arch-enemy
    Perkins, of whom more anon.

    I recall clearly the most handsome badger I ever clapped eyes upon. It was sitting,
    or lying, or just generally disporting itself on the garden wall of a neighbour.
    It was so still that I assumed it was in a badger-like doze. The morning was,
    after all, grimly hot. I ran into my house (The Dobson Compound) to fetch a camera,
    intending to take a snapshot to add to my album of over seventeen badger photographs.
    When I returned, panting, the badger was still still. I approached closer. Imagine
    my disappointment when I discovered that the badger was in fact made of plasticine!
    It had been abandoned by that tiresome variety artiste Edith O''Shaughnessy (see
    below).
