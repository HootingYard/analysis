  text: 'Ingredients : 6 oz self-raising flour, 6 oz self-hatred flour, 4 tbsp Jezebel
    oil, 25 pints boiled duckpond water, 1 raisin, 12 quail''s eggs, a smidgeon of
    marzipan, 12 cucumbers, 13 sticks rhubarb, a very large hollyhock, 2 buckets chaff,
    1 pint turtle''s blood, 5 pkts Special K(r), 15 blood oranges, 2 fresh bream*,
    54 more raisins, 1 plastic bag, 8 radishes, 1 cup ble, 18 pints milk, 3 lb toffee,
    5 tbsp gum arabic, 2 cups Bathsheba extract, 62 moorhen feathers, dash of isinglass,
    1 tbsp lemon curd, 3 balls wool, 5 oz. titanium, 1 beetle, 8 jars nameless, eldritch
    plasma.

    Method : 1. Find a large metal drum, about the size of a telephone kiosk. 2. Shove
    everything into it, having chopped up the things that need chopping. 3. Boil.
    4. While it boils, think long and hard about the fact that rhubarb takes its name
    from the Greek rheon barbaron, that is, something which comes from the barbarous
    country of the Rha--the Greek name for the Volga. 5. When it has finished boiling,
    transfer it into a big metal basin and bake it in an oven for four hours. 6. Remove
    from oven, allow to cool, then cut into cake-size cubes. 7. Fry the cakes over
    a low flame until golden, or what passes for golden in this leaden age. 8. Serve
    with milk diluted with tap water.

    * NOTE : The bream is the only fish to be named after a major 20th century English
    lutenist.'
