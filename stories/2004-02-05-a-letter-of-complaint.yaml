  text: "Reader Judith Winch writes :\nMr Key : I discovered your site while searching\
    \ for Xavier Cugat\u2014it seems your so-called \u201Csearch engine lure\u201D\
    \ works\u2014and I have become a regular visitor. Since the new year I have looked\
    \ forward to \u201Ccalling in\u201D at Hooting Yard on Sunday evenings to see\
    \ what new material has been added over the past seven days. I particularly like\
    \ the \u201CDecoy Duck of the Week\u201D feature, and am irritated that the name\
    \ is a misnomer, as some weeks go by with no sign of a decoy duck at all. Please\
    \ rectify this situation, or you risk losing a reader who might otherwise be described\
    \ as \u201Cdevoted (possibly)\u201D.\nI am happy to oblige!"
