  text: 'Reader Judith Winch writes :

    Mr Key : I discovered your site while searching for Xavier Cugat--it seems your
    so-called "search engine lure" works--and I have become a regular visitor. Since
    the new year I have looked forward to "calling in" at Hooting Yard on Sunday evenings
    to see what new material has been added over the past seven days. I particularly
    like the "Decoy Duck of the Week" feature, and am irritated that the name is a
    misnomer, as some weeks go by with no sign of a decoy duck at all. Please rectify
    this situation, or you risk losing a reader who might otherwise be described as
    "devoted (possibly)".

    I am happy to oblige!'
