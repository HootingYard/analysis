  text: This is a splendid exercise first developed by brain guru Dennis Beerpint,
    brother of the poet Gervase Beerpint (see 3rd February). Go to a field. Attaching
    clamps to slats with quarter-inch gulliver bolts, smear some lattice-work with
    a decoction of binding-agents and thread the netting through tin clips, then dislodge
    the hasp on the paddle in order to provide enough purchase on the metal flanges,
    which should be arranged in rotation beside colour-coded pails, the white one
    being strapped to a clogged bracket, the red one spinning on the torque engine,
    the blue one held in place by rubber frets, and the black one chiming against
    the aluminium knob on the wicket, which is fastened to the anchorage unit by a
    system of winches controlled by a clay handle on the bole, against which pellets
    are fired at pre-arranged intervals by the steam gun just below the fourth set
    of nozzles, cleverly positioned at such a distance from the first three sets to
    provide a constant stream of gases to pass over the tarpaulin, in which punctures
    have been made to allow ease of passage for the andiron tubes carrying ballbearings
    to the spandrel and thus on to the rotating wooden platform, upon which the greased
    hinges chafe against the pulleys sufficiently for the sparks to ignite sulphur
    bombs inside the bakelite carriage, without endangering the pads, bulbs and chocks
    on the hooter, at the sounding of which the intricately-wired snares snap shut
    and entrap the oiled plasticine clumps, thus momentarily halting the recurrent
    biting movements of the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of todge into the
    motor around which you will have placed canvas bags packed with candles in order
    to steady the persistent rattling of the ticker on the back of the iron sledge
    underneath the trolley carrying the double battery-powered hammer which serves
    to agitate the drum containing the four-inch blades detached from the rusted bowl
    of the compass, held in place on the rocket by a monstrous titanium screw wedged
    against the plackets of the grit distributor, customised by locking its gut probes
    into position with no less than twenty six separate multiple-gate plugs, on each
    of which a scorched zinc disc swivels in response to the magnetic properties of
    the special basin receiving the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling
    out of the glass globe tethered to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate
    by chains which run parallel to the lengths of string tied at one end to the pirate's
    aureole and at the other to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags
    stolen from the same warehouse which provided the hooks for the plank balanced
    uneasily across the gap between the pinboard and the hodometer fitted with small
    beeswax parcels lashed to the crane from which dangle several springs and coils
    loaded with lead weights and enamelled cubes the purpose of which becomes apparent
    when the gleaming cork is plunged into the canister of boiling duckpond water
    kept at constant temperature by hastily-repaired piping fed by siphons and buttressed
    by giant prongs from the surfaces of which have been expunged precisely engraved
    instructions for the use of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the
    derrick next to the pumps on the tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange
    taffeta swaddling material as a sop to the git who provided the jars, flakes and
    asbestos-free wing cranks you will require for timing the bleaching operation
    on the plastic squirting mechanism moulded out of discarded beetle caps salvaged
    from a manufacturer of resins whose grotesque sponge hood has been incorporated
    into the workings of the shiny magnesium tripod atop which lurks a uranium pill
    squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic pan containing phosphorus hoops and
    a glamorous leather trumpet pitched towards a cobalt beaker lit up by the Mackenzie
    Beam angled obliquely next to a yellow fustian canopy covering a massive trellis
    to which are glued an up-ended cone of polythene veiled by cotton-wool wrapped
    around a toy horse with a propeller caked in mercury powering the fulcrum and
    bails on the fractured tub countersunk behind the crust of a feather on a stool
    with pins affixed to the leaching grille placed askew atop the big cracked bucket
    of winnowed sand. Now stand back and count to a hundred. You will have forgotten
    all about juggling.
