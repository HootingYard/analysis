  text: 'It is vitally important to keep all your substances in separate, labelled
    jars. Nothing good can come of mistaking your turps for your suet, or vice versa.
    It can also help to arrange your jars in alphabetical order, to wit: blubber,
    crusts, curd, dew, grease, orts, pips, spume, ullage, vapour, whey. (This of course
    is only an example, as you may own an entirely different set of substances.)
