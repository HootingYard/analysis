  text: "Now : you know and I know that Hooting Yard is not the place to visit to\
    \ read the latest headlines. However, yesterday's Guardian had a small item that\
    \ deserves attention:\nA hotelier who refused to provide a free glass of tap water\
    \ to a guest at a Christmas party has written to the guest suggesting she try\
    \ living in the modern world. Anthony Cobley, manager of the three-star Atlantic\
    \ hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, said in his letter to Sally Burchell, a social worker,\
    \ that he could do without her as a customer. Ms Burchell, 43, had to pay 85p\
    \ for a glass of mineral water during the Christmas lunch for 50 colleagues from\
    \ the Cornwall child protection unit. Afterwards she wrote to the hotel saying\
    \ that she thought it unfair when her party had paid \xA318.50 a head for their\
    \ meal, and spent hundreds of pounds in addition on wine and beer. Mr Cobley wrote\
    \ back: \u201CI feel the need to enlighten you about the workings of the modern\
    \ world. I buy water from the South West Water Company. I buy the glasses that\
    \ the water is served in. I buy the ice that goes in the water and I buy the labour\
    \ to serve the water. I provide the luxury surroundings for the water to be drunk\
    \ in and again pay for the labour and washing materials to wash the glass after\
    \ you have used it, and you think I should provide all of this free of charge.\
    \ Customers who only drink water and complain about paying for it I can certainly\
    \ do without.\u201C"
