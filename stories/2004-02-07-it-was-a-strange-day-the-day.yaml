  text: "\u201CIt was a strange day, the day that I was born. The waves were beating\
    \ against the lighthouse, and the wind was roaring and raging against everything.\
    \ Had not the lighthouse been built very firmly into the strong solid rock, it,\
    \ and all within it, must have been swept into the deep wild sea.\u201D \u2014\
    \ Mrs O. F. Walton, Saved At Sea\nHow like the home life of your dear editor!"
