  text: '"It was a strange day, the day that I was born. The waves were beating against
    the lighthouse, and the wind was roaring and raging against everything. Had not
    the lighthouse been built very firmly into the strong solid rock, it, and all
    within it, must have been swept into the deep wild sea." -- Mrs O. F. Walton,
    Saved At Sea

    How like the home life of your dear editor!'
