  text: During the 1950s, a God-fearing American television producer named Fret D.
    Chenoweth created a 43-part series called To Smite And Smite Again, a dramatisation
    of the Old Testament. The novelty of his treatment was that the Biblical stories
    were set in a modern high school and acted by fresh-faced youngsters with names
    like Tad, Biff, Chip, Huck & so on. When he died--curiously enough, in the 1958
    Munich Air Disaster, surrounded by English footballers--Chenoweth's obituary described
    him as "the man who put the Chad in Nebuchadnezzar".
