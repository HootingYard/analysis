  text: 'The Tantarabim Carton was recovered from an old potting shed by Dobson, during
    one of his forays into what he called anarcho-''patapsychoarchaeolontology. It
    is a ceremonial carton which was used for unknown purposes during ceremonies prosecuted
    by the Bleach-Splattered Tantarabim Priesthood. Grim and horrifying these rituals
    may have been, but not the carton. It is 45 cm. in height, has a jewel-encrusted
    crimplene base, ivory fluting, ruched silk underbelts, hectic trimmings, a delightful
    milky-green ribbed spandole, villainous scraping marks, a gutta percha rim, opalescent
    bison-head motifs, swivelling glutinous beads inlaid with serried gems, fleur-de-lys
    hatching, precise web-and-tuck dufraiment, talc stipples, a riband nightside opening
    on the velveteen casing, some rather brusque kaolin relief work, tiny cack-iron
    clips, berry lagging, a splendid gilt Spode handle, and corky frets on the oversling.
    No picture is available.

    Dobson tried to present his find to an art gallery somewhere on the hard, unyielding
    banks of a river in Yukon Country, but he was chased away by burly men with bludgeons,
    and was lucky to escape with his life. He subsequently wrote up the episode in
    his pamphlet Chucklesome Fripperies From My Notebooks (Lavender Series).'
