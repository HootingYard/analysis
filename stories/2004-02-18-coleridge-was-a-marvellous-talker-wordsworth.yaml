  text: "\u201CColeridge was a marvellous talker \u2026 Wordsworth and I called upon\
    \ him one forenoon, when he was in a lodging off Pall Mall. He talked uninterruptedly\
    \ for about two hours, during which Wordsworth listened to him with profound attention,\
    \ every now and then nodding his head as if in assent. On quitting the lodging,\
    \ I said to Wordsworth, 'Well, for my own part, I could not make head or tail\
    \ of Coleridge's oration: pray, did you understand it?' \u2018Not one syllable\
    \ of it\u2019, was Wordsworth's reply.\u201D \u2014 Samuel Rogers, Table Talk"
