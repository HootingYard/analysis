  text: "The Irish writer Roddy Doyle recently turned his piercing critical pea-shooter\
    \ upon Joyce's Ulysses, accusing it, among other things, of being overlong and\
    \ in need of a good editor. Mr Doyle, if you are going to criticise a book, at\
    \ least do the job properly! Here are two excerpts from contemporary reviews of\
    \ the great work:\n\u201CAn immense mass of clotted nonsense\u201D \u2014 Teachers'\
    \ World\n\u201CThe maddest, muddiest, most loathsome book issued in our own or\
    \ any other time\u2026 inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty \u2026 a book\
    \ that one would have thought could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum\u201D\
    \ \u2014 The Sphere"
