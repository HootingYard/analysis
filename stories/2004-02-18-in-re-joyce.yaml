  text: 'The Irish writer Roddy Doyle recently turned his piercing critical pea-shooter
    upon Joyce''s Ulysses, accusing it, among other things, of being overlong and
    in need of a good editor. Mr Doyle, if you are going to criticise a book, at least
    do the job properly! Here are two excerpts from contemporary reviews of the great
    work:

    "An immense mass of clotted nonsense" -- Teachers'' World

    "The maddest, muddiest, most loathsome book issued in our own or any other time...
    inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty ... a book that one would have thought
    could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum" -- The Sphere'
