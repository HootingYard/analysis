  text: "By downloading and installing on my computer the DOBSON \xDCBERTOOLBAR, I\u2014\
    I who have nothing!\u2014understand that thereafter my life will become a thing\
    \ of unparalleled bliss, such as a mediaeval mystic could ne'er have dreamed of.\
    \ I understand that there is a peace that passeth all understanding, even if my\
    \ understanding of something which cannot be understood is a very difficult concept\
    \ to grasp, but clutch at it I will, with all the fibre of my being, like a shipwreck\
    \ survivor making their last desperate, gurgling attempt to gain purchase on a\
    \ rotten plank afloat in the ocean a thousand miles from dry land. I also understand\
    \ that nothing before in human or pre-human history has prepared the world for\
    \ the wonders of the DOBSON \xDCBERTOOLBAR, not even the MindMaps \x99 of cape-wearing\
    \ superbrain Tony Buzan, nay, nor even the \u201CSix Hats Thinking System\u201D\
    \ of Edward De Bono, which he described as \u201Cthe first new way of thinking\
    \ to be developed for 2,400 years since the days of Plato, Socrates and Aristotle\u201D\
    , and which involves putting on one's head a different coloured hat (let's say,\
    \ red, or yellow) depending on the focus of one's thoughts (let's say, list-making,\
    \ or analytical thinking). Begone, Buzan! Bow down, De Bono! For Dobson has come\
    \ among you and the steel of his intellectual scimitar is to be trembled at! Shudder\
    \ as if you were reading Lovecraft, or were being borne down upon by a Shoggoth!\
    \ I also understand that after downloading and installing the DOBSON \xDCBERTOOLBAR,\
    \ my computer will probably not work properly anymore, but that that is a small\
    \ price to pay."
