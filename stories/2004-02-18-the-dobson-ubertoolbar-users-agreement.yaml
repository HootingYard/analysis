  text: By downloading and installing on my computer the DOBSON UBERTOOLBAR, I--I
    who have nothing!--understand that thereafter my life will become a thing of unparalleled
    bliss, such as a mediaeval mystic could ne'er have dreamed of. I understand that
    there is a peace that passeth all understanding, even if my understanding of something
    which cannot be understood is a very difficult concept to grasp, but clutch at
    it I will, with all the fibre of my being, like a shipwreck survivor making their
    last desperate, gurgling attempt to gain purchase on a rotten plank afloat in
    the ocean a thousand miles from dry land. I also understand that nothing before
    in human or pre-human history has prepared the world for the wonders of the DOBSON
    UBERTOOLBAR, not even the MindMaps  of cape-wearing superbrain Tony Buzan, nay,
    nor even the "Six Hats Thinking System" of Edward De Bono, which he described
    as "the first new way of thinking to be developed for 2,400 years since the days
    of Plato, Socrates and Aristotle", and which involves putting on one's head a
    different coloured hat (let's say, red, or yellow) depending on the focus of one's
    thoughts (let's say, list-making, or analytical thinking). Begone, Buzan! Bow
    down, De Bono! For Dobson has come among you and the steel of his intellectual
    scimitar is to be trembled at! Shudder as if you were reading Lovecraft, or were
    being borne down upon by a Shoggoth! I also understand that after downloading
    and installing the DOBSON UBERTOOLBAR, my computer will probably not work properly
    anymore, but that that is a small price to pay.
