    Change forever the way you browse the web! Using powerful search features, the
    DOBSON UBERTOOLBAR lets you cut through billions of pages of drivel and focus
    entirely on material which has been addressed by Dobson in his pamphlets, and
    nothing else! What else would you ever need to know?

    For years, secret teams have been preparing an unimaginably vast Concordance Dobsonia.
    This has now been transferred to the web. Installation of the DOBSON UBERTOOLBAR--completely
    free of charge!--will give you the means to access this treasure trove.

    Before navigating to DOWNLOAD, you must first read the USER''S AGREEMENT.'
