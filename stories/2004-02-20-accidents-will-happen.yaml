  text: "An item in yesterday's Guardian mentioned the Royal Society for the Prevention\
    \ of Accidents (ROSPA). Let us consider the wonderful mysticism of that title.\
    \ First, it is \u201CRoyal\u201D, imbued with a lordly, monarchist ethos far above\
    \ the common herd of humankind. Then, it is a \u201CSociety\u201D, a fraternity\
    \ or sorority one supposes, an esoteric band of adepts, sworn together by bonds\
    \ of ritual secrecy. And on what purpose are they bent, these shadowy yet somehow\
    \ noble figures? Nothing less than the \u201CPrevention of Accidents\u201D! If\
    \ one thinks of an accident as an Act of God, which must surely be a common definition,\
    \ then here we have a group dedicated to averting or undoing the whims of the\
    \ Almighty. Whether that is heroic or abominable, it is incontrovertibly blasphemous.\
    \ And so we find, lurking behind the innocuous \u201CROSPA\u201D, that myth-shrouded\
    \ medieval organisation the Mystical Order of Divine Saboteurs."
