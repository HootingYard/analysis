  text: Where Ahab had acquired the pail, nobody knew. It was enormous, and painted
    cobalt blue. Ahab was driven to kick it with his muddy shoe. Months ago, he had
    filled it to the brim with goo. Some said the goo was the mashed-up remains of
    enemies Ahab slew. Within this noisome mash, fungi grew. Asked to account for
    his possession of both pail and contents, Ahab said "I haven't got a clue". One
    theorist proposed that Ahab was seeking to patent a new and revolutionary glue.
    Around his head, winged monsters flew. Ahab was beginning to resemble that legend,
    the Wandering Jew. He took his pail into a chapel and rested it upon a pew. There
    is much in the foregoing on which to chew. Not one word of it is true.
