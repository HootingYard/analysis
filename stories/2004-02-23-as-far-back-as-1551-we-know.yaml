  text: '"As far back as 1551 we know of the existence of Poestyen as a natural cure,
    and Sir Spencer Wells, the great English doctor, wrote about these waters in 1888.
    They are chiefly good for rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, the strengthening of broken
    bones, strains, and also for scrofula. On the premises there is a quaint museum
    with crutches and all sort of sticks and invalid chairs left there by their former
    owners in grateful acknowledgment of the wonderful waters and mire that had healed
    them." -- H. Tornai de Koever, Hungarian Baths and Resorts'
