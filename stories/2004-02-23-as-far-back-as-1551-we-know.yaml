  text: "\u201CAs far back as 1551 we know of the existence of Poestyen as a natural\
    \ cure, and Sir Spencer Wells, the great English doctor, wrote about these waters\
    \ in 1888. They are chiefly good for rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, the strengthening\
    \ of broken bones, strains, and also for scrofula. On the premises there is a\
    \ quaint museum with crutches and all sort of sticks and invalid chairs left there\
    \ by their former owners in grateful acknowledgment of the wonderful waters and\
    \ mire that had healed them.\u201D \u2014 H. Tornai de Koever, Hungarian Baths\
    \ and Resorts"
