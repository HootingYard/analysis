  text: "The glands of the investing tissue secrete lime and deposit it always submerged.\
    \ These arrest the spat at the moment of emission. They detach with a hook the\
    \ piles covered with fascines and branches, if we can use the term, buried in\
    \ the sands or mud, their polypiferous portion sallying into the water. The raches,\
    \ roughened and furrowed down the middle with pointed spiculae, or tubercular\
    \ ramifications prolonged in a straight canal, the columellar edge sometimes callous\u2014\
    this is the critical moment for the hapless bivalve! He seizes it with a three-pronged\
    \ fork, aiding also the functions of the stomach, filled with villainous green\
    \ matter, which is conical, swollen in the middle, diminished, tapers off, producing\
    \ new beings, covered with vibratile cilia, furnished with two fins, limited only\
    \ by the length of the stem, but in a moment beginning to dissolve its corporation,\
    \ a soft reticulated crust, or bark, full of little cavities. The hinder ones\
    \ loosen their hold, with four or six rows of ambulacral pieces designated by\
    \ the names of compass, plumula, bristling envelope, levelled bayonets, smothered.\
    \ Last come the terrible and multiplied engines of calcareous immovable thread-like\
    \ cirrhi with transverse bands, many of which crumble. Sometimes they are dredged."
