  text: The glands of the investing tissue secrete lime and deposit it always submerged.
    These arrest the spat at the moment of emission. They detach with a hook the piles
    covered with fascines and branches, if we can use the term, buried in the sands
    or mud, their polypiferous portion sallying into the water. The raches, roughened
    and furrowed down the middle with pointed spiculae, or tubercular ramifications
    prolonged in a straight canal, the columellar edge sometimes callous--this is
    the critical moment for the hapless bivalve! He seizes it with a three-pronged
    fork, aiding also the functions of the stomach, filled with villainous green matter,
    which is conical, swollen in the middle, diminished, tapers off, producing new
    beings, covered with vibratile cilia, furnished with two fins, limited only by
    the length of the stem, but in a moment beginning to dissolve its corporation,
    a soft reticulated crust, or bark, full of little cavities. The hinder ones loosen
    their hold, with four or six rows of ambulacral pieces designated by the names
    of compass, plumula, bristling envelope, levelled bayonets, smothered. Last come
    the terrible and multiplied engines of calcareous immovable thread-like cirrhi
    with transverse bands, many of which crumble. Sometimes they are dredged.
