  text: 'A number of readers have suggested that Hooting Yard''s vision of the natural
    world is an extremely narrow one, overpopulated by birds, with the occasional
    badger thrown in, and all other life-forms excluded. There is, I suspect, some
    justice in this. You are more likely to come upon, let''s say, a list of three-letter
    bird-names (auk, cob, emu, hen, jay, kea, moa, owl, pen, poe, roc, tit, tui) than
    an equivalent catalogue of bears, insects, or horses. As a corrective to this
    tunnel vision, reader Matt Hamilton has sent in this delightful picture of a fish.
    Matt lives on, or near, the banks of the Potomac, I believe, so this would appear
    to be a drawing based on natural observation.
