  text: 'Dear Uncle Dan

    I have been given a burlap sack full of old crocuses and I have no idea what to
    do with it. Please help.

    Valentine Smew

    Uncle Dan says: Well, Valentine, whenever I read the word "crocuses" I think of
    ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging, also called kado, or "the way of
    the flowers". Get yourself a vase and transfer the crocuses from the sack. Throw
    the sack away. Now--be deft! Manipulate the crocuses with delicacy, taste and
    vision. There is, of course, the possibility that you lack these qualities, in
    which case you may be better occupied throwing the crocuses away and retaining
    the burlap sack. With a pair of scissors and a sewing machine you will soon be
    able to turn it into a mightily uncomfortable vest which can be wrapped up and
    given as a Christmas or birthday gift to a devout Roman Catholic. Jesuit priests
    in particular are known to be fond of such garb. If you do not number any Jesuits
    among your acquaintances, I would recommend visiting the SJ Web, an excellent
    resource "connecting Jesuits and friends around the world". The Lord be with you,
    Valentine Smew.'
