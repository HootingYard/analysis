  text: "Dear Uncle Dan\nI have been given a burlap sack full of old crocuses and\
    \ I have no idea what to do with it. Please help.\nValentine Smew\nUncle Dan says:\
    \ Well, Valentine, whenever I read the word \u201Ccrocuses\u201D I think of ikebana,\
    \ the Japanese art of flower arranging, also called kado, or \u201Cthe way of\
    \ the flowers\u201D. Get yourself a vase and transfer the crocuses from the sack.\
    \ Throw the sack away. Now\u2014be deft! Manipulate the crocuses with delicacy,\
    \ taste and vision. There is, of course, the possibility that you lack these qualities,\
    \ in which case you may be better occupied throwing the crocuses away and retaining\
    \ the burlap sack. With a pair of scissors and a sewing machine you will soon\
    \ be able to turn it into a mightily uncomfortable vest which can be wrapped up\
    \ and given as a Christmas or birthday gift to a devout Roman Catholic. Jesuit\
    \ priests in particular are known to be fond of such garb. If you do not number\
    \ any Jesuits among your acquaintances, I would recommend visiting the SJ Web,\
    \ an excellent resource \u201Cconnecting Jesuits and friends around the world\u201D\
    . The Lord be with you, Valentine Smew."
