  text: 'Dear Mr Key : Glancing at the section entitled Make Your Own Glue (23rd February),
    I misread the third of your cut-out-and-keep labels as "Nameless God". I very
    much like the idea of keeping a little tin marked "Nameless God" on a shelf, possibly
    in the kitchen, and wonder if you could provide a label accordingly. Furthermore,
    I wonder if Hooting Yard readers can make suggestions as to what I could actually
    keep in the tin? I am not particularly religious, but this has set me to thinking
    that it would be a good way to nurture my spirituality. Any ideas? Yours sincerely,
    Tim Thurn
