  text: '"He heard only the soughing of the wind, the hissing pelt of raindrops in
    the scrub oak. Sickened fear assailed him, then; fear, not for himself but for
    the girl he loved. He remembered the dark, sinister threats uttered by Lige Ludwell,

    suspended head-downward somewhere, her life-blood being drained from her veins,
    either by vengeful clansmen or by something worse . . . such as an undead vampire-corpse
