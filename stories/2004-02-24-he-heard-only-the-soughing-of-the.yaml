  text: "\u201CHe heard only the soughing of the wind, the hissing pelt of raindrops\
    \ in the scrub oak. Sickened fear assailed him, then; fear, not for himself but\
    \ for the girl he loved. He remembered the dark, sinister threats uttered by Lige\
    \ Ludwell, and he recalled how Lige's daughter had died. Maybe Brenda was even\
    \ now hanging suspended head-downward somewhere, her life-blood being drained\
    \ from her veins, either by vengeful clansmen or by something worse . . . such\
    \ as an undead vampire-corpse . . . Until tonight, he would have scoffed at such\
    \ an eldritch, hellish fancy. But in view of what had already happened, a cold\
    \ slime of horror slid into his marrow.\u201D \u2014 Robert Leslie Bellem, Blood\
    \ For The Vampire Dead"
