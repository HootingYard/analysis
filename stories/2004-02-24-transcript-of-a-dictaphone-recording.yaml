  text: "[Uncanny and repetitive metallic banging noises, as if from the maw of Hell.]\n\
    Ick Ack \xDClm. According to the programme, this racket must be an ensemble called\
    \ \u201CBrouhaha\u201D playing a piece called Tiny moths, ah! gossamer wings.\
    \ I suppose that's meant to be ironic in some way. Either that or it's a mistranslation\u2014\
    after all, they're Hungarians. And so many of them! I counted forty, but then\
    \ more appeared with hammers and other ironmongery. And they all bear a faint\
    \ resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Maybe \u201CBrouhaha\u201D is one big family.\
    \ I will have to check. This piece has been going on for over an hour and they\
    \ look as if they're just warming up. God help us.\n[Edit.]\nNow that was more\
    \ like it. I\u2019ve just finished watching Fleur & Primrose, much more conducive\
    \ to my tastes. Fleur played pocket cornet and Primrose played tack piano. Instrumentals,\
    \ mostly, with a sort of valiant carelessness. I don't think any of the pieces\
    \ lasted more than 45 seconds. The last number was strange. They were joined by\
    \ someone called Dennis, who shouted things. I think he was reading from a list\
    \ of water polo cup tie results. Matchless!\n[Edit.]\nI really don't know what\
    \ I\u2019m doing here.\n[Edit.]\nIt's three hours since I last recorded. I\u2019\
    ve just come back on the bus from the \xDClm Swimming Pool, Lido and Marina complex,\
    \ where parts of the Festival are taking place. I went over there to hear the\
    \ big event everyone has been talking about\u2014the premiere of Binder's Concerto\
    \ For Medicine Balls, Blood Oranges & Canoe. I assumed it was going to be an electronic\
    \ piece, but no, it was all natural, unamplified sound, and somehow it had an\
    \ astonishing Monteverdiesque resonance which is hard to explain. It was visually\
    \ exciting too, as all the players were wearing hideous orange jump-suits. I\u2019\
    m sure I saw Primrose in the mel\xE9e somewhere, without her tack piano sadly.\n\
    [Edit.]\nNext up is something called \u201CBig Flugelhorn Mayhem In The Northern\
    \ Territories Disputed By Goat Boy And His Whelk Farm Hard Hat Orchestra\u201D\
    . I think I\u2019ll give it a miss.\n[Recording ends.]"
