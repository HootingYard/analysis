  text: "A number of readers have written to request further information about the\
    \ 1955 Festival of Argumentative Music held in \xDClm (see Lothar Preen News,\
    \ 3rd February). And guess what\u2014Dobson was there! Bizarrely, he never published\
    \ his observations as a pamphlet. The text given here has been transcribed by\
    \ Marigold Chew from a dictaphone recording made by Dobson which was lost for\
    \ many years, and only recently came to light, hidden behind the pipes of an intricate\
    \ plumbing system in the basement of the Pang Hill Fireworks Factory. What it\
    \ was doing there is anybody's guess. Dobson is known to have had various altercations\
    \ with the janitor of the factory, one Joost Van Dongelbracke, who later became\
    \ famous\u2014or infamous\u2014as the \u201CSuburban Shaman\u201D, founder of\
    \ a cult which gained an incredible four million adherents across Europe and North\
    \ America in the 1970s before imploding in ghastly circumstances. Persistent rumours\
    \ that President Nixon was a member have never been proved one way or the other.\
    \ Whatever, as the young people say. What concerns us here is the Dobson transcript."
