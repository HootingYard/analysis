  text: A number of readers have written to request further information about the
    1955 Festival of Argumentative Music held in Ulm (see Lothar Preen News, 3rd February).
    And guess what--Dobson was there! Bizarrely, he never published his observations
    as a pamphlet. The text given here has been transcribed by Marigold Chew from
    a dictaphone recording made by Dobson which was lost for many years, and only
    recently came to light, hidden behind the pipes of an intricate plumbing system
    in the basement of the Pang Hill Fireworks Factory. What it was doing there is
    anybody's guess. Dobson is known to have had various altercations with the janitor
    of the factory, one Joost Van Dongelbracke, who later became famous--or infamous--as
    the "Suburban Shaman", founder of a cult which gained an incredible four million
    adherents across Europe and North America in the 1970s before imploding in ghastly
    circumstances. Persistent rumours that President Nixon was a member have never
    been proved one way or the other. Whatever, as the young people say. What concerns
    us here is the Dobson transcript.
