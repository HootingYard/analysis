    One''s thoughts turn, as they so often do, to Richard Milhous Nixon. One thinks
    of a certain jowliness, of the sweat and five o'' clock shadow which, it is said,
    lost him the televised 1960 election debate with Kennedy. One thinks of a little
    dog called Checkers. One recalls--with a jolt--that he was raised as a Quaker.
    One thinks of cold rage, bitterness, and "expletives deleted". Inevitably, one
    thinks of Watergate, and one considers that, thirty years after Nixon''s resignation,
    -gate is the suffix-of-choice for lazy journalists writing about any and every
    political scandal. And one is thankful for that laziness, because it is so amusing
    to see how short a time it takes from the first stirrings of a scandal to the
    first appearance in print of the -gate word. Last year, for example, when the
    ex-Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith ("the Quiet Man") stood accused
    of misusing public funds to pay his wife, it took only about forty eight hours
    for the episode to be dubbed Betsygate. All of which brings us to the series of
    events which, had they occurred after 1972, would no doubt have been called Van
    Dongelbrackegate. See below.'
