  text: "\nThis is, indeed, Split, shown here as a taster for a forthcoming Hooting\
    \ Yard series in which Matilda Spamclot will be writing about her bicycle journey\
    \ from Split in Croatia to Splat in Cornwall. Says Matilda : \u201CMy previous\
    \ trip was from the Finnish town of Hell to Hull, and Split to Splat seemed equally\
    \ enticing! Gosh, I had so many adventures on the way! The incident with the postman,\
    \ the cormorant and the lid of a bleach bottle doesn't tell you the half of it!\
    \ Look out for this exciting new series, posted exclusively to Hooting Yard! Yes,\
    \ I know, I know, I am overfond of exclamation marks! I'm a proper caution!\u201D"
