    This is, indeed, Split, shown here as a taster for a forthcoming Hooting Yard
    series in which Matilda Spamclot will be writing about her bicycle journey from
    Split in Croatia to Splat in Cornwall. Says Matilda : "My previous trip was from
    the Finnish town of Hell to Hull, and Split to Splat seemed equally enticing!
    Gosh, I had so many adventures on the way! The incident with the postman, the
    cormorant and the lid of a bleach bottle doesn''t tell you the half of it! Look
    out for this exciting new series, posted exclusively to Hooting Yard! Yes, I know,
    I know, I am overfond of exclamation marks! I''m a proper caution!"'
