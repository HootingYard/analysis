  text: "Little is known of the origins of football, a game which is today one of\
    \ the most popular sports throughout the Northern Lands. According to De Smet\
    \ [see The Punnet, Vol XVI No.9], football began when tribal elders in the hinterland\
    \ around Hoon took to mucking about after the annual ritual ostrich-battering.\
    \ Thumper, on the other hand, has argued in a number of persuasive essays that\
    \ the sordid practices of a family living in a cave near Bodger's Spinney were\
    \ the true origins of the game. Either of these theories may be true, as might\
    \ thousands upon thousands of others. But let us not tarry in the past.\nThe rules\
    \ of football are stupendously complex. The rubric itself fills hundreds of huge\
    \ volumes, and interpretative texts, analyses and commentaries have accumulated\
    \ at such a rate that entire libraries are now devoted to the subject. That being\
    \ the case, it is impractical in this essay to do more than sketch the merest\
    \ outline. So let us draw breath, take stock, make a cup of tea, twang a ukulele,\
    \ skip frolicsome thro' ling and heather, rap curses at hunched louts, sprinkle\
    \ talc upon our scalps, whisk an egg, brush our teeth, impale a mothball, crack\
    \ a biscuit, mumble a homily, tie a ship's knot in a necklace, stoke up the fire,\
    \ spit on the coals, irk a butcher, crick our necks, stamp on a bee, shovel grit\
    \ outside the police station, howl at the Wergo, mitigate a plea, fold a crocus,\
    \ employ a grotesquerie and put a flea in its ear: come follow me as I expound\
    \ the laws of football.\nThere are two teams of thirty one players each, plus\
    \ a moderator, two assistant moderators, a plinth sergeant, a brazil nut attendant,\
    \ and a person holding a tape measure. The teams are dubbed \u201CBark\u201D and\
    \ \u201CSap\u201D: these terms are as arbitrary as the use of white and black\
    \ to differentiate chess pieces, or the pigs and cones used in the game of lanternjaw.\
    \ Each team consists of ten jack hulberts, ten cicely courtneidges, six badgers,\
    \ a winch, a hurdle, a cake, a denial, and a pond. Only two badgers may be fielded\
    \ at one time, unless the winch is out of play. Players may make use of bats,\
    \ sticks, hooked poles, claw-hammers, lances, ballbearings, fenceposts, swords,\
    \ bayonets, doorhandles, fireworks and icing sugar. At the beginning of play the\
    \ moderator tosses on to the rink three balls: one is of leather, one of bladder,\
    \ and one of zinc. Surprisingly, the rules say nothing about the size of the balls,\
    \ and there is great variation among those commonly in use.\nThe object of the\
    \ game is for the Bark team to puncture the leather and bladder balls beyond repair\
    \ and to hide the zinc ball for a period of twenty three hours, while the Sap\
    \ team must try to protect all three balls by putting them in wicker containers\
    \ and keeping the opposing side away from them for an identical period. The field\
    \ of play is called the pitch, rink, arena, clat, ford, or basin. It is marked\
    \ out with an intricate tangle of signs and symbols and is usually waterlogged.\n\
    A true appreciation of football is hampered by the difficulty of understanding\
    \ the subsidiary objectives\u2014or \u201Cplanks\u201D \u2014 of the game. Either\
    \ of the assistant moderators may impose planks at the start of the game or in\
    \ the intervals between fits. There is an enormous list of planks in the rule-books\
    \ from which selections may be made. A brief sample here can do no more than suggest\
    \ an idea of the subtlety of thought which has developed in this aspect of football\
    \ over the years. Taken literally at random, the list of planks includes the following:\
    \ digging a trench across the rink; sawing off the handles of the opposing team's\
    \ swords; planning, preparing, cooking, serving and eating a gala pie; synchronised\
    \ palpitation; instilling an overwhelming sense of wistfulness in one's team-mates;\
    \ dismantling the wicket; holding an accordion contest.\nPenalties for foul play\
    \ are vicious, arbitrary and senseless. Only the moderator and the plinth sergeant\
    \ are permitted to impose penalties, and they must consult with each other, using\
    \ an intricate system of hand signals, before the penalty can be implemented.\
    \ Please do not be given the impression that there is any element of violence\
    \ in the penalties. Their viciousness, arbitrariness and senselessness are of\
    \ a much higher order, inconceivable to those who have not themselves played the\
    \ game.\nThe kit, or strip, is of admirable simplicity. The Sap team appears naked,\
    \ with the small concession to modesty of skin-tight, flesh-coloured tunics. (In\
    \ this case, flesh-coloured means precisely what it says. The garments are dyed\
    \ to the exact shade of the individual player's skin by experts retained by the\
    \ Football Association.) The Bark team, on the other hand, is kitted out in voluminous\
    \ clothing suitable for an Antarctic expedition\u2014all furs, hides and swaddling,\
    \ with plenty of pockets, pouches, flaps, zips, buttons, toggles, belts and buckles.\
    \ As the game is played throughout the year, the Sap team has a natural advantage\
    \ in the summer months, while the Bark team will tend to perform better in the\
    \ biting chill of winter.\nBut enough of these confounded rules! As it is, they\
    \ are elastic, very elastic. So much depends upon the temperament of the brazil\
    \ nut attendant, in whose hands the very nature of the game can be transformed,\
    \ to the extent that the rules I have so patiently explained would be unrecognisable\
    \ to you, dear reader. The commentaries on the role of this official are abstruse\
    \ and profound, and are deserving of years and years of study. Bagshaw and Taplow,\
    \ in their invaluable tome The Brazil Nut Attendant : Retribution & Paralysis,\
    \ have come closest to providing a manageable overview of the topic, although\
    \ their tendency to refer to the game as \u201Csocker\u201D is regrettable.\n\
    Before bringing this essay to a sprightly close, it will be helpful to give the\
    \ reader some idea of the game's organisation, particularly in the professional\
    \ sphere. The two chief administrative bodies are the Football Association and\
    \ the Football League. The former is a severe and monolithic body which ensures\
    \ that the rules of the game are adhered to by all parties at all times. It has\
    \ a staff of over eight hundred scriveners, clerks and lackeys who work by the\
    \ light of just four Tilly lamps. These saintly men and women spend their working\
    \ lives issuing lengthy directives couched in a language so mesmeric that the\
    \ recipients throw them at once into the dustbin without even trying to wring\
    \ any sense out of them. This cavalier attitude has its repercussions, of course.\
    \ From time to time, the Association sends out Special Inspectors, highly-trained\
    \ gits plucked from sinks of corruption, with murder in their hearts and blackjacks\
    \ in their fists. No football club visited by a Special Inspector has ever dared\
    \ transgress the rules again. The Association holds an annual competition, the\
    \ winning team of which is awarded the Fred Jesson Cup, named after Laura's husband\
    \ in the film Brief Encounter. The cup is a model of a pollarded willow made out\
    \ of battered tin. Birdhole's mighty six-volume From Custard To Wooziness provides\
    \ a splendid history of the contest, and bravely addresses the more arcane aspects\
    \ of the marking system, contemplation of which has led countless devotees to\
    \ a sordid, drink-sodden demise.\nOf the Football League, however, there is nothing\
    \ remotely interesting to be said."
