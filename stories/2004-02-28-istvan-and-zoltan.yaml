  text: "\u201CCrikey!\u201D exclaimed Istvan, \u201CWhat in the name of heaven is\
    \ that?\u201D\nHis twin brother Zoltan looked up from the book he was reading.\
    \ \u201CIstvan, calm down,\u201D he drawled, \u201CYou know I hate to be interrupted\
    \ in my reading, especially when the book in my hands is the Journals of Gerard\
    \ Manley Hopkins & I have just got to the entry for that most exciting day, 27th\
    \ April 1871, when the poet, quote, mesmerised a duck with chalk lines drawn from\
    \ her beak sometimes level & sometimes forwards on a black table, unquote.\u201D\
    \n\u201CHow on earth can you immerse yourself in the prose of a Victorian Jesuit,\u201D\
    \ screeched Istvan, \u201CWhen I am about to be waylaid by a preposterously complicated\
    \ mechanical contraption somehow imbued with almost human malevolence?\u201D\n\
    Zoltan yawned. \u201CI have long been fascinated by Hopkins,\u201D he averred,\
    \ \u201CIncidentally, were you aware, o twin, that the nuns whose drowning was\
    \ commemorated in that majestic poem The Wreck of the Deutschland lie buried in\
    \ Saint Patrick's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Leytonstone, east London, & that\
    \ I have placed flowers on the grave? Peonies, I recall, or mayhap they were pinks,\
    \ or pansies.\u201D\n\u201CEek!\u201D yelled Istvan. Zoltan cast his eyes in the\
    \ direction indicated by the frantic gesticulations his twin brother made to complement\
    \ his frightful \u2018eek\u2019.\n\u201CGolly!\u201D gasped Zoltan, his eyes popping.\
    \ For trundling at inhuman speed towards Istvan was a monstrous steam-powered\
    \ engine, bulky & strange, built of tungsten, titanium & tin, & seemingly alive\
    \ with a perplexing array of hooters, levers, flaps, nozzles, chains, bleepers,\
    \ consoles, klaxons, chocks, struts, decoy shields, Coddington lenses, batteries,\
    \ prongs, bits of corrugated cardboard & Mackenzie beams. It was the Indigestion\
    \ Machine!"
