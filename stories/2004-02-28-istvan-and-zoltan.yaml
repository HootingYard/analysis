  text: '"Crikey!" exclaimed Istvan, "What in the name of heaven is that?"

    His twin brother Zoltan looked up from the book he was reading. "Istvan, calm
    down," he drawled, "You know I hate to be interrupted in my reading, especially
    when the book in my hands is the Journals of Gerard Manley Hopkins & I have just
    got to the entry for that most exciting day, 27th April 1871, when the poet, quote,
    mesmerised a duck with chalk lines drawn from her beak sometimes level & sometimes
    forwards on a black table, unquote."

    "How on earth can you immerse yourself in the prose of a Victorian Jesuit," screeched
    Istvan, "When I am about to be waylaid by a preposterously complicated mechanical
    contraption somehow imbued with almost human malevolence?"

    Zoltan yawned. "I have long been fascinated by Hopkins," he averred, "Incidentally,
    were you aware, o twin, that the nuns whose drowning was commemorated in that
    majestic poem The Wreck of the Deutschland lie buried in Saint Patrick''s Roman
    Catholic Cemetery in Leytonstone, east London, & that I have placed flowers on
    the grave? Peonies, I recall, or mayhap they were pinks, or pansies."

    "Eek!" yelled Istvan. Zoltan cast his eyes in the direction indicated by the frantic
    gesticulations his twin brother made to complement his frightful ''eek''.

    "Golly!" gasped Zoltan, his eyes popping. For trundling at inhuman speed towards
    Istvan was a monstrous steam-powered engine, bulky & strange, built of tungsten,
    titanium & tin, & seemingly alive with a perplexing array of hooters, levers,
    flaps, nozzles, chains, bleepers, consoles, klaxons, chocks, struts, decoy shields,
    Coddington lenses, batteries, prongs, bits of corrugated cardboard & Mackenzie
    beams. It was the Indigestion Machine!'
