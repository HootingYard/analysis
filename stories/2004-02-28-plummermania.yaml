  text: Quetzalcoatl is the feathered serpent, an Aztec deity, as worshipped by Christopher
    Plummer in his weird performance as Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1969).
    In a better world, Plummer would have used the same acting technique (and terrific
    strangulated high-pitched squawking voice) in his earlier role as Baron Von Trapp
    in The Sound of Music. Imagining this is always a good way to cheer oneself up.
