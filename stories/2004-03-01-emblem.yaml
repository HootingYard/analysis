  text: "Alert readers will have noted the appearance (thrice) of a crest or emblem\
    \ at the top of the page. This is taken from the pamphlet Dobson's Heraldic Dossier,\
    \ a bewildering little booklet which the great pamphleteer had specially printed\
    \ on an antique press which Marigold Chew discovered rotting away in a blizzard-swept\
    \ tent on the outskirts of Helsinki during her tour of Finland. Dobson writes\
    \ in hallucinatory prose about what he calls \u201Cthe new heraldry\u201D which\
    \ he planned to usher in, and provides a number of examples of his own devising,\
    \ though it is thought that the artwork itself was completed by Chew. For a large-scale\
    \ copy of Implausible,click on the further example below:\n"
