  text: 'Alert readers will have noted the appearance (thrice) of a crest or emblem
    at the top of the page. This is taken from the pamphlet Dobson''s Heraldic Dossier,
    a bewildering little booklet which the great pamphleteer had specially printed
    on an antique press which Marigold Chew discovered rotting away in a blizzard-swept
    tent on the outskirts of Helsinki during her tour of Finland. Dobson writes in
    hallucinatory prose about what he calls "the new heraldry" which he planned to
    usher in, and provides a number of examples of his own devising, though it is
    thought that the artwork itself was completed by Chew. For a large-scale copy
