  text: "It's well known that Sherlock Holmes described his arch enemy Moriarty as\
    \ \u201Cthe Napoleon of crime\u201D. Less celebrated, but far, far more evocative,\
    \ is his description of Dr Watson as \u201Cthe stormy petrel of crime\u201D (see\
    \ The Adventure of the Naval Treaty, and also see below):\n\nWatson & petrel :\
    \ the petrel is the one on the right"
