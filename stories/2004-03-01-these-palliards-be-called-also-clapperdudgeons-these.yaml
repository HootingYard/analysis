  text: "\u201CThese palliards be called also clapperdudgeons. These go with patched\
    \ cloaks, and have their morts with them, which they call wives. And if he go\
    \ to one house to ask his alms, his wife shall go to another; for what they get,\
    \ as bread, cheese, malt and wool, they sell the same for ready money; for so\
    \ they get more [than] if they went together. Although they be thus divided in\
    \ the day, yet they meet jump at night \u2026 Farther understand for truth that\
    \ the worst and wickedest of all this beastly generation are scarce comparable\
    \ to these prating palliards. All for the most part of these will either lay to\
    \ their legs an herb called spearwort, either arsenic, which is called ratsbane.\
    \ The nature of this spearwort will raise a great blister in a night upon the\
    \ soundest part of his body. And if the same be taken away, it will dry up again\
    \ and no harm. But this arsenic will so poison the same leg or sore, that it will\
    \ ever after be incurable. This they do for gain and to be pitied. The most of\
    \ these that walk about be Welshmen.\u201D \u2014 Thomas Harman, A Caveat or Warening,\
    \ for Commen Cursetors Vulgarely Called Vagabones (1566)"
