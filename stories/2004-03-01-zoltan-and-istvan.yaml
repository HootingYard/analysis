  text: '"Crikey!" exclaimed Istvan. He had just noticed that a fierce gigantic elephant-like
    being was thundering towards him, & that he was almost certain to be crushed to
    death within the next few seconds.

    "Have you ever read The Anatomy of Melancholy?" asked his twin brother Zoltan,
    who was reclining in a hammock safely out of the path of the fierce gigantic elephant-like
    being. Zoltan was speaking through a shiny red loudhailer.

    "Cease taunting me with seventeenth century prose!" cried Istvan, "Is it beyond
    your puny wits to see that I am about to be flattened by a fierce gigantic elephant-like
    being?"

    "Oh, I wouldn''t worry about that," drawled Zoltan, "It will be stopped in its
    tracks by the mahout who is at this very moment careering across the verdant greensward
    bent on intercepting it."

    "Pah!" expostulated Istvan, his terror momentarily submerged beneath contempt
    for his brother, "Next you will be telling me that you are ignorant of the two
    salient features of all mahouts: one, they are unhinged, and two, their skills
    are defunct in this our brave new century."

    The fierce gigantic elephant-like being had meanwhile halved the distance between
    itself & Istvan, whose now renewed terror rooted him to the spot. That spot, incidentally,
    lay a yard or two from a chance splash of campions in bloom, their vivid colours
    a pleasing contrast to the bracken, furze & bindweed run riot o''er the greensward
    as far as the human eye could see. Zoltan removed his pince-nez, & holding them
    with strange delicacy in his mighty, hairy fist, he said: "That''s as may be,
    o twin, but I can assure you that this particular mahout is both hinged & funct."

    And he was proved correct, for just then the said mahout leapt astride the fierce
    gigantic elephant-like being & coaxed it to a halt.'
