  text: 'Chewism is the popular name for the fictional method pioneered by Marigold
    Chew (1955-1998). In her only book, Six Hundred And Six Stories, Chew demonstrated
    what she called "interstitial prose": she would take an existing composition (from
    a bewildering variety of sources) and insert her own text in between each and
    every sentence of the original material. Sometimes the results were startling:
    the poet Gervase Beerpint, in one of his all too rare critical essays, said that
    Chew''s story based upon a chapter from George Bernard Shaw''s "nonage novel"
    The Irrational Knot was "as good as anything by Ayn Rand, and makes John Fowles
    read like a grumpy cod-mystic of limited talent". (Inevitably, Beerpint received
    a grumpy letter from Fowles within days of the essay being published. Wisely,
    he cast it into a furnace.) As a special treat for Hooting Yard readers, we have
    gained permission to reprint one of Marigold Chew''s uncollected stories, The
    Albatross, where her "interstices" appear within a short sketch of the same title
    by Augustus Earle which was included in The Book of Enterprise & Adventure; Being
    an Excitement to Reading for Young People (London, 1851).'
