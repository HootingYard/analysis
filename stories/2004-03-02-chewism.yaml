  text: "Chewism is the popular name for the fictional method pioneered by Marigold\
    \ Chew (1955-1998). In her only book, Six Hundred And Six Stories, Chew demonstrated\
    \ what she called \u201Cinterstitial prose\u201D: she would take an existing composition\
    \ (from a bewildering variety of sources) and insert her own text in between each\
    \ and every sentence of the original material. Sometimes the results were startling:\
    \ the poet Gervase Beerpint, in one of his all too rare critical essays, said\
    \ that Chew's story based upon a chapter from George Bernard Shaw's \u201Cnonage\
    \ novel\u201D The Irrational Knot was \u201Cas good as anything by Ayn Rand, and\
    \ makes John Fowles read like a grumpy cod-mystic of limited talent\u201D. (Inevitably,\
    \ Beerpint received a grumpy letter from Fowles within days of the essay being\
    \ published. Wisely, he cast it into a furnace.) As a special treat for Hooting\
    \ Yard readers, we have gained permission to reprint one of Marigold Chew's uncollected\
    \ stories, The Albatross, where her \u201Cinterstices\u201D appear within a short\
    \ sketch of the same title by Augustus Earle which was included in The Book of\
    \ Enterprise & Adventure; Being an Excitement to Reading for Young People (London,\
    \ 1851)."
