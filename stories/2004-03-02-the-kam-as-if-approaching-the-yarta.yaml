  text: '"The kam, as if approaching the Yarta of Erlik and coming into his presence,
    bows, brings his drum up to his forehead, and says, ''Mergu! mergu!'' Then he
    declares whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts; this is meant to indicate
    that Erlik is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his yurta. The frightened
    kam leaps backward towards the door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches
    Erlik''s throne. After this performance has been gone through three times, Erlik
    speaks: ''Winged creatures cannot fly hither, beings with bones cannot come: how
    have you, ill-smelling black beetle, made your way to my abode?''" -- M. A. Czaplicka,
    Shamanism In Siberia'
