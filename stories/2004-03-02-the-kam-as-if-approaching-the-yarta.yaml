  text: "\u201CThe kam, as if approaching the Yarta of Erlik and coming into his presence,\
    \ bows, brings his drum up to his forehead, and says, \u2018Mergu! mergu!\u2019\
    \ Then he declares whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts; this is meant\
    \ to indicate that Erlik is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his yurta.\
    \ The frightened kam leaps backward towards the door, but gathers fresh courage\
    \ and again approaches Erlik's throne. After this performance has been gone through\
    \ three times, Erlik speaks: \u2018Winged creatures cannot fly hither, beings\
    \ with bones cannot come: how have you, ill-smelling black beetle, made your way\
    \ to my abode?\u2019\u201D \u2014 M. A. Czaplicka, Shamanism In Siberia"
