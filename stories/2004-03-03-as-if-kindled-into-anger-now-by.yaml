  text: "\u201CAs if kindled into anger now by sight of his wasted grief, as if vindictive\
    \ with long-delayed revelation, she went to the bureau that had been Julia's.\
    \ She threw open a drawer of it with such righteous violence that the whole cabinet\
    \ shook and quivered. She plunged her hand in, unerringly striking toward a hiding\
    \ place she knew of from some past discovery. Then held it toward him in speechless\
    \ portent. Within it was rimmed a dusty cake, a pastille, of cheek rouge. She\
    \ threw it down, anathema. Again her hand burrowed into secretive recesses of\
    \ the drawer. She held up, this time, a cluster of slender, spindly cigars. She\
    \ showed him, flung them from her. Her hands went up overhead, quivered there\
    \ aloft, vibrant with doom and malediction, calling the blind skies to witness.\
    \ She intoned in a blood-curdling voice, like some Old Testament prophetess calling\
    \ down apocalyptic judgment. 'They's been a bad woman living in your house! They's\
    \ been a stranger sleeping in your bed!'\u201D \u2014 Cornell Woolrich, Waltz\
