  text: 'The imminent UK release (on Pansy Cradledew''s birthday!) of uberCatholic
    Melvin Gibson''s blood-drenched and preposterous The Passion of the Christ prompts
    us to recommend some films you might prefer to see.

    The Stepford Hives Ecological horror about a swarm of brainwashed bees.

    Where B-Girls Dare A crack squad of floozies storms a Nazi fortress.

    Apocalypse Cow Drug-crazed American soldiers go crazy in a barnyard.

    The Wild Bench Action picture set in a municipal park.

    Quatermass And The Git Sci-fi classic in which a sordid old man is found buried
    in a London Underground station.

    The Hound of Music Austrian singing dog drama.

    Close Encounters of the Bird Kind Richard Dreyfuss as a scruffy, obsessed ornithologist.

    Bring Me The Shed of Alfredo GarciaV iolent revenge thriller set in a garden centre.

    And not forgetting:

    Waterpostman Director''s cut of two Kevin Costner triumphs. A man swims through
    a post-nuclear nightmare delivering soaking wet letters.

    This paragraph is an hommage a Max Decharne. Max''s book Hardboiled Hollywood
    : The Origins of the Great Crime Films (No Exit Press) is available in all good
    bookshops, and from that online one named after a big river.'
