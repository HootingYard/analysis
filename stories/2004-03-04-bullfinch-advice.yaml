  text: "As a service to all those readers who have a bullfinch to feed, I have consulted\
    \ that invaluable reference work Enquire Within Upon Everything (1856 edition),\
    \ which tells us: \u201COld birds should be fed with German Paste No. 2, and occasionally\
    \ rape-seed. The Germans occasionally give them a little poppy-seed, and a grain\
    \ or two of rice, steeped in Canary wine, when teaching them to pipe, as a reward\
    \ for the progress they make. Bird organs, or flageolots, are used to teach them.\u201D\
    \ Didn't the Victorians use a lot of commas? Note that no information is given\
    \ about the feeding of young bullfinches, which I would have thought would be\
    \ a more urgent matter. If you are one of the few readers who does not have a\
    \ bullfinch to feed, but wish to obtain one, this is what they look like:\n\n\
    Two bullfinches : only feed German Paste No. 2 to the one on the left\nNow, having\
    \ installed your bullfinch in suitable accommodation, you will be wondering where\
    \ to get your German Paste No. 2. I recommend Joseph Sterry & Sons, \u201Cmanufacturers\
    \ of poor man's plaisters and German Paste\u201D, 2 Mint Street (opposite St George's\
    \ church) Borough High Street, London SE. Last time I checked, in 1873, the business\
    \ was thriving. While you are there, pick up some of their poor man's plaisters\
    \ in case your bullfinch pecks you with its fierce, lacerating beak or attacks\
    \ you with its talons, which it may well do if you mistakenly feed it German Paste\
    \ No. 1, or indeed No. 46."
