  text: 'The television arm of the Hooting Yard Foundation is currently developing
    a drama series based on the detective stories of F X Duggleby. Fans of his fiction
    will know that DCI Gruesome is irascible, vain, hirsute, and mordant, that he
    keeps a colony of fruitbats in his attic, and that he invariably solves his crimes
    using a ratiocinative method similar to--if not wholly plagiarised from--M. P.
    Shiel''s Prince Zaleski. (Duggleby goes so far as to have the DCI spend long hours
    loitering in a gazebo.) His assistant, Sgt Turgid--highly-strung, imprudent, bedizened,
    yet valiant, a keen Reader''s Digest reader--bears a striking resemblance to Frankenstein''s
    monster. In the first book of Duggleby''s series, The Murder of the Murderous
    Murderer, he is described thus: "His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of
    muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his
    teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast
    with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets
    in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips.
    His voice, when at last he spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression
    and lacking any variation in tone or cadence." I mention this because the casting
    director is completely stumped, having failed to persuade veteran Eric Sykes and
    Melvin "Mad Max" Gibson to take the lead roles. If readers have any suggestions,
    please send them in at once. Shooting begins next week.'
