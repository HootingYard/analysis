  text: "The television arm of the Hooting Yard Foundation is currently developing\
    \ a drama series based on the detective stories of F X Duggleby. Fans of his fiction\
    \ will know that DCI Gruesome is irascible, vain, hirsute, and mordant, that he\
    \ keeps a colony of fruitbats in his attic, and that he invariably solves his\
    \ crimes using a ratiocinative method similar to\u2014if not wholly plagiarised\
    \ from\u2014M. P. Shiel's Prince Zaleski. (Duggleby goes so far as to have the\
    \ DCI spend long hours loitering in a gazebo.) His assistant, Sgt Turgid\u2014\
    highly-strung, imprudent, bedizened, yet valiant, a keen Reader's Digest reader\u2014\
    bears a striking resemblance to Frankenstein's monster. In the first book of Duggleby's\
    \ series, The Murder of the Murderous Murderer, he is described thus: \u201CHis\
    \ yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair\
    \ was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\
    \ luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed\
    \ almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his\
    \ shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips. His voice, when at last\
    \ he spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking\
    \ any variation in tone or cadence.\u201D I mention this because the casting director\
    \ is completely stumped, having failed to persuade veteran Eric Sykes and Melvin\
    \ \u201CMad Max\u201D Gibson to take the lead roles. If readers have any suggestions,\
    \ please send them in at once. Shooting begins next week."
