  text: "\u201CCrikey!\u201D exclaimed Istvan, as he pulled the lever on the incomprehensible\
    \ big magnetic robot.\n\u201CThat's a turn up for the book,\u201D observed his\
    \ twin brother Zoltan.\n\u201CAnd what book would that be?\u201D asked Istvan,\
    \ as the incomprehensible big magnetic robot clanked & whirred into action. Thumping\
    \ & minatory, it began to cross the buttercup-splattered meadow in which this\
    \ exciting scene takes place. It made Istvan think of a Golem, such was its implacable\
    \ menace.\n\u201CWhat do you know of literature?\u201D sneered Zoltan, but Istvan\
    \ was already rummaging in his brother's satchel. Moments later, he held triumphantly\
    \ aloft a dog-eared paperback. Zoltan eyed him closely. \u201CYour arm shot up\
    \ in phallic conspiracy,\u201D he quoted. Istvan examined the curiously stained\
    \ cover of the book. He was severely myopic. Eventually he managed to discern\
    \ the title: Pestilence & Farm Implements\u2014Number 8 in a Series of Dog-Eared\
    \ Paperbacks by Vercingetorix Sepulveda.\n\u201CMay I borrow this?\u201D he asked.\n\
    \u201CCertainly not!\u201D shouted Zoltan.\n\u201CI knew you would always forbid,\u201D\
    \ said Istvan, making a clever riposte with a quotation of his own. Splendid clouds\
    \ passed across the battering sun.\n\u201CLook out!\u201D screamed Zoltan. But\
    \ it was too late. The incomprehensible big magnetic robot had turned & was bearing\
    \ down on Istvan. It had somehow acquired a gleaming & very, very sharp cutlass\u2026\
