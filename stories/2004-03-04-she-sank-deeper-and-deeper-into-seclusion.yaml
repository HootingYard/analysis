  text: '"She sank deeper and deeper into seclusion, and during the twenty-seven years
    she lived in Rome she left her home in the Via del Babuino only once for twenty-four
    hours. She grew more and more immersed in the Church and its affairs. Gregororius
    said she fairly ''sputtered spirituality''. Her chief work was a twenty-four-volume
    study bearing the thrilling title, Interior Causes of the Exterior Weakness of
    the Church. This ponderous affair she finished a few days before her death." --
    Rupert Hughes, The Love Affairs of Great Musicians, on Franz Liszt''s lover Princess
    Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein'
