  text: '"And how are we going to describe his hair? The yellowish-white powdery strands
    were coiled on his scalp like Bram Stoker''s Dracula''s peruke, not maintained
    since Prince Vlad the Impaler fought off the Turks in the Carpathian mountains
    in 1462. What does it say about a man that he could go around like that, as Burgess
    did? Though he was a king of the comb-over (did the clumps and fronds emanate
    from his ear-hole?), no professional barber can be blamed for this. I thought
    to myself, he has no idea how strange he is. What did he think he looked like?
    He evidently operated on his own head with a pair of garden shears." -- Roger
    Lewis, Anthony Burgess'
