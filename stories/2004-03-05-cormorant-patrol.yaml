  text: 'The four hundred men and women of the Blister Lane Cormorant Patrol brandished
    their pencil sharpeners, toffee apples, and inaccurate atlases as they reached
    the peak of the tor after marching all day. Below them, beyond the pig huts, the
    curiously-stained bridge, and the abandoned swimming baths, they were just able
    to see, shrouded in mist, the famous (or infamous) Wotan and Tantalum ponds, so
    dried up after successive droughts that they were now little more than puddles.

    "Onwards!" cried Captain Federico ''Gwyneth'' Paltrow, undisputed leader of the
    Cormorant Patrol and the man whose stupendous energy had helped it thrive even
    through such lean times. Seldom has a puny and diminutive physiognomy been so
    misleading.

    And so began their descent. Three quarters of the way down, the newest recruit,
    fey young Daisy ''Ricardo'' Montalban, stopped in her tracks, pointed, and yelled
    out: "Look! Look! Something with a beak and feathers!" And indeed, as they peered
    through the enshrouding mist, the others saw it too, perched on the branch of
    a withered pugton tree sprouting hopelessly on the banks of one of the ponds,
    or puddles. Excitedly, they began running, capering and gambolling down the muddy
    slope of the tor. But as they closed upon their prey, they realised it was not
    a cormorant at all. It was a little bittern.
