  text: "In addition to the detective drama Gruesome & Turgid (see yesterday), the\
    \ Hooting Yard television empire is pleased to announce that it has acquired the\
    \ rights to an astounding collection of films. All of these listed below will\
    \ be shown on the Crunlop Channel over the coming months. Our cinema critic, P.\
    \ B. Totnes, will be reviewing as many of them as he can. As he views each film,\
    \ his doubtless astute and piercing comments will be added, indicated by a hyperlink.\n\
    Rusty Flasks; The Apothecary's Safety Pin; The Subfusc Gargoyle; Hand Me That\
    \ Chaffinch; Topiary & Miscegenation; The Gutta-Percha Pail; The Vivid Swamp (for\
    \ me, Barbra Streisand's finest hour); The Pitiful Teacup; To Smooch & Smooch\
    \ Again; The Baleful Rhinoceros; Four Hundred Wooden Hens; Plankton Nightmare\
    \ (I particularly liked the grainy, black & white opening shot of a flock of bitterns);\
    \ The Crumpled Ships; The Queasy Hotel (spooky!!!); The Pathetic Ornithologist;\
    \ The Flapping Windsock; Ointments of Incomprehensibility; I Wore My Hats Ineptly;\
    \ Custard Gas Attack; Flailing Shibboleths; Journey to the Planet of Indigestion\
    \ (superb!); The Wretched Spoon; A Placebo for Istvan; The Hideous Orchard; The\
    \ Marooned Squirrel (surely the film of the decade); Pencil Cases in the Antarctic;\
    \ Thousands upon Thousands of Wrens; The Pointless Torch; Corncrake! (\u201CMelvin\
    \ Gibson's Braveheart pales in comparison\u201D, said Vanity Fair); The Tatterdemalion\
    \ Hobbledehoy (which ought to have won a prize for its matchless animal-handling,\
    \ what with all those stoats, weasels, bison, panthers & geese); The Big Magnetic\
    \ Robot; The Antiseptic Xylophone; Snip Those Auburn Locks; I Was Puny Vercingetorix;\
    \ The Chuckling Maniac (appalling\u2014not a bit scary); The Cantankerous Optician;\
    \ Jimmy Connors in Hell (nothing to do with the tennis player, apparently); Forty\
    \ Years In A Bauxite Mine (my favourite foreign-language film of the year, despite\
    \ the lack of subtitles); The Ridiculous Sponge; Rubber Beelzebub; Tea-strainers\
    \ in Jeopardy; The Tall Nun Goes West (the finest Gerard Manley Hopkins adaptation\
    \ I've ever seen); Stalin Wore A Cardigan; Ornate & Lavish Buoys (tiresome four-hour\
    \ documentary); The Tiny Cakes; The Incredible Case of the Disparaged Chutney\
    \ Recipe; Splendid Muck; and Weird Birds (a remake of the Van Heflin masterpiece)."
