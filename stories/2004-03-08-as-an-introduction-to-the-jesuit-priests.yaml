  text: '"As an introduction to the Jesuit priest''s choreography, Kahn performed
    Overwhelmed, an expressionistic evocation of a dark emotional state that suggested
    sacred dance only in a few gestures of prayer. Set to a recording of prepared
    piano music by John Cage, the brief piece ended with the exhausted dancer lying
    in a heap as the stage darkened. When the lights came up, Kahn had disappeared,
    and VerEecke had taken her place in the same crumpled position. Rising from the
    floor, he cried out to God, ran around the periphery of the stage and pounded
    his fists against the rear wall. His cries of the heart were picked up and developed
    in lyrical movements by ten dancers who had learned the graceful choreography
    in VerEecke''s workshop." -- Wilma Salisbury, dance critic, The Plain Dealer July
    1999'
