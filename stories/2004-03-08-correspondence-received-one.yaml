  text: "Sir : Idly browsing your website the other day (attracted, like so many others,\
    \ by the mention of Xavier Cugat in your Search Engine Lure), I was touched to\
    \ see a reference to my current book in connection with your list of films such\
    \ as Apocalypse Cow and The Hound of Music. May I also draw your attention to\
    \ the following lesser-known highlights of the film-maker's art:\nDr Jekyll and\
    \ Mr Hyde Park \u2013 the ill-fated follow up to The Wild Bench, in which a park\
    \ attendant is pushed beyond the limits of endurance.\nI Spit on Your Gravy \u2013\
    \ Fear and retribution behind the scenes at a top-class restaurant.\nBlackhead\
    \ Jungle \u2013 Acne-crazed youths on the rampage.\nOn Her Majesty's Crown Derby\
    \ Service (aka China Girl) \u2013 Tense spy thriller in which James Bond foils\
    \ a plot to steal a collection of priceless dinner plates from Buckingham Palace.\n\
    20,000 Leagues Under the Sea \u2013 Sub-aqua football at its most thrilling.\n\
    Dr Terror's House of Horace \u2013 Unwary travellers are kidnapped and force-fed\
    \ the works of the Roman poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus.\nWhen Dinah Shore Ruled\
    \ The Earth \u2013 Absolutely terrifying prehistoric jazz adventure.\nI beg to\
    \ remain etc.,\n    Max D\xE9charn\xE9"
