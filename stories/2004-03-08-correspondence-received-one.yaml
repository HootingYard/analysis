  text: "Sir : Idly browsing your website the other day (attracted, like so many others,\
    \ by the mention of Xavier Cugat in your Search Engine Lure), I was touched to\
    \ see a reference to my current book in connection with your list of films such\
    \ as Apocalypse Cow and The Hound of Music. May I also draw your attention to\
    \ the following lesser-known highlights of the film-maker's art:\nDr Jekyll and\
    \ Mr Hyde Park - the ill-fated follow up to The Wild Bench, in which a park attendant\
    \ is pushed beyond the limits of endurance.\nI Spit on Your Gravy - Fear and retribution\
    \ behind the scenes at a top-class restaurant.\nBlackhead Jungle - Acne-crazed\
    \ youths on the rampage.\nOn Her Majesty's Crown Derby Service (aka China Girl)\
    \ - Tense spy thriller in which James Bond foils a plot to steal a collection\
    \ of priceless dinner plates from Buckingham Palace.\n20,000 Leagues Under the\
    \ Sea - Sub-aqua football at its most thrilling.\nDr Terror's House of Horace\
    \ - Unwary travellers are kidnapped and force-fed the works of the Roman poet\
    \ Quintus Horatius Flaccus.\nWhen Dinah Shore Ruled The Earth - Absolutely terrifying\
    \ prehistoric jazz adventure.\nI beg to remain etc.,\n    Max Decharne"
