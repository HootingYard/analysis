  text: "An unsigned email arrives from (I surmise) New York City, regarding the Father\
    \ Hopkins SJ adaptation The Tall Nun Goes West (see \u201CFilms On Television\u201D\
    , 5th March):\nDear Sir : Please provide air date and time for the referenced\
    \ feature. While I agree with you that it is the most faithful of the many Hopkins\
    \ adaptations, I have a deep personal affection for The Cheery Beggar, despite\
    \ the unfortunate miscasting of Aldo Ray as the Polynesian sponge-diver. Thank\
    \ you for your consideration.\nI am afraid that the schedule has not yet been\
    \ finalised, so cannot say when this majestic piece of cimema will be shown. One\
    \ point about The Cheery Beggar which my anonymous correspondent does not mention\
    \ is that the film marked the screen debut of the great child Method actor Tad\
    \ Wensleydale. At the age of seven, he had already taken Broadway by storm with\
    \ his performances as Shylock, Lear, Mrs Miniver, Torquemada, Mike Hammer, Louis\
    \ Pasteur and Clytemnestra, among others. Six years later, on the cusp of teenage\
    \ hobbledehoyhood, his meteoric career was effectively over, but not before he\
    \ had appeared in a second Hopkins adaptation, Felix Randal The Farrier. Wensleydale\
    \ was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the \u201Cbig-boned and hardy-handsome\u201D\
    \ title character, stone dead at the beginning of the film, but the award that\
    \ year went to Ricardo Montalban."
