  text: 'A number of readers, enamoured of the thrilling adventures of Istvan and
    Zoltan chronicled here over the past week or so, have asked if any pictures exist
    of the duo. Long hours rooting and rummaging in the Hooting Yard Photographic
    Library, (to be found on the mezzanine floor of the Big Damp Building pitched
    so perplexingly on the lethal slopes of Pang Hill), eventually brought to light
    one of the notorious "ghost photographs" taken by Dobson. According to a scribbled
    note on the back, this may be the only pictorial record of the twins.
