  text: "It is, I think, reasonably well-known* that Ambrose Bierce vanished at the\
    \ age of 71 (in 1913) on his way to the civil war in Mexico, never to be seen\
    \ again. What I did not learn until the other day was that he was one of thirteen\
    \ children, all of whom, at the whim of his father, were given names beginning\
    \ with A. If any reader knows the names of his dozen siblings, please let me know.\n\
    * NOTE : I am careful to write \u201CI think, reasonably well-known\u201D as opposed\
    \ to the magisterial \u201Ceverybody knows\u201D. A particularly splendid example\
    \ of the latter appeared in the Guardian recently. A. S. Byatt wrote: \u201Cmost\
    \ people know [Sir Charles Sherrington's] description of the waking brain as \u2018\
    an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern\u2026\
    \u2019\u201D (my emphasis). If readers have favourite examples of such absurd\
    \ pomposity, please send them in."
