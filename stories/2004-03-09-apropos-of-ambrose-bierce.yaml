  text: 'It is, I think, reasonably well-known* that Ambrose Bierce vanished at the
    age of 71 (in 1913) on his way to the civil war in Mexico, never to be seen again.
    What I did not learn until the other day was that he was one of thirteen children,
    all of whom, at the whim of his father, were given names beginning with A. If
    any reader knows the names of his dozen siblings, please let me know.

    * NOTE : I am careful to write "I think, reasonably well-known" as opposed to
    the magisterial "everybody knows". A particularly splendid example of the latter
    appeared in the Guardian recently. A. S. Byatt wrote: "most people know [Sir Charles
    Sherrington''s] description of the waking brain as ''an enchanted loom where millions
    of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern...''" (my emphasis). If readers
    have favourite examples of such absurd pomposity, please send them in.'
