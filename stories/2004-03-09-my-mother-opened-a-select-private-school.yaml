  text: '"My mother opened a select private school for instruction in the art of changing
    the spots upon leopard-skin rugs; my eldest brother, George Henry, who had a turn
    for music, became a bugler in a neighbouring asylum for deaf mutes; my sister,
    Mary Maria, took orders for Professor Pumpernickel''s Essence of Latchkeys for
    flavouring mineral springs; and I set up as an adjuster and gilder of crossbeams
    for gibbets. The other children, too young for labour, continued to steal small
    articles exposed in front of shops, as they had been taught. In our intervals
    of leisure we decoyed travellers into our house and buried the bodies in a cellar."
