  text: This year's Dobson Memorial Lecture was delivered by Kurt Chodd, a bungling
    amateur from the Land of Swans. Attendance at the converted pig hut in the grounds
    of the toothpaste factory at the Port of Tongs was sparse, but those desiccated
    few who did turn up--sorry, I meant "dedicated" -- were treated to a fascinating
    talk on The Administration of Lighthouses.
