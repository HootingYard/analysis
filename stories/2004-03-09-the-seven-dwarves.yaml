  text: "Is nothing sacred? In this age of pointless but seemingly obsessive rebranding,\
    \ news reaches us that Snow White's diminutive pals, the seven dwarves, are to\
    \ be given new names. From next Friday, apparently, they are to be known as Wretched,\
    \ Spiteful, Incontinent, Wistful, Lippy, Rancorous & Preening.\nOn a related note,\
    \ Pansy Cradledew has brought to my attention the growing debate over the identity\
    \ of the \u201CEighth Dwarf\u201D, akin to the long-running argument as to who\
    \ exactly deserves the title of the \u201CFifth Beatle\u201D. Pansy hopes to bring\
    \ us the latest news on this important subject very, very soon."
