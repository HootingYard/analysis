  text: 'Yesterday''s quotation of the day, Wilma Salisbury''s terrific description
    of a dance by Father Bob VerEecke, included a link to a page about the terpsichorean
    Jesuit. What was lacking, however, was a photograph of our hero in action. Here
    he is:


    Not only that. Pansy Cradledew has unearthed a tremendous picture of Father Bob''s
    workshop. She says: "Isn''t it marvellous? Apart from his preposterous gestures,
    the startled way his students seem to be staring (or trying not to stare!) at
    him is priceless." You''ll find this treasure, next to a big caption saying "Dancing
    In The Spirit Of The Season", at the Boston College Chronicle.'
