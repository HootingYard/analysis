  text: "\u201CI do not think it is wise to wear bracelets when playing unless they\
    \ are plain and tight to the wrist. Although you might not think it, ornaments,\
    \ however small, can and do get in your way. I remember one match that was entirely\
    \ lost because of the presence of a gold curb bracelet with a small dangling chain\
    \ attached. Putting up her hand to adjust a hairpin, the owner did not know that\
    \ the chain had caught on to her fringe-net, and, bringing her hand down quickly,\
    \ the fringe-net and most of the hairpins were dragged from her hair. The result\
    \ was that the player, who might easily have left the court and fixed up her hair\
    \ again firmly, adjusted it as best she could, her hair blowing about in all directions.\
    \ In between every stroke she had to clutch wildly at stray portions that blew\
    \ across her face and into her eyes. This diversion naturally upset her game,\
    \ and I think that was the last time she wore a bracelet in court.\u201D \u2014\
    \ Mrs Lambert Chambers, Lawn Tennis For Ladies (1910)"
