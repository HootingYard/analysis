  text: '"I do not think it is wise to wear bracelets when playing unless they are
    plain and tight to the wrist. Although you might not think it, ornaments, however
    small, can and do get in your way. I remember one match that was entirely lost
    because of the presence of a gold curb bracelet with a small dangling chain attached.
    Putting up her hand to adjust a hairpin, the owner did not know that the chain
    had caught on to her fringe-net, and, bringing her hand down quickly, the fringe-net
    and most of the hairpins were dragged from her hair. The result was that the player,
    who might easily have left the court and fixed up her hair again firmly, adjusted
    it as best she could, her hair blowing about in all directions. In between every
    stroke she had to clutch wildly at stray portions that blew across her face and
    into her eyes. This diversion naturally upset her game, and I think that was the
    last time she wore a bracelet in court." -- Mrs Lambert Chambers, Lawn Tennis
    For Ladies (1910)'
