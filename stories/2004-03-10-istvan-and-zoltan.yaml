  text: 'On Monday 8th March we published one of Dobson''s so-called "ghost photographs",
    thought to be the only extant picture of those tiresome yet strangely attractive
    twins, Istvan & Zoltan, whose madcap escapades have thrilled a handful of readers.
    But Dr Ruth Pastry has news for us. "I was clearing out one of the leisure-and-relaxation
    module-compartments in my space-age home," she writes, "to make room for my new
    collection of The Passion Of The Christ-related merchandise, when I came upon
    a little book called Jimmy At The Seaside by Neville Main, published by the Brockhampton
    Press in 1949. Imagine my surprise when, leafing through it, my eyes fell upon
    some pictures of twins who bear a striking resemblance to your dashing duo. They
    may be given different names in Mr Main''s ur-text, but surely these are Istvan
    and Zoltan avant le lettre? I claim my five pounds."
