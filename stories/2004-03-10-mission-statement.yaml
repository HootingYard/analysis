  text: "This site is nearly three months old, and it has been suggested that it cannot\
    \ long continue without a definitive Mission Statement. Below is a first draft,\
    \ the fruit of long minutes spent cogitating while wolfing down a bowl of Special\
    \ K. I suggest that readers copy and paste it into a word-processor document,\
    \ print it out, get it laminated, and\u2014whenever visiting Hooting Yard\u2014\
    place it next to the screen for ready reference.\nWe will find a window in our\
    \ schedule to take a proactive approach to thinking outside the box, pushing the\
    \ envelope and running things up the flagpole 24/7, like totally. Pick the bones\
    \ out of that one, innit. It's not rocket science\u2014it's a no-brainer."
