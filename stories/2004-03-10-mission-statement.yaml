  text: 'This site is nearly three months old, and it has been suggested that it cannot
    long continue without a definitive Mission Statement. Below is a first draft,
    the fruit of long minutes spent cogitating while wolfing down a bowl of Special
    K. I suggest that readers copy and paste it into a word-processor document, print
    it out, get it laminated, and--whenever visiting Hooting Yard--place it next to
    the screen for ready reference.

    We will find a window in our schedule to take a proactive approach to thinking
    outside the box, pushing the envelope and running things up the flagpole 24/7,
    like totally. Pick the bones out of that one, innit. It''s not rocket science--it''s
    a no-brainer.'
