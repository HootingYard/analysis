  text: 'Dear Frank : Mention of Joost Van Dongelbracke, the Suburban Shaman (24th
    & 26th February) reminded me of Mama Donna, a wonderful urban shaman I stayed
    with in New York. Hooting Yard readers may find the information below of some
    use if they ever happen to be wandering around Brooklyn looking for an interesting
    tea room, or are looking for their inner Goddesses, or both.

    Velma Nebraska, globe-trotting Hooting Yard reporter

    Donna Henes, Urban Shaman, is a contemporary ceremonialist specializing in multi-cultural
    ritual celebration of the cycles of the seasons and the seasons of our lives.
    She is the author of The Queen of My Self, The Moon Watcher''s Companion, Celestially
    Auspicious Occasions, and Dressing Our Wounds In Warm Clothes, as well as the
    CD, Reverence To Her: Mythology, The Matriarchy & Me. She is also the editor and
    publisher of the highly acclaimed quarterly journal Always In Season: Living In
    Sync with the Cycles. In 1982, she composed the first (and to this date, the only)
    satellite peace message in space: "chants for peace * chance for peace". Mama
    Donna, as she is affectionately known, has offered lectures, workshops, circles,
    and celebrations worldwide for 30 years. She is the director of Mama Donna''s
    Tea Garden & Healing Haven, a ceremonial center, ritual consultancy and spirit
    shop in Exotic Brooklyn, New York. For further information, a list of services
    and publications, a calendar of upcoming events and a complimentary issue of Always
    in Season: Living in Sync with the Cycles

    contact: Mama Donna''s Tea Garden & Healing Haven, PO Box 380403 Exotic Brooklyn,
    NY 11238-0403 U.S.A. or visit http://www.DonnaHenes.net and http://www.TheQueenofMySelf.com

    Many thanks for that, Velma. I have obtained a dozen copies of Dressing Our Wounds
    In Warm Clothes (which sounds more like the work of a solicitous and fussy parent
    preparing their tot for school on a wintry morning) to be given away, with a special
    Hooting Yard combination balaclava-and-bandage, to the first twelve readers who
    write in with their own, original tips for living in sync.'
