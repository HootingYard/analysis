  text: "Dear Frank : Mention of Joost Van Dongelbracke, the Suburban Shaman (24th\
    \ & 26th February) reminded me of Mama Donna, a wonderful urban shaman I stayed\
    \ with in New York. Hooting Yard readers may find the information below of some\
    \ use if they ever happen to be wandering around Brooklyn looking for an interesting\
    \ tea room, or are looking for their inner Goddesses, or both.\nVelma Nebraska,\
    \ globe-trotting Hooting Yard reporter\nDonna Henes, Urban Shaman, is a contemporary\
    \ ceremonialist specializing in multi-cultural ritual celebration of the cycles\
    \ of the seasons and the seasons of our lives. She is the author of The Queen\
    \ of My Self, The Moon Watcher's Companion, Celestially Auspicious Occasions,\
    \ and Dressing Our Wounds In Warm Clothes, as well as the CD, Reverence To Her:\
    \ Mythology, The Matriarchy & Me. She is also the editor and publisher of the\
    \ highly acclaimed quarterly journal Always In Season: Living In Sync with the\
    \ Cycles. In 1982, she composed the first (and to this date, the only) satellite\
    \ peace message in space: \u201Cchants for peace * chance for peace\u201D. Mama\
    \ Donna, as she is affectionately known, has offered lectures, workshops, circles,\
    \ and celebrations worldwide for 30 years. She is the director of Mama Donna's\
    \ Tea Garden & Healing Haven, a ceremonial center, ritual consultancy and spirit\
    \ shop in Exotic Brooklyn, New York. For further information, a list of services\
    \ and publications, a calendar of upcoming events and a complimentary issue of\
    \ Always in Season: Living in Sync with the Cycles\ncontact: Mama Donna's Tea\
    \ Garden & Healing Haven, PO Box 380403 Exotic Brooklyn, NY 11238-0403 U.S.A.\
    \ or visit http://www.DonnaHenes.net and http://www.TheQueenofMySelf.com\nMany\
    \ thanks for that, Velma. I have obtained a dozen copies of Dressing Our Wounds\
    \ In Warm Clothes (which sounds more like the work of a solicitous and fussy parent\
    \ preparing their tot for school on a wintry morning) to be given away, with a\
    \ special Hooting Yard combination balaclava-and-bandage, to the first twelve\
    \ readers who write in with their own, original tips for living in sync."
