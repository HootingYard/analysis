    \ Unless the culprit owns up by the end of the day, the whole readership will\
    \ stay behind and polish the Buttons of Beb--every last one of them!\nDear Sir\
    \ : Idly perusing your website today, whilst clinging unsteadily to a flagpole,\
    \ gripping my laptop in my teeth and attempting to push several envelopes into\
    \ the telephone box attached to the top, I couldn't help noticing your Mission\
    \ Statement (10th March). Surely, I thought to myself, there are lessons here\
    \ for us all, innit. As a result, I have revised my life's goals, abandoned my\
    \ attempts to understand traditional Japanese theatre - surely the ultimate Noh-brainer\
    \ - and returned to my first love: designing V2 missiles and working for NASA.\
    \ It is, after all, rocket science.\nYrs etc,\n    Werner von Braun\nPlease note\
    \ that while one foolish reader has been frittering their time away on this counterfeit,\
    \ here in the serried belvederes of Haemoglobin Towers we have embarked upon the\
    \ important task of devising a \"Mission Statement Lite\", which will be launched\
    \ soon."
