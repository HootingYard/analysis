  text: "Someone has been forging correspondence from a dead German aeronautical engineer.\
    \ Unless the culprit owns up by the end of the day, the whole readership will\
    \ stay behind and polish the Buttons of Beb\u2014every last one of them!\nDear\
    \ Sir : Idly perusing your website today, whilst clinging unsteadily to a flagpole,\
    \ gripping my laptop in my teeth and attempting to push several envelopes into\
    \ the telephone box attached to the top, I couldn't help noticing your Mission\
    \ Statement (10th March). Surely, I thought to myself, there are lessons here\
    \ for us all, innit. As a result, I have revised my life's goals, abandoned my\
    \ attempts to understand traditional Japanese theatre \u2013 surely the ultimate\
    \ Noh-brainer \u2013 and returned to my first love: designing V2 missiles and\
    \ working for NASA. It is, after all, rocket science.\nYrs etc,\n    Werner von\
    \ Braun\nPlease note that while one foolish reader has been frittering their time\
    \ away on this counterfeit, here in the serried belvederes of Haemoglobin Towers\
    \ we have embarked upon the important task of devising a \u201CMission Statement\
    \ Lite\u201D, which will be launched soon."
