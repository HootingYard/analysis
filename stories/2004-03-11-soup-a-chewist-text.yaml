  text: '(For a definition of Chewism, see 2nd March)

    The subject of today''s harangue is the preparation of soup, so pin back your
    nasty fat little purple ears and listen carefully. The following directions will
    be found generally applicable, so that there will be no need to repeat the several
    details each time. In any case, I will distribute written notes later, and this
    time I am feeling magnanimous, so they will be legible. Seasonings are not specified,
    as these are a matter of individual taste and circumstance. Some people think
    I am overfond of very, very hot mustard, and thus blame me for everything from
    trivial lip-burns to years spent in a lazaretto--pah! Some from considerations
    of health or otherwise are forbidden the use of salt. Sissies. In such cases a
    little sugar will help to bring out the flavour of the vegetables, but unless
    all the members of the household are alike, it had best not be added before bringing
    to table. Anyway, at first glance salt and sugar look almost identical, so one
    ruse is to dim the lanterns or to light a batch of blubber-candles, the fumes
    from which will be acrid enough to divert your diners'' attention. Where soup
    is to be strained, whole pepper, mace, &c., is much preferable to ground, both
    as being free from adulteration, and giving all the flavour without the grit.
    Some soup recipes, of course, call for the inclusion of handfuls of grit, dust,
    and pavement grease, so bear that in mind. The water in which cauliflower, green
    peas, &c., have been boiled, should be added to the stock-pot, but as we are now
    recognising that all vegetables should be cooked as conservatively as possible--that
    is, by steaming, or in just as much water as they will absorb, so as not to waste
    the valuable salts and juices, there will not be much of such liquid in a ''Reform''
    menage. Any water you do use is best brought to kitchen in an iron pail direct
    from the closest duckpond, for springs and even wells harbour all sorts of tiny
    little beasties with far too many legs, and even wings, whereas all such creepy-crawlies
    will have been removed from a duckpond by the eating habits of hungry and none-too-fastidious
    ducks. A stock must therefore be made from fresh materials, but as those are comparatively
    inexpensive, we need not grudge having them of the freshest and best. Try never
    to eat anything that is more than five years old. Readers of Thackeray will remember
    the little dinner at Timmins, when the hired chef shed such consternation in the
    bosom of little Mrs Timmins by his outrageous demands for ''a leg of beef, a leg
    of veal, and a ham'', on behalf of the stock-pot. Those who do not know their
    Thackeray will wonder what in heaven''s name I am talking about, but the point
    is plain: every kitchen must have a bound set of Victorian novels--wrapped in
    greaseproof paper--to avert the unexpected.
