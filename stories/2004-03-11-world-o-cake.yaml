  text: 'Yesterday was the birthday of long-time Hooting Yard reader Chris Atton.
    To celebrate the event, Dr Ruth Pastry has supplied two more pictures by Neville
    Main, onlie begetter of Mat and Nat, the ur-Istvan and ur-Zoltan whose cheery
    countenances were featured yesterday. Today we have a monkey cutting a birthday
    cake which is gobbled up by ducks--that''s something you don''t see every day.
    (The captions suggest that the ducks only got the leftover crumbs, but I doubt
    it. Have you seen ducks eat?) The pictures are from Jimmy Goes To A Birthday Party
    (1950).


    If you would like your birthday to be celebrated on this site, please write to
    the address at the top of the page to request an application form. Returned forms
    will be scrutinised by a panel consisting of a mountebank, a zany, and a distinguished
    potato scientist (or similar).'
