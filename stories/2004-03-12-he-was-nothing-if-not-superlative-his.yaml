  text: '"He was nothing if not superlative: his diatribes, now culminating in a very
    extravaganza of hyperbole--now sailing with loose wing through the downy, witched,
    Dutch cloud-heaps of some quaintest tramontane Nephelococcugia of thought--now
    laying down law of the Medes for the actual world of to-day--had oft-times the
    strange effect of bringing back to my mind the very singular old-epic epithet,
    aenemoen--airy--as applied to human thought. The mere grip of his memory was not
    simply extraordinary, it had in it a token, a hint, of the strange, the pythic--nay,
    the sibylline. And as his reflecting intellect, moreover, had all the lightness
    of foot of a chamois kid, unless you could contrive to follow each dazzlingly
    swift successive step, by the sum of which he attained his Alp-heights, he inevitably
    left on you the astounding, the confounding impression of mental omnipresence."
