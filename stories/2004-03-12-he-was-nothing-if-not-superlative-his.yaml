  text: "\u201CHe was nothing if not superlative: his diatribes, now culminating in\
    \ a very extravaganza of hyperbole\u2014now sailing with loose wing through the\
    \ downy, witched, Dutch cloud-heaps of some quaintest tramontane Nephelococcugia\
    \ of thought\u2014now laying down law of the Medes for the actual world of to-day\u2014\
    had oft-times the strange effect of bringing back to my mind the very singular\
    \ old-epic epithet, aenemoen\u2014airy\u2014as applied to human thought. The mere\
    \ grip of his memory was not simply extraordinary, it had in it a token, a hint,\
    \ of the strange, the pythic\u2014nay, the sibylline. And as his reflecting intellect,\
    \ moreover, had all the lightness of foot of a chamois kid, unless you could contrive\
    \ to follow each dazzlingly swift successive step, by the sum of which he attained\
    \ his Alp-heights, he inevitably left on you the astounding, the confounding impression\
    \ of mental omnipresence.\u201D \u2014 M. P. Shiel, The Stone of the Edmundsbury\
