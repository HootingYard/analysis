  text: Yesterday we listed some of the things Pointy Town is famous for. Yet it is
    no Utopia. For instance, you will find in the town no trace whatsoever of quaintness,
    wry euphonium rehearsals, toffee, yoghurt, ululating idiots, ornithological paraphernalia,
    athletics, sawdust, dockyard flamboyance, gutters, hedgerows, jugglers, kissing
    lovers, zealous x-ray-eyed cadets, & "Visigoth"-brand nougat munchies. But who
    needs any of those things when there are great architectural marvels to be seen?
    One of the most striking and gigantic buildings in Pointy Town is the Old Wretched
    Flophouse. The principal front on the land side is considerably more than one-third
    of a Javan mile in length, and its wings, in depth, extend six hundred and seventy
    two feet, down to the edge of the Big Frightening River, this noble watercourse
    forming the fourth side of the quadrangle. Within the three sides (the Big Frightening
    River and two wings) are ranges of parallel buildings, which form the magazines,
    artificers' shops, mast and boat houses, offices, &c.; and in the area within
    these are four slips for building the largest, and two for the smaller class of
    Tugboats of Pointlessness. The whole of the outer range of buildings consists
    of lamentable suites of rooms, and long and filthily ornamented galleries, filled
    with the natural history and curiosities collected in every part of the globe,
    and brought by the different navigators which Pointy Town, of late years, has
    sent forth on discovery. In one room are assembled all the different nautical
    and mathematical instruments; in another all the models of toy brazil nuts of
    different nations and different eras; in another a complete library connected
    with every branch of both human and inhuman knowledge. The library's most treasured
    item is the manuscript of the first draft of Sepulveda's inane Lines Written Upon
    First Listening To 'Dr Bogenbroom' by Jethro Tull.
