  text: 'Reader Tim Thurn has complained that recent mentions of the film person Melvin
    Gibson, and more particularly his absurd The Passion Of The Christ (see 3rd &
    10th March, & passim), indicate that I have lost sight of the supreme importance
    of Kevin Costner to world cinema. Fear not, Tim! I may not have prostrated myself
    before my Costner-shrine of late, but I have not been idle. Indeed, today I am
    able to announce that scholars have at last identified the source-novel of Costner''s
    masterpiece:


    If you peer very closely at that upstairs window, behind the word EASY, you can
    just see a small mushroom cloud. Costner was, of course, faithful to the apocalyptic
    post-nuclear holocaust atmosphere of this fine book.'
