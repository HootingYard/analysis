  text: '"I am writing this in the saloon of the sailing ship, Homebird, and writing
    with but little hope of human eye ever seeing that which I write; for we are in
    the heart of the dread Sargasso Sea-- the Tideless Sea of the North Atlantic.
    From the stump of our mizzen mast, one may see, spread out to the far horizon,
    an interminable waste of weed--a treacherous, silent vastitude of slime and hideousness!"
