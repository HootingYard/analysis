  text: "\u201CI am writing this in the saloon of the sailing ship, Homebird, and\
    \ writing with but little hope of human eye ever seeing that which I write; for\
    \ we are in the heart of the dread Sargasso Sea\u2014 the Tideless Sea of the\
    \ North Atlantic. From the stump of our mizzen mast, one may see, spread out to\
    \ the far horizon, an interminable waste of weed\u2014a treacherous, silent vastitude\
    \ of slime and hideousness!\u201D \u2014William Hope Hodgson, From The Tideless\
    \ Sea"
