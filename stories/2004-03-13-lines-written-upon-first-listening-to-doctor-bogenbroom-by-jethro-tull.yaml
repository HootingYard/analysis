  text: "A poem by Vercingetorix Sepulveda\nO! Savage & vile & pink & bloated thing!\n\
    \    Curs'd uncanny globule of despair!\n    Monstrous, too! So pale & shuddering!\n\
    \    Its gleaming talons clawing at my hair!\nHast this being come t' announce\
    \ my doom?\n    Its head is like a chaffinch or a gull.\n    It has been sent\
    \ by Doctor Bogenbroom,\n    Invoked by minstrel-wizards Jethro Tull."
