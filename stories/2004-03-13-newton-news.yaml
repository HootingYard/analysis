  text: We last drew attention to Sir Isaac Newton on 16th December last year. Here
    is a further anecdote. Passing swiftly over the fact that his name is an anagram
    of "ironic swans eat", we ought also celebrate his powers of concentration. When
    his mind was fixed upon some knotty mathematical problem, as it so often was,
    he had great difficuly bestirring himself in the mornings. He was known to begin
    dressing, get one leg inside his breeches, then sit back down on the bed, lost
    in thought for hours upon hours. A proper caution, in other words.
