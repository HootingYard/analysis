  text: 'Seldom referred to these days, the so-called Beerpint Scandal* of 1977 is
    worth revisiting. Dennis Beerpint (brother of the poet Gervase) tells the story
    himself, in this previously unpublished memorandum, hurriedly scribbled on a piece
    of blotting paper and deposited in a credenza located in the boiler cupboard of
    the Museum of Moral Turpitude in Lewdbag.

    Hundreds of outraged citizens threw pebbles at me in the streets after I announced,
    in the pages of the Tungsten Railings Digest, that I had never been to the theatre,
    that wild horses, nor indeed any other savage beasts of the field, would fain
    drag me to the theatre, and that I had no intention of going to the theatre, ever,
    full stop, end of, BAM! When, every evening, I kneel down to lavish praise upon
    my Maker, my most earnest prayer is that icy claws shall hug me to the bosom of
    Death rather than that I be propelled through the gaudy doors of the playhouse.
    Is this so grave a crime that I should be pelted with missiles? I can only surmise
    that the hot-headed reaction of the townsfolk was occasioned by my tenure, for
    many long years, as drama critic of the Weekly Shackle. Of course I had never
    seen any of the thousands of productions I reviewed in its august, if tatty, pages.
    Given an assignment by my editor, I would note down the play-title on a scrap
    of paper, place it under my pillow, and dream it. I ask you, humbly--is that so
    wrong?

    * NOTE : Given the decade in which it occurred, it is a wonder that this scandal
    was never called "Beerpintgate" (see "Nixon", 26th February).'
