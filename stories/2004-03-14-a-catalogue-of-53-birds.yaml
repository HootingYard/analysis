  text: "The Godwit. Like Italo Calvino, the godwit has a seething hatred of cement.\
    \ It has been known to burrow. Prone to desperate sneezing, the godwit chews dandelions\
    \ & lacks any sense of pottery.\nThe Wan Clump. An extraordinary bird, the wan\
    \ clump is best known for its habit of swooping upon film premieres attended by\
    \ the likes of Cloris Leachman, Troy Donahue & Tab Hunter. But not Tuesday Weld.\n\
    Third bird. The Quint. Vercingetorix Sepulveda wrote about quints in one of his\
    \ majestic tracts. Unfortunately, scholars have to date been unable to read any\
    \ of them, as his penmanship was execrable.\nThe Lopwit. Omitted from most biographies\
    \ of Ezra Pound is the startling fact that he was an indefatigable trapper of\
    \ lopwits. Such was his mania that he was fired from the joint US-Italian Lopwit\
    \ Monitoring Committee in 1949.\nThe Tult. Sadly, the tult is an irrelevant bird.\n\
    The Fristiglip. What a joy to behold a flock of fristiglips on the wing, as they\
    \ set off on their annual migration from Penge to Uttoxeter!\nThe Snote. The following\
    \ is a quotation from Eric Wheat's \u201CNotes On That Bad Man Dobson & Some Birds\u201D\
    : \u201CThis morning on my way to church I noted the nest of a snote atop the\
    \ timber-framed hut in which the malefactor Dobson plots his dark deeds. The nest\
    \ was empty. Yet upon my return from worship, it was absolutely crammed with innumerable\
    \ sickly snotes.\u201D\nThe Churter. The churter is able to mimic the sound of\
    \ klaxons, sirens & tocsins, but does not often do so. It feeds on dew & flax.\n\
    The Arpad. Many top ornithologists contend that the arpad is a kind of nightjar.\
    \ Certainly its beak & wings give that impression. Arpads, both in flight & roosting,\
    \ have been a popular subject for recent postage stamps in Finland.\nThe Hoogoo.\
    \ There are a number of interesting facts about the hoogoo, a tiny bird much smaller\
    \ than the wren, or even the hummingbird. The hoogoo is, as far as I know, the\
    \ only bird which has magnetic feet. For this reason, hoogoos avoid sites such\
    \ as ironworks, blacksmiths, smelting yards, tin mines & other locations of metallurgical\
    \ interest.\nThe Pale Auk. Aerodynamically unsound, the pale auk is only capable\
    \ of flight on Wednesdays, except Ash Wednesday. Its characteristic cry is a wild\
    \ & deafening ululation, not unlike a hoarse muezzin.\nThe Catsob. Catsobs were\
    \ once numerous in Java & Batavia, but they have been almost wiped out, possibly\
    \ because they resemble stalks of wheat.\nThe Shoveller Wreck. A shy bird, the\
    \ shoveller wreck feeds mainly on bags of suet eked from shipwrecks. It tears\
    \ the bags open with its huge, lacerating beak.\nThe Ip. The ip is treasured by\
    \ tiny & bewildered orphans, for at harvest time it will roost atop unlikely clumps\
    \ of foliage & sing oh so sweetly, which provides a diversion in the poor unfortunates\u2019\
    \ otherwise dismal lives.\nThe Immense Floon. The nomenclature of the immense\
    \ floon is one of those endlessly fascinating ornithological puzzles tabulated\
    \ by the Jesuit bird-fancier Father F X Curpin in his exhaustive book \u201CEggs\
    \ & Talons\u201D. The immense floon is neither immense, nor is it a floon. Nor\
    \ a bird.\nThe Plint. The plint is fractious, terrified, rotating, cowardly, pompous,\
    \ harsh, bilious, untenable, made of cloth & pig iron, and often found in railway\
    \ sidings.\nThe Panstub. The panstub is best known as the \u201Cstar\u201D of\
    \ the long-running television series \u201CMeet My Panstub!\u201D, in which members\
    \ of the public show their panstubs to a studio audience.\nThe Grey Fod. Not to\
    \ be confused with the vermilion fod, the grey fod has been adopted as a mascot\
    \ by the Association Of Icing Sugar Enthusiasts.\nThe Chawbill. Ah yes, the chawbill.\
    \ Few can forget the Sherlock Holmes story in which the entire plot hinges upon\
    \ the presence, or absence, of a chawbill. I am one of the few.\nThe Tump. According\
    \ to the testimony of that most winsome yet valiant of bird-experts, the wryly-bespectacled\
    \ & quite possibly stone deaf Heppenstall Pondcrack\u2014a man of whom it was\
    \ said that phantom ospreys perched on his skull\u2014the tump is \u201Cpossibly\
    \ the most charming bird I have ever been attacked by\u201D.\nThe White Sprague.\
    \ The poor, poor white sprague is considered a delicacy by Tasmanian bird-eaters\
    \ & thus spends much of its life hiding behind tractors.\nThe Ringtod. Also known\
    \ as \u201Cthat bird with antennae\u201D, the ringtod is capable of hearing sounds\
    \ at such high pitch that laboratory experiments have sent many boffins completely\
    \ insane.\nTwenty third bird. The Frail Grewn. The frail grewn is a wholly dismal\
    \ bird.\nThe Ockfop. Fond of caster sugar & whelks, the ockfop has a fiendishly\
    \ complex chirp which appears to be intelligible not only to other birds, but\
    \ also to dromedaries, antelopes, & gnats.\nThe Sneed. A toy sneed built from\
    \ tungsten was stolen from the Texas Schoolbook Depository in Dallas just two\
    \ hours before the assassination of President John F Kennedy. Note that the F\
    \ stood not for \u201CFitzgerald\u201D, as is commonly supposed, but for \u201C\
    Fulmar\u201D (a type of duck).\nThe Blet. Savage blets! Numberless are the fools\
    \ who think the blet is a wistful, pacific bird. Not so! I bear scars today from\
    \ a childhood blet incident, fully recounted in my book \u201CEight Hundred Traumatic\
    \ Bird Episodes\u201D (out of print).\nThe Mo. If to Penge you go For the bittern\
    \ show Stub not your toe Nor cause yourself woe No Instead, speak low Take up\
    \ thy oars and row Where the stream doth flow But not the River Po And in the\
    \ sunset glow Behold the shy & tiny mo\nThe Amherst Pintpot. The feathers of the\
    \ amherst pintpot are truly remarkable. I have no idea why. I was once accosted\
    \ upon a train by a raving ornithologist who swore that this was the case, & who\
    \ was I to argue?\nThe Wert. The wert has one head, one tail, two wings & two\
    \ legs. I have not had time to count its talons.\nThe Groaning Fad. The groaning\
    \ fad was popular, perhaps too popular, in the iconography of 1960s easy listening\
    \ LP covers.\nThe Gorey. Ajax was his name, florid his complexion, & mighty were\
    \ his works. Among these works, legend has it that he set free ten thousand goreys\
    \ caged by the bird-hating King Anaxagrotas.\nThe Curpin. The curpin is a tremulous\
    \ bird which is known to flock in the vicinity of hot air balloons, aerostats\
    \ & grey dirigibles, especially those put out of commission because their fabric\
    \ is frayed, rent, or torn.\nThirty third bird. The Tiny Shid. With its massive\
    \ beak & laughably elongated legs, the tiny shid is often the butt of larger &\
    \ more elegant birds, which give it chase & ridicule it in a peculiarly bird-like\
    \ manner which has to be seen to be believed.\nThe Paglop. Worms form the staple\
    \ diet of the paglop, a singularly idle bird which can survive bewildering extremes\
    \ of temperature. An ornithologist once accidentally trapped a paglop in her fridge\
    \ freezer, from whence it emerged four months later none the worse for wear. The\
    \ next day, the very same paglop suffered mid-flight concussion & plunged into\
    \ a huge cauldron of boiling grease. Regaining consciousness three days later,\
    \ the paglop simply flew away.\nThe Booter. Booters were the favourite birds of\
    \ Bruce Ismay, owner of the White Star Line. The company's most famous, or infamous,\
    \ ship was the Titanic, the sinking of which was survived by Ismay due to his\
    \ wretched cowardice. Later in life Ismay, a broken man, tried to argue that the\
    \ Titanic had not sunk, but had in fact run aground on a grassy knoll. Yes, THAT\
    \ grassy knoll.\nThe Snab. Flightless, blind in one eye, & prone to fits, the\
    \ snab emits a curious, frog-like croak when approached by Jesuits, bus conductors,\
    \ & deposed monarchs.\nThe Illusory Wrenfig. Birdwatchers have reported increased\
    \ chances of success in spotting illusory wrenfigs if they first ply each other\
    \ with loganberry sandwiches & flasks of boiling hot custard.\nThe Giant Clamper.\
    \ Despite my vast & intimidating erudition, I confess that I am wholly ignorant\
    \ of the giant clamper.\nThe Beaked Snap. Or possibly the \u201CBeakered\u201D\
    \ snap. Experts cannot agree on the correct term for this bird, & have not been\
    \ helped by the astonishing popularity of Gus Fang's book \u201CHow To Spell The\
    \ Names Of Birds According To Whim\u201D.\nThe Tragic Clot. Massive & unruly,\
    \ the tragic clot lives on the edges of cliffs, in wind tunnels, & at the bottoms\
    \ of abandoned wells. It is often mistaken for a loping heron, but only by those\
    \ who don't know which side their bread is buttered on.\nThe Tupy. Monstrous &\
    \ implacable, the tupy is possibly the most dangerous bird on this or any other\
    \ planet. Keep away from them, for god's sake.\nThe Forlorn Punt. Quite why the\
    \ forlorn punt has been included in this list is beyond me. Granted, it has a\
    \ beak, it has feathers, it is wing\xE9d. It is indubitably a bird, but it really\
    \ is most unprepossessing.\nForty third bird. The Ectoblot. Aah, we come at last\
    \ to the ectoblot, fondly known as the \u201CRod Steiger of the Aviary\u201D.\
    \ Cantankerous, doleful & seldom at rest, the ectoblot's luminous crimson plumage\
    \ is surely evidence that God exists.\nThe Snagger. Snaggers are a type of gull.\
    \ Like all gulls, they are scavengers. However, being mentally unstable, snaggers\
    \ tend to scavenge pointless things, like blunted pencil sharpeners & broken cotton\
    \ reels.\nThe Big Drub. What poetry lover has not felt a frisson of pure delight\
    \ upon encountering Gervase Beerpint's slim volume \u201CA Toc H Lamp Sputters\
    \ In The Gloom\u201D? I am thinking of the first edition, with the cover picture\
    \ of a big drub in her nest, feeding her cuddly chicks with scrapings from a bran\
    \ tub.\nThe Old Cargpan. The following quotation is from an unknown source: \u201C\
    That year there was an Indian summer. As a hard-nosed press reporter, I had spent\
    \ months tracking down the so-called \u201Cumbrella man\u201D shown in photographs\
    \ from Dealey Plaza. I was getting nowhere, & I was down in the dumps. To cheer\
    \ myself up, I strode through buttercup-splattered fields, looking at the enormous\
    \ blue sky, blue, so blue. And there, blue too, almost invisible, coming in from\
    \ the south, was a whole flock of old cargpans. I nearly had a heart attack.\u201D\
    \nThe Spavined Ack. The spavined ack is a parasitic bird. The chicks attach themselves\
    \ to much larger ostriches. Once attached, if they fall off, they die.\nThe Hopeless\
    \ Cork. The hopeless cork's name is a misnomer. Indeed, it is one of the most\
    \ optimistic of birds, possibly because it looks so appealing that even those\
    \ with the hardest of hearts will readily toss breadcrumbs to it.\nThe Reed Flamboise.\
    \ The reed flamboise is the only bird in this list to be wholly mythical. Having\
    \ said that\u2014as I just did\u2014it is not without charm. What it IS without\
    \ is a sense of direction, as it habitually confuses north with west, but not\
    \ vice versa.\nDobson's Wafer. Many is the time, strolling \u2018mid the fens,\
    \ the spire of Ely Cathedral visible in the distance, that I have taken off my\
    \ big woolly hat in awe at the sight of a pair of dobson's wafers.\nThe Basinbeak.\
    \ Exceedingly disagreeable, though harmless, the basinbeak is the most unmusical\
    \ of birds. You'll get no cheeps or chirrups out of this little fellow. God knows\
    \ I\u2019ve tried, alternately feeding it Garibaldi biscuits & holding its head\
    \ under a water pump, but all to no avail. Call me a fool, but I\u2019m going\
    \ to try again, probably next Monday.\nThe Illicit Hoonjaw. Once upon a time,\
    \ a little girl called Minnie said to her papa, \u201CPapa, today I was coming\
    \ home from school when one of my friends had an epileptic fit, a grand mal, &\
    \ I was so disconcerted I made a strange surprised noise, like MIP! MIP!\u201D\
    \ \u201CHa!\u201D replied her papa, \u201CThat is exactly like the song of the\
    \ illicit hoonjaw!\u201D, for papa was a top ornithologist, & he knew his onions.\n\
    Fifty third bird. The Clunk. Last but not least."
