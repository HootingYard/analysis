story:
  date: 2004-03-14
  id: 2004-03-14-a-catalogue-of-53-birds
  text: 'The Godwit. Like Italo Calvino, the godwit has a seething hatred of cement.
    It has been known to burrow. Prone to desperate sneezing, the godwit chews dandelions
    & lacks any sense of pottery.

    The Wan Clump. An extraordinary bird, the wan clump is best known for its habit
    of swooping upon film premieres attended by the likes of Cloris Leachman, Troy
    Donahue & Tab Hunter. But not Tuesday Weld.

    Third bird. The Quint. Vercingetorix Sepulveda wrote about quints in one of his
    majestic tracts. Unfortunately, scholars have to date been unable to read any
    of them, as his penmanship was execrable.

    The Lopwit. Omitted from most biographies of Ezra Pound is the startling fact
    that he was an indefatigable trapper of lopwits. Such was his mania that he was
    fired from the joint US-Italian Lopwit Monitoring Committee in 1949.

    The Tult. Sadly, the tult is an irrelevant bird.

    The Fristiglip. What a joy to behold a flock of fristiglips on the wing, as they
    set off on their annual migration from Penge to Uttoxeter!

    The Snote. The following is a quotation from Eric Wheat''s "Notes On That Bad
    Man Dobson & Some Birds": "This morning on my way to church I noted the nest of
    a snote atop the timber-framed hut in which the malefactor Dobson plots his dark
    deeds. The nest was empty. Yet upon my return from worship, it was absolutely
    crammed with innumerable sickly snotes."

    The Churter. The churter is able to mimic the sound of klaxons, sirens & tocsins,
    but does not often do so. It feeds on dew & flax.

    The Arpad. Many top ornithologists contend that the arpad is a kind of nightjar.
    Certainly its beak & wings give that impression. Arpads, both in flight & roosting,
    have been a popular subject for recent postage stamps in Finland.

    The Hoogoo. There are a number of interesting facts about the hoogoo, a tiny bird
    much smaller than the wren, or even the hummingbird. The hoogoo is, as far as
    I know, the only bird which has magnetic feet. For this reason, hoogoos avoid
    sites such as ironworks, blacksmiths, smelting yards, tin mines & other locations
    of metallurgical interest.

    The Pale Auk. Aerodynamically unsound, the pale auk is only capable of flight
    on Wednesdays, except Ash Wednesday. Its characteristic cry is a wild & deafening
    ululation, not unlike a hoarse muezzin.

    The Catsob. Catsobs were once numerous in Java & Batavia, but they have been almost
    wiped out, possibly because they resemble stalks of wheat.

    The Shoveller Wreck. A shy bird, the shoveller wreck feeds mainly on bags of suet
    eked from shipwrecks. It tears the bags open with its huge, lacerating beak.

    The Ip. The ip is treasured by tiny & bewildered orphans, for at harvest time
    it will roost atop unlikely clumps of foliage & sing oh so sweetly, which provides
    a diversion in the poor unfortunates'' otherwise dismal lives.

    The Immense Floon. The nomenclature of the immense floon is one of those endlessly
    fascinating ornithological puzzles tabulated by the Jesuit bird-fancier Father
    F X Curpin in his exhaustive book "Eggs & Talons". The immense floon is neither
    immense, nor is it a floon. Nor a bird.

    The Plint. The plint is fractious, terrified, rotating, cowardly, pompous, harsh,
    bilious, untenable, made of cloth & pig iron, and often found in railway sidings.

    The Panstub. The panstub is best known as the "star" of the long-running television
    series "Meet My Panstub!", in which members of the public show their panstubs
    to a studio audience.

    The Grey Fod. Not to be confused with the vermilion fod, the grey fod has been
    adopted as a mascot by the Association Of Icing Sugar Enthusiasts.

    The Chawbill. Ah yes, the chawbill. Few can forget the Sherlock Holmes story in
    which the entire plot hinges upon the presence, or absence, of a chawbill. I am
    one of the few.

    The Tump. According to the testimony of that most winsome yet valiant of bird-experts,
    the wryly-bespectacled & quite possibly stone deaf Heppenstall Pondcrack--a man
    of whom it was said that phantom ospreys perched on his skull--the tump is "possibly
    the most charming bird I have ever been attacked by".

    The White Sprague. The poor, poor white sprague is considered a delicacy by Tasmanian
    bird-eaters & thus spends much of its life hiding behind tractors.

    The Ringtod. Also known as "that bird with antennae", the ringtod is capable of
    hearing sounds at such high pitch that laboratory experiments have sent many boffins
    completely insane.

    Twenty third bird. The Frail Grewn. The frail grewn is a wholly dismal bird.

    The Ockfop. Fond of caster sugar & whelks, the ockfop has a fiendishly complex
    chirp which appears to be intelligible not only to other birds, but also to dromedaries,
    antelopes, & gnats.

    The Sneed. A toy sneed built from tungsten was stolen from the Texas Schoolbook
    Depository in Dallas just two hours before the assassination of President John
    F Kennedy. Note that the F stood not for "Fitzgerald", as is commonly supposed,
    but for "Fulmar" (a type of duck).

    The Blet. Savage blets! Numberless are the fools who think the blet is a wistful,
    pacific bird. Not so! I bear scars today from a childhood blet incident, fully
    recounted in my book "Eight Hundred Traumatic Bird Episodes" (out of print).

    The Mo. If to Penge you go For the bittern show Stub not your toe Nor cause yourself
    woe No Instead, speak low Take up thy oars and row Where the stream doth flow
    But not the River Po And in the sunset glow Behold the shy & tiny mo

    The Amherst Pintpot. The feathers of the amherst pintpot are truly remarkable.
    I have no idea why. I was once accosted upon a train by a raving ornithologist
    who swore that this was the case, & who was I to argue?

    The Wert. The wert has one head, one tail, two wings & two legs. I have not had
    time to count its talons.

    The Groaning Fad. The groaning fad was popular, perhaps too popular, in the iconography
    of 1960s easy listening LP covers.

    The Gorey. Ajax was his name, florid his complexion, & mighty were his works.
    Among these works, legend has it that he set free ten thousand goreys caged by
    the bird-hating King Anaxagrotas.

    The Curpin. The curpin is a tremulous bird which is known to flock in the vicinity
    of hot air balloons, aerostats & grey dirigibles, especially those put out of
    commission because their fabric is frayed, rent, or torn.

    Thirty third bird. The Tiny Shid. With its massive beak & laughably elongated
    legs, the tiny shid is often the butt of larger & more elegant birds, which give
    it chase & ridicule it in a peculiarly bird-like manner which has to be seen to
    be believed.

    The Paglop. Worms form the staple diet of the paglop, a singularly idle bird which
    can survive bewildering extremes of temperature. An ornithologist once accidentally
    trapped a paglop in her fridge freezer, from whence it emerged four months later
    none the worse for wear. The next day, the very same paglop suffered mid-flight
    concussion & plunged into a huge cauldron of boiling grease. Regaining consciousness
    three days later, the paglop simply flew away.

    The Booter. Booters were the favourite birds of Bruce Ismay, owner of the White
    Star Line. The company''s most famous, or infamous, ship was the Titanic, the
    sinking of which was survived by Ismay due to his wretched cowardice. Later in
    life Ismay, a broken man, tried to argue that the Titanic had not sunk, but had
    in fact run aground on a grassy knoll. Yes, THAT grassy knoll.

    The Snab. Flightless, blind in one eye, & prone to fits, the snab emits a curious,
    frog-like croak when approached by Jesuits, bus conductors, & deposed monarchs.

    The Illusory Wrenfig. Birdwatchers have reported increased chances of success
    in spotting illusory wrenfigs if they first ply each other with loganberry sandwiches
    & flasks of boiling hot custard.

    The Giant Clamper. Despite my vast & intimidating erudition, I confess that I
    am wholly ignorant of the giant clamper.

    The Beaked Snap. Or possibly the "Beakered" snap. Experts cannot agree on the
    correct term for this bird, & have not been helped by the astonishing popularity
    of Gus Fang''s book "How To Spell The Names Of Birds According To Whim".

    The Tragic Clot. Massive & unruly, the tragic clot lives on the edges of cliffs,
    in wind tunnels, & at the bottoms of abandoned wells. It is often mistaken for
    a loping heron, but only by those who don''t know which side their bread is buttered
    on.

    The Tupy. Monstrous & implacable, the tupy is possibly the most dangerous bird
    on this or any other planet. Keep away from them, for god''s sake.

    The Forlorn Punt. Quite why the forlorn punt has been included in this list is
    beyond me. Granted, it has a beak, it has feathers, it is winged. It is indubitably
    a bird, but it really is most unprepossessing.

    Forty third bird. The Ectoblot. Aah, we come at last to the ectoblot, fondly known
    as the "Rod Steiger of the Aviary". Cantankerous, doleful & seldom at rest, the
    ectoblot''s luminous crimson plumage is surely evidence that God exists.

    The Snagger. Snaggers are a type of gull. Like all gulls, they are scavengers.
    However, being mentally unstable, snaggers tend to scavenge pointless things,
    like blunted pencil sharpeners & broken cotton reels.

    The Big Drub. What poetry lover has not felt a frisson of pure delight upon encountering
    Gervase Beerpint''s slim volume "A Toc H Lamp Sputters In The Gloom"? I am thinking
    of the first edition, with the cover picture of a big drub in her nest, feeding
    her cuddly chicks with scrapings from a bran tub.

    The Old Cargpan. The following quotation is from an unknown source: "That year
    there was an Indian summer. As a hard-nosed press reporter, I had spent months
    tracking down the so-called "umbrella man" shown in photographs from Dealey Plaza.
    I was getting nowhere, & I was down in the dumps. To cheer myself up, I strode
    through buttercup-splattered fields, looking at the enormous blue sky, blue, so
    blue. And there, blue too, almost invisible, coming in from the south, was a whole
    flock of old cargpans. I nearly had a heart attack."

    The Spavined Ack. The spavined ack is a parasitic bird. The chicks attach themselves
    to much larger ostriches. Once attached, if they fall off, they die.

    The Hopeless Cork. The hopeless cork''s name is a misnomer. Indeed, it is one
    of the most optimistic of birds, possibly because it looks so appealing that even
    those with the hardest of hearts will readily toss breadcrumbs to it.

    The Reed Flamboise. The reed flamboise is the only bird in this list to be wholly
    mythical. Having said that--as I just did--it is not without charm. What it IS
    without is a sense of direction, as it habitually confuses north with west, but
    not vice versa.

    Dobson''s Wafer. Many is the time, strolling ''mid the fens, the spire of Ely
    Cathedral visible in the distance, that I have taken off my big woolly hat in
    awe at the sight of a pair of dobson''s wafers.

    The Basinbeak. Exceedingly disagreeable, though harmless, the basinbeak is the
    most unmusical of birds. You''ll get no cheeps or chirrups out of this little
    fellow. God knows I''ve tried, alternately feeding it Garibaldi biscuits & holding
    its head under a water pump, but all to no avail. Call me a fool, but I''m going
    to try again, probably next Monday.

    The Illicit Hoonjaw. Once upon a time, a little girl called Minnie said to her
    papa, "Papa, today I was coming home from school when one of my friends had an
    epileptic fit, a grand mal, & I was so disconcerted I made a strange surprised
    noise, like MIP! MIP!" "Ha!" replied her papa, "That is exactly like the song
    of the illicit hoonjaw!", for papa was a top ornithologist, & he knew his onions.

    Fifty third bird. The Clunk. Last but not least.'
