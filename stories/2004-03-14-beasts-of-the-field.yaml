  text: "\u201CWhat in the name of heaven is Kurt Chodd prattling on about?\u201D\
    \ asks reader P. N. Cowper, \u201CContrary to the absurd waiting room scene in\
    \ The Administration Of Lighthouses (9th March), vets do not as a rule tend to\
    \ the kinds of animals listed there. This lack of verisimilitude ruined the lecture\
    \ for me, and I am sure for many other readers.\u201D Well: Mr or Ms Cowper is\
    \ clearly not familiar with James Forbes' Oriental Memoirs (1813-15), where we\
    \ find this:\n\u201CThe Banian hospital at Surat is a most remarkable institution;\
    \ it consists of a large plot of ground, enclosed with high walls, divided into\
    \ several courts or wards, for the accommodation of animals; in sickness they\
    \ are attended with the tenderest care, and find a peaceful asylum for the infirmities\
    \ of age. At my visit, the hospital contained horses, mules, oxen, sheep, goats,\
    \ monkeys, poultry, pigeons, and a variety of birds, with an aged tortoise, who\
    \ was known to have been there for seventy-five years. The most extraordinary\
    \ ward was that appropriated to rats, mice, bugs, and other noxious vermin. The\
    \ overseers of the hospital frequently hire beggars from the streets, for a stipulated\
    \ sum, to pass a night among the fleas, lice, and bugs, on the express condition\
    \ of suffering them to enjoy their feast without molestation.\u201D"
