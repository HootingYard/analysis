  text: 'Edward Gibbon, author of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
    Empire, was possibly the greatest writer of footnotes who ever lived. Here is
    a fine example of his art: "According to Julius Africanus, the world was created
    on the first of September--an opinion almost too foolish to be recorded."

    By inserting that "almost", of course, Gibbon gets away with recording a wonderfully
    foolish opinion, and by doing so preserves it for us. We include it here in the
    hope that readers will contribute further foolish opinions, past and present,
    to create the Hooting Yard Pantheon o'' Preposterousness. And yes, I know that
    there are many, many sites on the web devoted to such zaniness, but only at Hooting
    Yard will you find Edward Gibbon and Julius Africanus sharing a space with a photograph
    of black-caped, sepulchral-voiced brain guru Tony Buzan.
