  text: "\u201CHeliogabalus made elaborate preparations for his own death, expecting\
    \ that it would come in the midst of some uprising. He had a courtyard in his\
    \ palace paved with porphyry so that he might throw himself down on it from a\
    \ high place. He had a steel dagger fitted with a diamond-studded, carved gold\
    \ hilt, to stab himself. He had especially spun a rope of gold and silk, to strangle\
    \ himself. Surprised in the latrine by his assassins, he choked himself to death\
    \ on the sponge that, to use Montaigne's expression, \u2018the Romans used to\
    \ wipe their behinds\u2019.\u201D \u2014 Alexandre Dumas, in the preface to his\
    \ Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine."
