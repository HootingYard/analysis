    \ the ISSF is perhaps the only organisation of note where those who have lost\
    \ their hearts to mundane items of stationery can find a home.\nEven as we speak,\
    \ Istvan & Pansy are compiling a book of paeans to stationery, excerpts from which\
    \ will appear here. Please submit your own contributions!\nMeanwhile, for the\
    \ delight of all stationery fanatics, here is a gallery of choice items!\n\n\n\
    THE STAPLER\n\n\nTHE PAPER CLIP\n\n\nTHE HIGHLIGHTER\n\n\nTHE DATE STAMP\n\n\n\
    THE CORRECTION FLUID\n\n\nTHE HOLE PUNCH\n\n\nTHE POST-IT\xAE NOTE\n\n\nTHE SCISSORS\n\
    \n\nTHE DESK ORGANISER\n\n\nTHE RING BINDER\n\n\nTHE RUBBER BAND\n\n\nAND, OF\
