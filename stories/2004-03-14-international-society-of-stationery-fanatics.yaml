  text: 'Established by Istvan Scrimgeour & Pansy Cradledew late in the last century,
    the ISSF is perhaps the only organisation of note where those who have lost their
    hearts to mundane items of stationery can find a home.

    Even as we speak, Istvan & Pansy are compiling a book of paeans to stationery,
    excerpts from which will appear here. Please submit your own contributions!

    Meanwhile, for the delight of all stationery fanatics, here is a gallery of choice
    items!
