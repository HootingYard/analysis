  text: My name is Maud Abdab. I am the woman who ate blood oranges with Enver Hoxha.
    We sat together in uncomfortable beach chairs, without speaking. My Albanian was
    rusty, and I was in awe, and he saw I was in awe, and he relished my awe. Juice
    from the blood oranges dribbled down our jaws. From the discomfort of his beach
    chair, Enver Hoxha directed my attention to the left. I looked, and saw a rowing
    boat, and the rowing boat's oars. The oars were too small for the rowing boat--or--the
    rowing boat was too big for the oars. I turned to look at Enver Hoxha. After a
    pause, he rose, and pulled from his pocket a length of gauze. When he went, he
    shook my hand, but he did not let fall the gauze. He spoke then. He said he had
    to go and draft some new Albanian laws. I recall nothing more.
