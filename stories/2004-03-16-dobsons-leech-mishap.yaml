  text: "Dobson was one of the few pamphleteeers of the 20th century who still took\
    \ seriously the mediaeval theory of the Four Bodily Humours. To remind readers\
    \ who have forgotten, and inform those who don't know, here is a commendably concise\
    \ paragraph from \u201CHumorous\u201D Dobson, an unpublished essay by Marigold\
    \ Chew:\nTaking the Aristotelian elements in turn, the theory was as follows:\
    \ earth is reflected in the body as black bile, air as yellow bile, fire as blood,\
    \ and water as phlegm. From these derive the terms melancholic, choleric, sanguine\
    \ and phlegmatic. Dobson never deviated from his belief that the theory was fundamentally\
    \ correct. He tended towards melancholy.\nAnd, it should be said, he was so convinced\
    \ that he also subscribed to the related practice of bloodletting with leeches.\
    \ Dobson was rarely ill, but when he was, he had a devil of a time trying to find\
    \ a doctor who would treat him as he wished. On his 61st birthday, suffering from\
    \ an excess of black bile, he was in luck\u2014or so he thought. An \u201Calternative\
    \ therapist\u201D had opened their doors just down the road. Dobson presented\
    \ himself and demanded leeching. He was shown into a back room and lo!, leeches\
    \ were applied to his spindly legs. Unfortunately, the quack used leeches of the\
    \ genus Helobdella (Glossiphoniidae), rather than Hirudo medicinalis. The latter\
    \ is, as its name implies, the medicinal leech. It is a quaint, dark cylinder\
    \ which has thirty three body rings, five pairs of eyes, several pairs of testes\
    \ and two suckers, one at each end of its body. The head sucker searches and penetrates\
    \ while the tail sucker holds fast to the host.\nThe result of the wrong type\
    \ of leech being used was so vile that I shall not repeat it here. Dobson was\
    \ lucky to survive, but he did, thank the Lord. If you decide to have your blood\
    \ sucked by leeches, take this helpful anatomical diagram of Hirudo medicinalis\
    \ with you. You will be able to check that your practicioner is using the correct\
    \ type of leech, and can rest easy.\n"
