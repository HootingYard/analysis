  text: "\u201CIt is bad luck to carry a spade through a house \u2026 It is bad luck\
    \ to travel with a priest; this idea seems to me of Spanish importation; and I\
    \ am inclined to attribute a similar origin to the strange tropical superstition\
    \ about the banana, which I obtained, nevertheless, from an Italian. You must\
    \ not cut a banana, but simply break it with the fingers, because in cutting it\
    \ you cut the cross. It does not require a very powerful imagination to discern\
    \ in a severed section of the fruit the ghostly suggestion of a crucifixion.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Lafcadio Hearn, New Orleans Superstitions"
