  text: '"It is bad luck to carry a spade through a house ... It is bad luck to travel
    with a priest; this idea seems to me of Spanish importation; and I am inclined
    to attribute a similar origin to the strange tropical superstition about the banana,
    which I obtained, nevertheless, from an Italian. You must not cut a banana, but
    simply break it with the fingers, because in cutting it you cut the cross. It
    does not require a very powerful imagination to discern in a severed section of
    the fruit the ghostly suggestion of a crucifixion." -- Lafcadio Hearn, New Orleans
