  text: "Yesterday we celebrated Punter Hoonjaw's centenary. There are those who would\
    \ argue that the author of Invasion Of The Vapid Ones and The Tharg From Planet\
    \ Icke does not deserve to be remembered. No one, however, can cavil at our decision\
    \ to draw attention to an event that occurred in London two hundred and sixty\
    \ four years ago today. Indeed, its contemporary relevance is uncanny. On 17th\
    \ March 1740, Henry Fielding\u2014author and magistrate\u2014using the splendid\
    \ pseudonym Captain Hercules Vinegar, issued a court summons against the Poet\
    \ Laureate, Colley Cibber, accusing him of the wilful murder of the English language.\n\
    Is there in 21st century London an officer of the law with the wit to follow Captain\
    \ Vinegar's example? I have had stern words to say about the present Poet Laureate\
    \ before (see 18th December). But Lemsip-slurping Andrew Motion has now surpassed\
    \ even his own previous doggerel with A Song For Jonny. Read it and weep.\nNow\
    \ dry your eyes, for Pansy Cradledew has a theory. \u201CCould it be,\u201D she\
    \ asks, \u201Cthat Motion is brilliantly undermining the anachronistic, monarchist\
    \ post of laureate by writing deliberately atrocious twaddle? Consider the evidence.\
    \ You referred in December to his poem about a \u201Ddapper hall\u201C and a \u201D\
    ball\u201C. In this latest poem we find more balls. Read the last line of the\
    \ new one carefully. I think the poet\u2014if that's the word\u2014is trying to\
    \ tell us something.\u201D"
