  text: 'Dr Ruth Pastry has written in yet again: "Yesterday you showed a picture
    of Dr Henry Kissinger in close proximity to a picture of a leech. Is this meant
    to be amusing?" Dr Pastry should be aware that, unlike her, Kissinger has never
    been entitled to that "Dr": he simply made it up, trusting--for the most part
    correctly--that no one would dare challenge it, given his assumed gravitas and
    that sepulchral voice which outdoes even the graveyard tones of our own dear brain
    guru Tony Buzan. Anyway, Kissinger and the leech appeared in separate items. Get
    a grip, Dr Pastry!'
