  text: "Dr Ruth Pastry has written in yet again: \u201CYesterday you showed a picture\
    \ of Dr Henry Kissinger in close proximity to a picture of a leech. Is this meant\
    \ to be amusing?\u201D Dr Pastry should be aware that, unlike her, Kissinger has\
    \ never been entitled to that \u201CDr\u201D: he simply made it up, trusting\u2014\
    for the most part correctly\u2014that no one would dare challenge it, given his\
    \ assumed gravitas and that sepulchral voice which outdoes even the graveyard\
    \ tones of our own dear brain guru Tony Buzan. Anyway, Kissinger and the leech\
    \ appeared in separate items. Get a grip, Dr Pastry!"
