  text: 'When he wasn''t rescuing fallen women or devising theories about Ancient
    Grecian colour blindness (see 2nd March), William Ewart Gladstone enthused about
    Atlantis. He was so infatuated with Ignatius Donnelly''s book Atlantis, The Antediluvian
    World (1882) that he begged the Treasury for funds to mount an expedition of discovery,
    having decided that the Azores were the mountain peaks of the lost continent.
    The cabinet refused to let him have any money for this harebrained scheme, displaying
    a level of judiciousness which would not go amiss today.


    Left to right : William Ewart Gladstone, the capital city of Atlantis, Ignatius
    Donnelly, and Mrs Gubbins'' discarded old button.'
