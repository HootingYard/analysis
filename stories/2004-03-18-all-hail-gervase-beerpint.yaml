    Gervase Beerpint''s latest collection, Chutney On My Spats & Other Verses will
    be published next week on Pansy Cradledew Day (26th March). Says Gervase of his
    new work: "This is a new direction for me. I used to write sat at my desk facing
    south, but these grandly poetic soul-emanations were composed in my temporary
    billet at an Antarctic weather station, so I couldn''t help but look to the north,
    and that has been a wonderful inspiration. Mrs Gubbins has hailed it as my best
    work. What do you think of these tough reindeer-hide snow-boots I''m wearing?
    I think I cut quite a dash, don''t you?"'
