  text: "\nGervase Beerpint's latest collection, Chutney On My Spats & Other Verses\
    \ will be published next week on Pansy Cradledew Day (26th March). Says Gervase\
    \ of his new work: \u201CThis is a new direction for me. I used to write sat at\
    \ my desk facing south, but these grandly poetic soul-emanations were composed\
    \ in my temporary billet at an Antarctic weather station, so I couldn't help but\
    \ look to the north, and that has been a wonderful inspiration. Mrs Gubbins has\
    \ hailed it as my best work. What do you think of these tough reindeer-hide snow-boots\
    \ I'm wearing? I think I cut quite a dash, don't you?\u201D"
