  text: "\nBlasphemous Ted Cargpan's dog (above) has been awarded top prize in the\
    \ \u201CAyn Rand Household Pet Of The Week\u201D contest run by The Weekly Shackle.\
    \ The hound, variously known as Hopscotch, Spinach, Chevenix De Groot, and L'Oreal\
    \ (because he's worth it) was the clear winner in a field which included a bee,\
    \ a horse, three corncrakes, a flea-ridden bison, Tim the pipistrelle bat, a weasel,\
    \ a curlew, a pair of otters, and\u2014the bookies' favourite\u2014a squirrel\
    \ called Miriam. Unfortunately, Miriam succumbed to an attack of the bindings\
    \ and had to be withdrawn from competition. Better luck next week!"
