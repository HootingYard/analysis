    Blasphemous Ted Cargpan''s dog (above) has been awarded top prize in the "Ayn
    Rand Household Pet Of The Week" contest run by The Weekly Shackle. The hound,
    variously known as Hopscotch, Spinach, Chevenix De Groot, and L''Oreal (because
    he''s worth it) was the clear winner in a field which included a bee, a horse,
    three corncrakes, a flea-ridden bison, Tim the pipistrelle bat, a weasel, a curlew,
    a pair of otters, and--the bookies'' favourite--a squirrel called Miriam. Unfortunately,
    Miriam succumbed to an attack of the bindings and had to be withdrawn from competition.
    Better luck next week!'
