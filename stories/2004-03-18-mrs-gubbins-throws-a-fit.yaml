  text: "Dark clouds lour'd, and hailstones began to ping upon the pavement. Inside\
    \ Haemoglobin Towers, Mrs Gubbins and her eighty-three-year-old colleague Daisy\
    \ De'Ath were putting the finishing touches to their new software development,\
    \ Pump-Action Graffix Hub 1.0, already being touted as \u201Ca harbinger\u201D\
    \ by Technobilge magazine.\n\u201CWould you care for a cup of tea, dear?\u201D\
    \ asked Daisy, noting that Mrs Gubbins was panting asthmatically and mopping her\
    \ brow with a dainty handkerchief embroidered with a pattern of crocuses, hollyhocks,\
    \ mealy bugs, and spurge. Daisy had always been famed for her solicitude.\n\u201C\
    Ack\u2026\u201D gasped Mrs Gubbins.\n\u201CTsk! You're getting yourself all flustered,\
    \ Mrs Gubbins,\u201D said Daisy, a little sharply, \u201CJust because you forgot\
    \ to insert a backslash into the command line for the ActiveX Pod System Tray\
    \ Default.\u201D\nReminded of this peccadillo, Mrs Gubbins became even more agitated,\
    \ toppled off her ergonomic extruded-plastic workstation seating module, and landed\
    \ on the floor, threshing about in an alarming fashion.\n\u201CDearie me,\u201D\
    \ muttered Daisy to herself, and resolved at once to call an ambulance, despite\
    \ the storm which was now raging outside like something from the imagination of\
    \ the painter John Martin. She flipped through her Rolodex looking for the telephone\
    \ number of the Bodger's Spinney Ambulance Station, which was close by, but without\
    \ her spectacles\u2014which she had unaccountably left in the office kitchenette\
    \ while making some Bovril earlier\u2014she was as good as blind. \u201COne of\
    \ these days I'll forget my own head!\u201D she chuckled, in her fluting croak.*\n\
    Meanwhile a stream of drool was flowing from Mrs Gubbins' thin-lipped mouth, and\
    \ her head was turning green \u2026\n* NOTE : Pedantic readers may argue that\
    \ a croak cannot be fluting, but they have not heard Daisy De'Ath speak. Oh, and\
    \ by the way, you will be pleased to know that Mrs Gubbins made a full recovery,\
    \ before an ambulance arrived, by dint of the first aid skills of Matilda Choctaw\
    \ (so spritely for a ninety-one-year-old!) who skipped into the office at the\
    \ ellipsis above."
