  text: "\u201CNext to Rosa Whittier sat Julia Balcolm, with saddened expression of\
    \ countenance and large deep blue eyes that gazed upon you with a deeper expression\
    \ of melancholy in their glances than is usual to the merry age of childhood,\
    \ and elicited your sympathy ere you knew her history. Julia was a cripple. She\
    \ was drawn to school by an older sister with rosy cheeks, bright flashing black\
    \ eyes, and a sprightly animated countenance, and carried into the school-room\
    \ in the arms of her teacher, or some of the older scholars. And so she came,\
    \ year after year, mingling with the merry group. But where is she now? Yon little\
    \ mound of heaped up earth covers her remains, and a narrow marble slab tells\
    \ the place of her repose, and we can but hope she who was denied the privilege\
    \ of walking on earth may now soar on angel's wings. This dear child was obliged\
    \ to crawl from place to place after her more favoured companions, dragging her\
    \ useless perished limbs behind her. But He who careth for us knew what was best\
    \ for her, and we cannot doubt His infinite wisdom.\u201D \u2014 Abigail Stanley\
    \ Hanna, Withered Leaves From Memory's Garland"
