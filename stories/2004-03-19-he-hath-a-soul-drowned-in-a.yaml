  text: '"He hath a soul drowned in a lump of flesh, or is a piece of earth that Prometheus
    put not half his proportion of fire into ... The Muses and the Graces are his
    hard mistresses; though he daily invocate them, though he sacrifice hecatombs,
    they still look asquint. You shall note him (besides his dull eye, and lowering
    head, and a certain clammy benumbed pace) by a fair displayed beard, a night-cap,
    and a gown ... His jests are either old fled proverbs, or lean-starved hackney
    apophthegms, or poor verbal quips, outworn by serving-men, tapsters, and milkmaids."
