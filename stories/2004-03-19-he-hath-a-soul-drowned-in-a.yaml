  text: "\u201CHe hath a soul drowned in a lump of flesh, or is a piece of earth that\
    \ Prometheus put not half his proportion of fire into \u2026 The Muses and the\
    \ Graces are his hard mistresses; though he daily invocate them, though he sacrifice\
    \ hecatombs, they still look asquint. You shall note him (besides his dull eye,\
    \ and lowering head, and a certain clammy benumbed pace) by a fair displayed beard,\
    \ a night-cap, and a gown \u2026 His jests are either old fled proverbs, or lean-starved\
    \ hackney apophthegms, or poor verbal quips, outworn by serving-men, tapsters,\
    \ and milkmaids.\u201D \u2014 Sir Thomas Overbury, Characters; or Witty Descriptions\
    \ of the Properties of Sundry Persons"
