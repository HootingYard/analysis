  text: 'There is good news from the Pang Hill Orphanage. The philanthropist Guesbaldo
    Sopwith--he whose fortune derives from the Unnerving Cakes & Pastries franchise--has
    donated six cows and a bee to the crumbling and storm-tossed institution, to bring
    a spark of light, albeit minuscule, into the lives of the woebegone tots. In announcing
    his largesse, Mr Sopwith said: "The orphans may be shabby little guttersnipes,
    but I had a spare half dozen cows, so after long deliberation and much chewing
    of freshly-picked gloxinia and harebells, I decided to let them loose in the orphanage
    garden, or what passes for a garden. The bee was my wife''s suggestion, and a
    very good one, I think."
