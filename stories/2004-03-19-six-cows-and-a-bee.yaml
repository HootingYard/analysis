  text: "There is good news from the Pang Hill Orphanage. The philanthropist Guesbaldo\
    \ Sopwith\u2014he whose fortune derives from the Unnerving Cakes & Pastries franchise\u2014\
    has donated six cows and a bee to the crumbling and storm-tossed institution,\
    \ to bring a spark of light, albeit minuscule, into the lives of the woebegone\
    \ tots. In announcing his largesse, Mr Sopwith said: \u201CThe orphans may be\
    \ shabby little guttersnipes, but I had a spare half dozen cows, so after long\
    \ deliberation and much chewing of freshly-picked gloxinia and harebells, I decided\
    \ to let them loose in the orphanage garden, or what passes for a garden. The\
    \ bee was my wife's suggestion, and a very good one, I think.\u201D\n\n\nTop row,\
    \ left to right : Corky, Zimbalist, a bee, Fleur. Bottom row, left to right :\
    \ Fading cow, Pookie, Arbogast."
