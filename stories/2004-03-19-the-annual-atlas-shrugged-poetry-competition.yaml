  text: 'It is time once again for this popular contest, open to all readers, their
    families and friends. With just a week to go until Pansy Cradledew Day, the panel
    of judges decided to set her as the topic--or, to be more precise "a poem in praise
    of Pansy Cradledew written in the style of Andrew Motion". Now there''s a challenge
    for poetasters and versifiers! Sharpen your pencils, set to work, and send in
    entries by Thursday 25th March, for publication on the great day itself. See 18th
    December and 17th March for examples of the Poet Laureate''s doggerel, and refer
    to What Is Hooting Yard? for some pointers to Pansy''s estimable character. The
    winner will be sent an original Gervase Beerpint manuscript, in pink ink on blotting
    paper--really!
