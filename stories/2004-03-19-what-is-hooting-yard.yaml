  text: "What is Hooting Yard?\n\nA splendid place. Much cake is eaten there.\nWhere\
    \ is it?\n\nLet me give you directions. Turn around, head for the door, turn left,\
    \ past the baths, the chemist's shop, the Town Hall, the pigeon lofts and the\
    \ owl sanctuary, along Blister Lane, go right at the duckpond, then up Pang Hill\
    \ until you reach the gasworks. Now strike off down Amnesiac Lane towards the\
    \ graveyard, hop over the fences and head west to Bodger's Spinney. Dip your cup\
    \ in the stream & rest awhile. Make your way to the mysterious village, where\
    \ the dandelions are blue and the air is thick with the stench of vinegar. Dither\
    \ in the square until you spot the newspaper kiosk, where you will be able to\
    \ buy a gazetteer of the village and its hinterland. Study this carefully. Whisk\
    \ yourself along the towpath of the canal & cross it at Sawdust Bridge, following\
    \ thereafter the course of the Great Frightening River. Camp out on the knoll\
    \ & eat up your sausages. There are many butterflies to be seen there. Do not\
    \ net them. Hare ye on, past the big Fireworks Factory & the Dental Institute\
    \ (you will notice that the cross bar is missing from the T, so it reads as the\
    \ Denial Institute) until you find yourself in a thicket of nettles. Free yourself\
    \ with the aid of secateurs. Then you must catch the funicular railway to the\
    \ very top of Pilgarlic Tor, and hurry down the other side on foot, splashing\
    \ through puddles until you reach the infected pig farmer's house. Hide in his\
    \ orchard & snooze. Now stride with giant steps across fields of barley, turnips,\
    \ bracken & furze, yes, bracken & bracken & furze & javelin weed, past the abandoned\
    \ quarry & on through a knot of allotments, finding shelter in a hut empty but\
    \ for the rusted remnants of a lawnmower, the skull of a badger, & a smudged &\
    \ unreadable instruction manual for a pencil sharpener. As the sun rises, trudge\
    \ south, skirting the Shabby Lime-Kilns & the serried belvederes of Haemoglobin\
    \ Towers until you hit upon an astonishing tract of rhubarb fields, at the far\
    \ end of which, nestled beside the alleyway leading off to Plunkett Hall, you\
    \ will find Hooting Yard, where you will be welcomed.\nGosh!\n\nIndeed.\nWill\
    \ I need a phrasebook?\n\nNo. But do make sure you are armed with the necessary\
    \ documentation, certificates & so on.\nSuch as?\n\nAlbigensian heresy clearance,\
    \ bee permits, cartography qualifications, dust inspection slip, encomia, freight\
    \ dockets, guarantees of rectitude, Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Hoon visitor's\
    \ ticket, ice readings, jalopy licence, klaxon waiver, lip prints, mortuary attendant's\
    \ sash, night soil test results, orlop deck pass, pigsnout haberdasher boneyard\
    \ ravings gumboil ratification tag, question paper, rag & bone chit, \u201CSavonarola's\
    \ Wisdom-in-a-Bucket\u201D proof of purchase, thumping headache medication prescription,\
    \ \xDClm map, visual impairment notice, wax thing, x-rays envelope, your own pod,\
    \ and nothing whatsoever that begins with Z. All this stuff must be packed into\
    \ a satchel which you hand over at the gate.\nWhat sort of gate is it?\n\nA white\
    \ wicket gate, if you must know. A guarded white wicket gate, to ensure that there\
    \ is no monkey business.\nOh, so I can't bring my monkey?\n\nCertainly not. Even\
    \ if you could, your ape would be driven insane by the mere sight of the Duty\
    \ Git who guards the gate. His is a terrible & gruesome countenance, & his voice\
    \ can extinguish the very stars in the heavens. Indeed, there have been complaints\
    \ from Plunkett Hall.\nWhen I get past the Duty Git, what then?\n\nThen you will\
    \ be ushered aboard a dilapidated charabanc & taken to meet Mr Key & Ms Cradledew.\n\
    And who might they be?\n\nLet me read to you their potted biographies. Frank Key\
    \ was born in a lighthouse. Much hectoring attended his infant years. As a youth,\
    \ he fell in with an itinerant trio of bell-ringers named Mat & Nat & Bam. Often\
    \ plagued by whitlows, he is no stranger to medical interventions of a peculiarly\
    \ jarring kidney. Of late, he has been living quietly on the attic floor of an\
    \ abandoned & crumbling hotel, where he is visited by his familiar, who keeps\
    \ him entertained with piccolo recitals & the chewing of brazil nuts. A keen ornithologist,\
    \ Frank recently received a special tin badge from the Hooting Yard Cormorant\
    \ Patrol. He likes to buff his badge to a shine with a frayed rag.\nAnd what of\
    \ Ms Cradledew?\n\nAgain, the potted biography is my source. After a brief & successful\
    \ career as a child, Pansy Cradledew put to good use her almost fanatical interest\
    \ in pencil cases. She was the youngest ever person to become an Adept of the\
    \ Order of the Hinges, and from this platform was able to launch a series of sparsely-attended\
    \ lecture tours. Much enamoured of the pingpong table & its accoutrements, Pansy\
    \ too is au fait with bird lore, & is often to be found daubing any available\
    \ wall surface with enormous paintings of starlings, corncrakes & buffleheads.\
    \ Despite persistent rumours, Pansy is not a flapper. Perhaps she is being mistaken\
    \ for her cousin Tallulah. Do you require any further information?\nNot at the\
    \ moment. I must say I like the cut of their jibs!\n\nAs well you might. The projecting\
    \ arm of Pansy's crane is crimson & elegant. The boom of Frank's derrick is blue\
    \ & sparkling. Only a few have seen fit to remark on their jibs. I salute you\
    \ for that.\nI am not used to being saluted.\n\nFear not. Salutes are rarely essayed\
    \ in Hooting Yard, nor are forelocks tugged. I was using a figure of speech.\n\
    Gasp!\n\nOh? Have I hit upon a raw nerve?\nNo, no. My gasp was one of awe, for\
    \ look! Look how the stars are glittering so brightly above that miserable-looking\
    \ hut near the wicket gate!\n\nAh yes, they twinkle so. It is a profound mystery\
    \ that the firmament takes on so sublime an aspect over so humble a hut.\nWhat\
    \ is the hut?\n\nIt is where the Duty Git stockpiles his potatoes. No more, no\
    \ less.\nTell me more about the Duty Git.\n\nI am afraid I am not at liberty to\
    \ do so. I once let slip what I considered a trifling bit of gossip about him\u2014\
    something about his shoes, or his boots, or his head, or his ectoplasm\u2014&\
    \ let me tell you that the ensuing pandaemonium is not something I ever wish to\
    \ witness again for all the tea in China. There is only so much one person can\
    \ take in a lifetime, however long it may please the Lord to eke. Would you care\
    \ for some buns or cake?\nThat's kind of you.\n\nAs I said, Hooting Yard offers\
    \ a warm welcome. There is celery too, if you are peckish.\nThank you. Pansy &\
    \ Frank seem charming, & you have been most solicitous. So I\u2019m rather puzzled\
    \ by your alarming hints about the Duty Git.\n\nNo doubt you want to know what\
    \ in the name of heaven he does with all those potatoes!\nNot particularly. It's\
    \ just that you make him sound so fearsome & terrifying.\n\nHe is indeed. He is\
    \ an excellent myrmidon & no mistake. Now, if you will finish munching that celery\
    \ & sweep up the crumbs from the bun I gave you, I shall take you by the hand,\
    \ or should I say mitten, & lead you fondly into Hooting Yard. Tarry a while,\
    \ stay alert, & try your best not to frighten the owls."
