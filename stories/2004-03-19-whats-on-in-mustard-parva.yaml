  text: 'My diving helmet is made of gleaming brass. I polish it once a week, on Friday
    afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle fourteen
    voots to a bucolic hamlet called Mustard Parva. (Curiously, there is no neighbouring
    village named Mustard Magna, although a rustic barnyard person I met while drinking
    a pot of gaar in the local gaar-pot drinking hut told me that there had once been
    such a place. In the year of his birth, this toothless derelict said, the sizeable
    cluster of wooden buildings known as Mustard Magna had been invaded by a sloth
    of bears, many hundreds of them, driven insane by ergot poisoning, each bear capable
    of destroying a humble peasant dwelling with a single thwack from its mighty paw.
    Two hours after the first bear lumbered across Sawdust Bridge, the village was
    completely obliterated. It is still shown on some maps.) Jamming my bicycle into
    a kiosk on Mustard Parva''s Yoko Ono Boulevard, I join six or seven other diving
    helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. Huddled together in the upstairs room
    of a building fast succumbing to dry rot, we discuss our diving helmets and take
    lamentably inaccurate minutes which are published regularly through the good offices
    of the Mustard Parva Thing, whose editor is none other than the blind cousin of
    Marigold Chew.
