  text: 'The logophiliac barber Nuttawood Sirinuntananon used the above five sentences
    from Knox''s pulp non-classic as the basis for a word game which he unsuccessfully
    marketed under the name Johnfowlesopoly. Despite its commercial failure, the game
    is a great favourite at Hooting Yard, and the rules (such as they are) are simple.

    Taking the adjectives from Knox''s passage--in alphabetical order, bestial, big,
    debauched, fashionable, foreign-made, jaded, neurotic, sickening, and whirling--players
    are given five minutes to compose a very short tale suitable as a bedtime story
    for infants. All nine adjectives must be used, but free rein is given for the
    rest of the text. Extra points are awarded if the word plodded is also included.

    Readers are encouraged to play this at home on one of those dismal evenings when
    life seems unbearable, and to send in their entries for inclusion in a forthcoming
    anthology.'
