  text: 'There was an enticing news item on the radio this morning. Here are the bare
    bones of the story--no doubt further details are available in the newspapers,
    but I don''t really want to know. This has a beauty of its own:

    A brain surgeon at a British hospital has been suspended from duty. His crime?
    He took a second helping of soup from the staff canteen and did not pay for it.
    His defence? He was just getting some extra croutons. The matter has been raised
    in the House of Lords.'
