  text: "There was an enticing news item on the radio this morning. Here are the bare\
    \ bones of the story\u2014no doubt further details are available in the newspapers,\
    \ but I don't really want to know. This has a beauty of its own:\nA brain surgeon\
    \ at a British hospital has been suspended from duty. His crime? He took a second\
    \ helping of soup from the staff canteen and did not pay for it. His defence?\
    \ He was just getting some extra croutons. The matter has been raised in the House\
    \ of Lords."
