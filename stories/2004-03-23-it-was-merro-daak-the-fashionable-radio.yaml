  text: "\u201C[It was] Merro Daak, the fashionable radio astrologer, whose name was\
    \ on every woman's tongue. Slade had seen him often, passing through the village\
    \ in his big foreign-made car, with his jaded and debauched companions, on whose\
    \ neurotic faces Slade's eye had read the imprint of sickening abnormalities.\
    \ Did the orgies which were said to go on in Merro Daak's house have any bearing\
    \ on these bestial atrocities? Slade plodded back to his car. His brain was a\
    \ whirling chaos.\u201D \u2014 John H. Knox, The Thing That Dined On Death"
