  text: '"[It was] Merro Daak, the fashionable radio astrologer, whose name was on
    every woman''s tongue. Slade had seen him often, passing through the village in
    his big foreign-made car, with his jaded and debauched companions, on whose neurotic
    faces Slade''s eye had read the imprint of sickening abnormalities. Did the orgies
    which were said to go on in Merro Daak''s house have any bearing on these bestial
    atrocities? Slade plodded back to his car. His brain was a whirling chaos." --
