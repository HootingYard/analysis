  text: "On 17th March we promised that a signed self-portrait of Mrs Gubbins would\
    \ be made available to readers.\n\nI am afraid that the picture, which indeed\
    \ bears a striking resemblance to Mrs Gubbins, is in fact a forgery. Our art consultant,\
    \ Vidiadhar Engineer, has subjected the portrait to a battery of often alarming\
    \ tests, some of which involve volatile chemicals, and has concluded that \u201C\
    the penmanship could not have come from Mrs Gubbins' palsy-withered hand. It is\
    \ clearly a fake.\u201D Reader Sam Byrne has confessed to the imposture, and Mrs\
    \ Gubbins has been arrested."
