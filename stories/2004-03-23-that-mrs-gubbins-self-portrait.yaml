  text: 'On 17th March we promised that a signed self-portrait of Mrs Gubbins would
    be made available to readers.


    I am afraid that the picture, which indeed bears a striking resemblance to Mrs
    Gubbins, is in fact a forgery. Our art consultant, Vidiadhar Engineer, has subjected
    the portrait to a battery of often alarming tests, some of which involve volatile
    chemicals, and has concluded that "the penmanship could not have come from Mrs
    Gubbins'' palsy-withered hand. It is clearly a fake." Reader Sam Byrne has confessed
    to the imposture, and Mrs Gubbins has been arrested.'
