  text: "On Friday 12th March we referred to Dobson's short-lived contract with Ladybird\
    \ Books, which saw the publication of just one work. It has long been argued,\
    \ by the indefatigable Dobson scholar Jasper Poxhaven, that a second book was\
    \ planned, and\u2014more controversially\u2014that dust-jackets were printed for\
    \ the new title so that it could be included in Ladybird's 1960 catalogue. When\
    \ Dobson failed to deliver his manuscript, says Poxhaven, the proposal was quietly\
    \ dropped, an erratum slip was inserted into the catalogues, and the dust-jackets\
    \ were torn up and donated to the Pang Hill Orphanage for use in p\xE2pier mach\xE9\
    \ projects. All traces of the book were then lost, and it became one of the so-called\
    \ \u201CPhantom Dobsons\u201D, those much-discussed works of which there appear\
    \ to be hints and vestiges in the documentary record, yet which elude even the\
    \ Poxhavens of this world.*\nLast week, however, while taking a cigarette break,\
    \ the same Poxhaven was caught in a downpour and took shelter in a derelict kiosk\
    \ abutting the Port of Tongs flag-and-pennant warehouse. The scholar was astonished\
    \ to see, pasted to the crumbling wall of the kiosk with proprietary paste, a\
    \ copy of the lost Dobson dust-jacket. Gingerly, he unpeeled it from the wall,\
    \ put it in his satchel, and cycled furiously to the Dobson Building, where it\
    \ is now on temporary display next to a pile of towels in the laundry room.\n\n\
    * NOTE : Aloysius Nestingbird has compared the \u201CPhantom Dobsons\u201D to\
    \ the Sherlock Holmes cases which Dr Watson mentions in passing, but which were\
    \ never written up as part of the canon. Three of these in particular hold me\
    \ spellbound: \u201Cthe case of the bogus laundry\u201D, alluded to in The Adventure\
    \ Of The Cardboard Box, \u201Cthe singular affair of the aluminium crutch\u201D\
    \ noted in The Adventure Of The Musgrave Ritual, and, best of all, the magnificent\
    \ case of \u201Cthe politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant\u201D\
    \ in The Adventure Of The Veiled Lodger."
