  text: 'On Friday 12th March we referred to Dobson''s short-lived contract with Ladybird
    Books, which saw the publication of just one work. It has long been argued, by
    the indefatigable Dobson scholar Jasper Poxhaven, that a second book was planned,
    and--more controversially--that dust-jackets were printed for the new title so
    that it could be included in Ladybird''s 1960 catalogue. When Dobson failed to
    deliver his manuscript, says Poxhaven, the proposal was quietly dropped, an erratum
    slip was inserted into the catalogues, and the dust-jackets were torn up and donated
    to the Pang Hill Orphanage for use in papier mache projects. All traces of the
    book were then lost, and it became one of the so-called "Phantom Dobsons", those
    much-discussed works of which there appear to be hints and vestiges in the documentary
    record, yet which elude even the Poxhavens of this world.*

    Last week, however, while taking a cigarette break, the same Poxhaven was caught
    in a downpour and took shelter in a derelict kiosk abutting the Port of Tongs
    flag-and-pennant warehouse. The scholar was astonished to see, pasted to the crumbling
    wall of the kiosk with proprietary paste, a copy of the lost Dobson dust-jacket.
    Gingerly, he unpeeled it from the wall, put it in his satchel, and cycled furiously
    to the Dobson Building, where it is now on temporary display next to a pile of
    towels in the laundry room.


    * NOTE : Aloysius Nestingbird has compared the "Phantom Dobsons" to the Sherlock
    Holmes cases which Dr Watson mentions in passing, but which were never written
    up as part of the canon. Three of these in particular hold me spellbound: "the
    case of the bogus laundry", alluded to in The Adventure Of The Cardboard Box,
    "the singular affair of the aluminium crutch" noted in The Adventure Of The Musgrave
    Ritual, and, best of all, the magnificent case of "the politician, the lighthouse,
    and the trained cormorant" in The Adventure Of The Veiled Lodger.'
