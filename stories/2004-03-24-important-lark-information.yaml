  text: 'Imagine, just for a moment, that you live in ancient Latvia. Now look at
    today''s date. Gosh! It''s Kazimiras Diena, the festival which commemorates the
    return of the larks! Being an ancient Latvian, you know full well that larks are
    passerine birds of the predominantly Old World family Alaudidae, small terrestrial
    birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. Often, you have pointed
    out to your ancient Latvian pals that larks nest on the ground, laying between
    two to six speckled eggs. Sometimes you get into arguments with your ancient Latvian
    next hut neighbour, who insists that most larks are fairly dull in appearance.
    Both of you agree, however, that their food is insects and seeds. Now, amity restored,
    you set off arm in arm with your neighbour for the festival.

    "Look, Arvids," you say, pointing to a nearby bird, "a lark!"


    "Indeed it is, Egils," says your neighbour, "But what species of lark do you suppose
    it is?"

    "Well now, Arvids, I must confess I''m not entirely sure! There are so many different
    species of larks! Monotonous, Singing Bush, Australasian Bush, Latakoo, White-tailed,
    Madagascar, Kordofan, Williams'', Friedmann''s, Red-winged, Somali Long-billed,
    Ash''s, Angola, Rufous-naped, Flappet, Clapper, Collared, Indian Bush, Gillett''s,
    Fawn-colored, Rufous-winged Bush, Rusty, Pink-breasted, Degodi, and Sabota, to
    name but twenty five!"

    "Egils, Egils!" replies Arvids, "Are you not forgetting the Rufous-rumped, Dusky,
    Archer''s, Sidamo, Rudd''s, Cape, the Algulhas-, Eastern-, and Karoo Long-billed,
    Benguela, Short-clawed, Dune, Karoo, Barlow''s, Ferruginous, and Spike-heeled
    larks, to say nothing of the sparrow larks?"

    "Sparrow larks, Arvids?" you ask, plaintively.

    "Yes, Egils. Not just the Black-eared and the Chestnut-backed, but the Black-crowned
    and Gray-backed and Chestnut-headed and Fischer''s and Ashy-crowned!"

    "Oh, of course, Arvids," you say, "Now you come to mention it, I used to have
    a tame Chestnut-headed Sparrow lark."

    "Are you sure that''s what it was, Egils?" challenges Arvids, a fierce look in
    his blazing eyes, "Quite sure it wasn''t a Bar-tailed, Rufous-tailed, Desert,
    Gray''s, Greater or Lesser Hoopoe, Thick-billed, Calandra, Bimaculated, Tibetan,
    Mongolian, or White-winged lark?"

    You are now beginning to feel defeated by your neighbour''s superior knowledge.

    "I suppose it might have been a Black or a Greater Short-toed lark, Arvids," you
    whimper.

    "Well, that''s as may be," says Arvids, "But what about the lark over there which
    has now taken up a perch on the branch of that lightning-struck pugton tree? Is
    it a Blanford''s, Hume''s, Lesser Short-toed, Red-capped, Asian Short-toed, Sand,
    Somali Short-toed, Pink-billed, Botha''s, Sclater''s, Obbia, Masked, Dunn''s,
    or Stark''s lark, do you think?"

    "It''s definitely not a Stark''s," you say, confidence boosted a little, "Although
    perhaps it might be a Dupont''s, Thekla, Malabar, Sun, Tawny, Long-billed, Short-tailed,
    Wood, or Skylark, Arvids."

    "Pshaw, Egils! You will be telling me next it is a Japanese, Oriental or Razo
    skylark! Or even a Horned or Shore or Temminck''s lark!"

    "Well at least I know it''s not a Magpie lark, Arvids," you shout, "Which is actually
    neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant Monarch flycatcher."

    "I am well aware of that, Egils," your neighbour ripostes.

    By this time the bird, which is in fact a Crested lark, has flown away, and raindrops
    are beginning to fall in ancient Latvia.
