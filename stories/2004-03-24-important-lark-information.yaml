  text: "Imagine, just for a moment, that you live in ancient Latvia. Now look at\
    \ today's date. Gosh! It's Kazimiras Diena, the festival which commemorates the\
    \ return of the larks! Being an ancient Latvian, you know full well that larks\
    \ are passerine birds of the predominantly Old World family Alaudidae, small terrestrial\
    \ birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. Often, you have pointed\
    \ out to your ancient Latvian pals that larks nest on the ground, laying between\
    \ two to six speckled eggs. Sometimes you get into arguments with your ancient\
    \ Latvian next hut neighbour, who insists that most larks are fairly dull in appearance.\
    \ Both of you agree, however, that their food is insects and seeds. Now, amity\
    \ restored, you set off arm in arm with your neighbour for the festival.\n\u201C\
    Look, Arvids,\u201D you say, pointing to a nearby bird, \u201Ca lark!\u201D\n\n\
    \u201CIndeed it is, Egils,\u201D says your neighbour, \u201CBut what species of\
    \ lark do you suppose it is?\u201D\n\u201CWell now, Arvids, I must confess I'm\
    \ not entirely sure! There are so many different species of larks! Monotonous,\
    \ Singing Bush, Australasian Bush, Latakoo, White-tailed, Madagascar, Kordofan,\
    \ Williams', Friedmann's, Red-winged, Somali Long-billed, Ash's, Angola, Rufous-naped,\
    \ Flappet, Clapper, Collared, Indian Bush, Gillett's, Fawn-colored, Rufous-winged\
    \ Bush, Rusty, Pink-breasted, Degodi, and Sabota, to name but twenty five!\u201D\
    \n\u201CEgils, Egils!\u201D replies Arvids, \u201CAre you not forgetting the Rufous-rumped,\
    \ Dusky, Archer's, Sidamo, Rudd's, Cape, the Algulhas-, Eastern-, and Karoo Long-billed,\
    \ Benguela, Short-clawed, Dune, Karoo, Barlow's, Ferruginous, and Spike-heeled\
    \ larks, to say nothing of the sparrow larks?\u201D\n\u201CSparrow larks, Arvids?\u201D\
    \ you ask, plaintively.\n\u201CYes, Egils. Not just the Black-eared and the Chestnut-backed,\
    \ but the Black-crowned and Gray-backed and Chestnut-headed and Fischer's and\
    \ Ashy-crowned!\u201D\n\u201COh, of course, Arvids,\u201D you say, \u201CNow you\
    \ come to mention it, I used to have a tame Chestnut-headed Sparrow lark.\u201D\
    \n\u201CAre you sure that's what it was, Egils?\u201D challenges Arvids, a fierce\
    \ look in his blazing eyes, \u201CQuite sure it wasn't a Bar-tailed, Rufous-tailed,\
    \ Desert, Gray's, Greater or Lesser Hoopoe, Thick-billed, Calandra, Bimaculated,\
    \ Tibetan, Mongolian, or White-winged lark?\u201D\nYou are now beginning to feel\
    \ defeated by your neighbour's superior knowledge.\n\u201CI suppose it might have\
    \ been a Black or a Greater Short-toed lark, Arvids,\u201D you whimper.\n\u201C\
    Well, that's as may be,\u201D says Arvids, \u201CBut what about the lark over\
    \ there which has now taken up a perch on the branch of that lightning-struck\
    \ pugton tree? Is it a Blanford's, Hume's, Lesser Short-toed, Red-capped, Asian\
    \ Short-toed, Sand, Somali Short-toed, Pink-billed, Botha's, Sclater's, Obbia,\
    \ Masked, Dunn's, or Stark's lark, do you think?\u201D\n\u201CIt's definitely\
    \ not a Stark's,\u201D you say, confidence boosted a little, \u201CAlthough perhaps\
    \ it might be a Dupont's, Thekla, Malabar, Sun, Tawny, Long-billed, Short-tailed,\
    \ Wood, or Skylark, Arvids.\u201D\n\u201CPshaw, Egils! You will be telling me\
    \ next it is a Japanese, Oriental or Razo skylark! Or even a Horned or Shore or\
    \ Temminck's lark!\u201D\n\u201CWell at least I know it's not a Magpie lark, Arvids,\u201D\
    \ you shout, \u201CWhich is actually neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant\
    \ Monarch flycatcher.\u201D\n\u201CI am well aware of that, Egils,\u201D your\
    \ neighbour ripostes.\nBy this time the bird, which is in fact a Crested lark,\
    \ has flown away, and raindrops are beginning to fall in ancient Latvia.\nHooting\
    \ Yard recommends Wikipedia."
