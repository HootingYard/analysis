  text: "\u201CLet us picture the case of a broken-hearted maiden forced to reject\
    \ an ardent lover because duty calls him to a land where there are snakes. Think\
    \ of his happiness blighted for ever and her doomed to a perpetual maidenhood,\
    \ harrowed with remorseful dreams of the hourly perils and horrors through which\
    \ he must be passing without her, and dreading to enter an academy or picture-gallery\
    \ lest a laocoon or a fury might revive apprehensions too horrible to be borne.\
    \ In view of possibilities so dreadful, surely it is a duty that a man owes to\
    \ his kind to disseminate the truth, if he can, about the present condition of\
    \ that reptile which, crawling on its belly and eating dust and having its head\
    \ bruised by the descendants of Eve, sometimes pays off her share of the curse\
    \ on their heels.\u201D \u2014 E H Aitken, Concerning Animals & Other Matters"
