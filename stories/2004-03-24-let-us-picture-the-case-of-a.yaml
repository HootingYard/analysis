  text: '"Let us picture the case of a broken-hearted maiden forced to reject an ardent
    lover because duty calls him to a land where there are snakes. Think of his happiness
    blighted for ever and her doomed to a perpetual maidenhood, harrowed with remorseful
    dreams of the hourly perils and horrors through which he must be passing without
    her, and dreading to enter an academy or picture-gallery lest a laocoon or a fury
    might revive apprehensions too horrible to be borne. In view of possibilities
    so dreadful, surely it is a duty that a man owes to his kind to disseminate the
    truth, if he can, about the present condition of that reptile which, crawling
