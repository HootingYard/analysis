  text: "Due to a production error, the text and pictures which appeared under the\
    \ heading \u201CSix Cows And A Bee\u201D on Friday 19th March were completely\
    \ erroneous. Wool from Mrs Gubbins' knitted tea-cosy began to unravel and somehow\
    \ became entangled in the mainframe, leading to all sorts of hoo-ha. The headline\
    \ was meant to a refer to a piece about the debut performance of a new pop group\
    \ of that name. We hope to run the article as soon as we can spring Mrs Gubbins\
    \ from chokey (see yesterday), although I have to admit that things are running\
    \ quite smoothly in her absence."
