  text: Due to a production error, the text and pictures which appeared under the
    heading "Six Cows And A Bee" on Friday 19th March were completely erroneous. Wool
    from Mrs Gubbins' knitted tea-cosy began to unravel and somehow became entangled
    in the mainframe, leading to all sorts of hoo-ha. The headline was meant to a
    refer to a piece about the debut performance of a new pop group of that name.
    We hope to run the article as soon as we can spring Mrs Gubbins from chokey (see
    yesterday), although I have to admit that things are running quite smoothly in
    her absence.
