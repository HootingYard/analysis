    in 2003


    Lothar Preen

    Just 99 pages long, Lothar Preen''s first novel is slim, even throwaway, and was
    completely ignored by both reviewers and the reading public. It is a particularly
    hackneyed example of the "looking-for-cormorants" genre. The hero, Paler Hornet
    (an obvious anagram of the author), is a young explorer charged by his father
    with going in search of cormorants. In a series of supposed journal entries, Hornet
    describes his failure in prose that is listless, turgid, and littered with innumerable
    misuses of the prepositions by and with. Although he was characteristically contemptuous
    of his detractors, it is no surprise that Lothar Preen waited nearly two decades
    to publish again. But when he did, what a revelation!

    Unleashed upon the world at the height of les evenements of May 1968, Preen''s
    second novel casts a glowering eye upon bourgeois society. By turns caustic, pitiless
    & scathing--and superbly comic--Preen lashes out at sacred cows and shibboleths
    in a manner described by one critic at the time as "like something written by
    the idiot bastard offspring of Ford Madox Ford and Veronica Lake during the final
    gasps of Stalinism". At 1,844 pages, it is one of the longest novels of the 20th
    century. Cunningly--and Preen can be the most artful of writers--this matchless
    stream of invective is disguised as a series of letters home from a peripatetic
    ornithologist engaged in a study of the nesting habits of the curlew. Preen uses
    the narrator''s witlessness, myopia, and inability to tell one bird from another
    as a metaphor for a society in chains. An abridged version for children, with
    four lovely colour plates by Preen''s acolyte Marigold Chew, was issued in 1983.

    As if to confound those who saw him as a radical, Lothar Preen''s next book was
    a delicate, miniaturist evocation of domesticity set in an idyllic barnyard. Full
    of countryside wisdom and bosky charm, it was condemned as trash, and rightly
    so.

    Loathsome! Ach, loathsome is the man whose flesh is the colour of spinach, whose
    hat stinks, who sharpens pencils by daylight and whose nights are beset by dreams
    of eerie albino hens The opening lines of Preen''s fourth novel have been quoted
    so widely & so often that it comes as a shock to learn that they are absent from
    all but the very final draft of this majestic tour de force which won the Groot,
    Pang, Fledgling, Gobbo & Musty Spillage awards, to name only a few, for if I were
    to list all the honours lavished on this mighty tome we would be here all day
    and even you, gentle reader, even you would begin to yawn and scratch your head,
    from which no doubt beetles would fall.

    Wherein lies the peculiar genius of Befuddled By Linnets? At first glance it is
    a simple tale--indeed, the Korean critic Park No Lip dismissed it as "cretinous",
    although he later wrote a lengthy retraction before swallowing poison in the laundry
    room of a shabby hotel. (His widow was imprisoned & his children languished in
    an orphanage--a point to ponder for those who dared to cross Lothar Preen!)

    The novel, divided into no less than four thousand short chapters, arranged alphabetically
    by opening lines, follows the progress of a would-be scientist named Pearl E.
    Thorn as she trudges through various patches of woodland listening out for the
    characteristic "chi chi chi chi" song of the linnet. But Thorn is no ornithologist--she
    is an oceanographer with a sideline in amateur map-making--and she is also hard
    of hearing. According to notes rescued from the charred shell of Preen''s so-called
    "Potato Building", where he lived and worked for nearly thirty years before it
    burned down in 1989, the character was originally intended to be profoundly deaf
    (and, by the by, one-legged). Once again, Preen appears to have made an incredible
    number of changes to the final draft, restoring not only some hearing to his heroine--in
    her right ear: the left remains useless--but completely rewriting the long central
    section in which what appears to be a flock of cassowaries is yoked irreversibly
    to the heroine''s dismal fate. It is a moot point whether flock is the correct
    noun of assemblage for the cassowary, but research must come to a stop somewhere
    and I have now got a headache, as you can imagine. You would too if you were to
    read all of Lothar Preen''s books at one sitting. Be that as it may, there is
    an unbearable poignancy in Pearl E. Thorn''s growing realisation that she is unable
    to distinguish between the exquisite song of the linnet and the raucousness of
    crows, corncrakes, and all those other birds that make such a gruesome racket.

    Preen''s adoption of a female narrative voice was much praised for its authenticity,
    although I have to say that, for me, it is woefully unconvincing. I side with
    the anonymous reviewer who disparaged the author''s attempt to "join the Brothers
    Johnson in the Land of Ladies", an amusing reference to the American funk duo
    who had a measure of popularity in the 1970s. Preen, of course, despised funk,
    as evidenced by his ferocious essay Thunderous Execrations Of Things Both Abominable
    & Ripe For Obliteration Which I Would Willingly Tear To Smithereens With My Bare
    Hands, Cackling With Obscene Glee As I Did So (1977).

    Dismissed as worthless when published thirty years to the day after Preen''s fictional
    debut, time has been kind to his fifth novel. Written in the form of an instructional
    manual for children, it has all the charm of a catechism mixed with the faintly
    sordid air of belle epoque pornography. It is also Preen''s only foray into science
    fiction, an unexpected departure to be sure, given that he clearly had no sympathy
    for, nor understanding of, the genre. Yet somehow the writing has a mischievousness
    which has made it Preen''s most popular book. The moorhens of the title, incidentally,
    only look like moorhens, or at least what Preen fondly imagined moorhens to look
    like. They are in fact a race of super-ignorant beings from a dying planet in
    a distant galaxy. The author quotes freely from both Epictetus and Gerard Manley
    Hopkins, though not to any apparent purpose. Nevertheless, an entertaining enough
    romp and perfect holiday reading.

    Frankly indigestible, this monstrous work--at 1,748 pages only a little shorter
    than Bamboozled by Curlews--has divided its critics since that strange day at
    the end of March 1981 when it hit the bookshops just as the news was announced
    of the death of De Witt Wallace, founder of the Reader''s Digest. Much blood has
    been spilled over the placing of that apostrophe, not least Lothar Preen''s. Throughout
    his life, the novelist was a fanatical devotee of the magazine, regularly penning
    articles such as I Am John''s Cardigan and It Pays To Incite Your Witch Doctor,
    none of which was ever published. Legend has it that there exists somewhere an
    archive of Wallace''s letters to his indomitable--if unsolicited--contributor,
    from the early, polite rejections to the last, desperate pleas, insults and threats.
    Preen ignored all of them, firing off ill-written drivel to the magazine virtually
    every month for decades. We are perhaps fortunate that he kept copies of only
    a fraction of his output, and that the Reader''s Digest consigned every last scrap
    of it to the bonfire.When he heard of Wallace''s death, Preen locked himself in
    the Potato Building for a period of mourning, and refused to appear in public
    to promote his new novel, about which I shall say only this: there is a mildly
    amusing paragraph on page 16, a choice use of synecdoche on page 833, a superb
    neologism at the end of chapter 53, and a misprint in the very last line.

    Having turned his hand to science fiction, Preen unwisely decided to have a bash
    at a crime novel. Surmising that all fictional detectives must have trademark
    idiosyncracies or foibles, he made his Captain "Ern" Plethora a retired Jesuit
    whaling ship''s chaplain with a club foot and a tattoo of a star on his forehead,
    whose hobbies include pole-vaulting, testing for pH values, & repairing churns.
    In fact, so many pages are spent trying to elicit the reader''s interest in this
    preposterous figure that Preen quite forgets about his plot, which begins in incoherence
    and peters out into what I have elsewhere dubbed "grandiloquent stupidity". I
    repeat this remark despite the fact that when it first appeared in print one of
    Preen''s trained brutes abducted me and nearly drowned me in an ornamental pond
    somewhere near Blister Lane Gasworks.

    By the late 1980s, as Lothar Preen the musician became ever more lauded--this
    was, lest we forget, the decade of the Sonatina & Variations: Homage a Ricardo
    Montalban--Preen the novelist was considered largely a spent force. Not one of
    his books was still in print, and no publisher of repute would touch him. Indeed,
    it was only through his criminal connections in the taverns of Marseilles that
    Dumbstruck by Bitterns ever saw the light of day. The Eternal Palace of Literature
    must forever be grateful to the grimy, hirsute matelot whose nefarious intrigues
    led to the meeting of Lothar Preen and F X Duggleby. It was Duggleby--deranged,
    revolting and crapulous, but also erudite, wealthy and given to wearing particularly
    decisive cravats--who became Preen''s champion, setting up his Editions de Duggleby
    imprint to issue the by now monocular author''s work. The first fruit of the partnership
    was this awe-inspiring roman a clef in which Preen creates an alternative history
    of 19th century Greenland. Those new to Preen are invariably astonished at the
    facility--the lightness!--with which a straightforward story about a team of bird-spotters
    on a futile expedition to find bitterns above the Arctic Circle is transformed
    into a multi-layered prose-fantasia of matchless genius. Vivid and towering, it
    remains Preen''s greatest achievement, and it is somehow fitting that all royalties
    he earned from it were used to fund a string of gambling dens in iniquitous ports
    and grubby harbours.

    "To sail the sea is an occupation at once repulsive and attractive" wrote Hilaire
    Belloc. It is a sentiment with which Lothar Preen concurred. The maritime world
    was one which informed so much of his music, yet his fiction remained stubbornly
    land-locked--until the sudden, late glory of his ninth novel. Its conception we
    owe to Duggleby. The drink-crazed billionaire lured Preen on to his crumbling
    wooden yacht and headed for the middle of one of the oceans, I am not sure which
    one, refusing to let the ageing author ashore until he had written a "tale of
    the sea". For the first three weeks, Preen cursed and sulked by turns, until he
    collapsed with a fever brought on by proximity to bilgewater. Once recovered,
    he set to his task, sitting at a worm-eaten escritoire on the orlop deck, lashed
    by tropical storms or possibly icy gales, depending upon the geography. The result
    was this brief 102-page spine-tingler in which guillemots confound the spluttering,
    pneumonia-racked narrator.

    Lothar Preen''s final work of fiction is unreadable. Self-consciously "experimental",
    it was written in the space of five hours on the upper deck of a bus plying the
    route between some god-forsaken village full of priests and imbeciles and the
    hot air balloon launch station at Mustard Parva. By now a cantankerous and bitter
    old man, Preen was estranged from Duggleby and his tough sailor pals. Even the
    loyal Marigold Chew (1955-1998) was fed up to the back teeth with him. In a previously
    unpublished letter written from her deathbed, Chew wrote:

    "By then [i.e. the Year of Our Lord MCMXCVI] he was having constant pangs. His
    brow had become ignoble and his hair was often rife with breadcrumbs. He lacked
    dash. I would place pots of soup in front of his Cyclopean visage, only to discover
    him hours later wandering aimlessly around shops that sold or rented camping equipment.
    His blotchy flesh was blotchier still. He used to creak when he brushed those
    once-glistening teeth. I had thought them superb, long ago, those Preen-fangs.
    Must our gods be so frail? I suppose they must. And yet part of me wishes still
    to bless his cotton socks."

    On St Mungo''s Day 1997, on a glamorous morning bright with spangled sunbeams,
    Lothar Preen died. Like a dog.'
