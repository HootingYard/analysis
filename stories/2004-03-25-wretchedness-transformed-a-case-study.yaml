  text: "\u201CVermin with wings\u201D was the memorable phrase used by newt-fancying\
    \ Mayor of London Ken Livingstone to describe pigeons. He has a point. Sometimes\
    \ it seems as if nowhere in our capital city is free from pigeon shit. They're\
    \ grubby birds. Even the supposedly healthy ones look disease-ridden. And that\
    \ eerie, unholy noise they make\u2014the soundtrack to nightmares. I know otherwise\
    \ saintly people\u2014Francis of Assisis in the making\u2014who would gladly bludgeon,\
    \ stamp on, or maim pigeons to make the world a better place. Well.\nMy theory\
    \ is that our attitude to Ken's \u201Cvermin\u201D has a lot to do with the associations\u2014\
    such as those above\u2014which crowd our heads when we hear the word \u201Cpigeon\u201D\
    . Our ability to take an objective view of the birds is lost. Just as we would\
    \ find it difficult to maintain an air of suave politeness if introduced to a\
    \ woman, only to learn that her first name was Condoleezza, we cannot escape the\
    \ involuntary, Lovecraftian shudderings elicited by certain words and names.\n\
    There is a way forward, if we are prepared\u2014in this instance\u2014to approach\
    \ ornithological taxonomy with a devil-may-care looseness. Some breeds of pigeon\
    \ have lovely names. Ever since I began to think of these shit-riddled birds as\
    \ cumulets, my heart swells with pangs of joy at the sight of them, which is as\
    \ it should be on this miraculous and lovely planet. And who\u2014apart from the\
    \ likes of Condoleezza Rice\u2014could fail to have tender feelings towards a\
    \ Czech ice pouter?\n\nLeft, Cumulet. Centre, Czech ice pouter. Right, Terrifying\
    \ giant bee (one of a swarm, not shown)."
