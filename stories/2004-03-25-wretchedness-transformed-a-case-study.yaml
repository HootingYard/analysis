  text: '"Vermin with wings" was the memorable phrase used by newt-fancying Mayor
    of London Ken Livingstone to describe pigeons. He has a point. Sometimes it seems
    as if nowhere in our capital city is free from pigeon shit. They''re grubby birds.
    Even the supposedly healthy ones look disease-ridden. And that eerie, unholy noise
    they make--the soundtrack to nightmares. I know otherwise saintly people--Francis
    of Assisis in the making--who would gladly bludgeon, stamp on, or maim pigeons
    to make the world a better place. Well.

    My theory is that our attitude to Ken''s "vermin" has a lot to do with the associations--such
    as those above--which crowd our heads when we hear the word "pigeon". Our ability
    to take an objective view of the birds is lost. Just as we would find it difficult
    to maintain an air of suave politeness if introduced to a woman, only to learn
    that her first name was Condoleezza, we cannot escape the involuntary, Lovecraftian
    shudderings elicited by certain words and names.

    There is a way forward, if we are prepared--in this instance--to approach ornithological
    taxonomy with a devil-may-care looseness. Some breeds of pigeon have lovely names.
    Ever since I began to think of these shit-riddled birds as cumulets, my heart
    swells with pangs of joy at the sight of them, which is as it should be on this
    miraculous and lovely planet. And who--apart from the likes of Condoleezza Rice--could
    fail to have tender feelings towards a Czech ice pouter?


    Left, Cumulet. Centre, Czech ice pouter. Right, Terrifying giant bee (one of a
    swarm, not shown).'
