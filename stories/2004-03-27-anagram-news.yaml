  text: A new Broadway musical is opening soon, based on a story in which domestic
    poultry gorge themselves on grain, drink vast quantities of rainwater from a trough,
    and flap about in an irresponsible manner. Appropriately, the music for Pet Hens'
    Hedonism has been composed by Stephen Sondheim.
