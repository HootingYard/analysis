  text: 'In Britain, the day after Christmas is known as Boxing Day. Curiously, the
    day after Pansy Cradledew Day has not been accorded its own name. A plenary session
    of the Hooting Yard Miscellaneous Matters Of Towering Importance Committee was
    convened to address the issue. It was swiftly agreed that a name for the post-Pansy
    day should be in some way related to "boxing", but frantic arguments raged for
    minutes whether the allusion was to packaging or fighting. Some members of the
    committee wanted to plump immediately for Wrestling Day. They were silenced when
    member F X Duggleby provided unassailable evidence that the "boxing" referred
    to boxes, and had not a jot nor tittle to do with contact sports.

    This point decided, the committee went into recess, and partook of a superb lunch
    of shredded watercress and boiled duckpond water, then engaged in post-prandial
    calisthenics (think trampolines and medicine balls). Brain scans completed, the
    committee members shuffled back into the Big Overwhelming Hall, with its gleaming
    linoleum, important-looking wallpaper, and empty birdcages.

    The afternoon session reviewed a wide variety of boxes and packaging materials,
    and eventually voted between two options: Big Unwieldy Crate Day or Jiffy(tm)
    Bag Day. The latter was carried by four thousand and eight votes to six.
