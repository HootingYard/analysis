  text: '"Yet, was his beauty not amiable, but rather calculated to inspire terror
    and distrust, than affection and confidence: in fact, a bandit may be uncommonly
    handsome; but, by the fierce, haughty character of his countenance, the fire which
    flashes from his eyes, and the contempt which curls his mustachoed lip, create
    fear, instead of winning regard, and this was the case with Charles. One, however,
    of those maidens, unto whom it was the folly and vanity of his youth to pay general
    court, conceived for him a passion deep and pure, which in semblance, at least,
    he returned; but how far to answer his own nefarious purposes, for Charles Elliott
    was a godless young man, we shall hereafter discover." -- Miss M L Beevor, The
    Huntsman : A Traditionary Tale'
