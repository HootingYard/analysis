  text: "\u201CYet, was his beauty not amiable, but rather calculated to inspire terror\
    \ and distrust, than affection and confidence: in fact, a bandit may be uncommonly\
    \ handsome; but, by the fierce, haughty character of his countenance, the fire\
    \ which flashes from his eyes, and the contempt which curls his mustachoed lip,\
    \ create fear, instead of winning regard, and this was the case with Charles.\
    \ One, however, of those maidens, unto whom it was the folly and vanity of his\
    \ youth to pay general court, conceived for him a passion deep and pure, which\
    \ in semblance, at least, he returned; but how far to answer his own nefarious\
    \ purposes, for Charles Elliott was a godless young man, we shall hereafter discover.\u201D\
