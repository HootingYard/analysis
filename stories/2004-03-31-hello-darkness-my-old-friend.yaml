  text: 'I''ve come to talk with you again. I''ve had a nightmare about a hen. I''d
    been abandoned, in my pyjamas, in a desolate fen. The hen approached me, clucking.
    Seldom have I heard so eldritch a cluck from a domestic fowl. I was thoroughly
    unnerved. In the nightmare, believing that I had awoken, I was chewing my pillow
    and my mouth was full of feathers and I began to choke. But I did not wake. The
    hen pecked at something on the ground. I was no longer in a fen. I was standing
    in the middle of a field splattered with buttercups, holding a big iron slab of
    dubious utility. I looked at it very carefully, and saw that a stanza of Emily
    Dickinson''s had been scratched on it: Its little Ether Hood--Doth sit upon its
    Head--The millinery supple--Of the sagacious God. Now I was spectacularly terrified!
    The Belle of Amherst dream, that had plagued me for two decades until Dr Snap
    prescribed his balm and unguents, had returned to haunt me! Somehow I was conscious
    that I was thrashing about in my bed and yet I remained transfixed in sleep. The
    noise made by the hen grew louder. Knowing that "a hen who has merely laid an
    egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid", I looked desperately around me. Though
    I could hear it, the hen had vanished. The iron slab weighed heavy. Now I was
    knee deep in water. I began to shout, echoing Edgar Allan Poe''s dying words:
    "Reynolds! Reynolds! ... Reynolds!" At the last cry, mercifully, I awoke. I jumped
    out of bed immediately and plunged my head into a nearby pail of icy water. Then
    I went to the window, and looked out at the bright morning. Rustic farmyard persons
    were trudging up the hill over by Bodger''s Spinney. A booby and a godwit sang.'
