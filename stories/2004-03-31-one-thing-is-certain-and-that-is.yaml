  text: "\u201COne thing is certain, and that is that I have embarked upon an extraordinary\
    \ adventure, that will end\u2026? In what manner I know not. I dare not even imagine\
    \ what the upshot of it will be. Anyhow, it is my intention to commit to memory,\
    \ minute by minute, the least circumstance, and then, if it be possible, to jot\
    \ down my daily impressions. Who knows what the future has in store for me? And\
    \ who knows but what, in my new position, I may finally discover the secret of\
    \ Roth's fulgurator?\u201D \u2014 Jules Verne, Face au drapeau"
