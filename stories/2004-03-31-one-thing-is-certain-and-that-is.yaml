  text: '"One thing is certain, and that is that I have embarked upon an extraordinary
    adventure, that will end...? In what manner I know not. I dare not even imagine
    what the upshot of it will be. Anyhow, it is my intention to commit to memory,
    minute by minute, the least circumstance, and then, if it be possible, to jot
    down my daily impressions. Who knows what the future has in store for me? And
    who knows but what, in my new position, I may finally discover the secret of Roth''s
    fulgurator?" -- Jules Verne, Face au drapeau'
