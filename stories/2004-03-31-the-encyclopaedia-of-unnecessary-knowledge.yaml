  text: 'Jasper Poxhaven has claimed that Dobson had as many unrealised or aborted
    projects as there were published pamphlets--and we know how numerous they were!
    Perhaps the most ambitious of these abandoned works is the gargantuan Dobson''s
    Illustrated Encyclopaedia Of Unnecessary Knowledge. From notes scrawled higgledypiggledy
    in various notebooks, we know that the projected work was to extend to forty thick
    volumes of tiny, tiny print, with upwards of twenty thousand articles containing
    millions of words. Some of the pieces were indeed written and appeared as pamphlets,
    but until recently it was thought none of the proposed illustrations were ever
    executed. At a Port of Tongs jumble sale, however, Mrs Gubbins'' nephew happened
    upon a cardboard box full of detritus, buried in which were three drawings. Subjected
    to tremendously exciting forensic analysis by a scientist known only to Jasper
    Poxhaven as "man with unwashed hair", the pictures have now been authenticated.
    They were drawn by Marigold Chew to accompany three of Dobson''s encyclopaedia
    articles; alas and alack, not one of the three was ever written. We are proud
    to publish the pictures here, together with Mr Poxhaven''s brief notes. We have
    given each its own Hooting Yard paragraph-break, because that''s the kind of thing
    we do, especially on Wednesdays.


    It is possible that some trace of Dobson''s text for this article can be found
    in his pamphlet How And Why I Built Eight Small Papier Mache Brontosauruses.


    It is unclear what Dobson meant by the title of this proposed article. Ms Chew''s
    illustation is similarly perplexing. I have applied for a grant which will allow
    me to devote the next four years to unravelling the mystery.


    Self-explanatory.'
