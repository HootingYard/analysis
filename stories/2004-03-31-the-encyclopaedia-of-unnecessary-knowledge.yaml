  text: "Jasper Poxhaven has claimed that Dobson had as many unrealised or aborted\
    \ projects as there were published pamphlets\u2014and we know how numerous they\
    \ were! Perhaps the most ambitious of these abandoned works is the gargantuan\
    \ Dobson's Illustrated Encyclopaedia Of Unnecessary Knowledge. From notes scrawled\
    \ higgledypiggledy in various notebooks, we know that the projected work was to\
    \ extend to forty thick volumes of tiny, tiny print, with upwards of twenty thousand\
    \ articles containing millions of words. Some of the pieces were indeed written\
    \ and appeared as pamphlets, but until recently it was thought none of the proposed\
    \ illustrations were ever executed. At a Port of Tongs jumble sale, however, Mrs\
    \ Gubbins' nephew happened upon a cardboard box full of detritus, buried in which\
    \ were three drawings. Subjected to tremendously exciting forensic analysis by\
    \ a scientist known only to Jasper Poxhaven as \u201Cman with unwashed hair\u201D\
    , the pictures have now been authenticated. They were drawn by Marigold Chew to\
    \ accompany three of Dobson's encyclopaedia articles; alas and alack, not one\
    \ of the three was ever written. We are proud to publish the pictures here, together\
    \ with Mr Poxhaven's brief notes. We have given each its own Hooting Yard paragraph-break,\
    \ because that's the kind of thing we do, especially on Wednesdays.\n\nIt is possible\
    \ that some trace of Dobson's text for this article can be found in his pamphlet\
    \ How And Why I Built Eight Small P\xE2pier Mach\xE9 Brontosauruses.\n\nIt is\
    \ unclear what Dobson meant by the title of this proposed article. Ms Chew's illustation\
    \ is similarly perplexing. I have applied for a grant which will allow me to devote\
    \ the next four years to unravelling the mystery.\n\nSelf-explanatory."
