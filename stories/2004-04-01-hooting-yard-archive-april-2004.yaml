  text: a month which saw hideous and traumatic computer nightmares at Hooting Yard.
    Despite this, you'll be able to read about Mrs Gubbins and her infatuation with
    buttons, a noodlehead in peril, Sopwith's so-called "marsh gas years", and the
    disgusting bilge of Cadet Vig, among other things.
