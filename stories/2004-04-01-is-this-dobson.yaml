  text: 'An anonymous reader has sent what is claimed to be a photograph of Dobson.
    I suspect this to be an April Fool''s Day prank, but have sent the snap to Mr
    Poxhaven, soliciting his expert opinion. The envelope--with a smudged postmark--contained
    nothing else to indicate its provenance. Scribbled on the back of the photograph
    are just three words: "This is Dobson", which is less than helpful as it is unclear
    whether it refers to the child clutching an ice lolly or to the gaunt, bespectacled
    adult behind him.
