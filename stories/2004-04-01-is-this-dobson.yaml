  text: "An anonymous reader has sent what is claimed to be a photograph of Dobson.\
    \ I suspect this to be an April Fool's Day prank, but have sent the snap to Mr\
    \ Poxhaven, soliciting his expert opinion. The envelope\u2014with a smudged postmark\u2014\
    contained nothing else to indicate its provenance. Scribbled on the back of the\
    \ photograph are just three words: \u201CThis is Dobson\u201D, which is less than\
    \ helpful as it is unclear whether it refers to the child clutching an ice lolly\
    \ or to the gaunt, bespectacled adult behind him.\n"
