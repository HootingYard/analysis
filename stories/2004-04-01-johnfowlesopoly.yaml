  text: 'David Stoop has sent in a story from a game of Johnfowlesopoly (see "A Word
    Game", 23rd March).

    Once upon a time, there was a debauched fairy named Bindweed. Bindweed, who liked
    to dress in fashionable, foreign-made fairy clothes, had a fairy sister called
    Ringrot. Ringrot was jaded and neurotic. On the day the big spaceship landed in
    Dandelion Dell, with its whirling propellors, Bindweed and Ringrot went skipping
    along to greet the goo-splattered alien beings.

    "Ugh!" screeched Bindweed, "Aren''t they sickening?"

    Ringrot began to vomit, right next to the spaceship. The goo-splattered alien
    beings were extremely disturbed by this bestial behaviour. They climbed back into
    their spaceship and flew off to another planet, called Zixurg-K79. Goodnight children.

    Our critic writes: David has made a pretty good fist of it, I think. All nine
    adjectives are included, the story is very short, and I would certainly read it
    to my grandchildren at bedtime.'
