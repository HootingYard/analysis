  text: 'Our popular item Mrs Gubbins Recommends has been suspended while that dear
    old crone remains in police custody. Rather than leave readers bereft of exciting
    links to pursue, we asked her colleague Matilda Choctaw to ghost-write the column
    on a temporary basis. Here is her first contribution:

    "That Mrs Gubbins has a complete mania for buttons. Velcro, zips, and other fastening
    methods are completely foreign to her. That being the case, and ignoring the fact
    that she is facing serious criminal charges, I wish to honour her by pointing
    Hooting Yard readers in the direction of the Buttonarium. Now, where did I leave
    my crutches?"'
