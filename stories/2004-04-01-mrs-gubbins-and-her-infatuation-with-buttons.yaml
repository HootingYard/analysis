  text: "Our popular item Mrs Gubbins Recommends has been suspended while that dear\
    \ old crone remains in police custody. Rather than leave readers bereft of exciting\
    \ links to pursue, we asked her colleague Matilda Choctaw to ghost-write the column\
    \ on a temporary basis. Here is her first contribution:\n\u201CThat Mrs Gubbins\
    \ has a complete mania for buttons. Velcro, zips, and other fastening methods\
    \ are completely foreign to her. That being the case, and ignoring the fact that\
    \ she is facing serious criminal charges, I wish to honour her by pointing Hooting\
    \ Yard readers in the direction of the Buttonarium. Now, where did I leave my\
    \ crutches?\u201D"
