  text: '"James I, at the beginning of his reign, to gratify the people, published
    a book of sports, of which the women had some time before participated on Sunday

    wrestling, and other profanations of that day, and which had risen to such a height
    that the land would have been deluged with immorality, if Charles I had not wisely
    shown his piety, by totally abolishing them." -- The Mirror of Literature, Amusement
    and Instruction, Vol. 19, No. 553, 23rd June 1832'
