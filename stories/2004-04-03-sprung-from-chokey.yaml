  text: News has reached us that Mrs Gubbins has been sprung from chokey. (See 23rd
    March for details of her arrest.) She is now holed up in a safe house--or, more
    properly, derelict shed--protected by a heavily-armed gang of thugs wearing boa
    constrictor masks. They are subsisting on a diet of gruel, slops and pap until
    a criminal supply line can be set in place. We will keep you fully informed of
    developments. Please remember them in your prayers.
