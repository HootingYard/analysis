  text: 'Perhaps the novelist Julian Barnes is to blame, since his novel Flaubert''s
    Parrot was a huge bestseller. I haven''t read it myself, so offer no opinion.
    What bothers me is that the title of the book has seemingly cast a spell over
    the entire British publishing industry. That format--[historical figure]''s +
    [everyday or whimsical object]--now infests the shelves of our bookshops to the
    point of teeth-gnashing despair. At first, only fiction caught the bug--Hemingway''s
    Chair and Lenin''s Trousers spring to mind--but once non-fiction contracted the
    virus, the plague was unstoppable. Yesterday, browsing desultorily in Waterstone''s,
    I came upon the following within about five minutes: Pandora''s Breeches; Wittgenstein''s
    Poker; Rembrandt''s Whore; Dorothy Parker''s Elbow; and Schopenhauer''s Porcupines,
    not to mention Schopenhauer''s Telescope. I could go on, but I already feel quite
    ill.

    A significant side-effect of this wretchedness is that in some cases one suspects
    the very content of the book has been twisted to fit the title. Giles Milton''s
    Nathaniel''s Nutmeg was ostensibly a history of the early spice trade, a subject
    of interest in itself. But because of the imperatives of the title, the author
    buoys up a single character--Captain Nathaniel Courthope--and gives him an importance
    in the narrative that is simply unjustifiable. I have no doubt that Giles Milton
    knows this, and knows that it damages his book, but bows to what is required by
    theBritish publishing industry--a contemptible, money-grubbing, market-driven
    playground for the alumni of Oxford and Cambridge universities, rife with nepotism.
    Even the witless goons who run it must surely learn when enough is enough?

    This is one reason, of course, why Hooting Yard appears on the web. Renamed Sir
    Matt Busby''s Cistern or Spinoza''s Rhubarb, it would probably attract a five-figure
    advance ... but only if the content were tailored to meet the requirements of
    the intellectually bankrupt poltroons who sign the cheques. I prefer to plough
    my lonely furrow. End of rant.'
