  text: "Perhaps the novelist Julian Barnes is to blame, since his novel Flaubert's\
    \ Parrot was a huge bestseller. I haven't read it myself, so offer no opinion.\
    \ What bothers me is that the title of the book has seemingly cast a spell over\
    \ the entire British publishing industry. That format\u2014[historical figure]'s\
    \ + [everyday or whimsical object]\u2014now infests the shelves of our bookshops\
    \ to the point of teeth-gnashing despair. At first, only fiction caught the bug\u2014\
    Hemingway's Chair and Lenin's Trousers spring to mind\u2014but once non-fiction\
    \ contracted the virus, the plague was unstoppable. Yesterday, browsing desultorily\
    \ in Waterstone's, I came upon the following within about five minutes: Pandora's\
    \ Breeches; Wittgenstein's Poker; Rembrandt's Whore; Dorothy Parker's Elbow; and\
    \ Schopenhauer's Porcupines, not to mention Schopenhauer's Telescope. I could\
    \ go on, but I already feel quite ill.\nA significant side-effect of this wretchedness\
    \ is that in some cases one suspects the very content of the book has been twisted\
    \ to fit the title. Giles Milton's Nathaniel's Nutmeg was ostensibly a history\
    \ of the early spice trade, a subject of interest in itself. But because of the\
    \ imperatives of the title, the author buoys up a single character\u2014Captain\
    \ Nathaniel Courthope\u2014and gives him an importance in the narrative that is\
    \ simply unjustifiable. I have no doubt that Giles Milton knows this, and knows\
    \ that it damages his book, but bows to what is required by theBritish publishing\
    \ industry\u2014a contemptible, money-grubbing, market-driven playground for the\
    \ alumni of Oxford and Cambridge universities, rife with nepotism. Even the witless\
    \ goons who run it must surely learn when enough is enough?\nThis is one reason,\
    \ of course, why Hooting Yard appears on the web. Renamed Sir Matt Busby's Cistern\
    \ or Spinoza's Rhubarb, it would probably attract a five-figure advance \u2026\
    \ but only if the content were tailored to meet the requirements of the intellectually\
    \ bankrupt poltroons who sign the cheques. I prefer to plough my lonely furrow.\
    \ End of rant."
