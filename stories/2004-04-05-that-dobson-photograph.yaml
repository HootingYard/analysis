  text: 'On Thursday 1st April we published an anonymously-sent photograph of a man
    and a child, one of whom was purportedly Dobson. I suggested this was probably
    an April Fool''s Day prank. Now, reader Peter C Ross writes:

    Sir : Having known Dobson for more years than I care to mention I am certain that
    the photograph you have received is of Dobson as a child and that the figure behind
    is his father (also known as Dobson). The identification is further confirmed
    by the corner of a Crittal window visible in the background. It is a well known
    fact that Dobson spent his formative years behind such a window.

    This is clearly nonsense. In his breathtaking--if indigestible--List Of Every
    Single Person Dobson Met In His Life, Jasper Poxhaven never mentions anyone named
    Ross, let alone Peter of that ilk, with or without a C. Our correspondent is either
    the shadowy figure who sent the photograph, or a maniac, or possibly both. There
    is a third possibility, but it is so terrifying in its implications that I will
    have to go and bathe my head in Dr Fleming''s Brain Soothing Infusion & Nerve
    Tonic (for external use only) before addressing it...'
