  text: '"Afraid? ... Well--so was I. Bitterly, terribly afraid. For what we had beheld
    in the dusk of that dragoned, ruined chamber was outside all experience, beyond
    all knowledge or dream of science. Not their shapes--that was nothing. Not even
    that, being metal, they had moved. But that being metal, they had moved consciously,
    thoughtfully, deliberately. They were metal things with--minds! That--that was
    the incredible, the terrifying thing. That--and their power. Thor compressed within
    Hop-o''-my-thumb--and thinking. The lightnings incarnate in metal minacules--and
    thinking. The inert, the immobile, given volition, movement, cognoscence--thinking.
    Metal with a brain!" -- A Merritt, The Metal Monster
