  text: "\u201CAfraid? \u2026 Well\u2014so was I. Bitterly, terribly afraid. For what\
    \ we had beheld in the dusk of that dragoned, ruined chamber was outside all experience,\
    \ beyond all knowledge or dream of science. Not their shapes\u2014that was nothing.\
    \ Not even that, being metal, they had moved. But that being metal, they had moved\
    \ consciously, thoughtfully, deliberately. They were metal things with\u2014minds!\
    \ That\u2014that was the incredible, the terrifying thing. That\u2014and their\
    \ power. Thor compressed within Hop-o'-my-thumb\u2014and thinking. The lightnings\
    \ incarnate in metal minacules\u2014and thinking. The inert, the immobile, given\
    \ volition, movement, cognoscence\u2014thinking. Metal with a brain!\u201D \u2014\
    \ A Merritt, The Metal Monster\n\u201CEeek!\u201D is all I can say \u2026"
