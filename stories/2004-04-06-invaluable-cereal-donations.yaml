  text: "A masked brigand equipped with a brace of pistols and an incredibly sharp\
    \ cutlass popped into the office this morning, bearing a message from Mrs Gubbins.\
    \ Although there is some gruel left in her hideaway, the slops and pap have been\
    \ exhausted, and our fugitive is wondering whether any readers could send her\
    \ some cereals. \u201CShe says,\u201D growled the brigand, as he manicured his\
    \ surprisingly elegant fingernails with the cutlass, \u201CShe wants bran, durra,\
    \ millet, sorghum, emmer, spelt, panic, barley, groats, and a lot more millet\u201D\
    . Gentle reader, see what you can do."
