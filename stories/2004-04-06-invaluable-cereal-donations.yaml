  text: A masked brigand equipped with a brace of pistols and an incredibly sharp
    cutlass popped into the office this morning, bearing a message from Mrs Gubbins.
    Although there is some gruel left in her hideaway, the slops and pap have been
    exhausted, and our fugitive is wondering whether any readers could send her some
    cereals. "She says," growled the brigand, as he manicured his surprisingly elegant
    fingernails with the cutlass, "She wants bran, durra, millet, sorghum, emmer,
    spelt, panic, barley, groats, and a lot more millet". Gentle reader, see what
    you can do.
