  text: "On storm-tossed seas, clinging to the gunwale aboard her barquentine \u2026\
    \ this is where we find Sister Hortense. She reminds us, does she not, of Hopkins'\
    \ tall nun? Back at the convent, perched dangerously on the edge of the Dizzyingly\
    \ High Cliffs of \xDCmblasco, she was the subject of much impromptu doggerel.\
    \ That Sister Hortense / She makes no sense / Mother Superior / Said \u201CGet\
    \ thee hence!\u201D sang the novitiates as they queued in the canteen for their\
    \ jugged hare and creeping jenny. Sister Hortense turned a deaf ear, but she could\
    \ not ignore the blandishments of the grubby old Catholic sea dog who lay sprawled\
    \ in a heap outside the convent gate on that fateful day in April. He had come\
    \ for alms: he left with Sister Hortense. He took her away with him to sea, and\
    \ she followed willingly, and when he fell overboard after an accident with a\
    \ topgallant shroud as the ship approached the Arctic Circle, she gave not one\
    \ whit of a thought to returning to the convent. She prayed; she said her novenas;\
    \ she drank rainwater; and two weeks later she hove into port, who knows what\
    \ port it was, gave the barquentine a lick of paint, stocked up on provisions,\
    \ renamed the boat the SS Our Lady of Lachrymose Convulsions, and sailed away.\
    \ Auks and skuas shrieked, and a guillemot swooped low over the poop deck. God\
    \ was in His heaven; the novitiates had no nun to badger; the barquentine was\
    \ bright; and Sister Hortense grew grey and old and mad and sailed on the high\
    \ and storm-tossed seas \u2026"
