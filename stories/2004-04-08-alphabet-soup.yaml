  text: "Devoted readers of Hooting Yard\u2014are there any other kind?\u2014know\
    \ that we do our utmost to bring you the very, very best in modern, cutting-edge\
    \ soup recipes. As part of the latest tranche, here is a marvellous example, provided\
    \ by Dr Ruth Pastry's sister Maud:\nIngredients: 1 lb each of apricots, breadcrumbs,\
    \ coleslaw, dandelions, edelweiss stalks, flapjacks and goldfish brains; 6 tbsp\
    \ honey; 2 oz isinglass; 1 lb each of jackdaw feathers, ketchup, love-lies-bleeding,\
    \ marmalade, nougat and oxlips; 1 pea; 1 tub quicklime; 4 oz each of raisins*,\
    \ spikenard and toffee; 15 tsp unspeakable goo; 1 family-size catering pack of\
    \ vinegar; 3 whelks; as much xanthium as you can stomach; 12 pkts yeast; 44 zinnias.\n\
    Method: Pound everything beginning with a vowel into a mulch. Smear it on to the\
    \ inside of a big bowl. Put the bowl somewhere safe and below freezing point for\
    \ a week. Cut everything else up into chunks the size of a newborn baby's fist,\
    \ then chargrill. Go and get the bowl and toss the chunks in haphazardly. Place\
    \ the bowl under an outside spigot and fill to the brim with water. Leave to stand\
    \ for as long as you like, depending on how hungry you are. Transfer to a cauldron.\
    \ Bring to the boil and allow to simmer. Pour in some milk. Re-boil, indefatigably.\
    \ Ladle off the scum from the top. Serve with hibiscus clumps and cocoa.\n* NOTE\
    \ : The mention of raisins in Maud Pastry's recipe prompts me to quote this splendid\
    \ passage from Francis Wheen's How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered The World (Fourth Estate):\n\
    If [Islamic fundamentalist suicide-bombers] die in the struggle, so much the better\u2014\
    since they will be welcomed into paradise by seventy-two virgins, ready to satisfy\
    \ every sensual need. (This titillating inducement may not be all it seems. A\
    \ scholarly new Koranic study by Christoph Luxenberg suggests that the legend\
    \ of the virgins is based on a misinterpretation of the word hur, which translates\
    \ from Arabic as \u2018houris\u2019 but in the Syriac language meant \u2018white\
    \ raisins\u2019. Imagine the disappointment of a suicide-bomber who arrives in\
    \ heaven expecting a bevy of gorgeous maidens, \u2018chaste as hidden pearls\u2019\
    , only to be offered a bowl of dried grapes instead.)"
