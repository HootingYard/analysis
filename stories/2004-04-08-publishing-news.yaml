  text: "Following the rant on Monday about the woeful state of the British publishing\
    \ industry, we have had a change of heart, and decided to take the book-behemoths'\
    \ grubby shilling. We noted the shelves heaving with books about \u201Cself-help\u201D\
    , and have knocked out, in two days, an invaluable manual called Men Are From\
    \ Bodger's Spinney, Women Are From Haemoglobin Towers. Taking two representative\
    \ figures\u2014Gordon Sumner, aka\u2014laughably -\u201CSting\u201D, and US National\
    \ Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice\u2014the book argues that when your pigs stray\
    \ from their pen into another farmer's field, they can be lured back with hearty\
    \ madrigal singing, but only when the sun is shining. During rainstorms, it is\
    \ best to resort to a traditional goad. Other rustic \u201Ctales of the barnyard\u201D\
    \ are used to illustrate the theme, and several charming drawings have been photocopied\
    \ from an old copy of Dr Alex Comfort's Joy Of Sex.\nOur next port of call as\
    \ we infiltrate the industry will be a management tome entitled Unleash Your Inner\
    \ Dobson, wherein the out-of-print pamphleteer is hailed as an exemplar for the\
    \ dynamic business git on the make. As I write, one of the Hooting Yard janitorial\
    \ team is busy with a marker pen, adding briefcases, personal organisers, mobile\
    \ phones and similar accessories to the photocopied pictures from Dr Comfort's\
    \ book."
