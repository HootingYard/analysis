  text: 'Following the rant on Monday about the woeful state of the British publishing
    industry, we have had a change of heart, and decided to take the book-behemoths''
    grubby shilling. We noted the shelves heaving with books about "self-help", and
    have knocked out, in two days, an invaluable manual called Men Are From Bodger''s
    Spinney, Women Are From Haemoglobin Towers. Taking two representative figures--Gordon
    Sumner, aka--laughably -"Sting", and US National Security Adviser Condoleezza
    Rice--the book argues that when your pigs stray from their pen into another farmer''s
    field, they can be lured back with hearty madrigal singing, but only when the
    sun is shining. During rainstorms, it is best to resort to a traditional goad.
    Other rustic "tales of the barnyard" are used to illustrate the theme, and several
    charming drawings have been photocopied from an old copy of Dr Alex Comfort''s
    Joy Of Sex.

    Our next port of call as we infiltrate the industry will be a management tome
    entitled Unleash Your Inner Dobson, wherein the out-of-print pamphleteer is hailed
    as an exemplar for the dynamic business git on the make. As I write, one of the
    Hooting Yard janitorial team is busy with a marker pen, adding briefcases, personal
    organisers, mobile phones and similar accessories to the photocopied pictures
    from Dr Comfort''s book.'
