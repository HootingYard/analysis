  text: "\u201CWho can contemplate this superb elevation without a mixture of awe\
    \ and admiration, or fail to recur to the page of sacred writ illustrative of\
    \ Almighty wrath and the just man's recompense? Who can gaze upon the majesty\
    \ of this mount, towering above the \u2018high places\u2019 and the hills, and\
    \ turn without repining to the plains beneath, where puny man has pitched his\
    \ tent and wars upon his fellow, mocking the sublimity of Nature with his paltry\
    \ tyranny? I felt as if I lived in other times, and my eye eagerly but vainly\
    \ sought for some traces of that \u2018ark\u2019 which furnished a refuge and\
    \ a shelter to the creatures of God's mercy when the \u2018waters prevailed, and\
    \ were increased greatly on the earth,\u2019 till \u2018all in whose nostrils\
    \ was the breath of life, and all that was in the dry land, died\u2019!\u201D\
