  text: '"Who can contemplate this superb elevation without a mixture of awe and admiration,
    or fail to recur to the page of sacred writ illustrative of Almighty wrath and
    the just man''s recompense? Who can gaze upon the majesty of this mount, towering
    above the ''high places'' and the hills, and turn without repining to the plains
    beneath, where puny man has pitched his tent and wars upon his fellow, mocking
    the sublimity of Nature with his paltry tyranny? I felt as if I lived in other
    times, and my eye eagerly but vainly sought for some traces of that ''ark'' which
    furnished a refuge and a shelter to the creatures of God''s mercy when the ''waters
    prevailed, and were increased greatly on the earth,'' till ''all in whose nostrils
    was the breath of life, and all that was in the dry land, died''!" -- J H Stocqueler,
    Journal of Fifteen Months'' Pilgrimage Through Untrodden Tracts of Khuzistan and
    Persia'
