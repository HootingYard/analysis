  text: 'Before her arrest, escape, and current status as a fugitive, Mrs Gubbins
    was running a very popular "Emoticon Workshop" on Thursday afternoons. The intention--as
    she noted in her prospectus--was to create a definitive catalogue of emoticons
    to denote as many human (and inhuman) emotions as possible.

    The workshop''s first achievement was to devise emoticons for the four medieval
    humours (see Dobson''s Leech Mishap, 16th March) as shown here:

    "(-/. = melancholic

    ;&![] = choleric

    v|-)( = sanguine

    ::}%; = phlegmatic

    Subsequent sessions proved most profitable. Space precludes us from showing all
    of the emoticons so far created, but the selection below is evidence of the hard
    work of Mrs Gubbins and her team. Let us hope they can resume their endeavours
    soon.

    (*--! = mild peril

    +=;;'' = attack of the vapours

    }~@*! = afflicted with the King''s Evil

    ''-)#` = slated for execution on Tower Hill at dawn

    {}..~ = currently listening to Thick As A Brick by Jethro Tull'
