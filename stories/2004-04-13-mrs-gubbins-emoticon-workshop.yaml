  text: "Before her arrest, escape, and current status as a fugitive, Mrs Gubbins\
    \ was running a very popular \u201CEmoticon Workshop\u201D on Thursday afternoons.\
    \ The intention\u2014as she noted in her prospectus\u2014was to create a definitive\
    \ catalogue of emoticons to denote as many human (and inhuman) emotions as possible.\n\
    The workshop's first achievement was to devise emoticons for the four medieval\
    \ humours (see Dobson's Leech Mishap, 16th March) as shown here:\n\u201C(-/. =\
    \ melancholic\n;&![] = choleric\nv|-)( = sanguine\n::}%; = phlegmatic\nSubsequent\
    \ sessions proved most profitable. Space precludes us from showing all of the\
    \ emoticons so far created, but the selection below is evidence of the hard work\
    \ of Mrs Gubbins and her team. Let us hope they can resume their endeavours soon.\n\
