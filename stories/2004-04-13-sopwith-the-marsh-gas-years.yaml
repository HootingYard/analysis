  text: 'Claude Sopwith is the only one of Dobson''s associates to have his biography
    written by the great pamphleteer. Dobson devoted a full eighteen-month period
    (October 1962 to March 1964) to the task. Such concentration on a single subject
    was unusual for Dobson--a notorious flibbertigibbet--but then Sopwith''s was an
    unusual life. Following his trajectory from an orphanage in Borneo to a futuristic
    "pod" on the outskirts of Bodger''s Spinney, via stints as an insurance salesman,
    bird expert, jewel-encrusted mountebank, and trainer of seals (among innumerable
    other escapades), following him from continent to continent, now in one guise,
    now in another, was a highly ambitious undertaking, and one perhaps unsuitable
    for a temperament such as Dobson''s. The planned Life was never, of course, completed,
    but with Marigold Chew busy at the printing press, Dobson issued several pamphlets
    in the early 1960s, each a fragment of the projected work. The idle reader, stumbling
    upon one of these dog-eared tracts in a seaside junk shop, may not realise that
    Sopwith is even the subject. After all, Dobson''s prose style at this period has
    been described by Poxhaven as "incomprehensible". Nonetheless, readers will I
    am sure be intrigued by this all-too-brief excerpt:

    He had nothing but contempt for vinegar and poppies. "Ach!" he would spit, as
    he became enveloped in clouds of marsh gas. Observing his eerily waxen forearms,
    that [illegible] priest had suggested a remedy of cornflakes and glucose tablets.
    He had lost his bus pass, but he no longer knew the bus routes. What was that
    dream Leonardo da Vinci had about a vulture? Well, he had that dream too, except
    in his case the image that lingered, as he awoke, was of twigs, thousands upon
    thousands of twigs, all sticky with birdlime, piled up in a tottering heap, and
    his docent, juddering, just vanishing behind them, waving a brightly-coloured
    scarf embroidered with uncanny visions of Swedenborgian splendour...'
