  text: "One of the more arresting facts about Dobson is that he spent a five-year\
    \ period living in an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. Such was the hold on\
    \ him of this location that he devoted no less than sixteen pamphlets to it. According\
    \ to the statistician Aloysius Nestingbird, Dobson wrote more words about this\
    \ factory than on any other topic. What was it about the place that exerted such\
    \ a fascination upon Dobson? How significant is it that, during his stay there,\
    \ the factory was still functioning, producing thousands of tins of evaporated\
    \ milk every week, and not, as it is today, an abandoned ruin populated only by\
    \ screeching birds? Was the workforce aware that the pamphleteer had taken up\
    \ residence in an unused room on the mezzanine floor, and that he had attached\
    \ his own design of bolts and latches to the door to prevent his being disturbed?\
    \ Or that the carefully-lettered sign on the door, reading \u201CS Q Perkins,\
    \ Janitorial Padr\xE9\u201D, was a fake of Dobson's devising? Was Dobson responsible\
    \ for the occasional small theft of a few tins of evaporated milk noted in a big\
    \ ledger by the management's security team? Was it really necessary for the security\
    \ team to march about the premises in gangs of four, dressed in uniforms not unlike\
    \ those of a fascist junta, accompanied by howling, slavering dogs, each as tall\
    \ as a ten-year-old? Were the dogs skittish when taken to their kennels at the\
    \ end of a security tour? Did a wet-behind-the-ears junior evaporated milk technical\
    \ consultant take the rap for the missing tins? Was he dismissed and did he have\
    \ his epaulettes thrown into the shredder? What in the name of heaven was Dobson\
    \ doing in that room for five years? Why are the answers to these cogent questions\
    \ entirely absent from Dobson's pamphlets? And, most importantly, what birds screech\
    \ there now?"
