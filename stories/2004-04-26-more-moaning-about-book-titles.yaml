  text: 'I ranted recently about the never-ending slew of books entitled Flapdoodle''s
    Pin-Cushion and variations thereof (see Rant, 5th April). During the unfortunate
    technical trauma that closed down Hooting Yard for a couple of weeks, a friend
    reminded me that I had got myself into a similar tizz some years ago. My bugbear
    then was that the Booker Prize shortlist always seemed to be limited to novels
    with pompous, portentous titles like The Redundancy of Courage--was that by Timothy
    Mo? (I could check, but I really, really can''t be bothered.) Titles, in any case,
    which announced: "This is a serious work. It may be ill-written, tedious, and
    simple-minded, but it addresses big themes. This is literature." My plan at the
    time--never fulfilled, alas, but you know how it is--was to write a thumping great
    tome entitled The Consistency of Porridge. I may still do so.'
