  text: "I ranted recently about the never-ending slew of books entitled Flapdoodle's\
    \ Pin-Cushion and variations thereof (see Rant, 5th April). During the unfortunate\
    \ technical trauma that closed down Hooting Yard for a couple of weeks, a friend\
    \ reminded me that I had got myself into a similar tizz some years ago. My bugbear\
    \ then was that the Booker Prize shortlist always seemed to be limited to novels\
    \ with pompous, portentous titles like The Redundancy of Courage\u2014was that\
    \ by Timothy Mo? (I could check, but I really, really can't be bothered.) Titles,\
    \ in any case, which announced: \u201CThis is a serious work. It may be ill-written,\
    \ tedious, and simple-minded, but it addresses big themes. This is literature.\u201D\
    \ My plan at the time\u2014never fulfilled, alas, but you know how it is\u2014\
    was to write a thumping great tome entitled The Consistency of Porridge. I may\
    \ still do so."
