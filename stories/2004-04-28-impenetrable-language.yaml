  text: 'There may be readers who understand the above quotation. I like it for the
    simple reason that no matter how closely I read it, I know that it would take
    years of study before I could ever eke any meaning from it. There is a fascination
    in impenetrable texts which is quite different from looking at a passage written
    in a foreign language of which one is ignorant: that has its own pleasures, of
    course. Most of the words above are familiar to me; the ones that aren''t I can
    look up in a dictionary; and still I will be unable to wring any sense out of
    it. I used to be a regular reader of the Bridge column in one of the Sunday newspapers.
    I have never played Bridge, nor had any desire to do so, but I loved these short
    texts describing situations, tactics and possibilities of a game whose rules I
    knew not. The words took on an abstract quality for me. That''s all.'
