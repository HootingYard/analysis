  text: '"Let us start our investigation of finite rank perturbations of self-adjoint
    operators with the simplest sort of perturbation--a rank one bounded perturbation.
    Let A be a self-adjoint (perhaps unbounded) operator in the Hilbert space H with
    domain Dom (A) ... To discuss the eigenfunctions we restrict ourselves first to
    the case where all particles are bosons, respectively, fermions." -- S Albeverio
