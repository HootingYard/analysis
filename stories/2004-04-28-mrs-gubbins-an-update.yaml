  text: "Several readers have written in to express concern about Mrs Gubbins, who\
    \ has now been on the run from the police for some weeks. We have just received\
    \ a few tatty pages, smuggled from her hideaway, apparently written by the octogenarian\
    \ fugitive herself: Friday. Soup for breakfast. Duck with broken leg outside hut.\
    \ I brought it inside and fashioned a splint with some hairpins and elastic bands.\
    \ It is called Agamemnon. Saturday. My \u201Cminders\u201D are a terrific bunch.\
    \ They have taken to wearing ribbons in their filthy hair and chewing cheroots.\
    \ This afternoon there was a short gun battle with some police officers. We won.\
    \ Sunday. By happenstance, one of my gang is a priest, so we were able to celebrate\
    \ Mass. For the sacrament, we used what was left of a stolen packet of croissants.\
    \ A tin mug of duckpond water had to do instead of wine. Monday. I have been passing\
    \ the time by reading a stash of old Dobson pamphlets. I was particularly taken\
    \ with Two Hundred And Two Spurious Latin Names For Birds Together With A Meditation\
    \ Upon A Sheet Of Corrugated Cardboard. I read it out to [X], one of the minders,\
    \ and he has started to translate it into Tagalog. Tuesday. Peewits on roof."
