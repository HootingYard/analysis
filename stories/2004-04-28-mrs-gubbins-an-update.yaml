  text: 'Several readers have written in to express concern about Mrs Gubbins, who
    has now been on the run from the police for some weeks. We have just received
    a few tatty pages, smuggled from her hideaway, apparently written by the octogenarian
    fugitive herself: Friday. Soup for breakfast. Duck with broken leg outside hut.
    I brought it inside and fashioned a splint with some hairpins and elastic bands.
    It is called Agamemnon. Saturday. My "minders" are a terrific bunch. They have
    taken to wearing ribbons in their filthy hair and chewing cheroots. This afternoon
    there was a short gun battle with some police officers. We won. Sunday. By happenstance,
    one of my gang is a priest, so we were able to celebrate Mass. For the sacrament,
    we used what was left of a stolen packet of croissants. A tin mug of duckpond
    water had to do instead of wine. Monday. I have been passing the time by reading
    a stash of old Dobson pamphlets. I was particularly taken with Two Hundred And
    Two Spurious Latin Names For Birds Together With A Meditation Upon A Sheet Of
    Corrugated Cardboard. I read it out to [X], one of the minders, and he has started
    to translate it into Tagalog. Tuesday. Peewits on roof.'
