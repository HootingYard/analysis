  text: 'Reader Tim Drage has drawn my attention to the pulp novelist Harry Stephen
    Keeler, and I am smitten. I think you will be too. Go and visit the Harry Stephen
    Keeler Society, try to ignore the rather breathless tone (the site''s author is
    overfond of exclamation marks!!)*, and discover for yourself this writer who has
    already been given a posthumous Big Tin Medal by the Hooting Yard Sainthood Committee.
    Here is what to expect: "In The Man With the Magic Eardrums (1939), a bookie and
    a safecracker run into each other in a house in Minneapolis and spend the night
    talking. Oh yes, there are two phone calls, and another character comes into the
    house and talks for a while. This takes hundreds of pages. The direct action of
    The Portrait of Jirjohn Cobb (1940), which has to be one of the most astoundingly
    unreadable novels ever written, consists of four characters, two of whom sport
    outrageous accents, sitting on an island in the middle of a river, talking and
    listening to a radio, again for hundreds of pages. And these novels were only
    the first volumes of two multi-novel sequences! ... How about these chapter titles
    from The Bottle With the Green Wax Seal (1942): The Chromatic Whimsicalness of
    Avunculi Samuelis; Synthetic Mexican; and The Micro-Axially Condensed Typewriter."

    * NOTE : Richard Polt, author of the site, writes to say: "As for my use of exclamation
    marks, I can only plead corruption!--by Keeler!--himself!!" Having now spent a
    couple of days reading Keeler myself, this makes perfect sense!!!!'
