  text: "Reader Tim Drage has drawn my attention to the pulp novelist Harry Stephen\
    \ Keeler, and I am smitten. I think you will be too. Go and visit the Harry Stephen\
    \ Keeler Society, try to ignore the rather breathless tone (the site's author\
    \ is overfond of exclamation marks!!)*, and discover for yourself this writer\
    \ who has already been given a posthumous Big Tin Medal by the Hooting Yard Sainthood\
    \ Committee. Here is what to expect: \u201CIn The Man With the Magic Eardrums\
    \ (1939), a bookie and a safecracker run into each other in a house in Minneapolis\
    \ and spend the night talking. Oh yes, there are two phone calls, and another\
    \ character comes into the house and talks for a while. This takes hundreds of\
    \ pages. The direct action of The Portrait of Jirjohn Cobb (1940), which has to\
    \ be one of the most astoundingly unreadable novels ever written, consists of\
    \ four characters, two of whom sport outrageous accents, sitting on an island\
    \ in the middle of a river, talking and listening to a radio, again for hundreds\
    \ of pages. And these novels were only the first volumes of two multi-novel sequences!\
    \ \u2026 How about these chapter titles from The Bottle With the Green Wax Seal\
    \ (1942): The Chromatic Whimsicalness of Avunculi Samuelis; Synthetic Mexican;\
    \ and The Micro-Axially Condensed Typewriter.\u201D\n* NOTE : Richard Polt, author\
    \ of the site, writes to say: \u201CAs for my use of exclamation marks, I can\
    \ only plead corruption!--by Keeler!--himself!!\u201D Having now spent a couple\
    \ of days reading Keeler myself, this makes perfect sense!!!!"
