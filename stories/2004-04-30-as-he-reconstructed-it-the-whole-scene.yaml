  text: "\u201CAs he reconstructed it, the whole scene seemed unreal, almost oppressively,\
    \ ludicrously theatrical. The pall of sodden, stygian darkness all around; the\
    \ night sounds of soft-winged, obscene things flapping lazily overhead or brushing\
    \ against the furry trees that held the woolly heat of the tropical day like boiler\
    \ pipes in a factory; the slimy, swishy things that glided and crawled and wiggled\
    \ underfoot; the vibrant growl of a hunting lioness that began in a deep basso\
    \ and peaked to a shrill, high-pitched, ridiculously inadequate treble; a spotted\
    \ hyena's vicious, bluffing bark; the chirp and whistle of innumerable monkeys;\
    \ a warthog breaking through the undergrowth with a clumsy, clownish crash\u2014\
    and somewhere, very far away, the staccato thumping of a signal drum, and more\
    \ faintly yet the answer from the next in line. He had seen many such drums, made\
    \ from fire-hollowed palm trees and covered with tightly stretched skin\u2014\
    often the skin of a human enemy. Yes. He remembered it all.\u201D \u2014 Achmed\
    \ Abdullah, Fear"
