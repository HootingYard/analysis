  text: '"As he reconstructed it, the whole scene seemed unreal, almost oppressively,
    ludicrously theatrical. The pall of sodden, stygian darkness all around; the night
    sounds of soft-winged, obscene things flapping lazily overhead or brushing against
    the furry trees that held the woolly heat of the tropical day like boiler pipes
    in a factory; the slimy, swishy things that glided and crawled and wiggled underfoot;
    the vibrant growl of a hunting lioness that began in a deep basso and peaked to
    a shrill, high-pitched, ridiculously inadequate treble; a spotted hyena''s vicious,
    bluffing bark; the chirp and whistle of innumerable monkeys; a warthog breaking
    through the undergrowth with a clumsy, clownish crash--and somewhere, very far
    away, the staccato thumping of a signal drum, and more faintly yet the answer
    from the next in line. He had seen many such drums, made from fire-hollowed palm
    trees and covered with tightly stretched skin--often the skin of a human enemy.
    Yes. He remembered it all." -- Achmed Abdullah, Fear'
