  text: "We recently mentioned the futuristic pod on the outskirts of Bodger's Spinney\
    \ which was once home to Claude Sopwith (see 13th April). Readers with an interest\
    \ in architecture will be pleased to hear that the pod is being renovated to return\
    \ it to its original lima bean shape. Given that lima beans are a key ingredient\
    \ of the (originally Narragansett) dish succotash, one must applaud the local\
    \ planning decision to reopen the pod as a restaurant when the current work is\
    \ completed. Digby Thew has already been appointed as the head chef of the putative\
    \ eaterie. He is well-known as the culinary maverick whose portrait has appeared\
    \ on thousands upon thousands of bookmarks produced by the Blister Lane Bookmark,\
    \ Bookcase, Bicycle Pump & Other Things Beginning With B Manufacturing Company,\
    \ whose gravel-voiced CEO, T B Culc, has kindly given his permission for the reproduction\
    \ below.\nInterviewed about his new job by the Weekly Shackle, Mr Thew said: \u201C\
    As a tot, I always wanted to work in a pod. In fact my father built one for me\
    \ out of driftwood, but he was a cack-handed man, and it collapsed within hours.\
    \ I was trapped in the ruins for three days while the emergency services struggled\
    \ to free me. Wellwishers passed sausages and dandelion & burdock to me through\
    \ a specially-constructed plastic funnel. There were plans to make a feature film\
    \ about the episode, but alas they came to naught when the producer was arrested\
    \ while scouting locations disguised as a zealot. In an act of baffling derring-do,\
    \ he jumped out of the police car delivering him into custody while it was careering\
    \ along a country lane at unimaginable speed, landed in a hedgerow bright with\
    \ pinks and foxgloves and cuckoopint, bashed his head on a discarded metal farmyard\
    \ implement, and suffered permanent memory loss. He ended up working as a blanket-darner\
    \ in Uttoxeter.\u201D"
