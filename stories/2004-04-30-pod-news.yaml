  text: 'We recently mentioned the futuristic pod on the outskirts of Bodger''s Spinney
    which was once home to Claude Sopwith (see 13th April). Readers with an interest
    in architecture will be pleased to hear that the pod is being renovated to return
    it to its original lima bean shape. Given that lima beans are a key ingredient
    of the (originally Narragansett) dish succotash, one must applaud the local planning
    decision to reopen the pod as a restaurant when the current work is completed.
    Digby Thew has already been appointed as the head chef of the putative eaterie.
    He is well-known as the culinary maverick whose portrait has appeared on thousands
    upon thousands of bookmarks produced by the Blister Lane Bookmark, Bookcase, Bicycle
    Pump & Other Things Beginning With B Manufacturing Company, whose gravel-voiced
    CEO, T B Culc, has kindly given his permission for the reproduction below.

    Interviewed about his new job by the Weekly Shackle, Mr Thew said: "As a tot,
    I always wanted to work in a pod. In fact my father built one for me out of driftwood,
    but he was a cack-handed man, and it collapsed within hours. I was trapped in
    the ruins for three days while the emergency services struggled to free me. Wellwishers
    passed sausages and dandelion & burdock to me through a specially-constructed
    plastic funnel. There were plans to make a feature film about the episode, but
    alas they came to naught when the producer was arrested while scouting locations
    disguised as a zealot. In an act of baffling derring-do, he jumped out of the
    police car delivering him into custody while it was careering along a country
    lane at unimaginable speed, landed in a hedgerow bright with pinks and foxgloves
    and cuckoopint, bashed his head on a discarded metal farmyard implement, and suffered
    permanent memory loss. He ended up working as a blanket-darner in Uttoxeter."'
