  text: Xylomancy is the art of divination using twigs. A list of the various -omancys
    would no doubt be diverting, but you can look it up elsewhere. One tool of divination
    usually absent from the reference books, however, is Clancyomancy, the technique
    of predicting the future using fat paperbacks by Tom Clancy purchased from airport
    bookstalls. Please note that success in this art takes years of training, and
    should not be attempted by the ingenue.
