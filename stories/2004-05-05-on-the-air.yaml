  text: "Today sees the fourth programme in the weekly series Hooting Yard On The\
    \ Air, broadcast on ResonanceFM (see top of page for details). I thought readers\
    \ might enjoy a behind-the-scenes look at how the show is made.\nFour or five\
    \ hours before transmission time, the recording studio is thoroughly disinfected\
    \ by a crack squad of specialist cleaning workers dressed in what look like astronauts'\
    \ outfits. They are armed with a panoply of highly intriguing tools, instruments\
    \ and tweezers, many of which have no apparent purpose. The ResonanceFM HQ is,\
    \ as some readers know, located in a subterranean basement far, far below the\
    \ London streets, and is only accessible via an underground pneumatic-capsule\
    \ railway system last used in the 1880s but which has been preserved, like a fly\
    \ in amber, by a group of enthusiasts all of whom by weird coincidence are named\
    \ Tim, as their fathers were before them.\nWhen disinfection is complete, other\
    \ preparations are made. Antique bakelite canisters are distributed to dozens\
    \ of eager factotums (or should that be factota?). Grease-pans, handled by imperious\
    \ and jewel-dappled kitchen staff, are lowered into magnificent neoclassical oven-like\
    \ pods of questionable\u2014though remarkable\u2014significance. Any stray toads\
    \ are ushered violently from workspaces. A xylophone, abandoned after an earlier\
    \ programme, is yanked off its hinges and hurled zestfully into a yellow xylophone\
    \ waste vat. Urgent telecommunications signals are read and reread quickly, then\
    \ plastered on to oblong cards which are nailed to murals in one of the many lobbies.\
    \ Knots are tied in jumpers. Incredibly huge golden flaps have to be emblazoned\
    \ with diamond patterns. The dank cellar of the building is then aired.\nListeners\
    \ are often surprised to learn that Frank Key does not actually appear on the\
    \ show himself. His place is taken by an actor named Ludovico Boole. Boole's ability\
    \ to mimic the vocal inflections of anyone he chooses is matchless, and he has\
    \ had a long and successful career doing so. Other impersonations he has essayed\
    \ include Sir Isaiah Berlin, Tuesday Weld, both Richard and Karen Carpenter, and\
    \ President Nixon's henchman H R Haldeman, of Watergate fame.\nAn hour before\
    \ Hooting Yard On The Air is broadcast, Boole is collected from the roof of his\
    \ seaside compound by a helicopter disguised as an air ambulance, and flown to\
    \ one of the termini of the pneumatic railway on the outskirts of London. For\
    \ security purposes, a different terminus is chosen each week, the decision being\
    \ made by the chopper pilot during the flight.\nSafely ensconced in the ResonanceFM\
    \ HQ, Boole is handed the week's script together with the meal he insists on as\
    \ part of his contract: four bloaters, a bowl of boiling hot custard, breadcrumb\
    \ flan, and a jug of thoroughly-diluted potato extract. Wiping his mouth on a\
    \ monogrammed napkin, Boole then enters the studio and begins to read\u2026"
