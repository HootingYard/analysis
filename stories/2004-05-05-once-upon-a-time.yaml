  text: "You dressed so fine. You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?\
    \ Well no, you didn't. You should have. Mister Compton at the Tweezer Factory\
    \ told you to, but you ignored him. You did worse than ignore him. You tipped\
    \ his hat off his head and trod on it until it was crushed. And what did you do\
    \ then? You kicked the crushed hat into the gutter, with a sneer on your lips.\
    \ And, oh! how that sneer disfigured your face. It was an ugly sneer, and made\
    \ of you an ugly person, something nobody had recognised until then. You, who\
    \ had won the hearts of a multitude through your good works in the field of bird\
    \ welfare, you who had cradled crows in your arms, who had nursed an injured starling\
    \ through three long days and nights, who had fed droplets of rainwater to a hummingbird,\
    \ who so delicately brushed the feathers of an ostrich which had food poisoning,\
    \ you whose eyes lit up with glee when a flock of little bitterns soared across\
    \ the blue, blue sky, you\u2014the so-called \u201CCassowary Man\u201D\u2026 for\
    \ you to betray the faith so many had in you, to reveal your sinful heart by kicking\
    \ Mister Compton's crushed hat into the gutter, and not just any gutter, but a\
    \ foul, filthy, stinking gutter, greasy with slime\u2026 for you to do that shocked\
    \ us all. Now you languish in a prison cell, accused of feckless acts and nincompoopery,\
    \ and Mister Compton lies buried in a distant windswept graveyard. Oh Cassowary\
    \ Man, Cassowary Man\u2026 we can never forgive you."
