  text: "It grieves me to announce that the Hooting Yard website may have to close.\
    \ If my latest scheme succeeds, I very much doubt that I will have any spare time.\
    \ I know that all my readers will be avid for details of my plan, so here is the\
    \ text of a letter I sent out today:\nDear L'Oreal, I would like to apply to become\
    \ the new \u201CFace of L'Oreal\u201D, as I think we both know that the model\
    \ and actress Andie McDowell has been hanging on to the role for too long. You\
    \ probably think that I am unsuitable, as I am a man who does not actually use\
    \ your products, and my hair is fairly short, at least in comparison to Andie's,\
    \ so I won't be able to do that hair-tossing thing very effectively. I can toss\
    \ my head, though.\nWhere I think I could really make a difference is in my ability\
    \ to speak the part of the script that includes the scientific information. I\
    \ enclose a tape recording of one of my practice-runs, and I think you will be\
    \ impressed at the bit where I say: \u201CNow with reduced pH values and clinically-tested\
    \ Norwegian molecule-balancing agents\u201D. As for the punchline\u2014\u201C\
    Because I'm worth it\u201D \u2014 I think there is an opportunity here to diversify\
    \ and create some new catchphrases which will soon be on the lips of millions\
    \ of people worldwide. As I have indicated, when I toss my head my hair doesn't\
    \ do that sinuous, flowing, Andie thing, so it looks as if I've got some kind\
    \ of nervous tic. Well, let's use that! Imagine that at the end of the advert,\
    \ I toss my head and say \u201CL'Oreal\u2014because I've got ergot poisoning\u201D\
    \ or \u201CL'Oreal\u2014because I've got Tourette's Syndrome\u201D. It's a winner.\n\
    I look forward to receipt of my contract in the post.\nYours, because I'm worth\
    \ it, Frank Key"
