  text: 'I will tell you how it happened, in November 1919, in Holland.

    His besmirchment. His besmirchment was physical rather than moral, but no less
    catastrophic for that. He was walking beside a pond, and an evil-eyed tiny one
    careered towards him on a tricycle. In stepping aside to avoid a collision, he
    lost his footing and fell into the pond, and the pond was stagnant and brackish
    and rife with all that slimy green wispy stuff found in stagnant brackish ponds,
    so when he clambered out on to the path, sopping wet and lugubrious, his clothing
    was besmirched. He was poor, and had but that one suit of clothes, and so he remained
    besmirched.

    His being bonkers. His parents ran a private asylum, and he grew up in its grounds.
    His earliest pals were the madcaps, loons and holy innocents who were incarcerated
    there. Never diagnosed as lunatic himself, he nonetheless exhibited eccentricities
    and harboured strange casts of thought which led the wider world to view him as
    a zany, even forty years after his parents perished in the flames which laid waste
    their asylum.

    His topiary. How I wish I could write: "he was the finest topiarist the Netherlands
    ever produced", but I cannot, for he was not. In truth, his topiary was inept.
    More often than not, those few who came to view his work were unable to identify
    what he had meant to depict. By rifling through newspaper accounts, we know, for
    example, that when he unveiled his gigantic Belgian hedge entitled Judith Slaying
    Holofernes, the citizens of Antwerp thought they were looking at a representation
    of a giant pig. Similarly, the Foliage Portrait of Pope Pius IX was mistaken for
    a fruitbat.

    The hoodoo. This besmirched and bonkers man had the signal misfortune to be placed
    under a hoodoo by forces both malevolent and uncanny. All attempts to extricate
    himself from the hoodoo only made it more malign. The actual details are too sickening
    to recount. But let it be said that, at the last, angels played their pipes and
    bright wings bore his soul to heaven.

    His collapse. It was Thursday. He sat under the shade of a big tree with many
    branches and countless leaves. He was chewing a brazil nut and reading a paperback
    copy of A Dictionary of Glues. A chaffinch sang and the sky was blue. His matted
    hair had been cut the day before, and his boots were freshly repaired. The raucous
    hobbledehoys whose tauntings ruined his morning had gone off to cause mayhem on
    the railway tracks. He had been able to afford a pair of swimming trunks, and
    planned a dip in a nearby canal. He swallowed what was left of the nut, put the
    book in his satchel, stood up, and began to walk towards the Iron Palace. Halfway
    across the shimmering lawn, he collapsed. It was the very end of him.'
