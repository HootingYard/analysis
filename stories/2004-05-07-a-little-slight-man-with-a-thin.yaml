  text: "\u201CA little, slight man, with a thin, clever, mobile, clean-shaven face,\
    \ a sharp inquisitive nose surmounted by a perpetual pair of pince-nez, and a\
    \ rather sarcastic mouth, from which wit and humour as light and airy as the cigarette\
    \ smoke which accompanied each remark continually flowed. He stands on the hearthrug\
    \ of his own special sanctum in his handsome house in Dorset Square, with his\
    \ back to the fire, cigarette in his mouth, his hands now in his pockets, now\
    \ waving in the air, as he vivaciously tells me the story of his busy, energetic\
    \ and wonderfully interesting life.\u201D \u2014 Raymond Blathwayt, George Grossmith\
    \ And The Humour Of Him"
