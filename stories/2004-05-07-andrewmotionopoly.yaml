  text: 'The exciting wordgame Andrewmotionopoly is closely allied to the equally
    thrilling pastime Johnfowlesopoly (see 23rd March and 1st April). As in the latter,
    the idea is to compose a text containing all the adjectives in a prescribed list--in
    this case, those in the above Blathwayt quotation. However, this time, instead
    of devising a bedtime story suitable for tiny tots, the challenge is to compose
    a poem worthy of our titanically talented Poet Laureate. To assist readers wishing
    to contribute verses or doggerel to a forthcoming Andrewmotionopoly Anthology,
    here are those adjectives in alphabetical order: airy, busy, clean-shaven, clever,
    energetic, handsome, inquisitive, interesting, light, little, mobile, perpetual,
    sarcastic, sharp, slight, special, thin. Seventeen adjectives in two sentences
    is quite a feat. Your poem, however, can be as long as you like, so long as you
    include all those adjectives, which must appear once and once only. Extra admiration
    will be showered upon entries which include the (non-compulsory) phrase "waving
    in the air". So set to work, readers!'
