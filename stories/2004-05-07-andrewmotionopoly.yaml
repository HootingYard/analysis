  text: "The exciting wordgame Andrewmotionopoly is closely allied to the equally\
    \ thrilling pastime Johnfowlesopoly (see 23rd March and 1st April). As in the\
    \ latter, the idea is to compose a text containing all the adjectives in a prescribed\
    \ list\u2014in this case, those in the above Blathwayt quotation. However, this\
    \ time, instead of devising a bedtime story suitable for tiny tots, the challenge\
    \ is to compose a poem worthy of our titanically talented Poet Laureate. To assist\
    \ readers wishing to contribute verses or doggerel to a forthcoming Andrewmotionopoly\
    \ Anthology, here are those adjectives in alphabetical order: airy, busy, clean-shaven,\
    \ clever, energetic, handsome, inquisitive, interesting, light, little, mobile,\
    \ perpetual, sarcastic, sharp, slight, special, thin. Seventeen adjectives in\
    \ two sentences is quite a feat. Your poem, however, can be as long as you like,\
    \ so long as you include all those adjectives, which must appear once and once\
    \ only. Extra admiration will be showered upon entries which include the (non-compulsory)\
    \ phrase \u201Cwaving in the air\u201D. So set to work, readers!"
