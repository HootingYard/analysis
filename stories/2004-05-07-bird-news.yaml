  text: 'Many readers, not least the ornithologists among you, will know that birds
    are commonly covered in feathers. A bird''s feathers are replaced periodically
    during its life through molt. For those of you who do not know what a bird is,
    let me tell you: it is a bipedal, warm-blooded, egg-laying vertebrate characterized
    primarily by feathers, forelimbs modified as wings, and hollow bones. Wings, by
    the way, are surfaces used to produce an aerodynamic force normal to the direction
    of motion by travelling in air or another gaseous medium, gas being one of the
    phases of matter. An ideal gas, or perfect gas, is a hypothetical gas which obeys
    gas laws exactly. Below is a picture of a man who devoted his life to obeying
    the Laws of Gas. You will note that he has a feather in his cap. In such ways
    are all things in this world interlinked.
