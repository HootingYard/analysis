  text: "A shrivelled and panting urchin with a corkscrew haircut turned up at Haemoglobin\
    \ Towers this morning with the latest news of Mrs Gubbins, who we last heard from\
    \ on 28th April. Apparently, a second raid on her hideout by the Blister Lane\
    \ Constabulary Dangerous Python Squad was partly successful. Most of the octogenarian\
    \ fugitive's \u201Cminders\u201D perished after being attacked by the snakes and\
    \ their robot-controlled metal counterparts. Astonishingly, Mrs Gubbins herself\
    \ made a daring getaway, using her crutches in an inventive way which the urchin\
    \ was unable to divulge, either through ignorance or inarticulacy. He was able\
    \ to inform us, however, that our pal has taken refuge in the Tent of the Tundists,\
    \ who have vowed to protect her if she embraces Tundism. We have sent a greetings\
    \ card to her. It shows a picture of a decidedly inelegant giraffe standing next\
    \ to some beetles. Mrs Gubbins is fond of beetles."
