  text: Ock was a grim and desperate fellow. His hair was lank and his teeth were
    yellow. He had neither knife nor spoon nor fork. He had been pecked at by an auk.
    There were all sorts of things the matter with him, so he made an appointment
    with Doctor Jim. But Jim had embezzled his fees and fled, so Ock went home and
    boiled his head--yes, he boiled his own head, a rum thing to do. Now there's a
    story on which to chew.
