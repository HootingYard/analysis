  text: "Ock was a grim and desperate fellow. His hair was lank and his teeth were\
    \ yellow. He had neither knife nor spoon nor fork. He had been pecked at by an\
    \ auk. There were all sorts of things the matter with him, so he made an appointment\
    \ with Doctor Jim. But Jim had embezzled his fees and fled, so Ock went home and\
    \ boiled his head\u2014yes, he boiled his own head, a rum thing to do. Now there's\
    \ a story on which to chew."
