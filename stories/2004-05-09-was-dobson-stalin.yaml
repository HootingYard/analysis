  text: "This is the intriguing thesis propounded by Aloysius Nestingbird in his new\
    \ book, entitled Was Dobson Stalin? : Laying Bare The Greatest Secret Of Twentieth\
    \ Century Communist Politics Once And For All, With Eight Diagrams, Six Colour\
    \ Plates, A Big Map & Far Too Many Footnotes (Thedoobiebrothers Books, \xA316.99).\
    \ Here is a short extract, including one of those infernal footnotes\u2014which\
    \ itself has a footnote:\nLet us consider the fact that Stalin's childhood nickname\
    \ was \u201CSoso\u201D. Later he became \u201CKoba\u201D, and of course \u201C\
    Stalin\u201D itself is a nickname, the \u201CMan of Steel\u201D. There are profound\
    \ implications here. Was Dobson, as a child, not known as \u201CDoso\u201D? In\
    \ his twenties, was it not common for such friends as he had to call him \u201C\
    Doba\u201D? Did he not later become known as the \u201CMan of Bandages?\u201D\
    \ *\n*NOTE : Just before this book went to press, the author received decisive\
    \ information. Apparently, not one of these nicknames was ever applied to Dobson.\
    \ Even when he was a babe in swaddling clothes, his parents addressed him as \u201C\
    Dobson\u201D, as did everyone else he ever met throughout his life. There are\
    \ those who will carp and say my theory is thus invalidated. A pox upon them!\
    \ Just take a look at these photographs: one shows a gigantic poster of Stalin\
    \ at the height of his personality cult; the other shows a huge billboard with\
    \ what is incontrovertibly the image of Dobson.*\n\n* For copyright reasons I\
    \ am unable to reproduce the extremely similar Dobson photograph."
