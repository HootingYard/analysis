  text: "A Chewist text using a passage from Bulfinch's Mythology as its source. Infelicities\
    \ of tense, from present to past and back again, can be laid squarely at Bulfinch's\
    \ door. For a definition of Chewism, see 2nd March.\nThe HMS Clairvoyant Pig is\
    \ setting out on a dangerous mission, and its captain is bilious. Meanwhile they\
    \ glide out of the harbour, and the breeze plays among the ropes. The captain\
    \ sits in his cabin, puffing aimlessly into his tuba, for he is not a musical\
    \ man. The seamen draw in their oars, and hoist their sails. The ferocious geese\
    \ that the purser's nephew insisted on bringing with him have been penned in an\
    \ impromptu pen for ferocious geese. When half or less of their course was passed,\
    \ as night drew on, the sea began to whiten with swelling waves, and the east\
    \ wind to blow a gale. The captain blew a prolonged discordant note into his tuba\
    \ as a signal for the ship's master, to whom he left the running of the ship.\
    \ The master gave the word to take in sail, but the storm forbade obedience, for\
    \ such is the roar of the winds and waves his orders are unheard. One of the geese\
    \ has managed to peck its way out of the pen. The men, of their own accord, busy\
    \ themselves to secure the oars, to strengthen the ship, to reef the sail. None\
    \ of them has a clue about the true nature of the mission, which is to plop their\
    \ cargo into holes dug on the beach of the Island of Doctor Flap. While they thus\
    \ do what to each one seems best, the storm increases. In his cabin, the captain\
    \ looks bewildered and sad. The shouting of the men, the rattling of the shrouds,\
    \ and the dashing of the waves, mingle with the roar of the thunder. Both geese\
    \ and men shudder uncontrollably. The swelling sea seems lifted up to the heavens,\
    \ to scatter its foam among the clouds; then sinking away to the bottom assumes\
    \ the colour of the shoal\u2014a Stygian blackness. So it was, on that evil Thursday\
    \ two centuries ago\u2026"
