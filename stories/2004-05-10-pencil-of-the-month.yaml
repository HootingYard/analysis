  text: "Dr Ruth Pastry has written in to bemoan the passing of our popular \u201C\
    Decoy Duck of the Week\u201D feature. I can understand, she writes, That you may\
    \ have become bored of decoy ducks, but surely this is no excuse to deprive your\
    \ readers of the pleasures of a regular pictorial series? I used to look forward\
    \ with eagerness to the weekly duck, print it out on a colour laser printer, and\
    \ paste it into an album that I bought especially. Now I'm left with lots and\
    \ lots of empty pages. Please either reinstitute the decoy duck series, or start\
    \ a new one. How about \u201CPlasticine Cow of the Week?\u201D I am pleased to\
    \ inform Dr Pastry that the Hooting Yard staff member with responsibility for\
    \ plasticine farmyard animals is \u201Con the case\u201D, as it were. Meanwhile,\
    \ here is the first Pencil of the Month.\n"
