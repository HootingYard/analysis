  text: 'Dr Ruth Pastry has written in to bemoan the passing of our popular "Decoy
    Duck of the Week" feature. I can understand, she writes, That you may have become
    bored of decoy ducks, but surely this is no excuse to deprive your readers of
    the pleasures of a regular pictorial series? I used to look forward with eagerness
    to the weekly duck, print it out on a colour laser printer, and paste it into
    an album that I bought especially. Now I''m left with lots and lots of empty pages.
    Please either reinstitute the decoy duck series, or start a new one. How about
    "Plasticine Cow of the Week?" I am pleased to inform Dr Pastry that the Hooting
    Yard staff member with responsibility for plasticine farmyard animals is "on the
    case", as it were. Meanwhile, here is the first Pencil of the Month.
