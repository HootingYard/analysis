    \ people by the mighty power of his untamed language, by the smashing fury of\

    \ waste, for no purpose under heaven but to serve as food for idle fancies as\
    \ to what might have been\u2014such to me is the death of Brann, and my throat\
    \ chokes with sorrow and my soul is sick with vain despair.\u201D \u2014 Milo\
