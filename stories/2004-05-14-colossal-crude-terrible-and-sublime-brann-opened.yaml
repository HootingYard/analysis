  text: '"Colossal, crude, terrible and sublime, Brann opened the ears of the people
    by the mighty power of his untamed language, by the smashing fury of his wrath
    of words... Waste, futile and planless, mere howling, empty, chaotic waste, for
    no purpose under heaven but to serve as food for idle fancies as to what might
    have been--such to me is the death of Brann, and my throat chokes with sorrow
    and my soul is sick with vain despair." -- Milo Hastings, Preface to Brann The
    Iconoclast'
