  text: 'Not just any old croissants, either:


    This picture is taken from the Vintage Images section of a thoroughly recommended
    site called art-e-zine. Go there and browse for, oh, hours at all sorts of interesting
    and intriguing artwork. Here at Hooting Yard we have been inspired by the idea
    of making Matchbox Shrines. Currently in the works are shrines devoted to Blodwyn
    Pig, Ricardo Montalban, Emily Dickinson, Lamont Cranston, Gerard Manley Hopkins,
    Neil Sedaka, Dobson, and, of course, Yoko Ono. Pictures of these frighteningly
    exquisite works will be posted as soon as they''re done. We are also toying with
    a special double-matchbox shrine devoted to Sting and Bono, which will be called
    All Hail The Shattered Dignity Of Messrs Sumner & Hewson. It will be splattered
    with some sort of goo, I expect.'
