  text: 'This is the first instalment of the Hooting Yard Pin Bulletin, an important
    new series published as a service to readers who wish to be kept informed of all
    things pin-related. Here, for example, is a very useful tip from one Judy Amarose:
    When pushing pins into a foam board, try using a metal thimble. That will help
    save your fingers! You know, I think Judy is right. Dobson, of course, wrote about
    pins on a number of occasions, most famously in his pamphlet There''s Hours Of
    Fun To Be Had With A Handful Of Pins, the only one of his works to be published
    under a pseudonym. The first edition of fifty-six copies, run off the press by
    Marigold Chew despite the fact that she had a collapsed lung at the time, purported
    to be by an author named "Blenkinsop". When a second edition--of just four copies--was
    printed a decade later, Dobson reverted, wisely I think, to his real name. Jed
    Git, the wastrel Dobson scholar who perished in the 1958 Munich Air Disaster alongside
    the "Busby Babes", hailed what he called "that pin pamphlet" as among the works
    that would prove to be timeless classics, celebrated a thousand years after their
    author''s demise. He was wrong in this, as in so many things. Incidentally, forty-six
    years after his death, Jed Git''s paramour still places a posy of primroses on
    his tomb on the sixth of February every year. The primroses are invariably withered.'
