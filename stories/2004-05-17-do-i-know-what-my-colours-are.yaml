  text: '"Do I know what my colours are? Do I make my vowels sing? Am I direct, sincere
    and simple? Do I know the proper way to sit in and rise from a chair? Am I lovable?
    Am I original? Am I valiant? Have I made a legal will? Do I know where it is?
    Do I hang up my clothes as soon as I take them off? Do I sew a snap-fastener on
    to each end of a piece of tape about an inch and a half long, and sew these tapes
    in the centre of all shoulder seams? Am I so poised, so on my centre, so innately
    joyous that life cannot sway me this way or that?" -- Hill Edwards, Personality
    Pointers'
