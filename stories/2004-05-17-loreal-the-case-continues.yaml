  text: "Further to my legendary L'Oreal letter (see Career Change, 6th May), I have\
    \ received this:\nFrank, I found this mysterious message scrawled on an irregularly\
    \ shaped, singularly corroded sheet of metal which fell into my garden last night.\
    \ BD*\nDear Mr Key, It has been brought to my attention that you have shown interest\
    \ in the possibility of becoming \u201Cthe New Face\u201D of L'Oreal. Being a\
    \ very busy man\u2014especially now that this so-called \u201CScandal of the Implausable\
    \ Utensils\u201D has surfaced\u2014I have not yet had an opportunity to gaze upon\
    \ your facial assets, if any, with my own eye. Yes my friend, you read that correctly;\
    \ I said \u201Ceye\u201D\u2026 for I possess only one. It was not always so. Please,\
    \ please\u2026spare me any demonstrations of pity or remorse! For it was of my\
    \ own volition some decades ago that the organ, with its once inquisitive gaze,\
    \ was spirited away to a particle physics research station of admittedly debatable\
    \ repute where it is now lodged in a special calcium-lined retort, subjected to\
    \ occasional light bombardments of energetic particles (the nature of which are\
    \ distinctly open to criticism) whenever the thin, stooped, superannuated lab\
    \ assistant can wrench himself away from his perpetual travail; the ultimate worth\
    \ of which is certain to be slight. As interesting as I am sure you would find\
    \ more biographical information about myself: enough! In order to be considered\
    \ for employment as New Face, one must be handsome and clean-shaven; any attempt\
    \ to disguise singular hairiness or structural abnormalities by the application\
    \ of unguents or poultices, no matter how clever of a manner one may imagine them\
    \ to have been applied, shall be cause for immediate dismissal. The last applicant\
    \ who attempted to pull this little stunt I dismissed with a sudden volley of\
    \ sharp, guttural barkings and unearthly bleatings, whilst contorting my typically\
    \ mobile features into a stiff, sarcastic grimace. He, waving his hands in the\
    \ air, muttering some airy-fairy quasi-occult philosophical gibberish, turned\
    \ and left the nitre-encrusted chamber, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN!\n* NOTE : \u201C\
    BD\u201D is Bob Drake. Go and visit him here."
