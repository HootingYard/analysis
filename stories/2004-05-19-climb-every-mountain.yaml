  text: "Ford every stream. Follow every rainbow, with a cutlery canteen, just as\
    \ any good Victorian explorer would do. Those people knew precisely how to equip\
    \ themselves for their often arduous journeys. Here, for example, is some advice\
    \ from H H Johnston's Hints On Outfit of 1889: \u201CI cannot too strongly recommend\
    \ all travellers to supply themselves with quantities of light literature. By\
    \ \u2018light\u2019 I do not mean frivolous in character, but devoid of great\
    \ material weight, so that it can be easily packed and readily transported. There\
    \ are a great many standard works now published in cheap editions in paper covers,\
    \ and these, together with a supply of good novels, sensational tales, old magazines,\
    \ and reviews, should be taken. It is astonishing with what pleasure [the traveller]\
    \ will peruse the veriest rubbish in the wilderness, and really crave for anything\
    \ that may serve to distract his mind at times from the savagery around him.\u201D\
    \ Utilitarian to a fault. Equally diverting is the strangely assorted cargo taken,\
    \ a hundred years before, by Jean-Pierre Blanchard and his pals on the first Channel\
    \ crossing by hot air balloon: a barometer and compass, thirty pounds of ballast,\
    \ flags, anchors, cork jackets, a packet of pamphlets, a bottle of brandy, some\
    \ biscuits and apples, two useless silk-covered aerial oars, an equally useless\
    \ rudder, and a moulinet\u2014a sort of hand-operated revolving fan with no apparent\
    \ purpose. I would dearly love to know what those pamphlets were\u2026 exciting\
    \ works by an 18th century ur-Dobson, most likely."
