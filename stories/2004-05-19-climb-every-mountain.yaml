  text: 'Ford every stream. Follow every rainbow, with a cutlery canteen, just as
    any good Victorian explorer would do. Those people knew precisely how to equip
    themselves for their often arduous journeys. Here, for example, is some advice
    from H H Johnston''s Hints On Outfit of 1889: "I cannot too strongly recommend
    all travellers to supply themselves with quantities of light literature. By ''light''
    I do not mean frivolous in character, but devoid of great material weight, so
    that it can be easily packed and readily transported. There are a great many standard
    works now published in cheap editions in paper covers, and these, together with
    a supply of good novels, sensational tales, old magazines, and reviews, should
    be taken. It is astonishing with what pleasure [the traveller] will peruse the
    veriest rubbish in the wilderness, and really crave for anything that may serve
    to distract his mind at times from the savagery around him." Utilitarian to a
    fault. Equally diverting is the strangely assorted cargo taken, a hundred years
    before, by Jean-Pierre Blanchard and his pals on the first Channel crossing by
    hot air balloon: a barometer and compass, thirty pounds of ballast, flags, anchors,
    cork jackets, a packet of pamphlets, a bottle of brandy, some biscuits and apples,
    two useless silk-covered aerial oars, an equally useless rudder, and a moulinet--a
    sort of hand-operated revolving fan with no apparent purpose. I would dearly love
    to know what those pamphlets were... exciting works by an 18th century ur-Dobson,
    most likely.'
