  text: 'Ho! for cormorants! Ho! for terns! These are the words the janitor learns.
    These are the words put into his gob by his docent, who''s a slob. The docent
    packs his maw with words: corncrakes, shrikes, and other birds. The janitor dusts
    the docent''s head, ridding the beetles and crumbs of bread and scraps of yarn
    and other orts, for grooming''s not in the docent''s thoughts. He only ever thinks
    of birds, teaching over a thousand words for creatures that have beaks and wings.
    He doesn''t know about other things. He doesn''t know the janitor''s name. And
    nor do I. And that''s a shame.'
