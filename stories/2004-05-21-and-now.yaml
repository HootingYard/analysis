  text: "\u201CAnd now,\u201D he went on, \u201Cwe get down to the real Cowper operation.\
    \ Which, since you've looked it up, can be summed up in the simplest statement\
    \ that it consists of the providing of a permanent channel through which a patient,\
    \ with a pus-infected antrum, can wash that antrum out daily with antiseptic solution.\
    \ For we use now the Cowper bone-threading burr which makes the standard channel\
    \ of 3/16ths inch in diameter\u2014just the size to hold that gold tube on my\
    \ desk.\u201D He pointed to the bit held in the round handle. \u201CBelieve it\
    \ or not, Brister, I bought this bone-threading burr\u2014which could have cost\
    \ a full $30 to $50 in a surgical supply house\u2014for 50 cents, at an auction\
    \ of my old professor's effects in medical school. Just about the time I graduated.\
    \ He made all his own instruments\u2014had been a machinist in Scotland before\
    \ he became a doctor. 50 cents\u2014no more! A perfect Cowper alveolar threader.\u201C\
