  text: He was beleaguered and curt, and had been ever since he was appointed to survey
    every single concrete post in the town of Obergruwwel. Witold Lutoslawski, the
    Polish composer who had worked with Panufnik as a cafe pianist, was on record
    as saying "Those concrete posts needed a surveyor, but why this hatless, lantern-jawed
    man of disrepute was chosen is nothing less than a civic disgrace". Uncharitable,
    perhaps, for the surveyor had himself once been a cafe pianist, in The Dismal
    Bat, that haven for baffled people with persistent coughs. Ah, but that had been
    so long ago. Most of the customers were now in their graves; the cafe itself had
    been bulldozed to make way for a space-age bird sanctuary; and the pianist, poor
    curt Kurt, roamed the streets with pad and pencil, jotting down notes about the
    concrete posts. There were more than seven hundred such posts in Obergruwwel,
    and no one had thought to survey them until the Town Balaclava Guild sat in special
    session in the converted gym on that grim, teeming, winter Thursday, behind locked
    doors, its members clad in coats of many hues, just like Joseph, the papa of Jesus
    Christ. Later, when the bright moon shimmered among stars, the Guild Vizier made
    a proclamation from the Town Hall balcony. "We seek someone to survey the concrete
    posts," he said, "Someone beleaguered and curt and hatless and lantern-jawed and
    disreputable." Thus did Kurt meet his destiny in this world.
