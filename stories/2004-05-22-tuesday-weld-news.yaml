    This seems so eerily Frank Key-ish I''m wondering if you are involved:

    Bathtime in Clerkenwell : Go find a friend with a Windows PC to watch this: an
    animated video for ''The Real Tuesday Weld''s Bathtime in Clerkenwell'' in which
    an army of cuckoos attempt to wake and bathe a reluctant human. [ Windows Media
    ] http://www.tuesdayweld.com/video/bathtime.html

    Sadly, I have to report that I am innocent of any involvement in this project.
    In fact, I have not yet, at time of writing, even viewed the link. But readers
