  text: "\u201CA taste for flowers is, at all events, infinitely preferable to a taste\
    \ for the excitements of the pot-house or the tavern or the turf or the gaming\
    \ table, or even the festal board, especially for people of feeble health\u2014\
    and above all, for the poor\u2014who should endeavor to satisfy themselves with\
    \ inexpensive pleasures.\u201D \u2014 David Lester Richardson, Flowers And Flower-Gardens"
