  text: '"A taste for flowers is, at all events, infinitely preferable to a taste
    for the excitements of the pot-house or the tavern or the turf or the gaming table,
    or even the festal board, especially for people of feeble health--and above all,
    for the poor--who should endeavor to satisfy themselves with inexpensive pleasures."
