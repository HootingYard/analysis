  text: All that's left is a band of gold-lame-suited troubadours. They arrived shortly
    after you flounced off, with your gaudy reticule in one hand and a map of Tantarabim
    in the other. As Bob Dylan once sang, you left me standing in the doorway crying.
    But not for long. Soon the band arrived, quite unannounced, and made themselves
    at home. I fed them with what was left in the fridge--basil, glucose tablets and
    chopped-up suet--and went up to the attic to consult Dobson's little-known Tip
    Top Encyclopaedia Of Tip Top Pop Bands (out of print). Downstairs I could hear
    the band tuning up for what turned out to be a "jam" session, as the young people
    say. And what did I learn from Dobson? I discovered that my uninvited--but not
    unwelcome--guests had begun life as a skiffle combo called The Urbane Blodgett
    Seven. Riding the sixties wave, they tried out various styles until in 1969 they
    emerged, utterly transformed, as the pioneers of glob music. By now they had settled
    on the name of The Hinges And Nozzles, after being told that their other choices--among
    them Foghat, The Carpenters, Petula Clark, and Blodwyn Pig--had already been nabbed
    by other acts. The 1970s were kind to them, and they had a string of hit albums,
    including Baleful Porpoise, Jesuit Gewgaw Handler, and Irk The Shibboleth. The
    release of Brain Salad Surgery was postponed indefinitely after a rival album
    was released by a so-called "prog rock" group whose name Dobson could not recall,
    despite all the research materials listed in what Nestingbird has dubbed his "most
    exhaustive appendix". Curiously, the latter phrase was the used as the title of
    a The Hinges And Nozzles compilation CD which was released only days before they
    showed up in my house. They are still here, by the way, and have told me in no
    uncertain terms--as they saying goes--that they will not leave until you come
    back to me, oh my darling, oh baby baby, please won't you come on home?
