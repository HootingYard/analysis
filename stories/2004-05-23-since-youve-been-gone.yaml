  text: "All that's left is a band of gold-lam\xE9-suited troubadours. They arrived\
    \ shortly after you flounced off, with your gaudy reticule in one hand and a map\
    \ of Tantarabim in the other. As Bob Dylan once sang, you left me standing in\
    \ the doorway crying. But not for long. Soon the band arrived, quite unannounced,\
    \ and made themselves at home. I fed them with what was left in the fridge\u2014\
    basil, glucose tablets and chopped-up suet\u2014and went up to the attic to consult\
    \ Dobson's little-known Tip Top Encyclopaedia Of Tip Top Pop Bands (out of print).\
    \ Downstairs I could hear the band tuning up for what turned out to be a \u201C\
    jam\u201D session, as the young people say. And what did I learn from Dobson?\
    \ I discovered that my uninvited\u2014but not unwelcome\u2014guests had begun\
    \ life as a skiffle combo called The Urbane Blodgett Seven. Riding the sixties\
    \ wave, they tried out various styles until in 1969 they emerged, utterly transformed,\
    \ as the pioneers of glob music. By now they had settled on the name of The Hinges\
    \ And Nozzles, after being told that their other choices\u2014among them Foghat,\
    \ The Carpenters, Petula Clark, and Blodwyn Pig\u2014had already been nabbed by\
    \ other acts. The 1970s were kind to them, and they had a string of hit albums,\
    \ including Baleful Porpoise, Jesuit Gewgaw Handler, and Irk The Shibboleth. The\
    \ release of Brain Salad Surgery was postponed indefinitely after a rival album\
    \ was released by a so-called \u201Cprog rock\u201D group whose name Dobson could\
    \ not recall, despite all the research materials listed in what Nestingbird has\
    \ dubbed his \u201Cmost exhaustive appendix\u201D. Curiously, the latter phrase\
    \ was the used as the title of a The Hinges And Nozzles compilation CD which was\
    \ released only days before they showed up in my house. They are still here, by\
    \ the way, and have told me in no uncertain terms\u2014as they saying goes\u2014\
    that they will not leave until you come back to me, oh my darling, oh baby baby,\
    \ please won't you come on home?"
