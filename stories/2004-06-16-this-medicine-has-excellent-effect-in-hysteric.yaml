  text: '"This Medicine has excellent Effect in Hysteric Fits, and in all that Train
    of Symptoms which Hysteric and Hypochondriac Persons are subject to; such as Risings
    in the Throat threatning Suffocation, difficult Breathing, Flutterings and Palpitations
    of the Heart, frequent Fainting, Lowness of Spirits, violent Pains in the Head,
    Languor of the whole Body, Dullness of the Mind and Senses, with constant Anxieties
    and Inquietude, &c. The Dose must be repeated according to the urgency of the
    Symptoms; and the Medicine must be continued some Time after the Complaints disappear,
    to prevent a Relapse. It will be serviceable during the Use of the AETHER, especially
    in Case of Costiveness, to take at proper Intervals a gentle Purge, such as Tinctura
    Sacra, Pill Rufi, Rhubarb, or Glauber''s Salts. Bodily Exercise of all sorts contributes
    greatly to the Cure of these Complaints, especially Riding on Horseback." -- Matthew
    Turner, An Account of the Extraordinary Medicinal Fluid, Called Aether'
