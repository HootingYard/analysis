  text: 'Yesterday we mentioned Dobson''s first published pamphlet, the Description
    of & Reverie upon Forty Four Curlews. An anonymous reader has drawn attention
    to the text below, of unknown provenance. What can it all mean?

    There I was, crumpled and decisive, standing between two trees on the edge of
    the Blister Lane Bypass. The trees were both yews, I think. I was looking for
    curlews. The first one I saw was made of plastic, it was a toy or perhaps a decorative
    figurine. It had been abandoned in the gutter. Then I saw a second curlew, swooping
    across the blue, blue sky. I did not know it then, but within hours there would
    be no blue to be seen, for dark and brooding thunderclouds would waft in from
    the east. A third curlew appeared in my mind''s eye. It was gigantic and ferocious
    and terrifying. I shuddered. I walked away from the yews, in the direction of
    Bodger''s Spinney, pulling my resplendent teal cardigan tight about my torso.
    There was a fourth curlew, an embroidered one, on my necktie. Why in the name
    of heaven was I wearing a necktie? All of a sudden this length of fabric wrapped
    around my neck felt like a hangman''s noose. I took it off, with violent jerks,
    and discarded it in a puddle, where it would remain until discovered later that
    day by a scavenging hobbledehoy from The Bashings, that gloomy cluster of huts
    which sane people shirk. Oh, as the tie dropped into the puddle I saw a fugitive
    reflection in the water of the embroidered curlew, so that made five. It was still
    only ten in the morning.

    By five past ten I had seen another dozen curlews, or it may have been a single
    curlew seen twelve times, I cannot be altogether certain. I was standing on Sawdust
    Bridge at the time, feeling hopeless and disgruntled and cantankerous. The tunic
    I was wearing beneath my cardigan, which I had stolen from an ingrate, was playing
    havoc with my [invented skin disease], and rashes were appearing. My doctor had
    prescribed a daily dose of some sort of bean mashed up into a bowl of milk of
    magnesia, and I had forgotten to take my dose that morning, so keen was I to see
    curlews.

    Later I took a mop and began to clean the floor of one of the corridors in an
    ugly building which shall remain nameless. I was indoors now, so unlikely to see
    any curlews. But lo!, little Maisie--a polka-dot-dressed orphan whose parents
    perished in the Tet Offensive--came rushing up to me clutching her stamp album
    and showed me her latest acquisitions, a set of twenty bird-related thematics
    issued by the Tantarabim Interim Authority. I could not help but note, as I shared
    my brazil nuts with starving Maisie, that eight of the stamps depicted curlews.

    On my way home, as the evening closed in and dark thoughts of skulduggery frolicked
    in my throbbing skull, I saw a dead curlew on the canal towpath. Bird detectives
    had already thrown a cordon around it, so I was unable to take a closer look.

    That night, by candlelight, I took out my ledger and gave names to each of the
    twenty-six curlews I had seen. Alcibiades, Bim, Chumpot, Dromedary, Eidolon, Flaps,
    Gash, Heliogabalus, Inthod... That is how I started my list. Then I recalled that
    I had set out to see forty four curlews. I gnashed my teeth in misery and dejection.
    And I recalled that I had forgotten to wring out the mop.'
