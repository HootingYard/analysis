  text: 'Dear Uncle Dan : My friend says anchovies are fished from the Dead Sea by
    Italians and are an Offence unto God. Should I stop ordering anchovies with my
    pizzas?

    Yours in all simplicity, Glyn Webster


    Dear Glyn : In order to answer your question with precision and clarity, I will
    need to know more about this "friend" of yours. I need to know their name, full
    postal address (including postcode or zip code or whatever system you use in New
    Zealand), telephone number, email address, bird count and the name of their regular
    dentist. I need a list of their hats, chalk, and tatty things, and the date of
    their graduation from the Collegeiate Institute of Brusque Snarling Ecclesiastical
    Phantoms. How many fob pockets have they filled with sand, and where did the sand
    come from? Were they in Chappaquiddick on that fateful night? Why is there a big
    stain on the map of Java pinned up next to the sideboard, and of what wood is
    the sideboard made? How many cows lumber about in their barnyard? Is there something
    monstrous and crude about the average burlap sack? Quite frankly I am appalled
    that you expect me to reply to this anchovy business in the absence of such background
    information, so appalled, indeed, that my hair has become frazzled and my collection
    of postage stamps which once gave me such delight now seems to me a puny, curdled
    thing fit only for that big dustbin over there beyond yon lone, stark, lightning-blasted
    sycamore on the edge of the muddiest field in all Christendom. Get a grip.

    Yours fuming, Uncle Dan'
