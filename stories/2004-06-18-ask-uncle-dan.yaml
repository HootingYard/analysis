  text: "Dear Uncle Dan : My friend says anchovies are fished from the Dead Sea by\
    \ Italians and are an Offence unto God. Should I stop ordering anchovies with\
    \ my pizzas?\nYours in all simplicity, Glyn Webster\n\nDear Glyn : In order to\
    \ answer your question with precision and clarity, I will need to know more about\
    \ this \u201Cfriend\u201D of yours. I need to know their name, full postal address\
    \ (including postcode or zip code or whatever system you use in New Zealand),\
    \ telephone number, email address, bird count and the name of their regular dentist.\
    \ I need a list of their hats, chalk, and tatty things, and the date of their\
    \ graduation from the Collegeiate Institute of Brusque Snarling Ecclesiastical\
    \ Phantoms. How many fob pockets have they filled with sand, and where did the\
    \ sand come from? Were they in Chappaquiddick on that fateful night? Why is there\
    \ a big stain on the map of Java pinned up next to the sideboard, and of what\
    \ wood is the sideboard made? How many cows lumber about in their barnyard? Is\
    \ there something monstrous and crude about the average burlap sack? Quite frankly\
    \ I am appalled that you expect me to reply to this anchovy business in the absence\
    \ of such background information, so appalled, indeed, that my hair has become\
    \ frazzled and my collection of postage stamps which once gave me such delight\
    \ now seems to me a puny, curdled thing fit only for that big dustbin over there\
    \ beyond yon lone, stark, lightning-blasted sycamore on the edge of the muddiest\
    \ field in all Christendom. Get a grip.\nYours fuming, Uncle Dan"
