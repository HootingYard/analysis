  text: 'Summertime is of course the time for arts festivals, and here at Hooting
    Yard, the famous Biennale rivals Venice for what Mrs Gubbins has called "cultural
    clout". Highlights include:

    A one-man show by Tad Wensleydale, in which the great child Method actor will
    essay a number of parts, including Agamemnon, Thomas a Becket, both Jack Hulbert
    and Cicely Courtneidge, Christopher Columbus, Christopher Plummer, Clive Bunker,
    the one-time drummer with Jethro Tull, late lamented astronomer Carl Sagan and
    French author Francoise Sagan (in an excerpt from Beerpint''s classic A Tale Of
    Two Sagans), Yoko Ono, Ayn Rand and a ferocious giant invisible hamster.

    The first showing in two decades of Globb''s triptych The Shroud Of Hengist.

    Enrico Fubby & His Performing Tea-Strainers.

    Morris dancing, balaclava wearing, pond draining, skipping, gamboling, frolicking,
    mucking about, and pointing warily at birds.

    Rufus Hinge reads from his classic A Little Book Of Bus Tickets.

    All of these events, and more, taking place during Rainfall Awareness Week.

    Please note that, as its name indicates, the Hooting Yard Biennale takes place
    every two years, and this is the other year, apparently.'
