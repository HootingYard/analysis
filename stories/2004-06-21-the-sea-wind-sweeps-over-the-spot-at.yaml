  text: "\u201CThe sea-wind sweeps over the spot at times in gusts like the frenzy\
    \ of hopeless grief, and at times in sighs as gentle as those heaved by aged sorrow\
    \ in sight of eternal rest. The voices of the great city come faintly over the\
    \ sand-hills, with subdued murmur like a lullaby to the pale sleepers that are\
    \ here lying low. When the winds are quiet, which is not often, the moan of the\
    \ mighty Pacific can be heard dayor night, as if it voiced in muffled tones the\
    \ unceasing woe of a world under the reign of death.\u201D \u2014 O P Fitzgerald,\
