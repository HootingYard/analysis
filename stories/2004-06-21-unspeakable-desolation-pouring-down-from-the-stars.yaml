  text: 'About ten years ago I wrote a short, unpublished novel entitled Unspeakable
    Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars. (I stole that phrase, incidentally, from
    Playing With Water by James Hamilton-Paterson, which I recommend.) The time has
    come, I think, to place the complete text of this exciting philatelic adventure
    story on to the Hooting Yard site, but rather than doing so in one go, it will
    appear as a weekly serial. Every Monday, for the next thirteen weeks, a chapter
    will be added. To begin reading, click on the postage stamp. But don''t forget
    to come back.
