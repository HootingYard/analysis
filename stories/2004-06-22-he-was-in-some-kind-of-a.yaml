    a carriage, a train? He didn''t know. He only understood that it went swiftly,
    swaying from side to side through a sable pit. Whenever his mind moved at all

    a long immersion deeper in the pit he struggled frantically. He must get out.
    Somehow he must find wings." -- Wadsworth Camp, The Abandoned Room'
