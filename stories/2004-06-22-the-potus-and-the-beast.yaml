  text: "We don't speak ill of the dead here at Hooting Yard\u2014well, none of us\
    \ except that Mrs Gubbins, who tends to spit venom about the living and the dead,\
    \ bless her cotton socks. By the way, we haven't heard any news of that saintly\
    \ old crone since she fell in with a band of Tundists (see 7th May) but we have\
    \ sent an emissary to the Port of Tongs to check that she's at least getting her\
    \ daily dose of Dr Gillespie's Invigorating Powders, now in chewable form. But\
    \ I digress.\nThe point of this item is to record my favourite fact about the\
    \ recently-departed Ronald Wilson Reagan, fortieth President Of The United States.\
    \ Incidentally, I read somewhere that within the government bureaucracy, the office\
    \ is known by the acronym POTUS. This seems a much better word than \u201CPresident\u201D\
    . In Britain we have a \u201CQueen\u201D (in itself a strange word\u2014repeat\
    \ it a few times and it begins to sound like something out of Edward Lear ) so\
    \ perhaps the US ought to have a \u201CPotus\u201D.\nWhere was I? Oh yes. When\
    \ Ron and Nancy retired to California, they moved to a place in Bel Air bought\
    \ for them by friends. The address was 666 St Cloud Road, but they were so appalled\
    \ at sharing a house number with the Number of the Beast that they persuaded the\
    \ civic authorities to change their number to 668\u2014effectively, the Neighbour\
    \ of the Beast. I've always wondered about the knock-on effect of that for the\
    \ people living at the existing 668 and upwards, in a dull-witted and trivial\
    \ kind of way.\nSome of those affable types who like to study the Book of Revelations\
    \ have noted that each of the ex-Potus's three names has six letters, suggesting\
    \ that changing his house number was just a wily deceit to throw investigators\
    \ off the scent. And before ending this item, you will be pleased to hear that\
    \ Dobsonista Ned Cargpan is reportedly working on a magick numerological analysis\
    \ of Hooting Yard. We shall have the results soon."
