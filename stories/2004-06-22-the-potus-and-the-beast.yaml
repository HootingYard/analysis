  text: 'We don''t speak ill of the dead here at Hooting Yard--well, none of us except
    that Mrs Gubbins, who tends to spit venom about the living and the dead, bless
    her cotton socks. By the way, we haven''t heard any news of that saintly old crone
    since she fell in with a band of Tundists (see 7th May) but we have sent an emissary
    to the Port of Tongs to check that she''s at least getting her daily dose of Dr
    Gillespie''s Invigorating Powders, now in chewable form. But I digress.

    The point of this item is to record my favourite fact about the recently-departed
    Ronald Wilson Reagan, fortieth President Of The United States. Incidentally, I
    read somewhere that within the government bureaucracy, the office is known by
    the acronym POTUS. This seems a much better word than "President". In Britain
    we have a "Queen" (in itself a strange word--repeat it a few times and it begins
    to sound like something out of Edward Lear ) so perhaps the US ought to have a
    "Potus".

    Where was I? Oh yes. When Ron and Nancy retired to California, they moved to a
    place in Bel Air bought for them by friends. The address was 666 St Cloud Road,
    but they were so appalled at sharing a house number with the Number of the Beast
    that they persuaded the civic authorities to change their number to 668--effectively,
    the Neighbour of the Beast. I''ve always wondered about the knock-on effect of
    that for the people living at the existing 668 and upwards, in a dull-witted and
    trivial kind of way.

    Some of those affable types who like to study the Book of Revelations have noted
    that each of the ex-Potus''s three names has six letters, suggesting that changing
    his house number was just a wily deceit to throw investigators off the scent.
    And before ending this item, you will be pleased to hear that Dobsonista Ned Cargpan
    is reportedly working on a magick numerological analysis of Hooting Yard. We shall
    have the results soon.'
