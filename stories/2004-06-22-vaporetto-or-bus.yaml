  text: 'A thumping great tome lands on the Reviews Editor''s desk. It is nothing
    less than the Incredibly Detailed Report Of The Commission Of Enquiry Into The
    Provision Of Public Transport Services In And Around Hooting Yard As Requested
    By Civic Functionaries Many, Many Years Ago. It would, one feels, be a kindness
    simply to burn the thing. After all, is anyone ever going to read it, apart from
    your dutiful editor? Did it not occur to its compilers that decades-old research
    cannot simply be written up over the succeeding years, with agonising slowness,
    and retain any validity? One notes that the authors have opted to remain anonymous,
    or semi-anonymous, in that they have given their identities only in the form of
    cryptic crossword clues: thus we have Spigot in lane gets plank with Dutch cheese
    (4,8), General Editor; Dad''s pie on hinge (6,9) and Peewit''s churchgoer frantic
    with collapsed lung, says monster (8, 7), Associate Editors; Tenebrous elk, perhaps?
    (10, 12), Deputy Editor; Sounds like miasma of cloacal gruel hurled sideways (7,
    7), Picture Editor; and not forgetting Large pig on holiday island (6, 9), Intern.
    As the great Terry-Thomas used to say, what an absolute shower!

    This enormous volume is basically a mishmash of risible twaddle. Take this, for
    example: "The gorgeous vaporettos which ply the canals of Hooting Yard are run
    by a forward-thinking company which emblazons all its vessels with a startling
    logo of a budgerigar." It is difficult to conceive of a sentence of similar length
    which contains so many errors. Or this: "The bus route between Blister Lane and
    the Dye Works at Chew Parva has won many awards for its revolutionary approach
    to timetabling, not least the employment of "Little Severin, the Mystic Badger",
    a real badger who predicts the timing of the buses by doing something or other
    with his paws. Little Severin is kept in a hutch at the Bus Depot and has become
    a star of local press and radio. He has also become the official sponsor of the
    Annual Cake Show."

    And just when you thought it couldn''t get any worse, how is this for blithering
    inanity? "The infrastructure of the pneumatic railway system, with its nerve centre
    on Yoko Ono Boulevard, was designed upon the territorial patterns of the funnelweb
    spider, hence the breathtaking beauty of the interchanges, sidings, and station
    tea-rooms."

    Dismissing the text with a groan of disgust, the reader turns to the maps, charts,
    statistical tables and appendices hoping that here, at least, some sense may be
    wrung from this preposterous book. All I can say is that it looks to me as if
    the work was farmed out to a gaggle of the younger inmates in the lunatic wing
    of Pang Hill Orphanage. What we have here--and it takes up over a third of the
    book as a whole--is a hideous collection of daubs, blobs and scribbling. Nor does
    it help that most of the pages appear to have been dusted with egg yolk and breadcrumbs.

    There are those who will say that this undoubtedly imposing publication is a bargain,
    costing just eight panes forty, and that I am merely a cantankerous and grumpy
    reviewer with an axe to grind because my essay The Psychic Significance Of A Flat-Fare
    Structure For All Journeys On The Fiendish Pond Swivel-Engined Gas-Powered Subaqua
    Taxi Service was excised by the publishers at the last minute on the clearly ridiculous
    grounds that it was "pompous and self-interested". Have they no shame?
