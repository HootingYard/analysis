  text: '"Another legend accounts for the robin''s red breast by supposing this bird
    to have tried to pluck a thorn from the crown encircling the brow of the crucified
    Christ, in order to alleviate His sufferings. No doubt it is on account of these
    legends that it is considered a crime, which will be punished with great misfortune,
    to kill a robin. In some places the same prohibition extends to the wren, which
    is popularly believed to be the wife of the robin. In other parts, however, the
    wren is (or at least was) cruelly hunted on certain days. In the Isle of Man the
    wren-hunt took place on Christmas Eve and St Stephen''s Day, and is accounted
    for by a legend concerning an evil fairy who lured many men to destruction, but
    had to assume the form of a wren to escape punishment at the hands of an ingenious
    knight-errant." -- Herbert Stanley Redgrove, Bygone Beliefs'
