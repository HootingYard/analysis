  text: "\u201CAnother legend accounts for the robin's red breast by supposing this\
    \ bird to have tried to pluck a thorn from the crown encircling the brow of the\
    \ crucified Christ, in order to alleviate His sufferings. No doubt it is on account\
    \ of these legends that it is considered a crime, which will be punished with\
    \ great misfortune, to kill a robin. In some places the same prohibition extends\
    \ to the wren, which is popularly believed to be the wife of the robin. In other\
    \ parts, however, the wren is (or at least was) cruelly hunted on certain days.\
    \ In the Isle of Man the wren-hunt took place on Christmas Eve and St Stephen's\
    \ Day, and is accounted for by a legend concerning an evil fairy who lured many\
    \ men to destruction, but had to assume the form of a wren to escape punishment\
    \ at the hands of an ingenious knight-errant.\u201D \u2014 Herbert Stanley Redgrove,\
    \ Bygone Beliefs"
