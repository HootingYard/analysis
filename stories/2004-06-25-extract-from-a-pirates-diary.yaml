  text: 'We had been awake for eleven nights. Cloth had been wound around the jugs,
    and a fresh coat of varnish applied to the trapdoors. The hooks were blue. Their
    blue was the blue of farmyards, oilrigs, malfeasance. I broke the engineer''s
    pencil in half. He was furious. His fists met mine. There was something gruesome
    stuck underneath the lantern. I hurled it over the gunwale, to the cheers of my
    crewmates. Then they turned on me, one by one: Blubb with his yellow tooth; Slubb
    with his bottle of vinegar; Flubb with the rhinoceros mask & hideous trousers.
    I fled. Later that night, the Carpathians in my sight, a small shard of bitumen
    became embedded in the rafters of my cabin. The time had come to throw the ledgers
    into the sea. With irrational joy, I glared up at the stacks of sailcloth, and
    my eyes ran with tears. Would I taste potatoes again?'
