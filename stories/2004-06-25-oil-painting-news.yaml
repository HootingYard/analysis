  text: 'A recent survey of British tastes in art announced that "the nation''s favourite
    painting" was a work called, I think, The Singing Butler by Jack Vettriano. Mr
    Vettriano is a self-taught painter whose often whimsical realism is, of course,
    execrated by conceptualist noodleheads and the Saatchi-financed "Britart" mafia.

    I wondered if a similar survey were to be conducted in Hooting Yard what the result
    might be, so I contacted the polling agency run by a sister of suburban shaman
    Joost Van Dongelbraacke and asked them to find out. The methodology they used
    was perplexing, so much so that it gives me a splitting headache just thinking
    about it. In fact I think I am going to go and lie down in a darkened room, with
    a dampened medicinal bandage wrapped around my forehead. [Pause.] That''s better.
    I am pleased to inform you that this morning''s post included the agency''s definitive
    result of the poll, scribbled on a piece of blotting paper by Clytemnestra Van
    Dongelbraacke herself.

    In third place is Allegory of St Bonaventure & The Poolside Attendants, by Sir
    Gordon Sumner, RA (no relation to that "Stig" person, thankfully). In second place
    is Some Wheat And A Couple Of Hens by Hattie Le Mesurier. But a clear winner as
    the favourite painting of all time here at Hooting Yard is the second official
    portrait of ex-President Richard Milhous Nixon, reproduced below. I think all
    our readers will appreciate the justice of this choice.


    In an addendum to the result, Ms Van Dongelbraacke noted that several thousand
    proxy votes, by which Mrs Gubbins had sought to influence the outcome in her charmingly
    malign way, had been discounted. And not only discounted, but incinerated in a
    big cast iron pot.'
