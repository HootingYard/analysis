  text: 'I -- So was a tempest loosed upon the city, and its very fabric uprooted
    from the mud. Whirling and howling, the city was dispersed upon the firmament,
    coming to rest none knew where. And the mud spawned all manner of noisome pests,
    squirming and wriggling to escape the gigantic puddles which were left in the
    wake of the storm. These were not puddles of water, no, nor of any liquid known
    to the human mind. And then my eyes saw, standing fiery on a wooden plinth ringed
    by scum-pools, the obscene figure of Winckelmann. In his left hand he brandished
    aloft a scrap of burning linoleum. His right hand was made into a fist. As, dribbling,
    I watched, the fist was slowly opened to reveal a.... I cannot say. I do not know.
    For just at the moment my peering, watery eyes would have seen that... that thing,
    I was startled by a toad, which leapt up at my face, and thwacked me on the forehead,
    leaving an imprint which remains there to this day, like a brand.

    II -- The man with the toad-mark flapped his shattered wings. In vain, in vain.
    Perched on the rock, beaten by harsh winds, encrusted with seaweed, sightless,
    he was of a sudden assaulted by a voice, roaring at him across a thousand continents.
    "Man with the Mark of the Toad! Know ye the Song of the Boll Weevils? Aye? Then
    sing, damn ye, sing!" Whence came that monstrous voice? What hideous nursery had
    cosseted its owner, what kitchen fed it? "Man with the Mark of the Toad!" it screamed
    again, pulverizing universes, "Hare ye to me now, leave your drab rock! Shed your
    cracked wings! Sprout fins, smack the boiling sea with your flippers, come to
    me! I hold in my gnarled, gnarled hands many gifts for you! I hold anconeal bowls!
    I hold strangled curlews! I hold pods and gum and pitchblende! Spring forward
    now! Go from your dour perch! I hold magnification instruments, Coddington lenses,
    and towels for you! I hold pigeons'' blood, crayons and isinglass! The crayons
    are of colours no human eye should ever contemplate! The isinglass gleams in a
    charming handmade jar! The jar has your mark upon it, Man with the Mark of the
    Toad! Come..." There were hours upon hours of this wretched gibberish, enough
    to make an ant die. The man with the toad-mark beat his useless wings against
    the wind and turned his head away. His brow was crawling with gnats. The gnats
    had come a long way, from barely imaginable puddles of slop where once a city
    had stood. The City of Gnats.

    III -- Winckelmann strode importantly through the boulevards of the walled city.
    He chucked trinkets and baubles to beggars and cripples, holding a vermilion cravat
    over his nose as he did so. Worms slithered up his dainty anklets, only to be
    torn away by scrofula-ridden flunkies. Imposing but haphazard, Winckelmann relied
    upon his most trusted attendant to lead him in the right direction. These boulevards
    all looked alike to him. He could be going anywhere, were it not for Sigismundo''s
    genius. As a factotum, he was a treasure. Save for his inexplicable habit of pissing
    on coinage, Sigismundo was faultless. In this warren of pestilent streets, he
    knew precisely what to do. Turn right by the trough; ignore the screeching placardists;
    beat the pedlars insensible with their own clubs; smartly avoid the motorbikes.
    Before long, Winckelmann and his retinue stood in the courtyard of the Impossibly
    Huge Building. The stink was repellent, but Winckelmann knew etiquette if he knew
    nothing else. With an effort, he removed the cravat from his nose and, at a signal
    from Sigismundo, pushed an envelope stuffed full of flies into the grubby hand
    of the waiting serjeant-at-arms. A ludicrous ballet of bows and scrapes took place,
    Sigismundo taking photographs the while. After what seemed like hours, Winckelmann
    was ushered into an inner chamber. His attendant was not allowed to accompany
    him. Without his trusted lackey at his side, Winckelmann was a little nervous,
    but his discomfiture did not last long. No more than fifteen seconds passed before
    he was greeted by his hosts--a swarm of gigantic gnats, whose thrashing wings
    knocked Winckelmann mercifully unconscious before they devoured him, every last
    bit of him, grinding him to dust between their powerful biting jaws. It was over
    in a flash. Then, buzzing and twanging, the swarm left the chamber as it had entered,
    through a chute, through a chute, through a chute.'
