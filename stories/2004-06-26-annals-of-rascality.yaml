  text: 'Historians of crime have long been fascinated by the Birdbag family, whose
    exploits were regularly recorded in the penny dreadfuls of their day. Seldom has
    such purple prose been so apt, for their deeds were truly the last word in scampishness
    and mischief. To rekindle the memories of older readers, and to introduce a new
    generation to this dastardly clan, here is a brief guide.


    Corky Birdbag, the fiend who pushed a knock-kneed unfortunate into a lake, and
    stole his bus ticket.


    Polly Birdbag, whose forgery of Selected Poems by Walter Pater fooled a docent
    at the University of Ack.


    Old Ma Birdbag, whose tunnels were so expertly dug that the police thought moles
    were responsible.

    Venkad Birdbag, the so-called "Cardboard Hooter Man", who hooted through a cardboard
    funnel.



    Loopy Birdbag, the woman who sent consignments of boiled sweets to Stalin and
    Barbara Stanwyck at whim.


    Fontella Bass-Birdbag, the queasy maven of sabotage who did dark deeds with a
    whisk and a pin-cushion.


    Park Fang Birdbag, desperate banjo player who often stood next to nondescript
    ponds for no purpose but evil.


    Smedley Birdbag, wanted by the police of four continents for doing something weird
    with a toy pig sty.
