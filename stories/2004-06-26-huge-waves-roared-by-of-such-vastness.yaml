  text: '"Huge waves roared by, of such vastness that Madden could hear their crests
    crashing and thundering high above the level of the bridge. These moving mountains
    shook tons of black water into dim, ghostlike spray, and sent it hissing down
    into cavernous troughs. The weight of the wind-swept spume flashing out of darkness
    through the binnacle light almost took the boy off his feet. It pounded his oilskin,
    stung his face. The enormous iron dock groaned and clanged under the mad bastinado.
    The long arms of the shoring stanchions smote the walls in a kind of terrific
    anvil chorus to the blaring orchestra of the tempest." -- T S Stribling, The Cruise
    Of The Dry Dock'
