  text: "\u201CHuge waves roared by, of such vastness that Madden could hear their\
    \ crests crashing and thundering high above the level of the bridge. These moving\
    \ mountains shook tons of black water into dim, ghostlike spray, and sent it hissing\
    \ down into cavernous troughs. The weight of the wind-swept spume flashing out\
    \ of darkness through the binnacle light almost took the boy off his feet. It\
    \ pounded his oilskin, stung his face. The enormous iron dock groaned and clanged\
    \ under the mad bastinado. The long arms of the shoring stanchions smote the walls\
    \ in a kind of terrific anvil chorus to the blaring orchestra of the tempest.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 T S Stribling, The Cruise Of The Dry Dock"
