  text: "\u201CQ.- What is Cabrey's arrangement? A.- Mr. Cabrey makes his eccentric\
    \ rod terminate in a pin which works into a straight slotted lever, furnished\
    \ with jaws similar to the jaws on the eccentric rods of locomotives. By raising\
    \ the pin of the eccentric rod in this slot, the travel of the valve will be varied,\
    \ and expansive action will be the result. Q.- What other forms of apparatus are\
    \ there for working steam expansively? A.- They are too numerous for description\
    \ here, but a few of them may be enumerated. Fenton seeks to accomplish the desired\
    \ object by introducing a spiral feather on the crank axle\u2026\u201D \u2014\
