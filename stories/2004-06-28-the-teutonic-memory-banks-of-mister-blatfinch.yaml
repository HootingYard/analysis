  text: "I want to bestow a prize on Mister Blatfinch. A cup perhaps, or trophy. Or\
    \ just a cup. He has just published his second book. The first was a word-for-word\
    \ transcription of That Hideous Strength by C S Lewis, differing from the original\
    \ only in that the sentences are jumbled up in no particular order, or not one\
    \ that I can decipher. In his postface, Mister Blatfinch claims to have \u201C\
    wrested from this lamentable Christian apologist's noxious sci fi potboiler a\
    \ new and urgent text, or re-text, or \xFCber-text, or we might go so far as to\
    \ say a proto-Blatfinchesque text, the one he meant to write, had he not been\
    \ C S Lewis\u201D. Make of that what you will, or, as I did, dismiss it as the\
    \ raving of a nincompoop.\nHis second book could not be more different from the\
    \ first. Indeed, I made a point of checking that it was the same Mister Blatfinch,\
    \ by doing a forensic comparison of the author photographs on the dust jackets\
    \ of both volumes. You can carry out the same task yourself:\nand\nAll I can say\
    \ is that if those are two different authors, then Lord love a duck, you can knock\
    \ me down with a feather and call me \u201CFontanelle, Bernard le Bovier de (1657-1757)\u201D\
    , and I'll wager you some pins and a cork or two for all that! The reason I want\
    \ to give Mister Blatfinch some sort of award is because this second book of his\
    \ is a delightful and entertaining memoir, rather than a vapid bit of twaddle.\
    \ Not only that, but it rekindled my own memories of that very special time in\
    \ the early 1970s when it seemed that \u201CKrautrock\u201D could revolutionise\
    \ the way we listened to popular music. Remember Amon Duul? Magma? Popol Vuh?\
    \ So does Mister Blatfinch. Well, he gives each of these groups a mention in his\
    \ index, even if they are curiously absent from the body of the text itself. But\
    \ that can be excused, for the book\u2014My Teutonic Memory-Banks\u2014is essentially\
    \ a narrative of the author's experiences as a sound engineer with the forgotten\
    \ group D\xF6b Suun.\nD\xF6b Suun took their name from the out-of-print pamphleteer\
    \ Dobson, and the lyrics to all their songs are taken from illegal German translations\
    \ of some of his more\u2026 shall we say, \u201Carresting\u201D ornithological\
    \ texts. The moving spirit in D\xF6b Suun was lead singer, spinettist and all-round\
    \ wild man Horst Br\xF6tzenkammernvergleist, who found a cache of pirated Dobson\
    \ pamphlets when sorting through his father's papers after the latter's death.\
    \ (Br\xF6tzenkammernvergleist Senior died during the so-called Weems Terror of\
    \ 1967.)\nIt is to our great good fortune that Mister Blatfinch's memoir ends\
    \ before the group degenerated into the turgid heavy metal monsters they became.\
    \ Commercial success ruined them, of course, and they were never quite the same\
    \ after being invited to support The Captain & Tenille on a tour of Canada, Alaska\
    \ and Papua New Guinea as the 1970s ground to an ignominious end. Join me, then,\
    \ as I beat my breast earnestly, raining a thousand and one \u201Cthank you\u201D\
    s upon Mister Blatfinch's remarkably-attired head for reminding me of the glorious\
    \ days of those ear-splitting yet valiant albums Poisoned Linnets and The Ten\
    \ Thousand Chaffinches Of Dr T.\nIncidentally, tone deaf readers who prefer the\
    \ latter-day D\xF6b Suun may be interested in this article on the Heavy Metal\
    \ \xDCmlaut."
