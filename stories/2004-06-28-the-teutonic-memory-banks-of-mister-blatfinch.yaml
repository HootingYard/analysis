  text: 'I want to bestow a prize on Mister Blatfinch. A cup perhaps, or trophy. Or
    just a cup. He has just published his second book. The first was a word-for-word
    transcription of That Hideous Strength by C S Lewis, differing from the original
    only in that the sentences are jumbled up in no particular order, or not one that
    I can decipher. In his postface, Mister Blatfinch claims to have "wrested from
    this lamentable Christian apologist''s noxious sci fi potboiler a new and urgent
    text, or re-text, or uber-text, or we might go so far as to say a proto-Blatfinchesque
    text, the one he meant to write, had he not been C S Lewis". Make of that what
    you will, or, as I did, dismiss it as the raving of a nincompoop.

    His second book could not be more different from the first. Indeed, I made a point
    of checking that it was the same Mister Blatfinch, by doing a forensic comparison
    of the author photographs on the dust jackets of both volumes. You can carry out
    the same task yourself:

    and

    All I can say is that if those are two different authors, then Lord love a duck,
    you can knock me down with a feather and call me "Fontanelle, Bernard le Bovier
    de (1657-1757)", and I''ll wager you some pins and a cork or two for all that!
    The reason I want to give Mister Blatfinch some sort of award is because this
    second book of his is a delightful and entertaining memoir, rather than a vapid
    bit of twaddle. Not only that, but it rekindled my own memories of that very special
    time in the early 1970s when it seemed that "Krautrock" could revolutionise the
    way we listened to popular music. Remember Amon Duul? Magma? Popol Vuh? So does
    Mister Blatfinch. Well, he gives each of these groups a mention in his index,
    even if they are curiously absent from the body of the text itself. But that can
    be excused, for the book--My Teutonic Memory-Banks--is essentially a narrative
    of the author''s experiences as a sound engineer with the forgotten group Dob
    Suun.

    Dob Suun took their name from the out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson, and the lyrics
    to all their songs are taken from illegal German translations of some of his more...
    shall we say, "arresting" ornithological texts. The moving spirit in Dob Suun
    was lead singer, spinettist and all-round wild man Horst Brotzenkammernvergleist,
    who found a cache of pirated Dobson pamphlets when sorting through his father''s
    papers after the latter''s death. (Brotzenkammernvergleist Senior died during
    the so-called Weems Terror of 1967.)

    It is to our great good fortune that Mister Blatfinch''s memoir ends before the
    group degenerated into the turgid heavy metal monsters they became. Commercial
    success ruined them, of course, and they were never quite the same after being
    invited to support The Captain & Tenille on a tour of Canada, Alaska and Papua
    New Guinea as the 1970s ground to an ignominious end. Join me, then, as I beat
    my breast earnestly, raining a thousand and one "thank you"s upon Mister Blatfinch''s
    remarkably-attired head for reminding me of the glorious days of those ear-splitting
    yet valiant albums Poisoned Linnets and The Ten Thousand Chaffinches Of Dr T.

    Incidentally, tone deaf readers who prefer the latter-day Dob Suun may be interested
    in this article on the Heavy Metal Umlaut.'
