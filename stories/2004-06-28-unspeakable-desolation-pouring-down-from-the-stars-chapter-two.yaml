  text: "CRAPWING IS A SMALL seaside resort, riddled with dunes and jetties, some\
    \ twenty miles north along the coast from my family home. Huts and kiosks on the\
    \ promenade display for sale all sorts of beachy items: hats, nets, rock, ice\
    \ cream, paper flags for sandcastles, twizzle-sticks, lotions and potions and\
    \ what-not. The franchisee, if that's the word I want, of one of these kiosks\
    \ was a man named Fig, who had once been employed by my father as a sort of part-time\
    \ private detective. He was sour and rheumy, but had a first-class brain stuffed\
    \ to the brim with suspicion, misanthropy and pessimism: it saddened me to see\
    \ him reduced to peddling buckets and spades to screeching infants.\nThe morning\
    \ after Patch's tearful whimperings, I telephoned Fig and summoned him to the\
    \ mansion.\n\u201CFig,\u201D I said to Fig later that day, as he slumped on the\
    \ edge of my bed, out of breath and removing his bicycle clips, \u201CDo you remember\
    \ the time when you traipsed the county running to earth my father's bakelite\
    \ pipe-rack engraved with scenes from The Courier's Tragedy, which had been burgled\
    \ from the house by a rascally weekend-guest?\u201D\n\u201CEh?\u201D muttered\
    \ Fig. Did I mention that he was hard of hearing?\n\u201COr,\u201D I continued,\
    \ raising my voice, \u201CWhen you solved the mystery of the poisoned pancake,\
    \ a matter far too delicate to entrust to the local constabulary?\u201D\nIt was\
    \ at least twenty years since my father had last made use of Fig, and I wanted\
    \ to test his memory before venting my plan.\n\u201COf course I remember, you\
    \ young chit!\u201D he yelled, collapsing into a paroxysm of wheezing, \u201C\
    I was acting as a confidential agent for your father before you were born! God\
    \ rot his soul!\u201D, he added, \u201CHe still owes me fourteen panes, eight\
    \ soilings and sixpins!\u201D\n\u201CYou shall have your money, and much more\
    \ besides,\u201D I said cheerily, handing him a fifty pane note. Then I told him\
    \ what I wanted him to do. He gave me a look as if I were a stain on his trouser\
    \ leg.\n\u201CYes yes yes,\u201D I gabbled, \u201CI know it was fifty seven years\
    \ ago, and I know that the police forces of several countries failed to find either\
    \ Underlip or any of the loot, and I know that you are over eighty years old,\
    \ sour and rheumy, and I know that the chances of success are slight, but,\u201D\
    \ I shouted triumphantly, \u201CIf anyone alive can find Mister Patch's album,\
    \ you are that man, Fig!\u201D\nHe swigged at the bottle of cough syrup which\
    \ Brewster had delivered during my little tirade. He scowled at me, and then at\
    \ the fifty pane note. I took another one from under my pillow.\n\u201CThat's\
    \ your first week's wages,\u201D I said: which did the trick, of course.\nSix\
    \ hundred panes later Fig had nothing to show for his labours except a series\
    \ of thrilling adventures which could fill two or three paperbacks of the cloak-and-dagger\
    \ sort. Believe me, I had to listen to Fig telling me every last detail of \u201C\
    the case\u201D, as he called it, during the weekly visits he made to collect his\
    \ money and keep me up to date. I was interested to know how he was getting on,\
    \ of course, but not that interested. I was lucky that my mother was demented,\
    \ or she may have wondered at the amount of her money which I was ostensibly spending\
    \ on my stamp collection.\nThe new year dawned, and I celebrated the first anniversary\
    \ of my homely bedbound convalescence. Mister Patch and I had a little party,\
    \ to which we invited Brewster, who was developing encouraging signs of gruffness\
    \ and insubordination. Halfway through the second bottle of Cut-throat's Whetstone\
    \ Malt, my mother flitted in to the room.\n\u201CHello dear,\u201D she mumbled,\
    \ \u201CThe postman delivered a letter for you last week. I\u2019ve got it here\
    \ somewhere.\u201D She rummaged distractedly in the gigantic portfolio of monument-plan\
    \ drawings which she always carried. Half an hour passed before Brewster snatched\
    \ it from her roughly and extricated a filthy envelope which bore the unmistakeable\
    \ signs of having been chewed by a hound.\n\u201CThank you, mama,\u201D I rapped,\
    \ hoping she would vanish. Instead she took out a tape measure and wound it once\
    \ around Patch's skull. He was too far gone by now to protest: to watch his dereliction\
    \ was more than I could bear. Brewster, who I was beginning to like enormously,\
    \ took immediate charge of the situation. Roaring like a maniac, he whipped the\
    \ tape measure away, hustled my mother from the room, deposited her in some far-flung\
    \ wing of the house, and locked and bolted my bedroom door upon his return, by\
    \ which time I had torn open the envelope and read the terrifying message contained\
    \ therein.\n\u201CRead this, Brewster,\u201D I said, in a very serious voice,\
    \ \u201CAnd tell me what you think.\u201D\n\u201CI can strangle chickens, jemmy\
    \ the soundest lock, imitate birdsong, nail on a horseshoe, and preen my moustachios\
    \ like a freeborn Italian,\u201D replied Brewster, \u201CReading, however, is\
    \ not among my accomplishments.\u201D\n\u201COh,\u201D I said, \u201CForgive me,\
    \ Brewster. Listen, then. The note reads as follows: Fig is bound & gagged in\
    \ a dank cellar. We are toying with the idea of visiting unimaginable tortures\
    \ upon him. Five thousand panes in used banknotes will give us pause. Deliver\
    \ this sum in a sack to the foot of the tallest larch in Bodger's Spinney at four\
    \ o clock in the morning on the tenth of January. Upon receipt, Fig will be found\
    \ at the foot of the mightiest cedar in Bodger's Spinney exactly one hour later.\u201D\
    \n\u201CCrikey!\u201D said Brewster.\n\u201CHm,\u201D I replied.\n\u201CNodwabedoo\
    \ pike poon,\u201D gurgled Mister Patch.\n\u201CWell, Brewster?\u201D I asked.\n\
    \u201CLeave it to me,\u201D he said.\nAnd I did.\nOn the eleventh of January I\
    \ received a further message from the fiends I had come to think of as \u201C\
    Fig's captors\u201D. I should point out that, with a few soilings promised him,\
    \ the postman had been instructed to barge his way past my mother and to deliver\
    \ all the mails directly to me. I had not only soilings ready for him, but a half-share\
    \ in a bottle of Snapper's Delirium.\nThe second message was exactly the same\
    \ as the first, except that after each mention of Fig was added & Brewster, is\
    \ became are, and him was amended to them.\n\u201CWhat do you suggest I do now,\
    \ postie?\u201D I asked the postman.\n\u201CLeave it to me,\u201D he replied.\n\
    Touched as I was by this selfless offer, I was loth to receive a further message,\
    \ with & postie inserted after Fig and Brewster.\n\u201CTell me,\u201D I said,\
    \ after patting the gallant postie on the head and refusing his offer with many\
    \ thanks and a refilled tumbler, \u201CTell me, would you happen to have access\
    \ to a stash of, say, five thousand panes in small denominations, so remarkably\
    \ counterfeited that even the Gubernatorial Board of our National Bank would be\
    \ hard-pressed to tell them from real ones, apply what tests they may?\u201D\n\
    Long. Hard. These are the words to describe how the postman thought about my enquiry.\
    \ While he was so engaged I rang for the latest Patch/Brewster figure, a long-limbed,\
    \ angular, crestfallen fellow with a metal fitment on his skull. His name was\
    \ Scrimgeour, and I asked him to fetch up from the cellars a crate of vintage\
    \ Burmese Knife-thrower's Tipple. As he pranced off, the postman ceased his cogitations.\n\
    \u201CI seem to recall seeing such an item hidden behind a filing cabinet in the\
    \ postmaster's office,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd I think I might be able to pinch\
    \ it if you were to provide me with a dangerous and illegal firearm.\u201D\n\u201C\
    Consider it done,\u201D I replied.\nThree days later, Fig, Brewster, and the postman\
    \ were apprehended boarding a ferry from Crapwing Pier. When searched, they were\
    \ found in possession of a dangerous and illegal firearm, a blood-smeared postmaster's\
    \ uniform, and four thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine panes in forged banknotes.\
    \ Asked to stand bail for them, I had them summoned to my room, whence they were\
    \ accompanied by a formidable giant of a man, heavily tattooed and bristling with\
    \ weapons, who introduced himself as Captain Git of the Customs House.\n\u201C\
    Any of you lot make a wrong move,\u201D he grunted, \u201CI fell you with me axe,\
    \ got it?\u201D\nThey got it: even I was terrified as he ran his fingers lightly\
    \ along the impossibly gleaming blade.\nI had rehearsed my speech carefully. I\
    \ wanted to know two things: why were they attempting to skip the country, and\
    \ why had postie retained all but a pane of the counterfeit cash? At the same\
    \ time, I wished to impress upon them the dreadful sense of betrayal I felt, that\
    \ three men whom I had valued, trusted, and held in the highest esteem had acted\
    \ so despicably, leaving me abandoned in my bed while they frolicked off to foreign\
    \ shores, no doubt to wassail and carouse in dens of vice and sinks of sin. Thus\
    \ I asked my questions in a tone so plaintive, so bereft, that I swear I saw a\
    \ tear drop from Captain Git's gimlet eye.\nThere was no such reaction from the\
    \ dastardly trio: they stared at me aghast. Then they all began to speak at once,\
    \ making themselves quite unintelligible, until, noting my consternation, they\
    \ elected Brewster as their spokesman. He spoke at length, and I will not bore\
    \ you with a verbatim record. I had, it appeared, placed quite the wrong construction\
    \ upon their behaviour. It took him twenty minutes to put me right, but nestling\
    \ in Brewster's babble lurked five salient points: one, their captors were foreign,\
    \ extremely stupid, and easily duped, so that it was child's play to convince\
    \ them that the words \u201Cone pane\u201D writ upon a banknote meant, in our\
    \ language, \u201Cfive thousand panes\u201D; two, seconds before being captured,\
    \ Fig had come upon an important clue in the search for Mister Patch's album,\
    \ and had been on the point of following it up; three, the clue led to a toothpaste\
    \ factory in the Port of Tongs; four, the quickest way to the Port of Tongs was\
    \ via the Crapwing ferry; and five, both Brewster and the postman, brains bedizened\
    \ with the glamour of detective work, had volunteered to join Fig on his mission.\
    \ Oh, and six, how could I be such a numbskull as to doubt their almost painful\
    \ integrity?\nI am happy to tell you that I wept. When I had wept, I shoved enough\
    \ of a bribe into Captain Git's paw to make him forget that a postmaster had been\
    \ maimed or murdered, and shooed him away. Soon afterwards, Fig, Brewster and\
    \ the postman hurtled off to Crapwing Pier to catch the evening ferry to the Port\
    \ of Tongs.\nChapter Three\u2026"
