  text: "Detective Captain Pondbedwas a worried man. He flung himself into an armchair,\
    \ his pipe clenched between his jaws, then called out for Mungo, his factotum.\
    \ Within seconds a tall, impossibly handsome fellow strode confidently into the\
    \ detective's study.\n\u201CFetch me some balsa wood!\u201D rapped Pondbed at\
    \ this Ray Milland de nos jours.\n\u201CAt once, Master,\u201D snivelled Mungo,\
    \ before adding, \u201CYou know you are becoming as irritable as Sir Denis Nayland\
    \ Smith in the Fu Manchu stories by Sax Rohmer, don't you? You ought to take up\
    \ a sport. I have heard it said that the Pang Hill bobsleigh team is looking for\
    \ a new recruit.\u201D\nPondbed almost bit the stem of his pipe in two before\
    \ shouting something unprintable at his servant, who had already glided out of\
    \ the room. It was Thursday morning, and the weather outside was spectacular and\
    \ frightening.\nBy the time Mungo returned, an hour later, with a balsa wood crate\
    \ packed with hundreds of sticks of balsa wood, Detective Captain Pondbed had\
    \ completed a pencil drawing of Mary Jo Kopechne, who died at Chappaquiddick.\
    \ He had begun the drawing some months earlier, but he was nothing if not a perfectionist,\
    \ a trait he had inherited from his mother, who, he recalled with a curious admixture\
    \ of fondness and regret, had been known to arrive at railway stations with more\
    \ than four days to spare before the departure of her train, in order to familiarise\
    \ herself with the shift patterns of the tea-room persons. The angle of the detective's\
    \ hat caused Mungo concern, and he stooped over to straighten it. As he did so,\
    \ Pondbed grabbed the crate.\n\u201CWhat is that hideous screeching noise, Mungo?\u201D\
    \ asked Pondbed, his pallid face screwed into prune-like wrinkles. The factotum\
    \ looked out of the window.\n\u201COh, just one of the local hobbledehoys tormenting\
    \ voles,\u201D he said. At that very moment there was a monstrous flash of lightning,\
    \ and a spacecraft landed outside the town swimming baths, directly across the\
    \ road. The spacecraft was one of those smelly ones. The noise it made as it came\
    \ into land was so loud that Pondbed spilled the sticks of balsa wood all over\
    \ his recently shampooed carpet.\n\u201CConfound these pesky alien interlopers!\u201D\
    \ he rapped. Mungo took the pencil drawing and pinned it to the wall above the\
    \ fireplace. The Invasion of Earth had begun in earnest\u2026\nSource : Captain\
