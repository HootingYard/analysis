  text: 'Detective Captain Pondbedwas a worried man. He flung himself into an armchair,
    his pipe clenched between his jaws, then called out for Mungo, his factotum. Within
    seconds a tall, impossibly handsome fellow strode confidently into the detective''s
    study.

    "Fetch me some balsa wood!" rapped Pondbed at this Ray Milland de nos jours.

    "At once, Master," snivelled Mungo, before adding, "You know you are becoming
    as irritable as Sir Denis Nayland Smith in the Fu Manchu stories by Sax Rohmer,
    don''t you? You ought to take up a sport. I have heard it said that the Pang Hill
    bobsleigh team is looking for a new recruit."

    Pondbed almost bit the stem of his pipe in two before shouting something unprintable
    at his servant, who had already glided out of the room. It was Thursday morning,
    and the weather outside was spectacular and frightening.

    By the time Mungo returned, an hour later, with a balsa wood crate packed with
    hundreds of sticks of balsa wood, Detective Captain Pondbed had completed a pencil
    drawing of Mary Jo Kopechne, who died at Chappaquiddick. He had begun the drawing
    some months earlier, but he was nothing if not a perfectionist, a trait he had
    inherited from his mother, who, he recalled with a curious admixture of fondness
    and regret, had been known to arrive at railway stations with more than four days
    to spare before the departure of her train, in order to familiarise herself with
    the shift patterns of the tea-room persons. The angle of the detective''s hat
    caused Mungo concern, and he stooped over to straighten it. As he did so, Pondbed
    grabbed the crate.

    "What is that hideous screeching noise, Mungo?" asked Pondbed, his pallid face
    screwed into prune-like wrinkles. The factotum looked out of the window.

    "Oh, just one of the local hobbledehoys tormenting voles," he said. At that very
    moment there was a monstrous flash of lightning, and a spacecraft landed outside
    the town swimming baths, directly across the road. The spacecraft was one of those
    smelly ones. The noise it made as it came into land was so loud that Pondbed spilled
    the sticks of balsa wood all over his recently shampooed carpet.

    "Confound these pesky alien interlopers!" he rapped. Mungo took the pencil drawing
    and pinned it to the wall above the fireplace. The Invasion of Earth had begun
    in earnest...
