    \ both in color and appearance. That cloudy, steamy, vapory stuff, now rising\
    \ like a fog over a marsh\u2014that must be due to some chemical peculiarity of\
    \ ink. Sesson's knowledge of chemistry was trifling, but he gravely tried to explain\
    \ to himself why he no longer saw a saucer of ink. As a matter of fact, he hadn't\
    \ the remotest idea what he saw; but what he did see reminded him of the interior\
    \ of a tunnel, just after a train has gone through it.\u201D \u2014 S B H Hurst,\
