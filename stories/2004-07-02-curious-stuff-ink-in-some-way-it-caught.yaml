  text: '"Curious stuff--ink! In some way it caught all the light in the room. Of
    course, the light was dim--Laulee had seen to that--just enough to see the ink
    properly. That, no doubt, was the reason the ink had changed both in color and
    appearance. That cloudy, steamy, vapory stuff, now rising like a fog over a marsh--that
    must be due to some chemical peculiarity of ink. Sesson''s knowledge of chemistry
    was trifling, but he gravely tried to explain to himself why he no longer saw
    a saucer of ink. As a matter of fact, he hadn''t the remotest idea what he saw;
    but what he did see reminded him of the interior of a tunnel, just after a train
    has gone through it." -- S B H Hurst, The People Of The Fourth Dimension'
