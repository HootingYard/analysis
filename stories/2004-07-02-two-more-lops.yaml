  text: "The more you turn your mind to lops, the more lops sally forth. Here, for\
    \ example, is a Holland Lop rabbit.\n\nAnd, lest we forget, that 20th century\
    \ Khmer Rouge nutcase Pol Pot becomes the \u201CTop Lop\u201D when his name is\
    \ spelled backwards, which can't be said about many other people. Well, nobody\
    \ else at all, actually."
