  text: 'Today is, or would be, Franz Kafka''s 121st birthday. Two things worth remembering
    about Mr K. Although one thinks of him as a haunted, pallid, neurasthenic wreck,
    he was in fact an enthusiastic oarsman who enjoyed rowing boats. The other thing
    I find quite arresting is that he was a keen Fletcherist, which made his table
    manners trying, to say the least. Fletcherism was (is) a system of eating which
    involves chewing each bite of food until it becomes a watery mass in your mouth
    before swallowing. This has two effects. First, if you chew a bite of food that
    long, you will be consuming your meal at a slower rate. Secondly, the reduction
    of this food to liquid goo means that it will be less difficult to extract the
    nutrients. I am not sure whether it is true that the recommended number of mastications
    is thirty-two (one for each tooth). Horace Fletcher (1849-1919) was an American
    businessman from Lawrence, Massachusetts who expounded his theories in a number
    of excitingly-titled books, including Fletcherism : What It Is or How I Became
    Young At Sixty, The New Menticulture, The AB-Z Of Our Own Nutrition, and The New
    Glutton Or Epicure. He was known to cycle up to two hundred miles a day. Other
    notable Fletcherists included John D Rockefeller, Upton Sinclair, and Henry James.
    Incidentally, I read somewhere that Henry James in his final years became deluded
    and was convinced that he was Napoleon Bonaparte.

    Fletcherism ought not be confused with Daltonism, which is the technical term
    for colour blindness. John Dalton (1766-1844) was a British chemist and physicist,
    born at Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth in Cumberland. In 1794 he published the
    first scientific paper on the subject, Extraordinary facts relating to the vision
    of colours.
