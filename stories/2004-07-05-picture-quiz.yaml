  text: "Ever mindful of the need to keep our readers entertained in these grim summer\
    \ months, we have devised this exciting new feature. Below is an illustration,\
    \ accompanied by some searching questions. Write your answers on a piece of paper,\
    \ and paste it into your commonplace book using one of the adhesives available\
    \ in all good stationery shops. This will become something to treasure for years\
    \ to come.\n\n1. What is the name of the monarch at whom a bomb is being thrown?\n\
    2. Why has the monarch let drop his baubled sceptre?\n3. Which beast of the field\
    \ was shorn to provide the material for the monarch's ill-fitting gloves?\n4.\
    \ If your answer to question 3 is \u201Cdromedary\u201D, what led you to that\
    \ conclusion?\n5. Do you think Condoleezza Rice is quite scary?\n6. Look carefully\
    \ at the assassin's suit. Does it have panache?\n7. Oh what can ail thee, knight\
    \ at arms / Alone and palely loitering? / The sedge has withered from the lake\
    \ / And no birds sing. (Keats) Why has the sedge withered?"
