  text: 'I--Some Hotels. There are seven hotels. Their names are Crone, Crustacean,
    Flask, Infection, Miasma, Unbearable and Vagabond. Each is built of cheap and
    rusty metal and perched on the edge of a precipice. There are seven precipices,
    over each of which a scientist of note has plunged to a watery death during the
    past two weeks. In chronological order, those who plummeted were a botanist, a
    physicist, a phrenologist, an horologist, a laboratory git, a bacteriologist,
    and an uproariously-moustachioed vivisectionist. Each had been a paying guest
    at one of the hotels, though none of them hurtled over the precipice upon which
    their own hotel teetered. The phrenologist, for example, breakfasted upon porridge
    in the Hotel Miasma, then threw herself from the pocked and crumbling cliff-face
    adjacent to the Crone Hotel. Or was she pushed?

    It is in hope of answering this question that the indefatigable Hungarian detective
    Bulent Hellbag has trudged on to the scene. He is seven feet tall, sports a raffish
    windcheater, and has booked in to all seven hotels within the space of half an
    hour, using a variety of aliases and disguises. At the Infection Hotel, he is
    known to the desk staff as Mr B McGrewge, a Scottish safety engineer of sober
    mien and modest wealth, his only luggage a small orange tote bag. At the Hotel
    Vagabond, he has them convinced that he is Baron Glubb Von Glubb, a fanatical
    winter sports enthusiast, lewd and boisterous, who displays a fine array of bobsleigh
    championship medals upon his turquoise tunic. For these, and for his five other
    identities, Detective Hellbag has all the required documentation: forged passports
    and letters of transit, doctored photographs, beetle diagrams, and other seemingly
    personal paperwork.

    At four p.m., firmly established in all seven hotels, he is to be found pasting
    a piece of blotting paper at head height to the outside wall of the Crustacean
    Hotel laundry room. Such attention to detail is the mark of the great detective,
    and Hellbag is in no doubt as to the sheer magnitude of his ratiocinative genius.
    As ever, he has imposed upon himself a strict timetable for solving this case.
    He is confident that he can wrap it up within forty-eight hours. Indeed, such
    is his arrogance that he has overlooked one startling fact. The major domo at
    the Hotel Unbearable is Hellbag''s brother Rolf, whom he has not seen for ten
    years. The last time they met, in vegetation and in awe, they made a handshake
    last for hours. Then, two days later, Rolf was sentenced to hang for the brutal
    slaying of a Loopy Copse ship''s captain, whose skull he smashed to pieces with
    a stolen windigo.

    II--A Hollyhock. The most luxurious of the hotels is the one beginning with B.
    Its tremendous gardens, festooned with foliage, were until recently tended by
    a retired cake person whose glaucoma and rickets gave him increasing gyp. Following
    a series of incidents involving his shark or his cardigan, he was

    [None of the hotels has a name beginning with B. Discard and resume.]

    The least repugnant of the hotels is the one beginning with F. Its gardens are
    neither tremendous nor foliage-riddled, nor tended by a half-blind, shark-owning
    person of cake. Indeed, it can hardly be said to have a garden at all. The floor
    of the lobby is covered in soil or mud, and ridiculous chaffinches witter from
    the rooftops, but the only foliage to be seen in the Flask Hotel is a huge cement
    hollyhock in the dining room, placed there by a permanent resident, Imber Sedge
    by name, whose often truculent gob ill befits a man of the cloth.

    Cleverly concealed atop the very pinnacle of the cement hollyhock is a sliver
    of pugsley, imbued with monstrous properties. It is at once refulgent and calcareous,
    dismaying and arcane. In years past, those who sought to possess it had had their
    heads boiled. Three weeks ago, the surly Sedge implanted the hollyhock in the
    hotel which he called home, and proceeded to paint it with a thick impasto of
    gaudy colours. He had stolen the paint from a wooden hut next to one of the nearby
    ponds, not realising that in doing so he was burgling the nerve centre of Rolf
    Hellbag''s frantic and unholy criminal schemes. Within days of Sedge''s theft,
    a stench of vinegar hung in the air about his head, and his tongue grew furry.

    III--The Ponds. On Wednesday, Bulent Hellbag toured the nearby ponds. His bakelite
    satchel contained the tools of his trade: an adze, brooches, chalcedony, a dubbin
    tray, experimental poultices, Fontoons, gewgaws of every description, hat paste,
    illegal Spode, a javelin, kaka, lettuce, monkey puzzles and night soil, old gas,
    potato peel, quartz, recent newspaper cuttings, stigmata, a tapeworm, uncanny
    torchlight, vestiges of trouser, wild goo, a xiphoid rug, Yorkshire pudding and
    zibeline. He knew his onions.

    The wind came in from the sea, echoing with the wails of the ghosts of perished
    scientists. Hellbag placed his satchel on a knot of furze, and carefully untied
    the rope with which he had bound the massive cement hollyhock to his body. Easing
    it to the ground, he spat and spat and spat. Then he hurled the hollyhock into
    the deepest of the twenty-six ponds.

    Preening in the drizzle, Hellbag congratulated himself on another case successfully
    concluded. Minutes earlier, a ferocious pack of half-starved brontosauruses had
    been unleashed from his brother Rolf''s laboratory in the cellars of the Hotel
    Unbearable. As the great detective puffed on a cheroot, they lurched over the
    brow of the hill, lumbering towards him, relentless and vast.'
