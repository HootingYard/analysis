  text: "\u201CWhen she had crossed it, earlier in the afternoon, she had been chiefly\
    \ concerned in picking out a fairly dry passage over the rich black mold formed\
    \ by leaf-deposits. She had only marked it down as a sheltered spot in which to\
    \ search for early primroses. But the promise of spring was now only a mockery.\
    \ As she advanced, the place seemed an area of desolation and decay, with wind-falls\
    \ for crops. In this melancholy trough\u2014choked with seasonal litter\u2014\
    sound was reduced to furtive rustles; light was shrunken to a dark miasma, through\
    \ which trees loomed with the semblance of men. Suddenly, murder ceased to be\
    \ a special fiction of the Press. It became real\u2014a menace and a monstrosity.\u201D\
