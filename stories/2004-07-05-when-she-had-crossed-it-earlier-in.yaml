  text: '"When she had crossed it, earlier in the afternoon, she had been chiefly
    concerned in picking out a fairly dry passage over the rich black mold formed
    by leaf-deposits. She had only marked it down as a sheltered spot in which to
    search for early primroses. But the promise of spring was now only a mockery.
    As she advanced, the place seemed an area of desolation and decay, with wind-falls
    for crops. In this melancholy trough--choked with seasonal litter--sound was reduced
    to furtive rustles; light was shrunken to a dark miasma, through which trees loomed
    with the semblance of men. Suddenly, murder ceased to be a special fiction of
    the Press. It became real--a menace and a monstrosity." -- Ethel Lina White, The
    Spiral Staircase (Some Must Watch)'
