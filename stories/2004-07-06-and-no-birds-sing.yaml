  text: 'Or do they? Here at Hooting Yard we have taken on a new member of staff to
    assist us in all matters ornithological. The interview process was exhausting,
    possibly because our recruitment advert, by some mishap, appeared in Bee People
    magazine instead of Jobs For The Bird-Obsessed, our publication of choice. That
    misunderstanding dealt with, we questioned what in the name of heaven had persuaded
    us to hold the selection process in the annexe of a House Of Sortilege & Magick
    hard by the banks of a tempestuous river on the point of bursting its banks, fourteen
    miles from the nearest railway station. We eventually appointed Jim Pond, a man
    with a blue hat and dozens of library tickets, who suggested that his first contribution
    ought to be some birdsongs: the lapwing, the curlew, and quite alarmingly, the
    carrion crow. Jim has now gone off to join the Richard Milhous Nixon Memorial
    Sweatlodge, and it is unclear if he is ever coming back.'
