  text: 'I said to Smotter: "When that wagtail flew past my head, I did not know it
    was a wagtail. I thought it may have been a pipit, for I know very little about
    birds." Spookily, at the very instant the words were out of my mouth, Smotter
    boarded a bus which took him far, far away, so crushing any hopes I had of improving
    my ornithological knowledge that morning. The number of the bus that Smotter caught
    had mystic significance, so I made a note of it on one of my bits of paper. My
    pockets are full of them. Every year, on Savonarola''s birthday, I empty out from
    my coats and jackets all the accumulated scraps, stack them into a pile, randomly
    ordered, and type up my jottings verbatim. I have usually forgotten the context
    and import of most of my notes, so I have about as much idea as the readers of
    my annual Pocketsbook [sic] what it all means. In the early days, I separated
    each piece with an ellipsis, but at some point--possibly around the time of Lynnette
    "Squeaky" Fromme''s assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford, I cannot be
    precise--I just ran one note headlong into another. Hence there are passages such
    as the month of Frumentor possible pills for unknown disorders what is in the
    garden of the parsonage and why oo nooky (anag) printer''s devil Gerard Manley
    Hopkins mesmerised a duck two sausage recipes and so on. Thus do I wring sense
    from a baleful planet.'
