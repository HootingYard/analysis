  text: "THE MANUFACTURE OF TOOTHPASTE, by Gervase Pint, is a book which I would recommend\
    \ to all students of bodily hygiene: lay readers, too, will find a close examination\
    \ of its contents highly rewarding. Pint was a student of the great dentifricist\
    \ Lamouche, and poured the best part of his life into this matchless tome, a copy\
    \ of which I have to hand as I write.\nThe first six hundred and forty nine pages\
    \ of Pint's book are devoted to a disquisition upon two popular toothpaste recipes\u2014\
    camphorated and myrrh. The former is comprised of one pound of prepared chalk,\
    \ and one or two drachms of camphor. The camphor must be finely powdered and,\
    \ after mixing with a little wine, pounded into a big splodge with the chalk.\
    \ The latter is, for amateurs, a simpler recipe: the mingling of two ounces of\
    \ myrrh with a pound of powdered cuttlefish. How prosaic the bare details: yet\
    \ how world-shuddering the poetry of Pint's commentary!\nThe workers at the Port\
    \ of Tongs toothpaste factory were presented with a copy of Pint's book upon their\
    \ recruitment, and were expected to learn it by heart during their first month:\
    \ failure to do so resulted in automatic dismissal, without the right of appeal.\
    \ Draconian such regulations may be, but as a confirmed Pintist I cannot bring\
    \ myself to quarrel with them.\nWhile I have been telling you this, the action\
    \ has moved forward. The ferry has docked at the Port of Tongs, and our three\
    \ detectives, suitably disguised, have holed up in a cave high in the purple hills\
    \ which surround the three landward sides of that perfectly square town. On with\
    \ the tale:\nHis reconnoitering mission accomplished, Fig reported back to his\
    \ colleagues. There was nothing for it, he announced, but to pose as toothpaste\
    \ factory workers, until such time as they should see what they should see.\n\u201C\
    What?\u201D snapped Brewster, brusquely.\n\u201CWhat I mean,\u201D said Fig, \u201C\
    Is that if we are to track down the Patch album, we must wheedle our way onto\
    \ the toothpaste factory premises, and keep our eyes peeled. Remember,\u201D he\
    \ added, \u201CI came upon a clue which led me directly to this toothpaste-a-go-go:\
    \ if we are to know where to go from here, we will need to have our wits about\
    \ us, and keep a sharp look-out for the next clue.\u201D\n\u201CSpare us the dramatics,\
    \ Fig,\u201D said Brewster, \u201CI say we storm the place, brandishing cutlasses.\u201D\
    \nThe poor postie had the casting vote. Sensibly, he telephoned me for guidance.\n\
    \u201CSide with Fig,\u201D I advised, \u201CHe knows so much about these things.\u201D\
    \nAs I replaced the receiver in its cradle, Scrimgeour lolloped in, bearing a\
    \ couple of bottles of 1922 Bestial Freak. I sank back on the pillows.\n\u201C\
    Have you looked in on Mister Patch this morning?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CYes, sir\u201D\
    \ said Scrimgeour, in his smarmy voice. I couldn't bear him. Not only did he call\
    \ me \u201Csir\u201D, but he fawned and scraped, treated my mother with respect\
    \ (!), and never touched a drop. The final item in the charge-sheet against him\
    \ was that he was well in with my odious aunts. I was highly suspicious of him,\
    \ convincing myself for some time that he was a paid agent, employed to spy on\
    \ me and to reveal my malingerment: the thought of being packed off back to school\
    \ was so horrifying that I was actually ill for a few weeks. But no, Scrimgeour\
    \ was merely a forelock-tugging sniveller of the worst sort. Countless were the\
    \ times I sacked him, only for my commands to be overridden by Maisie or Daisy,\
    \ to whom, as he put it, he \u201Cowed obeisance, sir\u201D. Ach! Spit, spit,\
    \ spit.\nI was so used to having a retainer of the Patch or Brewster stamp, a\
    \ man with whom I could happily get drunk while execrating my family, that I am\
    \ afraid I went into something of a decline during this period. I became listless\
    \ and irritable. Even my stamp albums held no allure for me. I languished in my\
    \ bed, groaning quietly to myself, hating everything. Weeks went by in a kind\
    \ of haze. Then, at the height of spring, I received a letter from Fig:\nDear\
    \ Young Scalliwag, it read, You will no doubt be amused that I write these lines\
    \ while clothed in the apparel of a toothpaste-factory worker: to wit, one bib,\
    \ one tunic woven of goat-hair, a pair of surprisingly comfortable yellow cheesecloth\
    \ trousers, alarming socks, great sturdy boots, and a protective facemask not\
    \ unlike a fencing instructor's. Brewster and Binnie \u2014ah, so that was the\
    \ postman's name!\u2014are similarly attired. Now, wipe the smile off your face,\
    \ and I shall apprise you of the latest developments in the case.\nFor the past\
    \ six weeks we have been posing, with some success, as ordinary workers at this\
    \ toothpaste factory. My job is to slam huge iron clackingtons on to a series\
    \ of oblong paste-receptacles carried past on motorised railings, each container\
    \ then being lowered to the hardening chamber, where Brewster is employed to place\
    \ them in groups of twelve on a sprung plinth, the control mechanism of which\
    \ is situated in an adjoining room behind protective glass panels, wherein Binnie\
    \ manually rotates several metallic wheels, the action of which impels the plinth-load\
    \ up through a chute to the whirlbath. What happens after that is unknown to us.\n\
    At snack-times and other rest periods we have been diligent in following up the\
    \ clue which led us here. Binnie in particular is indefatigable. Yesterday, for\
    \ example, he pretended to be sick, and spent the day not, as our masters thought,\
    \ in the gleaming white Parlour for the Ailing, but scurrying like a mad thing\
    \ through the administrative building, disguised as an inspector of utensils.\
    \ Thus he was able to take microfilm photographs of a number of documents which\
    \ may or may not prove pertinent.\nThe thing is, Fig prattles. I shall spare you\
    \ the next seven or eight pages of his twaddle: towards the end, however, there\
    \ was a nugget of interest:\nNow, boy, you will doubtless be wondering why on\
    \ earth we are hanging around in this little hotbed of toothpastery. I will tell\
    \ you. From the earliest days of the case, I have been convinced of one startling\
    \ idea: that Professor Underlip and Walter Mad were\u2014perhaps still are\u2014\
    one and the same man. To date, this is only conjecture, but I sense that, somewhere\
    \ in the bowels of this godforsaken factory, I will find the proof. And when I\
    \ do, I will be one step closer to finding Mister Patch's pre-adhesive stamp collection.\n\
    The letter was signed Yours very sincerely, Stanley Fig. PS: When sending further\
    \ instalments of money, please address to my alias, Vercingetorix Sepulveda, c/o\
    \ Zone 94, The Toothpaste Factory, Hobgoblin Boulevard, The Port of Tongs.\nWearily,\
    \ I shoved another few hundred panes into an envelope and sent Scrimgeour off\
    \ to the postbox. Upon his return, he handed me a telegram.\nProof found. Onward\
    \ to Wint. The chase is on. Fig.\nMy spirits were lifted.\n\u201CScrimgeour,\u201D\
    \ I said, \u201CFetch me a jeroboam of Stomach-Churning Sour Slop!\u201D\n\u201C\
    I do not wish to incommode you sir,\u201D he replied, \u201CBut your aunts have\
    \ forbidden me to supply you with beverages of an alcoholic nature.\u201D\nIf\
    \ I were a fictional character, I may have said \u201CGadzooks!\u201D or something\
    \ of the sort. Instead, I berated Scrimgeour with a litany of abuse unsuitable\
    \ for family reading. There is a sub-plot brewing here, the climax of which will\
    \ find the narrator having his aunts drowned in a handy duckpond. Assume that\
    \ this has already happened, and, if you come upon Maisie or Daisy later in the\
    \ narrative, you can gloat in the foreknowledge of their eventual destruction.\n\
    I had to think fast. I had not stirred from my room for sixteen months, and I\
    \ was blowed if I was going to be forced from my bed to collect my own supplies\
    \ of hooch. Besides, I didn't have a key to the cellars. A stratagem was called\
    \ for, obviously. Rack my brains as I might, I could not think of one. I sucked\
    \ on the bottle of tap-water with which Scrimgeour had taunted me, and fell into\
    \ a swoon.\nChapter Four\u2026"
