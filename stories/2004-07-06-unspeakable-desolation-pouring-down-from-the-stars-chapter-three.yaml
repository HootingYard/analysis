  text: 'THE MANUFACTURE OF TOOTHPASTE, by Gervase Pint, is a book which I would recommend
    to all students of bodily hygiene: lay readers, too, will find a close examination
    of its contents highly rewarding. Pint was a student of the great dentifricist
    Lamouche, and poured the best part of his life into this matchless tome, a copy
    of which I have to hand as I write.

    The first six hundred and forty nine pages of Pint''s book are devoted to a disquisition
    upon two popular toothpaste recipes--camphorated and myrrh. The former is comprised
    of one pound of prepared chalk, and one or two drachms of camphor. The camphor
    must be finely powdered and, after mixing with a little wine, pounded into a big
    splodge with the chalk. The latter is, for amateurs, a simpler recipe: the mingling
    of two ounces of myrrh with a pound of powdered cuttlefish. How prosaic the bare
    details: yet how world-shuddering the poetry of Pint''s commentary!

    The workers at the Port of Tongs toothpaste factory were presented with a copy
    of Pint''s book upon their recruitment, and were expected to learn it by heart
    during their first month: failure to do so resulted in automatic dismissal, without
    the right of appeal. Draconian such regulations may be, but as a confirmed Pintist
    I cannot bring myself to quarrel with them.

    While I have been telling you this, the action has moved forward. The ferry has
    docked at the Port of Tongs, and our three detectives, suitably disguised, have
    holed up in a cave high in the purple hills which surround the three landward
    sides of that perfectly square town. On with the tale:

    His reconnoitering mission accomplished, Fig reported back to his colleagues.
    There was nothing for it, he announced, but to pose as toothpaste factory workers,
    until such time as they should see what they should see.

    "What?" snapped Brewster, brusquely.

    "What I mean," said Fig, "Is that if we are to track down the Patch album, we
    must wheedle our way onto the toothpaste factory premises, and keep our eyes peeled.
    Remember," he added, "I came upon a clue which led me directly to this toothpaste-a-go-go:
    if we are to know where to go from here, we will need to have our wits about us,
    and keep a sharp look-out for the next clue."

    "Spare us the dramatics, Fig," said Brewster, "I say we storm the place, brandishing
    cutlasses."

    The poor postie had the casting vote. Sensibly, he telephoned me for guidance.

    "Side with Fig," I advised, "He knows so much about these things."

    As I replaced the receiver in its cradle, Scrimgeour lolloped in, bearing a couple
    of bottles of 1922 Bestial Freak. I sank back on the pillows.

    "Have you looked in on Mister Patch this morning?" I asked.

    "Yes, sir" said Scrimgeour, in his smarmy voice. I couldn''t bear him. Not only
    did he call me "sir", but he fawned and scraped, treated my mother with respect
    (!), and never touched a drop. The final item in the charge-sheet against him
    was that he was well in with my odious aunts. I was highly suspicious of him,
    convincing myself for some time that he was a paid agent, employed to spy on me
    and to reveal my malingerment: the thought of being packed off back to school
    was so horrifying that I was actually ill for a few weeks. But no, Scrimgeour
    was merely a forelock-tugging sniveller of the worst sort. Countless were the
    times I sacked him, only for my commands to be overridden by Maisie or Daisy,
    to whom, as he put it, he "owed obeisance, sir". Ach! Spit, spit, spit.

    I was so used to having a retainer of the Patch or Brewster stamp, a man with
    whom I could happily get drunk while execrating my family, that I am afraid I
    went into something of a decline during this period. I became listless and irritable.
    Even my stamp albums held no allure for me. I languished in my bed, groaning quietly
    to myself, hating everything. Weeks went by in a kind of haze. Then, at the height
    of spring, I received a letter from Fig:

    Dear Young Scalliwag, it read, You will no doubt be amused that I write these
    lines while clothed in the apparel of a toothpaste-factory worker: to wit, one
    bib, one tunic woven of goat-hair, a pair of surprisingly comfortable yellow cheesecloth
    trousers, alarming socks, great sturdy boots, and a protective facemask not unlike
    a fencing instructor''s. Brewster and Binnie --ah, so that was the postman''s
    name!--are similarly attired. Now, wipe the smile off your face, and I shall apprise
    you of the latest developments in the case.

    For the past six weeks we have been posing, with some success, as ordinary workers
    at this toothpaste factory. My job is to slam huge iron clackingtons on to a series
    of oblong paste-receptacles carried past on motorised railings, each container
    then being lowered to the hardening chamber, where Brewster is employed to place
    them in groups of twelve on a sprung plinth, the control mechanism of which is
    situated in an adjoining room behind protective glass panels, wherein Binnie manually
    rotates several metallic wheels, the action of which impels the plinth-load up
    through a chute to the whirlbath. What happens after that is unknown to us.

    At snack-times and other rest periods we have been diligent in following up the
    clue which led us here. Binnie in particular is indefatigable. Yesterday, for
    example, he pretended to be sick, and spent the day not, as our masters thought,
    in the gleaming white Parlour for the Ailing, but scurrying like a mad thing through
    the administrative building, disguised as an inspector of utensils. Thus he was
    able to take microfilm photographs of a number of documents which may or may not
    prove pertinent.

    The thing is, Fig prattles. I shall spare you the next seven or eight pages of
    his twaddle: towards the end, however, there was a nugget of interest:

    Now, boy, you will doubtless be wondering why on earth we are hanging around in
    this little hotbed of toothpastery. I will tell you. From the earliest days of
    the case, I have been convinced of one startling idea: that Professor Underlip
    and Walter Mad were--perhaps still are--one and the same man. To date, this is
    only conjecture, but I sense that, somewhere in the bowels of this godforsaken
    factory, I will find the proof. And when I do, I will be one step closer to finding
    Mister Patch''s pre-adhesive stamp collection.

    The letter was signed Yours very sincerely, Stanley Fig. PS: When sending further
    instalments of money, please address to my alias, Vercingetorix Sepulveda, c/o
    Zone 94, The Toothpaste Factory, Hobgoblin Boulevard, The Port of Tongs.

    Wearily, I shoved another few hundred panes into an envelope and sent Scrimgeour
    off to the postbox. Upon his return, he handed me a telegram.

    Proof found. Onward to Wint. The chase is on. Fig.

    My spirits were lifted.

    "Scrimgeour," I said, "Fetch me a jeroboam of Stomach-Churning Sour Slop!"

    "I do not wish to incommode you sir," he replied, "But your aunts have forbidden
    me to supply you with beverages of an alcoholic nature."

    If I were a fictional character, I may have said "Gadzooks!" or something of the
    sort. Instead, I berated Scrimgeour with a litany of abuse unsuitable for family
    reading. There is a sub-plot brewing here, the climax of which will find the narrator
    having his aunts drowned in a handy duckpond. Assume that this has already happened,
    and, if you come upon Maisie or Daisy later in the narrative, you can gloat in
    the foreknowledge of their eventual destruction.

    I had to think fast. I had not stirred from my room for sixteen months, and I
    was blowed if I was going to be forced from my bed to collect my own supplies
    of hooch. Besides, I didn''t have a key to the cellars. A stratagem was called
    for, obviously. Rack my brains as I might, I could not think of one. I sucked
    on the bottle of tap-water with which Scrimgeour had taunted me, and fell into
    a swoon.
