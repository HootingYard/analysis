  text: 'Until I read yesterday''s Guardian, I had never heard of Dr John W Trinkaus.
    Now, I am thinking of suing him for being a Dobson-impostor. Could anyone have
    followed Trinkaus'' career path without having digested the complete works of
    the out-of-print pamphleteer? I think not. It turns out that this New York professor
    is almost as prolific as Dobson himself. Here is a list--by no means complete--of
    the subjects to which Trinkaus has turned his attention: bicyclists, Brussels
    sprouts, cases (attache, opening of), chapel attendance (drop-in), cookies said
    to be baked by AIDS patients, empty beverage containers, gloves, lodging discount
    coupons, mentalists, parking areas, physicians'' offices (waiting time in), railway
    terminals, sirens, supermarket checkout delays, tongs and tissues, television
    game show contestants (handicapped), uncooked ground beef, winter storms (weather
    persons'' predictions of), yes (the word). If that does not make him a Dobsonista,
    then tie me to a tree and call me Barry, as Max Decharne has been known to say,
    often on Tuesdays. It turns out that, unlike his precursor, Dr Trinkaus has a
    considerable presence on the web. Go here to find out more about him.'
