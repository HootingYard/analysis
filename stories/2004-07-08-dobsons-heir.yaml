  text: "Until I read yesterday's Guardian, I had never heard of Dr John W Trinkaus.\
    \ Now, I am thinking of suing him for being a Dobson-impostor. Could anyone have\
    \ followed Trinkaus' career path without having digested the complete works of\
    \ the out-of-print pamphleteer? I think not. It turns out that this New York professor\
    \ is almost as prolific as Dobson himself. Here is a list\u2014by no means complete\u2014\
    of the subjects to which Trinkaus has turned his attention: bicyclists, Brussels\
    \ sprouts, cases (attach\xE9, opening of), chapel attendance (drop-in), cookies\
    \ said to be baked by AIDS patients, empty beverage containers, gloves, lodging\
    \ discount coupons, mentalists, parking areas, physicians\u2019 offices (waiting\
    \ time in), railway terminals, sirens, supermarket checkout delays, tongs and\
    \ tissues, television game show contestants (handicapped), uncooked ground beef,\
    \ winter storms (weather persons\u2019 predictions of), yes (the word). If that\
    \ does not make him a Dobsonista, then tie me to a tree and call me Barry, as\
    \ Max D\xE9charn\xE9 has been known to say, often on Tuesdays. It turns out that,\
    \ unlike his precursor, Dr Trinkaus has a considerable presence on the web. Go\
    \ here to find out more about him."
