  text: "Ah, the man Kataplat. He had a terrible countenance. There is a line in a\
    \ Barbara Comyns novel describing a phantom with \u201Ca dreadful look of reproach\
    \ on its face\u201D. That was Kataplat, the furrier. He was a man of great erudition,\
    \ a classicist with a love of Venice. He had a cat called Doge & a dog called\
    \ Cato. His fearsomeness must not detain us, for the most fascinating thing about\
    \ him, which must be recorded here, was that he was an elf. Yes! A true elf, not\
    \ some Tolkeinish figure of cloying fantasy, but a real elf. Like all true elves,\
    \ he was fond of cake, and of glass-blowing. And he dealt in furs, which will\
    \ revolt some readers, and rightly so, but if you are an elf, needs must, which\
    \ would be quite clear to you were you an elf, which you are not, which you are\
    \ not, which you are not."
