  text: Queequeg was a member of the crew of the Pequod, in Moby-Dick, or; The Whale
    by Herman Melville (Harper & Brothers, New York, 1851). One of Queequeg's shipmates
    was, of course, Starbuck. It may be a tiny & futile way of joining the anti-globalisation
    protest, but here at Hooting Yard we always refer to the hydra-headed coffee bar
    chain as Queequeg's. (We do not neglect the apostrophe.) Another amusement is
    to wrench as many anagrams as possible from the word Starbucks. Burst sack and
    back truss are pleasing, although for lovers of medieval musical instruments,
    and by cheating a little (adding the national designation US) it is possible to
    slurp your coffee at Sackbuts R Us.
