  text: "\u201C\u2018What are the processes?\u2019 He eyed Herzog as though the man\
    \ had been an ox, a dog or even some inanimate object, coldly and with narrow-lidded\
    \ condescension\u2026 \u2018In Notodden, Norway, they have firebrick furnaces,\
    \ you understand, sir, with an alternating current of 5000 volts between water-cooled\
    \ copper electrodes. The resulting arc is spread by powerful electro-magnets,\
    \ so.\u2019 And he illustrated with his eight acid-stained fingers. \u2018Spread\
    \ out like a disk or sphere of flame, of electric fire, you see.\u2019 'Yes, and\
    \ what then?' demanded Flint, while his partner, forgetting now to smile, sat\
    \ there by the window scrutinizing him. One saw, now, the terribly keen and prehensile\
    \ intellect at work under the mask of assumed foppishness and jesting indifference.\u201D\
