  text: '"''What are the processes?'' He eyed Herzog as though the man had been an
    ox, a dog or even some inanimate object, coldly and with narrow-lidded condescension...
    ''In Notodden, Norway, they have firebrick furnaces, you understand, sir, with
    an alternating current of 5000 volts between water-cooled copper electrodes. The
    resulting arc is spread by powerful electro-magnets, so.'' And he illustrated
    with his eight acid-stained fingers. ''Spread out like a disk or sphere of flame,
    of electric fire, you see.'' ''Yes, and what then?'' demanded Flint, while his
    partner, forgetting now to smile, sat there by the window scrutinizing him. One
    saw, now, the terribly keen and prehensile intellect at work under the mask of
    assumed foppishness and jesting indifference." -- George Allan England, The Air
    Trust'
