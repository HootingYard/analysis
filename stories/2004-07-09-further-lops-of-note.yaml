  text: 'A week ago, on Friday 2nd July, we looked at some interesting lops. Here
    are two more. Lop Buri in Central Thailand, formerly known as Lawo, was one of
    the important ancient towns of the Khmers from the 10th to the 13th centuries.
    Many Khmer ruins are found in and around this town. During the Ayutthaya period,
    King Narai the Great established Lop Buri as the second capital with the help
    of French architects. Most of the architecture of that time reflects the mixture
    of Thai and Western styles. Here is a handy map:

    There is also the tantalising Project Lop, which has its own website. It''s a
    shame I do not read Japanese. If I did, I would be able to glean the purpose of
    the project which, given the graphic above, is clearly something Dobson ought
    to have written a pamphlet about.'
