  text: '"His epitaph upon the duck he killed by treading on it at five years old--Here
    lies poor duck / That Samuel Johnson trod on; / If it had liv''d it had been good
    luck, / For it would have been an odd one--is a striking example of early expansion
    of mind and knowledge of language" -- Hesther Lynch Piozzi, Anecdotes Of The Late
    Samuel Johnson, LL.D.'
