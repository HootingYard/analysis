  text: I'd hammer in the morning. I'd hammer very early in the morning, in what are
    called the small hours. I wouldn't hammer in the big hours, but I would use a
    big hammer. If I had a hammer, it would be a big hammer, and I would hammer in
    the small hours of the morning. But I no longer have a hammer. I have lost count
    of the times people come up to me and say, "Thaddeus," they say, "For Christ's
    sake stop adjusting your eyepatch for one minute and tell me why you don't have
    a hammer." What can I say? If I tell the truth--that I donated my hammer as a
    raffle prize for the Toffee Factory Charity Gala Night--I get that look of bewilderment
    and condescension that makes my blood boil and makes me want to start hammering
    my putative big hammer at four o clock in the morning. I then feel compelled to
    point out that all of the prizes on that fateful night were specifically requested
    by Mistress Brockbracke, who asked for donations of items that ended in -ammer,
    or its phonetic equivalent. So, in addition to my hammer, she was given a windjammer,
    a clamour (of rooks, in a spacious if rusty birdcage), a copy of Glamour magazine,
    a rubber stamp of the Greek letter gamma, several more hammers, and a banner,
    the latter given by the partially deaf man who loiters outside the post office
    with an eel wrapped round his neck. And I simply cannot be bothered to explain
    all that to the kind of people whose lives are so empty that all they can think
    about is to stop me mucking about with my eyepatch and to ask me why I haven't
    got a hammer.
