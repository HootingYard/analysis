  text: "I'd hammer in the morning. I'd hammer very early in the morning, in what\
    \ are called the small hours. I wouldn't hammer in the big hours, but I would\
    \ use a big hammer. If I had a hammer, it would be a big hammer, and I would hammer\
    \ in the small hours of the morning. But I no longer have a hammer. I have lost\
    \ count of the times people come up to me and say, \u201CThaddeus,\u201D they\
    \ say, \u201CFor Christ's sake stop adjusting your eyepatch for one minute and\
    \ tell me why you don't have a hammer.\u201D What can I say? If I tell the truth\u2014\
    that I donated my hammer as a raffle prize for the Toffee Factory Charity Gala\
    \ Night\u2014I get that look of bewilderment and condescension that makes my blood\
    \ boil and makes me want to start hammering my putative big hammer at four o clock\
    \ in the morning. I then feel compelled to point out that all of the prizes on\
    \ that fateful night were specifically requested by Mistress Brockbracke, who\
    \ asked for donations of items that ended in -ammer, or its phonetic equivalent.\
    \ So, in addition to my hammer, she was given a windjammer, a clamour (of rooks,\
    \ in a spacious if rusty birdcage), a copy of Glamour magazine, a rubber stamp\
    \ of the Greek letter gamma, several more hammers, and a banner, the latter given\
    \ by the partially deaf man who loiters outside the post office with an eel wrapped\
    \ round his neck. And I simply cannot be bothered to explain all that to the kind\
    \ of people whose lives are so empty that all they can think about is to stop\
    \ me mucking about with my eyepatch and to ask me why I haven't got a hammer."
