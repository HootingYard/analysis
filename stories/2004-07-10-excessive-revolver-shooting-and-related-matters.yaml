  text: 'My old mucker Max Decharne has sent an amusing list gleaned from his current
    reading matter, What The Censor Saw by John Trevelyan. The British Board of Film
    Classification has always been keen to protect the public from depictions of moral
    turpitude, and Max has helpfully noted the following examples of forbidden topics:

    1913 -- Indecorous dancing. Native customs in foreign lands abhorrent to British
    ideas.

    1914 -- Incidents injurious to the reputation of Govermental Departments. Unnecessary
    exhibitions of feminine underclothing. The effects of vitriol throwing. Stories
    tinctured with salacious wit. Sensual exposition of Eugenic Doctrines.

    1919 -- Criminal poisoning by dissemination of germs. Excessive revolver shooting.
    Animals gnawing men and children*. Clutching hands.

    1925 -- Libels on the British nursing profession. Bolshevik propaganda. Abdominal
    contortions in dancing.

    1926 -- Employee selling his wife to employer to cover defalcations. Severed human
    heads. Degrading exhibitions of animal passion. Indecent wall decorations. Dangerous
    mischief, easily imitated by children. Lecherous old men. Themes which are likely
    to wound the just susceptibilities of our Allies. Comic hanging. Breaking bottles
    on men''s heads.

    1931 -- Marriages within the prohibitive degree. Girls'' clothes pulled off. The
    Salvation Army shown in an unfavourable light.

    * NOTE : Presumably scenes showing animals gnawing women were allowed, then.'
