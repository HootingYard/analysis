  text: "My old mucker Max D\xE9charn\xE9 has sent an amusing list gleaned from his\
    \ current reading matter, What The Censor Saw by John Trevelyan. The British Board\
    \ of Film Classification has always been keen to protect the public from depictions\
    \ of moral turpitude, and Max has helpfully noted the following examples of forbidden\
    \ topics:\n1913\u2014Indecorous dancing. Native customs in foreign lands abhorrent\
    \ to British ideas.\n1914 -Incidents injurious to the reputation of Govermental\
    \ Departments.Unnecessary exhibitions of feminine underclothing. The effects of\
    \ vitriol throwing. Stories tinctured with salacious wit. Sensual exposition of\
    \ Eugenic Doctrines.\n1919\u2014Criminal poisoning by dissemination of germs.\
    \ Excessive revolver shooting. Animals gnawing men and children*. Clutching hands.\n\
    1925\u2014Libels on the British nursing profession. Bolshevik propaganda. Abdominal\
    \ contortions in dancing.\n1926\u2014Employee selling his wife to employer to\
    \ cover defalcations. Severed human heads. Degrading exhibitions of animal passion.\
    \ Indecent wall decorations. Dangerous mischief, easily imitated by children.\
    \ Lecherous old men. Themes which are likely to wound the just susceptibilities\
    \ of our Allies. Comic hanging. Breaking bottles on men's heads.\n1931\u2014Marriages\
    \ within the prohibitive degree. Girls' clothes pulled off. The Salvation Army\
    \ shown in an unfavourable light.\n* NOTE : Presumably scenes showing animals\
    \ gnawing women were allowed, then."
