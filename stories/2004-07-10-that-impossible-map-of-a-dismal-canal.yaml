  text: It was made using embroidery, crayons, buttons, string and grease, and it
    was enormous. It was stored in an aircraft hangar. The forty aeroplanes that used
    to occupy the space had all been smashed up by an aeroplane-smashing machine.
    What a fantastic machine it was! Did you know that it could pulverise an Immelmann
    in less than two minutes? And do so almost silently? It would not be true to say
    that you could hear a pin drop, but a box of pins, yes, that you would have heard.
    No pins were used in the making of the map, except for that patch of darning where
    the canal cuts through the site of the Old Shabby Bakery, where a tiny lock-keeper's
    hut now stands, marked on the map by a tiny drawing of a tiny lock-keeper's hut
    done in red crayon. (The lock-keeper is tiny, not the hut.) The crayons used,
    incidentally, were waxen ones, as used by small children when first learning to
    draws cows or other barnyard animals. There are no cows pictured on the enormous
    map, because no cows stray near the canal. The elegantly-detailed border, however,
    is decorated with schematic motifs representing linnets, shrikes and cormorants,
    also in red crayon. Some have questioned why eels are shown thrashing about in
    the canal at various points, particularly near the darned portion of the map and
    at what is known as the "Mad Section", but I am not at liberty to divulge the
    full facts of the matter until the centenary anniversary of the map's completion,
    by which time I will be old and incontinent and white of hair and dribbling and
    incoherent. I can hardly wait.
