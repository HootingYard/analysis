  text: 'Glyn Webster writes : "The bus driver on my route has learnt to play music
    on the door-opening hydraulics of his bus. When a pretty woman signals for a stop,
    he likes to make the door go A Phoo A Phoota Phoo A Phoo-phoo Phoot! HISS as it
    opens. What is that tune?" Well, Glyn, if I''m not mistaken it could be either
    the Passacaglia or one of the Four Sea Interludes from Benjamin Britten''s opera
    Peter Grimes. Any readers wishing to look further into this matter can go to the
    splendid Vehicle Sound Effects page, where such alluring items as bus pulling
    away, bus turn signal, bus applying airbrakes and, indeed, bus door opening and
    closing can all be listened to.'
