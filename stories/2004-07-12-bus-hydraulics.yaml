  text: "Glyn Webster writes : \u201CThe bus driver on my route has learnt to play\
    \ music on the door-opening hydraulics of his bus. When a pretty woman signals\
    \ for a stop, he likes to make the door go A Phoo A Phoota Phoo A Phoo-phoo Phoot!\
    \ HISS as it opens. What is that tune?\u201D Well, Glyn, if I'm not mistaken it\
    \ could be either the Passacaglia or one of the Four Sea Interludes from Benjamin\
    \ Britten's opera Peter Grimes. Any readers wishing to look further into this\
    \ matter can go to the splendid Vehicle Sound Effects page, where such alluring\
    \ items as bus pulling away, bus turn signal, bus applying airbrakes and, indeed,\
    \ bus door opening and closing can all be listened to."
