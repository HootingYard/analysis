  text: "CATACLYSMIC WINDS ASSAIL WINT through every season of the year. Many towers\
    \ ring the town. At its heart lies the district known variably as the Dung-rinds,\
    \ Gobbler's Rents, or the Old Pisspot Ground. Which of these you choose to call\
    \ it betrays your condition in life: peasants from the hinterlands, foreigners,\
    \ and parents of more than four children call it by the first name; churchgoers,\
    \ pickpockets, aircraft-pilots, amputees, unmarried detectives, corn-chandlers,\
    \ tongue-tied ex-schoolmarms and ambulance drivers by the second; and everyone\
    \ else, bar pirates of the high seas, by the third. Pirates of the high seas have\
    \ their own name for the district, but what that is has never been divulged to\
    \ the unpiratical. At the time of writing, I am father to seven children, so I\
    \ will henceforth refer to the area as the Dung-rinds.\nInto this noisome tangle\
    \ of open sewers, burial grounds, and dank forbidding alleyways came Fig, Brewster,\
    \ and Binnie. Each carried a satchel, and inside each satchel was a panoply of\
    \ deductive equipage: microscopes and microphones, hand-held two-way mirrors,\
    \ pots of fingerprint dust, packets of iron filings, clip-on moustaches, mauve\
    \ cretonne gloves, skeleton keys, false cheese-parings, rubber mothballs, wigs,\
    \ gats, shoe-enlargers, and Thompson pills, among other things.\nAt the Comptroller's\
    \ Gate, they flourished their intricately-forged identification papers. Brewster\
    \ was held up for ten minutes, as he bore little if no resemblance to the cherubic\
    \ and clean-shaven swineherd whose photograph appeared on his card. A generous\
    \ bribe, accompanied by threats of demented violence, eventually allowed him to\
    \ pass through the Gate. Scurrying to catch up with his chums, Brewster dropped\
    \ his satchel into a ditch: going back for it, he lost sight of them, and found\
    \ himself alone in the most sinister quarter of the Dung-rinds. Disorientated,\
    \ he wandered for hours through progressively more stinking streets, until, as\
    \ evening fell, he was set upon by a gang of knife-wielding maniacs, who cut him\
    \ to shreds, robbed him of his satchel, and left him for dead. Scooped up hours\
    \ later by the Dung-rinds Stretcher Patrol, Brewster was delivered to an ill-equipped\
    \ clinic, where he expired as dawn broke, and roosters crowed.\nMeanwhile, Fig\
    \ and Binnie had booked in to a gruesome guest-house. Once they had fallen asleep,\
    \ in lice-riddled cots, their luggage was subjected to an astonishingly thorough\
    \ examination by Jarvis and Paingue, a pair of rogues who occupied an adjoining\
    \ room. Jarvis was tousled, religious, and frank; his partner was lantern-jawed,\
    \ dyspeptic, and insane. Like many of Wint's criminal underclass, they were masters\
    \ of disguise. They roamed from slop-house to drinking-hole, thieving and swindling,\
    \ assuming different characters at each stopping-place. On the evening in question,\
    \ they had signed in to the guest-house as Tex Grimes, a circus sharpshooter (Jarvis),\
    \ and his balaclava-clad idiot half-brother (Paingue). No sooner did they hear\
    \ great blasts of snoring from the room wherein Fig and Binnie slept, than they\
    \ removed their big black boots and crept silently in. For such skilled robbers,\
    \ it was a matter of thirty seconds to rifle through their neighbours\u2019 belongings\
    \ and pocket everything of value. Jarvis returned to his room, weighed down with\
    \ booty. The crazed Paingue stayed behind, grasped a dirk which he kept tucked\
    \ into his sock, and cut the throats of his victims. Ten minutes later, Jarvis\
    \ now attired as a captain of industry and Paingue as a mint-sucking water-bailiff,\
    \ they clambered down the back staircase and headed for Wint's dingiest tavern,\
    \ The Treadmill & Cyclops.\nNow, consider my situation. Scrimgeour refuses to\
    \ supply me with booze. Mister Patch is reduced to a dribbling gibberer. Fig,\
    \ Brewster and Binnie are dead. A lesser man would have thrown in the towel, would\
    \ have forgotten all about Patch's pre-adhesive stamp collection, would have lain\
    \ in bed wailing and whingeing and wallowing in self-pity: but I am not a lesser\
    \ man. Oh, I wailed and whinged\u2014it's something I\u2019m good at\u2014but\
    \ only for five or six months.\nWell, until October the twelfth, to be exact.\
    \ I woke up that morning and a change came over me. My usual routine, as damnable\
    \ consciousness returned, was to bury my head in the pillows for an hour or two,\
    \ letting out shrieks and yelps, before ringing for Scrimgeour. As I slurped my\
    \ breakfast porridge, I harangued the retainer, comparing him unfavourably with\
    \ his predecessors and consigning him, his children, his children's children,\
    \ yea, unto every generation, into hell's fiery maw. Needless to say, Scrimgeour\
    \ was unperturbed. The rest of the day would pass in a nightmarish repetition\
    \ of these scenes, until at last I fell asleep again. On October the twelfth,\
    \ as I have said, something changed. I do not know why, but I awoke brimming with\
    \ happiness and zing. I summoned Scrimgeour, and before he arrived, I plumped\
    \ the pillows, sat up, and donned a fetching thrum nightcap, the better to signal\
    \ my transformation.\n\u201CWould sir like his porridge?\u201D asked Scrimgeour,\
    \ as he glided into my room.\n\u201CNo, Scrimgeour, sir would not like his porridge.\
    \ Tell me Scrimgeour, what is your first name?\u201D\nHe was startled: that was\
    \ one up to me.\n\u201CMy parents called me Agamemnon, sir.\u201D\n\u201CVery\
    \ well, Agamemnon: take out your notebook and pencil. I am going to give you a\
    \ long and complicated instruction and I fear your powers of recall will not be\
    \ sufficient without an aide memoire.\u201D\nHe went weak at the knees: I was\
    \ hugely pleased.\n\u201CNow then, Agamemnon, write all this down carefully: you\
    \ are to locate and consult as many firms of private detectives as possible, and\
    \ to adjudge if any of them harbour within their ranks a man or woman of Fig's\
    \ calibre. I will prepare a multiple-choice questionnaire to assist you in your\
    \ interrogations. In the unlikely event that you find someone with even a fraction\
    \ of Fig's talents, you will bring the person to me, and there will be an end\
    \ to your task. However, I suspect that Fig was in a class of his own, and that\
    \ you will return empty-handed, as it were. Thus I have made contingency plans,\
    \ which I will now outline in considerable detail.\u201D\nI spoke for over an\
    \ hour, and Scrimgeour wrote down as near as damnit every single word, in big,\
    \ sweeping block capitals. Before he scurried away to do my bidding, I let out\
    \ a blood-curdling screech and pointed with trembling fingers towards the ceiling.\
    \ As he turned his head and looked up, I managed to lift from his pocket a flask\
    \ of Buccaneer's Ruin, deftly concealing it under my nightcap in the instant before\
    \ he looked back at me.\n\u201CI thought I saw a windigo,\u201D I offered. The\
    \ retainer looked at me strangely, but went on his way.\nI had a devil of a job\
    \ getting the lid off the flask\u2014Scrimgeour had eerily muscular hands, and\
    \ when he screwed a cap on, he screwed it tight. My own hands were raw by the\
    \ time I succeeded, but the alcohol banged straight into my brain and I fell back\
    \ on the bed seeing stars and sunbursts.\nSix weeks later, Scrimgeour shuffled\
    \ into my bedroom and embarked upon a long-winded tirade, the gist of which was\
    \ that Fig was indeed matchless, that the hundreds of private detectives who had\
    \ answered my questionnaire were, without exception, the basest ninnies, and that\
    \ there was nothing for it but to put the contingency plan into operation.\nI\
    \ put the contingency plan into operation. A PT instructor was hired from a nearby\
    \ gymnasium, and I subjected myself to this florid brute's horribly rigorous training\
    \ programme until, by Christmas Eve, he considered me fit enough to climb mountains,\
    \ swim across wide rivers, and survive for a week in sub-zero temperatures on\
    \ a diet of thistles and rainwater. Meanwhile, Scrimgeour was filling a roomy\
    \ haversack with supplies, which included a magnifying glass, a portable sundial,\
    \ galoshes, forceps, The Principles of Magnetism by Buckingham Towser, dozens\
    \ of maps, a Mackenzie beam, and a belt. He was also busy annotating railway timetables,\
    \ priming miniature land-mines, wrapping endless lengths of cambric around my\
    \ candles, and pressing gummed tape on to wafers of balsa-wood.\nOn New Year's\
    \ Eve, I sought out my mother, and found her reclining on a couch in the drawing-room,\
    \ surrounded by hampers. She was reading a book about the Boxer Rebellion. With\
    \ some misgivings, I kissed her on the forehead and announced that I was fully\
    \ recovered from my malady, that I was going away, that I knew not when, if ever,\
    \ I would return, and that I required a few thousand panes to fatten out my wallet,\
    \ so could I have the key to the hatbox in which, I knew, she kept her cash? Please.\n\
    \u201CForks in a bath,\u201D she replied: no doubt I misheard her. I rummaged\
    \ in the sideboard until I found the key, and bounded upstairs to the attic. The\
    \ hatbox was there, buried under a large quantity of medicine balls, which I tossed\
    \ aside with gusto, enlivened by my recent PT drills. Unlocking what I had always\
    \ thought of as a veritable treasure-chest, I was beflummoxed: the hatbox held\
    \ only a five soiling piece, some tenpins in coins, and a saliva-splattered etching\
    \ of the Pointy Town Horse-Trough. Without finances, my contingency plan was doomed\
    \ to failure. I hared back down to the drawing-room to confront my mother, only\
    \ to find that she had vanished, and in her place were Daisy and Maisie. By now,\
    \ I was desperate. I threatened them with a pistol.\n\u201CI demand twenty thousand\
    \ panes!\u201D I shrieked, \u201CGet me the money now, or I\u2019ll pump you full\
    \ of bullets, you curs!\u201D\nI have always had a rich imaginative life. What\
    \ I really did was to whimper in the most nauseating manner, and retreat to the\
    \ garden. I trudged past the lupins and hollyhocks and turned towards the borage\
    \ beds, hidden from the house by high hedges. My mother had recently employed\
    \ a topiarist named Poxhaven, who I came upon now, squatting by a wheelbarrow\
    \ sharpening his shears on an abandoned lump of masonry.\n\u201CHow now, Mister\
    \ Poxhaven,\u201D I said. He ceased his honing and peered at me. Seldom have I\
    \ met anyone whose appearance was quite so ghastly. His yellow skin scarcely covered\
    \ the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black,\
    \ and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed\
    \ a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same\
    \ colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion,\
    \ and his straight black lips. His voice, when at last he spoke, was booming and\
    \ monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence.\n\
    \u201CYou look as miserable as a glut of yeast,\u201D he roared, \u201CAnd to\
    \ my way of thinking the indication is of woe beyond the reach of nursing. It\
    \ is a big horror to me that youth bends under the large iron of sadness.\u201D\
    \nHe was such an understanding man. I poured out my troubles to him: the torment\
    \ I felt that perhaps Fig and his companions had died in vain, that just as I\
    \ had decided to devote myself to the task they had begun, just as my preparations\
    \ were complete, now, on the eve of my departure, my plans faced ruin because\
    \ there was no money left in the family coffers, and I had no idea how to set\
    \ out on my adventure without a huge wad of cash to ease my way in the world.\
    \ How else was I to procure food and lodging, simple and innocent as I was? How\
    \ was I to bribe those I needed to bribe, to pay off the numerous rascals who\
    \ would place obstacles in my path?\n\u201CPrivilege brings in its train awful\
    \ strata of unknowingness,\u201D declaimed Poxhaven, \u201CMired in plenty you\
    \ would best to my method be cast into slumdom and need. Well would lessons other\
    \ humans learn be embossed on to your nerve-endings.\u201D\nThis was not what\
    \ I wanted to hear, but the dreadful gardener pulled a face which he probably\
    \ intended as a smile of sympathy, and continued.\n\u201CMister Patch I hold in\
    \ high odour: he is a king among punies. For this I will beat the panels of my\
    \ intellect to your benefit. Ears ho! In a child's steps of half a morning from\
    \ here lives a man they call a scrapmonger. Where my livelihood depends on the\
    \ odd shapings of greenery, his hangs on metals. Place in his yard all objects\
    \ of metal and in turn the monger pelts to his box and gives reams of panes from\
    \ therein. Take this chart of the steps\u2019 direction and go to him. My assistance\
    \ is huge and lofty and betokens no applause.\u201D\nThat night, while my aunts\
    \ and mother dangled in dreams\u2014start again. That night, while my mother and\
    \ my aunts slept, Poxhaven and I dismantled and removed from the house all the\
    \ metal we could lay our hands on: cutlery, taps, wiring, entire plumbing systems,\
    \ kitchen utensils, structural reinforcements\u2026. it is a wonder that the building\
    \ was still standing at dawn, as we drove Poxhaven's metal-laden pantechnicon\
    \ to the scrap-dealer. By eight in the morning, my wallet was stuffed with cash.\
    \ I do not know what became of Poxhaven, once he had finished turning my mother's\
    \ hedges into a leafy history of peasant uprisings. I know, however, that I would\
    \ not have been able to carry out the deeds recounted in the rest of this story\
    \ without his help, and for that, from\u2014as he would say \u2014the underparts\
    \ of my heart, tremendous thankyous rain upon his person.\nChapter Five \u2026"
