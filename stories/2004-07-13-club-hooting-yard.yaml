  text: "Book groups and reading clubs have become immensely popular in recent years,\
    \ so it is unsurprising\u2014if pleasing\u2014that various Hooting Yard Study\
    \ Groups have sprung up on at least three continents. As their name implies, the\
    \ Study Groups adopt a more rigorous and earnest approach to texts than the often\
    \ dilettanteish approach of the average book group. In Winnipeg, for example,\
    \ where a group meets on a weekly basis, they have thus far spent six sessions\
    \ on a close reading of the Istvan & Zoltan stories. (See the Unhelpful Index\
    \ to locate these on the site.) The Dobsonians, a gathering which meets monthly\
    \ in \xDClm, devotes itself only to those items which refer to the out-of-print\
    \ pamphleteer. Helpfully, they are at work on a catalogue raisonee which they\
    \ have already entitled the Codex Dobsoniana, though how many years they will\
    \ take on this valuable work is anybody's guess. Meanwhile, in some godforsaken\
    \ Antipodean outpost, a trio of readers meet every Thursday to pose each other\
    \ questions about the previous week's contents. They report that they have been\
    \ scribbling both the questions and answers in a notebook and that they will photocopy\
    \ it and send it to me when the book is full.\nI noted that buyers of Microsoft's\
    \ Encarta encyclopaedia are invited to join something called Club Encarta, and\
    \ it seemed to me that all these study groups ought to come together under an\
    \ umbrella Club Hooting Yard. I am working on a thoroughly exciting membership\
    \ pack at the moment. If you would like to join, or to affiliate your existing\
    \ study group, send an email to hooting.yard@btopenworld.com for further details."
