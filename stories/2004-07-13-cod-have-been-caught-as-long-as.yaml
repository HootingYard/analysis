  text: '"Cod have been caught as long as a man and weighing over a hundred pounds.
    A whole hare, a big guillemot with his beak and claws, a brace of duck so fresh
    that they must have been swallowed alive, a rubber wading boot, and a very learned
    treatise complete in three volumes--these are a few of the curiosities actually
    found in sundry stomachs of the all-devouring cod." -- William Wood, Elizabethan
    Sea Dogs'
