  text: "\u201CWhy,\u201D writes Tim Thurn, \u201Cdid you choose to illustrate chapter\
    \ four of Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars [see yesterday, below]\
    \ with a photograph of Emily Dickinson's gravestone? I cannot see the relevance.\u201D\
    \ Well, Tim, therein lies a story. For many years I have been plagued by nightmares\
    \ about the Belle of Amherst. Sometimes she comes wafting towards me hovering\
    \ in the air, surrounded by malignant hens or similar poultry. Sometimes I dream\
    \ that I am sitting in a shaded bower, scented by honeysuckle and lilac, idly\
    \ reading some imaginary pamphlet of Dobson's, when with terrifying suddenness\
    \ a wraith-like Emily Dickinson appears before me, wailing, flailing a cutlass\
    \ or scimitar at my head, a ghastly rictus distorting her face. At other times\
    \ I have woken with Lovecraftian shudders, trying to expel horrible nightmare-visions\
    \ of Emily Dickinson sat in the crows'-nest of a pirate ship, a necklace of teeth\
    \ and bones around her white neck, dropping cake-crumbs on to the heads of the\
    \ sailors below. So, Tim, every now and then I find that by contemplation of the\
    \ poet's tombstone, with that irrevocable Called Back May 15th 1886, I can remind\
    \ myself that she is indeed dead and gone, and so, for a few nights at least,\
    \ my sleep will be untroubled by her restless spirit.\nOn a related note, readers\
    \ may be interested to know that this morning I awoke from a vivid dream in which\
    \ Pansy Cradledew got married to Anthony Newley (1931-1999), the actor, writer\
    \ and musician (and influence on the young, Laughing Gnome-era David Bowie). Pansy\
    \ hastens to assure me that this is not the case, citing that, like Emily Dickinson,\
    \ the ex-husband of Joan Collins has also been \u201Ccalled back\u201D. However,\
    \ the alacrity with which she provided the picture below, a publicity shot for\
    \ Mr Newley's 1969 film Can Heironymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe And Find\
    \ True Happiness?, gives one pause for thought.\n\nThe heading for this item,\
    \ by the way, uses the Land of Nod in its now common sense as a euphemism for\
    \ sleep. Lest we forget, Nod was the land to which Cain was banished after he\
    \ slew his brother Abel. And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and\
    \ dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden (Genesis 4:16). One of Dobson's\
    \ earliest pamphlets was a gazetteer of Nod, excerpts from which we hope to publish\
    \ soon."
