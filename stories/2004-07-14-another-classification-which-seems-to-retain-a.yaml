  text: "\u201CAnother classification, which seems to retain a reminiscence of the\
    \ origin of devils from pagan deities, is effected by reference to the localities\
    \ supposed to be inhabited by the different classes of evil spirits. According\
    \ to this arrangement we get six classes: i. Devils of the fire, who wander in\
    \ the region near the moon, ii. Devils of the air, who hover round the earth,\
    \ iii. Devils of the earth, to whom the fairies are allied, iv. Devils of the\
    \ water, v. Submundane devils, vi. Lucifugi.\u201D \u2014 Thomas Alfred Spalding,\
