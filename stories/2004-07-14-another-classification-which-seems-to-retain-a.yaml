  text: '"Another classification, which seems to retain a reminiscence of the origin
    of devils from pagan deities, is effected by reference to the localities supposed
    to be inhabited by the different classes of evil spirits. According to this arrangement
    we get six classes: i. Devils of the fire, who wander in the region near the moon,
    ii. Devils of the air, who hover round the earth, iii. Devils of the earth, to
    whom the fairies are allied, iv. Devils of the water, v. Submundane devils, vi.
    Lucifugi." -- Thomas Alfred Spalding, Elizabethan Demonology'
