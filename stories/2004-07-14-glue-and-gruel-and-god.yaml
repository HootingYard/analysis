  text: '"Dear Mr Key," writes Poppy Nisbet, "I am worried that you and the other
    trusting folk at Hooting Yard have been seriously duped. I refer, of course, to
    your illustration of Mr Dust visiting the Pang Hill Orphanage (10th July). As
    he is depicted, Mr Dust has a suspicious halo, and the Pang Hill tinies look very
    rosy and well fed...Ah! I hear you say, but the Pang Hill gruel is second to none,
    and many have enjoyed good health as a result of its nourishing qualities! This
    may be, but it doesn''t explain the tots'' pious demeanor with hands in prayerful
    attitude or rosy crowns. Gruel is not God!"

    Ms Nisbet will be pleased to hear that we take accusations of dupery, hoaxing
    and suchlike shenanigans very seriously, and upon receipt of her letter we immediately
    appointed a special investigator to look into the matter. Rastus Blot, a diminutive
    but effective confidential agent, was recommended to us by Mrs Gubbins. Working
    with admirable speed, Agent Blot presented us with a fifty-page report, the conclusion
    of which reads as follows:

    There can be no doubt in my fuming brain that the man shown in the picture is
    Mr Dust the glue manufacturer. If you were to place your ear next to my skull
    you would probably be able to hear the synapses twang and whirr as my breathtaking
    intellect zipped into Supersonic Mode. It is no coincidence that the electrical
    impulses emitted by my cranium are enough to fell a bison at two hundred yards.
    Well, perhaps not a bison, but something smaller, an infant walrus perhaps, or
    a stoat. Now, in closing, may I politely suggest that you look very, very carefully
    at the subjoined map. If optically enhanced--like one of those grey, impossibly
    grainy photographs taken in Dealey Plaza on 22nd November 1963--you will be able
    to see Mr Dust sitting at his desk in his office, and you will note that he looks
    identical to the picture reproduced last Saturday. What Poppy Nisbet terms a "suspicious
    halo" is quite simply an exciting circular lozenge.
