  text: "\u201CDear Mr Key,\u201D writes Poppy Nisbet, \u201CI am worried that you\
    \ and the other trusting folk at Hooting Yard have been seriously duped. I refer,\
    \ of course, to your illustration of Mr Dust visiting the Pang Hill Orphanage\
    \ (10th July). As he is depicted, Mr Dust has a suspicious halo, and the Pang\
    \ Hill tinies look very rosy and well fed\u2026.Ah! I hear you say, but the Pang\
    \ Hill gruel is second to none, and many have enjoyed good health as a result\
    \ of its nourishing qualities! This may be, but it doesn't explain the tots' pious\
    \ demeanor with hands in prayerful attitude or rosy crowns. Gruel is not God!\u201D\
    \nMs Nisbet will be pleased to hear that we take accusations of dupery, hoaxing\
    \ and suchlike shenanigans very seriously, and upon receipt of her letter we immediately\
    \ appointed a special investigator to look into the matter. Rastus Blot, a diminutive\
    \ but effective confidential agent, was recommended to us by Mrs Gubbins. Working\
    \ with admirable speed, Agent Blot presented us with a fifty-page report, the\
    \ conclusion of which reads as follows:\nThere can be no doubt in my fuming brain\
    \ that the man shown in the picture is Mr Dust the glue manufacturer. If you were\
    \ to place your ear next to my skull you would probably be able to hear the synapses\
    \ twang and whirr as my breathtaking intellect zipped into Supersonic Mode. It\
    \ is no coincidence that the electrical impulses emitted by my cranium are enough\
    \ to fell a bison at two hundred yards. Well, perhaps not a bison, but something\
    \ smaller, an infant walrus perhaps, or a stoat. Now, in closing, may I politely\
    \ suggest that you look very, very carefully at the subjoined map. If optically\
    \ enhanced\u2014like one of those grey, impossibly grainy photographs taken in\
    \ Dealey Plaza on 22nd November 1963\u2014you will be able to see Mr Dust sitting\
    \ at his desk in his office, and you will note that he looks identical to the\
    \ picture reproduced last Saturday. What Poppy Nisbet terms a \u201Csuspicious\
    \ halo\u201D is quite simply an exciting circular lozenge.\n"
