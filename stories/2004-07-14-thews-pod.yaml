  text: 'On 30th April, we reported on the space-age-pod-turned-restaurant on the
    outskirts of Bodger''s Spinney, noting that maverick Digby Thew had been appointed
    as head chef. Building work was completed early in June, and the eaterie has now
    been open for a month, so we thought we would find out from Mr Thew how things
    were going. Unfortunately, he was not available for comment, as he suffered a
    near-fatal casserole accident and is under heavy sedation in some clinic somewhere.
    His charming assistant chef, who preferred not to give her name, told us:

    "With Digby out of the way, we have been able to turn the space-age-pod into a
    truly spectacular restaurant. Where else do you think you could get two slices
    of toast and a cup of boiled goo for the same price as a bag of toffees? The longer
    that nitwit stays in hospital the better for us, and the better for our customers.
    And that means better for the socioeconomic infrastructure of Bodger''s Spinney
    and its windswept and dreary hinterland, from the oddly-shaped purple mountains
    of Lewdbag to the roadworks on the Blister Lane Bypass, from Pang Hill to Loopy
    Copse. Just the other day I was talking to one of the frogmen who drag the ponds
    for the bones of drowned birds, and he said that he had never known such bliss.
    You can''t argue with that."'
