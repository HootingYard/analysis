  text: "On 30th April, we reported on the space-age-pod-turned-restaurant on the\
    \ outskirts of Bodger's Spinney, noting that maverick Digby Thew had been appointed\
    \ as head chef. Building work was completed early in June, and the eaterie has\
    \ now been open for a month, so we thought we would find out from Mr Thew how\
    \ things were going. Unfortunately, he was not available for comment, as he suffered\
    \ a near-fatal casserole accident and is under heavy sedation in some clinic somewhere.\
    \ His charming assistant chef, who preferred not to give her name, told us:\n\u201C\
    With Digby out of the way, we have been able to turn the space-age-pod into a\
    \ truly spectacular restaurant. Where else do you think you could get two slices\
    \ of toast and a cup of boiled goo for the same price as a bag of toffees? The\
    \ longer that nitwit stays in hospital the better for us, and the better for our\
    \ customers. And that means better for the socioeconomic infrastructure of Bodger's\
    \ Spinney and its windswept and dreary hinterland, from the oddly-shaped purple\
    \ mountains of Lewdbag to the roadworks on the Blister Lane Bypass, from Pang\
    \ Hill to Loopy Copse. Just the other day I was talking to one of the frogmen\
    \ who drag the ponds for the bones of drowned birds, and he said that he had never\
    \ known such bliss. You can't argue with that.\u201D"
