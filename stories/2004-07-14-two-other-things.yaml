  text: Today is, of course, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille during
    the French Revolution. But let us also recall that it is the 91st birthday of
    ex-Potus Gerald R Ford, the man who pardoned Richard Milhous Nixon. Not only that,
    but on this day in 1916, when little Gerald was just three, Tristan Tzara declaimed
    the First Dada Manifesto in Zurich. Here is a link to a 1921 Dada Manifesto.
