  text: One of Confidential Agent Blot's earlier investigative triumphs was cracking
    the case of the dishevelled marmalade man. Let us recall the facts. The whinnying
    of horses had disturbed the sleep of the little village of Spraingue for two months.
    There was a damp, hideous thing in the corner of the post office that none dared
    approach. Perhaps most jarring of all, an illegal cafeteria had been built slap
    in the middle of the village, surrounded by menacing guard dogs whose fangs glistened
    in the moonlight. Agent Blot arrived on the scene on a Tuesday afternoon frantic
    with gales. His dazzling cone-shaped hat made the villagers wonder what frustum
    it had once topped. His complexion was paler, more drawn and anguished than usual,
    possibly because a change in diet had given him a recent attack of the seeds,
    from which he was not yet fully recovered. His breath was tanged with the fumes
    of his weird pills, those tiny pink spangles Dr Glag had insisted upon. Agent
    Blot commandeered an abandoned birdseed silo as his headquarters, and subjected
    every single villager to a lengthy interrogation. His manner was charming but
    curiously unnerving. The clinic was soon filled with haunted-looking patients
    demanding to have their brains sluiced with Baxter's Terrible Fluid. By Saturday
    afternoon, with no let up in the gales, Spraingue had an air of almost Biblical
    calamity. And yet, and yet... as soon as his last interview was done with, Agent
    Blot sprang upon the dishevelled marmalade man and carted him off to the dungeon
    in his cave. The horses' whinnying ceased. The thing in the post office evaporated.
    A law was passed to make the cafeteria legal, and the dogs bounded away across
    the hills, their atrocious yapping growing ever fainter, until it could no longer
    be heard at all.
