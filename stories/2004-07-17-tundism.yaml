  text: Readers will recall that Mrs Gubbins has managed to elude the police by gaining
    sanctuary with the Tundists. We have just received the latest brochure from the
    Tundist Owl Library and are delighted to report that the octogenarian crone has
    been appointed general editor of the Pamphlets About Owls For Tiny Tots series,
    which is certainly in need of a revival. Since the previous editor, Mr Binder,
    collapsed on a hillside twenty years ago, there has been only one addition to
    the series, the frankly unreadable Preen Your Owl With Verve & Gusto. According
    to the new brochure, Mrs Gubbins has exciting plans to issue at least two new
    pamphlets a week. We have sent a coded message asking if we can reprint some of
    them here, and await her reply.
