  text: '"How many holy liars and parasites, in solemn guise, would his saviour arm
    drag from their luxurious couches, and plunge in the cold charnel, that the green
    and many-legged monsters of the slimy grave might eat off at their leisure the

    smooth, smiling, polished villain, whom all the city honours; whose very trade
    is lies and murder; who buys his daily bread with the blood and tears of men,
    would feed the ravens with his limbs. The Assassin would cater nobly for the eyeless
    worms of earth, and the carrion fowls of heaven." -- Percy Bysshe Shelley, The
