  text: "The stalking of a robber with the head of a toad is one of twenty six items\
    \ in a biographical index to the life of the criminal mastermind Walter Mad. The\
    \ full index can be read in Chapter Five of Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down\
    \ From The Stars, the latest episode in our thrilling weekly serial. It is curious\
    \ that Dobson never turned his attention to Walter Mad, for he was fascinated\
    \ by despicable malefactors of every stripe. He wrote percipiently about the so-called\
    \ Irksome Poisoner of Cupflop, the Hungarian maniac Borag Lacko, and Blasphemous\
    \ Ted Cargpan, among others, yet the indefatigable pamphleteer seems to have overlooked\
    \ the madman once described as \u201Cthe Steed Malbranque of Crime\u201D, in reference\
    \ to the evocatively-named football player. An annotated anthology of Dobson's\
    \ writings on very, very bad people is currently in preparation.\n\nSteed Malbranque\
    \ : a football player, not to be confused with Walter Mad, a criminal madcap"
