  text: 'The stalking of a robber with the head of a toad is one of twenty six items
    in a biographical index to the life of the criminal mastermind Walter Mad. The
    full index can be read in Chapter Five of Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down
    From The Stars, the latest episode in our thrilling weekly serial. It is curious
    that Dobson never turned his attention to Walter Mad, for he was fascinated by
    despicable malefactors of every stripe. He wrote percipiently about the so-called
    Irksome Poisoner of Cupflop, the Hungarian maniac Borag Lacko, and Blasphemous
    Ted Cargpan, among others, yet the indefatigable pamphleteer seems to have overlooked
    the madman once described as "the Steed Malbranque of Crime", in reference to
    the evocatively-named football player. An annotated anthology of Dobson''s writings
    on very, very bad people is currently in preparation.


    Steed Malbranque : a football player, not to be confused with Walter Mad, a criminal
