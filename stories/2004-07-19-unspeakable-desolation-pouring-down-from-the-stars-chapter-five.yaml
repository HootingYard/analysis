  text: 'ON MY FATHER''S TWENTY first birthday, Professor Underlip--or Walter Mad,
    as I had better call him--was forty. Almost a year had passed since poor Patch
    told me the story of the theft, so by my calculations, Mad was now ninety eight:
    check that yourself, I think you''ll find it''s correct.

    My first stop, having set out upon my quest, was at the reference library of Spangles,
    a market town some three days'' journey from home. Resting my haversack in the
    cloakroom, I charged into the newspaper archive and consulted the biographical
    index, which consisted of untold thousands of little pencil-scrivened cards housed
    in a series of metal filing cabinets. The index had been devised by a certain
    Riggory Dewe, an amateur who had also turned his mind to the design of oars, the
    analysis of socks, and a revolutionary scheme for the eradication of mumps in
    the Trobriand Islands. When I have finished with this story, I have a good mind
    to write a thumping great biography of Dewe: he was a gifted and fascinating man.

    Not the least of his accomplishments was the Spangles Newspaper Reference Index,
    a scheme which, to my knowledge, has never been used elsewhere, for reasons which
    mystify me. I intend to write a lengthy chapter on Dewe''s system in the biography,
    so I will not go into detail here. As a taster, however, I reprint below the contents
    of the Walter Mad index card.

    Unzipping a little bag full of tokens, I made my way to the issuing desk and requested
    newspaper number 644000012: there being no obvious place to start, I thought I
    may as well plunge in at random and discover why Mad had questioned the existence
    of fish. Pocketing my token, the librarian pointed towards a small wooden bench,
    and requested that I sit there until the newspaper was delivered from the vaults.

    There were five other people waiting: one had a long grey beard; one was inspecting
    a scrap of paper on which arcane details of ships'' moorings had been roughly
    scribbled; one was chewing on a radish; one seemed fast asleep; and the fifth,
    next to whom I sat down, was cradling in his hairy hands a .44 Pugsley--an alarmingly
    powerful revolver--which he immediately poked into the small of my back. At the
    same moment, his mouth, full of an implausible number of filthy, unbrushed teeth,
    was jammed next to my right ear-hole. Noises issued from this mouth, but such
    was my terror that at first I was unable to wring any meaning from them: it was
    like listening to my mother. Slowly--although in truth it can only have taken
    a few seconds --the whispers assailing my ear congealed into sensible words: if
    anything, my terror heightened.

    "Act naturally," I heard, "Stand up, walk out of the library, and go towards the
    owl sanctuary--it''s on your left, past the baths, the chemist''s shop, the Town
    Hall and the pigeon lofts."

    "Ung," I said, for which my spine was prodded rather painfully by the Pugsley.

    So I stood up, looked wildly about me and, seeing no librarians dashing to my
    assistance, made my way towards the owl sanctuary. Ten minutes later, arriving
    at a clump of simnel trees in which dozens of owls were snoozing, my abductor
    ordered me to halt.

    "What do you want with me?" I asked, in a quavering little voice. The gun-toting
    git was still behind me, and I dared not look round.

    "I trade in tin futures," he said mysteriously. I waited for further details,
    but he remained silent. At times like these, I have an annoying tendency to start
    babbling, so I did.

    "Ah, tin. An intriguing metal, isn''t it? I remember once reading a study of metal-planet
    affinities which allied tin to Jupiter. Apparently the ancient Etruscans called
    the planet Jupiter Tins--"

    He clouted me on the head with his free hand, so I shut up.

    "When I am not trading in tin futures," he rasped, "I act as a special agent for
    the Turquoise Badge Ten." He paused to let that sink in, but I had no idea what
    he was talking about, and I told him so.

    "The Turquoise Badge Ten," he explained, "Is an impossibly powerful secret society.
    Woe unto the nit who incurs its wrath, as you have done. Take off your hat. Good:
    put it on the ground directly in front of you. The Turquoise Badge Ten sent me
    to forestall you in your Walter Mad researches: unfortunately, I have not been
    given permission to kill you. For some reason best known to themselves, they have
    ordered me to swipe your hat, to clout you twice upon the head--there, that''s
    the second--and to put you into a crate and take you to their headquarters. I
    am now going to collect the crate, and to make sure you do not run away, I am
    going to bury you up to your waist. Hand me that shovel."

    God knows where the crate was: it took him about four hours to fetch it. During
    that time, when I had finished sobbing and shouting fruitlessly for help, it struck
    me that perhaps this was all for the best, and that being delivered into the clutches
    of the Turquoise Badge Ten, far from being a terrible calamity, was an unexpected
    opportunity to get to the heart of the matter. The special agent was a considerate
    man, in his way. He had insisted that I wrap a large sheet of oilcloth around
    my legs and feet, so that, when submerged in the earth, my boots and trousers
    would not get muddy. From a sack, he took some floral-embroidered cushions and
    placed them comfortingly around me. He set up a little folding-table and arranged
    on it a packet of trout-paste sandwiches, a flask of cocoa, a fly-swatter, a Tilly
    lamp, and a selection of reading matter, including Gargle''s The Life and Times
    of Colonel Bigot, half a dozen improving tracts published by the Society for the
    Regulation of Orphanages, a rare edition of a tremendously exciting sci-fi yarn
    by Chlorine Winslow, and the cumulative index, bound in greaseproof paper, of
    the Journal of Nosebleed Research.

    It was getting dark, and the owls were waking, when my abductor reappeared, trundling
    a wheelbarrow on which the crate rocked unsteadily. By the time he had dug me
    out of the ground, he was puffed out.

    "Look," I said, "I''m quite happy to accompany you. We can take it in turns to
    push the wheelbarrow. Just before we get to the HQ I''ll jump into the crate:
    that way you can pretend you''ve followed your orders to the letter." And, of
    course, I''d be able to memorise the route: I learned a thing or two from Fig,
    you know.

    "Splendid, splendid," said the special agent, "I must say I wasn''t looking forward
    to pushing this damnable crate, with you inside it, for a forty mile stretch.
    I have a metal pin in my leg."

    We shook hands in a sort of hearty, two-chaps-together way. I fancied he was smiling
    behind his starched linen mask, worn to ensure that I could not identify him at
    a later date.

    "There''s a spot of cocoa left, if you''d like some," I offered.

    "Yum," he said.

    As I stooped to pour out the remains of the flask, he sneaked up behind me and
    whipped a blindfold around my head. The hot cocoa splashed on my hand and I whimpered.

    "Sorry about that," he said, reasonably, "But I can''t have you knowing the location
    of the Turquoise Badge Ten HQ. If we meet anyone on the way, I''ll pass you off
    as a victim of some particularly hideous crime. I am now going to insert a pair
    of corks into your ears, so you won''t be able to retrace the route from auditory
    clues. And don''t worry--I''ll make sure you don''t bump into anything."
