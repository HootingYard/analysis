  text: 'The above quotation from Sabine Baring-Gould describes an insubstantial,
    phantom figure with a "complexion of curd". That phrase applies perfectly to the
    indubitably solid, corporeal person of Dr P V C Pote, the subject of one of Dobson''s
    most inspiring pamphlets. Indeed, Dobson begins with a highly-wrought flight of
    fancy in which he suggests a number of alternatives for his subject''s ever-enigmatic
    initials, among which is "Pallor Very Curd-like".

    Dr Pote would be forgotten today had he not achieved a kind of immortality via
    the sixty-page biography in which Dobson''s prose achieves an almost hallucinatory
    opulence. Here is the celebrated passage in which Pote''s prowess as a speaker
    is lauded:

    "This pallid man with a complexion of curd held his listeners spellbound as, standing
    upright in a high wind, he told them of the death of Avicenna, by taking nine
    clysters together in a fit of the Colick. His audience had no sooner digested
    this news than the good doctor moved on, informing them that all the air beyond
    Thule is thick, condensed and jellied, looking just like sea lungs. They badgered
    him with questions, all of which he answered with good grace, and no little humour,
    before describing to them a snow piece, of land and trees covered with snow and
    ice, and mountains of ice floating in the sea, with bears, seals, foxes, and variety
    of rare fowls upon them, then explaining the priests'' curing of mad dogs by burning
    them in the forehead with Saint Bellin''s Key, before describing the quite unrelated
    matter of a noble Quandros or stone taken out of a vulture''s head. Brains bedizened
    by the doctor''s magpie mind, his listeners were near replete, yet he had one
    more topic for them, ending his lecture with a twenty-minute anecdote of bewildering
    complexity about a glass of spirits made of aethereal salt, hermetically sealed
    up, kept continually in quicksilver; of so volatile a nature that it will scarce
    endure the light, and therefore only to be shown in winter, or by the light of
    a carbuncle, or Bononian stone. And then he was done, and he pulled his black
    cape about his shoulders, and swept away, into the wind, implacable and majestic,
    of the finest fibre from which a man can be hewn, notwithstanding a pallor of
    curd."'
