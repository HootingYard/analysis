  text: "The above quotation from Sabine Baring-Gould describes an insubstantial,\
    \ phantom figure with a \u201Ccomplexion of curd\u201D. That phrase applies perfectly\
    \ to the indubitably solid, corporeal person of Dr P V C Pote, the subject of\
    \ one of Dobson's most inspiring pamphlets. Indeed, Dobson begins with a highly-wrought\
    \ flight of fancy in which he suggests a number of alternatives for his subject's\
    \ ever-enigmatic initials, among which is \u201CPallor Very Curd-like\u201D.\n\
    Dr Pote would be forgotten today had he not achieved a kind of immortality via\
    \ the sixty-page biography in which Dobson's prose achieves an almost hallucinatory\
    \ opulence. Here is the celebrated passage in which Pote's prowess as a speaker\
    \ is lauded:\n\u201CThis pallid man with a complexion of curd held his listeners\
    \ spellbound as, standing upright in a high wind, he told them of the death of\
    \ Avicenna, by taking nine clysters together in a fit of the Colick. His audience\
    \ had no sooner digested this news than the good doctor moved on, informing them\
    \ that all the air beyond Thule is thick, condensed and jellied, looking just\
    \ like sea lungs. They badgered him with questions, all of which he answered with\
    \ good grace, and no little humour, before describing to them a snow piece, of\
    \ land and trees covered with snow and ice, and mountains of ice floating in the\
    \ sea, with bears, seals, foxes, and variety of rare fowls upon them, then explaining\
    \ the priests' curing of mad dogs by burning them in the forehead with Saint Bellin's\
    \ Key, before describing the quite unrelated matter of a noble Quandros or stone\
    \ taken out of a vulture's head. Brains bedizened by the doctor's magpie mind,\
    \ his listeners were near replete, yet he had one more topic for them, ending\
    \ his lecture with a twenty-minute anecdote of bewildering complexity about a\
    \ glass of spirits made of aethereal salt, hermetically sealed up, kept continually\
    \ in quicksilver; of so volatile a nature that it will scarce endure the light,\
    \ and therefore only to be shown in winter, or by the light of a carbuncle, or\
    \ Bononian stone. And then he was done, and he pulled his black cape about his\
    \ shoulders, and swept away, into the wind, implacable and majestic, of the finest\
    \ fibre from which a man can be hewn, notwithstanding a pallor of curd.\u201D"
