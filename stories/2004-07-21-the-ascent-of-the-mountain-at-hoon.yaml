  text: 'There were four hundred of us. Lars carried the water in a shallow basin,
    spilling a small amount of our vital supply each time he stumbled over concealed
    heaps of bauxite or other points of geological interest. Helga was able to top
    up the basin by melting patches of snow with her bunsen burner, but there was
    very little snow on the lower slopes, and what there was had invariably been shat
    on by pigs, wildebeeste, geese, and bats. By the second day, Lars had managed
    not only to spill the entire water supply, but had also cracked the basin in half
    by accidentally bashing it against a rogue shard of basalt. The rest of us were
    furious. Venables wanted to hurl Lars over a precipice. Van Gob brandished his
    rifle with menace, muttering threats. Lars merely sulked, squatting in the bracken
    and whittling away at a small piece of wood he had painted crimson some years
    earlier. The tension mounted.

    Then Horst discovered some strange blueish flecks in a piece of rock. Gritting
    his teeth, he set about it with his iron hammers, and we were astonished to watch
    incandescent liquid spurt forth, forming a bright arc over the ramshackle encampment
    of pitched tents we called home. Glubb was the first to drink the liquid, for
    his thirst was the stuff of legend. He collected some in a battered tin cup and
    swallowed it at a gulp. Moments later, just as we were lighting a bonfire, his
    eyes glazed over and he stamped his feet in a demented rhythm. He began to declaim,
    slowly, in a booming voice quite unlike his usual prissy prating. He said:

    "I have seen red shelves stacked with a thousand corks. The corks have teeth-marks
    in them, as if they have been gnawed, by a billy-goat or other beast of the field.
    Then, and only then, a vision of mud. I have listened to the sound made by chaffinches,
    and walked a hundred miles in driving rain, burning clay until it explodes, tying
    endless knots in brown canvas flags. My breath is the breath of a man who has
    the gift of tongues, a man who has spoken with corncrakes. Gemstones have I for
    ears, and putty for a hat. Wrap me in chrysanthemums, inveigle me with truncated
    proverbs--I shall not hear, for I hear only the clanking of broken churchbells
    set swinging high in towers when the air is still and the sky has vanished. I
    say to you that I am as of Ack, that which has a light known not unto you. Nor
    shall it ever be known unto you, for yours are the eyes and ears of pebbles lying
    scattered on the floor of the vasty deep. I have lavished you with ice and wood
    and Ack, and now I must begone from your sight. Farewell."

    So saying, Glubb marched away, uphill, towards the summit. He did not look back.
    We never saw him again.

    The next morning, Lars was detailed to return to the sordid village at the foot
    of the mountain to get a new supply of water and a new basin in which to carry
    it. Lip''s attempt to glue the cracked basin back into one piece had failed, because
    the paste he used was contaminated. Waving farewell to Lars, and leaving Lip to
    catch up with us after extricating his arm from a narrow vertical crevice in the
    mountainside, we pressed on. Brabant took snapshots along various stages of the
    climb. There was a particularly good one of Helga making final adjustments to
    her snorkelling gear before diving to the bottom of the Imaginary Lake At The
    Mountain At Hoon, which has enticed so many earlier pilgrims on this route. Brabant
    himself was heroic, urging us onward whenever we became disconsolate or morose.
    He handed out his special biscuits, which tasted of bones, but were as nutritious
    as pemmican. On the eighth day, while everyone else was asleep, Brabant shaved
    off his massive walrus moustache. When we awoke, not one of us recognised him.
    Charming japes like this kept our spirits up.

    It was on the eleventh day that we became worried about Lars, who had still not
    rejoined the party. Venables, Piccolo and Chasuble volunteered to go back in search
    of him. Before they left, Father Todge offered Mass. Just as Lip was about to
    take the communion wafer, we were distracted by a thunderclap, and the rains began.
    We sheltered under a limestone outcrop that seemed terribly crumbly. Van Gob did
    sterling work shoring it up with some of the zinc and titanium rods which he carried
    in his knapsack for such an emergency. The only sour note that day occurred when
    Dennis, spotting a lame horse through his tin telescope, witlessly left the shelter
    in order to parley with it. He was struck by lightning and incinerated. The horse
    whinnied and limped away.

    Some days later, the rains stopped at last. Delaying only to bury what was left
    of Dennis, we made rapid progress towards the summit. Jean-Pierre and Istvana
    carried my wheelchair over ravines and gullies, at the bottom of one of which
    I noticed a huge pile of cutlery. It was perplexingly free of rust.

    As we climbed higher, a yellow foul-smelling mist descended. On the fortieth day,
    Annette''s flask disappeared in a puff of roseate vapour. Brabant''s head took
    on the appearance of a turnip. It was he who announced that we had not brought
    enough oxygen tents. I began to knit furiously, doling out scarves, balaclavas,
    and woolly leggings to the company as fast as I was able. But we all realised
    things could not continue for much longer. When we estimated that we were four
    days'' climb from the summit, we gathered in Strob''s big tent for a meeting.
    Tempers were frayed, and Minnie''s attempts to jolly us along by singing selections
    from Ezra Pound''s Cowboy Songbook met only with hissing. We chewed what was left
    of the pickle supply and tried to iron out a strategy. After some aimless discussions,
    Venables announced that he had carried out an inventory. His eyes gleamed dangerously
    as he said:

    "I have divided the inventory into three distinct categories, as follows. Category
    A, supplies we have exhausted; category B, supplies which we will exhaust within
    the next eighteen hours; and category C, supplies of which we have a huge and
    unwarrantable surplus. My inventory gives the following results: A--asbestos,
    bails, crimping irons, doilies, electric shoes, febrifuge, grey bags, and harpoonery;
    B--ip, jumble, kohl and largesse; C--muck, nose cones, operating tables, polevaulting
    equipment, querns, rosary beads, starch, talc, urns, varnish, whisks, expropriated
    jam, yashmaks and zobb. Hmm. You all look rather surprised. I don''t blame you.
    We have not been sensible of our peril. We cannot -"

    He was interrupted by a commotion at the entrance flap. We all looked round, and
    were startled to see Lars, heavily bearded, broken sunglasses hanging off one
    ear, struggling into the tent. He was carrying a giant bolt of sailcloth which
    appeared to be threaded with gold. Ashen-faced, Lars lurched to the podium and
    began to speak. We could hardly hear him, for he was close to death, and his words
    were mere gasps. It was only later I realised that he was revealing to us the
    knowledge he had kept hidden all along, thus consigning us to an icy fate on this
    terrible mountain. Why had he not told us before? As it was, none of us caught
    his meaning at the time. We heard only incoherent wheezing, which we dismissed
    as the raving of a dying imbecile.

    We buried Lars in a shallow grave and proceeded to unroll the sailcloth. The thread
    was indeed spun of gold, but if the cloth had any significance it was not apparent.
    Using Helga''s cutlass, we cut it into sections to make hoods, blankets, bandages,
    and tourniquets. The next day, before we continued boldly on, Curwen challenged
    Horst to a wrestling match. The two of them had been arguing for days, following
    a brouhaha over the pitons. We formed a circle around

    [The manuscript breaks off at this point. We are indebted to Waldemar Ng for this
    translation from the Hungarian. Unlike earlier translators, Ng had access to the
    actual woodblocks on which the narrator carved his journal. It is now over forty
    years since they were discovered, wedged in a crevasse halfway up the mountain
    at Hoon. Did the expedition reach the summit before they vanished without trace?
    We shall never know. The woodblocks, incidentally, are housed in the Museum at
    Ack-on-the-Vug, where they are guarded by a surly curator named Mungo. Gifts of
    raw meat and insect repellent are likely to melt Mungo''s cold black heart, should
    one wish to examine the woodblocks at leisure.]'
