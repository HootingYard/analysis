  text: "\u201CThe figure was that of a man, in shabby clothes, with a sallow, mean\
    \ face, a retreating forehead, with hair cut after the French fashion, and a moustache,\
    \ dark. The jaws and chin were covered with a bristly growth, as if shaving had\
    \ been neglected for a fortnight. The figure did not appear to be thoroughly solid,\
    \ but to be of the consistency of curd, and the face was of the complexion of\
    \ curd.\u201D \u2014 Sabine Baring-Gould, A Dead Finger"
