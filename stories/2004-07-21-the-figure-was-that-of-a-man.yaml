  text: '"The figure was that of a man, in shabby clothes, with a sallow, mean face,
    a retreating forehead, with hair cut after the French fashion, and a moustache,
    dark. The jaws and chin were covered with a bristly growth, as if shaving had
    been neglected for a fortnight. The figure did not appear to be thoroughly solid,
    but to be of the consistency of curd, and the face was of the complexion of curd."
