  text: '"A sarcastic chuckle from the professor interrupted: "Don''t try heroics,
    my friend. It is useless!" As Flannery cursed, the fiend turned to a metal cabinet
    on the wall beside his desk. He busied himself with glass tubes for a while, mad
    mutterings and chuckles falling from his throat in an unintelligible rumble of
    sound. Then, without looking at the reporter, he approached the girl, a large
    red pill on his outstretched palm. A lurid oath spewed from Arn Flannery''s lips
    as he strained upward. Blind fury gave him the strength of a maniac." -- Lars
    Anderson, The Yellow Curse'
