  text: "\u201CA sarcastic chuckle from the professor interrupted: \u201CDon't try\
    \ heroics, my friend. It is useless!\u201D As Flannery cursed, the fiend turned\
    \ to a metal cabinet on the wall beside his desk. He busied himself with glass\
    \ tubes for a while, mad mutterings and chuckles falling from his throat in an\
    \ unintelligible rumble of sound. Then, without looking at the reporter, he approached\
    \ the girl, a large red pill on his outstretched palm. A lurid oath spewed from\
    \ Arn Flannery's lips as he strained upward. Blind fury gave him the strength\
    \ of a maniac.\u201D \u2014 Lars Anderson, The Yellow Curse"
