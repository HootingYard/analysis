  text: "A Google search for Dobson yields no less than 1,150,000 results. Of course,\
    \ a handful of these purport to be about other Dobsons, rather than the out-of-print\
    \ pamphleteer himself. Having examined all the pages with a fine tooth comb, I\
    \ am breathless in my admiration for Dobson's skills as a master of disguise.\
    \ He has somehow managed to continue his subterfuge from beyond the grave, which\
    \ is some feat, as I am sure you can appreciate. But it was ever thus. Four days\
    \ after his death, a balaclava-clad farmyard person swore an affidavit before\
    \ a provincial solicitor that he had seen Dobson squatting behind his pig hut,\
    \ scribbling notes into a ledger, but that when he\u2014the farmyard person\u2014\
    returned with cronies, to accost the wraith, \u201CDobson\u201D, if it was he,\
    \ had vanished, leaving only a toothpaste tube from which much of the paste had\
    \ already been eked, and a sinister plasticine duck, possibly intended to be a\
    \ bufflehead, the head of which was squashed by the farmyard person's mastiff,\
    \ by accident. Was it Dobson? Probably not, but who can say for certain?\nInspired\
    \ by the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, whose aim is to \u201Cname at least one\
    \ notable public landmark in each [US] state and all 3,067 counties after the\
    \ 40th president [i.e., the Potus]\u201D, Hooting Yard is setting up the Dobson\
    \ Legacy Project. No city, town, village, hamlet, or cluster of shabby rural buildings\
    \ ought to be without its very own Dobson Boulevard. I implore all readers to\
    \ fire off a letter to their local bureaucrat this very minute!"
