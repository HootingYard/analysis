  text: 'A Google search for Dobson yields no less than 1,150,000 results. Of course,
    a handful of these purport to be about other Dobsons, rather than the out-of-print
    pamphleteer himself. Having examined all the pages with a fine tooth comb, I am
    breathless in my admiration for Dobson''s skills as a master of disguise. He has
    somehow managed to continue his subterfuge from beyond the grave, which is some
    feat, as I am sure you can appreciate. But it was ever thus. Four days after his
    death, a balaclava-clad farmyard person swore an affidavit before a provincial
    solicitor that he had seen Dobson squatting behind his pig hut, scribbling notes
    into a ledger, but that when he--the farmyard person--returned with cronies, to
    accost the wraith, "Dobson", if it was he, had vanished, leaving only a toothpaste
    tube from which much of the paste had already been eked, and a sinister plasticine
    duck, possibly intended to be a bufflehead, the head of which was squashed by
    the farmyard person''s mastiff, by accident. Was it Dobson? Probably not, but
    who can say for certain?

    Inspired by the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, whose aim is to "name at least one
    notable public landmark in each [US] state and all 3,067 counties after the 40th
    president [i.e., the Potus]", Hooting Yard is setting up the Dobson Legacy Project.
    No city, town, village, hamlet, or cluster of shabby rural buildings ought to
    be without its very own Dobson Boulevard. I implore all readers to fire off a
    letter to their local bureaucrat this very minute!'
