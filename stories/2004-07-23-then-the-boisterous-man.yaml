  text: First there was a flask of tea to be screwed shut, and cloud-patterns to be
    analysed, with the aid of diagrams drawn on clear plastic, from a pile kept in
    a locker by the boiler room, which was always locked, even on Thursdays, when
    inspectors came, three of them, driving up in a sort of van that looked like it
    had been built behind the Iron Curtain during the 1950s but was, remarkably, almost
    brand new, as you could learn if you took a close look at it once it had been
    parked, rather sloppily, next to that incredible cedar tree on the branches of
    which dozens upon dozens of birds perched, let us not catalogue the birds, there
    is not time enough for that, except to remark that the tree was innocent of owls,
    and always had been, for reasons known only to ornithologists, particularly the
    resident ornithologist, that insouciant man who always wore velvet, there was
    talk that his only inheritance when his parents perished in a funicular railway
    accident in some distant mountain range or other was a bolt of mauve crushed velvet,
    but I don't know the truth of that, I don't know the truth of anything, I don't
    even know what time it is, I haven't slept for a week, I lie awake all night terrified
    of my familiar, the tiny invisible goblin that scampers around my room and gnaws
    at the curtains and the wainscot. First there was a flask of tea to be screwed
    shut, and then the boisterous man went paddling in a fresh puddle, having kicked
    off his big boots and hung his socks on a fence. Well, I was that boisterous man.
    I was a happy splasher, until my invisible goblin came to stay.
