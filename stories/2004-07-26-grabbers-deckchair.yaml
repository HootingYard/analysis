  text: "There is a woodworm-riddled frame of a deckchair on show in the Museum at\
    \ Ack-on-the-Vug. It was donated by the talented Bolivian water polo ace Rodrigo\
    \ Grabber. The canvas of the chair has long since rotted away, and such is the\
    \ fragility of the wood that the exhibit is kept in a special air-tight cabinet,\
    \ into which fumous preserving substances are pumped through a cleverly-designed\
    \ valve-and-nozzle affair reputedly constructed by Grabber himself.\nGrabber is\
    \ a fascinating figure, best described by Maud Pastry in her seminal Children's\
    \ Illustrated History Of Bolivian Water Polo, the fourth edition of which has\
    \ recently been published. Pastry states that Grabber is \u201Cdiminutive, arch,\
    \ lewd, hirsute, prone to fits, and often covered in breadcrumbs, but only when\
    \ he is on dry land; for once he enters the water, he comes into his element,\
    \ and not even the greatest of poets could find words to describe the grace and\
    \ exuberance of his water polo playing\u2014not Dante, not Donne, not Chumpot\u201D\
    .\nThis is all tosh, of course, but has long interested scholars who have attempted\
    \ to identify Pastry's last-named great poet, of whom nothing is known. Grabber\
    \ himself\u2014elfin and preening\u2014was so intrigued by the reference that\
    \ he missed the quarter final of the All Bolivia Water Polo Championship Tournament\
    \ Play-off in 1954. And why? Because on the afternoon of that important match,\
    \ Grabber was searching through dusty tomes in the basement of the bibliotheque,\
    \ seeking information on Chumpot\u2014but to no avail. To this day, the existence\
    \ of the poet has not been confirmed. Some hold that Pastry (or someone on her\
    \ team of forty editorial assistants) misspelled the name. Piv has compiled a\
    \ list of alternative spellings for consideration\u2014among them Shampong, Thumpboot\
    \ and Cargpan\u2014but this is probably a red herring. Of more worth, perhaps,\
    \ is the present international attempt to gain access to the Pastry archives,\
    \ wherein lies the manuscript of her book. The Archives are housed in a lead-lined\
    \ sealed cabin at the bottom of a gaping pit dug into a blizzard-racked swathe\
    \ of Antarctic nothingness. Once the expedition party has located the pit, it\
    \ will only be a matter of time before the manuscript is recovered, and a solution\
    \ to the Chumpot mystery found at last!\nMuseum records do not indicate why Grabber\
    \ donated this rotting deckchair. Legend has it that the chair (when intact) was\
    \ used by Grabber's mother during her days on the Central Helsinki Pipistrelle\
    \ Bats For Orphans Committee."
