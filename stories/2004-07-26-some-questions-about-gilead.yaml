  text: Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Is the chemist's
    shop shut? Has the clinic been boarded up? Why does the Ambulance of Gilead sit
    rusted in a locked and bolted garage, its siren broken and its tyres punctured
    flat? What happened to all that balm anyway? Was it stolen by a ruthless gang
    of aromatic resin smugglers? Did the gang abduct the physician as part of the
    plan? Was the local television station prompted to show Celebrity Balm In Gilead
    Sniffer Dog Challenge? Did the massed bloodhounds and their permatanned owners
    fail to find even the merest trace of resin? Did the gang succeed in carting off
    all the balm in Gilead to their mountain lair? What are we to make of the conjecture
    in the press that the physician's abduction was a piece of fakery and that he
    was the mastermind behind the plot? How long did it take for a hack on the Daily
    Shackle to dub the affair Balmingileadgate? Will there ever again be balm in Gilead?
    Who is the young whippersnapper who has arrived, announcing himself as the replacement
    physician? Is there something reproachful and oily about his manner? Why does
    he keep referring to the missing balm as "gumme" or "triacle"? Is he unable to
    spell "treacle", or is he up to something? Why does he refuse to divulge the recipe
    for the bandage paste he uses? Is he in league with his predecessor, and with
    his predecessor's alleged gang? Is there any connection between the fact that
    the new oily physician has put posters up all over the place promising to rid
    the populace of "evil humours" and that "malign bile ad" is an anagram of "balm
    in Gilead"? What on earth is that stuff the new physician smears on his hair?
    Must it pong so offensively? Has he no shame? If you know the answers to any of
    these questions, or can assist the Gilead medical authorities in any way, please
    write to the Balm In Gilead Appeal c/o Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb.
