  text: "I WAS SITTING IN an extremely comfortable armchair. Unseen hands had removed\
    \ the corks from my ears and the blindfold from my eyes. To my right stood a delicately-latticed\
    \ birdcage in which a chaffinch tweeted. To my left, a tattooed thug brandished\
    \ a pointed stick. In front of me, ten people dressed entirely in black sat behind\
    \ a long wooden table: each sported a turquoise badge, pinned over their hearts.\
    \ The table was cluttered with incomprehensible paraphernalia.\n\"We are the Turquoise\
    \ Badge Ten,\" said the person fifth from the left. I can't say I was surprised.\
    \ \"Each of us will ask you one question,\" she continued, \"You will answer the\
    \ questions fully and frankly. Should we suspect that you are withholding from\
    \ us any information, whether or not we deem it pertinent we will bid our thug\
    \ to poke at you with his pointed stick.\"\nIf you have ever found yourself in\
    \ a situation remotely similar to this, you will understand why my immediate reaction\
    \ was to ask where the lavatory was. All ten of them sighed as one, as if they\
    \ were used to such shenanigans. The thug pointed to a yellow painted arrow on\
    \ the floor.\n\"Follow the arrows,\" he said, \"And come right back.\"\nThe lavatory\
    \ was at the end of a twisting series of corridors. There were five cubicles and\
    \ a single urinal. When I had poohed, flushed, and washed my hands at the strangely\
    \ gigantic sink, it struck me that there was nothing to stop me roaming at will\
    \ through the HQ until I saw fit to return to my interrogation. Leaving the lavatory,\
    \ I pranced off down yet another corridor, and pushed open the first door I came\
    \ to.\nThe room I entered was dark and dingy. I was unable to find a light-switch,\
    \ so I closed the door behind me and waited until my eyes had got used to the\
    \ gloom. Before they had done so, I was almost overpowered by the unmistakeable\
    \ smell of hamster. I held a kerchief over my nose and gagged. Why had I not noticed\
    \ the stench as soon as I opened the door? Oh, let's just say I forgot to mention\
    \ it. Gradually, I picked out the details of the room: flock wallpaper; scuffed\
    \ lino; enormous bells, their clappers removed, lying on their sides; a hospital\
    \ trolley shoved into a corner; torn bits of maps pinned higgledy-piggledy on\
    \ the walls; a pile of papers jammed into the open drawer of a filing-cabinet;\
    \ a jewel-encrusted spittoon; a dead moth; a garden incinerator; an empty crate;\
    \ a cage containing abundant straw and seemingly dozens of hamsters; a glass eye\
    \ in a bowl of water; and a cracked jug upon the mantelpiece, on the handle of\
    \ which a beetle dozed. Was there anything here worthy of my attention? No.\n\
    Back in the interrogation room, I found that the thug had been replaced by a coeval,\
    \ fairer of complexion, and armed with a proper spear rather than a pointed stick.\n\
    \"You were gone rather longer than we expected,\" said one of the Turquoise Badge\
    \ Ten, \"We sent our other thug off to track you down.\"\n\"I got a bit lost,\"\
    \ I explained.\n\"Wool cannot be pulled over our eyes,\" I was told, \"Bear that\
    \ in mind.\"\n\"Right,\" I said, sitting down hurriedly in the armchair seconds\
    \ before Thug Number 2 was about to manhandle me into it. \"We will each now ask\
    \ you a question,\" said the one furthest to the right, \"I will go first. What\
    \ is your name?\"\n\"Ignatz Milkbone,\" I lied: it was, of course, an anagram.\
    \ The fact that not one of the Ten batted an eyelid reassured me: apparently it\
    \ was possible to pull wool over their eyes. I can be quite naive, I'm afraid.\n\
    \"Why are you wearing a false moustache?\"\nDamn! Maybe they weren't as credulous\
    \ as I had thought.\n\"Er,\" I mumbled, \"It was given to me by a friend as an,\
    \ um, St Septimus' Day present. If I hadn't stuck it to my upper lip with industrial-strength\
    \ adhesive, he'd have been heartbroken. Hm. I can see that you're not convinced.\
    \ Shall I try again? Be full and frank, you said. The moustache is part of my\
    \ Tip-Top Disguise Kit. Before setting out from home, I adopted a variety of devices\
    \ designed to conceal my true identity.\"\nFeeling rather foolish, I detached\
    \ the moustache, removed the wads of cotton wool which I had wedged inside my\
    \ mouth to puff out my cheeks, and took off the clear-glass spectacles set in\
    \ violent crimson frames which I had been wearing since I set out on my adventure.\
    \ Scarcely had I done so than the third question was rapped at me.\n\"Have you\
    \ ever read The Dictionary of Stains by Walter Mad?\"\nThere was no need to think\
    \ up a pack of lies this time. I had never even heard of the book.\n\"During your\
    \ journey here, on the Thursday night when you camped on a knoll next to the Great\
    \ Frightening River, our special agent went through your pockets. Among the items\
    \ which he has brought to our attention is a commemorative postage stamp depicting\
    \ the captain of the winning team in the 1904 Hooting Yard Water-Tennis Championship.\
    \ The cancellation is rather smudged. We believe that the stamp is one of a set\
    \ belonging to a client of ours. Would you care to tell us how it came into your\
    \ possession?\"\n\"Certainly,\" I replied, eager to please. \"It is a stamp I\
    \ have always treasured. It was given to me by a school-friend. He was lanky,\
    \ and covered in boils. His name is [forgotten, alas!], and I believe he is the\
    \ nephew of the philatelist Istvan Plunkett.\"\nI was rather pleased with my reply.\
    \ It was honest, for one thing, and it contained little details which I hoped\
    \ would ingratiate me with my questioners. They did not stir: I might as well\
    \ have been prating in a foreign tongue.\n\"The fifth question is not, strictly\
    \ speaking, a question at all. It is more in the way of a command. Tell us everything\
    \ you know about Istvan Plunkett.\"\n\"Oh, I could go on for hours,\" I replied,\
    \ \"I have read, what, three or four biographies of that towering figure.\"\n\"\
    Tell us everything you know,\" the speaker repeated.\nI was not exaggerating when\
    \ I said I could go on for hours. By the time I had reached the exciting story\
    \ of Plunkett's trip to Iceland when he was seventeen, the thug had dozed off.\
    \ The Turquoise Badge Ten were surprised, I think, at the breadth of my erudition.\
    \ I could not have done better had I been Plunkett himself. I knew all about the\
    \ blotting paper scandal, the woodland hike which ended with the accidental death\
    \ of Plunkett's mentor and champion, Father Pod, the rigours of his boating, the\
    \ weft of his tunics, the grease on his sister's lantern: I went on and on, so\
    \ much so that the thug had to be roused to fetch me a glass of water. Eventually,\
    \ one of the Ten held up her hand and bid me cease.\n\"Wait, wait!\" she cried,\
    \ \"This is most interesting, but I think we have heard enough for one day. Let\
    \ us retire to our hammocks, and reconvene in the morning.\"\nI had no idea what\
    \ time it was: the special agent had pocketed my tin-and-titanium alarm clock.\
    \ The Turquoise Badge Ten filed out of the room, and, at a prod from the thug's\
    \ spear, I followed them. We passed down the twisting corridors to the Chamber\
    \ of Hammocks, a lushly-carpeted room in which a dozen hammocks had been strung\
    \ up in a neat row. I was guided to mine by the thug, but before I could clamber\
    \ into it, one of the Ten held aloft a Vitus Bering Pennant and everyone else\
    \ in the room stood to attention. I thought it best to ape them.\n\"Let us sing\
    \ a sea shanty!\" shouted the pennant-bearer, whereupon the lot of them, thug\
    \ included, burst into song.\nYo ho ho! Land ahoy! Paint the deck with varnish!\n\
    \  We've been at sea for twenty years and we've run out of rum.\n  Picture our\
    \ atrocious state: we are quite disgusting.\n  The captain's beard is caked with\
    \ salt, his timbers have been shivered.\n  What a useless ship we've got! The\
    \ wood is surely rotten.\n  The whole hulk stinks of mouldy meat and half the\
    \ crew has scurvy.\n  We shall dock in half an hour, if they'll let us in.\n \
    \ If they won't, just you watch, we'll start our cannons roaring.\n  The harbourmaster's\
    \ flying flags, not one of them's a white one.\n  One's got a plague warning writ\
    \ upon it, and one's stained red for danger.\n  Yo ho ho! We'll sail on! There\
    \ is no berth here for us.\n  We have no berth in any port, but what the hell,\
    \ life is short,\n  We'll sail upon these ugly seas until we're stricken by disease,\n\
    \  Until each crewman's sickened and died, each corpse been hurled over the side,\n\
    \  And washed to shore on the high tide, and washed to shore on the high tide.\n\
    And with that, they all tumbled into their hammocks and started to snore. They\
    \ made such a din that I couldn't be bothered to even try to sleep. Instead, I\
    \ crept tippy-toes out of the room and scurried along the corridors until I found\
    \ a cocoa-dispensing machine. I started to read the instructions, but they were\
    \ so complicated that I gave up, and extricated a steaming hot plastic tumbler\
    \ of cocoa by means of a few well-aimed kicks and a great deal of shaking and\
    \ clattering.\nSquatting on the floor, I reviewed the situation. The Turquoise\
    \ Badge Ten, Walter Mad, and Istvan Plunkett: all of them were in some way connected\
    \ with the purloined stamp collection. Fig-like, I leapt intuitively to a theory.\
    \ Indefatigable collector that he was, I conjectured, Plunkett had an obsessive\
    \ desire to own Mister Patch's pre-adhesive album: the Ten were charged with the\
    \ task of obtaining it for him. They in turn employed Walter Mad as their agent.\
    \ If this was the case, I was wasting my time--and possibly risking my life--\
    \ by remaining at the HQ. I had to track down Plunkett, obviously. Draining my\
    \ cocoa-tumbler, I got to my feet, and capered off down the gas-lit corridor to\
    \ find the way out.\nChapter Seven..."
