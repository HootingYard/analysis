  text: "\u201CI notice little worms carrying tufts and feathers; I make out some\
    \ with flabby fins constantly flapping on their backs. What are they all doing\
    \ there? What are their names? I do not know. And I stare at them for ever so\
    \ long, held by the incomprehensible mystery of the waters.\u201D \u2014 J Henri\
