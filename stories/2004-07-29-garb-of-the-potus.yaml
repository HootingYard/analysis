  text: 'Yesterday we published a picture of Ivan The Terrible, in an item about Tsars,
    and it led me to reflect on the manner in which potentates of old used to dress
    up to the nines. You knew you were dealing with an emperor or a grand vizier,
    because they were festooned in finery, while you were just a snivelling peasant
    in rags. Nowadays, of course, the powerful like to pretend that they are just
    like us, and dress more or less accordingly. Look at a group of world leaders--who,
    when gathered, always seem to be photographed standing on the steps of an imposing
    building--and you will see an array of extremely dull business suits. It may as
    well be a convention of accountants. Good news, then, from Boston, where wannabe
    Potus John Kerry announced that, if elected, he will make all his public appearances
    in a special Potus-suit.
