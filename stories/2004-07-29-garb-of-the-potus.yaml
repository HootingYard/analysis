  text: "Yesterday we published a picture of Ivan The Terrible, in an item about Tsars,\
    \ and it led me to reflect on the manner in which potentates of old used to dress\
    \ up to the nines. You knew you were dealing with an emperor or a grand vizier,\
    \ because they were festooned in finery, while you were just a snivelling peasant\
    \ in rags. Nowadays, of course, the powerful like to pretend that they are just\
    \ like us, and dress more or less accordingly. Look at a group of world leaders\u2014\
    who, when gathered, always seem to be photographed standing on the steps of an\
    \ imposing building\u2014and you will see an array of extremely dull business\
    \ suits. It may as well be a convention of accountants. Good news, then, from\
    \ Boston, where wannabe Potus John Kerry announced that, if elected, he will make\
    \ all his public appearances in a special Potus-suit.\n"
