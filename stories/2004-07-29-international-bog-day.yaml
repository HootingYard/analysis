  text: According to the superb wikipedia, tomorrow is International Bog Day, a time
    for all of us to sing the praises of sphagnum. I am distraught to note that for
    once the wiki is wrong, as the celebration came five days early this year. However,
    one sure way to recover from such a trauma is to ponder all the other special
    days or weeks that are celebrated around the world. I am particularly fond of
    "Awareness Weeks", those times when we are urged to raise our consciousness about--usually--health-related
    matters. But why should nosebleeds, coughing fits, running sores and botched trepanning
    operations get all the attention? It's time to broaden the range. I therefore
    propose that next week should become Potato Awareness Week, with Wednesday as
    International Pencil Sharpener Day. Before introducing an exciting new calendar,
    however, I ought to check up on what already exists. I am sure there must be a
    website somewhere giving comprehensive details of all these things, but I haven't
    found it. If any reader can help, please send details of useful links.
