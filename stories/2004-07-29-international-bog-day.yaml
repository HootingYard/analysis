  text: "According to the superb wikipedia, tomorrow is International Bog Day, a time\
    \ for all of us to sing the praises of sphagnum. I am distraught to note that\
    \ for once the wiki is wrong, as the celebration came five days early this year.\
    \ However, one sure way to recover from such a trauma is to ponder all the other\
    \ special days or weeks that are celebrated around the world. I am particularly\
    \ fond of \u201CAwareness Weeks\u201D, those times when we are urged to raise\
    \ our consciousness about\u2014usually\u2014health-related matters. But why should\
    \ nosebleeds, coughing fits, running sores and botched trepanning operations get\
    \ all the attention? It's time to broaden the range. I therefore propose that\
    \ next week should become Potato Awareness Week, with Wednesday as International\
    \ Pencil Sharpener Day. Before introducing an exciting new calendar, however,\
    \ I ought to check up on what already exists. I am sure there must be a website\
    \ somewhere giving comprehensive details of all these things, but I haven't found\
    \ it. If any reader can help, please send details of useful links."
