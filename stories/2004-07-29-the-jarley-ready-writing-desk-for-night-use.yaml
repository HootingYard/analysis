  text: "\u201CThe Jarley Ready Writing-Desk for Night Use, for instance, was a really\
    \ remarkable conception. Its chief value lay in the saving of gas and midnight\
    \ oil to impecunious writers which its use was said to bring about, and when fully\
    \ equipped consisted simply of a writing-table with all the appliances and conveniences\
    \ thereof treated with phosphorus in such a manner that in the blackest of darkness\
    \ they could all be seen readily. The ink even was phosphorescent. The paper was\
    \ luminous in the dark. The penholders, pens, pen-wipers, mucilage-bottle, everything,\
    \ in fact, that an author really needs for the production of literature, save\
    \ ideas, were so prepared that they could not fail to be visible to the weakest\
    \ eye in the darkest night.\u201D \u2014 John Kendrick Bangs, The Booming Of Acre\
    \ Hill"
