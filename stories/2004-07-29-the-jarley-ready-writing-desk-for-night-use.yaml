  text: '"The Jarley Ready Writing-Desk for Night Use, for instance, was a really
    remarkable conception. Its chief value lay in the saving of gas and midnight oil
    to impecunious writers which its use was said to bring about, and when fully equipped
    consisted simply of a writing-table with all the appliances and conveniences thereof
    treated with phosphorus in such a manner that in the blackest of darkness they
    could all be seen readily. The ink even was phosphorescent. The paper was luminous
    in the dark. The penholders, pens, pen-wipers, mucilage-bottle, everything, in
    fact, that an author really needs for the production of literature, save ideas,
    were so prepared that they could not fail to be visible to the weakest eye in
    the darkest night." -- John Kendrick Bangs, The Booming Of Acre Hill'
