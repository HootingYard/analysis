  text: "Another thing that was mentioned yesterday\u2014in the quotation from Mr\
    \ Bangs\u2014was a phosphorescent mucilage bottle. This important item of stationery\
    \ is never far from my thoughts, nor should it be from yours. I am uncertain as\
    \ to the phosphorescent quality of Bixby's mucilage\u2014if indeed it is luminous\
    \ at all\u2014but of course there is nothing to stop you customising it. Given\
    \ a lick of luminous paint, this splendid item would lend a certain dash to the\
    \ meanest escritoire.\n\nOh, that reminds me. We have a souvenir bottle of Ayn\
    \ Rand \u201CFountainhead\u201D Mucilage to give away. Just answer the following\
    \ question, and the first correct answer received will win. Bear in mind that\
    \ it will hardly be our fault if the bottle gets lost in the post.\nIf a flap\
    \ is protruding from a spindle in the headquarters of a deranged criminal mastermind,\
    \ why can you hear the faint sound of a plunging dirigible?"
