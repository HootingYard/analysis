  text: 'Another thing that was mentioned yesterday--in the quotation from Mr Bangs--was
    a phosphorescent mucilage bottle. This important item of stationery is never far
    from my thoughts, nor should it be from yours. I am uncertain as to the phosphorescent
    quality of Bixby''s mucilage--if indeed it is luminous at all--but of course there
    is nothing to stop you customising it. Given a lick of luminous paint, this splendid
    item would lend a certain dash to the meanest escritoire.


    Oh, that reminds me. We have a souvenir bottle of Ayn Rand "Fountainhead" Mucilage
    to give away. Just answer the following question, and the first correct answer
    received will win. Bear in mind that it will hardly be our fault if the bottle
    gets lost in the post.

    If a flap is protruding from a spindle in the headquarters of a deranged criminal
    mastermind, why can you hear the faint sound of a plunging dirigible?'
