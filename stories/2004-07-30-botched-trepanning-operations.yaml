  text: "Yesterday's passing mention of botched trepanning operations prompted Pansy\
    \ Cradledew to remind me of the account given by Nestingbird in his Everything\
    \ You Always Wanted To Know About Dobson But Were Afraid To Ask. I am pleased\
    \ to reprint it here:\nFor about a week, Dobson had been jabbering to anyone who\
    \ would listen that he was determined to have a hole drilled in his skull. He\
    \ had been impressed by the sixties songstress Julie Felix, and convinced himself\
    \ that if he, too, had his cranium punctured, he may be able to resume his abortive\
    \ musical career. In spite of the loud groaning of his friends, Dobson bought\
    \ a ukulele and sat listening repeatedly to Julie Felix's recording of The Great\
    \ Brain Robbery, trying hopelessly to learn the chords.\nThursday came, a day\
    \ of incomprehensible weather and newspaper headlines about a previously unknown\
    \ strain of potato blight. Dobson slipped out of the house before breakfast, returned\
    \ his library books, and caught a train to Mustard Parva, where, having located\
    \ the high street, he rapped upon the door of Dr Stanley Hinge.\n\u201CI want\
    \ you to drill a hole in my skull!\u201D shouted Dobson, overenthusiastically,\
    \ brandishing a drill-bit in the face of the bewildered medico. The pamphleteer\
    \ wrongly believed that Dr Hinge was the local secretary of the Julie Felix Fan\
    \ Club and would therefore be sympathetic. Alas, he had got the wrong man.\nWhat\
    \ happened next was so appalling that I cannot bring myself to describe it to\
    \ the delicate readers of Hooting Yard. Suffice to say that Dobson emerged from\
    \ Dr Hinge's surgery three hours later, bloodied and bandaged, with no less than\
    \ fourteen dents in his head. Dents, but no holes. Suffering from temporary amnesia\
    \ as a result of the doctor's cack-handed attentions, Dobson spent the next three\
    \ months wandering aimlessly around some hideous rural backwater, living off berries\
    \ and canal water, sleeping in various noisome barnyards and talking to cows."
