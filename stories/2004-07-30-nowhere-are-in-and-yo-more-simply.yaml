  text: '"Nowhere are In and Yo more simply and adequately imaged than in the vegetable
    kingdom. The trunk of a tree is Yo, its foliage, In; and in each stem and leaf
    the two are repeated. A calla, consisting of a single straight and rigid spadix
    embraced by a soft and tenderly curved spathe, affords an almost perfect expression
    of the characteristic differences between Yo and In." -- Claude Fayette Bragdon,
    The Beautiful Necessity'
