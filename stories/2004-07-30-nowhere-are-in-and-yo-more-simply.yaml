  text: "\u201CNowhere are In and Yo more simply and adequately imaged than in the\
    \ vegetable kingdom. The trunk of a tree is Yo, its foliage, In; and in each stem\
    \ and leaf the two are repeated. A calla, consisting of a single straight and\
    \ rigid spadix embraced by a soft and tenderly curved spathe, affords an almost\
    \ perfect expression of the characteristic differences between Yo and In.\u201D\
