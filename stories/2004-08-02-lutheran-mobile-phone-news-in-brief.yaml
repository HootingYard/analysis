  text: "Sometimes those little items buried in the \u201Cin brief\u201D section of\
    \ the newspaper can be written with such panache that they leave you begging for\
    \ more detail. Consider this, from last Saturday's Guardian (via Reuter's):\n\
    Swedish Lutheran pastor Helge Fossmo was jailed for life after faking text messages\
    \ from God to get his lover to murder his wife and try to kill the husband of\
    \ another lover.\nOne sentence, thirty two words, but what endless fascination!\
    \ There is the germ of a story here, or a novel, and certainly a Hitchcock film.\
    \ I read that, and I had to know more. Typing \u201CHelge Fossmo\u201D into Google\
    \ brings up a variety of pages\u2014like this one\u2014but somehow, for me, reading\
    \ a fuller version of events detracts from the genius of that brief snippet.\n\
    STOP PRESS : Pansy Cradledew begs to differ. She writes : \u201CI found the full\
    \ story about Pastor Helge quite intriguing. I'm desperate to know more about\
    \ a \u2018strange sect\u2019 that allowed middle-aged men to behave like Casanovas,\
    \ and how the Uppsala court could possibly have believed that Helge's text messages\
    \ were \u2018supporting\u2019 his nanny in her faith rather than inciting her\
    \ to kill\u2026.It's like a Scandinavian Stepford. And what of the mysterious\
    \ first Mrs Fossmo? I think we're only seeing the tip of the fjord, myself.\u201D"
