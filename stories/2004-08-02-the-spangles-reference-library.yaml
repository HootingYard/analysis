  text: 'The reference library in Spangles, mentioned in today''s instalment of the
    enthralling serial Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars, is, as
    far as I know, the only library in the world to hold a complete run of Dobson''s
    short-lived periodical A Lantern In The Pit. The Lantern, as it was known, was
    a bold attempt to shed Dobsonian light on various intractable questions, chiefly
    of a philosophical bent. For some unknown reason, the pamphleteer-turned-journalist
    chose to compose most of the contents in a so-called ur-lingua of his own devising.
    He provided no translations, and all the papers relating to what he hoped would
    become a new universal language were destroyed in the Potato Building fire. We
    are left with seven fat issues of the magazine, densely packed with text which
    is--and, one assumes, will remain--devoid of meaning. Various cryptographers have
    at one time or another tried to crack Dobson''s code, but most of them have given
    up when they discovered that no one would pay them. Here is a mercifully brief
    extract, from Volume 2, Number 1:
