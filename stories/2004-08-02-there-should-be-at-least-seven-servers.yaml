  text: "\u201CThere should be at least seven servers for Benediction\u2014two acolytes,\
    \ four torch-bearers, and a thurifer. All will be ready vested in soutane and\
    \ surplice, wearing altar shoes, with torches lighted and thurible prepared, five\
    \ minutes before the hour. They will arrange themselves in ranks just outside\
    \ the priest's sacristy. Whenever, during the time that the Blessed Sacrament\
    \ is exposed, it is necessary to leave or enter the Sanctuary, a reverence is\
    \ made on both knees; not, however, when simply passing before the altar.\u201D\
