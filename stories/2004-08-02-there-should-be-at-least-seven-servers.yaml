  text: '"There should be at least seven servers for Benediction--two acolytes, four
    torch-bearers, and a thurifer. All will be ready vested in soutane and surplice,
    wearing altar shoes, with torches lighted and thurible prepared, five minutes
    before the hour. They will arrange themselves in ranks just outside the priest''s
    sacristy. Whenever, during the time that the Blessed Sacrament is exposed, it
    is necessary to leave or enter the Sanctuary, a reverence is made on both knees;
    not, however, when simply passing before the altar." -- Bernard F Page SJ, A Practical
    Guide For Servers At Low Mass & Benediction'
