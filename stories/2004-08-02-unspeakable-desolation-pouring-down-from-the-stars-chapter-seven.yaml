  text: "THE NIGHT SKY WAS splattered with stars. I was halfway across a beetroot\
    \ field, swinging my arms and following my nose, when I remembered that I had\
    \ left my haversack in the cloakroom of the Spangles Reference Library. The journey\
    \ to the HQ from the owl sanctuary had taken three days, as far as I had been\
    \ able to tell. The special agent had mentioned something about a forty mile stretch:\
    \ but he was a crafty devil. For all I knew the HQ may have been just around the\
    \ corner.\nBut I seemed to be in open country, and the night was pitch black save\
    \ for the twinkling stars. A town like Spangles would surely be lit up at night\
    \ by festive lanterns: it was that sort of place. I had no choice but to continue\
    \ striding ahead. By morning, I thought, I should reach some sort of landmark:\
    \ a town or village, a crag or a promontory, a windmill, a tower or a tor.\nAs\
    \ I plunged through the darkness, I kept the image of the philatelist Plunkett\
    \ in the forefront of my brain. I knew where he lived, of course: I knew everything\
    \ about him, as I had been demonstrating to the Turquoise Badge Ten. Plunkett\
    \ Hall was a strangely proportioned brickish monstrosity, perched on a clifftop\
    \ on the wildest shores of the Soaking Wet Sea. Curious passers-by, who were few,\
    \ were warned by a sign bolted to the massive granite wall surrounding the landward\
    \ sides of the house that Trespassers Will Be Fed To The Vultures. The house had\
    \ few windows, and those few were tiny, mere narrow slits of smoke-blackened glass.\
    \ Ferocious, cloven-hooved beasts, their fur matted and rank, their fangs dripping\
    \ with gore, patrolled the grounds, howling and howling. Once a month, one of\
    \ the philatelist's eerie servants would issue forth from the house armed with\
    \ a flamethrower, and incinerate any poor sprig of greenery which had managed\
    \ to grow in the blasted wastelands of the garden. Plunkett himself was rumoured\
    \ never to have set foot outside the house since he had retired to it twenty years\
    \ before. How he passed his days, none knew: the handful of biographies I had\
    \ read all petered out with his arrival at the house. Plodding onward, I shuddered\
    \ at the thought that, once I had retrieved my haversack, my mission impelled\
    \ me towards that cursed place. I had no wish to provide dinner for a bale of\
    \ vultures, so I would need to think up a convincing excuse to enter Plunkett\
    \ Hall as a legitimate visitor.\nIf only Fig were with me now, I thought, and\
    \ as I did so I tripped over a clump of bracken and fell to the ground, jolting\
    \ my ribcage and spraining my wrist. The night seemed more suffocating than ever:\
    \ unspeakable desolation poured down from the stars. I sat down on a tuffet and\
    \ burst into tears.\nI do not know for how long I wept. I was engulfed by a nameless\
    \ and terrible grief. My body was wracked by great heaving sobs which emptied\
    \ my lungs and had me scrabbling in the earth as if trying to effect my own burial.\
    \ Hours and hours seemed to pass, but there was no glimmer of dawn. I imagined\
    \ myself marooned in an endless and illimitable night. At the very peak of my\
    \ misery, as I drew my head up to bay woe, woe and woe at the sky, I was startled\
    \ to see a figure in the distance, moving towards me. It was spectral and wraith-like,\
    \ shimmering with an uncanny glow. I stood up, exhausted but now alert, tingling\
    \ with wonderment. The spectre approached with inhuman speed, and within seconds\
    \ came to a halt inches from my face. I squinted at it through the last drops\
    \ of my tears. It looked something like a combination of Fig and Poxhaven: but\
    \ then it spoke, and it sounded like my dead headmaster, Monsignor Sinkpail.\n\
    \u201CHere is your satchel,\u201D it said, handing me my haversack. However unearthly\
    \ the apparition before me, there was no doubting the weight and solidity of the\
    \ haversack: I didn't remember it being so heavy. I rested it on the ground.\n\
    \u201CYour satchel is a heavy burden,\u201D said the spectre, \u201CI have carried\
    \ it many miles. I have brought it to you from its locker, out of the library,\
    \ past the baths, the chemist's shop, the Town Hall, the pigeon lofts and the\
    \ owl sanctuary, along Blister Lane, turning right at the duckpond, then up Pang\
    \ Hill until I reached the waterworks, where I struck off down Amnesiac Lane towards\
    \ the graveyard, hopped over three fences and headed west to Bodger's Spinney,\
    \ where I dipped my cup in the stream and rested awhile. Using my internal compass,\
    \ I then made my way to a mysterious village, where the dandelions are blue and\
    \ the air is thick with the stench of vinegar. I dithered in the square, and was\
    \ at a loss until I espied a little news-vendor's kiosk, where I was able to obtain\
    \ a gazetteer of the village and its hinterland, which I studied carefully until\
    \ sunset. I slept there, uncomfortably, on the plastic roof of the kiosk. When\
    \ morning came, consulting the gazetteer, I whisked myself along the towpath of\
    \ the canal, crossing it at Sawdust Bridge and following thereafter the course\
    \ of the Great Frightening River. I camped on the knoll. The remains of your sausage\
    \ gave me sustenance. There are many butterflies to be found there: I netted and\
    \ ate half a dozen of them. By now your satchel was weighing me down. I hared\
    \ on, past the fireworks factory and the dental institution, and found myself\
    \ in a thicket of nettles. I inched my way through it with the aid of my secateurs.\
    \ Then I caught the funicular railway up to the top of Pilgarlic Hill, and hurried\
    \ down the other side on foot, splashing through puddles, until I reached the\
    \ pig farmer's house. I hid in his orchard and snoozed, until the pig farmer set\
    \ his hounds on me: I was able to escape from them by spraying their snouts with\
    \ a concoction of bleach and aniseed, but not before they had bitten mouthfuls\
    \ of fabric from my spectral trousers. From there, I strode with giant steps across\
    \ fields of barley, turnips, bracken, furze and javelin weed, past an abandoned\
    \ quarry, and on through a knot of allotments, where again I rested, finding shelter\
    \ in a hut empty but for the broken and rusted remnants of a lawnmower, the skull\
    \ of a badger, and a tattered instruction manual. What the instructions were for,\
    \ I do not know: I cannot read. I dozed, begged a bottle of lemonade from an early-bird\
    \ allotmenteer, and trudged towards the west, skirting the Shabby lime-kilns and\
    \ the serried belvederes of Haemoglobin Towers, until, night crashing down again,\
    \ I hit upon this astonishingly large tract of beetroot fields, where at last\
    \ I have found you. My task is almost done. It remains for you to lodge what I\
    \ have just said in your brain, and for me to bid you farewell with the words\
    \ which, if you say them with sufficient conviction, will gain you entrance to\
    \ Plunkett Hall. You must knock at the gate, and wait, and wait, and when, at\
    \ last, one of Mr Plunkett's servants opens the little shutter three feet above\
    \ your head, and, in fearsome, gravelly tones, bids you state your business, you\
    \ must say: hello, I\u2019ve come about the tap. My deed is done. Farewell.\u201D\
    \nThe spectre did a little hop, and dissolved.\nWell! It might as well have given\
    \ me a map. Mentally following the journey it had described, I realised just where\
    \ I was. The world remained enwrapped in night, and I was once more alone, but\
    \ my spirits were lifted immensely. I had got my bearings: I was no more than\
    \ half an hour's walk from Plunkett Hall. I resolved, when dawn should break,\
    \ to head straight there, to say the given words, and, once inside, to play it,\
    \ as they say, by ear.\nFor the time being, squatting on the tuffet, I threw open\
    \ my haversack to inspect its contents. I was pleased to note that all the items\
    \ Scrimgeour had so carefully packed were undisturbed and still intact. I could\
    \ not account for the fact that they had been padded out with numerous grey sacks\
    \ filled with waterlogged sand, but I decided not to dizzy my poor brain by puzzling\
    \ over such inexplicable phenomena: I simply removed the sacks one by one, placing\
    \ them carefully to one side in the channels between the rows of blooming beetroot.\n\
    Before moving on to the next part of the story, it would probably be appropriate\
    \ for me to indulge in some speculation about the provenance of the spectre: but\
    \ I will not do so.\nChapter Eight \u2026"
