  text: "\u201CSometimes, with their bony limbs flung forth in gnarled unnatural gestures,\
    \ they remind me of frantic skeletons suddenly petrified in their dance of death.\
    \ They are frenzied, and unutterably tragic. They seem to move; yet they are so\
    \ dead. And I imagine their denuded tortured arms reaching toward unanswering\
    \ Heaven in an agony of protest against the fate that has gripped all nature.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Katherine Shortall, Where The Sabots Clatter Again"
