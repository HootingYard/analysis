  text: 'What is the best defence when your opponent tags the cicely courtneidges
    with baling? The received wisdom used to be that a shudder and mop could counter
    the threat, but this was blown apart during the Loopy Copse Tournament last month.
    Let''s take a look at the position.

    Klinkbotz : 4107K

    Blenkinsop : 558Q

    Toofle : 269J

    Blenkinsop clapped a jack hulbert with a pan before being rehoist by Klinkbotz''s
    clever smothering manoeuvre. A shifty burlap by Toofle followed. Now, had I been
    Blenkinsop, I would have cut some slack by buffeting Toofle''s tocker. Instead,
    she paid grist with a dubbin and held substandard thrum. Caking from Klinkbotz''s
    hinge made a shard, a second tag, and an astounding half courtneidge with muck,
    leaving another gap.

    Problem : Toofle to play. Cambodge or writhing? And why?

    Solution next week.'
