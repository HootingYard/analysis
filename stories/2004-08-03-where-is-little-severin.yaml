  text: 'Dear Hooting Yard : I am deeply worried about Little Severin, the Mystic
    Badger that the denizens of Hooting Yard have taken under their wing (24 June).
    As soon as he was promoted to the post of making regular predictions, he seems
    to have disappeared. I don''t want to appear suspicious, but you do have a habit
    of losing people--look at poor Mrs. Gubbins, who was forced into Tundism! I would
    feel very sad indeed if Little Severin has suffered a similar fate. Please can
    you let us know that he is all right, and what he thinks will happen to him? Yours
    concernedly, Poppy Nisbet

    Hmm. I must admit I had been hoping to draw a veil over this one. However, Ms
    Nisbet deserves a reply, and it may be that she has raised a question which other
    readers have puzzled over. First of all, though, I must object to the accusation
    that Mrs Gubbins was "forced" into Tundism. This is just not the case. The Tundists
    offered the old crone sanctuary when she was on the run from the cops. She accepted.
    She is content. Indeed she is drooling with happiness. The first tract from the
    Tundist Owl Library under her editorship will be issued soon.

    Now, as to Little Severin, I am afraid to say that we were misled by that epithet
    "the Mystic Badger". It rapidly became apparent that Little Severin''s scrubbling
    round in the undergrowth, rustling twigs, gobbling up grubs, and doing that thing
    with his paws, all of it was apparently standard badger behaviour without mystic
    significance whatsoever. Those who carped were proved correct. Little Severin
    was completely incapable of making any useful predictions about the future.

    I end, however, on a note of hope. You will note the use of the past tense in
    the preceding paragraph. Our tiny badger has been packed off to a top secret Eldritch
    Education Centre for Small Mammals, where he will be able to earn properly that
    title of Mystic. He still spends his days doing all those badger-like things mentioned
    above, but gets to wear mystic garb, as the picture below shows. Once he is fully
    conversant with various aspects of the magick arts, he shall return!
