  text: 'I quote--without comment, but with added italics--from an announcement by
    Nestle Rowntree that they are launching a new advertising campaign for the KitKat
    chocolate bar: "It reinforces KitKat''s ownership of key snacking occasions, and
    offers consumers a fresh reason to buy the brand for these occasions."'
