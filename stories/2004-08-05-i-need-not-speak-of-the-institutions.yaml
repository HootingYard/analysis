  text: "\u201CI need not speak of the institutions for the blind, the lame, the deaf\
    \ and the dumb, for the incurables, for the widow, the orphan, and the outcast;\
    \ or of the thousand-armed machinery that sends streaming down from the reservoir\
    \ the clear, bright, sparkling, God-given water that rushes through our aqueducts,\
    \ and dashes out of the hydrants, and tosses up in our fountains, and hisses in\
    \ our steam-engines, and showers out the conflagration, and sprinkles from the\
    \ baptismal font of our churches; and with silver note, and golden sparkle, and\
    \ crystalline chime, says to hundreds of thousands of our population, in the authentic\
    \ words of Him who made it, \u2018I WILL\u2014BE THOU CLEAN!\u2019\u201D \u2014\
    \ Rev T De Witt Talmadge, The Abominations Of Modern Society"
