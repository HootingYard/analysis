  text: '"I need not speak of the institutions for the blind, the lame, the deaf and
    the dumb, for the incurables, for the widow, the orphan, and the outcast; or of
    the thousand-armed machinery that sends streaming down from the reservoir the
    clear, bright, sparkling, God-given water that rushes through our aqueducts, and
    dashes out of the hydrants, and tosses up in our fountains, and hisses in our
    steam-engines, and showers out the conflagration, and sprinkles from the baptismal
    font of our churches; and with silver note, and golden sparkle, and crystalline
    chime, says to hundreds of thousands of our population, in the authentic words
    of Him who made it, ''I WILL--BE THOU CLEAN!''" -- Rev T De Witt Talmadge, The
    Abominations Of Modern Society'
