  text: 'It was a splendid Thursday morning. The squalls and drizzle were over. I
    sat in my space-age brunch module having a key snacking occasion, not unaware
    that the price of Brent crude had shot through the roof. I kept a couple of barrels
    in the cellar, under a tarpaulin, and decided to go and check that they had not
    been disturbed. Gulping down the last of my vitamin-enhanced celery-and-watercress
    health drink with added iron, I was about to unlatch the pod in which I stored
    all the house-keys when something appalling happened.

    Later that day, as I drove at unimaginable speed across the tundra, the sound
    of Thijs Van Leer''s Introspection 1 CD blaring out of the speakers, all thoughts
    of prog rock were forgotten when I had to swerve to avoid an obstacle which appeared
    suddenly in front of me. Such abrupt movements did not suit my turbopropulsion
    eight-wheeler, and I knew immediately that the suspension was wrecked. I brought
    the vehicle to a halt, mopped my brow, and looked back. What was that thing I
    had so nearly smashed into? It was the shape of a breakfast cereal packet, but
    much, much bigger, and it emitted a glow that sixth sense told me was dangerously
    radioactive. I flipped open my microcommunicator, adjusted the nozzles, and shouted
    into it. "Boloslaw!" I yelled, "You''d better get down here at once!"

    Next morning, in the lab, I watched as Boloslaw fiddled about with any number
    of complicated mechanical bittybobs. I was tired. "I''m going to take a nap,"
    I told my pneumonia-racked colleague, "Wake me up if anything happens." I trudged
    wearily through the corridors towards the sterile bunkbed sector. How did I get
    lost? I thought I knew this place as well as I knew my reflection in the shaving
    mirror, but I was wrong. Ten minutes after leaving the lab, I was completely incapable
    of recognising my surroundings. Exhaustion made me decisive. I slid open the next
    door I came to, entered the chamber, and found myself face to face with something
    indescribable.

    That evening we had a dinner party. Snetterton was talking about hedge fund acquisition
    analysis models in his entertaining way, but I had other things on my mind. Earlier,
    I had read an e-codex raising the spectre of hectic global mayhem, and I was determined
    to stop it. Excusing myself from the table by muttering something about a missing
    fork, I headed for the pantry and switched on the secret receiver. Ignoring the
    blue sparks and crackles from this antiquated device, I placed my ear against
    the node. At that very moment, a terrified weasel dashed across the room and sprang
    at me.

    That was Thursday and Friday. I was looking forward to the weekend more than ever.
