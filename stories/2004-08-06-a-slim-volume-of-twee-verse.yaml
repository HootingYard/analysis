  text: "It is quite a while since anything has been heard from the poet Gervase Beerpint,\
    \ author of Homage To Neurasthenia and Do You Know The Way To Sin, Jos\xE9?*,\
    \ so it is with something akin to breathless overexcitement that his publishers\
    \ announce a forthcoming volume, his first since the cataclysmic events of Bastardgate\
    \ engulfed John Major's Conservative administration of 1990 to 1997.\n\nProvocatively\
    \ entitled A Slim Volume Of Twee Verse, Beerpint's latest is a huge slab of a\
    \ book. Truman Capote said of Kerouac's On The Road that \u201Cit's not writing,\
    \ it's typing\u201D, and one feels that were Mr C still with us, he would make\
    \ the same waspish remark about the torrent of verbiage spewed across these pages.\
    \ It is difficult to know what to make of a work that steadfastly refuses to engage\
    \ the reader in any way. At times it reads like an ironmongery catalogue for upwards\
    \ of a hundred pages, then without warning the poet launches into his own (incompetent)\
    \ Tagalog translation of the Book of Isaiah. Some of the old standby Beerpint\
    \ motifs are here\u2014popinjays, choc ices, and dust\u2014but as a whole the\
    \ work is baffling, perhaps even rubbish.\nWe rang the poet to ask some pertinent\
    \ questions, but all that could be heard from his end of the line was this.\n\
