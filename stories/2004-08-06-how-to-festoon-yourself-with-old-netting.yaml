  text: "Serial Hooting Yard complainant Ruth Pastry writes : \u201CThe trouble with\
    \ your website, Mr Key, is that, jam-packed as it is with arcane learning, those\
    \ of us of a more practical bent are left short-changed. Apart from the occasional\
    \ recipe, I find little here that teaches me how to actually do anything. Sort\
    \ it out!\u201D\nWell then. Here, especially for Ms Pastry, is the first in a\
    \ series of How To\u2026 articles which have been written for us by the Barry\
    \ Bucknell de nos jours, Fatima Gilliblat.\nHere is a surefire way to festoon\
    \ yourself with old netting. First, buy a train ticket to the seaside, or more\
    \ precisely to a fishing port, the more Lovecraftian the better. Innsmouth would\
    \ be ideal, but anywhere faintly sinister and maritime will do. As soon as you\
    \ arrive, sidle insouciantly down to the quayside, looking out for grizzled old\
    \ fisherfolk. They may eye you with suspicion, but that is because you are a landlubber\
    \ unfamiliar with the lore of the sea. Strike up a conversation. Ask questions\
    \ about their \u201Ccatch\u201D. At some point, while sucking on his clay pipe\
    \ or picking the bones of sprats out of his matted hair, your interlocutor will\
    \ mention his fishing net. This is your chance! Ask to see his net. Squelch across\
    \ the sands with him when the tide is out, past the algae-smeared buoys and the\
    \ rotting tugboats, and when you come to the old frayed net, slip the sea dog\
    \ a fiver. He will trudge off to buy lugworms or maggots with this unexpected\
    \ booty, and while he is gone, you can wrap yourself up in the net. Be sure to\
    \ disentangle yourself and head back to the jetty before the tide comes in, or\
    \ you will meet a watery doom, and miss the train home."
