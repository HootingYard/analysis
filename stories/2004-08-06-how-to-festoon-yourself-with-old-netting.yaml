    website, Mr Key, is that, jam-packed as it is with arcane learning, those of us
    of a more practical bent are left short-changed. Apart from the occasional recipe,
    I find little here that teaches me how to actually do anything. Sort it out!"

    Well then. Here, especially for Ms Pastry, is the first in a series of How To...
    articles which have been written for us by the Barry Bucknell de nos jours, Fatima
    Gilliblat.

    Here is a surefire way to festoon yourself with old netting. First, buy a train
    ticket to the seaside, or more precisely to a fishing port, the more Lovecraftian
    the better. Innsmouth would be ideal, but anywhere faintly sinister and maritime
    will do. As soon as you arrive, sidle insouciantly down to the quayside, looking
    out for grizzled old fisherfolk. They may eye you with suspicion, but that is
    because you are a landlubber unfamiliar with the lore of the sea. Strike up a
    conversation. Ask questions about their "catch". At some point, while sucking
    on his clay pipe or picking the bones of sprats out of his matted hair, your interlocutor
    will mention his fishing net. This is your chance! Ask to see his net. Squelch
    across the sands with him when the tide is out, past the algae-smeared buoys and
    the rotting tugboats, and when you come to the old frayed net, slip the sea dog
    a fiver. He will trudge off to buy lugworms or maggots with this unexpected booty,
    and while he is gone, you can wrap yourself up in the net. Be sure to disentangle
    yourself and head back to the jetty before the tide comes in, or you will meet
    a watery doom, and miss the train home.'
