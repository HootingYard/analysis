  text: "I am suffering from a spiritual malaise. I am soul sick. I have not eaten\
    \ any breakfast. I need to darn a hole in the sleeve of my jumper, but I have\
    \ no further wool that matches. I feel inconsequential and abandoned and remote.\
    \ My cheeks blush furiously with an embarrassment born of pity. Every last pencil\
    \ I have is blunt. I am being driven crackers by my landlord's drooling hound.\
    \ My senses are atrophied, like a muscle unexercised. Pots and pans are strewn\
    \ haphazardly in my kitchen. My legs have given way. I have an evil taste in my\
    \ mouth. Hope is something for other people, not for me. My teapot is cracked\
    \ and the cosy is stained and threadbare. Nervous spasms contort my features.\
    \ I keep to the shadows if I have to move in the street. Do you hear that sound?\
    \ It is my groan of despair. I have extinguished all the lanterns and I know in\
    \ my cold, base heart that they will never be lit again. The air is heavy with\
    \ menace and all I can hear is the screaming of desolation and ruin. Insects swarm\
    \ about my face but I cannot summon the energy to swat them away. I have sprained\
    \ my ankle. Dust lies everywhere, ashes and dust. Desire, ah, desire for me is\
    \ not even a memory. Feral cats hiss at me and extend their claws. Even my poultry\
    \ is contaminated. All sense of urgency is lost and yet I cannot relax. My head\
    \ is swimming. My shoes let in rainwater and my socks are soaking wet. The washbasin\
    \ is cracked. The taps no longer work. Even the most innocent and cherubic children\
    \ spit at me. I gag on my own wretchedness. And then with a mighty effort, I pull\
    \ myself up, and I trudge across Bulgaria like a whipped cur, and I go the Central\
    \ Post Office building in Plovdiv, and I look at Georgi Bozhilov's mural. Yes,\
    \ that Georgi Bozhilov, whose nickname was Slona, or Elephant, a member of the\
    \ so-called Plovdiv Fivesome. I gaze at the post office mural and somehow I am\
    \ pulled back from the brink, and I embrace life again, wholeheartedly, blissfully.\
    \ Here\u2026 here is a map of the centre of Plovdiv, to help you find your way,\
    \ as I found mine!\n"
