  text: '"Canidia appears first, the locks of her dishevelled hair twined round with
    venomous and deadly serpents, ordering the wild fig-tree and the funereal cypress
    to be rooted up from the sepulchres on which they grew, and these, together with
    the egg of a toad smeared with blood, the plumage of the screech-owl, various
    herbs brought from Thessaly and Georgia, and bones torn from the jaws of a famished
    dog, to be burned in flames fed with perfumes from Colchis." -- William Godwin,
    Lives Of The Necromancers, Or: An Account Of The Most Eminent Persons In Successive
    Ages, Who Have Claimed For Themselves, Or To Whom Has Been Imputed By Others,
    The Exercise Of Magical Power'
