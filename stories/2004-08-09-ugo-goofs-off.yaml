  text: "Ugo lived in Plovdiv. In the fog, Ugo goofed off. \u201CThere you go, Ugo,\
    \ goofing off again,\u201D said Ugo's ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo.\
    \ He got it on his boots. \u201CMa, I've got goo on my boots,\u201D said Ugo.\
    \ Ugo's ma gave him a rag to wipe the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws.\
    \ Gewgaws and rags. Ugo's ma was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on\
    \ his boots, she opened the drawer of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for\
    \ a rag rather than a gewgaw, for if she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn't get the\
    \ goo off his boots, but with a rag he would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing\
    \ off and wiped the goo off his boots with a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.\nSource\
    \ : Folk Tales Of Plovdiv collected by O. Pod. There is a different version of\
    \ this age-old story set not in Plovdiv but in Totnes."
