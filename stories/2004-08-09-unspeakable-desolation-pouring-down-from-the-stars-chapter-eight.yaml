  text: "\u201CHELLO!\u201D I CALLED \u201CI\u2019VE come about the tap!\u201D\nAfter\
    \ waiting for forty five minutes, I was admitted to the gloomy vestibule of Plunkett\
    \ Hall. The servant who ushered me in was a tall, blond, windswept lad of about\
    \ my age. He seemed completely out of place in the tenebrous interior, dressed\
    \ as he was in a T-shirt and shorts, carrying what I imagined to be a surf-board\
    \ under his arm. His voice, too, was anomalous: not the gravelly croak foretold\
    \ by my spectre, but a cheery, beach-bum boom, all bonhomie and brag. I have always\
    \ hated people like that: at school I had devoted much of my time to plotting\
    \ fantastic calamities for them, none of which I was ever able to realise.\n\u201C\
    Sit yourself down there, sport,\u201D yelled the lad, pointing to a wooden stool\
    \ frantic with carvings of imps, basilisks, dragons and devils, \u201CI\u2019\
    ll get someone to see to you right away.\u201D\nWith that, he pranced off in his\
    \ flip-flops. I sat down and peered through the gloom, trying to take cognizance\
    \ of my surroundings. The walls of the vestibule were hung with grim and ancient\
    \ oil-paintings, their gilt frames dulled by smoke and soot. Huge dark wooden\
    \ furnishings, each as ornately carved as the stool on which I sat, cluttered\
    \ the place. The air was thick and stifling. Underfoot, the flagstones were partially\
    \ hidden by frayed and tattered rugs, on which a large quantity of birdseed had\
    \ been spilled. Next to the bench stood a three-legged table which had been varnished\
    \ with shellac, upon which was a tray of buttons. Idly, I picked one up. At that\
    \ instant, a door crashed open and a towering brute stomped towards me, all fangs\
    \ and slaver. I dropped the button on the floor.\n\u201CCur! Wretch!\u201D cried\
    \ the brute, swiping at me wildly with his great fists, \u201CThose are the Buttons\
    \ of Beb! Tikes like you durst not touch them! Scum!\u201D\nHe finished knocking\
    \ me half-senseless, then took from his pocket a duster, and wiped the button\
    \ with surprising daintiness. Replacing it on the tray, he spat at me and charged\
    \ out of the room as suddenly as he had come. As I rubbed my head, the athletic\
    \ young man reappeared.\n\u201CCrikey!\u201D he shouted\u2014people like him always\
    \ shout\u2014\u201DYou've had a scrap and a half! Been mucking about with the\
    \ buttons, I bet.\u201D\nI nodded.\n\u201CI should have warned you,\u201D he continued,\
    \ \u201CBut it completely slipped my mind. Scatterbrained or what?\u201D, and\
    \ he let loose ten seconds of the jolliest and most irritating laughter I have\
    \ ever heard. \u201CAnyway, never mind. Everyone else seems to be busy at the\
    \ moment, so I\u2019ll take you to the tap myself. Come on!\u201D\nI followed\
    \ the youth through a series of rooms which I cannot be bothered to describe.\
    \ He was still carrying his board. I made a few churlish efforts at joining in\
    \ with his incessant banter, but my mind was concentrating on a plan of action.\
    \ Yet again, I found myself imagining what Fig would have done in my place.\n\
    We got to the room wherein lurked the tap I was presumably meant to fix. It was\
    \ a huge iron spigot, standing alone in the centre of what I was told was an abandoned\
    \ indoor hockey pitch.\n\u201COK?\u201D yelled the blond boy, \u201CYou do your\
    \ stuff. I\u2019ll be back in a jiffy.\u201D\n\u201CWait,\u201D I said, scheming,\
    \ \u201CThere's paperwork, you know.\u201D\nI made a great show of rummaging in\
    \ my haversack for non-existent documentation, uttered a few oaths, and took out\
    \ my notebook and biro.\n\u201CGreat heavens to Betsy,\u201D I said, \u201CI seem\
    \ to have mislaid the forms. Ah, well. Luckily I\u2019ve done so many of these\
    \ jobs I can remember all the questions. I\u2019ll just note the answers down\
    \ in my pad and fill in the forms when I get back to the depot.\u201D\nI was overacting\
    \ a bit, but the boy seemed convinced.\n\u201CFire away, old bean!\u201D he shouted,\
    \ leaning his board against the wall.\n\u201CWho is the owner of the property?\u201D\
    \ I asked.\n\u201CThe tap or the house?\u201D he replied. He was either stupid\
    \ or sly: probably the former, but I decided to be careful.\n\u201CAre they not\
    \ one and the same?\u201D\n\u201COh, I suppose they are,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    The ownership of Plunkett Hall is a bit of a mystery, though. I think the lease\
    \ is held by the Hooting Yard Bell-Ringing Society, but I\u2019d have to check.\u201D\
    \nThis was going to be more difficult than I thought. I scribbled down what he\
    \ had said and, improvising, pretended to paraphrase question number two.\n\u201C\
    Names of all those resident in the property.\u201D\n\u201CPhew!\u201D he phewed,\
    \ \u201CNow I can't help you there. All of them?\u201D\n\u201CThe lot,\u201D I\
    \ insisted.\n\u201CI only know some of them, you see. We sort of do shifts. I\u2019\
    m here for the first half of the month, but then someone else takes over. There's\
    \ so many comings and goings. Mr Slop and Mr Cravat do alternate weeks. Mrs Skim\
    \ comes in every Thursday. The Flue brothers each do six months on and six months\
    \ off. It's incredibly complicated.\u201D\nI scribbled rubbish in my notebook,\
    \ playing for time.\n\u201CWhat I need for the form,\u201D I said slowly, trying\
    \ to think of something, \u201CIs a list of the people resident in the property\
    \ at the time of the repair. On the day of the repair.\u201D He didn't say a word.\n\
    \u201CThe repair of the tap,\u201D I added, desperately.\n\u201COh, right,\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CLet me think. There's me, of course, and Mr Slop, and Ignacio\
    \ Housemartin, the gardener, and two people whose names I don't know, who work\
    \ in the attic, and Pansy Crague, and the Bingle family\u2026\u201D\nHe carried\
    \ on like this for longer than I could bear. Not once did he mention my quarry,\
    \ Istvan Plunkett. I interrupted him.\n\u201CWho is the head of this confounded\
    \ household?\u201D\nHe looked blank, but some sort of activity was taking place\
    \ inside his head.\n\u201COh, you must mean the old geezer with the wooden leg!\u201D\
    \ he yelled, eventually, \u201CThe nurse says he's too ill to come out of his\
    \ room. I\u2019ve never even seen him myself, but you hear all sorts of strange\
    \ stories\u2026\u201D\nI pondered whether or not to let the youth continue with\
    \ his prattle, and decided against it.\n\u201CI have to have his signature,\u201D\
    \ I invented brilliantly, \u201CI\u2019m not allowed to do the job without his\
    \ written permission.\u201D\nIt was the boy's turn to ponder, but I had bureaucracy\u2014\
    albeit fictional\u2014on my side. After some blather, he caved in, and we left\
    \ the tap-room and spent half an hour traipsing through various dank corridors\
    \ until we fetched up outside a door marked The Master's Chambers. I felt triumphant.\
    \ Over half a century ago, the sainted Mister Patch had had his stamp collection\
    \ stolen, and now I had run to earth the man who, I was convinced, held the album\
    \ in his guilty paws. The youth rapped on the door and fled, muttering that he\
    \ would leave me in the hands of the nurse. A minute passed. I rapped on the door\
    \ myself. It was opened at once, and I found myself face to face with the great\
    \ film actress Vilma Banky. Of course, it wasn't really that siren of the silver\
    \ screen, all kitted out as a house-nurse, but the resemblance was astonishing.\n\
    \u201CYes?\u201D, she drawled, detaching a cheroot from her lips.\n\u201CEr,\u201D\
    \ I managed, \u201CI\u2019ve come about the tap. I need Mr Plunkett's signature.\u201D\
    \n\u201CCome on in,\u201D she rustled. I edged past her into a room sumptuous\
    \ with wall-hangings, decorative fire-screens, and plush soft furnishings. In\
    \ the middle of it all was a business-like desk, at which the nurse now sat down.\
    \ Playfully, she flicked the ash from her cheroot into an ashtray, opened a drawer\
    \ in the desk, and took out a small dictaphone.\n\u201CDon't perturb yourself,\u201D\
    \ she breathed, \u201CI always tape my conversations here. One has to be careful.\u201D\
    \n\u201CUm,\u201D I replied.\n\u201CMister who did you say?\u201D she asked, switching\
    \ on the little machine, which hummed gently.\n\u201CMr Plunkett,\u201D I repeated.\n\
    \u201CWould that be Istvan Plunkett, the noted philatelist?\u201D\n\u201CYes,\
    \ it would.\u201D\n\u201CBe kind enough to speak up a bit,\u201D she said, \u201C\
    You're not registering on the mike.\u201D\n\u201COh. Yes. It would.\u201D I said\
    \ loudly, but not loudly enough: she got me to repeat it a second time.\n\u201C\
    That's fine,\u201D she said. \u201CNow let me understand you. You've come here\
    \ to get Istvan Plunkett's signature, is that right?\u201D\nWhat was it with the\
    \ people in this house? The youth had struck me as something of a dunderpate,\
    \ but if anything he was quicker on the uptake than the nurse. But I have always\
    \ prided myself on my almost inhuman patience.\n\u201CYes,\u201D I said, then,\
    \ remembering to raise my voice, explained, \u201CI have come here to mend the\
    \ tap. I cannot proceed without Mr Plunkett's signature. I have to witness him\
    \ signing the paper.\u201D\n\u201CI see,\u201D she replied, \u201CAnd what tap\
    \ would that be?\u201D\nIf, reader, you are losing patience at this point, imagine\
    \ how I felt. I think it best to pass over the next ten minutes, which consisted\
    \ of an unbelievably tedious little dialogue, of interest to no one except perhaps\
    \ a plumbing fanatic. Eventually, I was rescued from death by boredom when the\
    \ dictaphone tape ran out.\n\u201CExcuse me,\u201D said the nurse, \u201CI shall\
    \ have to fetch another tape.\u201D\n\u201CLook,\u201D I said, \u201CLook look\
    \ look. Surely I can just be shown to Mr Plunkett and he can sign my paper and\
    \ I\u2019ll be on my way?\u201D\nShe was already heading for the door, but stopped,\
    \ and turned towards me.\n\u201CYou must be under a misapprehension,\u201D she\
    \ said, gazing at me with her houri eyes, \u201CThere is no Mr Plunkett in this\
    \ house.\u201D\nWell, stap my chives! I was, and this is not an understatement,\
    \ flabbergasted. Please forgive another hiatus in the narrative, but you would\
    \ be ill-rewarded by a detailed description of me huffing and spluttering, and\
    \ the nurse explaining calmly that the noted philatelist Istvan Plunkett had died\
    \ in his bath seventeen years ago, and that the house which bore his name was\
    \ now rented by the elderly, ailing, and wooden-legged ex-president of the Hooting\
    \ Yard Bell-Ringing Society, Rudyard Splint, who was languishing in what promised\
    \ to be his death-bed in an adjacent room, stuffed up to the eyeballs with tablets,\
    \ infusions and pills.\nWhen I had calmed down, I realised that I needed time\
    \ to think. The nurse was most solicitous, lying me down on one of the room's\
    \ many sofas and handing me a bone-china mug and a decanter of 1899 vintage Feisty\
    \ Pillager.\n\u201CYou just rest your little head,\u201D she purred, and was gone.\n\
    I said I needed time to think, but first I decided to get horribly drunk. I drained\
    \ the decanter in minutes, and soon discovered further supplies of hooch in a\
    \ corner cabinet. I picked out a bottle of Gormless Wastrel, sucked on that for\
    \ a while, and eventually found oblivion with a hefty flagon of Mahout's Dropsy,\
    \ which was hidden behind the dressing-table.\nChapter Nine \u2026"
