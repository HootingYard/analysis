  text: Are you ready for a brand new beat? Summer's here, the time is right for dancing
    in the street. Ah, but you say you are not ready. You complain of indigestion,
    because last night you gorged yourself on a surfeit of lampreys washed down with
    six pints of goat's milk. It was Parsley's name-day celebration in the cavernous
    barn, and there was much carousing. You danced then, you protest, petulantly,
    and now all you want to do is lie abed groaning to yourself, perhaps sipping from
    a glass of invigorating salts. Leave me be, you whimper, leave me be. You think
    I am ignorant of the fact that Parsley is a cow, and that I find name-day celebrations
    for barnyard animals more than a little foolish. So up you get, the helicopter
    is waiting, and the pilot is impatient. He is in a foul mood because on this bright
    summer morning he has had a traumatic laundry incident, as can happen to any of
    us. It is high time you stirred from your bed, whether or not your belly feels
    like a nest of vipers, for there is a brand new beat, and we must fly away to
    that shrivelled and damp city beyond the mountains, and go dancing in the street.
    I am not being unkind. Although it is your job to check the manifest, I have already
    done so. I rose at four in the morning to make sure the box of flags was properly
    packed. Do not give me that pitiful look as I toss your cap and bells on to your
    blanket and tell you to get ready at once. I will brook no further nonsense. Let
    us go then, you and I, and commune with Terpsichore in that far city, where our
    'copter is due to land in the car park of the glue factory, where I shall play
    tunes on my crumhorn, and you shall cavort and reel and dance and dance and dance.
