  text: "\u201CThe novice, in solitude and darkness, day after day and night after\
    \ night, ponders images of perdition and despair. He is taught to hear, in imagination,\
    \ the howlings of the damned, to see their convulsive agonies, to feel the flames\
    \ that burn without consuming, to smell the corruption of the tomb and the fumes\
    \ of the infernal pit. He must picture to himself an array of adverse armies,\
    \ one commanded by Satan on the plains of Babylon, one encamped under Christ about\
    \ the walls of Jerusalem; and the perturbed mind, humbled by long contemplation\
    \ of its own vileness, is ordered to enroll itself under one or the other banner.\u201D\
