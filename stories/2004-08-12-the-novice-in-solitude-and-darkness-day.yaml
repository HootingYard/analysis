  text: '"The novice, in solitude and darkness, day after day and night after night,
    ponders images of perdition and despair. He is taught to hear, in imagination,
    the howlings of the damned, to see their convulsive agonies, to feel the flames
    that burn without consuming, to smell the corruption of the tomb and the fumes
    of the infernal pit. He must picture to himself an array of adverse armies, one
    commanded by Satan on the plains of Babylon, one encamped under Christ about the
    walls of Jerusalem; and the perturbed mind, humbled by long contemplation of its
    own vileness, is ordered to enroll itself under one or the other banner." -- Francis
    Parkman, The Jesuits In North America In The Seventeenth Century'
