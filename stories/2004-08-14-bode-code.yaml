  text: "One of the more outlandish episodes in Dobson's life was the Bode Code affair.\
    \ The out of print pamphleteer was facing utter penury, as usual, and hatched\
    \ a particularly ill-starred money-making scheme. He had been reading the ravings\
    \ of various Revelations-obsessed fundamentalist Christians, and was struck by\
    \ their argument that the Number of the Beast, 666, was somehow \u201Chidden\u201D\
    \ in all bar codes. Quoting Revelations 13:16\u2014He also forced everyone, small\
    \ and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in his right hand\
    \ or in his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark,\
    \ which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom.\
    \ If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is\
    \ man's number. His number is 666.\u2014the conspiracy theorists demonstrated\
    \ that the number appears in all UPC/EAN-13 barcode formats, whatever that might\
    \ mean.\nDobson decided that if he could devise a new system, he might be able\
    \ to market it to paranoid delusional Christians seeking to establish a separatist\
    \ worldwide trading network. He spent months working on what he called his Bode\
    \ Code, named after the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode, the man who gave\
    \ the planet Uranus its name. Dobson's system was abstruse, weird, unfathomably\
    \ complex, and never understood completely by anyone except its inventor. We know\
    \ that it was based on the twenty satellites of Uranus, that it had no negative\
    \ associations for the God-fearing, and that when he attempted to promote his\
    \ system to a reclusive American billionaire fundamentalist, Dobson was chased\
    \ off his property by slavering, yelping dogs.\nDobson himself was not a religious\
    \ man, nor even a remotely pious one, and he soon abandoned Bode Code and found\
    \ something else to occupy his magpie mind\u2014something to do with the manufacture\
    \ of swiss rolls, if I am not mistaken.\n\nLeft : a conventional barcode, wherein\
    \ lurks the Number of the Beast, apparently. Right: Dobson's prototype Bode Code\
    \ Allocation Machine"
