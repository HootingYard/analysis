  text: '"The ringing in my ears is the ringing of my fleshly stars ''toned all in
    Time''. I have commenced an anthology of high imaginings more worthy than a book
    of essays of that title I have loved and desired to use for years--Flame and Dew.
    If rightly done, it may do poetry one of the greatest of services by assisting
    it to praise Beauty on many lips in naked Light. I wish to consecrate my work
    on it to that end. Today I have been influenced by Frederick Tennyson, Traherne,
    and Patmore. In agony lies the highest music. The key is struck by circumstance,
    Time''s organist, and the stars tremble with music. For the full thundering silence
    of Absolute Beauty a Divine Agony was necessary, so that all Heaven and its choirs
    and Hell trembled in the majesty of this stricken Doom." -- Arthur Middleton,
