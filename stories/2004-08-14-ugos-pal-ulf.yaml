  text: "In Plovdiv, Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. \u201CLook at my\
    \ bubo, Ugo,\u201D said Ulf. \u201COooh!\u201D said Ugo when he saw the bubo.\
    \ Ugo had the flu. His ma made him a tincture for his flu but there was not much\
    \ she could do about Ulf's bubo. In the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in\
    \ a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo's ma brought food for Ulf. \u201CHave some pancakes,\
    \ Ulf,\u201D said Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake. \u201CFar be it from me to poo-poo\
    \ you, Ulf,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201CBut you should put the pancake on your\
    \ bubo, like a poultice.\u201D \u201COh,\u201D said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon\
    \ his bubo was gone. But Ugo still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop.\
    \ She could cure the plague but not the flu, and did not know what else she could\
    \ do. For the time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv."
