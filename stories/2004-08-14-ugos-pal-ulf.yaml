  text: In Plovdiv, Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. "Look at my bubo,
    Ugo," said Ulf. "Oooh!" said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu. His ma
    made him a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about Ulf's
    bubo. In the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo's
    ma brought food for Ulf. "Have some pancakes, Ulf," said Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake.
    "Far be it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf," said Ugo's ma, "But you should put the
    pancake on your bubo, like a poultice." "Oh," said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon
    his bubo was gone. But Ugo still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop.
    She could cure the plague but not the flu, and did not know what else she could
    do. For the time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.
