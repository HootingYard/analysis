  text: "Hollywood has familiarised us with swarms of killer bees, but the subject\
    \ of homicidal beekeepers is one which has been sadly neglected. Max D\xE9charn\xE9\
    \ has brought to my attention a rare mention of a murderous apiarist in the print\
    \ media. Reporting on the convulsive reaction to drug-fuelled athletes in Greece,\
    \ yesterday's Observer reported:\nKederis may now retire rather than fight disciplinary\
    \ proceedings which look inevitable. Until last Thursday, he was Greece's most\
    \ popular man. Now he, and Thanou, are seen as traitors. Greeks are united in\
    \ contempt for the pair bringing such shame on their country at an event they\
    \ hoped would mark its triumphant emergence as a modern European country. \u2018\
    They should be strung up,\u2019 said Litsa Sarantou, a beekeeper. \u2018No,\u2019\
    \ added retired bank employee Nassos Kafezopoulos. \u2018They should be shot.\u2019\
    \nMax does not say that he has put aside all his current projects in order to\
    \ write an opportunistic potboiler in which fearful Hellenic sprinters are pursued\
    \ by a vigilante beekeeper armed with a rope and a noose, but I am sure he is\
    \ just hiding his light under a bushel."
