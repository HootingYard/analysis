  text: 'Hollywood has familiarised us with swarms of killer bees, but the subject
    of homicidal beekeepers is one which has been sadly neglected. Max Decharne has
    brought to my attention a rare mention of a murderous apiarist in the print media.
    Reporting on the convulsive reaction to drug-fuelled athletes in Greece, yesterday''s
    Observer reported:

    Kederis may now retire rather than fight disciplinary proceedings which look inevitable.
    Until last Thursday, he was Greece''s most popular man. Now he, and Thanou, are
    seen as traitors. Greeks are united in contempt for the pair bringing such shame
    on their country at an event they hoped would mark its triumphant emergence as
    a modern European country. ''They should be strung up,'' said Litsa Sarantou,
    a beekeeper. ''No,'' added retired bank employee Nassos Kafezopoulos. ''They should
    be shot.''

    Max does not say that he has put aside all his current projects in order to write
    an opportunistic potboiler in which fearful Hellenic sprinters are pursued by
    a vigilante beekeeper armed with a rope and a noose, but I am sure he is just
    hiding his light under a bushel.'
