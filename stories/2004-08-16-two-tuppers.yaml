  text: "\nMartin Tupper (left), the Victorian moralist and poetaster referred to\
    \ in the item above, ought not be confused with Alf Tupper (right), the \u201C\
    tough of the track\u201D. Context will usually allow you to ascertain which Tupper\
    \ is the subject of discussion, but if in doubt you can always check back with\
    \ this handy pictorial guide.\nThe above item was sponsored by the Hooting Yard\
    \ Foundation's \u201CTell Your Tuppers Apart\u201D programme, an ongoing multimedia\
    \ project funded by shadowy Paraguayan gangsters."
