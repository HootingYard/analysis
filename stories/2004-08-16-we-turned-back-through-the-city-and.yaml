  text: "\u201CWe turned back through the city, and walked along watching the zopilotes\
    \ with their bald heads and foul dingy-black plumage. They were sitting in compact\
    \ rows on parapets of houses and churches, and seemed specially to affect the\
    \ cross of the cathedral, where they perched, two on each arm, and some on the\
    \ top. When some offal was thrown into the streets, they came down leisurely upon\
    \ it, one after another; their appearance and deportment reminding us of the undertaker's\
    \ men in England coming down from the hearse at the public-house door, when the\
    \ funeral is over.\u201D \u2014 Edward Burnett Tylor, Anahuac"
