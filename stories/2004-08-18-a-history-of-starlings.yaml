  text: 'A third of the world''s starling population lives in North America. The fact
    that possibly over a billion starlings roam the skies is due to one man, a rich
    New York drug manufacturer named Eugene Schieffelin, who in 1890 released eighty
    imported starlings in Central Park as part of his thoroughly sensible plan to
    introduce to the United States all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare.
    Those who do not love starlings see them as pests, and indeed it is not unknown
    for a hungry flock to devour twenty tons of potatoes, spread histoplasmosis, and
    make life difficult for bluebirds and woodpeckers. Attempts to reduce or scare
    off pesky starlings have included the use of artificial owls, radio broadcasts
    of the starlings'' alarm call, Roman candles, and a mass publicity drive to encourage
    people to eat starling pie (with recipes).


    This is what a starling looks like (side view). Best when not cooked in a pie.'
