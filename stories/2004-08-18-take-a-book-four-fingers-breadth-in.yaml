  text: '"Take a book four fingers breadth in bigness, or bigger if you will: write
    on the first leaf with your impregnation of saturn, or else put a paper that you
    have writ upon between the leaves; turn to t''other side of the Book, and having
    observed as near as may be the opposite place to your writing, rub the last leaf
    of the book with cotton dipt in liquor made of quicklime and orpin, nay and leave
    the cotton on the place clap a folded paper presently upon it, and shutting the
    book quickly, strike upon it with your hand four or five good strokes; then turn
    the book, and clap it into a press for half a quarter of an hour; take it out
    and open it, you''ll find the place appear black, where you had writ with the
    invisible ink. The same thing might be done through a wall, if you could provide
    something to lay on both sides, that might hinder the evaporation of the spirits."
