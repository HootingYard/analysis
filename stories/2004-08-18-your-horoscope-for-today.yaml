  text: 'Here at Hooting Yard, our horoscopes are based on the so-called Blodgett
    Astrological System of six, rather than twelve, signs. Over many years, forecasts
    made under this system have proved over eight hundred and forty-eight times more
    reliable than all that Pisces and Aquarius nonsense! You can work out which sign
    you are by referring to the online guide at www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/humanfate.html
    (site under construction).

    Fruitbat. Try to remember that you are lactose-intolerant. The hours before twilight
    will be significant for your pet stoat. Throw away that tub of swarfega.

    Mayonnaise. It is time to dig out your copy of Gordon "Sting" Sumner''s profound
    I Hope The Russians Love Their Children Too and play it again after all these
    years. You may overhear the phrase "going postal" more than once this afternoon.
    Pay special attention to patches of bracken.

    Coathanger. Your recurrent nightmares about an albino hen will finally make sense.
    Don''t go near any buildings, large or small.

    Slot. At last your destiny will begin to unfold, probably as you take a stroll
    along the towpath of the old canal. Vengeful thoughts will assail your brain,
    but you should ignore them, and devote your energies to making jam. A hollyhock
    may have special meaning for your kith and kin.

    Tarboosh. O what can ail thee, horoscope reader, alone and palely loitering? Make
    sure you treat yourself to an electric bath and a session in a sensory deprivation
    tank. The Bale of Gas in your House of Stupidity has incalculable effects. You
    will stand on the steps of the Insane Asylum, and hundreds of men and women will
    stand below you, with their upturned faces. Among them will be old men crushed
    by sorrow, and old men ruined by vice; aged women with faces that seemed to plead
    for pity, women that make you shrink from their unwomanly gaze; lion-like young
    men, made for heroes but caught in the devil''s trap and changed into beasts;
    and boys whose looks show that sin has already stamped them with its foul insignia,
    and burned into their souls the shame which is to be one of the elements of its
    eternal punishment. A less impressible person than you would feel moved at the
    sight of that throng of bruised and broken creatures. A hymn will be read, and
    when the preachers strike up an old tune, voice after voice will join in the melody
    until it swells into a mighty volume of sacred song. You will notice that the
    faces of many are wet with tears, and there will be an indescribable pathos in
    their voices. The pitying God, amid the rapturous hallelujahs of the heavenly
    hosts, shall bend to listen to the music of these broken harps.

    Nixon. Vile dribbling goblins covered in boils will make life difficult today.'
