  text: 'Ah, the Man of Bandages was born in Ghent at the turn of the last century.
    His parents were impoverished but elegant. His mother had wasted her youth wandering
    around northern Canada looking for reindeer. His father was indecisive and crumpled,
    forever carrying out experiments to cross the potato with the moorhen, and failing.
    When the Man of Bandages was four years old, mama and papa, clutched in a passionate
    embrace beneath a gnarled yew, were struck by lightning and perished. The Man
    of Bandages spent the remainder of his childhood ferried between relatives in
    Europe and South America. At some point during these years, he gradually became
    aware of the first stirrings of his remarkable destiny.

    Little else is known of the Man of Bandages until he surfaces in Totnes in 1922,
    sporting an unconvincing walrus moustache. A snapshot taken by Blothead of Winnipeg
    has been published the world over. The Man of Bandages can be seen loitering outside
    the post office, pallid and skeletal. In his left hand he is holding an iron hammer.
    He appears to be whistling. His hair is matted. Is it, as Duvalier has argued,
    a toupee made of wool? His clothing is cheap but serviceable. Even at this early
    stage, a frayed length of bandage can be seen dangling from the breast pocket
    of his jacket. Conspicuous by its absence from the photograph is his bicycle,
    which we know he had acquired by this time. Without it, the Man of Bandages is
    somehow incomplete, not quite the figure of legend he would later become.

    Marooned on a raft in the middle of a very cold ocean, the Man of Bandages chewed
    a piece of coal and pondered his existence. The sky was grey, the rain poured
    down, and the Man of Bandages would almost certainly have frozen to death were
    he not wearing his home-made blubbery anorak. Later, of course, the garment was
    put on display in the museum at Pointy Town. But back then, the preposterous anorak
    with its straps, zips, chutes, pockets, twanging hoops, hinges, spindles and other
    festoonments kept the Man of Bandages alive. For eight months he drifted on the
    high seas, out of reach of the most tenacious police officer, plotting his future.
    This period of his life was the subject of a book by Q V Partridge, filmed in
    1958 as Raft Of Hell, with Tad Brick as our hero. Brick died in mysterious circumstances
    the following year. He was found splayed on a lawn somewhere or other, a carton
    of buttermilk upended and spilled on his pantaloons.

    The Man of Bandages set out for the Antarctic. He took a map, a compass, and a
    bag of water with which to dab at his forehead. He was deluded but indefatigable.
    At the coast, he built an improvised tub and had a long soak in hot water scented
    with cotoneaster, persimmon and henbane. He flung what coinage he still carried
    into the sea, muttering, muttering. He was headed south, smoking heavily, now
    almost covered in bandages from the neck down. He did not sleep at nights. Glazed
    and thinning, he had set sail for the Antarctic. His ship had eyes and ears of
    zinc. It ferried him to ruin.

    The final years have a certain pulse, a sense of purpose, which holds a lesson
    for those who came after him. Holed up in a cabin in the Antarctic, the Man of
    Bandages shunned a world that only now was crowding round, eager for the merest
    glimpse of this figure of modern myth. His razor-sharp dentures tearing at raw
    fish through the slit in his bandaged head, the Man of Bandages spent most of
    his time drawing complicated diagrams. Every few years, weather stations and other
    outposts would report that another massive explosion had occurred somewhere out
    in the glacial wasteland. The Man of Bandages had found his destiny. He was snarling,
    jabbering, gibbering, dribbling and drooling underneath all those bandages. But
    ah, he was fulfilled.'
