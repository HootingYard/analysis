  text: "Ah, the Man of Bandages was born in Ghent at the turn of the last century.\
    \ His parents were impoverished but elegant. His mother had wasted her youth wandering\
    \ around northern Canada looking for reindeer. His father was indecisive and crumpled,\
    \ forever carrying out experiments to cross the potato with the moorhen, and failing.\
    \ When the Man of Bandages was four years old, mama and papa, clutched in a passionate\
    \ embrace beneath a gnarled yew, were struck by lightning and perished. The Man\
    \ of Bandages spent the remainder of his childhood ferried between relatives in\
    \ Europe and South America. At some point during these years, he gradually became\
    \ aware of the first stirrings of his remarkable destiny.\nLittle else is known\
    \ of the Man of Bandages until he surfaces in Totnes in 1922, sporting an unconvincing\
    \ walrus moustache. A snapshot taken by Blothead of Winnipeg has been published\
    \ the world over. The Man of Bandages can be seen loitering outside the post office,\
    \ pallid and skeletal. In his left hand he is holding an iron hammer. He appears\
    \ to be whistling. His hair is matted. Is it, as Duvalier has argued, a toup\xE9\
    e made of wool? His clothing is cheap but serviceable. Even at this early stage,\
    \ a frayed length of bandage can be seen dangling from the breast pocket of his\
    \ jacket. Conspicuous by its absence from the photograph is his bicycle, which\
    \ we know he had acquired by this time. Without it, the Man of Bandages is somehow\
    \ incomplete, not quite the figure of legend he would later become.\nMarooned\
    \ on a raft in the middle of a very cold ocean, the Man of Bandages chewed a piece\
    \ of coal and pondered his existence. The sky was grey, the rain poured down,\
    \ and the Man of Bandages would almost certainly have frozen to death were he\
    \ not wearing his home-made blubbery anorak. Later, of course, the garment was\
    \ put on display in the museum at Pointy Town. But back then, the preposterous\
    \ anorak with its straps, zips, chutes, pockets, twanging hoops, hinges, spindles\
    \ and other festoonments kept the Man of Bandages alive. For eight months he drifted\
    \ on the high seas, out of reach of the most tenacious police officer, plotting\
    \ his future. This period of his life was the subject of a book by Q V Partridge,\
    \ filmed in 1958 as Raft Of Hell, with Tad Brick as our hero. Brick died in mysterious\
    \ circumstances the following year. He was found splayed on a lawn somewhere or\
    \ other, a carton of buttermilk upended and spilled on his pantaloons.\nThe Man\
    \ of Bandages set out for the Antarctic. He took a map, a compass, and a bag of\
    \ water with which to dab at his forehead. He was deluded but indefatigable. At\
    \ the coast, he built an improvised tub and had a long soak in hot water scented\
    \ with cotoneaster, persimmon and henbane. He flung what coinage he still carried\
    \ into the sea, muttering, muttering. He was headed south, smoking heavily, now\
    \ almost covered in bandages from the neck down. He did not sleep at nights. Glazed\
    \ and thinning, he had set sail for the Antarctic. His ship had eyes and ears\
    \ of zinc. It ferried him to ruin.\nThe final years have a certain pulse, a sense\
    \ of purpose, which holds a lesson for those who came after him. Holed up in a\
    \ cabin in the Antarctic, the Man of Bandages shunned a world that only now was\
    \ crowding round, eager for the merest glimpse of this figure of modern myth.\
    \ His razor-sharp dentures tearing at raw fish through the slit in his bandaged\
    \ head, the Man of Bandages spent most of his time drawing complicated diagrams.\
    \ Every few years, weather stations and other outposts would report that another\
    \ massive explosion had occurred somewhere out in the glacial wasteland. The Man\
    \ of Bandages had found his destiny. He was snarling, jabbering, gibbering, dribbling\
    \ and drooling underneath all those bandages. But ah, he was fulfilled."
