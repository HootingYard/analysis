  text: 'The first Hooting Yard Symposium will take place in September, bringing together
    academics and specialists in a radical look at the urban duckpond. Tord Grip (no
    relation to Sven-Goran Eriksson''s assistant) will present his ground-breaking
    paper "Robespierre, Danton, Marat : Nomenclature Of The 21st Century Urban Duck",
    and Maisie Poopdeck will facilitate a seminar on "Hermeneutic Strategies Towards
    A Marcusian Approach To The Fundamentalist Brule Of Bufflehead Courtship Rituals
    In The Post 9/11 Ethos With Tea and Cake In The Sir Vidia Naipaul Lounge Afterwards",
    among many other excitements. Tickets are available, but God knows where. A charabanc
    will pick up delegates from the station at eleven o clock sharp. Bring your own
    towel, soap, tea bags and duck (optional).'
