  text: 'Few puzzles have taxed the minds of generations as maddeningly as Blodgett''s
    famous "Fishpaste Conundrum". It is a great pleasure to introduce it to readers
    who may not have come across it before.

    A man wearing a metal neck-brace is carrying a tub of fishpaste towards a very
    tall lighthouse. At each step he takes, one or other of his big black boots thumps
    the ground heavily. To his left, there is a row of poplars, sixteen in all, in
    each of which is an owl. No two owls are facing in the same direction. When, earlier
    in the day, the man carrying the tub of fishpaste was reading his daily newspaper,
    he noted that one of the clues in the cryptic crossword featured an anagram of
    Tallulah Bankhead. This is still on his mind as he approaches ever closer to the
    very tall lighthouse. In fact, he is so preoccupied that when all the owls fly
    away from the poplars at the same moment, he does not even notice. The tub of
    fishpaste weighs 14 panes. What is the connection between the fishpaste, the owls,
    the metal neck-brace and the anagram?
