  text: "Few puzzles have taxed the minds of generations as maddeningly as Blodgett's\
    \ famous \u201CFishpaste Conundrum\u201D. It is a great pleasure to introduce\
    \ it to readers who may not have come across it before.\nA man wearing a metal\
    \ neck-brace is carrying a tub of fishpaste towards a very tall lighthouse. At\
    \ each step he takes, one or other of his big black boots thumps the ground heavily.\
    \ To his left, there is a row of poplars, sixteen in all, in each of which is\
    \ an owl. No two owls are facing in the same direction. When, earlier in the day,\
    \ the man carrying the tub of fishpaste was reading his daily newspaper, he noted\
    \ that one of the clues in the cryptic crossword featured an anagram of Tallulah\
    \ Bankhead. This is still on his mind as he approaches ever closer to the very\
    \ tall lighthouse. In fact, he is so preoccupied that when all the owls fly away\
    \ from the poplars at the same moment, he does not even notice. The tub of fishpaste\
    \ weighs 14 panes. What is the connection between the fishpaste, the owls, the\
    \ metal neck-brace and the anagram?\n\nSource : 1001 Puzzles For Mist-Enshrouded\
