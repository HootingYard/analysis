  text: '"He shrieked aloud in the agony of despair--the torch fell from his trembling
    hand into the dark waters that gurgled at his feet, and, flashing for a moment
    upon their inky surface, expired with a hissing sound, that fell like a death-warning
    upon his ear. The wind, which had been scarcely felt during the day, began to
    rise with the flowing of the tide, and now drove the tumultuous waves with hoarse

    living grave!" -- James O Brayman, Thrilling Adventures By Land And Sea'
