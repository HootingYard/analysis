  text: "\u201CHe shrieked aloud in the agony of despair\u2014the torch fell from\
    \ his trembling hand into the dark waters that gurgled at his feet, and, flashing\
    \ for a moment upon their inky surface, expired with a hissing sound, that fell\
    \ like a death-warning upon his ear. The wind, which had been scarcely felt during\
    \ the day, began to rise with the flowing of the tide, and now drove the tumultuous\
    \ waves with hoarse and hideous clamor into the cavern. Every moment increased\
    \ the violence of the gale that howled and bellowed as it swept around the echoing\
    \ roof of that rock-ribbed prison; while the hoarse dash of the approaching waves,\
    \ and the shrill screams of the sea-birds that filled the cavern, formed a concert\
    \ of terrible dissonance, well suited for the requiem, of the hapless wretch who\
    \ had been enclosed in that living grave!\u201D \u2014 James O Brayman, Thrilling\
    \ Adventures By Land And Sea"
