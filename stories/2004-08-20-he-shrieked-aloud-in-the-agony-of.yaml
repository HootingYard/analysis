  text: '"He shrieked aloud in the agony of despair--the torch fell from his trembling
    hand into the dark waters that gurgled at his feet, and, flashing for a moment
    upon their inky surface, expired with a hissing sound, that fell like a death-warning
    upon his ear. The wind, which had been scarcely felt during the day, began to
    rise with the flowing of the tide, and now drove the tumultuous waves with hoarse
    and hideous clamor into the cavern. Every moment increased the violence of the
    gale that howled and bellowed as it swept around the echoing roof of that rock-ribbed
    prison; while the hoarse dash of the approaching waves, and the shrill screams
    of the sea-birds that filled the cavern, formed a concert of terrible dissonance,
    well suited for the requiem, of the hapless wretch who had been enclosed in that
    living grave!" -- James O Brayman, Thrilling Adventures By Land And Sea'
