  text: "The Mimick is a type of dog which is thought by some \u2018to be conceived\
    \ by an Ape; for in wit and disposition it resembleth an Ape\u2019. The Mimick\
    \ is able \u2018to imitate all things it seeth\u2019. Plutarch reported that he\
    \ saw a public spectacle before the emperor in Rome, wherein a Mimick enacted\
    \ an entire dramatic production containing \u2018many persons parts\u2019, including\
    \ a death scene, during which \u2018he began to reel and stagger to and fro like\
    \ a drunken man\u2019. That's what Edward Topsell said,anyway, in his History\
    \ Of Four-Footed Beasts of 1607, or to give it its full title, The History Of\
    \ Four-footed Beasts And Serpents : Describing at Large Their True and Lively\
    \ Figure, their Several Natures, Conditions, Kinds, Virtues (both Natural and\
    \ Medicinal) Countries of their Breed, their Love and Hatred to Mankind, and the\
    \ wonderful work of God in their Creation, Prefection, and Destruction, Interwoven\
    \ with curious variety of Historical Narrations out of Scriptures, Papers, Philosophers,\
    \ Physicians and Poets. Here is the Mimick:\n\nMany more of Topsell's beasts can\
    \ be seen at an excellent site by Tim Gadd, which you can visit by clicking on\
    \ the picture."
