  text: 'We are pleased to announce an exciting new scheme here at Hooting Yard. In
    our tireless attempts to keep alive forgotten pockets of our cultural heritage,
    if pockets can be considered animate, we are introducing Rare Bird Loyalty Cards.
    That''s right! To honour the time when music meant portentous vapidity, aimless
    noodling, and cod-orchestral shenanigans, you can win points on your Loyalty Card
    every time you devote part of your listening day to the more ludicrous excesses
    of prog rock.


    The design of the card is based on Rare Bird''s Sympathy LP, which may or may
    not have had a gatefold sleeve originally. Extra points can be awarded if you
    manage to dredge up memories of significant titles such as Pantagruel''s Nativity
    by the otiose Gentle Giant. To apply for your card, send us an email with the
    words Atomic Rooster in the subject line.'
