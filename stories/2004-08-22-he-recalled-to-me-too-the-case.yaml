  text: '"He recalled to me, too, the case of a well-known novelist who has recently
    contracted to supply a publisher with four novels in one year, each novel to run
    to not less than a hundred thousand words. Even Balzac''s titanic industry must
    hide its diminished head before such appalling fecundity; and what would Horace
    have to say to such froglike verbal spawning?" -- Richard Le Gallienne, Imperishable
    Fiction'
