  text: 'Having read very carefully last Wednesday''s quotation from Forty Centuries
    Of Ink by David N Carvalho (see 18th August), reader Glyn Webster has decided
    to carry out an experiment:

    In my driveway--he writes--I have stacked a sheet of writing paper, a ball of
    cotton soaked in quicklime and orpin (calcium oxide and arsenic sesquisulphide)
    and a brick. I will examine it daily for any messages European readers of Hooting
    Yard may wish to send me. Procedure: write your message on the kerb in clear block
    capitals in saturn (lead--a fisherman''s lead sinker will do, but pencil lead
    will not); kick that message hard four or five times, then park your car over
    it to apply a vice-like pressure.'
