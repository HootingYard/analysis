  text: 'Also referring to last Wednesday is Tim Thurn. I am unable to quote his letter
    verbatim, as it was one of those increasingly rare letters written with pen and
    ink on paper, placed in an envelope with a stamp on it, and delivered to Hooting
    Yard by a postman*, and I inadvertently threw it away. The gist of Tim''s scribbled
    note was that the illustration of a starling only showed a side view. What, he
    asks, does the other side look like? This seems at first to be a fatuous question,
    but perhaps Tim is on to something. Here is the other side of a starling:


    * NOTE : The postman who delivered Tim''s letter was not The Postman, as played
    by Kevin Costner in that foolish, foolish film, although there are times when,
    looking out of the window, one could be forgiven for thinking that a nuclear holocaust
    had already happened..'
