  text: "A WEEK OR SO after the young rapscallion had set off on his travels, I was\
    \ astonished one morning to receive a letter from my Uncle Nobby. Like the rest\
    \ of the family, I had assumed he was dead. Twenty years ago, weighed down by\
    \ life's travails, he had stowed away on the steamship Corrugated Cardboard, bound\
    \ for Tantarabim. Engulfed by storms, the ship went down ten miles off the coast\
    \ of Sprague, with\u2014according to the newspapers\u2014no survivors. We had\
    \ held a little memorial service for him, and donated his few possessions to the\
    \ St Odo Rest Home for the Bewildered and the Fraught.\nYet there could be no\
    \ mistaking the authorship of the letter: it was in Uncle Nobby's curiously ham-fisted\
    \ handwriting, and the paper gave off the trademark reek of spam and hair-oil\
    \ which made my uncle such a trying fellow to be within ten feet of.\nDear Agamemnon,\
    \ it read, I have returned to the land of my birth after two decades of quite\
    \ preposterous escapades. I am staying in the Bodger's Spinney Hotel, and would\
    \ very much like you to join me for breakfast on Thursday the sixteenth. Come\
    \ on horseback, for I will want to purchase your steed, and will pay you well.\
    \ All the best, Uncle Nobby.\nI decided not to alert any other members of my family\
    \ to this intriguing happenstance. Nor did I inform milady: in any case, she was\
    \ so far gone in her bafflement that she would not have known what I was talking\
    \ about. I was rather worried about her two sisters, who would doubtless insist\
    \ on a detailed explanation for my absence, but as chance would have it they were\
    \ drowned in the duckpond on the very day the letter arrived.\nThat was the ninth:\
    \ I had a week to prepare myself to confront Uncle Nobby. This at least gave me\
    \ time to nip off to the village to buy a horse, and to take some riding-lessons.\
    \ I am afraid that I was a rather clumsy pupil, despite the best efforts of Hengist\
    \ Grudge, my instructor, and I must have cut an ungainly figure clopping along\
    \ the woodland paths to Bodger's Spinney on the evening of the fifteenth. I put\
    \ up at an inn overnight, a lewd and boisterous place, where my dignified bearing,\
    \ metal skull-plate, and whimsical chit-chat met with ridicule from the assembled\
    \ topers, gamblers, swindlers and ruffians, so that by the time I had given my\
    \ horse his suppertime oat-tub and retired to my horrible room, I had a black\
    \ eye, a fractured rib, and a nasty cut on my upper lip, not to mention innumerable\
    \ bruises, aches, pains and abrasions, plus an impromptu tattoo\u2014the name\
    \ Enid in blood-bruised italics, set in an arrow-spliced heart\u2014on my left\
    \ forearm. Enid?\nIn the middle of the night, I awoke to find a maniac carousing\
    \ at the foot of my bed. Convinced that it was an hallucination, I turned over\
    \ and went back to sleep.\nAt dawn, I awoke in a state of rancour and disgust.\
    \ Limping downstairs, I was presented with breakfast. Mercifully, the riotous\
    \ ne'er-do-wells of the previous night were still abed, and I had only the landlord's\
    \ smirking contempt to deal with. He placed before me a dish of tongue, pig's\
    \ liver and saveloys, swimming in grease, and a rusty tankard filled to the half-way\
    \ mark with watered-down milk and cabbage broth. My manners deserted me. I sent\
    \ both dish and tankard clattering to the floor with a single sweep of my arm,\
    \ picked up a hefty club, and bashed the landlord thrice about the midriff. Then,\
    \ without paying my bill, I lurched off to the stables, mounted my horse, and\
    \ rode away.\nThis was a mistake. I had gone only a few hundred yards when, looking\
    \ behind me, I saw that I was being pursued by the landlord and a posse of cut-throats.\
    \ That they meant me harm was not in doubt. I spurred on my horse, but he was\
    \ aged and weak, and no match for the powerful stallions ridden by my pursuers.\
    \ The distance between us was closing with every second, and I was so terrified\
    \ at the thought of my imminent doom that I am afraid I piddled in my pantaloons.\n\
    Then, out of nowhere, a motorbike and sidecar came hurtling towards me, screeching\
    \ to a halt just as the landlord and his crew were about to draw level. The horses\u2014\
    including mine\u2014reared up, frightened, but rather than stampeding away, they\
    \ seemed transfixed, snorting and whinnying pitifully, as if in thrall of some\
    \ nameless and intangible menace. The motorcyclist dismounted, took from his pannier\
    \ a pair of folding crutches, skipped lightly round to the sidecar, and helped\
    \ his passenger to clamber out of it, manoeuvering him skilfully onto the crutches.\
    \ When the motorcyclist removed the safety helmet from the lame man's head, we\
    \ all let out gasps of astonishment. It was Father Ninian Gumbeetle SJ, the world-famous\
    \ withered Jesuit!\nThe landlord and his cronies at once leapt down from their\
    \ horses and prostrated themselves at the misshapen feet of the priest. I was\
    \ about to do likewise, but he held up his tiny, twisted hand to stop me.\n\u201C\
    Flee,\u201D he croaked, \u201CGo now, while you can. I will deal with these worms.\
    \ I sense that you are squeamish, and what I am about to do would turn your stomach.\
    \ It is best that you begone.\u201D\nBalancing himself carefully, he clapped his\
    \ hands to shoo my horse on its way. I dared not look back. I do not know what\
    \ unutterable retribution Father Gumbeetle visited upon the heads of my pursuers,\
    \ but even now I often lie awake at night, deprived of sleep, turning over in\
    \ my mind the hideous possibilities.\nAn hour later I tied up my horse outside\
    \ the Bodger's Spinney Hotel and passed through creaking oaken doors into the\
    \ lobby. I was peering around in my dreamy, myopic way, when a uniformed man accosted\
    \ me.\n\u201CYes?\u201D he shouted.\n\u201CI\u2019m looking for the breakfast\
    \ room,\u201D I said, after doing a startled little jump.\n\u201CWhy?\u201D he\
    \ yelled.\n\u201CI have an appointment,\u201D I explained, \u201CWith one of the\
    \ guests.\u201D\n\u201CAnd?\u201D screeched my interrogator.\nAnd what?, I thought.\n\
    \u201CAnd?\u201D he insisted, even louder.\n\u201CAnd, um, I\u2019d like you to\
    \ show me where I might find him,\u201D I tried.\n\u201CAnd?\u201D It was blood-curdling\
    \ by now. I quaked.\n\u201CAnd, and \u2026 look, would you like a tip?\u201D\n\
    Now a second person appeared. He was older, dressed in an expensive suit, had\
    \ double pneumonia, and wore some sort of chain of office. The uniformed man gave\
    \ a little display of bows and scrapes to indicate that this man was his superior.\n\
    \u201CWhat's going on here?\u201D asked the latter.\n\u201CThis man says he's\
    \ got an appointment, sir.\u201D\n\u201CAn appointment?\u201D\n\u201CIn the breakfast\
    \ room.\u201D\n\u201CAn appointment in the breakfast room?\u201D\n\u201CWith one\
    \ of the guests.\u201D\n\u201CAn appointment in the breakfast room with one of\
    \ the guests?\u201D\nHe turned to me.\n\u201CLet me get this clear,\u201D he said\
    \ evenly, weighing his words, \u201CYou're saying that you have an appointment\
    \ in the breakfast room with one of the guests?\u201D\n\u201CYes,\u201D I replied.\n\
    \u201CTwinge,\u201D he said, turning to the uniformed man, \u201CGet Captain Freakpit\
    \ down here right away. You,\u201D he said to me, \u201Chad better wait in the\
    \ dimly-lit room at the end of the corridor. No\u2014don't protest! We'll get\
    \ this sorted out without a hint of delay. Come with me.\u201D\nI followed him\
    \ to a dimly-lit room at the end of the corridor. We sat facing each other in\
    \ complete silence. After a while he seemed to grow restive, and reached over\
    \ to a little cabinet, from which he took a flag. Draping it over his knees, he\
    \ rummaged in his pockets, produced a sewing kit, and began to darn the flag,\
    \ looking up at me from time to time as if to check that I was still there. Eager\
    \ as I was to break the silence, I couldn't think of anything to say.\nThen we\
    \ heard urgent footsteps approaching along the corridor, and after an unnecessary\
    \ knocking at the door, Twinge entered the room. He looked shaken.\n\u201CIt's\
    \ Captain Freakpit, sir,\u201D he said, \u201CHe's hanged himself.\u201D\nThrowing\
    \ the flag aside, the superior jumped out of his chair and dashed out of the room,\
    \ making strangulated noises as if he were a seagull regurgitating food for its\
    \ young. Twinge hared after him. Blinking, I decided to follow them, down the\
    \ corridor, through the lobby, up a staircase, along a passage, through a connecting-room,\
    \ up another staircase, along another corridor, up a step-ladder, through a hatch,\
    \ into a storeroom, through a door, up yet another staircase, across a landing,\
    \ up another ladder, into an attic, and there, swinging gently from the rafters,\
    \ suspended by a length of Italian hemp, I saw, bug-eyed and purple, and quite,\
    \ quite dead, not \u201CCaptain Freakpit\u201D, but my Uncle Nobby.\n[Scrimgeour\
    \ henceforth devotes several dozen pages to a mawkish valediction, of no interest\
    \ whatsoever. Things liven up a bit when he pieces together his uncle's final\
    \ days, hiding out in the hotel posing as Freakpit \u2014a man he had murdered\
    \ a fortnight earlier\u2014and growing increasingly desperate as his many and\
    \ various enemies close in. The author then spends an unwarrantable amount of\
    \ time in fruitless conjecture as to why he, Scrimgeour, had been summoned to\
    \ the hotel. Did his uncle have an important message for him? Had he left anything\
    \ in his room which could shed light on the mystery? Just how much had he been\
    \ intending to pay for the horse? This sort of drivel goes on for so long that\
    \ one has to physically restrain oneself from plunging the book into a vat of\
    \ boiling tar. Eventually, however, it perks up again when Scrimgeour rides off\
    \ on his horse, heading for home\u2026]\nBy mid-afternoon, my horse was growing\
    \ tired, and I was ravenously hungry, and I veered off the path and made for the\
    \ tiny hamlet of Mustard Parva. I hoped there to find a tavern more hospitable\
    \ than the iniquitous den of the previous night. I halted outside a pretty little\
    \ inn called The Rhinoceros & Buttercup, and, fixing a nosebag onto the horse,\
    \ stepped warily inside. It was a vision of wonderment, a pocket of heaven on\
    \ earth. My heart burst with bliss as I sat down at a dainty table. Beautiful\
    \ women and handsome men thronged about me, humming angelic melodies, caressing\
    \ me gently, and dabbing at last night's gashes and bruises with pads of cotton\
    \ wool soaked in ointments, unguents and lotions. Plates piled high with ambrosial\
    \ foodstuffs were set before me, and wherever I turned I was proferred gleaming\
    \ goblets of sweet and delightful drinks. A dozen shimmering, winged creatures\
    \ plucked on harps, creating an unearthly music. The place was festooned with\
    \ exotic flowers, in pots and vases and hanging baskets, their rare and delicate\
    \ perfumes combining to create a heady fragrance. I felt that by some strange\
    \ accident I had entered upon paradise.\n[Scrimgeor got a bit carried away with\
    \ the adjectives in the above passage, but I thought you should get some idea\
    \ of the awfulness of his prose, if only to appreciate how much I have spared\
    \ you with my ruthless editing.]\nThen the door crashed open, and a wretched,\
    \ glowering man strode up to the bar and beat his fists upon it. The spell, if\
    \ spell it was, was broken.\n\u201CI want a barrel of grog!\u201D cried the man.\
    \ Fear-struck, two of the handsome men immediately scurried down to the cellars\
    \ to fetch what he wanted. He glared around at the company.\n\u201CWhose horse\
    \ is that outside?\u201D he yelled. I begged that he would not cast his eyes upon\
    \ me, but my furious blushes gave me away. Coming close, thrusting his face into\
    \ mine, foul-breathed, he roared, \u201CIt's yours, is it? Come on, you're going\
    \ to help me!\u201D\nHe let out a gurgling laugh and hoisted me to my feet. The\
    \ barrel of grog was brought up from the cellars and he had it lashed to my poor\
    \ horse's back.\n\u201CYou lead the gee-gee,\u201D he said, \u201Cand follow me.\u201D\
    \nI had no choice but to obey, for he presented such a terrifying figure that\
    \ I was sure any refusal would be met by inexplicable violence. In silence broken\
    \ only by the pitiful clip-clop of my horse and by occasional belches from my\
    \ tormentor, we headed away from Mustard Parva into the countryside. It began\
    \ to rain.\nAn hour later, we came to a spinney, wherein a quartet of thin and\
    \ demented outcasts were sprawled hopelessly upon a picnic-blanket, their hollow\
    \ eyes fixed upon a hamper which had been heavily padlocked. They seemed oblivious\
    \ to our arrival, until the ferocious-looking man shouted to them.\n\u201CRight,\
    \ you scum, it's feeding time.\u201D\nHe took from his pocket a gigantic bunch\
    \ of keys; only then did I notice that the piteous crew wore fetters, from which\
    \ he now proceeded to free them, before unlocking the hamper. They fell upon the\
    \ food like beasts, while their keeper dragged the barrel of grog off my horse\
    \ and rolled it towards a titanic larch. He sat down and drew off a flagon's worth\
    \ of grog, downing it in one. Then, as if he had only just remembered my presence,\
    \ he flung a coin at me, and bid me leave, using words which delicacy forbids\
    \ me from setting down here.\nSadly reflecting upon the misery of life, I was\
    \ about to mount my horse when, taking a last look at the bestial picnickers,\
    \ I was astonished to see a young man who I could have sworn was milady's hypochondriac\
    \ son.\n[That is not the worst thing Scrimgeour has to say about me in his Memoirs,\
    \ so I shall let it pass.]\nI looked again: it was him! As he shovelled great\
    \ chunks of black pudding into his mouth, his eyes met mine. Dulled by whatever\
    \ hateful calamity had befallen him, he seemed not to recognise me. Then, perhaps\
    \ because I was staring at him so intently, with such astonishment, something\
    \ flickered in his soul, and he raised himself up, spat out the sausage of coagulated\
    \ pig's blood, and allowed himself a hesitant \u201CAg, Ag, Agamomenon?\u201D\n\
    \u201CIt is you!\u201D I cried.\n\u201CAga. Ag? Agamemnon?\u201D\nHe got it right\
    \ that time. Sense was sifting back into his brain. While we stood like a couple\
    \ of splinterheads batting our befuddled greetings back and forth, the keeper\u2014\
    or coachman, as I was later to learn was his proper title\u2014was sinking ever\
    \ more inevitably into a stupor. The grog from the Rhinoceros & Buttercup was,\
