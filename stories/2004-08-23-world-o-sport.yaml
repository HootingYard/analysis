  text: One of the great pleasures of the Olympic Games is listening to the commentators
    on radio and television. For one thing, there are all those obscure, minority
    activities for which arcane and incomprehensible terms have been coined. Listen
    to a skeet shooting or, in the Winter Olympics, curling commentator and you will
    be lucky to understand a word of what they say. Those whose remit is more familiar--athletics,
    gymnastics--have to do their best to compete. Thus, yesterday, I was delighted
    by the BBC pundit who noted, with due gravitas, of an entrant in one of those
    events where athletes run repeatedly around a track, "I've been dubious about
    her hydration". One can only echo that sentiment. For my part, I know that dubiousness
    about hydration is always to the forefront of my mind when watching people in
    numbered vests running around with that gleam of demented concentration in their
    eyes.
