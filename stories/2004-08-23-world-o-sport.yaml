  text: "One of the great pleasures of the Olympic Games is listening to the commentators\
    \ on radio and television. For one thing, there are all those obscure, minority\
    \ activities for which arcane and incomprehensible terms have been coined. Listen\
    \ to a skeet shooting or, in the Winter Olympics, curling commentator and you\
    \ will be lucky to understand a word of what they say. Those whose remit is more\
    \ familiar\u2014athletics, gymnastics\u2014have to do their best to compete. Thus,\
    \ yesterday, I was delighted by the BBC pundit who noted, with due gravitas, of\
    \ an entrant in one of those events where athletes run repeatedly around a track,\
    \ \u201CI've been dubious about her hydration\u201D. One can only echo that sentiment.\
    \ For my part, I know that dubiousness about hydration is always to the forefront\
    \ of my mind when watching people in numbered vests running around with that gleam\
    \ of demented concentration in their eyes."
