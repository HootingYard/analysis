  text: 'This brief rummage through the Hooting Yard postbag ends with the following,
    from reader Peter Ross:

    While in Norfolk we went to something called ''The Village Experience''. It was
    like a League of Gentlemen version of Legoland. Each of the so called rides, which
    only functioned every hour or so, was attended by a humpbacked man with a limp.
    There was also a large shed containing a Wurlitzer collection where we managed
    to catch a concert performed by a slightly odd teenager. The whole place looked
    like it had been built in the 1960s and never updated. In fact it would not have
    surprised me if the whole thing had been brought over from Plovdiv. Don''t know
    why I have told you this, except that it had a certain Hooting Yard quality about
    it. Sadly the place is closing down in September.'
