  text: 'Sir : Idly perusing your website the other day [Sunday 22nd August] I was
    interested to see the quotation from the late 19th century aesthete Richard le
    Gallienne. Here is part of an autograph letter I purchased many years ago, written
    by the great man from his house in Brentford to a certain Mr Percy A Wells in
    January 1895, which concludes: ''P.S. If I am ever bicycling in the neighbourhood
    of Chertsey--I hope I may come & see you." No mention of ''froglike verbal spawning,''
    but you can''t have everything.Yours sincerely, Max Decharne
