  text: "Sir : Idly perusing your website the other day [Sunday 22nd August] I was\
    \ interested to see the quotation from the late 19th century aesthete Richard\
    \ le Gallienne. Here is part of an autograph letter I purchased many years ago,\
    \ written by the great man from his house in Brentford to a certain Mr Percy A\
    \ Wells in January 1895, which concludes: 'P.S. If I am ever bicycling in the\
    \ neighbourhood of Chertsey\u2014I hope I may come & see you.\u201C No mention\
    \ of \u2018froglike verbal spawning,\u2019 but you can't have everything.Yours\
    \ sincerely, Max D\xE9charn\xE9\n"
