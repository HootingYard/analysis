  text: "Last week I bumped into an old acquaintance in the street, and almost the\
    \ first thing he said was, \u201CFrank, tell me about nidor\u201D. Luckily, I\
    \ had just been reading Blodgett's Book Of Animal Sacrifice, and was able to spout\
    \ forth much wisdom on the subject. It seems only fair to reprint here the passage\
    \ which allowed me to impress my old pal. Note that the book is available in electronic\
    \ format from www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/savagerituals/sacrifice/beastsofthefield.html\n\
    There is nothing better to put some zing into an overcast Thursday morning after\
    \ a night of fitful sleep than to wander into the desert and sacrifice a quadruped.\
    \ Goats, I feel, have been a little overdone\u2014excuse the pun\u2014as have\
    \ rams. Why not try a bison, or even a dromedary? Before you can smell the wafting\
    \ nidor of charred animal flesh, however, you will need to set up a sacrificial\
    \ altar. Stone slabs are useful, but if there are none to hand, you can improvise\
    \ using sticks and branches. Don't build your altar too high\u2014remember you\
    \ will have to tether your beast to it prior to slaughter. Once the altar is satisfactorily\
    \ completed, I recommend that you ritually cleanse it. There are several very\
    \ effective ritual cleaning agents on the market which shouldn't put too big a\
    \ dent in your pocket. I usually use Dr Gillespie's Aromatic Camphor & Myrrh Preparation,\
    \ but then I am very fond of the packaging. Some wailing and ululation while you\
    \ scrub never goes amiss. Now, tie your bison, dromedary, or other quadruped to\
    \ the altar and sprinkle it with something\u2014herbs, space-age glitter-dust,\
    \ talc, anything you like\u2014and slaughter it. Making very careful use of your\
    \ safety matches, ignite the dead beast and do a bit more wailing. The air will\
    \ soon be heavy with nidor, especially if you fan the flames with palm leaves.\
    \ When the fire has utterly consumed your sacrificial animal, do tidy up after\
    \ you. The ashes may be cast unto the winds, or you may prefer to use a dustpan\
    \ and brush to place them in an amphora.\n"
