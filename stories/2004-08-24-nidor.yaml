  text: 'Last week I bumped into an old acquaintance in the street, and almost the
    first thing he said was, "Frank, tell me about nidor". Luckily, I had just been
    reading Blodgett''s Book Of Animal Sacrifice, and was able to spout forth much
    wisdom on the subject. It seems only fair to reprint here the passage which allowed
    me to impress my old pal. Note that the book is available in electronic format
    from www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/savagerituals/sacrifice/beastsofthefield.html

    There is nothing better to put some zing into an overcast Thursday morning after
    a night of fitful sleep than to wander into the desert and sacrifice a quadruped.
    Goats, I feel, have been a little overdone--excuse the pun--as have rams. Why
    not try a bison, or even a dromedary? Before you can smell the wafting nidor of
    charred animal flesh, however, you will need to set up a sacrificial altar. Stone
    slabs are useful, but if there are none to hand, you can improvise using sticks
    and branches. Don''t build your altar too high--remember you will have to tether
    your beast to it prior to slaughter. Once the altar is satisfactorily completed,
    I recommend that you ritually cleanse it. There are several very effective ritual
    cleaning agents on the market which shouldn''t put too big a dent in your pocket.
    I usually use Dr Gillespie''s Aromatic Camphor & Myrrh Preparation, but then I
    am very fond of the packaging. Some wailing and ululation while you scrub never
    goes amiss. Now, tie your bison, dromedary, or other quadruped to the altar and
    sprinkle it with something--herbs, space-age glitter-dust, talc, anything you
    like--and slaughter it. Making very careful use of your safety matches, ignite
    the dead beast and do a bit more wailing. The air will soon be heavy with nidor,
    especially if you fan the flames with palm leaves. When the fire has utterly consumed
    your sacrificial animal, do tidy up after you. The ashes may be cast unto the
    winds, or you may prefer to use a dustpan and brush to place them in an amphora.
