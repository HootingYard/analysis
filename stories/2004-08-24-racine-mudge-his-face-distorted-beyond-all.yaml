  text: '"Racine Mudge, his face distorted beyond all recognition, was making a marvellous
    inward movement, as though doubling back upon himself. He turned funnel-wise,
    like water in a whirling vortex, and then appeared to break up somewhat as a reflection
    breaks up and divides in a distorting convex mirror. He went neither forward nor
    backward, neither to the right nor the left, neither up nor down. But he went.
    He went utterly. He simply flashed away out of sight like a vanishing projectile.
    All but one leg." -- Algernon Blackwood, A Victim Of Higher Space'
