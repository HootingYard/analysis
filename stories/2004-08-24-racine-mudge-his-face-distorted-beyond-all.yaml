  text: "\u201CRacine Mudge, his face distorted beyond all recognition, was making\
    \ a marvellous inward movement, as though doubling back upon himself. He turned\
    \ funnel-wise, like water in a whirling vortex, and then appeared to break up\
    \ somewhat as a reflection breaks up and divides in a distorting convex mirror.\
    \ He went neither forward nor backward, neither to the right nor the left, neither\
    \ up nor down. But he went. He went utterly. He simply flashed away out of sight\
    \ like a vanishing projectile. All but one leg.\u201D \u2014 Algernon Blackwood,\
    \ A Victim Of Higher Space"
