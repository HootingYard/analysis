    Minnie Crunlop first wore her trailing bandage after she was slightly injured
    during a fight with an ostrich. Quite what she was doing sharing a confined space
    with the panic-stricken bird is not known, and Ms Crunlop herself has been characteristically
    tight-lipped about the whole business. She is clearly fond of her bandage, however,
    because it still trails along behind her even though the injury has long since
    healed, according to her doctor, who does not give two figs, nor pins, nor a jot,
    nor even a tittle, for the confidentiality implicit in the doctor-patient relationship,
    and instead has taken to shouting from the rooftops that Ms Crunlop''s bandage
    of lint is completely unnecessary. Please note that, for once, the phrase "shouting
    from the rooftops" is meant literally, adding another mystery to the affair. Who
    knows why, loudhailer in hand, Ms Crunlop''s general practitioner clambers up
    often rickety and unsafe fire escapes, simply to bellow this--admittedly minor--detail
    of her medical history to all and sundry, most of whom have no idea who Minnie
    Crunlop is?'
