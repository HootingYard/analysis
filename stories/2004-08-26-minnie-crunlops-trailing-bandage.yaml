  text: "\nMinnie Crunlop first wore her trailing bandage after she was slightly injured\
    \ during a fight with an ostrich. Quite what she was doing sharing a confined\
    \ space with the panic-stricken bird is not known, and Ms Crunlop herself has\
    \ been characteristically tight-lipped about the whole business. She is clearly\
    \ fond of her bandage, however, because it still trails along behind her even\
    \ though the injury has long since healed, according to her doctor, who does not\
    \ give two figs, nor pins, nor a jot, nor even a tittle, for the confidentiality\
    \ implicit in the doctor-patient relationship, and instead has taken to shouting\
    \ from the rooftops that Ms Crunlop's bandage of lint is completely unnecessary.\
    \ Please note that, for once, the phrase \u201Cshouting from the rooftops\u201D\
    \ is meant literally, adding another mystery to the affair. Who knows why, loudhailer\
    \ in hand, Ms Crunlop's general practitioner clambers up often rickety and unsafe\
    \ fire escapes, simply to bellow this\u2014admittedly minor\u2014detail of her\
    \ medical history to all and sundry, most of whom have no idea who Minnie Crunlop\
    \ is?"
