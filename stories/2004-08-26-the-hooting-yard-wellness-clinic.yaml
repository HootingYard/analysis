  text: 'Regular readers know that here at Hooting Yard we devote ourselves to their
    amusement, instruction, and moral edification. To date, however, we have perhaps
    neglected our duty to address matters of physical health, and more specifically
    to suggesting remedies for common ailments. Thus it is that we plan, over the
    next days or weeks, to reprint excerpts from the anonymous 1653 text A Book Of
    Fruits & Flowers or, to give its full title, A Book Of Fruits & Flowers: Shewing
    The Nature and Use of them, either for Meat or Medicine. As Also: To Preserve,
    Conserve, Candy, and in Wedges, or Dry them. To make Powders, Civet bagges, all
    sorts of Sugar-works, turn''d works in Sugar, Hollow, or Frutages; and to Pickell
    them. And for Meat. To make Pyes, Biscat, Maid Dishes, Marchpanes, Leeches, and
    Snow, Craknels, Caudels, Cakes, Broths, Fritter-stuffe, Puddings, Tarts, Syrupes,
    and Sallets. For Medicines. To make all sorts of Poultisses, and Serecloaths for
    any member swell''d or inflamed, Ointments, Waters for all Wounds, and Cancers,
    Salves for Aches, to take the Ague out of any place Burning or Scalding; For the
    stopping of suddain Bleeding, curing the Piles, Ulcers, Ruptures, Coughs, Consumptions,
    and killing of Warts, to dissolve the Stone, killing the Ring-worme, Emroids,
    and Dropsie, Paine in the Ears and Teeth, Deafnesse.

    We begin with a truly effective medicament for the piles:

    Take a little Orpine, Hackdagger, and Elecampane, stamp them all together with
    Boares grease, into the form of an Oyntment, and lay them to the place grieved.

    Should you have any difficulty obtaining boar''s grease, I am sure the likes of
    Tesco and Sainsbury will respond to requests. Most big supermarkets now have "suggestion
    boxes", and readers are encouraged to make use of them.'
