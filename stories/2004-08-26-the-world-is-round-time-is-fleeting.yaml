  text: '"The world is round. Time is fleeting. Is man an ox? No. Is he a patent inkstand?
    No. Was he created to occupy a house and fit his head to a hat? No. Then why delay?
    Why smother your longings? I says ... this won''t do. This ain''t your destiny.
    Rise! Be winged! Chase the ideal! Get on the vastness! Seek and find." -- Arthur
    Colton, The Belted Seas'
