  text: "In the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stool. Ugo's ma said,\
    \ \u201CUgo, why are you using a pod instead of a jar?\u201D Ugo's ma was blind,\
    \ but she knew that the plop of Ugo's pod was different to the plop of his jar.\
    \ \u201COh, ma,\u201D said Ugo, \u201CMy jar is in the shed.\u201D Ugo's ma bashed\
    \ Ugo on the head. \u201CNever leave your jar in the shed, Ugo,\u201D she said,\
    \ \u201CWhen you do I will bash you on the head, as I just did.\u201D Ugo said,\
    \ \u201CSorry, ma. My pal Ulf put my jar in the shed.\u201D \u201CAh,\u201D said\
    \ Ugo's ma. On Thursday last. In a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv."
