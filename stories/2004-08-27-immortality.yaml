  text: "Devoted readers of Hooting Yard will no doubt be excited to learn that its\
    \ onlie begetter has discovered that he has been immortalised in verse. The following\
    \ is an extract from an essay entitled Owen Barfield's Poetic Diction: An Appreciation\
    \ by Caryl Johnston. Follow that link if you want to read the whole thing, or\
    \ spend some time at the Encyclopaedia Barfieldiana, if you so wish. Meanwhile,\
    \ here is the excerpt:\nThe discussion between Barfield and Lewis about truth\
    \ and meaning surfaced in the final poem of Pictures from the Speaking Stillness,\
    \ \u201CMode Conceptual.\u201D It is in two parts, and the first part is called\
    \ \u201CFrank Key.\u201D The poet stands in \u201Cturning time,\u201D locked outside\
    \ the door of spring:\n\u201COutside and gracious in the world / Flowers bloomed,\
    \ and greening; / But I behind the darkened door / Could find no name for meaning.\
    \ / It was the nameless ever moving / In the known, but from behind; / Sleeves\
    \ brushed me by, ideas\u2014/ The clothing of the mind.\u201D\nYet, there is no\
    \ relief in this brain-bound darkness\u2014the \u201Cfoldured grot,\u201D which\
    \ is an improvisation on Keats' \u201Celfin grot.\u201D The foldured grot, like\
    \ the Belle Dame Sans Merci, holds us prisoner. But someone named Frank Key comes\
    \ to the rescue:\n\u201CI felt my hand inside a key\u2014/ It lightly weighed\u2014\
    no doubt\u2014/ I turned it slowly, and again, / And Frank came to take me out.\u201D\
    \n\u201CFrank Key\u201D brings us the mystery of incarnated life: not the key\
    \ in my hand, but the hand itself the key:\n\u201C\u2018To be,\u2019 he said,\
    \ 'it turns- / It fills up to the rim---'\u201D\nThe poet receives this realization\
    \ of meaning with tangibility:\n\u201CSo there I was: while speaking / The spring\
    \ to me had fled\u2014/ Meaning bloomed from word to word\u2014/ As speaking turned,\
    \ to being said.\u201D\nThe \u201Cbeing said\u201D \u2014 the Being of Meaning,\
    \ is the essence of this Barfieldian philosophical poem. It is the world of the\
    \ Logos, of Meaning, that becomes fact, and it is this descent of meaning into\
    \ fact that the poet must attempt to capture as the truth of things.\n\nOwen Barfield,\
    \ from whose pulsating brain Frank Key sprang forth"
