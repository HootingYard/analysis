  text: "\u201CThither Dorrington followed him, gaining vigour and fury at every step.\
    \ At sight of him the wretched Mallows sank in a corner, sighing and shivering\
    \ with terror. Dorrington hauled the struggling wretch across the room, tearing\
    \ off the crepe whiskers as he came, while Mallows supplicated and whined, fearing\
    \ that it might be the other's design to imprison him in the enamelling oven.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Arthur Morrison, The Affair Of The Avalanche Bicycle & Tyre Co., Ltd.\n\
