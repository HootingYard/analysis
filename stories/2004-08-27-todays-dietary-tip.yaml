  text: 'Having got rid of your piles yesterday by smearing yourself with boar''s
    grease, it''s time for a treat. Here is a splendid snacking idea from the Book
    Of Fruits & Flowers:

    To make Printed Quidony of Quinces. Take two pound of Quinces, paired, coared,
    and cut in small pieces, and put them into a faire posnet, with a quart of faire
    water, and when they are boyled tender, put into them one pound of Sugar clarified,
    with halfe a pint of faire water, let them boyle till all the fruit fall to the
    bottom of the posnet, then let the liquid substance run through a faire linnen
    cloath into a clean bason, then put it into a posnet, and let it boyle till it
    come to a jelly, then Print it in your Moulds, and turne it into your boxes. You
    shall know when it is ready to Print, by rouling it on the back of a Spoone.'
