  text: 'Lo! In that year of torrential rainfall and storm clouds I set out from the
    city carrying with me nought but a few rags. I saw cows grazing, I heard horses
    whinnying. At the edges of farmyards I hid behind hedges. My appearance was not
    one to encourage some cherry-cheeked farmer''s wife to invite me in for a dish
    of scrambled eggs. For days on end I ate nothing but berries, or scraps of leftover
    cake from countryside wedding parties abandoned in panic after visitations from
    extraterrestrial beings dressed up in glistening metallic space-clothing and armed
    with laser guns. Everywhere I went I saw evidence of burned-out barnyards and
    terrified geese. After roaming aimlessly for about three months, I came to a city
    by the sea. I sat on a milestone and gazed at the unfamiliar skyline. Some of
    the masts of ships docked in the harbour were taller than the buildings. I fed
    a handful of crumbs to the goose that had been accompanying me for the last few
    days, and patted its eternally bobbing head. "Let us march into that city and
    be bold!" I announced to the goose, pointlessly, for it did not understand a word
    of human language, being a goose. Nevertheless, it followed me as I hoisted my
    bag of rags on to my back and strode towards the customs post on the edge of the
    city. The weather was still tempestuous. I cannot count the number of puddles
    I squelched through, nor how many squalls set that little goose a-jitter. The
    customs post, when at last we lumbered up to it, was deserted, but for a man of
    great illness lying sprawled on a pallet, whose moans took only moments to irritate
    me. Indeed, the sound of human whining, after months of solitude, set my teeth
    on edge to such an extent that I bid the goose stifle him as best it could. The
    goose sat on the sick man''s head while I rifled through the filing cabinets.
    It was at this precise moment that the press photographer bounded through the
    door and took snaps of the scene which will be familiar to you. Startled by camera
    flashes, the goose fled. I backed against the wall, ragged and, I must confess,
    wild-eyed. The sick man was transmogrified. Only now did I become aware of his
    police uniform, as he and the photographer exchanged a glance that conveyed some
    terrible significance. That is why I am writing to you from a prison cell. Thus
    far I have fed my interrogators a pack of lies, but I do not know how much longer
    I can hold out. Please, please, my darling, try as best you can to smuggle in
    a package of sellotape, soap, bleach, some pins, a map and a bale of plastic sheeting
    so that I can make good my escape!
