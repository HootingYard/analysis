  text: "Lo! In that year of torrential rainfall and storm clouds I set out from the\
    \ city carrying with me nought but a few rags. I saw cows grazing, I heard horses\
    \ whinnying. At the edges of farmyards I hid behind hedges. My appearance was\
    \ not one to encourage some cherry-cheeked farmer's wife to invite me in for a\
    \ dish of scrambled eggs. For days on end I ate nothing but berries, or scraps\
    \ of leftover cake from countryside wedding parties abandoned in panic after visitations\
    \ from extraterrestrial beings dressed up in glistening metallic space-clothing\
    \ and armed with laser guns. Everywhere I went I saw evidence of burned-out barnyards\
    \ and terrified geese. After roaming aimlessly for about three months, I came\
    \ to a city by the sea. I sat on a milestone and gazed at the unfamiliar skyline.\
    \ Some of the masts of ships docked in the harbour were taller than the buildings.\
    \ I fed a handful of crumbs to the goose that had been accompanying me for the\
    \ last few days, and patted its eternally bobbing head. \u201CLet us march into\
    \ that city and be bold!\u201D I announced to the goose, pointlessly, for it did\
    \ not understand a word of human language, being a goose. Nevertheless, it followed\
    \ me as I hoisted my bag of rags on to my back and strode towards the customs\
    \ post on the edge of the city. The weather was still tempestuous. I cannot count\
    \ the number of puddles I squelched through, nor how many squalls set that little\
    \ goose a-jitter. The customs post, when at last we lumbered up to it, was deserted,\
    \ but for a man of great illness lying sprawled on a pallet, whose moans took\
    \ only moments to irritate me. Indeed, the sound of human whining, after months\
    \ of solitude, set my teeth on edge to such an extent that I bid the goose stifle\
    \ him as best it could. The goose sat on the sick man's head while I rifled through\
    \ the filing cabinets. It was at this precise moment that the press photographer\
    \ bounded through the door and took snaps of the scene which will be familiar\
    \ to you. Startled by camera flashes, the goose fled. I backed against the wall,\
    \ ragged and, I must confess, wild-eyed. The sick man was transmogrified. Only\
    \ now did I become aware of his police uniform, as he and the photographer exchanged\
    \ a glance that conveyed some terrible significance. That is why I am writing\
    \ to you from a prison cell. Thus far I have fed my interrogators a pack of lies,\
    \ but I do not know how much longer I can hold out. Please, please, my darling,\
    \ try as best you can to smuggle in a package of sellotape, soap, bleach, some\
    \ pins, a map and a bale of plastic sheeting so that I can make good my escape!\n\
