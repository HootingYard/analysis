  text: "\nShown above are the twenty six living members of the rather eerie Blot\
    \ family. Ever since the night of the 1958 Munich Air Disaster, which wiped out\
    \ the Busby Babes, the curiously ageless Blots have remained within the confines\
    \ of the converted Pigsty Complex, just off the Blister Lane Bypass, where they\
    \ forage for food, do meteorological readings, and ponderously intone ponderous\
    \ incantations. Field recordings of the most ponderous of their incantations,\
    \ the fourteen-hour Homage \xE0 Tippi Hedren, led to a mildly successful CD release.\
    \ The Blot family are, left to right: Ajax, Blackguard, Cutty, Dismay, Elkan,\
    \ Fod, Gazeppa, Histamine, Insurgent, J\xF6rg, Kappatatap, Lynyrd, Mote, Nervewrack,\
    \ Ornamental, Pap, Quinsy, Ringworm, Salman, Tharbin, Ultravox, Vincenzo, Windigo,\
    \ Xerxes, Yolanda and Zap. Approach them, if you must, with caution, for they\
    \ are skilful catapultists and have a stockpile of pebbles to ward off strangers."
