  text: '"The sect of Jumpers was founded in the year 1760, in the county of Cornwall,
    by two fanatics, who were, even at that time, able to collect together a considerable
    party. By the use of certain unmeaning words they work themselves up into a state
    of religious frenzy, in which they seem to have scarcely any control over their
    senses. They then begin to jump with strange gestures, repeating this exercise
    with all their might until they are exhausted, so that it not unfrequently happens
    that women who, like the Maenades, practise these religious exercises, are carried
    away from the midst of them in a state of syncope, whilst the remaining members
    of the congregations, for miles together, on their way home, terrify those whom
    they meet by the sight of such demoniacal ravings." -- Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker,
    The Black Death And The Dancing Mania'
