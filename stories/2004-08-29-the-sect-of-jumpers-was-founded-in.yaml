  text: "\u201CThe sect of Jumpers was founded in the year 1760, in the county of\
    \ Cornwall, by two fanatics, who were, even at that time, able to collect together\
    \ a considerable party. By the use of certain unmeaning words they work themselves\
    \ up into a state of religious frenzy, in which they seem to have scarcely any\
    \ control over their senses. They then begin to jump with strange gestures, repeating\
    \ this exercise with all their might until they are exhausted, so that it not\
    \ unfrequently happens that women who, like the Maenades, practise these religious\
    \ exercises, are carried away from the midst of them in a state of syncope, whilst\
    \ the remaining members of the congregations, for miles together, on their way\
    \ home, terrify those whom they meet by the sight of such demoniacal ravings.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker, The Black Death And The Dancing Mania"
