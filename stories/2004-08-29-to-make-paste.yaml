  text: 'To make Paste of Almonds. Take one pound of small Almonds, blanch them out
    of hot water into cold, then dry them with a cloath, and beat them in a stone
    Morter, till they come to Past, putting now and then a spoonful of Rose water
    to them, to keep them from Oyling, when they are beaten to fine past, take halfe
    a pound of Sugar finely beaten and searsed, put it to your past, and beat it till
    it will twist between your fingers and thumb, finely without knots, for then it
    is enough, then make thereof Pyes, Birds, Fruits, Flowers, or any pretty things,
    printed with Molds, and so gild them, and put them into your Stove, and use them
    at your pleasure.
