  text: 'Chapter Eleven of Hands Up; or, Twenty Years of Detective Life in the Mountains
    and on the Plains, A Condensed Criminal History of the Far West, Reminiscences
    by General D J Cook, Superintendent of the Rocky Mountain Detective Association,
    begins:

    "In all the criminal history of Colorado--in all the register of the achievements
    of the Rocky Mountain Detective Association--the ensanguined pages show no more
    causeless, unprovoked murder than that of R B Hayward in September, 1879."

    Chapter Eleven of Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars by General
    F E Key, Superintendent of the Haemoglobin Towers Detective Association, on the
    other hand, while considerably less ensanguined, can be found by following this
    link.'
