  text: "Keats had his elfin grot, and we learned last week that Owen Barfield had\
    \ a foldured grot (see 27th August). There are a number of other grots deserving\
    \ of attention, poetic and otherwise. Gervase Beerpint's \u201Cfuming, hapless\
    \ grot\u201D springs to mind\u2014at least, to my mind\u2014as an example of a\
    \ so-called poetic grot that we really could have done without. It is the setting\
    \ for one of his earliest poems, included in Crouton As Exemplar, the collection\
    \ of Beerpint's teenage drivel which is mercifully out of print. A more appealing\
    \ poetic grot is Scrimgeour's \u201Cten-inch-tall toy plastic grot\u201D, the\
    \ abiding image from his astonishing narrative tour de force How I Lost My Bus\
    \ Pass And Found It Again Last Tuesday, Not Without Certain Hazards. For me this\
    \ is one of the greatest poems of the late 20th century, and its annual recitation\
    \ at the Hooting Yard Festival Of Texts Related To Bus Travel never fails to warm\
    \ the cockles of my heart.\nAs for non-poetic grots, who can fail to be excited\
    \ by Dobson's grot? Aloysius Nestingbird tells us:\nDobson went on one of his\
    \ \u201Cwalks\u201D, taking with him a copy of Cliff Castles And Cave Dwellings\
    \ Of Europe by Sabine Baring-Gould, which was at the time his favourite reading.\
    \ Upon his return, his brain was awash with it. \u201CI must leave this building\
    \ and find a grot in which to live out the rest of my days,\u201D he shouted,\
    \ and began poring over geological maps of the coast. All attempts to divert him\
    \ from this mania were fruitless. He thought he had identified a suitable grot,\
    \ one which was flooded by the violent incoming tide for only a few hours each\
    \ day, and began moving his belongings thither, employing a local peasant who\
    \ had a pony and trap. Only after four trips did this man demand payment from\
    \ the impoverished pamphleteer, who thrust a spare bottle of vinaigrette dressing\
    \ into his paws and begged him to continue. The peasant was understandably enraged,\
    \ and threw the bottle back at Dobson.\nDobson's next ploy was to try to convince\
    \ the railway authorities to build a new terminus within yards of his grot. They\
    \ laughed in his face. He made one attempt to make the journey by bicycle, with\
    \ a few kitchen utensils stuffed into his panniers, but his knees gave out before\
    \ he was halfway there, and he abandoned the idea as hopeless.\nWhat to do? Everything\
    \ beginning with the letters A to J that Dobson owned was stacked in cardboard\
    \ cartons in the faraway grot, subject to the relentless destructive power of\
    \ the crashing waves which, twice a day, engulfed what he still thought of as\
    \ his future home, for the peasant had ignored the instructions to suspend the\
    \ cartons by chains from several handy stalactites. Dobson calculated how much\
    \ cash he would need to take cab rides from his building to his grot, and was\
    \ appalled. Indefatigable as ever, he decided to publish a new series of tracts\
    \ on popular subjects, deluding himself that he would make enough sales to cover\
    \ the cost of regular taxi fares. Marigold Chew's printing press churned out copies\
    \ of Some Hurried Notes On Tab Hunter and Eight Things You Never Knew About Tuesday\
    \ Weld, those anomalies in the Dobson oeuvre, but to no avail. Not a single copy\
    \ was ever sold.\nThe dream came to an end on a particularly wet Tuesday in March.\
    \ Tucking another bottle of vinaigrette dressing into his pocket, Dobson went\
    \ to parley with the peasant. He bashed on the door of a tumbledown hut next to\
    \ a ditch by the canal, forcing his mouth into a queasy smile. There was no answer,\
    \ nor would there ever be an answer, for unbeknown to Dobson, the peasant had\
    \ fallen victim to ergot poisoning, gone crackers, and run amok in the purple\
    \ hills. The pamphleteer trudged home, sat with his head in his hands, drank fourteen\
    \ mugs of tea, abandoned all thought of living in his grot, and set to work on\
    \ his matchless essay Why I Do Not Live In A Grot, Elfin Or Otherwise. It was\
    \ to prove a turning point in his career.\nSource : Forgotten Corners Of Dobsoniana\
