  text: 'IT COULD HAVE ENDED there, of course: it very nearly did. I had returned
    home, the weather was balmy, my mother''s antics were fairly amusing, and two
    jaunty headstones under the shade of a crab-apple tree were the only reminder
    that Maisie and Daisy had ever existed. That very first evening I had wheedled
    the key to the booze-cellar from Scrimgeour, who, for whatever reason, was a changed
    man, a factotum I felt I could now treat on an equal footing. His old self, all
    fawns and scrapes, had vanished. Oh, he was no Brewster, and certainly no Patch,
    but he had become somehow human during my absence, to the point where he would
    even share a tot or two from a bottle of Maniac''s Water, join me in a game of
    domino-crushing, or simply wile away with me an afternoon cursing and gabbling
    and uprooting any flowers which dared to grow upon the graves of my aunts. I was
    upset that Mister Poxhaven was no longer in my mother''s employ. Often I would
    lie sprawled on a rug upon the lawn, imagining all sorts of fascinating conversations
    I could have held with that enigmatic topiarist. But he had done his work, been
    paid off with a pittance, and, according to Scrimgeour, had driven off in his
    pantechnicon one frosty October morning, never to be heard from again.

    Yes, it could have ended there, were it not for Mister Patch. He lingered on,
    a shattered and sorry wreck, surviving on a diet of slops and hawberry juice,
    devoid of speech and sleep, and given to marathon bouts of drooling which sometimes
    lasted for days on end. He suffered, too, from hideous temper tantrums, thrashing
    about on his pallet like a pinned insect, keening and whining while Scrimgeour
    and I sat with him, cradling him in our arms in pitiful attempts to give him comfort,
    tears streaming down our cheeks.

    Our finances were low, even non-existent, but whenever we could afford to we summoned
    a doctor. There was the parish physician, Dr Gabbitas; a roving specialist named
    Spreak; a quack called Owlbag-Forrester from the local hospice; Hellsmaw, a world-renowned
    authority on brains, livers and the spleen who lived in a retirement home in a
    nearby village; and half a dozen others prepared to give a "consultation" in return
    for the contents of the paper bag in which we kept our cash. One after another,
    they sighed, sadly replaced their instruments in their bags, stood up, shook their
    heads, and pronounced Mister Patch a hopeless case, suffering from a hitherto
    unknown malady. They could not cure him, they said, but if it was any solace,
    his life was not in danger. He had the constitution of a bison, and could expect
    to last another, oh, fifteen to twenty years. All sorts of medicaments were prescribed,
    in the full knowledge that none would do the least bit of good. We were stuck
    with a sort of ghost-Patch, and were, I think, expected to resign ourselves to
    the fact.

    Losing faith in the medical profession, Scrimgeour and I experimented with our
    own remedies. We force-fed Patch with coal, bran-tub scrapings, and wrens'' innards.
    We wrapped him in muslin and exposed him to the fumes from a butterscotch factory.
    Small, half-domesticated beasts of the field were introduced to the household
    and given a free run of Patch''s room. We prodded him with implements of various
    metals, both tarnished and untarnished, blunt and sharp. For a week, we had him
    lie face down in the centre of a volleyball court and regularly doused him with
    whitewash. Nothing worked.

    At the back of my brain, throughout these tormented months, nestled a conviction
    of which I could never quite rid myself. If, just once, Mister Patch could again
    slap eyes on his pre-adhesive stamp collection, then surely, surely, I thought,
    he would recover from the terrible sickness which had laid him waste. There was
    no earthly reason why this should be the case, and I would not claim any great
    understanding of psychology--or any understanding at all, come to that--but the
    thought continued to gnaw at me. Eventually, I decided to act.

    Scrimgeour was off on one of his increasingly frequent holidays. The Uncle Nobby
    episode had reawakened in him a sense of his emotional bonds with his family,
    and he now took every opportunity to visit the widely-scattered Scrimgeours, Pugdamps,
    Faddlemats and Dundercrones in their castles and hovels throughout the land. Scrimgeour''s
    kin were one of the most remarkable collections of human beings I have ever come
    across. Space precludes any further examination of them here, but the aforementioned
    Memoirs go into more detail than any sane person could even imagine: I particularly
    recommend chapters fifty seven to eighty one, and the sparkling anecdote about
    Rufus Faddlemat''s tweezer experiments in chapter ninety four.

    Where was I? Scrimgeour being on holiday, and Patch in one of his becalmed and
    vegetative states, I spent the afternoon of November the sixth rooting in the
    cellars trying to hunt down the single bottle of One-eyed Janitor''s Mop, 1913,
    which I knew remained from the original crate. When at last I emerged, clutching
    the hooch in my quivering paw, twilight was descending. I repaired to the garden,
    sat in my favourite cane chair, uncorked the bottle and, looking up at the pitiless
    firmament, took a thirsty swig. Resting the Mop in my lap, I was peering across
    at the duckpond in which my aunts had drowned, and singing a little ditty in my
    head, when my mother wafted up to me.

    "Purbin!" she cooed, although as you know this was not my name, "Look what I have
    found inside the piano!"

    Readers given to sentimentality will be pleased to hear that I had become more
    tolerant of my mother. Where once I would have spat at her, or bombarded her with
    pebbles, or pleaded with her to begone from my sight, now I pulled up a chair
    and asked her to join me.

    "What have you found, mama?" I asked, genuinely interested: she was always coming
    up with bits and scraps these days. Convinced that a crucial part of her monument-design
    had been mislaid, she had spent the last fortnight turning the house upside down
    trying to find it. In the process, all sorts of intriguing items had come to light,
    not the least of which had been a photograph of my father, dressed up as Blind
    Jack of Knaresborough, posing at the wheel of an omnibus, cross-eyed, and with
    an enormous cloth vampire bat dangling above his head. On the back of the photograph,
    someone had written: Plenty of sour [marzipan?] pies were eaten that day!

    My mother clambered into the chair in her spidery way, and shoved at me a sheet
    of paper, torn along one edge, as if it had been ripped from a book. I took it
    from her, and almost dropped the Mop-bottle from my lap. The page was covered
    with Mister Patch''s handwriting: Vug, 23rd June 18--, maroon hexagon with badly-inked
    stipples; Hoon, undated, circular emblem of oil-lantern with flags; Mins, ? March
    18--, blue triangle, slightly mildewed, with double-printed lozenge....

    I did not need to read anymore. Carefully gripping the bottle between my ankles,
    I shouted wildly at my mother.

    "Do you know what this is?"

    "It was inside the piano," she repeated, irrelevantly.

    "This is the contents page from Mister Patch''s stamp album!" I screeched.

    "Has it been chewed by a goat?" asked mama.

    "What?"

    "I didn''t know we had goats."

    She was off on one of her befuddlements: if I didn''t escape now, I''d have to
    sit and listen to her talking about goats for five or six hours. Clutching the
    treasured page in one hand and the bottle in the other, I fled towards the house,
    heading straight for the music room. My mind was racing: if one sheet torn from
    the album had been secreted inside the piano for over half a century, perhaps
    there were others which Mama had overlooked. Barging my way past harps, accordions,
    kettledrums, flageolots, ondes martenots, and harmoniums, I fell upon the piano
    with bloodhoundish wrinkles of inquiry creasing my forehead, as if I were Fig.
    I found nothing.

    Next stop, obviously, was Patch. I was convulsed by the fancy that, seeing the
    contents page, his eyes would brighten, his slobbering cease, and he would leap
    up from his blankets joyous and reborn. I scampered up the staircase towards his
    room, but froze stiff with fright half way up: there, on the landing, growling
    at me, was Flaps, one of my aunts'' horrendous hounds. None of their many dogs
    had ever liked me, but Flaps seemed to harbour a particular loathing for me, which
    had increased dreadfully since his mistresses'' demise. I was perfectly innocent
    in the matter of their deaths, but not as far as Flaps was concerned. Since my
    return home, he had done his best to make my life a misery. Scarcely a day passed
    that he did not shit in the doorway of my room. Whenever he had the opportunity,
    he nudged his way into my wardrobe, chewed gaping holes in my clothing, and carried
    off my shoes one by one, dropping them into ponds, hiding them in the coal-bunker,
    or tossing them to his fellow hounds, who tore them to shreds with their glistening
    fangs. He took particular pleasure in creeping up on me when I sat in the garden,
    knocking over a just-opened bottle of booze, then crouching at my feet, fixing
    me with a hideous stare, and deafening me with his howling.

    You will ask why I did not do away with him, and there is a one-word answer: terror.
    Remember that Flaps was not the only dog on the premises. There were dozens of
    them, and however much they might scrap and bicker among themselves, they ganged
    up with ferocious loyalty if one among them was threatened.

    One afternoon shortly after my return, I had cajoled Scrimgeour into helping me
    strangle a puppy. Do not think me cruel: the pooch was a particular favourite
    of Aunt Daisy''s, and I was rather drunk. Alright, I was very drunk. I felt cheated
    that I had not witnessed the drownings of those frightful monsters: I had wanted
    so much to do the job myself, to push them under with my bare hands. And, as is
    the way when one is gripped by such a mood, the fancy took me to re-enact their
    deaths. The puppy seemed a heaven-sent substitute.

    "Listen here, Agagmenomnomon," I slurred, "The little pest will put up a fight.
    The best thing to do is strangle it first, then plunge it into the dupcond. Duckpond.
    It''s the only way."

    "May I advise against that course of action?" said Scrimgeour. He no longer called
    me "sir", but at times like these he would unleash his retainery tones, knowing,
    I suppose, that they would give me pause. He was a caution, that Scrimgeour.

    "Stop being all obsquious," I shouted.

    "Is obsequious the word you''re looking for?" he parried. I tripped over a clump
    of furze and struggled to my feet with difficulty.

    "Shutup and come with me," I said, and dragged a reluctant Scrimgeour towards
    the kennels. I was counting on the puppy to be asleep, so it was somewhat disconcerting
    to find it frolicking happily, chasing an invisible quarry, accompanied by three
    or four full-grown companions--a Doberman Pinscher, I think, and some mastiffs.
    Scrimgeour tried once again to bring me to my senses, but I was in the grip of
    demons. I bore down on the puppy, ignoring its larger playmates, and attempted
    to grab it. My coordination, of course, was hopelessly adrift, and I succeeded
    only in banging my shin on a tree-stump. The puppy skipped easily away, but it
    had seen the glazed venom in my eyes, sensed danger, and within seconds had, dog-like,
    communicated this telepathically to its fellows. Within seconds, a mastiff had
    lunged for my throat, while the Doberman began tearing at my trouser-leg. Good
    old Scrimgeour entered the fray kicking and flailing his arms in a menacing manner,
    and managed to drag me away. We fled across the lawn, to the sound of yelps and
    growls. I did not feel safe until I was back inside the house.

    Ever since, I had avoided the dogs whenever possible. I hatched innumerable, hopeless
    schemes to do away with all of them in a single, instantaneous act of obliteration,
    none of which was remotely practicable. Now I found myself face to face with the
    terrifying vision of Flaps. I stood paralysed, half way up the stairs, the remnant
    of Mister Patch''s stamp album dangling from my hand.

    You will already have guessed what happened next. The hellhound leaped towards
    me, caught the sheet of paper in his fangs, tore it from my grasp, and scampered
    off down the staircase and away. Cursing, I started to follow it, but it was out
    of sight within seconds. I sat down at the foot of the stairs and let visions
    of maniacal vengeance wash across my brain. After a while, I got up and went to
    the telephone. Before leaving the previous day, Scrimgeour had given me a number
    where I might reach him. I dialled it.
