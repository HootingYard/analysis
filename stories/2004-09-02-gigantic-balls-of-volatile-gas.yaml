  text: 'Have you, or someone you know, got a great anecdote about gigantic balls
    of volatile gas? Why not share it with our readers? At one time or another, all
    of us have been confronted by unimaginably vast orbs of gas, glowing perhaps,
    or even pulsating eerily, as if about to explode, unleashing destruction and doom.
    It seems a shame to keep your experience to yourself. Perhaps you were traumatised,
    and begin to gibber and drool when recollecting what happened? Or maybe you have
    tried to shut out the memory entirely, so that only in your nightmares do you
    revisit the scene? Whatever your own way of dealing with monstrous, bright, spherical
    gas phenomena, we will be pleased to hear from you. The most riveting submissions
    will be collected in a forthcoming Hooting Yard anthology, for which we have already
    signed up Perry Como to write the preface. Some readers will be aware that Mr
    Como unfortunately crossed to the Other Side on 18th May 2001. He will be dictating
    his preface, via an angel, to a spirit medium yet to be appointed (possibly Yoko
    Ono)..
