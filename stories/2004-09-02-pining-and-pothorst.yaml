  text: "The continent of America takes its name from Amerigo Vespucci, but here at\
    \ Hooting Yard we have decided to promote the case for Dietrich Pining and Hans\
    \ Pothorst. Sixteen years before Columbus, this pair of roguish German pirates\
    \ may well have been the first Europeans to set foot in the New World, alongside\
    \ Johannes Scolnus, a Polish seafarer who may or may not have existed in the first\
    \ place. Wily Dietrich and Hans kept getting chased further north by the Danes,\
    \ and they regularly sailed to Greenland to be piratical. It is thought they may\
    \ have accidentally blundered ashore in Labrador in 1476. Whether they did or\
    \ not, the United States of Pining And Pothorst Land seems to me to be a far more\
    \ evocative name than the United States of America, so that is how we shall henceforth\
    \ refer to it.\nIncidentally, some years after this voyage, Pining and Pothorst\
    \ settled on a rock called Hvitsark, some way off the coast of Iceland. According\
    \ to Olaus Magnus, Archbishop of Uppsala, in his Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus\
    \ (Rome, 1555), \u201Cthey lived there outlawed with their fellow-rovers and inflicted\
    \ many atrocities on every seafarer, whether sailing close at hand or at a distance\u201D\
    , and built a lead compass atop the rock to help them in determining the shortest\
    \ direction to go in their \u201Cprofitable plundering forays.\u201D This compass\
    \ can be seen in the superb map of Scandinavia made by Olaus in 1539 and published,\
    \ as luck would have it, in \xDClm. The map, together with exciting details, and\
    \ much other pleasurable material, can be visited by clicking on this small section\
    \ of it below, where Pining and Pothorsts's compass is indicated by that circle\
    \ about a third of the way down on the left hand side, to the west of Iceland.\n"
