  text: 'Bob Drake writes with exciting news:

    I opened the Bible (it fell open somewhere in Daniel) and the next nearest book
    (The Hounds of Tindalos by Frank Belknap Long) which opened somewhere in The Space
    Eaters. Folded a couple pages together and read:

    "I screamed and slashed hard as iron; as iron that shatters, and the horse didn''t
    need anything. It will crush and break before I could throw the liver".'
