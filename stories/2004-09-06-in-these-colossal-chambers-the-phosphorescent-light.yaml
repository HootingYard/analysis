  text: '"In these colossal chambers the phosphorescent light from enormous radiators
    beats incessantly through and through the slowly oscillating, vibrating, revolving
    soul matter. And here the process of individualization is achieved. A soul, or
    many souls, are separated from the great tide, by flashing, under the bombardment
    of the phosphorescent blaze into shining forms. They assume a shape outlined by
    light, and just slightly subject to gravity from the atomic compression necessary
    to maintain their illumination, they fall lightly out from the domes of the spheres,
    touch the floors beneath, and are led away. In this way I found later I had arrived
    at Mars."--L P Gratacap, The Certainty Of A Future Life In Mars'
