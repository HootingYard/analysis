  text: "\u201CIn these colossal chambers the phosphorescent light from enormous radiators\
    \ beats incessantly through and through the slowly oscillating, vibrating, revolving\
    \ soul matter. And here the process of individualization is achieved. A soul,\
    \ or many souls, are separated from the great tide, by flashing, under the bombardment\
    \ of the phosphorescent blaze into shining forms. They assume a shape outlined\
    \ by light, and just slightly subject to gravity from the atomic compression necessary\
    \ to maintain their illumination, they fall lightly out from the domes of the\
    \ spheres, touch the floors beneath, and are led away. In this way I found later\
    \ I had arrived at Mars.\u201C\u2014L P Gratacap, The Certainty Of A Future Life\
