  text: "Be it known that the said Curpin has confessed to the following bad, bad\
    \ deeds: abnormal behaviour in the botanical gardens; bamboozlement of the grossest\
    \ kind; clutching a bag of spangles in his sweaty fist; dental irregularities;\
    \ employment of those given to gurgling; forging railway timetables; glowing in\
    \ the dark; hooting at inelegant farmyard animals; implacable dribbling; jumping\
    \ off wooden crates; knitting a balaclava; leaning against a zoo; malfeasance\
    \ in a charnel-house; not paying his bus fare; oddly-laced boots; pouring forth\
    \ incandescent light; quietude on a bandstand in a park; rooting about in the\
    \ muck; skulking in doorways; taradiddle and ergot; uprooting foliage with his\
    \ teeth; virulent infection spraying; wiggling unnecessarily; x-raying entire\
    \ continents without permission; yodelling aboard a tractor; a zest for crumpled\
    \ and bristly things.\nIn mitigation, it should be said that Curpin has suffered\
    \ tortures best left to the imagination, drawn his breath in shaking sobs, turned\
    \ the animals loose, and has a power that men know not. He held the boards for\
    \ seven terrible weeks. He burned fish. Approaching the startled cellists, he\
    \ was seen grinding the pressure ridges, smashing great blocks of ice. He did\
    \ not have time to rest. At the corral, under some sheaves of oats, and very snugly\
    \ wrapped, he dropped his biscuit. Soon, he was dreaming of all sorts of extraordinary\
    \ things. I saw him lift a man by the seat of government, rub down his horse,\
    \ and feed him apples. He even went so far as to hire a top-rig buggy to take\
    \ a little spin along the banks of foreign streams, procuring big booty and professing\
    \ to be a detective! It was, indeed, a wild sabbath night. Curpin was furious\
    \ with rage\u2014one foot upon the iron rail, an enormous net of steel, and his\
    \ pack-pony became visible. The time of winter dog travel was now approaching.\
    \ The earth, gritty and metallic, could have bidden a gondola. Living rooms flanked\
    \ the peristyle, and webs of incandescent tubular lamps shone ahead of the damp,\
    \ grey relics. Curpin tracked down reports of locust swarms. He honked twice,\
    \ slipped beneath the sea, went to work on a huge pile of food, and tore up lettuce,\
    \ his pouch unfolding. His rattling became a sizzling. Even the nearby gravel-crushers\
    \ were keenly aware of Curpin's bone finger ring, embedded in mud. Gently, in\
    \ order not to raise great clouds of ooze, he blocked its incredible roped sledge\
    \ and ox-hoof. Caught in a fish-hook curve, or pumped into the expensive crates,\
    \ he touched up the ginger fa\xE7ade, decked his troublesome horse, and tampered\
    \ no more with the tin roof. In fear and chaos, under a bridge or a water-tower,\
    \ he became dusty blue with age. Like a sheet. Like rugs. Like concrete piles\
    \ driven, and steel strung. Drying hazelnuts, this evil man on a screened porch\
    \ with a syrup bottle provided by his hostess punched, drilled, and reached a\
    \ fine convenient perch. He clapped a boatswain's whistle to his lips, straddling\
    \ the opposite slope, but his heart was seized by poisonous timber. In a modest\
    \ salt-box structure of leaded casements, he brewed a big kettle of quahog berry\
    \ candles, safely past rocks made incongruous by a regatta in a dying wind, their\
    \ examples of restoration one wooden thumb, with left foot thrust forward, and\
    \ in summer often charmless. To converse with distant sheep, Curpin thundered\
    \ past burning heather. He liked it better than mealy primrose. Blown by an icy\
    \ blizzard, he had been trying out hemp and its by-products, twine, matting and\
    \ sacks. On the lawn, the seeming anachronism of Curpin's indigenous cable plate\
    \ softened the blue invalid jetty. He placed the wire cone with its point aimed\
    \ at strewn torrents and a rack-and-pinion railway, harder, rarefied, tremendous.\
    \ On the Seminole, formidable enough. For Curpin, it was the end."
