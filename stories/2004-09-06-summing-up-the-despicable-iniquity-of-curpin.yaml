  text: 'Be it known that the said Curpin has confessed to the following bad, bad
    deeds: abnormal behaviour in the botanical gardens; bamboozlement of the grossest
    kind; clutching a bag of spangles in his sweaty fist; dental irregularities; employment
    of those given to gurgling; forging railway timetables; glowing in the dark; hooting
    at inelegant farmyard animals; implacable dribbling; jumping off wooden crates;
    knitting a balaclava; leaning against a zoo; malfeasance in a charnel-house; not
    paying his bus fare; oddly-laced boots; pouring forth incandescent light; quietude
    on a bandstand in a park; rooting about in the muck; skulking in doorways; taradiddle
    and ergot; uprooting foliage with his teeth; virulent infection spraying; wiggling
    unnecessarily; x-raying entire continents without permission; yodelling aboard
    a tractor; a zest for crumpled and bristly things.

    In mitigation, it should be said that Curpin has suffered tortures best left to
    the imagination, drawn his breath in shaking sobs, turned the animals loose, and
    has a power that men know not. He held the boards for seven terrible weeks. He
    burned fish. Approaching the startled cellists, he was seen grinding the pressure
    ridges, smashing great blocks of ice. He did not have time to rest. At the corral,
    under some sheaves of oats, and very snugly wrapped, he dropped his biscuit. Soon,
    he was dreaming of all sorts of extraordinary things. I saw him lift a man by
    the seat of government, rub down his horse, and feed him apples. He even went
    so far as to hire a top-rig buggy to take a little spin along the banks of foreign
    streams, procuring big booty and professing to be a detective! It was, indeed,
    a wild sabbath night. Curpin was furious with rage--one foot upon the iron rail,
    an enormous net of steel, and his pack-pony became visible. The time of winter
    dog travel was now approaching. The earth, gritty and metallic, could have bidden
    a gondola. Living rooms flanked the peristyle, and webs of incandescent tubular
    lamps shone ahead of the damp, grey relics. Curpin tracked down reports of locust
    swarms. He honked twice, slipped beneath the sea, went to work on a huge pile
    of food, and tore up lettuce, his pouch unfolding. His rattling became a sizzling.
    Even the nearby gravel-crushers were keenly aware of Curpin''s bone finger ring,
    embedded in mud. Gently, in order not to raise great clouds of ooze, he blocked
    its incredible roped sledge and ox-hoof. Caught in a fish-hook curve, or pumped
    into the expensive crates, he touched up the ginger facade, decked his troublesome
    horse, and tampered no more with the tin roof. In fear and chaos, under a bridge
    or a water-tower, he became dusty blue with age. Like a sheet. Like rugs. Like
    concrete piles driven, and steel strung. Drying hazelnuts, this evil man on a
    screened porch with a syrup bottle provided by his hostess punched, drilled, and
    reached a fine convenient perch. He clapped a boatswain''s whistle to his lips,
    straddling the opposite slope, but his heart was seized by poisonous timber. In
    a modest salt-box structure of leaded casements, he brewed a big kettle of quahog
    berry candles, safely past rocks made incongruous by a regatta in a dying wind,
    their examples of restoration one wooden thumb, with left foot thrust forward,
    and in summer often charmless. To converse with distant sheep, Curpin thundered
    past burning heather. He liked it better than mealy primrose. Blown by an icy
    blizzard, he had been trying out hemp and its by-products, twine, matting and
    sacks. On the lawn, the seeming anachronism of Curpin''s indigenous cable plate
    softened the blue invalid jetty. He placed the wire cone with its point aimed
    at strewn torrents and a rack-and-pinion railway, harder, rarefied, tremendous.
    On the Seminole, formidable enough. For Curpin, it was the end.'
