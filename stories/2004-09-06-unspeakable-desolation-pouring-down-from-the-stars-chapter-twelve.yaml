  text: "I SUPPOSE IT WAS stupid of me to expect Scrimgeour to answer the telephone\
    \ himself: he was, after all, staying as a guest with one or other offshoot of\
    \ his family. Nonetheless, I was disconcerted when the voice at the other end\
    \ of the line yapped at me in a foreign tongue.\n\u201CEr, I\u2019d like to speak\
    \ to Agamemnon Scrimgeour, please,\u201D I said, as politely as I know how. The\
    \ voice said something like \u201Cick\u201D or \u201Cack\u201D, so, after clearing\
    \ my throat, I repeated my request. There was a sort of scuffling at the other\
    \ end, followed by what I could only imagine to be the racket made by a flock\
    \ of auks being hosed down by a powerful jet of water.\n\u201CHello?\u201D I said.\n\
    \u201CHello?\u201D This new voice was an almost inaudible croak: it was not Scrimgeour.\
    \ Once again I asked to speak to him. There was a long silence, although it was\
    \ clear that the croaker was still there, hanging on to the phone, breathing rather\
    \ heavily. I let half a minute pass before prompting him, or her. Or, knowing\
    \ Scrimgeour's family, it.\n\u201CAre you there?\u201D I asked, loudly, as if\
    \ I were acting in a bad play.\n\u201CHello?\u201D the croaker recroaked. I sensed\
    \ that this conversation was going to last a long time, and decided to make myself\
    \ comfortable.\n\u201CWait there,\u201D I commanded. The previous week, for reasons\
    \ best known to herself, my mother had had the house's one telephone removed to\
    \ a damp, bare room no bigger than a cupboard, accessible only by clambering through\
    \ the jungle of gigantic, spiny, poisonous foliage which she thought of as her\
    \ \u201Cconservatory\u201D. Peering out of the telephone room into the dripping\
    \ heat, I wondered where I might find a couple of cushions or pillows upon which\
    \ to recline. I resolved to head west, towards the long-abandoned nursery. Before\
    \ I did so, I picked up the telephone again.\n\u201CWait,\u201D I repeated, \u201C\
    I\u2019ll be back in a couple of minutes.\u201D\nIn truth, some five or six minutes\
    \ elapsed during my foray to the nursery, in which time I incurred a variety of\
    \ scrapes, scratches and lacerations from mama's specimens of gruesome flora.\
    \ Sweat was pouring off me as I collapsed back into the dingy confines of the\
    \ telephone room, and I dared not dwell upon the maladies to which I would succumb\
    \ as deadly plant-poisons worked their way into my bloodstream. Hurling my armful\
    \ of nursery cushions on to the floor, I sank down on them, and picked up the\
    \ receiver.\n\u201CI\u2019m back,\u201D I announced.\n\u201CIck?\u201D came the\
    \ reply.\n\u201CGet me Agamemnon Scrimgeour at once!\u201D I cried, \u201CTell\
    \ him it's a matter of life and death!\u201D\n\u201CAck?\u201D\nHm. The croaker\
    \ had obviously given up on me. He, she, or it had at least spoken my own language.\
    \ I tried out a variety of phrases designed to impress upon my interlocutor that\
    \ I wished to speak to \u201Cthe croaking one\u201D. Eventually, at my umpteenth\
    \ attempt, something worked. There was a final \u201Cick\u201D, another scuffle,\
    \ further dousing of auks, and, at last, a different and intelligible voice, a\
    \ new one again, urgent and interrogatory.\n\u201CHello? Hello? Hello?\u201D\n\
    \u201CAh, hello,\u201D I replied, all suave, \u201CMay I speak to Agamemnon Scrimgeour\
    \ please?\u201D\n\u201CWhich one?\u201D\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\u201CWhich Agamemnon\
    \ Scrimgeour do you wish to speak to?\u201D\nI had had many long talks with Scrimgeour\
    \ about his family, but he had never let drop that he shared his cognomen with\
    \ another.\n\u201CI didn't know there were two of them,\u201D I said.\n\u201C\
    Actually, there are eight,\u201D came the reply, \u201COf whom I am one. Now,\
    \ which one is it you wish to speak to?\u201D\nEight Agamemnons in one family?\
    \ It didn't bear thinking about. I was so startled that I had difficulty summoning\
    \ up any distinguishing features of the Agamemnon I knew.\n\u201CAh,\u201D I said\
    \ at last, \u201CThe one with a metal plate in his skull.\u201D\nThere was a pause.\n\
    \u201CThat narrows it down to five of us. At least we have established that you\
    \ do not wish to speak to me.\u201D\nI thought for a moment.\n\u201CMy name is\
    \ Zoltan Mingbike,\u201D I said, using another anagram, but one with which I knew\
    \ Scrimgeour\u2014my Scrimgeour\u2014would be familiar, \u201CHe works for me.\u201D\
    \n\u201CWait there,\u201D said the Scrimgeour at the other end. I plumped up my\
    \ cushions and wished I had brought a hefty bottle of Fin de Siecle Moustachio\
    \ with me. A minute or two later, the Scrimgeour was back.\n\u201CThere are four\
    \ Agamemnon Scrimgeours here who claim to work for someone using your name,\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CThree of whom have metal plates in their skulls.\u201D I was\
    \ astounded. \u201CWe're getting there,\u201D he continued, encouragingly. I think\
    \ I have mentioned earlier that my patience is inhuman. However.\n\u201CNow look\
    \ here!\u201D I yelled, \u201CI cannot believe that Zoltan Mingbikes are as common\
    \ as, as, as Agawhatever Scrimgeours, let alone that they all seem to work for\
    \ each other! Stop your piddling and get me Scrimgeour this instant!\u201D This\
    \ was an ill-measured little outburst, as I now realise, and did me not one whit\
    \ of good with the Scrimgeour to whom I was speaking.\n\u201CIf, sirrah, you wish\
    \ to speak to Agamemnon Scrimgeour,\u201D he said, \u201CYou would do well not\
    \ to give vent to such rudery. I shall give you ten seconds. If, in that time,\
    \ you have not apologised, I shall hang up.\u201D Such was my frazzlement that\
    \ I let nine seconds elapse before, sheepishly, I blathered a few sorry mumblings.\n\
    \u201CVery well. Thank you,\u201D said Agamemnon Scrimgeour. \u201CLet us proceed.\
    \ We are down to a shortlist of three. What else can you tell me about the Agamemnon\
    \ you wish to speak to?\u201D\n\u201CHe has a crestfallen air about him.\u201D\
    \ There was a sound of wry chuckling from the other end.\n\u201COh, so have we\
    \ all,\u201D said the Scrimgeour, \u201CSo have we all. It's a family trait.\u201D\
    \n\u201CI see,\u201D I replied, chastened, \u201CUm. I live in a large mansion\
    \ on the coast. Agamemnon helps me to care for a shattered retainer named Mister\
    \ Patch. We sometimes play ping-pong of an afternoon.\u201D\n\u201CYes?\u201D\n\
    \u201CWell isn't that enough?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CDo you know his middle name,\
    \ shoe size, or the width of his girth?\u201D\n\u201CEh?\u201D\n\u201CHas he had\
    \ pulmonary thrombosis?\u201D\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry. I was\
    \ codding you. Wait a moment and I\u2019ll get him.\u201D\nWhile I waited I picked\
    \ my teeth. After an age, the same bloody Scrimgeour returned to the telephone.\n\
    \u201CHello?\u201D\n\u201CYes yes yes?\u201D I rapped. What was the problem now?\n\
    \u201CI\u2019m afraid your Agamemnon has had a little accident,\u201D he said,\
    \ \u201CApparently, he got trapped in a wind tunnel this morning, and has become\
    \ temporarily deaf.\u201D\nI was having none of this. Larding my tones with pomposity,\
    \ I suggested to the speaker that he could act as an intermediary: his role would\
    \ be to communicate my words to Agamemnon by sign language, or by writing them\
    \ down, and, by reversing the process, give me the other side of the conversation.\n\
    \u201CHm,\u201D he replied after a pause, \u201CI\u2019m afraid that won't be\
    \ possible. Your Agamemnon is abed, bandaged and sedated. You see, trapped with\
    \ him in the wind tunnel was an enormous bittern which, in its panic, injured\
    \ him rather badly.\u201D\n\u201CWell, is he half-way conscious?\u201D I demanded.\n\
    \u201COh yes, the sedatives are only mild ones. But, you see, Aunt Pansy was doing\
    \ one of her little experiments at the time, and unfortunately a small amount\
    \ of her nerve gas seeped into the wind tunnel, causing Agamemnon to suffer a\
    \ complete memory loss. It is truly remarkable, as if his brain has been simply\
    \ wiped clean. Pansy assures us that luckily, like the deafness, this total amnesia\
    \ is only temporary.\u201D It was a very pretty speech, but it left me at a complete\
    \ loss. I gnashed my teeth.\n\u201CYou sound as if you are gnashing your teeth,\u201D\
    \ said the Scrimgeour. \u201CIt must be very frustrating for you. However, I do\
    \ have some good news. Just now, when I went upstairs to check on Agamemnon's\
    \ condition, I took the opportunity to rifle through the pockets of his smoking-jacket,\
    \ and came upon a scrunched-up scrap of paper which looks very much like the beginning\
    \ of a letter. I\u2019m something of a dab hand at anagrams, and at a guess I\u2019\
    d say the letter is addressed to you, Zoltan. Would you like me to read it to\
    \ you?\u201D\n\u201CBy all the minnows in the biggest of ponds, yes, yes!\u201D\
    \ I cried.\n\u201CRight. As I say, it's only the beginning of a letter. It stops\
    \ in mid-sentence, actually, but-\u201D\n\u201CJust get on with it!\u201D I roared.\n\
    \u201CKeep on like that and I\u2019ll have to put mufflers in my ears,\u201D said\
    \ the Scrimgeour. I apologised again.\n\u201CNow, let me see. Dear Tolzna, it\
    \ says, I am having a tremendously exciting little holiday, but not a minute passes\
    \ without my thinking of you and poor Mister Patch. I know that you are still\
    \ determined to hunt down that album of his, and I have to concede that to do\
    \ so may be the only way to reanimate him: lord knows we have tried everything\
    \ else. Aunt Pansy tells me of a terrific private investigator who is by all accounts\
    \ a match for the late, great Fig: her name is Matilda Spamclot. When you set\
    \ me the task of finding a Fig-substitute, I overlooked her because- and that's\
    \ it, I\u2019m afraid. Does it make any sense to you?\u201D\nI thanked him profusely\
    \ and slammed down the receiver: which was rather foolish of me. I stood there\
    \ in the sopping heat, feeling all resolute, and consciously setting my jawline\
    \ into a determined, heroic jut. Then I realised that I didn't have a clue what\
    \ to do next. How was I to track down Matilda Spamclot? Was she indeed possessed\
    \ of the same mettle as Fig? Why had the almost insanely thorough Scrimgeour overlooked\
    \ her? How much would she charge to tackle what appeared to be such a hopeless\
    \ quest? Even if she succeeded, would my theory prove correct? Would Mister Patch\
    \ be revivified at the sight of a mouldering album full of fading pre-adhesive\
    \ postage stampings? My mulling over these questions was interrupted by a hammering\
    \ at the front door. Without Scrimgeour to do his bit, and assuming that my mother\
    \ was floating about somewhere in the house fixated on her whims, I hurried down\
    \ to answer it. Opening the door, I was confronted by a whey-faced young woman\
    \ in a wheelchair, clutching in her lap a cardboard box barely held together by\
    \ yards and yards of inexpertly-tied string.\n\u201CHello there,\u201D she said\
    \ in an exhausted voice, \u201CYou must be Zinnigmot Blake.\u201D\n\u201CI am\
    \ he,\u201D I replied, after the briefest of pauses to do a mental anagram-check:\
    \ I had not heard this one before, but I found it rather pleasing. \u201CAnd who,\
    \ might I ask, are you?\u201D\nShe cleared her throat and spat a gobbet onto the\
    \ gravel.\n\u201CThey call me Matilda Spamclot,\u201D she announced.\nChapter\
