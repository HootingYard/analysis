  text: "Sir : Idly perusing your website the other day, I couldn't help but be reminded\
    \ of the time when I was trapped in a wind tunnel with an enormous bittern, having\
    \ wandered in there by accident while attempting to draw badgers with my Dachshund\
    \ (see cutting reproduced below). Perhaps I should have used a pencil instead?\
    \ Yours amicably, Max D\xE9charn\xE9 of That Ilk\n"
