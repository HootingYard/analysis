  text: 'Sir : Idly perusing your website the other day, I couldn''t help but be reminded
    of the time when I was trapped in a wind tunnel with an enormous bittern, having
    wandered in there by accident while attempting to draw badgers with my Dachshund
    (see cutting reproduced below). Perhaps I should have used a pencil instead? Yours
    amicably, Max Decharne of That Ilk
