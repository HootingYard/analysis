  text: '"He appears occasionally on the scene, generally entrusted with some death-dealing
    commission, which he proceeds, scymeter in hand, or provided with bag, cord, box,
    or poison, to execute; we follow his actions with awe; when he disappears we know
    no more of him--his further life is shrouded in mystery." -- G Carter Stent, Chinese
    Eunuchs'
