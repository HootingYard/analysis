  text: "For a few days now I have found myself preoccupied with sheds, or more particularly\
    \ the kind of sheds Madame Blavatsky had in mind when she wrote those lines that\
    \ appeared as our quote of the day last Thursday (see 2nd September). \u201CA\
    \ few wooden sheds being constructed,\u201D you will recall the wily old Theosophist\
    \ wrote, \u201Cfor meteorological, astronomical and magnetic purposes\u2026\u201D\
    \ The first two don't bother me particularly, but I have been wondering how to\
    \ build a wooden shed for \u201Cmagnetic purposes\u201D. Does that mean simply\
    \ a shed with a magnet in it? Or a shed built out of planks in which magnets have\
    \ somehow been embedded, perhaps by banging them into the weave of the wood with\
    \ a hammer? Or should that be the weft of the wood? Ought I consult the dictionary\
    \ regarding weft and rewrite the preceding sentences? Is \u201Ca shed for magnetic\
    \ purposes\u201D the same thing as \u201Ca magnetic shed\u201D? Whether it is\
    \ or not, and assuming I have managed to build it, how does it work? Given that\
    \ Madame Blavatsky was writing, if you remember, From The Polar Lands, are we\
    \ just talking about compasses here? Wouldn't it be easier to use a compass than\
    \ to build a wooden shed for magnetic purposes? Or is it all a lot more complicated\
    \ and beyond my poor puny pea-sized brain? Does it matter what kind of wood I\
    \ use? Should I concern myself with the size of the shed, and its proportion in\
    \ relation to the size and/or power of the magnet or magnets? This whole business\
    \ is driving me crackers. It's not easy being the editor of Hooting Yard sometimes.\
    \ \u201CChrist, you know it ain't easy,\u201D as that John Lennon used to wail,\
    \ even though he'd already met Yoko Ono by then, so he really should have known\
    \ better.\n\nLeft : Helena Blavatsky. Right : Yoko Ono. One of them wrote a book\
    \ called Grapefruit"
