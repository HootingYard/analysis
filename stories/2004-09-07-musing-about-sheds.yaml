  text: 'For a few days now I have found myself preoccupied with sheds, or more particularly
    the kind of sheds Madame Blavatsky had in mind when she wrote those lines that
    appeared as our quote of the day last Thursday (see 2nd September). "A few wooden
    sheds being constructed," you will recall the wily old Theosophist wrote, "for
    meteorological, astronomical and magnetic purposes..." The first two don''t bother
    me particularly, but I have been wondering how to build a wooden shed for "magnetic
    purposes". Does that mean simply a shed with a magnet in it? Or a shed built out
    of planks in which magnets have somehow been embedded, perhaps by banging them
    into the weave of the wood with a hammer? Or should that be the weft of the wood?
    Ought I consult the dictionary regarding weft and rewrite the preceding sentences?
    Is "a shed for magnetic purposes" the same thing as "a magnetic shed"? Whether
    it is or not, and assuming I have managed to build it, how does it work? Given
    that Madame Blavatsky was writing, if you remember, From The Polar Lands, are
    we just talking about compasses here? Wouldn''t it be easier to use a compass
    than to build a wooden shed for magnetic purposes? Or is it all a lot more complicated
    and beyond my poor puny pea-sized brain? Does it matter what kind of wood I use?
    Should I concern myself with the size of the shed, and its proportion in relation
    to the size and/or power of the magnet or magnets? This whole business is driving
    me crackers. It''s not easy being the editor of Hooting Yard sometimes. "Christ,
    you know it ain''t easy," as that John Lennon used to wail, even though he''d
    already met Yoko Ono by then, so he really should have known better.
