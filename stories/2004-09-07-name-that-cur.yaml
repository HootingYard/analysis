  text: 'One of the most common misconceptions in the world of cur-nomenclature is
    the idea that many dogs bear the name Fido because its Latin meaning (I trust
    or I am faithful) has some bearing on perceptions of canine personality. Dobson,
    for one, saw through this nonsense, as he explained in his out-of-print pamphlet
    On The Naming Of Curs As Fido : A Stern Corrective. He wrote:

    What never seems to occur to people is that there is not one single recorded instance
    of any dog being called Fido prior to World War II*. This stark fact alone is
    surely all the evidence any rational person needs to realise that dogs are named
    Fido in honour of the Petroleum Warfare Department''s successful development of
    the "fog, intensive dispersal of" system, otherwise known as FIDO. I cannot be
    bothered to go into the details of how, in 1944, boffins managed to make mist
    and fog vanish, for all the world like mediaeval magicians, but they did, God
    knows they did. Furthermore, the connection between dogs and fog is well known,
    as anyone who has studied some of my earlier pamphlets will know.


    A fairly standard type of cur

    * NOTE : Much as one admires the magisterial tone of Dobson''s pronouncement,
    he is, of course, quite mistaken.'
