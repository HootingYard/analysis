  text: "Some while ago I had cause to mention the new fad for appointing Tsars (see\
    \ 28 July). Another word which seems to hold our leaders in its thrall is \u201C\
    hub\u201D. I live near a hub, apparently, or at least a hub-to-be, though quite\
    \ when official hubdom is to be conferred on it is uncertain. Perhaps the most\
    \ preposterous use of the word in its new senseless sense is one I heard on the\
    \ television news yesterday. Those places where children go to be educated will\
    \ no longer be known by that fuddy-duddy term \u201Cschools\u201D in bright new\
    \ Britain\u2026 no, they will become \u201Ccommunity hubs\u201D. Let's hope Alice\
    \ Cooper can be persuaded to release an updated Community Hub's Out. Onward and\
    \ upward!"
