  text: Some while ago I had cause to mention the new fad for appointing Tsars (see
    28 July). Another word which seems to hold our leaders in its thrall is "hub".
    I live near a hub, apparently, or at least a hub-to-be, though quite when official
    hubdom is to be conferred on it is uncertain. Perhaps the most preposterous use
    of the word in its new senseless sense is one I heard on the television news yesterday.
    Those places where children go to be educated will no longer be known by that
    fuddy-duddy term "schools" in bright new Britain... no, they will become "community
    hubs". Let's hope Alice Cooper can be persuaded to release an updated Community
    Hub's Out. Onward and upward!
