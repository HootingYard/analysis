  text: "\u201CWhile the Bastard dashed to the window, the barber considerately helped\
    \ little Blanche to her feet; and since Blanche d'Ovrebreuc, Vicomtesse d'Acy,\
    \ was a religious soul, she wiped her mouth and her husband's face with her Picardy\
    \ hood, placed it over his swollen face, and recited in her childish voice three\
    \ Our Fathers and one Hail Mary, amid the yelling of the Bastard's men, who were\
    \ busy ransacking the coffers.\u201D \u2014 Marcel Schwob, Bloody Blanche"
