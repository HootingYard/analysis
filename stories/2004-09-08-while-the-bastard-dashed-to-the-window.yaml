  text: '"While the Bastard dashed to the window, the barber considerately helped
    little Blanche to her feet; and since Blanche d''Ovrebreuc, Vicomtesse d''Acy,
    was a religious soul, she wiped her mouth and her husband''s face with her Picardy
    hood, placed it over his swollen face, and recited in her childish voice three
    Our Fathers and one Hail Mary, amid the yelling of the Bastard''s men, who were
    busy ransacking the coffers." -- Marcel Schwob, Bloody Blanche'
