  text: 'Dobson was a man of words rather than images, but he had a lifelong interest
    in the cinema. Long after the words "film" and "movie" had become common parlance,
    Dobson insisted on referring to "photoplays". He used to get all het up that he
    was never invited to vote in those critics'' polls of the best films of all time,
    and once held a candlelit vigil outside the British Film Institute as a protest.
    It is said that he was regularly arrested for impersonating Ray Milland at seaside
    resorts, though this is probably one of those stories that get bandied about by
    mischief makers. In all the millions of words he wrote, however, Dobson had almost
    nothing to say on the subject of cinema, save for a throwaway remark towards the
    end of his essay Six Types Of Snodgrass Implement, where he writes: "without any
    doubt the greatest film of all time is Blue Demon Y Las Seductoras".
