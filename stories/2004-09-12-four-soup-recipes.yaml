    Fu Man-chu, no relation to Sax Rohmer''s fictional villain.

    Soup for the morning. Hot, clear broth flavoured with wheat-husks, celery, saffron
    and minnows.

    Soup for lunchtime. A thick and lumpy soup, containing curd, feverfew, mocha,
    whelks, string, gin and blood oranges.

    Teatime soup. Mostly water, into which are thrown delphiniums, muffins, tunny,
    pike and hake, lights, parsley, cocoa and gristle.

    Soup at twilight. Make a thick paste of mugwort, lima bean pulp, ground crocuses
    and mustard. Dilute with boiling duckpond water and leave to stand for a week,
    uncovered, out of doors. Scrape off the top layer of scurf and use as a filling
    for tiny oat pancake rolls. Toss these into the soup, along with mayonnaise, rusks,
    bloaters, pemmican, tulip-roots, vinegar, an ox-head, krill, crushed bones, whey,
    turmeric, marmalade, groist, badgers'' brains and spinach. Garnish with brazil
    nuts and strips of gelatine.'
