    Dear Mr. Key, Further to Mr. Decharne''s fascinating item about the Dachshund''s
    artistic abilities (7 September), I wonder if you might find work for your mystically-disgraced
    small badger, Little Severin, as an artist''s model? I am certain he could be
    reasonably still-ish while being drawn, or even painted, and I feel he deserves
    a second chance. He is, after all, a very small badger, and it is not his fault
    if his behaviour was misconstrued as "mystic" by ne''er-do-well impresarios hungry
    for a victim to exploit. Yours concernedly, Poppy Nisbet

    Well, Poppy, it''s true that Little Severin the Mystic Badger turned out to be
    not so mystic after all, although rumours flying about at Haemoglobin Towers have
    it that he correctly forecast the medal winners in the recent Olympic men''s polevaulting
    event (though not in the right order). On the other hand, maybe he was just scrubbling
    about in the undergrowth foraging for tasty grubs. Who can say? In any event,
    we have taken your advice and Little Severin is now earning his keep posing not,
    I am afraid to say, for paintbrush wielding Dachshunds, but as a full time model
    for human children at the Lancashire Badger Group. Here he is, seen twice, in
    a painting by Rachael Moodie, aged six.


    You can see many more pictures of the newly revitalised and no longer mystic Little
    Severin by clicking on the link below.
