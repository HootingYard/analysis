  text: Fangs In The Mist, a true crime book by T B Puddle, is sadly forgotten and
    out of print. Those of you with nostalgic childhood memories of having mama or
    papa read it to you as a bedtime story will be delighted to learn that an extract
    from it appears in the thirteenth and final chapter of Unspeakable Desolation
    Pouring Down From The Stars, which appears today. An afterword or endnote will
    be added next Monday.
