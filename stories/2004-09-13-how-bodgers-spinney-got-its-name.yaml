  text: "First, my friends, a potted history of Bodger's Spinney, which has, turn\
    \ and turn about, and not chronologically, been the site of boar hunts, medieval\
    \ skirmishes, skulking footpads, burning bushes, luminous UFO landings, dark and\
    \ desperate and demented deeds, root vegetable cultivation, lovers' trysts, the\
    \ world's first public telephone box, experiments with balloons, barometers, and\
    \ bauxite, a short-lived pencil sharpener factory, revolutionary uprisings, torchlit\
    \ pagan frenzy, subterranean explosions, dismal grey skies, uninterrupted rainfall\
    \ or, as our pals in the United States of Pining and Pothorst Land call it, precipitation,\
    \ thunderstorms, an Emerson Lake & Palmer concert, sudden sprouting of snapdragons,\
    \ phenomena both inexplicable and tiresome, a hideout for criminal gangs, revenge\
    \ in the night, fangs in the mist, and much, much else besides.\nUntil about 1504\
    \ it was known as \u201Cthat spinney over there\u201D, or simply \u201Cyon spinney\u201D\
    . In his List Of All The Spinneys In The Land published in 1507, however, the\
    \ Latvian expatriate scholar Arpad of Latvia dubbed it \u201CA Spinney of Corncrakes\
    \ and Glue To The North Of Inky Black Pond\u201D. This, like all Arpad's coinages,\
    \ was far too unwieldy a title for the illiterate peasants who shuffled about\
    \ the spinney in their stinking rags at that point in history. Most of these peasants\
    \ were covered in boils and buboes and pustules, and had lost most of their teeth,\
    \ but that need not concern us here.\nA century later, Dr Tarquin Shuddery tore\
    \ up Arpad's fairly useless compendium and created his own list of spinneys, and\
    \ he it was who first called it \u201CBodger's Spinney\u201D, naming it after\
    \ someone he met while out on horseback one summer's afternoon looking for signs\
    \ of trampled earth and hornets' nests for no apparent reason. This passer-by,\
    \ this Bodger, was not in fact named Bodger at all, for he was a felon bent on\
    \ subterfuge, and too clever by half to give his real name to a gent on horseback\
    \ who dressed like a magistrate and may be up to his neck in the legal profession.\
    \ As for Bodger's real name, that is not something anyone knows, nor, indeed,\
    \ does anyone care, for he was a grisly wretch steeped in crime, and he came to\
    \ a bad end, a very bad end. Today birds are singing in the spinney that bears\
    \ his pseudonym, birds are tweeting and carolling so loudly that they can be heard\
    \ for miles, even in the relentless downpour.\nSource : Copse & Spinney Nomenclature\

    \ hand-stitched)"
