  text: 'First, my friends, a potted history of Bodger''s Spinney, which has, turn
    and turn about, and not chronologically, been the site of boar hunts, medieval
    skirmishes, skulking footpads, burning bushes, luminous UFO landings, dark and
    desperate and demented deeds, root vegetable cultivation, lovers'' trysts, the
    world''s first public telephone box, experiments with balloons, barometers, and
    bauxite, a short-lived pencil sharpener factory, revolutionary uprisings, torchlit
    pagan frenzy, subterranean explosions, dismal grey skies, uninterrupted rainfall
    or, as our pals in the United States of Pining and Pothorst Land call it, precipitation,
    thunderstorms, an Emerson Lake & Palmer concert, sudden sprouting of snapdragons,
    phenomena both inexplicable and tiresome, a hideout for criminal gangs, revenge
    in the night, fangs in the mist, and much, much else besides.

    Until about 1504 it was known as "that spinney over there", or simply "yon spinney".
    In his List Of All The Spinneys In The Land published in 1507, however, the Latvian
    expatriate scholar Arpad of Latvia dubbed it "A Spinney of Corncrakes and Glue
    To The North Of Inky Black Pond". This, like all Arpad''s coinages, was far too
    unwieldy a title for the illiterate peasants who shuffled about the spinney in
    their stinking rags at that point in history. Most of these peasants were covered
    in boils and buboes and pustules, and had lost most of their teeth, but that need
    not concern us here.

    A century later, Dr Tarquin Shuddery tore up Arpad''s fairly useless compendium
    and created his own list of spinneys, and he it was who first called it "Bodger''s
    Spinney", naming it after someone he met while out on horseback one summer''s
    afternoon looking for signs of trampled earth and hornets'' nests for no apparent
    reason. This passer-by, this Bodger, was not in fact named Bodger at all, for
    he was a felon bent on subterfuge, and too clever by half to give his real name
    to a gent on horseback who dressed like a magistrate and may be up to his neck
    in the legal profession. As for Bodger''s real name, that is not something anyone
    knows, nor, indeed, does anyone care, for he was a grisly wretch steeped in crime,
    and he came to a bad end, a very bad end. Today birds are singing in the spinney
    that bears his pseudonym, birds are tweeting and carolling so loudly that they
    can be heard for miles, even in the relentless downpour.
