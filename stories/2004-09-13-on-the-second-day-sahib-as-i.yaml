  text: "\u201COn the second day, sahib, as I sought in the darkest part of the forest\
    \ among great trees of Padouk and Sal many cubits high, it happened that I heard\
    \ a great rending of wood, and lifting my eyes, I beheld the father of all the\
    \ Nats tear a great tree asunder and spring at me from the bowels thereof. The\
    \ face was the face of the Boh, only more terrible, but the arms were of the thickness\
    \ of a man's leg, and hairy as those of a spider.\u201D \u2014 Gordon McCreagh,\
