  text: "Back in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter\
    \ in his blind ma's ear. \u201COoh, Ugo,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201CThat hooter\
    \ makes a din!\u201D \u201CIt's a hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize,\u201D\
    \ said Ugo. \u201CAnd what did your pal Ulf win, Ugo?\u201D asked Ugo's ma, shelling\
    \ peas as she spoke. \u201CUlf won a toy wolf, ma,\u201D said Ugo, \u201CIt's\
    \ as noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your thumb on its\
    \ tum, the toy wolf that Ulf won roars.\u201D Ugo tooted his hooter again and\
    \ ran off to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv."
