  text: '"UNDERSTAND," SHE SAID, AS we chewed biscuits together in the summer-house,
    "That my soul is troubled and fearful. Sometimes my knees knock together involuntarily,
    for minutes on end, with such rapidity and force that I carry the bruises for
    weeks. I cannot bear sunlight: that is why I wear sunglasses and a gigantic hat."

    "It''s rather a nice hat," I said, and as far as I can remember I meant it.

    "You are kind," she sighed, "But there is no need to mouth such drivel. Once my
    back is turned, some of the nicest people I know laugh like drains at my assortment
    of hats, and I cannot say I blame them."

    "No, really," I insisted, "I think it''s a nice hat."

    She was pitiless. "Then you lack all sense of taste," she snapped, "Never mind.
    You are still young. Perhaps when this stamp album business is done with we can
    have you carted off to an institution where your sensibilities can be restructured."

    "You''re not much older than me yourself," I protested.

    "Physically, you may well be correct. Vital essence, however, is another matter.
    When I was a little girl, I would sit at my mother''s knee for hours on end, listening
    to her tales of mayhem, decrepitude, and ruin. I rarely sleep, and through the
    long restless nights as I toss and turn, I can still hear her telling me tales
    of shipwrecked mariners and bug-eyed morticians, of desperate hellions and cold,
    harsh poisoners, of the air heavy with the reek of marsh gas on the fateful night
    that Blind Jim Carg went crackers with an axe in the cottage he shared with his
    invalid wife and frostbitten children. My childhood was an abnormal one by any
    standards, Mr Blake. I lived in a glum village with my mother, her mother, and
    dozens of cousins. Rarely a day would pass without us striding out of the house,
    in a sorry, dishevelled band, to undertake long hikes through the countryside.
    I remember one such occasion with particular clarity. In a late evening, dark,
    but not so dark, out to the river we walked: a strange river, to us, in strange
    fields, in a valley. As strangers we strolled to the water, as sleeping folks
    do, in strange countries, who stroll in an evening. And over the river, a mountain,
    alone in the half dark, a mass of dense darkness, of blackness, and by it a star--one
    bright star--to the right of the mountain and near to its top, very close to it,
    one star alone, that in light all the mass of the mountain held balanced. A memory
    shook us, that none of us had, but all shared, and at once started talking, who
    all knew this picture: this star and this mountain, these masses and forces, these
    shapes and positions, this darkness and light--in its infinite sum--all we knew
    and remembered, and woke for a moment, in the midst of a journey we never began.
    I was six years old at the time, Mr Blake, six. Can you imagine having such an
    experience at such a tender age? I see you cannot. My grandmother was a painter
    of crucifixions: she was not religious, but she was a monomaniac to be sure. I
    do not think one among us escaped being infected by her terrible apprehension
    of existence. She met her death on my twelfth birthday, in the same accident which
    robbed me of the use of my legs. I did not utter a word for five years."

    You''re making up for lost time, I thought, yawning. Where was all this leading
    to?

    "I hate to interrupt," I interrupted, "But am I to understand that you''re going
    to help me to find Mister Patch''s stamp album?"

    "Ah," she said, sweeping the biscuit crumbs from her lap, "I see you are the sort
    of chap who wants to get right down to business." I was not sure whether this
    was intended as a compliment: I smiled weakly. "I have come upon many clients
    like yourself," she continued, "Impatient and headstrong, clattering along at
    such a pace that sooner or later you become entangled in a sort of intellectual
    clump of nettles, from which you can only be freed by convulsive brain-activity,
    externally sparked, leaving you crumpled and incapable, but once more whole. I
    am afraid that my services will prove useless to you unless you give me free rein."

    I had absolutely no idea how to reply to this, and wedged a digestive biscuit
    into my mouth in a pathetic attempt to conceal my jumbleheadedness.

    "I do not pretend that my methods are straightforward, Mr Blake. There are any
    number of private detectives and confidential agents who would pander to your
    impetuosity. I know how they work. You would rattle off to them the essentials
    of the case, they would scribble down a few notes, out would come your wallet,
    and, with an advance in hand, away they would scurry, picking up clues where they
    might, until they returned to you with a report on their progress and a request
    for further funds. Does that sound familiar?"

    It did: and, I added, it seemed perfectly reasonable, assuming that there was
    a satisfactory conclusion. She let out a hoot of laughter which chilled my bones:
    yes, yes, I know that reads like a hackneyed exaggeration, but believe me, I was
    there--I actually heard it. She let me finish quivering before she replied.

    "Before you decide whether or not to employ me, there are a number of things you
    must understand. I have told you that my methods are unorthodox. I do not proceed
    in what is commonly thought of as a ''logical'' fashion. At times, my actions
    may appear abstruse, inept, or lackadaisical. A number of my previous clients
    have accused me of fraud, construing my behaviour as time-wasting indolence: I
    hope you will not make the same mistake. The point is, Mr Blake, that should I
    at any time doubt that your trust in me is complete, unfailing, and passeth all
    understanding, I shall be off the case, and will whisk myself away without a moment''s
    notice. And remember that I am a sensitive soul: I take umbrage easily. A flip
    comment, a quizzical raising of the eyebrow, the merest criticism: any of these
    is likely to shatter my brain, and I will be out of here like a rocket, returning
    to my glum domain of hissing gas-jets and cracked linoleum, wherein I will wait,
    patiently and without rancour, for another client. Should you signal to me the
    tiniest sliver of doubt in my abilities, I will begone: but offer me your trust,
    and I will find Mister Patch''s stamp album, and return it to you. Is that understood?"

    "I think so," I said.

    "Very well. Now, listen. When I was seventeen years old I wrote a book called
    Fangs In The Mist. I sent it off to over a dozen publishers before it was eventually
    accepted. Taking advice from one of the editors, I adopted a pseudonym: T B Puddle.
    Perhaps you recall the book? No? Well, here is a copy. I insist that you read
    it from cover to cover before we proceed any further. Meanwhile, I will take advantage
    of your hospitality by having a relaxing bath and a little nap. I take it there
    is running hot water in the house, and a nice springy mattress on which I can
    rest my bones?"

    Her manner was uppity and abrupt, but somehow this pallid cripple enthralled me,
    and I gushed thirty seconds'' worth of cloying succour.

    "By all means! There is a lovely bathroom on the ground floor! Let me wheel you
    to it! I''ll seek out the best soap for you! I''ll make ready the downstairs bedroom,
    plump up the cushions and festoon the place with fragrant pot pourris! Sleep as
    long as you like! And just tinkle the bell when you awake and I''ll bring you
    a feast of delicacies!"

    She looked at me as if I were a madman, but I took no notice, sprang up at once
    and steered her across the dying lawn towards the house.

    "What''s the book about?" I asked.

    "You''ll see," she replied, in a tone which forbade further questions.

    I wheeled her into the bathroom, started the taps running, and fairly ran back
    to the summer-house, tripping along like a love-struck teenager: which is perhaps
    what I was. The book was a dog-eared paperback which looked as if it had once
    been attacked by singularly ferocious mice. On the cover, the title and author''s
    name formed a blaze of fiery red and yellow across what appeared to be a picture
    of some mist with a pair of glistening fangs lurking therein. Thrills and spills
    aplenty were promised by this garish design. I smirked to myself, for some reason,
    opened the book and began to read:

    Fangs In The Mist

    Chapter One

    While Hugh was sliding on the lake, he fell and sprained his wrist. My sister
    has a blue veil made of gauze. The old woman got a skein of worsted, and began
    to knit her stocking. The lawyer made a very awkward mistake. The geese plucked
    some wool from the fleece of the sheep. The pulpit is too near the ceiling. The
    curtains are made of chintz, and the quilt is filled with eiderdown. The invalid
    ate a biscuit with his gruel. The cook pierced her arm with a skewer, and bruised
    a sinew. The laundryman gave his neice a pair of gloves, and asked her to repair
    the seams. He had a piece of quartz in his hands: he let it fall amongst the cinders.
    We have no cauliflowers in our garden, but we have turnips and spinach. I will
    give you a snowdrop for that crocus. My uncle arrived on a Wednesday evening in
    February. When the fire had burnt the joists, the roof of the castle fell in.
    The orphan child enjoyed her coarse bread and her draught of water. Be careful
    to shun vicious neighbours. A railway guard should be an honest man, and should
    never taste liquor. The ostler is a saucy knave: he refused to fasten my stirrup.
    The heir, in bad humour, cut his thumb with a knife. You cannot see through wood:
    it is opaque. The wrestler fell from the bough of a larch and broke his collar-bone.
    This piece of chalk will not weigh half an ounce. That bunch of thyme has a pleasant
    scent. His guilt is undoubted: and that of his cousin, who was in league with
    him, is strongly suspected. They got lime from the kiln, and began to repair the
    aisle of the church. Do you hear the mice gnawing the wainscot? A gnat bit me
    on the cheek, and caused me great pain. The prisoner would not deign to kneel
    before the judge. The debtor rose in great wrath, and tried to knock his captor
    down. The viscount, when cruising in his yacht, saw a wreck off the beach. The
    rustic drove his plough through the lea. It was tough work, but the horses pulled
    with all their might. Our master has a thorough knowledge of accounts. The baker
    must weigh the dough before he puts it in the oven. The calf fell into the slough,
    so we called the veterinary surgeon. The priest is acquainted with several foreigners.
    The shepherd found a corpse in the forest. The villain has no moral character,
    and is a disgrace to his family. The surgeon was on the point of yielding when
    the hostess interfered. When I pointed the muzzle of the gun at him, he very cunningly
    feigned death. The monks commended their erring brother to the mercy of the deity.
    The crowd was composed chiefly of rowdy and violent persons. While Pat was riding
    his chestnut horse, the reins broke. My cousin is a martyr to toothache. He prophesied
    that there would be a thunderstorm before the morning. The manager has invented
    a new system of telegraph-signals. He had scarcely crossed the line when he was
    siezed by a policeman. Example is better than precept, and good advice has double
    weight when offered by one who practises what he advises. The traveller visits
    the capital annually. The drawing-room is immediately above the kitchen. The doctor
    arrived in a chaise: he felt the patient''s pulse, and pronounced him better.
    When sailing in his canoe on the canal, he was capsized and nearly drowned. Osier
    twigs make excellent baskets. Sulphur is dug out of the earth in Italy and South
    America. In Holland the stork is protected by law, because it eats the frogs and
    worms that would injure the dikes. The wharfinger was not only sightless: he also
    became utterly deaf. Their navigational ways were profoundly mysterious. My knife
    is gone, and none of the children know where it is. The teacher reminded the pupils
    how admirably and excellently God has regulated everything in the world. The engineer
    missed the way again: instead of going into his own house, he went into that of
    his neighbour. At this intelligence he stood as if struck with palsy. Do not forget
    to put on your cloak: it is very cold and stormy. The watchmaker soaked his feet
    in a tub of hot water. He was carrying the box on his head. I have not seen him
    for six months. He tied the parcel tightly, so that the things should not come
    out. Notwithstanding this, the string broke. He cannot see the necessity for doing
    it again. He is the same age as his cousin. This lady appears to be taller than
    her mother. Those who are idle are seldom happy. The windows are not shut. It
    was a very austere garden. You should try to memorise everything you are reading.
    Show the man your ticket as you go in. My sister has obtained a very large sponge.
    Where were your parents last week? We are thinking of chartering an entire steamer,
    and must calculate how much cheaper the expenses of freight would be than if we
    shipped in small consignments. I have been appointed sole agent for the sale of
    this machine. The boxes were nearly all broken, and their contents much damaged
    by water. The servant has disarranged the cabinets. In great states hundreds must
    starve, in order that one may gourmandize and revel: tens of thousands are oppressed
    and hunted to death, that one crowned fool or philosopher may gratify his whims.

    I took a deep breath, and skimmed hurriedly through the next few pages: I was
    not even a quarter of the way through chapter one, and there were eleven more
    after that. How shall I describe my feelings when I realised that the entire book
    was written in this irritating fashion? Irritation? Consternation? Disgust? I
    flung the book to the floor and set off to the house in search of a large bottle
    of Cataleptic Drudge. As I was about to go down to the cellar, Matilda Spamclot
    came trundling towards me across the hallway.

    "You''re a fast reader," she said, "You''ve finished the book already!"

    "Er, not exactly," I whimpered. I could feel myself blushing.

    "Now look here. I thought I had made myself clear. I will brook no tomfoolery.
    If I am to take on this case, you must follow my instructions. Get back to that
    outbuilding of yours and finish the book!"

    She was, obviously, quite barmy. I should have pulled a frightening face at her
    and thrown her out of the house: but I restrained myself. After all, I was relying
    on her to find Mister Patch''s album. Also, she had come recommended by Scrimgeour,
    and I could not afford to put his nose out of joint. Most compellingly, if I refused
    Matilda''s help, what other options were open to me? Fig, Brewster and Binnie
    had paid with their lives: my own attempt had met with failure: I could not think
    of anything else to do. And, of course, there was something about Matilda that
    held me spellbound.

    "Righty ho," I said, "I was just going to get some refreshments. I must say it''s
    an absolutely fascinating novel--such tremendous narrative drive!"

    She smote her forehead with the flat of her hand and gave me a pitying look. "It
    isn''t a novel, you clot! It is a wholly factual account of my first case! I am
    the woman who put Jem Boggis, the flimsy-legged poisoner of Blister Lane, behind
    bars for the rest of his life!"

    Shamefaced, I scuttled back to the summer house and ploughed on through the book
    as best I could. It made no sense to me whatsoever, but once I got used to its
    curious rhythms, I even began to enjoy it a little.

    The chef poured his soup into the tureen. The lieutenant''s ears were burning:
    his superiors were discussing his next posting. The devil makes work for idle
    hands to do. Has Rodney spat upon the embers?

    I never did find out if Rodney spat so, but the thought of him doing so, or not
    doing so, was rather pleasing, whoever he was. Later, as we clutched each other
    in a verdant dingle, Matilda explained why she had forced me to read Fangs In
    The Mist.

    "Detail is everything, Mr Blake," she said.

    "Call me Zinnigmot, please," I gasped.

    "Stop being so foolish. It has far too many syllables for a genuine name."

    Specious as this statement was, Matilda allowed no time for me to argue. "Detail,
    always detail. Now, you must tell me everything that has happened regarding this
    inane stamp collection business, everything you can remember, and in as much detail
    as possible. Armed with sufficient detail, nothing can stop me gouging out the
    truth. Nothing and nobody--not even the Infected Churls of Tantarabim!"

    I wanted to ask Matilda what that last bit meant, but her pencil was already poised
    over a clean page of her ledger, and she had begun to make impatient hissing noises.
    So I told her everything, more or less exactly as I have told it to you. It took
    ages to go over my story in the demented detail which Matilda required, but she
    didn''t yawn once. I was amazed at the speed with which she scribbled her notes.
    She worked her way through three hard pencils before I finished.

    "That''s splendid," she said, closing her ledger, and wheeling herself away towards
    the house, "Now, I''m going to have to ponder on all this for a while."

    Three weeks later, on a sopping Thursday afternoon, I popped my head around her
    door to ask if she had made any progress. She was fast asleep. I crept over to
    her desk and rummaged through the pile of papers: there were two or three ledgers,
    innumerable scraps torn from exercise books, five small cardboard boxes containing
    a meticulously-kept card index, and a dozen telephone directories, the pages of
    which had been bleached and which now contained a staggering number of quite incomprehensible
    diagrams. I would have liked to reproduce one of these at this point in my story,
    but Matilda has since re-bleached the pages ready for her next case. Unable to
    make head nor tail of what she was up to, I retreated to the pantry and opened
    a bottle of Whelk-Encrusted Mariner''s Spit. I was halfway through my second glass
    when Matilda appeared in the doorway.

    "Well may you celebrate, Mr Blake," she said, "You will be pleased to know that
    I have solved the case!"

    She chucked something at me. It was Mister Patch''s stamp album. I stood up, sat
    down again, mopped my brow, looked wildly about, and made quite ridiculous gibbering
    noises.

    "Come, come," she interrupted, "Pour me a glass of whatever you''re drinking and
    let us repair to the verdant dingle so that I can tell you all about it!"

    I protested that it was pouring with rain, but Matilda just threw an umbrella
    at me and started for the door. Shoving a few more bottles into a tote bag, I
    followed her. And there, sheltering under the dripping leaves of pugton and hubidibas
    trees, I nestled my head in Matilda''s lap, as with gentle hands she stroked my
    brow, and in a voice celestial and spellbinding, she slowly, oh so slowly, whispered
    to me the truth of all that had happened, all that I had been too dim and blind
    to see, and a great calmness stole over me, and I envisioned her words as turquoise
    ribbons rippling in the air above my head with the lightness of gossamer, and
    my heart seemed to stop beating, and my brain ceased whirling, and I fell fast,
    fast asleep.
