  text: '"Unfortunately, I can speak from experience of the dire effect of gas in
    a confined space. Some years ago when placing the shelves round the small room,
    which, by a euphemism, is called my library, I took the precaution of making two
    self-acting ventilators which communicated directly with the outer air just under
    the ceiling. For economy of space as well as of temper (for lamps of all kinds
    are sore trials), I had a gasalier of three lights over the table. The effect
    was to cause great heat in the upper regions, and in the course of a year or two
    the leather valance which hung from the window, as well as the fringe which dropped
    half-an-inch from each shelf to keep out the dust, was just like tinder, and in
    some parts actually fell to the ground by its own weight; while the backs of the
    books upon the top shelves were perished, and crumbled away when touched, being
    reduced to the consistency of Scotch snuff. This was, of course, due to the sulphur
    in the gas fumes, which attack russia quickest, while calf and morocco suffer
    not quite so much." -- William Blades, The Enemies Of Books'
