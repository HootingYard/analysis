  text: I read the other day that Clive James (writer, critic, and presenter of odious
    and patronising TV programmes) states that he is engaged on "a search for the
    magic sentence in a world all too real". In his case, the "magic sentence" is
    probably twenty thousand years in Sing Sing, but let that pass. What makes me
    gnash my teeth in irritation is that this portentous comment doesn't actually
    mean anything, it just sounds as if it does. James wants to be thought of with
    high seriousness, so he spouts this rubbish, and it gets lapped up by the witless
    literati, who probably think it does mean something. (I seem to recall one of
    James' other "talents" has been fawning to the royal family, so that gives us
    some idea just how "all too real" his world is.) End of minor rant.
