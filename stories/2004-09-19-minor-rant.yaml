  text: "I read the other day that Clive James (writer, critic, and presenter of odious\
    \ and patronising TV programmes) states that he is engaged on \u201Ca search for\
    \ the magic sentence in a world all too real\u201D. In his case, the \u201Cmagic\
    \ sentence\u201D is probably twenty thousand years in Sing Sing, but let that\
    \ pass. What makes me gnash my teeth in irritation is that this portentous comment\
    \ doesn't actually mean anything, it just sounds as if it does. James wants to\
    \ be thought of with high seriousness, so he spouts this rubbish, and it gets\
    \ lapped up by the witless literati, who probably think it does mean something.\
    \ (I seem to recall one of James' other \u201Ctalents\u201D has been fawning to\
    \ the royal family, so that gives us some idea just how \u201Call too real\u201D\
    \ his world is.) End of minor rant."
