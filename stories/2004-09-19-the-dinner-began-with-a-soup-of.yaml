  text: '"The dinner began with a soup of asps in simmering oil. On each side was
    a dish of vegetables, one containing thistles and burdocks, and the other fuming
    acid. Other side dishes, of turtles, rats, bats and moles, were garnished with
    live coals. For the fish course he ate a dish of snakes in boiling tar and pitch.
    His roast was a screech owl in a sauce of glowing brimstone. The salad proved
    to be spider webs full of small explosive squibs, a plate of butterfly wings and
    manna worms, a dish of toads surrounded with flies, crickets, grasshoppers, church
    beetles, spiders, and caterpillars. He washed all this down with flaming brandy,
    and for dessert ate the four large candles standing on the table, both of the
    hanging side lamps with their contents, and finally the large center lamp, oil,
    wick and all. This leaving the room in darkness, Dufour''s face shone out in a
    mask of living flames." -- Harry Houdini, Miracle Mongers And Their Methods: A
