  text: '"This is the place where it goes clunk," said the prize-winning scientist,
    pointing with his stick to an otherwise dull part of the revolutionary new machine.
    His audience gasped. It was the climax of his lecture; all that remained were
    a few words of summing up, then the astonished listeners would scatter, like chaffinches
    from a treetop after a gunshot, and the scientist could put his stick away for
    another week. But not today! For lurking incognito in the group was Father Desperado
    Sepulveda, the so-called Milquetoast Jesuit, sent on a mission from Paraguay to
    ferret out the truth. He cleared his throat. "I think," he said, in a whisper
    like the hiss of an asp, "I think we would all like to hear it go clunk." The
    scientist''s brow furrowed and his mouth felt suddenly dry. "It is one thing to
    be told that it goes clunk," continued the relentless Jesuit, "But something else
    entirely to experience for ourselves the sound of it going clunk." He was an empiricist.
    The rest of the crowd began to mutter excitedly. They had not thought to be so
    forward themselves. The scientist spluttered, but it was too late, for Father
    Sepulveda had already pressed the big yellow knob that made it go clunk. Forensic
    teams later recovered his rosary beads from the rubble.
