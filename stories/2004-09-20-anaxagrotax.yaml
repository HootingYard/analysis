  text: 'My name is Anaxagrotax, and I am the last survivor of a vanquished horde.
    Like the rest of my horde, I am neither an smooth man nor an hairy man, but somewhere
    in between. Our vanquishment was bloody and violent, as you might imagine. It
    was also very, very noisy, what with the clash of steel and the roar of cannonades
    and the howling and wailing of the wounded. I pray to my strange gods that never
    again will I witness such carnage.

    To my chagrin, it took only a single morning to vanquish my previously unconquerable
    horde. As dawn broke on that terrible Thursday, there were thousands of us, hooting
    and whooping, daubed in the Paint of Ferocity, sharpening our implements and grunting
    a lot. We were well fed, tough, fearless and bent on conquest. By noon I was the
    only one left, hiding in a patch of bracken, and, I confess, shuddering in terror
    and grief. I was also bleeding from a contusion on my forehead and possibly slightly
    concussed. All around me the moorland was a scene of corpses and hacked-off limbs
    and blood.

    By mid-afternoon I was feeling a little more myself. A stray hen had wandered
    into the bracken, and it was good to know that I was not the last living thing
    on earth. Poultry can be consoling in such circumstances. I reflected that as
    a warrior in a barbaric and bloodthirsty horde I ought to have expected things
    to turn out this way sooner or later. I was quite certain that our vanquishers
    had now left the scene to go and vanquish elsewhere, so I stood up and, saying
    goodbye to the hen, began walking away from my dead and, in some cases, still
    dying comrades in the direction of the palace. Perhaps it was callous of me to
    ignore the groans of those who were still alive, whose souls had not yet been
    plucked from their bodies by the hideous bat-faced god Beb and placed in his capacious
    pouch. Try not to judge me by your own moral code, if you have one.

    By nightfall I had reached the stream that runs into a pool near the palace. I
    sat down on a tuffet and lit a cigarette. The moon was full and there were so
    many stars visible that they set my brain dizzy. I looked across the fields at
    the palace. Reassuringly, the usual bonfire was blazing on the roof. A bold water
    rat came to give me the once over, but soon scuttled away. I stubbed out my cigarette
    and made my way towards the palace at last. Gusts of wind dishevelled my hairstyle
    despite all the grease I had caked it with that morning. It seemed so long, long
    ago. As I took my final weary steps towards the gigantic wooden gates, my heart
    leapt when I saw that a great golden banner had been hung from the crenellations.
    "Welcome Home, Anaxagrotax!" it read, in letters of vermilion and blue. As I beat
    my great muscular fists on the palace gates, midnight struck. Thursday was over.'
