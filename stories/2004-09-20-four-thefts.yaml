  text: Last week saw the final instalment of the serial story Unspeakable Desolation
    Pouring Down From The Stars. There are four instances of outright plagiarism in
    the tale, and these are acknowledged in the Afterword. If you would like to try
    and spot them yourself, wait to follow that link until you have identified the
    work of Thomas Pynchon, Mary Shelley, Chris Cutler and James Hamilton-Paterson
    lurking in (or shouting out from) the text.
