  text: "For readers unfamiliar with the person from Porlock, here is the gist of\
    \ the story. In 1797 Samuel Taylor Coleridge was staying at a farmhouse near Porlock\
    \ in Somerset. One day he was reading about Kubla Khan, but\u2014having taken\
    \ his habitual dose of opium\u2014he fell asleep and had a vivid dream. As soon\
    \ as he woke up, he had a lengthy poem clear in his mind, famously beginning \u201C\
    In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree\u2026.\u201D He started\
    \ to write down the words in his head, but was \u201Ccalled out by a person on\
    \ business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour.\u201D By the time\
    \ Coleridge got back to his desk, the dream was forgotten, and the visionary poem\
    \ remained incomplete.\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge (left) and Ringo Starr (right),\
    \ flanking a map showing the town of Porlock\nDobson had a theory that the person\
    \ from Porlock was in fact a Pod Person from some other, uncanny universe, sent\
    \ as an emissary to Coleridge for reasons we can only guess at. The pamphleteer\
    \ carried out a number of experiments in an attempt to summon the Pod Person,\
    \ many of which ended up with him being taken to Casualty. Even when he managed\
    \ to escape injury, neighbours became so vexed by various banging, hammering,\
    \ wheezing, snorting, thudding and high-pitched whistling noises issuing from\
    \ Dobson's hovel that the police were called to give him a ticking off.\nOn one\
    \ famous occasion Dobson actually travelled to Porlock and accosted people in\
    \ the streets, accusing them of being Pod People. He was hounded out of town by\
    \ ruffians and never returned. Oddly enough, he never wrote any pamphlets about\
    \ the matter, and it has been left to the octogenarian film director James Paste\
    \ to bring it to wider attention. Paste's drama-documentary Dobson And The Pod\
    \ Person From Porlock is currently in pre-production. Rumour has it that Ringo\
    \ Starr has been signed up, but for which role\u2014Dobson, Coleridge, or the\
    \ Pod Person (or perhaps all three)\u2014is not yet known."
