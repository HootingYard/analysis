  text: '"Towards the tail, on the western parts of the wood, live the Tarichanes,
    a people with eels'' eyes, and faces like crabs, bold, warlike, and that live
    upon raw flesh. On the other side, at the right hand wall, are the Tritonomendetes,
    in their upper parts men, and in the lower resembling weasels." -- Lucian, Trips
    To The Moon'
