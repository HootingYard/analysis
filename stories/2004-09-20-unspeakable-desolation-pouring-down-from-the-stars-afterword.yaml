    From The Stars which deserve acknowledgement.

    The Courier''s Tragedy, scenes from which are engraved on the stolen pipe-rack,
    is a Jacobean drama by Richard Wharfinger. Both the play and its author were invented
    by Thomas Pynchon in The Crying Of Lot 49.

    The description of Mister Poxhaven is identical to Mary Shelley''s description
    of the Monster in Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.

    Matilda Spamclot''s childhood anecdote, beginning "In a late evening" and ending
    "in the midst of a journey we never began" is the text of a song by Chris Cutler,
    with music by Lindsay Cooper. It appears on the album Letters Home by News From
    Babel.

    The title Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars is culled from James
    Hamilton-Paterson''s book Playing With Water.'
