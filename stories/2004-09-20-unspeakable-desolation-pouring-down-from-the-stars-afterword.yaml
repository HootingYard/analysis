  text: "There are a small number of thefts in Unspeakable Desolation \n        Pouring\
    \ Down From The Stars which deserve acknowledgement. \nThe Courier's Tragedy,\
    \ scenes from which are engraved \n      on the stolen pipe-rack, is a Jacobean\
    \ drama by Richard Wharfinger. Both the \n      play and its author were invented\
    \ by Thomas Pynchon in The Crying Of Lot \n        49. \nThe description of Mister\
    \ Poxhaven is identical to Mary Shelley's \n      description of the Monster in\
    \ Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. \n    \nMatilda Spamclot's childhood\
    \ anecdote, beginning \"In a late \n      evening\" and ending \"in the midst\
    \ of a journey we never began\" is the text \n      of a song by Chris Cutler,\
    \ with music by Lindsay Cooper. It appears on the album \n      Letters Home by\
    \ News From Babel. \nThe title Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars\
    \ \n      is culled from James Hamilton-Paterson's book Playing With Water. "
