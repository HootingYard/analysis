  text: '"Now he saw it as so similar in shape that it seemed to him for half a second
    not a face at all, but another back; but this eyed and mouthed as if the living
    human form ended in a gruesomeness, and had a huge beetle for its head, only a
    beetle that looked out backward through its coat and had a wide speaking mouth
    there also; a speaking beetle, an orating beetle, but also a dead and watching
    beetle. He forgot the aesthetic remark he had been about to make." -- Charles
    Williams, All Hallows'' Eve 1914'
