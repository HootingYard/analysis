  text: "\u201CNow he saw it as so similar in shape that it seemed to him for half\
    \ a second not a face at all, but another back; but this eyed and mouthed as if\
    \ the living human form ended in a gruesomeness, and had a huge beetle for its\
    \ head, only a beetle that looked out backward through its coat and had a wide\
    \ speaking mouth there also; a speaking beetle, an orating beetle, but also a\
    \ dead and watching beetle. He forgot the aesthetic remark he had been about to\
    \ make.\u201D \u2014 Charles Williams, All Hallows' Eve 1914"
