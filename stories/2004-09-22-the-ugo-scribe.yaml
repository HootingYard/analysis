  text: 'A disconcerting number of readers write to ask the origin of the brief Bulgarian
    folk tales assembled here featuring Ugo, his blind ma, and his pal Ulf (look under
    "Ugo" in the Unhelpful Index for dates). Being folk tales, their origin is of
    course uncertain, but by scrabbling around distractedly in the cobweb-strewn cellars
    of the Plovdiv Municipal Archives, our reporter has discovered evidence of the
    historical figure known only as the Ugo-scribe. Here he is:


    In the same bundle of papers tied up with what appears to be the braided fur of
    an Arctic hare (Lepus timidus arcticus) is a document listing the various maladies
    suffered by the Ugo-scribe during his long and productive life. They include anstity,
    black canker, cardiagra, corn rage, eel thing, leake fever, nox, painter''s colic,
    phlegraphy, rising of the lights, salt rheum, simtity, splints, Syrian fever,
    white liver and worm fits.

    Further details of these and other absolutely terrifying ailments can be found
    at the splendid Archaic Medical Terms website, which is heartily recommended for
    readers with strong stomachs.'
