  text: "A disconcerting number of readers write to ask the origin of the brief Bulgarian\
    \ folk tales assembled here featuring Ugo, his blind ma, and his pal Ulf (look\
    \ under \u201CUgo\u201D in the Unhelpful Index for dates). Being folk tales, their\
    \ origin is of course uncertain, but by scrabbling around distractedly in the\
    \ cobweb-strewn cellars of the Plovdiv Municipal Archives, our reporter has discovered\
    \ evidence of the historical figure known only as the Ugo-scribe. Here he is:\n\
    \nIn the same bundle of papers tied up with what appears to be the braided fur\
    \ of an Arctic hare (Lepus timidus arcticus) is a document listing the various\
    \ maladies suffered by the Ugo-scribe during his long and productive life. They\
    \ include anstity, black canker, cardiagra, corn rage, eel thing, leake fever,\
    \ nox, painter's colic, phlegraphy, rising of the lights, salt rheum, simtity,\
    \ splints, Syrian fever, white liver and worm fits.\nFurther details of these\
    \ and other absolutely terrifying ailments can be found at the splendid Archaic\
    \ Medical Terms website, which is heartily recommended for readers with strong\
    \ stomachs."
