  text: "This afternoon, whim dictates that I share with readers some famous last\
    \ words.\n\u201CReynolds! Reynolds! \u2026 Reynolds!\u201D \u2014 Edgar Allan\
    \ Poe *\n\u201CI suppose I am now becoming a god\u201D \u2014 Emperor Vespasian\n\
    \u201CAll this buttoning and unbuttoning\u201D \u2014 Anonymous 17th century suicide\n\
    \u201CIt was I who discovered leeches have red blood.\u201D Georges Cuvier\n*\
    \ NOTE : Poe was yelling out for Jeremiah Reynolds\u2014not present at his deathbed\u2014\
    an enthusiastic supporter of the hollow earth theories of John Cleve Symmes. Symmes'\
    \ idea that there were entrances to subterranean worlds at both the Poles was\
    \ one of the inspirations for Poe's magnificent The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon\
    \ Pym Of Nantucket.\n\nSymmes : \u201CI declare the earth is hollow, and inhabital\
    \ within; containing a number of solid concentric spheres, one within the other,\
    \ and that it is open at the poles or 16 degrees; I pledge my life in support\
    \ of this truth, and am ready to explore the hollow, if the world will support\
    \ and aid me in the undertaking.\u201D"
