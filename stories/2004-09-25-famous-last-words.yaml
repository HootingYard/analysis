  text: 'This afternoon, whim dictates that I share with readers some famous last
    words.

    "Reynolds! Reynolds! ... Reynolds!" -- Edgar Allan Poe *

    "I suppose I am now becoming a god" -- Emperor Vespasian

    "All this buttoning and unbuttoning" -- Anonymous 17th century suicide

    "It was I who discovered leeches have red blood." Georges Cuvier

    * NOTE : Poe was yelling out for Jeremiah Reynolds--not present at his deathbed--an
    enthusiastic supporter of the hollow earth theories of John Cleve Symmes. Symmes''
    idea that there were entrances to subterranean worlds at both the Poles was one
    of the inspirations for Poe''s magnificent The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym
    Of Nantucket.


    Symmes : "I declare the earth is hollow, and inhabital within; containing a number
    of solid concentric spheres, one within the other, and that it is open at the
    poles or 16 degrees; I pledge my life in support of this truth, and am ready to
    explore the hollow, if the world will support and aid me in the undertaking."'
