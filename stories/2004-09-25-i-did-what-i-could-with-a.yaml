  text: "\u201CI did what I could with a hunting-knife and forceps, without dyes or\
    \ microscope, swallowing my nausea \u2014 it was a nauseating thing! \u2014 memorizing\
    \ what I found. But, as the sun rose higher, the thing liquefied, melted, until\
    \ by nine o'clock there was nothing but a glutinous gray puddle, with two green\
    \ eyes swimming in it. And these eyes \u2014 I can see them now \u2014 burst with\
    \ a thick pop, making a detestable sticky ripple in that puddle of corruption.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Gerald Kersh, Men Without Bones"
