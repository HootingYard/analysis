  text: 'This handy guide has been produced by the Tantarabim Tourist Board, a body
    riddled with corruption from top to toe, although its internal politics need not
    concern the innocent reader who merely wishes to spend a few joyous hours in the
    bailiwick of Tantarabim on a cold and blustery winter''s day, swaddled in woollen
    garments against the elements. Let''s start again. This is a handy guide to the
    sort of activities you and your family can enjoy in Tantarabim during the winter
    months, should you be unlucky enough to have your plane make a forced landing
    there due to storminess, surely the only reason to go anywhere near Tantarabim
    in the first place, given how frightening it is. Having said that, for the tourist
    who does not mind discomfort and privations, Tantarabim can be a source of much
    entertainment and interest, if the words are used loosely. So put on your hat
    and come with me now as we creep past the gore-splattered beasts with venomous
    fangs which guard all approaches to the town, and I shall list at least five things
    you can do when stuck in Tantarabim during a blizzard.

    1. Plummet helplessly down one of the many hidden chutes which deliver you into
    a flaming pit.

    2. Be poked at with pointed sticks by cloven-hoofed imps spitting sulphur. You
    will have lots of fun trying to shake them off, but we guarantee you won''t succeed!

    3. Take a guided tour of the choc ice factory. The price of entry includes the
    opportunity to taste their wares.

    4. Become embroiled in a fight to the death with Bonecrusher Jim, an untamed python
    which has been deprived of food for months.

    5. Spend a night in one of Tantarabim''s many inns, where you will be entranced
    by the primitive gaslight, inexplicable night-time banging and crashing noises,
    swarms of phantom locusts, and walls and ceilings that seem to move when you are
    not looking. Most inns do not charge for children under sixteen, probably because
    they are likely to be abducted by strange amphibious monsters and dragged into
    the sea.'
