  text: "\u201CA human form was there, but clothed in such vestments as proclaimed\
    \ God; and no wonder mortality was overwhelmed when ushered into the presence\
    \ of the uncreated Deity\u2014he whose feet glowed as brass in a furnace, whose\
    \ eyes were as a flame of fire, and whose voice was as the sound of many waters.\
    \ Any man would have fallen as dead before such a personage as is here described.\
    \ Men may talk atheism, but it is the atheism of the lips and of a coward heart,\
    \ an atheism that would flee appalled before the burning footsteps of the Deity.\u201D\
