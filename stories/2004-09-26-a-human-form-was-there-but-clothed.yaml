  text: '"A human form was there, but clothed in such vestments as proclaimed God;
    and no wonder mortality was overwhelmed when ushered into the presence of the
    uncreated Deity--he whose feet glowed as brass in a furnace, whose eyes were as
    a flame of fire, and whose voice was as the sound of many waters. Any man would
    have fallen as dead before such a personage as is here described. Men may talk
    atheism, but it is the atheism of the lips and of a coward heart, an atheism that
    would flee appalled before the burning footsteps of the Deity." -- F Smith, The
    Revelation Explained'
