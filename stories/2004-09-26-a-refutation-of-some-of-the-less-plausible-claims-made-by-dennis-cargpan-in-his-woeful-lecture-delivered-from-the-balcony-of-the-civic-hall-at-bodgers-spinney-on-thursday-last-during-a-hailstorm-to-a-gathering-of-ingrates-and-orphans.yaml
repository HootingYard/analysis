  text: 'I wish to refute, while sipping from a glass of milk of magnesia, some of
    the less plausible claims made by that odious charlatan Dennis Cargpan in his
    woeful and, let''s face it, mercenary lecture delivered from the crumbling balcony
    of the civic hall at Bodger''s Spinney on Thursday last during the most tremendous
    hailstorm I have ever seen in my life to a gathering of bestial ingrates and orphans
    who were corralled into the square by Cargpan''s team of electric-cattle-prod-wielding
    ruffians and forced to applaud his preposterous statements.

    Chief among these statements was his contention that toads are shy, usually nocturnal
    animals, hiding during the day in dark, damp places and hopping about at night
    in search of insects, grubs, slugs, worms, and other invertebrates; that they
    are often brownish or greyish in colour and have warty skin, a flat head, swollen
    parotid glands on the side of the neck behind the eyes, bright, jewel-like eyes
    with a transverse pupil, and slightly webbed toes; that they are often stouter
    than frogs and cannot leap as far; that the tongue of the toad is attached to
    the front of its mouth; that the tongue is flicked forward from the mouth, and
    the sticky tip grasps the prey and carries it back to the mouth; that unlike most
    frogs, most toads do not have teeth; that the tongue produces quantities of mucus
    to help in swallowing; that all anurans blink when they swallow; and because there
    is no bone between the eye and the mouth, the eye is pushed against the roof of
    the mouth, forcing the food further back.

    Let me just sip some milk of magnesia before refuting this twaddle.

    There! I refute it, utterly. I do not refute it on the basis of scientific fact,
    nor on my own acute observation of the natural world, nor do I refute it because
    I have read many, many learned papers about toads which counter these statements.
    Similarly, I do not refute it in homage to my mother, who was a self-proclaimed
    expert on toads and passed down her hard-won knowledge to me, because my mother
    was bonkers and confused toads with wrens, and it should come as no surprise that
    all those articles about toads she sent off to the Reader''s Digest and the Daily
    Telegraph were tapped out on a special padded typewriter from her room in the
    Saint Cynthia Mercy Home For The Deranged And Bewildered. No. I refute this drivel
    simply because I bear a grudge against Dennis Cargpan. One day he will burn in
    hell. In the meantime I shall not rest from my refutations of every word he utters
    from that pinched and slippery mouth of his. Well may he regret the day he chuckled
    at my bouffant!
