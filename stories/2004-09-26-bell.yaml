  text: "Imagine you have never used a telephone before. It rings, and you pick up\
    \ the receiver. You don't know that the social convention is to say \u201CHello?\u201D\
    \ or \u201CDobson here. Who's calling?\u201D or something similar. So what do\
    \ you say? One man who faced this dilemma was, of course, Alexander Graham Bell,\
    \ who invented the thing, or at least got the patent on it. His preferred manner\
    \ of answering the telephone was to shout \u201CAhoy!\u201D This seems to me far\
    \ more exciting than a dull \u201CHello\u201D, and it's a pity that Bell's habit\
    \ never caught on. It is, of course, never too late to overturn various social\
    \ conventions. If we all started yelling \u201CAhoy!\u201D when answering the\
    \ telephone, the world would be just a little bit more pleasurable.\n.\nBell :\
    \ Ahoy!\nOn a vaguely related note, I take this opportunity to mention that the\
    \ first ever message sent in Morse code, by Samuel Morse himself, was \u201CWhat\
    \ hath God wrought?\u201D"
