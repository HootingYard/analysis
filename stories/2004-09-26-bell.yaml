  text: 'Imagine you have never used a telephone before. It rings, and you pick up
    the receiver. You don''t know that the social convention is to say "Hello?" or
    "Dobson here. Who''s calling?" or something similar. So what do you say? One man
    who faced this dilemma was, of course, Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the
    thing, or at least got the patent on it. His preferred manner of answering the
    telephone was to shout "Ahoy!" This seems to me far more exciting than a dull
    "Hello", and it''s a pity that Bell''s habit never caught on. It is, of course,
    never too late to overturn various social conventions. If we all started yelling
    "Ahoy!" when answering the telephone, the world would be just a little bit more
    pleasurable.

    Bell : Ahoy!

    On a vaguely related note, I take this opportunity to mention that the first ever
    message sent in Morse code, by Samuel Morse himself, was "What hath God wrought?"'
