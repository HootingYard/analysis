  text: Out in the spooky marshes, at dead of night, nothing stirred. Nothing except
    tiny nocturnal creatures whose habitat was marsh and fen. Cock an ear and you
    might hear scrabblings and scurryings, fugitive wisps of sound in the otherwise
    eerie silence. There you sit in your concrete pillbox, a primed grenade in one
    hand and a mug of tomato soup in the other. The dampness of your socks is most
    distressing. You are distressed by the dampness of your socks, in the marshes,
    in the night, but why are you holding a hand grenade? Is this wartime? Surely
    in wartime you would not be fobbed off with damp socks? A bat appears near your
    head, and you flinch. These marshes are known for their colonies of bats. Wisely,
    you sip your soup. It is piping hot. The air in the marshes is not.
