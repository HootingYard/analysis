  text: "\u201CThe Punans add some picturesque incidents. According to their version,\
    \ a huge helmeted hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil) sits by the far end of the bridge\
    \ across the river of death, and with its screams tries to terrify the ghost,\
    \ so that it shall fall from the bridge into the jaws of the great fish which\
    \ is in league with the bird. On the other side of the river is Ungap, a woman\
    \ with a cauldron and spear. Ungap, if appeased with a gift, aids the ghost to\
    \ escape from the monstrous bird and fish. Pebbles or beads are put in the nostrils\
    \ of the Punan corpse in order that they may be presented to Ungap.\u201D \u2014\
