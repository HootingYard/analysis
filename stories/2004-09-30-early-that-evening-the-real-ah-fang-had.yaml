  text: '"Early that evening, the real Ah-Fang had been waylaid by a stalwart, roughlooking
    character who had thrust a peculiarly shaped gun into the Chinese''s face.A jet
    of powerful anesthetizing vapor had shot from that gun. Ah-Fang had dipped into
    unconsciousness and had been whisked away in a powerful motor car. For the stalwart
    man was none other than Secret Agent "X" concealed behind another of his masterly
    disguises. No identity was too difficult for him to assume. His special plastic
    volatile compound could be molded to resemble the contours of any face. His own
    formulated pigments, clever toupees, faceplates, and other elements of make-up,
    had enabled him to create for himself the exact replica of the face of Ah-Fang."
