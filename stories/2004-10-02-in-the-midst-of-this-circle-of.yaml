  text: '"In the midst of this circle of dandies are three overdressed women, one
    might say three weird visions, robed in garments of pale and indefinable colours,
    embroidered with golden monsters; their great coiffures are arranged with fantastic
    art, stuck full of pins and flowers. Two are seated with their backs turned to
    me: one is holding the guitar, the other singing with that soft, pretty voice...
    the third girl is on her feet, dancing before this areopagus of idiots, with their
    lanky locks and pot-hats. What a shock when she turns round! She wears over her
    face the horribly grinning, death-like mask of a spectre or a vampire." -- Pierre
    Loti, Madame Chysantheme'
