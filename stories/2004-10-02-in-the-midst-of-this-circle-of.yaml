  text: "\u201CIn the midst of this circle of dandies are three overdressed women,\
    \ one might say three weird visions, robed in garments of pale and indefinable\
    \ colours, embroidered with golden monsters; their great coiffures are arranged\
    \ with fantastic art, stuck full of pins and flowers. Two are seated with their\
    \ backs turned to me: one is holding the guitar, the other singing with that soft,\
    \ pretty voice\u2026 the third girl is on her feet, dancing before this areopagus\
    \ of idiots, with their lanky locks and pot-hats. What a shock when she turns\
    \ round! She wears over her face the horribly grinning, death-like mask of a spectre\
    \ or a vampire.\u201D \u2014 Pierre Loti, Madame Chysantheme"
