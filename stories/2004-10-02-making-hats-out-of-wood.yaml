  text: The craft of making wooden hats is the subject of a children's activity weekend
    to be held at Bodger's Spinney next month. We are predicting excessively foul
    weather, so make sure your tiny tots are wrapped up warm. They will also need
    to wear special boots because of the violent magnetic activity which has been
    throbbing in the spinney since Mister Poxhaven overturned a jar of his experimental
    substance. The Hooting Yard Emergency Response Squadron managed to seal off part
    of the area, but they used plywood for their impromptu fence and during the night
    it tends to get gnawed by voles. This intelligence has been reported by the Pang
    Hill Vole Watching Club, who camp out by the spinney night after night, peering
    through binoculars and scribbling notes on sheets of A2 paper which they pin up
    each morning on that board outside the post office. We should be thankful to every
    last man jack of them. At the Festival of Bears and Pomposity in December they
    will be given a special prize, made out of tin, in recognition of their efforts.
    Tickets for the children's activity weekend are available from that weird dilapidated
    kiosk over by the pond. Bring your own planks.
