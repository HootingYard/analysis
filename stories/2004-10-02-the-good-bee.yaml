  text: 'Do bees make moral choices? Do they know the difference between good and
    evil? Answering these questions was the life''s work of Captain Federico Gull,
    pirate-turned-apiarist, the man who swapped a life being roguish and dastardly
    on the high seas for one spent limping around on his wooden leg among hundreds
    of beehives in a field.

    Captain Gull had been possibly the most feared buccaneer on the Spanish Main,
    or what was left of it. He was so fierce that he would eat a mouthful of carpet
    tacks for breakfast, washed down with the blood of various animals penned in the
    cargo holds, which he slaughtered with his sharp and shiny scimitar. Unlike the
    general run of pirates, however, he rarely cackled. Indeed he was not given to
    laughter, hideous or otherwise. Underneath the terrifying exterior, he was a thoughtful
    fellow, whose pleasures were found not in fighting and carousing but in resting
    on his bunk with a good book, such as the Rule of St Benedict, in his cabin strewn
    with the blossom of fragrant shrubs. Only when there was a rustle in the piles
    of blossom, and his Lovecraftian shoggoth reared its terrible head and prodded
    him to bloodlust, did Captain Gull become violent. Sometimes he wondered what
    had become of the rest of his crew, for there was not a soul else on board his
    ship.

    It was in mulling over the inconsistencies of his own behaviour that Captain Gull
    began to think about the ideal of the Good Bee. As luck would have it, one winter''s
    day a huge storm engulfed the ship and it was run aground on a remote island,
    but not before the shoggoth had been hurled overboard by the mighty tempest. Alone
    at last, Captain Gull clumped ashore, drenched and disconcerted, and camped overnight
    in a field. Next morning, exploring his new home, he discovered that the island
    was riddled with swarms of bees. The rest, children, is history.
