  text: 'We learned on Thursday that Mrs Gubbins'' second husband, Ah-Fang Van Der
    Houygendorp, died in the Hindenburg Disaster (see 30th September). The brief paragraphs
    from her autobiography-in-progress which we reproduced scarcely do justice to
    Ah-Fang, however, for he was an endlessly fascinating man, with a brain the size
    of an airship, such as that in which he perished. In his memoir The Ah-Fang I
    Knew, F X Duggleby wrote as follows:

    "Ah-Fang harboured certain ideas about phosphorescence, parallelograms, and the
    life cycle of the funnelweb spider which challenge the Weltanschauung, or at least
    my Weltanschauung. He often likened his curiosity about the world to a raven regurgitating
    food for its young, although it is difficult to grasp quite what he meant by this
    analogy. Much given to solitude, he would lie for hours in a tin bath, paring
    his fingernails insouciantly and humming what he called the ''true music of the
    spheres''. At other times, such as cocktail parties, he would start up an unearthly
    keening, pressing a medicine ball to his chest. Fluent in Flemish and Finnish,
    he was surprisingly inarticulate in such exciting languages as Wendisch, or Sorbian,
    Sea Dayak, Pedi, Pangwa, Petit Mauresque and Micmac. His widow Bathsheba once
    calculated that he devised over four hundred distinct recipes for cold soup, despite
    an abnormality of the taste buds which had afflicted him since a childhood accident
    in a meadow, on a Wednesday, with a blowtorch, in a frenzy."

    Duggleby appears to be mistaken regarding Ah-Fang''s cocktail party behaviour,
    for the man who so nearly became Pope, Giordano Sforza, left a vivid account of
    a bash one night on the outskirts of the Vatican in 1923.

    "Ah-Fang, brilliantined and slobbering, entered the room. I could see that his
    airship-sized brain was pulsating more terrifically than it usually did. I could
    see this because, like Ray Milland, I was The Man With X-Ray Eyes. I have always
    said that my special gift cost me the Papacy, but this is not the time to bemoan
    my slow decline into beggardom, penury and insignificance. No, in those days I
    struck a fine figure as the confidante of such men as Ah-Fang. His presence filled
    the room, despite all those glittering chandeliers and the expensive furniture.
    He spoke but briefly, in an aside, to some foreign ambassador of preening contemptibility,
    and I was unable to hear exactly what he said. He spent most of the evening leaning
    against a harp, steadily devouring pies and enchanting a number of floozies with
    the enigmatically mute braggadocio of his flim-flam."

    Ah-Fang''s greatest legacy may well be the dredging of the canal at Gaarg on the
    eve of the Batcake-Akido Conference, a full account of which can be found in Dobson''s
    pamphlet The Dredging Of The Canal At Gaarg On The Eve Of The Batcake-Akido Conference
    (out of print).'
