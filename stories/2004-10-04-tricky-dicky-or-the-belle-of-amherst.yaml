  text: 'Here at Hooting Yard we are always seeking new ways to help our readers achieve
    self-actualisation in the profoundest sense. To this end we commissioned Professor
    Zoltan Shuddery to devise a quiz based on his theory that all known human personality
    types can be shoehorned into two basic eidolons*. Each of us, argues Shuddery,
    is either a Richard Milhous Nixon or an Emily Dickinson. Try the quiz and see
    which one you are!

    *NOTE :Eidolon, from the Greek, means a spectre or phantom, which suggests that
    the Professor knows not of what he speaks. But it can also mean an idealised image,
    the sense in which it was sometimes used in the early 19th century, so perhaps
    that is what he is driving at.

    1. Do you like to spend long hours gazing wistfully out of an upstairs window
    in Amherst?

    2. Given the chance, would you bomb Cambodia?

    3. Look very, very carefully at the two randomly-generated photographs below.
    Assuming you were invited to share a picnic with one of these people, would it
    be person A or person B?


    Person A is the one on the left. The other one is Person B.

    When you have completed the quiz, send your answers for analysis to Professor
    Zoltan Shuddery at the usual address, marked Who Am I? He will send you a report
    of no less than fourteen closely-typed pages, individually tailored to give you
    a deep and lasting insight into your personality, indeed into your very essence.'
