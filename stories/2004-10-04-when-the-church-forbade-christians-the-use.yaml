  text: '"When the Church forbade Christians the use of poultry on fast days, it made
    an exception, out of consideration for the ancient prejudice, in favour of teal,
    widgeon, moorhens, and also two or three kinds of small amphibious quadrupeds.
    Hence probably arose the general and absurd beliefs concerning the origin of teal,
    which some said sprung from the rotten wood of old ships, others from the fruits
    of a tree, or the gum on fir-trees, whilst others thought they came from a fresh-water
    shell analogous to that of the oyster and mussel." -- Paul Lacroix, Manners, Customs
    And Dress During The Middle Ages And During The Renaissance Period'
