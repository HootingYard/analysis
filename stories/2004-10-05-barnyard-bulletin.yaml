  text: 'Today it is of decisive importance that I tell you about Blodgettesque farming
    methods. The techniques pioneered by Blodgett in his heyday are breathtaking.
    Consider, for example, the uses to which a Blodgettian farmer will put hay. There
    are many, many diagrams in the manual which show bales of hay being commandeered
    for all sorts of inventive purposes, all over the farmyard, in all six seasons
    of the year. That''s right, six seasons. One of Blodgett''s most telling innovations
    was his calendrical recalibration, if I am using the word correctly. Out go winter,
    spring, summer and autumn, or fall, as they say in Pining & Pothorst Land; in
    come tally, spate, the time of mighty remonstrations, tack, hub and bolismus.
    So, come hub come the haywain, as the saying goes, with his big fat boots stuffed
    with straw... I mean hay.

    We ought not get diverted from this important essay by wandering down the byways
    of Blodgettian countryside parlance, but I cannot resist sharing with you the
    rhyme that goes Don''t forget to shut the gate / On the forty-third of spate,
    the meaning of which is obvious, as you would realise had you seen, as I have,
    an implacable army of albino hens marching off into the sunset because little
    Vercingetorix the barnyard hobbledehoy was too busy chewing on a sheaf of fronds
    to remember to close the gate behind him. As it happened, the fronds were poisonous,
    and the miscreant was subject to convulsive fits for the next three weeks, bless
    him.

    As with hay, so with mulch. Blodgettesque mulch is a thing of beauty, even if
    it does stink. Have you ever seen asparagus grown in Blodgett''s mulch? You would
    remember if you had, for it is to common everyday asparagus as a big shiny supersonic
    26th century space rocket is to a shred of plankton. Preparation of mulch takes
    place mostly in bolismus, when the winds howl and thunderclaps shatter the eardrums
    of toiling farm workers, hardy folk with almost inhuman musculature as a result
    of regular doses of Blodgett''s serum, the recipe for which appears in an appendix
    to the manual.

    To begin farming the Blodgett way, all you will need is a hoe, a shapeless hat,
    iron determination, and your own field, preferably one with a pond in it, and
    ducks in the pond, mergansers or teal, some of them real, some of them wood-carved
    decoy ducks, and some of them just vaporous spectres of your own imagining.'
