  text: 'Yesterday''s note about ubercapitalist writer and "thinker" Ayn Rand having
    penned a work entitled Why I Like Stamp Collecting led me to wonder whether any
    other authors of portentous tomes have written similar paeans to their hobbies.
    As I cannot stir myself to do the necessary research, conjecture will have to
    do.
