  text: 'We think of Dobson primarily as a pamphleteer, albeit an out-of-print one.
    His occasional forays into public speaking, lecturing, and, it has to be said,
    jabbering like a man who has lost his marbles, are thus often overlooked. A new
    paper by Aloysius Nestingbird*= attempts to set this right. I say "attempts" because
    in my view Nestingbird has been spectacularly unsuccessful. Reading his verbose
    twaddle gave me a splitting headache after the first couple of paragraphs, and
    I went to have a lie down in a darkened room. As I lay on my pallet, I took pleasure
    in recalling my great enmity for Nestingbird. Verily, I thought to myself, staring
    at patches of badly-applied paint on the ceiling, he is a detestable old fool
    who would be better off inspecting the bed of a slimy pond than writing articles
    about Dobson. The fact that I am even older than Nestingbird is irrelevant.

    As soon as various sensory globules in my cranium had stopped pulsating, I returned
    to my desk and ploughed on through the article. Unlike its author, I am conscientious,
    and I had promised to review it for this website, for my usual fee of a tin of
    plum tomatoes and a new cravat with which I can cut a dash.

    Nestingbird focuses his attention on Dobson''s famous Declaration, which the pamphleteer
    delivered on a sopping wet Tuesday in March in the year of Nicholas Ray''s film
    Bigger Than Life, in which James Mason memorably goes bonkers on cortisone and
    announces "God was wrong!" in one of Hollywood''s finest moments. I wish I could
    say that the film and Dobson''s Declaration had some definite connection. The
    trouble is that the only record of what he said that day, standing next to a gleaming
    puddle in the bailiwick of Thrombosis Magna, is the text Marigold Chew inscribed
    on the back of a toffee apple wrapper the next day. As you can see in the reproduction
    below, even magnified as it is, her writing is far too tiny to be read by the
    average human eye, or mine at any rate.


    This is doubly frustrating, as we have to take the wretched Nestingbird''s word
    on trust--pah!--when he asserts that the entire Declaration was nothing more than
    a garbled account of Dobson dropping his bus pass down a crevasse and obtaining
    a replacement from a kiosk infested with bats.

    Now I am going to go and lie down again, to await my tomatoes and cravat.
