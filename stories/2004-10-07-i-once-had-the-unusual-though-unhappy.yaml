  text: '"I once had the unusual, though unhappy, opportunity of observing the same
    phenomenon in the brain structure of a man, who, in a paroxysm of alcoholic excitement,
    decapitated himself under the wheel of a railway carriage, and whose brain was
    instantaneously evolved from the skull by the crash. The brain itself, entire,
    was before me within three minutes after the death... It looked as if it had been
    recently injected with vermilion. The white matter of the cerebrum, studded with
    red points, could scarcely be distinguished, when it was incised, by its natural
    whiteness; and the pia-mater, or internal vascular membrane covering the brain,
    resembled a delicate web of coagulated red blood, so tensely were its fine vessels
    engorged." -- T S Arthur, Grappling With The Monster, or, The Curse and the Cure
    of Strong Drink'
