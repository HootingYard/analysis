  text: "Long ago, almost seven months ago in fact, we published a playlist of favourite\
    \ pieces of music selected by Pansy Cradledew (see 23rd March). It seems like\
    \ a good idea to repeat the exercise. Here, then, are ten pieces chosen by reader\
    \ Poppy Nisbet:\n1. The windows of the world\u2014Dionne Warwick\n2. There is\
    \ only one lie, there is only one truth\u2014Cornelius Cardew\n3. Fitter Stoke\
    \ has a bath\u2014Hatfield & The North\n4. Charlie Rutlage\u2014Charles Ives\n\
    5. Sure as sin\u2014Candi Staton\n6. Spem in alium\u2014Thomas Tallis\n7. St Valentine's\
    \ Day 1978\u2014Kate & Anna McGarrigle\n8. Combing my hair in a brand new style\u2014\
    Jim White\n9. The clothiers' song\u2014The Dufay Collective\n10. Get off my cloud\u2014\
    The Rolling Stones"
