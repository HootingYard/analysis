  text: "It was Saint Hector's Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo's hood got snagged\
    \ on a tack and he turned blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. \u201C\
    Oooo\u201D said Ugo's pal Ulf, \u201CUgo, you look all blue.\u201D \u201CAck\u201D\
    \ said Ugo. \u201CI'll go and fetch your blind ma, Ugo, to see what she can do,\u201D\
    \ said Ulf, though he could have pulled Ugo's hood off the tack on which it was\
    \ snagged. But Ulf had been sniffing glue. Ulf found Ugo's ma sitting on a stool.\
    \ \u201CUgo's ma,\u201D said Ulf, \u201CUgo has turned blue. His hood is snagged\
    \ on a tack.\u201D Ugo's ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool and\
    \ ran to Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Ugo's ma spat out her chew, and it landed\
    \ in a pot of glue. It was the glue Ugo's pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo's ma\
    \ unsnagged Ugo's hood from the tack. \u201CAck\u201D said Ugo. \u201COoo, Ugo's\
    \ ma, I knew you would know what to do,\u201D said Ulf. Ugo's ma clouted Ulf on\
    \ the head with a spoon, and confiscated his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes.\
    \ It was time for mass. At Saint Hector's Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv."
