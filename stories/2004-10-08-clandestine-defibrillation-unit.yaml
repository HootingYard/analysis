  text: "I work for a clandestine defibrillation unit. They call me Lars. My real\
    \ name is Odo, but they call me Lars because we are clandestine. I have what some\
    \ consider a grandiose hat. My parents had a hat shop, called Hats of Grandiosity,\
    \ and they gave me this hat when I left home. I did not wish to be part of the\
    \ hat trade, much to my parents' consternation. On my eleventh birthday, a tad\
    \ precociously, I announced that I saw my future in the world of clandestine defibrillation.\n\
    \u201COdo,\u201D said my parents, simultaneously, \u201CYou have our blessing.\u201D\
    \ They always spoke at the same time, using identical words and vocal inflections.\
    \ It was uncanny. I grew up thinking all married couples were like that, and it\
    \ came as something of a shock when I got married myself, to the delightful Zelda,\
    \ and discovered that not only did we not speak alike, we did not think alike,\
    \ at all. Zelda's preoccupations were putty, dreadnoughts and the Boxer Rising,\
    \ subjects of very little interest to me. I did make some attempt to show an interest\
    \ in putty, but my wife grew impatient with my hamfisted flapping, like a seal\
    \ on an ice floe. After six months, she decamped to Tantarabim with a post office\
    \ worker who wore brilliantine in his hair and shared her passion for putty.\n\
    I was distraught, of course, and considered pursuing her to plight my troth, but\
    \ in the clandestine defibrillation business the devil takes the hindmost. We\
    \ had just received a document imploring us to wreak our tiptop skills in an abandoned\
    \ birdcage factory on the banks of the old dried-up river in Pointy Town. My supervisor,\
    \ who not only looked like but had the very same name as Tuesday Weld, said to\
    \ me, \u201CLars, I know your wife has run off with a brilliantined putty enthusiast,\
    \ but this job is decisively important. If we crack it, we will be hailed throughout\
    \ the world of clandestine defibrillation units. The grandiosity of our reputation\
    \ will match that of your hat.\u201D\nI could not argue with that. Indeed, I could\
    \ never argue with Tuesday Weld. So off we went in our jeep, terrifying small\
    \ domestic animals as we sped screeching along the narrow and dangerous roads\
    \ to Pointy Town. The citizenry had put out flags to welcome us, even though they\
    \ knew we were clandestine. Tuesday Weld was furious, more furious than I had\
    \ ever seen her. Not even when her pencil sharpener was mislaid by a Tasmanian\
    \ duck doctor was she so furious.\n\u201CRemove those flags!\u201D she cried,\
    \ jumping from the jeep. The rest of us skulked into the birdcage factory and\
    \ defibrillated it, clandestinely. Then Tuesday Weld took us to the Pointy Town\
    \ bistro and bought us cake. I chose a chocolate swiss roll."
