  text: "\u201CSpem in alium is surely not just the greatest of all Thomas Tallis'\
    \ musical achievements, but one of the great musical compositions of all time.\
    \ Writing for forty independent voices, Thomas Tallis created a noble and imaginative\
    \ masterpiece.\u201D That's what one of the record companies selling a CD of the\
    \ motet\u2014chosen yesterday by Poppy Nisbet\u2014has to say, and I don't disagree.\
    \ It is quite sublime.\nIn these leaden days when nobody knows Latin anymore,\
    \ it is useful to provide a translation of the title. I was somewhat disconcerted\
    \ by this email from Tim Thurn:\n\u201CSpem in alium: alium is Latin for onion,\
    \ so Spem in must mean The world is just a great big. Close listening reveals\
    \ an astonishing affinity between Tallis' work and the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell\
    \ soul classic. For those who think garlic is a more accurate rendering of alium,\
    \ and if we accept that spem translates as hope, then the motet is clearly an\
    \ eleven minute incantation to ward off vampires. In the week of Michael Howard's\
    \ Conservative Party conference, it is essential listening.\u201D\nI suggest Tim\
    \ buys himself a Latin dictionary. The full title of the work is Spem in alium\
    \ numquam habui, which means I have never put my hope in any other. Tallis is\
    \ referring not to Michael Howard, Marvin Gaye, nor Tammi Terrell, but to Deus\
    \ Israel qui irasceris et propitius eris et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione\
    \ dimittis, the God of Israel who will be angry and yet become again gracious\
    \ and who forgives all the sins of suffering man. Whether He, She or It will forgive\
    \ Tim Thurn's sins is a moot point. I wouldn't.\n\nThomas Tallis"
