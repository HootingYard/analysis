  text: '"Spem in alium is surely not just the greatest of all Thomas Tallis'' musical
    achievements, but one of the great musical compositions of all time. Writing for
    forty independent voices, Thomas Tallis created a noble and imaginative masterpiece."
    That''s what one of the record companies selling a CD of the motet--chosen yesterday
    by Poppy Nisbet--has to say, and I don''t disagree. It is quite sublime.

    In these leaden days when nobody knows Latin anymore, it is useful to provide
    a translation of the title. I was somewhat disconcerted by this email from Tim
    Thurn:

    "Spem in alium: alium is Latin for onion, so Spem in must mean The world is just
    a great big. Close listening reveals an astonishing affinity between Tallis''
    work and the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell soul classic. For those who think garlic
    is a more accurate rendering of alium, and if we accept that spem translates as
    hope, then the motet is clearly an eleven minute incantation to ward off vampires.
    In the week of Michael Howard''s Conservative Party conference, it is essential
    listening."

    I suggest Tim buys himself a Latin dictionary. The full title of the work is Spem
    in alium numquam habui, which means I have never put my hope in any other. Tallis
    is referring not to Michael Howard, Marvin Gaye, nor Tammi Terrell, but to Deus
    Israel qui irasceris et propitius eris et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione
    dimittis, the God of Israel who will be angry and yet become again gracious and
    who forgives all the sins of suffering man. Whether He, She or It will forgive
    Tim Thurn''s sins is a moot point. I wouldn''t.
