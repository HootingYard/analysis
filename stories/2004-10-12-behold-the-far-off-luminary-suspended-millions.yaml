  text: '"Behold the far off luminary suspended millions and billions and trillions
    of miles in space; then turn the eye yonder and see that infinitesimal point of
    vegetation, earth--a speck, countless multitudes of which heaped and piled together
    would form but a point compared with that majestic sun! Yet behold it move and
    expand beneath the long fibrous rays which that effulgent orb sends down through
    so many billions of miles to the place of its minute existence. Even as that poor
    little existence shoots out its fibres to meet those rays which have travelled
    such great lengths, so a spirit in the spheres feels the quickening, effulgent
    rays thrown out by the brain of some prophet or poet existing millions and billions
    and trillions of miles away on some distant spirit planet, and his thought expands
    and enlarges beneath the warming action of that far-off brain, until it assumes
    a shape and form which its own emulation never prophesied." -- Henry J Horn, Strange
    Visitors, A Series Of Original Papers, Embracing Philosophy, Science, Government,
    Religion, Poetry, Art, Fiction, Satire, Humor, Narrative, And Prophecy, By The
    Spirits Of Irving, Willis, Thackeray, Bronte, Richter, Byron, Humboldt, Hawthorne,
