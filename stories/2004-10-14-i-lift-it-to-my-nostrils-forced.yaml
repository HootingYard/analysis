  text: '"I lift it to my nostrils, forced to do so by an irresistible fascination;
    and even through that hermetical sealing it seems to me as if I perceived a whiff
    of death--a charnel odor that is horrible. It may be, nevertheless, only fancy
    working on me with the heavy air of this recent corpse-chamber in which I live.
    It is not poison, but that fluid, even through its stout glass walls, murders
    me like a slow lightning! O my God! would that I could bury it, burn it, dash
    it from me where it would never return! But it is an indestructible phial of vengeance--a
    fluid doom of hell--never, never, never to be exiled from me any more!" -- Fitzhugh
