  text: "\u201CI lift it to my nostrils, forced to do so by an irresistible fascination;\
    \ and even through that hermetical sealing it seems to me as if I perceived a\
    \ whiff of death\u2014a charnel odor that is horrible. It may be, nevertheless,\
    \ only fancy working on me with the heavy air of this recent corpse-chamber in\
    \ which I live. It is not poison, but that fluid, even through its stout glass\
    \ walls, murders me like a slow lightning! O my God! would that I could bury it,\
    \ burn it, dash it from me where it would never return! But it is an indestructible\
    \ phial of vengeance\u2014a fluid doom of hell\u2014never, never, never to be\
    \ exiled from me any more!\u201D \u2014 Fitzhugh Ludlow, The Phial Of Dread: By\
