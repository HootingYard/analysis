  text: Dobson once spent a week making a list of all the things he chewed. From Thursday
    to the following Wednesday, each time he chewed something he wrote down a keyword
    on a fresh sheet of A4 paper. So, for example, Saturday morning's batch included
    suet, button, Garibaldi biscuit, pencil, pastille, tongue, bootlace, boiled sweet
    and cork. Armed with a large sheaf of paper, the out-of-print pamphleteer spent
    the following week annotating these bald words. He wrote potted histories of manufacturing
    processes, Proustian evocations, trivial facts, hallucinatory scribblings, and
    passages of pseudo-scientific conjecture. He even added some crayon drawings that
    can best be described as primitive. In each case he restricted himself to the
    single A4 sheet. The work complete, he hawked his manuscript around all the publishing
    firms he knew who had offices in the slums. Not one of them would take it. In
    despair, Dobson stowed away on an aeroplane bound for Winnipeg, where he cast
    his manuscript into the Assiniboine. Returning home, he wrote the pitiful pamphlet
    How My Annotated List Of Chewed Things Was Lost In A Muddy Canadian River, copies
    of which he gave as Christmas presents to his friends in 1958.
