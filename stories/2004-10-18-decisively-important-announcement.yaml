  text: "Following a plenary session of the Hooting Yard Editorial Committee, chaired\
    \ by Mrs Gubbins, who also supplied platefuls of contaminated pastry-based confections,\
    \ it has been decided to rename the Hooting Yard website for an experimental period.\
    \ Until further notice, this collection of prose and pictures will be known as:\n\
    \nand the new logo will be, not as you might think Audubon's depiction of the\
    \ foolish guillemot--murre, but his equally splendid common gallinule:\n\nThis\
    \ bird has the pensive, concentrated look that we hope to elicit from all our\
    \ readers. Do try to remember the new name of the site, and next time you are\
    \ at an ambassadorial cocktail party, works outing, or indeed just babbling loudly\
    \ into your mobile phone like a nincompoop, do not say \u201CGosh, yes, Hooting\
    \ Yard certainly makes me chuckle!\u201D but instead \u201CWell, heavens to Betsy,\
    \ have you seen the latest in The Foolish Guillemot--Murre?\u201D Many thanks\
    \ in advance for your cooperation with this important new initiative."
