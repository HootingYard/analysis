  text: 'Following a plenary session of the Hooting Yard Editorial Committee, chaired
    by Mrs Gubbins, who also supplied platefuls of contaminated pastry-based confections,
    it has been decided to rename the Hooting Yard website for an experimental period.
    Until further notice, this collection of prose and pictures will be known as:


    and the new logo will be, not as you might think Audubon''s depiction of the foolish
    guillemot--murre, but his equally splendid common gallinule:


    This bird has the pensive, concentrated look that we hope to elicit from all our
    readers. Do try to remember the new name of the site, and next time you are at
    an ambassadorial cocktail party, works outing, or indeed just babbling loudly
    into your mobile phone like a nincompoop, do not say "Gosh, yes, Hooting Yard
    certainly makes me chuckle!" but instead "Well, heavens to Betsy, have you seen
    the latest in The Foolish Guillemot--Murre?" Many thanks in advance for your cooperation
    with this important new initiative.'
