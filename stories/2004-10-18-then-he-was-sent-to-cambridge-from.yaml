  text: "\u201C\u2026then he was sent to Cambridge. From there he wrote to his mother,\
    \ \u2018I am penetrating into the inmost recesses of the Muses; climbing high\
    \ Olympus, visiting the green pastures of Parnassus, and drinking deep from Pierian\
    \ Springs\u2019. This is terrible language for a child of fourteen. A boy who\
    \ should talk like that now would be regarded with anxious concern by his loving\
    \ parents. The present age is incredulous of the Infant Phenomenon. And no fond\
    \ parent must for a moment imagine that by following the system laid out for the\
    \ education of John Milton can a John Milton be produced.\u201D \u2014 Elbert\
    \ Hubbard, Little Journeys To The Homes Of English Authors"
