  text: '"...then he was sent to Cambridge. From there he wrote to his mother, ''I
    am penetrating into the inmost recesses of the Muses; climbing high Olympus, visiting
    the green pastures of Parnassus, and drinking deep from Pierian Springs''. This
    is terrible language for a child of fourteen. A boy who should talk like that
    now would be regarded with anxious concern by his loving parents. The present
    age is incredulous of the Infant Phenomenon. And no fond parent must for a moment
    imagine that by following the system laid out for the education of John Milton
    can a John Milton be produced." -- Elbert Hubbard, Little Journeys To The Homes
