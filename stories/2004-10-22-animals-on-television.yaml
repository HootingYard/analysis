  text: We try to keep abreast of the latest news in the world o' television, and
    have just learned that the BBC's popular countryside programme One Man And His
    Dog, in which shepherds and sheepdogs display their skills, is to be axed. Our
    sources tell us that it will be replaced in the new year by One Man And His Swarm
    Of Killer Bees, presented by V S Naipaul and Liza Minnelli.
