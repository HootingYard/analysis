  text: "Number One in a series of Biblical Reenactments with Dr Ruth Pastry\nNebuchadnezzar\
    \ made a huge golden idol, and at its dedication proclaimed that at the sound\
    \ of special music everyone must worship. But Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego refused.\
    \ Chaldean nobles informed the King of their defiance, and he angrily threatened\
    \ to cast them into a furnace. \u201CWhat god can save you then?\u201D he cried.\
    \ \u201COur God is able; but even if He does not we will not worship the image,\u201D\
    \ they replied. Then the strongest men in the army were ordered to bind them.\
    \ Fully clothed, they were flung into the burning, fiery furnace, the heat of\
    \ which killed the men who did so. Suddenly the King cried: \u201CI can see four\
    \ men walking in the flames unhurt. The fourth is like the Son of God.\u201D And\
    \ when they came out, untouched by fire, King Nebuchadnezzar said: \u201CBlessed\
    \ be their God!\u201D\n\nWhat actually happened (left) and a reenactment (right)\
    \ \u2026 or possibly vice versa\nThis reenactment will need a minimum of seven\
    \ participants, one each to play the parts of Nebuchadnezzar, Shadrach, Meshach,\
    \ Abednego, and the phantom who looks like the Son of God, one to represent the\
    \ Chaldean nobles, and another to be the army strong men. You will need to dig\
    \ a large pit, at the bottom of which should be placed sufficient straw and kindling\
    \ (such as scrunched up newspaper or small twigs) to provide a healthy blaze.\
    \ Douse this in petrol to make quite sure\u2014you do not want your audience to\
    \ traipse home disappointed. As soon as the pit is ignited, the person playing\
    \ the army strong men pushes the Godly trio into it, then immediately keels over\
    \ with screams of agony and lies still. After the King has said his lines, Shadrach,\
    \ Meshach and Abednego climb out of the pit. They should wait to attend the burns\
    \ unit until the King delivers his closing words, spoken with due awe.\nNote that\
    \ the person playing the Son of God should be hiding in the pit from the beginning\
    \ of the reenactment, and must not clamber out of the pit with the others, otherwise\
    \ his \u201Cvisionary\u201D status is compromised.\nIf you have difficulty mustering\
    \ sufficient numbers, a two-person version is playable, with one as Shadrach,\
    \ Meshach, Abednego, and the Son of God figure, and the other as the King, the\
    \ nobles and the army. As you can appreciate, the logistics of this can be quite\
    \ overwhelming for amateurs. And be warned that audiences find this version a\
    \ little far-fetched and may boo, hiss, and throw projectiles such as tomatoes,\
    \ potatoes, and the hot entrails of recently sacrificed poultry."
