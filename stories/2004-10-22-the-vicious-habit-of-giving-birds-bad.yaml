  text: "\u201CThe vicious habit of giving birds bad names is one that grows, and\
    \ you never know when the scientific have come to a finality. For instance, little\
    \ Robin Red-Breast has successively lived through three tags, Turdus migratorius,\
    \ Planesticus migratorius, and Turdus canadensis. If he had not been an especially\
    \ plucky little beggar he would have died under the libels long ago. For my own\
    \ part I cannot conceive how a man with good red blood in his veins could look\
    \ a chirky little robin in the eye and call him to his face a Planesticus migratorius,\
    \ when as chubby youngster he had known the bird and loved him as Robin Red-Breast.\
    \ One is inclined to ask with suspicion, \u2018Is naming a lost art?\u2019\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Agnes Deans Cameron, The New North : Being Some Account Of A Woman's\
    \ Journey Through Canada To The Arctic"
