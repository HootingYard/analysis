  text: '"The vicious habit of giving birds bad names is one that grows, and you never
    know when the scientific have come to a finality. For instance, little Robin Red-Breast
    has successively lived through three tags, Turdus migratorius, Planesticus migratorius,
    and Turdus canadensis. If he had not been an especially plucky little beggar he
    would have died under the libels long ago. For my own part I cannot conceive how
    a man with good red blood in his veins could look a chirky little robin in the
    eye and call him to his face a Planesticus migratorius, when as chubby youngster
    he had known the bird and loved him as Robin Red-Breast. One is inclined to ask
    with suspicion, ''Is naming a lost art?''" -- Agnes Deans Cameron, The New North
    : Being Some Account Of A Woman''s Journey Through Canada To The Arctic'
