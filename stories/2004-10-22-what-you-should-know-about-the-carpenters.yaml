  text: 'Karen played the drums and sang. Her brother Richard played keyboards and
    supplied backing vocals. Unfortunately, Karen died young. Richard is still alive,
    still active in music, but The Carpenters as a duo are no longer with us.

    These bare facts stated, astute readers will note the remarkable similarities
    between The Carpenters and the homonymic The Carpenters who were so successful
    during the 1970s with songs such as Close To You and Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary
    Craft. Neither of these songs was recorded by The Carpenters of whom we speak,
    for their music was somewhat different, an outre blend of salsa, bluegrass, acid
    jazz, bell-ringing and caterwauling, often driven by motorised electric balalaikas
    programmed by Karen. Richard was known to be fond of factory hooters.

    Their debut album, The Carpenters Play The Music Of James Last From An Abandoned
    Salt Mine, included the astonishing sixteen-minute Dying Bee Music # 8, which
    featured guests including Blodgett, Blodgett''s dentist, Blodgett''s dentist''s
    dentist, and a young, impressionable Scottish lad called Midge Ure. Sales were
    few, and a booking on a transatlantic cruise liner proved ill-advised. Neither
    Karen nor Richard could swim, and when the ship sank off the Auckland Islands
    they spent six weeks marooned in a dinghy, fighting. Some say Karen''s health
    problems stemmed from this ordeal, and they well be right, but in the words of
    the old farmyard saying, "Never put two carpenters in the same dinghy".

    Their annus mirabilis was probably 1975. In a nine-month period, they released
    no less than twenty-six EPs, each of which was conceived as a "punitive retrenchment",
    to use Richard''s phrase. Karen scoffed at this description, incidentally, preferring
    to think of these matchless works as "lullabyes for locust swarms". The most startling
    thing about the records is the pared-down instrumentation--Karen thumping the
    sole of her boot on a giant drum, Richard tentatively prodding the black keys
    on a plastic toy piano. Both sang, of course, or rather hummed, gargled and choked.

    After Karen toppled from a radio mast in 1981, Richard approved the release of
    just one further recording, a set of minuets, bagatelles, and oompahs arranged
    for brass band and an electronically-enhanced flock of chaffinches. Karen''s drumming
    had been recorded pneumatically in the clinic where she spent her final years,
    sitting slumped on a catbird seat wrapped in a gaudy and enormous poncho which
    engulfed her tiny, wasted body.

    We attempted to interview Richard for this short article, but his people sent
    an email saying that he was far too peevish.'
