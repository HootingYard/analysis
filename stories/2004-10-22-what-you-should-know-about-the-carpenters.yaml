  text: "Karen played the drums and sang. Her brother Richard played keyboards and\
    \ supplied backing vocals. Unfortunately, Karen died young. Richard is still alive,\
    \ still active in music, but The Carpenters as a duo are no longer with us.\n\
    These bare facts stated, astute readers will note the remarkable similarities\
    \ between The Carpenters and the homonymic The Carpenters who were so successful\
    \ during the 1970s with songs such as Close To You and Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary\
    \ Craft. Neither of these songs was recorded by The Carpenters of whom we speak,\
    \ for their music was somewhat different, an outr\xE9 blend of salsa, bluegrass,\
    \ acid jazz, bell-ringing and caterwauling, often driven by motorised electric\
    \ balalaikas programmed by Karen. Richard was known to be fond of factory hooters.\n\
    Their debut album, The Carpenters Play The Music Of James Last From An Abandoned\
    \ Salt Mine, included the astonishing sixteen-minute Dying Bee Music # 8, which\
    \ featured guests including Blodgett, Blodgett's dentist, Blodgett's dentist's\
    \ dentist, and a young, impressionable Scottish lad called Midge Ure. Sales were\
    \ few, and a booking on a transatlantic cruise liner proved ill-advised. Neither\
    \ Karen nor Richard could swim, and when the ship sank off the Auckland Islands\
    \ they spent six weeks marooned in a dinghy, fighting. Some say Karen's health\
    \ problems stemmed from this ordeal, and they well be right, but in the words\
    \ of the old farmyard saying, \u201CNever put two carpenters in the same dinghy\u201D\
    .\nTheir annus mirabilis was probably 1975. In a nine-month period, they released\
    \ no less than twenty-six EPs, each of which was conceived as a \u201Cpunitive\
    \ retrenchment\u201D, to use Richard's phrase. Karen scoffed at this description,\
    \ incidentally, preferring to think of these matchless works as \u201Clullabyes\
    \ for locust swarms\u201D. The most startling thing about the records is the pared-down\
    \ instrumentation\u2014Karen thumping the sole of her boot on a giant drum, Richard\
    \ tentatively prodding the black keys on a plastic toy piano. Both sang, of course,\
    \ or rather hummed, gargled and choked.\nAfter Karen toppled from a radio mast\
    \ in 1981, Richard approved the release of just one further recording, a set of\
    \ minuets, bagatelles, and oompahs arranged for brass band and an electronically-enhanced\
    \ flock of chaffinches. Karen's drumming had been recorded pneumatically in the\
    \ clinic where she spent her final years, sitting slumped on a catbird seat wrapped\
    \ in a gaudy and enormous poncho which engulfed her tiny, wasted body.\nWe attempted\
    \ to interview Richard for this short article, but his people sent an email saying\
    \ that he was far too peevish."
