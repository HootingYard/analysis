  text: "\u201CThe music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, \u2018I am\
    \ Eric North!\u2019 The sword point jerked and the sentinel straightened. His\
    \ face was white. He cried aloud, \u2018It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the\
    \ Legend\u2019. He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal hat,\
    \ and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes\u2026 The helmet contained an electrical\
    \ circuit, designed as a shield against electrical waves tuned to affect his brain.\
    \ But the hat had failed\u2026\u201D \u2014 V E Thiessen, The Beast-Jewel Of Mars"
