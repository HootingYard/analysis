  text: One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to
    the yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard,
    Ugo's blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo started
    to sound like a goose. "Ooo," said Ugo's ma, "What am I to do? A shrew and a goose!"
    Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. "Wow!" said Ugo's pal Ulf, who came tumbling
    into the yard dressed up like a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. "Is that you, Ugo's
    pal Ulf?" asked Ugo's ma. "Woo woo woo," said Ulf. "Ulf, there is a shrew and
    a goose and a cow in my yard," said Ugo's ma. "No, Ugo's ma," said Ulf, "It's
    only Ugo being loopy." "Ah," said Ugo's ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo's pal Ulf off
    to school. On a tram. In Plovdiv.
