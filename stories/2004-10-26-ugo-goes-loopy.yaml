  text: "One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out\
    \ to the yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her\
    \ yard, Ugo's blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But\
    \ Ugo started to sound like a goose. \u201COoo,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201CWhat\
    \ am I to do? A shrew and a goose!\u201D Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. \u201C\
    Wow!\u201D said Ugo's pal Ulf, who came tumbling into the yard dressed up like\
    \ a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. \u201CIs that you, Ugo's pal Ulf?\u201D asked\
    \ Ugo's ma. \u201CWoo woo woo,\u201D said Ulf. \u201CUlf, there is a shrew and\
    \ a goose and a cow in my yard,\u201D said Ugo's ma. \u201CNo, Ugo's ma,\u201D\
    \ said Ulf, \u201CIt's only Ugo being loopy.\u201D \u201CAh,\u201D said Ugo's\
    \ ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo's pal Ulf off to school. On a tram. In Plovdiv."
