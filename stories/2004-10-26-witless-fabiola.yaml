  text: 'Witless Fabiola is one of the archetypes in the complex mythology of the
    Tundists. Of the many stories about her, perhaps the most important is the legend
    in which she is sent out west on a Tundist quest to find a hornets'' nest but
    becomes distressed and sits down to rest, and while she rests she has a dream
    about a giant bream swimming in a stream lit by a moonbeam the colour of cream.
    In other tales, Witless Fabiola does deeds of derring-do, fights phantom crustacea
    in the tide pools of Tantarabim, wraps herself in flags, and--in an apocryphal
    story--turns into a zombie goddess who causes thunderstorms and blizzards and
    other meteorological phenomena.

    Witless Fabiola is usually depicted holding a trident in her left hand and some
    birdseed in her right, wearing a cape spun of crocus stalks, her left foot trampling
    on the neck of a subjugated cormorant. Sometimes she is given a human head, with
    a mop of frazzled black hair not unlike, say, Robert Smith''s of The Cure. In
    other images, inspired by the breakaway Pseudotundist sect, her head is that of
    a merganser duck or booby.

    Tundist scholar Ernesto Hudihudimojo has compiled an anthology of legends about
    Witless Fabiola, none of which is longer than a couple of hundred words, and all
    of which peter out quite irritatingly. The reader is desperate to know more, but
    Dr Hudihudimojo points to the authenticity of his retellings, and argues that
    one of the crucial features of Tundist myth is the eschewing of "closure".

    We asked the publishers for permission to reprint some of these stories, but they
    just grunted at our representative and sent her packing, pursued by fractious
    toddlers armed with pebbles.'
