  text: 'With less than a week to go before the election of a new Potus in Pining
    & Pothorst Land (see 2nd September), the British government announced a canny
    little reorganisation. At a press conference to launch the new Department of Railings
    and Pewter, a spokesperson said: "The great thing about this new department is
    that, irrespective of whether the new Potus is Democrat or Republican, here in
    Britain we have gathered everything to do with railings and pewter under a single
    office. Not only will this make transatlantic railings and pewter issues much
    easier to manage, it also streamlines our own approach to both railings and pewter,
    which until now have been the responsibility of different departments often working
    at cross-purposes."

    The appointment of the new cabinet-level Minister for Railings and Pewter is being
    kept under wraps for the time being, due to insufferable pomposity and an outbreak
    of Blotzmann''s Syndrome at Whitehall. Dashing and windswept flying doctors have
    been helicoptered in to cope with the chaos.

    "Never let it be said that this government does not take both railings and pewter
    seriously," said one MP. "Never, ever. And if such a slur is ever made, woe betide
    the ragamuffin who makes it, for they will be chased across Parliament Square
    by my horse, Little Tim, and forced to eat their words."
