  text: "With less than a week to go before the election of a new Potus in Pining\
    \ & Pothorst Land (see 2nd September), the British government announced a canny\
    \ little reorganisation. At a press conference to launch the new Department of\
    \ Railings and Pewter, a spokesperson said: \u201CThe great thing about this new\
    \ department is that, irrespective of whether the new Potus is Democrat or Republican,\
    \ here in Britain we have gathered everything to do with railings and pewter under\
    \ a single office. Not only will this make transatlantic railings and pewter issues\
    \ much easier to manage, it also streamlines our own approach to both railings\
    \ and pewter, which until now have been the responsibility of different departments\
    \ often working at cross-purposes.\u201D\nThe appointment of the new cabinet-level\
    \ Minister for Railings and Pewter is being kept under wraps for the time being,\
    \ due to insufferable pomposity and an outbreak of Bl\xF6tzmann's Syndrome at\
    \ Whitehall. Dashing and windswept flying doctors have been helicoptered in to\
    \ cope with the chaos.\n\u201CNever let it be said that this government does not\
    \ take both railings and pewter seriously,\u201D said one MP. \u201CNever, ever.\
    \ And if such a slur is ever made, woe betide the ragamuffin who makes it, for\
    \ they will be chased across Parliament Square by my horse, Little Tim, and forced\
    \ to eat their words.\u201D\nThe logo of the new department is shown below. Look\
    \ out for it next time you are looking out for the logo of a new government department.\n"
