  text: "Indefatigable detectives from the incident room at the Blister Lane Bypass\
    \ have issued a photofit picture of a man they think might be British fugitive\
    \ Lord Lucan. Older readers will recall that Lucan\u2014a descendant of one of\
    \ the blinkered aristocratic noodleheads who sent soldiers to certain death in\
    \ the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War\u2014has been on the\
    \ run for thirty years after allegedly murdering his children's nanny after mistaking\
    \ her for his poor long-suffering wife.\n\nDoughty Inspector Cargpan said: \u201C\
    This chap's been seen burrowing round in ditches over the last few weeks. He was\
    \ spotted by a passing ironmonger who was delivering some metal hubs to the metal\
    \ hub storage facility at six o clock on Tuesday morning, then again by one of\
    \ the Righteous Brothers in mid-afternoon. Both these concerned citizens reported\
    \ his presence to my lads down at the nick, so we unleashed the sniffer dogs and\
    \ made a thorough search of the area. We haven't found him, although we did discover\
    \ a nest of newborn starlings which we've taken back to the station for the desk\
    \ sergeant, who is of an ornithological bent. Anyway, if you see this ne'er-do-well,\
    \ let us know. I am one hundred and ten percent sure he is Lord Lucan, even if\
    \ he has shaved off his 'tache at some point in the last three decades.\u201D"
