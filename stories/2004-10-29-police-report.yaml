  text: 'Indefatigable detectives from the incident room at the Blister Lane Bypass
    have issued a photofit picture of a man they think might be British fugitive Lord
    Lucan. Older readers will recall that Lucan--a descendant of one of the blinkered
    aristocratic noodleheads who sent soldiers to certain death in the Charge of the
    Light Brigade during the Crimean War--has been on the run for thirty years after
    allegedly murdering his children''s nanny after mistaking her for his poor long-suffering
    wife.


    Doughty Inspector Cargpan said: "This chap''s been seen burrowing round in ditches
    over the last few weeks. He was spotted by a passing ironmonger who was delivering
    some metal hubs to the metal hub storage facility at six o clock on Tuesday morning,
    then again by one of the Righteous Brothers in mid-afternoon. Both these concerned
    citizens reported his presence to my lads down at the nick, so we unleashed the
    sniffer dogs and made a thorough search of the area. We haven''t found him, although
    we did discover a nest of newborn starlings which we''ve taken back to the station
    for the desk sergeant, who is of an ornithological bent. Anyway, if you see this
    ne''er-do-well, let us know. I am one hundred and ten percent sure he is Lord
    Lucan, even if he has shaved off his ''tache at some point in the last three decades."'
