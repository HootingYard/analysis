  text: Yes, that's what I said, the field of the cloth of gold. That is where I have
    just been, and it is where I want you to go. So up you get from your bed of straw,
    pin those crutches under your armpits, and get cracking. I have made you a packed
    lunch of beetroot pie, potato thirds and juice squeezed from nettles, so you will
    not go hungry on your journey. Wait. I want you to take this owl with you. There
    are far too many fieldmice scurrying around in the field of the cloth of gold,
    and the owl will tear them to shreds with its lacerating beak. The lucky ones
    will escape by running off to the adjoining field, if luck is something one can
    ascribe to mice. What do you think? Does Dame Fortune shine her bright lantern
    on such tiny beasts, or is she only concerned with that which is human? Speaking
    of which, you had better have a wash and spruce yourself up before you go. You
    look as if you haven't been out of that bed of straw for months. Just because
    all the bones in both your legs are fractured beyond repair is no excuse. Why
    do you think I shelled out ten fat coins to buy you the crutches? Why do you think
    I got Old Hengist to varnish them so splendidly? Take the owl to the field of
    the cloth of gold and come straight back. I have another job for you. The spigot
    is jammed, and not for nothing are you known as The Man Who Can Unjam Spigots
    With His Eyes Shut. Get thee hence!
