  text: '"There have been some curious speculations lately as to the conveyance of
    mental consciousness by ''brain-waves''. What does it matter how it is conveyed?
    The consciousness itself is not a wave. It may be accompanied here or there by
    any quantity of quivers and shakes, up or down, of anything you can find in the
    universe that is shakeable--what is that to me?" -- John Ruskin, The Queen Of
    The Air'
