  text: "\u201CHe was wholly absorbed in the making of a nondescript machine, a sort\
    \ of crude harmonica with a clock-spring reed, a magnet, and a wire. It was a\
    \ most absurd toy in appearance. It was unlike any other thing that had ever been\
    \ made in any country. The young professor had been toiling over it for three\
    \ years and it had constantly baffled him, until, on this hot afternoon in June,\
    \ 1875, he heard an almost inaudible sound\u2014a faint twang\u2014come from the\
    \ machine itself. \u2018Snap that reed again, Watson\u2019, cried the apparently\
    \ irrational young professor.\u201D \u2014 Herbert N Casson, The History Of The\
    \ Telephone"
