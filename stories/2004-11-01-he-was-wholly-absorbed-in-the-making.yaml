  text: '"He was wholly absorbed in the making of a nondescript machine, a sort of
    crude harmonica with a clock-spring reed, a magnet, and a wire. It was a most
    absurd toy in appearance. It was unlike any other thing that had ever been made
    in any country. The young professor had been toiling over it for three years and
    it had constantly baffled him, until, on this hot afternoon in June, 1875, he
    heard an almost inaudible sound--a faint twang--come from the machine itself.
    ''Snap that reed again, Watson'', cried the apparently irrational young professor."
