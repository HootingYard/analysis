  text: 'Cuppid is, as you might expect, related to Cupid, although there is a lot
    more than that extra P to help you distinguish between them. Cuppid is composed
    of both toxic and non-toxic gases, and tinkles a little golden bell whenever it
    alights upon the hairy back of a bison, which it often does, for Cuppid''s favourite
    haunts are the vast plains of North America. I say it because Cuppid is, if not
    exactly a hermaphrodite, neither male nor female, although sometimes when its
    gases cool and take on liquid form it can bear a fugitive resemblance to Sonja
    Henie (1912-1969), the legendary Norwegian figure skating champion. Such moments
    can be dangerous for Cuppid, for it is volatile, and seeks warmer air urgently
    to return to its gaseous state.

    Cuppid is invoked by farmers and by those who work with timber, for it brings
    them luck. Conversely, wrestlers and plutocrats live in fear of a visitation by
    Cuppid, and tremble at its approach. You can be sure that if you see a trembling
    plutocrat, Cuppid is not far away.

    Some say Cuppid can be trapped in an envelope or small carton and used for both
    good and ill. The common feature of such tales is that not one of them has ever
    been verified.

    Toy plastic Cuppids, coated with a special varnish to ape the appearance of gas,
    have recently become popular as gifts for children in Dawlish, Oswestry and Uttoxeter.
    This geographical exclusivity is due to factors unique to Cuppid, including the
    risk of suffocation, impending thirst, and three or four empty metal pails lined
    up in a row on the site of a long ago mudslide.

    Cuppid rotates.


    Left : Cupid. Right : Sonja Henie, or possibly Cuppid at low temperature.'
