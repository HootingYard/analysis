  text: 'Is there anything more important in the early days of November than deworming
    your goat? If you are a pig-fixated person you may wish to differ, but most if
    not all Hooting Yard readers will want to ensure that their goats are innocent
    of worms in this critical month in the Capra hircus life-cycle. Here then, are
    some useful tips. Read them carefully, making notes on a scrap of paper as appropriate,
    for you will want to refer to the tips once you have ranged across the fields
    in your big leaking boots to the goat cubicles.


    A goat (named Simon Peter) standing in front of another goat (called Pius IX)

    If possible, always weigh your goat before deworming it. Use any old scales you
    can lay your hands on, but preferably ones in which a goat will squat happily
    for a minute or two. When you have weighed your goat, you will be able to calculate
    and inject or drench the correct dosage of the dewormer. If you underdose your
    goat because of failure to weigh it, or because you fecklessly underestimate just
    how bulky or indeed unbulky it is, this may be a costly mistake. It may lead to
    your goat developing that most fearsome of conditions, viz. parasite resistance
    to dewormers! But don''t rest on your laurels like a smug goat-person, because
    an overdose of certain proprietary dewormers can cause health problems, if not
    for your goat then for you and your immediate family and the neighbours up in
    the big black house on the hill. All sorts of hideous running sores, boils and
    suppurations can occur if you overdose your goat, although I am not quite sure
    how that happens, in a strictly scientific sense. Nevertheless, you do not want
    to upset those eerie lantern-jawed neighbours of yours after what happened in
    March, up in the hills, during a thunderstorm, with all that eldritch inhuman
    howling, do you?'
