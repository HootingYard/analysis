  text: Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. Remember,
    too, the case of the distressed pig, solved by Special Agent Blot. The distressed
    pig was found in a rowing boat crossing Tantarabim Lake. Agent Blot swam out to
    it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becalmed Agent Blot took the
    oars and he rowed to the mud-splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of
    the boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plodded his way in his wellington
    boots to the pig farmer's hut down the lane, and he felled the brute with a thwack
    of his fist and bound him up with a chain. Agent Blot dragged the pig farmer off
    to the prison, bang in the centre of town. And that is why, on November the fifth,
    the distressed pig did not drown.
