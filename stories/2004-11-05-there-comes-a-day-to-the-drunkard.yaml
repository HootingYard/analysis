  text: '"There comes a day to the drunkard and the profligate and the street-walker,
    when their lawless revelry is stopped, when want stares them in the face, and
    disease grasps their misused bodies, and racks them as they lie cursing and moaning
    in their despair." -- Felicia Skene, Penitentiaries And Reformatories'
