  text: 'Despite having tiny pea-sized brains, birds may be more intelligent than
    we thought. Avian scientists have been studying crows, which are apparently able
    to carry out tasks involving food and twigs which would be beyond the wit of a
    human infant. They can also make elementary tools, like hooks, though why a crow,
    with its fierce lacerating talons, would need a hook is beyond me. The cleverest
    crow in the study, incidentally, was called Betty, which seems an unusual name
    for a crow. If I had a pet crow, which I do not, I would call it something like
    Cecilia, or Hortense, or perhaps Clytemnestra! But Betty was a New Caledonian
    crow, so perhaps that is pertinent.

    In trying to explain why minuscule bird brains are able to wield such unexpected
    mental power, the scientists suggest that they may work in entirely different
    ways to the brains of mammals. Apprised of this, Pansy Cradledew has suggested
    that I could challenge Edward De Bono and Tony Buzan as a self-styled brain expert
    and churn out a series of books, with titles such as Think Like A Crow, Rewire
    Your Brain The Cormorant Way, and Storm Petrel Thought Patterns Made Easy.'
