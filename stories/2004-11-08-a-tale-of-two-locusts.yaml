  text: 'Once upon a time there were two locusts. One was solitary. It liked to mope
    by itself and shunned the company of other locusts, even its own extended family.
    It was bitter, because of some perceived slight in the past


    The second locust, by contrast, was gregarious. It was the life and soul of the
    party. You can bet that if a swarm was gathering, this locust would be in the
    thick of it.


    Do you remember that old Rolf Harris hit, Two Little Boys? Well, what took place
    with these two locusts was very similar to the story told in that song. What seems
    so unfair is that, because they were locusts, no one ever thought to grant them
    such musical immortality. It''s a shame.'
