  text: "There is a tribe of people who dwell beyond Those Purple Hills who worship\
    \ a god with paws. It has no other name, or at least not one that is ever spoken\
    \ aloud by the members of the tribe, nor written down, for they do not write as\
    \ we would understand the term. The god with paws apparently forbids any image\
    \ to be made of it, so we have no idea what it looks like. How many paws does\
    \ it have? How tall is it? Does it have just one head, or many? What living creature\
    \ does it resemble, if any? We do not know the answers to any of these questions,\
    \ for the tribespeople are unwilling or unable to answer them. For the same reason,\
    \ it is futile to quiz them about the part played in their culture by the god\
    \ with paws, for they grow mute, or\u2014the chatterboxes among them\u2014change\
    \ the subject, or simply wander away to check their stockpiles of macadamia nuts.\n\
    There has been some conjecture that by worshipping a \u201Cgod with paws\u201D\
    , the tribespeople imply the existence of other gods\u2014the god with hooves,\
    \ perhaps, or the god with flippers\u2014but no hard evidence has come to light.\n\
    The god with paws inhabits a hut on the edge of the tribe's village. No one is\
    \ allowed within a certain distance of it, but at sunset each day, everyone gathers\
    \ in a circle around the hut and stares at it in rapt, if somewhat ill-tempered,\
    \ silence. It is thought that the people are given instructions by the god with\
    \ paws, communicated in some unknown extrasensory manner, but the nature of these\
    \ commands, and whether or not the people take a blind bit of notice of them,\
    \ is unclear.\nI have knitted myself a pair of paw-like mittens and intend to\
    \ impersonate the god of paws, just to see what happens. I will let you know."
