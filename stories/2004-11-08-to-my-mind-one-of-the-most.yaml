  text: "\u201CTo my mind one of the most beautiful words in the English language\
    \ is pavement. Enunciate it, study its sound, and see what you think. It is also\
    \ indubitable that certain combinations of words have a more beautiful sound than\
    \ certain other combinations. Thus Tennyson held that the most beautiful line\
    \ he ever wrote was: The mellow ouzel fluting in the elm. Perhaps, as sound, it\
    \ was. But does it live in the memory as one of the rare great Tennysonian lines?\
    \ It does not.\u201D \u2014 Arnold Bennett, Literary Taste : How To Form It"
