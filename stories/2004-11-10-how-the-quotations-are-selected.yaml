  text: "A number of readers have asked me how I choose the quotations with which\
    \ each Hooting Yard bulletin begins. I wish it was as simple as saying \u201C\
    I browse through books and find a sentence or paragraph that tickles my fancy\u201D\
    , for who among us does not like having their fancy tickled? In truth, the process\
    \ is hideously complicated.\nWhen I developed the initial concept for this website\
    \ towards the end of last year, covering page after page of a big writing tablet\
    \ with notes, diagrams, graphs, squiggles and, it must be said, the occasional\
    \ savage doodle born of fractiousness, it seemed to me that mere whim was an unacceptable\
    \ way of making the selection. After all, the rest of the content adheres to a\
    \ system\u2014albeit a deep system\u2014and so should the quotations. I therefore\
    \ designed an Oulipian constraint to govern my choices. Careful study of the quotations\
    \ will thus reveal that there is a profound logic at work determining which words,\
    \ by which author, are excerpted at any particular point on the calendar.\nSo\
    \ abstruse is the scheme that the launch of Hooting Yard, which ought to have\
    \ taken place in October 2003, was delayed until mid-December. I spent six or\
    \ seven weeks devising the system, having cast aside the original writing tablet\
    \ and obtained a fresh one just to work on what I code-named, like a military\
    \ adventure, Operation Quote-of-the-Day For The Hooting Yard Website, or OQOTDFTHYW\
    \ for short. Without wishing to lay bare the rules by which the system operates,\
    \ I think it is worth pointing out that today, for example, being the tenth of\
    \ November, the title of the book cited includes the word poise, and the extract\
    \ itself consists of four sentences, two of which refer to an apparatus designed\
    \ to deflect rainfall."
