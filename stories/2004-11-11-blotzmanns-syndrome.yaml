  text: "Recently we referred to an outbreak of cases of Blotzmann's Syndrome, and\
    \ certain medically-minded readers have written in to seek further information\
    \ about this modern scourge. (It is a modern scourge, as opposed to a perennial\
    \ scourge, because the first recorded case is from a few months ago, according\
    \ to the medical journals to which I subscribe, albeit that in a paper presented\
    \ to the first conference devoted to Blotzmann's Syndrome\u2014in Helsinki, in\
    \ September\u2014one Doctor Javier Illegible of Samarkand referred to a pandemic\
    \ in the Land of Geese during the fifteenth century which may well have been an\
    \ earlier instance of the condition, although we cannot be sure, and Doctor Illegible's\
    \ documentation has been questioned by both eminent physicians and by a few cantankerous\
    \ autodidacts, chief among the latter the infamous nincompoop Father Ignacio Tweakling,\
    \ priest, potter, topiarist and champion of Fletcherism, the once-popular dietary\
    \ technique involving much chewing, \u201Cmuch chewing\u201D not to be confused\
    \ with the village of that name where Father Tweakling, by uncanny coincidence,\
    \ lived, and this parenthetical sentence has gone on for far too long, so it must\
    \ end now, or soon, though the sooner the better for all our sakes. There.)\n\
    Blotzmann's Syndrome is named after the man who first isolated it in laboratory\
    \ conditions, whose name was Blotzmann. He had never met Father Tweakling, although\
    \ he had encountered the priest's sister on some kind of management training paintball\
    \ exercise in woodland, to which he went on sufferance, after threats from his\
    \ superior, a man whose psychometric tests showed him to be\u2014and I quote from\
    \ the hitherto confidential report\u2014\u201Cflabby, petulant, and fixated upon\
    \ cashew nuts\u201D.\nBlotzmann pelted Father Tweakling's sister with twigs and\
    \ berries, for he refused to carry a paintball gun. At sunset, he sat down and\
    \ swept his hands across the forest floor.\nThe generic term for all that stuff\
    \ found on the ground in forests and woodland is \u201Cduff\u201D.\nSomething\
    \ Blotzmann's fingers brushed lightly against gave him a piercing insight into\
    \ the syndrome which now bears his name. He dashed back to the lab, did a few\
    \ experiments with a bunsen burner and some substances mentioned in the Old Testament,\
    \ and wrote up his findings in a frenzy, pressing the blotting paper to his scrawl\
    \ as dawn broke. Lighting a cheroot, he stepped outside, and encountered a dairy\
    \ person on her way to milk cows.\n\u201CI have just isolated the agency whereby\
    \ folk fall victim to a malady the nature of which has been befogged and blurry\
    \ e'en to the best minds in the field of medicine,\u201D said Blotzmann to the\
    \ rosy-cheeked maiden, at five o clock in the morning. Unfortunately, her brain\
    \ was so thoroughly consumed by an as-yet-unsolved cryptic crossword clue that\
    \ she ignored him, and thus a love that could have conquered everything, a love\
    \ of intense passion that would have been writ down the ages like that of Abelard\
    \ and Heloise or of Tristan and Iseult was doomed never to spark.\nBlotzmann named\
    \ his syndrome. The dairymaid milked her cows. But the two were destined never\
    \ to meet again, on this planet or in any other existence that might await them,\
    \ two lonely stars in a boundless and incomprehensible firmament."
