  text: 'Recently we referred to an outbreak of cases of Blotzmann''s Syndrome, and
    certain medically-minded readers have written in to seek further information about
    this modern scourge. (It is a modern scourge, as opposed to a perennial scourge,
    because the first recorded case is from a few months ago, according to the medical
    journals to which I subscribe, albeit that in a paper presented to the first conference
    devoted to Blotzmann''s Syndrome--in Helsinki, in September--one Doctor Javier
    Illegible of Samarkand referred to a pandemic in the Land of Geese during the
    fifteenth century which may well have been an earlier instance of the condition,
    although we cannot be sure, and Doctor Illegible''s documentation has been questioned
    by both eminent physicians and by a few cantankerous autodidacts, chief among
    the latter the infamous nincompoop Father Ignacio Tweakling, priest, potter, topiarist
    and champion of Fletcherism, the once-popular dietary technique involving much
    chewing, "much chewing" not to be confused with the village of that name where
    Father Tweakling, by uncanny coincidence, lived, and this parenthetical sentence
    has gone on for far too long, so it must end now, or soon, though the sooner the
    better for all our sakes. There.)

    Blotzmann''s Syndrome is named after the man who first isolated it in laboratory
    conditions, whose name was Blotzmann. He had never met Father Tweakling, although
    he had encountered the priest''s sister on some kind of management training paintball
    exercise in woodland, to which he went on sufferance, after threats from his superior,
    a man whose psychometric tests showed him to be--and I quote from the hitherto
    confidential report--"flabby, petulant, and fixated upon cashew nuts".

    Blotzmann pelted Father Tweakling''s sister with twigs and berries, for he refused
    to carry a paintball gun. At sunset, he sat down and swept his hands across the
    forest floor.

    The generic term for all that stuff found on the ground in forests and woodland
    is "duff".

    Something Blotzmann''s fingers brushed lightly against gave him a piercing insight
    into the syndrome which now bears his name. He dashed back to the lab, did a few
    experiments with a bunsen burner and some substances mentioned in the Old Testament,
    and wrote up his findings in a frenzy, pressing the blotting paper to his scrawl
    as dawn broke. Lighting a cheroot, he stepped outside, and encountered a dairy
    person on her way to milk cows.

    "I have just isolated the agency whereby folk fall victim to a malady the nature
    of which has been befogged and blurry e''en to the best minds in the field of
    medicine," said Blotzmann to the rosy-cheeked maiden, at five o clock in the morning.
    Unfortunately, her brain was so thoroughly consumed by an as-yet-unsolved cryptic
    crossword clue that she ignored him, and thus a love that could have conquered
    everything, a love of intense passion that would have been writ down the ages
    like that of Abelard and Heloise or of Tristan and Iseult was doomed never to
    spark.

    Blotzmann named his syndrome. The dairymaid milked her cows. But the two were
    destined never to meet again, on this planet or in any other existence that might
    await them, two lonely stars in a boundless and incomprehensible firmament.'
