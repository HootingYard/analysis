  text: 'Downloading music from the internet is now so popular that the music industry
    has established a chart of (legal) downloads alongside its usual album and single
    charts. What has gone unnoticed is the concurrent staggering growth in downloads
    of John James Audubon''s magnificent Birds Of America paintings. Just as music
    lovers use file-sharing programmes such as Kazaa or WinMX, Audubonistas favour
    a dedicated piece of software called DownloadAudubonBirdsOfAmericaPictureFilesV1.
    04. What is not often realised is that one can access the paintings via any old
    internet connection, for example by visiting A Bird''s Home. To whet the appetites
    of any readers who have not yet become caught up in the craze, here is this week''s
    chart of the top five downloads (last week''s position in brackets).

    1. Little Columbian Owl (4)

    2. The Wood Pewee (2)

    3. Townshend''s Ptilogonys (18)

    4. The Worm-Eating Swamp Warbler (9)

    5. The Cow-pen-bird (1)'
