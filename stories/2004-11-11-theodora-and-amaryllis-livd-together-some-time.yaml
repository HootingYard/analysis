  text: '"Theodora and Amaryllis liv''d together some Time, and at last by the constant
    perusal of airy Books, and a few entertaining Companions, they had in some measure
    forgot their unfortunate Lovers, but they resolv''d never for the future to fix
    their Affections upon any Man living; and living in Luxury, in the prime of their
    Years, in a hot inciting Climate, they at length were naturally inclin''d to the
    most abominable Pollution" -- Giles Jacob, Tractus De Hermaphrodites'
