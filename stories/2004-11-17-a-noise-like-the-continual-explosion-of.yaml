  text: "\u201CA noise like the continual explosion of petards, another like the falling\
    \ of a large animal against his bedroom door, another noise like spirit raps,\
    \ and shrieks were heard by Father H.; no one else then heard them. Father H.\
    \ heard them for eight nights, and not on the ninth. As a priest, he was probably\
    \ a good deal alone, and had to walk over to a cottage behind a belt of wood to\
    \ the eastward, where the retreat of the nuns he attended to was held. According\
    \ to the average experience of Miss Freer's party, he would only have been attacked\
    \ on about two days.\u201D \u2014 John Harris, Inferences From Haunted Houses\
