  text: 'Dear Mr. Key : Your mention of the Jellyfish Players'' adaptation of Brian
    Keenan''s book, An Evil Cradling (10th November), led me to wonder whether the
    erstwhile hostage-turned-celtic-storyteller may be planning a sequel? If you or
    Ms Chew are still in touch with the scribe, you may wish to suggest the following
    titles to him, any of which he may feel free to use for a small fee:

    A Malevolent Day Bed

    A Sinister Pram

    An Unholy Cot

    A Malignant Basinette

    A Wicked Moses Basket

    Yours sincerely, patiently and hopefully, Pansy Cradledew
