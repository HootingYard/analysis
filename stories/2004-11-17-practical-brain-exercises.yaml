  text: 'The Blodgett Global Domination Institute has issued a new pamphlet containing
    a series of practical brain exercises, to encourage--it says here--"enhanced thinking
    patterns for all and sundry". The pamphlet has been given the somewhat twee title
    Put On Your Thinking Cap!, although I doubt that will improve sales. Anyway, here
    are two exclusive tips for Hooting Yard readers to try out:

    1. Place an envelope on a flat surface, such as a table or desktop. If you are
    short of furniture, the floor will do. Now, very carefully, with your fingertips,
    push the envelope gently across the surface.

    2. Obtain a large box. If it has a lid, remove it. Stand in the box or, if it
    is big enough, sit or squat. After a few minutes, clamber out of the box and start
    to think about something.'
