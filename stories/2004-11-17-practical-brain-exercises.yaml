  text: "The Blodgett Global Domination Institute has issued a new pamphlet containing\
    \ a series of practical brain exercises, to encourage\u2014it says here\u2014\u201C\
    enhanced thinking patterns for all and sundry\u201D. The pamphlet has been given\
    \ the somewhat twee title Put On Your Thinking Cap!, although I doubt that will\
    \ improve sales. Anyway, here are two exclusive tips for Hooting Yard readers\
    \ to try out:\n1. Place an envelope on a flat surface, such as a table or desktop.\
    \ If you are short of furniture, the floor will do. Now, very carefully, with\
    \ your fingertips, push the envelope gently across the surface.\n2. Obtain a large\
    \ box. If it has a lid, remove it. Stand in the box or, if it is big enough, sit\
    \ or squat. After a few minutes, clamber out of the box and start to think about\
    \ something."
