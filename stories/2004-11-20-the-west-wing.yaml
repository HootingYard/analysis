  text: 'I had an interesting conversation the other day, with the person sitting
    next to me on a bus as it crawled through east London. We talked of a number of
    things, as you do, and then became embroiled in a discussion about The West Wing.
    Our animated discussion of this topic lasted for about ten minutes, until I had
    to get off the bus, at which point my interlocutor and I realised we had been
    talking at cross-purposes. He had been talking about the television Potus-drama,
    whereas I had in mind Edward Gorey''s book of the same name. It just goes to show
    that fascinating conversations can be had even if neither participant has the
    faintest idea what the other is babbling on about.


    Two different wings, both westerly'
