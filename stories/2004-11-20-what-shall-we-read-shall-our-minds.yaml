  text: '"What shall we read? Shall our minds be the receptacle of every thing that
    an author has a mind to write? Shall there be no distinction between the tree
    of life and the tree of death? Shall we stoop down and drink out of the trough
    which the wickedness of men has filled with pollution and shame? Shall we mire
    in impurity, and chase fantastic will-o''-the-wisps across the swamps, when we
    might walk in the blooming gardens of God? O, no." -- O E Fuller, Brave Men And
    Women'
