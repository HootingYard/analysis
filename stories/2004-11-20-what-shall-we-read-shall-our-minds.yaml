  text: "\u201CWhat shall we read? Shall our minds be the receptacle of every thing\
    \ that an author has a mind to write? Shall there be no distinction between the\
    \ tree of life and the tree of death? Shall we stoop down and drink out of the\
    \ trough which the wickedness of men has filled with pollution and shame? Shall\
    \ we mire in impurity, and chase fantastic will-o'-the-wisps across the swamps,\
    \ when we might walk in the blooming gardens of God? O, no.\u201D \u2014 O E Fuller,\
    \ Brave Men And Women"
