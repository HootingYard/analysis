  text: "\u201CIf we represent the sun by a gourd, twenty inches in diameter, Mercury\
    \ will seem a bilberry, Venus a white currant, the Earth a black currant, Mars\
    \ a red currant, the planetoids as fine seed, Jupiter an orange or peach, Saturn\
    \ a nectarine or greengage, Uranus a red cherry, and Neptune a white cherry. By\
    \ putting the sun and planets in a row, and drawing a contour of the whole, we\
    \ obtain the figure of a dirk, a bodkin, or an Indian club.\u201D \u2014 John\
