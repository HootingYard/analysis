  text: "\nToday being the forty-first anniversary of the assassination of Potus John\
    \ Fitzgerald Kennedy, it is appropriate to pose some of the questions about that\
    \ day in Dallas which remain unanswered. Perhaps they are unanswerable.\nDid the\
    \ citizens of Dallas refer to the grassy knoll as \u201Cthe grassy knoll\u201D\
    \ before it became known as The Grassy Knoll, or did they call it \u201Ca grassy\
    \ knoll\u201D or \u201Cthat grassy knoll\u201D, or even \u201Cthat patch of grass\
    \ over there in Dealey Plaza\u201D? Similarly, was the white picket fence known\
    \ as \u201Cthat white picket fence\u201D or just \u201Cthat fence\u201D?\nDid\
    \ his family, friends and acquaintances address Umbrella Man as \u201Cumbrella\
    \ man\u201D prior to 22nd November 1963? The same question can be asked of Badge\
    \ Man, and indeed of Marymoon Man, or, as some commentators on the assassination\
    \ have it, Mary Moonman, or Moorman.\nWe know that future Potus Richard Milhous\
    \ Nixon flew out of Dallas, suspiciously, on the morning of the assassination.\
    \ Was he accompanied by his dog Checkers, or had Checkers already passed to The\
    \ Other Side by then?\nElderly dressmaker Abraham Zapruder famously shot the Zapruder\
    \ Footage on that sunny November day in Dallas. Who decided to dub it \u201CThe\
    \ Zapruder Footage\u201D as opposed to, say, \u201CThe Zapruder Film\u201D or\
    \ \u201CZapruder's cinefilm\u201D?\nThe cinema in which Lee Harvey Oswald was\
    \ apprehended was showing the film War Is Hell starring Van Heflin at the time.\
    \ Was Mr Heflin part of the conspiracy, if indeed there was a conspiracy?\n\n\
    Brain guru Tony Buzan : was he in the Texas Schoolbook Depository?\nA question\
    \ with wider implications relates to the practice of assassin nomenclature. When\
    \ was it decided, and by whom, that the assassins of Potuses (or Potae) should\
    \ invariably be given their full three names, as in Lee Harvey Oswald and John\
    \ Wilkes Booth? Why is this also accorded to the assassins of whining Liverpudlian\
    \ pop singers (Mark David Chapman) but not to unsuccessful Potus assassins (John\
    \ Hinckley) unless they are members of the Manson cult (Lynette \u201CSqueaky\u201D\
    \ Fromme)? And is Sirhan Sirhan's middle name also Sirhan?"
