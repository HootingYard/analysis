  text: '"When I was desirous to delight my mind (animus) according to my idea of
    heavenly blessedness, a sudden stupor, occasioned by the light of heaven, which
    is as white as snow, and whose essence is said to be wisdom, seized my mind (mens)

    from the heat of heaven, which corresponds with the brightness of its light, and
    whose essence is said to be love, there arose in my heart a violent palpitation,
    a general uneasiness seized my whole frame, and I was inwardly excruciated to
    such a degree that I threw myself flat on the ground." -- Emanuel Swedenborg,
    The Delights Of Wisdom Pertaining To Conjugal Love'
