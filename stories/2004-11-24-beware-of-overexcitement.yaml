  text: 'The nights are drawing in and soon winter will be upon us. Remember the long-ago
    days when people made their own entertainment? Ho what fun was to be had! Here
    are two completely genuine items from Frederica Seeger''s Entertainments For Home,
    Church & School (1910). Still thy beating heart!

    BUTTON, BUTTON The players sit around the room in a circle. The leader then holds
    a button between his hands, with the palms pressed together, so as to hide it.
    He goes around the circle, passing his hand between those of the players. As he
    does this, he says: "Hold fast to what I give you." He is careful not to let the
    players see into whose hands he passed the button. The circuit having been made,
    the leader says to the first player: "Button, button, who has the button?" The
    one questioned must answer, naming some one whom he thinks has it. So it continues
    until all have had a turn at answering the same question. Then the leader says:
    "Button, button, rise!" The button holder must do this.


    Some buttons

    PROGRESSIVE PUZZLES Provide as many small, square cards as there are guests; also
    several pairs of scissors. The party seats itself in a circle. The cards and scissors
    are given out. Then each player cuts his card twice across, so as to make four
    pieces. The straight cuts must intersect each other. After the first cut, the
    pieces must be held together until the second cut has been made. A player mixes
    his pieces and passes them to his right-hand neighbor. When the leader gives the
    signal, all the players put together the four pieces they have. The one who first
    succeeds calls out "ready." Then all stop and pass the cards on again. The successful
    player is given a mark on a tally card. The game goes on until a half hour has
    passed. The person receiving the most marks is entitled to a prize, or may become
    the leader, as preferred.'
