  text: '"We should have a living man putting his arms about a lifeless partner of
    wood, and whirling round and round with her, or rather it. Could you look at such
    a sight, for an instant, without horror? At all events, all mechanical music seems
    monstrous and abominable to me." -- E T A Hoffmann, Automata'
