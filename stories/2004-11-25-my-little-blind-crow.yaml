  text: "So there I was, kneading dough, thinking about Edgar Allan Poe, and my heart\
    \ fit to burst about my little blind crow. The moon was full and it cast a glow.\
    \ Santa in the chimney said \u201CHo ho ho\u201D. I wept hot tears for my little\
    \ blind crow. The wind doth howl, the gale doth blow. They used to call Stalin\
    \ \u201CUncle Joe\u201D, but Stalin never sobbed all night for my little blind\
    \ crow. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. Brother, can you spare a dime? Sister,\
    \ are you too crumpled with woe when you think about my little blind crow? They\
    \ say that Stalin's five-year plans made Russia strong. But that has nothing to\
    \ do with my song. I want it set to music by Status Quo. A sad, sad song for my\
    \ little blind crow."
