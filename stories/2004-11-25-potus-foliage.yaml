  text: "Plant-fanciers probably know that there is a variety of orchid named after\
    \ ex-Potus Richard Milhous Nixon. Actually, it is called the \u201CRichard Nixon\u201D\
    \ orchid, omitting that terrific middle name, which is cause for regret. Despite\
    \ untold hours of searching on the internet I have been unable to find a picture\
    \ of what I have no doubt is a magnificent piece of foliage, so here are some\
    \ other orchids, not one of which is called \u201CWatergate\u201D, \u201CH R Haldeman\u201D\
    , \u201CSix Crises\u201D or \u201CG Gordon Liddy\u201D, let alone \u201CRichard\
    \ Nixon\u201D, more's the pity.\n"
