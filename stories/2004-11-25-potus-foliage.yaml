  text: 'Plant-fanciers probably know that there is a variety of orchid named after
    ex-Potus Richard Milhous Nixon. Actually, it is called the "Richard Nixon" orchid,
    omitting that terrific middle name, which is cause for regret. Despite untold
    hours of searching on the internet I have been unable to find a picture of what
    I have no doubt is a magnificent piece of foliage, so here are some other orchids,
    not one of which is called "Watergate", "H R Haldeman", "Six Crises" or "G Gordon
    Liddy", let alone "Richard Nixon", more''s the pity.
