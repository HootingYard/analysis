  text: "Tiny Enid knew all there was to know about the capture of ostriches. As we\
    \ sat together gulping down tumblers of lukewarm tap water, she gave me some tips.\n\
    \u201CHere are some precautions,\u201D she said, \u201CAvoid excessive exertion\
    \ and rough handling during capture, otherwise sudden death or permanent collapse\
    \ will occur as a result of muscle damage. Ostriches that go down as a result\
    \ of capture stress usually die of secondary problems such as pneumonia or renal\
    \ failure. It is imperative that stress factors be minimized. Capture only at\
    \ low ambient temperature (around 28\xB0C), prevent overexertion, and minimize\
    \ handling of the captured birds.\n\u201CWhen attempting to capture ostriches\
    \ in camps or in small enclosures, be very careful not to herd the ostriches into\
    \ the fence. The fence can be used as a guide to steer the bird into a capture\
    \ boma, but not as a net. Broken legs and lacerations are the usual outcome of\
    \ a poorly planned capture operation. Ensure that iron standards and fallen trees\
    \ are not in the path of the running birds.\n\u201COnce an ostrich is caught,\
    \ always be aware that the powerful legs are effectively used for defence. The\
    \ bird will try to disembowel or at least maim its captors. Stay away from the\
    \ front of the bird unless you have control of the head with the neck held at\
    \ full extension and lower than the bird's back.\u201D\n\u201CThose are very useful\
    \ hints, Tiny Enid,\u201D I said, and I was grateful to have heard them, for who\
    \ knew when I might be sent out to capture an ostrich?\n\u201CI haven't finished,\
    \ Lancelot,\u201D she said. My name is not Lancelot, but Tiny Enid had for many\
    \ years had a fixation upon the actor Lance Percival, and the symptoms of her\
    \ mania cropped up in unexpected ways. I made a snap decision not to contradict\
    \ her, for she had been known to throw fits and dribble when confused, and I hated\
    \ having to mop up anybody's dribble, let alone Tiny Enid's. \u201CGo on,\u201D\
    \ I said.\n\u201CFor mass capture of ostriches in a large camp or in the wild,\u201D\
    \ she continued, \u201Cthe use of the plastic capture boma is very successful.\
    \ Young ostriches up to two years of age are often found in large groups called\
    \ creches: these creche units can number up to sixty birds. Due to their strong\
    \ herding instinct these units can easily be manipulated and chased into a capture\
    \ boma using a helicopter.\n\u201COnce the ostriches are in the boma they should\
    \ be allowed to rest for at least an hour before they are loaded. Excited and\
    \ hot birds tend to panic when loaded immediately into mass crates and will pile\
    \ on top of each other and trample each other. The use of a shield to force the\
    \ birds gently forward and up the ramp will minimize injury to the birds and the\
    \ handlers. Large, aggressive males can sometimes be problematic. These should\
    \ be placed on their own in separate crates.\u201D\n\u201CThat sounds like a very\
    \ good idea, Tiny Enid,\u201D I said, as she paused for a sip of her water. Across\
    \ the fields, we could see wild hogs careering madly into the swamp, and the faint\
    \ silhouette of a watercolourist sat at their easel, attempting to capture the\
    \ scene.\n\u201CWhen time is not a factor,\u201D said Tiny Enid, \u201Ca pop-up\
    \ corral set up around a watering point or a small patch of lucerne with supplemental\
    \ feeding is a useful method for the capture of ostriches. The birds are allowed\
    \ to enter the capture corral on their own, and stress levels are kept to a minimum\
    \ as no chasing of the birds occurs.\u201D\nShe paused again, took a cigarillo\
    \ from her pocket, and asked me if I had any matches. I fumbled for my little\
    \ box, but it was damp.\n\u201CI'm afraid my matches are damp, Tiny Enid,\u201D\
    \ I said.\n\u201CIf you blow on them, they will eventually become dry, Lancelot,\u201D\
    \ she advised. \u201CWhile you do so, here are some final points. Never capture\
    \ ostriches at high ambient temperatures. Do not handle ostriches roughly during\
    \ capture. Do not chase the birds excessively during the capture procedure. Never\
    \ use a net gun to capture ostriches. Never chase ostriches into a fence to capture\
    \ them. Are your matches dry yet?\u201D\n\u201CNo, they are not,\u201D I panted.\n\
    \u201CIn that case,\u201D said Tiny Enid, replacing the cigarillo in her pocket,\
    \ \u201CI suppose I shall have to visit the newsagents.\u201D And she sipped the\
    \ last of her water, rose from her chair, kissed me lightly on the forehead, and\
    \ walked away.\nYears later, in a secondhand shop, I found a watercolour painting\
    \ of wild hogs in a swamp done in pinks and greens and pale yellows, and I bought\
    \ it, because I wondered if it was the painting made on that golden afternoon\
    \ when I sat with Tiny Enid for the very last time."
