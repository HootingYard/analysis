  text: Hooting Yard reaches its first birthday and celebrates with tales of wild
    pigs, vampire bats and days of imbecilic glee, as well as looking at the crucial
    importance of topiary, the legend of the Grunty Man, the Swiss Family Robinson,
    and, of course, what happened when Bjorn and Benny and Anni-Frid and Agnetha were
    invited to Belshazzar's feast... Gosh!
