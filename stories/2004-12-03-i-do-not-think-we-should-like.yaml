  text: '"I do not think we should like to dine with a Chinese gentleman, or Mandarin,
    as he would treat us to strange dainties, as a roast dog, a dish of stewed worms,
    a rat pie; or, perhaps, a bird''s-nest. But the bird''s-nest would be the best
    of the list, for it is not like the kind of bird''s-nests which you have seen,
    but is made, I believe, of the spawn of fish, and looks something like isinglass.
    It is the nest of a sort of swallow, is about the size of a goose''s egg, and
    is found in caverns along the sea shores; so it is not so bad as it seems at first."

    Exhibition of 1851; Describing the Beautiful Inventions and Manufactures Exhibited
    Therein; with Pretty Stories about the People Who Have Made and Sent Them; and
    How They Live When at Home'
