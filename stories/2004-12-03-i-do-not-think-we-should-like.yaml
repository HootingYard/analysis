  text: "\u201CI do not think we should like to dine with a Chinese gentleman, or\
    \ Mandarin, as he would treat us to strange dainties, as a roast dog, a dish of\
    \ stewed worms, a rat pie; or, perhaps, a bird's-nest. But the bird's-nest would\
    \ be the best of the list, for it is not like the kind of bird's-nests which you\
    \ have seen, but is made, I believe, of the spawn of fish, and looks something\
    \ like isinglass. It is the nest of a sort of swallow, is about the size of a\
    \ goose's egg, and is found in caverns along the sea shores; so it is not so bad\
    \ as it seems at first.\u201D \u2014 Anonymous, The World's Fair : Or, Children's\
    \ Prize Gift Book of the Great Exhibition of 1851; Describing the Beautiful Inventions\
    \ and Manufactures Exhibited Therein; with Pretty Stories about the People Who\
    \ Have Made and Sent Them; and How They Live When at Home"
