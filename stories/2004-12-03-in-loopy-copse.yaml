  text: 'In Loopy Copse, when I was young, all golden were the shrubs and trees. All
    golden I remember them, and Bonkers Maisie from the farm. Maisie was unkempt and
    mad, just like her brother and her dad. Her sister left them long ago. She went
    to join a music hall. She made it as a chorus girl and then she graced the silent
    screen. She looked like Edna Purviance and had a hat named after her. But Bonkers
    Maisie never did, for she was always dressed in rags.

    The golden trees of Loopy Copse in those blue summers long ago, oh I remember
    them with woe as I sit here twirling my moustache. My woe is such that I may sob
    and mop my tears with my jacket cuff. But both my cuffs are smeared with grease,
    I dipped them in the soup tureen. I don''t know why, I don''t know when, I don''t
    know who knocks at my door. This bombed hotel has stale air. The other guests
    are rakes and fops. I''m sitting in my rocking chair recalling the gold of Loopy
    Copse.'
