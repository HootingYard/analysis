  text: "\u201CAfter the heavy rain of a thunderstorm has washed the soil, it sometimes\
    \ happens that a child, or a rustic, finds a wedge-shaped piece of metal or a\
    \ few triangular flints in a field or near a road. There was no such piece of\
    \ metal, there were no such flints, lying there yesterday, and the finder is puzzled\
    \ about the origin of the objects on which he has lighted. He carries them home,\
    \ and the village wisdom determines that the wedge-shaped piece of metal is a\
    \ thunderbolt, or that the bits of flint are elf-shots, the heads of fairy arrows.\u201D\
