  text: '"After the heavy rain of a thunderstorm has washed the soil, it sometimes
    happens that a child, or a rustic, finds a wedge-shaped piece of metal or a few
    triangular flints in a field or near a road. There was no such piece of metal,
    there were no such flints, lying there yesterday, and the finder is puzzled about
    the origin of the objects on which he has lighted. He carries them home, and the
    village wisdom determines that the wedge-shaped piece of metal is a thunderbolt,
    or that the bits of flint are elf-shots, the heads of fairy arrows." -- Andrew
    Lang, Custom And Myth'
