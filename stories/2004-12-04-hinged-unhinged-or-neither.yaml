  text: 'The quandary that beset Dennis, apart from his conviction that in a previous
    life he was Veronica Lake, was whether he was hinged or unhinged, or possibly
    neither. Most of us would not fret about such a thing, but Dennis did. There is
    a temptation to say that this fact in itself proves that Dennis was indeed unhinged,
    and to ponder why this had not occurred to him. But it had, and it added to his
    fretfulness. For there was so much about Dennis that was hinged. For example,
    when he chanced upon poisonous toads, he scampered out of their way, rather than
    picking them up and taking them home, as an unhinged person might.

    Dennis was adept at self-preservation in a very hinged way. When he plunged out
    of an aircraft at high altitude, without a parachute, he made sure that he lit
    upon an air current that allowed him to drift easily onto a bank of fresh-fallen
    snow, thus cushioning his landing and meaning that he only spent six weeks in
    hospital instead of being coffined up and buried in that Baltimore churchyard
    where lie the remains of Edgar Allan Poe.

    Dennis had given much thought to the idea that he might be neither hinged nor
    unhinged, not in the sense that he fell somewhere in between, but that hingedness
    or its opposite was foreign to him, as an igloo to a Maori, or a biro to a caveman.
    Dennis remembered, in addition to being Veronica Lake, being a caveman. The gulf
    of thousands of years between these lives was a blank, however, and Dennis wondered
    if he had spent all that time in some kind of limbo. If he had, where was that
    limbo, and had he been hinged or unhinged, or neither, while trapped in it? This
    seemed to Dennis so monumental a question that he could find no rest.

    Dennis needs your help. In particular, he needs your shoes. All of them. If Dennis''
    story has tugged at your heart-strings, please, please parcel up all your footwear
    and send the package to Dennis, c/o The Veronica Lake Building, Winnipeg. Thank
    you.'
