  text: "Have you ever met someone from Switzerland named Robinson? Someone named\
    \ Robinson, from Switzerland, who has been shipwrecked? I have. I was sitting\
    \ in a coffee bar in Old Grimy Town up north, and as I sipped my cocoa and leafed\
    \ through yesterday's copy of The Old Grimy Town Gazette, in walked Fathead Robinson\
    \ and Poopy Robinson and their children Ned, Gristle and Sawdust. They sat at\
    \ my table.\n\u201CWe are the Swiss Family Robinson,\u201D said Fathead. \u201C\
    We are from Switzerland, and we were shipwrecked.\u201D\nI looked at them one\
    \ by one, trying to see evidence of their ordeal.\n\u201CWhen was this?\u201D\
    \ I asked.\n\u201CYears ago,\u201D said Poopy, \u201CWe were rescued by a big\
    \ boat of birds.\u201D\n\u201CA boat of birds?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CYes,\u201D\
    \ said Ned, \u201CIt was a big boat and there were no humans aboard it, only birds.\
    \ Starlings and chaffinches and buntings and wagtails and corncrakes and linnets\
    \ and sparrows and swans.\u201D\n\u201CWas a swan the captain?\u201D I asked.\n\
    \u201CYes,\u201D said Ned, \u201CHow did you guess?\u201D\nI fixed him with my\
    \ one working eye, sipped the dregs of my cocoa, and stood up. Saying nothing,\
    \ I swept out of the coffee bar, and went straight home to write in my diary.\
    \ Today I met the Swiss Family Robinson, I wrote, and then I put down my pencil\
    \ and became lachrymose, thinking about swans imperilled on the high seas, and\
    \ my parrot, Lascelles, who yearned for Colombia, where he was born, on a bright\
    \ summer day so many years ago."
