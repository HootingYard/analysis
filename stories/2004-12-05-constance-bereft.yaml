  text: 'The pigs needed feeding, so Constance took a big crate full of apples and
    trudged out in the morning drizzle. The apples were pippins, and mostly rotten,
    but she knew that the pigs would guzzle them down. Over by the aircraft hangar
    a flop-eared bunny rabbit was hopping about among a pile of abandoned pots and
    pans. Constance worried about rust, but not today. She tipped the apples into
    the pigsty, put the empty crate onto a pile of other empty crates, and headed
    off towards the orchard as dawn was breaking. Constance had an assignation in
    the orchard.

    The following day, before her assignation, Constance not only fed the pigs with
    a crate full of overripe plums, but she gathered up all the pots and pans strewn
    around the door of the aircraft hangar and derusted them with a derusting solution
    of her own devising. The flop-eared bunny rabbit was nowhere to be seen, but she
    saw an Arctic hare on the horizon. Then she trotted off excitedly to the orchard.


    This is what an Arctic hare looks like

    On the Thursday, she was late getting to the orchard for her assignation, because
    one of the pigs had contracted a lethal pig disease, and she ran across the muddy
    fields to call the local veterinary surgeon, a mutton-chopped old fool with watery
    eyes. He was still abed, and Constance knocked and knocked on his door to rouse
    him. When he eventually came down in his dressing gown, not quite awake, and unlatched
    his door, the following dialogue took place:

    Constance : Vet, vet, I have a sick pig!

    Veterinary Surgeon : Let me get dressed and put all the necessaries in my bag
    and I will come with you.

    Constance : Hurry, hurry, vet! The pig may die!

    Veterinary Surgeon : I will do my utmost to save your pig.

    Because Constance had run across the fields to call the veterinary surgeon, she
    was late for her assignation in the orchard. When she got there, at last, she
    found a note fastened to a withered old pugton tree. She read only half of it
    before hot tears welled up and she fled from the orchard sobbing and bereft.

    Back at the pigsty, the watery-eyed veterinary surgeon was packing up his bag.
    Constance blundered through the gate, fraught and weeping and wild-eyed.

    Veterinary Surgeon : I have cured the pig, Miss Constance. All will be well.

    Constance, Bereft : The Motion Picture is currently in production, starring Cher
    as Constance and Kevin Costner as the veterinary surgeon.'
