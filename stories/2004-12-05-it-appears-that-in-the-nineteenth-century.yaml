  text: "\u201CIt appears that in the nineteenth century only one airship was constructed\
    \ in this country, which proved to be capable of ascending into the air and being\
    \ propelled by its own machinery. This airship made its appearance in the year\
    \ 1848, and was built to the designs of a man named Partridge. Very little information\
    \ is available concerning this ship. The envelope was cylindrical in shape, tapering\
    \ at each end, and was composed of a light rigid framework covered with fabric.\
    \ The envelope itself was covered with a light wire net, from which the car was\
    \ suspended. The envelope contained a single ballonet for regulating the pressure\
    \ of the gas.\u201D \u2014 George Whale, British Airships, Past / Present / Future"
