  text: Old doddery Martin trudged through the park. His hat was askew of course.
    He blanched when he saw the vinegar man who came all the way from the outskirts
    of Minsk. Why was a Minsk-man here in the park? A man who was jabbering at a crow
    in a tree? Doddery Martin mussed his hair. He went to feed the park's polar bear.
    He fed it with biscuits and nuts. I said, he fed it with biscuits and nuts. Back
    in Vietnam, old doddery Martin had gutted huts. He'd been a keen marine in his
    time. Now he forged banknotes in a basement by the Seine, in Paris, in Paris,
    in the capital of France, where his banknotes were passed from hand to hand by
    evil men, banknotes made by doddery Martin, home at last from Vietnam.
