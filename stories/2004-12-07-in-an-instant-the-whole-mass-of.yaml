  text: '"In an instant, the whole mass of ice, extending for several miles from the
    coast, and as far as the eye could reach, burst, and was overwhelmed by the rolling
    waves. The sight was tremendous and awfully grand; the large fields of ice raising
    themselves out of the water, striking against each other, and plunging into the
    deep, with a violence not to be described, and a noise like the discharge of innumerable
    batteries of heavy guns. The darkness of the night; the roaring of the wind and
    the sea, and the dashing of the waves and ice against the rocks, filled the travellers
