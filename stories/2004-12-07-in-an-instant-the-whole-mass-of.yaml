  text: "\u201CIn an instant, the whole mass of ice, extending for several miles from\
    \ the coast, and as far as the eye could reach, burst, and was overwhelmed by\
    \ the rolling waves. The sight was tremendous and awfully grand; the large fields\
    \ of ice raising themselves out of the water, striking against each other, and\
    \ plunging into the deep, with a violence not to be described, and a noise like\
    \ the discharge of innumerable batteries of heavy guns. The darkness of the night;\
    \ the roaring of the wind and the sea, and the dashing of the waves and ice against\
    \ the rocks, filled the travellers with sensations of awe and horror, so as almost\
    \ to deprive them of the power of utterance.\u201D \u2014 Anonymous, Dangers On\
    \ The Ice Off The Coast Of Labrador, With Some Interesting Particulars Respecting\
    \ the Natives of that Country, Printed for the Religious Tract Society, London"
