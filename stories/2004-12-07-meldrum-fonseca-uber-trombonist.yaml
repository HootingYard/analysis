  text: "Eschewing the nose-flute, Meldrum Fonseca first took up the trombone at the\
    \ age of seventy. Before this, his entire musical experience was limited to singing\
    \ in the bath\u2014or possibly singing in Bath, it is not quite clear. Having\
    \ spent the best part of his life as a plinth magnate, Meldrum was a rich man.\
    \ From Aleppo to Zug, few cities or towns exist without at least one plinth from\
    \ the Fonseca Plinth Factory or one of its many franchised workshops dotted haphazardly\
    \ around the globe.\nThe conversation on that autumn day, under an overcast sky,\
    \ went something like this. Meldrum's paramour, Mrs Fonseca, asked him why he\
    \ had never learned to play the trombone. This was a common verbal sally of hers,\
    \ keeping Meldrum alert by firing questions at him which he had never been asked\
    \ before. On the same day, for example, she asked him if he knew the slightest\
    \ thing about the skeletal structure of badgers, and whether he could recommend\
    \ a particular recording of a 19th century railway timetable being read aloud\
    \ from cover to cover.\nDue to Mrs Fonseca's constant mental prodding, Meldrum's\
    \ brain was a superb mechanism, thoroughly exercised, almost like a champion greyhound.\
    \ Although often his answers to these constant questions might simply be \u201C\
    yes\u201D or \u201Cno\u201D, his response to the trombone enquiry was \u201CWell\
    \ stap my chives, Marjorie-Suzanna, that's a bloody good idea! I'm going to go\
    \ out this very minute and buy myself a trombone!\u201D\nAnd he did. He engaged\
    \ a tutor on the same day, an unnerving milksop called Reynolds. Reynolds taught\
    \ him daily for the next year, at which point Meldrum had become so adept that\
    \ the tutor threw his hands in the air and said, in his weedy little voice, \u201C\
    Mr Fonseca, I can teach you no more! Your skills have outstripped my own!\u201D\
    \nFrom that day on, Meldrum spent most of his time standing next to a hedge by\
    \ the ring road, playing his trombone and gladdening the hearts of all who passed\
    \ him by.\nSource : Little Stories Of Charming People To Warm The Cockles Of Your\
