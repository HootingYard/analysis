  text: 'Eschewing the nose-flute, Meldrum Fonseca first took up the trombone at the
    age of seventy. Before this, his entire musical experience was limited to singing
    in the bath--or possibly singing in Bath, it is not quite clear. Having spent
    the best part of his life as a plinth magnate, Meldrum was a rich man. From Aleppo
    to Zug, few cities or towns exist without at least one plinth from the Fonseca
    Plinth Factory or one of its many franchised workshops dotted haphazardly around
    the globe.

    The conversation on that autumn day, under an overcast sky, went something like
    this. Meldrum''s paramour, Mrs Fonseca, asked him why he had never learned to
    play the trombone. This was a common verbal sally of hers, keeping Meldrum alert
    by firing questions at him which he had never been asked before. On the same day,
    for example, she asked him if he knew the slightest thing about the skeletal structure
    of badgers, and whether he could recommend a particular recording of a 19th century
    railway timetable being read aloud from cover to cover.

    Due to Mrs Fonseca''s constant mental prodding, Meldrum''s brain was a superb
    mechanism, thoroughly exercised, almost like a champion greyhound. Although often
    his answers to these constant questions might simply be "yes" or "no", his response
    to the trombone enquiry was "Well stap my chives, Marjorie-Suzanna, that''s a
    bloody good idea! I''m going to go out this very minute and buy myself a trombone!"

    And he did. He engaged a tutor on the same day, an unnerving milksop called Reynolds.
    Reynolds taught him daily for the next year, at which point Meldrum had become
    so adept that the tutor threw his hands in the air and said, in his weedy little
    voice, "Mr Fonseca, I can teach you no more! Your skills have outstripped my own!"

    From that day on, Meldrum spent most of his time standing next to a hedge by the
    ring road, playing his trombone and gladdening the hearts of all who passed him
    by.
