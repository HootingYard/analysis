  text: "It was a sweltering day. I was strolling along the lane that runs from Pointy\
    \ Town to Coctlosh when I chanced upon a Jesuit priest sitting on a bench. I tipped\
    \ my hat and greeted him.\n\u201CHello,\u201D I said, \u201CWhat a sweltering\
    \ day it is.\u201D\n\u201CFelix Randal the farrier o is he dead then?\u201D said\
    \ the priest, and I realised that I was talking to Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n\u201C\
    Father Hopkins!\u201D I cried, perhaps a tad overenthusiastically, for he frowned\
    \ at me and said: \u201CMy duty all ended, who have watched his mould of man,\
    \ big-boned and hardy-handsome, pining\u2014\u201D\n\u201CWould you like a bite\
    \ of my medlar?\u201D I interrupted, and as I did so a dapple-dawn-drawn falcon\
    \ flew past, narrowly missing my head.\n\u201CPining,\u201D continued Hopkins,\
    \ without taking a blind bit of notice of my fruit-sharing initiative, \u201C\
    till time when reason rambled in it and some fatal four disorders, fleshed there,\
    \ all contended?\u201D\nSwallowing a chunk of medlar, I wondered about these four\
    \ disorders.\n\u201CImpetigo, ague, the bloody flux and Blotzmann's syndrome?\u201D\
    \ I asked.\nFather Hopkins was now fretting with his rosary beads.\n\u201CSickness\
    \ broke him,\u201D he said. I was beginning to wonder why the priest was chuntering\
    \ on about a dead farrier, but I decided to sit down on the bench. He didn't flinch.\
    \ He kept talking, but I was no longer listening. I had become transfixed by the\
    \ sight of a flock of weird unholy birds circling above us. They were black and\
    \ purple and huge, with savage talons and a wingspan of monstrous proportions.\
    \ Could they be the legendary Birds of Bog I had read about in my little primer\
    \ when I was an infant at Sunday School?\nSuddenly Father Hopkins tapped me on\
    \ the shoulder.\n\u201CHow far from then forethought of,\u201D he was shouting,\
    \ \u201Call thy more boisterous years, when thou at the random grim forge, powerful\
    \ amidst peers, didst fettle for the great grey drayhorse his bright and battering\
    \ sandal!\u201D\nThe last few words were yelled so loudly that my hat nearly fell\
    \ off my head. But it seemed as if the priest had finished jabbering at last.\
    \ I felt a sudden urge to kiss his hand, as if he were a bishop, but I decided\
    \ not to. Instead, I thrust my last medlar at him.\n\u201CTake it, take it, Father\
    \ Hopkins,\u201D I said, and I got up and walked away. All in all, it was quite\
    \ an interesting morning.\n\nFather Hopkins, S.J."
