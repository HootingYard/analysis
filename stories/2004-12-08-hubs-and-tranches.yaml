  text: "I wrote some months ago that where I live\u2014when I am not on duty in the\
    \ Haemoglobin Towers annexe, of course\u2014has been designated as a hub. I am\
    \ not entirely sure who has so designated it, although doubtless it was some \u201C\
    New\u201D Labour apparatchik. In fact it would be more correct to dub it a forthcoming\
    \ hub, or a hub-to-be, for of course its hubdom is not yet complete. I do not\
    \ know how many tranches are involved in the area's transformation from whatever\
    \ it is now to being a true hub, and this bothers me.\nI want to know about the\
    \ tranches, pretty desperately. Something cannot become a hub in Blair's brave\
    \ new land without each successive tranche being signed off, or so I gather.\n\
    In fact I want some tranches of my own. Hooting Yard deserves, I think, to go\
    \ from one tranche to another. So let this be the First Tranche, I declare.\n\
    It also strikes me that Hubs And Tranches sounds like an album title, perhaps\
    \ one made by a fey singer-songwriter. If, dear reader, you are that fey singer-songwriter,\
    \ you are welcome to use it."
