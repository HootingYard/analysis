  text: 'Researchers claim to have found a picture of one of Dobson''s out-of-print
    pamphlets. One of the researchers is tall and Hungarian. The other is lantern-jawed
    and recently suffered from gastroenteritis. They have only been working together
    for a short time, and have never met face-to-face, communicating via a virtually
    redundant communications system involving pneumatics, magnets and steam.


    I have to say that this picture looks more like a book than a pamphlet, in which
    case it may be the unimaginably rare Stairway To Heaven, one of Dobson''s most
    puzzling works. The picture is too small to decipher the text, so we can only
    suppose.

    Stairway To Heaven was written in the first flush of Dobson''s youth, the manuscript
    scribbled in a clutch of exercise books the pamphleteer-to-be stole from an enormous
    locomotive stuck in a railway siding. The guards had apparently gone off to paddle
    in a pond and hunt wild boar while they waited for spare parts.

    The book is subtitled Some Conjectures On The Possible Location Of An Actual Staircase
    That Leads To The Celestial Sphere, and is a remarkably assured text for one so
    young. It begins thus:

    As I wander through the wilderness of this world, I often fall to wondering how
    I will get to heaven. I know it is there somewhere, for that is what my mama and
    papa have told me ever since I was a tot. I know, too, that every single thing
    they have ever told me is true, because they vowed it was so. They made these
    vows to me on my sixth birthday, as papa cut my cake and shortly after mama clambered
    in through the window after chasing away a robber with her high velocity sniper''s
    rifle. She came through the window of the kitchen because at that time the door
    to the cottage was sealed shut against fiends and demons, known to prey upon good
    folk in the countryside where I grew. Papa used quick-drying cement for the job,
    completing the work in just an hour on the one day that winter when there was
    no rain or snow, for we lived in a valley. If there is ever a second edition of
    this book I will check a meteorological reference work to check the accuracy of
    that statement.

    There never was a second edition, of course, a fact that sometimes finds me lying
    awake all night, sobbing into my blankets, big blankets from Finland, where it
    is important to keep warm and snug through the long, long winter night.'
