  text: '"She opened the cage and the bird darted into the free air which was the
    only environment it understood. As it circled the room, its wings brushed the
    far wall. It shivered an instant, hung suspended as if supported by some unseen
    hand, and died as it fell to the floor. Neither the bird nor Tarmo had knowledge
    of the concealed, highly charged panels which recorded, both fluoroscopically
    and photographically, the images of all those who entered World Center. The image
    of the bird had appeared on the fluorescent screen. The photographic circuit had
    been made. And the technicians would curse a burned out circuit." -- Anna Hunger
