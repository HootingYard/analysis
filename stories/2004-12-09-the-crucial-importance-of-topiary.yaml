  text: 'Hooting Yard''s roving reporter Velma Nebraska writes to inform me that early
    in the twentieth century, there was a topiarist active in England named, delightfully,
    William Cutbush. He is mentioned in the splendid Topiary In The United Kingdom
    site created by Anthony Blagg, who--quote--"lives in Worcestershire with his wife,
    shears and family of ever growing topiary".

    Incidentally, a Google search for "famous topiarists" yielded a startling result--absolutely
    nil. What is the world coming to?


    Some topiary--although not the splendid Mr Blagg''s work, as far as I know'
