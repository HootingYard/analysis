  text: "Hooting Yard's roving reporter Velma Nebraska writes to inform me that early\
    \ in the twentieth century, there was a topiarist active in England named, delightfully,\
    \ William Cutbush. He is mentioned in the splendid Topiary In The United Kingdom\
    \ site created by Anthony Blagg, who\u2014quote\u2014\u201Clives in Worcestershire\
    \ with his wife, shears and family of ever growing topiary\u201D.\nIncidentally,\
    \ a Google search for \u201Cfamous topiarists\u201D yielded a startling result\u2014\
    absolutely nil. What is the world coming to?\n\nSome topiary\u2014although not\
    \ the splendid Mr Blagg's work, as far as I know"
