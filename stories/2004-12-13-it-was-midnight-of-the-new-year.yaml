  text: "\u201CIt was midnight of the new year, and an aged man stood thoughtfully\
    \ at the window. He gazed with a long, despairing look, upon the fixed, eternal,\
    \ and glorious heaven, and down upon the silent, still, and snow-white earth,\
    \ whereon was none so joyless, so sleepless as he. For his grave stood open near\
    \ him; it was covered only with the snows of age, not decked with the green of\
    \ youth; and he brought with him, from a long and rich life, nothing save errors,\
    \ crimes, and sickness\u2014a wasted body, a desolate soul, a breast filled with\
    \ poison, and an old age heavy with repentance and sorrow.\u201D \u2014 John Mather\
    \ Austin, Golden Steps To Respectability, Usefulness And Happiness"
