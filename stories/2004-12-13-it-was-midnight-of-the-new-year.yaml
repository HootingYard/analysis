  text: '"It was midnight of the new year, and an aged man stood thoughtfully at the
    window. He gazed with a long, despairing look, upon the fixed, eternal, and glorious
    heaven, and down upon the silent, still, and snow-white earth, whereon was none
    so joyless, so sleepless as he. For his grave stood open near him; it was covered
    only with the snows of age, not decked with the green of youth; and he brought
    with him, from a long and rich life, nothing save errors, crimes, and sickness--a
    wasted body, a desolate soul, a breast filled with poison, and an old age heavy
    with repentance and sorrow." -- John Mather Austin, Golden Steps To Respectability,
    Usefulness And Happiness'
