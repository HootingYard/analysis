  text: 'In spite of that little grumble in today''s first item, never let Hooting
    Yard be accused of being out of touch with popular culture. It''s just that we''re
    discriminating in what we pay attention to. Today, for example, we celebrate the
    double birthday of not just one of the finest male voice icons in twentieth century
    cinema, but two.

    Christopher Plummer is 77 today, and decades have passed since his bizarre, strangulated,
    bird-like squawkings as Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt Of The Sun. I have spent hours
    upon hours trawling the internet to find out if a Plummermaniac has posted sound
    samples from the film, but to no avail. Happy birthday, Atahualpa.

    Born on the same day two years before Plummer was Dick Van Dyke, the man who invented
    cockney, or possibly mockney, or whatever that accent was that he used to such
    powerful effect in Mary Poppins. Chim chim cheroo indeed. One little-known fact
    about Dick, possibly because it is entirely spurious, is that he signed a multibillion
    dollar deal to allow his initials to be used by the manufacturers of DVD technology.
    At one point, the now-ubiquitous discs were going to be called EVDs, because Chariots
    Of The Gods? author and wag Erich Von Daniken was asking for less money for his
    initials. The full story is told in Chimney Sweep Versus Spaceman : A Gripping
    Thriller Of The Business World, available from all good airports.'
