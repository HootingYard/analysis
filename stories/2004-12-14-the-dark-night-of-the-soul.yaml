  text: 'Today is not only the Hooting Yard website''s first birthday, it is also
    the feast day of St John of the Cross, author of that classic work The Dark Night
    Of The Soul. I recommend a thorough reading of the text, if only to remind oneself
    that this is the original, and is not to be confused with Park No Lip''s Korean
    underworld pulp potboiler The Dark Night Of Seoul, which is in itself a classic,
    but in a different way.


    St John of the Cross

    Alas, in his dotage, Dobson did get the books mixed up, which is why his pamphlet
    A Full And Frank Commentary On "The Dark Night Of The Soul", Wherein Certain Controversial
    Theories Are Proposed Which Have Led The Author Into Fist-Fights With Sailors
    Outside Tough Drinking Taverns In The Marseilles Dockyards (out-of-print) is such
    a scrappy piece of work. Reading it, one can only rue the day that Dobson accepted
    medical advice from a charlatan, and began to take regular infusions of a so-called
    "patent embrocation for the cranium" which made his last days such a trial.

    Aloysius Nestingbird commented "If I ever get my hands on that quack I will strangle
    him with string and fling his lifeless corpse off the end of one of the jetties
    to which I have the right of access after a series of lengthy court cases which
    you don''t want to hear about, believe you me". Nestingbird said this to me--spitting
    vitriol--while we rummaged around in a battered old bureau somewhere deep in the
    Dobson Archives, trying to find evidence that the pamphleteer had ever actually
    visited the notorious French port. That he once spent an afternoon in Le Havre,
    accompanied by a chuckling maniac, we well knew. But Marseilles? Could it be that
    the title of Dobson''s late pamphlet was a piece of fantastic embroidery? If so,
    his entire career would take on a new complexion, and an unwelcome one.

    Before Nestingbird and myself were able to complete our search of the bureau,
    a hot and unexpected lamentable thing happened, and we had to abandon the building.
    As we blundered our way towards the perimeter fence, a messenger ran towards us
    bearing news of a new Yoko Ono installation. There was only one thing to do.

    Bafflingly, the bureau has since disappeared, and with it any chance of completing
    the magazine article Was Dobson In Marseilles?--A Discursive Analysis, for which
    Nestingbird and I had been promised a few pounds, or if not that much at least
    enough for a potato each. But penury, it seems, is destined to dog my footsteps.
