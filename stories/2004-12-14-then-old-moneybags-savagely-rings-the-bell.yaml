  text: '"Then Old Moneybags savagely rings the bell. Enters the butler, obsequious
    and solicitous. ''The coffee is bad, the toast is vile, everything is wrong. You
    are a deleted deleted deleted deleted rascal.'' Exit the butler, outwardly humble,
    inwardly a raging flood of anger, and he meets the maid, who archly invites his
    attentions. She gets them, only they are in the form of an angry shove and an
    oath. White with indignation, she stamps her foot and runs into the kitchen, bursting
    into tears. The cook, solicitous, receives a slap in the face, and as the maid
    bounces out, the cook, seeking a victim, grabs away the gingerbread from the butcher''s
    boy. And that still hungry juvenile slams the door as he leaves and kicks the
    slumbering cat off the back doorstep. Unfortunately the film did not show what
    the outraged cat did." -- Abraham Myerson, The Nervous Housewife'
