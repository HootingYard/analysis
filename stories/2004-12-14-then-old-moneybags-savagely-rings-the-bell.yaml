  text: "\u201CThen Old Moneybags savagely rings the bell. Enters the butler, obsequious\
    \ and solicitous. \u2018The coffee is bad, the toast is vile, everything is wrong.\
    \ You are a deleted deleted deleted deleted rascal.\u2019 Exit the butler, outwardly\
    \ humble, inwardly a raging flood of anger, and he meets the maid, who archly\
    \ invites his attentions. She gets them, only they are in the form of an angry\
    \ shove and an oath. White with indignation, she stamps her foot and runs into\
    \ the kitchen, bursting into tears. The cook, solicitous, receives a slap in the\
    \ face, and as the maid bounces out, the cook, seeking a victim, grabs away the\
    \ gingerbread from the butcher's boy. And that still hungry juvenile slams the\
    \ door as he leaves and kicks the slumbering cat off the back doorstep. Unfortunately\
    \ the film did not show what the outraged cat did.\u201D \u2014 Abraham Myerson,\
    \ The Nervous Housewife"
