  text: 'Regular readers will recall that some months ago we appointed a Hooting Yard
    Tsar, the reason being that it seemed a fashionable thing to do. The government
    has transport tsars and drugs tsars and smoking tsars and so on, so why should
    we be left out? The Hooting Yard Tsar is an antipodean named Bruce Gilbert, and
    our equally antipodean Tsar-watcher, Glyn Webster, has just filed this report:

    The Hooting Yard Tsar has been issuing directives daily, usually by phone. His
    directives are majestically profound, poetic and logical. I''m not always sure
    who they are directed towards, but if they were to be followed they would place
    Western Civilisation on a new, deeper foundation and lead the world towards an
    end currently inconceivable to any other being now living--some great change in
    human history as profound as the invention of the city or the written word. Sometimes
    I find these directives so tearfully inspiring that I wish I could remember to
    leave a pencil by the phone to write one or two down.

    On an unrelated note, here is my entry for the November Audubon Bird Of The Month
    competition, which nobody ever notices because it''s at the bottom of the page
    and people tend not to scroll down that far unless they are indefatigable, like
    me. I know what that bird is, it''s a Southern Kokako. I''d know the Southern
    Kokako''s haunting, cathedral bell-like cry anywhere--although I have to admit
    to not knowing what it looks like.

    Glyn wins a prize in the form of a vague fugitive cloud of roseate vapour or aura.
    Well done! December''s contest can be found at the foot of the page.'
