  text: '"Man is formed from a species of mussel. If made of the hard mussel he lives
    long--it is difficult for him to die. But if he happens to be made of the poisonous
    mussel, he is fragile, easily upset, and does not live long. The soul of man is
    called his anganga, or that which goes or comes. It is said to be the daughter
    of Taufanuu, or vapour of lands, which forms clouds, and as the dark cloudy covering
    of night comes on, man feels sleepy, because his soul wishes to go and visit its
    mother." -- George Turner, Samoa, A Hundred Years Ago And Long Before'
