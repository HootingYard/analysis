  text: "I appear to have misunderstood the heading of the previous item, which means\
    \ that what I wrote above is complete nonsense. The club of the title is not a\
    \ society or association. It is, rather, a bludgeon. \u201CThe cardboard club\u201D\
    \ refers to a weapon made of cardboard which was used as a theatrical prop during\
    \ the Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre's production of Istvan Scrimgeour's Pinteresque\
    \ drama A Few People Sitting Around In The Dark Hating Each Other. The cardboard\
    \ club appears in the following scene in Act XVIII:\nThe Iris Murdoch Character\
    \ : Shall we go on a picnic?\nThe V S Naipaul Character : (after a pause) Say\
    \ that again and I'll bash out your brains with a cardboard club.\nThe Iris Murdoch\
    \ Character : I expect you will, but what's your motivation?\nThe V S Naipaul\
    \ Character : (after a longer pause) Put a sock in it.\nThe Iris Murdoch Character\
    \ : Dust and ashes. Ashes and dust.\nThe V S Naipaul Character bashes the Iris\
    \ Murdoch Character over the head with the cardboard club, repeatedly. She falls\
    \ to the ground.\nThe V S Naipaul Character : Don't say I didn't warn you. I'm\
    \ going to go and write one of my well-regarded novels.\nExit"
