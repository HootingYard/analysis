  text: 'I appear to have misunderstood the heading of the previous item, which means
    that what I wrote above is complete nonsense. The club of the title is not a society
    or association. It is, rather, a bludgeon. "The cardboard club" refers to a weapon
    made of cardboard which was used as a theatrical prop during the Bodger''s Spinney
    Variety Theatre''s production of Istvan Scrimgeour''s Pinteresque drama A Few
    People Sitting Around In The Dark Hating Each Other. The cardboard club appears
    in the following scene in Act XVIII:

    The Iris Murdoch Character : Shall we go on a picnic?

    The V S Naipaul Character : (after a pause) Say that again and I''ll bash out
    your brains with a cardboard club.

    The Iris Murdoch Character : I expect you will, but what''s your motivation?

    The V S Naipaul Character : (after a longer pause) Put a sock in it.

    The Iris Murdoch Character : Dust and ashes. Ashes and dust.

    The V S Naipaul Character bashes the Iris Murdoch Character over the head with
    the cardboard club, repeatedly. She falls to the ground.

    The V S Naipaul Character : Don''t say I didn''t warn you. I''m going to go and
    write one of my well-regarded novels.

    Exit'
