  text: 'I received a thrilling email from Danielle Barton, who says, among other
    things: Hello, I visited your siteand feel that your site would be perfect for
    inclusion in our free yard directory. I was very touched that Ms Barton had presumably
    spent her weekend reading the Hooting Yard pages in order to arrive at her view
    that the site is "perfect for inclusion" in her listing. It is quite an honour
    to get such a vote of confidence from someone who specialises in yards. I am going
    to write back to her to express my profound gratitude, and I may slip in a question
    that has been preoccupying me since I read her delightful letter. "Are you by
    any chance," I will ask, "related to Special Agent Dick Barton from the long-ago
    radio serial?"

    As I sit here basking in the glow of being included in a free yard directory,
    I cannot help but feel a slight pang of disappointment that to date no hooting
    specialist has written to invite me to be in a free hooting directory. Perhaps
    that wondrous day will come before such time as I become a doddery, spavined and
    toothless wretch. Possibly by next Friday, then.'
