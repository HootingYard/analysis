  text: "I received a thrilling email from Danielle Barton, who says, among other\
    \ things: Hello, I visited your siteand feel that your site would be perfect for\
    \ inclusion in our free yard directory. I was very touched that Ms Barton had\
    \ presumably spent her weekend reading the Hooting Yard pages in order to arrive\
    \ at her view that the site is \u201Cperfect for inclusion\u201D in her listing.\
    \ It is quite an honour to get such a vote of confidence from someone who specialises\
    \ in yards. I am going to write back to her to express my profound gratitude,\
    \ and I may slip in a question that has been preoccupying me since I read her\
    \ delightful letter. \u201CAre you by any chance,\u201D I will ask, \u201Crelated\
    \ to Special Agent Dick Barton from the long-ago radio serial?\u201D\nAs I sit\
    \ here basking in the glow of being included in a free yard directory, I cannot\
    \ help but feel a slight pang of disappointment that to date no hooting specialist\
    \ has written to invite me to be in a free hooting directory. Perhaps that wondrous\
    \ day will come before such time as I become a doddery, spavined and toothless\
    \ wretch. Possibly by next Friday, then."
