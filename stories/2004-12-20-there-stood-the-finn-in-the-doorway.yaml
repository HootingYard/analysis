  text: '"There stood the Finn in the doorway talking to his reindeer, although they
    were far away in the mountains. He barred the wolf''s way, and threatened the
    bear with spells; and then he opened his skin sack, so that the storm howled and
    piped, and there was a swirl of ashes into the hut. And when all grew quiet again,
    the air was thick with yellow bumble-bees, which settled inside his furs, whilst
    he gabbled and mumbled and wagged his skull-like head." -- Jonas Lie, Weird Tales
    From Northern Seas'
