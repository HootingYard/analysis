  text: "\u201CThere stood the Finn in the doorway talking to his reindeer, although\
    \ they were far away in the mountains. He barred the wolf's way, and threatened\
    \ the bear with spells; and then he opened his skin sack, so that the storm howled\
    \ and piped, and there was a swirl of ashes into the hut. And when all grew quiet\
    \ again, the air was thick with yellow bumble-bees, which settled inside his furs,\
    \ whilst he gabbled and mumbled and wagged his skull-like head.\u201D \u2014 Jonas\
