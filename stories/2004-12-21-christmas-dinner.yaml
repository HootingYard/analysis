  text: "Here is a recipe for your Christmas dinner, if you are planning on having\
    \ one. It is taken from Dobson's pamphlet Some Things To Eat In The Bleak Midwinter.\n\
    \nBoiled Cormorant A La Dobson (for Malachy O'Neill)\nThis is a splendid and satisfying\
    \ dish, easy to prepare, highly nutritious, and the enemy of indigestion. First,\
    \ ensure your kitchen is free of verminous creeping things with hundreds of legs,\
    \ suckers and antennae. Root them out and exterminate them. Gather the tiny corpses,\
    \ place them in a paper bag, seal the bag with glue, carry it out of the house,\
    \ and set fire to it. Do not go back indoors until every last speck has been consumed\
    \ by the terrible flames. Now, back in the kitchen, take off your windcheater\
    \ and your big black boots and wash your hands with carbolic soap. Cover your\
    \ hairstyle, if you have one, with a clean rag fixed in place by an elastic band.\
    \ You are ready to begin.\nTake a freshly-slaughtered cormorant and place it on\
    \ your work-surface. Vegetarians can substitute the bird with a pretend cormorant\
    \ modelled in marzipan. I will not remind you of this point again. Pluck all the\
    \ feathers off and put them in a grinder. Grind them to fine powder, and, using\
    \ a funnel, pour the powder into a spare cruet. If there is a ring around the\
    \ cormorant's neck, as there will be if it has been exploited by fisherfolk, carefully\
    \ remove the ring and throw it away, unless it is old and decorative, in which\
    \ case you may wish to pop it in an envelope and send it to Antiques Roadshow\
    \ veteran Hugh Scully. But do that later, on Boxing Day.\nStep two. Boil the cormorant.\n\
    While the bird is simmering away, prepare the sauce. Chop up into tiny bits four\
    \ pomegranates, a plum, lots and lots of potatoes, sixteen bananas, another cormorant,\
    \ some toffee apples and a choc ice. Place the tiny bits in a bowl and stir thoroughly,\
    \ then get the funnel again and pour the contents of the bowl into the grinder.\
    \ Adjust the setting to \u201Cmoderately violent grinding\u201D and switch it\
    \ on for no more than ten seconds. Transfer back into the bowl. Add water up to\
    \ the brim and stir. Do not on any account use tap water. You will ruin the recipe\
    \ and end up with a bowl of inedible sludge unless you use the fantastically pure\
    \ spring water drawn from the Mysterious Old Well at Pointy Town.\nDrain any remaining\
    \ water from the pan with the boiled cormorant in it, and tip the contents of\
    \ the bowl in, making sure you do so in one swift movement. Ideally, it should\
    \ sound like this\u2014gloop gloop gloop\u2026gloop. Now put the bowl down somewhere,\
    \ bring the pan back to the boil and allow to simmer while you fry the cocktail\
    \ sausages. They should be almost, but not quite, black.\nYou are nearly done.\
    \ Take a large oval platter and make a bed of shredded lettuce, chives, spring\
    \ onions, porridge oats, cream crackers and mayonnaise. Have another look around\
    \ the kitchen to make sure no creepy-crawlies have appeared from any unhatched\
    \ eggs you may have overlooked earlier.\nTurn off the heat, and transfer the boiled\
    \ cormorant and sauce on to the platter. Use a clean dishcloth to wipe around\
    \ the edges in case any of the sauce is dribbling over the side. Take a Swiss\
    \ Army knife out of your pocket, extract the sharpest blade, and, just in case\
    \ the last time you used it was to dislodge a pebble from the sole of your boot,\
    \ plunge it into boiling water to sterilise it. Very carefully slice the blade\
    \ across the cormorant, as deep as you can, and put the knife down. Insert the\
    \ cocktail sausages into the bird, then sew up the slit with edible butcher's\
    \ string.\nTry to remember where you left the spare cruet, and sprinkle the powdered\
    \ cormorant feathers evenly over the dish. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve."
