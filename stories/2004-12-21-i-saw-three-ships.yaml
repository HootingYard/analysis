  text: "I saw three ships come sailing in, but what did I care about ships? I wasn't\
    \ hanging around in the dockyards because I wanted to look at ships. I am an entomologist,\
    \ and I was here to trap boll weevils. I watched them scuttling out of sacks of\
    \ flour being unloaded from one of the three ships, so I pounced on them with\
    \ my nylon boll weevil net, and ferried them back to my lab.\nI cackled as I assembled\
    \ my equipment. How they glistened, my pincers and knives and scalpels and clamps\
    \ and suction tubes and Petri dishes! Pulling on my lab coat, the white starched\
    \ cotton splattered here and there with the blood of insects, I scampered like\
    \ an excited puppy over to the Dansette and put on my favourite Ronnie Milsap\
    \ LP. I like to listen to country music as I dissect boll weevils.\nI was just\
    \ sharpening one of my scalpels when the door of the lab burst open. Cursing that\
    \ I had forgotten to lock it, I span round to find myself confronted by a trio\
    \ of heavily-armed thugs. They were, to a man, huge, very frightening, and togged\
    \ out in futuristic Robocop-like uniforms. Their helmets had been burnished to\
    \ a gleam that I could only envy.\n\u201CDrop the scalpel, pigdog!\u201D shouted\
    \ one of them, loud enough to be heard over Ronnie Milsap. I froze, but managed\
    \ to let the blade fall from my hand. It clattered on the linoleum. I do not approve\
    \ of carpets or rugs in an insect laboratory.\nA second thug snatched up from\
    \ my work-bench the canvas bag in which I had put the boll weevils. He lifted\
    \ the visor from his helmet and looked at me with snarling contempt. When he spoke,\
    \ I was disconcerted by the fluting gentility of his tone.\n\u201CNever, ever,\
    \ trap boll weevils as they scuttle out of our flour sacks on the dockside when\
    \ three ships come sailing in,\u201D he said.\nCrushed and piteous, I began to\
    \ mumble something, but he waved a gauntleted hand at me, and interrupted.\n\u201C\
    If we ever catch you abducting our boll weevils again, we will do something unimaginably\
    \ horrible to you,\u201D he said, \u201CSo be warned.\u201D\nAnd with that, the\
    \ three thugs swept out of the lab, slamming the door behind them. I took a napkin\
    \ from my pocket and mopped my brow. I was shaking. Ronnie Milsap was singing.\
    \ It was on the very same day that David Blunkett resigned as the Home Secretary.\n\
    \nThree boll weevils, David Blunkett, and a fourth boll weevil *\n* NOTE : Yes,\
    \ these are all the same boll weevil. The illustration is for demonstration purposes\
    \ only."
