  text: 'Many readers may be unaware that there are other sites on the web, apart
    from Hooting Yard, which are worth a visit. We asked Mrs Gubbins to recommend
    just a few of her favourites as a little Christmas treat. So off you go a-roaming--but
    don''t forget to come back!

    Mrs Gubbins directs your attention to:

    Vexillology

    Lorem Ipsum

    Archaic Medical Terms

    The Owl Pages

    Portolan Charts
