  text: "I went to the shops and bought some custard. I went to the shops and bought\
    \ some custard and a brooch. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a\
    \ brooch and a flap. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch\
    \ and a flap and the Pin of Pang. I went to the shops and bought some custard\
    \ and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras. I went to\
    \ the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang\
    \ and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart. I went to the shops and bought some custard\
    \ and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam\
    \ tart and four and twenty blackbirds. I went to the shops and bought some custard\
    \ and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam\
    \ tart and four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. I went to\
    \ the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang\
    \ and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and grease\
    \ in a big round tin and then I went home and took each item out of its paper\
    \ bag, and put the paper bags on the fire, and smoke billowed up the chimney,\
    \ and I saw that it was good, and I declared that it was good, in a loud voice,\
    \ so loud that my neighbours came a-running, they tumbled into my room in their\
    \ stockinged feet, and I stood there like a Jack o'Lantern, with my custard and\
    \ brooch and flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and my jam tart and\
    \ four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin, and I said to my neighbours\
    \ \u201CBehold what I have bought at the shops, ye neighbourly folk, behold and\
    \ wonder,\u201D and they did, and I made a pot of tea and handed around cups,\
    \ and I filled their cups from the pot, and my shopping I distributed to my neighbours\
    \ as gifts, and their hearts grew warm, and that is what happened when I had what\
    \ is called an \u201CAt Home\u201D, in my simple cottage on the outskirts of the\
    \ farm, where cows graze and hens cluck, and the farmer has gone to seed."
