  text: I went to the shops and bought some custard. I went to the shops and bought
    some custard and a brooch. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch
    and a flap. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap
    and the Pin of Pang. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch
    and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras. I went to the shops and
    bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of
    Hudibras and a jam tart. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch
    and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four
    and twenty blackbirds. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch
    and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four
    and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. I went to the shops and bought
    some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras
    and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin and
    then I went home and took each item out of its paper bag, and put the paper bags
    on the fire, and smoke billowed up the chimney, and I saw that it was good, and
    I declared that it was good, in a loud voice, so loud that my neighbours came
    a-running, they tumbled into my room in their stockinged feet, and I stood there
    like a Jack o'Lantern, with my custard and brooch and flap and the Pin of Pang
    and a copy of Hudibras and my jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and grease
    in a big round tin, and I said to my neighbours "Behold what I have bought at
    the shops, ye neighbourly folk, behold and wonder," and they did, and I made a
    pot of tea and handed around cups, and I filled their cups from the pot, and my
    shopping I distributed to my neighbours as gifts, and their hearts grew warm,
    and that is what happened when I had what is called an "At Home", in my simple
    cottage on the outskirts of the farm, where cows graze and hens cluck, and the
    farmer has gone to seed.
