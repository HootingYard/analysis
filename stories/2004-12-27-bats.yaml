  text: 'Having your blood sucked by a vampire bat can be an alarming experience,
    and not at all like being bled by leeches. In the latter case, you are likely
    to be attended by a kindly apothecary or physician, who will apply the leeches
    and make reassuring noises. Alternatively, you may be trudging through a swamp,
    and leeches will fasten upon your legs and begin to drain your blood, but in such
    cases you are unlikely to notice them, as you will be half-submerged in the swamp,
    therefore in your ignorance of the leeches you will not be frightened. A vampire
    bat is likely to attack you without warning, however, and so you will be alarmed.

    Many folk make the mistake of lumping in pipistrelle, Egyptian fruit, red, long-nosed,
    little brown, pallid, western mastiff, serotine, pocketed free-tailed, woolly
    false vampire, hoary, Indiana, northern, ghost-faced, greater horseshoe, Brandt,
    Honduran white, Natterer''s, lappet-browed, noctule, Ipanema, tent-making, big
    brown, evening, yellow, spotted, Nathusius pipistrelle and other bats with vampire
    bats, and thus being fearful of them all. But only the vampire bat will plunge
    its fangs in to the soft white flesh of your neck and begin to drain you of your
    vital gore. If you are awake, and especially if you are active, for example playing
    lawn tennis, orienteering, or doing outdoor carpentry, you will be able to fight
    off the vampire bat. Remember that you are bigger and stronger than it is, and
    be not afraid.

    On the other hand, if you are fast asleep, and unprotected by an anti-bat curtain
    of heavy purple brocade, the vampire bat may suck your blood uninterrupted, until
    its thirst is sated. If you are the bat''s first victim for a while, it may drink
    all of your blood, and you will not wake up, because you will be lifeless. Do
    not believe those foolish stories about waking after a visit from a vampire bat
    and tentatively feeling punctures in your neck and thenceforth being a kind of
    undead human version with a bloodlust of your own. That will only happen if you
    live in Transylvania and bear a resemblance to Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney. Note
    that Lon Chaney is not to be confused with Lyn Cheney, wife of the current US
    vice-president.
