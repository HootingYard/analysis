  text: "\u201CFor thirty years his mottled nose and the rubicundity of his cheeks\
    \ were the ineffaceable ensigns of his intemperance. Yet there was a grimy humour\
    \ in his forbidding aspect. The fusty black coat, which sat ill upon his shambling\
    \ frame, was all besmirched with spilled snuff, and the lees of a thousand quart\
    \ pots. The bands of his profession were ever awry upon a tattered shirt. His\
    \ ancient wig scattered dust and powder as he went, while a single buckle of some\
    \ tawdry metal gave a look of oddity to his clumsy, slipshod feet.\u201D \u2014\
