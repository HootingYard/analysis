  text: '"I have always been impressed in reading the books of John Ruskin to note
    how many times he speaks about the hands... his words are always full of meaning,
    and I would have you, from the first days, know something of him and elect him
    to your friendship. Many times he will speak to you in short, rude words, impatiently
    too, but never mind that, his heart is warm and full of good." -- Thomas Tapper,
    Music Talks With Children'
