  text: "Here is the first tranche of a new series in which we will attempt to provide\
    \ a thorough and valuable learning experience for all our readers. Perhaps you\
    \ failed to pay attention when you were at your community hub? [Note: you may\
    \ recall it being called a \u201Cschool\u201D. That was then\u2026] Online Learning\
    \ With Hooting Yard can help you catch up with all the vital information that\
    \ passed you by.\nEach lesson\u2014specially devised by a team headed by Fatima\
    \ Gilliblat\u2014consists of two questions, to which model answers are given.\
    \ They have been carefully researched and are guaranteed correct. No longer need\
    \ you be stuck for an answer when accosted in the street, or buttonholed at a\
    \ fashionable cocktail party in a rotating restaurant at the top of a high building.\
    \ Memorise the answers, or, if your memory is a sorry and puny thing, write them\
    \ down on the cuff of your shirt or blouse on the same side as you wear your wristwatch.\
    \ You will soon be sparkling in company, and everyone will be envious of your\
    \ cleverness.\nLesson One\nQ\u2014Are crocodiles frightened of otters?\nA\u2014\
    Yes they are. If crocodiles roam into a stretch of river where otters are prevalent,\
    \ they will hasten away, for crocodiles fear otters.\nQ\u2014How did a priest\
    \ in Bolivia early in the last century supplement his income?\nA\u2014He divided\
    \ his graveyard into three sections\u2014Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell\u2014and\
    \ charged for burials accordingly."
