  text: 'Here is the first tranche of a new series in which we will attempt to provide
    a thorough and valuable learning experience for all our readers. Perhaps you failed
    to pay attention when you were at your community hub? [Note: you may recall it
    being called a "school". That was then...] Online Learning With Hooting Yard can
    help you catch up with all the vital information that passed you by.

    Each lesson--specially devised by a team headed by Fatima Gilliblat--consists
    of two questions, to which model answers are given. They have been carefully researched
    and are guaranteed correct. No longer need you be stuck for an answer when accosted
    in the street, or buttonholed at a fashionable cocktail party in a rotating restaurant
    at the top of a high building. Memorise the answers, or, if your memory is a sorry
    and puny thing, write them down on the cuff of your shirt or blouse on the same
    side as you wear your wristwatch. You will soon be sparkling in company, and everyone
    will be envious of your cleverness.

    Lesson One

    Q--Are crocodiles frightened of otters?

    A--Yes they are. If crocodiles roam into a stretch of river where otters are prevalent,
    they will hasten away, for crocodiles fear otters.

    Q--How did a priest in Bolivia early in the last century supplement his income?

    A--He divided his graveyard into three sections--Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell--and
    charged for burials accordingly.'
