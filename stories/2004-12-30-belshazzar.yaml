  text: 'Rembrandt''s source for this painting, the Old Testament Book of Daniel (5:
    1-6, 25-8), tells of a banquet Belshazzar, King of Babylon, gave for his nobles.
    At this banquet he blasphemously served wine in the sacred vessels his father
    Nebuchadnezzar had looted from the Temple in Jerusalem.

    Rembrandt shows the moment when a divine hand appeared and wrote on the wall a
    phrase only Daniel could decipher. When transliterated the inscription reads:
    MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation: ''God has numbered the
    days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; you have been weighed in the balances
    and found wanting; your kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.'' That very
    night Belshazzar was slain.

    Rembrandt derived the form of Hebrew inscription from a book by his friend, the
    learned Rabbi and printer, Menasseh ben Israel, yet mistranscribed one of the
    characters and arranged them in columns, rather than right to left, as Hebrew
    is written. The picture, painted in about 1635, is an example of Rembrandt''s
    attempt to establish himself as a painter of large-scale Baroque history paintings.
