    "Will you come with me to Belshazzar''s feast?" asked Agnetha.

    "I didn''t know you''d been invited. I''ll have to ask Bjorn," said Benny.

    Benny strode off into the mountains to find Bjorn. Agnetha stayed at the hotel,
    sipping her alcohol-free absinthe. Wild winds were howling and storm clouds gathered.

    Benny found Bjorn sheltering in a declivity. He was burning charcoal.

    "Agnetha wants me to go with her to Belshazzar''s feast," said Benny, after tipping
    his hat to Bjorn in greeting, "What do you think?"

    "The gods may throw a dice," said Bjorn, "Their minds as cold as ice." He stared
    off into the mist-enshrouded distance, towards the fireworks factory and the abandoned
    tennis courts.

    "I shall reflect on what you have said and come to a decision, then," said Benny,
    "Thank you."

    On the way back to the hotel, Benny was accosted on the mountain path by Anni-Frid.
    She was dressed like a gaucho and looked as if she had been weeping.

    "Anni-Frid, whatever is the matter?" asked Benny.

    Anni-Frid dabbed at her tears with a paper napkin from the hotel. Her upper lip
    curled in a sneer. Discomfited by her silence, Benny began to gabble.

    "Agnetha asked me to accompany her to Belshazzar''s feast," he said, "And I asked
    Bjorn for his advice. He is up there in a declivity burning charcoal."

    "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," said Anni-Frid, and she pranced away into the mist.'
