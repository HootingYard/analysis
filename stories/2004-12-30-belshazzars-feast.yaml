  text: "\n\u201CWill you come with me to Belshazzar's feast?\u201D asked Agnetha.\n\
    \u201CI didn't know you'd been invited. I'll have to ask Bj\xF6rn,\u201D said\
    \ Benny.\nBenny strode off into the mountains to find Bj\xF6rn. Agnetha stayed\
    \ at the hotel, sipping her alcohol-free absinthe. Wild winds were howling and\
    \ storm clouds gathered.\nBenny found Bj\xF6rn sheltering in a declivity. He was\
    \ burning charcoal.\n\u201CAgnetha wants me to go with her to Belshazzar's feast,\u201D\
    \ said Benny, after tipping his hat to Bj\xF6rn in greeting, \u201CWhat do you\
    \ think?\u201D\n\u201CThe gods may throw a dice,\u201D said Bj\xF6rn, \u201CTheir\
    \ minds as cold as ice.\u201D He stared off into the mist-enshrouded distance,\
    \ towards the fireworks factory and the abandoned tennis courts.\n\u201CI shall\
    \ reflect on what you have said and come to a decision, then,\u201D said Benny,\
    \ \u201CThank you.\u201D\nOn the way back to the hotel, Benny was accosted on\
    \ the mountain path by Anni-Frid. She was dressed like a gaucho and looked as\
    \ if she had been weeping.\n\u201CAnni-Frid, whatever is the matter?\u201D asked\
    \ Benny.\nAnni-Frid dabbed at her tears with a paper napkin from the hotel. Her\
    \ upper lip curled in a sneer. Discomfited by her silence, Benny began to gabble.\n\
    \u201CAgnetha asked me to accompany her to Belshazzar's feast,\u201D he said,\
    \ \u201CAnd I asked Bj\xF6rn for his advice. He is up there in a declivity burning\
    \ charcoal.\u201D\n\u201CMene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin,\u201D said Anni-Frid, and\
    \ she pranced away into the mist."
