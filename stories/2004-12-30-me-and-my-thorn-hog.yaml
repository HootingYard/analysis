  text: "I was given a common thorn-hog as a Christmas present. It is a wild pig,\
    \ long-bodied and flat-sided, in colour much the hue of the mud in which it wallows,\
    \ that mud being my front garden mud, which is somewhat darker than my back garden\
    \ mud. The mud along the side of the house is another shade again, but Carnforth\u2014\
    that is the pig's name\u2014seems to prefer the front garden, or at least the\
    \ mud in the front garden.\nI did not name her Carnforth. The benefactor who brought\
    \ her to me at crack of dawn on Christmas morning told me she had been named before\
    \ birth, like most thorn-hogs. The common practice, I was informed, is for these\
    \ wild pigs to be called after iconic railway stations, and Carnforth is, of course,\
    \ where Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard filmed Brief Encounter.\nIn addition to\
    \ telling me my new pig's name, my benefactor gave me a little booklet titled\
    \ So You've Been Given A Wild Pig?, which is packed with useful information on\
    \ how to care for it, or I should say, her. Not that Carnforth needs much care.\
    \ She spends most of her time wallowing in the mud in my front garden, and twice\
    \ a day I unlock the gate to let her out so she can go rampaging about the hills,\
    \ grunting furiously and waylaying anything edible. She is, after all, a wild\
    \ pig.\nAs she is fond of thorns, I took Carnforth to the garden centre when it\
    \ opened for its Boxing Day sale, and we had a lovely time looking at the rosebushes.\
    \ I think I can tell from her prolonged and noisy grunts that she would like to\
    \ go back there when they have restocked.\nI have not yet allowed my thorn-hog\
    \ into the house, as I am in the middle of redecorating. Sometimes in the middle\
    \ of the night I can hear her thumping violently against the door trying to get\
    \ in, but I want to finish her indoor sty first. Transforming the entire downstairs\
    \ is going to be quite a job, but it will be such a nice surprise for her. The\
    \ price of straw is high at the moment, so I may have to wait for the market to\
    \ settle. Meanwhile, I am keeping an eagle eye on both hay and straw futures,\
    \ and counting up all the loose change in my jars.\nI would write a thank you\
    \ letter to my benefactor for such a delightful gift, but he did not leave a forwarding\
    \ address. Indeed, after delivering the wild pig, he scampered away at high speed,\
    \ shouting \u201CMerry Christmas!\u201D as if in the throes of a hysterical fit.\
    \ And do you know something? I had never set eyes on him before."
