  text: 'Winner of the December Audubon Bird-of-the-Month Competition (see foot of
    the page) was reader Pierre Sloggit, whose entry reads as follows:

    I know what this bird is, it''s a Taft''s Guillemot. It is shown in your picture
    guarding the famous oyster that was thought by many to incorporate in the convolutions
    of its shell an image of Howard Taft, one time US President. [Pierre is, I think,
    using here an outmoded term for "Potus".] This bird was only discovered in the
    early twentieth century and was therefore added to a supplement of Audubon''s
    work.* It should be distinguished from Barbara''s Guillemot, which of course stands
    guard over the head of former First Lady, Barbara Bush, who by remarkable coincidence
    has a facial birthmark that looks like an oyster, as well as a moustache like
    Howard Taft.

    *Missing Guillemots and Auks: Series IX (Presidential Guillemots): Supplementary
    vols. CCCXI - CCCXXVIII (Great Lakes and Seaway Guillemots, Three Toed and Lesser).

    Pierre wins a hallucinatory bowl of myrrh and some trinkets.'
