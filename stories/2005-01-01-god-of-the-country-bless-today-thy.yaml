  text: '"God of the country, bless today Thy cheese, For which we give Thee thanks
    on bended knees. Let them be fat or light, with onions blent, Shallots, brine,
    pepper, honey; whether scent Of sheep or fields is in them, in the yard Let them,
    good Lord, at dawn be beaten hard. And let their edges take on silvery shades
    Under the moist red hands of dairymaids; And, round and greenish, let them go
    to town Weighing the shepherd''s folding mantle down; Whether from Parma or from
    Jura heights, Kneaded by august hands of Carmelites." -- M Thomas Braun, quoted
    in Bob Brown, The Complete Book Of Cheese'
