  text: 'One of the more lamentable episodes in Dobson''s career was the year he wasted
    trying to write a Tolkeinish fantasy novel. What on earth got into him? It was
    the year Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba, that Alaska and Hawaii joined the United
    States, that Archbishop Makarios returned to Cyprus from exile; the year of a
    royal wedding in Belgium and of the so-called kitchen debate between Nikita Krushchev
    and Richard Milhous Nixon. It was the year which saw the debut of Rod Serling''s
    Twilight Zone, but also, in February, the day the music died. John McEnroe, Jens
    Stoltenberg, Max Decharne and Magic Johnson were born during that twelvemonth,
    while Frank Lloyd Wright, Mario Lanza, and Blind Willie McTell all perished.

    And all the while Dobson was holed up in a hut in some Arctic wasteland, writing
    something to which he gave the working title Phantasmal Quest Thing. It is anybody''s
    guess why he tried to write fantasy fiction. He had no feel for the genre. The
    reader will find here no elves, hobbits, or wizards--just fleas and flies. Dobson
    seemed to think he could build a thousand-page epic around a flea called Dave.
    The other characters--if such they can be called--have equally prosaic names.
    Instead of, say, Aragorn, Legolas and Gandalf we get Keith, Colin, Sue and Geoff.
    In place of adventures, we get these barely-anthropomorphised insects--accompanied
    by a few midges, ticks and bluebottles--flying and leaping around the place engaged
    in conversations which report on action sequences that are never themselves described.


    Tolkein : witless twaddle

    It is a soulless and tedious work, and it is best to draw a veil over Dobson''s
    habit, during that year, of dressing in cardigans and tweeds, hanging around in
    taverns drinking warm beer, and spouting politically reactionary drivel as a way
    of ingratiating himself with the fantasists he modelled himself upon. Let us just
    be thankful that Marigold Chew snapped him out of it. On the twelfth of October
    1959 she bundled him on to a boat, locked him in the cabin, and, through a coded
    system of knuckle-raps on the door, threatened him with a big fierce sword-wielding
    pneumatic robot dervish. It was a turning point in his career.'
