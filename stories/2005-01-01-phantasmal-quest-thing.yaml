  text: "One of the more lamentable episodes in Dobson's career was the year he wasted\
    \ trying to write a Tolkeinish fantasy novel. What on earth got into him? It was\
    \ the year Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba, that Alaska and Hawaii joined the United\
    \ States, that Archbishop Makarios returned to Cyprus from exile; the year of\
    \ a royal wedding in Belgium and of the so-called kitchen debate between Nikita\
    \ Krushchev and Richard Milhous Nixon. It was the year which saw the debut of\
    \ Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, but also, in February, the day the music died.\
    \ John McEnroe, Jens Stoltenberg, Max D\xE9charn\xE9 and Magic Johnson were born\
    \ during that twelvemonth, while Frank Lloyd Wright, Mario Lanza, and Blind Willie\
    \ McTell all perished.\nAnd all the while Dobson was holed up in a hut in some\
    \ Arctic wasteland, writing something to which he gave the working title Phantasmal\
    \ Quest Thing. It is anybody's guess why he tried to write fantasy fiction. He\
    \ had no feel for the genre. The reader will find here no elves, hobbits, or wizards\u2014\
    just fleas and flies. Dobson seemed to think he could build a thousand-page epic\
    \ around a flea called Dave. The other characters\u2014if such they can be called\u2014\
    have equally prosaic names. Instead of, say, Aragorn, Legolas and Gandalf we get\
    \ Keith, Colin, Sue and Geoff. In place of adventures, we get these barely-anthropomorphised\
    \ insects\u2014accompanied by a few midges, ticks and bluebottles\u2014flying\
    \ and leaping around the place engaged in conversations which report on action\
    \ sequences that are never themselves described.\n\nTolkein : witless twaddle\n\
    It is a soulless and tedious work, and it is best to draw a veil over Dobson's\
    \ habit, during that year, of dressing in cardigans and tweeds, hanging around\
    \ in taverns drinking warm beer, and spouting politically reactionary drivel as\
    \ a way of ingratiating himself with the fantasists he modelled himself upon.\
    \ Let us just be thankful that Marigold Chew snapped him out of it. On the twelfth\
    \ of October 1959 she bundled him on to a boat, locked him in the cabin, and,\
    \ through a coded system of knuckle-raps on the door, threatened him with a big\
    \ fierce sword-wielding pneumatic robot dervish. It was a turning point in his\
    \ career."
