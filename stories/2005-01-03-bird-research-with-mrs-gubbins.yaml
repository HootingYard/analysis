  text: 'On Christmas Eve, we invited Mrs Gubbins to resume her occasional "weblink
    recommendations" which many readers find so invaluable. Indeed, the octogenarian
    crone became so excited that she brewed an extra pot of tea and ate a whole half-packet
    of those delicious Rich Tea(tm) biscuits. So, just over a week later, she''s back
    again:

    Hello readers, Mrs Gubbins here. One of the incidental pleasures of the BBC News
    site is their regular list of Ten Things We Didn''t Know This Time Last Week.
    At year''s end, they collected together 100 Things, which is my recommendation
    for you today. A word of warning, however. Many of these hundred things are quite
    dull, and one of them even mentions that loathsome fraud Clive James, who has
    been insulted here before*, with good reason. But I was quite taken with number
    11, which notes that in its original translation The Communist Manifesto spoke
    not of "a spectre haunting Europe", but of a "frightful hobgoblin", which is much
    more thrilling, and number 21, on the earliest use of the word "electricity".

    It is the bird facts, though, that make the site worth a visit. Find out about
    crows (4), pigeons (9), ducks (73), and birds crashing into buildings (76). There
    is also a photograph of some penguins.

    * NOTE:See "Minor Rant",19 September.'
