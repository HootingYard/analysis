  text: "On Christmas Eve, we invited Mrs Gubbins to resume her occasional \u201C\
    weblink recommendations\u201D which many readers find so invaluable. Indeed, the\
    \ octogenarian crone became so excited that she brewed an extra pot of tea and\
    \ ate a whole half-packet of those delicious Rich Tea\u2122 biscuits. So, just\
    \ over a week later, she's back again:\nHello readers, Mrs Gubbins here. One of\
    \ the incidental pleasures of the BBC News site is their regular list of Ten Things\
    \ We Didn't Know This Time Last Week. At year's end, they collected together 100\
    \ Things, which is my recommendation for you today. A word of warning, however.\
    \ Many of these hundred things are quite dull, and one of them even mentions that\
    \ loathsome fraud Clive James, who has been insulted here before*, with good reason.\
    \ But I was quite taken with number 11, which notes that in its original translation\
    \ The Communist Manifesto spoke not of \u201Ca spectre haunting Europe\u201D,\
    \ but of a \u201Cfrightful hobgoblin\u201D, which is much more thrilling, and\
    \ number 21, on the earliest use of the word \u201Celectricity\u201D.\nIt is the\
    \ bird facts, though, that make the site worth a visit. Find out about crows (4),\
    \ pigeons (9), ducks (73), and birds crashing into buildings (76). There is also\
    \ a photograph of some penguins.\n* NOTE:See \u201CMinor Rant\u201D,19 September."
