  text: '"Cornelius Gemma, lib. 2. de nat. mirac. c. 4. relates of a young maid, called
    Katherine Gualter, a cooper''s daughter, an. 1571. that had such strange passions
    and convulsions, three men could not sometimes hold her; she purged a live eel,
    which he saw, a foot and a half long, and touched it himself; but the eel afterwards
    vanished; she vomited some twenty-four pounds of fulsome stuff of all colours,
    twice a day for fourteen days; and after that she voided great balls of hair,
    pieces of wood, pigeon''s dung, parchment, goose dung, coals; and after them two
    pounds of pure blood, and then again coals and stones, on which some had inscriptions
    bigger than a walnut, some of them pieces of glass, brass, &c. besides paroxysms
    of laughing, weeping and ecstasies, &c. Et hoc (inquit) cum horore vidi, this
    I saw with horror." -- Robert Burton, The Anatomy Of Melancholy...

    ... the greatest book in the English language, from which I could quote endlessly,
    did I not have a one-quotation-per-writer policy for the Hooting Yard quote of
    the day. Arbitrary and senseless, I know, but therein lies part of this site''s
    charm.'
