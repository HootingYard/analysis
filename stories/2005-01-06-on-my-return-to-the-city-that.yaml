  text: '"On my return to the city that night, I felt a positive sensation that my
    brain had caught fire. It was alight as though a small sun was located in it and
    I passed the whole night applying cold compressions to my tortured head. Finally
    the flashes diminished in frequency and force but it took more than three weeks
    before they wholly subsided. These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves
    from time to time... but they are no longer exciting." -- Nikola Tesla, The Strange
    Life Of Nikola Tesla'
