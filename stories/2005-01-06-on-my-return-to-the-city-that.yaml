  text: "\u201COn my return to the city that night, I felt a positive sensation that\
    \ my brain had caught fire. It was alight as though a small sun was located in\
    \ it and I passed the whole night applying cold compressions to my tortured head.\
    \ Finally the flashes diminished in frequency and force but it took more than\
    \ three weeks before they wholly subsided. These luminous phenomena still manifest\
    \ themselves from time to time\u2026 but they are no longer exciting.\u201D \u2014\
