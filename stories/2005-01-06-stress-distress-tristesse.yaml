  text: 'Most readers will have seen one of those lists of life-events ranked in order
    of the stress they cause. (If you haven''t, go here, but come straight back.)
    Now, our in-house team of psychologists, brain experts, phrenologists, mesmerists
    and cranial integument analysts have devised a definitive list based on a study
    of everyone on earth, alive and dead. Here are the top ten stress-inducing events.

    1. Staring at a bee.

    2. Inky fingers.

    3. Eating fruit in a concrete paddling pool.

    4. Dreaming of natterjack toads.

    5. Broken Godspell soundtrack LP.

    6. Impenetrable flimflam.

    7. Klaxon next to ear.

    8. Being trapped in a birdcage with a starving chough.

    9. Library ticket panic.

    10. Unravelling Fairisle sweater.'
