  text: 'Many moons have passed since we last received a letter of complaint from
    Dr Ruth Pastry, but she has at last been stirred into action. The following email
    arrived the other day:

    Dear Mr Key : I was disturbed to note, in your item headed Petrochemical Shiver-Me-Timbers
    Conclave (20th December 2004), that you unthinkingly preceded the word corsair
    with bloodthirsty. This is not only a cliche, but also panders to the stereotype
    of corsairs as violent maniacs who careen around the decks of sailing ships off
    the Barbary Coast with gleaming cutlasses clenched between their equally gleaming
    teeth. I have met many corsairs in my time, and not one of them bears any resemblance
    to this nonsensical image. Indeed, the corsair with whom I was best acquainted,
    in that he was my fiance for a few months in the early 1970s, was a gentle soul
    named Federico Dellapiccola de Grunwald, who spoke with a pronounced lisp and
    whose usual form of locomotion, when he wasn''t prancing, was to mince. I do not
    think he had ever been near a cutlass in his life. Much of his time, whenever
    he was absent from his buccaneering privateer ship, was spent raising rhododendrons
    and dahlias, holding raffles in aid of the local orphanage, and gambolling o''er
    green fields with puppies and flopsy-tailed bunny rabbits. Next time you write
    about corsairs, please be more accurate. Yours fuming, Ruth Pastry.'
