  text: "Many moons have passed since we last received a letter of complaint from\
    \ Dr Ruth Pastry, but she has at last been stirred into action. The following\
    \ email arrived the other day:\nDear Mr Key : I was disturbed to note, in your\
    \ item headed Petrochemical Shiver-Me-Timbers Conclave (20th December 2004), that\
    \ you unthinkingly preceded the word corsair with bloodthirsty. This is not only\
    \ a clich\xE9, but also panders to the stereotype of corsairs as violent maniacs\
    \ who careen around the decks of sailing ships off the Barbary Coast with gleaming\
    \ cutlasses clenched between their equally gleaming teeth. I have met many corsairs\
    \ in my time, and not one of them bears any resemblance to this nonsensical image.\
    \ Indeed, the corsair with whom I was best acquainted, in that he was my fianc\xE9\
    \ for a few months in the early 1970s, was a gentle soul named Federico Dellapiccola\
    \ de Grunwald, who spoke with a pronounced lisp and whose usual form of locomotion,\
    \ when he wasn't prancing, was to mince. I do not think he had ever been near\
    \ a cutlass in his life. Much of his time, whenever he was absent from his buccaneering\
    \ privateer ship, was spent raising rhododendrons and dahlias, holding raffles\
    \ in aid of the local orphanage, and gambolling o'er green fields with puppies\
    \ and flopsy-tailed bunny rabbits. Next time you write about corsairs, please\
    \ be more accurate. Yours fuming, Ruth Pastry."
