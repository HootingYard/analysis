  text: '"A beginning there must have been, though we can never hope to fix its point.
    Even speculation droops her wings in the attenuated atmosphere of a past so remote,
    and the light of imagination is quenched in the darkness of a history so ancient.
    In time, as in space, the confines of the universe must ever remain concealed
    from us, and of the end we know no more than of the beginning. Inconceivable as
    is to us the lapse of geological time, it is no more than ''a mere moment of the
    past, a mere infinitesimal portion of eternity''. Well may the human heart, that
    weeps and trembles, say, with Richter''s pilgrim through celestial space, ''I
    will go no farther; for the spirit of man acheth with this infinity. Insufferable
    is the glory of God. Let me lie down in the grave, and hide me from the persecution
    of the Infinite, for end, I see, there is none.''" -- Henry Alleyne Nicholson,
    The Ancient Life History Of The Earth'
