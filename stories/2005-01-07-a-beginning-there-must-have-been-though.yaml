  text: "\u201CA beginning there must have been, though we can never hope to fix its\
    \ point. Even speculation droops her wings in the attenuated atmosphere of a past\
    \ so remote, and the light of imagination is quenched in the darkness of a history\
    \ so ancient. In time, as in space, the confines of the universe must ever remain\
    \ concealed from us, and of the end we know no more than of the beginning. Inconceivable\
    \ as is to us the lapse of geological time, it is no more than \u2018a mere moment\
    \ of the past, a mere infinitesimal portion of eternity\u2019. Well may the human\
    \ heart, that weeps and trembles, say, with Richter's pilgrim through celestial\
    \ space, \u2018I will go no farther; for the spirit of man acheth with this infinity.\
    \ Insufferable is the glory of God. Let me lie down in the grave, and hide me\
    \ from the persecution of the Infinite, for end, I see, there is none.\u2019\u201D\
