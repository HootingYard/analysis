  text: "There are those who make fun of my continuing fascination with the Kennedy\
    \ assassination\u2014good afternoon, Pansy Cradledew\u2014as if that little pang\
    \ of excitement I get when I read the words grassy knoll or Umbrella Man or Agent\
    \ Hosty means I am some kind of bug-eyed conspiracy theorist of questionable personal\
    \ habits.\nActually I think it is the mountain of theories and documentation and\
    \ obsessive poring over minutiae that interests me, much as the similar activities\
    \ of, say, Loch Ness Monster hunters have an inherently attractive monomania.\
    \ Anyway, for those (and they are legion) who like this sort of thing, here is\
    \ a Kennedy Assassination Fact.\nIn November 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald's wife Marina,\
    \ and the two children, were staying in the house of Ruth Paine, a Quaker, in\
    \ the suburb of Irving. Oswald stayed in a Dallas rooming-house during the week\
    \ and joined them at weekends. He kept his Mannlicher Carcano rifle in Ruth Paine's\
    \ garage. Blah blah blah. The interesting fact is as follows. Ruth's husband Michael\
    \ Paine (who had moved out of the house for reasons unrelated to the Oswalds)\
    \ was the great-great-grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson and also a direct descendant\
    \ of one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, Robert Treat Paine.\n\
    I am really glad to know that smidgeon of information, useless as it is. Now you\
    \ know it too.\n\nSpookily linked by fate : Ralph Waldo Emerson, Marina Oswald,\
    \ FBI Agent James Hosty, Robert Treat Paine and Umbrella Man."
