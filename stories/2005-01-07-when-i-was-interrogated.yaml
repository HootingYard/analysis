  text: "I don't remember much about my interrogation, but under the new Freedom of\
    \ Information Act I managed to get hold of a cassette tape. For the best part\
    \ of half an hour it's a mishmash of hisses, squeaks, mufflement and what sounds\
    \ like a water vole gnawing on a wet twig. One part of my interrogation has survived,\
    \ however, and I have taken the trouble to transcribe it for you, so you may study\
    \ it with care.\nQ\u2014When was the last time you stood in the middle of a suspension\
    \ bridge in a high wind, emptying your lungs and belting out the Uruguayan national\
    \ anthem at the top of your voice?\nA\u2014Last Thursday.\nQ\u2014Were you accompanied\
    \ on piccolo by Von Straubenzee and on cor anglais by Tack?\nA\u2014I was.\nQ\u2014\
    Are you aware that Tack is wanted by the police of four continents for doing weird\
    \ things with the pips of citrus fruits?\nA\u2014I am not.\nQ\u2014Or that Von\
    \ Straubenzee is not Von Straubenzee's real name?\nA\u2014I was not aware of that.\n\
    Q\u2014Do not be curt.\nA\u2014I am not being curt.\nQ\u2014We shall be the judges\
    \ of your curtness. What is that noise in your pocket?\nA\u2014That is my water\
    \ vole gnawing a wet twig it eked from the riverbank just before I was placed\
    \ under arrest.\nQ\u2014Did Constable Fang tell you you could bring a water vole\
    \ to the top secret interrogation centre?\nA\u2014He didn't say one way or the\
    \ other.\nQ\u2014That will be all. We will call you back after several ukases\
    \ have been issued.\nI kept a close eye on the papers for the next few days, waiting\
    \ for the ukases to be issued, but they never were, nor was I ever dragged back\
    \ to the top secret interrogation centre. Tack vanished without trace, but a month\
    \ or so later I ran into Von Straubenzee outside the Palace of Churns. I asked\
    \ him if it was true that his real name was not Von Straubenzee.\n\u201CVan,\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CVan\u201D.\nHe was of a delicate constitution, so I didn't press\
    \ him further. Many years later, his sister told me that it was very important\
    \ to him that his surname and his blood group were \u201Cin alignment\u201D, as\
    \ she put it. He was a great piccolo player, and so was his sister. But my singing\
    \ voice is not what it was, and I no longer sing. I just stand on the windswept\
    \ suspension bridge and remember, with a lump in my throat, and another water\
    \ vole in my pocket, gnawing on another wet twig."
