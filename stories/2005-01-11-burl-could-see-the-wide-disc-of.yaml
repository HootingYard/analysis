  text: '"Burl could see the wide disc of the Sun now. A few spots were visible on
    its blazing surface, and great tongues of burning gases encircled it for hundreds
    of thousands of miles. Were they really destined to end a mere cinder--an instantaneous
    flicker of fire in one of those prominences? Clyde was working with Oberfield
    at the calculators. Burl watched them in silence, trying to determine what it
    was they were getting at. Finally they pulled a figure from one of their machines
    and took it over to Lockhart and the engineers. There was a brief conference,
    and something seemed to be agreed upon. Clyde''s face, which had been tense, was
    now more relaxed. ''I think we''ve got the problem licked,'' came the good word."
