  text: "\u201CBurl could see the wide disc of the Sun now. A few spots were visible\
    \ on its blazing surface, and great tongues of burning gases encircled it for\
    \ hundreds of thousands of miles. Were they really destined to end a mere cinder\u2014\
    an instantaneous flicker of fire in one of those prominences? Clyde was working\
    \ with Oberfield at the calculators. Burl watched them in silence, trying to determine\
    \ what it was they were getting at. Finally they pulled a figure from one of their\
    \ machines and took it over to Lockhart and the engineers. There was a brief conference,\
    \ and something seemed to be agreed upon. Clyde's face, which had been tense,\
    \ was now more relaxed. 'I think we've got the problem licked,' came the good\
    \ word.\u201D \u2014 Donald A Wollheim, The Secret Of The Ninth Planet"
