  text: 'Consider that fall. One day, you are spry, preening and spruce. Then, knocked
    sideways, cast down, become rusty and squalid. How does it happen? Is there a
    moment, a split second, when jauntiness turns to sackcloth and ashes? What would
    your journal read? Eleven a.m.: o! such bliss and splendour! How blessed am I
    to be among the animate and quick. Eleven o one a.m.: Ach! Does earth harbour
    a wretch as miserable as I, one who crumbles in despair and is fit only to slither
    in the muck with the worms? How are we to make sense of such a catastrophic change?
    Crystal balls may help seers and soothsayers see into the future, but is it true,
    as some say, that we can make sense of the present by staring long and intently
    with our eyes wide open at the surface of a muddy pond over by Bodger''s Spinney?
    And not any of the ponds there, just one, the most brackish of the ponds, the
    one which is inky black and fathomless. What will we see on the surface of that
    pond if we stare at it long enough? I will tell you. Ignore the flies and mosquitoes
    and the mutant tadpoles that occasionally disturb the water, and sooner or later,
    you will be able to discern, dimly at first, but with increasing clarity, the
    incredible face of the Psychopond Dweller, shimmering, gaunt, bewitched and bewitching,
    and its expression will reveal to you the meaning of neither past nor future but
    of the present moment, radical, decisive and, like the cockles and mussels in
    the old song, alive, alive-oh.'
