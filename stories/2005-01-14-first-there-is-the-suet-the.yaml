  text: "\u201CFirst, there is the suet\u2014the fat of the ox\u2014Russian tallow,\
    \ I believe, employed in the manufacture of these dips, which Gay-Lussac, or some\
    \ one who intrusted him with his knowledge, converted into that beautiful substance,\
    \ stearin, which you see lying beside it. A candle, you know, is not now a greasy\
    \ thing like an ordinary tallow candle, but a clean thing, and you may almost\
    \ scrape off and pulverize the drops which fall from it without soiling any thing.\u201D\
