  text: 'Geb. Hapi. Anubis. Khnum. Ra. These are gods. They are not toys or trinkets,
    plastic figurines or dolls made out of scraps of wool or straw. They are gods.
    Maat. Aten. Sekhmet. Hathor. Horus. These too are gods. Mighty, imperious gods.
    Geb is the Great Cackler, Hapi the Father of the Gods, Anubis the Jackal, Khnum
    the Lord of the Cool Waters, Ra the Sun God, Maat the Goddess of Truth, Aten the
    Lord of All, Sekhmet the Mighty One, Hathor the Mistress of Heaven and Horus He
    Who Is Above. Bow down before them for they are powerful deities. While you cower
    in your ditch, grovelling, they bestride the heavens. Not toys, I say, but gods.
    Ammut. Isis. Bastet. Nut. Ptah. The devourer, the throne, the tearer, the sky,
    the opener. Above you the sky is black and fat with stars, for it is night, illimitable
    and desolate, and you are an uncomprehending mite alone on a burning planet, sprawling
    in your ditch. They are gods. Aker. Khepri. Sobek. Taurt. Seshat. Seth. Big, towering,
    potent gods and goddesses. Aker the Double Lion God. Khepri He who comes into
    existence. Sobek He who causes fertility. Taurt the Great Lady. Seshat, ah Seshat,
    the Lady of the Library, and Seth the Lord of Upper Egypt. These are the gods.
    You are not in Upper Egypt, nor in Lower Egypt. You are not in Egypt at all. But
    wherever your ditch is, in this night as hard as iron, you abase yourself before
    these gods, because you must. The time for toys and trinkets, for the bauble and
    the gewgaw, is long past, and you have left all fripperies behind you. Now there
    is simply you and your gods, locked together, in the face of the stark blank sky.
    Min. Mut. Osiris. Amun. Nephthys. Neith. The Chief of Heaven, the Lady of Heaven,
    the King of the Dead, the Hidden One, the Lady of the House and the Great Goddess.
    Bow down, bow down. You have a forelock. It is there to be tugged, so tug it.
    Tug it in obeisance to Thoth, the Great Measurer. And to Ra, to Ra, to Ra!


    Now plant your brow in the muck on the floor of the ditch and cast your mind back
    to that golden happy childhood when you plashed in the paddling pool on a sun-blazed
    summer''s day. The water was cool and delightful, the water in your paddling pool.
    Did you rush home wrapped in your big yellow towel and worship Khnum? Did you
    thank Khnum for the coolness of the water? Dried and cooled, did you clutch your
    library ticket in your tiny hand and scamper excitedly to the public lending library
    to borrow a book of fairy stories? You would have looked for something with pictures
    of elves and wizards and peris and hobgoblins, and found a compendium, perhaps,
    carried it on tippytoe to the issuing desk bathed in the glorious sunshine streaming
    through those enormous library windows, had it stamped, and borne your borrowed
    book away, out onto the path in the bright afternoon. When you got home, safe
    in your bedroom strewn with pillows and cushions and patchwork quilts and throws,
    did you cry out in gratitude to Seshat?


    Mut. Nut. Horus. Seth. Anubis. These are gods. All-powerful and eternal. I can
    picture you, a few summers later, older but no wiser, traipsing around in the
    park at lunchtime. You have a bag of breadcrumbs and you intend to cast them upon
    the grass as food for sparrows and magpies and starlings, for linnets and ravens,
    for bufflehead ducks and grebes. Sitting on the rusty bench with its rusty plaque
    in memory of one long dead who sat here often and adored the view, the view of
    rooftops and chimneys and football fields and allotments, of tennis courts and
    orchards rich in cherry trees, I see you casting your crumbs to the birds, and
    I know that you are not giving thanks to Aten or Geb or Sekhmet or Ptah. No. Still
    at this time, despite your riches and your bravura, your poor head is filled with
    visions of Itzpapalotl, Coatlicue, Temazcalteci, Tlaloc, Mayahual, Cihuateto,
    Huixtocihuatl, Popocatepetl and the like, for these are your gods. In the grip
    of your delusions, it is perhaps not coincidental that you like to sport a yellow
    polo neck sweater like the one worn by Christopher Lee in The Wicker Man, and
    even have your hair cut in a similar mop, though you are not yet going grey, and
    you insist that you have not seen the film, for you profess a devotion to the
    silent screen. In your pantheon, Abel Gance rubs shoulders with Oxomoco, Lilian
    Gish with Quetzalcoatl. You have seen Broken Blossoms more than a dozen times,
    and sometimes you like to pace the back streets of Limehouse as if in search of
    the opium dens that are no longer there, the dens from which Sherlock Holmes emerged
    twitching and shattered in The Man With The Twisted Lip. Those fog-enshrouded
    days are as distant now as the bright summers of your paddling pool youth, yet
    you cling to your false gods as you feed the birds and ducks in the park, shaded
    from Nut''s glittering sky by the overhanging branches of sycamores and hazel
    trees, on the bench by the magnificent iron railings which were replaced after
    the war in which you were wounded thrice. You were shot in the stomach, burned
    by flaming barrels, and crushed by falling masonry, but now there is not a scratch
    on you, and you have forgotten that terrible day in Scheveningen. You were treated
    well in the field hospital, but what did you do, once you could again use your
    hands? You scavenged scraps of wood and built a little toy altar and put it on
    your bedside shelf, praying to Ixtlilton, your god of healing, for having saved
    you from the realm of Mictlantecuhtle.


    So let us spring forward again now, another ten, twenty years, and now your hair
    is grey, but no longer cut a la Lord Summerisle in The Wicker Man. Your yellow
    polo neck is threadbare now, and you use it as a dust-cloth. There is much dust
    in your home, for the air is never still there. Draughts curl in under the doors
    and around the window frames, for much of the wood is rotting away under sustained
    attack by weevils and woodworms, microscopic forms of life you have ignored for
    too long. Baleful, greasy, plump, a little cracked, you shuffle from room to room,
    pointlessly, as if you have been kennelled. All your money is gone, exhausted
    by your postwar debaucheries. You have a blighted reputation and constant pins
    and needles. That is what accounts for your restlessness, this shuffling from
    bedroom to pantry to parlour to outhouse, from attic to cellar, and back again,
    up and down and round and round and always with your liver-spotted fist clamped
    around a little tin medallion of Montezuma as if that might fend off the night,
    the darkness, the vastness of eternity. You have a kitten, but it hates you. You
    have not yet been subjugated by Bastet, but that time is drawing nigh. So you
    call your kitten Karen Carpenter and feed it with fish that you pluck from ponds,
    or with eels you thieve from the back-kitchens of canteens, and your kitten hisses
    at you and claws you and loathes the sight of you. You are fearful of the light
    in those green eyes, for you rightly sense that they see into your soul, your
    small and puny soul, all curdled by a life of waste and delusion that Centeotl
    would bring you corn, that Chantico would warm your hearth, that the wind cried
    Ehecatl. The gods are in readiness for you and the wind is cold.


    Yes, it is night now, and you are in your ditch. The wind is cold and the sky
    is black and there are no birds, not even crows. Your kitten tore that pitiful
    tin medallion from your hand and dropped it down a well. You are alone, but for
    the gods. Geb. Hapi. Anubis. Khnum. Ra. You have sunk to your knees. That blurred
    black and white image of Lilian Gish, stricken by panic in The Wind, is fading
    fast. Like Sherlock Holmes, you too are twitching and shattered, but no opiates
    brought you to this. Maat. Aten. Sekhmet. Hathor. Horus. There is no longer any
    traffic, no car horns, no rattling carts, no clanking steamer plying across the
    strait. Despite your wealth, you never did fly in an aeroplane across oceans and
    continents. You never did go and live in that house on stilts that you pictured
    in your mind''s eye when you were young. Parks and ponds were your domain, parks
    and ponds. And now this ditch, a trickle of foul brackish water running through
    it. You cup some in your hands and splash it on your burning brow but it is not
    the cool water from the paddling pool given to you by Khnum all those years ago.
    Ammut. Isis. Bastet. Nut. Ptah. Aker. Khepri. Sobek. Taurt. Seshat. Seth. There
    came that day, that Thursday, when your nerves were so brittle and the pins and
    needles became too much, and you flung your Montezuma medallion across the pantry
    and cursed your gods, and the kitten crept up to you and fixed its green eyes
    on you. You retrieved your tin gewgaw and fled to the park to watch the grebes,
    but you were shaken. You have not been still since then, you are like the gusts
    of air swirling around your house, the house you lived in then. Min. Mut. Osiris.
    Amun. Nephthys. Neith. These are the gods. And Ra. And Anubis. And Thoth, the
    Great Measurer, Thoth who is ready to take your measure now. Be still. Be measured.
    Be still.
