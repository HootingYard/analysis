  text: "It was a sweltering day, and I had spent a profitable hour or two rummaging\
    \ in the market square at Coctlosh. My haversack was filled with purchases, including\
    \ aniseed and bleach and curd, a dark enticing flap, gewgaws, a hat, iced and\
    \ jellied kiwi fruit lozenges, mayonnaise and more items from the first half of\
    \ the alphabet. Making my way home along the lane that runs from Coctlosh to Pointy\
    \ Town, I passed again the bench where that morning I had encountered the Victorian\
    \ Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. I told you about that meeting on Tuesday\
    \ 7th December last year.\nFather Hopkins was no longer sitting on the bench.\
    \ His place had been taken by a bespectacled chap with a high forehead. At a glance,\
    \ I took him to be a man of powerful intellect.\n\u201CGood afternoon,\u201D I\
    \ said jauntily, tipping my hat.\n\u201CCat's foot iron claw. Neurosurgeons scream\
    \ for more at paranoia's poison door,\u201D he shouted.\n\u201CI beg your pardon?\u201D\
    \ I asked, disconcerted.\n\u201CTwenty-first century schizoid man!\u201D he bellowed.\n\
    To my great excitement, it dawned on me that I was talking to cerebral pop god\
    \ Robert Fripp. I had not been mistaken when I judged my interlocutor to be a\
    \ man of great intellectual accomplishment.\n\u201CI am thrilled to meet you,\u201D\
    \ I babbled, \u201CFor you are the man who managed to have an electric guitar\
    \ technique named Frippertronics after you, even though others had developed it\
    \ and used it long before. That shows chutzpah!\u201D\n\u201CBlood rack barbed\
    \ wire,\u201D he replied, \u201CPoliticians' funeral pyre. Innocents raped with\
    \ napalm fire. Twenty-first century schizoid man.\u201D\nI tossed him a plum as\
    \ I pondered the deep significance of his words. I treasured this moment. How\
    \ rarely we find ourselves in the presence of genius, rarer still to meet genius,\
    \ chutzpah, round spectacles and pop immortality commingled in one man. I was\
    \ hanging on his every word.\n\u201CDeath seed blind man's greed,\u201D he roared.\
    \ I hastily scribbled it down in my notebook.\n\u201CPoets' starving children\
    \ bleed,\u201D he continued, as I gazed at him, awestruck. The afternoon sun glistened\
    \ on his spectacle lenses and shiny high forehead.\n\u201CNothing he's got he\
    \ really needs. Twenty-first century schizoid man,\u201D he growled, and with\
    \ that he jumped up from the bench and hared off down the lane. Sadly, he had\
    \ ignored my gift of a plum, but I did not let that spoil my glow of contentment.\
    \ I walked briskly home to listen to my much-treasured CD of Toyah Wilcox's Greatest\
    \ Hits."
