  text: "A couple of days ago we noted, as we do, the feast day of Saint Mungo. You\
    \ ought to know that Saint Mungo's mother, Tenew, was thrown from the top of Traprain\
    \ Law, a large hill outside Edinburgh, by her father Loth. Because she survived\
    \ the plunge, it was thought she was a witch, so she was cast adrift in a coracle.\
    \ Fetching up at Saint Serf's religious establishment on Culross, she gave birth\
    \ to Mungo on the beach. This happened in the sixth century.\n\nMungo had a bell.\
    \ He is a very important saint to robins. Saint Serf had a pet robin which was\
    \ slaughtered by Mungo's jealous classmates, who hoped to pin the blame on him.\
    \ But Mungo restored the bird to life. Later on, he swapped his pastoral stave\
    \ with Saint Columba.\nThere is a special mass for Saint Mungo, dating from the\
    \ thirteenth century, which has been printed by the Bollandists. The Bollandists\
    \ are an association of ecclesiastical scholars engaged in editing the Acta Sanctorum,\
    \ a great hagiographical collection begun during the first years of the seventeenth\
    \ century, and continued to our own day. The work was conceived by Heribert Rosweyde\
    \ (1569-1629). Under the title Fasti sanctorum quorum vitae in belgicis bibliothecis\
    \ manuscriptiae, he gave in a little volume, published by the Plantin press at\
    \ Antwerp, an alphabetical list of the names of the saints whose acts had been\
    \ either found by him or called to his attention in old manuscript collections.\
    \ This list filled fifty pages; the prefatory notice in which he indicates the\
    \ character and arrangement of his work takes up fourteen. Finally, the work contains\
    \ an appendix of twenty-six pages containing the unpublished acts of the passion\
    \ of the holy Cilician martyrs, Tharsacus, Probus, and Andronicus, but not Mungo,\
    \ who was not, in any case, a holy Cilician martyr.\nRosweyde planned supplementary\
    \ volumes which would include the authors of the lives, the sufferings of the\
    \ martyrs, the images of the saints, liturgical rites and customs mentioned in\
    \ hagiographical documents, profane customs to which allusions had been made,\
    \ questions of chronology, names of places encountered in these same documents,\
    \ barbarous or obscure terms which might puzzle the readers, and tables showing\
    \ the names of the saints whose lives had been published in the preceding volumes,\
    \ the same names followed by notes indicating the place of the saint's birth,\
    \ his station in life, his title to sanctity, the time and place in which he had\
    \ lived, and the author of his life, the state of life of the various saints (religious,\
    \ priest, virgin, widow, etc.), their position in the Church (apostle, bishop,\
    \ abbot, etc.), the nomenclature of the saints according to the countries made\
    \ illustrious by their birth, apostolate, sojourn, burial, nomenclature of the\
    \ places in which they are honoured with a special cult, enumeration of the maladies\
    \ for the cure of which they are especially invoked, the professions placed under\
    \ their patronage, the proper names of persons and places encountered in the published\
    \ lives, the passages of Holy Scripture there explained, points which may be of\
    \ use in religious controversies, those applicable in the teaching of Christian\
    \ doctrine, a general table of words and things in alphabetical order, \u201C\
    and others still,\u201D added the author, \u201Cif anything of importance presents\
    \ itself, of which our readers may give us an idea\u201D.\nThis is such an important\
    \ topic that we shall return to it at a later date. Meanwhile, you can commit\
    \ to memory the little rhyme associated with Saint Mungo:\n\nThe tree that never\
    \ grew, The bird that never flew, The fish that never swam, The bell that never\
    \ rang."
