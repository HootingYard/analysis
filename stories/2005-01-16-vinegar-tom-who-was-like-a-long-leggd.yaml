    Oxe, with a long taile and broad eyes, who when this discoverer spoke to, and
    bade him goe to the place provided for him and his Angels, immediately transformed
    himselfe into the shape of a child of foure yeeres old without a head, and gave
    halfe a dozen turnes about the house, and vanished at the doore." -- Matthew Hopkins,
