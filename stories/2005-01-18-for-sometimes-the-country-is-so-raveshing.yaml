  text: '"For sometimes the Country is so raveshing and delightful that twill raise
    Wit and Spirit even in the dullest Clod, And in truth, amongst so many heats of
    Lust and Ambition which usually fire our Citys, I cannot see what retreat, what
    comfort is left for a chast and sober Muse." -- Rene Rapin, De Carmine Pastorali'
