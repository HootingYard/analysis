  text: "I am not averse to pageantry, so when a parade came past my door last Friday\
    \ I went to my window to watch. Although the pane of glass in my window is besmirched\
    \ by grease, I had a splendid view. I saw a yellow brougham, three green pantechnicons,\
    \ a brown cabriolet, at least a dozen crimson charabancs, a pair of white phaetons,\
    \ and a blue chariot, each with its flags and bunting and streamers and ribbons,\
    \ some with hooters and klaxons making a terrible din, and they were followed\
    \ by countless wagons and floats and cars, gigs, coaches, brakes, droshkys, jalopies\
    \ and landaus, jeeps, bogies and coup\xE9s, drays, palanquins and flivvers, so\
    \ many that before I knew it hours had passed, and it was dusk, and there seemed\
    \ to be no end to the parade.\nI was beginning to wonder how I would be able to\
    \ cross the street. I wanted to go to the tobacconists' to pick up a twist of\
    \ nap and a plug of slot, but the succession of carriages, decorative snowploughs,\
    \ unicycles and troikas showed no sign of abating. The crowd that had gathered\
    \ to cheer and throw hats in the air and dance impromptu polkas was thicker than\
    \ it had been all day. One mountebank had set up his stall close to my front gate\
    \ and was attracting custom with whoops and whistles.\nI decided to risk crossing\
    \ the road, thinking I could weave my way through the parade. I put on my hat\
    \ and stepped out of the door, and was at once caught up in a surging mob of revellers\
    \ and borne aloft like some sort of mascot. They ignored my tremulous whimpers\
    \ of protest, but eventually dumped me on the kerb about a mile down the road\
    \ from my house, and here the pageantry, and crowds, were if anything more boisterous,\
    \ colourful and noisy than ever.\n\u201CWhat is this all in aid of?\u201D I shouted\
    \ at a black-clad widow-woman who was selling bundles of strange herbs from a\
    \ barrow. She was reluctant to answer me until I had forked out a handful of cash\
    \ for a sprig of irkbane.\n\u201CA potentate from a far distant land is visiting\
    \ our town,\u201D she told me, \u201Cand the council wanted to make him welcome.\
    \ He is a terrible tyrant, and he has been known to kill a horse just by uttering\
    \ its name. His palace is bigger than the tallest mountain, and is built from\
    \ the bones of enemies he has slain in combat. But they say that in his bailiwick\
    \ sheep may safely graze.\u201D\nThe crone continued to speak, but she was drowned\
    \ out by a band of pipers on the back of a passing flatbed truck. I stuffed cotton\
    \ wool into my ears. An urchin pressed a pennant into my hand and I found myself\
    \ waving it unthinkingly. Night had fallen now, but the town was bright with flares\
    \ and gas and calcium night lights. I stood at the roadside, hemmed in by carousing\
    \ crowds, and watched the passing parade.\nSomewhere bells were clanging. A mile\
    \ away, in the dark dark woods, owls swooped on field mice, badgers grubbed for\
    \ worms, and insects glowed. A mile further on, the potentate's assassin tied\
    \ a bandanna around his head, lit a cigarillo, shouldered his rifle and began\
    \ his heavy deliberate trudge across the marshes towards the town."
