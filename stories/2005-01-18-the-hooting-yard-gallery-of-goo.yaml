  text: "Having read the above item, would you like to experience the world through\
    \ a film of ectoplasmic goo? One way to begin is to do as Minnie Harrison did.\
    \ She is shown here, in Middlesbrough in December 1948, creating her own extrusion\
    \ of ectoplasm.\n\nEctoplasm emanating from the Medium's mouth. Taken in complete\
    \ darkness using Kodak infra-red plate. Exposure by means of powerful \u2018Sashalight\u2019\
    \ bulb through \u2018Wratten\u2019 glass filter\u2014extremely deep ruby-red colour.\
    \ The Ectoplasm is emanating from her mouth and in this form it is quite transparent,\
    \ very similar in appearance and texture to chiffon. (From The Minnie Harrison\
    \ Page)."
