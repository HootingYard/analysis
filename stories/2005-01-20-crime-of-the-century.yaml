  text: "That beacon of common sense and moderation, the Reverend Ian Paisley, described\
    \ the recent \xA322 million bank robbery in Northern Ireland as \u201Cthe crime\
    \ of the century\u201D. Things bode well for the next ninety-five years, then.\n\
    His comment set me thinking about the crime of the century just gone, so I went\
    \ to Google to have a look. There were 65,800 results, but I was able to discount\
    \ the majority of these because they referred to songs by Shania Twain and Supertramp.\
    \ (On second thoughts\u2026 maybe those titles were accurately self-referential.)\
    \ Anyway, the usual suspects were predictably present\u2014JFK, the Lindbergh\
    \ baby kidnapping*, Leopold and Loeb, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and more recently\
    \ the so-called \u201Cwar on terror\u201D and the destruction of the rainforest\u2014\
    but I was more interested in the less celebrated misdeeds which had been described\
    \ as \u201Cthe crime of the century\u201D. These included:\nGovernment advice\
    \ that people should take mineral and vitamin supplements\nThe demolition of a\
    \ building in Missouri as part of the US Custom House & Post Office Project\n\
    An eight-inch crawdad deposited in someone's grandmother's rain barrel\nThe recent\
    \ Ukrainian elections. A Yanukovich supporter said of Yuschenko's \u201Ccoup\u201D\
    : \u201CThis is the crime of the century\u2014worse than Hitler, worse than Chernobyl.\
    \ This is a battle to Armageddon. It's a battle between the Antichrist and Christian\
    \ peoples. They are turning people into orange zombies\u2026 all of them have\
    \ abnormal sexual energy.\u201D\nTheft of an item of sporting memorabilia from\
    \ Geelong Football Club\nPublication of the Kinsey reports, Sexual Behaviour in\
    \ the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behaviour in the Human Female (1953). The perpetrator\
    \ of this crime of the century is denounced as the \u201Cpatriarch of perversion\u201D\
    \nSomething I don't quite understand about cold fusion theories, to wit: \u201C\
    The hot fusioneers have made a fundamental error in judgment. Because they are\
    \ so thoroughly skilled in gas plasma physics, where light-element fusion can\
    \ and does occur, they have expected that any fusion in an electrochemical cell,\
    \ on or near the surface of a metal lattice, must be similar to fusion in a gas\
    \ plasma. The only way these scientists could have been more seriously in error\
    \ would be to condemn the discovery of cold fusion, which some did!\u201D\nThe\
    \ proposed sale of the KPFA radio station by its parent company, the Pacifica\
    \ Foundation\nThe theft, from a photo shoot in the South of France, of an advance\
    \ copy of an album by a pop group called U2.\n\nLeft : Charles Lindbergh. Right\
    \ : a middle-aged man known as \u201CThe Edge\u201D, or possibly \u201CThe Hedge\u201D\
    . Has some connection with U2.\n*NOTE : It should be well-known by now that eerie\
    \ fascist Charles Lindbergh accidentally killed his child during a prank. Go to\
    \ The Lindbergh Kidnapping Hoax for the full details. You may find it helpful\
    \ to wear dark glasses when visiting the site."
