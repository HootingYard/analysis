  text: '"Have you ever seen a bagpiper, I wonder? A man who carries under his arm
    a kind of large dark brown bag, which he fills with air by blowing into it, and
    out of which he presently forces the same air into a musical pipe by pressing
    it gently with his elbow. If you never saw such a thing, it is a pity... that
    large bag, which is the principal part of the instrument, gives you a very exact
    idea of your stomach; for in fact it really and truly is a stomach itself, and
    moreover, the stomach of an animal whose interior formation resembles yours very,
    very much. And who do you suppose is this audacious animal, which presumes to
    have an inside so like that of a pretty little girl? Really, I am half ashamed
    to name him, for fear you should be angry with me for doing so. It is--it is the
    pig!" -- Jean Mace, The History Of A Mouthful Of Bread'
