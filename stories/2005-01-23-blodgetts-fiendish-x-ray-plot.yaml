  text: 'Some say Blodgett conceived his fiendish X-ray plot as revenge against a
    world that laughed at him because he was a short man, but they are wrong. Blodgett
    was not of diminutive stature. He was actually somewhere between six and seven
    feet tall, although it is hard to be precise because he was resistant to tape
    measures. They would become knotted or twisted or indeed simply burst into inexplicable
    flames when Blodgett was near. At a snap of his fingers, similar devices, such
    as rulers or yardsticks, would crumble to sawdust, if they were wooden, or just
    dust, if made of some other substance. Remember that Blodgett was a frightening,
    frightening man.

    He conceived his fiendish X-ray plot on a wild and windy Thursday just a week
    after Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered X-rays accidentally while studying cathode
    rays in a high-voltage gaseous-discharge tube. Despite the fact that the tube
    was encased in a black cardboard box, Roentgen noticed that a barium platinocyanide
    screen, placed nearby by chance, emitted fluorescent light whenever the tube was
    in operation. Hearing the news on some sort of criminal grapevine, Blodgett immediately
    obtained a high-voltage gaseous-discharge tube and a barium platinocyanide screen.
    He sent his minions fanning out around town to steal a black cardboard box, and
    this led to his undoing.

    A dishevelled plain clothes police officer, a protege of Chief Inspector Cargpan,
    apprehended one of Blodgett''s forty thieves trundling a stolen black cardboard
    box down a noisome alleyway in the small hours of the morning. The box was not
    empty. It contained a tangle of enraged and venomous vipers*. The game was up.

    Sometimes, when writing about failed criminal enterprises, one is tempted to embroider
    the bare facts in the interests of entertainment. Here, I am content to let the
    facts speak for themselves. They may not speak eloquently, but they speak, and
    that is enough, one hundred and ten years after the foiling of Blodgett''s fiendish
    X-ray plot.

    *NOTE : Tautology. All vipers possess envenomed fangs, apparently.


    A copperhead pit viper. Imagine lots of these in a stolen black cardboard box.'
