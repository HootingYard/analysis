  text: "Following our heartfelt homage to King Crimson maestro and \xFCber-cranium\
    \ Robert Fripp (see below, 16th January), my old mucker Max D\xE9charn\xE9 writes\
    \ with exciting news:\n\u201CThought you might enjoy this link to the barking\
    \ mad website of Fripp's sister, who seems to be a Californian motivational business\
    \ speaker. Nice to see the relatives of famous people playing down their connections\
    \ and being all modest. Dig them Frippicisms, dad!\u201D\nThanks, Max. Visit the\
    \ site and you too can be the lucky purchaser of a six-CD set (yes, six) of Mr\
    \ Toyah Wilcox speaking for hours and hours. \u201CIntimate conversations with\
    \ Robert Fripp produced by Patricia Fripp\u201D, we are told, \u201CFor the first\
    \ time ever\u2026 experience the private side of Robert Fripp. Hear him be profound,\
    \ poignant and up-close-and-personal. When Patricia Fripp is not promoting her\
    \ brother she is building leaders, transforming sales teams and working as a speech\
    \ coach to executives.\u201D I wonder if her motivational techniques include forcing\
    \ the gullible saps to listen to Larks' Tongues In Aspic?"
