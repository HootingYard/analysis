  text: 'Following our heartfelt homage to King Crimson maestro and uber-cranium Robert
    Fripp (see below, 16th January), my old mucker Max Decharne writes with exciting
    news:

    "Thought you might enjoy this link to the barking mad website of Fripp''s sister,
    who seems to be a Californian motivational business speaker. Nice to see the relatives
    of famous people playing down their connections and being all modest. Dig them
    Frippicisms, dad!"

    Thanks, Max. Visit the site and you too can be the lucky purchaser of a six-CD
    set (yes, six) of Mr Toyah Wilcox speaking for hours and hours. "Intimate conversations
    with Robert Fripp produced by Patricia Fripp", we are told, "For the first time
    ever... experience the private side of Robert Fripp. Hear him be profound, poignant
    and up-close-and-personal. When Patricia Fripp is not promoting her brother she
    is building leaders, transforming sales teams and working as a speech coach to
    executives." I wonder if her motivational techniques include forcing the gullible
    saps to listen to Larks'' Tongues In Aspic?'
