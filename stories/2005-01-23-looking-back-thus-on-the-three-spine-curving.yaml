  text: "\u201CLooking back thus on the three spine-curving, chest-cramping, foot-twinging,\
    \ ether-scented years of her hospital training, it dawned on the White Linen Nurse\
    \ very suddenly that nothing of her ever had felt permanently incapacitated except\
    \ her noble expression! Impulsively she sprang for the prim white mirror that\
    \ capped her prim white bureau and stood staring up into her own entrancing, bright-colored\
    \ Nova Scotian reflection with tense and unwonted interest. Except for the unmistakable\
    \ smirk which fatigue had clawed into her plastic young mouth-lines there was\
    \ certainly nothing special the matter with what she saw.\u201D \u2014 Eleanor\
    \ Hallowell Abbott, The White Linen Nurse"
