  text: '"Looking back thus on the three spine-curving, chest-cramping, foot-twinging,
    ether-scented years of her hospital training, it dawned on the White Linen Nurse

    her noble expression! Impulsively she sprang for the prim white mirror that capped
    her prim white bureau and stood staring up into her own entrancing, bright-colored
    Nova Scotian reflection with tense and unwonted interest. Except for the unmistakable
    smirk which fatigue had clawed into her plastic young mouth-lines there was certainly
    nothing special the matter with what she saw." -- Eleanor Hallowell Abbott, The
