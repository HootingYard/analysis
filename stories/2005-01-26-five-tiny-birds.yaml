  text: 'Look, look! Here are five tiny birds!


    That was a tiny bobolink, I am sure of it. I know a bobolink when I see one, which
    is not often, admittedly, as I live in a hermit''s cave, though I am not a hermit
    by inclination. I am garrulous.


    And that looks like a tiny pyrrhula, Stalin''s favourite bird, according to The
    Fat Compendium Of Spurious Bird-Related Facts About The Soviet Union, my father''s
    favourite book. My father was garrulous too, and no one ever asked him to live
    in a cave. He lived above a shop that sold prosthetic limbs. Here comes another
    tiny bird!


    It is a tiny scarlet tanager. Now that is a bird I have never heard of before.


    Gosh! Hot on its heels comes a tiny painted bunting, not that birds have heels
    as such. They have claws and talons or very thin little twig-like feet. Some say
    that long, long ago human beings began to write by copying the tracks made by
    the feet of birds in snow or mud. There is one more tiny bird to come. I think
    it will be a tiny harlequin duck, I can feel it in my water.


    Oops! I was wrong! It is a tiny mute swan. And now I too will become mute, for
    it is breakfast time, time for a bowl of roots and chaff, and I must concentrate
    on the effective working of my digestive juices.'
