  text: 'That indefatigable crone Mrs Gubbins has announced the launch of a brand
    new, subscription-only magazine. Here she is, to tell us all about it:

    Hello readers. It was a dark and stormy night, just like in that novel by Edward
    Bulwer-Lytton, and I was lying awake in bed, tossing and turning under my counterpane,
    watching little fairies twinkling over by my washstand, when I had one of my bright
    ideas. Actually the fairies may have been moths. Anyway, all of a sudden I realised
    that there would be a huge market for a glossy magazine, with a spine, probably,
    devoted to velcro, dubbin and crayons. I jumped out of bed, a bit creakily, and
    went over to my escritoire, rummaged for my lorgnette, found a pad and pencil,
    and scribbled down my ideas in the dark, because my little lamp is broken and
    I was too excited to go all the way across the room to turn on the main light.

    I decided to call my magazine A Daily Digest About Velcro, Dubbin And Crayons
    By Bathsheba Gubbins (Mrs). That has a nice ring to it, don''t you think? In the
    first issue I thought I would tell my thousands of subscribers the story of how
    George de Mestral invented velcro in 1948 after taking his dog for a walk. "I
    will design a unique, two-sided fastener," he decided, "one side with stiff hooks
    like burrs and the other side with soft loops like the fabric of my pants. I will
    call my invention velcro--a combination of the words velour and crochet. It will
    rival the zipper in its ability to fasten." That would take up a few pages.

    Then I would have a picture spread about dubbin, a combination of oils, beeswax
    and other waxes, hence the pleasant smell when opening the can. I would have to
    make a few telephone calls come morning to see if I could include a little scratch-and-sniff
    panel on page 14.

    The remainder of issue one would be an exciting article all about crayons, including
    the fact that Alice Binney came up with the brand name Crayola by combining two
    words that mean "oily chalk". Craie, in French, means chalk, and oleaginous means
    oily.

    By the time I had planned out the first issue the storminess had ceased and the
    night was still, but before going back to bed to have a good long snooze, I made
    a quick note about what should go on the cover. I decided that each issue should
    have a full-colour cover-picture of a celebrity, if possible shown holding or
    using or maybe just ruminating upon velcro, dubbin, or crayons. Who could it be
    for the launch issue? It would have to be a toss-up between new US Secretary of
    State Condoleezza Rice and Glenn Cornick, one-time bass guitarist of Jethro Tull.

    I scrambled back to bed happy in the knowledge that subscriptions would come pouring
    in.
