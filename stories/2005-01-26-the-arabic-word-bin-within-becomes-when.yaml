  text: "\u201CThe Arabic word \u2018bin\u2019, within, becomes, when it means interval,\
    \ space, \u2018binnon\u2019; this is the German and Dutch \u2018binnen\u2019 and\
    \ Saxon \u2018binnon\u2019, signifying within. The Ethiopian word \u2018aorf\u2019\
    , to fall asleep, is the root of the word \u2018Morpheus\u2019, the god of sleep.\
    \ The Hebrew word \u2018chanah\u2019, to dwell, is the parent of the Anglo-Saxon\
    \ \u2018inne\u2019 and Icelandic \u2018inni\u2019, a house, and of our word \u2018\
    inn\u2019, a hotel. The Hebrew word \u2018naval\u2019 or \u2018nafal\u2019 signifies\
    \ to fall; from it is derived our word fall and fool (one who falls); the Chaldee\
    \ word is \u2018nabal\u2019, to make foul, and the Arabic word \u2018nabala\u2019\
    \ means to die, that is, to fall. From the last syllable of the Chaldee \u2018\
    nasar\u2019, to saw, we can derive the Latin \u2018serra\u2019, the High German\
    \ \u2018sagen\u2019, the Danish \u2018sauga\u2019, and our word \u2018to saw\u2019\
    . The Arabic \u2018nafida\u2019, to fade, is the same as the Italian \u2018fado\u2019\
    , the Latin \u2018fatuus\u2019 (foolish, tasteless), the Dutch \u2018vadden\u2019\
    , and our \u2018to fade\u2019. The Ethiopic word \u2018gaber\u2019, to make, to\
    \ do, and the Arabic word \u2018jabara\u2019, to make strong, becomes the Welsh\
    \ word \u2018goberu\u2019, to work, to operate, the Latin \u2018operor\u2019,\
    \ and the English \u2018operate\u2019. The Arabic word \u2018abara\u2019 signifies\
    \ to prick, to sting; we see this root in the Welsh \u2018bar\u2019, a summit,\
    \ and \u2018p\xE2r\u2019, a spear, and \u2018per\u2019, a spit; whence our word\
    \ \u2018spear\u2019. In the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic \u2018zug\u2019 means\
    \ to join, to couple; from this the Greeks obtained zugos, the Romans \u2018jugum\u2019\
    , and we the word \u2018yoke\u2019; while the Germans obtained \u2018jok\u2019\
    \ or \u2018jog\u2019, the Dutch \u2018juk\u2019, the Swedes \u2018ok\u2019. The\
    \ Sanscrit is \u2018juga\u2019. The Arabic \u2018sanna\u2019, to be old, reappears\
    \ in the Latin \u2018senex\u2019, the Welsh \u2018hen\u2019, and our \u2018senile\u2019\
    . The Hebrew \u2018banah\u2019, to build, is the Irish \u2018bun\u2019, foundation,\
    \ and the Latin \u2018fundo\u2019, \u2018fundare\u2019, to found. The Arabic \u2018\
    baraka\u2019, to bend the knee, to fall on the breast, is probably the Saxon \u2018\
    brecau\u2019, the Danish \u2018br\xE4kke\u2019, the Swedish br\xE4cka, Welsh \u2018\
    bregu\u2019, and our word \u2018to break\u2019. The Arabic \u2018baraka\u2019\
    \ also signifies to rain violently; and from this we get the Saxon \u2018roegn\u2019\
    , to rain, Dutch \u2018regen\u2019, to rain, Cimbric \u2018roekia\u2019, rain,\
    \ Welsh \u2018rheg\u2019, rain. The Chaldee word \u2018braic\u2019, a branch,\
    \ is the Irish \u2018braic\u2019 or \u2018raigh\u2019, an arm, the Welsh \u2018\
    braic\u2019, the Latin \u2018brachium\u2019, and the English \u2018brace\u2019\
    , something which supports like an arm. The Chaldee \u2018frak\u2019, to rub,\
    \ to tread out grain, is the same as the Latin \u2018frico\u2019, \u2018frio\u2019\
    , and our word \u2018rake\u2019. The Arabic word to rub is \u2018fraka\u2019.\
    \ The Chaldee \u2018rag\u2019, \u2018ragag\u2019, means to desire, to long for;\
    \ it is the same as the Greek \u2018oregw\u2019, the Latin \u2018porrigere\u2019\
    , the Saxon \u2018roeccan\u2019, the Icelandic \u2018rakna\u2019, the German \u2018\
    reichen\u2019, and our \u2018to reach\u2019, to rage. The Arabic \u2018rauka\u2019\
    , to strain or purify, as wine, is precisely our English word \u2018rack\u2019\
    , to rack wine. The Hebrew word \u2018bara\u2019, to create, is our word to bear,\
    \ as to bear children: a great number of words in all the European languages contain\
    \ this root in its various modifications. The Hebrew word \u2018kafar\u2019, to\
    \ cover, is our word \u2018to cover\u2019, and \u2018coffer\u2019, something which\
    \ covers, and \u2018covert\u2019, a secret place; from this root also comes the\
    \ Latin \u2018cooperio\u2019 and the French \u2018couvrir\u2019, to cover. The\
    \ Arabic word \u2018shakala\u2019, to bind under the belly, is our word \u2018\
    to shackle\u2019. From the Arabic \u2018walada\u2019 and Ethiopian \u2018walad\u2019\
    , to beget, to bring forth, we get the Welsh \u2018llawd\u2019, a shooting out;\
    \ and hence our word \u2018lad\u2019. Our word \u2018matter\u2019, or \u2018pus\u2019\
    , is from the Arabic \u2018madda\u2019; our word \u2018mature\u2019 is originally\
    \ from the Chaldee \u2018mita\u2019. The Arabic word \u2018amida\u2019 signifies\
    \ to end, and from this comes the noun, a limit, a termination, Latin \u2018meta\u2019\
    , and our words \u2018meet\u2019 and \u2018mete\u2019. I might continue this list,\
    \ but I have given enough to show that all the Atlantean races once spoke the\
    \ same language.\u201D \u2014 Ignatius Donnelly, Atlantis : The Antedeluvian World"
