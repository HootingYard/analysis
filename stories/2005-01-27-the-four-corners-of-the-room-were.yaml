  text: '"The four corners of the room were occupied respectively by a turning lathe,
    a Rhumkorff Coil, a small steam engine and an orrery in stately motion. Tables,
    shelves, chairs and floor supported an odd aggregation of tools, retorts, chemicals,
    gas receivers, philosophical instruments, boots, flasks, paper-collar boxes, books
    diminutive and books of preposterous size. There were plaster busts of Aristotle,
    Archimedes, and Comte, while a great drowsy owl was blinking away, perched on
    the benign brow of Martin Farquhar Tupper." -- Edward Page Mitchell, The Tachypomp'
