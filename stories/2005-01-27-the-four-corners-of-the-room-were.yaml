  text: "\u201CThe four corners of the room were occupied respectively by a turning\
    \ lathe, a Rhumkorff Coil, a small steam engine and an orrery in stately motion.\
    \ Tables, shelves, chairs and floor supported an odd aggregation of tools, retorts,\
    \ chemicals, gas receivers, philosophical instruments, boots, flasks, paper-collar\
    \ boxes, books diminutive and books of preposterous size. There were plaster busts\
    \ of Aristotle, Archimedes, and Comte, while a great drowsy owl was blinking away,\
    \ perched on the benign brow of Martin Farquhar Tupper.\u201D \u2014 Edward Page\
    \ Mitchell, The Tachypomp"
