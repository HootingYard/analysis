  text: 'Here is an accurate account of a dream I had just before I woke up this morning.

    I was in an unknown seaside resort with a companion, whose identity was hazy.
    We were walking, and passed a couple of men of Mediterranean appearance, gaunt,
    and dressed in very plain, neat brown coats and hats. They had a film noir air.
    If they hadn''t been so thin Peter Lorre would have been a good choice to play
    one or both of them. I turned to my companion, pointed at one of the men, and
    said "He just said ib". The man at whom I had pointed thrust out his hand, clad
    in a brown (leather?) glove and clutched me around the throat. He fixed me with
    a stare more intense than menacing, and withdrew his hand, leaving the glove in
    place. "That is the Glove of Ib," he announced, "Now read this." He handed me
    a pamphlet, on which was written "He has weak Bomba. His Bomba is not good". I
    understood that this referred to me. The words were printed in heavy black block
    capitals on brown paper and reminded me of a Vorticist tract like Wyndham Lewis''
    BLAST. The Glove of Ib, around my neck, was not uncomfortable, but I wanted to
    be rid of it. The Peter Lorre figures had disappeared--time had passed--and I
    walked around the seaside resort, alone now, trying to find them. Then I woke
    up.

    What can it all mean? I should point out that I did not wake to find myself being
    strangled, nor had my neck become entangled by a stray dressing-gown cord or length
    of string. One thing of which I am sure is that I must work hard today on strengthening
    my Bomba.


    Lorre & Lewis

    ADDENDUM : Last week I had one of those dreams in which you read or write something
    of breathtaking profundity. Usually, the earth-shattering words are forgotten
    as soon as you awake, and the morning is spent in a state of frustration, trying
    to retrieve what seemed so meaningful. On this occasion, I was lucky enough to
    recall what I had dream-written, and I can thus share my dazzling insight with
    you. It was a poem, and--in its entirety--read as follows:

    We are steam, and we mean what we mean'
