  text: "Here is an accurate account of a dream I had just before I woke up this morning.\n\
    I was in an unknown seaside resort with a companion, whose identity was hazy.\
    \ We were walking, and passed a couple of men of Mediterranean appearance, gaunt,\
    \ and dressed in very plain, neat brown coats and hats. They had a film noir air.\
    \ If they hadn't been so thin Peter Lorre would have been a good choice to play\
    \ one or both of them. I turned to my companion, pointed at one of the men, and\
    \ said \u201CHe just said ib\u201D. The man at whom I had pointed thrust out his\
    \ hand, clad in a brown (leather?) glove and clutched me around the throat. He\
    \ fixed me with a stare more intense than menacing, and withdrew his hand, leaving\
    \ the glove in place. \u201CThat is the Glove of Ib,\u201D he announced, \u201C\
    Now read this.\u201D He handed me a pamphlet, on which was written \u201CHe has\
    \ weak Bomba. His Bomba is not good\u201D. I understood that this referred to\
    \ me. The words were printed in heavy black block capitals on brown paper and\
    \ reminded me of a Vorticist tract like Wyndham Lewis' BLAST. The Glove of Ib,\
    \ around my neck, was not uncomfortable, but I wanted to be rid of it. The Peter\
    \ Lorre figures had disappeared\u2014time had passed\u2014and I walked around\
    \ the seaside resort, alone now, trying to find them. Then I woke up.\nWhat can\
    \ it all mean? I should point out that I did not wake to find myself being strangled,\
    \ nor had my neck become entangled by a stray dressing-gown cord or length of\
    \ string. One thing of which I am sure is that I must work hard today on strengthening\
    \ my Bomba.\n\nLorre & Lewis\nADDENDUM : Last week I had one of those dreams in\
    \ which you read or write something of breathtaking profundity. Usually, the earth-shattering\
    \ words are forgotten as soon as you awake, and the morning is spent in a state\
    \ of frustration, trying to retrieve what seemed so meaningful. On this occasion,\
    \ I was lucky enough to recall what I had dream-written, and I can thus share\
    \ my dazzling insight with you. It was a poem, and\u2014in its entirety\u2014\
    read as follows:\nWe are steam, and we mean what we mean"
