  text: "Another letter arrives from Max D\xE9charn\xE9, wit, sage, and originator\
    \ of the well-known catchphrase \u201CWell, tie me to a tree and call me Barry\u201D\
    . Max writes to say that, in his recent reading, he learned of the now-neglected\
    \ British surrealist painter Robin Ironside. \u201CWhen he wasn't designing the\
    \ four-foot obelisk in Sevenhampton churchyard which commemorates Ian Fleming,\u201D\
    \ writes Max, \u201CIronside painted pictures with titles that might appeal to\
    \ you.\u201D They do, they do. Here are the titles of six paintings from the 1940s:\n\
    Street Entertainer Playing Threatening Music To A Cinema Queue\nA Picture To Prove\
    \ That The Greeks Only Painted With Three Colours\nWounded Man In Bed-sitting\
    \ Room\nCrowd Awaiting A Portent\nFamous Statues Visiting A Museum Of People\n\
    Patients Suffering From Waxy Insensibility\nI have not been able to track down\
    \ any reproductions on the web: perhaps an enthusiastic reader can do further\
    \ research?"
