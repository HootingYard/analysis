  text: 'Another letter arrives from Max Decharne, wit, sage, and originator of the
    well-known catchphrase "Well, tie me to a tree and call me Barry". Max writes
    to say that, in his recent reading, he learned of the now-neglected British surrealist
    painter Robin Ironside. "When he wasn''t designing the four-foot obelisk in Sevenhampton
    churchyard which commemorates Ian Fleming," writes Max, "Ironside painted pictures
    with titles that might appeal to you." They do, they do. Here are the titles of
    six paintings from the 1940s:

    Street Entertainer Playing Threatening Music To A Cinema Queue

    A Picture To Prove That The Greeks Only Painted With Three Colours

    Wounded Man In Bed-sitting Room

    Crowd Awaiting A Portent

    Famous Statues Visiting A Museum Of People

    Patients Suffering From Waxy Insensibility

    I have not been able to track down any reproductions on the web: perhaps an enthusiastic
    reader can do further research?'
