  text: 'One of the stories I grew up with, that I heard a hundred times at my mother''s
    knee, was the tale of the glib hatter. When I say "at my mother''s knee" I am
    using a cliche, of course. For one thing, I did not literally squat at my mother''s
    knee, and in any case she had two knees. If I wanted you to picture me, so many
    years ago, hearing the tale of the glib hatter, and if I had squatted as indicated,
    I would have been precise, and written "at my mother''s left knee" or "at my mother''s
    right knee", not just "at my mother''s knee", unless of course she had only one
    knee, due to amputation of one of her legs above the knee, which was, happily,
    not the case. Although even if it were, it would still be proper to indicate which
    knee, the left or the right, she retained, after Old Mister Sawbones had chopped
    the leg with the other one off and put it on a pyre to be burned.

    I heard my mother tell me the tale of the glib hatter many times, but usually
    when I was tucked up in bed, under my blankets, ready for sleep. In fact, almost
    always, I drifted into sleepyland while my mother was in the middle of the story.
    Sometimes she would only get as far as the bit where the glib hatter steals a
    basket of potatoes from the ice maiden. If I was a little more alert, for example
    if I snuck into the pantry before bed and helped myself to a few glucose tablets,
    which I sometimes did, for I craved glucose as a child, and still do, I might
    be able to remain awake for as long as it took my mother to reach the point in
    the story where the glib hatter is attacked by a bison out on the savannah. But
    usually I was so exhausted from my Canadian Air Force exercises that my eyelids
    were drooping almost as soon as that dulcet voice said "Once upon a time there
    was a hatter, and the hatter was glib".

    I do want you to be able to picture me, all tucked up, listening to my bedtime
    story. It is important that you can see in your mind''s eye the blankets, the
    bed, the carpet and the curtains, the floor, ceiling and walls, the chair and
    chest of drawers and all the other things in the room, and me with my tousled
    mop of hair snug on the pillow, and my mother sat by my bedside, her hair in a
    bun and her smock filthy from cooking, one plump hand holding the book and the
    other plump hand holding a torch, its faint beam aimed at the page from which
    she is reading, for we had no electricity in the house, we relied on that one
    torch and many, many candles.

    I forgot to say that there would always be a dog on the floor at the foot of the
    bed. It was a mastiff called Bob. My mother insisted in later years that it was
    named after President Nixon''s disgraced, indeed imprisoned, Chief of Staff H
    R "Bob" Haldeman, but she was wrong, she was oh so wrong. The mastiff was called
    Bob for quite a different reason. It saddened me, in those later years, to argue
    over this so violently with my dear mother, after all those hours she had spent
    reading the tale of the glib hatter to me by torchlight, while I fell asleep,
    in my bedroom on the attic floor of the house on the edge of the marshes, that
    crumbling house that stood all alone surrounded by will-o-the-wisps and eerie
    flickering lights.

    I remember that once I managed to stay awake for the whole story. Mama began to
    read after giving me my tumbler of hot milk at around nine o'' clock. It was winter,
    so already pitch dark outside. Mercifully, the shutters were closed tight and
    all the doors had been locked and double-locked. The only sounds were the tick
    tock of the clock on my bedroom wall, the wheezing breath of Bob the mastiff at
    the foot of my bed, and, faintly and from across the marshes, far far away, the
    bellowing of Old Farmer Frack''s barnyard animals as he herded them from one field
    to another, back and forth, over and over again, for no apparent purpose. One
    of the first things I ever learned was that Old Farmer Frack was a mad old man
    and that if I ever came face to face with him I should turn and run like the wind.
    I don''t know why I was so wakeful that night, why I listened so intently as my
    mother reached the bit about the ice maiden''s potatoes, and then the bison-attack,
    and still I lay wide-eyed, lapping up every detail, new things I had never heard
    before, because I always dropped off, things like the glib hatter falling down
    a pothole, and eating lettuce, and the blind man getting his hair cut, and thousands
    of frogs, and the part where the glib hatter cheats at cards when playing whist
    with the widow, and the village where all the children wear pointy caps, and the
    adventure of the pit pony, and the part where a vaporous apparition of Ringo Starr
    floats over the rooftops, and the glib hatter gets mixed up with a lax potter,
    and the shrubs and firestorms and cotoneaster and clay and architecture and a
    new serum and Klondike gold and cows and crows and bauxite and birdseed and huge
    ponds filled with teardrops, millions and billions of teardrops in millions and
    billions of sad and salty ponds.

    I think it must have been about four o'' clock in the morning when my mother read
    "And that is the end of the story of the glib hatter", and she extinguished the
    torch and kissed my forehead and I shut my eyes at last and fell asleep.'
