  text: "Scrofula is the Latin word for brood sow, and it is the term applied to a\
    \ tuberculous infection of the chain of lymph glands in the neck, creating swellings\
    \ between the angle of the jaw and the top of the breastbone. It has been known\
    \ to afflict people since antiquity, and during the Middle Ages was known as \u201C\
    the King's Evil\u201D, because it was thought that the monarch's touch would cure\
    \ it. We may scoff at such na\xEFvet\xE9, especially given the rather disturbing\
    \ personal habits of kings and queens past and present. An early scoffer was Valentine\
    \ Greatrakes (1628-1666), a Cromwellian soldier during the English Civil War.\
    \ In the revolutionary mood of the time, he correctly surmised that God could\
    \ act through himself as well as through the royal personage, and did his own\
    \ scrofula-healing by gently stroking his patients. He also applied poultices\
    \ made from carrots, although it is unclear whether these were divinely inspired.\n\
    Back in the Middle Ages, of course, when only the King was thought to be capable\
    \ of curing scrofula by touch, there was also a great enthusiasm for penitence.\
    \ Natural calamities of all kinds were thought to be the Terrible Judgment of\
    \ an Angry God, a not unreasonable idea. Pestilence was met with penitence, rather\
    \ than with carrot poultices, although perhaps I am oversimplifying. No doubt\
    \ some canny peasants used both approaches.\nAnd what can we learn from this,\
    \ o tiny ones? Well, if you think you have contracted scrofula, or indeed any\
    \ other malady, such as Asiatic Bird Flu, a pandemic of which we are promised\
    \ by world health officials, you would be well advised to repent your sins, preferably\
    \ in a manner that involves the mortification of the flesh, and while doing so,\
    \ grate some carrots.\nNext week, we shall take a look at Fundamentalist Aztec\
    \ Sun-worshippers and Swamp Fever.\n\nA terrifically helpful diagram of the human\
    \ skull. Remember, it's under that jaw that scrofulous swellings occur."
