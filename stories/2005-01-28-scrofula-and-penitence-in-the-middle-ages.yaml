  text: 'Scrofula is the Latin word for brood sow, and it is the term applied to a
    tuberculous infection of the chain of lymph glands in the neck, creating swellings
    between the angle of the jaw and the top of the breastbone. It has been known
    to afflict people since antiquity, and during the Middle Ages was known as "the
    King''s Evil", because it was thought that the monarch''s touch would cure it.
    We may scoff at such naivete, especially given the rather disturbing personal
    habits of kings and queens past and present. An early scoffer was Valentine Greatrakes
    (1628-1666), a Cromwellian soldier during the English Civil War. In the revolutionary
    mood of the time, he correctly surmised that God could act through himself as
    well as through the royal personage, and did his own scrofula-healing by gently
    stroking his patients. He also applied poultices made from carrots, although it
    is unclear whether these were divinely inspired.

    Back in the Middle Ages, of course, when only the King was thought to be capable
    of curing scrofula by touch, there was also a great enthusiasm for penitence.
    Natural calamities of all kinds were thought to be the Terrible Judgment of an
    Angry God, a not unreasonable idea. Pestilence was met with penitence, rather
    than with carrot poultices, although perhaps I am oversimplifying. No doubt some
    canny peasants used both approaches.

    And what can we learn from this, o tiny ones? Well, if you think you have contracted
    scrofula, or indeed any other malady, such as Asiatic Bird Flu, a pandemic of
    which we are promised by world health officials, you would be well advised to
    repent your sins, preferably in a manner that involves the mortification of the
    flesh, and while doing so, grate some carrots.

    Next week, we shall take a look at Fundamentalist Aztec Sun-worshippers and Swamp
    Fever.

    jaw that scrofulous swellings occur.'
