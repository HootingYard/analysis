  text: "\u201CYou may also, should it be necessary, not only twist your authorities,\
    \ but actually falsify them, or quote something which you have invented entirely\
    \ yourself. As a rule, your opponent has no books at hand, and could not use them\
    \ if he had. The finest illustration of this is furnished by the French cur\xE9\
    , who, to avoid being compelled, like other citizens, to pave the street in front\
    \ of his house, quoted a saying which he described as biblical: paveant illi,\
    \ ego non pavebo. That was quite enough for the municipal officers.\u201D \u2014\
