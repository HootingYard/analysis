  text: "Many years ago, on an earlier, vanished version of the Hooting Yard web pages,\
    \ much attention was paid to ice. Indeed, there was an Ice Project, a collaborative\
    \ venture the parameters of which were somewhat hazy. In contrast, there has been\
    \ far too little ice-related material here, and I am aware that this must cause\
    \ great anguish for many readers. So let me put things right. Look:\n\nIsn't that\
    \ great? This is one of a set of photographs taken in Geneva last week, and you\
    \ can look at many, many more of them here.\nMeanwhile, perhaps it is time to\
    \ resurrect the Hooting Yard Ice Project. Don't fret about pesky distractions\
    \ like Guidelines For Submissions. Just send in your ice-related material, be\
    \ it observations, pictures, passages of purple prose, or bagatelles, to the Hooting\
    \ Yard Ice Project \xDCberco\xF6rdinator."
