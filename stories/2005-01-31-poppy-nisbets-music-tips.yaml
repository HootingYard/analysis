  text: "Mrs Gubbins is frantically busy with her new magazine about velcro, dubbin\
    \ and crayons* (see 26th January), so we asked Poppy Nisbet to come up with a\
    \ recommended website for you to visit when you have exhausted the heady, exotic\
    \ pleasures of Hooting Yard. Here's Poppy:\nHello readers. There's nothing I like\
    \ better than to clamp my iPod to my head and listen to exciting music. Being\
    \ a woman of rectitude, I never download anything illegally, so my recommendation\
    \ today comes with a stern injunction to purchase the delightful compact disc\
    \ from which the sample tracks are taken. I just know you're going to adore it.\
    \ My own reaction on hearing these songs was a combination of glee and awe.\n\
    I speak of that unique musician Bob Drake, whose new record, The Shunned Country,\
    \ is packed with no less than fifty-two songs. Go and download eight of them,\
    \ sit back, and listen carefully. You too, I have no doubt, will be as thrilled\
    \ as I was. While you're listening, if you can bear to stay away from Hooting\
    \ Yard for a while, it will be worth your while to roam around Bob's site, which\
    \ contains many, many delights.\n*NOTE : Mrs Gubbins has just sent\u2014by pneumatic\
    \ packet\u2014a note to say that she has expanded the purview of her new publication.\
    \ In addition to velcro, dubbin and crayons, her Daily Digest will also cover\
    \ string, grease, bellows, plasma gas, methods of divination, parcels, The Love\
    \ Boat, different types of paste, hints on horticulture, the life-cycle of bumblebees,\
    \ Spring-heeled Jack, grizzly bears, cotton, Cotton Mather, shampoo recipes, tungsten\
    \ railings, poop deck etiquette, the Lindbergh Kidnapping Hoax, towels, blizzards,\
    \ cocoa, genuflection, hatred, floppy things, irked Klondike gold prospectors,\
    \ the legend of Anaxagrotax, ink, bales, crumpled things, the Burgomeisters of\
    \ Calais, dots on a transparent plane, geese, why Jif is now called Cif, mordant\
    \ pelicans, drums in the night, the contents of the stomach of an ostrich, the\
    \ recording of Disraeli Gears by Cream, turquoise jewellery, goldfinches, starlings,\
    \ the collected writings of Elkan Allan, taverns in Didcot, maps of Sumatra, tonsured\
    \ friars, food poisoning, wooden kettles, Toc H lamps, pulverized lumps of basalt,\
    \ wimples and snoods, Daktari, voodoo, jam, kale, strabismus, Molotov cocktails\
    \ and the true meaning of the pendant worn by Christopher Plummer on his wedding\
    \ day."
