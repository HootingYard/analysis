  text: "\u201CThe German mind was then at the height of its emotional unrestraint\u2026\
    \ and it produced a new sect or religious distinction almost every day. Many of\
    \ these sects came to Pennsylvania, where new small religious bodies sprang up\
    \ among them after their arrival. Schwenkfelders, Tunkers, Labadists, New Born,\
    \ New Mooners, Separatists, Zion's Brueder, Ronsdorfer, Inspired, Quietists, Gichtelians,\
    \ Depellians, Mountain Men, River Brethren, Brinser Brethren, and the Society\
    \ of the Woman in the Wilderness, are names which occur in the annals of the province.\u201D\
