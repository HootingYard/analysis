  text: Such an exciting month at Hooting Yard that Mr Key had to go and lie down
    for two months, hence the absence of any entries for March and April. Here you
    can read about bags in the Bible, Rasputin, moths, the Electric Prunes, Muggletonians,
    haruspices, and both Tiny Enid and Serpentine Claude.
