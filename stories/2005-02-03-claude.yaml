  text: 'Serpentine Claude had been in a gale. I asked him what sort of gale it was.
    I''ve got a lot of time for Serpentine Claude. Howling, he said. My my, a howling
    gale, was the nubbin of my reply. Was there a snap? Claude, who is a plutocrat
    with a thing about Mary Pickford, said there was a snap, and it was cold. I was
    beginning to picture Serpentine Claude in a howling gale during a cold snap, but
    I was hungry for further details. Claude misinterpreted my expression and handed
    me a pie. He is serpentine but generous, as well as plutocratic. It was a very
    tasty pie, and I ate it at once. It was a puff pastry pie with a filling of filberts
    and beeborage. While I chewed, Claude told me that the gale during the snap was
    accompanied by rain. I did not want to speak with my mouth full of pie, and before
    I could ask Claude to describe the nature of the rain, he rushed away, along that
    old canal towpath hectic with foxgloves, to a festival of Mary Pickford films
    being shown at the ship-shaped cinema in Tantarabim.

    I swallowed the last of the pie, hoisted my binoculars, and took careful note
    of a swallow perched on the bough of a sycamore over to the west. Or it may have
    been a finch. I am always getting them mixed up, ever since the railway accident.
    I had a psychic premonition of it, just like the hundreds of people who foresaw
    in their dreams the sinking of the Titanic in April 1912. There is a good book
    by George Behe which catalogues them. One day I may find out if anyone else shared
    my premonition of the railway accident and I, too, might collect them into a book.

    Years later I received a letter from Serpentine Claude. This is what he wrote:

    Dear Istvan, It has long been on my conscience, through all the years that I ensnared
    the world in my plutocratic web, that I may have mistaken your look of fixated
    curiosity about the gale during the snap for one of simple hunger. That is why
    I gave you the last of my puff pastry filbert and beeborage pies. But I was wrong,
    wasn''t I? I think I knew I was wrong within minutes of stalking off along that
    foxglove-strewn towpath, but to my shame I did not turn back to rectify my error.
    I was so hot for Mary Pickford that I gave you nary another thought. Please accept
    my apologies, and let me at long last tell you what your heart has burned to know
    through all the succeeding years, through the reigns on earth of a fair few Pontiffs.
    In the howling gale during the cold snap, the rain was torrential. It fell in
    torrents. Yours faithfully, Serpentine Claude.'
