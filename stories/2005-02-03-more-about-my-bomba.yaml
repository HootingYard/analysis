  text: "Readers will recall that last week I had a dream in which it was imputed\u2014\
    by a Peter Lorre lookalike\u2014that I had weak Bomba and that my Bomba was not\
    \ good (see 27th January). I have been puzzling over what this might mean, and\
    \ what I might do to attain good strong Bomba. Now Pansy Cradledew has provided\
    \ a possible solution to the mystery.\nDear Mr Key, she writes, By remarkable\
    \ coincidence, on the very day that you addressed your weak Bomba, I was doing\
    \ some internet research on bees, as I often do when I find myself at a loose\
    \ end. From the excellent pages maintained by Hania and Hans*, I learned that\
    \ bumblebees are of the genus Bombus! In case you are wondering, bumblebees are\
    \ big and extremely hairy bees. A few species of bumblebees are being bred nowadays\
    \ to take care of pollination in greenhouses. They turn out to be very useful\
    \ in growing tomatoes and cucumbers. One can buy colonies in specialized shops\
    \ and on the internet. When flying most bumblebees are producing lots of noise,\
    \ attracting our attention that way. They belong to the most beloved of all insects,\
    \ for they are the perfect messengers announcing spring is on the way. Bumblebees\
    \ have typical warning colours: black and yellow or black and red. And it is true:\
    \ all species are capable of stinging. But they are not very willing to do so.\
    \ We can even take many species in our hand. As long as we don't squeeze them,\
    \ they won't sting us at all! Only bumblebees laying on their back should never\
    \ be touched, for this is their typical defence position, indicating they feel\
    \ threatened and are ready to sting! The poison they inject is harmless, except\
    \ for those allergic to wasp poison. ( If you are not sure, arrange to have yourself\
    \ stung by a wasp while a team of experts in insect toxicity stand at the ready,\
    \ with bleepers.) Bumblebees are typical insects of moderate climate zones, with\
    \ a few species even surviving arctic conditions. You won't find them in the tropics\
    \ though. The hairs on the body ensure they don't cool off too soon. But there\
    \ is more. Just like mammals bumblebees control their own body temperature. They\
    \ can detach the muscles used to move their wings. And by moving the detached\
    \ muscles rapidly they produce their own body heat. This is the reason you can\
    \ sometimes find a motionless bumblebee on the ground or a flower. It is not dying\
    \ or sick\u2014it does not, as you would say in your dream, \u201Chave weak Bomba\u201D\
    \ \u2014 but is simply heating up its own body. But due to the fact that the wings\
    \ are detached from their muscles it is not capable of flying at the time. Bumblebees\
    \ keep a body temperature of 34 to 38 Centigrade. Oh, and just to make sure you\
    \ know what I'm talking about, this is what they look like:\n\nAnyway, it seems\
    \ clear to me that your dream about Bomba was a dream about two or more Bombuses.\
    \ There is something bubbling away in your subconscious that makes you preoccupied\
    \ with weak and \u201Cnot good\u201D \u2014 ill? evil?\u2014bumblebees. I suggest,\
    \ Mr Key, that you search your soul with rigour. Did you perhaps once stamp on\
    \ a little Bombus? Yours astutely, Pansy Cradledew\n*NOTE : Hania and Hans are\
    \ seeking help in identifying unidentified wasps. Can you help? Please do what\
    \ you can by clicking on the picture of the Bombus."
