  text: "\u201CThey scatter white sand on the floor every morning. They keep their\
    \ houses very clean. In their kitchens they have open fireplaces, with fires blazing\
    \ brightly. Near the fires they have footstools made of cork. In some houses they\
    \ have fire boxes for warming their feet. They can carry these boxes wherever\
    \ they like. In cold weather they take their fire boxes to church.\u201D \u2014\
