  text: '"They scatter white sand on the floor every morning. They keep their houses
    very clean. In their kitchens they have open fireplaces, with fires blazing brightly.
    Near the fires they have footstools made of cork. In some houses they have fire
    boxes for warming their feet. They can carry these boxes wherever they like. In
    cold weather they take their fire boxes to church." -- Edward R Shaw, Big People
    And Little People Of Other Lands'
