  text: "\u201CA circumstance of considerable human interest, and one possibly little\
    \ known, is the great aversion to the sight of bears held by the inhabitants of\
    \ the Isle of Wight, at least in the year 1891. A copy of the Bye-Laws of the\
    \ Administrative County of the Isle of Wight, issued that year, contains, following\
    \ articles relating to \u2018Regulating the Sale of Coal\u2019 and \u2018Spitting\u2019\
    , this: \u2018As to Bears. 1. No bear shall be taken along or allowed to be upon\
    \ any highway, unless such bear shall be securely confined in a vehicle closed\
    \ so as to completely hide such bear from view. 2. Any person who shall offend\
    \ against this Bye-law shall be liable to a fine not exceeding in any case five\
    \ pounds.\u2019\u201D \u2014 Robert Cortes Holliday, Walking-Stick Papers"
