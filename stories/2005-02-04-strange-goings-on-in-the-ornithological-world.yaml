  text: "As the title of this item indicates, I have identified some strange goings-on\
    \ in the world of ornithology. Before apprising you of my findings, let us examine\
    \ carefully this picture of a pair of decoy ducks:\n\nNote that the picture has\
    \ nothing to do with the spooky bird-related mystery I am about to report, just\
    \ that I never pass up the opportunity to take a long hard look at pictures of\
    \ decoy ducks, and nor should you, for who knows when you will be able to put\
    \ the insights gained to good use?\nOn to the matter at hand. Earlier in the week,\
    \ the Guardian ran a story headed Birds rise in intellectual pecking order. This\
    \ included some fascinating information, including the ability of pigeons to differentiate\
    \ between cubist and impressionist paintings, the fact that scrub jays share certain\
    \ cognitive features with human beings, and, of course, that old favourite, Crows\
    \ Are Clever.\nThese facts were gleaned from an article in Nature Reviews Neuroscience\
    \ about the work of the Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium, an international\
    \ team of twenty-nine neuroscientists. I have to say I was thrilled to read about\
    \ an organisation with such a terrific, if highly specialised, name. It occurred\
    \ to me that this is precisely the kind of august body that Hooting Yard should\
    \ be affiliated to. Wouldn't it look great at the top of the page? Hooting Yard\
    \ : An Associate Member Of the Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium. (I know that\
    \ my grasp of neuroscience is less than steady, but I'm sure I could bring a certain\
    \ \xE9lan to the group's proceedings. And I, too, have \u201Cnew thinking about\
    \ the brains of ptarmigans and tits, bitterns, budgerigars and buzzards\u201D\
    . )\nBefore firing off my letter to the Consortium's top bird brain boffin, Erich\
    \ Jarvis, I went to the Guardian Unlimited website. I wanted to reread the story\
    \ and follow up any suggested links. Imagine my perplexity when I discovered that,\
    \ in the web version of the story, Professor Erich's team had become the Avian\
    \ Nomenclature Consortium. No mention of the Brain at all. I took the newspaper\
    \ out of the dustbin and double-checked. I was not mistaken. Brain in the paper,\
    \ no brain on the web. Somehow the brainless version of the Consortium just doesn't\
    \ have that special something. I tore up my letter of application and squelched\
    \ off in my boots to take a walk around Nameless Pond, a saddened and shattered\
    \ man."
