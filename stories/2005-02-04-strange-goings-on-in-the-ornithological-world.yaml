  text: 'As the title of this item indicates, I have identified some strange goings-on
    in the world of ornithology. Before apprising you of my findings, let us examine
    carefully this picture of a pair of decoy ducks:


    Note that the picture has nothing to do with the spooky bird-related mystery I
    am about to report, just that I never pass up the opportunity to take a long hard
    look at pictures of decoy ducks, and nor should you, for who knows when you will
    be able to put the insights gained to good use?

    On to the matter at hand. Earlier in the week, the Guardian ran a story headed
    Birds rise in intellectual pecking order. This included some fascinating information,
    including the ability of pigeons to differentiate between cubist and impressionist
    paintings, the fact that scrub jays share certain cognitive features with human
    beings, and, of course, that old favourite, Crows Are Clever.

    These facts were gleaned from an article in Nature Reviews Neuroscience about
    the work of the Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium, an international team of
    twenty-nine neuroscientists. I have to say I was thrilled to read about an organisation
    with such a terrific, if highly specialised, name. It occurred to me that this
    is precisely the kind of august body that Hooting Yard should be affiliated to.
    Wouldn''t it look great at the top of the page? Hooting Yard : An Associate Member
    Of the Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium. (I know that my grasp of neuroscience
    is less than steady, but I''m sure I could bring a certain elan to the group''s
    proceedings. And I, too, have "new thinking about the brains of ptarmigans and
    tits, bitterns, budgerigars and buzzards". )

    Before firing off my letter to the Consortium''s top bird brain boffin, Erich
    Jarvis, I went to the Guardian Unlimited website. I wanted to reread the story
    and follow up any suggested links. Imagine my perplexity when I discovered that,
    in the web version of the story, Professor Erich''s team had become the Avian
    Nomenclature Consortium. No mention of the Brain at all. I took the newspaper
    out of the dustbin and double-checked. I was not mistaken. Brain in the paper,
    no brain on the web. Somehow the brainless version of the Consortium just doesn''t
    have that special something. I tore up my letter of application and squelched
    off in my boots to take a walk around Nameless Pond, a saddened and shattered
    man.'
