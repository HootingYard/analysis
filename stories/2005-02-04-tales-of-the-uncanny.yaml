  text: "Here are three brief tales of the uncanny.\nOne. I was sitting in a bower\
    \ on a bright summer's day, the air heady with verbena, eating my snack. All of\
    \ a sudden, gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial hideousness\
    \ began oozing from my jam sandwich, and I swooned. When I came to, I had a tiny\
    \ radio transmitter implanted in my forehead, but I remained unaware of it for\
    \ the rest of my life.\nTwo. They called him MacTavish, and he was the village\
    \ wrestler. He lived in a room above the post office. No other living being ever\
    \ set foot in the room until the day MacTavish died. They found him lying on his\
    \ bed, as if he were asleep, but there was no doubt that he was dead, for hovering\
    \ above his chest was a baleful phantom, emitting gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling\
    \ extraterrestrial hideousness which it poured into a funnel inserted into MacTavish's\
    \ right ear. They closed up the room and nailed the door shut and it remained\
    \ unopened for the next hundred years.\nThree. \u201CHand me that chaffinch, young\
    \ Cubbit,\u201D said Jarvis to his lantern-jawed assistant. Jarvis was a top bird\
    \ scientist, and every Tuesday he devoted to the study of chaffinches. They were\
    \ out wandering the hills, Jarvis and Cubbit, and the boffin had spotted a chaffinch\
    \ near a babbling brook. As the knock-kneed youth clumsily picked up the chaffinch,\
    \ he heard a scream behind him. Spinning round, dropping the chaffinch in the\
    \ process, he saw Jarvis being engulfed by a giant fod. The poor lad scampered\
    \ back to the lab and told what had happened to Mrs Purgative, the kindly old\
    \ washerwoman. \u201CWell! I never heard of such a thing!\u201D she exclaimed.\
    \ And she hoisted her mop on her shoulder, took Cubbit by his withered hand, and\
    \ led him far, far away, all the way to Gondwanaland.\nSource : Six Hundred And\
