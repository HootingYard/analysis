  text: 'Today is the final day of the Muggletonian Great Holiday, celebrated on the
    third, fourth and fifth of February each year. On those three days in 1652, the
    tailor John Reeve (1608-1658) received his commission from God, and was told that
    his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton (1609-1698) was to be his "mouth". Reeve learned
    that he and Muggleton were the two witnesses referred to in Revelations 11:3,
    and that God had empowered them to pronounce upon the fate of individuals. As
    Muggleton wrote in his 1663 tract The Neck of The Quakers Broken, "He hath put
    the two-edged Sword of His Spirit into my Mouth, that whosoever I pronounce cursed
    through my Mouth, is cursed to Eternity".

    It was long thought that, of all the sects which sprang up in the English Civil
    War period, only the Quakers survived into the twentieth century. During the 1970s,
    however, one Philip Noakes came to light in Kent, a living Muggletonian in possession
    of a huge archive of material covering the sect''s entire history.

    The Muggletonians believed that human reason was unclean. This led them to reject
    physical science. They refused to accept the laws of gravity or the rules of mathematics,
    and they considered astronomy to be wrong. The stars, they said, were only as
    big as God made them appear from earth. In later years, Muggletonians banned hot
    air ballooning, because the balloons would crash into the sky, a solid band around
    the earth.

    And here is a date for your diary. Lodowicke Muggleton was imprisoned for blasphemous
    writing in January 1677. He was released on 19th July, which was thereafter celebrated
    every year as the Muggletonian Little Holiday.
