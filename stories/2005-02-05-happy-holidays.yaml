  text: "Today is the final day of the Muggletonian Great Holiday, celebrated on the\
    \ third, fourth and fifth of February each year. On those three days in 1652,\
    \ the tailor John Reeve (1608-1658) received his commission from God, and was\
    \ told that his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton (1609-1698) was to be his \u201Cmouth\u201D\
    . Reeve learned that he and Muggleton were the two witnesses referred to in Revelations\
    \ 11:3, and that God had empowered them to pronounce upon the fate of individuals.\
    \ As Muggleton wrote in his 1663 tract The Neck of The Quakers Broken, \u201C\
    He hath put the two-edged Sword of His Spirit into my Mouth, that whosoever I\
    \ pronounce cursed through my Mouth, is cursed to Eternity\u201D.\n\nPortrait\
    \ of Lodowicke Muggleton by William Wood, circa 1674 (National Portrait Gallery)\n\
    It was long thought that, of all the sects which sprang up in the English Civil\
    \ War period, only the Quakers survived into the twentieth century. During the\
    \ 1970s, however, one Philip Noakes came to light in Kent, a living Muggletonian\
    \ in possession of a huge archive of material covering the sect's entire history.\n\
    The Muggletonians believed that human reason was unclean. This led them to reject\
    \ physical science. They refused to accept the laws of gravity or the rules of\
    \ mathematics, and they considered astronomy to be wrong. The stars, they said,\
    \ were only as big as God made them appear from earth. In later years, Muggletonians\
    \ banned hot air ballooning, because the balloons would crash into the sky, a\
    \ solid band around the earth.\nAnd here is a date for your diary. Lodowicke Muggleton\
    \ was imprisoned for blasphemous writing in January 1677. He was released on 19th\
    \ July, which was thereafter celebrated every year as the Muggletonian Little\
    \ Holiday.\n(Thanks to Andy Hopton, whose 1988 article in Small Press Gleanings\
    \ is my source.)"
