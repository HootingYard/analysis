  text: "One of yesterday's three Tales Of The Uncanny featured Jarvis and Cubbit,\
    \ the bird scientist and his assistant. Dobson filled dozens of notebooks with\
    \ stories about these characters, whom he conceived as an immortal duo as archetypal\
    \ as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Holmes and Watson, or Laurel and Hardy. Alas,\
    \ the out-of-print pamphleteer had no talent for fiction, and the surviving manuscripts\
    \ are fragmentary, littered with vague sketches, false starts, and incomprehensible\
    \ jottings. Jim Pond, newly-appointed Professor of Dobson Studies at the University\
    \ of Jim Pond & His Immediate Family, has spent countless hours in the archives\
    \ to prepare a selection of Jarvis and Cubbit stories, and has kindly offered\
    \ us permission to publish the following, undated, piece.\nThe bell tower had\
    \ bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis, the bird\
    \ scientist.\n\u201CLook, you young tyke, there is a bird on the bell tower,\u201D\
    \ he said to his pneumonia-racked assistant Cubbit, who was doing something foolish\
    \ with a pair of bicycle clips.\nJarvis pointed at the bird, expecting Cubbit\
    \ to look, but the spindly youth was distracted by a passing pantechnicon all\
    \ a-clatter with pots and pans. It was the neighbourhood Windy Man, on his rounds.\n\
    Jarvis hated the Windy Man, for his clattering pots and pans made a din that often\
    \ frightened birds, so that they flew away into the blue majestic skies just as\
    \ the ornithologist was creeping close with his tweezers and bird beaker. The\
    \ Windy Man, on the other hand, was passionately in love with Jarvis, and had\
    \ been ever since he had seen the bird scientist standing on a dais making a bird-related\
    \ proclamation, years ago, for all the world like an Apollonian god, or so he\
    \ seemed to the Windy Man. But the Windy Man was shy, and dared not speak of his\
    \ love, so he pined and felt pangs and was in torment.\nCubbit knew nothing of\
    \ what is related in that paragraph.\nBy chance, a snapshot exists of this precise\
    \ moment. It was taken by a passing camera buff whose fancy had been taken by\
    \ a pirouetting mechanical nougat-vending machine, all pink and gleaming. There\
    \ it is to the left in the black-and-white photograph, in front of the bell tower.\
    \ To the right, in the foreground, we see the back of Cubbit's head, next to a\
    \ furious-looking Jarvis. Partially obscured behind them is the Windy Man's pantechnicon,\
    \ on which some of the clattering pots and pans are visible. Sadly, the Windy\
    \ Man's face is blurred by a smudge or a cloud of gnats or a freakish effulgence\
    \ of mist and gas. It could be any of those things. In framing his photo, the\
    \ enthusiast did not include the upper part of the bell tower, so we do not know\
    \ what kind of bird Jarvis was pointing at, nor whether it was a bird at all,\
    \ or just a fluttering black napkin borne aloft on a gentle summer breeze, given\
    \ avian form through the power of Jarvis' unquenchable imagination.\nEver after,\
    \ he insisted it was a trumpeter swan."
