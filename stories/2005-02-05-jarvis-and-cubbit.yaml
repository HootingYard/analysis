  text: 'One of yesterday''s three Tales Of The Uncanny featured Jarvis and Cubbit,
    the bird scientist and his assistant. Dobson filled dozens of notebooks with stories
    about these characters, whom he conceived as an immortal duo as archetypal as
    Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Holmes and Watson, or Laurel and Hardy. Alas, the
    out-of-print pamphleteer had no talent for fiction, and the surviving manuscripts
    are fragmentary, littered with vague sketches, false starts, and incomprehensible
    jottings. Jim Pond, newly-appointed Professor of Dobson Studies at the University
    of Jim Pond & His Immediate Family, has spent countless hours in the archives
    to prepare a selection of Jarvis and Cubbit stories, and has kindly offered us
    permission to publish the following, undated, piece.

    The bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of
    Jarvis, the bird scientist.

    "Look, you young tyke, there is a bird on the bell tower," he said to his pneumonia-racked
    assistant Cubbit, who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips.

    Jarvis pointed at the bird, expecting Cubbit to look, but the spindly youth was
    distracted by a passing pantechnicon all a-clatter with pots and pans. It was
    the neighbourhood Windy Man, on his rounds.

    Jarvis hated the Windy Man, for his clattering pots and pans made a din that often
    frightened birds, so that they flew away into the blue majestic skies just as
    the ornithologist was creeping close with his tweezers and bird beaker. The Windy
    Man, on the other hand, was passionately in love with Jarvis, and had been ever
    since he had seen the bird scientist standing on a dais making a bird-related
    proclamation, years ago, for all the world like an Apollonian god, or so he seemed
    to the Windy Man. But the Windy Man was shy, and dared not speak of his love,
    so he pined and felt pangs and was in torment.

    Cubbit knew nothing of what is related in that paragraph.

    By chance, a snapshot exists of this precise moment. It was taken by a passing
    camera buff whose fancy had been taken by a pirouetting mechanical nougat-vending
    machine, all pink and gleaming. There it is to the left in the black-and-white
    photograph, in front of the bell tower. To the right, in the foreground, we see
    the back of Cubbit''s head, next to a furious-looking Jarvis. Partially obscured
    behind them is the Windy Man''s pantechnicon, on which some of the clattering
    pots and pans are visible. Sadly, the Windy Man''s face is blurred by a smudge
    or a cloud of gnats or a freakish effulgence of mist and gas. It could be any
    of those things. In framing his photo, the enthusiast did not include the upper
    part of the bell tower, so we do not know what kind of bird Jarvis was pointing
    at, nor whether it was a bird at all, or just a fluttering black napkin borne
    aloft on a gentle summer breeze, given avian form through the power of Jarvis''
    unquenchable imagination.

    Ever after, he insisted it was a trumpeter swan.'
