  text: "\u201CThere was an interesting communication at, of all places, Salisbury\
    \ railway station in 1966. I was advised by communications to build a copper cone\
    \ to help my condition. Having read of the apparent Atlantean cones in Other Tongues,\
    \ Other Flesh by George Hunt Williamson, with their complicated circuits, I felt\
    \ unqualified to build one. The answer rapped back: 'Just build a simple cone\
    \ of copper\u2014that's not beyond you is it?' I sat up with a start\u2014surely\
    \ space people would not talk like that? But it jerked me out of my self-pity\
    \ and I began a regular daily use of a cone which my father made from a piece\
    \ of scrap sheet copper.\u201D \u2014 Jimmy Goddard, Cosmic Friends"
