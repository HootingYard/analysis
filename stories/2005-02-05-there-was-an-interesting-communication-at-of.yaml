  text: '"There was an interesting communication at, of all places, Salisbury railway
    station in 1966. I was advised by communications to build a copper cone to help
    my condition. Having read of the apparent Atlantean cones in Other Tongues, Other
    Flesh by George Hunt Williamson, with their complicated circuits, I felt unqualified
    to build one. The answer rapped back: ''Just build a simple cone of copper--that''s
    not beyond you is it?'' I sat up with a start--surely space people would not talk
    like that? But it jerked me out of my self-pity and I began a regular daily use
    of a cone which my father made from a piece of scrap sheet copper." -- Jimmy Goddard,
    Cosmic Friends'
