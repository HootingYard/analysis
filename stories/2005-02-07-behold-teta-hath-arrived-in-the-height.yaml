  text: '"Behold, Teta hath arrived in the height of heaven, and the henmemet beings
    have seen him; the Semketet boat knoweth him, and it is Teta who saileth it, and
    the Mantchet boat calleth unto him, and it is Teta who bringeth it to a standstill.
    Teta hath seen his body in the Semketet boat, he knoweth the uraeus which is in
    the Mantchet boat, and God hath called him in his name...and hath taken him in
    to Ra." -- E A Wallis Budge, Egyptian Ideas Of The Future Life'
