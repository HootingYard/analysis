  text: 'The ailing Pope has kept very busy in the last few years, beatifying and
    canonising with gay abandon and creating more new saints than any of his predecessors
    for hundreds of years. I try to keep abreast of these important matters, but I
    fear that one of the new saints escaped my attention. This morning, to my shame,
    I did some shopping in Tesco, that temple of Mammon owned by the wretched "Lady"
    Shirley Porter, who is long overdue for criminal prosecution. Browsing through
    the cheeses, I noticed a sign announcing a special offer on "Saint Ague". (Nearby
    was a stack of packets of Saint Agur, a delightful creamy blue cheese from the
    Auvergne.) I have never come across Saint Ague before, so he or she must be one
    of the new ones. I must check to see if Il Papa has also created Saint Pox, Saint
    Bubo, Saint Plague and Saint Black Bile, among others.


    The sick Pope at his hospital window. That sober journal of record the Daily Mail
    referred to the "gasping Pope minutes from death".'
