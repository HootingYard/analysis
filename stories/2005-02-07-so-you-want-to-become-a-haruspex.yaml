  text: 'If you are interested in becoming a haruspex, the first thing to do is choose
    a sacrificial victim and slaughter it, or, if you are squeamish, have it slaughtered
    for you. It might be a duck or a hen or a hare, and if you are having delusions
    of grandeur, you can always use a larger animal like a performing seal or a giraffe.
    Haruspices tend not to engage in human sacrifice, and it is well not to give the
    police any pretext to investigate your doings. In current law, there is no plea
    of haruspexdom to defend you against a murder rap. Remember that, it''s important.

    Now, once the victim has been slain, it is your job to interpret the entrails.
    You will be following in a long tradition. Back in Ancient Etruscan times, the
    earliest haruspices learned their art from Tages, a being who suddenly sprang
    from the ground near Tarquinii. Tages always claimed to be the grandson of Jupiter,
    and as no one ever challenged him on this, it must have been so.

    I know what you''re going to ask. Victim killed, check. Splattered with gore,
    check. Disposition of entrails visible, check. But how to interpret them? Well,
    that''s where your local library comes in. Early haruspices, sometimes known as
    extispices, wrote a series of instructional manuals called libri haruspicini,
    fulgurales, and tonitruales, and copies should be available if you ask the librarian
    in a very quiet voice, making sure you maintain eye contact. Bear in mind that
    municipal librarians become rightly suspicious of shifty-eyed borrowers, and if
    that means fixing them with a stare of unhinged madcappery, so be it. These ancient
    tomes are not forbidden, as far as I know, and you have every right to borrow
    them, unless you owe outstanding fines.

    I should have told you to get copies of the haruspicina manuals before slaughtering
    your eel, or bat, or whatever creature you selected. Sorry. Anyway, by consulting
    the books you will be well placed to interpret from the fresh entrails the will
    of the gods. And that''s all there is to it!

    If you are vegetarian or vegan, you can still qualify as a haruspex by eschewing
    entrails and instead interpreting portenta, that is lightning, earthquakes, and
    all extraordinary phenomena in nature.

    Unlike those snotty-nosed augurs, with their professional association, haruspices
    tend to be self-employed. You can drum up business by advertising in the Yellow
    Pages or placing a notice in your newsagent''s or post office''s window. Good
    luck!
