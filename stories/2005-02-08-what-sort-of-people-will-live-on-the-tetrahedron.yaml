  text: "That question is the subtitle of an article in the May 1918 issue of My Magazine.\
    \ Here are the opening paragraphs:\nHow would you like to live on a tetrahedron?\
    \ Men say the earth will one day come to that.\nMany strange visions men have\
    \ had of the world since it began. They used to think it a disc floating in water.\
    \ There are still stupid people who believe it is flat. Every wise child knows\
    \ that the truth is that the earth is practically a round ball.\nIt will not always\
    \ be like this, however\u2026what the people of the world will live on in millions\
    \ of years to come will probably be a tetrahedron. It all looks terribly dull,\
    \ but it is really tremendously interesting\u2026 Let us think about it all.\n\
    I adore that well-placed \u201Cprobably\u201D, and it's a bit rich for a tetrahedron-earther\
    \ to call a flat-earther \u201Cstupid\u201D, but look, look!\n\nThis is how it\
    \ will be, and you can read further details here. What you cannot read, maddeningly,\
    \ is the answer to the question that is posed. I for one want to know what sort\
    \ of people will live on the tetrahedron. Muggletonians? Quakers? Management consultants?\
    \ Will they use the Mayan calendar? Will the Pope still wear a little white cap?\
    \ Will the novels of V S Naipaul be in print? Hooting Yard's indefatigable Antipodean\
    \ researcher Glyn Webster brought this to my attention. Perhaps he could do the\
    \ decent thing and answer the question."
