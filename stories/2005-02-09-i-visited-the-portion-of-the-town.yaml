  text: '"I visited the portion of the town appropriated by the Mormons as a residence.
    Here, in the midst of their dwellings, they had erected a temple for worship,
    which, on their emigrating west, their arch-leader, Smith, prophesied would, by
    the interposition of heaven, be destroyed by fire. The prophecy was verified as
    to the fact, but heaven had, it appeared, little to do with it; for it was ascertained
    to be the work of an incendiary of their sect, who was detected and brought to
    condign punishment." -- John Benwell, An Englishman''s Travels In America'
