  text: "Max D\xE9charn\xE9 writes from Berlin to note that the Daily Mail is reviving\
    \ the high standard of tabloid newspaper headlines. On Monday I quoted their Gasping\
    \ Pope Minutes From Death. \u201CI wish I had a framed copy of the front page\
    \ on my wall,\u201D writes Max, \u201CIt reminds me of those early eighties headlines\
    \ which got used as punk song titles by the likes of The Exploited. City Baby\
    \ Attacked By Rats is one I remember well.\u201D To which, of course, should be\
    \ added the immortal Must We Fling This Filth At Our Pop Kids?\nMax goes on to\
    \ remind us of the winning ways of an earlier pontiff, Eugenio Pacelli, alias\
    \ Pius XII. \u201CI recommend John Cornwell's fascinating Hitler's Pope\u2014\
    The Secret History of Pius XII. Signor Pacelli seems to have been a humble chap.\
    \ He ordered that anyone in the clergy who was on the other end of the telephone\
    \ to him should kneel throughout the conversation, and the gardeners in his private\
    \ garden were instructed to hide in the bushes as he went past, so he wouldn't\
    \ have to look at them. Having, of course, sworn an oath of poverty, he drove\
    \ around in a huge limousine with no chairs in the back, just a large throne.\
    \ He also seems to have regarded himself as an expert on all manner of subjects.\
    \ Here is Cornwell:\n\u201CIf he showed signs of grandiosity it was in his tendency\
    \ to expatiate on an ever expanding range of topics. So numerous and so beyond\
    \ his competence were these specialised talks, or \u2018allocutions\u2019, that\
    \ the practice seemed symptomatic of ripening delusions of omniscience. He lectured\
    \ visiting groups on subjects such as dentistry, gymnastics, gynaecology, aeronautics,\
    \ cinematography, psychology, psychiatry, agriculture, plastic surgery, and the\
    \ art of newscasting. A visitor to his study once remarked on the piles of fat\
    \ manuals around his desk; Pacelli responded that he was preparing a talk on gas\
    \ central heating. When T S Eliot, arguably the leading English-language poet\
    \ and literary critic of his day, came to the Vatican for a private audience in\
    \ 1948, Pacelli delivered him a lecture on literature.\u201D\nAll of which makes\
    \ me realise that the late Anthony Burgess would have made an absolutely terrific\
    \ Pope.\n\nPius XII's soutane and Anthony Burgess, who ought to have worn one\
    \ like it"
