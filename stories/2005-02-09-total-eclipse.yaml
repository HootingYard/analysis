  text: 'One day, after a huge breakfast, Ignapfando had a total eclipse of the heart,
    just like that songstress whose name escapes me. He did not look as if it was
    happening. Indeed to the untrained eye Ignapfando looked as if he was asleep,
    rather than in the throes of convulsive emotional turmoil accompanied by strident
    rock music. Adding to the disjuncture was the fact that Ignapfando resembled Clement
    Attlee, down to the finicky moustache and an inadvisable line in hats. Nevertheless,
    when he went to his priest for confession the following Sunday, there could be
    no doubt about the upheavals of his passion.

    "Bless me father for I have sinned," he pleaded as he knelt facing the grille
    behind which the priest sat clutching his rosary beads and wishing he was Montgomery
    Clift in I Confess. "I have had a total eclipse of the heart."

    "Let me stop you there, my child," murmured the priest, "I have heard enough.
    Say three Our Fathers, four Hail Marys, and one An Evil Cradling by Brian Keenan.
    Now get you gone."

    Ignapfando left the confessional. Soon afterwards, so did the priest, his own
    heart not so much in total eclipse as heavy with the weight of the fat black sins
    he had had to listen to all morning. Terrible, terrible sins, of impiety and vainglory
    and greed, of abandonment and lust, of twiddly Moog synthesiser solos, rapine,
    pillage and wrack. He imagined each sin as a lump of lead, and he stuffed them
    all into a sack. It was a burlap sack, tied up with a knot, and he hoisted it
    onto his back. His back was broad, and his shoulders were strong, and he carried
    the sack through all the day long, the sack of sins as black as his heart, and
    at nightfall he tossed it onto a cart. He reined up his horse in the milky moon''s
    glow, and off he rode with the sack on the cart. Ignapfando tossed and turned
    in his attic of sin with his total eclipse of the heart.

    Dawn came. Ignapfando awoke refreshed, all sin washed away, a man who now was
    pure. Far, far away on the road to the lime kilns, the priest with his horse and
    cart and sack full of sin had stopped to drink water from a stream. It was a pretty
    rill. As if in a dream, the songstress appeared, standing in the long grass, dressed
    in no longer fashionable glam finery. There was a sudden din. Was it the music
    of the spheres as conceived in the Mind of Brian May? The priest clapped his hands
    over his ears, his horse reared up in terror, and the burlap sack exploded, its
    incandescence vapourising the sun, the blast almost as loud as the songstress
    and her band, belting out her anthem.

    This much have I seen. This much have I heard.'
