  text: "Our quote of the day last Saturday (5th February) was from Cosmic Friends\
    \ by Jimmy Goddard, a splendid little twelve-page pamphlet I acquired many years\
    \ ago. The person who gave it to me assured me that it was a work of genius, and\
    \ I agree. Goddard explains how his teenage interest in communication with extraterrestrial\
    \ beings was nurtured when he joined the STAR Fellowship, an organisation founded\
    \ by Tony Wedd of Chiddingstone in Kent. Apparently, Wedd had received a greeting\
    \ from space people, who \u201Ccommunicated\u201D the words Yava Hoosita! to him.\
    \ Goddard later deciphered the letters YH, upside down, in the static of a video\
    \ recording: \u201CI could never with certainty say it was not a coincidental\
    \ interference pattern, but it did seem like a final seal of approval for my ideas\
    \ on thought communication\u201D.\nElsewhere in this magnificent pamphlet, Goddard\
    \ explains his discovery that he is \u201Cvirtually living on half a brain\u201D\
    , how he suspects that a couple on a package holiday in Holland may have been\
    \ space people because they spoke in \u201Can accent my parents could not place\u201D\
    \ and did not carry British passports, and how his wife Doris sees, one night,\
    \ \u201Ctwo starlike objects wheeling and turning about in a very birdlike motion\u201D\
    . Doris thinks they're birds, but her husband has other ideas about this \u201C\
    sighting\u201D.\nThese days, Jimmy Goddard has a superb suite (if that's the word)\
    \ of webpages, which are well worth a visit. The late lamented Tony Wedd has his\
    \ own nook therein, where you can find out more about the STAR Fellowship. Yava\
    \ Hoosita!\n\nTony Wedd, editor of The Crow"
