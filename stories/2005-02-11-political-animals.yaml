  text: "It is always worth keeping an eye on Hansard, the official record of parliamentary\
    \ debates. Every so often, among all the blather, there is a spot of illumination.\
    \ Here, for example, is an exchange from yesterday:\nMr. John Randall (Uxbridge)\
    \ (Con): The Minister claimed that the Labour Government have been good for birds.\
    \ What are their plans for cormorants?\nMr. Bradshaw: Cormorants are one of the\
    \ species that have done extremely well in the past twenty years\u2026 even if\
    \ the maximum number of licences were issued, the cormorant population would still\
    \ be far higher than it was under the Tories.\nThe idea that enfranchised cormorants\
    \ and other birds would be natural Labour voters reminds me of a long-ago comment\
    \ in the house journal of countryside bloodlust, The Field: \u201CIf foxes could\
    \ hear all sides in the debate on hunting, I think they would vote solidly for\
    \ its continuance.\u201D A similar sentiment was expressed in a letter to the\
    \ Sussex Express & County Herald: \u201CI am convinced that if a fox could vote,\
    \ he would vote Conservative.\u201D"
