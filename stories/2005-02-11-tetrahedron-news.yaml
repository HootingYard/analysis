  text: "So who are they, these people who live on the tetrahedron-earth millions\
    \ of years hence? (See below, 8th February). I asked Glyn Webster to tell me.\
    \ He says:\n\u201CYou don't need me to tell you what sort of people will live\
    \ on the tetrahedron! First, M C Escher himself made a woodcut of the tetrahedral\
    \ world of the future, Tetrahedral Planetoid, 1954. According to the Chrysler\
    \ Museum of Art, \u201Din this print Escher imagined a small planet in the shape\
    \ of a tetrahedron, or pyramid. Two of the four surfaces are visible and show\
    \ houses, gardens, trees, roads, and even people.\u201C Escher etched in immense\
    \ detail, so if you were to get close enough to Tetrahedral Planetoid with a magnifying\
    \ glass you should be able to see just the sort of people who will live on the\
    \ tetrahedron. There's not enough detail in this reproduction for me to see the\
    \ people too closely, but it is safe to assume they are able to survive their\
    \ straitened circumstances by virtue of their very strong Bomba.\n\n\u201CNext,\
    \ from Carlos A Furuti's excellent Cartographical Map Projections pages I read\
    \ that the tetrahedral world of the future will be a very relaxed world for cartographers:\
    \ \u201DMost cartographic problems would disappear if the Earth were a polyhedron\u201C\
    , says Furuti, and Tetrahedral \u201Dglobes\u201C are very easy to manufacture.\
    \ Furuti provides simple paper models that can be printed and given to tots to\
    \ cut out and fold up on rainy days.\u201D\nSo now we know. Nothing there about\
    \ rocket booster backpacks, though, which I had hoped would have appeared by about\
    \ 1999. I'm still waiting."
