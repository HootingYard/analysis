  text: '"Their indoor clothing defies my description. I can only say that the colours
    they wore dazzled me, and that I was almost deafened by the jangling of beads
    when they moved. In contrast to this was their dress when they worked out-of-doors,
    as they frequently did. Then they wore duffle coats with hoods, trousers, and
    very often gum-boots. They might have been mistaken for industrious gnomes." --
