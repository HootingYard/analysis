  text: "\u201CTheir indoor clothing defies my description. I can only say that the\
    \ colours they wore dazzled me, and that I was almost deafened by the jangling\
    \ of beads when they moved. In contrast to this was their dress when they worked\
    \ out-of-doors, as they frequently did. Then they wore duffle coats with hoods,\
    \ trousers, and very often gum-boots. They might have been mistaken for industrious\
    \ gnomes.\u201D \u2014 Miles Burton, Death In A Duffle Coat"
