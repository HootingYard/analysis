  text: "\u201CTrue festivity is called salt, and such it should be, giving a smart\
    \ but savoury relish to discourse; exciting an appetite, not irritating disgust;\
    \ cleansing sometimes, but never creating a sore: and if it become thus insipid,\
    \ or unsavoury, it is therefore good for nothing, but to be cast out, and trodden\
    \ under foot of men. Such jesting which doth not season wholesome or harmless\
    \ discourse, but giveth a haut gout to putrid and poisonous stuff, gratifying\
    \ distempered palates and corrupt stomachs, is indeed odious and despicable folly,\
    \ to be cast out with loathing, to be trodden under foot with contempt.\u201D\
