  text: '"True festivity is called salt, and such it should be, giving a smart but
    savoury relish to discourse; exciting an appetite, not irritating disgust; cleansing
    sometimes, but never creating a sore: and if it become thus insipid, or unsavoury,
    it is therefore good for nothing, but to be cast out, and trodden under foot of
    men. Such jesting which doth not season wholesome or harmless discourse, but giveth
    a haut gout to putrid and poisonous stuff, gratifying distempered palates and
    corrupt stomachs, is indeed odious and despicable folly, to be cast out with loathing,
    to be trodden under foot with contempt." -- Isaac Barrow, Sermons On Evil-Speaking'
