  text: 'To become unbecoming, you must learn what is meet--which is moot--and then
    go against it. Get a book of etiquette. Where it says do, don''t, and where it
    says don''t, do. When you can do or don''t with practised ease your conduct will
    be unbecoming. To become becoming again, simply undo the don''ts and do''s. By
    the by, why what is meet is moot is because conventions vary. And remember your
    catechismus:

    Q--What do I not give for convention?

    A--A jot'
