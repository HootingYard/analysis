  text: '" ''Nellie,'' he commanded sternly, ''replace that receptacle where you found
    it. As you surmise, it contains a substance of incalculable value--the first practical
    preparation of Zapt''s Repulsive Paste.''... Sargent crossed to gaze into the
    little bucket his fiancee was holding. ''Does look sort of repulsive,'' he agreed
    after a glance at the mess in the bottom of the pail. ''But--you mean this stuff
    is responsible for Fluffy''s sudden elevation in life?'' " -- J U Giesy, Zapt''s
    Repulsive Paste'
