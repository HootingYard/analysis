  text: 'Here is what to do. Get a pig''s head and place it on top of a stone. This
    will protect you from thunder and lightning. When you''ve done that, go to your
    nearest pig pen. Leaning on the fence, sing songs in celebration of the fertility
    of pigs. If you do not know any such songs, make one up. After lunch, bury the
    rest of the pig whose head is atop the stone, except for its feet. You will probably
    have eaten the head and the feet for lunch, with or without a garnish. Make sure
    you refrain from needlework all day, and don''t drink when you are at home. Keep
    an eye on the weather. If it is foggy, start gathering sandbags, for soon there
    will be floods. At all times bear in mind that you are in Ancient Latvia and that
    today is Tanis Diena, the sacred pig holiday.
