  text: '"At first Mark meditated upon bishops...[He] must needs fix his contemplation
    upon a certain Bishop of Bingen who was eaten by rats. Mark could not remember
    why he was eaten by rats, but he could with dreadful distinctness remember that
    the prelate escaped to a castle on an island in the middle of the Rhine, and that
    the rats swam after him and swarmed in by every window until his castle was--ugh!--Mark
    tried to banish from his mind the picture of the wicked Bishop Hatto and the rats,
    millions of them, just going to eat him up." -- Compton MacKenzie, The Altar Steps'
