  text: "\u201CAt first Mark meditated upon bishops\u2026[He] must needs fix his contemplation\
    \ upon a certain Bishop of Bingen who was eaten by rats. Mark could not remember\
    \ why he was eaten by rats, but he could with dreadful distinctness remember that\
    \ the prelate escaped to a castle on an island in the middle of the Rhine, and\
    \ that the rats swam after him and swarmed in by every window until his castle\
    \ was\u2014ugh!\u2014Mark tried to banish from his mind the picture of the wicked\
    \ Bishop Hatto and the rats, millions of them, just going to eat him up.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Compton MacKenzie, The Altar Steps"
