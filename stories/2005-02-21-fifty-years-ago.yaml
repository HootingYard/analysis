  text: 'Hard to credit, but it was exactly fifty years ago today that Dobson, the
    out-of-print pamphleteer, made his one and only appearance on the radio. He was
    booked to appear on the then popular show Bad Gas And Forts, a sort of uncategorisable
    hour of talk, static and field recordings hosted by an anonymous spook known only
    as The Gravel-Voiced Ghoul.

    Dobson''s participation was the result of a long campaign by Marigold Chew, who
    spent months standing outside the producer''s office building, holding a flag
    and haranguing passers-by to sign a petition. The producer had sworn an oath that
    Dobson would never appear on the show, apparently because of some otherwise forgotten
    incident involving a rowing boat and a flock of bitterns. Marigold Chew was eventually
    able to prove that the oath contravened the ancient law of civil and pursuivant
    debaling, and it was struck down by magisterium bossa nova in Chancery.

    The show was broadcast live, and no recording was made. However, by pasting together
    the shreds of a hastily-scribbled transcription, it is possible to get some idea
    of what took place. The Ghoul''s first guest was an elderly writer who had defected
    from the Soviet Union. In the immediate post-revolutionary period, he had written
    a series of heart-warming tales about a peasant family under the title Little
    Yurt On The Tundra. With the suppression of the kulaks, and under pressure from
    the Comintern, he rewrote these works as Little Foundry On The Collective Farm.
    If the transcript is reliable, the remarks he made were punctuated by loud hammering
    noises.

    After about ten minutes, the Gravel-Voiced Ghoul introduced Dobson. Asked to continue
    the theme of cloying family-centred story-telling, the pamphleteer embarked on
    a lengthy anecdote about the books his ma read to him as a child. Here, as far
    as can be pieced together, is what he said:

    "My ma was a huge fan of detective fiction, so my bedtime stories tended to be
    whatever she was reading at the time. One of her favourites was Dorothy Sleet,
    who wrote a series of whodunits featuring Rex Shroud, Orrery Sleuth. Shroud was
    a sleuth all of whose cases involved an orrery at some point in the story. What
    is that hammering noise? Sleet created one of the classic detectives, I think.
    He may not be quite on a par with M P Shiel''s Prince Zaleski, but she put a lot
    of thought into giving the Orrery Sleuth all sorts of idiosyncrasies to make him
    a memorable and fully-rounded character, not just a solver of puzzles. He has
    a false lung, too many teeth, and is a daily practitioner of Baxterism. His lantern
    is ruby red. At moments of high desperation, he will invariably fiddle about with
    a little tin of talcum powder. He keeps blotting paper in his pocket and that
    hammering is really getting on my nerves. Perhaps the best story Dorothy Sleet
    ever wrote was The Orrery Sleuth And The Pod People From The Weird Parallel World
    Out Of Time And Space. You think you''re reading science fiction, but that''s
    just narrative pyrotechnics. It is, I think, both valiant and boisterous, as the
    best prose always tries to be. She was a woman of baleful countenance, Dorothy
    Sleet, and kept many tortoises in her seaside bungalow. She married four times,
    and each of her husbands vanished unaccountably. The first three simply vapourised
    in the kitchen while making omelettes, and the fourth was last seen in Ireland,
    in the vicinity of the Wobbling Virgin of Ballinspittle."

    At this point the hammering noises drowned out Dobson. By the time they stopped,
    the show had come to an end, and listeners were treated to a concert by Xavier
    Cugat and His Orchestra. Dobson never received a fee for his appearance. Some
    years later, he and the Gravel-Voiced Ghoul passed each other in the street. They
    did not acknowledge each other.
