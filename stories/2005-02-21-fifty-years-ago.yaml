  text: "Hard to credit, but it was exactly fifty years ago today that Dobson, the\
    \ out-of-print pamphleteer, made his one and only appearance on the radio. He\
    \ was booked to appear on the then popular show Bad Gas And Forts, a sort of uncategorisable\
    \ hour of talk, static and field recordings hosted by an anonymous spook known\
    \ only as The Gravel-Voiced Ghoul.\nDobson's participation was the result of a\
    \ long campaign by Marigold Chew, who spent months standing outside the producer's\
    \ office building, holding a flag and haranguing passers-by to sign a petition.\
    \ The producer had sworn an oath that Dobson would never appear on the show, apparently\
    \ because of some otherwise forgotten incident involving a rowing boat and a flock\
    \ of bitterns. Marigold Chew was eventually able to prove that the oath contravened\
    \ the ancient law of civil and pursuivant debaling, and it was struck down by\
    \ magisterium bossa nova in Chancery.\nThe show was broadcast live, and no recording\
    \ was made. However, by pasting together the shreds of a hastily-scribbled transcription,\
    \ it is possible to get some idea of what took place. The Ghoul's first guest\
    \ was an elderly writer who had defected from the Soviet Union. In the immediate\
    \ post-revolutionary period, he had written a series of heart-warming tales about\
    \ a peasant family under the title Little Y\xFCrt On The Tundra. With the suppression\
    \ of the kulaks, and under pressure from the Comintern, he rewrote these works\
    \ as Little Foundry On The Collective Farm. If the transcript is reliable, the\
    \ remarks he made were punctuated by loud hammering noises.\nAfter about ten minutes,\
    \ the Gravel-Voiced Ghoul introduced Dobson. Asked to continue the theme of cloying\
    \ family-centred story-telling, the pamphleteer embarked on a lengthy anecdote\
    \ about the books his ma read to him as a child. Here, as far as can be pieced\
    \ together, is what he said:\n\u201CMy ma was a huge fan of detective fiction,\
    \ so my bedtime stories tended to be whatever she was reading at the time. One\
    \ of her favourites was Dorothy Sleet, who wrote a series of whodunits featuring\
    \ Rex Shroud, Orrery Sleuth. Shroud was a sleuth all of whose cases involved an\
    \ orrery at some point in the story. What is that hammering noise? Sleet created\
    \ one of the classic detectives, I think. He may not be quite on a par with M\
    \ P Shiel's Prince Zaleski, but she put a lot of thought into giving the Orrery\
    \ Sleuth all sorts of idiosyncrasies to make him a memorable and fully-rounded\
    \ character, not just a solver of puzzles. He has a false lung, too many teeth,\
    \ and is a daily practitioner of Baxterism. His lantern is ruby red. At moments\
    \ of high desperation, he will invariably fiddle about with a little tin of talcum\
    \ powder. He keeps blotting paper in his pocket and that hammering is really getting\
    \ on my nerves. Perhaps the best story Dorothy Sleet ever wrote was The Orrery\
    \ Sleuth And The Pod People From The Weird Parallel World Out Of Time And Space.\
    \ You think you're reading science fiction, but that's just narrative pyrotechnics.\
    \ It is, I think, both valiant and boisterous, as the best prose always tries\
    \ to be. She was a woman of baleful countenance, Dorothy Sleet, and kept many\
    \ tortoises in her seaside bungalow. She married four times, and each of her husbands\
    \ vanished unaccountably. The first three simply vapourised in the kitchen while\
    \ making omelettes, and the fourth was last seen in Ireland, in the vicinity of\
    \ the Wobbling Virgin of Ballinspittle.\u201D\nAt this point the hammering noises\
    \ drowned out Dobson. By the time they stopped, the show had come to an end, and\
    \ listeners were treated to a concert by Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra. Dobson\
    \ never received a fee for his appearance. Some years later, he and the Gravel-Voiced\
    \ Ghoul passed each other in the street. They did not acknowledge each other.\n\
    \nA Philosopher Giving That Lecture On The Orrery In Which A Lamp Is Put In Place\
    \ Of The Sun by Joseph Wright, 1766. An orrery is called an orrery because one\
    \ of the first ones was made for Charles Boyle (1676-1731), the Fourth Earl of\
    \ Orrery."
