  text: 'I had too much to dream last night, and for once I didn''t dream about my
    weak and not good Bomba. I dreamed about an electric prune, and it looked like
    this:


    It was shouting "The Kol Nidre! The Kol Nidre!", whatever that might mean, and
    then it was joined by two more prunes, equally electrified:


    I was somehow aware that I was in the middle of a dream, and I was desperate to
    wake up. I had a feeling of terror that these prunes would begin to celebrate
    a Mass, not necessarily a Black Mass but perhaps something worse, a Mass in F
    Minor. I was sure it would be portentous and horrifying, but I was powerless to
    stop it. I think I may have been chewing my pillow and beating my puny fists on
    the mattress. Suddenly yet another electric prune came shimmering into view:


    There was a heavy, rumbling sound, redolent of uberprog. The phrase "release of
    an oath" hammered through my brain, over and over again. The dream was becoming
    a nightmare. I yearned for some kind of respite. I sensed that a fifth prune,
    as electric as the others, would push forward to haunt me. It did, and there they
    all were, lined up in a row:


    Time seemed to go into reverse. That hideous noise became delightful, chirpy,
    sweetly innocent yet somehow a little bonkers. It was a bit like pop music, but
    not quite. Now all became clear. Despite my weak and not good Bomba, I was as
    one with the children of rain, the children of sand. I woke up to a sparkling
    morning, my soul refreshed, my Bomba in fine fettle.'
