  text: '"Two monks took the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week; this
    they put into a phial, one side of which consisted of a thin, transparent crystal;
    the other thick and opaque; the dark side was shown until the sinner''s gold was
    exhausted, when, presto! change, the blood appeared by turning the other side

    disease known to man." -- Alfred Wesley Wishart, A Short History Of Monks And
