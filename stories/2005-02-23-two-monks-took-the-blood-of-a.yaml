  text: '"Two monks took the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week; this
    they put into a phial, one side of which consisted of a thin, transparent crystal;
    the other thick and opaque; the dark side was shown until the sinner''s gold was
    exhausted, when, presto! change, the blood appeared by turning the other side
    of the phial. Innumerable toe-parings, bones, pieces of skin, three heads of St.
    Ursula, and other anatomical relics of departed saints, were said to cure every
    disease known to man." -- Alfred Wesley Wishart, A Short History Of Monks And
    Monasteries'
