  text: "\u201CTwo monks took the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week;\
    \ this they put into a phial, one side of which consisted of a thin, transparent\
    \ crystal; the other thick and opaque; the dark side was shown until the sinner's\
    \ gold was exhausted, when, presto! change, the blood appeared by turning the\
    \ other side of the phial. Innumerable toe-parings, bones, pieces of skin, three\
    \ heads of St. Ursula, and other anatomical relics of departed saints, were said\
    \ to cure every disease known to man.\u201D \u2014 Alfred Wesley Wishart, A Short\
    \ History Of Monks And Monasteries"
