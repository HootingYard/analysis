  text: "Alfred Wesley Wishart's phrase \u201Ctwo monks took the blood of a duck\u201D\
    , which appears above in today's quotation, was appropriated by the poet Dennis\
    \ Beerpint as the title of a lengthy, as-yet-unpublished work. It may be that\
    \ he is still writing it, but our regular Beerpint-watcher, Dan Sprawl, is currently\
    \ in hospital with a case of jangling cav and pag, so news is limited.\nWhat we\
    \ do know is that the prose-poem compares the image of monks draining blood from\
    \ a duck with the concept of being \u201Cwashed in the blood of the lamb\u201D\
    . Here is an extract:\nThen Brother Fabrizius strangled another teal. \u201CHand\
    \ me that retort, Brother Arpad, so that I may decant into it this teal's gore.\u201D\
    \ Brother Arpad reached for the retort and in so doing smashed an alembic. There\
    \ was a sound of bells. The monks were called to compline. For each canonical\
    \ hour they allocated a duck to be slaughtered for its blood. At compline, a teal.\
    \ At matins, a merganser. At prime, a pintail. At tierce, a shoveler. At sext,\
    \ a wigeon. At nones, a smew. And at vespers, a bufflehead. Out in the fields,\
    \ sweet little lambs gambolled and frolicked. They would not frolic for long,\
    \ for soon, in the monastery, it would be bathtime."
