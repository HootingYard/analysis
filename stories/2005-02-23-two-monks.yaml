  text: 'Alfred Wesley Wishart''s phrase "two monks took the blood of a duck", which
    appears above in today''s quotation, was appropriated by the poet Dennis Beerpint
    as the title of a lengthy, as-yet-unpublished work. It may be that he is still
    writing it, but our regular Beerpint-watcher, Dan Sprawl, is currently in hospital
    with a case of jangling cav and pag, so news is limited.

    What we do know is that the prose-poem compares the image of monks draining blood
    from a duck with the concept of being "washed in the blood of the lamb". Here
    is an extract:

    Then Brother Fabrizius strangled another teal. "Hand me that retort, Brother Arpad,
    so that I may decant into it this teal''s gore." Brother Arpad reached for the
    retort and in so doing smashed an alembic. There was a sound of bells. The monks
    were called to compline. For each canonical hour they allocated a duck to be slaughtered
    for its blood. At compline, a teal. At matins, a merganser. At prime, a pintail.
    At tierce, a shoveler. At sext, a wigeon. At nones, a smew. And at vespers, a
    bufflehead. Out in the fields, sweet little lambs gambolled and frolicked. They
    would not frolic for long, for soon, in the monastery, it would be bathtime.'
