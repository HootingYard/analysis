  text: In a bog, we find Blodgett. We steal upon him when he does not expect us.
    He is floundering in the bog, a clumsy giant. One of us says, "Blodgett, you have
    mud in your beard". Blodgett fains not to hear. He puffs and grunts. As he splutters,
    bits of dried mud fall out of his beard. "How long have you been in that bog,
    Blodgett?" we ask, in unison. Now Blodgett scowls. His spectacles are mysteriously
    agleam, in spite of the muck in which he wallows. He does not reply. With great
    groans, he hoists himself almost to his feet, before falling back into the bog
    with a mighty splash. Now there is some mud on his spectacles too. "Blodgett,
    Blodgett, there is mud on your spectacles," we sing, to a little tune we have
    devised for such an occasion. This causes Blodgett to growl. He sounds like a
    hog. We toss him one end of a rope. Desmond ties the other end of the rope to
    the trunk of a nearby sycamore. "Blodgett, pull yourself out of the bog using
    the rope!" we cry. None of us can remember the rest of our tune. Blodgett's hat
    has fallen off his head. He tries to wipe the mud off his spectacles with a fat
    finger, but only makes a smudge. Clouds scud across the sky. They are black and
    bring rain. Poor Blodgett flops around in the bog. He does not use our rope, for
    he does not know we are there. No matter how loud we shout his name, he cannot
    hear us. Even if his spectacles were not smudged, he could not see us. We are
    always here at the edge of the bog, through days and nights in every season of
    the year. But we are tiny children, and we are ghosts.
