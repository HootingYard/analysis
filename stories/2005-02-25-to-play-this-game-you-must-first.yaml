  text: "\u201CTo play this game you must first decide which one of you is to be the\
    \ Bird-catcher; the other players then each choose the name of a bird, but no\
    \ one must choose the owl, as it is forbidden. All the players then sit in a circle\
    \ with their hands on their knees, except the Bird-catcher, who stands in the\
    \ centre, and tells a tale about birds, taking care to specially mention the ones\
    \ he knows to have been chosen by the company. As each bird's name is called,\
    \ the owner must imitate its note as well as he can, but when the owl is named,\
    \ all hands must be put behind the chairs, and remain there until the next bird's\
    \ name is mentioned. When the Bird-catcher cries \u201CAll the birds,\u201D the\
    \ players must together give their various imitations of birds. Should any player\
    \ fail to give the cry when his bird is named, or forget to put his hands behind\
    \ his chair, he has to change places with the Bird-catcher.\u201D \u2014 Clarence\
