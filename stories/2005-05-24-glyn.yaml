  text: 'In the Antipodes, Glyn Webster has not been idle. He has spent valuable time
    devising Hooting Yard Scrabble(r), the rules of which he expounds as follows:

    Glyn has also produced what he calls a "cheatsheet" containing all permitted words
    in Hooting Yard Scrabble(r), which readers can pore over with breathless enthusiasm

    these are spellings--often archaic--which appear in quoted passages, rather than
    infelicities of my own. Should you be able to drag yourself away from Glyn''s
    majestic wordlist, there will be further news from correspondents tomorrow, together
    with an introduction to an ancient mystic art of which Pansy Cradledew has become
    an Adept...'
