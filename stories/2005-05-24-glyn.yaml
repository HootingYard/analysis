  text: "In the Antipodes, Glyn Webster has not been idle. He has spent valuable time\
    \ devising Hooting Yard Scrabble\xAE, the rules of which he expounds as follows:\n\
    1. Acronyms, Roman numerals, proper nouns and non-English words are allowed.\n\
    2. Ordinary tiles may be used to represent accented letters.\n3. The blank tiles\
    \ may be used to represent apostrophes, ligatures or non-Roman letters.\n4. Any\
    \ word previously made up by Frank Key is acceptable.\n5. A misspelt word is acceptable,\
    \ providing that the misspelling appears in the canon of Frank Key.\n6. If Frank\
    \ Key creates a new written work in the course of a game he must replace all the\
    \ tiles on his rack.\nGlyn has also produced what he calls a \u201Ccheatsheet\u201D\
    \ containing all permitted words in Hooting Yard Scrabble\xAE, which readers can\
    \ pore over with breathless enthusiasm here. I feel I ought to point out that,\
    \ when rule five refers to misspellings, these are spellings\u2014often archaic\u2014\
    which appear in quoted passages, rather than infelicities of my own. Should you\
    \ be able to drag yourself away from Glyn's majestic wordlist, there will be further\
    \ news from correspondents tomorrow, together with an introduction to an ancient\
    \ mystic art of which Pansy Cradledew has become an Adept\u2026"
