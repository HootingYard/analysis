  text: "Velma Nebraska forwarded this:\nFor lovers of good writing, listed below\
    \ are the ten winners of this year's Bulwer-Lytton Contest, aka the \u201CDark\
    \ and Stormy Night Contest\u201D run by the English Department of San Jose State\
    \ University, wherein one writes only the first line of a bad novel:\n10. \u201C\
    As a scientist, Throckmorton knew that if he were ever to break wind in the echo\
    \ chamber, he would never hear the end of it.\u201D\n9. \u201CJust beyond the\
    \ Narrows, the river widens.\u201D\n8. \u201CWith a curvaceous figure that Venus\
    \ would have envied, a tanned, unblemished oval face framed with lustrous thick\
    \ brown hair, deep azure-blue eyes fringed with long black lashes, perfect teeth\
    \ that vied for competition, and a small straight nose, Marilee had a beauty that\
    \ defied description.\u201D\n7. \u201CAndre, a simple peasant, had only one thing\
    \ on his mind as he crept along the East wall: \u2018Andre creep\u2026 Andre creep\u2026\
    \ Andre creep.\u2019\u201D\n6. \u201CStanislaus Smedley, a man always on the cutting\
    \ edge of narcissism, was about to give his body and soul to a back alley sex-change\
    \ surgeon to become the woman he loved.\u201D\n5. \u201CAlthough Sarah had an\
    \ abnormal fear of mice, it did not keep her from ekeing out a living at a local\
    \ pet store.\u201D\n4. \u201CStanley looked quite bored and somewhat detached,\
    \ but then penguins often do.\u201D\n3. \u201CLike an over-ripe beefsteak tomato\
    \ rimmed with cottage cheese, the corpulent remains of Santa Claus lay dead on\
    \ the hotel floor.\u201D\n2. \u201CMike Hardware was the kind of private eye who\
    \ didn't know the meaning of the word \u2018fear\u2019; a man who could laugh\
    \ in the face of danger and spit in the eye of death\u2014in short, a moron with\
    \ suicidal tendencies.\u201D\n1. \u201CThe sun oozed over the horizon, shoved\
    \ aside darkness, crept along the greensward, and, with sickly fingers, pushed\
    \ through the castle window, revealing the pillaged princess, hand at throat,\
    \ crown asunder, gaping in frenzied horror at the sated, sodden amphibian lying\
    \ beside her, disbelieving the magnitude of the frog's deception, screaming madly,\
    \ \u2018You lied!\u2019\u201D"
