  text: '"For whereas in the beginning of the world, the heavens, and earth, and Elements
    were settled in their natural places, the earth being left slimy and soft in many
    places, and then dried and stricken with the heat of the Sun, brought forth certain
    tumours and swellings in the surface and uppermost parts. In these tumours were
    contained and cherished many Putrefactions and rotten clods, covered over with
    certain small skins, this putrefied stuff, being moistened with dew by night,
    and the Sun heating it by day, after a certain season became ripe, and the skins
    being broken, thence issued all kinds of living creatures, whereof, they that
    had quickest heat, became Birds, the earthy ones became creeping beasts, the waterish
    ones became Fishes in the sea, and they which were mean, as it were, between all
    these, became walking-creatures." -- Giambattista Della Porta, The Second Book
    Of Natural Magick'
