  text: "Continuing with correspondence received during Hooting Yard's break, the\
    \ estimable Max D\xE9charn\xE9 sent this:\nSome years back I bought an old book\
    \ called New Familiar and Progressive English and French Dialogues (With Dialogues\
    \ on Railway and Steamboat Travelling, and a Comparative Table of Monies and Measure)\
    \ by Richard and Quetin, published by Hachette, 1876, which I was recently looking\
    \ through again, and it remains one of the finest phrase books I've ever encountered.\n\
    Some of it sounds like the dialogue from a porn film: \u2018You oblige me in so\
    \ willing a manner, that it encourages me to apply to you again and again\u2019\
    , \u2018I am delighted that you make use of me so freely\u2019, \u2018You may\
    \ dispose of me as you will\u2019, \u2018It is impossible to do a favour in a\
    \ more pleasing manner\u2019 'I have never experienced such satisfaction', \u2018\
    I believe I shall go mad with pleasure\u2019.\nThen there's the section entitled\
    \ \u2018To express horror and fright\u2019: \u2018It is abominable, horrid, infamous\u2019\
    , \u2018It is violating all that is most sacred in nature\u2019, 'It is enough\
    \ to freeze one's blood with horror', \u2018There never was anything seen so abominable\u2019\
    , \u2018The mind revolts from the idea of such a crime\u2019.\nOr perhaps, when\
    \ visiting those tourist spots in Paris, and one feels the need to \u2018express\
    \ dipleasure and grief\u2019: \u2018I am ruined beyond remedy\u2019, \u2018My\
    \ misfortunes are at their height\u2019, \u2018I am swallowed up with affliction\u2019\
    , \u2018After so many misfortunes, it only remains for me to die\u2019.\nThen,\
    \ select phrases for when one chances upon Michael Howard: \u2018His babbling\
    \ absolutely splits my head\u2019, \u2018There is something repulsive in his address\u2019\
    , \u2018It is difficult for me to surmount the disgust with which he inspires\
    \ me\u2019, \u2018Has he sworn to tease us all day?\u2019\nWhen training for a\
    \ post in the Diplomatic Service, there's the useful section headed \u2018of age\
    \ and the different periods of life\u2019: \u2018Your aunt appears very aged\u2019\
    , \u2018His brother, who is younger than he, is quite decrepit\u2019, \u2018He\
    \ is in a state of extreme decay\u2019, \u2018He already has one foot in the grave\u2019\
    \nAnd, of course, these random phrases which might come in useful among friends:\
    \ \u2018What a quantity of asparagus and artichokes!\u2019 'My eldest sister had\
    \ the whooping-cough, the youngest had the measles, my eldest brother the small-pox,\
    \ and the youngest a miliary fever', \u2018Shall I help you to undress?\u2019\
    , \u2018I will take charge of the bread and butter\u2019.\nSplendid stuff from\
    \ Max, as ever. Even more correspondence tomorrow."
