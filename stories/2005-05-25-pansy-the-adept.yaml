  text: 'Here, for your edification and instruction, is a translation of the War Song
    of the Huitznahuac, taken from Rig Veda Americanus, Sacred Songs of the Ancient
    Mexicans, number eight in Brinton''s Library of Aboriginal American Literature,
    edited by D G Brinton (1890):

    1. What ho! my work is in the hall of arms, I listen to no mortal, nor can any
    put me to shame, I know none such, I am the Terror, I know none other, I am where
    war is, my work is said to be in the hall of arms, let no one curse my children.

    2. Our adornment comes from out the south, it is varied in colour as the clothing
    of the eagle.

    3. Ho! ho! abundance of youths doubly clothed, arrayed in feathers, are my captives,
    I deliver them up, I deliver them up, my captives arrayed in feathers.

    4. Ho! youths for the Huitznahuac, arrayed in feathers, these are my captives,
    I deliver them up, I deliver them up, arrayed in feathers, my captives.

    5. Youths from the south, arrayed in feathers, my captives, I deliver them up,
    I deliver them up, arrayed in feathers, my captives.

    6. The god enters, the Huitznahuac, he descends as an example, he shines forth,
    he shines forth, descending as an example.

    7. Adorned like us he enters as a god, he descends as an example, he shines forth,
    he shines forth, descending as an example.

    An adaptation of this song, with slightly amended words, wassailed to the tune
    of Carry On, Wayward Son by stadium rockers Kansas, has been heard around Hooting
    Yard every day for the past couple of months, ever since Pansy Cradledew became
    an Adept of Goon Fang. Often confused with the traditional martial arts of the
    East, Goon Fang is--as David Bowie once said so regrettably--"a completely different
    kettle of poisson". I asked Pansy to explain for readers what it means to be an
    Adept of this ancient mystic art. She scribbled a few words on the discarded wrapper
    of a toffee apple, as follows:

    It is not without reason that Goon Fang is shrouded in mystery, for when the powers
    of both Goon and Fang are combined, the Adept enters the Plane of VerEecke, a
    state of being both terrifying and a bit frightening. If I tell you anything more,
    my Goon energy will be dissipated and my Fang plasma will curdle. The plasma is
    of course invisible, and mighty, but should it curdle the very stars in their
    heavens will explode, so I am keeping mum for the time being.

    Pansy agreed, however, to share with us this photograph of a Goon Fang workshop
    held in a secret location:
