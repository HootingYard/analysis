  text: 'Listen, tiny ones. If you are good I will take you on an outing. I will take
    you to the old balsa wood factory on the edge of the big blue lake. Every Thursday
    afternoon at two o clock, there is a tour of the factory especially for tots.
    The hooters sound and everyone lines up at a kiosk in the car park, and Mister
    Verdigris appears in his towering hat, with bells on his sleeves, and ribbons
    and bunting, and hamsters nestling in his pockets, and he takes the lucky people,
    the ones with tickets, on a tour of the factory.

    I was sent some tickets in the post yesterday, as a special treat. I know that
    Tim the radio meteorologist says that Thursday will be a day of driving rain and
    howling gales, and I know that it will be the fourth day of our fast, and we will
    be famished, but I am determined that we go. The alternative is that we spend
    yet another afternoon trying to tether the wild goats, and I am not sure I can
    take much more of that, so the balsa wood factory it will be.

    * * *

    First there was the grass verge of the car park, and then a lawn, some derelict
    outbuildings, including a shed wherein rotted the remains of the hanged janitor,
    and then the factory itself, its cavernous interior lit by thousands of gas jets,
    and eerily silent save for the occasional buzzing of a saw or the distant, insistent
    pounding of a pulper from the annexe over beyond the railway tracks, a sound borne
    in on the wind.

    After that, up the metal stairway to the offices, always deserted on Thursday
    afternoons, even tiny shoes making the floorboards creak, and shelves upon shelves
    stacked with higgledy-piggledy piles of files and papers and dockets, and Mister
    Verdigris took the hamsters from his pockets and placed them on a bed of straw
    next to an important-looking desk, its surface polished to such a gleam as left
    the children dumbfounded, and resting on it nothing but a fat, new fountain pen
    and the biggest bottle of ink you could imagine, and the pen had never been used
    and the bottle never opened, for the lids of both were jammed by dint of mischievous
    sprites that scampered in the rafters overhead.

    And it was up to the rafters now, up to the attic, past boxes and crates filled
    with rusty and inexplicable machines, redundant cash registers and forgotten magnetic
    recording devices, through a narrow corridor littered with broken brooms, and
    host to a mysterious gurgling noise, until we reached the chamber at the end,
    and our tour guide in his towering hat kicked open the door, so violently!, and
    we entered a room lit in a blue, blue glow, like heaven, and there in the corner,
    sprawled on a divan, we saw Pinocchio, dexterously plucking flies out of the blue
    air with his tiny fingers, and biting the tiny head off each tiny fly with his
    tiny teeth.'
