  text: 'One enticing item that arrived in the post while I was away was from Elizabeth
    Shipley, who kindly sent this fragment from the novel The Clandestine History
    of a Lost Key, Without Which the Boathouse Cannot be Opened Nor the Oratario Performed
    by Miss Eglantine Cadenza:

    Chapter 203 "A Dentist Remember''d"

    Emeritus Professor of Greek Per Eliasen crouches beside the telephone in his Aarhus
    apartment. He has the impression that everyone who rings him is a piano tuner
    from Leighton Buzzard by the name of Ron. He is poised, hungry for Ron''s next

    everything. But it is too late. Already the little dressmaker is there, lurking
    in brine, her extravagant smalls decorously asink. "Hydropathic Cures, 10 Shillings
    a Limb" she insinuates, eyes akimbo.

    [There follows an apparently unrelated recipe for Buttonhooks In Aspic.]

    "You are nothing but a furtive tangoist," breathes Drusilla, greatly daring.

    "BACK one, two, quarter-turn . . ." purrs the sodden sempstress. "Three, four,
    STRAIGHT back, gentleman--"

    "Pah!" cries the hapless Drusilla, striving in vain to stuff her gloves into her
    ears.
