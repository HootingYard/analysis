  text: "One enticing item that arrived in the post while I was away was from Elizabeth\
    \ Shipley, who kindly sent this fragment from the novel The Clandestine History\
    \ of a Lost Key, Without Which the Boathouse Cannot be Opened Nor the Oratario\
    \ Performed by Miss Eglantine Cadenza:\nChapter 203 \u201CA Dentist Remember'd\u201D\
    \nEmeritus Professor of Greek Per Eliasen crouches beside the telephone in his\
    \ Aarhus apartment. He has the impression that everyone who rings him is a piano\
    \ tuner from Leighton Buzzard by the name of Ron. He is poised, hungry for Ron's\
    \ next delphic utterance.\nWhile he waits, he rereads Nella Buck's exquisite first\
    \ novel, Lids Without Jars, Jars Without Lids. He has reached his favourite part,\
    \ wherein Jasper begs Amarinta to acknowledge maternity of his child, and Amarinta\
    \ stabs Jasper in the throat with a tuning fork, and then both wander out to see\
    \ if the post has come. Meanwhile\n[several lines here obliterated by a marmalade\
    \ stain]\nrailway junction.\n\u201CMore cake, darling?\u201D As she passed the\
    \ Battenburg, a peacock drifted beneath his nose. It gave him a cool, appraising\
    \ stare, as if it judged that he might be about to steal its wallet. It then withdrew,\
    \ but not before a flush had risen to his\n[squashed insect here, prob. of the\
    \ order Dermaptera.]\nBy the time of her return to the Public Baths that evening,\
    \ Drusilla Prunt regrets everything. But it is too late. Already the little dressmaker\
    \ is there, lurking in brine, her extravagant smalls decorously asink. \u201C\
    Hydropathic Cures, 10 Shillings a Limb\u201D she insinuates, eyes akimbo.\n[There\
    \ follows an apparently unrelated recipe for Buttonhooks In Aspic.]\n\u201CYou\
    \ are nothing but a furtive tangoist,\u201D breathes Drusilla, greatly daring.\n\
    \u201CBACK one, two, quarter-turn . . .\u201D purrs the sodden sempstress. \u201C\
    Three, four, STRAIGHT back, gentleman--\u201D\n\u201CPah!\u201D cries the hapless\
    \ Drusilla, striving in vain to stuff her gloves into her ears.\n\u201C--gentleman\
    \ starting with his left foot, lady with her\n[The rest of the page appears to\
    \ have been nibbled away.]"
