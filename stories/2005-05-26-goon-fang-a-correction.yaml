  text: 'Further to yesterday''s item Pansy The Adept, Pansy Cradledew has asked me
    to publish the following statement:

    I fear that in your ill-considered witterings about the ancient mystic art of
    Goon Fang, you gave the impression that I am an Adept. There are many--indeed,
    countless--levels of eptness within Goon Fang, and I wish it to be quite clear
    to your readers that I am an Inept. If you do not publish this correction on your
    website, I shall have no choice but to make a visitation to Haemoglobin Towers
    and enact the Goon Fang movement known as The Fluttering Sociopathic Moth-Being,
    guaranteed to give you hideous nightmares for the rest of your life, believe you
    me.'
