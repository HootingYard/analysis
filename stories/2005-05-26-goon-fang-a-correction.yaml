  text: "Further to yesterday's item Pansy The Adept, Pansy Cradledew has asked me\
    \ to publish the following statement:\nI fear that in your ill-considered witterings\
    \ about the ancient mystic art of Goon Fang, you gave the impression that I am\
    \ an Adept. There are many\u2014indeed, countless\u2014levels of eptness within\
    \ Goon Fang, and I wish it to be quite clear to your readers that I am an Inept.\
    \ If you do not publish this correction on your website, I shall have no choice\
    \ but to make a visitation to Haemoglobin Towers and enact the Goon Fang movement\
    \ known as The Fluttering Sociopathic Moth-Being, guaranteed to give you hideous\
    \ nightmares for the rest of your life, believe you me."
