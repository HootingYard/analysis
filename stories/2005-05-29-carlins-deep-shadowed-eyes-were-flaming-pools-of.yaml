  text: '"Carlin''s deep-shadowed eyes were flaming pools of mad menace. ''I could
    shoot you both down where you stand,'' he rasped, ''but that would be a foolish
    waste of valuable material... I shall turn the two of you over to the Dweller
    in the pool!'' Dorothy Lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin''s thin lips writhed
    in a snarling smile... ''Who, or what, is the Dweller in the pool?'' demanded
    Kent, ''And what devil''s work is Carlin doing here anyway?'' ''The Dweller in
    the pool,'' Dorothy answered, her low voice trembling, ''is my brother, Raoul!''
    ... Small wonder that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should combine
    to taint the very air with a shuddering miasma of crepitant dread!" -- Hal K Wells,
    Black Pool For Hell Maidens'
