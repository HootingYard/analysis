  text: "\u201CCarlin's deep-shadowed eyes were flaming pools of mad menace. \u2018\
    I could shoot you both down where you stand,\u2019 he rasped, \u2018but that would\
    \ be a foolish waste of valuable material\u2026 I shall turn the two of you over\
    \ to the Dweller in the pool!\u2019 Dorothy Lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin's\
    \ thin lips writhed in a snarling smile\u2026 \u2018Who, or what, is the Dweller\
    \ in the pool?\u2019 demanded Kent, 'And what devil's work is Carlin doing here\
    \ anyway?' \u2018The Dweller in the pool,\u2019 Dorothy answered, her low voice\
    \ trembling, \u2018is my brother, Raoul!\u2019 \u2026 Small wonder that the throbbing\
    \ agony of so many tortured minds should combine to taint the very air with a\
    \ shuddering miasma of crepitant dread!\u201D \u2014 Hal K Wells, Black Pool For\
    \ Hell Maidens"
