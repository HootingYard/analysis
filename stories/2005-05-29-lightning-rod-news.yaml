    The above graphic is not merely a sensible warning. Glyn Webster (for it is he)
    reminds us that during the American War of Independence there was quite a spat
    between Benjamin Franklin and King George III regarding the correct design of
    lightning rods. Franklin advocated the use of a sharpened end to the rod, which
    many English electricians of the time took issue with. Benjamin Wilson, a member
    of the Royal Court circle of George III, believed that the pointed rod actually
    elicited lightning strikes, and that rods with a rounded sphere were safer. Other
    English colleagues favoured the use of blunt-tipped rods. King George III''s involvement
    in the dispute was politically motivated rather than having any scientific basis.
    As Franklin was one of the signatories to the 1776 American Declaration of Independence,
    the use of sharpened rods was seen to be an upstart Republican idea. Further fuel
    was added to the fire when the Purfleet powder magazine in outer London burnt
    down after a lightning strike, and the Franklin rods were blamed. The King ordered
    that all lightning rods throughout the empire were to have a cannon ball placed
    on the top of them, or be removed.

    You can read more about this exciting dispute here. Meanwhile, if your enthusiasm
    for lightning rods remains unquenched, you really ought to read The Lightning-Rod
    Man by Herman Melville.'
