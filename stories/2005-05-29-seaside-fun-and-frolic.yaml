  text: Hal K Wells, author of today's quotation, above, was always the most measured
    of writers. Black Pool For Hell Maidens--which includes chapters entitled "The
    Clawed Ghoul", "House Of Grisly Fear", and "Mad Pack Of the Maimed" -- was the
    first in his series of guides to British seaside resorts, all of them featuring
    both "hell maidens" and the enigmatic Raoul. Later titles included Skeg Ness For
    Hell Maidens, Tot Nes For Hell Maidens, and Raoul And The Hell Maidens Go Wild
    In Great Yar Mouth.
