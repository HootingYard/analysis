  text: '"By his absolute contempt of law, his inordinate cruelty, his prolonged massacres,
    and his infliction of plagues upon whole peoples, Ezzelino established the ideal
    in Italy of a tyrant marching to his end by any means whatever. In vain was the

    pity-stricken multitudes upon the plain of Paquara to atone with tears and penitence
    for the insults offered to the saints in heaven by Ezzelino''s fury. It laid a
    deep hold upon the Italian imagination, and, by the glamour of loathing that has
    strength to fascinate, proved in the end contagious." -- John Addington Symonds,
