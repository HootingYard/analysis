  text: "\u201CBy his absolute contempt of law, his inordinate cruelty, his prolonged\
    \ massacres, and his infliction of plagues upon whole peoples, Ezzelino established\
    \ the ideal in Italy of a tyrant marching to his end by any means whatever. In\
    \ vain was the humanity of the race revolted by the hideous spectacle. Vainly\
    \ did the monks assemble pity-stricken multitudes upon the plain of Paquara to\
    \ atone with tears and penitence for the insults offered to the saints in heaven\
    \ by Ezzelino's fury. It laid a deep hold upon the Italian imagination, and, by\
    \ the glamour of loathing that has strength to fascinate, proved in the end contagious.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 John Addington Symonds, Renaissance In Italy"
