  text: "\u201CNow and again, it will do you a power of good to spend a Wednesday\
    \ morning tramping along a high ridge, blowing a trumpet and waving a banner.\
    \ If you can persuade others to join you, so much the better. It will not matter\
    \ if you are tuneless and raggle-taggle\u2014the experience itself can pump vital\
    \ energy into your blood, oxygenating your brain and feeding crucial nutriments\
    \ into your integuments.\u201D\nThat is the advice I was given by my mentor, or\
    \ at least by a book handed to me by my mentor on the day I said farewell to him\
    \ for the last time. It was not a day I am likely ever to forget. After the dawn\
    \ calisthenics, we had sausages for breakfast. I have never tasted the like, before\
    \ or since. God only knows what they were made of. Ambrosia, perhaps, or manna.\
    \ My mentor was kind enough, for once, to overlook my disgusting table-manners,\
    \ even going so far as to hand me several extra napkins from his precious supply.\
    \ When I had finished mopping up my drool and spillages, he beckoned me with the\
    \ Claw Of Gack, and we headed off up into the hills to that lair of his which\
    \ until now had been forbidden to me. Had I not eaten such a gigantic breakfast,\
    \ my heart would have been palpitating. As it was, my corporeal being was preoccupied\
    \ with its digestive functions, freeing my brain to do the palpitations.\nOnce\
    \ inside the lair, or cave, my mentor handed me a trumpet and a banner and the\
    \ book which I have already mentioned, and then he vanished in a puff of inexplicable\
    \ roseate vapour. I was alone. I waited for the vapour to disperse and then I\
    \ strode out of the cave\u2026 no, I must not lie, I minced out of the cave, and\
    \ I tumbled down the hillside, battering my trumpet in the process, and I rummaged\
    \ around in my mentor's pantry until I found more sausages, and while I cooked\
    \ them I practiced a few toots on the trumpet, and I read the book\u2014the passage\
    \ quoted above comprises the complete text\u2014and then I unfurled my banner.\
    \ And when I had finished eating all of the sausages, I set out to make my own\
    \ way in the world.\n\nMy banner"
