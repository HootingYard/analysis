  text: "Dobson rarely showed any interest in sport. He did once begin an essay called\
    \ Why We Say \u2018Sport\u2019 & \u2018Maths\u2019 While Americans Say \u2018\
    Sports\u2019 & \u2018Math\u2019, but wrote no more than four or five sentences\
    \ before abandoning it. Marigold Chew gives a fascinating insight into the workings\
    \ of Dobson's pulsating cranium when she describes what happened next:\n\u201C\
    In spite of the fact that he had fed his scribblings into the fire, the mere act\
    \ of writing the words sport and sports two or three times sent Dobson whirling\
    \ off on a new track. It was a morning of torrential rain, as usual, but Dobson\
    \ donned a mackintosh and stomped out of the house. He was gone for hours. When\
    \ he returned, sopping wet, he announced that he intended to write an Encyclopaedia\
    \ of Sport based on an entirely novel classification. Instead of categorising\
    \ sports into team and solo games, those using balls and those eschewing them,\
    \ those that require bats, racquets, sticks and pucks and those that don't, his\
    \ work would instead approach the topic from what he called, immodestly, \u2018\
    a Dobsonian angle\u2019.\n\u201CSwallowing a mouthful of toasted blob-cake, I\
    \ asked him what he meant. He fixed me with those beady yet watery eyes and announced\
    \ that he had, while walking along the lane that leads to the ruinous sump, devised\
    \ six \u2018bags\u2019 of sporting activity; spindly, apprehensive, dashing, clotted,\
    \ baleful and monkey-like. There was no known human sport, he shouted, growing\
    \ hot with excitement, his arms windmilling, which could not be levered into one\
    \ of these categories, and his task would be to draw out the ur-characteristics\
    \ of each pastime.\n\u201CI tipped my plate of cake-crumbs into the sink and asked\
    \ the pamphleteer where, in this system, he would place the various activities\
    \ at a mediaeval tourney, where lusty jocund swains would tilt at bagatelles and\
    \ gambol with partridges et cetera et cetera?\n\u201CDobson did not reply. Later\
    \ that day, by a curious coincidence, he was attacked by a flock of partridges\
    \ while waiting at the bus stop. Thereafter, at least for the next few months,\
    \ all his attention was fixated upon birds, and the sport encyclopaedia was quietly\
    \ forgotten.\u201D\nDevotees of Dobson will of course be aware that the bird-fixation\
    \ period to which Marigold Chew refers resulted in some of the great man's best-loved\
    \ pamphlets, including the matchless How I Was Attacked By A Flock Of Partridges\
    \ At A Bus Stop While On My Way To The Potato Club (out of print).\n\nA mediaeval\
    \ tourney : note the lusty jocund swains a-gambolling"
