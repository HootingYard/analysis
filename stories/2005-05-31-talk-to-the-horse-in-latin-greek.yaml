  text: '"Talk to the horse in Latin, Greek, French, English, or Spanish, or in any
    other language you please. Hold up your foot--''Live la pied''--''Alza el pie''--''Aron
    ton poda,'' etc., at the same time lift his foot with your hand... This operation
    is no magnetism, no galvanism; it is merely taking away the fear a horse generally
    has of a man." -- P R Kincaid & John J Stutzman, The Arabian Art Of Taming And
    Training Wild And Vicious Horses'
