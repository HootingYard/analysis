  text: "Yesterday's mention, in Dobson On Sport, of \u201Clusty jocund swains\u201D\
    \ prompted Poppy Nisbet to telephone me with a pertinent question. \u201CI'm sure\
    \ there is some connection between lusty jocund swains and Joost van Dongelbraacke,\
    \ the suburban shaman,\u201D said Poppy, \u201CAm I right?\u201D I am not, as\
    \ a rule, fond of the telephone, so I grunted and slammed down the receiver. Such\
    \ gracelessness is unforgivable, but in recompense to Ms Nisbet I did some research,\
    \ and find that she is indeed correct.\nThe origins of the connection lie far\
    \ back in time, long before Van Dongelbraacke became the suburban shaman of legend.\
    \ In fact he was still at school, in his final year, about to matriculate from\
    \ Saint Kapisko's Seminary. As was the custom, he was offered an intensive session\
    \ with a careers adviser, who at this time was a perfumed fop with a criminal\
    \ record\u2014but that is irrelevant.\n\u201CSo,\u201D said the fop-adviser, \u201C\
    Have you any idea what you would like to do when you leave here, Joost?\u201D\n\
    The youthful Van Dongelbraacke explained that he had it in mind to become a lusty\
    \ jocose swain.\nFop : Lusty, yes. Swain, agreed. But are you sure about the jocose\
    \ element?\nVan Dongelbraacke : Why yes, sirrah!\nFop : [Applying pomade to his\
    \ almost Pre-Raphaelite tresses] Might I suggest that you opt to become a lusty\
    \ jocund swain rather than a lusty jocose one, Joost?\nVan Dongelbraacke : Gosh.\
    \ If I am to carve out for myself a fulfilling life I shall need to plump for\
    \ one or the other this very day. It is an irrevocable choice, sure enough.\n\
    Fop : You speak the truth, young Joost. Consider, is your lusty swainhood to be\
    \ marked by a fondness for joking, playfulness, waggishness and jocularity? [Seeing\
    \ Van Dongelbraacke frown in concentration, he pauses to let this sink in.] Or\
    \ perhaps what the world will come to expect from you is a lusty swainhood of\
    \ cheerfulness, mirth and merriness, of light-heartedness, pleasantry, cheer and\
    \ delight?\nVan Dongelbraacke : Did you say peasantry?\nFop : [Twirling his outlandish\
    \ moustachioes] No. Pleasantry.\nVan Dongelbraacke : Ah. In that case, my mind\
    \ is made up.\nFop : Be not so impetuous, young tearaway!\nVan Dongelbraacke :\
    \ It is in my nature to be so. I shall henceforth devote the rest of my life to\
    \ being a lusty jocund swain!\nWe know, of course, that Joost Van Dongelbraacke\
    \ deluded himself on this point. Within a week of leaving the seminary, he had\
    \ abandoned his swainhood and was engrossed in the study of pismire ants which\
    \ consumed him for a decade and a half.\nI am very grateful to Poppy Nisbet, for\
    \ raising this subject, and to the staff and custodians of the REO Speedwagon\
    \ Academy of Stadium Rock Twaddle & Applied Historical Research for supplying\
    \ cups of tea and seed cake which made completion of this item particularly soul-sickening."
