  text: 'For too many years to count I travelled the world visiting bottomless viper-pits.
    I studied them, sketched them, photographed them, and wrote up lengthy and detailed
    descriptions of each and every one. My patience is almost inhuman, and it needed
    to be, because sooner or later some well-meaning numbskull would ask, in relation
    to this or that bottomless viper-pit, "Tell me, Professor Bindweed, if the viper-pit
    is bottomless, where in heaven''s name are the vipers?" And each time I would
    sigh, and give my interlocutor a look of saintly forebearance, and reply, "On
    ledges, of course, from very near the top and then at intervals of a few feet
    all the way down!" For in my experience this was invariably the case, from the
    bottomless viper-pit of O''Houlihan''s Wharf to the bottomless viper-pit of San
    Christoboole.

    Then, one day, armed only with the shreds of a map and a flask of brackish water,
    I came upon the bottomless viper-pit of Gaar. One thing you must understand is
    that I had been at this work for so long that very little surprised me anymore.
    So please do not think I am exaggerating when I say that I was thunderstruck,
    bedazzled, giddy and incredulous, for I was all those things and more. The amazing
    thing about the bottomless viper-pit of Gaar was that it had been turned into
    a sort of tourist attraction. A fence had been placed around it, gigantic gaudy
    signs flashed on and off, and fairground music blared out of stacks of loudspeakers.
    To exploit one of the remotest bottomless viper-pits in the world for commercial
    gain seemed wrong to me, and, suddenly drained of my inhuman patience, I marched
    up to the person standing behind the counter of the ticket booth.

    I ranted and raved at him for at least five minutes, shouting my head off and
    flailing my arms, and do you know what? He took absolutely no notice of me. This
    enraged me even further, and I was about to give him a clean, decent sock on the
    jaw when I heard running footsteps behind me and a withered voice croaking "Wait!
    Wait!" I turned to see an unkempt beanpole of a fellow hastening towards me. He
    slowed up, wheezing, and staggered the last few steps.

    "Don''t harm the lad, please, sir. He''s a good worker, takes the cash and hands
    out the tickets. His name is Tommy. He''s a deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays
    a mean pinball." I looked back at the urchin and, sure enough, he bore a striking
    resemblance to Roger Daltrey circa 1969. I harrumphed.

    "Would you be wanting to buy a ticket then, sir?" asked the beanpole.

    I think my reply, a speech based on a lecture I had given at the Bottomless Viper-Pit
    Club Of Helsinki a decade ago, took about an hour to deliver. I am not sure how
    much of what I said got through to the lanky ingrate. I do know that he sat down
    on a nearby tuffet as exhaustion set in, that Tommy packed up and went home, that
    I inserted some new rhetorical tricks into my tirade, that clouds scudded across
    the sun and that the sun itself set before I had finished. My listener had now
    fallen into a deep sleep asprawl his tuffet. Ignoring him, I clambered over the
    wicket gate that the pinball wizard had locked before he left, and approached
    the bottomless viper-pit of Gaar with mounting excitement. It was dark and I had
    no torch, but I picked my way carefully towards the edge of the bottomless viper-pit.
    I laughed aloud with glee as I heard the familiar hiss of countless pit-vipers.
    The years seemed to fall away, and I felt again that tingle of unalloyed happiness
    that I experienced when, as a spindly twelve-year-old, I had accompanied my father
    to the bottomless viper-pit of Shoeburyness, my very first bottomless viper-pit.
    A knot of nostalgia tightened in my stomach. I put my hand up to my hat, and doffed
    it. It was my father''s hat, the one he had given to me on that very day, the
    same hat which he had brandished to ward off a particularly malevolent pit-viper
    that was about to sink its fangs into my heart.

    I doffed my father''s hat, and I plunged into the bottomless viper-pit of Gaar.'
