  text: 'That grumbling complainant Tim Thurn, who seems to read these pages for no
    other reason than to find things to whinge about, has sent in another missive:

    Dear Mr Key, he writes, It is little more than a week since you resuscitated Hooting
    Yard, and in that short time you have written about swans and swains. Do you not
    think it would be better to leave a gap between such near-homophones, say a month
    or two? I cannot be your only reader who has failing eyesight and who can thus
    become confused, when peering at my computer screen, wondering if an item about
    swains is a continuation of some drivel about swans, or vice versa. Yours tetchily,
    Tim Thurn

    All I can say in response is that I hope Tim''s bedizenment was not so great that
    in failing to distinguish between swains and swans he fell into a swoon.'
