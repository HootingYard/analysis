  text: 'The assassination of an important world figure is so shocking that other
    events of the day, including other deaths, get overlooked. A notable example is
    the death of Aldous Huxley on 22nd November 1963. That day, of course, is recalled
    because of what happened near the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas.
    The demise of the astonishingly tall, severely myopic writer went virtually unremarked
    (as, incidentally, did the fact that only a few weeks before, the vacuum cleaner
    salesman who knocked on the door of Huxley''s Los Angeles home was the young Don
    Van Vliet, soon to become known to the world as Captain Beefheart. Never let it
    be said that Hooting Yard is stinting with the facts.)

    There was another death that day that received even less attention, despite the
    fact that the cinema was robbed of one of its most titanic talents. Few today
    remember Walt Dinsey, overshadowed in death by Kennedy and Huxley, and in posterity
    by his near-namesake, a weird sociopath given to the production of sentimental
    pap.

    In his centenary year, it is only fitting that we should recall some of Dinsey''s
    greatest triumphs. Over the next few months, our team of film buffs, led by Fatima
    Gilliblat, will be looking at each of Dinsey''s masterpieces in turn. Fatima is
    currently out of the country... sorry, out in the country, eschewing her usual
    urban haunts for a summer spent mooching about in some godforsaken abandoned farmyard.
    She found time, however, to send this brief note:

    Hello readers! Fatima Gilliblat here, sprawled on a musty hay bale and thinking
    about Thomas Hardy, Fate, Destiny, and the grunting of pigs at dawn. But I haven''t
    forgotten my promise to write about the films of Walt Dinsey, and I''m putting
    the finishing touches to a sprightly little essay on that timeless classic Beauty
    And the Bees. In my opinion it is the finest killer bee attack film ever made,
    and I hope to communicate my overenthusiasm to you very, very soon. Heigh ho,
    green grow the rushes-oh.


    Left : Aldous Huxley. Right : Don Van Vliet. In between them, Umbrella Man in
    Dealey Plaza'
