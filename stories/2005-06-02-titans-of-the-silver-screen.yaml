  text: "The assassination of an important world figure is so shocking that other\
    \ events of the day, including other deaths, get overlooked. A notable example\
    \ is the death of Aldous Huxley on 22nd November 1963. That day, of course, is\
    \ recalled because of what happened near the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza in Dallas,\
    \ Texas. The demise of the astonishingly tall, severely myopic writer went virtually\
    \ unremarked (as, incidentally, did the fact that only a few weeks before, the\
    \ vacuum cleaner salesman who knocked on the door of Huxley's Los Angeles home\
    \ was the young Don Van Vliet, soon to become known to the world as Captain Beefheart.\
    \ Never let it be said that Hooting Yard is stinting with the facts.)\nThere was\
    \ another death that day that received even less attention, despite the fact that\
    \ the cinema was robbed of one of its most titanic talents. Few today remember\
    \ Walt Dinsey, overshadowed in death by Kennedy and Huxley, and in posterity by\
    \ his near-namesake, a weird sociopath given to the production of sentimental\
    \ pap.\nIn his centenary year, it is only fitting that we should recall some of\
    \ Dinsey's greatest triumphs. Over the next few months, our team of film buffs,\
    \ led by Fatima Gilliblat, will be looking at each of Dinsey's masterpieces in\
    \ turn. Fatima is currently out of the country\u2026 sorry, out in the country,\
    \ eschewing her usual urban haunts for a summer spent mooching about in some godforsaken\
    \ abandoned farmyard. She found time, however, to send this brief note:\nHello\
    \ readers! Fatima Gilliblat here, sprawled on a musty hay bale and thinking about\
    \ Thomas Hardy, Fate, Destiny, and the grunting of pigs at dawn. But I haven't\
    \ forgotten my promise to write about the films of Walt Dinsey, and I'm putting\
    \ the finishing touches to a sprightly little essay on that timeless classic Beauty\
    \ And the Bees. In my opinion it is the finest killer bee attack film ever made,\
    \ and I hope to communicate my overenthusiasm to you very, very soon. Heigh ho,\
    \ green grow the rushes-oh.\n\nLeft : Aldous Huxley. Right : Don Van Vliet. In\
    \ between them, Umbrella Man in Dealey Plaza"
