  text: "Yesterday's piece by Professor Bindweed, How I Plunged Into The Bottomless\
    \ Viper-Pit Of Gaar, contained a number of errors. These were due to production\
    \ problems, escaping gas, an unexpected teabag mishap, and the distractions of\
    \ a choir belting out Shenandoah at top volume. At Hooting Yard, however, we pride\
    \ ourselves in setting the record straight at the very earliest opportunity.\n\
    There were three misprints, and they were of a kind. As several readers have pointed\
    \ out with commendable promptness, there are no bottomless viper-pits at O'Houlihan's\
    \ Wharf or at Shoeburyness, and there is no such place as San Christoboole. Let\
    \ us take each one in turn, in reverse order.\nSan Christoboole does not exist,\
    \ at least not in any atlas I know of, and it is difficult to know which bottomless\
    \ viper-pit Professor Bindweed had in mind. It may be an anagram of Basoonclotshire,\
    \ but my well-thumbed gazetteer of that bosky paradise-on-earth states specifically\
    \ (page 1,249) that \u201Cthere are no viper-pits in the county, bottomless or\
    \ otherwise\u201D. Incidentally, the name of the shire has nothing to do with\
    \ bassoons, hence the spelling. The derivation is from basin. I am reminded that\
    \ readers have long been promised a series of articles on the important topic\
    \ of basins, and these are currently in preparation, so please stop sending those\
    \ pleading emails.\nFor Shoeburyness, read Lytham St Annes.\nTo think for one\
    \ minute that there could be a bottomless viper-pit at O'Houlihan's Wharf is so\
    \ preposterous I am surprised the globe kept spinning on its axis after this howler\
    \ appeared here yesterday. As soon as the error was brought to my attention, I\
    \ fired off an apology to the Five Fiendish Burghers of O'Houlihan's Wharf, terrified\
    \ as I was of swift and brutal reprisals. I received a very gracious acknowledgement,\
    \ which I am happy to reprint below:\n\u201CO Key! We, we, we, we, we, the Five\
    \ Fiendish Burghers of O'Houlihan's Wharf, that is, first Godsoke, second Pardew,\
    \ third Cansegmabulbadette, fourth Pip, and fifth Billy Strayhorn, do hereby say\
    \ to you in arch lewd monstrous grating swinish implacable hoarse declamation,\
    \ and then in the ululatory incantation of a muezzin, that we, we, we, we, we\
    \ have taken unto our bodices and tunics the sentiments of your piteous grovelment\
    \ and we, we, we, we, we have pronounced it good. The battalions of the O'Houlihan's\
    \ Wharf Avengement Platoon have been called off, before they even had time to\
    \ mount their hideous macroencephalic horses, yes!, the hideous macroencephalic\
    \ horses, with their fierce biting spittle-flecked fangs, that gallop at double\
    \ the speed of light! Don't let it happen again.\u201D\nI have promised my new\
    \ pals, the Burghers, who are coming round for tea later on today, to write something\
    \ accurate and complimentary about O'Houlihan's Wharf in the near future."
