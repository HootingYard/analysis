  text: 'The item about swans on Tuesday 31st May, in which I referred to the swan-eating
    proclivities of Peter Maxwell Davies, led me to ponder whether I could interest
    a mainstream publisher in a book entitled The Bird-Based Diets Of Twentieth Century
    Composers. (I know that sounds like one of Dobson''s pamphlets, but I checked,
    and it is--surprisingly, perhaps--a topic he never addressed.)

    I jotted down a few notes (Berio--partridge, Havergal Brian--reed warbler, Berg--grebe)
    but my pea-sized yet pulsating brain was drawn back to swans by that indefatigable
    correspondent Glyn Webster, who sent this:

    "When I was a toddler my parents used to amuse themselves by taking me to the
    Rotorua lake front to feed the Satanic Black Swans. These swans are not the white,
    regal, placid creatures I''d been shown in my storybooks. They are black, greasy,
    violent creatures that smell of sulphurous lake mud. The expression in their glowing
    red eyes switches from vacant, narcissistic insanity to envious hatred the instant
    they are offered food.

    "In a shoebox somewhere is a Super 8 film reel of me weeping in terror, running
    and stumbling in my nylon parka and Crackerjack(r) gumboots while a dozen of these
    evil beasts waddle after me lunging after the lump of bread I''d forgotten to
    drop in my panic. I seem to remember all my early visits to the lake ending that
    way."


    A black swan : greasy, violent & sulphurous.'
