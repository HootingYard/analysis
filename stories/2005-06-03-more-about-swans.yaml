  text: "The item about swans on Tuesday 31st May, in which I referred to the swan-eating\
    \ proclivities of Peter Maxwell Davies, led me to ponder whether I could interest\
    \ a mainstream publisher in a book entitled The Bird-Based Diets Of Twentieth\
    \ Century Composers. (I know that sounds like one of Dobson's pamphlets, but I\
    \ checked, and it is\u2014surprisingly, perhaps\u2014a topic he never addressed.)\n\
    I jotted down a few notes (Berio\u2014partridge, Havergal Brian\u2014reed warbler,\
    \ Berg\u2014grebe) but my pea-sized yet pulsating brain was drawn back to swans\
    \ by that indefatigable correspondent Glyn Webster, who sent this:\n\u201CWhen\
    \ I was a toddler my parents used to amuse themselves by taking me to the Rotorua\
    \ lake front to feed the Satanic Black Swans. These swans are not the white, regal,\
    \ placid creatures I'd been shown in my storybooks. They are black, greasy, violent\
    \ creatures that smell of sulphurous lake mud. The expression in their glowing\
    \ red eyes switches from vacant, narcissistic insanity to envious hatred the instant\
    \ they are offered food.\n\u201CIn a shoebox somewhere is a Super 8 film reel\
    \ of me weeping in terror, running and stumbling in my nylon parka and Crackerjack\xAE\
    \ gumboots while a dozen of these evil beasts waddle after me lunging after the\
    \ lump of bread I'd forgotten to drop in my panic. I seem to remember all my early\
    \ visits to the lake ending that way.\u201D\n\nA black swan : greasy, violent\
    \ & sulphurous."
