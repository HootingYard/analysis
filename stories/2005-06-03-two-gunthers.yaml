  text: 'Gunther the Pipsqueak, who appears in the story entitled Grebe (Sunday 29th
    May) is not to be confused with another Gunther who is mentioned in one of my
    favourite lines from a television drama. It works best on screen, of course, rather
    than reproduced coldly on the page, but here it is:

    Nate: Hey, have a hydroponic raspberry. They''re grown by a guy named Gunther
    who once slept with Stevie Nicks.

    From episode two of the first series of Six Feet Under.'
