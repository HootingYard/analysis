  text: "Speaking of vile wafers, as Antoine Simon Maillard does in the quotation\
    \ above, reminds us that \u201Cvile\u201D is one of the varieties of wafer available\
    \ from the kiosk behind the post office in O'Houlihan's Wharf. Unlike most wafers,\
    \ which tend by definition to be thin, the vile wafer is as thick as the old Penguin\
    \ English Library edition of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale by Herman Melville, which,\
    \ with its introduction and commentary by Harold Beaver, comes to over a thousand\
    \ pages.\n(If I may digress for a moment, I have always been enamoured of Mr Beaver's\
    \ note on the line \u201Call bats; and I'm a crow\u201D on page 545 of this edition\u2014\
    the note itself appears on page 885. Beaver writes, inter alia, As crow to the\
    \ house of Cawdor (\u2018in the whirled woods, the last day of the year!\u2019\
    ) Pip prophesies doom; all turned to bats at dusk; all screwy-whirled; all mad.)\n\
    According to the O'Houlihan's Wharf Market Research Bureau (whose office, by the\
    \ way, is a shabby lean-to tacked on to the post office) sales of vile wafers\
    \ are down this year, a worrying trend given that wafers in general are enjoying\
    \ peak performance in the economy of this godforsaken hellhole by the boiling\
    \ sea.\n(Forgive a second digression\u2026 I know I said yesterday that I would\
    \ be complimentary about O'Houlihan's Wharf, but sometimes the truth will out.)\n\
    Anyone examining the pie charts, graphs, Bl\xF6tzmann diagrams and other impenetrable\
    \ flummery in the latest edition of the O'Houlihan's Wharf Market Research Bureau\
    \ Bulletin Of Underlying Trends In Trading Patterns Of Wafers From The Kiosk Behind\
    \ The Post Office, as I have done, repeatedly, will find it hard to disagree with\
    \ the view of one focus group member, who is reported as saying \u201CNo one wants\
    \ to buy the vile wafers because they are as thick as a hefty paperback, and we\
    \ prefer our wafers thin. Is that so wrong?\u201D\nThe latest tracker poll suggests\
    \ that the most popular wafers are hot wafers, clinging wafers, gas-enhanced wafers,\
    \ pituitary-gland wafers, pip-strewn wafers, and, tellingly, Arpad's special wafer-thin\
    \ wafers. The latter, for example, outsold vile wafers by more than ten thousand\
    \ percent, if that means anything, arithmetically, or mathematically, or both.\
    \ I am particularly charmed by the Bulletin's graphic illustrating this point,\
    \ because if you turn it sideways it looks like a cartoon face of Jeb Magruder\
    \ of Watergate fame. I dropped my copy of the Bulletin into a puddle of bubbling,\
    \ viscous green fluid outside the Convent Of Our Lady Of Resignation And Dismay,\
    \ so unfortunately I cannot reproduce it here. A photograph of wily Jeb, taken\
    \ before he went to prison and became a born-again Christian, will have to suffice.\n\
    \nInterestingly, there are distinct parallels between the wafers on sale in O'Houlihan's\
    \ Wharf and the Watergate scandal, not least among them being that the kiosk's\
    \ owner's name is Chuck Colson, just like President Nixon's Special Counsel. Our\
    \ Colson, the wafer merchant, is a lifelong resident of O'Houlihan's Wharf, and\
    \ indeed has only left that wretched brine-soaked eyesore once in his life, when\
    \ he was mistakenly called to testify before Judge John J Sirica at the hearings\
    \ in Washington DC. Thankfully, the error was realised while kiosk-man was waiting\
    \ at the railway station in Strontium 90 Township, just a few miles away. He returned\
    \ home the same day, celebrating his near-brush with fame by tucking into a slap-up\
    \ dinner of baked swan \xE0 la Maxwell Davies.\nPersonally, I find it just a little\
    \ unsettling that Colson never eats his own wafers, even the wafer-thin ones.\
    \ I decided to put this to him and wrote a carefully-worded letter requesting\
    \ an interview, but answer came there none. Now I am not given to harrying wafer-kiosk-persons\
    \ as a matter of course, but nor will I allow them to vend wafery produce they\
    \ themselves eschew without giving me a damned good explanation. That's the kind\
    \ of narrator I am.\nUnable to pursue Colson myself, having come down with a case\
    \ of seeds-in-the-vitals which necessitated complete bed rest, I employed a private\
    \ detective by the name of Istvan Plunkett to act on my behalf. This Plunkett\
    \ was a curious combination of elegance, rattiness and allergies. I never did\
    \ quite get the measure of him. As far as I could gather, he existed on a starvation\
    \ diet, berries mostly, and rainwater. Certainly he was not a man to feed on swans,\
    \ irrespective of whether they had been accidentally electrocuted or not.\nTragically,\
    \ the assignment on which I sent him proved to be Plunkett's last case. I did\
    \ not hear from him for months on end, and was in any case losing interest in\
    \ the doings of a self-hating wafer-salesman from O'Houlihan's Wharf, having better\
    \ things to do with my time, such as trying out that berries-and-rainwater diet\
    \ myself. Then one morning I read in The Daily Dripfeed a short item noting that\
    \ an elegant, ratty and allergy-prone private detective had been found dead in\
    \ a thicket of gorse bushes and bracken. Apparently the wires of his portable\
    \ metal tapping machine had become entangled in the foliage and he had been too\
    \ bloody cack-handed to extricate himself. I crumpled up the newspaper and tossed\
    \ it into a disposal chute, and I said a prayer for Plunkett. It was not a long\
    \ prayer, nor was it a well-written one. I think it had been translated from Glosa,\
    \ the artificial international language which rivals Esperanto. Then I went home\
    \ and opened my copy of Moby-Dick; or the Whale, by Herman Melville and read Pip\
    \ prophesies doom; all turned to bats at dusk; all screwy-whirled; all mad, and\
    \ I sank my teeth into a vile wafer, and out in the spinney I knew that dozens\
    \ upon dozens of swans were gathering, whooper swans, whooping, whooping, magnificent,\
    \ and so very alive.."
