  text: 'Speaking of vile wafers, as Antoine Simon Maillard does in the quotation
    above, reminds us that "vile" is one of the varieties of wafer available from
    the kiosk behind the post office in O''Houlihan''s Wharf. Unlike most wafers,
    which tend by definition to be thin, the vile wafer is as thick as the old Penguin
    English Library edition of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale by Herman Melville, which,
    with its introduction and commentary by Harold Beaver, comes to over a thousand
    pages.

    (If I may digress for a moment, I have always been enamoured of Mr Beaver''s note
    on the line "all bats; and I''m a crow" on page 545 of this edition--the note
    itself appears on page 885. Beaver writes, inter alia, As crow to the house of
    Cawdor (''in the whirled woods, the last day of the year!'') Pip prophesies doom;
    all turned to bats at dusk; all screwy-whirled; all mad.)

    According to the O''Houlihan''s Wharf Market Research Bureau (whose office, by
    the way, is a shabby lean-to tacked on to the post office) sales of vile wafers
    are down this year, a worrying trend given that wafers in general are enjoying
    peak performance in the economy of this godforsaken hellhole by the boiling sea.

    (Forgive a second digression... I know I said yesterday that I would be complimentary
    about O''Houlihan''s Wharf, but sometimes the truth will out.)

    Anyone examining the pie charts, graphs, Blotzmann diagrams and other impenetrable
    flummery in the latest edition of the O''Houlihan''s Wharf Market Research Bureau
    Bulletin Of Underlying Trends In Trading Patterns Of Wafers From The Kiosk Behind
    The Post Office, as I have done, repeatedly, will find it hard to disagree with
    the view of one focus group member, who is reported as saying "No one wants to
    buy the vile wafers because they are as thick as a hefty paperback, and we prefer
    our wafers thin. Is that so wrong?"

    The latest tracker poll suggests that the most popular wafers are hot wafers,
    clinging wafers, gas-enhanced wafers, pituitary-gland wafers, pip-strewn wafers,
    and, tellingly, Arpad''s special wafer-thin wafers. The latter, for example, outsold
    vile wafers by more than ten thousand percent, if that means anything, arithmetically,
    or mathematically, or both. I am particularly charmed by the Bulletin''s graphic
    illustrating this point, because if you turn it sideways it looks like a cartoon
    face of Jeb Magruder of Watergate fame. I dropped my copy of the Bulletin into
    a puddle of bubbling, viscous green fluid outside the Convent Of Our Lady Of Resignation
    And Dismay, so unfortunately I cannot reproduce it here. A photograph of wily
    Jeb, taken before he went to prison and became a born-again Christian, will have
    to suffice.


    Interestingly, there are distinct parallels between the wafers on sale in O''Houlihan''s
    Wharf and the Watergate scandal, not least among them being that the kiosk''s
    owner''s name is Chuck Colson, just like President Nixon''s Special Counsel. Our
    Colson, the wafer merchant, is a lifelong resident of O''Houlihan''s Wharf, and
    indeed has only left that wretched brine-soaked eyesore once in his life, when
    he was mistakenly called to testify before Judge John J Sirica at the hearings
    in Washington DC. Thankfully, the error was realised while kiosk-man was waiting
    at the railway station in Strontium 90 Township, just a few miles away. He returned
    home the same day, celebrating his near-brush with fame by tucking into a slap-up
    dinner of baked swan a la Maxwell Davies.

    Personally, I find it just a little unsettling that Colson never eats his own
    wafers, even the wafer-thin ones. I decided to put this to him and wrote a carefully-worded
    letter requesting an interview, but answer came there none. Now I am not given
    to harrying wafer-kiosk-persons as a matter of course, but nor will I allow them
    to vend wafery produce they themselves eschew without giving me a damned good
    explanation. That''s the kind of narrator I am.

    Unable to pursue Colson myself, having come down with a case of seeds-in-the-vitals
    which necessitated complete bed rest, I employed a private detective by the name
    of Istvan Plunkett to act on my behalf. This Plunkett was a curious combination
    of elegance, rattiness and allergies. I never did quite get the measure of him.
    As far as I could gather, he existed on a starvation diet, berries mostly, and
    rainwater. Certainly he was not a man to feed on swans, irrespective of whether
    they had been accidentally electrocuted or not.

    Tragically, the assignment on which I sent him proved to be Plunkett''s last case.
    I did not hear from him for months on end, and was in any case losing interest
    in the doings of a self-hating wafer-salesman from O''Houlihan''s Wharf, having
    better things to do with my time, such as trying out that berries-and-rainwater
    diet myself. Then one morning I read in The Daily Dripfeed a short item noting
    that an elegant, ratty and allergy-prone private detective had been found dead
    in a thicket of gorse bushes and bracken. Apparently the wires of his portable
    metal tapping machine had become entangled in the foliage and he had been too
    bloody cack-handed to extricate himself. I crumpled up the newspaper and tossed
    it into a disposal chute, and I said a prayer for Plunkett. It was not a long
    prayer, nor was it a well-written one. I think it had been translated from Glosa,
    the artificial international language which rivals Esperanto. Then I went home
    and opened my copy of Moby-Dick; or the Whale, by Herman Melville and read Pip
    prophesies doom; all turned to bats at dusk; all screwy-whirled; all mad, and
    I sank my teeth into a vile wafer, and out in the spinney I knew that dozens upon
    dozens of swans were gathering, whooper swans, whooping, whooping, magnificent,
    and so very alive..'
