  text: 'It has to be said that most of the inhabitants of O''Houlihan''s Wharf are
    not worth writing about. They are, with few exceptions, a grey and insipid bunch.
    One of those exceptions, however, is the pedant from whose pen streams a series
    of righteous nostrums, or possibly nostra, regularly sent out into the world,
    or at least into this bilgewater-befouled corner of it, posted as they are on
    a noticeboard outside the pet shop, from which they are rapidly torn down and
    stuffed into the pockets of those citizens who collect them with something approaching
    mania.

    Three questions present themselves to the inquiring mind. Who is this pedant?
    What are his nostrums? And are they righteous?

    I do not have an inquiring mind, at least not today, for I am too busy putting
    the finishing touches to my Taxonomy Of Swans in tin, wood, grease and sand, an
    imposing sculpture which has not yet found a buyer and may therefore remain wedged
    into my bathroom for years to come. But I know that readers will be curious about
    the pedant and his nostrums and their righteousness, so I asked Dr Ruth Pastry
    to investigate.

    Now Dr Pastry and I have a somewhat fraught relationship. Many moons ago, we got
    into an argument about that anonymous 18th century suicide note which reads, in
    its entirety, "All this buttoning and unbuttoning". I cannot recall the substance
    of our dispute, only that harsh and unforgivable words were exchanged, saucepans
    hurled--one still brimful of an appetising soup--and threats levelled against
    pets, to wit, a tortoise and a goose. The tortoise was mine, the goose Dr Pastry''s.
    In the end, neither of them came to any harm, at least not immediately, although
    of course the ravages of the passing years took their toll, and both of them are
    now dead and gone, Diego the tortoise in a maelstrom and Rex the goose in a railway
    accident.

    Very much alive, though, is the feud between me and Dr Pastry, and it was with
    a view to ending it that I invited her help with the pedant and his righteous
    nostrums. It was the sort of assignment I thought she would enjoy, given her fondness
    for both pedants and nostrums. I was wrong. Here is what she wrote in reply to
    my invitation.

    "For the love of heaven, Key! What makes you think for one moment that I would
    ever again set foot in that confounded sea-girt wasteland? The last time I went
    to O''Houlihan''s Wharf I was young, cheery, and full of beans, a bluestocking
    with the glint of glory in my bright blue eyes. Two hours after cycling into town
    with a pannier full of Proust, I was sprawled on a heap of pebbles, stinking of
    the sea, a prematurely-aged drudge with gnats in my hair, pustules on my brow,
    and a belly full of 90% proof egg nog. Don''t get me wrong, I don''t blame the
    shrivelled and witless O''Houlihan''s Wharfites. It is simply the spirit of the
    place. It does that to a person, even to me. Well, never again. Your pedant with
    his nostrums can go hang. I am going out to the cemetery now to place a bunch
    of peonies and flax on poor Rex''s tomb, and as I do so I will curse you again
    and again, as I have cursed you every single day since the buttoning and unbuttoning
    business first flared. Adieu."

    Clearly, if I was going to satisfy my readers'' curiosity about the pedant and
    his nostrums and their righteousness, I would have to think again. Dr Pastry seemed
    in no mood to make peace, and I was not sure I would be able to change her mind.

    All of which, I suppose, goes to explain why I found myself hopelessly lost in
    the dark, dark woods as midnight struck. With Dr Pastry down the pan, as it were,
    I worked desultorily at the Taxonomy of Swans, my mind buzzing away trying to
    think of someone else who might be able to help. As I tamped a fistful of grease
    into a knothole, I suddenly remembered the old blind woodcutter. It was true that
    he knew nothing of O''Houlihan''s Wharf, but, I reasoned, that might work to my
    advantage. Dipping my hands into a tub of swarfega, I tried to recall his telephone
    number. He had made we swear never to write it down, and I had honoured my promise,
    partly out of rectitude and partly because he said that if I broke my word he
    would send a sloth of slow, lumbering bears to smother me in my bed. His sightless
    eyes gleamed dangerously in the candlelight as he said this, and I realised that
    the story about how Old Ma Bagshaw met her end suddenly made sense. "My word is
    my bond," I mumbled, and the old blind woodcutter cackled.

    Now, though, twenty years later, with the Soviet Union long collapsed, I simply
    could not remember that damned number. I realised I would have to set off into
    the dark, dark woods and find the old blind woodcutter''s crumbling cottage, and
    ask him face to face. I tacked the end of a length of string to my gate, and paid
    it out behind me as I walked, each step taking me further and further from the
    comforts of home, and the unfinished Taxonomy of Swans, and closer to the perils
    of the dark, dark woods.

    Had I known that my neighbour''s eagle, Simon, had swooped out of the sky within
    minutes of my departure, and bitten the end off the string, because it smelled
    of hamster, I would have stopped then and there. In my ignorance, of course, I
    tramped on, little knowing that, like the answers, my friend, my string, the string
    that should see me safely home, was blowin'' in the wind.

    And the answers to my three questions, about the pedant of O''Houlihan''s Wharf,
    and his nostrums, and the righteousness of his nostrums, they too are blowin''
    in the wind, for what hope do I have of discovering them now, in this Stygian
    darkness? It is midnight. I am encircled by enormous trees. The duff underfoot
    is musty and damp and alive with tiny biting creatures. There is no trace of the
    old blind woodcutter''s cottage. Perhaps I only ever imagined him. My hands still
    stink of swarfega. It is midnight, and pitch black, and I have been wandering
    these dark, dark woods for a hundred years.'
