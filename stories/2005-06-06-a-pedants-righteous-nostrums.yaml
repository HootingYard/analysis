  text: "It has to be said that most of the inhabitants of O'Houlihan's Wharf are\
    \ not worth writing about. They are, with few exceptions, a grey and insipid bunch.\
    \ One of those exceptions, however, is the pedant from whose pen streams a series\
    \ of righteous nostrums, or possibly nostra, regularly sent out into the world,\
    \ or at least into this bilgewater-befouled corner of it, posted as they are on\
    \ a noticeboard outside the pet shop, from which they are rapidly torn down and\
    \ stuffed into the pockets of those citizens who collect them with something approaching\
    \ mania.\nThree questions present themselves to the inquiring mind. Who is this\
    \ pedant? What are his nostrums? And are they righteous?\nI do not have an inquiring\
    \ mind, at least not today, for I am too busy putting the finishing touches to\
    \ my Taxonomy Of Swans in tin, wood, grease and sand, an imposing sculpture which\
    \ has not yet found a buyer and may therefore remain wedged into my bathroom for\
    \ years to come. But I know that readers will be curious about the pedant and\
    \ his nostrums and their righteousness, so I asked Dr Ruth Pastry to investigate.\n\
    Now Dr Pastry and I have a somewhat fraught relationship. Many moons ago, we got\
    \ into an argument about that anonymous 18th century suicide note which reads,\
    \ in its entirety, \u201CAll this buttoning and unbuttoning\u201D. I cannot recall\
    \ the substance of our dispute, only that harsh and unforgivable words were exchanged,\
    \ saucepans hurled\u2014one still brimful of an appetising soup\u2014and threats\
    \ levelled against pets, to wit, a tortoise and a goose. The tortoise was mine,\
    \ the goose Dr Pastry's. In the end, neither of them came to any harm, at least\
    \ not immediately, although of course the ravages of the passing years took their\
    \ toll, and both of them are now dead and gone, Diego the tortoise in a maelstrom\
    \ and Rex the goose in a railway accident.\nVery much alive, though, is the feud\
    \ between me and Dr Pastry, and it was with a view to ending it that I invited\
    \ her help with the pedant and his righteous nostrums. It was the sort of assignment\
    \ I thought she would enjoy, given her fondness for both pedants and nostrums.\
    \ I was wrong. Here is what she wrote in reply to my invitation.\n\u201CFor the\
    \ love of heaven, Key! What makes you think for one moment that I would ever again\
    \ set foot in that confounded sea-girt wasteland? The last time I went to O'Houlihan's\
    \ Wharf I was young, cheery, and full of beans, a bluestocking with the glint\
    \ of glory in my bright blue eyes. Two hours after cycling into town with a pannier\
    \ full of Proust, I was sprawled on a heap of pebbles, stinking of the sea, a\
    \ prematurely-aged drudge with gnats in my hair, pustules on my brow, and a belly\
    \ full of 90% proof egg nog. Don't get me wrong, I don't blame the shrivelled\
    \ and witless O'Houlihan's Wharfites. It is simply the spirit of the place. It\
    \ does that to a person, even to me. Well, never again. Your pedant with his nostrums\
    \ can go hang. I am going out to the cemetery now to place a bunch of peonies\
    \ and flax on poor Rex's tomb, and as I do so I will curse you again and again,\
    \ as I have cursed you every single day since the buttoning and unbuttoning business\
    \ first flared. Adieu.\u201D\nClearly, if I was going to satisfy my readers' curiosity\
    \ about the pedant and his nostrums and their righteousness, I would have to think\
    \ again. Dr Pastry seemed in no mood to make peace, and I was not sure I would\
    \ be able to change her mind.\nAll of which, I suppose, goes to explain why I\
    \ found myself hopelessly lost in the dark, dark woods as midnight struck. With\
    \ Dr Pastry down the pan, as it were, I worked desultorily at the Taxonomy of\
    \ Swans, my mind buzzing away trying to think of someone else who might be able\
    \ to help. As I tamped a fistful of grease into a knothole, I suddenly remembered\
    \ the old blind woodcutter. It was true that he knew nothing of O'Houlihan's Wharf,\
    \ but, I reasoned, that might work to my advantage. Dipping my hands into a tub\
    \ of swarfega, I tried to recall his telephone number. He had made we swear never\
    \ to write it down, and I had honoured my promise, partly out of rectitude and\
    \ partly because he said that if I broke my word he would send a sloth of slow,\
    \ lumbering bears to smother me in my bed. His sightless eyes gleamed dangerously\
    \ in the candlelight as he said this, and I realised that the story about how\
    \ Old Ma Bagshaw met her end suddenly made sense. \u201CMy word is my bond,\u201D\
    \ I mumbled, and the old blind woodcutter cackled.\nNow, though, twenty years\
    \ later, with the Soviet Union long collapsed, I simply could not remember that\
    \ damned number. I realised I would have to set off into the dark, dark woods\
    \ and find the old blind woodcutter's crumbling cottage, and ask him face to face.\
    \ I tacked the end of a length of string to my gate, and paid it out behind me\
    \ as I walked, each step taking me further and further from the comforts of home,\
    \ and the unfinished Taxonomy of Swans, and closer to the perils of the dark,\
    \ dark woods.\nHad I known that my neighbour's eagle, Simon, had swooped out of\
    \ the sky within minutes of my departure, and bitten the end off the string, because\
    \ it smelled of hamster, I would have stopped then and there. In my ignorance,\
    \ of course, I tramped on, little knowing that, like the answers, my friend, my\
    \ string, the string that should see me safely home, was blowin' in the wind.\n\
    And the answers to my three questions, about the pedant of O'Houlihan's Wharf,\
    \ and his nostrums, and the righteousness of his nostrums, they too are blowin'\
    \ in the wind, for what hope do I have of discovering them now, in this Stygian\
    \ darkness? It is midnight. I am encircled by enormous trees. The duff underfoot\
    \ is musty and damp and alive with tiny biting creatures. There is no trace of\
    \ the old blind woodcutter's cottage. Perhaps I only ever imagined him. My hands\
    \ still stink of swarfega. It is midnight, and pitch black, and I have been wandering\
    \ these dark, dark woods for a hundred years."
