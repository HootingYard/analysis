    \ hissing, whirling ball of purple fire followed its predecessor\u2026 They heard\
    \ a muffled explosion this time. Lurid tongues of light speared from the window,\
    \ dancing like an aurora borealis. The room inside looked for a moment to those\
    \ staring from the darkness like the mouth of some fantastic inferno such as the\
    \ hand of a Dor\xE9 might have depicted. Above the noise of the concussion they\
    \ heard a single, horrible cry. Then blackness descended and the night seemed\
    \ to close in, bringing silence with it. The voices of the detectives grew hushed\
    \ with amazement and the awe of the unknown.\u201D \u2014 Paul Chadwick, Doctor\
