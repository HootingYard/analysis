  text: '"Again there was that uncanny effect of diabolical intelligence. The hissing,
    whirling ball of purple fire followed its predecessor... They heard a muffled
    explosion this time. Lurid tongues of light speared from the window, dancing like
    an aurora borealis. The room inside looked for a moment to those staring from
    the darkness like the mouth of some fantastic inferno such as the hand of a Dore
    might have depicted. Above the noise of the concussion they heard a single, horrible
    cry. Then blackness descended and the night seemed to close in, bringing silence
    with it. The voices of the detectives grew hushed with amazement and the awe of
    the unknown." -- Paul Chadwick, Doctor Zero'
