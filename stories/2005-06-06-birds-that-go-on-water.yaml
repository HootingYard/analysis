    I was alerted by an article in today''s Guardian to the existence of the highly
    commendable Duck Density organisation. Devoted to the task of measuring duck densities,
    as their name suggests, this splendid body counters the belief of many that all
    university students are feckless, beer-swilling rascals. Clearly some of them
    have their heads screwed on and their priorities right.

    "Birds that go on water" is Duck Density''s satisfyingly simple definition of
    what a duck is, and although the website could benefit from a little more gravitas,
    I can only applaud. I am sure you will join me.'
