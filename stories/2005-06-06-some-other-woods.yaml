  text: 'Don''t worry, the dark, dark woods are not real, that was only a story. But
    now I want to tell you about some other woods, specifically, The Woods, the new
    CD by Sleater-Kinney. Perhaps it is unseemly for a man of my advancing years to
    be so keen on a trio of young women who came to prominence as part of the Riot
    Grrl movement (whatever that was), but I have to say that if I am in the mood
    to listen to that kind of thing, Sleater-Kinney are probably--in the phrase beloved
    by music journalists of a certain vintage--"the greatest rock & roll band in the
    world".
