  text: "Don't worry, the dark, dark woods are not real, that was only a story. But\
    \ now I want to tell you about some other woods, specifically, The Woods, the\
    \ new CD by Sleater-Kinney. Perhaps it is unseemly for a man of my advancing years\
    \ to be so keen on a trio of young women who came to prominence as part of the\
    \ Riot Grrl movement (whatever that was), but I have to say that if I am in the\
    \ mood to listen to that kind of thing, Sleater-Kinney are probably\u2014in the\
    \ phrase beloved by music journalists of a certain vintage\u2014\u201Cthe greatest\
    \ rock & roll band in the world\u201D.\n"
