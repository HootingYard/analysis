  text: '"A fondness for trifles is certainly no less conspicuous in age than youth;
    and we daily see it among persons of the best understanding, who wholly neglect
    every essential to real happiness in the pursuit of those very toys which children
    cry to be indulged in; even such as a bit of ribband, or the sound of a monosyllable
    tacked to the name; without considering that those badges of distinction, like
    bells about an idiot''s neck, frequently serve only to render their folly more
    remarkable, and expose them to the contempt of the lookers on, who perhaps too,
    as nature is the same in all, want but the same opportunity to catch no less eagerly
    at the tawdry gewgaw." -- Eliza Fowler Haywood, Life''s Progress Through The Passions,
    or The Adventures Of Natura'
