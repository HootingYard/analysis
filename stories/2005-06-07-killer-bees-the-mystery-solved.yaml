  text: 'See how we move so easily from birds to bees? Some people think that Hooting
    Yard is compiled in some vague and random fashion, the ordering of items being
    based on whatever springs into Frank''s pea-sized but pulsating brain from moment
    to moment. Ha! If only it were that simple. So abstruse is the underlying system,
    rumours are flying about that Dan Brown''s next billion-selling blockbuster could
    well be The Hooting Yard Code, in which connections, patterns, and inexplicably
    deep twaddle are to be found between this website, the legend of Prester John,
    Atlantis, the moon landings, Blunkettgate, and Rosicrucianism. It is all there,
    if only you know where to look.

    Where was I? Bees. Killer bees, to be precise. Pansy Cradledew, who is tirelessly
    enthusiastic about researching such matters, has stumbled upon the solution to
    the mystery of killer bee attacks. She was reading that tremendous book, the original
    Chambers'' Book Of Days, which has been lauded here before, and came upon this:


    "It has been shewn in a contemporary publication, that it is customary in many
    parts of England, when a death takes place, to go and formally impart the fact
    to the bees, to ask them to the funeral, and to fix a piece of crape upon their
    hives; thus treating these insects as beings possessed of something like human
    intelligence, and therefore entitled to all the respect which one member of a
    family pays to the rest. Not long before penning these notes, I met with an instance
    of this feeling about bees. A neighbour of mine had bought a hive of bees at an
    auction of the goods of a farmer who had recently died. The bees seemed very sickly,
    and not likely to thrive, when my neighbour''s servant bethought him that they
    had never been put in mourning for their late master; on this he got a piece of
    crape and tied it to a stick, which he fastened to the hive. After this the bees
    recovered, and when I saw them they were in a very flourishing state--a result
    which was unhesitatingly attributed to their having been put into mourning."


    Pansy sees here the key to the antisocial behaviour of killer bees. Unlike what
    happened with the lucky hives in the quoted passage, most bereaved families in
    this day and age forget to include bees in the mourning process. If you doubt
    that, try to recall the last time you saw a grief-stricken relict tying a piece
    of crape to a stick and attaching it to a beehive. As this sensible practice has
    died out, so millions of bees, deprived of the opportunity to mourn their human
    pals, are thrown into dangerous neurotic confusion. Bereft, ignored, and not even
    given a piece of crape on a stick, let alone counselling, they are unable to achieve
    closure and thus band together into swarms of homicidal buzzing frenzy, with predictable--and
    catastrophic--results.

    Pansy will be presenting evidence to a joint panel of experts on funeral arrangements,
    bereavement, and bees in the near future.'
