  text: "See how we move so easily from birds to bees? Some people think that Hooting\
    \ Yard is compiled in some vague and random fashion, the ordering of items being\
    \ based on whatever springs into Frank's pea-sized but pulsating brain from moment\
    \ to moment. Ha! If only it were that simple. So abstruse is the underlying system,\
    \ rumours are flying about that Dan Brown's next billion-selling blockbuster could\
    \ well be The Hooting Yard Code, in which connections, patterns, and inexplicably\
    \ deep twaddle are to be found between this website, the legend of Prester John,\
    \ Atlantis, the moon landings, Blunkettgate, and Rosicrucianism. It is all there,\
    \ if only you know where to look.\nWhere was I? Bees. Killer bees, to be precise.\
    \ Pansy Cradledew, who is tirelessly enthusiastic about researching such matters,\
    \ has stumbled upon the solution to the mystery of killer bee attacks. She was\
    \ reading that tremendous book, the original Chambers' Book Of Days, which has\
    \ been lauded here before, and came upon this:\n\n\u201CIt has been shewn in a\
    \ contemporary publication, that it is customary in many parts of England, when\
    \ a death takes place, to go and formally impart the fact to the bees, to ask\
    \ them to the funeral, and to fix a piece of crape upon their hives; thus treating\
    \ these insects as beings possessed of something like human intelligence, and\
    \ therefore entitled to all the respect which one member of a family pays to the\
    \ rest. Not long before penning these notes, I met with an instance of this feeling\
    \ about bees. A neighbour of mine had bought a hive of bees at an auction of the\
    \ goods of a farmer who had recently died. The bees seemed very sickly, and not\
    \ likely to thrive, when my neighbour's servant bethought him that they had never\
    \ been put in mourning for their late master; on this he got a piece of crape\
    \ and tied it to a stick, which he fastened to the hive. After this the bees recovered,\
    \ and when I saw them they were in a very flourishing state\u2014a result which\
    \ was unhesitatingly attributed to their having been put into mourning.\u201D\n\
    \nPansy sees here the key to the antisocial behaviour of killer bees. Unlike what\
    \ happened with the lucky hives in the quoted passage, most bereaved families\
    \ in this day and age forget to include bees in the mourning process. If you doubt\
    \ that, try to recall the last time you saw a grief-stricken relict tying a piece\
    \ of crape to a stick and attaching it to a beehive. As this sensible practice\
    \ has died out, so millions of bees, deprived of the opportunity to mourn their\
    \ human pals, are thrown into dangerous neurotic confusion. Bereft, ignored, and\
    \ not even given a piece of crape on a stick, let alone counselling, they are\
    \ unable to achieve closure and thus band together into swarms of homicidal buzzing\
    \ frenzy, with predictable\u2014and catastrophic\u2014results.\nPansy will be\
    \ presenting evidence to a joint panel of experts on funeral arrangements, bereavement,\
    \ and bees in the near future."
