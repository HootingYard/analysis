  text: 'I have always been struck by the fact that one way to describe a condition
    of apathy, ennui, tiredness or general debility is to say that we are listless.
    The word itself tells us how to rouse ourselves from such a stupor--get a list!
    A good list is a marvellous thing, and sure to blow away the cobwebs of Weltschmerz*.

    That is the first point. The second point is contained in a letter I received
    some time ago from an anonymous correspondent, for whom I suspect English is a
    second or even third language. This person wrote:

    "You are mentioning birds very often in the Hooting Yard. But I think you know
    little of bird life in truth. You say of cormorants, linnets, crows, ducks and
    some others but it is of a limited field, Mr Frank Key. Do you know others?"

    I am afraid to say there is a grain of truth in that, as readers of an ornithological
    bent have probably realised. Anyway, what brings these two points together? Yesterday
    I referred to the statue entitled Taxonomy of Swans which is cluttering up my
    bathroom. Doing research for the sculpture, I discovered that apparently "the
    taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese is in a state of flux". (I am afraid I cannot
    recall the source of that splendid quotation.) I fretted over this, and extended
    my reading from library books to the internet. And it was while I was scampering
    through various bird-related sites that I chanced upon the World Checklist of
    Passerine Birds and the World Checklist of Non-Passerine Birds.

    Could I have been more excited? I doubt it. Will you be as excited as I was? Possibly.
    One thing is for sure--my anonymous correspondent will be pleased to note that
    in future he or she is less likely to read here about cormorants, linnets, crows
    and ducks, for they will be supplanted by tiny tyrant manakins, buff-throated
    foliage gleaners, nukupuus, drab hemispinguses and tinkling cisticolas, among
    many, many others.


    Two different types of hemispingus, neither of them remotely drab

    *NOTE :The Cobwebs Of Weltschmerz is, of course, the title of an incomplete and
    unpublished novel by Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp, the Sino-Dutch funnelweb spider
    expert and one-time husband of Mrs Gubbins. See October 2004 for more information
    about him.'
