  text: 'Go to the orchard, and then come back, and don''t forget to bring the burlap
    sack. My poultice is in there, and so is my lint, and I just trod upon an upturned
    tack.

    This ancient and well-known folk rhyme is the starting point for a soon-to-be-published
    set of verses by Dennis Beerpint. Mrs Gubbins contacted the poet via her metal
    tapping machine to talk to him about it, but the transcript of their conversation
    was pecked at by flocks of cinnamon-rumped trogons and vernal hanging-parrots
    and rendered illegible, alas, alack.'
