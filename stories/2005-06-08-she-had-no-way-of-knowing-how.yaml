  text: '"She had no way of knowing how long she sat there before the tapping on her
    window brought her to her feet with a start. Stark fear squeezed the breath from
    her body and made her incapable of motion. Suddenly a face appeared at the window!
    A strange face, yet hauntingly familiar. In a flash she recognized it to be that

    made her way to the window and threw back the catch. Into the room bounded the
    half nude figure of a man!" -- Hugh J Gallagher, Death Mates For The Lust-Lost'
