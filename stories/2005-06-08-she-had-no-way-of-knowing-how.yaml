  text: '"She had no way of knowing how long she sat there before the tapping on her
    window brought her to her feet with a start. Stark fear squeezed the breath from
    her body and made her incapable of motion. Suddenly a face appeared at the window!
    A strange face, yet hauntingly familiar. In a flash she recognized it to be that
    of Phyllis, the trapeze artist, but in some way it was different! Haltingly, she
    made her way to the window and threw back the catch. Into the room bounded the
    half nude figure of a man!" -- Hugh J Gallagher, Death Mates For The Lust-Lost'
