  text: 'A cruel hoax has been played on your gullible editor, dear readers. The Duty
    Git took a metal tapping machine message the other day, the import of which was
    that Hooting Yard was being offered a tape recording of Dobson''s voice. It was,
    the mysterious messenger said, a brief fragment from a lecture delivered in a
    blizzard-wracked seaside resort some time in the early 1950s. I was dumbfounded.
    If true, this would be the only audio recording of the out-of-print pamphleteer''s
    voice to have survived the conflagration which laid waste the Potato Building.

    I had my suspicions that the caller was merely a deceitful poltroon, of course,
    but after a hastily-arranged staff meeting in the boiler room of Haemoglobin Towers,
    we sent Mrs Gubbins off to the bank to collect the necessary cash in unmarked
    fivers. I deplore the crone''s instinctive criminality, but needs must when the
    devil drives, if I am using that saying correctly, which I suspect I am not.

    Arrangements were made for a crack-of-dawn tryst under Sawdust Bridge. In exchange
    for the sum of fifteen pounds, our representative (Little Severin the Mystic Badger)
    would take possession of a tape recording that, if genuine, would prompt a revolution
    in the ever-exciting field of Dobson studies. Mrs Gubbins tied a little cloth
    bag on the badger, patted him on the head, and sent him on his way. All we could
    do was wait, pacing up and down and drinking endless cups of tea. I tried to distract
    myself by thinking about chrysanthemums and duck densities, but the tension was
    unbearable. Tension often is, in prose.

    Little Severin returned at four o'' clock in the afternoon. Trembling, I took
    the magnetic tape from the pouch and inserted it into some kind of machine that
    would play it. And then I listened to twenty-six seconds of speech that I knew
    in my heart was not Dobson. Mrs Gubbins insisted that it was, but what does she
    know?

    And yet... and yet...

    What do you think, dear reader? Listen. Perhaps that accent is faked? Perhaps
    there is some sort of distortion? Perhaps it should be listened to backwards?
    Letters on this important matter are welcome.'
