  text: "A cruel hoax has been played on your gullible editor, dear readers. The Duty\
    \ Git took a metal tapping machine message the other day, the import of which\
    \ was that Hooting Yard was being offered a tape recording of Dobson's voice.\
    \ It was, the mysterious messenger said, a brief fragment from a lecture delivered\
    \ in a blizzard-wracked seaside resort some time in the early 1950s. I was dumbfounded.\
    \ If true, this would be the only audio recording of the out-of-print pamphleteer's\
    \ voice to have survived the conflagration which laid waste the Potato Building.\n\
    I had my suspicions that the caller was merely a deceitful poltroon, of course,\
    \ but after a hastily-arranged staff meeting in the boiler room of Haemoglobin\
    \ Towers, we sent Mrs Gubbins off to the bank to collect the necessary cash in\
    \ unmarked fivers. I deplore the crone's instinctive criminality, but needs must\
    \ when the devil drives, if I am using that saying correctly, which I suspect\
    \ I am not.\nArrangements were made for a crack-of-dawn tryst under Sawdust Bridge.\
    \ In exchange for the sum of fifteen pounds, our representative (Little Severin\
    \ the Mystic Badger) would take possession of a tape recording that, if genuine,\
    \ would prompt a revolution in the ever-exciting field of Dobson studies. Mrs\
    \ Gubbins tied a little cloth bag on the badger, patted him on the head, and sent\
    \ him on his way. All we could do was wait, pacing up and down and drinking endless\
    \ cups of tea. I tried to distract myself by thinking about chrysanthemums and\
    \ duck densities, but the tension was unbearable. Tension often is, in prose.\n\
    Little Severin returned at four o' clock in the afternoon. Trembling, I took the\
    \ magnetic tape from the pouch and inserted it into some kind of machine that\
    \ would play it. And then I listened to twenty-six seconds of speech that I knew\
    \ in my heart was not Dobson. Mrs Gubbins insisted that it was, but what does\
    \ she know?\nAnd yet\u2026 and yet\u2026\nWhat do you think, dear reader? Listen.\
    \ Perhaps that accent is faked? Perhaps there is some sort of distortion? Perhaps\
    \ it should be listened to backwards? Letters on this important matter are welcome."
