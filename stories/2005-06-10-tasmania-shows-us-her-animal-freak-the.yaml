  text: "\u201CTasmania shows us her animal freak, the platypus paradoxus, the beast\
    \ with a bill, first cousin to our tailors and butchers, all of whom are beasts\
    \ with bills. Our own country has added to the philatelic \u2018zoo\u2019 by placing\
    \ a herd of cattle on one of the Trans-Mississippi issue. That it is a pretty\
    \ picture cannot be denied but the connection between cows and postage stamps\
    \ is not obvious.\u201D \u2014 John N Luff, What Philately Teaches"
