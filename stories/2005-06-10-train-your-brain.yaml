  text: 'In a culture dominated by pap, it is ever more important to exercise our
    brains and keep them supple. There are countless techniques for giving our craniums
    (crania?) a boost, activities which seem to have little or no practical utility
    but send our synapses a-buzzing. Chess, crosswords, and numerical puzzles are
    popular, and an alarming number of people pay homage at the altar of brain guru
    Tony Buzan, he of the sepulchral voice and sinister black cape.
