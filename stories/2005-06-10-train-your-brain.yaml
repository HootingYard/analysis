  text: "In a culture dominated by pap, it is ever more important to exercise our\
    \ brains and keep them supple. There are countless techniques for giving our craniums\
    \ (crania?) a boost, activities which seem to have little or no practical utility\
    \ but send our synapses a-buzzing. Chess, crosswords, and numerical puzzles are\
    \ popular, and an alarming number of people pay homage at the altar of brain guru\
    \ Tony Buzan, he of the sepulchral voice and sinister black cape.\n\nBuzantastic!\n\
    At Hooting Yard we have devised a new method. It's cheap, simple, and\u2014most\
    \ importantly\u2014fun*, and we're very pleased to launch it today with a special\
    \ gala in the field next to the Blister Lane Bypass, which you will probably have\
    \ missed by the time you read this.\nSet to become a popular craze, Memorise All\
    \ The Place-Names In Finland (Suomi)\u2122 can be played by young and old alike.\
    \ Over the next few years, we will be listing all the place-names in Finland (Suomi),\
    \ in no particular order, a dozen at a time. All you need to do is commit them\
    \ to memory, perhaps while eating your breakfast. You may wish to be a solo player,\
    \ or you can gather with other Memorise All The Place-Names In Finland (Suomi)\u2122\
    \ players and hold tournaments. Overexcitement can be a risk at such events, so\
    \ please take advice from your doctor if you suffer from any perilous ailments.\n\
    To start you off, here are the first twelve Finnish place-names: Pet\xE4j\xE4\
    j\xE4rvi, Enonlahti, Tuukkala, H\xF6\xF6pakka, Torp, Aho, Sund, Maarianhamina,\
    \ Eugmo, T\xF6rm\xE4senvaara, Korkeakangas, Lumparland.\n*NOTE : A caveat. One\
    \ must always bear in mind the immortal words of Dr Robert Matthews\u2014\u201C\
    You have to define fun or you will have none\u201D."
