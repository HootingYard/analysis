  text: 'Wearing a bag on your foot is an effective way of stopping water leaking
    into your boot. Such a disaster can occur when the sole of your boot is pitted
    with holes and you step inadvertently into a puddle of rainwater which has fallen
    out of the sky. The sole of your boot may be so pitted because it is old and worn,
    or it may be that the holes appeared all together, of a sudden, for example if
    your boot came into contact with an industrial hole-punch. Whatever the cause
    of the holes in the sole of your boot, which will allow water to seep into your
    sock, you will be very careful to watch out for puddles of rainwater, and other
    watery dangers, such as duckponds and the sea. But I would argue that it is a
    near certainty your vigilance will not be so acute as to withstand the unexpected.
    You may be hailed by an acquaintance aboard a passing bus with a top deck open
    to the elements. A klaxon may sound. You may be temporarily blinded by a mysterious
    hovering ball of incandescent light. In these hypothetical cases, and numerous
    others, your holed boot may splash into a body of water and your sock will become
    drenched, as will your foot, as likely as not, for it is rare for a sock to be
    watertight in this country.


    That is why a bag worn on your foot, over your boot of course, can be such a boon.
    A judiciously chosen bag will stop water entering the holes in the sole of your
    boot and soaking into your sock, making your foot wet. We all know what happened
    to those poor terrified soldiers cowering in trenches during the Great War. Let
    us take precautions not available to them. Remember, they did not have plastic
    bags.

    You will have noticed the words "judiciously chosen" in the second sentence of
    the previous paragraph. I inserted them when preparing the final draft of this
    text, when it struck me with tremendous force that to say merely "a bag will stop
    water entering the holes in the sole of your boot and soaking into your sock,
    making your foot wet" was a laughably inadequate prescription. I did not actually
    laugh, but I thumped my forehead with the flat of my hand and groaned at my inexactitude.


    Selecting the bag to wear on your foot is not onerous. You just have to ensure
    that it is a bag which will be impervious to water, hence the reference to plastic
    bags. Think polythene, or even rubber. It is tempting to advise you against using
    a paper bag, but you already know that a paper bag would be useless for our present
    purposes. If you do not know that using a paper bag will leave you with a leaking
    boot and a soaked sock and foot, you are either too young to be reading this or
    you have an almost inconceivable lack of common sense, like Tim, who put a paper
    bag on his boot when he dangled his foot into a paddling pool.

    It is for Tim, and those like Tim, that this article has been written. When you
    meet Tim, and see at a glance that he has only one leg, you will understand why
    throughout I have referred to the boot and the sock and the foot in the singular.
    If you are a biped, you can still reap the benefits of my thoughtful advice by
    making the necessary adjustments to the text in your head. I am in no mood to
    repeat the whole thing again, ever, even if flooding becomes widespread in these
    dismal fens where we live out our dismal lives under a dismal sky that threatens
    rain again today.
