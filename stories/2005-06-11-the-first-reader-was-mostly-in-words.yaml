  text: '"The First Reader was mostly in words of one syllable. In this book we find
    the story of the lame dog that, when cured, brought another lame dog to be doctored;
    of the kind boy who freed his caged bird; of the cruel boy who drowned the cat
    and pulled wings and legs from flies;... of the chimney sweep who was tempted
    to steal a gold watch but put it back and was thereafter educated by its owner;
    of the whisky boy; and of the mischievous boy who played ghost and made another
    boy insane. Nearly every lesson has a moral clearly stated in formal didactic
    words at its close." -- Henry H Vail, A History Of The McGuffey Readers'
