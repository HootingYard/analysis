  text: "\u201CThe First Reader was mostly in words of one syllable. In this book\
    \ we find the story of the lame dog that, when cured, brought another lame dog\
    \ to be doctored; of the kind boy who freed his caged bird; of the cruel boy who\
    \ drowned the cat and pulled wings and legs from flies;\u2026 of the chimney sweep\
    \ who was tempted to steal a gold watch but put it back and was thereafter educated\
    \ by its owner; of the whisky boy; and of the mischievous boy who played ghost\
    \ and made another boy insane. Nearly every lesson has a moral clearly stated\
    \ in formal didactic words at its close.\u201D \u2014 Henry H Vail, A History\
    \ Of The McGuffey Readers"
