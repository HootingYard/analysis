  text: "I have mentioned before the incidental treasures to be found in Hansard,\
    \ the official record of parliamentary debates. I was saved the bother of ploughing\
    \ through it yesterday because Simon Hoggart of the Guardian\u2014the \u201CThird\
    \ Man\u201D of Blunkettgate notoriety, lest we forget\u2014picked out some splendid\
    \ examples of the timeless wisdom spouted by our rulers. Read these words, digest\
    \ them, and know that you have become an immeasurably better-informed person:\n\
    \n\u201CHorses have greater need of passports than we do.\u201D\n\u201CThis whole\
    \ debate is being dominated by badgers!\u201D\n\u201CIf in doubt, kill something.\u201D"
