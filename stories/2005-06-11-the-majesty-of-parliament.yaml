  text: 'I have mentioned before the incidental treasures to be found in Hansard,
    the official record of parliamentary debates. I was saved the bother of ploughing
    through it yesterday because Simon Hoggart of the Guardian--the "Third Man" of
    Blunkettgate notoriety, lest we forget--picked out some splendid examples of the
    timeless wisdom spouted by our rulers. Read these words, digest them, and know
    that you have become an immeasurably better-informed person:


    "Horses have greater need of passports than we do."

    "This whole debate is being dominated by badgers!"

    "If in doubt, kill something."'
