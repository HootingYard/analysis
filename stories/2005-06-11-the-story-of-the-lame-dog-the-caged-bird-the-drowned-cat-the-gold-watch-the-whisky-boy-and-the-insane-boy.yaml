  text: "Once upon a time, there was an insane boy who could only be becalmed by listening\
    \ to prog rock.\nOn Monday, a Barclay James Harvest album was played to him.\n\
    On Tuesday, there was a power cut, and in his mania the insane boy went out and\
    \ attacked a lame dog. The dog's name was Hoo-Boo-Goo. It was a winter ghost dog.\n\
    On Wednesday, electricity was restored and the insane boy listened over and over\
    \ again to Pantagruel's Nativity by Gentle Giant.\nOn Thursday the insane boy\
    \ absconded from his deep dark dank cellar and headed for the hills. With one\
    \ swift inhuman movement he plucked a starling from the sky and put it in a birdcage.\n\
    On Friday his keepers forced the insane boy to listen to Atomic Rooster at an\
    \ almost imperceptible volume.\nOn Saturday the insane boy took advantage of a\
    \ moment's inattention on the part of his guards to drown a cat in a puddle. The\
    \ cat was called Fad-Fod-Flap and it was fourteen years old.\nOn Sunday Carl Palmer\
    \ of Emerson Lake And Palmer visited the insane boy and played a drum solo that\
    \ lasted all day.\nOn Monday the insane boy smashed a gold watch into a thousand\
    \ bits with his terrifyingly pale fists.\nOn Tuesday the insane boy had an iPod\
    \ with only one track clamped to his head. The song was A Plague Of Lighthouse\
    \ Keepers by Van Der Graaf Generator.\nOn Wednesday the insane boy managed to\
    \ smuggle a bottle of spirits into his filthy cell. The warders wrote a report\
    \ for Captain Jarvis in which they called the insane boy \u201Cthe whisky boy\u201D\
    , inaccurately, as the bottle contained turps.\nOn Thursday the insane boy begged\
    \ to hear Tales Of Topographic Oceans by Yes.\nOn Friday he was pronounced incurable.\n\
    That story was in words of more than one syllable. It has no moral."
