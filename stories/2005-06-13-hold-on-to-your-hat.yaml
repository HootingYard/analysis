  text: 'He''s back! He''s making grunty noises! It''s the Grunty Man! Just when you
    thought it was safe to let go of your hat, June sees the return of the very very
    frightening Grunty Man, who stalks your nightmares, makes his grunty noises, and
    then stalks some more. Well may you shudder, milksop! Shudder as much as you like,
    but make sure you hold on to your hat. It has been known for centuries that holding
    on to your hat is an effective way of stopping it flying off your head as you
    quake in fear, something we have seen happen so often in times of terror. And
    no time is more terrible than the time when the Grunty Man comes a-stalking, making
    his grunty noises. But wait! If you are in the habit of dyeing your hat, make
    sure the dye is dry before you hold it, or you will get dye on your hand, and
    being so marked, the Grunty Man will sniff you out as he comes stalking and grunting
    and you will be fodder for his maw.

    The Passion Of The Grunty Man opens at the Excelsior Cinema, O''Houlihan''s Wharf,
    very very soon.'
