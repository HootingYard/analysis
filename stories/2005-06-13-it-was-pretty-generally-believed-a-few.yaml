  text: "\u201CIt was pretty generally believed a few years ago that in large fires\
    \ kept continually burning there was generated an animal called a salamander.\
    \ It required seven years to grow and attain maturity, and if the fires were kept\
    \ burning longer than that there was great danger that the animal might make its\
    \ escape from its fiery matrix, and, if this should happen, it would range round\
    \ the world, destroying all it came in contact with, itself almost indestructible.\
    \ Hence large fires, such as those of blast furnaces in ironworks, were extinguished\
    \ before the expiry of the seven years, and the embryo monster taken out.\u201D\
