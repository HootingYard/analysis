  text: '"It was pretty generally believed a few years ago that in large fires kept
    continually burning there was generated an animal called a salamander. It required
    seven years to grow and attain maturity, and if the fires were kept burning longer
    than that there was great danger that the animal might make its escape from its
    fiery matrix, and, if this should happen, it would range round the world, destroying
    all it came in contact with, itself almost indestructible. Hence large fires,
    such as those of blast furnaces in ironworks, were extinguished before the expiry
    of the seven years, and the embryo monster taken out." -- James Napier, Folk Lore'
