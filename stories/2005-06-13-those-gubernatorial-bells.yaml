  text: "O how they clanged, those gubernatorial bells! It is eighty years now since\
    \ their peals sounded, but still I hear them in my head. They clanged ceaselessly,\
    \ all day and all night, deafeningly loud, for years on end. Cows stood dazed\
    \ in the fields around the bell-tower, many, many cows, too many cows to count,\
    \ all dazed and stunned, and in those days no cowherds came to give them succour.\n\
    In your tongue, \u201Cgubernatorial\u201D refers to governorship, but in my land\
    \ at that time the gubernatorial bells were the ever-clanging bells of the ferocious\
    \ tyrant known variously as the Gub or Guber or Gubernat. Some said the Gub was\
    \ a fiend in human form, but none had ever seen it, so how could they be so sure,\
    \ muttering darkly in the corner of the tavern, professing a knowledge they did\
    \ not have, rewarded with a refilled tankard by some credulous foreign person\
    \ on an ill-advised visit to our bell-blasted village?\nDobson came here once.\
    \ He crashed through the tavern doors, a clumsy adventurer\u2014for he was young\
    \ then\u2014and jabbered at anyone who would listen that he wanted to go up the\
    \ hill to the castle, to meet the Gubernat face to face.\n\u201CAnd what do you\
    \ think you'll find?\u201D sneered an old frogman in the last stages of drunken\
    \ despair. Within seconds he keeled off his stool and lay insensible in the sawdust.\
    \ Dobson answered him regardless.\n\u201CI know not what I shall find, old man,\u201D\
    \ he announced, \u201CI know only that if those benighted bells are ever to stop\
    \ clanging, the Gubernat must be dragged from its perch in the castle atop the\
    \ hill. Then you will know peace, as will the countless cows in your pretty fields,\
    \ who now are dazed and stunned.\u201D\n\u201COur fields are indeed pretty,\u201D\
    \ muttered someone lurking in the gloom, \u201CAs is your speech, young Dobson.\
    \ But the Gub will never allow you into its presence. The last swashbuckling foreign\
    \ person who came here on a mission such as yours ran away gibbering along Hollyhock\
    \ Lane. They recovered his corpse from the duckpond a week later. When our Necropod\
    \ Woman made her examination, do you know what she found? His brain had been sucked\
    \ out into space!\u201D\nThere is an art to saying \u201CPshaw!\u201D with conviction.\
    \ Later in life, as you know, Dobson was one of the great pshawers, but back then\
    \ he was callow and shallow, and the \u201Cpshaw\u201D he pshawed was a pitiful\
    \ pip on his lips. In truth, he was unnerved by this news. He resolved to obtain\
    \ a letter of introduction from the Gubernat's solicitors, Buttercups and Tod,\
    \ whose office he had passed on his way from the railway station. He pranced out\
    \ of the tavern and retraced his steps.\nNeither Buttercups nor Tod was available,\
    \ he learned. Cow business kept them fully occupied, for there were numberless\
    \ cows and only the pair of them, the one greasy, the other mute. Dobson sat on\
    \ a lump of stone in the market square, biting his fingernails and praying for\
    \ the insane clanging of the gubernatorial bells to stop. That is how I found\
    \ him, so many years ago, on that gorgeous day when first we met, when still the\
    \ cowherds shunned the cows, when the bells still clanged, in that village far\
    \ away, where I plied my trade as the Necropod Woman, fruitlessly searching for\
    \ brains sucked into space, and for a pamphleteer whose pamphlets were not yet\
    \ written, not yet read."
