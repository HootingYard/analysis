  text: 'O how they clanged, those gubernatorial bells! It is eighty years now since
    their peals sounded, but still I hear them in my head. They clanged ceaselessly,
    all day and all night, deafeningly loud, for years on end. Cows stood dazed in
    the fields around the bell-tower, many, many cows, too many cows to count, all
    dazed and stunned, and in those days no cowherds came to give them succour.

    In your tongue, "gubernatorial" refers to governorship, but in my land at that
    time the gubernatorial bells were the ever-clanging bells of the ferocious tyrant
    known variously as the Gub or Guber or Gubernat. Some said the Gub was a fiend
    in human form, but none had ever seen it, so how could they be so sure, muttering
    darkly in the corner of the tavern, professing a knowledge they did not have,
    rewarded with a refilled tankard by some credulous foreign person on an ill-advised
    visit to our bell-blasted village?

    Dobson came here once. He crashed through the tavern doors, a clumsy adventurer--for
    he was young then--and jabbered at anyone who would listen that he wanted to go
    up the hill to the castle, to meet the Gubernat face to face.

    "And what do you think you''ll find?" sneered an old frogman in the last stages
    of drunken despair. Within seconds he keeled off his stool and lay insensible
    in the sawdust. Dobson answered him regardless.

    "I know not what I shall find, old man," he announced, "I know only that if those
    benighted bells are ever to stop clanging, the Gubernat must be dragged from its
    perch in the castle atop the hill. Then you will know peace, as will the countless
    cows in your pretty fields, who now are dazed and stunned."

    "Our fields are indeed pretty," muttered someone lurking in the gloom, "As is
    your speech, young Dobson. But the Gub will never allow you into its presence.
    The last swashbuckling foreign person who came here on a mission such as yours
    ran away gibbering along Hollyhock Lane. They recovered his corpse from the duckpond
    a week later. When our Necropod Woman made her examination, do you know what she
    found? His brain had been sucked out into space!"

    There is an art to saying "Pshaw!" with conviction. Later in life, as you know,
    Dobson was one of the great pshawers, but back then he was callow and shallow,
    and the "pshaw" he pshawed was a pitiful pip on his lips. In truth, he was unnerved
    by this news. He resolved to obtain a letter of introduction from the Gubernat''s
    solicitors, Buttercups and Tod, whose office he had passed on his way from the
    railway station. He pranced out of the tavern and retraced his steps.

    Neither Buttercups nor Tod was available, he learned. Cow business kept them fully
    occupied, for there were numberless cows and only the pair of them, the one greasy,
    the other mute. Dobson sat on a lump of stone in the market square, biting his
    fingernails and praying for the insane clanging of the gubernatorial bells to
    stop. That is how I found him, so many years ago, on that gorgeous day when first
    we met, when still the cowherds shunned the cows, when the bells still clanged,
    in that village far away, where I plied my trade as the Necropod Woman, fruitlessly
    searching for brains sucked into space, and for a pamphleteer whose pamphlets
    were not yet written, not yet read.'
