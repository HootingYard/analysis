  text: "\u201CAnother blessed \u2018passing-over\u2019 I viewed was that of a little\
    \ girl on earth crippled by an accident in which she was run over by a heavy dray,\
    \ and which necessitated the amputation of her leg. Her mother had \u2018died\u2019\
    \ shortly before this accident, and she was left in the charge of people who had\
    \ no kindliness, were hard and callous, her one sympathetic companion a little\
    \ spaniel pup. Without this dear dumb brute, existence would have been well-nigh\
    \ unbearable. A neglected chill resulting in pneumonia happily finished off this\
    \ poor little human fragment and relegated her to a sphere where love and happiness\
    \ awaited her. The mother, attended by a band, of which I was a member, watched\
    \ at the \u2018death\u2019-bed of this sweet little creature, and when the last\
    \ breath of life had been drawn in that frail body, helped the luminous soul to\
    \ ascend to a fairer setting.\u201D \u2014 Lilian Walbrook, The Case Of Lester\
    \ Coltman"
