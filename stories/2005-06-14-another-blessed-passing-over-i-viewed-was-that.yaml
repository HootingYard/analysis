  text: '"Another blessed ''passing-over'' I viewed was that of a little girl on earth
    crippled by an accident in which she was run over by a heavy dray, and which necessitated
    the amputation of her leg. Her mother had ''died'' shortly before this accident,
    and she was left in the charge of people who had no kindliness, were hard and
    callous, her one sympathetic companion a little spaniel pup. Without this dear
    dumb brute, existence would have been well-nigh unbearable. A neglected chill
    resulting in pneumonia happily finished off this poor little human fragment and
    relegated her to a sphere where love and happiness awaited her. The mother, attended
    by a band, of which I was a member, watched at the ''death''-bed of this sweet
    little creature, and when the last breath of life had been drawn in that frail
    body, helped the luminous soul to ascend to a fairer setting." -- Lilian Walbrook,
    The Case Of Lester Coltman'
