  text: 'The story above mentions bargain price stationery. I came across a rather
    more enticing offer today, while reading the always-interesting Religion News
    Blog.

    In my more puritanical moments, I have been known to declare that all advertising
    is hateful, and that this would be a far, far better world without it. Such pronouncements
    reckon without eBay, which appears to have infiltrated every cranny of the internet.

    There I was, browsing the Religion News Blog for further detail on the magnificent
    headline Little Pebble Planned To Start ''A New Race'', when I noticed this, at
    the bottom of the page, tucked among the adverts:

    Priests : Quality new and used items. Search for priests now! : www.ebay.com

    That exclamation mark is priceless.'
