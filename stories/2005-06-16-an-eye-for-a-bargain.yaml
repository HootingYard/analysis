  text: "The story above mentions bargain price stationery. I came across a rather\
    \ more enticing offer today, while reading the always-interesting Religion News\
    \ Blog.\nIn my more puritanical moments, I have been known to declare that all\
    \ advertising is hateful, and that this would be a far, far better world without\
    \ it. Such pronouncements reckon without eBay, which appears to have infiltrated\
    \ every cranny of the internet.\nThere I was, browsing the Religion News Blog\
    \ for further detail on the magnificent headline Little Pebble Planned To Start\
    \ \u2018A New Race\u2019, when I noticed this, at the bottom of the page, tucked\
    \ among the adverts:\nPriests : Quality new and used items. Search for priests\
    \ now! : www.ebay.com\nThat exclamation mark is priceless."
