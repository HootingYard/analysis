    \ has it been known to suffer from some common ailments of the horse?\nE\u2014\
    A horse I have. A knowledge of horse health I have not.\nB\u2014Better put \u201C\
    horse ill-health\u201D than \u201Chorse health\u201D. Lack of horse ailment knowledge\
    \ would suggest you know not of spavins, sweeney, ringbone, windgalls, poll evil,\
    \ callous, cracked heels, galls of all kinds, fresh wounds, sprains, bruises,\
    \ fistula, sitfast, sand cracks, strains, lameness, foundered feet, scratches\
    \ or grease, mange, rheumatism, bites of animals, external poisons, painful nervous\
    \ affections, frost bites, boils, corns, whitlows, burns and scalds, chilblains,\
    \ chapped hands, cramps, contraction of the muscles, swellings, weakness of the\
    \ joints, caked breast, &c.\nE\u2014I know them not but find it hard to credit\
    \ they are all ailments of horse.\nB\u2014They are indeed not entirely those of\
    \ the horse, but of that no matter. My point is that by making purchase of Geo.\
    \ W. Merchant's Celebrated Gargling Oil, unparalleled in the history of medicine\
    \ as the most remarkable external application ever discovered for horses and human\
    \ flesh, you will cure your horse of all the specified ailments.\nE\u2014I shall\
    \ make such purchase without further ado.\nHooting Yard is indebted to Odd Ends.\
    \ Go there and be delighted."
