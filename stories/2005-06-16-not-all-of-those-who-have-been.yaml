  text: "\u201CNot all of those who have been stimulated by the new freedom of speech\
    \ to thrust themselves forward as teachers of sex hygiene, and as social reformers,\
    \ are safe leaders. Some are ignorant and unaware that enthusiasm is not a satisfactory\
    \ substitute for knowledge. Some are hysterical. At a recent purity convention,\
    \ a woman said, \u2018I know little about the facts, but it is wonderful how much\
    \ ignorance can accomplish when accompanied by devotion and persistence\u2019\
    . That declaration was applauded.\u201D \u2014 William Trufant Foster, The Social\
    \ Emergency : Studies In Sex Hygiene And Morals"
