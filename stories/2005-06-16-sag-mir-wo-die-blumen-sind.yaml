  text: "After breakfast, I did a quick set of Bl\xF6tzmann Exercises (Second Handbook),\
    \ and then I hoisted my rucksack on to my back and strode manfully off to the\
    \ countryside to look at all the Blumen. The lake next to the decoy airfield was\
    \ full of decoy ducks. For the first time I noticed a shabby clapboard hut which,\
    \ according to a sign on its roof, was selling items of stationery at bargain\
    \ prices. I strode manfully across the verdant meadows, stepping on innumerable\
    \ Blumen as I went, and pushed my way into the tenebrous interior of the hut,\
    \ wherein sat a crone sharpening a pencil.\n\u201CHail, crone!\u201D I cried.\n\
    \u201CHail, wayfaring rucksack-person!\u201D yelled the crone, deafeningly. I\
    \ was disconcerted. From her withered old body, festooned in noisome rags, piped\
    \ the voice of a youngster. I wondered, with a start, if my manful strides had\
    \ led me inadvertently into the spooky Land of Gaar, reputed to be teeming with\
    \ imps and sprites, spider gods and changelings, and with things that should not\
    \ be. But I had faced peril before, and I had eaten a large breakfast. Quick thinking\
    \ has always been my trademark, so I nipped out of the hut and uprooted a fistful\
    \ of calla lilies to give to the crone. If she was a malevolent being from a parallel\
    \ universe the Blumen would appease her, and if she was but a crone, there would\
    \ be no harm done.\n\u201CHail once more, crone!\u201D I declaimed, skipping back\
    \ into the hut, \u201CHere, have these calla lilies to brighten up your hovel!\u201D\
    \nThe crone accepted my gift graciously. As she reached, creakily, to take the\
    \ Blumen, a slight disarrangement of her rags revealed the source of her arrestingly\
    \ youthful voice. Wires trailed from her sleeve, and following their path across\
    \ the floor I saw that she was attached to a Standard Curpin Voicebox. Mischievously,\
    \ I turned the dial to the \u201CUS Vice Presidents\u201D setting, so when next\
    \ the crone spoke she would sound exactly like Spiro Agnew*.\nI was about to ask\
    \ the price of pencil sharpeners when a shelduck waddled into the hut. At least,\
    \ I thought it was a shelduck. It may have been a teal. Its arrival sent the crone\
    \ into a frenzy of terror. I had to turn down the volume on the Voicebox, so loudly\
    \ did she scream. The teal or shelduck glared at her with uncanny purple eyes,\
    \ and she carried on screaming.\nThere was little I could do. My training never\
    \ prepared me to deal with terrifying ducks. Not that I was scared of the teal\
    \ or shelduck myself, you understand. I fear nothing any more, not even those\
    \ recurring nightmares I have about buttons, for I have been following Bl\xF6\
    tzmann's Second Handbook for five years. That is why I am able to stride manfully\
    \ about the countryside trampling on Blumen without a care in the world.\nI picked\
    \ up a pencil sharpener and placed a handful of coins in its place. The crone\
    \ still screamed, the duck still stared. I left the hut, and was blinded by the\
    \ sun, bathing the fields in an unearthly light. As I approached Gruesome Ditch,\
    \ and my eyes adjusted, I saw that all the Blumen had vanished without trace.\
    \ And no birds did sing.\n\n*NOTE : It has not escaped my attention that Spiro\
    \ Agnew is an anagram of both Grow A Penis and Grow A Spine."
