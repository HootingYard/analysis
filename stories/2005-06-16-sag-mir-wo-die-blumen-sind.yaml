  text: 'After breakfast, I did a quick set of Blotzmann Exercises (Second Handbook),
    and then I hoisted my rucksack on to my back and strode manfully off to the countryside
    to look at all the Blumen. The lake next to the decoy airfield was full of decoy
    ducks. For the first time I noticed a shabby clapboard hut which, according to
    a sign on its roof, was selling items of stationery at bargain prices. I strode
    manfully across the verdant meadows, stepping on innumerable Blumen as I went,
    and pushed my way into the tenebrous interior of the hut, wherein sat a crone
    sharpening a pencil.

    "Hail, crone!" I cried.

    "Hail, wayfaring rucksack-person!" yelled the crone, deafeningly. I was disconcerted.
    From her withered old body, festooned in noisome rags, piped the voice of a youngster.
    I wondered, with a start, if my manful strides had led me inadvertently into the
    spooky Land of Gaar, reputed to be teeming with imps and sprites, spider gods
    and changelings, and with things that should not be. But I had faced peril before,
    and I had eaten a large breakfast. Quick thinking has always been my trademark,
    so I nipped out of the hut and uprooted a fistful of calla lilies to give to the
    crone. If she was a malevolent being from a parallel universe the Blumen would
    appease her, and if she was but a crone, there would be no harm done.

    "Hail once more, crone!" I declaimed, skipping back into the hut, "Here, have
    these calla lilies to brighten up your hovel!"

    The crone accepted my gift graciously. As she reached, creakily, to take the Blumen,
    a slight disarrangement of her rags revealed the source of her arrestingly youthful
    voice. Wires trailed from her sleeve, and following their path across the floor
    I saw that she was attached to a Standard Curpin Voicebox. Mischievously, I turned
    the dial to the "US Vice Presidents" setting, so when next the crone spoke she
    would sound exactly like Spiro Agnew*.

    I was about to ask the price of pencil sharpeners when a shelduck waddled into
    the hut. At least, I thought it was a shelduck. It may have been a teal. Its arrival
    sent the crone into a frenzy of terror. I had to turn down the volume on the Voicebox,
    so loudly did she scream. The teal or shelduck glared at her with uncanny purple
    eyes, and she carried on screaming.

    There was little I could do. My training never prepared me to deal with terrifying
    ducks. Not that I was scared of the teal or shelduck myself, you understand. I
    fear nothing any more, not even those recurring nightmares I have about buttons,
    for I have been following Blotzmann''s Second Handbook for five years. That is
    why I am able to stride manfully about the countryside trampling on Blumen without
    a care in the world.

    I picked up a pencil sharpener and placed a handful of coins in its place. The
    crone still screamed, the duck still stared. I left the hut, and was blinded by
    the sun, bathing the fields in an unearthly light. As I approached Gruesome Ditch,
    and my eyes adjusted, I saw that all the Blumen had vanished without trace. And
    no birds did sing.


    *NOTE : It has not escaped my attention that Spiro Agnew is an anagram of both
    Grow A Penis and Grow A Spine.'
