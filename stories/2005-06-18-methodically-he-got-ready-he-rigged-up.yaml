  text: "\u201CMethodically he got ready. He rigged up electrical apparatus which\
    \ would add mixtures of conglomerate matter to the rocket blasts of the Comet.\
    \ He did the same with his blast guns. Then, tight-lipped, hard-eyed, dressed\
    \ once more in the space suit, blast guns ready, he returned to the controls.\
    \ The Comet shook and shivered with the recurrent rocket blasts as he flashed\
    \ through space toward the vast, glowing globe of the aliens\u2026 Blackness plucked\
    \ at his senses. He could tell by the sudden clinking as loose pieces of metal\
    \ flew to the walls and clung there, that an alien energy ray had brought him\
    \ to a halt. He had crashed through into the vessel of the energy things\u2014\
    and now they were holding him there, a prisoner!\u201D \u2014 Myer Krulfeld, The\
    \ Thing From Antares"
