  text: '"Methodically he got ready. He rigged up electrical apparatus which would
    add mixtures of conglomerate matter to the rocket blasts of the Comet. He did
    the same with his blast guns. Then, tight-lipped, hard-eyed, dressed once more
    in the space suit, blast guns ready, he returned to the controls. The Comet shook
    and shivered with the recurrent rocket blasts as he flashed through space toward
    the vast, glowing globe of the aliens... Blackness plucked at his senses. He could
    tell by the sudden clinking as loose pieces of metal flew to the walls and clung
    there, that an alien energy ray had brought him to a halt. He had crashed through
    into the vessel of the energy things--and now they were holding him there, a prisoner!"
