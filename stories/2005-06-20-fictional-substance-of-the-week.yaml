  text: "This week, the Hooting Yard Fictional Substance Of The Week is ichor.\nImagine\
    \ you are in Ancient Greece, taking a stroll on Mount Parnassus. One of the Gods\
    \ of Greek mythology suddenly appears in front of you. Imagine too that you are\
    \ not of a placid and thoughtful nature (as I am sure you are) but a temperamental\
    \ hothead prone to violence. Surprised by the sudden appearance of a Deity\u2014\
    it does not matter which one\u2014your first instinct is to lash out in terror\
    \ and alarm. You sock the God on its jaw, cutting its lip. Now, it is not blood\
    \ which flows from the wound, but ichor, a colourless ethereal fluid which ran\
    \ through the veins of all the Greek Gods. If you are of a vampiric bent, be sure\
    \ not to suck the ichor oozing from the God's cut lip, for though it confers immortality\
    \ on the Deities, it will be ruinous to you as a mere human, for it will poison\
    \ you.\nLord Byron wrote : \u201CHe pattered with his keys at a great rate, /\
    \ And sweated through his apostolic skin: / Of course his perspiration was but\
    \ ichor, / Or some such other spiritual liquor.\u201D That gives you the correct\
    \ pronunciation.\nWhether ichor is the root of the word icky, as in \u201CThat\
    \ sponge pudding was so icky that I felt a great wave of nausea o'erwhelm me to\
    \ the point of Lovecraftian horror\u201D is a moot point.\nSometimes ichor is\
    \ not fictional. In geology, ichor is a technical term denoting a fluid or emanation\
    \ from a magma which is held to cause granitization of rock. And in medical parlance,\
    \ it means the watery ooze from an abrasion, scar, or wound. Do not be mistaken,\
    \ next time such an ooze seeps from one of your wounds, that you have somehow\
    \ been transformed into an immortal superbeing. Rather than saying, as the Emperor\
    \ Vespasian did on his deathbed, \u201CI must be turning into a God\u201D, you\
    \ should instead go and see your doctor. All the better if your doctor's surgery\
    \ is at the lip of a magma-riddled volcano.\nNext week's Hooting Yard Fictional\
    \ Substance Of The Week will be phlogiston."
