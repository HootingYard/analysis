  text: '

    Here is Andrea Mantegna''s painting of the Immortals disporting themselves on
    Mount Parnassus. He painted it in 1497, so it is not a life study. Nevertheless,
    if you peer at it very, very closely, you may be able to spot a drop of ichor.
    If you are too impatient to peer studiously, you will just have to imagine the
    colourless ethereal fluid coursing through their veins.'
