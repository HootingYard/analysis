  text: '"We ask you to be so good as to pass a law requiring the closing of all windows,
    dormers, skylights, inside and outside shutters, curtains, casements, bull''s-eyes,
    deadlights, and blinds--in short, all openings, holes, chinks, and fissures through
    which the light of the sun is wont to enter houses." -- Frederic Bastiat, A Petition
    From The Manufacturers Of Candles, Tapers, Lanterns, Sticks, Street Lamps, Snuffers,
    And Extinguishers, And From Producers Of Tallow, Oil, Resin, Alcohol, And Generally
    Of Everything Connected With Lighting'
