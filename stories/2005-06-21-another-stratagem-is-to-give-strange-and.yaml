  text: "\u201CAnother Stratagem is, to give strange and hard names to their Medicines,\
    \ such as are Pilulae radiis Solis extractae, and in English is no more than Pills\
    \ dryed to that consistence by the Sun-Beams, which ignorant people have thought\
    \ were made of the Sun Beams\u2026 I have heard a Pseudochymist blasphemously\
    \ brag, he saw in the making of a grand Elixir, the Quintessence of the Trinity\
    \ in Unity, and infinite other pitiful captivations of silly people, to be seen\
    \ on every Gate and Post of this City; such as are the Spirit of the Salt of the\
    \ World, Panchymagogon, and other ten-footed Greek names, and some other Mongrel\
    \ nonsensical ones compounded of several Languages; promising certain, speedy,\
    \ and concealed Cure of incurable Diseases.\u201D \u2014 Christopher Merrett,\
