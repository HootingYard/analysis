  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes the increasingly irritating Chris De Burhg [sic]. I fear
    the man is a monomaniac. Yesterday on your website I was intrigued to read about
    ichor, alongside the piece on sieves and basins in which you kindly reprinted
    my letter. This got me to wondering--if I poured ichor into a basin through a
    sieve, would there be any residue in the sieve, and if so, what would it be?

    Tempting though it is to ignore Mr De Burhg''s [sic] witterings, and throw some
    more pebbles at starlings and crows, I have been told he is a fearsome litigant
    and will probably take me to court if I do not address his latest question.

    In order to pour a quantity of ichor through a sieve into a basin, you would first
    have to wound, lacerate, or perhaps apply leeches to an immortal Ancient Greek
    deity. This is no easy task. I would go so far as to say it is impossible. But
    for the sake of argument, let us say you manage to waylay a passing God on a footpath.
    You poke at it with a spike and draw ichor, and collect the ichor in a small bowl
    held under the wound. We shall assume that the God is so surprised by your attack
    that it does not immediately smite you with divine retribution.

    Leaving the Deity crumpled by the wayside, you scuttle off to the patch of ground
    hidden behind a pile of rocks where you have earlier stored your sieve and basin.
    You pour the ichor from the bowl through the sieve into the basin, and you note
    that there is not a trace of residue left in the sieve. Being an ethereal divine
    fluid, ichor by definition contains no impurities which would get snagged within
    the lattice of the sieve.

    I trust that answers your foolish query, Mr De Burhg [sic]. Please do not write
    to me again unless you have something pertinent to say.'
