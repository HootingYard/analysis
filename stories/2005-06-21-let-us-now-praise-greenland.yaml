  text: "\nReaders fond of desolate icy nothingness will join me today in celebrating\
    \ Greenland, for it is the National Day of that bleak paradise, four-fifths of\
    \ which is covered in ice. Yes, it is Kalaallit Nunaat of which I speak, the land\
    \ whose flag is shown above, the land which used to be shown as Gruntland on early\
    \ maps. I would like to think it was so called because it was the home of the\
    \ Grunty Man who plods so menacingly through the nightmares of tiny children,\
    \ but here \u201CGrunt\u201D simply means \u201CGround\u201D.\nJust as there is\
    \ no Grunty Man in Greenland, nor are there any railways, rivers or canals. There\
    \ are a few roads, true, but only the glorious and lovely towns of Ivittuut and\
    \ Kangilinnguit are connected by one, every other human settlement being isolated.\
    \ Look, here is a handy map:\n\nIf you are keen on hip hop music, you may wish\
    \ to go to Greenland to check out the Nuuk Posse, top purveyors of the genre in\
    \ that part of the world. Be careful, however, that you do not prolong your stay\
    \ to the point where you succumb to piblokto.\nSource : Happy Days In The Icy\
