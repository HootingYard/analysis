    Readers fond of desolate icy nothingness will join me today in celebrating Greenland,
    for it is the National Day of that bleak paradise, four-fifths of which is covered
    in ice. Yes, it is Kalaallit Nunaat of which I speak, the land whose flag is shown
    above, the land which used to be shown as Gruntland on early maps. I would like
    to think it was so called because it was the home of the Grunty Man who plods
    so menacingly through the nightmares of tiny children, but here "Grunt" simply
    means "Ground".

    Just as there is no Grunty Man in Greenland, nor are there any railways, rivers
    or canals. There are a few roads, true, but only the glorious and lovely towns
    of Ivittuut and Kangilinnguit are connected by one, every other human settlement
    being isolated. Look, here is a handy map:


    If you are keen on hip hop music, you may wish to go to Greenland to check out
    the Nuuk Posse, top purveyors of the genre in that part of the world. Be careful,
    however, that you do not prolong your stay to the point where you succumb to piblokto.
