  text: 'Mustard? Custard! is an exciting parlour game for all the family, best played
    in pitch darkness. While the lights are still on, each player is dealt a hand
    of six cards. These are then traded frantically until someone has a hand of a
    single suit. This player is designated the timekeeper, and is also in charge of
    the light switch. Each person then places their cards face down on the table.

    The timekeeper draws the curtains, closes any shutters, and turns off the light.
    Using hoops, counters and coat-hangers, the players dash wildly around the room
    bumping into furniture, walls and each other, all the while screaming at the tops
    of their voices. Points are gained for bloodcurdling shrieks, bestial howling,
    and unbridled panic.

    After precisely three hours have passed, the timekeeper switches the lights back
    on. The players have ten seconds to claw their way to the table and collect their
    cards. A non-participating family member or friend then creeps into the room with
    a trolley on which there are two large bowls, one filled to the brim with mustard
    and the other with custard. Big iron spoons are distributed to each player. Starting
    with the person holding the best hand, and then in descending order, each player
    plunges their spoon into one of the bowls, gulps down the yellow goo, and shouts
    "Mustard!" or "Custard!" accordingly.

    When everyone has had their turn, the whole game is repeated from scratch, with
    the important difference that at the end, those who devoured a spoonful of custard
    must choose the mustard, and vice versa.

    There is no outright winner. As in all sports and pastimes, the important thing
    is taking part.'
