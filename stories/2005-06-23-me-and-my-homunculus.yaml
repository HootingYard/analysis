  text: 'The "insane root" which Mrs Campbell Praed refers to in the above quotation
    is likely to be a mandrake. The bifurcated root of the plant resembles a human
    figure, or so people have thought throughout the ages. There is a legend that
    when the mandrake-person is pulled from the ground, it shrieks in pain, and this
    cry is able to madden, deafen or even kill an unprotected human being. One way
    of pulling a mandrake out of the ground safely is given as follows: "A furrow
    must be dug around the root until its lower part is exposed, then a dog is tied
    to it, after which the person tying the dog must get away. The dog then endeavours
    to follow him, and so easily pulls up the root, but dies suddenly instead of his
    master. After this the root can be handled without fear."


    Being a miniature person, the mandrake root is thus a type of homunculus. The
    first homunculus was made by that old rascal Paracelsus out of a bag of bones,
    sperm, skin fragments and animal hair, these ingredients laid in the ground surrounded
    by horse manure for forty days, at which point the embryo formed. It seems likely
    that Paracelsus was making this up, as I tried it. I was looking forward to having
    a little homunculus running about the place, and was even thinking up a suitable
    name for it, but when I dug up the patch of manure there was no sign of any such
    being.

    The mandrake itself features in another homunculus "recipe". The root has to be
    picked before dawn on a Friday morning by a black dog, then washed and fed with
    milk, honey and blood. I was going to try this approach too, but I was unable
    to find a suitable dog.


    A particularly thrilling method of creating a homunculus was given by Dr David
    Christianus of Giessen in the eighteenth century. He suggested taking an egg laid
    by a black hen, poking a tiny hole through the shell, replacing a bean-sized portion
    of the white with human sperm, sealing the opening with virgin parchment, and
    burying the egg in dung on the first day of the March lunar cycle. Do this, he
    confidently announced, and after thirty days a miniature humanoid would emerge,
    which would help and protect its creator in return for a steady diet of lavender
    seeds and earthworms. I am going to have a bash at this method next March and
    will let readers know how I get on.'
