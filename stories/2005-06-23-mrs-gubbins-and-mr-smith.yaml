  text: "Almost three decades on since the self-styled \u201CNorthern white crap that\
    \ talks back\u201D started making an unholy racket, Mrs Gubbins has belatedly\
    \ discovered The Fall.\n\u201CI'm sure that underneath that scowling, grumpy exterior,\
    \ Mark E Smith is a sweet little poppet,\u201D she says, adding, \u201CHe's like\
    \ a frolicsome puppy. I'd be proud to have him as my son.\u201D\nSo taken is Mrs\
    \ Gubbins with the ludicrously prolific Mancunian misanthrope that she has somehow\
    \ managed to get hold of every record The Fall has ever made, and is holed up\
    \ in the martello tower over by Loopy Copse. Passers-by report that she is playing\
    \ the discs in chronological order, over and over again, all day and all night\
    \ without pause. All attempts to get her to desist, or at least to turn the volume\
    \ down on her supersonic booster sound system, are ignored. Stories are circulating\
    \ that birds have been dropping out of the sky, deafened and dead, in the vicinity\
    \ of the copse. The police seem helpless, possibly because they are very frightened\
    \ of Mrs Gubbins after what happened at last year's Picnic For Detectives.\nThe\
    \ octogenarian crone telephoned us yesterday. Although it was difficult to hear\
    \ her, given that Hex Enduction Hour was blasting away in the background, she\
    \ told us: \u201CI have decided to issue a series of compact discs featuring the\
    \ complete works of The Fall arranged for harp and flute. Doing them as instrumentals\
    \ will of course mean jettisoning Mr Smith's lovely words, but I want to bring\
    \ out the innate tweeness of the music.\u201D\n\nSmith : loveable poppet"
