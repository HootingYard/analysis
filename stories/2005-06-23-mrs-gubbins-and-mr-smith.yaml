  text: 'Almost three decades on since the self-styled "Northern white crap that talks
    back" started making an unholy racket, Mrs Gubbins has belatedly discovered The
    Fall.

    "I''m sure that underneath that scowling, grumpy exterior, Mark E Smith is a sweet
    little poppet," she says, adding, "He''s like a frolicsome puppy. I''d be proud
    to have him as my son."

    So taken is Mrs Gubbins with the ludicrously prolific Mancunian misanthrope that
    she has somehow managed to get hold of every record The Fall has ever made, and
    is holed up in the martello tower over by Loopy Copse. Passers-by report that
    she is playing the discs in chronological order, over and over again, all day
    and all night without pause. All attempts to get her to desist, or at least to
    turn the volume down on her supersonic booster sound system, are ignored. Stories
    are circulating that birds have been dropping out of the sky, deafened and dead,
    in the vicinity of the copse. The police seem helpless, possibly because they
    are very frightened of Mrs Gubbins after what happened at last year''s Picnic
    For Detectives.

    The octogenarian crone telephoned us yesterday. Although it was difficult to hear
    her, given that Hex Enduction Hour was blasting away in the background, she told
    us: "I have decided to issue a series of compact discs featuring the complete
    works of The Fall arranged for harp and flute. Doing them as instrumentals will
    of course mean jettisoning Mr Smith''s lovely words, but I want to bring out the
    innate tweeness of the music."


    Smith : loveable poppet'
