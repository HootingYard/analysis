  text: '"There lay exposed a strange little brown image, a root of the potato species
    distorted into human shape, with grotesquely human features, nose, lips, the indication
    of eyes, and hairy filaments falling from the sides of the head and forming a
    kind of beard upon the shrivelled jaw and chin. The creature appeared a distinct
    miniature effigy of a man. The shape of the limbs was clearly traceable, and two
    little brown tentacles of arms with rudimentary hands lay, one by the side and
    the other half over the breast. Bits of the earth from which it had been torn
    still clung in the indentations of the shape, and on the top of the head, mingling
    with the tufts of hair, were the shrivelled remains of a stalk which had been
    removed or had mouldered away. Marillier examined the thing with intense curiosity,
    at the same time revolted by its quasi-human appearance." -- Mrs Campbell Praed,
    The Insane Root'
