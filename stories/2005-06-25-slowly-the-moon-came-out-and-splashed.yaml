  text: '"Slowly the moon came out and splashed its evil coldness over the desert,
    and slowly Halloran twisted his body around and stared with burning, widened eyes
    at them... They were walking towards him with maddening deliberation, the most
    evil, the most unholy-looking, hideously repulsive group he had ever seen. The
    two might have been cowboys, except for their faces. They were dressed in regular
    range gear; ropes, belted guns, loudly checked shirts and handkerchiefs, stitched
    boots, faded blue jeans--their heavy, batwing chaps flapping in the night like
    wings of grisly birds of evil. But the faces under the tall sombreros! ... they
    were the faces of ghoulish beasts with snapping black eyes, huge canine nostrils,
    coarsely matted hair. Halloran stared and his tongue was hot and thick when he
    tried to move it. The word werewolves seemed to tumble over and over in his numbed
    mind." -- Eric Lennox, Lair Of The Damned'
