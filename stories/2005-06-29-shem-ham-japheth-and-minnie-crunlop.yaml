  text: "Those two great modernists, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, were exact contemporaries,\
    \ both born in 1882 and dying in 1941. Their reputations have survived, indeed\
    \ prospered, in the twenty-first century. The same cannot be said of a third writer\
    \ who shares those dates of birth and death, the now forgotten Minnie Crunlop.\
    \ But was Minnie more modern than Jim and Ginny? Some critics think so. Here is\
    \ Tadeusz Glob: \u201CCrunlop was a monomaniac who stuck to a preposterously limited\
    \ subject matter, but I am convinced that her name will ring down the ages, outlasting\
    \ Homer, Beowulf and the Bible.\u201D Praise indeed, from the man who dismissed\
    \ as \u201Cclots and nincompoops\u201D nearly every writer of note from the seventeenth\
    \ century onwards.\nGlob is certainly correct to refer to Crunlop's \u201Cpreposterously\
    \ limited\u201D range. In fact, all she ever wrote were stories featuring the\
    \ sons of Noah. It is true that she placed Shem, Ham and Japheth in an astonishing\
    \ variety of settings, but no other characters feature in her work, except for\
    \ occasional appearances by a fictionalised version of Suez Canal visionary Ferdinand\
    \ De Lesseps (1805-1894).\nIf her work is unconventional, so too her career. Minnie\
    \ Crunlop only began to write in the last decade of her life, on the fourteenth\
    \ of January 1931, to be precise. It was on the cold morning of this day that\
    \ she wrote, from beginning to end, the famous story \u201CShem, Ham And Japheth\
    \ Join A Knitting Circle\u201D which appeared in the inaugural issue of Messbang's\
    \ Popular Magazine Of Catastrophic Flood Fiction.\nCrunlop had met the self-styled\
    \ delugeist Orthek Messbang a few months previously. They had a passionate yet\
    \ enigmatically unconsummated affair. Among the sweet nothings he whispered into\
    \ her ear was his plan to publish two periodicals devoted to his pet topic, one\
    \ containing fiction and the other fact. After a stroll among the bougainvilleas\
    \ and fountains, Crunlop promised to pen a story based vaguely on Noah's Ark.\
    \ On her way home, she bought a Bible. She had never read it before. Locating\
    \ the text she needed in Genesis, she tore it out and threw the handsome volume\
    \ into a waste chute. Over the next week, she memorised the story of the Flood,\
    \ and thus began her singular literary career.\n\nMessbang's magazines folded\
    \ after just one issue each. He swept into Minnie Crunlop's parlour to announce\
    \ their failure, only to find her scribbling away at her second tale, \u201CShem\
    \ And De Lesseps Go Pig Hunting\u201D.\nMessbang : Darling! I am ruined! My periodicals\
    \ are no more! Cease writing!\nCrunlop : O dearest one! I could not stop even\
    \ if I wanted to, for I feel the Muse inspiring me! I am going to spend the rest\
    \ of my life writing strange little stories about Noah's three sons! It is my\
    \ destiny!\nMessbang : Love of my life, have you taken leave of your senses? Only\
    \ I would publish your deranged jottings, and now I am undone!\nThese were Orthek\
    \ Messbang's last words. He flung himself from Minnie Crunlop's window on the\
    \ fifth floor of her shabby apartment building and was impaled on an iron spike\
    \ in the street below. So consumed was Crunlop with the vivacity of her tale-telling\
    \ that she did not hear the ungodly siren of the ambulance which carted her lover\
    \ to the morgue. She remained at her escritoire, pencilling in a frenzy, until\
    \ her second story was finished, when night was drawing in.\nMessbang had abandoned\
    \ a wife, now his widow, in Dusseldorf or a similar city, who took some solace\
    \ in the fact that his final words were prophetic, for it seemed that no one was\
    \ interested in publishing Minnie Crunlop's second story. Nor the third, nor the\
    \ fourth. She had hit her stride now, and spent every Thursday writing, from dawn\
    \ till dusk, conjuring new adventures for her heroes. She had plucked the three\
    \ sons of Noah from that overcrowded ark, and was pitching them into new and dazzling\
    \ adventures. \u201CShem And Ham Visit The Glue Factory\u201D, \u201CJapheth Is\
    \ Buried Alive\u201D and \u201CDe Lesseps And Ham And The Mysterious Bag Of Soil\u201D\
    \ were all written before the end of the year. Crunlop occasionally tried hawking\
    \ them to publishers, without success, but every door slammed in her face seemed\
    \ to inspire her to new heights of invention. She continued to eke a living by\
    \ boiling and darning flags, as she had done since her release from prison just\
    \ before the Great War.\n\nCritics today are understandably coy about Minnie Crunlop's\
    \ life before she became a writer. The received wisdom is that her criminal past\
    \ has nothing to tell us about her work, that we can separate the murderous psychopath\
    \ from the story-teller, as if they were two distinct Crunlops. Indeed, it is\
    \ difficult to square the gore-drenched cut-throat skulking in the alleyways of\
    \ Dubrovnik, or somewhere like Dubrovnik, with the pencil-wielding genius of the\
    \ shabby apartment building. We must, I think, be grateful that King Vincenzo\
    \ announced an amnesty just before the war. Cynics say the King expected all those\
    \ he released to perish on the battlefields, and most of them did, but Minnie\
    \ Crunlop survived, for she spent the war years hiding in a hayloft near an orchard,\
    \ creeping out at night to eat her fill of pears and gooseberries and drinking\
    \ from a spigot by the side of a barn.\nWas this hayloft Crunlop's ark? She shared\
    \ it with a pair of geese and a pair of stoats, or at least that is what she said\
    \ later. But then she claimed to have named the geese Shem and Japheth and the\
    \ stoats De Lesseps and Ham, and this is unlikely, given that she was, as we have\
    \ seen, Bible-ignorant at this point. In her last illness, when her brain was\
    \ a fuming hallucinatory miasma, she told all sorts of stories about her time\
    \ in the hayloft, indeed she spoke of little else. Incoherent babble it may have\
    \ been, but clearly this period\u2014after the killings and before the stories\u2014\
    was of great significance for her. Over the years there have been attempts to\
    \ convert the wartime sanctuary into a Minnie Crunlop Museum or Memorial Library,\
    \ but no one has ever been able to identify the actual site, given that there\
    \ are literally dozens of haylofts in barns near orchards in the country.\nCuriously,\
    \ her writings give no clues. Throughout the canon, there is no mention of any\
    \ kind of agricultural building. The reader will find plenty of gaudy palaces,\
    \ space stations, skyscrapers, futuristic pods, Transylvanian castles, urban dystopias\
    \ and Victorian drawing-rooms in Crunlop's fiction, but no barns in farmyards.\
    \ Nor will one find an ark, of course. The only story that nods in a seafaring\
    \ direction is the elegiac \u201CA Rowing Boat And Its Oars\u201D (1936), the\
    \ first of Crunlop's works to win a prize. She had, at long last, found a publisher,\
    \ in the form of Doctor Gillespie's Pedantic Register & Gazette.\n\u201CDoctor\
    \ Gillespie\u201D was a fictional character who purported to edit\u2014and write\
    \ most of\u2014this weekly periodical, which was heavily illustrated with mezzotints\
    \ by the mezzotintist Rex Tint. It was Tint who recommended Crunlop to the genuine,\
    \ non-fictional editor, a secretive plutocrat with a piratical eye-patch who was\
    \ to become her sole publisher.\n\nIn the remaining four years of her active career,\
    \ the tales poured out, some of them only fifty words long, some close to novellas.\
    \ It was an age of anxiety, as Europe edged once again towards war. Minnie Crunlop\
    \ took to sporting an eye-patch in homage to her mentor. She went to visit De\
    \ Lesseps' Suez Canal, where she wrote the ground-breaking \u201CHam's Rakish\
    \ Sneer\u201D. She penned anonymous fan letters to Hollywood actor Claude Rains.\
    \ Her shabby apartment building was given a new lick of paint, or paints, all\
    \ mauve and yellow and a startling cerulean blue. She pondered writing a new type\
    \ of story, one that would feature Neville Chamberlain, but abandoned it after\
    \ a long and earnest discussion with Rex Tint in the dining room of a majestic\
    \ hotel, where the pair of them ate soup, crackers and potted paste, before running\
    \ away without paying the bill. She exchanged her collection of pencils for a\
    \ pen with an unbreakable nib, and promptly broke the nib. She was praised in\
    \ an essay by Kapisko, and Larch painted her portrait, and King Vincenzo's son,\
    \ the new King, also called Vincenzo, presented her with a medal. She wrote a\
    \ marvellous, tragic, tear-stained tale called \u201CJapheth Is Buried Alive,\
    \ Again\u201D. Her hair turned white.\nAnd then, on the fourteenth of January\
    \ 1941, ten years to the day since her writing career began, she was engulfed\
    \ by a daze, a daze that could have been mistaken for a coma were it not that\
    \ within her daze she babbled incessantly, about the hayloft and her geese and\
    \ her stoats, and little else, and she never again picked up her broken pen, nor\
    \ any of the pencils she had retrieved from a rubbish tip, and she babbled away\
    \ in her daze for forty days and forty nights, ark time, and then she passed away,\
    \ and now she is all but forgotten, so you must mark her name, and mark it well.\
    \ Minnie Crunlop!"
