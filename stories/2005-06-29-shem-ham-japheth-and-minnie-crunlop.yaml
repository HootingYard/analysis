  text: 'Those two great modernists, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, were exact contemporaries,
    both born in 1882 and dying in 1941. Their reputations have survived, indeed prospered,
    in the twenty-first century. The same cannot be said of a third writer who shares
    those dates of birth and death, the now forgotten Minnie Crunlop. But was Minnie
    more modern than Jim and Ginny? Some critics think so. Here is Tadeusz Glob: "Crunlop
    was a monomaniac who stuck to a preposterously limited subject matter, but I am
    convinced that her name will ring down the ages, outlasting Homer, Beowulf and
    the Bible." Praise indeed, from the man who dismissed as "clots and nincompoops"
    nearly every writer of note from the seventeenth century onwards.

    Glob is certainly correct to refer to Crunlop''s "preposterously limited" range.
    In fact, all she ever wrote were stories featuring the sons of Noah. It is true
    that she placed Shem, Ham and Japheth in an astonishing variety of settings, but
    no other characters feature in her work, except for occasional appearances by
    a fictionalised version of Suez Canal visionary Ferdinand De Lesseps (1805-1894).

    If her work is unconventional, so too her career. Minnie Crunlop only began to
    write in the last decade of her life, on the fourteenth of January 1931, to be
    precise. It was on the cold morning of this day that she wrote, from beginning
    to end, the famous story "Shem, Ham And Japheth Join A Knitting Circle" which
    appeared in the inaugural issue of Messbang''s Popular Magazine Of Catastrophic
    Flood Fiction.

    Crunlop had met the self-styled delugeist Orthek Messbang a few months previously.
    They had a passionate yet enigmatically unconsummated affair. Among the sweet
    nothings he whispered into her ear was his plan to publish two periodicals devoted
    to his pet topic, one containing fiction and the other fact. After a stroll among
    the bougainvilleas and fountains, Crunlop promised to pen a story based vaguely
    on Noah''s Ark. On her way home, she bought a Bible. She had never read it before.
    Locating the text she needed in Genesis, she tore it out and threw the handsome
    volume into a waste chute. Over the next week, she memorised the story of the
    Flood, and thus began her singular literary career.


    Messbang''s magazines folded after just one issue each. He swept into Minnie Crunlop''s
    parlour to announce their failure, only to find her scribbling away at her second
    tale, "Shem And De Lesseps Go Pig Hunting".

    Messbang : Darling! I am ruined! My periodicals are no more! Cease writing!

    Crunlop : O dearest one! I could not stop even if I wanted to, for I feel the
    Muse inspiring me! I am going to spend the rest of my life writing strange little
    stories about Noah''s three sons! It is my destiny!

    Messbang : Love of my life, have you taken leave of your senses? Only I would
    publish your deranged jottings, and now I am undone!

    These were Orthek Messbang''s last words. He flung himself from Minnie Crunlop''s
    window on the fifth floor of her shabby apartment building and was impaled on
    an iron spike in the street below. So consumed was Crunlop with the vivacity of
    her tale-telling that she did not hear the ungodly siren of the ambulance which
    carted her lover to the morgue. She remained at her escritoire, pencilling in
    a frenzy, until her second story was finished, when night was drawing in.

    Messbang had abandoned a wife, now his widow, in Dusseldorf or a similar city,
    who took some solace in the fact that his final words were prophetic, for it seemed
    that no one was interested in publishing Minnie Crunlop''s second story. Nor the
    third, nor the fourth. She had hit her stride now, and spent every Thursday writing,
    from dawn till dusk, conjuring new adventures for her heroes. She had plucked
    the three sons of Noah from that overcrowded ark, and was pitching them into new
    and dazzling adventures. "Shem And Ham Visit The Glue Factory", "Japheth Is Buried
    Alive" and "De Lesseps And Ham And The Mysterious Bag Of Soil" were all written
    before the end of the year. Crunlop occasionally tried hawking them to publishers,
    without success, but every door slammed in her face seemed to inspire her to new
    heights of invention. She continued to eke a living by boiling and darning flags,
    as she had done since her release from prison just before the Great War.


    Critics today are understandably coy about Minnie Crunlop''s life before she became
    a writer. The received wisdom is that her criminal past has nothing to tell us
    about her work, that we can separate the murderous psychopath from the story-teller,
    as if they were two distinct Crunlops. Indeed, it is difficult to square the gore-drenched
    cut-throat skulking in the alleyways of Dubrovnik, or somewhere like Dubrovnik,
    with the pencil-wielding genius of the shabby apartment building. We must, I think,
    be grateful that King Vincenzo announced an amnesty just before the war. Cynics
    say the King expected all those he released to perish on the battlefields, and
    most of them did, but Minnie Crunlop survived, for she spent the war years hiding
    in a hayloft near an orchard, creeping out at night to eat her fill of pears and
    gooseberries and drinking from a spigot by the side of a barn.

    Was this hayloft Crunlop''s ark? She shared it with a pair of geese and a pair
    of stoats, or at least that is what she said later. But then she claimed to have
    named the geese Shem and Japheth and the stoats De Lesseps and Ham, and this is
    unlikely, given that she was, as we have seen, Bible-ignorant at this point. In
    her last illness, when her brain was a fuming hallucinatory miasma, she told all
    sorts of stories about her time in the hayloft, indeed she spoke of little else.
    Incoherent babble it may have been, but clearly this period--after the killings
    and before the stories--was of great significance for her. Over the years there
    have been attempts to convert the wartime sanctuary into a Minnie Crunlop Museum
    or Memorial Library, but no one has ever been able to identify the actual site,
    given that there are literally dozens of haylofts in barns near orchards in the
    country.

    Curiously, her writings give no clues. Throughout the canon, there is no mention
    of any kind of agricultural building. The reader will find plenty of gaudy palaces,
    space stations, skyscrapers, futuristic pods, Transylvanian castles, urban dystopias
    and Victorian drawing-rooms in Crunlop''s fiction, but no barns in farmyards.
    Nor will one find an ark, of course. The only story that nods in a seafaring direction
    is the elegiac "A Rowing Boat And Its Oars" (1936), the first of Crunlop''s works
    to win a prize. She had, at long last, found a publisher, in the form of Doctor
    Gillespie''s Pedantic Register & Gazette.

    "Doctor Gillespie" was a fictional character who purported to edit--and write
    most of--this weekly periodical, which was heavily illustrated with mezzotints
    by the mezzotintist Rex Tint. It was Tint who recommended Crunlop to the genuine,
    non-fictional editor, a secretive plutocrat with a piratical eye-patch who was
    to become her sole publisher.


    In the remaining four years of her active career, the tales poured out, some of
    them only fifty words long, some close to novellas. It was an age of anxiety,
    as Europe edged once again towards war. Minnie Crunlop took to sporting an eye-patch
    in homage to her mentor. She went to visit De Lesseps'' Suez Canal, where she
    wrote the ground-breaking "Ham''s Rakish Sneer". She penned anonymous fan letters
    to Hollywood actor Claude Rains. Her shabby apartment building was given a new
    lick of paint, or paints, all mauve and yellow and a startling cerulean blue.
    She pondered writing a new type of story, one that would feature Neville Chamberlain,
    but abandoned it after a long and earnest discussion with Rex Tint in the dining
    room of a majestic hotel, where the pair of them ate soup, crackers and potted
    paste, before running away without paying the bill. She exchanged her collection
    of pencils for a pen with an unbreakable nib, and promptly broke the nib. She
    was praised in an essay by Kapisko, and Larch painted her portrait, and King Vincenzo''s
    son, the new King, also called Vincenzo, presented her with a medal. She wrote
    a marvellous, tragic, tear-stained tale called "Japheth Is Buried Alive, Again".
    Her hair turned white.

    And then, on the fourteenth of January 1941, ten years to the day since her writing
    career began, she was engulfed by a daze, a daze that could have been mistaken
    for a coma were it not that within her daze she babbled incessantly, about the
    hayloft and her geese and her stoats, and little else, and she never again picked
    up her broken pen, nor any of the pencils she had retrieved from a rubbish tip,
    and she babbled away in her daze for forty days and forty nights, ark time, and
    then she passed away, and now she is all but forgotten, so you must mark her name,
    and mark it well. Minnie Crunlop!'
