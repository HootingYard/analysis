  text: "\u201CThe inclusion of the husk or shell in some of the cheaper forms of\
    \ chocolate is another reprehensible practice (strongly condemned), as they do\
    \ not possess the qualities for which the kernel or nib is so highly prized. To\
    \ prevent this practice it was enacted in 1770 that the shells or husks should\
    \ be seized or destroyed, and the officer seizing them rewarded up to 20s. per\
    \ hundredweight. From these a light, but not unpalatable, table decoction is still\
    \ prepared in Ireland and elsewhere, under the designation of \u2018miserables\u2019\
