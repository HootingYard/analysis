  text: '"The inclusion of the husk or shell in some of the cheaper forms of chocolate
    is another reprehensible practice (strongly condemned), as they do not possess
    the qualities for which the kernel or nib is so highly prized. To prevent this
    practice it was enacted in 1770 that the shells or husks should be seized or destroyed,
    and the officer seizing them rewarded up to 20s. per hundredweight. From these
    a light, but not unpalatable, table decoction is still prepared in Ireland and
    elsewhere, under the designation of ''miserables''." -- Brandon Head, The Food
    Of The Gods : A Popular Account Of Cocoa'
