  text: '"Athwart that dream came a sudden, frightful, heart-stilling roar of destruction;
    a hideous crash followed, a terrible rending, breaking, smashing, concatenation
    of noises, succeeded by frightful detonations... the ship was reduced in a few
    moments to a disjointed, disorganized, sinking mass of shapeless, formless, splintered
    steel." -- Cyrus Townsend Brady, And Thus He Came'
