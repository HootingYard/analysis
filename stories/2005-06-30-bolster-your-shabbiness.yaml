  text: 'If you are a shabby person, you may from time to time experience the beckoning
    hand of unshabbiness. You may be tempted to comb your hair, or to darn those holes
    in your jumper, even to eradicate the egg and jam stains on your necktie. It may
    be that not only is your appearance shabby, but so too your conduct. Perhaps you
    have betrayed your friend, or stolen a bus pass from a tottering widow, or pushed
    a dog in front of an oncoming railway engine. Siren voices may whisper in your
    ear, as you lie sprawled in a sun-dappled meadow, urging you to repent. What those
    voices want is for you to embrace unshabbiness.

    Now you can spurn the beckoning hand and the siren voices with ease, in exchange
    for a small monthly fee. Bolster Your Shabbiness is a new part-work from Hooting
    Yard''s Inhuman Resources Service. Every month, our team of craven wretches provides
    the shabby with information, top tips, and inspiration. We have also commissioned
    a series of illustrations, made with a blunt and greasy pencil on sheets of disgusting
    wrapping paper salvaged from a hole in the ground.

    For further details, watch this space--or rather, peer at it through your eerily
    pale and watery eyes.'
