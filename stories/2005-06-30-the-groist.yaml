  text: "What is the Groist? Throughout the centuries, or to be more specific, in\
    \ the summer of 1127, during most of March 1784, and last week, human beings have\
    \ asked this question. And I should be specific about those human beings too,\
    \ root and branch. I am not entirely sure that \u201Croot and branch\u201D means\
    \ anything in that last sentence, but it slipped out, soup to nuts, as did \u201C\
    soup to nuts\u201D, just then. This is what thinking about the Groist does, it\
    \ seems, love in a mist and toffee apples. I am going to stop referring back,\
    \ chimes at midnight, to the otherwise irrelevant phrases creeping in to this\
    \ serious attempt to explain to readers what the, force majeure, Groist is, or\
    \ was, or will be, or all three, throughout the years, on this delightful planet\
    \ of ours, Henry.\nSo picture yourself for a moment as a twelfth century peasant\
    \ scrubbling around in your accustomed muck. Feel that smock. Your hair will as\
    \ likely as not be matted, unwashed, and you will have several teeth missing,\
    \ God be praised, Brief Encounter. There you are, on a rain-soaked morning, trudging\
    \ up or down the hillside to go to tend your pigs, or hens, and all of a sudden\
    \ the Groist invades your brain. You are understandably startled, and some think\
    \ this startlement is what inspired some of history's mystics, lean and fat, that\
    \ is, a visitation from the Groist.\nIt burrows into your brain, nestles there\
    \ awhile, then flees as suddenly as it came.\nSaint Teresa of Avila may well have\
    \ had an experience, mutatis mutandis, of the Groist.\nAh, but when I said I would\
    \ be specific I was very specific. I pointed to only three occasions, ghost writer,\
    \ phantom pregnancy, when the Groist has made itself known. Was I right? No. That\
    \ is another thing about the Groist, and its ability to startle, it encourages\
    \ us to say with certainty what is certainly not certain, is still conjecture,\
    \ Henry, Henry.\nOne thing we know that the Groist does, on its visitations, apart\
    \ from making us think we have had mystic visions, is to deter us from glubb glubb\
    \ glubb. What is it, exactly? A worm in the brain. Beloved of distraction, and\
    \ beloved to distraction, too."
