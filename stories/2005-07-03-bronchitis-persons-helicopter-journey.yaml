  text: '"Hand me that gewgaw," said the Mullah.

    The Mufti snatched the gewgaw from the Ayatollah and handed it to the Mullah.

    "Are you going to take the gewgaw to the Grand Vizier?" asked the Mufti.

    "That I am," said the Mullah, turning on the heel of his floppy bootee, and exiting
    through a rich brocade curtain.

    The Ayatollah stroked his tremendous hairy beard and looked at the Mufti.

    "Do you have your portable metal tapping machine on you?" he asked, and on seeing
    the Mufti nod, he added, "I want you to contact the Muezzin."

    "The Muezzin?" cried the Mufti, dumbfounded.

    "The same," said the Ayatollah.

    Leaving the Mufti to tap a message to the Muezzin, the Ayatollah went out into
    the courtyard. Almost hidden behind the luxuriant mimosa, japonica, candytuft,
    madder, lupins and oxlip, a whirring robot version of Big Bill Broonzy was playing
    the blues. The Ayatollah was tolerant of music, so long as it was mournful. He
    sat down on a mat and ran his fingers through his hairy beard again.

    Meanwhile, at the Grand Vizier''s palace, the Grand Vizier was impatiently awaiting
    the Mullah with the gewgaw. Last week he had volunteered to undergo ideological
    re-education. All the talk in the palace now was of the correct application of
    Mao Tse-Tung thought. The Grand Vizier wanted the Mullah''s gewgaw to add to his
    collection of baubles, the significance of which was only now beginning to dawn
    on him. He popped a filbert into his mouth and continued pacing up and down on
    his big and attractive carpet, his impatience growing.

    Just as the Ayatollah was stroking his superb hairy beard for the umpteenth time,
    the Mufti joined him in the courtyard. The Mufti had an abnormal growth on his
    forehead.

    "Strikingly disconcerting news," he announced, "The Muezzin has bronchitis."

    The Ayatollah let go of his beard.

    "Disconcerting indeed," he said, "Go and switch off the Broonzy robot. I need
    a bit of peace and quiet to think."

    In January, the remote control device for the robot had been left out in the rain,
    and no one had been able to repair it, so the Mufti had to fight his way through
    lilac, phlox, cotoneaster, hollyhocks and erica to reach the knob on the side
    of the machine to switch it off. Now the only sound in the courtyard was the insistent
    call of a corncrake far far away.

    Suddenly the Ayatollah ceased cogitating and spoke.

    "Mufti," he said, "There is a helicopter idling on the helipad. Go to it, fetch
    the Muezzin, then fly him to the Grand Vizier''s palace. That is my clearly considered
    plan of how we should proceed."

    And so the scene was set for that historic meeting in the palace, when the Grand
    Vizier, the Mullah, the bronchial Muezzin and the Mufti sat on divans in the room
    of baubles, their attentions fixed upon the gewgaw. Rex Tint''s mezzotint of the
    occasion, a work of the imagination, for of course he was not present, is one
    of his greatest mezzotints. It took him four years to complete it, and when it
    was done, he gave it as a gift to the Ayatollah, who framed it and hung it on
    the wall of the courtyard, where it was soon obscured by burgeoning fleabane,
    veronica, eglantine, hibiscus, poppies and daisies and lady''s slipper and old
    man''s beard, by saxifrage and narcissus, by orchids, by briars, by creeping jenny
    and viola, and it hangs there still, though the Ayatollah is long dead, and the
    faraway corncrake is no more.'
