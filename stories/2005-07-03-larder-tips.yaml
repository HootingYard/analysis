  text: "Welcome to this month's Hooting Yard Larder Tips. If you have a larder, we\
    \ strongly recommend that you stack the shelves with lots of jars containing different\
    \ types of sauce. It is a good idea to glue a label to each jar, bearing the name\
    \ of the sauce it contains. A bold, clear typeface should be used for the label,\
    \ not some hasty scrawl made with the last remnant of a crayon. In the unlikely\
    \ event that you do not drool with glee at the prospect of eating all those sauces,\
    \ you can instead pack your larder with pots of paste, but follow the same labelling\
    \ advice. Pots may need smaller labels than jars, so bear that in mind.\nMake\
    \ sure your larder is airy. If the door shuts very very tight, and by some chance\
    \ all the air is sucked out of the larder, you will find that you are unable to\
    \ gain access to your jars of sauce, or pots of paste, because the larder will\
    \ have become a vacuum, which nature abhors. Readers in the United States who\
    \ face this quandary may find it useful to contact Dave Aspnes (pictured below)\
    \ who is the current president of the American Vacuum Society. As Dave says, \u201C\
    the historic roots of [the Society] are in the creation and measurement of vacuum\u201D\
    , so he should be able to help if your larder becomes one.\n"
