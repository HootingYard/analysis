  text: 'Welcome to this month''s Hooting Yard Larder Tips. If you have a larder,
    we strongly recommend that you stack the shelves with lots of jars containing
    different types of sauce. It is a good idea to glue a label to each jar, bearing
    the name of the sauce it contains. A bold, clear typeface should be used for the
    label, not some hasty scrawl made with the last remnant of a crayon. In the unlikely
    event that you do not drool with glee at the prospect of eating all those sauces,
    you can instead pack your larder with pots of paste, but follow the same labelling
    advice. Pots may need smaller labels than jars, so bear that in mind.

    Make sure your larder is airy. If the door shuts very very tight, and by some
    chance all the air is sucked out of the larder, you will find that you are unable
    to gain access to your jars of sauce, or pots of paste, because the larder will
    have become a vacuum, which nature abhors. Readers in the United States who face
    this quandary may find it useful to contact Dave Aspnes (pictured below) who is
    the current president of the American Vacuum Society. As Dave says, "the historic
    roots of [the Society] are in the creation and measurement of vacuum", so he should
    be able to help if your larder becomes one.
