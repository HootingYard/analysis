  text: Consider the perplexity of a fop in a quandary. Consider the quandary the
    fop finds himself in. A bird has built its nest in the fop's tremendous hairstyle.
    A small bird, of course, a hummingbird or a wren. It has laced the fop's hair
    with twigs, hay, moss and bits of duff from the forest floor. Were the fop a hater
    of birds he would not be in a quandary. He would simply tear the nest from his
    tresses and punch his fist at the hummingbird or wren so that it flew away. But
    the fop of whom I write was no hater of birds. His love of our winged chums was
    so great that he was known to some as The Bird-Adoring Fop. Perhaps the hummingbird
    or wren had, with some avian sixth sense, apprehended this bird-love and chosen
    the site of its nest accordingly. Or it may have been simply the luxury of the
    fop's locks, espied from high up in the sky as he reclined languidly on a chaise
    in a salon, fluttering a perfumed kerchief and sipping some delightful infusion
    from a bone china cup. Birds cannot speak in human language, so we shall never
    know. Nor do we know what terrible series of events found the fop, ten days later,
    facing a firing squad.
