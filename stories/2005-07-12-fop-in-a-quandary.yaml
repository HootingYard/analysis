  text: "Consider the perplexity of a fop in a quandary. Consider the quandary the\
    \ fop finds himself in. A bird has built its nest in the fop's tremendous hairstyle.\
    \ A small bird, of course, a hummingbird or a wren. It has laced the fop's hair\
    \ with twigs, hay, moss and bits of duff from the forest floor. Were the fop a\
    \ hater of birds he would not be in a quandary. He would simply tear the nest\
    \ from his tresses and punch his fist at the hummingbird or wren so that it flew\
    \ away. But the fop of whom I write was no hater of birds. His love of our wing\xE9\
    d chums was so great that he was known to some as The Bird-Adoring Fop. Perhaps\
    \ the hummingbird or wren had, with some avian sixth sense, apprehended this bird-love\
    \ and chosen the site of its nest accordingly. Or it may have been simply the\
    \ luxury of the fop's locks, espied from high up in the sky as he reclined languidly\
    \ on a chaise in a salon, fluttering a perfumed kerchief and sipping some delightful\
    \ infusion from a bone china cup. Birds cannot speak in human language, so we\
    \ shall never know. Nor do we know what terrible series of events found the fop,\
    \ ten days later, facing a firing squad."
