  text: 'Dobson once worked, very briefly, as a park-keeper. On the morning of the
    first Thursday of his second week in the job, he had an accident while creosoting
    some railings, and was temporarily deafened. Finding Dobson twitching and shattered
    at the edge of a bed of peonies, the Captain of the Creosoters alerted the Park
    Railings Person, who in turn reported the accident to the Top Cadet of the Park
    Perimeter Patrol, who told the Acting Duty Monitor, who sent a metal tapping machine
    message to the secretary of the Park Surveillance Gang, who passed it to the Railings
    Subcommittee Recorder, who told me. I sent a squad of paramedics to tip Dobson
    into a Mobile Accident Response Pod which was propelled at unimaginable speed
    to one of the underground Park Personnel Recuperation Units. When, later that
    afternoon, Dobson stormed into my office shouting that he was temporarily deaf,
    I saw my chance to introduce him to the so-called Pompous Lip-Reader.

    The Pompous Lip-Reader had been hanging around outside my office for weeks on
    end with nothing to do, for not a single one of the Park Persons had any kind
    of hearing problem. I was growing increasingly irritable with the presence of
    this tall, swaggering, unkempt, smug, and indeed pompous lip-reader, who was making
    unwarranted inroads into my supply of teabags, so much so that I had taken the
    precaution of padlocking the Park Pantry. The Pompous Lip-Reader promptly smashed
    the padlock and left it in fragments on my desk. He was goading me, I knew that
    much. I tried, one evening when everyone had gone home, to disable the kettle,
    but I am not of a technical bent, and I succeeded only in electrocuting myself.
    It is lucky that I am not a whooper swan, or I would have been eaten by Peter
    Maxwell Davies*. As it was, I discovered that I have a superhuman ability to withstand
    electric shocks, though unfortunately this is not accompanied by any other special
    powers, nor, in truth, by any burning ambition to right wrongs and to overpower
    criminals. As far as I was concerned the only person who needed overpowering was
    the Pompous Lip-Reader. I had been told I could not dismiss him, for apparently
    both his pomposity and his lip-reading skills gave him the Sanctuary of the Parks.
    I had not come upon this phrase before, but the Brevet Colonel of Park Practices
    pointed it out to me in the handbook.

    On this Thursday afternoon, then, as Dobson stood berating me, holding his puny
    fists--still caked with creosote--against his temporarily useless ears, I saw
    my chance. Depressing the knob on my plastic buzzing console, I summoned the Pompous
    Lip-Reader. When he wafted in, tall, swaggering, unkempt, smug and pompous, a
    cup of tea balanced on the damned saucer he held so delicately, I announced: "I
    am assigning you to this man here," -- and I pointed at Dobson, although there
    was no one else in the room save the three of us--"He is a member of the Southwest
    Sector Creosoting Fivesome, and he had an accident this morning at the Southwest
    Sector Peony Bed Railings. He is temporarily deaf, so you can follow him about
    and lip-read for him until further notice."

    Dobson''s hearing returned during the small hours of the very next morning, when
    he was woken by the sound of rats gnawing his wainscot. He saw that the Pompous
    Lip-Reader was perched at the end of his bed, tall, swaggering, unkempt, smug
    and pompous, and drinking a cup of tea. Something about the Pompous Lip-Reader
    appealed to Dobson, and despite his now being able to hear perfectly, the pair
    of them were inseparable for the next seven years, until they parted one day,
    with a handshake, in a patch of waste ground rife with thorns.
