  text: '"Their strong Holds have all the open Places cover''d with Canvass stretch''d
    from Side to Side; upon which is strew''d an Herb so venemous, that, in six Hours
    after it has been expos''d to the Sun, it emits so pestiferous a Stench, that
    no Fowl can approach it by many Yards, but what will fall dead; and this Stench,
    by the Effluvia mounting, is no way offensive to those below." -- Captain Samuel
    Brunt, A Voyage To Cacklogallinia, With A Description Of The Religion, Policy,
    Customs And Manners of That Country'
