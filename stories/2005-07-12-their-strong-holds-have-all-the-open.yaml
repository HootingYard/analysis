  text: "\u201CTheir strong Holds have all the open Places cover'd with Canvass stretch'd\
    \ from Side to Side; upon which is strew'd an Herb so venemous, that, in six Hours\
    \ after it has been expos'd to the Sun, it emits so pestiferous a Stench, that\
    \ no Fowl can approach it by many Yards, but what will fall dead; and this Stench,\
    \ by the Effluvia mounting, is no way offensive to those below.\u201D \u2014 Captain\
