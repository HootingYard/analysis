    \ Using your skill and judgement, after drinking a cup of cocoa and improvising\
    \ some caterwauling vocal exercises as if you were a small, terrified animal,\
    \ see if you are able to identify the nun.\nABCD\nSend your answers to the Spot\
    \ The Nun Competition Judging Panel, with the subject header \u201CI think I know\
    \ which one the nun is\u201D. The winning entry will be drawn from a hat, or pouch,\
    \ or bag, on a day of inclement weather."
