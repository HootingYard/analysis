  text: 'News that London is to host the 2012 Olympic Games has created something
    of a kerfuffle in the Haemoglobin Towers annexe. Mrs Gubbins is insisting that
    she wants to be captain of Team Hooting Yard and to take part in the volleyball,
    widdershins, and indoor puck-related contests, even though she will be well over
    ninety by the time of the Games. She has already designed a blazer for the team,
    with special pockets, though she has not explained what is to be kept in them,
    nor indeed why they are special. Nor has she seen fit to tell the rest of the
    staff why she wants them to rub orange peel into their scalps each morning for
    the next seven years. My guess is that she has been reading the discredited sports
    scientist Plodgat, whose teachings had such disastrous consequences for the Duggleby
    brothers in the 1924 Games.

    We have set up a shadow organising committee without telling Mrs Gubbins, laughing
    off that "I have my spies everywhere" comment she is forever muttering from her
    toothless gums. This despite the fact that we know she does have spies, seemingly
    hundreds of them. How she keeps them on her payroll is anybody''s guess, though
    perhaps the series of burglaries over at the Bodger''s Spinney Retail Park And
    Adventure Playground has something to do with it. Every now and then La Gubbins
    makes a series of strange chopping movements with her hand. I''m not sure why
    I mention that.

    Team Hooting Yard--the Gubbins one or the shadow one, or both--will of course
    be competing in every single event come 2012. We have already commandeered that
    strip of grass near the Blister Lane Bypass as a training ground, built a little
    fence, and have plenty of buckets of water on hand. You may want to memorise our
    team song, which goes like this:

    Hooting Yard, Hooting Yard / Ha-ha and gazebo / We will vanquish all our foes
    / Where have all the flowers gone? / Hooting, Hooting Yard!'
