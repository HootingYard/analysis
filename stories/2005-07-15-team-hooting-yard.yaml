  text: "News that London is to host the 2012 Olympic Games has created something\
    \ of a kerfuffle in the Haemoglobin Towers annexe. Mrs Gubbins is insisting that\
    \ she wants to be captain of Team Hooting Yard and to take part in the volleyball,\
    \ widdershins, and indoor puck-related contests, even though she will be well\
    \ over ninety by the time of the Games. She has already designed a blazer for\
    \ the team, with special pockets, though she has not explained what is to be kept\
    \ in them, nor indeed why they are special. Nor has she seen fit to tell the rest\
    \ of the staff why she wants them to rub orange peel into their scalps each morning\
    \ for the next seven years. My guess is that she has been reading the discredited\
    \ sports scientist Plodgat, whose teachings had such disastrous consequences for\
    \ the Duggleby brothers in the 1924 Games.\nWe have set up a shadow organising\
    \ committee without telling Mrs Gubbins, laughing off that \u201CI have my spies\
    \ everywhere\u201D comment she is forever muttering from her toothless gums. This\
    \ despite the fact that we know she does have spies, seemingly hundreds of them.\
    \ How she keeps them on her payroll is anybody's guess, though perhaps the series\
    \ of burglaries over at the Bodger's Spinney Retail Park And Adventure Playground\
    \ has something to do with it. Every now and then La Gubbins makes a series of\
    \ strange chopping movements with her hand. I'm not sure why I mention that.\n\
    Team Hooting Yard\u2014the Gubbins one or the shadow one, or both\u2014will of\
    \ course be competing in every single event come 2012. We have already commandeered\
    \ that strip of grass near the Blister Lane Bypass as a training ground, built\
    \ a little fence, and have plenty of buckets of water on hand. You may want to\
    \ memorise our team song, which goes like this:\nHooting Yard, Hooting Yard /\
    \ Ha-ha and gazebo / We will vanquish all our foes / Where have all the flowers\
    \ gone? / Hooting, Hooting Yard!"
