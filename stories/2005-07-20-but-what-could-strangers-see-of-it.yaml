  text: '"But what could strangers see of it? The foreshore to them is the unending
    monotony of grey streets, sometimes grim, often decayed, and always reticent and
    sullen, that might never have seen the stars nor heard of good luck; and the light
    would be, when closely looked at, merely a high gas bracket on a dank wall in
    solitude, its glass broken, and the flame within it fluttering to extinction like
    an imprisoned and crippled moth trying to evade the squeeze of giant darkness
    and the wind." -- H M Tomlinson, London River'
