  text: "\u201CBut what could strangers see of it? The foreshore to them is the unending\
    \ monotony of grey streets, sometimes grim, often decayed, and always reticent\
    \ and sullen, that might never have seen the stars nor heard of good luck; and\
    \ the light would be, when closely looked at, merely a high gas bracket on a dank\
    \ wall in solitude, its glass broken, and the flame within it fluttering to extinction\
    \ like an imprisoned and crippled moth trying to evade the squeeze of giant darkness\
    \ and the wind.\u201D \u2014 H M Tomlinson, London River"
