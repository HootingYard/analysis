  text: "\u201CEek! Eek!\u201D trilled the twins, as they turned a corner by the market\
    \ square and saw, looming above them, the big dark walls of the evil bakery. It\
    \ was a sinister, if familiar, sight. Instinctively, the twins clutched each other's\
    \ hands, as from behind the iron gates they heard what they knew was the bellowing\
    \ of the Hairy Man. They hoped they would be able to pass by without him seeing\
    \ them, but they suspected that, as ever, the Hairy Man would be peering out at\
    \ the street through his powerful binoculars, and they were right. As they tried\
    \ to flit past, wishing themselves invisible, the Hairy Man thrust one of his\
    \ massive hairy paws through the railings and beckoned them. He stopped bellowing\
    \ for a moment. The twins' legs had turned to jelly. Clouds scudded across the\
    \ sky. Across the way, a French Impressionist painter captured the scene with\
    \ swift, sure brushstrokes. The twins, the Hairy Man, even the vast gloomy bakery\
    \ itself, are all a blur, just as they are in my memory.\nIt is hard to believe\
    \ that fifty years have passed since this scene took place. I should be telling\
    \ you about tin, tin and zinc and titanium, but I am ever drawn back to the evil\
    \ bakery, and the twins and the Hairy Man with his binoculars. What did he say\
    \ to them, when, terrified, they responded to his beckoning paw as if drawn by\
    \ magnetism? Is it true that he merely gave them each a pastry and sent them on\
    \ their way? That later, as they sat outside the Owl Library, they chuckled as\
    \ the fruit filling of the pastries dribbled down their chins? What exactly did\
    \ Under-Sheriff Coggery mean when he testified, later, that the very air of the\
    \ town that day had a tang of rare Oriental spices, and of diesel fumes? I am\
    \ standing on the bridge now, and hailstones are pinging off my hat, and still\
    \ the mystery remains.\nThe Hairy Man lies buried in the churchyard, the twins\
    \ of course are entombed in some giant foreign cathedral, and the evil bakery\
    \ itself is no more. It was torn down after the events of that day, in riots,\
    \ and on the site there now stands a teenage milk bar wherein scruffy youngsters\
    \ strum guitars and sing inane songlets, oblivious of the evil spirits flying\
    \ round and round, invisible."
