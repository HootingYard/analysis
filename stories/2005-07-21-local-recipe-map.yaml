  text: "Readers may recall that one of my favourite publications is Further Science\
    \ by Norman Davies. (See Hedge Auras, 20 February 2004.) I have still not managed\
    \ to track down any other issues than Book 20, the marvellous A6 yellow-covered\
    \ spineless 76-page pamphlet from 2001 which, maddeningly, contains no indication\
    \ of its provenance. Here is Mr Davies' Local Recipe Map, reprinted exactly as\
    \ it appears in the original:\n1. Far NE Scotland\u2014marmalade / far NW\u2014\
    biscuits / far North\u2014fish.\n2. Mid SW to NE\u2014Devon / Yorks\u2014rolls\u2014\
    cheese -sausage / cheese.\n3. So that about a Midlands triangular Pie Nucleus\u2014\
    there are fingers and eggs: hot pots, to the NW\u2014marmalade / ham / loaf to\
    \ the East. With a ginger NW apex.\n4. Tarts to the South\u2014with W/E in the\
    \ far South. Dumplings and Welsh herbs / cakes / fish puddings and scones. Etc.\n\
    I think we need to arrange a Hooting Yard expedition to the Midlands triangular\
    \ Pie Nucleus!"
