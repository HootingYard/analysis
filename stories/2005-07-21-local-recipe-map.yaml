  text: 'Readers may recall that one of my favourite publications is Further Science
    by Norman Davies. (See Hedge Auras, 20 February 2004.) I have still not managed
    to track down any other issues than Book 20, the marvellous A6 yellow-covered
    spineless 76-page pamphlet from 2001 which, maddeningly, contains no indication
    of its provenance. Here is Mr Davies'' Local Recipe Map, reprinted exactly as
    it appears in the original:

    Pie Nucleus!'
