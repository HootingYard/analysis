  text: 'Readers may recall that one of my favourite publications is Further Science
    by Norman Davies. (See Hedge Auras, 20 February 2004.) I have still not managed
    to track down any other issues than Book 20, the marvellous A6 yellow-covered
    spineless 76-page pamphlet from 2001 which, maddeningly, contains no indication
    of its provenance. Here is Mr Davies'' Local Recipe Map, reprinted exactly as
    it appears in the original:

    1. Far NE Scotland--marmalade / far NW--biscuits / far North--fish.

    2. Mid SW to NE--Devon / Yorks--rolls--cheese -sausage / cheese.

    3. So that about a Midlands triangular Pie Nucleus--there are fingers and eggs:
    hot pots, to the NW--marmalade / ham / loaf to the East. With a ginger NW apex.

    4. Tarts to the South--with W/E in the far South. Dumplings and Welsh herbs /
    cakes / fish puddings and scones. Etc.

    I think we need to arrange a Hooting Yard expedition to the Midlands triangular
    Pie Nucleus!'
