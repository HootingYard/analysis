  text: "Elsewhere in Further Science Book 20, Norman Davies has a section on dogs,\
    \ which begins, enigmatically, \u201CThat the fact that sea centuries old wood\
    \ when broken, is fresh orange and turns grey in 40 seconds, then black, is significant\u201D\
    . That may well be so, but it is not really pertinent to this paragraph. Nevertheless,\
    \ while we are on the subject of dogs, it gives me great pleasure to include this\
    \ photograph of Richard Milhous Nixon with his legendary pooch, Checkers.\n"
