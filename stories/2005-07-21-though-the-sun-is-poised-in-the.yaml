  text: "\u201CThough the sun is poised in the firmament above us, this earth would\
    \ remain for ever wrapped in midnight darkness were it not that there is an interposing\
    \ medium\u2014whatever it be\u2014to waft to us its heat waves and carry its splendours\
    \ to the tiniest nook and crevice. The language, its graces and powers, are for\
    \ the priest the instruments by which darkened minds are illumined, by which the\
    \ clear rays of living truth are flashed into their gloom.\u201D \u2014 Michael\
