  text: 'A letter arrives from reader E Duggleby:

    Dear Frank : Until I read the piece entitled A Snapshot From The History Of Athletics
    (21st July, below) I had no idea that the fictional sprinter Bobnit Tivol was
    your father. You will probably be interested to know that some years ago, when
    my collection of memorabilia related to this great invented athlete threatened
    to swamp my modest living quarters, I opened the world''s first Bobnit Tivol Museum.
    My collection includes the following items:

    His bus pass, his iron vest, a lithograph of one of his ears, the tentacles of
    a squid he admired, cranky old Halob''s cotton wool bag, several urgent telegraphic
    messages relating to the 1952 Helsinki "disturbances", a plasticine model of an
    apple-core with Bobnit Tivol''s teeth-marks clearly delineated, a jug, a pot,
    a basin, lavish petunia-strewn flooring from a podium uprooted from the soil of
    an incredible sporting arena described in the novel Bobnit Tivol And The Rotating
    Things From Planet Glub, silhouettes of Bobnit Tivol, Halob, and Christopher Plummer,
    old rags, a bottle of gripe water, splendid tungsten pincers, the hat of a gondolier
    and a red fez from Luxor, a pin cushion, turpentine, Norwegian wool, a map with
    blots, and ten recordings of the Shipping Forecast acoustically treated by one
    of the leading Dutch music pioneers of the twentieth century.

    If you or your readers would like to visit the Bobnit Tivol Museum, please be
    aware that it is virtually inaccessible to normal folk, being located in an ice-girt
    wasteland beset by howling gales. Ticket prices available upon request.'
