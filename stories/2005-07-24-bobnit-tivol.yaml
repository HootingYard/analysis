  text: "A letter arrives from reader E Duggleby:\nDear Frank : Until I read the piece\
    \ entitled A Snapshot From The History Of Athletics (21st July, below) I had no\
    \ idea that the fictional sprinter Bobnit Tivol was your father. You will probably\
    \ be interested to know that some years ago, when my collection of memorabilia\
    \ related to this great invented athlete threatened to swamp my modest living\
    \ quarters, I opened the world's first Bobnit Tivol Museum. My collection includes\
    \ the following items:\nHis bus pass, his iron vest, a lithograph of one of his\
    \ ears, the tentacles of a squid he admired, cranky old Halob's cotton wool bag,\
    \ several urgent telegraphic messages relating to the 1952 Helsinki \u201Cdisturbances\u201D\
    , a plasticine model of an apple-core with Bobnit Tivol's teeth-marks clearly\
    \ delineated, a jug, a pot, a basin, lavish petunia-strewn flooring from a podium\
    \ uprooted from the soil of an incredible sporting arena described in the novel\
    \ Bobnit Tivol And The Rotating Things From Planet Glub, silhouettes of Bobnit\
    \ Tivol, Halob, and Christopher Plummer, old rags, a bottle of gripe water, splendid\
    \ tungsten pincers, the hat of a gondolier and a red fez from Luxor, a pin cushion,\
    \ turpentine, Norwegian wool, a map with blots, and ten recordings of the Shipping\
    \ Forecast acoustically treated by one of the leading Dutch music pioneers of\
    \ the twentieth century.\nIf you or your readers would like to visit the Bobnit\
    \ Tivol Museum, please be aware that it is virtually inaccessible to normal folk,\
    \ being located in an ice-girt wasteland beset by howling gales. Ticket prices\
    \ available upon request."
