  text: '"Rusterich, one of the Teutonic gods, was found in an excavation... The head
    was made of metal and contained a pot of water. The mouth and another hole in
    the forehead being stopped by wooden plugs, a fire of charcoal was lighted under
    this pot of water, and at length the steam drove out the plugs with a great noise,
    and the god was shrouded in a mist of steam which concealed him from his astonished
    worshippers." -- John Sutherland Sinclair, Lectures On Popular And Scientific
