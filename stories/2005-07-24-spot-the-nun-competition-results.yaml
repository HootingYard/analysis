  text: "The Adjudication Panel for the Spot The Nun Competition (see Friday 15th\
    \ July below) had a tense meeting in the gorgeously redecorated Bodger's Spinney\
    \ Tea Rooms yesterday. I am not sure why it was tense, though there was some sort\
    \ of magnetic disturbance in the atmosphere, and one of the tea urns was making\
    \ violent throbbing noises. Anyway, the winner of the competition was announced\
    \ after several hours of deliberation. Reader Vincent Byrne of California sent\
    \ in this correct entry:\nIf you look far enough into the background on \u201C\
    C\u201D, using a magnifying glass, you will see that there is, in fact, a nun\
    \ glowering at the men holding the calf, with a ruler ready in hand. \u201CD\u201D\
    , on the other hand is a picture of a drawing of a nun, and therefore not wholly\
    \ a nun. \u201CA\u201D and \u201CB\u201D are much the same as \u201CD\u201D, being\
    \ records of famous nuns, but not nuns in themselves.\nVincent's prize is a no-expenses\
    \ spared visit to examine the important roadworks at the Blister Lane Bypass.\
    \ Well done!"
