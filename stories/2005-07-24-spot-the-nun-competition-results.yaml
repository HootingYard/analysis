  text: 'The Adjudication Panel for the Spot The Nun Competition (see Friday 15th
    July below) had a tense meeting in the gorgeously redecorated Bodger''s Spinney
    Tea Rooms yesterday. I am not sure why it was tense, though there was some sort
    of magnetic disturbance in the atmosphere, and one of the tea urns was making
    violent throbbing noises. Anyway, the winner of the competition was announced
    after several hours of deliberation. Reader Vincent Byrne of California sent in
    this correct entry:

    If you look far enough into the background on "C", using a magnifying glass, you
    will see that there is, in fact, a nun glowering at the men holding the calf,
    with a ruler ready in hand. "D", on the other hand is a picture of a drawing of
    a nun, and therefore not wholly a nun. "A" and "B" are much the same as "D", being
    records of famous nuns, but not nuns in themselves.

    Vincent''s prize is a no-expenses spared visit to examine the important roadworks
    at the Blister Lane Bypass. Well done!'
