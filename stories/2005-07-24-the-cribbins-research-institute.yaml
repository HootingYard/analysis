  text: 'A Press Release appears on our news desk from the Cribbins Research Institute,
    a "fully-funded body devoted to academic exegesis of the oeuvre of Bernard Cribbins",
    apparently. Publication of the launch issue of the Bulletin of Cribbins Studies
    has had to be postponed after two members of the editorial advisory panel got
    into a fist-fight underneath the canopy of the Institute''s hospitality tent at
    an international Cribbins Conference in Ulm. Worse was to come, as a screening
    of The Railway Children was disrupted by a gang of Nesbitistas, a paramilitary
    groupuscule devoted to the memory of author Edith Nesbit, whose uncompromising
    stance is that all film adaptations of her work are taboo. An inner "star chamber"
    of the most fanatical Nesbitistas issued a statement denouncing the Cribbins Research
    Institute. We will do our best to keep you up to date with further developments.
