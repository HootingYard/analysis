  text: '"I saw, dimly, the monstrous god that had been known in Mamurth in ages past.
    It was like a giant spider, with angled limbs that were yards long, and a hairy,
    repellent body. Even as I stood there, I wondered that the thing, invisible as
    it was, was yet visible by the life-blood in it... When I passed the thing, the
    intolerable odour of a crushed insect almost smothered me, and the monster itself
    made frantic efforts to loosen itself and spring at me. But it could not, and
    I got safely down, shuddering and hardly able to walk." -- Edmond Hamilton, The
    Monster-God Of Mamurth'
