  text: 'Regular readers know that here at Hooting Yard we like to keep abreast of
    important doings in the world of petulant Canadian pop songstresses. That being
    so, it did not escape our attention that a new acoustic version of Jagged Little
    Pill by Alanis Morissette is being issued as a "ten year anniversary commemorative
    edition".

    Next year will see the twentieth anniversary of the publication of two ground-breaking
    books, Stab Your Employer and Smooching With Istvan. These were early collaborations
    between Max Decharne and Frank Key and are, just like Dobson''s pamphlets, sadly
    out of print. Following Ms Morissette''s example, I think that twentieth anniversary
    commemorative acoustic editions would be a splendid idea. I know what you''re
    thinking--these were written works, not musical ones. Hell, we won''t let that
    stop us! Max and I have already arranged for a series of meetings to thrash out
    the details of the project.

    Meanwhile, admirers of the woman Johnny Esposito calls "Her Shrillness", if there
    are any, ought to visit the Alanis Morissette Random Lyrics Generator.'
