  text: 'It was dusk, and wantons had gathered in the spinney. Beyond the spinney,
    across the lake, was the running track where Bobnit Tivol had sprinted his way
    to immortality. The trackside, where once lupins had flamed forth, was now overgrown
    with charlock and bindweed and blackish darnel, clumps of which were thickest
    by the old well, where long, long ago the Woohoohoodywoo Woman had cast her spells.
    When they marked out the track back in 1934, they had forgotten about the well.
    They had forgotten about the hornets, too, and the wasps, and the bees, all of
    them drawn to the field for as long as anybody could remember, and never successfully
    exterminated. Even the sulphur bombs detonated by old Halob''s squad of flying
    insect killers failed. Back then, of course, old Halob was not yet old, but he
    had already cultivated a certain gravitas. Punctilio came to him later.

    Now the ghosts of old Halob and fictional sprint champion Bobnit Tivol haunt that
    long-abandoned athletics venue. That is why, at dusk, over in the spinney, the
    wantons gather. Dressed in flowing gowns stitched together from fire-damaged curtain
    material, the wantons descend upon the spinney armed with baskets of peppers and
    peapods and potatoes, brimming baskets from which the peppers and peapods and
    potatoes tumble and are strewn as the wantons skip along the path that leads to
    the spinney. No wanton stoops to pick up the fallen veg, as dusk falls, for they
    like to lay a trail. They make no secret of their gathering in the spinney across
    the lake from the ruined running track. All the townsfolk know they are heading
    there, at dusk on the third Thursday of each month, the skipping wantons with
    their baskets, but they are never followed. In the town, shutters are shut and
    lamps lit, and in their gloomy rooms the people switch on their radios, loud,
    and listen to dance band music of the golden age, and distract themselves with
    card games and charades, for they try not to think about the wantons in the spinney
    summoning up the ghosts of Bobnit Tivol and old Halob.

    By the running track itself, as dusk grows deeper, the hornets and bees and wasps
    no longer stir. They go wherever flying insects go at night, or they sleep, if
    such creatures sleep, in their nests, hidden in the brambles and the bindweed.
    Often the field that once saw Bobnit Tivol run round and round in record time
    is engulfed in mist. Why do the wantons gather in the spinney across the lake,
    instead of here? Before we find out, there are some blots to contend with.


    You have negotiated the blots, as a kayak negotiates rapids. Well done. Now we
    must discover why the wantons gather in the spinney. It is because they believe
    that phantoms are imbued with special powers if they are made to cross a body
    of water. The wantons want Bobnit Tivol and Halob, or their spirits, to materialise
    among the slumbering hornets and wasps and bees of the derelict running track,
    and then to pass over the still silent lake, and thus to come to them in the spinney.
    These athletic ghosts, empowered by water, will be given offerings of peppers
    and peapods and potatoes, and then the wantons will send them into the town, to
    do what the wantons want done. But nobody yet knows what the wantons want, for
    on no third Thursday have the ghosts come shimmering across the lake to them.
    No, the wantons wait all night, skipping while they wait, in circles, their gowns
    flowing, and at dawn they skip away from the spinney, their baskets empty, back
    into the town where radios still blare, where the shutters are still shut, into
    the dawn of another day when no one will speak the names of Halob or of Bobnit
    Tivol, not today nor evermore, for of course neither the wily trainer nor his
    protege ever existed in the first place, and if their ghosts do appear, it is
    only once a month, one misty night, in the wild minds of the wantons who skip
    in the spinney.'
