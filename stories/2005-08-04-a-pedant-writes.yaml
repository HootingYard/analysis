  text: 'A letter from Tim Thurn.

    Dear Mr Key : In the piece entitled The Bilgewater Elegies (26th July), there
    is a glaring narrative error. Dobson counts flags during his taxi ride from the
    seaport to the chalet, but a few lines later we learn that he kept his eyes shut
    throughout the journey. I cannot be the only reader to abhor such errors, which
    quite ruined the piece. Close study of writers such as Dennis Wheatley, Anthony
    Burgess, and Tobias Smollett will help you to avert such howlers in future. Yours
    ever, Tim Thurn

    What Mr Thurn fails to realise is that the piece he refers to was written according
    to the strict rules of Dobsonian Ubertexts, as outlined in the out-of-print pamphlet
    Some Thoughts About Shabby Taverns, Cows And The 1958 Munich Air Disaster Which
    Wiped Out The Flower Of Post-War English Football, Although Sir Matt Busby Survived
    The Crash, Praise The Lord. Read and learn, Tim, read and learn.
