  text: 'Many years ago I wrote a piece with the above title, in which I invented
    some, er, lesser-known editions of the Bible. It was reasonably amusing, and one
    of these days I might reprint parts of it here. But I was young then, and had
    not done my research. Now I have, and I must say that some of the genuine Bibles
    far outshine my own paltry juvenilia.

    I have been reading Isaac Disraeli''s Curiosities Of Literature, one section of
    which is entitled "The Bible Prohibited And Improved". Here are some extracts.

    "We have had several remarkable attempts to recompose the Bible; Dr. Geddes''s
    version is aridly literal, and often ludicrous by its vulgarity; as when he translates
    the Passover as the Skipover, and introduces Constables among the ancient Israelites.

    "Sebastian Castillon took a very extraordinary liberty with the sacred writings.
    He fancied he could give the world a more classical version of the Bible, and
    for this purpose introduces phrases and entire sentences from profane writers
    into the text of holy writ. His whole style is finically quaint, overloaded with
    prettinesses, and all the ornaments of false taste. Of the noble simplicity of
    the Scripture he seems not to have had the remotest conception."

    Disraeli is particularly taken by a French priest named Pere Berruyer, who "recomposed
    the Bible as he would have written a fashionable novel":

    "He conceives that [Moses] is too barren in his descriptions, too concise in the
    events he records, nor is he careful to enrich his history by pleasing reflections
    and interesting conversation pieces, and hurries on the catastrophes, by which
    means he omits much entertaining matter." Berruyer, on the other hand, creates
    "relishing morsels" which were "devoured eagerly in all the boudoirs of Paris".

    "Take a specimen of the style: Joseph combined, with a regularity of features
    and a brilliant complexion, an air of the noblest dignity; all which contributed
    to render him one of the most amiable men in Egypt. The wife of Potiphar declares
    her passion, and pressed him to answer her. It never entered her mind that the
    advances of a woman of her rank could ever be rejected. Joseph at first only replied
    to all her wishes by his cold embarrassments. She would not yet give him up. In
    vain he flies from her; she was too passionate to waste even the moments of his
    astonishment. In this manner the patriarchs are made to speak in the tone of the
    tenderest lovers; Judith is a Parisian coquette, Holofernes is rude as a German
    baron; and their dialogues are tedious with all the reciprocal politesse of metaphysical
    French lovers! This good father had caught the language of the beau monde, but
    with such perfect simplicity that, in employing it on sacred history, he was not
    aware of the ludicrous style in which he was writing."

    The thought strikes me that there may exist a Bible written from a Dobsonian perspective.
    I shall do some further research, and keep readers informed.'
