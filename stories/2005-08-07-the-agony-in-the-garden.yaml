  text: 'There was a man in my back garden and he was in agony. I am going to tell
    you why. This man had speared his foot with a garden fork. One of the very sharp
    tines of the fork had plunged through his boot and sock and foot and more sock
    and the sole of the boot and into the muck, forced downwards by the man''s other
    foot, or rather by the muscular power of his leg, bent at the knee. He was wearing
    a pair of butcher''s trousers, this man, but he was not a butcher. He was a clumsy
    thief, inexperienced in the use of gardening implements.

    It was the middle of the night, and there was no moon, or I should say the moon
    was hidden by monstrous black clouds, so it was very, very dark. Nonetheless,
    one would have thought the thief who clambered over a fence to steal things from
    my back garden would have carried a torch or some other means of illuminating
    his criminal intent. But not only was he a clumsy thief, he was a thief who lacked
    foresight. Because the day was still light when he set out from the hut o'' ne''er-do-wells
    where he lived, he seems to have assumed it would still be light when he approached
    the wooden fence which divides my back garden from the old muddy lane. But it
    was no longer light. I lived so far away from the hut that it took him hours and
    hours to reach my garden. His route was crooked and even convoluted, for he hugged
    the hedgerows and dared not stride across open fields, nor follow main roads,
    and nor did he risk using any of the public transport systems available, the pneumatic
    railways or the canal barges, for, being bent on crime, he did not wish to be
    seen.

    He may have been clumsy and lacking in foresight, but the man in my back garden
    whose foot was impaled by a fork was a master of stealth, I will give him that.
    In all the hours he skulked across the land, in his butcher''s trousers and pastry-maker''s
    jacket and Dusty Springfield hat, he was not seen by a single other living being,
    except for some cows in a field, and a passing goat, and attentive birds, and
    countless tiny things that creep and fly and hover and buzz, but none of these
    can speak, unlike human beings, who, had they seen the thief, might have denounced
    him to the police.


    A cow in a field

    For all his stealth, however, and irrespective of the cackhandedness of his fork-digging,
    the clumsy thief''s crime would never have succeeded. He had not made rigorous
    plans. Had he done so, he would have learned that I am a detective, whose tenacity
    in tracking down malefactors is legendary. One of the things that makes me so
    good at my job is the fact that I never sleep. As a child, at a fairground, on
    a hot September day, I toppled from the top of a helter skelter and landed on
    my head. I have never since then visited the Land of Nod. The metal plate in my
    skull is barely visible, and it has been one of the incidental pleasures of my
    life to amass a collection of strikingly colourful eyepatches.

    So it was that in the middle of the night, when all sensible people are fast asleep
    in their beds, I was wide awake. I can''t remember what I was doing, darning an
    eyepatch or sharpening a pencil, perhaps, or carrying out experiments on a badger.
    When I heard the telltale sounds of a wrongdoer climbing over the fence from the
    old muddy lane, I went over to the window. My working eye is a superb mechanism,
    and I watched as, in pitch darkness, the thief grabbed the fork from the pile
    of forks, searched the lawn for the big chalk X underneath which was buried the
    booty of the Blister Lane bank robberies, and with his very first fork-thrust,
    speared his foot, and howled. I promised to tell you how there came to be a man
    in my back garden, a man in agony, and now I have done so, and you can''t say
    fairer than that.'
