  text: 'Reader Salim Fadhley was reading The Agony In The Garden (see below, 7th
    August) when the phrase "some cows in a field" apparently prompted his brain to
    ponder other cows, in other fields. "I was reminded," he writes, "of some pictures
    of particularly sinister cows." Here is one of the pictures. If you click on it,
    you can see some more.


    Have other readers found that reading words and phrases in Hooting Yard texts
    sends their brains off in interesting directions, summoning up thoughts, memories,
    images, or mental connections? If so, we are always pleased to hear from you.'
