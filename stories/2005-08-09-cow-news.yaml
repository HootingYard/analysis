  text: "Reader Salim Fadhley was reading The Agony In The Garden (see below, 7th\
    \ August) when the phrase \u201Csome cows in a field\u201D apparently prompted\
    \ his brain to ponder other cows, in other fields. \u201CI was reminded,\u201D\
    \ he writes, \u201Cof some pictures of particularly sinister cows.\u201D Here\
    \ is one of the pictures. If you click on it, you can see some more.\n\nHave other\
    \ readers found that reading words and phrases in Hooting Yard texts sends their\
    \ brains off in interesting directions, summoning up thoughts, memories, images,\
    \ or mental connections? If so, we are always pleased to hear from you."
