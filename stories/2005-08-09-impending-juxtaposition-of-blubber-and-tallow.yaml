  text: On Thursday next Mister Taplow will be presenting a talk at Sawdust Bridge
    Salvation Hall. He has made private arrangements to rent the building for the
    evening, so the usual manicuring session will not take place. Mister Taplow intends
    to discuss the relative merits of blubber and tallow, with specific reference
    to the manufacture of candles. Most of you will know that Mister Taplow is blind.
    The talk is scheduled to begin at 7.30 p.m., after which there will be an opportunity
    to ask questions, although Mister Taplow has indicated that he may not have time
    to answer more than a couple, as he will have to dash off, on horseback, to a
    mountainous retreat by 9.45 p.m. The Trustees of Sawdust Bridge Salvation Hall
    have made arrangements for little snacks to be served to those attending, although
    no crockery will be provided. Mister Taplow's guide dog, Agamemnon, will be on
    hand to gobble up any spillages, such as cake-crumbs. Agamemnon will not be accompanying
    his master to the mountains, so if anyone can provide the hound with a comfortable
    place to sleep for the night, that would be appreciated. Mister Taplow says he
    will collect the dog within six working days. Those who know Mister Taplow only
    from his talks on ostriches, fog, the brains of geese, shoe polish and Crosby
    Stills & Nash will, we hope, be pleasantly surprised by his erudition in what
    is, for him, a brand new topic. As ever, state of the art technology will be used
    to make a recording of the talk, for future release as a compact disc with a cover
    design by noted local mezzotintist Rex Tint. Please note that all those attending
    are asked to bring either a blubber candle or a tallow candle, but not both. Stewards
    will allocate seats on the night. The attic of Sawdust Bridge Salvation Hall is
    still infested with weird bird-like life-forms which screech horribly, but rest
    assured they are quite harmless. Tickets for this exciting event are available
    from all those kiosks clustered around the market square, or by post from Mister
    Taplow's Exciting Talks, c/o Mister Taplow The Blind Man, The Strangely Mesmeric
    Building, Blister Lane.
