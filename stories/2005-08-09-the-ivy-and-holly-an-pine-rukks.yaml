  text: '"The ivy and holly an'' pine rukks never pookered a lav when our Saviour
    was gaverin'' of his kokero, an'' so they tools their jivaben saw the wen, and
    dicks selno saw the besh; but the ash, like the surrelo rukk, pukkered atut him,
    where he was gaverin, so they have to hatch mullo adree the wen. And so we Rommany
    chals always hatchers an ash yag saw the Boro Divvuses. For the tickno duvel was
    chivved a wadras ''pre the puvius like a Rommany chal, and kistered apre a myla
    like a Rommany, an'' jalled pale the tem a mangin his moro like a Rom. An'' he
    was always a pauveri choro mush, like we, till he was nashered by the Gorgios."
