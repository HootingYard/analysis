    was gaverin'' of his kokero, an'' so they tools their jivaben saw the wen, and
    dicks selno saw the besh; but the ash, like the surrelo rukk, pukkered atut him,
    where he was gaverin, so they have to hatch mullo adree the wen. And so we Rommany
    chals always hatchers an ash yag saw the Boro Divvuses. For the tickno duvel was
    chivved a wadras ''pre the puvius like a Rommany chal, and kistered apre a myla
