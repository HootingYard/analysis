  text: "Through clenched teeth, in municipal yet verdant parkland, sprawled on grass,\
    \ Blodgett recited the alphabet.\n\u201CA is for vinegar,\u201D he grunted, \u201C\
    B is for worms, C is for villains swinging from the gallows\u2026\u201D\nA little\
    \ voice inside Blodgett's head told him to stop. He knew he had got it wrong again.\
    \ He rolled himself down the gentle incline of the grass until he came to rest.\
    \ Then he sat up and picked flecks of plant-life out of his hair. The sun was\
    \ shining but the park was almost deserted. He peered across the green towards\
    \ the choc ice tent, and licked his lips. Would he splash out on a choc ice? Blodgett\
    \ fumbled in his pockets for change, but they were empty. He wondered if there\
    \ was anybody in charge of the choc ice tent. Perhaps it, too, was deserted, and\
    \ the choc ices were there for the taking. It was more likely that there would\
    \ be some kind of automatic choc ice dispenser, but Blodgett knew he could jimmy\
    \ it open with his jimmy. He recalled that he had left his jimmy at home, in a\
    \ cupboard, with his empty yohoort cartons. Blodgett always pronounced \u201C\
    yogurt\u201D as \u201Cyohoort\u201D, he was that kind of guy. He lay down again\
    \ and closed his eyes and clenched his teeth and made yet another attempt at the\
    \ alphabet.\n\u201CA is for spinach, B is for the wildlife of the Great Lakes,\
    \ C is for Pol Pot\u2026.\u201D\nIt was no use. Clambering to his feet, Blodgett\
    \ ran across the green to the paddling pool. Though it was the height of summer,\
    \ the pool had been drained. All the water had been collected in a sort of giant\
    \ concrete bath located a few feet below ground, inaccessible to anyone who was\
    \ not employed by the municipal park authorities. Had Blodgett known that several\
    \ park-keepers were at that very moment enjoying frolics in the subterranean pool,\
    \ he would have become angry, and had he become angry he would have tilted his\
    \ head up and stared boldly at the sun, and let forth a stream of execrations,\
    \ and the sun would have shrivelled up and died, such was the force of Blodgett's\
    \ inhuman rage.\nBut Blodgett did not know about the underground paddling pool,\
    \ nor of the antics taking place down there, so the sun was safe. He turned away\
    \ and headed for the gate in the fence. He had decided to go to the docks, to\
    \ watch the arrival and departure of gigantic container ships. It was Wednesday,\
    \ and he was sure to see big boxes of bananas and bales of flax."
