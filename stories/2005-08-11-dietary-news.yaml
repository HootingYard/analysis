  text: 'Many years ago, I decided to experiment by living on a subsistence diet of
    gruel for a while. (I do hope my readers understand that this is a true story.)
    I think I was pandering to my ascetic, puritanical streak. For the duration of
    the exercise, I eschewed all other foodstuffs, even to the point where I was tempted
    neither by pap nor by slops. Around the same time I read somewhere that krill
    was the Food of the Future. This appealed to me hugely, but gruel seemed easier
    to come by than krill.

    This is by way of introduction to my recent discovery of another alleged Food
    of the Future, in the form of poi, a thoroughly exciting dish from Hawaii. Poi
    is made from the taro plant, which is apparently the fourteenth most cultivated
    crop on earth. The root or corm of the taro is cooked for hours and hours and
    then pounded into a sticky goo that has the consistency of library paste, which
    makes it especially appealing to those of us who are bookish. One of the other
    great things about poi is that you can dispense with cutlery, as it is shovelled
    daintily into the mouth using your bare hands.

    So if you are on the lookout for a sour paste to serve as your staple diet, poi
    seems to be the thing. Maybe after eating a delicious bowl of the goo, you may
    wish to engage in fire dancing, fire twirling, fire spinning, or fire swinging,
    for all of which you can use fire poi. If you wish to know more, I suggest that
    you join an online fire twirler community.

    Food and fire... who ever said Hooting Yard was not a repository of essential
    information for a fulfilling life?'
