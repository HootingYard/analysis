  text: "\u201CAs I was talking with them one of their camels belched, and the donkey\
    \ took fright and ran off, and the gods fell off its back, and three of them were\
    \ broken, and only two remained whole. But when the Syrians saw what had happened,\
    \ they said, \u2018Why did you not tell us that you had gods to sell? We might\
    \ have bought them before the donkey took fright, and they would not have been\
    \ destroyed; at least we will take the gods that remain, and pay you the price\
    \ of them all\u2019. And they did so; and the broken gods I cast into the river\
    \ Gur, and they sank and were seen no more.\u201D \u2014 M R James, Old Testament\
