  text: '"As I was talking with them one of their camels belched, and the donkey took
    fright and ran off, and the gods fell off its back, and three of them were broken,
    and only two remained whole. But when the Syrians saw what had happened, they
    said, ''Why did you not tell us that you had gods to sell? We might have bought
    them before the donkey took fright, and they would not have been destroyed; at
    least we will take the gods that remain, and pay you the price of them all''.
    And they did so; and the broken gods I cast into the river Gur, and they sank
    and were seen no more." -- M R James, Old Testament Legends'
