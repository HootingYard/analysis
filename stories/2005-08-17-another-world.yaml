  text: "It is appropriate that today's quotation is taken from an \u201Cesoteric\u201D\
    \ book entitled Another World, as I have received conclusive information that\
    \ Hooting Yard is read by at least one being from another world. Whether that\
    \ world is the Star City of Montalluyah I do not know.\n\nI confess to being thoroughly\
    \ overexcited at the fact that Hooting Yard has an extraterrestrial being as a\
    \ reader, and a little glum that he, she, or it only dropped in once. If anyone\
    \ knows how I might communicate with alien worlds, short of joining the Star Fellowship\
    \ (see Wedd Star, 10th February 2005), please drop me a line. If I can work out\
    \ how to send my thought-beams to an unknown world, that lone alien reader may\
    \ return, and perhaps be joined by others."
