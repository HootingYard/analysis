  text: 'It is appropriate that today''s quotation is taken from an "esoteric" book
    entitled Another World, as I have received conclusive information that Hooting
    Yard is read by at least one being from another world. Whether that world is the
    Star City of Montalluyah I do not know.


    I confess to being thoroughly overexcited at the fact that Hooting Yard has an
    extraterrestrial being as a reader, and a little glum that he, she, or it only
    dropped in once. If anyone knows how I might communicate with alien worlds, short
    of joining the Star Fellowship (see Wedd Star, 10th February 2005), please drop
    me a line. If I can work out how to send my thought-beams to an unknown world,
    that lone alien reader may return, and perhaps be joined by others.'
