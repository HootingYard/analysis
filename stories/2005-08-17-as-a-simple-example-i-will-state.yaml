  text: '"As a simple example, I will state that wild birds are caught by means of
    a sympathetic electricity. For this purpose a long, hollow metal tube is used,
    at the bottom of which is a globe containing a powerful acid. A receptacle at
    the top of the tube contains seeds much liked by the birds. They hover about these
    seeds, and, when they are within a certain distance, a slight pressure on a wooden
    spring causes a drop of the acid in the globe to escape into the tube, and so
    to set in movement a current of electricity, which, being very sympathetic to
    the bird, acts as an attractor so powerful, that it cannot get away. The tube
    is then gently lowered, and the birds are gradually drawn near to the earth, when
    a light net is thrown over the captives, and they are shaken into a cage-net at
    the bottom. Calmed by the electricity, they do not flutter or struggle when thus
    secured. It is very interesting to see the birds come nearer and nearer as the
    rod is lowered towards the ground. For electrical purposes it is necessary to
    catch the birds alive." -- Benjamin Lumley, Another World; or Fragments From The
    Star City Of Montalluyah'
