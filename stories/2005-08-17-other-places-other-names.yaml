  text: "While we are on the subject of other worlds (or at least other places), it\
    \ is worth remembering that Dobson once wrote a pamphlet entitled Netherlands,\
    \ Holland, Dutch\u2014What's That About? The opening lines provide a summary of\
    \ its subject matter:\nWe call China China and its people Chinese. We call Finland\
    \ Finland and its people Finns. We call Germany Germany and its people Germans.\
    \ I could go on, but I won't. What I want to know is, why do we have two interchangeable\
    \ names\u2014the Netherlands and Holland\u2014for the country whose inhabitants\
    \ we call Dutch? Why don't we say Netherlanders or Hollanders? What's all that\
    \ about?\nIt's a remarkable pamphlet, chiefly because Dobson, having posed an\
    \ interesting linguistic question, blathers on for over forty pages trying desperately\
    \ to conceal the fact that he has done no research whatsoever. He simply makes\
    \ things up and veers off at tangents. One such tangent is Dobson's brief look\
    \ at what other nationalities call themselves. For example, the Chinese call China\
    \ Zhongguo, the Finns call Finland Suomi, and, most enticingly, Shqiperi is where\
    \ Albanians live and breathe and have their being.\nThere are times when I foolishly\
    \ try to emulate Dobson, and I must confess that, like him, I have not bothered\
    \ to research this Netherlands\u2014Holland\u2014Dutch business either. Perhaps\
    \ a kind reader can enlighten me.\n\nAn Albanian postage stamp depicting a curly\
    \ pelican"
