  text: 'While we are on the subject of other worlds (or at least other places), it
    is worth remembering that Dobson once wrote a pamphlet entitled Netherlands, Holland,
    Dutch--What''s That About? The opening lines provide a summary of its subject
    matter:

    We call China China and its people Chinese. We call Finland Finland and its people
    Finns. We call Germany Germany and its people Germans. I could go on, but I won''t.
    What I want to know is, why do we have two interchangeable names--the Netherlands
    and Holland--for the country whose inhabitants we call Dutch? Why don''t we say
    Netherlanders or Hollanders? What''s all that about?

    It''s a remarkable pamphlet, chiefly because Dobson, having posed an interesting
    linguistic question, blathers on for over forty pages trying desperately to conceal
    the fact that he has done no research whatsoever. He simply makes things up and
    veers off at tangents. One such tangent is Dobson''s brief look at what other
    nationalities call themselves. For example, the Chinese call China Zhongguo, the
    Finns call Finland Suomi, and, most enticingly, Shqiperi is where Albanians live
    and breathe and have their being.

    There are times when I foolishly try to emulate Dobson, and I must confess that,
    like him, I have not bothered to research this Netherlands--Holland--Dutch business
    either. Perhaps a kind reader can enlighten me.
