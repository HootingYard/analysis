  text: 'Every now and then, I am buttonholed by importunate persons who yell, "Hey
    there, Frank Key, what kinds of things do you get up to when you''re not researching
    and writing the Hooting Yard pages or doing your radio show on Resonance104.4FM?"

    My tendency has been to deflect such questions with a grunt or a faked choking
    fit, or sometimes to burst into song. Shenandoah is one of my favourites, or I
    might attempt one of the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss (1864-1949). Thus
    I allowed an air of mystery to surround me--or so I thought, until the other day,
    when reader Ian Sherred wrote to inform me that I am being followed by a biographer
    every bit as indefatigable as James Boswell.

    Apparently, a certain Jeb is frantically scribbling up my doings, without my permission.
    I don''t know whether to be flattered or enraged. Reluctant as I am to allow Hooting
    Yard readers a glimpse into my hitherto secret life, I suppose I should point
    you in the direction of Vengeance by Jeb, given that it is already in the public
    domain.

    I have to say, though, that you might be better off taking a look at some of Mr
    Sherred''s own stories, at www.constrained.org.'
