    Hey there, Frank Key, what kinds of things do you get up to when you're not researching\
    \ and writing the Hooting Yard pages or doing your radio show on Resonance104.4FM?\u201D\
    \nMy tendency has been to deflect such questions with a grunt or a faked choking\
    \ fit, or sometimes to burst into song. Shenandoah is one of my favourites, or\
    \ I might attempt one of the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss (1864-1949). Thus\
    \ I allowed an air of mystery to surround me\u2014or so I thought, until the other\
    \ day, when reader Ian Sherred wrote to inform me that I am being followed by\
    \ a biographer every bit as indefatigable as James Boswell.\nApparently, a certain\
    \ Jeb is frantically scribbling up my doings, without my permission. I don't know\
    \ whether to be flattered or enraged. Reluctant as I am to allow Hooting Yard\
    \ readers a glimpse into my hitherto secret life, I suppose I should point you\
    \ in the direction of Vengeance by Jeb, given that it is already in the public\
    \ domain.\nI have to say, though, that you might be better off taking a look at\
    \ some of Mr Sherred's own stories, at www.constrained.org."
