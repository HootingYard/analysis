  text: '"Sunday, August 7th. In afternoon with Father H---- and John [Lord Dumfries]
    to Palace, and then with him to the Gruoch''s Den. He gives us a long account
    of the psychical disturbances at B----; noises between his bed and the ceiling,
    like continuous explosion of petards, so that he could not hear himself speak,
    &c. &c. [Mr. Huggins afterwards recommended the use of a phonograph for these
    noises, in order to ascertain absolutely whether they are objective or subjective,
    and I wrote so to S----of B----.] Monday, August 8th. Father H----went away."
