    \ [Lord Dumfries] to Palace, and then with him to the Gruoch's Den. He gives us\
    \ a long account of the psychical disturbances at B\u2014\u2014; noises between\
    \ his bed and the ceiling, like continuous explosion of petards, so that he could\
    \ not hear himself speak, &c. &c. [Mr. Huggins afterwards recommended the use\
    \ of a phonograph for these noises, in order to ascertain absolutely whether they\
    \ are objective or subjective, and I wrote so to S\u2014\u2014of B\u2014\u2014\
