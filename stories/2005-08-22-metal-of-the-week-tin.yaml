  text: "This week's Hooting Yard Metal of the Week is tin.\nMany words rhyme with\
    \ tin, such as bin, din, sin, gin, Rumpelstiltskin, and pin. For this reason,\
    \ it is quite easy to make up verses about tin. Harder, though, to ensure that\
    \ those verses have something arresting, urgent and original to say, especially\
    \ about tin, if it is the main subject of the poem. Let us imagine that you have\
    \ been commissioned by a maker of calico prints to sing the praises of tin chloride\
    \ as a reducing agent and as a mordant. I doubt very much that you would be able\
    \ to dash off a suitable poem just by listing the words that rhyme with tin. But\
    \ perhaps you are more accomplished as a poet than I am.\nIn his pamphlet Astrochemistry\
    \ : A Study of Metal-Planet Affinities (Emergence Press, 1984), Nick Kollerstrom\
    \ writes Tin is the one metal of the seven which does not show much evidence of\
    \ its planet's signature. I asked an astrologer about this and he replied: \u2018\
    Why, how could it? The Jupiter attributes\u2014expansion, joviality, wisdom\u2014\
    how could a metal express these?\u2019 How indeed? It seems that with tin we have\
    \ to be content with only a very partial expression of the planet traditionally\
    \ associated with it. Mr Kollerstrom does not explain how a big lump of rock,\
    \ metallic hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, and gaseous hydrogen orbiting the sun millions\
    \ of miles away \u201Cexpresses\u201D expansion, joviality, and wisdom, but I\
    \ am sure he knows what he is talking about, because he makes a point of stressing\
    \ that he is an MA Cantab, and thus no ordinary mortal.\nDobson was no ordinary\
    \ mortal either, for different reasons. As one might expect, he turned his attentions\
    \ to tin on a number of occasions, chiefly in the pamphlet he called simply Tin\
    \ Book. He set himself the task of mentioning tin once on the first page, twice\
    \ on the second page, and so on until the final page included forty-four mentions\
    \ of the silvery, malleable poor metal that is not easily oxidized in air and\
    \ resists corrosion. This leads to somewhat idiotic passages such as this, from\
    \ page ten:\nI stood on the mountainside in the rain. There was a crow perched\
    \ on my head, and its talons clawed at my scalp, but I had swallowed an anti-crow-clawing-pain\
    \ pill an hour earlier. I peered into the rain-sodden gloom until I could make\
    \ out the weather vane in the far distance. Conditions were perfect for the Shouting\
    \ The Names Of Metals At The Sky experiment. \u201CTin!\u201D I yelled, \u201C\
    Tin tin tin tin tin tin tin tin tin!\u201D\nDobsonian scholars have got themselves\
    \ into something of a tizz arguing whether the out-of-print pamphleteer is describing\
    \ actual events in Tin Book, or just making them up. My own view is that it hardly\
    \ matters.\nTo end this fascinating look at our Metal of the Week, try to lodge\
    \ the following fact in your cranium. At low temperatures, tin exists as gray\
    \ or alpha tin, which has a cubic crystal structure similar to silicon. When warmed\
    \ above 13.2 \xB0C it changes into white or beta tin, which is metallic and has\
    \ a tetragonal structure. Alpha tin ought not be confused with the Alpha Course,\
    \ created by Nicky Gumbel, which propounds a reductive and distorted version of\
    \ Christianity, nor with Alpha males. Dobson, by the way, once described himself\
    \ as an Epsilon male, but quite what he meant by that is far from clear.\n\nLeft\
    \ to right : Tin, Tin, Tintin"
