  text: 'This week''s Hooting Yard Metal of the Week is tin.

    Many words rhyme with tin, such as bin, din, sin, gin, Rumpelstiltskin, and pin.
    For this reason, it is quite easy to make up verses about tin. Harder, though,
    to ensure that those verses have something arresting, urgent and original to say,
    especially about tin, if it is the main subject of the poem. Let us imagine that
    you have been commissioned by a maker of calico prints to sing the praises of
    tin chloride as a reducing agent and as a mordant. I doubt very much that you
    would be able to dash off a suitable poem just by listing the words that rhyme
    with tin. But perhaps you are more accomplished as a poet than I am.

    In his pamphlet Astrochemistry : A Study of Metal-Planet Affinities (Emergence
    Press, 1984), Nick Kollerstrom writes Tin is the one metal of the seven which
    does not show much evidence of its planet''s signature. I asked an astrologer
    about this and he replied: ''Why, how could it? The Jupiter attributes--expansion,
    joviality, wisdom--how could a metal express these?'' How indeed? It seems that
    with tin we have to be content with only a very partial expression of the planet
    traditionally associated with it. Mr Kollerstrom does not explain how a big lump
    of rock, metallic hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, and gaseous hydrogen orbiting the
    sun millions of miles away "expresses" expansion, joviality, and wisdom, but I
    am sure he knows what he is talking about, because he makes a point of stressing
    that he is an MA Cantab, and thus no ordinary mortal.

    Dobson was no ordinary mortal either, for different reasons. As one might expect,
    he turned his attentions to tin on a number of occasions, chiefly in the pamphlet
    he called simply Tin Book. He set himself the task of mentioning tin once on the
    first page, twice on the second page, and so on until the final page included
    forty-four mentions of the silvery, malleable poor metal that is not easily oxidized
    in air and resists corrosion. This leads to somewhat idiotic passages such as
    this, from page ten:

    I stood on the mountainside in the rain. There was a crow perched on my head,
    and its talons clawed at my scalp, but I had swallowed an anti-crow-clawing-pain
    pill an hour earlier. I peered into the rain-sodden gloom until I could make out
    the weather vane in the far distance. Conditions were perfect for the Shouting
    The Names Of Metals At The Sky experiment. "Tin!" I yelled, "Tin tin tin tin tin
    tin tin tin tin!"

    Dobsonian scholars have got themselves into something of a tizz arguing whether
    the out-of-print pamphleteer is describing actual events in Tin Book, or just
    making them up. My own view is that it hardly matters.

    To end this fascinating look at our Metal of the Week, try to lodge the following
    fact in your cranium. At low temperatures, tin exists as gray or alpha tin, which
    has a cubic crystal structure similar to silicon. When warmed above 13.2 degC
    it changes into white or beta tin, which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure.
    Alpha tin ought not be confused with the Alpha Course, created by Nicky Gumbel,
    which propounds a reductive and distorted version of Christianity, nor with Alpha
    males. Dobson, by the way, once described himself as an Epsilon male, but quite
    what he meant by that is far from clear.
