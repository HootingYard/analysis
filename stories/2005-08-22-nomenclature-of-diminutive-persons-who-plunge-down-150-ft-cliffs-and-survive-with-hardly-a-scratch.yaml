  text: 'The most recent addition to our list which attempts a complete nomenclature
    of diminutive persons who survive after toppling over the edge of cliffs is Demi-Leigh
    Tweddle. The wonderfully-named Ms Tweddle meets the diminutiveness criterion in
    that she is a six year old child. Last week, she tumbled one hundred and fifty
    feet down the cliffs at Chimney Hole, near Filey, in North Yorkshire, while playing
    roly poly. When she reached the bottom, she simply picked herself up and walked
    around to find her parents.

    Demi-Leigh Tweddle should not be confused with Dairylea Twaddle, which is a generic
    term for the advertising guff spouted by the makers of foil-wrapped processed
    cheese triangles and similar produce.

    Rumours that your esteemed editor has changed his name to Demi-Frank Key are inaccurate
    and can be discounted.'
