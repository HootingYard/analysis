  text: '"The so-called bag, however, is smaller in width, manufactured of flexible
    lumalloy which is proof against storm, lightning, and, in fact, everything except
    explosives... The gas is used as fuel, eliminating all sound save for a faint
    hissing... We have utilized the gas in small quantities within the ship. The controls,
    the hatches and elevator, and the disappearing guns, or rather their carriages,
    are automatically operated. The X-Gas may be released upon our foes with dreadful
    results. It causes a thin, yellowing, impenetrable haze and, contrary to ordinary
    principles, does not rise!" -- Cyril Plunkett, The X Gas'
