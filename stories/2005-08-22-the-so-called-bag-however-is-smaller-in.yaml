  text: "\u201CThe so-called bag, however, is smaller in width, manufactured of flexible\
    \ lumalloy which is proof against storm, lightning, and, in fact, everything except\
    \ explosives\u2026 The gas is used as fuel, eliminating all sound save for a faint\
    \ hissing\u2026 We have utilized the gas in small quantities within the ship.\
    \ The controls, the hatches and elevator, and the disappearing guns, or rather\
    \ their carriages, are automatically operated. The X-Gas may be released upon\
    \ our foes with dreadful results. It causes a thin, yellowing, impenetrable haze\
    \ and, contrary to ordinary principles, does not rise!\u201D \u2014 Cyril Plunkett,\
    \ The X Gas"
