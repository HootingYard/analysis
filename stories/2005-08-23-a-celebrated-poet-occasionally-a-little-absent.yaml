  text: "\u201CA celebrated poet, occasionally a little absent in mind, was invited\
    \ by a friend, whom he met in the street, to dine with him the next Sunday at\
    \ a country lodging, which he had taken for the summer months. The address was,\
    \ \u2018near the Green Man at Dulwich\u2019; which, not to put his inviter to\
    \ the trouble of pencilling down, the absent man promised faithfully to remember.\
    \ But when Sunday came, he, fully late enough, made his way to Greenwich, and\
    \ began inquiring for the sign of the Dull Man.\u201D \u2014 Harold Begbie, The\
    \ Bed-Book Of Happiness"
