  text: '"A celebrated poet, occasionally a little absent in mind, was invited by
    a friend, whom he met in the street, to dine with him the next Sunday at a country
    lodging, which he had taken for the summer months. The address was, ''near the
    Green Man at Dulwich''; which, not to put his inviter to the trouble of pencilling
    down, the absent man promised faithfully to remember. But when Sunday came, he,
    fully late enough, made his way to Greenwich, and began inquiring for the sign
    of the Dull Man." -- Harold Begbie, The Bed-Book Of Happiness'
