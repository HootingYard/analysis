  text: "I have just learned, too late, that yesterday was National Punctuation Day.\
    \ Well, it was in the United States of Pining & Pothorst Land*. That being so,\
    \ the website is emblazoned with patriotic flags, refers to periods rather than\
    \ full stops, has a picture of \u201CNational Punctuation Day Founder\u201D Jeff\
    \ Rubin wearing a vest down at the gym, is littered with \xAEs wherever you look,\
    \ and seems to be aimed primarily at the \u201Cbusiness community\u201D. I can\
    \ only sigh. Peter Blegvad once \u201Cdreamed of a world where accountants are\
    \ rarer than poets\u201D. Would that it were so.\nAnyway, I came upon Jeff Rubin's\
    \ gym vest &c. via the link at languagehat.com, which also points us in the direction\
    \ of this rather splendid history of punctuation.\n* NOTE : For an explanation\
    \ of this term, see Pining And Pothorst, 2nd September 2004."
