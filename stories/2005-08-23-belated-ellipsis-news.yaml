  text: 'I have just learned, too late, that yesterday was National Punctuation Day.
    Well, it was in the United States of Pining & Pothorst Land*. That being so, the
    website is emblazoned with patriotic flags, refers to periods rather than full
    stops, has a picture of "National Punctuation Day Founder" Jeff Rubin wearing
    a vest down at the gym, is littered with (r)s wherever you look, and seems to
    be aimed primarily at the "business community". I can only sigh. Peter Blegvad
    once "dreamed of a world where accountants are rarer than poets". Would that it
    were so.

    Anyway, I came upon Jeff Rubin''s gym vest &c. via the link at languagehat.com,
    which also points us in the direction of this rather splendid history of punctuation.

    * NOTE : For an explanation of this term, see Pining And Pothorst, 2nd September
    2004.'
