  text: 'A spiv recently handed me a picture which, he announced, showed the legendary
    athletics trainer Old Halob. Devotees of fictional sprinter Bobnit Tivol will
    know that Old Halob was the crusty, dignified genius who spent much of his time
    shouting from the trackside with peculiar guttural menace. Before I had a chance
    to ask which of the people depicted I should be looking at, the spiv scampered
    away, saying he had to buy tickets for an anniversary concert in which television
    person Keith Chegwin would reprise his vocal accompaniment to the Third Ear Band''s
    soundtrack for The Tragedy Of Macbeth (Roman Polanski, 1971).


    If the spiv is to be believed, one of the people in the picture above is Old Halob.
    But which one? See if you can spot him.

    Thanks to Ian Sherred for that glimpse into Cheggers'' past'
