  text: "\u2026 and I shall walk along the pathways adjacent to Yoko Ono Boulevard\
    \ all the days of my life. And as I pass the hedgerows that line those pathways,\
    \ lo! I will see many birds, the sorts of birds which make their nests in hedgerows,\
    \ which I know not. And there will be the counting of the birds.\nNow, hear how\
    \ lies the land. There is the path, or the pathways, and then there are the hedgerows,\
    \ and then there is the Boulevard, so that we might say the hedgerows divide the\
    \ pathways from the Boulevard. And in this division are the nesting birds. And\
    \ they will be counted.\nIf I have a hope, it is that starlings are the sorts\
    \ of birds that make their nests in hedgerows, for it is to the counting of starlings\
    \ that I am drawn. I shall not shirk from counting all the birds, but that is\
    \ my hope.\nIn the days now past I counted bees. The bees to be counted were beyond\
    \ the Boulevard, many leagues distant, out on the sand dunes where their hives\
    \ had been put. It came to pass that the clouds grew black and thunder cracked,\
    \ and one by one the hives were struck by lightning and no bees remained to be\
    \ counted. For twenty days and twenty nights I walked across the plains and the\
    \ deserts, away from the sand dunes, until I came to Yoko Ono Boulevard. And I\
    \ waited at the side of that great thoroughfare. I waited twenty more days and\
    \ twenty more nights but I could not pass. All along the Boulevard was a ceaseless\
    \ flow of cars and vans and pantechnicons and trucks and charabancs, and I waited.\n\
    And lo! I heard the blast of a trump and an angel appeared before me. \u201CAre\
    \ you he who counted the bees of the kingdom?\u201D it asked, and I replied with\
    \ full heart. And then the angel led me down towards a dark subterranean tunnel\
    \ beneath the Boulevard and led me through it. And I came up into the light on\
    \ the other side. And I saw that I was upon a pathway, and that yonder were hedgerows,\
    \ and that beyond the hedgerows was the Boulevard still roaring with cars and\
    \ vans and pantechnicons and trucks and charabancs.\nAnd the angel spoke again.\
    \ \u201CHere is the hedgerow that divides the pathway from the Boulevard,\u201D\
    \ it said, waxing like unto James Mason, \u201CAnd within this division you will\
    \ find many birds a-nesting, and where once you counted the bees you will henceforth\
    \ be the counter of the birds.\u201D\nAnd then the angel was gone. And I took\
    \ up my tally stick. And then you, my inquisitor, you with the green and golden\
    \ hat stopped me on the pathway and asked me, \u201CDo you know the way to the\
    \ Blister Lane Bypass?\u201D And I replied that I knew it not. And then it happened\
    \ that I clutched at the sleeve of your raiment and I told you that I shall walk\
    \ along the pathways adjacent to Yoko Ono Boulevard all the days of my life \u2026"
