  text: 'Monday''s Metal Of The Week item on tin proved surprisingly popular with
    readers, and I have received quite a few requests for additional tin-related material.
    I do not mean to be churlish, but if my biographer devil, the enigmatic Jeb (see
    19th August) is going to have anything of interest to write, he will need me to
    do more than trudge back and forth to the library to consult dusty old reference
    books about metals. As a sop to the tin-fixated, however, Max Decharne helpfully
    comes to the rescue with this:


    There you are, two more tins. I am no expert on this particular hound o'' film,
    but I can tell you one thing. So devoted was Rin Tin Tin''s owner, Corporal Lee
    Duncan, that when his wife filed for divorce, she cited Rin Tin Tin as co-respondent,
    saying Duncan loved the dog more than her. The divorce case was dropped and never
    granted.

    Meanwhile, out in Texas, apparently, "the 87-year legacy continues at El Rancho
    Rin Tin Tin", which is a bit like El Rancho Hooting Yard, but with dogs.'
