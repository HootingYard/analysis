  text: '"No one should put any trust in the spoons, which are constructed apparently
    of pewter shavings in a chronic state of semi-fusion. On the evening of the second
    day, the landlady allowed a second knife at tea, as the knife-of-all-work had
    begun to knock up under the heavy strain upon its powers; but this supplementary
    instrument was of the ornamental kind, and, like other ornamental things, broke
    down at a crisis, which took the form of a piece of crust." -- George Forrest
    Browne, Ice-Caves Of France And Switzerland'
