  text: "\u201CNo one should put any trust in the spoons, which are constructed apparently\
    \ of pewter shavings in a chronic state of semi-fusion. On the evening of the\
    \ second day, the landlady allowed a second knife at tea, as the knife-of-all-work\
    \ had begun to knock up under the heavy strain upon its powers; but this supplementary\
    \ instrument was of the ornamental kind, and, like other ornamental things, broke\
    \ down at a crisis, which took the form of a piece of crust.\u201D \u2014 George\
    \ Forrest Browne, Ice-Caves Of France And Switzerland"
