  text: 'Wait until it has stopped raining, then put on a pair of stout boots and
    stride off to your nearest bog. Bear with me, there is a point to this. Now, do
    not stop when you get to the bog, but carry on going, step on in. As you do, listen
    carefully. What is the sound you hear as your boots squelch through the bog? Is
    it something like glob ... glob ... glob? Splendid! You are now able to appreciate
    to the full the happy conjunction of title and author that I want to tell you
    about.

    I grew up in a house crammed with books, and my parents had eclectic tastes. One
    volume I recall with particular relish, even though I never read it, was The Bog
    People by P V Glob. Bog, Glob--perfect, really. I suspect my childhood memories
    of these words printed together on a blue paperback spine have influenced me in
    all sorts of ways. P V Glob (1911-1985) was the Director General of Museums and
    Antiquities for the State of Denmark and Director of the National Museum in Copenhagen,
    and his book is subtitled Iron-Age Man Preserved. You can read all about it at
    bookslut.


    Pipe-smoking P V Glob, out in the field'
