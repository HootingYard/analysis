    \ threatening a pandemic that could wipe out millions, I was heartened this morning\
    \ to hear some useful advice from a Canadian banker on BBC Radio 4. \u201CThe\
    \ best preparation you can make against Asian bird flu,\u201D said this sage,\
    \ \u201Cis to strengthen the quality of your investment portfolio\u201D. Don't\
    \ you just adore bankers? I am almost tempted to release hordes of Callistan Gnishii\
    \ into his office."
