  text: Are you worried about Asian bird flu? As the strain moves remorselessly westward,
    threatening a pandemic that could wipe out millions, I was heartened this morning
    to hear some useful advice from a Canadian banker on BBC Radio 4. "The best preparation
    you can make against Asian bird flu," said this sage, "is to strengthen the quality
    of your investment portfolio". Don't you just adore bankers? I am almost tempted
    to release hordes of Callistan Gnishii into his office.
