  text: "I was thinking that Dr Ruth Pastry had been eerily quiet of late, but I need\
    \ not have feared. Following an item on the page yesterday, the kraken wakes!\n\
    For crying out loud, Key!, she begins, tetchily, After reading Clamour For Tin\
    \ I have been thrown, as they say, for a loop. You may not know this, but for\
    \ over a year now I have been working on a hand-drawn map of Hooting Yard and\
    \ its environs, or hinterland. By close textual analysis, and using the back of\
    \ a very big sheet of wallpaper, I have been able to work out the relative locations\
    \ of, for example, Pang Hill, Bodger's Spinney, the Blister Lane Bypass, O'Houlihan's\
    \ Wharf, and other sites of Hooting Yard interest. Certain passages you have written\
    \ have allowed me to make educated guesses regarding the whereabouts of Pointy\
    \ Town and\u2014albeit with difficulty\u2014Tantarabim. I have a notebook filled\
    \ with conjectures about Gaar, and though adding it to my map will probably involve\
    \ buying a second very big sheet of wallpaper, I can already anticipate the glee\
    \ with which I will use crayons to mark the site of the bottomless viper pit.\
    \ And now what do I find? You suddenly throw in something called \u201CEl Rancho\
    \ Hooting Yard\u201D which doesn't fit anywhere on my map, and my map is a lovely\
    \ thing, though I say so myself. Either I am going to have to begin all over again,\
    \ or you should admit that you made up this anomalous \u201Crancho\u201D on the\
    \ spur of the moment, without giving a smidgeon of thought to your most devoted\
    \ readers. Take heed, Key. Yours fuming, Dr Ruth Pastry\nSo here, for Dr Pastry\
    \ and others, is a hint. From Loopy Copse, head south until you reach Sawdust\
    \ Bridge, but instead of making the crossing, strike out to the west, or possibly\
    \ to the east, and follow the track that goes past the Tundist Owl Library. At\
    \ some point, all will become crystal clear."
