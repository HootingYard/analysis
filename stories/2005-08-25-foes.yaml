    Sometimes it can happen that you find yourself with a foe, or enemy. This may
    be the result of some ancient blood feud, or it may be more recent. You might,
    say, steal some fruit from a greengrocer and thereafter the greengrocer becomes
    your foe. I am not suggesting for one moment that Hooting Yard readers are the
    kind of people who go around stealing plums or berries, I simply use that as an
    example. Ancient blood feuds are more complicated, often having their origin in
    the doings--or misdoings--of your remote ancestors, for which you are in no way
    responsible. That being so, you should nevertheless be aware that an ancient blood
    feud foe is likely to be alarming, vicious, and bent on violence, whereas the
    greengrocer whose plum you slipped in your pocket may not remain your foe for
    long. The greengrocer''s enmity is of a less frenzied sort.

    It is a good idea to assess the level of enmity your foe feels towards you before
    accepting their invitation to meet, unarmed, at the top of a high tower. If they
    have a foe-score of more than seven point five, it may well be that they plan
    to push you over the edge of the tower so that you plunge to your doom on the
    savage rocks below. Less than seven point five and your foe may simply have chosen
    a place with breathtaking views the better to facilitate a little chat, after
    which bygones will be bygones.

    Of course, arriving at the foe-score is not an exact science, so when you have
    conducted the tests it is advisable to repeat them. Always allow for a margin
    of error. Should it be your judgement that your life would be imperilled by meeting
    your foe in a high tower, do try to send a polite note explaining that you will
    be unable to make the appointment. Invent an excuse if necessary, but try to cleave
    to the truth if you can.
