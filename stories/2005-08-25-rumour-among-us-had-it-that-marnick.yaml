  text: '"Rumour among us had it that Marnick maintained special quarters up on the
    surface... a stone house against the barren rock; and that in this house was a
    certain room into which Marnick thrust the men who displeased him. Beyond this
    even rumour failed to go, but we often hazarded guesses. The most prevalent guess
    was that Marnick released hordes of Callistan Gnishii into this room, then stood
    at a glass-paned door and shrieked with insane laughter." -- Henry Hasse, Out
    Of This World'
