  text: "\u201COf course, you know my friend the squirting cucumber. If you don't,\
    \ that can be only because you've never looked in the right place to find him\u2026\
    \ If peradventure you chance to brush up against the plant accidentally, or you\
    \ irritate it of set purpose with your foot or your cane, then, as Mr Rider Haggard\
    \ would say, \u2018a strange thing happens\u2019: off jumps the little green fruit\
    \ with a startling bounce, and scatters its juice and pulp and seeds explosively\
    \ through a hole in the end where the stem joined on to it. The entire central\
    \ part of the cucumber\u2026 squirts out elastically through the breach in the\
    \ outer wall, leaving the hollow shell behind as a mere empty windbag.\u201D \u2014\
