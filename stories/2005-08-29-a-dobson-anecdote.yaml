  text: "It would be no exaggeration to say that Dobson was besotted with cinema.\
    \ He was always a great filmgoer, and on occasion his enthusiasm led him into\
    \ typically preposterous escapades. There was a period when he became infatuated\
    \ with Hollywood films about lowlife gangsterdom and seedy urban hustling. One\
    \ day he announced to Marigold Chew that he was going to run a numbers racket.\n\
    \u201CWhat are you talking about?\u201D asked Marigold.\nDobson explained that\
    \ in many of the films he had been watching, characters were often employed as\
    \ \u201Crunners for the numbers racket\u201D, and that he found such a trade diverting.\
    \ \u201CIt will make a change from writing pamphlets,\u201D he said.\nHaving studied\
    \ his sources carefully, Dobson worked out that \u201Crunning the numbers\u201D\
    \ involved roaming the streets tracking down his clients and taking money from\
    \ them. But first, he reasoned, they needed their numbers, a side of the racket\
    \ that was probably not shown in the films because it lacked drama. He approached\
    \ his new career methodically, first drawing up a list of people to whom he could\
    \ give numbers. Deciding to limit himself to a dozen clients, he included his\
    \ next door neighbours on both sides, the post office person, a crestfallen chap\
    \ who walked his dog along the street every day, the bell foundry janitor, Mrs\
    \ Pod and the five orphans she taught in her ramshackle Sunday School, and\u2014\
    because he could think of nobody else\u2014Marigold Chew.\nThis much accomplished,\
    \ Dobson realised that he did not know which numbers he ought to give them. He\
    \ spent a few weeks catching up on appropriate films, but learned nothing new,\
    \ so he buried his head in ancient numerological and astrological texts, much\
    \ as, he suspected, characters like \u201CTwo Hats\u201D McGulligan did off-screen\
    \ before entering the numbers racket.\nHaving chosen twelve numbers, Dobson wrote\
    \ each one down on scraps of paper and spent an overcast afternoon distributing\
    \ them to his clients. Only Marigold asked him what he thought he was doing, to\
    \ which he replied \u201CI am running a numbers racket. That is your number. Keep\
    \ it safe.\u201D\nDobson's excitement mounted as the week went past. To calm himself\
    \ down, he spent much of the time at a pigsty, observing pigs doing what pigs\
    \ do. Then, after seven days had elapsed, he went roaming around to collect his\
    \ money. Life imitated art, however. Each of his twelve clients whined and wheedled\
    \ and pleaded for more time to pay, complaining of a lack of funds and promising\
    \ that they would pay up as soon as they could. Dobson found the whimpering of\
    \ Mrs Pod's orphans particularly exasperating, so much so that within hours he\
    \ decided to go back to pamphlet-writing.\nAbout two years later, Marigold Chew\
    \ asked him about his numbers racket, but by then Dobson's cinematic enthusiasm\
    \ was for films about the earth being invaded by hostile extra-terrestrial beings\
    \ with suckers and tentacles, and he was busy writing an essay explaining why\
    \ they always landed their spaceships near major American cities, rather than,\
    \ say, English seaside resorts or campsites.\nSource : Some Things Dobson Did\
