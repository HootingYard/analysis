  text: 'It would be no exaggeration to say that Dobson was besotted with cinema.
    He was always a great filmgoer, and on occasion his enthusiasm led him into typically
    preposterous escapades. There was a period when he became infatuated with Hollywood
    films about lowlife gangsterdom and seedy urban hustling. One day he announced
    to Marigold Chew that he was going to run a numbers racket.

    "What are you talking about?" asked Marigold.

    Dobson explained that in many of the films he had been watching, characters were
    often employed as "runners for the numbers racket", and that he found such a trade
    diverting. "It will make a change from writing pamphlets," he said.

    Having studied his sources carefully, Dobson worked out that "running the numbers"
    involved roaming the streets tracking down his clients and taking money from them.
    But first, he reasoned, they needed their numbers, a side of the racket that was
    probably not shown in the films because it lacked drama. He approached his new
    career methodically, first drawing up a list of people to whom he could give numbers.
    Deciding to limit himself to a dozen clients, he included his next door neighbours
    on both sides, the post office person, a crestfallen chap who walked his dog along
    the street every day, the bell foundry janitor, Mrs Pod and the five orphans she
    taught in her ramshackle Sunday School, and--because he could think of nobody
    else--Marigold Chew.

    This much accomplished, Dobson realised that he did not know which numbers he
    ought to give them. He spent a few weeks catching up on appropriate films, but
    learned nothing new, so he buried his head in ancient numerological and astrological
    texts, much as, he suspected, characters like "Two Hats" McGulligan did off-screen
    before entering the numbers racket.

    Having chosen twelve numbers, Dobson wrote each one down on scraps of paper and
    spent an overcast afternoon distributing them to his clients. Only Marigold asked
    him what he thought he was doing, to which he replied "I am running a numbers
    racket. That is your number. Keep it safe."

    Dobson''s excitement mounted as the week went past. To calm himself down, he spent
    much of the time at a pigsty, observing pigs doing what pigs do. Then, after seven
    days had elapsed, he went roaming around to collect his money. Life imitated art,
    however. Each of his twelve clients whined and wheedled and pleaded for more time
    to pay, complaining of a lack of funds and promising that they would pay up as
    soon as they could. Dobson found the whimpering of Mrs Pod''s orphans particularly
    exasperating, so much so that within hours he decided to go back to pamphlet-writing.

    About two years later, Marigold Chew asked him about his numbers racket, but by
    then Dobson''s cinematic enthusiasm was for films about the earth being invaded
    by hostile extra-terrestrial beings with suckers and tentacles, and he was busy
    writing an essay explaining why they always landed their spaceships near major
    American cities, rather than, say, English seaside resorts or campsites.
