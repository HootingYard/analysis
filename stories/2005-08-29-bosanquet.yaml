  text: "Pansy Cradledew has recently become enamoured of the computer game Bosanquet,\
    \ which she will play for hours at a time, seemingly removed from an earthly plane.\
    \ Though I do not share her enthusiasm for this so-called \u201Cgame of skill,\
    \ tactics, problem-solving and strategy\u201D, Pansy assures me that she is but\
    \ one among a legion of devotees. She also says that, as an expert player, she\
    \ wants to reach out to those less adept than herself, and has asked me to publish\
    \ a few little hints and tips.\n\u201CThese should not be considered as something\
    \ so vulgar as \u2018cheats\u2019,\u201D she writes, \u201Cbut as advisory notes\
    \ for those Bosanquetistas (as we dub ourselves) who have not yet reached the\
    \ exalted level in which I bask.\u201D\nHere, then, is an edited version of the\
    \ dozens upon dozens of pages of scribbled jottings Pansy sent in:\nTranche 6\
    \ : The Rushdie can be placated by moving the cursor over the red squares next\
    \ to the pond. There is a squirrel hidden under the canopy. Press CTRL-SHIFT repeatedly\
    \ to capture the goat.\nTranche 11 : To avoid the bees, hold down all the numeric\
    \ keys and move your avatar to the square beside the pillows.\nTranche 43 : The\
    \ ice-field is really a devil's pit. Get past it by collecting all sixteen nougat-bags.\n\
    Tranche 49 : My fastest time at this tranche is a whopping four hours thirty six\
    \ minutes. Remember that to pass the crepuscular nozzles you have to bring your\
    \ sack of V S Naipaul novels from the previous tranche.\nTranche 60 : Martin Amis\
    \ can only be beheaded by using the cursor to drag the sword across the blobs.\n\
    Tranche 144 : Hit the arrow keys in this order :UP-UP-UP-LEFT-LEFT-UP-RIGHT-DOWN.\
    \ This will take you to the lair of the savage brontosaurus and you will be able\
    \ to swallow the magic potion. Be careful of the magnetic locusts.\nIf Pansy's\
    \ \u201Cadvisory notes\u201D are to be believed, there are at least two hundred\
    \ more tranches to complete, but that is quite enough of this nonsense."
