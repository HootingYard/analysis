    This is Reginald Bosanquet (1932-1984), whose surname was appropriated by persons
    unknown as the title of Pansy Cradledew''s favourite computer game. Older readers
    will remember Mr Bosanquet as a television newsreader and raffish drunk. According
    to his lamentably brief entry in the wikipedia, "viewers were sometimes not impressed
    by his competence at reading the news, he was often clearly puzzled by the correct
    pronunciation of foreign names, and by news stories containing technical matters
    he did not understand". In other words, he had human frailties, rather than being
    a zonk-eyed robot. Those were the days. His father was a cricketer named Bernard
    Bosanquet who invented the googly, apparently. I have no idea what that means.'
