  text: "\nThis is Reginald Bosanquet (1932-1984), whose surname was appropriated\
    \ by persons unknown as the title of Pansy Cradledew's favourite computer game.\
    \ Older readers will remember Mr Bosanquet as a television newsreader and raffish\
    \ drunk. According to his lamentably brief entry in the wikipedia, \u201Cviewers\
    \ were sometimes not impressed by his competence at reading the news, he was often\
    \ clearly puzzled by the correct pronunciation of foreign names, and by news stories\
    \ containing technical matters he did not understand\u201D. In other words, he\
    \ had human frailties, rather than being a zonk-eyed robot. Those were the days.\
    \ His father was a cricketer named Bernard Bosanquet who invented the googly,\
    \ apparently. I have no idea what that means."
