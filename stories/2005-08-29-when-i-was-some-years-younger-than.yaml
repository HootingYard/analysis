  text: '"When I was some years younger than I am at present, I used to employ myself
    in a more laborious diversion, which I learned from a Latin treatise of exercise,
    that is written with great erudition: It is there called the Skimachia, or the
    fighting with a man''s own shadow, and consists in the brandishing of two short
    sticks grasped in each hand, and loaded with plugs of lead at either end. This
    opens the chest, exercises the limbs, and gives a man all the pleasure of boxing,
    without the blows." -- John Hamilton Moore, The Young Gentleman And Lady''s Monitor,
    And English Teacher''s Assistant'
