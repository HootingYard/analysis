  text: "\u201CWhen I was some years younger than I am at present, I used to employ\
    \ myself in a more laborious diversion, which I learned from a Latin treatise\
    \ of exercise, that is written with great erudition: It is there called the Skimachia,\
    \ or the fighting with a man's own shadow, and consists in the brandishing of\
    \ two short sticks grasped in each hand, and loaded with plugs of lead at either\
    \ end. This opens the chest, exercises the limbs, and gives a man all the pleasure\
    \ of boxing, without the blows.\u201D \u2014 John Hamilton Moore, The Young Gentleman\
    \ And Lady's Monitor, And English Teacher's Assistant"
