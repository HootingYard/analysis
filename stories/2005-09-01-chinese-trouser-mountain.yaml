  text: 'The current trade row about EU import quotas on cheap Chinese clothing is
    something I know little about, and understand even less. It has, however, led
    to frequent media use of such ringing phrases as "the Chinese trouser mountain".
    During Mao''s Cultural Revolution, one of the more preposterous operas of the
    time was Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy, later used by Brian Eno as the title
    of one of his early records. (Brian, being Brian, enclosed the last two words
    in parentheses, a deft but inexplicable alteration.) Is it time for a revival
    of the opera, retitled Taking Trouser Mountain By Strategy? I hope so.
