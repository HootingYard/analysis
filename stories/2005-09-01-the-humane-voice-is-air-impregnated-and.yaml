  text: '"The Humane Voice is Air, impregnated, and made Sonorous by the impressed
    Character of the Life, or is such, as whilst it is in breathing forth, doth smite
    upon the Organs of the Voice, so, as they tremble thereupon; for indeed, without
    this tremulous Motion, no Voice is made: Yea, not only the Larynx, or Wind-pipe,
    doth thereupon tremble, but the whole Skull also; yea, and sometimes all the Bones
    of the whole Body, which any one may easily find in himself, by his applying his
    Hand to his Throat, and laying it on the top of his Head." -- John Conrade Amman,
