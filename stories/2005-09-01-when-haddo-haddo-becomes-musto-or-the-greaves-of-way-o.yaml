  text: 'Pat the pouch in which you keep your watch and listen while I tell you about
    the times when haddo-haddo becomes musto. Pouch patted? All well and good, and
    the time on your watch ticking and tocking. Attend to the tocks, my mother always
    said, but my father was rather a tick man. He was a poster boy for the greaves
    of way-o, big grinning fangs and a lopsided hat, and no pal of haddo-haddo. Every
    Thursday he brought home an eel, already dead, and he chopped it up on the sideboard
    with his mighty hatchet, and then he fed it to the cat.

    I was trained in botany, because I became musto. I was alert to both the ticks
    and the tocks, given my upbringing. I had a lot of lanterns. Remember this was
    fenland, flat and wet, no haddo-haddo here. They used to give me a new biro on
    my birthday but I always lost them soon enough. The greaves of way-o were big
    on biros then, I remember, especially in the fens.

    I had by musto my ha''penny salt tokens. In those days my management skills were
    second to none. It was all like clockwork to me, but one thing I am not going
    to talk about is the presence of toads and my presentiments thereof.

    So mark well the eel, the cat, the biros, the fens, that tick and tock, and your
    patted pouch, and you can bet your own ha''penny token on haddo-haddo becoming
    musto, all aboard the greaves of way-o, say I.'
