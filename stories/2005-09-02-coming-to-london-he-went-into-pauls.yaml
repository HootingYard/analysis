  text: '"Coming to London, he went into Paul''s Church, where walking very melancholy
    in the middle aisle with Captain Thingut and his fellowes, he was invited to dine
    at Duke Humphry''s ordinary, where, amongst other good stomachs that repaired
    to his bountiful feast, there came a whole jury of penniless poets, who being
    fellows of a merry disposition (but as necessary in a commonwealth as a candle
    in a straw bed), he accepted of their company, and as from poets cometh all kind
    of folly, so he hoped by their good directions to find out his Foole of Fooles,
    so long looked for." -- W A Clouston, The Book Of Noodles'
