  text: "\u201CComing to London, he went into Paul's Church, where walking very melancholy\
    \ in the middle aisle with Captain Thingut and his fellowes, he was invited to\
    \ dine at Duke Humphry's ordinary, where, amongst other good stomachs that repaired\
    \ to his bountiful feast, there came a whole jury of penniless poets, who being\
    \ fellows of a merry disposition (but as necessary in a commonwealth as a candle\
    \ in a straw bed), he accepted of their company, and as from poets cometh all\
    \ kind of folly, so he hoped by their good directions to find out his Foole of\
    \ Fooles, so long looked for.\u201D \u2014 W A Clouston, The Book Of Noodles"
