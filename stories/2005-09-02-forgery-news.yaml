  text: 'It had to happen sooner or later. I have been alerted to the fact that counterfeit
    Dobson pamphlets are circulating. Although they are so badly faked that they could
    only fool complete nitwits, police in the forgery hub nerve-centre estimate that
    villains are raking in millions. Below is the cover of a particularly shoddy example.
    Dobson did indeed write about lichens, but only once, in the ground-breaking Disquisition
    Upon Clotted Cream, Lichens, And Dustin Hoffman. So be on your guard, and remember--Dobson
    is now, and always has been, an out-of-print pamphleteer.
