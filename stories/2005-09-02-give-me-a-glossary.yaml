  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I enjoy reading Hooting Yard and usually find\
    \ it both instructive and enlightening. However, I must say that the piece entitled\
    \ When Haddo-Haddo Becomes Musto [yesterday] left me somewhat jolt-brained. It\
    \ is unlikely that you would write complete nonsense, so perhaps I am missing\
    \ something. Could I prevail upon you to provide some sort of glossary to help\
    \ in my appreciation and understanding? Yours perplexed, Tim Thurn\nFor you, Tim,\
    \ anything. Here is a glossary of some of the crucial words and passages.\nthe\
    \ times when haddo-haddo becomes musto : Usually between 4.00 and 4.30 p.m. on\
    \ Wednesday afternoons, particularly when it is raining or about to rain.\nthe\
    \ tocks : Suggestive of both toxin, a poisonous substance generated in an animal\
    \ body (animals may include cows, crows, cormorants, squirrels and ducks, among\
    \ many others) and tocsin, an alarm-bell. Dobson once began some notes on \u201C\
    the tocks of a toxin tocsin\u201D but discarded them, and wisely so.\nthe greaves\
    \ of way-o : Impenetrable.\nan eel : The generation of eels has long been a mystery.\
    \ Aristotle believed they \u201Cgrew from the guts of wet soil\u201D, that they\
    \ emerged, unfertilised, from mud. We now know that all eels are spawned in the\
    \ Sargasso Sea, but no one has ever seen it happen.\nthe cat : Note the definite\
    \ article, signalling that a particular cat is being referred to. Teasingly, we\
    \ are not given the name of the cat. Popular cat names include Tiddles, Marmalade,\
    \ Napoleon, Bootpolish, and Gravitas, so it may be one of them.\nfenland : Not\
    \ Finland, fenland. Are there any fens in Finland? I don't know, but I'll find\
    \ out.\na new biro : Writing implement named after L\xE1szl\xF3 J\xF3zsef B\xED\
    r\xF3 (1899-1985), a Hungarian journalist, although his brother Georg, a chemist,\
    \ played an important part in developing the ball-point mechanism. B\xEDr\xF3\
    's birthday, 19th September, is celebrated as Argentine Inventors' Day in the\
    \ Argentine. The B\xEDr\xF3 brothers moved to that country in 1943.\nha'penny\
    \ salt tokens : paper or cardboard tokens, worth one half penny in pre-decimal\
    \ currency (worthless at today's prices, and though only thirty four years dead,\
    \ seemingly as historically distant as the groat), which could be exchanged for\
    \ salt. How many grains, or fistfuls, of salt you got for your ha'penny was subject\
    \ to fluctuation. Some believed that the token-to-salt ratio moved in spooky parallel\
    \ with planetary conjunctions, and at least one ha'penny salt token astrolabe\
    \ is known to have been constructed, though by whom, when, where and why is not\
    \ known, nor will it ever be known, yea, unto the umpteenth generation.\ntoads\
    \ : probably natterjack, or golden, ah! all golden and poisonous."
