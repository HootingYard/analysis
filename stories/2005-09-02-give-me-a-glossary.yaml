  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I enjoy reading Hooting Yard and usually find
    it both instructive and enlightening. However, I must say that the piece entitled
    When Haddo-Haddo Becomes Musto [yesterday] left me somewhat jolt-brained. It is
    unlikely that you would write complete nonsense, so perhaps I am missing something.
    Could I prevail upon you to provide some sort of glossary to help in my appreciation
    and understanding? Yours perplexed, Tim Thurn

    For you, Tim, anything. Here is a glossary of some of the crucial words and passages.

    the times when haddo-haddo becomes musto : Usually between 4.00 and 4.30 p.m.
    on Wednesday afternoons, particularly when it is raining or about to rain.

    the tocks : Suggestive of both toxin, a poisonous substance generated in an animal
    body (animals may include cows, crows, cormorants, squirrels and ducks, among
    many others) and tocsin, an alarm-bell. Dobson once began some notes on "the tocks
    of a toxin tocsin" but discarded them, and wisely so.

    the greaves of way-o : Impenetrable.

    an eel : The generation of eels has long been a mystery. Aristotle believed they
    "grew from the guts of wet soil", that they emerged, unfertilised, from mud. We
    now know that all eels are spawned in the Sargasso Sea, but no one has ever seen
    it happen.

    the cat : Note the definite article, signalling that a particular cat is being
    referred to. Teasingly, we are not given the name of the cat. Popular cat names
    include Tiddles, Marmalade, Napoleon, Bootpolish, and Gravitas, so it may be one
    of them.

    fenland : Not Finland, fenland. Are there any fens in Finland? I don''t know,
    but I''ll find out.

    a new biro : Writing implement named after Laszlo Jozsef Biro (1899-1985), a Hungarian
    journalist, although his brother Georg, a chemist, played an important part in
    developing the ball-point mechanism. Biro''s birthday, 19th September, is celebrated
    as Argentine Inventors'' Day in the Argentine. The Biro brothers moved to that
    country in 1943.

    ha''penny salt tokens : paper or cardboard tokens, worth one half penny in pre-decimal
    currency (worthless at today''s prices, and though only thirty four years dead,
    seemingly as historically distant as the groat), which could be exchanged for
    salt. How many grains, or fistfuls, of salt you got for your ha''penny was subject
    to fluctuation. Some believed that the token-to-salt ratio moved in spooky parallel
    with planetary conjunctions, and at least one ha''penny salt token astrolabe is
    known to have been constructed, though by whom, when, where and why is not known,
    nor will it ever be known, yea, unto the umpteenth generation.

    toads : probably natterjack, or golden, ah! all golden and poisonous.'
