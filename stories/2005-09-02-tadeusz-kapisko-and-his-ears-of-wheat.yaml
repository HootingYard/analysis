  text: 'In certain parts of the world, people still sit around their fires at dusk
    and tell each other stories. In the wretched village where Marigold Chew grew
    up, there was one tale in particular that was told over and over again. This was
    the story of Tadeusz Kapisko and his ears of wheat. It was told so often--sometimes
    three or four times in a single evening--that it was embedded in Marigold''s brain,
    and years later, she could recount it word for word, barely pausing for breath.
    Dobson always knew when she was about to launch into the yarn, because she sucked
    in her cheeks and puckered her lips in what he thought of as "that Kapisko way".

    Curiously, the tale of Tadeusz Kapisko and his ears of wheat was never written
    down, but if Marigold Chew''s memory is accurate, there was a record of sorts.
    She remembered, as an infant, seeing pictorial representations of the main points
    of the story, richly painted in crimson, cerulean blue and orpiment. Later in
    life, she tried to describe them.

    I recall, she wrote, that the first picture was of Tadeusz Kapisko half hidden
    behind a cow. It was, decisively, a French cow, une vache. I remember thinking
    how significant this was, even as a tiny tot. The second picture was the shape
    of a medallion. The painter overdid the orpiment, but what I loved about this
    one was that it showed the exact moment of a hen''s cluck. Tadeusz Kapisko is
    absent. I think we were meant to infer that he had already gone off to war. Certainly
    that is the import of the third picture, in which the Kapisko parents are shown
    filling rusty farmyard pails with their tears. I could almost taste the salt of
    their sobbing, as they waited for the wheat.

    Picture four was missing, it had been torn out, you could still see the ghost
    shade of its adhesive. Some brute or vandal had scribbled over the fifth picture
    with an indelible black marker pen, and the sixth had been chewed by squirrels.
    So it was always a joy to look at the seventh, in which we see Tadeusz Kapisko
    with his ears of wheat at last, returned from the trenches minus one eye, leaning
    against the shed in which all the rusty farmyard pails full of his parents'' tears
    are kept. He is smoking a cheroot and looks the spit and image of Josef Starling,
    though his hair has been painted in cerulean blue with flecks of orpiment which
    may be accidental.

    The eighth picture is like a child''s drawing. It shows the helicopters on the
    helipad, the burning cities, and the pit of doom, making the next picture all
    the more alluring, the delightful wash of colours showing meadows dotted with
    teasel, spurge, gentians, camellias, columbine, bedstraw and edelweiss, honeysuckle,
    lupins and phlox. And hollyhocks, hollyhocks.

    "Oooh, mama! Papa!" I used to pipe, as I turned to picture number ten, "Where
    are Tadeusz Kapisko''s ears of wheat?" And my parents would always smile conspiratorially
    and place their fingers over their mouths, and I adored the anticipation of seeing
    the eleventh and last picture, all crimson and cerulean blue and orpiment, King''s
    yellow, the frying pan and the hunchback, the countless pigs wallowing in their
    muck, the detective with his buttons and the unshelled peas still snug in their
    pods, the glockenspiel and the fire extinguisher, the tiny glittering ships afloat
    on the soaking wet sea, and there, if you looked ever so closely, on the poop
    deck of the tiniest ship of all, triumphant in his galoshes, with his ears of
    wheat, Tadeusz Kapisko, brave and strong!'
