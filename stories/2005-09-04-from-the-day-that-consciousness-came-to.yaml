  text: '"From the day that consciousness came to me in this world I have been miserable...
    Too well do I know what it is to feel the burning and jagged links of the devil''s
    chain cutting through my quivering flesh to the shrinking bone--to feel my nerves
    tremble with agony, and my brain burn as if bathed in liquids of fire--too well,
    I say, do I know what these things are, for I have felt them intensified again
    and again, ten thousand times." -- Luther Benson, Fifteen Years In Hell'
