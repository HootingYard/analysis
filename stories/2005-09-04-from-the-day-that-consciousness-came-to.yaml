  text: "\u201CFrom the day that consciousness came to me in this world I have been\
    \ miserable\u2026 Too well do I know what it is to feel the burning and jagged\
    \ links of the devil's chain cutting through my quivering flesh to the shrinking\
    \ bone\u2014to feel my nerves tremble with agony, and my brain burn as if bathed\
    \ in liquids of fire\u2014too well, I say, do I know what these things are, for\
    \ I have felt them intensified again and again, ten thousand times.\u201D \u2014\
    \ Luther Benson, Fifteen Years In Hell"
