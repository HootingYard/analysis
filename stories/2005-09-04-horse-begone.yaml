  text: "I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still.\n\u201CDa doo ron ron, horse\
    \ begone!\u201D she cried. It was an incantation, in a field, and sure enough,\
    \ the horse to whom she addressed these words turned and cantered away, until\
    \ it could no longer be seen in the mist and the drizzle.\nSomebody told me that\
    \ her name was Jill, but before I could ask her, she was casting her spells again.\n\
    \u201CHoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!\u201D she yelled, at a cow, but this time\
    \ without the desired effect. The cow just stared back at her, chewing its cud,\
    \ the way cows do.\n\u201CHoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!\u201D she repeated, a\
    \ little desperately, I thought. If I'd been the cow, I would have sensed a moment\
    \ of panic, of confidence drained. Jill\u2014if Jill was her name\u2014repeated\
    \ her incantation too soon. The cow did not move.\nSo I took the opportunity to\
    \ stride purposefully across the field in my creaking black boots until I was\
    \ face to face with her.\n\u201CSomebody told me that your name is Jill,\u201D\
    \ I said, essaying a bow as if I were some sort of Regency fop.\n\u201CMy name\
    \ is not Jill,\u201D she hissed, \u201CI am the Woohoohoodiwoodadooronron Woman.\
    \ Fop begone!\u201D and I found myself propelled by some eldritch force into a\
    \ weird netherworld where I languish to this day, my only companion the horse.\
    \ There is no sign of the cow."
