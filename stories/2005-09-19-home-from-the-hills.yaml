  text: 'Hooting Yard is back again after a fortnight''s break. During this time your
    editor has been engaged in exciting discussions with Hollywood moguls about a
    new television series. Zeigler And Locke will be a spin-off from two existing
    shows, featuring Toby Zeigler from The West Wing and Mr Locke from Lost. No one
    seemed to know what to do with the partnership. Should they be crusaders against
    evil, like Batman and Superman? Arch-rivals perhaps? Or just buddies on a pointless
    road trip?

    I am not sure why I was called in as a consultant. I messed around with a few
    templates--Steptoe and Son, Boswell and Johnson, Cagney and Lacey--but my parting
    advice, before coming home from the hills, was that Zeigler and Locke would work
    best by having the two protagonists as argumentative ornithologists roaming the
    hills and fields of a distant country, never agreeing on the identification of
    the various birds they spot. In each hour-long episode they would come upon one
    bird, and the conceit would be that every single time neither of them would be
    correct. In my pilot episode, what Zeigler argues is a peewit, and Locke insists
    is a moorhen, turns out to be a grebe.
