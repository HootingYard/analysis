  text: "Hooting Yard is back again after a fortnight's break. During this time your\
    \ editor has been engaged in exciting discussions with Hollywood moguls about\
    \ a new television series. Zeigler And Locke will be a spin-off from two existing\
    \ shows, featuring Toby Zeigler from The West Wing and Mr Locke from Lost. No\
    \ one seemed to know what to do with the partnership. Should they be crusaders\
    \ against evil, like Batman and Superman? Arch-rivals perhaps? Or just buddies\
    \ on a pointless road trip?\nI am not sure why I was called in as a consultant.\
    \ I messed around with a few templates\u2014Steptoe and Son, Boswell and Johnson,\
    \ Cagney and Lacey\u2014but my parting advice, before coming home from the hills,\
    \ was that Zeigler and Locke would work best by having the two protagonists as\
    \ argumentative ornithologists roaming the hills and fields of a distant country,\
    \ never agreeing on the identification of the various birds they spot. In each\
    \ hour-long episode they would come upon one bird, and the conceit would be that\
    \ every single time neither of them would be correct. In my pilot episode, what\
    \ Zeigler argues is a peewit, and Locke insists is a moorhen, turns out to be\
    \ a grebe.\n\nLeft to right : Toby Zeigler, Mr Locke, a grebe"
