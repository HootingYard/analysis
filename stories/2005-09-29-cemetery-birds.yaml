  text: "In Tantarabim, the lopwit is known as the Cemetery Bird. By law, all graveyards\
    \ in that land are situated at the seaside, so one might expect gulls or guillemots\
    \ or other seabirds to be most associated with the tombstones. Yet it is the lopwit,\
    \ small, tufted, brightly-coloured, that is invoked in the funeral practices of\
    \ the people of Tantarabim. Why?\nAs so often, we can turn to the out-of-print\
    \ pamphleteer Dobson to help us answer this question. It is true that, throughout\
    \ his copious writings, he never addressed the subject directly. True, too, that\
    \ his knowledge of ornithology was paltry and lamentable, and more often than\
    \ not wholly inaccurate. With Dobson, it is a case of knowing where to look. We\
    \ will not find a pamphlet called Why They Call The Lopwit The Cemetery Bird In\
    \ Tantarabim, but now, with the long overdue publication of Aloysius Nestingbird's\
    \ Mighty Concordance Dobsoniana, we know that the answer to the question can be\
    \ pieced together from a number of sources. There is that impertinent little footnote\
    \ in An Essay About Bowls, Dishes And Pots. There is a majestic, sweeping paragraph\
    \ in A Pamphlet Of Majestic Sweeping Paragraphs. There is a ham-fisted pencil\
    \ drawing in the appendix to Why I Smashed My Copy Of \u201CThick As A Brick\u201D\
    \ By Jethro Tull Into Twenty Thousand Pieces With A Geological Hammer And Then\
    \ Glued It Back Together Again. And, of course, there are the famous lines hidden\
    \ away in Dobson's so-called \xDCberpamphlet, in which he writes:\n\u201CLopwits\
    \ flock to the seaside cemeteries of Tantarabim in search of spurge and sukebind.\
    \ They munch these plants greedily, if one can use the word munch to describe\
    \ the way they tear savagely at the foliage with their beaks and swallow each\
    \ beakful whole, having no teeth, for I can now reveal that, in common with other\
    \ birds, lopwits are innocent of teeth. Would that I could say the same of myself.\u201D\
    \nCommentators have long been amused at Dobson's presumption in claiming to be\
    \ the first person in history to point out that birds do not have teeth. Less\
    \ remarked is the fact that he is completely wrong about the lopwits' diet. These\
    \ birds\u2014which are small, tufted, and brightly-coloured, as we have seen\u2014\
    eat neither spurge nor sukebind. If they did so, they would surely die of poisoning,\
    \ for they do not produce the enzymes necessary to break down and digest these\
    \ particular plants. You can look that up in the most basic encyclopaedia of avian\
    \ digestive systems. Who knows why Dobson could not be bothered to do so?\n\n\
    The propellers on the aeroplanes in the airfield across the road are making a\
    \ terrible racket and I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I think I will\
    \ cram some cotton wool into my ears.\n\nDobson would often bang on about his\
    \ devotion to research. It made him something of a trying companion, for it was\
    \ not beyond him to regale a tavern's worth of peasants with a harangue. \u201C\
    Do you people realise,\u201D he might shout, apropos of nothing, \u201CThat before\
    \ writing my pamphlet entitled Notes On A Shelf Of Test Tubes Containing The Blood\
    \ Of Squirrels I read fourteen different encyclopaedias from cover to cover, together\
    \ with the collected works of Emily Dickinson, T Lobsang Rampa, and Harold Pinter?\u201D\
    \ Of course, in remarks such as these\u2014which have been reported to us by Marigold\
    \ Chew and others\u2014Dobson unwittingly makes clear that his understanding of\
    \ \u201Cresearch\u201D is, to put it kindly, somewhat witless. If he genuinely\
    \ intended to say anything meaningful about the blood of squirrels, what perverse\
    \ impulse would make him think he could find any useful material in, say, the\
    \ works of a grumpy bespectacled north London misanthrope? And yet this was always\
    \ the way he worked, with his magpie mind, to the despair of some and the delight\
    \ of others. That is why this new Concordance will prove such a boon to scholars.\
    \ If you want to know what Dobson had to say about the cemetery birds of Tantarabim,\
    \ there is no point looking in any of the eighty-nine pamphlets which mention\
    \ birds in the title, nor in either of the two monographs on Tantarabim-related\
    \ topics which Dobson wrote while holed up in that milk of magnesia warehouse\
    \ in Winnipeg. Similarly, should you want to discover what the great pamphleteer\
    \ had to say about obsolete punctuation marks, it may come as some surprise to\
    \ find that there are at least twenty pages of pertinent remarks in the virtually\
    \ forgotten early pamphlet Observations On Cows From A Great Distance, In The\
    \ Rain.\nSpeaking of cows, it is worth mentioning here that in addition to the\
    \ seaside cemeteries with their allotted lopwits, there was, in old Tantarabim,\
    \ a single inland cemetery, far from the sea, known as the Graveyard of Cows.\
    \ On this occasion we need not consult Dobson, for the story is well known. Cows\
    \ grazed in the Graveyard of Cows, to keep down the grass, and when they died,\
    \ the same cows were buried there. The mezzotintist and amateur historian of Tantarabim,\
    \ Rex Tint, unearthed a mezzotint which showed the big signboard which stood at\
    \ the graveyard gates, and translated the notice engraved thereon:\n\u201CHey\
    \ there, passer-by in the day or night, stop now! Rest your weary legs and know\
    \ that ye stand at the gates of the Graveyard of Cows. This plot of land was given\
    \ in perpetuity to cows alive and cows dead by order of the Grand Plenipotentiary\
    \ Vizier of Old Tantarabim according to visions which beset him as he knelt in\
    \ his hanging gardens pruning his laburnums. No laburnums must grow in the grounds\
    \ of the Graveyard of Cows, nor cinquefoil, nor rhubarb, nor lupins. Nay, thou\
    \ shalt find in this field only towering hollyhocks among the grass, and cows\
    \ feeding upon the grass, and the cows shall feed upon the grass among the hollyhocks\
    \ of these fields until such time as they perish. And each time a graveyard cow\
    \ leaves this mortal world, six villagers shall come unto here and use big spades\
    \ to dig for that cow a grave beneath the grass. Two villagers shall be named\
    \ Ned. Two shall be blind. One shall wear the hat of Boohoocha. And one shall\
    \ be a puny person. And they shall dig the grave for the cow in the night time,\
    \ under a black and starless sky, and bury the cow by morning. Now move on, traveller,\
    \ wherever you are bound, but remember always the cows of Tantarabim as long as\
    \ you ever shall live.\u201D"
