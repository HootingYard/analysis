  text: '"What do we now see? Midnight!--the blackness of darkness!--Nothing! Where
    is the wall we were lately elbowing out of the way? It has vanished!--It is lost!
    We are walled in by darkness, and darkness canopies us above. Look again;--Swing
    your torches aloft! Aye, now you can see it; far up, a hundred feet above your
    head, a grey ceiling rolling dimly away like a cloud, and heavy buttresses, bending
    under the weight, curling and toppling over their base, begin to project their
    enormous masses from the shadowy wall. How vast! How solemn! How awful! The little
    bells of the brain are ringing in your ears; you hear nothing else--not even a
    sigh of air." -- Alexander Clark Bullitt, Rambles In The Mammoth Cave During The
    Year 1844'
