  text: "\u201CWhat do we now see? Midnight!\u2014the blackness of darkness!\u2014\
    Nothing! Where is the wall we were lately elbowing out of the way? It has vanished!\u2014\
    It is lost! We are walled in by darkness, and darkness canopies us above. Look\
    \ again;\u2014Swing your torches aloft! Aye, now you can see it; far up, a hundred\
    \ feet above your head, a grey ceiling rolling dimly away like a cloud, and heavy\
    \ buttresses, bending under the weight, curling and toppling over their base,\
    \ begin to project their enormous masses from the shadowy wall. How vast! How\
    \ solemn! How awful! The little bells of the brain are ringing in your ears; you\
    \ hear nothing else\u2014not even a sigh of air.\u201D \u2014 Alexander Clark\
    \ Bullitt, Rambles In The Mammoth Cave During The Year 1844"
