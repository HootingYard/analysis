  text: 'The publishing world is agog, or so I''m told, at the news that legendary
    poet Dennis Beerpint has written a new work. O Little Earthenware Jug is a deceptively
    deceptive poem, a bit too long for some critics, and "too bloody short" according
    to the anonymous writer on the Beerpintblog. I wanted to be able to include an
    extract here, but permission was not granted. Instead, here is the correspondence:

    Dear Agent For The Poet Dennis Beerpint : I would like to include an extract from
    Dennis Beerpint''s new poem, O Little Earthenware Jug, on my website. Please email
    me the text as a matter of urgency. Regards, Frank Key

    Dear Frank Key : The poet Dennis Beerpint is neurasthenic, rake-thin, and a bed-wetter.
    He has been off his food for days, and is subsisting on radishes and diluted tap
    water. Every time I try to discuss O Little Earthenware Jug with him, he bursts
    into tears, rends his blankets, and takes on the appearance of a frightened weasel.
    That Salman Rushdie person came round the other day, and Dennis threw things at
    him from the top of the stairs--pieces of cardboard, ping pong balls, a scrunched-up
    map of the local Tesco''s car park, all sorts. I tried to get him to see a doctor--Dennis,
    that is, not Mr Rushdie--but he locked himself in his room and started bashing
    out ungodly songs on his Moog synthesiser. Incidentally, Dennis is one of the
    few people who pronounces it correctly, as Mogue, to rhyme with Kylie Minogue.
    In any event, at the moment it''s simply out of the question for you or anybody
    to wrest even a single line of the poem from this troubled genius--Dennis, that
    is, not Mr Rushdie or Mr Moog. In any case, Mr Moog died a little while ago. Yours
    sincerely, Kwoon Lip Park, Agent For The Poet Dennis Beerpint

    Dear Kwoon Lip Park : Couldn''t you just sneak into his room while he''s not looking
    and pinch a copy of O Little Earthenware Jug off his desk? Regards, Frank Key

    Dear Frank : No I could not, for I am spineless. Kwoon'
