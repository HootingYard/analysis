  text: "They're small, green, solid, edible spheres, and you eke them from pods.\
    \ I am talking about peas, of course! Let us sing their praises:\nAt the dinner\
    \ tables of Hooting Yard / There's a food we hold in high regard / Oh I wonder\
    \ what can it be? / It's the little green edible sphere called the pea!\nThe shelling\
    \ of peas has long been recognised as a therapeutic activity on a par with pig\
    \ observation. Some doctors of the brain recommend that neurasthenic patients\
    \ should spend an hour each day shelling peas and another hour leaning over the\
    \ fence of a sty watching pigs. The experimental psychiatrist Tarpin Paltrow suggested\
    \ doing both at the same time, with results that have been hotly debated ever\
    \ since.\nIt was Paltrow's student P K Spaceman who coined the term PQ, for pea\
    \ quotient. Your PQ is easily calculated. Take the number of peas you have eaten\
    \ in your lifetime, and divide it by your age. This figure can be plotted on a\
    \ grid against, for example, your body mass index, rotundity of head, shoe size,\
    \ and various phrenological data. Dr Spaceman was fond of citing Lloyd George's\
    \ view that Neville Chamberlain had \u201Ca wrong-shaped head\u201D and put this\
    \ down to a lack of peas in the latter's diet. Sometimes he attributed it to a\
    \ lack of peas in the former's diet, too.\nIn desperate circumstances, for example\
    \ when one's life is at risk, peas can become useful tools, or at least adjuncts\
    \ to tools. There is the story of the Antarctic explorer, clinging by his frostbitten\
    \ fingertips to the edge of a crevasse down which he was about to plunge, who\
    \ managed to clamber up on to the ice by fashioning a harness using ribbons, elastic\
    \ bands and frozen peas.\n\nThe out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson once planned to\
    \ write an Encyclopaedia Of Pea Varieties And Pea Recipes, but he abandoned the\
    \ project after cracking his shin bone on a metal drum. The drum had been left\
    \ directly outside his front door by a peripatetic person who ought to have been\
    \ shelling peas and observing pigs, for this person could say, as Stanley Baldwin\
    \ did, \u201CMy inside is a mess of cold rumbling fluidity. My brain is costive.\
    \ Faith is dying. Hope is dead\u201D. So miserable was this travelling drum person\
    \ that he could no longer bear to carry his drum from place to place, and so with\
    \ a sigh like a dying wind he unhitched it from his back and placed it in Dobson's\
    \ driveway. Then he rolled it as far as the front door, and scribbled a note on\
    \ the wrapper of a toffee apple, weighted the note on the drum with a pebble,\
    \ and trudged away to begin his life anew as the Man of Bandages. You might be\
    \ wondering what the note said. It was simple enough.\n\u201CI can no longer carry\
    \ my metal drum from place to place. Keep it or discard it, I care not a jot.\u201D\
    \nAs we have seen, upon discovering the drum, Dobson's first act was neither to\
    \ keep nor to discard it, but to bang his leg against it with such force that\
    \ he almost broke the bone of the shin of his right leg.\nWhy did Dobson's leg\
    \ meet the cold hard edge of the metal drum with such force?\nBecause Dobson was\
    \ charging out of his house at high speed\u2014so fast that he would have appeared\
    \ to any passer by as a mere blur, like the comic book character Billy Whizz.\n\
    Dobson was normally slow and even lumbering of gait. On what account was he in\
    \ such a hurry?\nAlways a man with an eye for a bargain, Dobson had just received\
    \ a message on his metal tapping machine telling him that in a marquee tent pitched\
    \ in a field beyond Pang Hill, a mountebank was selling many peas at prices that\
    \ were described as \u201Cinsane\u201D. Given that he was thinking hard about\
    \ his planned pea book, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss. Hence the\
    \ way in which he jumped up from his escritoire, sending his chair clattering\
    \ behind him, kicked off his toofles with vim, enwrapped himself in his big black\
    \ coat, stuck his feet into a pair of Canadian Forestry Service boots, and whizzed\
    \ out of his front door. His momentum was at this point brought to a shocking\
    \ halt by the unexpected metal drum blocking his path. Making contact with it,\
    \ Dobson howled. Many people in the vicinity said later that they thought what\
    \ they heard was a dog being clubbed by a brute, a la Bill Sykes in Oliver Twist,\
    \ as played by the late Oliver Reed in the film version of Lionel Bart's musical\
    \ Oliver! Persistent rumours that Bart intended to follow this with a setting\
    \ of another Victorian literary gem, Gerard Manley Hopkins' poem The Wreck Of\
    \ The Deutschland, entitled The Tall Nun!, are unfounded.\n\nDid Dobson read the\
    \ note left by the peripatetic person who had abandoned the metal drum?\nNo he\
    \ did not. Nor, once his shin wound was anointed with unguents and wrapped in\
    \ a bandage, did he go to the marquee tent in the field to buy peas from a mountebank\
    \ at \u201Cinsane\u201D prices. Had he done so, he would have discovered that\
    \ the insanity of the prices lay not in their cheapness but, conversely, in the\
    \ fact that each individual pea was on sale for a sum so staggeringly expensive\
    \ that it beggared belief. Many historians of the social scene have pondered the\
    \ motives of the mountebank, who was not trying to pretend there was anything\
    \ special about the peas he had for sale. Indeed, his patter, if we can call it\
    \ that, consisted of the repeated phrase \u201CCome hither and buy yourself a\
    \ pea at an insanely expensive price, townspeople!\u201D, shouted in an accent\
    \ difficult to pin down, and shouted repeatedly throughout the long afternoon\
    \ as clouds scudded across the sky and birds sang, and the planets span in space\
    \ millions of miles away.\nPeas have been compared with planets, sometimes, by\
    \ poets. The author of the song we heard at the beginning of this piece wrote\
    \ other pea-related verses, in one of which he takes each planet in turn\u2014\
    using the mnemonic \u201Cmud, vinegar, ectoplasm, moorhens, jasper, straubenzee,\
    \ unspeakable, Nixon, popinjay\u201D \u2014 and contemplates them as peas in a\
    \ pod, not yet shelled by one of Dr Spaceman's wild-eyed brain-sick patients.\
    \ There is no mention of pigs in the poem. Make of that what you will."
