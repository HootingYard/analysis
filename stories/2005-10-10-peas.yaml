  text: 'They''re small, green, solid, edible spheres, and you eke them from pods.
    I am talking about peas, of course! Let us sing their praises:

    At the dinner tables of Hooting Yard / There''s a food we hold in high regard
    / Oh I wonder what can it be? / It''s the little green edible sphere called the
    pea!

    The shelling of peas has long been recognised as a therapeutic activity on a par
    with pig observation. Some doctors of the brain recommend that neurasthenic patients
    should spend an hour each day shelling peas and another hour leaning over the
    fence of a sty watching pigs. The experimental psychiatrist Tarpin Paltrow suggested
    doing both at the same time, with results that have been hotly debated ever since.

    It was Paltrow''s student P K Spaceman who coined the term PQ, for pea quotient.
    Your PQ is easily calculated. Take the number of peas you have eaten in your lifetime,
    and divide it by your age. This figure can be plotted on a grid against, for example,
    your body mass index, rotundity of head, shoe size, and various phrenological
    data. Dr Spaceman was fond of citing Lloyd George''s view that Neville Chamberlain
    had "a wrong-shaped head" and put this down to a lack of peas in the latter''s
    diet. Sometimes he attributed it to a lack of peas in the former''s diet, too.

    In desperate circumstances, for example when one''s life is at risk, peas can
    become useful tools, or at least adjuncts to tools. There is the story of the
    Antarctic explorer, clinging by his frostbitten fingertips to the edge of a crevasse
    down which he was about to plunge, who managed to clamber up on to the ice by
    fashioning a harness using ribbons, elastic bands and frozen peas.


    The out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson once planned to write an Encyclopaedia Of
    Pea Varieties And Pea Recipes, but he abandoned the project after cracking his
    shin bone on a metal drum. The drum had been left directly outside his front door
    by a peripatetic person who ought to have been shelling peas and observing pigs,
    for this person could say, as Stanley Baldwin did, "My inside is a mess of cold
    rumbling fluidity. My brain is costive. Faith is dying. Hope is dead". So miserable
    was this travelling drum person that he could no longer bear to carry his drum
    from place to place, and so with a sigh like a dying wind he unhitched it from
    his back and placed it in Dobson''s driveway. Then he rolled it as far as the
    front door, and scribbled a note on the wrapper of a toffee apple, weighted the
    note on the drum with a pebble, and trudged away to begin his life anew as the
    Man of Bandages. You might be wondering what the note said. It was simple enough.

    "I can no longer carry my metal drum from place to place. Keep it or discard it,
    I care not a jot."

    As we have seen, upon discovering the drum, Dobson''s first act was neither to
    keep nor to discard it, but to bang his leg against it with such force that he
    almost broke the bone of the shin of his right leg.

    Why did Dobson''s leg meet the cold hard edge of the metal drum with such force?

    Because Dobson was charging out of his house at high speed--so fast that he would
    have appeared to any passer by as a mere blur, like the comic book character Billy
    Whizz.

    Dobson was normally slow and even lumbering of gait. On what account was he in
    such a hurry?

    Always a man with an eye for a bargain, Dobson had just received a message on
    his metal tapping machine telling him that in a marquee tent pitched in a field
    beyond Pang Hill, a mountebank was selling many peas at prices that were described
    as "insane". Given that he was thinking hard about his planned pea book, this
    seemed an opportunity too good to miss. Hence the way in which he jumped up from
    his escritoire, sending his chair clattering behind him, kicked off his toofles
    with vim, enwrapped himself in his big black coat, stuck his feet into a pair
    of Canadian Forestry Service boots, and whizzed out of his front door. His momentum
    was at this point brought to a shocking halt by the unexpected metal drum blocking
    his path. Making contact with it, Dobson howled. Many people in the vicinity said
    later that they thought what they heard was a dog being clubbed by a brute, a
    la Bill Sykes in Oliver Twist, as played by the late Oliver Reed in the film version
    of Lionel Bart''s musical Oliver! Persistent rumours that Bart intended to follow
    this with a setting of another Victorian literary gem, Gerard Manley Hopkins''
    poem The Wreck Of The Deutschland, entitled The Tall Nun!, are unfounded.


    Did Dobson read the note left by the peripatetic person who had abandoned the
    metal drum?

    No he did not. Nor, once his shin wound was anointed with unguents and wrapped
    in a bandage, did he go to the marquee tent in the field to buy peas from a mountebank
    at "insane" prices. Had he done so, he would have discovered that the insanity
    of the prices lay not in their cheapness but, conversely, in the fact that each
    individual pea was on sale for a sum so staggeringly expensive that it beggared
    belief. Many historians of the social scene have pondered the motives of the mountebank,
    who was not trying to pretend there was anything special about the peas he had
    for sale. Indeed, his patter, if we can call it that, consisted of the repeated
    phrase "Come hither and buy yourself a pea at an insanely expensive price, townspeople!",
    shouted in an accent difficult to pin down, and shouted repeatedly throughout
    the long afternoon as clouds scudded across the sky and birds sang, and the planets
    span in space millions of miles away.

    Peas have been compared with planets, sometimes, by poets. The author of the song
    we heard at the beginning of this piece wrote other pea-related verses, in one
    of which he takes each planet in turn--using the mnemonic "mud, vinegar, ectoplasm,
    moorhens, jasper, straubenzee, unspeakable, Nixon, popinjay" -- and contemplates
    them as peas in a pod, not yet shelled by one of Dr Spaceman''s wild-eyed brain-sick
    patients. There is no mention of pigs in the poem. Make of that what you will.'
