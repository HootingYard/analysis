  text: "\u201CThe conditions of life in the sixteenth century made it difficult to\
    \ draw a veil over the less pleasant side of human existence. The houses were\
    \ filthy; the streets so disgusting that on days when there was no wind to disperse\
    \ the mephitic vapours, prudent people kept their windows shut. Dead bodies and\
    \ lacerated limbs must have been frequent sights. Under these circumstances we\
    \ need not be surprised that men spoke more plainly to one another and even to\
    \ women than they do now. Sir John Paston's conversations with the Duchess of\
    \ Norfolk would make less than duchesses blush now.\u201D \u2014 P S Allen, The\
    \ Age Of Erasmus"
