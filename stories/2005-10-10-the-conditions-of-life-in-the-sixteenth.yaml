  text: '"The conditions of life in the sixteenth century made it difficult to draw
    a veil over the less pleasant side of human existence. The houses were filthy;
    the streets so disgusting that on days when there was no wind to disperse the
    mephitic vapours, prudent people kept their windows shut. Dead bodies and lacerated
    limbs must have been frequent sights. Under these circumstances we need not be
    surprised that men spoke more plainly to one another and even to women than they
    do now. Sir John Paston''s conversations with the Duchess of Norfolk would make
    less than duchesses blush now." -- P S Allen, The Age Of Erasmus'
