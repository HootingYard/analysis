  text: "\u201CIf you wish to become weak-headed, nervous, and good for nothing, read\
    \ novels. I have seen an account of a young lady, who had become so nervous and\
    \ excitable, in consequence of reading novels, that her head would be turned by\
    \ the least appearance of danger, real or imaginary. As she was riding in a carriage\
    \ over a bridge, in company with her mother and sister, she became frightened\
    \ at some fancied danger, caught hold of the reins, and backed the carriage off\
    \ the bridge, down a precipice, dashing them to pieces.\u201D \u2014 An American\
    \ Woman, The Ladies' Vase"
