  text: 'Some readers will be familiar with the career of the Sino-Dutch artist Ah-Fang
    Van Der Houygendorp, the man who invented potato-peel engravure. Few people know,
    however, that he was a keen mountaineer. Keen and inept, that is. Ah-Fang was,
    if nothing else, a visionary, and he had visions of a haunted mountain, its peak
    shrouded in inexplicable purple mists like something out of a novel by M P Shiel.
    Whenever he sat shivering in his tent at base camp, Ah-Fang wondered if this mountain,
    the one he was about to climb, was the haunted mountain of his mind''s eye. He
    would poke his head out of the frayed flap of his tent, peer up at the majestic
    rock formation disappearing into the clouds above, and wonder if this, at last,
    would be the one he had dreamed of since childhood, where he would come face to
    face with the uncanny, the ineffable.

    Physically, Ah-Fang was not really cut out for mountaineering. He was described
    by a contemporary as "a figure of untold puniness", and he was indeed tiny and
    weak, short-sighted, lanky and prone to swooning fits. He was terrified of gnats,
    horseflies and fruitbats. He had an oversensitive digestive system and had to
    subsist mostly on thin soup or broth. It was difficult to find a mountaineering
    team willing to recruit so wretched a specimen, so Ah-Fang did most of his clambering
    up sheer rock faces solo, a man alone testing himself against the elements.

    What he lacked in physical prowess, Ah-Fang made up for with a genius for publicity.
    Each time he descended from some pitiless escarpment, battered, bruised, hallucinating
    and in the last stages of exhaustion, the puny alpinist would hold a press conference.
    At one of these, in 1929, he was questioned closely by Dobson. No one is quite
    sure what in heaven''s name Dobson was doing hanging about in the foothills of
    the Giant Terrifying Mountains of Tantarabim at the time. We know from the journals
    of Marigold Chew that Dobson was at work on a series of pamphlets about glue,
    breadcrumbs and the composer William Hurlstone (1876-1906), whose Bassoon Sonata
    made him weep, and that he collected the tears in what he called his "Hurlstone
    bucket". It is beyond doubt, however, that Dobson bustled through the entrance
    flap of Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp''s tent within minutes of the mountaineer''s
    return from the jagged heights of Giant Terrifying Mountain Number Eight, the
    most challenging of the peaks in the Tantarabim range. The transcript of their
    conversation has been preserved.


    William Hurlstone

    Ah-Fang : Welcome to my press conference.

    Dobson : With all due respect, you look very puny for a mountaineer.

    Ah-Fang : I have seen things, up in yon mists and clouds, that no human being
    has ever seen. I want you to tell the world.

    Dobson : The lenses of your spectacles are extremely thick, and what I know of
    the ocular sciences would suggest to me that you are myopic. Added to which, they
    are steamed up. Your claim to have seen anything at all, let alone something of
    great import, is, frankly, somewhat dubious.

    Ah-Fang : Frankly dubious it may well be, O person with notebook and pencil, but
    I know whereof I speak, for I was upon that mighty peak engulfed in mists, and
    you were not.

    Dobson : That''s true enough. An hour ago I was sitting in one of the huts in
    these foothills eating porridge. I fled the hut when I saw three bears approaching.
    I did not know bears roamed these foothills. Were there more bears up on the mountain?

    Ah-Fang : Yes, there were bears up there, and there were other things beginning
    with B.

    Dobson : What were those things beginning with B?

    Ah-Fang : I could prattle a list of nouns beginning with B, pamphlet person, and
    you would scuttle away happy, but of greater import is the sort of general mental
    impression I gained within the mist, an impression which impinged upon my brain
    in a manner that can only be described as uncanny and redoubtable. For I have
    witnessed that which I knew from infancy awaited me. Even as a tiny tot I was
    aware that in some broiling high altitude mist I would come upon the elixir of
    glory.

    Dobson : Let me stop you there, puny mountaineer. I need to sharpen my pencil.
    Do you have a pencil sharpener?

    Ah-Fang : Let me look in my voluminous kitbag.

    Dobson : Thank you. While you rummage, I am going to hike up the mountain myself,
    to add credence to your witterings.

    The transcript ends there. For the rest of his life, Dobson never spoke of what
    he found at the top of that mystic and magical mountain. If asked, he would stare
    balefully into the distance, as if entranced. But he did write an account of what
    he found when he returned to Ah-Fang''s base camp. It appears as a lengthy footnote
    in his out-of-print pamphlet He Who Plucks The Strings Of A Banjo In Wintry, Wintry
    Weather.

    "When I descended from Giant Terrifying Mountain Number Eight," he wrote, "I expected
    to find puny alpinist Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp awaiting me with a pencil sharpener
    in his frostbitten hand. I even thought he may have sharpened my pencil for me
    in my absence, as an act of beneficence. I was in a reflective mood, whistling
    William Hurlstone''s Snow White''s Death-Sleep, from The Magic Mirror, as I trudged
    towards the tent. There were grim, huge-winged birds circling overhead, and I
    gripped harder the piece of putty in my pocket. Bustling through the flap, as
    I always bustle through tent-flaps, I found no trace of Ah-Fang, nor of my pencil.
    The man had vanished with his kitbag, his pencil sharpener, and, I adduced, he
    had acted like a common thief by taking my pencil with him. I had lost track of
    time up on the mountain, so I could not guess how long he had been gone. I wondered
    if, puny as he was, he had been waylaid by the bears who roam those ill-starred
    foothills, and I half expected to find a pile of chewed bones as I made my sad
    way to the railway station along the luminous painted footpaths. But I saw no
    bones, no bears, nothing at all beginning with B, in all the hours it took me
    to plod away from that weird, unwelcoming place. I never saw Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp
    again, but a year later I learned that he was a passenger aboard the airship the
    LZ 129 Hindenburg, which exploded in flames while approaching a mooring mast at
    Lakehurst Naval Air Station in the state of New Jersey in the United States of
    America. I often find myself wondering if the stub of my pencil was aboard that
    doomed airship."
