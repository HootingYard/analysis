  text: "The Hooting Yard Treasury Of Recondite Yet Somehow Arresting Facts is currently\
    \ in preparation. After much thought, and a bowl of Mrs Gubbins' delicious soup,\
    \ we decided to use a simple question-and-answer format for this mighty undertaking.\
    \ Here is a sneak preview, especially for website readers:\nQ\u2014Ayn Rand, the\
    \ gravel-voiced amd dementedly right wing author of such pap as The Fountainhead\
    \ (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957) was, as we know, a keen collector of postage\
    \ stamps*, but what I really want to know is the title of the song played at her\
    \ funeral service in 1982. (I know that this is not phrased as a question, but\
    \ bear with me.)\nA\u2014The song played at Ayn Rand's funeral was It's A Long\
    \ Way To Tipperary.\n* NOTE : See Preposterous Authors, 4 October 2004 for further\
    \ details.\n\nAyn Rand"
