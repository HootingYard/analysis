  text: 'The Hooting Yard Treasury Of Recondite Yet Somehow Arresting Facts is currently
    in preparation. After much thought, and a bowl of Mrs Gubbins'' delicious soup,
    we decided to use a simple question-and-answer format for this mighty undertaking.
    Here is a sneak preview, especially for website readers:

    Q--Ayn Rand, the gravel-voiced amd dementedly right wing author of such pap as
    The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957) was, as we know, a keen collector
    of postage stamps*, but what I really want to know is the title of the song played
    at her funeral service in 1982. (I know that this is not phrased as a question,
    but bear with me.)

    A--The song played at Ayn Rand''s funeral was It''s A Long Way To Tipperary.

    * NOTE : See Preposterous Authors, 4 October 2004 for further details.
