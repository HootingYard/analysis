  text: '"In form and movement the woodchuck is not captivating. His body is heavy
    and flabby. Indeed, such a flaccid, fluid, pouchy carcass, I have never before
    seen. It has absolutely no muscular tension or rigidity, but is as baggy and shaky
    as a skin filled with water." -- John Burroughs, Birds And Bees, Sharp Eyes And
    Other Papers'
