  text: "\u201CIn form and movement the woodchuck is not captivating. His body is\
    \ heavy and flabby. Indeed, such a flaccid, fluid, pouchy carcass, I have never\
    \ before seen. It has absolutely no muscular tension or rigidity, but is as baggy\
    \ and shaky as a skin filled with water.\u201D \u2014 John Burroughs, Birds And\
