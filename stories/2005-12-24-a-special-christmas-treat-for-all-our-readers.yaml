  text: "Hooting Yard has been eerily quiet for the past two months, during which\
    \ time Mr Key has been plotting all sorts of exciting bagatelles for the coming\
    \ year. But to assure readers that he has not succumbed to the living death of\
    \ zombiedom, Frank is presenting as a Christmas treat the working drafts of two\
    \ episodes of an exciting new television series. The show is provisionally entitled\
    \ Blodgett And His Pals Hanging Around On A Mysterious Island After Surviving\
    \ A Plane Crash. Here is the first, which takes place somewhere around the middle\
    \ of the story. The notes for a second episode will appear tomorrow.\n\nAh-Fang\
    \ Van Der Houygendorp is covered in blood. Dobson and Marigold Chew do medical\
    \ stuff. Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp is croaking.\nMarigold Chew: \u201CWhat's\
    \ happening, Dobson?\u201D\nDobson: \u201CHis lung just collapsed.\u201D\nTense\
    \ music. Tracheotomy. Tiny Enid winces. Dobson tells Marigold Chew to go to the\
    \ beach and ransack fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's stuff for rubbing alcohol.\n\
    Flashback. Dobson is tying a bowtie on a young mystic badger named Little Severin,\
    \ who says \u201CYou can still back out, Dobson\u201D. Wedding preparations? Possibly.\n\
    Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp is still croaking and bloody. Dobson says: \u201C\
    I'm going to save you.\u201D\nDaytime on the beach. Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol,\
    \ his spectacles nowhere in sight, offers Minnie Crunlop a fish. The raft should\
    \ be ready in about a week. Old Halob offers The Grunty Man a fish. Neither Minnie\
    \ Crunlop nor The Grunty Man want fish. Marigold Chew arrives and demands all\
    \ of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's alcohol.\nDobson is stitching Ah-Fang Van\
    \ Der Houygendorp's chest up. He's still groaning. He needs a blood transfusion.\
    \ Pabstus Tack asks Dobson where Blodgett is.\nFlashback. Pre-wedding party. \u201C\
    The future Mrs Dobson\u201D makes a speech. A year ago she broke her back. (A\
    \ bit like Blodgett's sister breaking her neck as a child, though this is not\
    \ made explicit.) They said it was inoperable. \u201CBut there was Dobson. And\
    \ he promised to fix me. He's the most committed man I have ever known. I will\
    \ dance at our wedding.\u201D Dobson looks soulful.\nTiny Enid puts a twig in\
    \ Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's mouth, which is not a herbal remedy despite Dobson's\
    \ protestations. They pull him about and he makes very loud groaning noises.\n\
    Marigold Chew trips over in the forest carrying her rucksack full of alcohol.\
    \ Something is lurking in the trees. It's Minnie Crunlop, going into labour.\n\
    Marigold Chew: \u201CYou're having contractions, Minnie Crunlop!\u201D\nMinnie\
    \ Crunlop: \u201CNo I'm bloody not!\u201D\nMarigold Chew: \u201CHelp! Somebody\
    \ help!\u201D\nThe Grunty Man hears the yelling and runs into the forest. Marigold\
    \ Chew tells The Grunty Man to go and get Dobson.\nAh-Fang Van Der Houygendorp\
    \ has stopped groaning and is now quivering, in shock. Tiny Enid asks him what\
    \ blood type he is. He eventually groans, \u201CA negative\u201D. Dobson tells\
    \ Tiny Enid to go and find someone with A negative blood, and to find Mrs Gubbins\
    \ too.\nMrs Gubbins and Lothar Preen are out walking. Lothar Preen has made a\
    \ picnic for them on a secluded beach.\nPabstus Tack has been asking people about\
    \ their blood types, but nobody knows. He doesn't even know his own \u201Cbloody\
    \ blood type\u201D. Tiny Enid has found a plant with very thin, sharp needles.\
    \ Dobson says that he is a \u2018universal donor\u2019 whatever that means, and\
    \ will risk giving his blood to Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp.\nFlashback. Dobson\
    \ is playing the hotel piano. His fiancee (Matilda Spamclot) joins him for a duet\
    \ of \u2018Heart And Soul\u2019. Dobson looks soulful again.\nThe Grunty Man arrives\
    \ to get Dobson, and comes face to face with Tiny Enid. Intense looks between\
    \ them. The Grunty Man explains that Minnie Crunlop has gone into labour. Much\
    \ babbled English/Korean chatter with Tiny Enid interpreting. Dobson tells Pabstus\
    \ Tack to go and tell Marigold Chew that she has to deliver the baby.\nNight.\
    \ Minnie Crunlop's contractions have stopped. Then her waters break.\nDobson is\
    \ in a vigil over bloody Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp. He's still breathing. \u201C\
    I screwed myself up pretty bad\u201D he says. Then he starts muttering\u2026 \u201C\
    plane, hatch, plane, hatch\u2026 Blodgett said not to tell anyone about the hatch\u2026\
    \u201D Dobson: \u201CWhat hatch?\u201D\nMrs Gubbins and Lothar Preen are canoodling\
    \ chastely at their night-time picnic. Mrs Gubbins tells Lothar Preen that Ah-Fang\
    \ Van Der Houygendorp is not her brother, but her step-brother, and he is in love\
    \ with her. She has feelings for Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp, \u2018but not like\
    \ that\u2019. Mrs Gubbins wants to take things slowly with Lothar Preen.\nMinnie\
    \ Crunlop is having her baby. The Grunty Man and Pabstus Tack arrive.\nMarigold\
    \ Chew: \u201CWhere's Dobson?\u201D\nPabstus Tack: \u201CHe couldn't come. He's\
    \ pouring his own blood into Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's arm right now!\u201D\
    \nMinnie Crunlop: \u201CI was out there for a week. Some days I don't remember.\
    \ What if they did something to the baby?\u201D\nDobson and Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp.\
    \ All the blood is gathering in his leg. \u201CCompartmentalisation!\u201D\nFlashback.\
    \ Night. Dobson sitting by the hotel pool. Dad arrives. Dobson explains that Matilda\
    \ Spamclot wants them to write their own wedding vows and he just can't think\
    \ what to say. He doubts his ability to be a good husband and father.\nDad: \u201C\
    Committment is what makes you tick, Dobson. You just don't know when to let go.\u201D\
    \nDobson says he has to amputate Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's leg. \u201CThere\
    \ is no other choice.\u201D\nMinnie Crunlop is pushing, but trying not to. \u201C\
    Baby knows I was going to give it away\u2014it won't want me. Babies know.\u201D\
    \ Marigold Chew moves into inspirational, affirmative blather mode. The Grunty\
    \ Man and Pabstus Tack sit nearby being manly together.\nTiny Enid tells Dobson\
    \ he can't save Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp. Tourniquet round leg time. Dobson\
    \ and Tiny Enid stare at each other meaningfully. Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp\
    \ groans. Dobson starts crying.\nFlashback. Wedding. Dobson is lost for words\
    \ when the time comes for the exchange of self-written vows. \u201CI didn't write\
    \ any. I've been trying for a month and I couldn't. You got it all wrong. I didn't\
    \ fix you\u2014you fixed me. I love you.\u201D Tears and sobs and kisses and applause\
    \ from the assembled throng. The minister, by the way, is an elderly, chubby,\
    \ moustachioed man who may be Malaysian.\nVery quick pre-advert scene. Has Dobson\
    \ just amputated Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's leg? I'm not sure.\nDobson and\
    \ Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp having a muttered, whispered and incomprehensible\
    \ conversation. Deep emotions in play. Dobson is sobbing again.\nMinnie Crunlop\
    \ is yelling as she has her baby. Successful delivery. It's a boy.\nDobson and\
    \ Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp again. I think Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp is going\
    \ to die. Yes, he does. Last words: \u201CTell Mrs Gubbins\u2026tell Mrs Gubbins\u2026\
    \u201D\nMinnie Crunlop brings her baby to the beach. One of those scenes of everyone\
    \ looking meaningful, with moving music. Slow motion. Mrs Gubbins and Lothar Preen\
    \ return hand in hand. Dobson walks towards them in slow motion to tell them the\
    \ dreadful news. Silent, just the music. Birth and death you see, very profound.\n\
    Mrs Gubbins looking at Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's corpse and convulsing in\
    \ sobs, still only a music soundtrack. Tragic violins.\nDobson sitting on the\
    \ beach staring out to sea. Marigold Chew joins him. They look at each other in\
    \ a meaningful Marigold Chew-Dobson sort of way.\nDobson: \u201CAh-Fang Van Der\
    \ Houygendorp didn't die. He was murdered.\u201D\nMarigold Chew: \u201CWhere are\
    \ you going?\u201D\nDobson: \u201CTo find Blodgett!\u201D\nWoo-hoo!"
