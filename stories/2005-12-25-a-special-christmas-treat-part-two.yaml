  text: "Here are the notes for a second episode of the thrilling new drama Blodgett\
    \ And His Pals Hanging Around On A Mysterious Island After Surviving A Plane Crash.\
    \ The first appeared yesterday.\n\nLothar Preen is looking soulful. Mrs Gubbins\
    \ is tending Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's corpse. We shall not see those eyebrows\
    \ again. Lothar Preen is looking even more soulful. He tells Mrs Gubbins that\
    \ Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp was very brave. \u201CIf there is anything I can\
    \ do for you\u2026.\u201D he says, soulfully.\nFlashback. Lothar Preen is under\
    \ military arrest at Loopy Copse aerodrome. He is taken into a room where a female\
    \ CIA agent and a male Port of Tongs secret service agent tell him they want him\
    \ to help crack a terrorist cell in Hoon. One of the members is an old pal of\
    \ his from the Tantarabim republican guard. \u201CIt's seven years since you left\
    \ Tantarabim, and you've been travelling ever since. You're either running away\
    \ from something\u2026 or you're looking for something\u201D. Yes indeed. He is\
    \ looking for Chloris Preen, though, mysteriously, \u201Cno one ever called her\
    \ that!\u201D spits Lothar Preen, angrily. So they're all off to Hoon.\nMarigold\
    \ Chew is in the forest. She comes upon exhausted desperate Dobson.\nMarigold\
    \ Chew : \u201CCome back!\u201D\nDobson : \u201CI'm looking for Blodgett. He lied.\
    \ Why did he lie? I based my medical treatment on his lie!\u201D\nMarigold Chew\
    \ : \u201CPeople are scared and upset. They need you back.\u201D\nThe beach. Solemn\
    \ music. Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's funeral. Everyone is looking very deep\
    \ and meaningful, holding hands and comforting one another. Lothar Preen is now\
    \ looking even more soulful than before, if such a thing is possible. Dobson is\
    \ back and in charge of the arrangements. He asks Mrs Gubbins if she wants to\
    \ say anything. She looks sulky, but I think it is meant to be grief, and shakes\
    \ her head. Lothar Preen launches into a speech about what a great guy Ah-Fang\
    \ Van Der Houygendorp was, even though he didn't get to know him.\nBlodgett arrives,\
    \ still soaked in Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's blood. \u201CIt was my fault!\
    \ We found a plane! I would have gone but my leg was hurt. He was a hero.\u201D\
    \ Dobson loses it, runs over and knocks Blodgett to the ground and begins to beat\
    \ him up, shouting \u201CWhere were you? Where were you?\u201D The others pull\
    \ him away as we pause for the first advert break.\nAt this point we learn that\
    \ L'Oreal has a new product featuring \u201Clight revealing booster technology\u201D\
    .\nAs the others pull Dobson away from Blodgett, Dobson goes into some kind of\
    \ fit. Before he passes out, he screams \u201CBlodgett is hiding something\u2026\
    \ some hatch!\u201D\nFlashback. Lothar Preen is in a mosque, the imam of which\
    \ has possibly the most splendid beard in the world. After prayers, outside, Lothar\
    \ Preen \u2018runs into\u2019 his pal, whose wife apparently died in a bombing\
    \ somewhere while out shopping. They go back to the pal's flat, where he lives\
    \ with three other men, clearly an active terrorist cell. Lothar Preen removes\
    \ a listening device from their smoke alarm, and then they all talk about the\
    \ upcoming attack. (It strikes me that not one of the gang realises that their\
    \ plans must be known to the CIA if they have been bugged. They just carry on\
    \ as before.)\nMinnie Crunlop and her baby. Tiny Enid and Pabstus Tack are trying\
    \ to get her to rest. Pabstus Tack calls the baby Turniphead. Eventually Minnie\
    \ Crunlop is persuaded to go to sleep and let Pabstus Tack look after the baby.\n\
    Blood-splattered Blodgett gives Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's rucksack to Mrs\
    \ Gubbins. He sits down next to her and they stare out to sea. Blodgett says various\
    \ Blodgett-like pearls of wisdom and ends \u201CI hope you can forgive me. I'm\
    \ sorry.\u201D He walks away while Mrs Gubbins sulks\u2014sorry, grieves. Then\
    \ she goes to Lothar Preen, who is fiddling about making something with bits of\
    \ metal as usual. \u201CYou said you'd do something for me. Blodgett killed my\
    \ brother. Will you do something about that?\u201D\nMarigold Chew is trying to\
    \ normalise Dobson's blood sugar. He tries to stand up but is too wobbly. Marigold\
    \ Chew tells him she put crushed sleeping pills in his juice. He nods off.\nBlodgett\
    \ is wringing out his gore-splattered shirt. Lothar Preen arrives and asks him\
    \ how he got that scar on his torso. \u201CIt's a war wound.\u201D \u201CIt looks\
    \ more like a surgical scar.\u201D Lothar Preen wants Blodgett to take him to\
    \ the plane so he can collect what's left of the radio for parts. They set off\
    \ through the forest, Lothar Preen using his interrogation skills to winkle information\
    \ out of Blodgett as they walk, and Blodgett realising this. They arrive at the\
    \ plane.\nFlashback. Lothar Preen and his pal are playing football in a Hoon park.\
    \ Pal reveals that he is to be the \u2018martyr\u2019 in the impending terrorist\
    \ action, but he doesn't think he can go through with it. Lothar Preen with the\
    \ CIA agents. They point out that the pal has to go ahead with it so they can\
    \ arrest him and get their hands on the explosives. (They can't do anything about\
    \ it earlier for some reason I can't follow.) Lothar Preen says he's no longer\
    \ cooperating, so they threaten to arrest Chloris Preen. He changes his mind.\n\
    The baby is crying and Pabstus Tack is carrying it around trying to get it to\
    \ sleep. Joost Van Dongelbraacke sings a loud screechy soul song, but that doesn't\
    \ work.\nBlodgett and Lothar Preen at the plane. Lothar Preen salvages the radio\
    \ parts. He asks Blodgett why he lied about Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp falling\
    \ off a cliff. \u201CI made a mistake\u201D. Blodgett gives Lothar Preen the gun\
    \ he took from the Nigerian priest-cum-drug-runner. Then, without prompting, he\
    \ admits to having knocked Lothar Preen unconscious just as he was about to do\
    \ that transmitter triangulation thing a few weeks ago. Lothar Preen puts the\
    \ gun to Blodgett's head. Blodgett explains that at the time no one on the island\
    \ was thinking clearly. Lothar Preen asks him about the hatch that Ah-Fang Van\
    \ Der Houygendorp mentioned in his death-throes. Blodgett pretends he was talking\
    \ about the fore- and aft-hatches on the plane.\nFlashback. Lothar Preen is persuading\
    \ his pal to go ahead with the suicide bombing. Pal says he will if Lothar Preen\
    \ joins him, and Lothar Preen agrees.\nMrs Gubbins is looking at a photograph\
    \ of her and Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp. She goes for a walk with Lothar Preen,\
    \ who says he believes Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp's death was an accident. \u201C\
    So why did he lie?\u201D yells Mrs Gubbins.\nRaft building. The Grunty Man is\
    \ learning a few words of English. Pabstus Tack discovers that the baby is soothed\
    \ by the sound of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's grumpy voice and follows him\
    \ around.\nDobson wakes up. Marigold Chew is looking over him. It is almost like\
    \ a religious painting. She proffers him soup. But while Dobson has been asleep,\
    \ the key to the gun case has vanished! Dobson assumes Blodgett is the culprit\
    \ and struggles to his feet enraged. Lothar Preen assures him it wasn't Blodgett.\
    \ He doesn't say who it was, but we cut to the rain-lashed forest where Mrs Gubbins\
    \ is taking a gun out of the case.\nFlashback. Time for the suicide bombing. Lothar\
    \ Preen and his pal get into the truck full of explosives. They are still parked\
    \ in the warehouse. Lothar Preen reveals he is working for the CIA and tells his\
    \ pal to run away, he'll give him ten minutes before calling in the cops. The\
    \ pal is very angry. He holds his gun to Lothar Preen's head. Lothar Preen whimpers.\
    \ His pal has gone all dementedly fanatical\u2026 but at the last second turns\
    \ the gun on himself. Blam!\nMarigold Chew, Dobson and Lothar Preen are scampering\
    \ desperately through the rain trying to find Mrs Gubbins. Lothar Preen finds\
    \ her pointing the gun at Blodgett, who of course looks preternaturally calm and\
    \ Zen-like about this predicament. Marigold Chew and Dobson blunder on to the\
    \ scene. Gosh it's tense. Will she shoot? Lothar Preen launches himself at her,\
    \ knocking her to the ground as she shoots Blodgett. Is he dead? No. There is\
    \ blood pouring from a wound near his brain, but he sits up.\nBespectacled fictional\
    \ athlete Bobnit Tivol is reading the boring text of some kind of car manual to\
    \ the baby, who is fast asleep. Every time he pauses, Pabstus Tack tells him to\
    \ carry on reading. Minnie Crunlop arrives and smiles.\nNight (ie, you know the\
    \ end is near). Mrs Gubbins is sitting staring into the fire, watched by Lothar\
    \ Preen and Marigold Chew.\nFlashback. The CIA, mopping up in the warehouse, reveal\
    \ Chloris Preen's whereabouts to Lothar Preen. She's in Bodger's Spinney and they've\
    \ booked him on a flight in two hours. Because he wants to claim his pal's body\
    \ and give him a decent Muslim funeral, the CIA agree to get him on a flight next\
    \ day instead. (Aha!)\nNight still. Lothar Preen tells Blodgett he saved him from\
    \ death at Mrs Gubbins's hands because \u201CI have come to believe you may be\
    \ our best chance of surviving this place. Now take me to the hatch. No more lies,\
    \ Blodgett.\u201D\nTo be continued\u2026"
