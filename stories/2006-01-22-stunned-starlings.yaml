  text: 'Pockmarked, moustachioed, and bonkers, evil tyrant "Uncle Joe" Starling stepped
    out on to the balcony of his dacha. He sat down in his dacha deckchair and peered
    in his bonkers and evil way at a flock of stalins soaring through the blue sky
    above him. Uncle Joe liked curlews more than he liked stalins, and he had once
    ordered the firing squad for a bird-hating apparatchik who served him curlew soup
    at a ceremonial picnic lunch one summer''s afternoon. But he liked stalins well
    enough, and his lips curled into a smile as the birds vanished behind some trees
    over by the black lake. There were bones at the bottom of the black lake. Not
    only the bones of small animals which had inadvertently fallen into the lake and
    been eaten by the carnivorous fish that swam there, but the bones of the soup
    maker, whose bullet-riddled corpse Uncle Joe had had tossed into the churning
    black water by his minions.

    The chief dacha minion was Halob, father of Old Halob who became famous as the
    irascible trainer of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. Halob the minion was a wheezy,
    crumpled man, whose tunic was often stained with egg and beetroot, for these were
    his favourite foods, though he had few teeth left in his head. Halob was a perfect
    minion, for within his soul burned an indestructible love for Uncle Joe Starling,
    a love so pure that it had been celebrated in verse by national poet Igor Zoogoo,
    a verse that was proclaimed now at the marriage ceremonies of even the most feckless
    young peasant couples.

    There was a wedding taking place in a village near the dacha later today, and
    Uncle Joe had decided to attend. As he watched the flock of stalins crossing the
    sky again, flying back from whence they came, he twisted the little red pneumatic
    knob on the arm of his dacha deckchair to summon his minion. Halob arrived on
    the balcony within seconds, creaking a little.

    "Your bones creak, Halob," observed Starling, and then he cackled, "Unlike the
    bones of the soup maker which lie rotting at the bottom of the black lake!"

    Halob cackled too. He always cackled when Starling cackled. They cackled together
    often, at least four or five times a day, whenever they recalled the numberless
    victims of Uncle Joe''s firing squads. For they were cruel men, both of them,
    despite the purity of Halob''s love.

    "I have decided to perform a song at the wedding this afternoon," said Uncle Joe,
    "So get me the sheet music, Halob."

    Nodding in acknowledgement, Halob headed back inside the dacha to do as he was
    bid. He did not need to ask which sheet music to fetch for his beloved, for Starling
    only had one song in his repertoire. The song he liked to sing was "The Windmills
    Of Your Mind", made famous by Noel Harrison, son of the actor Rex Harrison. Rex
    had many wives, both real and fictional*, and though it would not be difficult
    to ascertain which of the wives was Noel''s mother, I cannot be bothered to find
    out. I can, however, tell you that Rex and Noel were watching a storm one evening
    when a bolt of lightning utterly obliterated a tree directly in front of them.
    What sort of tree it was, and whether this Act of God was related in any way to
    the Lord''s displeasure at Rex''s performance as the Pope in The Agony And The
    Ecstasy, are both important matters which require further investigation. The Hooting
    Yard Rex Harrison Research Institute is, however, understaffed at present, so
    unless a volunteer sidles up to the entrance flap of the Institute''s somewhat
    bedraggled tent in the near future, we are going to have to put this on hold.

    Now, listen carefully. On the afternoon of that country wedding when Uncle Joe
    Starling startled the feckless young peasants by striding into their reception,
    and then delighted them by singing "The Windmills Of Your Mind", his minion made
    a tape recording. Years later, on his deathbed, Halob entrusted the precious piece
    of magnetic tape to his son Old Halob, who in turn passed it on to fictional athlete
    Bobnit Tivol as a gift for coming second in a particularly close-fought five hundred
    metre sprint final. When fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol''s non-fictional belongings
    were put up for auction in an old barn in a field somewhere near where many sinister
    cows were grazing, the tape fell into the hands of the Korean dance band leader
    Park No Lip. He gave it to his daughter, who was at the time emerging as a key
    figure in the boop-boop-boohoocha scene. Her beat combo, the Stunned Starlings,
    sampled Uncle Joe''s vocals on their cover version of Rex Harrison''s son''s worldwide
    smash hit. Sadly, however, their record failed to interest anyone except their
    close-knit pals, and you will search iTunes and other online music download resources
    in vain. Let that be a lesson to you.
