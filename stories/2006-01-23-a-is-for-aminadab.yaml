  text: Like Hitler, he took seven sugars in his tea. This had caused some embarrassment
    on his first day at the House. They had to send an urchin scurrying down to the
    cellars to fetch up a fresh tub of sugar. The urchin returned empty-handed, explaining
    that the sugar larder was heavily padlocked. Blodgett was furious. His face growing
    purple, he apologised to Aminadab, rummaged in the cupboard for a stout pick-axe
    and--commanding the urchin to dog his every footstep--he thundered down the stairs
    to the cellar. Shortly afterwards, Aminadab heard the noise of a wooden door being
    smashed to pieces with a metal pick-axe. By the time he was able to drop seven
    lumps of sugar into his cup, the tea was stewed and cold. Blodgett affected not
    to notice, and busied himself with a new trap for flying insect beings.
