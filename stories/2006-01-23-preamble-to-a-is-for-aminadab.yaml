  text: 'The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet was a pamphlet about an immense duckpond, as
    opposed to an immense pamphlet about a duckpond. The text consists of twenty six
    chapters, lettered from A to Z. It was published in pamphlet form late in the
    last century, and as I am still fond of it I have decided to add it here, in serial
    form. So for the next twenty six days this spine-tingling work of duckpondiana
    will appear, chapter by chapter. I have made a few amendments to the original
    text, where it was less than felicitous, or where I could see room for improvement.

    Here is a picture of the original title page, which should be studied with due
    care.
