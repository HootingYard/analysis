  text: '"Stealing a little to one side, and crouching against the dark hangings of
    the wall, I could see him in the faint light which dimly illuminated the hall,
    and then I discovered that my surmise was correct--Neranya was quietly at work.
    Curious to learn more, and knowing that only mischief could have been inspiring
    him, I sank into a thick robe on the floor and watched him. To my great astonishment
    Neranya was tearing off with his teeth the bag which served as his outer garment."
