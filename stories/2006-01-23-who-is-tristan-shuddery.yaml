  text: "Scrutiny of the dates of recent entries will show that Hooting Yard has been\
    \ unusually, perhaps eerily, quiet of late. This is due partly to idleness, and\
    \ partly to my strenuous attempts to pitch Celebrity Big Moorhen\u2014a sort of\
    \ avian reality show\u2014to the brainless fatheads who run the television industry.\
    \ To hell with them.\nAnyway, in my absence, a Hooting Yard fan fiction website\
    \ has sprung into being. It is entitled Dobsonia and I must say it's a very impressive\
    \ piece of work, to the extent that I can hardly believe I didn't actually write\
    \ this stuff myself. But, hand on palpitating heart, I can assure readers that\
    \ the site has absolutely nothing to do with me. Go and have a read, but hurry\
    \ back, hurry back!"
