  text: 'Scrutiny of the dates of recent entries will show that Hooting Yard has been
    unusually, perhaps eerily, quiet of late. This is due partly to idleness, and
    partly to my strenuous attempts to pitch Celebrity Big Moorhen--a sort of avian
    reality show--to the brainless fatheads who run the television industry. To hell
    with them.

    Anyway, in my absence, a Hooting Yard fan fiction website has sprung into being.
    It is entitled Dobsonia and I must say it''s a very impressive piece of work,
    to the extent that I can hardly believe I didn''t actually write this stuff myself.
    But, hand on palpitating heart, I can assure readers that the site has absolutely
    nothing to do with me. Go and have a read, but hurry back, hurry back!'
