  text: 'Episode two in our daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    Blodgett had been at the House since infancy. He was dyspeptic and cruel. Like
    Madame Rousseau, he had never learned to tell the time and rarely knew what day
    of the week it was. This was surprising for a man in his position, charged as
    he was with running the lower floors of the House. His bailiwick included the
    frightening rooms on the first floor, the whole of the ground floor, the cellars
    and underground passages (except for the secret ones), and various ill-defined
    sections of the grounds, possibly including the boneyards, the engine room, and
    the pointless hut.

    The arrival of Aminadab dismayed him. He had not been told what on earth to do
    with this lopsided person, which meant he would have to seek instructions from
    Doctor Cack or one of his cronies. He could barely bring himself to speak to them,
    with their supercilious manners, spotless frock-coats, and knot-tying expertise.
    Blodgett''s blood boiled. Without bothering to tell Aminadab where he was going,
    he shoved the trap for flying insect beings back in the kitchen drawer, slammed
    the door shut behind him, and headed off for Doctor Cack''s headquarters.'
