  text: "\u201CHis commands to the labourers were substantially these: \u2018Take\
    \ your mattocks, and pick up that stone flooring; then take your basket, and fill\
    \ it with the bones of hyaenas and other creatures which you will find there.\u2019\
    \ We may fancy the ridicule wherewith ignorance might have greeted science: but\
    \ lo, the triumph of philosophy, when its mandate soon assumed a bodily shape\
    \ in bushels of bones gnawed as by wild beasts, and here and there a grinning\
    \ skull that looked like a hyaena's!\u201D \u2014 Martin Farquhar Tupper, Probabilities"
