  text: "Dobson was hopeless at identifying bones which had been gnawed by wild animals,\
    \ but that did not stop him trying. Sometimes, if he tired of leaning on a fence\
    \ watching pigs in a sty, he would go and get his big spade and dig up bones.\
    \ He had a few favourite locations, such as the perimeter fence of the zoo, and\
    \ the aerodrome, and he always came home with a sackful.\n\u201CLook!\u201D he\
    \ would shout, brandishing one of his finds at Marigold Chew, \u201CIf I am not\
    \ mistaken this is the leg bone of a weasel which has been gnawed by a pony!\u201D\
    , or \u201CLook!\u201D he might say, \u201CI'll wager this is the tibia of an\
    \ arctic hare that has been gnawed by a squirrel!\u201D He was invariably wrong.\n\
    Dobson mounted his bones on rectangular pieces of hardboard which he then hung\
    \ on the walls of what passed as his study. He added a carefully-written label\
    \ to each one, on which he inscribed the date and location on which he exhumed\
    \ it, the animal he supposed it came from, and the animal whose teeth-marks he\
    \ purported to see as evidence of gnawing. Often these striations were not teeth-marks\
    \ at all, but Dobson was adamant.\nOne wet February Friday, Dobson and Marigold\
    \ Chew received a visit from Vlasto Pismire, a man who bore an uncanny resemblance\
    \ to the meteorite-obsessed Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik. Pismire supplied\
    \ cocoa to circuses. Having heard, erroneously, that Marigold was a past queen\
    \ bee of the flying trapeze, he was hoping to sell cocoa to her for old time's\
    \ sake. Quickly apprised of his mistake, Pismire was about to leave when Dobson,\
    \ in an uncharacteristic fit of generosity, invited him to stay for dinner. He\
    \ stayed not only for dinner but for the next four months, during which time he\
    \ barely stopped talking. It is said of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge that\
    \ he could talk for hours, fluently, entrancingly, with barely a pause, but without\
    \ his interlocutors having the faintest idea what on earth he was going on about.\
    \ Pismire was a man of the same kidney, and Dobson found him fascinating.\nOn\
    \ that first evening, as they sat around the table eating pap and slops, Pismire\u2014\
    having been shown Dobson's collection of labelled bones\u2014said: \u201CI find\
    \ it interesting that your surname, Marigold, is Chew, while in that other room\
    \ there are all those bones which have been gnawed. Are you sure that your name\
    \ is not Marigold Gnaw, and that the bones have been chewed? But of course not.\
    \ I jest. If my memory serves, the OED defines chew as \u201Dto crush, bruise,\
    \ and grind to pulp, by the continued action of the molar teeth, with help of\
    \ the tongue, cheeks, and saliva\u201C, and gnaw as \u201Dto bite (something)\
    \ persistently so as to injure it or remove portions of it; to wear away by a\
    \ continued biting or nibbling\u201C, so whereas one may idly think of chewing\
    \ and gnawing as similar activities, they are in fact radically different. Equally\
    \ worthy of note is the fact that in this house of Chew and the gnawed, the dinner\
    \ you have both so kindly provided requires neither chewing nor gnawing, being\
    \ a bland thin sludge one can gulp down, bowl after bowl, without involving one's\
    \ teeth one whit. It is the kind of dinner I approve of, for I like to rest my\
    \ teeth as others rest their weary limbs, the better to preserve them. Speaking\
    \ of which, if I were you, Dobson, I would start collecting animals' teeth as\
    \ well as bones, so you could match up the gnawer with the gnawed.\u201D\n\nLeft\
    \ : Lembit Opik. Right : Vlasto Pismire\nDobson never followed this advice, but\
    \ it did inspire the coda to one of his finest out-of-print pamphlets, which he\
    \ began writing on the wet June day later that year when the cocoa man finally\
    \ left the house. The circumstances of his departure were curious. Marigold Chew\
    \ had embarked upon a mural painting of eels, using one of the walls of the dining\
    \ room. Because he seemed to need no sleep, Pismire had barely moved from the\
    \ dinner table throughout his stay, comfortable in his chair and prattling away\
    \ irrespective of an audience. It had occurred to both Dobson and Marigold Chew\
    \ that perhaps he existed in a separate time continuum and that he thought they\
    \ were still having the same meal as when he had arrived in February. The fact\
    \ that he never removed the napkin tucked into his shirt front supported this\
    \ view.\n\u201CWhat I find puzzling,\u201D said Marigold Chew to Dobson on the\
    \ morning of that June day, as they trudged along the old canal towpath, \u201C\
    Is that when he sat down, the walls were bare. Now they are teeming with eels,\
    \ yet he appears not to notice.\u201D\n\u201CPerhaps he is a blind cocoa man,\u201D\
    \ suggested Dobson.\n\u201CDon't be ridiculous, Dobson,\u201D snorted Marigold\
    \ Chew.\nAs they approached the house on their return, they were astonished to\
    \ find the Lembit Opik lookalike hurrying out of the front door.\n\u201CI can\
    \ no longer remain in a house full of painted eels!\u201D he shouted, looking\
    \ stricken, \u201CFor I have long feared eel depictions of all kinds. If ever\
    \ you invite me to dinner again, I will tell you why.\u201D\nHe carried on talking,\
    \ but as he scurried away his words were lost on the wild winds. Within the hour,\
    \ Dobson had written the first six pages of his pamphlet Chew, Gnaw, Eel, Teeth,\
    \ Pap And Slops For Dinner : A Memoir Of Vlasto Pismire, the only known copy of\
    \ which is rumoured to be in the possession of the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire.\
    \ He keeps it under lock and key and will deny its existence if questioned."
