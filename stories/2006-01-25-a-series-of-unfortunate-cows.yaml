  text: 'Misfortune can strike a cow out of the blue. To give but one example, the
    field in which it is standing may become flooded after heavy rainfall or, if not
    flooded exactly, then pitted with many, many puddles. No cow likes to stand in
    water, so such a circumstance must be counted a misfortune.

    The cow in the puddle, however, is une jolie vache compared to the cow which inattentively
    wanders onto some railway tracks and then comes to a halt. Continuing across the
    tracks would be the wiser option, for as long as the cow remains where it is,
    it is an imperilled cow. But unlike owls, cows are not noted for wisdom. The imperilled
    cow on the railway tracks may suffer the misfortune of being killed by a runaway
    locomotive without a cow-conscious driver at the helm. I am not sure helm is the
    correct word for the little cabin in which a train driver, cow-conscious or otherwise,
    sits or stands, but let that pass. What we can say with certainty is that a motionless
    cow in the path of a runaway train will suffer the greatest of misfortunes, that
    is, a violent death. By comparison, the previous cow, the one standing in the
    puddle, is almost as happy a cow as the laughing one that mysteriously appears
    on the wrappers of a brand of processed cheese triangles in this country, and
    perhaps in other countries too.

    If my memory serves, that laughing cow is red and white. If a real cow was red
    and white, it too would probably suffer misfortune, for its colouration would
    make it an easy target for predators. Larger, more savage beasts, ones with vision
    alert to bright primary colours, in this case red, would be far more likely to
    attack the laughing cow than a neighbouring cow that was, say, beige or dun or
    even dappled. Such being the case, one wonders why the red and white cow is laughing.

    The fourth in our series of unfortunate cows is the one that is stricken by disease.
    In the popular mind, the most notable cow disease is bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
    or mad cow disease. I, for one, can never read the technical phrase without visualising
    a cow with a brain that has turned to sponge. That may be because I am mispronouncing
    the word spongiform. Either way, I think we can agree that this is the least fortunate
    cow we have encountered so far.

    Next week we will be taking a stroll down a pathway that leads to four more cows
    assailed by misfortune. Until then, your homework is as follows. Answer the following
    questions to the best of your ability, and with a certain dash.

    1. If, through some eldritch soul-transfer conjured by a warlock, you swapped
    places with one of the four unfortunate cows above, which one would it be, and
    why?

    2. Would you follow the example of the red and white cow, and laugh in the face
    of misfortune, or would you take steps to avert it? If so, how?

    3. What tips would you give to a cow standing in a puddle?

    4. Imagine you are a train driver. Would you be cow-conscious? If so, list six
    examples of your cow-consciousness.
