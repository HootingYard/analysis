  text: '"Archer''s hopes sank. It was easy to guess what had happened. Those thugs
    had found him, probably after the cyclotron had been turned off and before the
    physicists had come. They had assumed he was dead, and had taken the briefcase.
    Suddenly Archer remembered that he had had a broken arm. He lifted his right arm
    and clenched his hand. It certainly wasn''t broken now. Then he stared at his
    hand. It glowed with a dull violet light." -- E A Grosser, The Radiant Avenger'
