    \ thugs had found him, probably after the cyclotron had been turned off and before\
    \ the physicists had come. They had assumed he was dead, and had taken the briefcase.\
    \ Suddenly Archer remembered that he had had a broken arm. He lifted his right\
    \ arm and clenched his hand. It certainly wasn't broken now. Then he stared at\
    \ his hand. It glowed with a dull violet light.\u201D \u2014 E A Grosser, The\
