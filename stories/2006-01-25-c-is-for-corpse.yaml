  text: 'Episode three in our daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    Oh dear! Hidden behind an iron chest in the pointless hut, bundled up in sacking,
    there is a dead body. The cause of death is not immediately apparent. In a few
    weeks time, an inquest will be told that the oesophagus contains three or four
    small items of ironmongery. The sacking is mostly burlap.'
