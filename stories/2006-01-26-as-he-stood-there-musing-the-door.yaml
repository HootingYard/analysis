  text: "\u201CAs he stood there musing, the door burst open mid a great clamor and\
    \ shouting, and a mob of drunken soldiers poured through the gap. They were staggering\
    \ under silken robes, golden goblets helmeted their heads, precious ornaments\
    \ of jade dangled from their persons. The foremost of the rioters beheld the ancient\
    \ Ming priest. With joyous cries, they pounced upon him, seized him with ungentle\
    \ hands. \u2018O outlived reptile of accursed lineage, give us your hidden treasures,\
    \ or we slit your wizened throat.\u2019 The priest struggled feebly in his captors'\
    \ grasp, crying feebly.\u201D \u2014 Nat Schachner & Arthur L Zagat, The Song\
    \ Of The Cakes"
