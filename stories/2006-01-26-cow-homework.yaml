  text: 'Yesterday''s item A Series Of Unfortunate Cows had a homework assignment
    attached. This is just one initiative in the development of a new Interactive
    Hooting Yard Project. Reader Mark Williams had the good grace to send his homework
    in, and I reprint it below to give the rest of you some idea of the standards
    we are looking for.

    Note to Mark : Your handwriting is lopsided. In future, please ensure that the
    express turbomotorcycle courier arrives at Haemoglobin Towers before midnight.


    As a reminder, here is that unfortunate cow again

    Here is Mark''s homework:

    1. A cow is not wise, thus on that premise cows will inadvertently engender unfortunate
    situations as proved by the four classic unfortunate situations that you have
    written about. So, ultimately I would require the best possible quality of life,
    that is, the least amount of suffering. Therefore I would not want to get myself
    into unfortunate situations. The inevitable swift painless death of a cow standing
    on some railway tracks is my choice. This is dependent on the scruples of the
    helm man...hmmmm...crikey, there is a possibility of an unfortunate painful death
    resulting from a partial maiming caused by the driver braking and thus not fully
    killing the cow due to the reduced speed. I am confused now.

    2. I would not laugh, instead, I would bury my head in the ground. However, due
    to the unfortunate nature of a cow I would, no doubt, stick my head in a field
    full of Caper Spurge otherwise known as stinking hellebore. The Dumville family
    used this foul smelling plant to rid moles from the English countryside. Fascists.

    3. I would tip the cow like this: "Don''t laugh in the face of misfortune, little
    cow*, otherwise you could end up with more than you bargained for."

    4. On the assumption that an eldritch soul-transfer had taken place then it is
    likely that this soul would have the same intention as me in the answer to question
    one. Thus, I would mow the cow down with my train at the highest speed possible.

    I hope this is not too late.

    * NOTE : Mark appears to think that cows are tiny. They are not. One wonders if
    he has got a grip of the subject at all.'
