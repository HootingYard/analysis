  text: "Episode four in our daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet\n\
    Doctor Cack was the foremost potato scientist of his day. He rented a disused\
    \ Leaking Building in the grounds of the House, together with a number of surrounding\
    \ huts, in which he and his team of top flight tuberologists lived and worked.\
    \ Most of their unbearably exciting scientific equipment was located in the Leaking\
    \ Building, through the door of which Blodgett now crashed, breathing heavily\
    \ through his purple nose.\n\u201CCack!\u201D he shouted, pronouncing the good\
    \ Doctor's name as if he were a chocolate swiss roll, or a Battenburg. Towards\
    \ the back of the Leaking Building stood an enormous table on which were stacked\
    \ flasks, test tubes, scientific hammers, awls, retorts, dye buckets, cruet sets,\
    \ trunnions, shards of propylite, alembics, jars, lenses, and a burnt quintain.\
    \ From behind this agglomeration of rubbish, Ruhugu's head appeared, then the\
    \ rest of his body. He peered at Blodgett with distaste.\n\u201CWhere's Cack?\u201D\
    \ yelled Blodgett, repeating his mispronunciation.\nRuhugu was one of Doctor Cack's\
    \ assistants, perhaps the most fanatical. \u201CIt's Cack,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    To rhyme with Snack.\u201D\nBlodgett trembled with rage. \u201CI'll give you Snack,\u201D\
    \ he rasped, although what he meant by this was not entirely clear, even to him.\
    \ \u201CCack, Snack, it's all the same to me,\u201D he continued, \u201CI don't\
    \ care if he's called Pack, Rack or Glack. He's still a git.\u201D He paused long\
    \ enough for Ruhugu to interrupt.\n\u201CThe Doctor is not here at the moment.\
    \ Why are you flailing your arms around in such an alarming fashion?\u201D\nMomentarily\
    \ disconcerted, Blodgett manoeuvred his hands into his filthy pockets.\n\u201C\
    Thank you,\u201D said Ruhugu, \u201CNow, as I explained, Doctor Cack is away.\
    \ I have important potato matters to attend to, so I'd be very grateful if you\
    \ would turn on your heel and begone.\u201D\nBlodgett's temper was getting hotter.\
    \ Oh, how he would like to immerse Ruhugu in a vat of custard, bind him with manacles,\
    \ belabour him about the temples, and abandon him in a ditch! Not necessarily\
    \ in that order. But of course, Blodgett was a terrible coward, and would only\
    \ attack defenceless tinies, small frail animals, and inanimate objects, and only\
    \ then if he was sure no vengeance would be exacted by some gigantic protector.\
    \ He spat on the floor, whirled around, and clomped out of the Leaking Building,\
    \ cracking his head on the lintel as he did so."
