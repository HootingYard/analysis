    Doctor Cack was the foremost potato scientist of his day. He rented a disused
    Leaking Building in the grounds of the House, together with a number of surrounding
    huts, in which he and his team of top flight tuberologists lived and worked. Most
    of their unbearably exciting scientific equipment was located in the Leaking Building,
    through the door of which Blodgett now crashed, breathing heavily through his
    purple nose.

    "Cack!" he shouted, pronouncing the good Doctor''s name as if he were a chocolate
    swiss roll, or a Battenburg. Towards the back of the Leaking Building stood an
    enormous table on which were stacked flasks, test tubes, scientific hammers, awls,
    retorts, dye buckets, cruet sets, trunnions, shards of propylite, alembics, jars,
    lenses, and a burnt quintain. From behind this agglomeration of rubbish, Ruhugu''s
    head appeared, then the rest of his body. He peered at Blodgett with distaste.

    "Where''s Cack?" yelled Blodgett, repeating his mispronunciation.

    Ruhugu was one of Doctor Cack''s assistants, perhaps the most fanatical. "It''s
    Cack," he said, "To rhyme with Snack."

    Blodgett trembled with rage. "I''ll give you Snack," he rasped, although what
    he meant by this was not entirely clear, even to him. "Cack, Snack, it''s all
    the same to me," he continued, "I don''t care if he''s called Pack, Rack or Glack.
    He''s still a git." He paused long enough for Ruhugu to interrupt.

    "The Doctor is not here at the moment. Why are you flailing your arms around in
    such an alarming fashion?"

    Momentarily disconcerted, Blodgett manoeuvred his hands into his filthy pockets.

    "Thank you," said Ruhugu, "Now, as I explained, Doctor Cack is away. I have important
    potato matters to attend to, so I''d be very grateful if you would turn on your
    heel and begone."

    Blodgett''s temper was getting hotter. Oh, how he would like to immerse Ruhugu
    in a vat of custard, bind him with manacles, belabour him about the temples, and
    abandon him in a ditch! Not necessarily in that order. But of course, Blodgett
    was a terrible coward, and would only attack defenceless tinies, small frail animals,
    and inanimate objects, and only then if he was sure no vengeance would be exacted
    by some gigantic protector. He spat on the floor, whirled around, and clomped
    out of the Leaking Building, cracking his head on the lintel as he did so.'
