  text: "Much fuss has been made\u2014and rightly so\u2014about Google's launch of\
    \ google.cn, designed to do the Chinese government's censorship work for them.\
    \ Overlooked in all the kerfuffle is the launch of a far more admirable system\
    \ from the search engine behemoth.\n\nGoogle.dbsn is a genuinely useful tool.\
    \ It automatically filters out all search results which are unrelated to Dobson,\
    \ Dobson's out-of-print pamphlets, and other relevant Dobsonia. Thus, type \u201C\
    swarm of killer bees\u201D into google.com, and you end up with a completely unmanageable\
    \ 102,000 results. The vast majority of these will have no Dobson connection whatsoever,\
    \ so what is the likelihood that any sane person would ever wish to consult them?\
    \ By contrast, typing \u201Cswarm of killer bees\u201D into google.dbsn comes\
    \ up with just 183 results, every single one of them highly relevant. Some will\
    \ take you directly to transcripts of original Dobson pamphlets, such as Killer\
    \ Bees, Ferenc Puskas, And Tomatoes On the Vine or How I Coped With A Collapsed\
    \ Lung During A Thunderstorm. Others will lead you to one of the many sites devoted\
    \ to piecing together a complete biography of Dobson. You will even be able to\
    \ track down references to the more recondite aspects of Dobson's killer bee preoccupations,\
    \ such as the Bl\xF6tzmann Compartments controversy of 1934.\nAs if all that weren't\
    \ recommendation enough, google.dbsn comes with a delightful logo, reproduced\
    \ (with permission) below.\n"
