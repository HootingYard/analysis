  text: 'Much fuss has been made--and rightly so--about Google''s launch of google.cn,
    designed to do the Chinese government''s censorship work for them. Overlooked
    in all the kerfuffle is the launch of a far more admirable system from the search
    engine behemoth.


    Google.dbsn is a genuinely useful tool. It automatically filters out all search
    results which are unrelated to Dobson, Dobson''s out-of-print pamphlets, and other
    relevant Dobsonia. Thus, type "swarm of killer bees" into google.com, and you
    end up with a completely unmanageable 102,000 results. The vast majority of these
    will have no Dobson connection whatsoever, so what is the likelihood that any
    sane person would ever wish to consult them? By contrast, typing "swarm of killer
    bees" into google.dbsn comes up with just 183 results, every single one of them
    highly relevant. Some will take you directly to transcripts of original Dobson
    pamphlets, such as Killer Bees, Ferenc Puskas, And Tomatoes On the Vine or How
    I Coped With A Collapsed Lung During A Thunderstorm. Others will lead you to one
    of the many sites devoted to piecing together a complete biography of Dobson.
    You will even be able to track down references to the more recondite aspects of
    Dobson''s killer bee preoccupations, such as the Blotzmann Compartments controversy
    of 1934.

    As if all that weren''t recommendation enough, google.dbsn comes with a delightful
    logo, reproduced (with permission) below.
