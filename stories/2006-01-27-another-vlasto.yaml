  text: "Last Tuesday, in The Gnawed And The Chewed (see below), we met Vlasto Pismire,\
    \ the Lembit Opik lookalike whose incessant prattling transfixed Dobson for months\
    \ and months. Vlasto Pismire is not to be confused with another Vlasto, to whom\
    \ we now turn.\nVlasto Cuddy was a tall, stooping sort of person who spent most\
    \ of his time standing on top of a crate, by numberless kerbs and roadsides, elegantly\
    \ attired, flailing his spookily long arms, pontificating at passers-by.\nHe sounds\
    \ familiar\u2026 but I can't quite place him.\nPossibly you do not recognise the\
    \ name. Very, very few people knew him as Vlasto Cuddy, for he became familiar\
    \ to thousands, perhaps even millions, under his sobriquet, the Pontificating\
    \ Fruitarian.\nAh yes! That rings a bell.\nMany bells, I expect. Vlasto Cuddy\
    \ the Pontificating Fruitarian spent more than fifty years declaiming his blinkered\
    \ dietary opinions to the passing throng. Sometimes the throng passed more quickly\
    \ than was seemly. Sometimes it could hardly be called a throng at all. Sometimes\
    \ there were torrential downpours, and at other times the light of the big bright\
    \ sun battered mercilessly upon the face of the earth, and in these and all other\
    \ weather conditions there would be a roadside somewhere in the world where at\
    \ dawn of day a tall, stooping sort of person would deposit his crate and clamber\
    \ atop it and begin his fruit-related pontificating, and scarcely cease until\
    \ night fell down.\nRemind me of the nature of his pontificating.\nBy all means.\
    \ Vlasto Cuddy would shout, for example, that pride and lust, a corrupt pride\
    \ of heart, and a furious filthy lust of body, are the non-fruitarian's springs\
    \ of action, a desire to act the beast without control, and live like a devil\
    \ without a check of conscience, his only reasons for opposing the existence of\
    \ fruit. He would thunder that a world of creatures are up in arms against the\
    \ non-fruit eater, to kill him as they would a venomous mad dog. He called those\
    \ who eschew plums and tangerines absurd fools, beasts, dirty monsters, brutes,\
    \ gloomy dark animals, enemies of humankind, wolves to civil society, butchers\
    \ and murderers of the human race. Moreover, he who eats anything other than lemons\
    \ and other citrus fruits is cursed in the following hearty terms\u2014\u201C\
    Let the glorious mass of fire burn him, let the moon light him to the gallows,\
    \ let the stars in their courses fight against the wretch who eats other than\
    \ fruit, let the force of the comets dash him to pieces, let the roar of thunders\
    \ strike him deaf, let red lightnings blast his guilty soul, let the sea lift\
    \ up her mighty waves to bury him, let the lion tear him to pieces, let dogs devour\
    \ him, let the air poison him, let the next crumb of bread choke him, nay, let\
    \ the dull ass spurn him to death.\u201D\nI remember now. I was always puzzled\
    \ by that last bit, for I do not think it possible to die simply from being spurned\
    \ by an ass. Had the Pontificating Fruitarian done his research?\nHe had indeed.\
    \ Vlasto Cuddy's sister, the Divine Miss Patience Cuddy, rose to prominence in\
    \ the world of donkey rearing, and she often conducted experiments in which volunteers\
    \ from a nearby orphanage subjected themselves to spurning by asses and donkeys.\
    \ Some died as a result.\nSurely that cannot be so!\nI grant there was talk in\
    \ the taverns that the Divine Miss Patience may have falsified some of her data,\
    \ but nothing was ever proven.\nTell me, was the Divine Miss Patience a fruitarian\
    \ like her tall, stooping brother?\nNo she was not. His pontifications were lost\
    \ on her, for he was forever roaming the world with his crate, while she rarely\
    \ ventured far from her donkey compound on the banks of the river that runs through\
    \ Ack.\nDid Vlasto Cuddy the Pontificating Fruitarian never commit any of his\
    \ pontifications to paper? Did he not take a leaf out of Dobson's book, that is\
    \ to say, and publish his pontifications as pamphlets?\nHe did not, for the surprising\
    \ fact is that Vlasto Cuddy was functionally illiterate. It is said that he never\
    \ had time to learn to read or write because he was far too busy concentrating\
    \ all the powers of his formidable mind upon the subject of fruit.\nWill you be\
    \ introducing readers to further Vlastos in addition to Vlasto Pismire and Vlasto\
    \ Cuddy?\nNot if I can help it.\n"
