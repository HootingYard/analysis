  text: "Episode five in our daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet\n\
    In the scullery, Aminadab sat slumped at the table. His elbows rested on a grimy\
    \ place-mat, one of a set depicting scenes of Thuringian history. Blodgett had\
    \ stacked most of the set on the dresser, leaving two on the table. Aminadab's\
    \ mat showed the execution of Konrad Schmid, flagellant King of Thuringia who\
    \ predicted\u2014inaccurately, as it turned out\u2014that the Last Judgement would\
    \ occur in 1369. In colours that were no longer vivid, Schmid's gruesome face\
    \ leered out of the flames which were about to engulf him. The six other heretics\
    \ who were burned alongside him at Nordhausen in 1368 were curiously absent.\n\
    Aminadab, who had poured his cold tea down the sink, was about to fall asleep\
    \ when Euwige entered the room. She was wrapped in a blotchy shawl, so huge that\
    \ it trailed along the floor behind her. Her corduroy boots had been strengthened\
    \ with scraps of inexpertly-sewn hide from an unidentified quadruped. As she removed\
    \ her hat, she shuddered, her sightless eyes directed at the ceiling.\n\u201C\
    You must come with me,\u201D she said. Aminadab looked up.\n\u201CShall I bring\
    \ my luggage?\u201D he asked.\n\u201CIt might well be for the best,\u201D replied\
    \ Euwige, in a mysterious tone.\nAminadab loaded himself with his three suitcases,\
    \ haversack, two satchels, purses, vanity bag, cloth hammock, bandbox, badger\
    \ tin, caddies and punnets, gunny sack, reticule, vasculum and duffel bag. Tottering\
    \ under the weight, he made to follow Euwige, but was immediately halted in his\
    \ tracks when the scullery door banged shut behind her. She did not respond to\
    \ his cries for help, so he was forced to drop the vanity bag, bandbox, reticule\
    \ and one of the punnets, wedge the door open with a handy utensil, pick up the\
    \ items he had let fall\u2014noting that the bandbox was irreparably dented\u2014\
    and hurry after her. So bulky was the haversack, however, that Aminadab was unable\
    \ to negotiate the doorway without a struggle, and by the time he was free Euwige\
    \ had vanished around the corner of a sulphurous corridor. By the time he reached\
    \ the spot, she was nowhere to be seen.\nThinking he could hear her shawl trailing\
    \ across the floorboards somewhere in the distance, he followed on through dingy,\
    \ unlit corridors, up and down rotten staircases, through rooms empty of furniture\
    \ or life, past gigantic indoor fountains, conservatories filled with stinking\
    \ poisonous spiky foliage, lumber rooms, bookcases stacked with editions of the\
    \ novels of Ayn Rand, cavernous halls, storerooms full of half-dismantled tricycles,\
    \ larders crammed with tins of soup, chambers, parlours and cubicles, ventilation\
    \ shafts, dust holes and laundry rooms.\nHours passed before he admitted to himself\
    \ that he was lost."
