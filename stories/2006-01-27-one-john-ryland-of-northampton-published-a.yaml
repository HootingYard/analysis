    \ of useful information, very necessary for the various ages and departments of\
    \ life in which \u2018pride and lust, a corrupt pride of heart, and a furious\
    \ filthy lust of body,\u2019 are announced as the Atheist's \u2018springs of action,\u2019\
    \ 'desire to act the beast without control, and live like a devil without a check\
    \ of conscience,' his only \u2018reasons for opposing the existence of God,\u2019\
    \ in which he is told \u2018a world of creatures are up in arms against him to\
    \ kill him as they would a venomous mad dog,\u2019 in which, among other hard\
    \ names, he is called \u2018absurd fool,\u2019 'beast,' \u2018dirty monster,\u2019\
    \ 'brute,' \u2018gloomy dark animal,\u2019 'enemy of mankind,' \u2018wolf to civil\
    \ society,\u2019 'butcher and murderer of the human race,' in which, moreover,\
    \ he is cursed in the following hearty terms;\u2014\u2018Let the glorious mass\
    \ of fire burn him, let the moon light him to the gallows, let the stars in their\
    \ courses fight against the Atheist, let the force of the comets dash him to pieces,\
    \ let the roar of thunders strike him deaf, let red lightnings blast his guilty\
    \ soul, let the sea lift up her mighty waves to bury him, let the lion tear him\
    \ to pieces, let dogs devour him, let the air poison him, let the next crumb of\
    \ bread choke him, nay, let the dull ass spurn him to death.\u2019 This is a notable\
    \ specimen of zeal turned sour.\u201D \u2014 Charles Southwell, Superstition Unveiled"
