  text: '"One John Ryland of Northampton, published a Preceptor, or General Repository
    of useful information, very necessary for the various ages and departments of
    life in which ''pride and lust, a corrupt pride of heart, and a furious filthy
    lust of body,'' are announced as the Atheist''s ''springs of action,'' ''desire
    to act the beast without control, and live like a devil without a check of conscience,''
    his only ''reasons for opposing the existence of God,'' in which he is told ''a
    world of creatures are up in arms against him to kill him as they would a venomous
    mad dog,'' in which, among other hard names, he is called ''absurd fool,'' ''beast,''
    ''dirty monster,'' ''brute,'' ''gloomy dark animal,'' ''enemy of mankind,'' ''wolf
    to civil society,'' ''butcher and murderer of the human race,'' in which, moreover,
    he is cursed in the following hearty terms;--''Let the glorious mass of fire burn
    him, let the moon light him to the gallows, let the stars in their courses fight
    against the Atheist, let the force of the comets dash him to pieces, let the roar
    of thunders strike him deaf, let red lightnings blast his guilty soul, let the
    sea lift up her mighty waves to bury him, let the lion tear him to pieces, let
    dogs devour him, let the air poison him, let the next crumb of bread choke him,
    nay, let the dull ass spurn him to death.'' This is a notable specimen of zeal
    turned sour." -- Charles Southwell, Superstition Unveiled'
