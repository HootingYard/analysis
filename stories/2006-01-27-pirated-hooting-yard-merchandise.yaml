  text: 'The tentacles of Hooting Yard continue to writhe in a hideously Lovecraftian
    manner around the world. The latest instance of this is the appearance of pirated
    merchandise. I am extraordinarily pleased to note that readers can now obtain
    a very special mug from which to gulp down their Cuppagruel(tm).


    The mug is emblazoned with the "Implausible" logo and is outrageously expensive.
    Having tracked down the ingrate behind this pathetic get-rich-quick scheme, I
    am assured that if it sells in sufficient quantities, I might receive a one-off
    payment of about thirty five pence. So I implore every single reader to go and
    buy one immediately! Visit Wombat Keeper Publications and follow the link to the
    online shop.'
