  text: 'Episode six in our daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    In dietary matters, Blodgett deferred to the cook, Mrs Purgative. She was a woman
    of regular habits and iron will. Every day, she prepared four cauldrons of boiling
    soup, for consumption at dawn, mid-morning, mid-afternoon and dusk. Each soup
    was prepared from a different recipe, though Mrs Purgative preferred the antique
    spelling receipt.

    The first soup was a thin clear broth flavoured with kidneys, minnows and saffron.

    The second soup was thick and lumpy, more like a stew or what the Bible calls
    a pottage. Its main ingredients were curds, feverfew, whelks, gin, blood oranges
    and a sort of puddingy sponge of unknown provenance.

    The third soup consisted mostly of duckpond water, into which Mrs Purgative hurled
    delphiniums, muffins, pike and herring, lights, parsley, cocoa and masa harina,
    eggs, toffee apples and cake crumbs.

    Her greatest achievement, though, was the fourth soup. The receipt had taken her
    years to bring to perfection. The base was a thick paste of mugwort, the pulp
    of runner beans, finely ground crocuses, and mustard. This was diluted with boiling
    duckpond water and left to stand for a week, uncovered, out in a field. Brought
    back to the kitchen, the topmost layer of scurf and froth would be drawn off and
    used as a filling for small pancakes with an oaty flavour. The pancakes would
    be tossed into the soup together with mayonnaise, cream crackers, bloaters, pemmican,
    tulip-roots, agar, an ox head, krill, the crushed bones of a swan, whey, turmeric,
    marmalade, groist, badgers'' brains, and spinach. Boiled until it had the consistency
    of mush, the soup would be thinned out with the addition of yet more duckpond
    water and egg custard sherry, and then garnished with brazil nuts and semi-chewed
    celery sticks. Mrs Purgative usually asked Blodgett to do the prepatory chewing.

    At quarterly intervals through the year, she cooked an ample supply of each of
    the four soups. She then supervised the canning process, which was carried out
    in a small factory in the grounds of the House. Once tinned, the soups were stored
    in larders, from where Blodgett or other Blodgett-like figures would collect daily
    supplies. As far as can be ascertained, the soup was the only sustenance officially
    available in the House. Oh, apart from cups of tea, of course.'
