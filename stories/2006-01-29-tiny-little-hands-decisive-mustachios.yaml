  text: "Much of the work of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) was\
    \ written for piano. This is surprising when one considers how tiny his hands\
    \ were. Indeed, there were two occasions during his short, fraught life when he\
    \ injured them while relentlessly practising piano pieces which called for hands\
    \ larger than his own.\nTiny his hands may have been, but this puny neurasthenic\
    \ Russian cultivated a pair of decisive mustachios.\n\nAmong his orchestral works,\
    \ the Poem of Ecstasy, opus 54, is a supremely bonkers piece which, long before\
    \ Spinal Tap, goes up to eleven. One critic imagined he was hearing a graphic\
    \ portrayal of the players all having sex with each other. Another refers to the\
    \ \u201Cmalignant sneers from muted trombones\u2026 was music ever more evil-sounding\u201D\
    ?\nNot everyone appreciated Scriabin at the time, of course. The man who was chosen\
    \ to conduct the premiere of his Second Symphony complained \u201CAfter Scriabin,\
    \ Wagner lisps sweetly like a suckling babe. I think that I will go mad any moment\
    \ now. Where can one hide from such music? Help me!\u201D\nMy favourite Scriabin\
    \ piece is the Mysterium. This was designed as a total art work, involving an\
    \ orchestra, dance, light, and exotic perfumes, to be performed in the Himalayas,\
    \ its playing ushering in Armageddon. Mysterium would be \u201Ca grandiose religious\
    \ synthesis of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world\u201D and\
    \ the emergence of a Nietzschean Superman. Whether this Superman would have tiny\
    \ little hands and decisive mustachios we do not know, for Scriabin succumbed\
    \ to septicemia when the composition was barely begun. It thus has a place in\
    \ the museum of lost or non-existent works of art, about which I shall write more\
    \ soon."
