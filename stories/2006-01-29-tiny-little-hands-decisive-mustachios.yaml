  text: 'Much of the work of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) was
    written for piano. This is surprising when one considers how tiny his hands were.
    Indeed, there were two occasions during his short, fraught life when he injured
    them while relentlessly practising piano pieces which called for hands larger
    than his own.

    Tiny his hands may have been, but this puny neurasthenic Russian cultivated a
    pair of decisive mustachios.


    Among his orchestral works, the Poem of Ecstasy, opus 54, is a supremely bonkers
    piece which, long before Spinal Tap, goes up to eleven. One critic imagined he
    was hearing a graphic portrayal of the players all having sex with each other.
    Another refers to the "malignant sneers from muted trombones... was music ever
    more evil-sounding"?

    Not everyone appreciated Scriabin at the time, of course. The man who was chosen
    to conduct the premiere of his Second Symphony complained "After Scriabin, Wagner
    lisps sweetly like a suckling babe. I think that I will go mad any moment now.
    Where can one hide from such music? Help me!"

    My favourite Scriabin piece is the Mysterium. This was designed as a total art
    work, involving an orchestra, dance, light, and exotic perfumes, to be performed
    in the Himalayas, its playing ushering in Armageddon. Mysterium would be "a grandiose
    religious synthesis of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world" and
    the emergence of a Nietzschean Superman. Whether this Superman would have tiny
    little hands and decisive mustachios we do not know, for Scriabin succumbed to
    septicemia when the composition was barely begun. It thus has a place in the museum
    of lost or non-existent works of art, about which I shall write more soon.'
