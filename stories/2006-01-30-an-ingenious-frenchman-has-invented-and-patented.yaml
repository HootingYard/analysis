  text: "\u201CAn ingenious Frenchman has invented and patented in England lately\
    \ a machine called the Thanatophore, which I confidently recommend. It can be\
    \ obtained from Messrs B S Williams, of Upper Holloway. The Thanatophore destroys\
    \ every insect within reach of its vapour, excepting, curiously enough, scaly-bug.\
    \ The machine may be obtained in different sizes through any good ironmonger.\u201D\
