  text: '"An ingenious Frenchman has invented and patented in England lately a machine
    called the Thanatophore, which I confidently recommend. It can be obtained from
    Messrs B S Williams, of Upper Holloway. The Thanatophore destroys every insect
    within reach of its vapour, excepting, curiously enough, scaly-bug. The machine
    may be obtained in different sizes through any good ironmonger." -- Frederick
    Boyle, About Orchids'
