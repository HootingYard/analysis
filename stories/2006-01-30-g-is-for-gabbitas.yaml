  text: "Episode seven in our daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet\n\
    The Blodgett figure on the second and third floors of the House was known as Gabbitas,\
    \ although this was not the name he had been born with. Like Blodgett, he had\
    \ been in place for as long as anyone could remember. His nose ran. He was clumsy.\
    \ His disposition was as bleak and unforgiving as Blodgett's. Gabbitas was astonishingly\
    \ tall\u2014almost seven and a half feet\u2014and his eyes were permanently bloodshot.\
    \ We shall meet with him again, you can count on it."
