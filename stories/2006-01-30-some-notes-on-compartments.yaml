  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes the ever-curious Tim Thurn, In last Thursday''s piece
    entitled Google News (26 January, see below) you make passing mention of the Blotzmann
    Compartments controversy of 1934. I confess that I have no idea what a Blotzmann
    Compartment is, or was, and would be extremely grateful if you could enlighten
    me.

    Well, Tim, I will do my best, but I warn you that getting to grips with Blotzmann
    Compartments is no easy matter. Have you ever looked into the fathomless black
    pools of an owl''s eyes? If you have, you will know that eerie sense of confronting
    an unutterably alien, cold, unyielding energy. It was this sense of otherness
    that motivated Blotzmann when he built the first of the notorious Compartments.

    We still have some of his working notes, but they help us little, couched as they
    are in a dense academic (or pseudoacademic) language which may have made no sense
    even to Blotzmann. Phrases such as "by extension, most advanced peristomal border
    plating is noted for an unusual hydropore/gonopore in the axismal interray and
    the position of juvenile, summit-mounted proximal tegmens and theca" flummox the
    best of brains. We do know that whenever Blotzmann constructed a Compartment,
    he made sure a fully functioning Thanatophore was primed and ready in the corner
    of his workshop.

    As he learned to manipulate the Compartments, Blotzmann became more open about
    his intentions. He introduced a swivelling panel on the top of each Compartment,
    allowing viewers the opportunity for a fleeting glimpse of activity within. The
    panels were attached to a small motor fixed to the side of the Compartment, powered
    from a source which Blotzmann always refused to divulge, though it is likely to
    have been a simple dry cell battery. It may even have been a wet cell battery,
    if such a thing exists. Knowing nothing of batteries and their workings, I am
    reluctant to say any more about this for the time being.

    Arriving at the optimal size of the Compartments was a hit and miss affair, which
    usually found Blotzmann gritting his teeth. A study by Howl and Flapper determined
    that the smallest Compartment could fit inside a standard pastry carton, while
    the largest one known to exist blotted out the moon and the stars. This reminds
    us of Blotzmann''s insistence that his Compartments were never exposed to daylight,
    leading to absurd accusations in the gutter press that there was vampiric intent
    behind the entire project.

    Fire and flood destroyed all the Blotzmann Compartments one by one, over a period
    of seventeen years. Blotzmann was sanguine. He himself had the black eyes of an
    owl, and hair that resembled feathers. Make of that what you will. You would not
    be the first to posit a madcap theory.'
