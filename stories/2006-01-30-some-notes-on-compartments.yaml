  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes the ever-curious Tim Thurn, In last Thursday's piece\
    \ entitled Google News (26 January, see below) you make passing mention of the\
    \ Bl\xF6tzmann Compartments controversy of 1934. I confess that I have no idea\
    \ what a Bl\xF6tzmann Compartment is, or was, and would be extremely grateful\
    \ if you could enlighten me.\nWell, Tim, I will do my best, but I warn you that\
    \ getting to grips with Bl\xF6tzmann Compartments is no easy matter. Have you\
    \ ever looked into the fathomless black pools of an owl's eyes? If you have, you\
    \ will know that eerie sense of confronting an unutterably alien, cold, unyielding\
    \ energy. It was this sense of otherness that motivated Bl\xF6tzmann when he built\
    \ the first of the notorious Compartments.\nWe still have some of his working\
    \ notes, but they help us little, couched as they are in a dense academic (or\
    \ pseudoacademic) language which may have made no sense even to Bl\xF6tzmann.\
    \ Phrases such as \u201Cby extension, most advanced peristomal border plating\
    \ is noted for an unusual hydropore/gonopore in the axismal interray and the position\
    \ of juvenile, summit-mounted proximal tegmens and theca\u201D flummox the best\
    \ of brains. We do know that whenever Bl\xF6tzmann constructed a Compartment,\
    \ he made sure a fully functioning Thanatophore was primed and ready in the corner\
    \ of his workshop.\nAs he learned to manipulate the Compartments, Bl\xF6tzmann\
    \ became more open about his intentions. He introduced a swivelling panel on the\
    \ top of each Compartment, allowing viewers the opportunity for a fleeting glimpse\
    \ of activity within. The panels were attached to a small motor fixed to the side\
    \ of the Compartment, powered from a source which Bl\xF6tzmann always refused\
    \ to divulge, though it is likely to have been a simple dry cell battery. It may\
    \ even have been a wet cell battery, if such a thing exists. Knowing nothing of\
    \ batteries and their workings, I am reluctant to say any more about this for\
    \ the time being.\nArriving at the optimal size of the Compartments was a hit\
    \ and miss affair, which usually found Bl\xF6tzmann gritting his teeth. A study\
    \ by Howl and Flapper determined that the smallest Compartment could fit inside\
    \ a standard pastry carton, while the largest one known to exist blotted out the\
    \ moon and the stars. This reminds us of Bl\xF6tzmann's insistence that his Compartments\
    \ were never exposed to daylight, leading to absurd accusations in the gutter\
    \ press that there was vampiric intent behind the entire project.\nFire and flood\
    \ destroyed all the Bl\xF6tzmann Compartments one by one, over a period of seventeen\
    \ years. Bl\xF6tzmann was sanguine. He himself had the black eyes of an owl, and\
    \ hair that resembled feathers. Make of that what you will. You would not be the\
    \ first to posit a madcap theory."
