    My name is Sago and I am a glum inmate of Pang Hill Orphanage. I was born in a
    faraway land. My papa was a crusty man who fell into a pond and never surfaced.
    Later they found a vent at the bottom of the pond which led to a chute which in
    turn led to a hideous abode of Doom. My mama collected flies and fleas and similar
    wee beasts, often but not always winged ones. One day, soon after papa plunged
    down the chute at the bottom of the pond, she took a little paper bag with some
    of her flies in it to the parliament building of that faraway land, and when she
    showed reluctance to open the bag to the security guards at the magnetic barrier
    in the lobby, they shot her dead. That is the kind of land I come from.

    I spent a few months living off berries and rainwater and living in a cave on
    the coastline. Then the captain of an illegal fishing smack scooped me out of
    the tide pool where I was happily paddling and brought me thousands of miles across
    the storm-tossed ocean and delivered me to the gates of Pang Hill Orphanage. That
    is my story in its broad outlines. I would tell you more, but it is time for my
    morning brain scan. No one at the Orphanage has ever explained to me why each
    orphan''s brain is scanned three times a day, but I have made a plasticine copy
    of the key to the room behind the canteen in which lurk the filing cabinets where
    the brain scan results are stored, and soon I am going to skulk in there at dead
    of night and examine all the results very, very closely and then I am going to
    shred them, for I fear nobody and nothing. I am glum but stupendously brave and
    clever, and my name is Sago.'
