  text: "Regular readers will sigh and complain, \u201COh for crying out loud, is\
    \ Frank going on about bees again?\u201D Well, no, I am not. I want to talk today\
    \ about people who get figurative bees in their figurative bonnets, monomaniacs\
    \ who devote their time, money, and energy to \u201Cissues\u201D that make them\
    \ fume and growl and seethe and have attacks of the vapours. People can get themselves\
    \ all worked up about things most of us never even think about.\nWho can fail\
    \ to be delighted, for example, by Hedgeline, the snappy name for the Campaign\
    \ For Effective Legislative Control Of Problem High Hedges Of All Species, In\
    \ Residential Areas Of The UK? I suppose CFELCOPHHOASIRAOTUK is a somewhat unwieldy\
    \ acronym, even for a fuming monomaniac.\nThe Hedgeline website is a masterpiece\
    \ of unintentional comedy, from the excited announcement that \u201Cthe Daily\
    \ Mail is interested in problem with the High Hedges Law\u201D (now there's a\
    \ surprise!) to the repeated references to \u201Chedge-victims\u201D. I cannot\
    \ help picturing a sobbing hedge-victim unburdening their grief to one of Hedgeline's\
    \ \u201Cfellowship in adversity listening ears\u201D, recounting how their life\
    \ has been destroyed by having a high hedge near them.\nNote to middle class people\u2014\
    talk in a civil manner to your neighbours and you may avoid the soul-lacerating\
    \ horror of hedge-victimhood.\n\nI have deliberately reproduced Hedgeline's logo\
    \ to see if flouting the stern warning on their website will have any repercussions.\
    \ Material on this entire website is not for reproduction on any other website\
    \ or in any other way without permission of Hedgeline, it says. I wonder what\
    \ will happen. Will they plant a terrifyingly high hedge outside my front door?\
    \ I will keep you informed."
