  text: 'Regular readers will sigh and complain, "Oh for crying out loud, is Frank
    going on about bees again?" Well, no, I am not. I want to talk today about people
    who get figurative bees in their figurative bonnets, monomaniacs who devote their
    time, money, and energy to "issues" that make them fume and growl and seethe and
    have attacks of the vapours. People can get themselves all worked up about things
    most of us never even think about.

    Who can fail to be delighted, for example, by Hedgeline, the snappy name for the
    Campaign For Effective Legislative Control Of Problem High Hedges Of All Species,
    In Residential Areas Of The UK? I suppose CFELCOPHHOASIRAOTUK is a somewhat unwieldy
    acronym, even for a fuming monomaniac.

    The Hedgeline website is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy, from the excited
    announcement that "the Daily Mail is interested in problem with the High Hedges
    Law" (now there''s a surprise!) to the repeated references to "hedge-victims".
    I cannot help picturing a sobbing hedge-victim unburdening their grief to one
    of Hedgeline''s "fellowship in adversity listening ears", recounting how their
    life has been destroyed by having a high hedge near them.

    Note to middle class people--talk in a civil manner to your neighbours and you
    may avoid the soul-lacerating horror of hedge-victimhood.


    I have deliberately reproduced Hedgeline''s logo to see if flouting the stern
    warning on their website will have any repercussions. Material on this entire
    website is not for reproduction on any other website or in any other way without
    permission of Hedgeline, it says. I wonder what will happen. Will they plant a
    terrifyingly high hedge outside my front door? I will keep you informed.'
