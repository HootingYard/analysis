    Pamphlet, today with added potato pictures for your instruction and delight


    In ancient Rome, the haruspices were an order of priests who made prophecies by
    examining the steaming entrails of sacrificially-slaughtered animals. Doctor Cack
    had made a thorough study of their methods, and for the last ten years had been
    engaged in experiments to carry out successful haruspication using mashed potatoes
    instead of entrails.


    Ably assisted by Ruhugu and others, Doctor Cack would lay out the "field", a triangular
    cloth weighted down at each corner by a small piece of bakelite. On to this, a
    precisely-measured amount of mashed potato would be splattered with the agency
    of an iron spatula. A second triangular cloth would be placed atop the resulting
    mess, and pressed down evenly. The upper cloth would then be turned over, and
    the pattern created by the mashed potato which had adhered to it would be examined
    with great care. Ruhugu used his box camera to make a photographic record.


    Divination completed, and notes and annotations pencilled into the foolscap ledger,
    the cloth triangles would be scrubbed clean with a special detergent in readiness
    for the next experiment.


    There were arguments, of course. Moop insisted that only certain potato varieties
    were sufficiently "numinous", as she put it. Maris Pipers, Majestics, and Arran
    Banners met with her approval. Trellis maintained that the waxy texture of the
    Red Craig''s Royal made it the only suitable variety. Strob said the cloths ought
    to be hexagonal. The unhinged Jubble went so far as to suggest using boiled and
    mashed celery instead.


    Ruhugu mediated between the factions, protecting Doctor Cack from turmoil and
    strife, leaving him free to pore over the foolscap ledger, frowning, rapt, determined
    to eke from it whatever revelations it harboured.
