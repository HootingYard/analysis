  text: 'Episode nine in our not-quite-daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond
    Pamphlet, this time without any potato pictures

    Like the novelist Samuel Richardson, Doctor Cack was an enthusiastic indexer of
    his own work. Even before he arrived at the House, he had been issuing his Bulletin
    Of Potato Science & Related Matters every quarter. The bulk of the contents he
    wrote himself, allowing the occasional interjection from Ruhugu, Moop, Trellis
    and the others. Only Jubble had been barred from its pages, because he was unhinged.

    Every five years, Doctor Cack published, as a separate volume, a cumulative index
    to the Bulletin. His skills lay in thematic rather than purely alphabetic indexing.
    Indeed, Scridge has remarked that, like Prynne''s Histrio-Mastix (1633), Doctor
    Cack''s indices are often more readable than the texts from which they are eked.

    Of the most recent edition of the Quinquennial Collection Of Instructive Sentiments,
    Maxims, Descriptions, Footnotes, Evasions, Queries & Accusations Contained In
    The Bulletin Of Potato Science & Related Matters, Digested Under Proper Heads,
    Scridge reported that he was "driven to hilarity" by the entry for Potato Cyst
    Eelworm, an infection which stunts and withers the crop, with haulm dying down
    prematurely and tubers the size of marbles resulting.

    Of course, Scridge cannot always be trusted, for he is a deceitful toad. There
    are those who assert that he has never read a single word of Doctor Cack''s majestic
    works, indeed that he has never read a single potato-related text in his entire
    sorry life.'
