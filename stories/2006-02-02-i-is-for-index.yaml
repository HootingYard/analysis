  text: "Episode nine in our not-quite-daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond\
    \ Pamphlet, this time without any potato pictures\nLike the novelist Samuel Richardson,\
    \ Doctor Cack was an enthusiastic indexer of his own work. Even before he arrived\
    \ at the House, he had been issuing his Bulletin Of Potato Science & Related Matters\
    \ every quarter. The bulk of the contents he wrote himself, allowing the occasional\
    \ interjection from Ruhugu, Moop, Trellis and the others. Only Jubble had been\
    \ barred from its pages, because he was unhinged.\nEvery five years, Doctor Cack\
    \ published, as a separate volume, a cumulative index to the Bulletin. His skills\
    \ lay in thematic rather than purely alphabetic indexing. Indeed, Scridge has\
    \ remarked that, like Prynne's Histrio-Mastix (1633), Doctor Cack's indices are\
    \ often more readable than the texts from which they are eked.\nOf the most recent\
    \ edition of the Quinquennial Collection Of Instructive Sentiments, Maxims, Descriptions,\
    \ Footnotes, Evasions, Queries & Accusations Contained In The Bulletin Of Potato\
    \ Science & Related Matters, Digested Under Proper Heads, Scridge reported that\
    \ he was \u201Cdriven to hilarity\u201D by the entry for Potato Cyst Eelworm,\
    \ an infection which stunts and withers the crop, with haulm dying down prematurely\
    \ and tubers the size of marbles resulting.\nOf course, Scridge cannot always\
    \ be trusted, for he is a deceitful toad. There are those who assert that he has\
    \ never read a single word of Doctor Cack's majestic works, indeed that he has\
    \ never read a single potato-related text in his entire sorry life."
