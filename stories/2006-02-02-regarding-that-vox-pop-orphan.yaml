  text: 'Ruth Pastry writes : Now look here, Key, I think you made up the Pang Hill
    orphan child in that so-called Vox Pop (30 January). Whoever named someone Sago?
    Sago is a sort of pudding, not a boy''s or girl''s name. Well, it''s the pith
    found inside the stems of some cycad plants, the pith that forms the basis of
    the pudding, rather than the pudding itself. The pith is first ground to a coarse
    flour, washed carefully to leach out natural toxins, then dried and cooked to
    become a starchy granular fecula. It is very similar to tapioca and is used for
    many of the same purposes. What it is most certainly not is a child''s name, orphaned
    or otherwise. Don''t try to give me any lessons about precision and exactitude.

    And another thing. It is not clear from your farrago of invented twaddle how old
    this tot is meant to be, but no one under the age of about a hundred and seven
    says things like "that is my story in its broad outlines". And there is not an
    "um" or "er" in sight. In short, the whole thing is frankly unbelievable and you
    should be ashamed of yourself for trying to deceive your loyal readers. Luckily,
    I am on hand to wrench the blinkers from their eyes and show you for the codswallop
    merchant you are.

    By the way, if you want a regular feature called "Dr Ruth Pastry Presents Five
    Hundred Sago Pudding Recipes For The Busy Hausfrau" I will be only too happy to
    oblige. Make out your cheque to "Dr Ruth Pastry Global Sago Pudding Enterprises
    plc". Passionately yours, Ruth Pastry.


    Dr Pastry''s letter was accompanied by this photograph, to which she supplied
    the following caption: "A spoon poised temptingly in a bowl of sago pudding pepared
    from one of Dr Ruth Pastry''s mouthwatering sago pudding recipes."'
