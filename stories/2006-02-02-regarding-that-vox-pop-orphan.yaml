  text: "Ruth Pastry writes : Now look here, Key, I think you made up the Pang Hill\
    \ orphan child in that so-called Vox Pop (30 January). Whoever named someone Sago?\
    \ Sago is a sort of pudding, not a boy's or girl's name. Well, it's the pith found\
    \ inside the stems of some cycad plants, the pith that forms the basis of the\
    \ pudding, rather than the pudding itself. The pith is first ground to a coarse\
    \ flour, washed carefully to leach out natural toxins, then dried and cooked to\
    \ become a starchy granular fecula. It is very similar to tapioca and is used\
    \ for many of the same purposes. What it is most certainly not is a child's name,\
    \ orphaned or otherwise. Don't try to give me any lessons about precision and\
    \ exactitude.\nAnd another thing. It is not clear from your farrago of invented\
    \ twaddle how old this tot is meant to be, but no one under the age of about a\
    \ hundred and seven says things like \u201Cthat is my story in its broad outlines\u201D\
    . And there is not an \u201Cum\u201D or \u201Cer\u201D in sight. In short, the\
    \ whole thing is frankly unbelievable and you should be ashamed of yourself for\
    \ trying to deceive your loyal readers. Luckily, I am on hand to wrench the blinkers\
    \ from their eyes and show you for the codswallop merchant you are.\nBy the way,\
    \ if you want a regular feature called \u201CDr Ruth Pastry Presents Five Hundred\
    \ Sago Pudding Recipes For The Busy Hausfrau\u201D I will be only too happy to\
    \ oblige. Make out your cheque to \u201CDr Ruth Pastry Global Sago Pudding Enterprises\
    \ plc\u201D. Passionately yours, Ruth Pastry.\n\nDr Pastry's letter was accompanied\
    \ by this photograph, to which she supplied the following caption: \u201CA spoon\
    \ poised temptingly in a bowl of sago pudding pepared from one of Dr Ruth Pastry's\
    \ mouthwatering sago pudding recipes.\u201D"
