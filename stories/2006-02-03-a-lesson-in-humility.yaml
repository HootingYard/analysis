  text: "Every now and then, when I think I may be getting too big for my boots, I\
    \ like to take a lesson in humility. I find that by contemplating the absurd Mr\
    \ and Mrs Fripp, those paragons of self-effacement, I am able to regain a more\
    \ judicious perspective on the world.\nMr Fripp is well known as the bespectacled\
    \ guitar noodler who had the gall to take a technique common in experimental music\
    \ of the 1950s and 60s (a tape delay and looped signal, basically) and call it\
    \ \u2018Frippertronics\u2019. That's like me writing a sonnet and saying it's\
    \ a new type of poem called a \u2018Keyet\u2019.\nMeanwhile, I am indebted to\
    \ the current edition of Private Eye for this splendid quotation from Mrs Fripp,\
    \ in answer to a question posed by Now magazine:\nQ\u2014What have you done with\
    \ all your punky stage outfits?\nA\u2014I have a house to keep my press cuttings,\
    \ costumes, head-dresses, stage make-up and books that refer to me. There's a\
    \ room of recordings of every TV show I've done and another full of fan mail.\n\
    John & Yoko only needed an apartment for the fur coats. Toyah requires a whole\
    \ house.\nAnd thanks to Max D\xE9charn\xE9 for alerting me to the existence of\
    \ the town of Toyah in Texas. The photograph below is captioned thus: Three wooden\
    \ grave markers stand as testament to the desolation of West Texas. Toyah was\
    \ a crew change point on the Texas & Pacific in the early 20th century. Like the\
    \ hot wind, the trains still blow through Toyah, but most of the citizenry moved\
    \ elsewhere. Who can blame them?\n"
