  text: 'Every now and then, when I think I may be getting too big for my boots, I
    like to take a lesson in humility. I find that by contemplating the absurd Mr
    and Mrs Fripp, those paragons of self-effacement, I am able to regain a more judicious
    perspective on the world.

    Mr Fripp is well known as the bespectacled guitar noodler who had the gall to
    take a technique common in experimental music of the 1950s and 60s (a tape delay
    and looped signal, basically) and call it ''Frippertronics''. That''s like me
    writing a sonnet and saying it''s a new type of poem called a ''Keyet''.

    Meanwhile, I am indebted to the current edition of Private Eye for this splendid
    quotation from Mrs Fripp, in answer to a question posed by Now magazine:

    Q--What have you done with all your punky stage outfits?

    A--I have a house to keep my press cuttings, costumes, head-dresses, stage make-up
    and books that refer to me. There''s a room of recordings of every TV show I''ve
    done and another full of fan mail.

    John & Yoko only needed an apartment for the fur coats. Toyah requires a whole
    house.

    And thanks to Max Decharne for alerting me to the existence of the town of Toyah
    in Texas. The photograph below is captioned thus: Three wooden grave markers stand
    as testament to the desolation of West Texas. Toyah was a crew change point on
    the Texas & Pacific in the early 20th century. Like the hot wind, the trains still
    blow through Toyah, but most of the citizenry moved elsewhere. Who can blame them?
