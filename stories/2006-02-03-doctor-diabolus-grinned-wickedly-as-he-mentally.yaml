  text: "\u201CDoctor Diabolus grinned wickedly as he mentally pictured the terror\
    \ that now was stalking the countryside. Every farmer within hearing of that siren\
    \ knew its import, realized that a dangerous inmate had escaped from the institution\
    \ for the criminal insane. Men were abandoning plows in the fields, hurrying to\
    \ their homes to get their rifles and shotguns. Children were fleeing to their\
    \ mothers, to hide in attics. Doors were being barricaded and savage hounds unleashed\
    \ to stand guard. There would be little sleeping in the country this coming night.\
    \ Not with the notoriously horrible Doctor Diabolus at large!\u201D \u2014 A E\
