  text: '"Doctor Diabolus grinned wickedly as he mentally pictured the terror that
    now was stalking the countryside. Every farmer within hearing of that siren knew
    its import, realized that a dangerous inmate had escaped from the institution
    for the criminal insane. Men were abandoning plows in the fields, hurrying to
    their homes to get their rifles and shotguns. Children were fleeing to their mothers,
    to hide in attics. Doors were being barricaded and savage hounds unleashed to
    stand guard. There would be little sleeping in the country this coming night.
    Not with the notoriously horrible Doctor Diabolus at large!" -- A E Apple, The
    Crime Devil'
