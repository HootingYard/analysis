    we do, here is episode ten in our not-quite-daily serialisation of The Immense
    Duckpond Pamphlet

    You are already aware that Jubble was unhinged. This had come to light very early
    in his days at the House, so long ago that no one--not even Blodgett--could recall
    precisely what had happened. There were occasional mutterings about a cravat and
    a thunderstorm, but nothing of substance.

    When Doctor Cack had arrived with his hideously food-splattered entourage, Jubble
    had ingratiated himself immediately. He helped the tuberologists to move into
    the Leaking Building, tirelessly destroying with his bazooka the piles of accumulated
    waste materials that had been stored there. He hung their hats up to dry after
    rainfall. He sharpened their pencils. There were other kindnesses.

    Within weeks, Doctor Cack had formally pronounced him as a bona fide assistant
    potato person. Jubble busied himself researching powdery scab, wireworm and spraing.
    He worked hard, and Doctor Cack began to trust him with the more outre aspects
    of potato science. But as the years passed, Jubble became ever more unhinged.

    He was often to be found in uproarious carousal with Euwige, the two of them pouring
    vast quantities of dandelion and burdock down their throats and singing inhuman
    songs. His moustache grew outlandish, and was forever smeared with lemon curd
    and other, sinister curds. He wore hawthorns in his hair, and carried tiny abominable
    homunculi in the pockets of his mackintosh. Doctor Cack had to have words with
    him on this score, for the potato scientist was not a man to tolerate orthodox
    raincoats.'
