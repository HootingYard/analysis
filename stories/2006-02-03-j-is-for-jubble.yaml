  text: "Hey hey we're some monkeys, and we're going to monkey around, but before\
    \ we do, here is episode ten in our not-quite-daily serialisation of The Immense\
    \ Duckpond Pamphlet\nYou are already aware that Jubble was unhinged. This had\
    \ come to light very early in his days at the House, so long ago that no one\u2014\
    not even Blodgett\u2014could recall precisely what had happened. There were occasional\
    \ mutterings about a cravat and a thunderstorm, but nothing of substance.\nWhen\
    \ Doctor Cack had arrived with his hideously food-splattered entourage, Jubble\
    \ had ingratiated himself immediately. He helped the tuberologists to move into\
    \ the Leaking Building, tirelessly destroying with his bazooka the piles of accumulated\
    \ waste materials that had been stored there. He hung their hats up to dry after\
    \ rainfall. He sharpened their pencils. There were other kindnesses.\nWithin weeks,\
    \ Doctor Cack had formally pronounced him as a bona fide assistant potato person.\
    \ Jubble busied himself researching powdery scab, wireworm and spraing. He worked\
    \ hard, and Doctor Cack began to trust him with the more outr\xE9 aspects of potato\
    \ science. But as the years passed, Jubble became ever more unhinged.\nHe was\
    \ often to be found in uproarious carousal with Euwige, the two of them pouring\
    \ vast quantities of dandelion and burdock down their throats and singing inhuman\
    \ songs. His moustache grew outlandish, and was forever smeared with lemon curd\
    \ and other, sinister curds. He wore hawthorns in his hair, and carried tiny abominable\
    \ homunculi in the pockets of his mackintosh. Doctor Cack had to have words with\
    \ him on this score, for the potato scientist was not a man to tolerate orthodox\
    \ raincoats."
