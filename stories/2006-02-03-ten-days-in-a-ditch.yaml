  text: "Sometimes you just have to go and lie down in a ditch. That's what I did\
    \ a week or so ago, and I have only just returned home. It is definitely time\
    \ for a bath, but I have to say that my ditchdom was thoroughly splendid in every\
    \ way.\nFor one thing, the ditch was a muddy one, muddy and puddle-strewn. And\
    \ such gorgeous puddles! I studied puddles in an academic context some years ago,\
    \ so I know, for example, that the Latin for puddle is lacusculus, which may more\
    \ accurately be translated as little pool, but will do for our present purposes.\
    \ Some of the lacusculi (or -ae) in my ditch were foul and deep. Others were shallow\
    \ little things, almost vestiges of puddle. Each one had its own character, and\
    \ I would have enjoyed counting them if I could remember how to count.\nDid you\
    \ notice how easily I said \u201Cmy ditch\u201D? I had not been lying in it for\
    \ very long before it lost its anonymity and became my treasured, if temporary,\
    \ possession, the way a medieval baron would boast of huge tracts of forest as\
    \ being his \u201Cpossessions\u201D. It was in medieval times that a map was made\
    \ of this area which shows some of the many ditches, and even gives them names.\
    \ Some of the ditches have vanished, of course, while new ones have come into\
    \ being, but there are a few that have existed for hundreds of years. I cannot\
    \ be sure whether the ditch I chose was called Bentley or Abercrombie, so I may\
    \ make a trip to the library to consult a facsimile of the old map after I have\
    \ had my bath.\nWhile I was lying in the ditch, I didn't give much thought to\
    \ its name. I admired the puddles, as I have said, and I looked at the sky, at\
    \ fugitive clouds, at birds in flight, particularly hummingbirds and wrens, for\
    \ I have always favoured smaller birds. Large birds terrify me. I fear being pecked,\
    \ and I begin to tremble. When I saw large birds overhead, I rolled over on to\
    \ my front and looked at the mud, or closed my eyes.\nWith eyes shut I sometimes\
    \ fell into a ditchy fitful sleep, but more often I allowed my mind to wander.\
    \ I have been preoccupied lately with the fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, having\
    \ found a whole stash of illustrated booklets about him underneath the sink in\
    \ the kitchen of my new set of rooms. Reading them avidly at a single sitting,\
    \ I had been perplexed to discover that as well as being a champion sprinter,\
    \ fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol had also won a number of medals and cups for\
    \ the pole-vault. Thus, I had to alter my mental image of him, and I admit I found\
    \ this difficult. For so long he had inhabited my brain breasting the tape after\
    \ a particularly gruelling sprint, a bit like the famous photograph of Roger Bannister\
    \ breaking the four minute mile at Iffley Road running track on the sixth of May\
    \ 1954 (see below). I say \u201Ca bit like\u201D because of course fictional athlete\
    \ Bobnit Tivol sported a huge beard, a piratical eyepatch, and often\u2014and\
    \ mysteriously\u2014had breadcrumbs in his hair. Nor should we forget that wherever\
    \ he ran, he always took his little gaggle of pet poultry with him, which would\
    \ wait, clucking, near the finishing line, much to the consternation of various\
    \ athletics officials in their spotless blazers, some of them with whistles on\
    \ lanyards around their necks, and some without.\n\nSo this was the eidolon of\
    \ fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol that I had cherished for years and years, and\
    \ now it had to be revised. I had to try to imagine him pole-vaulting. You may\
    \ now be able to appreciate why I spent ten days lying in that ditch, Bentley\
    \ or Abercrombie, without once getting bored. I will confess that I did not maintain\
    \ my concentration uninterrupted, for there were many distractions. Leaving aside\
    \ for a moment the birds, large and small, which I could see as they flew overhead,\
    \ there were earthworms, beetles, the occasional mole, just one ant, all by itself,\
    \ which had obviously strayed from its fellows, and a number of other life-forms\
    \ which I did not recognise or cannot remember. There were gusts of wind which\
    \ rippled the surfaces of the puddles. There was one spectacular rainstorm from\
    \ which I sheltered by intoning a spell. And then there was Codrington.\nI do\
    \ not wish to dwell upon Codrington, for to do so is very painful. Suffice it\
    \ to say that I cannot shake him off. He has been following me now for at least\
    \ seventeen years. I thought I was safe in my ditch, and for the first four days\
    \ I was. Then, at dawn on the fifth day, icy tentacles clawed at my heart as I\
    \ heard the unmistakeable sound of his humming, his footsteps, his creaking bones.\
    \ And there he was, clambering down into my ditch, squatting a few feet away from\
    \ me, his gleaming black boots submerged in one of my favourite puddles. He pretended\
    \ to ignore me, of course, as he always does. He hummed and creaked and creaked\
    \ and hummed. It took a titanic effort of will for me to remain lying in my ditch,\
    \ Bentley or Abercrombie, now supine, staring at the sky, and the birds in the\
    \ sky, now prone, my face in the mud, summoning the image of fictional athlete\
    \ Bobnit Tivol both sprinting and pole-vaulting, his poultry loyally at his side.\
    \ And I succeeded. Yesterday, on my last day in the ditch, that new image swam\
    \ before my eyes at the very moment that Codrington, with a final creak and hum,\
    \ stood up, hoisted himself out of the ditch, and stalked away across the fields,\
    \ frightening some cows as he passed, but allowing me some respite from his gruesome\
    \ presence.\nAnd now I am at home, and about to have a bath, and there is a mud-splattered\
    \ envelope addressed to me resting on the mantelpiece. I know that the handwriting\
    \ is Codrington's. He has left one of his communiqu\xE9s. Do I read it or set\
    \ fire to it? Or do I do neither, and go back to my ditch? What would fictional\
    \ athlete Bobnit Tivol have done? He shall be my guide."
