  text: 'In the words of Henry Gally in today''s quotation, I take pains to provide
    Hooting Yard readers with "the most agreeable, most instructive Entertainment
    that can possibly be desir''d". One way of doing this is to urge all of you to
    make yourselves a nice, piping hot cup of tea before sitting down to read the
    latest bulletins from Haemoglobin Towers. We know that "a nice cup of tea" is
    the perfect accompaniment to all human (and inhuman) activity, from perusing your
    favourite website, tracking down that out-of-print Dobson pamphlet, attending
    the Picnic For Detectives, observing pigs in a sty, or winning with Dick, to encountering
    Death on his pale horse, alongside War, Famine and Pestilence. Suggesting that
    you make your nice cup of tea piping hot is just a little touch I tend to add,
    to make things even more agreeable.

    But readers need more than tea to make the Hooting Yard experience truly gorgeous,
    as I learned the other day. I went out for a walk in the cow-riddled fields near
    the Blister Lane Bypass. There was a crowd of people massed by a churn. The sun
    was black, the moon was red, the stars were falling, the earth was trembling.
    And then the crowd, impossible to number, carrying flowers, shouted amid the hotless
    sun, the lightless moon, the windless earth, the colourless sky: "Frank, Frank,
    what we need is some sort of website, a blog even, that would act as a companion
    to Hooting Yard. It could be used for notes and queries, references, additional
    material, all sorts of excitements. If we had a resource like that, we would be
    better placed to devote our lives to the study of your work, instead of being
    distracted by fripperies!"

    I listened carefully, at least until that last bit, at which point I thought they
    were shouting about a bespectacled plectrum botherer, and I fled. The nearest
    place to hide from the roaring throng was a byre. I slumped on straw and gulped
    piping hot tea from my thermos flask. Overhead, the sky was suddenly filled with
    thousands upon thousands of migratory ducks. I do not know where they were migrating
    to, or from. They made such a din that I put blobs of putty in my ears. When I
    peered out from my shelter, I saw that the crowd had dispersed. I thought briefly
    about wheat. And then I trudged home, and scribbled down some ideas for the Hooting
    Yard Annexe. Come trudge with me now, and we shall pay a visit...'
