  text: "In the words of Henry Gally in today's quotation, I take pains to provide\
    \ Hooting Yard readers with \u201Cthe most agreeable, most instructive Entertainment\
    \ that can possibly be desir'd\u201D. One way of doing this is to urge all of\
    \ you to make yourselves a nice, piping hot cup of tea before sitting down to\
    \ read the latest bulletins from Haemoglobin Towers. We know that \u201Ca nice\
    \ cup of tea\u201D is the perfect accompaniment to all human (and inhuman) activity,\
    \ from perusing your favourite website, tracking down that out-of-print Dobson\
    \ pamphlet, attending the Picnic For Detectives, observing pigs in a sty, or winning\
    \ with Dick, to encountering Death on his pale horse, alongside War, Famine and\
    \ Pestilence. Suggesting that you make your nice cup of tea piping hot is just\
    \ a little touch I tend to add, to make things even more agreeable.\nBut readers\
    \ need more than tea to make the Hooting Yard experience truly gorgeous, as I\
    \ learned the other day. I went out for a walk in the cow-riddled fields near\
    \ the Blister Lane Bypass. There was a crowd of people massed by a churn. The\
    \ sun was black, the moon was red, the stars were falling, the earth was trembling.\
    \ And then the crowd, impossible to number, carrying flowers, shouted amid the\
    \ hotless sun, the lightless moon, the windless earth, the colourless sky: \u201C\
    Frank, Frank, what we need is some sort of website, a blog even, that would act\
    \ as a companion to Hooting Yard. It could be used for notes and queries, references,\
    \ additional material, all sorts of excitements. If we had a resource like that,\
    \ we would be better placed to devote our lives to the study of your work, instead\
    \ of being distracted by fripperies!\u201D\nI listened carefully, at least until\
    \ that last bit, at which point I thought they were shouting about a bespectacled\
    \ plectrum botherer, and I fled. The nearest place to hide from the roaring throng\
    \ was a byre. I slumped on straw and gulped piping hot tea from my thermos flask.\
    \ Overhead, the sky was suddenly filled with thousands upon thousands of migratory\
    \ ducks. I do not know where they were migrating to, or from. They made such a\
    \ din that I put blobs of putty in my ears. When I peered out from my shelter,\
    \ I saw that the crowd had dispersed. I thought briefly about wheat. And then\
    \ I trudged home, and scribbled down some ideas for the Hooting Yard Annexe. Come\
    \ trudge with me now, and we shall pay a visit\u2026"
