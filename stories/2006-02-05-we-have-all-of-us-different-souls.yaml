  text: '"We have all of us different Souls, and our Souls have Affections as different
    from one another, as our outward Faces are in their Lineaments. Each Man contains
    a little World within himself... By the help of this Knowledge an intelligent
    Writer can form to his Reader the most agreeable, most instructive Entertainment
    that can possibly be desir''d; transport him, with the greatest Ease imaginable,
    from the Solitude of his Chamber to Places of the greatest Concourse; there to
    see and learn the Virtues of Men; there to see and shun their Vices, without any
    danger of being corrupted by the Contagion of a real Commerce." -- Henry Gally,
    A Critical Essay On Characteristic-Writings'
