  text: "\u201CWe have all of us different Souls, and our Souls have Affections as\
    \ different from one another, as our outward Faces are in their Lineaments. Each\

    \ Entertainment that can possibly be desir'd; transport him, with the greatest\
    \ Ease imaginable, from the Solitude of his Chamber to Places of the greatest\

    \ Commerce.\u201D \u2014 Henry Gally, A Critical Essay On Characteristic-Writings"
