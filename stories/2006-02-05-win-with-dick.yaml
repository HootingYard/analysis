    For many, many years I have been puzzled by the item shown in this photograph.
    As you can see, it''s a box of cigars made out of bubblegum. Here is a list--by
    no means exhaustive--of some of the questions I have asked myself.

    What do you win? If you are winning "with Dick", has Dick already won? And if
    he has won, what did he win? Or do both of you have to win at the same time? Do
    you win a cigar made out of bubblegum, or the whole box? If that''s what you win,
    why do you have to pay five cents? Does your five cents payment entitle you to
    some sort of raffle ticket, or to entry in a tombola, for example? Has Dick already
    got a raffle ticket, or do you have to pay for his ticket in addition to yours,
    assuming that you get a ticket at all? Perhaps you have to pay five cents for
    Dick''s ticket, and then wait to find out if he wins just a single cigar made
    out of bubblegum or the entire box. If he wins the box, is he duty bound to share
    his prize with you? What if Dick doesn''t win? Have you just wasted your five
    cents on him, without the possibility of recompense?

    That toothsome grin of Dick''s--does he know something you don''t? Has he got
    the raffle or tombola all sewn up in advance? Is it seemly for him to take five
    cents from your palsied little hand if he already knows he''s going to get his
    hairy mitts on the whole box?

    Are the cigars made out of bubblegum imbued with a flavour, and if so, what is
    it? Tangerine? Strawberry? If the cigars made out of bubblegum are cigar-flavoured,
    you are likely to be sick, in which case you can hardly be described as a winner.
    This hardens the suspicion that Dick has a crafty plan up his sleeve, for if you
    hand over your five cents and win a cigar-flavoured cigar made of bubblegum and
    chew it to the point where you start vomiting, you will have won nothing but misery
    and nausea, whereas Dick will have won your money and perhaps a sense of Schadenfreude.
    No wonder he has a toothsome grin.
