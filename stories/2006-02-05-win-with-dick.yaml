  text: "\nFor many, many years I have been puzzled by the item shown in this photograph.\
    \ As you can see, it's a box of cigars made out of bubblegum. Here is a list\u2014\
    by no means exhaustive\u2014of some of the questions I have asked myself.\nWhat\
    \ do you win? If you are winning \u201Cwith Dick\u201D, has Dick already won?\
    \ And if he has won, what did he win? Or do both of you have to win at the same\
    \ time? Do you win a cigar made out of bubblegum, or the whole box? If that's\
    \ what you win, why do you have to pay five cents? Does your five cents payment\
    \ entitle you to some sort of raffle ticket, or to entry in a tombola, for example?\
    \ Has Dick already got a raffle ticket, or do you have to pay for his ticket in\
    \ addition to yours, assuming that you get a ticket at all? Perhaps you have to\
    \ pay five cents for Dick's ticket, and then wait to find out if he wins just\
    \ a single cigar made out of bubblegum or the entire box. If he wins the box,\
    \ is he duty bound to share his prize with you? What if Dick doesn't win? Have\
    \ you just wasted your five cents on him, without the possibility of recompense?\n\
    That toothsome grin of Dick's\u2014does he know something you don't? Has he got\
    \ the raffle or tombola all sewn up in advance? Is it seemly for him to take five\
    \ cents from your palsied little hand if he already knows he's going to get his\
    \ hairy mitts on the whole box?\nAre the cigars made out of bubblegum imbued with\
    \ a flavour, and if so, what is it? Tangerine? Strawberry? If the cigars made\
    \ out of bubblegum are cigar-flavoured, you are likely to be sick, in which case\
    \ you can hardly be described as a winner. This hardens the suspicion that Dick\
    \ has a crafty plan up his sleeve, for if you hand over your five cents and win\
    \ a cigar-flavoured cigar made of bubblegum and chew it to the point where you\
    \ start vomiting, you will have won nothing but misery and nausea, whereas Dick\
    \ will have won your money and perhaps a sense of Schadenfreude. No wonder he\
    \ has a toothsome grin.\nNext week : Win With Spiro Agnew"
