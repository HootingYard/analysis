  text: "Today, my thoughts turn to custard. I do not mean by this that my brain is\
    \ curdling into mush, though that may well happen as the day goes on. This is,\
    \ after all, early 21st century Britain, and I am assailed by twaddle and pap\
    \ wherever I look. It would not be surprising if I succumbed to it and began to\
    \ gibber and drool.\nThat is why I have concentrated my mind on custard. Let us\
    \ recall the words of Ned Ward (1667-1731), who wrote \u201CCustard, that noble\
    \ cooling Food, / So toothsome, wholesome and so good, / That Dainty so approv'd\
    \ of old, / Whose yellow surface shines like Gold\u201D. Ward was a poet and a\
    \ publican, described as follows in Volume IX of the first edition of The Cambridge\
    \ History of English and American Literature: \u201CHe was no wizard, but a pedestrian\
    \ jogtrot writer of doggerel, whom criticism could not affright nor opposition\
    \ baulk. Yet his Hudibras is a wonderful achievement. Its facile fluent ease marks\
    \ the versifier who could write two hundred lines standing on one foot. His language\
    \ is common enough. Neither Brown nor Motteux surpasses him in knowledge of the\
    \ slang which was heard in the tavern or at the street corner. Had he lived today,\
    \ he might have been an ornament of the sporting press. Living when he did, he\
    \ supported the cause of church and state in such couplets as jingled in the brain,\
    \ and tripped readily to the tongue.\u201D\n\nNed Ward\nThe custard-soaked quotation\
    \ is from Ward's British Wonders : Or, A Poetical Description of the Several Prodigies\
    \ and Most Remarkable Accidents That have happen'd in Britain since the Death\
    \ of Queen Anne (1717). (Incidentally, do you lament, as I do, the passing of\
    \ long, even unwieldy book-titles? Nowadays everything has to be snappy and memorable,\
    \ presumably so it can be marketed by zonk-eyed bean-counters. If someone published\
    \ a history of ink today, it would no doubt be called Ink!, with the obligatory\
    \ subtitle The Liquid That Changed The World. When David N Carvalho addressed\
    \ the topic in 1904, his book had the majestic title Forty Centuries Of Ink, Or\
    \ A Chronological Narrative Concerning Ink And Its Backgrounds, Introducing Incidental\
    \ Observations And Deductions, Parallels Of Time And Colour Phenomena, Bibliography,\
    \ Chemistry, Poetical Effusions, Citations, Anecdotes And Curiosa Together With\
    \ Some Evidence Respecting The Evanescent Character Of Most Inks Of Today And\
    \ An Epitome Of Chemico-Legal Ink. Ah, those were the days.)\nInk, custard. Could\
    \ custard ever be called The Yellow Goo That Changed the World? Possibly not.\
    \ It is difficult to think of any earth-shattering events in which custard has\
    \ played a pivotal role, or indeed any role at all. I know that I could make some\
    \ up, if I so desired, but I am not going to, not today anyway, for today it seems\
    \ important to cleave to the truth.\nWhat is custard, anyway? According to the\
    \ wikipedia, it is a family of preparations based on milk and eggs, thickened\
    \ with heat. Most commonly, it refers to a dessert or dessert sauce, but custard\
    \ bases are also used for quiches and other savoury foods. Depending on how much\
    \ egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring\
    \ sauce to a thick blancmange. Most custard is cooked in a double boiler (bain-marie)\
    \ or heated very gently on the stove in a saucepan, but custard can also be steamed\
    \ or baked in the oven with or without a hot water bath. Instant and ready-made\
    \ \u2018custards\u2019 are also marketed, though they are not true custards if\
    \ they are not thickened with egg. I think we can agree that only true custard\
    \ is worthy of our attention, particularly on this day devoted to truth.\nReaders\
    \ may wonder why, today of all days, I am so insistent on truth-telling. My reasons,\
    \ I should say, are entirely non-custard-related. Exactly forty eight years ago,\
    \ on the sixth of February 1958, the Busby Babes\u2014the flower of post-war British\
    \ football\u2014were wiped out in the Munich Air Disaster. Hang your head in their\
    \ memory for a moment before continuing to read.\n\nThe Busby Babes boarding the\
    \ fatal aeroplane\nOh, come on, hang your head a bit longer than that!\nI have\
    \ never cared a jot about football myself, but my Uncle Ned was a fierce adherent\
    \ of the sport. (Ned was not named after Ned Ward, by the way, in case you were\
    \ wondering.) Deeply affected by the tragedy that unfolded at that blizzard-wracked\
    \ German airfield, Ned cajoled our whole extended family into joining him in his\
    \ annual remembrance of the crash. Throughout my childhood\u2014throughout my\
    \ life\u2014the sixth of February has been the most significant day of the year.\
    \ It means more to me than Christmas, or Easter, or even my birthday. I can blithely\
    \ let feast days and holy days pass unremarked. You will find me unmoved on National\
    \ Potato Day (29th January), Penguin Awareness Day (20th January) and National\
    \ Punctuation Day (24th September). Yet the shade of dead Uncle Ned hovers over\
    \ me on this day, and perhaps it is in homage to him, rather than to those lost\
    \ young footballers, that I promise to speak only the truth, from midnight to\
    \ midnight.\n\nThomas More\nAnd that is why I write only of true custard, not\
    \ of the wretched synthetic slop that seeks to deceive the custard-innocent palate.\
    \ We would do well to remember here that Thomas More's wife (or was it his daughter?)\
    \ took custards to him when he was imprisoned by King Henry VIII. Those would\
    \ have been true custards, without a doubt. Admittedly, my source is semi-fictional,\
    \ being an ill-remembered reading of Robert Bolt's play A Man For All Seasons.\
    \ What is clear in my memory is that this was my first encounter with the construction\
    \ \u201Ca custard\u201D, as opposed to \u201Csome custard\u201D or \u201Ca bowl\
    \ of custard\u201D or, of course, simply \u201Ccustard\u201D. I was about fourteen\
    \ years old at the time, given the play to read as part of my schoolwork, and\
    \ all I recall of it is the curious fascination I felt for that indefinite article.\
    \ \u201CA custard\u201D! It was so unexpected, it made me think of custard in\
    \ a new way. I tried to visualise what this centuries-old custard would have looked\
    \ like. If it was not in a bowl or a dish, it must have some solid form. Was it\
    \ wrapped up in a bag, a bag of wool or burlap? Years passed before I learned\
    \ that the very word \u201Ccustard\u201D is derived from \u201Ccrustade\u201D\
    \ which is a tart with a crust. So doomed Thomas More's custards would have been\
    \ encased in pastry, I surmise.\n\nPierre Bonnard\nOne final note, not exactly\
    \ about custard, but about yellow, the colour of custard. However pale it may\
    \ be, true custard has at least a yellow tinge. The French painter Pierre Bonnard\
    \ once remarked \u201CAh, yellow! I can't get enough of it!\u201D Readers, can\
    \ you say the same for custard?"
