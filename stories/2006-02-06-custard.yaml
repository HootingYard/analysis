  text: 'Today, my thoughts turn to custard. I do not mean by this that my brain is
    curdling into mush, though that may well happen as the day goes on. This is, after
    all, early 21st century Britain, and I am assailed by twaddle and pap wherever
    I look. It would not be surprising if I succumbed to it and began to gibber and
    drool.

    That is why I have concentrated my mind on custard. Let us recall the words of
    Ned Ward (1667-1731), who wrote "Custard, that noble cooling Food, / So toothsome,
    wholesome and so good, / That Dainty so approv''d of old, / Whose yellow surface
    shines like Gold". Ward was a poet and a publican, described as follows in Volume
    IX of the first edition of The Cambridge History of English and American Literature:
    "He was no wizard, but a pedestrian jogtrot writer of doggerel, whom criticism
    could not affright nor opposition baulk. Yet his Hudibras is a wonderful achievement.
    Its facile fluent ease marks the versifier who could write two hundred lines standing
    on one foot. His language is common enough. Neither Brown nor Motteux surpasses
    him in knowledge of the slang which was heard in the tavern or at the street corner.
    Had he lived today, he might have been an ornament of the sporting press. Living
    when he did, he supported the cause of church and state in such couplets as jingled
    in the brain, and tripped readily to the tongue."


    Ned Ward

    The custard-soaked quotation is from Ward''s British Wonders : Or, A Poetical
    Description of the Several Prodigies and Most Remarkable Accidents That have happen''d
    in Britain since the Death of Queen Anne (1717). (Incidentally, do you lament,
    as I do, the passing of long, even unwieldy book-titles? Nowadays everything has
    to be snappy and memorable, presumably so it can be marketed by zonk-eyed bean-counters.
    If someone published a history of ink today, it would no doubt be called Ink!,
    with the obligatory subtitle The Liquid That Changed The World. When David N Carvalho
    addressed the topic in 1904, his book had the majestic title Forty Centuries Of
    Ink, Or A Chronological Narrative Concerning Ink And Its Backgrounds, Introducing
    Incidental Observations And Deductions, Parallels Of Time And Colour Phenomena,
    Bibliography, Chemistry, Poetical Effusions, Citations, Anecdotes And Curiosa
    Together With Some Evidence Respecting The Evanescent Character Of Most Inks Of
    Today And An Epitome Of Chemico-Legal Ink. Ah, those were the days.)

    Ink, custard. Could custard ever be called The Yellow Goo That Changed the World?
    Possibly not. It is difficult to think of any earth-shattering events in which
    custard has played a pivotal role, or indeed any role at all. I know that I could
    make some up, if I so desired, but I am not going to, not today anyway, for today
    it seems important to cleave to the truth.

    What is custard, anyway? According to the wikipedia, it is a family of preparations
    based on milk and eggs, thickened with heat. Most commonly, it refers to a dessert
    or dessert sauce, but custard bases are also used for quiches and other savoury
    foods. Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency
    from a thin pouring sauce to a thick blancmange. Most custard is cooked in a double
    boiler (bain-marie) or heated very gently on the stove in a saucepan, but custard
    can also be steamed or baked in the oven with or without a hot water bath. Instant
    and ready-made ''custards'' are also marketed, though they are not true custards
    if they are not thickened with egg. I think we can agree that only true custard
    is worthy of our attention, particularly on this day devoted to truth.

    Readers may wonder why, today of all days, I am so insistent on truth-telling.
    My reasons, I should say, are entirely non-custard-related. Exactly forty eight
    years ago, on the sixth of February 1958, the Busby Babes--the flower of post-war
    British football--were wiped out in the Munich Air Disaster. Hang your head in
    their memory for a moment before continuing to read.


    The Busby Babes boarding the fatal aeroplane

    Oh, come on, hang your head a bit longer than that!

    I have never cared a jot about football myself, but my Uncle Ned was a fierce
    adherent of the sport. (Ned was not named after Ned Ward, by the way, in case
    you were wondering.) Deeply affected by the tragedy that unfolded at that blizzard-wracked
    German airfield, Ned cajoled our whole extended family into joining him in his
    annual remembrance of the crash. Throughout my childhood--throughout my life--the
    sixth of February has been the most significant day of the year. It means more
    to me than Christmas, or Easter, or even my birthday. I can blithely let feast
    days and holy days pass unremarked. You will find me unmoved on National Potato
    Day (29th January), Penguin Awareness Day (20th January) and National Punctuation
    Day (24th September). Yet the shade of dead Uncle Ned hovers over me on this day,
    and perhaps it is in homage to him, rather than to those lost young footballers,
    that I promise to speak only the truth, from midnight to midnight.


    Thomas More

    And that is why I write only of true custard, not of the wretched synthetic slop
    that seeks to deceive the custard-innocent palate. We would do well to remember
    here that Thomas More''s wife (or was it his daughter?) took custards to him when
    he was imprisoned by King Henry VIII. Those would have been true custards, without
    a doubt. Admittedly, my source is semi-fictional, being an ill-remembered reading
    of Robert Bolt''s play A Man For All Seasons. What is clear in my memory is that
    this was my first encounter with the construction "a custard", as opposed to "some
    custard" or "a bowl of custard" or, of course, simply "custard". I was about fourteen
    years old at the time, given the play to read as part of my schoolwork, and all
    I recall of it is the curious fascination I felt for that indefinite article.
    "A custard"! It was so unexpected, it made me think of custard in a new way. I
    tried to visualise what this centuries-old custard would have looked like. If
    it was not in a bowl or a dish, it must have some solid form. Was it wrapped up
    in a bag, a bag of wool or burlap? Years passed before I learned that the very
    word "custard" is derived from "crustade" which is a tart with a crust. So doomed
    Thomas More''s custards would have been encased in pastry, I surmise.


    Pierre Bonnard

    One final note, not exactly about custard, but about yellow, the colour of custard.
    However pale it may be, true custard has at least a yellow tinge. The French painter
    Pierre Bonnard once remarked "Ah, yellow! I can''t get enough of it!" Readers,
    can you say the same for custard?'
