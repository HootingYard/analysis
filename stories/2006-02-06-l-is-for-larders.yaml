    The tins of soup were stored in a plethora of larders dotted throughout the House.
    Although the location of each larder seemed random--two adjacent here, another
    just down the corridor and around the corner, one tiny, solitary larder in the
    west wing--in fact they were distributed according to a system so stupendous and
    abstruse that only Mrs Purgative understood it. Blodgett claimed to, and no one
    was confident enough of their own knowledge to challenge him.

    Aminadab, having arrived at the House only hours before, was unaware that there
    was even a system in the first place. All he knew for certain was that he was
    slumped, queasy with exhaustion, on the floor of a larder stacked floor to ceiling
    with soup tins marked "Number Three". He had given up the quest for Euwige. Half
    his luggage had been abandoned somewhere back in an ill-lit corridor which stank
    of porridge, though there was no porridge to be found in it. He still had the
    other half of his belongings with him, and was rummaging frantically in one of
    his satchels for the bag of gob-stoppers he had packed at the start of his journey,
    three weeks ago.

    As his trembling fingers lit at last upon the crumpled bag, he heard footsteps
    approaching. Lurching to his feet, he threw open the door of the larder in desperation.
    Had Euwige come to rescue him?'
