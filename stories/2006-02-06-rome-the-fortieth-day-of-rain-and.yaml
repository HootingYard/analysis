  text: '"Rome! the fortieth day of rain, and damp, and abominable reeking odours,
    such as blessed cities swept by the sea-breeze--bitter sometimes, yet indeed a
    friend--never know. It has been dark all day, though the lamp has only been lit
    half an hour. The music of the day has been, first the atrocious arias, which
    last in the Corso till near noon, though certainly less in virulence on rainy
    days. Then came the wicked organ-grinder, who, apart from the horror of the noise,
    grinds exactly the same obsolete abominations as at home or in England." -- Margaret
