  text: '"About an hour before the ship was to leave her moorings, I went on board
    and made my way at once to the stateroom which I was to share with a fellow passenger,
    whose acquaintance I then made for the first time. He was a tall cadaverous young
    man of about my own age, and my first view of him was not encouraging, for when
    I came in, I found him rolling restlessly on the cabin floor, and uttering hollow
    groans. ''This will never do,'' I said... He explained, somewhat brusquely, that
    he was suffering from mental agony, not seasickness." -- F Anstey, The Curse Of
    The Catafalques'
