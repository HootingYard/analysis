  text: "\u201CAbout an hour before the ship was to leave her moorings, I went on\
    \ board and made my way at once to the stateroom which I was to share with a fellow\
    \ passenger, whose acquaintance I then made for the first time. He was a tall\
    \ cadaverous young man of about my own age, and my first view of him was not encouraging,\
    \ for when I came in, I found him rolling restlessly on the cabin floor, and uttering\
    \ hollow groans. \u2018This will never do,\u2019 I said\u2026 He explained, somewhat\
    \ brusquely, that he was suffering from mental agony, not seasickness.\u201D \u2014\
