  text: "It was, he thought, a very elegant smudge, as smudges go.\n\u201CLook at\
    \ this smudge,\u201D he said to his companion, pointing at the smudge with his\
    \ forefinger, \u201CDo you not think it elegant?\u201D\nHis companion looked at\
    \ the smudge, tossed her head, and then fixed him with an inscrutable gaze.\n\u201C\
    You do not think it elegant?\u201D he said, as a beetle crawled out of his tousled\
    \ hair and launched itself into the shimmering air. It was a flying beetle.\n\
    So begins one of Dobson's few attempts at writing fiction. And so, too, does it\
    \ end, for he never wrote another word of what, only that morning, he had confided\
    \ to his diary was to be \u201Ca brilliant money-spinning scheme\u2026 I will\
    \ write a potboiler, a guaranteed bestseller, a novel of triumph over adversity,\
    \ with a dashing hero and a sultry heroine, a helter skelter adventure of international\
    \ intrigue, high finance, technological wizardry and scrupulously-researched background\
    \ detail. It cannot fail!\u201D\nHe scribbled those last three words with such\
    \ vim that he rent the paper in his journal, and it was thick, creamy paper to\
    \ boot, not easily rent. Forensic Dobsonist Jim Pond sees the rending as evidence\
    \ of just how excited the out-of-print pamphleteer was on that March morning of\
    \ glistening torrential showers and fractious gales.\n\u201CDobson often lost\
    \ all sense of reason when hatching a new scheme,\u201D writes Mr Pond in a new\
    \ article*, \u201Cbut seldom can he have been so deluded as this. For at least\
    \ four hours on that rain-mad March morning he seems to have been utterly convinced\
    \ that the novel he called Elegant Smudges would not only be bought in the millions\
    \ by an adoring public, but that he would actually write the damned thing in the\
    \ first place.\u201D\nAs is evident from the opening\u2014and only\u2014lines\
    \ Dobson managed to jot down, the brilliant pamphleteer was a hopeless fictioneer.\
    \ Mr Pond has unearthed a few working notes that Dobson made in the hours between\
    \ his paper-rending journal entry and the abandoned beginning of the novel. \u201C\
    I think we are lucky,\u201D he writes, \u201Cthat Dobson stopped when he did,\
    \ flung his pencil across the room, and strode out of the house in his big Canadian\
    \ Forestry Service boots to enjoy the downpour.\u201D\nAccording to Mr Pond, Dobson\
    \ was under the impression that a series of fifty-nine chapters, in each of which\
    \ two unnamed protagonists examine a smudge, and disagree as to whether or not\
    \ the smudge is elegant, constituted the makings of an unputdownable novel. Granted,\
    \ each chapter was to be set in a different milieu, the smudges, elegant or otherwise,\
    \ to be found in a bewildering variety of locations, but as Mr Pond points out,\
    \ Dobson's notes list only \u201Cinternational airport\u201D and \u201Cmunicipal\
    \ bus depot\u201D. Where the other fifty-seven smudges were to be is, as Alexander\
    \ Scriabin might have put it, a Mysterium**. And did Dobson really think that\
    \ readers would be turning the pages, breathless with excitement, awaiting the\
    \ appearance in each chapter of a flying beetle?\nMeteorological records for that\
    \ day in March indicate that the teeming rainfall lasted until well into the afternoon.\
    \ Having cast aside his pencil, and his aborted novel, Dobson, as we have seen,\
    \ headed out into the soaking wet world. He returned, drenched of course, some\
    \ hours later, having somehow managed to obtain certain obscure pastries from\
    \ an unknown pie shop. These diverted his attention for the rest of the day, and\
    \ by the time he collapsed in an exhausted heap onto his mattress of straw, the\
    \ elegant smudges were forgotten.\nIn an infuriating addendum to his article,\
    \ Mr Pond notes that the word smudge only occurs once more in the corpus of the\
    \ pamphleteer's work, but he does not tell us where. This sort of thing makes\
    \ my blood boil, so I am going to go out and throw things at squirrels until I\
    \ have calmed down.\n* NOTE : \u201CDobson And His Fleeting Fads\u201D in The\
