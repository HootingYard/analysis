  text: 'And so we reach the half-way mark in our serial story, The Immense Duckpond
    Pamphlet, which began with A Is For Aminadab on 23 January

    Moop''s shoes had been shoved into a red plastic basin on the floor underneath
    her sink. Each tuberologist had their own sink. Doctor Cack had insisted upon
    it.

    Moop did not use her sink very often. She was more of a field worker, scurrying
    about the grounds armed with a plethora of ludicrous scientific equipment, trailing
    wires and mulverts behind her as she darted from potato patch to potato patch,
    scribbling drivel into her notebook with an exciting new propelling pencil.

    She was a sly one, was Moop. She wrote in Glagolitic script to safeguard her memoranda
    from prying eyes. Several of her projects had only a tangential relationship to
    Doctor Cack''s researches. Had he but known!'
