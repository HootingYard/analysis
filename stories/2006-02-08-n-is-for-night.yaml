  text: "Yea, verily I say unto you, this is episode fourteen of The Immense Duckpond\
    \ Pamphlet\nHigh above the House, fat stars sparkled in the firmament. Unimaginable\
    \ life-forms howled and howled in the darkness. Colonies of nocturnal insects\
    \ hovered in the air at human-head height, buzzing and twanging. Blodgett patrolled\
    \ the ground floor, rattling a monstrous collection of keys, slamming doors shut,\
    \ sounding the tocsins, testing the shutters, checking his fly-traps.\nAs he passed\
    \ the Room of Distressed Wooden Bitterns, he heard the unmistakeable sound of\
    \ Euwige and Jubble, slurping and belching. They had locked themselves in, of\
    \ course, and barred the door with one of the dandelion and burdock barrels, from\
    \ which they would drink until they were as gassy as gassy could be. Blodgett\
    \ loathed them.\nOn the floor above, in one of the larders, Aminadab was embroiled\
    \ in a fervent debate with Trellis, who had come upon him quite by accident. After\
    \ some initial hesitation, they had discovered a mutual interest in\u2014oh, something\
    \ or other. Beetles, poisonous golden toads, David Blunkett, the darning of frayed\
    \ flags, it could have been anything, it hardly matters, it's all so tiresome.\
    \ You may as well be reading a penitential tract by a, by a horse for all the\
    \ good it will do you. Night has fallen about the House under the twinkling stars.\
    \ That will do."
