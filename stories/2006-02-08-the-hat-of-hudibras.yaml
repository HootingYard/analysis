  text: "Thanks to the catechists, you now have a glimmer of insight into the history\
    \ of hats. At least you have if you have bothered to read the quote of the day\
    \ above. I can therefore draw your attention to a particular hat, confident that\
    \ you will be better placed to appreciate it than you were when you woke up this\
    \ morning, unless of course you are a hatter or hat historian or are otherwise\
    \ hat-learn\xE9d, in which case I ask that you forgive my presumption, and bear\
    \ in mind that not all Hooting Yard readers are armed with the same level of hat-learning\
    \ as you.\nThe hat to which I refer you is the hat of Hudibras, as depicted in\
    \ one of William Hogarth's illustrations to Hudibras, written by Samuel Butler\
    \ and published in three volumes between 1663 and 1678. Here is the hat\n\nand\
    \ here is the complete illustration, which repays close study.\nHudibras is a\
    \ satire on the Puritans, written in mock-heroic tetrameter couplets (which became\
    \ known as hudibrasticks). The title character and his squire Ralpho are the closest\
    \ equivalents in English to Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. You may wish to hurl\
    \ your copy of Celebrity Pap! on to flaming coals and read Hudibras instead, by\
    \ going to the admirably straightforward Ex-Classics website.\nSamuel Butler (1612-1680)\
    \ is described on his tombstone as \u201Ca needy wretch\u201D. (That will suit\
    \ me splendidly when the dread day comes\u2014undertakers please note.) The Hudibras\
    \ by Ned Ward mentioned on Monday (see Custard, below) refers to his Hudibras\
    \ Redivivus, of which he wrote \u201CTho' I have made bold to borrow a Title from\
    \ one of the best poems that ever was published in the English Tongue\u2014yet\
    \ I would not have the world expect me such a wizard as to conjure up the spirit\
    \ of the inimitable Butler.\u201D Poor Ned, the world did not.\nHudibrasticks\
    \ is (are?) long overdue for a revival. It seems appropriate to give you a brief\
    \ quotation so that you can devise your own hudibrastick verse, and happily Butler\
    \ writes of the yellow goo we were concerned with earlier in the week:\nRather\
    \ than fail, they will defy / That which they love most tenderly; / Quarrel with\
    \ minc'd-pies, and disparage / Their best and dearest friend, plum-porridge; /\
    \ Fat pig and goose itself oppose, / And blaspheme custard through the nose.\n\
    Being of a puritanical bent, I am now going to go and blaspheme custard. You can\
    \ take a closer look at the hat."
