  text: '"When did Hats come into general use? The first mention made of hats is about
    the time of the Saxons, but they were not worn except by the rich. Hats for men
    were invented at Paris, by a Swiss, in 1404. About the year 1510, they were first
    manufactured in London, by Spaniards. Before that time both men and women in England
    commonly wore close, knitted, woollen caps. It is related, that when Charles the
    Second made his public entry into Rouen, in 1449, he wore a hat lined with red
    velvet, surmounted with a plume or tuft of feathers; from which entry, or at least
    during his reign, the use of hats and caps is to be dated. Where is Rouen? In
    the province of Lower Seine, in France." -- Benziger Brothers, A Catechism Of
    Familiar Things, Their History, And The Events Which Led To Their Discovery'
