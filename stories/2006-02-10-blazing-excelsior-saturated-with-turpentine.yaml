  text: 'The best way to illuminate the pitch black Pit of Doom is to toss into it
    some blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine. But that is not as easy as it
    sounds, mark my words.

    I have long argued that the Pit of Doom becomes less doom-laden when illumined,
    despite the craven voices of my opponents, and they are many. They have used the
    correspondence columns of many distinguished journals to attack my views, and
    I have until now refrained from answering their charges. They are a hectic bunch
    of cowards, ignoramuses, and pond-life, and I have had better things to do with
    my time. Why then, you might ask, do I now deign to respond to them? I have no
    intention of answering that question, but perhaps all will become clear to you
    as you read on. Or not.

    What I would like to do is to demonstrate how you can illumine the Pit of Doom
    yourself, using blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine. By following my instructions
    carefully, you will be able to reach your own decision regarding the doominess
    of the Pit once it is illumined. My hope is that you will agree with me that it
    is stripped of much, if not all, of its Doom once lit.

    First of all, of course, you need to locate the Pit of Doom. There are many pits
    which seemingly fit the bill, and many of them are shrouded in doominess, being
    bleak, unforgiving, dank, dark and hideous to behold. One of Dobson''s out of
    print pamphlets attempted to catalogue the pits in a huge geographical area which
    might qualify as doom-laden, and it was an impressive piece of work, but the pamphleteer
    overlooked the fact that when one stands on the brink of the Pit of Doom itself,
    all doubts vanish. There is a curdling of the guts that tells you exactly where
    you are. No other pit comes close. This, you say to yourself, peering into the
    pitch black maw of the Pit of Doom, this indeed is the Pit of Doom. You teeter
    on the edge, terrified of losing your balance, every nerve in your body ready
    to snap. But you step back, if you are me, anyway, and resolve to banish doom
    by the simple agency of blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine.

    And that is your next challenge. Having located the Pit of Doom, you must now
    get your hands on excelsior, turpentine, and a box of matches, or some equivalent
    means of ignition. And so you turn your back on the Pit of Doom, almost insolently,
    and you stride across the moors to the little hovel you noted earlier, and you
    rap your knuckles on the door.

    You are expecting a snag-toothed peasant person to answer your rapping, and so
    you are momentarily disconcerted when the hovel-door creaks open and you are confronted
    by a winsome young woman who bears a striking resemblance to Tuesday Weld.

    "Greetings," you manage to say, "I come in search of excelsior, turpentine, and
    a means of ignition."

    "Then you have come to the right place," says the Tuesday Weld-like woman, "For
    here in my hovel I have all those things."

    She ushers you inside, and you are stunned by the interior, which is done out
    with much velvet and satin and silk, with vases of cut flowers, with space-age
    plastic furniture in a dazzle of colours, all bathed in an unearthly shimmering
    light. You are mesmerised by this light. Entire days pass by, of which you are
    unconscious, for you have been captivated by a woohoo woman who is rearranging
    your brain cells one by one, for purposes either malignant or beneficial, depending
    on what kind of woohoo woman she is. When you wake from your entrancement, you
    find that she has placed in your hands a bag of excelsior, a bottle of turpentine,
    and a box of lucifers. You have been fortunate. She is a woohoo woman devoted
    to good.

    "Go now," she says, "And do what you must do."

    You are not aware that your brain has been tampered with, nor indeed that you
    have been entranced. You step out of the light, out of the hovel, and make your
    way across the moors to the Pit of Doom.

    Crouching near its edge, you open the bag of excelsior. It is imperative that
    you check that it is uninhabited, for hamsters sleep all curled and comfortable
    in excelsior, as do hibernating tortoises, and other creatures, excepting those
    whose domain is the sea. You rummage through the excelsior until you are completely
    satisfied that it is innocent of life, hamster or otherwise. Then you open the
    bottle of turpentine and pour in such an amount that the excelsior is saturated.
    Then you seal the bag to ensure that the turpentine does not evaporate. Then you
    set fire to it with one of the lucifers, and then you toss it into the Pit of
    Doom.

    Now you step even closer to the edge, and you peer down into what was until a
    moment ago an evil, pitch black vent into the underworld, but now is lit. What
    do you see?

    I could tell you what I saw, on the day last September that I illumined the Pit
    of Doom with blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine. I could speak of the
    unimaginable horrors I saw, writhing in terror of the light, of the howling that
    beset my ears. I could, had I too not had my brain jimmied by the very same Tuesday
    Weldish woohoo woman, whose mercy means that everything I saw or heard in the
    Pit of Doom, lit by blazing excelsior, is forgotten, forevermore, for now I bask
    in that shimmering light, dressed in my peasant''s smock, chewing on a piece of
    straw, at long last the idiot I always hankered to be.'
