  text: "\u201CHaving first tested the air and proved it good by dropping in blazing\
    \ excelsior saturated with turpentine, a stout oak stick was attached to the end\
    \ of the rope\u2026 The sensation was strange and exhilarating. Looking up I could\
    \ only see the small opening I came through, and a straggling stream of light\
    \ poured down that, but on all sides profound darkness reigned supreme.\u201D\
