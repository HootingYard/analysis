  text: '"Having first tested the air and proved it good by dropping in blazing excelsior
    saturated with turpentine, a stout oak stick was attached to the end of the rope...
    The sensation was strange and exhilarating. Looking up I could only see the small
    opening I came through, and a straggling stream of light poured down that, but
    on all sides profound darkness reigned supreme." -- Luella Agnes Owen, Cave Regions
    Of the Ozarks And Black Hills'
