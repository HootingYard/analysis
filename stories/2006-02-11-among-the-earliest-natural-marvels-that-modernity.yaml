  text: '"Among the earliest natural marvels that modernity inherited from the Middle
    Ages were embalmed crocodiles, brought to a wide-eyed Europe as part of the Crusaders''
    loot and promptly ''baptized'' as miracles by the Church in an attempt to diffuse
    the growing popularity of bizarre phenomena. Torn away from their original context
    and endowed with a symbolism that rendered them a product of divine intervention,
    the crocodiles were tied with chains and hung from church ceilings... where they
    acted both as signs of the mysteries of divine power and as guardians that could
    thwart all other evils." -- Celeste Olalquiaga, The Artificial Kingdom : A Treasury
    Of The Kitsch Experience, With Remarkable Objects Of Art And Nature, Extraordinary
    Events, Eccentric Biography And Original Theory, Plus Many Wonderful Illustrations
