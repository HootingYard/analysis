  text: "\u201CAmong the earliest natural marvels that modernity inherited from the\
    \ Middle Ages were embalmed crocodiles, brought to a wide-eyed Europe as part\
    \ of the Crusaders' loot and promptly \u2018baptized\u2019 as miracles by the\
    \ Church in an attempt to diffuse the growing popularity of bizarre phenomena.\
    \ Torn away from their original context and endowed with a symbolism that rendered\
    \ them a product of divine intervention, the crocodiles were tied with chains\
    \ and hung from church ceilings\u2026 where they acted both as signs of the mysteries\
    \ of divine power and as guardians that could thwart all other evils.\u201D \u2014\
