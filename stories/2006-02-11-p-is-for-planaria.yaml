  text: 'The fact-packed sixteenth episode of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    Glagolitic script was invented in the latter half of the ninth century by the
    monk Cyril, who is better known for having devised the alphabet which bears his
    name, Cyrillic. Glagolitic was designed to provide a written rendering of Old
    Slavonic, the language spoken by the Moravians among whom Cyril and his brother
    Methodius were carrying out their holy work. The word glagol, or hlahol, cannot
    easily be translated into English. Its meaning involves the sound of bells and
    the call to the glory of God in worship.

    Moop seems not to have considered such associations when one considers the subject-matter
    of her secretive Glagolitic scribblings. She was embroiled in the study of a fiendish
    species of flatworms known as planaria, which kill and feed on earthworms. The
    vile flatworms excrete an enzyme like a narcotic drug that paralyses an earthworm
    completely. Then they excrete another that dissolves the worm into a sort of soup.
    Then they suck it up. In the space of half an hour, all that remains is a trace
    of soil from the earthworm''s stomach.

    Planaria are successful because they have no known predators. Having no muscles,
    these hideous flatworms simply fall apart if any attempt is made to eat them.
    Like a vagabond horde, planaria are highly mobile, wiping out all the earthworms
    in one area before moving on relentlessly to another. It is not difficult to imagine
    what havoc Moop could wreak in Doctor Cack''s potato-patches by introducing a
    gang of killer flatworms. Let us remember that the good Doctor had entitled a
    special issue of his Bulletin Let Us Now Sing The Praises Of The Humble Earthworm,
    so essential was its contribution to potato cultivation.'
