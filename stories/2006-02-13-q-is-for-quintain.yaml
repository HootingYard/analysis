    The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    Ruhugu''s tank rumbled to a halt outside the Leaking Building. He clambered to
    the ground, the burnt quintain steady in his grasp. He no longer cared that Jubble
    had almost destroyed it on one of his bonfires. Ruhugu had managed to rescue it
    in the nick of time, singeing his elegantly-manicured hands as he did so. He knew
    that he would need the quintain again, otherwise he would have nothing to tilt
    at on the day of the tourney. So now he seldom let it out of his sight, taking
    it with him even on his regular tank manoeuvres.

    Of course, Ruhugu had reported Jubble''s pyromaniacal tendencies to Doctor Cack,
    but his mentor had been preoccupied. So often in recent weeks Doctor Cack seemed
    a world away. Ruhugu thought it best to leave him be, as the Doctor moped and
    frowned, his brow furrowed, a potato in each hand, a potato in each of his innumerable
    pockets, a potato balanced precariously atop his hat, even a small potato lodged
    in his mouth. Like the Wild Boy of Aveyron, he would utter shrill cries if his
    potatoes were taken away from him*.
