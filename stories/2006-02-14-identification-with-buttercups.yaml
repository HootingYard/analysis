  text: 'Today''s quotation is taken from one of the many splendid poems on the Teen
    Angst website. This is a collection of magnificently intense verse "contributed
    by people eighteen and over who have overcome their angst and are able to laugh
    at their past (and the products of their angst)". I chose Erin Millar''s piece
    because I, too, have often identified myself with the buttercup. Here is an extract
    from an interview I gave some years ago:

    Interviewer--So then, Frank, if you were a flower of the field, what flower of
    the field would you be?

    Frank--I would be a buttercup.

    Interviewer--Are you saying that you would like to poison cows, or at least cause
    cows indigestion or other mild gastric ailments?

    Frank--Sometimes, yes, if the weight of the world hangs heavy on my shoulders
    and I lose all sense of moral purpose, that would be true, regrettably.

    Interviewer--I commend you for the brutal honesty of your reply, Frank, but you
    do realise that I could turn you over to the police as a potential danger to cows?

    Frank--Crikey! I hadn''t thought of that!

    Interviewer--Is there any particular type of buttercup you particularly identify
    with?

    Frank--Yes, there is. I would be happiest, I think, as a celeryleaf buttercup,
    because it is also known as cursed crowfoot.

    Interviewer--Well, that''s all we have time for. Thanks, Frank. [Turns to camera]
    If there are any cows watching, don''t have nightmares. Frank isn''t really a
    buttercup, and he''s not going to come and poison you.'
