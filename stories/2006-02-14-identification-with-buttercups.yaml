  text: "Today's quotation is taken from one of the many splendid poems on the Teen\
    \ Angst website. This is a collection of magnificently intense verse \u201Ccontributed\
    \ by people eighteen and over who have overcome their angst and are able to laugh\
    \ at their past (and the products of their angst)\u201D. I chose Erin Millar's\
    \ piece because I, too, have often identified myself with the buttercup. Here\
    \ is an extract from an interview I gave some years ago:\nInterviewer\u2014So\
    \ then, Frank, if you were a flower of the field, what flower of the field would\
    \ you be?\nFrank\u2014I would be a buttercup.\nInterviewer\u2014Are you saying\
    \ that you would like to poison cows, or at least cause cows indigestion or other\
    \ mild gastric ailments?\nFrank\u2014Sometimes, yes, if the weight of the world\
    \ hangs heavy on my shoulders and I lose all sense of moral purpose, that would\
    \ be true, regrettably.\nInterviewer\u2014I commend you for the brutal honesty\
    \ of your reply, Frank, but you do realise that I could turn you over to the police\
    \ as a potential danger to cows?\nFrank\u2014Crikey! I hadn't thought of that!\n\
    Interviewer\u2014Is there any particular type of buttercup you particularly identify\
    \ with?\nFrank\u2014Yes, there is. I would be happiest, I think, as a celeryleaf\
    \ buttercup, because it is also known as cursed crowfoot.\nInterviewer\u2014Well,\
    \ that's all we have time for. Thanks, Frank. [Turns to camera] If there are any\
    \ cows watching, don't have nightmares. Frank isn't really a buttercup, and he's\
    \ not going to come and poison you."
