  text: 'The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet, episode eighteen. The serial began on 23 January

    It will come as no surprise to reveal that the corpse bundled up in burlap in
    the pointless hut was that of Doctor Cack. He had not been seen for some days.
    It is worth noting that because of the presence of potatoes in and about his body,
    rigor mortis had been delayed. Doctor Cack''s corpse was floppy and malleable,
    like a floppy and malleable thing, by dint of a variety of chemical compounds
    present within the experimental potatoes and their interaction both with the cadaver
    and with the stifling fug of the pointless hut. The names of the chemical compounds
    are so lengthy, and so hard to pronounce, that they shall not detain us here.'
