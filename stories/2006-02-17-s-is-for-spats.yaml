  text: 'And so we reach the nineteenth episode in the serial story the world has
    clutched to its bosom, The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    In the Room of Distressed Wooden Bitterns, Euwige cracked open another bottle
    of dandelion and burdock. Celebrations were in order. She and Detective Captain
    Unstrebnodtalb had not met for fifteen years, since that time in the aeroplane
    hangar.

    Then, Euwige had just returned from Slot, where she had torn some paper, arched
    her back like a cat, and stood next to a dam. Unstrebnodtalb was at the hangar
    to meet her, brandishing a trumpet. At this stage in his career, he looked not
    unlike a Hungarian fairground proprietor. He wore spats. He had gabbled at Euwige
    importunately, but his command of human languages was not good, and she had difficulty
    understanding him. Eventually, she had snatched the trumpet from him and beat
    him over the head with it repeatedly, stopping him in mid-gabble. Then she pushed
    him into a cart and rattled off to the House.

    Now, after all those years, they had a lot to catch up on. The walls of the Room
    shook as Unstrebnodtalb told his anecdotes in booming, cataclysmic roars. Jubble
    shoved putty into his ears to dull the racket. But Euwige seemed unperturbed,
    regularly refilling their tin mugs and badgering the Detective Captain with questions.
    What had happened to his spats? Was it true that he had arrested the notorious
    strangler Babinsky, and shaved off his bristly side-whiskers? Was his brain hot?
    Did moths fly about his head? Did he make crunching noises? Why had he not come
    sooner?

    Unstrebnodtalb, flicking gnats and hornets away from his head, smashed up the
    empty dandelion and burdock bottles with a single thwack from his huge and hairy
    fists. He had his own question for Euwige. What had become of his trusty assistant
    Aminadab?'
