  text: '"The lighting of the exposition can barely be touched upon in a few paragraphs
    and it would be difficult to describe in words even if space were unlimited. It
    represented the power of light to beautify and to awe... It was a crowning achievement
    of a century of public lighting which began with Murdock''s initial display of
    a hundred flickering gas-jets... It was a silent but pulsating display of grandeur
    dwarfing into insignificance the aurora borealis in its most resplendent moments."
