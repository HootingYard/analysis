  text: "\u201CThe lighting of the exposition can barely be touched upon in a few\
    \ paragraphs and it would be difficult to describe in words even if space were\
    \ unlimited. It represented the power of light to beautify and to awe\u2026 It\
    \ was a crowning achievement of a century of public lighting which began with\
    \ Murdock's initial display of a hundred flickering gas-jets\u2026 It was a silent\
    \ but pulsating display of grandeur dwarfing into insignificance the aurora borealis\
    \ in its most resplendent moments.\u201D \u2014 M Luckiesh, Artificial Light"
