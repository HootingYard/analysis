  text: "Readers who have been wallowing in Hooting Yard for a long time will know\
    \ that we occasionally give Mrs Gubbins, the octogenarian crone (and criminal\
    \ fugitive), the task of recommending other websites of interest. Contacting her\
    \ the other day by metal tapping machine*, we received this reply:\n\u201CI am\
    \ too busy knitting a decorative tea-cosy featuring scenes from The Twelve Caesars\
    \ by Suetonius to go trawling the web on your behalf. However, if you go to Incoming\
    \ Signals, you will find a plethora of links. If I wasn't knitting, I would certainly\
    \ be looking up such enticing items as Charles Darwin's crab collection, early\
    \ photographs of train, steamship and dirigible wrecks, the zodiacal methodology\
    \ of scheduling horse castration by moon signs, and a video of an octopus battling\
    \ a shark\u2014and those are only four of the wonders you can find, and they are\
    \ only from the first page. What are you waiting for? Now don't bother me again\
    \ until my tea cosy is done.\u201D\nMrs Gubbins does not lie. Incoming Signals\
    \ is a very fine a place from where to begin a lengthy browse on the web. It is\
    \ from here that you can be led, for example, to this terrific photograph of nails\
    \ driven through wood by the mighty power of the wind!\n\n*NOTE : Unkind people\
    \ have been putting it about that Mrs Gubbins' metal tapping machine number is\
    \ 666. This is not true."
