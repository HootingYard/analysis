  text: I am Gluten-Free Jabbering Man, and I jabber in the corridors of power. Like
    a L'Oreal product, I am armed with light-reflecting booster technology. I use
    it wisely, and do not abuse the advantages it gives me. How easy it would be for
    me to take a Member of Parliament, like Lembit Opik, say, or Dawn Primarolo, and
    not only boost the light reflecting off them but jabber at them until they, too,
    are gluten-free. I could if I wished do the same with captains of industry, media
    moguls, big players in the world of sport, with anyone you care to mention who
    has even the tiniest smidgeon of power and influence in the world. I have often
    been tempted to wreak my weird magic on Lionel Richie, for example, and yet I
    restrain myself. Now, I just do the jabbering, a quiet sort of jabbering, and
    I jabber only at the little bugs and creepy-crawlies that scurry unnoticed in
    the corridors of power, unnoticed, that is, by all but me, and by the pest controllers,
    to whom I refrain from jabbering, for even with my light-reflecting booster technology
    I suspect they would outwit me with their fearsome engines of destruction, their
    sprays and rays and fumes and beams. I covet such weaponry, but it would be too
    dangerous in my hands, and in any case, I am the personification of mercy, and
    I am replete.
