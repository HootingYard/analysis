  text: "\u201CIf his experiences of the previous evening had been distressing, the\
    \ breakfast which was set before him was positively heart-rending. A muddy-looking\
    \ liquid which they called coffee, soggy biscuits, a beefsteak that would rival\
    \ in toughness a piece of baked gutta percha, and evidently swimming in lard,\
    \ and potatoes which gave decided tokens of having been served on more than one\
    \ previous occasion. With a smothered groan he attacked the unsavoury viands,\
    \ and by dint of great effort managed to appease his hunger, to the serious derangement\
    \ of his digestive organs.\u201D \u2014 Allan Pinkerton, The Burglar's Fate And\
    \ The Detectives"
