  text: '"If his experiences of the previous evening had been distressing, the breakfast
    which was set before him was positively heart-rending. A muddy-looking liquid
    which they called coffee, soggy biscuits, a beefsteak that would rival in toughness
    a piece of baked gutta percha, and evidently swimming in lard, and potatoes which
    gave decided tokens of having been served on more than one previous occasion.
    With a smothered groan he attacked the unsavoury viands, and by dint of great
    effort managed to appease his hunger, to the serious derangement of his digestive
    organs." -- Allan Pinkerton, The Burglar''s Fate And The Detectives'
