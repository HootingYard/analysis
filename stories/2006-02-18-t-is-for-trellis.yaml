  text: 'The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet continues. Twenty down, six to go!

    Trellis was mere figment, vapour. He appeared to different people at different
    times as a sort of phantom. He was a tabula rasa, on to which those who met him
    inscribed their dreams, their yearnings, their hallucinations.

    All, that is, except Blodgett, in whose presence Trellis took on a terrifying
    reality. He would snivel, and Blodgett would have to mop up the snivellings with
    his filthy shirt-cuff. He would mewl, and Blodgett would thump him on the head,
    bruising his fist in the process.

    After Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb chewed up part of his head, Blodgett''s
    relationship with Trellis became even more intimate. Trellis would tell Blodgett
    all about the weather in Finland, and the nature of ice, and give him planks,
    and show him albumen. He would invoke disastrous plutonian gods, and have them
    frolic, miniaturised, before Blodgett''s eyes, occasionally tweaking the hairs
    from his nostrils. In return, Blodgett gave Trellis extra helpings of soup, winced
    at his frailness, concocted diverting bedtime stories and nautical yarns, and
    plied him with raspberries.

    Together, they plotted dark and criminal deeds.'
