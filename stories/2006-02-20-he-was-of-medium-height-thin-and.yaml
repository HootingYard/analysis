  text: '"He was of medium height, thin and sallow, with gray whiskers, thick gray
    hair, bushy eyebrows, and small, pointed and inquiring features which gave him
    rather the aspect of a prying bird. His eyes were little and sparkling. His mouth,
    strangely enough, was ecclesiastical. He nearly always wore very light-coloured
    clothes. Even in winter he was often to be seen clad in yellow-gray tweeds, a
    yellow silk necktie, and a fawn-colored Homburg hat. And no human being had ever
    encountered him in a pair of boots unprotected by spats." -- Robert Smythe Hichens,
    The Dweller On The Threshold'
