    "I shall soon be in a position to make an arrest," growled Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb
    at breakfast the next morning. Hummingbirds revolved around his head. The scullery
    had been all but obliterated during the master detective''s frenzied arrival,
    and for their breakfast soup the relevant characters had gathered in the stinking
    yard.

    Late the previous night, as the moon shimmered in the black sky, Unstrebnodtalb
    had come upon Doctor Cack''s corpse. Using detection magnets, and guided by his
    bat-like inner radar, it had taken him just minutes to pin-point the whereabouts
    of the dead potato scientist. His immediate diagnosis was that Doctor Cack had
    been slain with a whelk, a battery, and a puddle of bleach. Further than that
    he would not go, for the time being. The mysterious presence of ironmongery escaped
    his notice.

    His confidence at breakfast astonished even Euwige. "You know who did the deed?"
    she screeched.

    "Let me say this," howled Unstrebnodtalb, shovelling small insects down his gullet
    and uprooting titanic cedars* from the mud, "I delay only so that I can compare
    notes with my esteemed colleague, the sleuth Aminadab. He may be in possession
    of facts material to this foul deed, of information to which I am not privy despite
    my genius. His methods are obscure, but unfailing in their accuracy. The sleuth
    Aminadab always carries with him, in either his satchel or his reticule, a small
    rectangular tin filled with pastilles of a bauxite-like substance which is not
    actually bauxite itself. He carries, too, a portable kiln. Ignited with a simple
    household match, the kiln is coated on the inside with a fuel which produces a
    temperature of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit within two seconds of being lit.
    It is most uncanny, but I have witnessed this happen with my own eyes. Or rather,
    eye. Into this tiny furnace, Aminadab places one of his non-bauxite pastilles,
    using a long, thin pair of tongs which he carries about with him in a special
    compartment sewn into one leg of his pantaloons. He is a resourceful fellow, the
    sleuth Aminadab. Ten hours later, when the kiln has cooled, he prises open its
    tiny hatch, extracts the charred remains of the pastille, and smears it in his
    hair and upon his brow. Then he packs up the portable kiln, after applying a fresh
    coating of his inexplicable fuel, replaces it in his reticule or satchel, and
    goes about his business."Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb stopped howling, and
    beat his fists on the table, smashing it to pieces.

    "And how does this help him solve the case?" asked the languid Jubble. Unstrebnodtalb
    sank his fangs into a passing horse before responding.

    "It has nothing to do with the deductive abilities of the sleuth Aminadab," he
    roared, "I merely wished to entertain you at breakfast with an anecdote about
    his untoward personal habits."

    It began to rain.

    *NOTE : Here is a curious thing. The phrase "titanic cedars" appears here as it
    did in the original version of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet (1990). A few years
    earlier, another out of print pamphlet of mine, A Zest For Crumpled Things (1987),
    featured a character named Violet Ebbing. I was disconcerted to stumble upon both
    "titanic cedars" and "Violet Ebbing" when, some time in the mid-nineties, I read
    Ronald Firbank. They both turn up in, I think, Valmouth (1919), which I had never
    read before. Spooky.'
