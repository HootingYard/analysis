  text: 'Rainer Werner Ringbinder did not invent the ring-binder, but he claimed to
    have done so. He also tried to take credit for being the first person on earth
    to devise staplers, hole-punches, treasury tags, pencil sharpeners, and all sorts
    of other stationery items which, alas, are falling into desuetude as administrators
    and office workers spend more and more time staring at screens and less and less
    time fiddling about with tangible things.


    Oskar Homolka

    Rainer Werner Ringbinder was a heavy-set man with cow-like eyes, who looked a
    little like Oskar Homolka, the Viennese actor who played Verloc in Alfred Hitchcock''s
    Sabotage (1936), an adaptation of Joseph Conrad''s The Secret Agent (1907). Confusingly,
    Hitchcock made a film called Secret Agent (also 1936), which was nothing to do
    with Conrad''s novel, and also Saboteur (1942), which was nothing to do with Sabotage.
    Secret Agent (film, not book) starred John Gielgud, Peter Lorre, and Percy Marchmont,
    none of whom looked like Rainer Werner Ringbinder at all.

    Peter Lorre''s daughter Catherine nearly fell victim to the so-called "Hillside
    Stranglers", Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi, but was left unharmed when the
    fiends realised that her father''s status as a film star would mean unwelcome
    publicity for their homicidal frenzy. It goes to show that having the right name
    can get you out of all sorts of trouble, even when it isn''t the right name at
    all. In St Petersburg in 1918, the writer William Gerhardie was about to be set
    upon by a tangle of angry Bolsheviks when one of them recognised him and pointed
    out to his pals that it was "Geerhardi, Geerhardi". Mistaking the foppish young
    Englishman for Kier Hardie, founder of the Labour Party and socialist saint, the
    revolutionaries shook Gerhardie by the hand instead of tearing him limb from limb.

    Gerhardie''s first novel was Futility (1922), and this would have made an apposite
    title for a biography of Rainer Werner Ringbinder, were anyone foolish enough
    to write one. A man like Ringbinder does not have "friends", exactly, but the
    closest he came to one was his acquaintance Pryce Montmarch (not to be confused
    with Percy Marchmont), who said: "Everything about Rainer Werner was futile, from
    his cradle to his grave. He was the most hopelessly unnecessary person I ever
    met. Why he pretended to have invented many standard items of stationery is anybody''s
    guess. The infuriating thing is that he had a first class intellect, and he squandered
    it on futility."

    And so the seasons turn and the globe spins on its axis, and so dust settles on
    the past, and on tangible things, and still stars blaze with light in the boundless
    firmament.'
