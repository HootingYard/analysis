  text: "\u201CThe trade is not what it was some years ago when Rat-pits were allowed.\
    \ I think it was one of the worst things they ever did for this country when the\
    \ authorities stopped the Rat pits, for when Rat killing was allowed in pits,\
    \ it was a common thing for a Rat-catcher to receive an order for 100 Rats, all\
    \ to be killed at one time; then the Rat-catcher would get the Rats and wherever\
    \ he got them from he was ridding that district of a nuisance.\u201D \u2014 Ike\
