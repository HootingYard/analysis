  text: '"The trade is not what it was some years ago when Rat-pits were allowed.
    I think it was one of the worst things they ever did for this country when the
    authorities stopped the Rat pits, for when Rat killing was allowed in pits, it
    was a common thing for a Rat-catcher to receive an order for 100 Rats, all to
    be killed at one time; then the Rat-catcher would get the Rats and wherever he
    got them from he was ridding that district of a nuisance." -- Ike Matthews, Full
    Revelations Of A Professional Rat-Catcher'
