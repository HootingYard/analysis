  text: "Certain Aspects Of Plastic Baubles And Plastic Sheeting is one of those out-of-print\
    \ pamphlets by Dobson that has acquired the aura of legend. Not even the most\
    \ indefatigable of Dobsonistas claims ever to have seen a copy, let alone read\
    \ it, and some authorities doubt that it ever existed at all.\nThere is, of course,\
    \ the famous alleged cover of the pamphlet which was included in an exhibition\
    \ held at the Museum At Or Near Ack-On-The-Vug in 1992 to celebrate the inauguration\
    \ of the Cones Hotline, but this is almost certainly a fake.\n\nJohn Major's government\
    \ had introduced the Cones Hotline a few weeks before the show opened, and cones\
    \ were much in people's thoughts. Dobson had an abiding interest in cones of all\
    \ kinds, not just those used for traffic control, and we know that he drafted\
    \ some notes on cones made of plastic, though those too are mysteriously missing\
    \ from the archives.\nIs it likely that the pamphleteer would have addressed the\
    \ topic of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting without finding room for plastic\
    \ cones as well? The enfant terrible of Dobson studies, Gaston Pewt, has this\
    \ to say: \u201CThere can be no doubt in my mind that Certain Aspects Of Plastic\
    \ Baubles And Plastic Sheeting only exists in the febrile minds of older, wizened\
    \ Dobson scholars whose brains have been laid waste. Long ago they would have\
    \ downed tonics and invigorators to combat dyspepsia, low spirits, nervousness,\
    \ heartburn, colic pains, wind in the stomach or pains in the bowels, headache,\
    \ drowsiness, kidney and liver complaints, melancholy, delirium tremens, and intemperance.\
    \ Now they cannot get their hands on such potions, they pursue hopeless chimeras.\
    \ I neither know nor care which ancient, slobbering poop-head inserted a counterfeit\
    \ pamphlet cover into the Cones Hotline exhibition. What I know is that whoever\
    \ did so was trying to feed their misplaced vanity, and score points over young,\
    \ up and coming Dobsonistas like myself, even though at that time I had yet to\
    \ publish my ground-breaking reappraisal of the out-of-print pamphleteer's plastic-related\
    \ works.\u201D\nStirring words indeed, but we should remember that every single\
    \ copy of Monsieur Pewt's magisterial study, Plastic Dobson, was pulped before\
    \ it reached the bookshops, for reasons which, like the legendary pamphlet itself,\
    \ like those tonics and invigorators, like the wits of the Dobsonist old guard,\
    \ and like the Cones Hotline, are now forever lost, they are swept away, they\
    \ are swept away and gone."
