  text: "Our serial story The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet hurtles ever more thrillingly\
    \ towards its conclusion\nThere were twenty-six ponds in the grounds of the House,\
    \ of varying sizes. Sixteen of them were ponds, and ten were duckponds. One of\
    \ the duckponds was immense, it had claims to be a lake, there was so much water\
    \ in it.\nMoop trudged around this immense duckpond, her gaze fixed on the mud\
    \ through which she trod. An hour earlier, she had stolen Blodgett's windcheater\
    \ while his back was turned. It was far too big for her\u2014it was far too big\
    \ for Blodgett\u2014and the hood hid her head completely. She was plunged in reverie.\
    \ Every now and then, she stopped trudging and picked up a pebble to hurl into\
    \ the immense duckpond, disturbing the eerily calm surface of the water. She wondered\
    \ if the frenzied creature Unstrebnodtalb would arrest Trellis.\nAs she began\
    \ her fifteenth circuit of the duckpond, the water was disturbed by something\
    \ larger than her pebbles. With a chthonic churning and squelching, something\
    \ hideous and scarcely describable rose to the surface. It was finned and scaled,\
    \ but moved with robotic precision. It appeared to have a teeming mass of eyes,\
    \ thousands of jellied globules quivering on their stalks. It made no noise. At\
    \ the sight of it, nearby ducks suffered heart-attacks and perished.\nMoop had\
    \ more presence of mind than a duck. Unleashing a large net, she threw it over\
    \ the hell-spawned aquatic beast-thing, then stunned it with a dart from her blowpipe.\
    \ Binding it firmly with a length of stolen rope she found curled in a pocket\
    \ of Blodgett's windcheater, she began to drag the nightmare-being back to the\
    \ Leaking Building. It might possibly prove useful in her anti-potato research,\
    \ she reflected.\nShe had gone barely ten paces when the duckpond-monster unaccountably\
    \ slipped its bonds and whacked her on the skull with one of its mighty flippers,\
    \ knocking her unconscious."
