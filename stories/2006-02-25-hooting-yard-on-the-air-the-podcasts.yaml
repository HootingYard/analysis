  text: "If you have been reading this website with due care, you will know that I\
    \ broadcast a weekly half hour show on ResonanceFM, London's finest radio station.\
    \ The show goes out live, which means that my reading is sometimes accompanied\
    \ by banging, crashing, and buzzing noises, or interrupted by me having a choking\
    \ fit, or by other disturbances. That seems to me far more exciting than a rehearsed,\
    \ cleaned-up recording. You will also know, particularly if you are a pod person,\
    \ that the archive of past shows is being made available in the form of podcasts,\
    \ which you can have sent to your computer before transferring to your pod.\n\
    Here is a link to the Resonance home page, and here is one to the podcast page.\n\
    Anyway, I thought it might interest you to know how the podcasts are created.\
    \ Many people think that it is simply a case of taking the archived recording\
    \ of a show and making it available as an mp3 file. Would that it were so simple!\
    \ The truth is that in order for the original live broadcast to be made podcastable,\
    \ a number of extremely delicate and complicated operations need to be carried\
    \ out. And that is why, about once a month, I am summoned at dead of night to\
    \ the gleaming high-tech skyscraper wherein lurks ResonanceFM's podcasting maestro.\n\
    The first time I went there, it took me about an hour to find him, for the skyscraper\
    \ is enormous and wholly lacking in informative signage. What signs there are\
    \ are either baffling or redundant. I do not know why this is so, and I have never\
    \ had the courage to ask. I have learned to accept that the front desk in the\
    \ lobby is labelled, simply, The Front Desk In The Lobby, and that the person\
    \ sitting at the desk wears a badge reading The Person Sitting At The Front Desk\
    \ In The Lobby. This person has not been authorised to answer any questions whatsoever,\
    \ so when, on this first night-time visit, I asked \u201CWhere will I find the\
    \ podcasting maestro?\u201D, I may as well have been shouting into the wind, as\
    \ indeed I was, for the lobby acts as both lobby and experimental wind tunnel.\
    \ Apparently, sound recordings are made of the wind in preparation for one of\
    \ the podcasting maestro's planned podcasts, tentatively titled \u201CWind In\
    \ A Wind Tunnel\u201D.\nNow I was used to the more homespun atmosphere of the\
    \ station's main studio and was somewhat unnerved by the grandiosity of my surroundings.\
    \ I took a chance, however, walked past the person sitting at the front desk in\
    \ the lobby (who was immersed in reading a battered copy of Stockhausen Serves\
    \ Imperialism by Cornelius Cardew), took the lift up\u2014hitting a floor number\
    \ at random\u2014and skittered off down the corridor I found myself in. There\
    \ were numerous doors along this corridor, all marked Door. There was also, I\
    \ noticed, an overpowering smell of guinea pig, though I saw no guinea pigs, and\
    \ have seen none on my subsequent visits. I pushed open doors at random, and peeked\
    \ into each room, hoping to discover the Resonance podcast maestro, but all I\
    \ found were bales of fusewire, discarded yoghurt cartons, and toy crustaceans\
    \ made of plasticine. There was a lobster that took my fancy, but it was high\
    \ up on a shelf and I have an aversion to teetering on step-ladders.\nI think\
    \ I checked every room on that floor before getting back into the lift and choosing\
    \ another level, again at random. This one was different. It had no corridor,\
    \ just a vast open plan area\u2014with a sign, of course, reading A Vast Open\
    \ Plan Area\u2014empty except for a small patch of ectoplasm.\nI said that it\
    \ took me about an hour wandering the skyscraper to find the podcast maestro,\
    \ but in truth he found me. I was stumbling fretfully around what seemed like\
    \ the umpteenth floor when I heard a loud electronic crackling noise, and then\
    \ a disembodied voice.\n\u201CPodcast maestro to Frank Key! Podcast maestro to\
    \ Frank Key! Floor 96, Rectangle Zone!\u201D it called, so that is where I went.\n\
    The podcast maestro was sitting at a console from which occasional puffs of vapour\
    \ jetted up to the ceiling and slowly dispersed. He was wearing a metal hat and\
    \ taking ravenous bites from a toffee apple.\n\u201CGlad you could make it,\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CYou'd better put on these mittens,\u201D and he tossed a pair\
    \ of mittens to me. They were woven from a material I was unable to identify,\
    \ and I worried for a moment that I might suffer an allergic reaction, for in\
    \ the past I have had allergic reactions to mittens woven from unfamiliar materials.\
    \ On this occasion, however, all was well.\nThe podcast maestro, with a great\
    \ deal of effort, pulled a big lever on his console, to no apparent purpose.\n\
    \u201CNow,\u201D he said, \u201CIt is nearly three o' clock in the morning. At\
    \ precisely two minutes past, we will begin effecting the transfer of one of your\
    \ past shows into podcastable format. It should take about an hour. You will need\
    \ to attune the flimflam and steady the rattling. Just watch me, you'll soon get\
    \ the idea.\u201D\nAnd do you know what? He was right. I did, and by four o' clock\
    \ we had a complete recording of Hooting Yard On the Air all ready for podcasting.\
    \ Since then, I have been back to the skyscraper regularly, whenever I get the\
    \ summons on my metal tapping machine. I would not say that I have become friends\
    \ with the podcast maestro exactly, for there is something formidable about him,\
    \ emphasised by his metal hat, but we do engage in affable banter as the clock\
    \ ticks towards 3.02 a.m. After that, of course, we are silent, concentrated,\
    \ utterly involved in our task. And I hope that the pod people among you, when\
    \ you listen to each new podcast, are also silent, concentrated, and utterly involved,\
    \ borne away from the dull cares of your day into the realms of instructive and\
    \ sensible prose."
