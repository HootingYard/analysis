  text: "Chapter twenty-four of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet\nWith his mighty paw,\
    \ Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb was about to scratch a bloody X on the forehead\
    \ of Doctor Cack's murderer when his esteemed colleague the sleuth Aminadab came\
    \ crashing on to the scene. He was carrying a punnet full to the brim with odd\
    \ and inconsequential objects, which he proceeded to describe to Unstrebnodtalb\
    \ at length. Readers avid for the details should send an email headed Please tell\
    \ me what was in the sleuth Aminadab's brimming punnet, to which the author will\
    \ reply individually, to the point of tedium.\nBut Aminadab's rambling drivel\
    \ cannot be allowed to keep us from the denouement of this exciting story.\n\u201C\
    Hush! Hush! Aminadab, you are a sleuth about whom legends will accrete, but for\
    \ the love of G-d hold your tongue!\u201D screeched Unstrebnodtalb, setting fire\
    \ to a small herb garden with a blast of his breath.\nAminadab unzipped himself\
    \ from his terrifying aquatic monster costume and placed his punnet on a flagstone\
    \ next to one of Blodgett's fly-traps.\n\u201CYou would do well to pay attention\
    \ to my rambling drivel, Detective Captain Unstrobnedtalb,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    For it is only because I carry with me at all times a vial of cassiber serum that\
    \ I am able to assist you in bringing this case to a satisfactory conclusion.\
    \ The deranged potato scientist Moop stunned me with an incredibly powerful poisonous\
    \ dart from her blowpipe. By rights I should be in a coma. As it is, I had a split\
    \ second in which to bite on a serum pill and thus outwit her!\u201D\nDetective\
    \ Captain Unstrebnodtalb clawed at the sky, wailing horribly. \u201CVery clever,\
    \ Aminadab. But stop calling me Unstrobnedtalb, G-d damn you!\u201D\nWhile the\
    \ two detectives were occupied with this banter, the culprit fled into the crumbling\
    \ ruins of the House, forehead yet unmarked with an X."
