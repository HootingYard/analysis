  text: 'Chapter twenty-four of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    With his mighty paw, Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb was about to scratch a bloody
    X on the forehead of Doctor Cack''s murderer when his esteemed colleague the sleuth
    Aminadab came crashing on to the scene. He was carrying a punnet full to the brim
    with odd and inconsequential objects, which he proceeded to describe to Unstrebnodtalb
    at length. Readers avid for the details should send an email headed Please tell
    me what was in the sleuth Aminadab''s brimming punnet, to which the author will
    reply individually, to the point of tedium.

    But Aminadab''s rambling drivel cannot be allowed to keep us from the denouement
    of this exciting story.

    "Hush! Hush! Aminadab, you are a sleuth about whom legends will accrete, but for
    the love of G-d hold your tongue!" screeched Unstrebnodtalb, setting fire to a
    small herb garden with a blast of his breath.

    Aminadab unzipped himself from his terrifying aquatic monster costume and placed
    his punnet on a flagstone next to one of Blodgett''s fly-traps.

    "You would do well to pay attention to my rambling drivel, Detective Captain Unstrobnedtalb,"
    he said, "For it is only because I carry with me at all times a vial of cassiber
    serum that I am able to assist you in bringing this case to a satisfactory conclusion.
    The deranged potato scientist Moop stunned me with an incredibly powerful poisonous
    dart from her blowpipe. By rights I should be in a coma. As it is, I had a split
    second in which to bite on a serum pill and thus outwit her!"

    Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb clawed at the sky, wailing horribly. "Very clever,
    Aminadab. But stop calling me Unstrobnedtalb, G-d damn you!"

    While the two detectives were occupied with this banter, the culprit fled into
    the crumbling ruins of the House, forehead yet unmarked with an X.'
