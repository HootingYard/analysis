  text: 'The weather was foul on that day in the Ancient World, that Thursday when
    an unaccompanied horse cantered to a halt at the bank of a mighty waterway. The
    horse was Alexander the Great''s steed Bucephalus, sent by the Macedonian hero
    for a recuperative holiday. The river was the Bosphorus, the strait between the
    Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara.

    Alexander was a firm believer in horse holidays. When young, Bucephalus had been
    skittish and temperamental, frightened of his own shadow, and Alexander''s ministrations
    had becalmed him, but even as the mature horse he was now, there were times when
    he needed a break from campaigning and battle. Thus it was that Alexander had
    waved him off to--as he put it--"enjoy the mysteriously sultry atmosphere of a
    few nights by the Bosphorus"*.


    Bucephalus

    But it was not night-time, sultry or otherwise, when Bucephalus arrived at his
    destination. It was day, bleak, grey, and wretched, and the majestic horse stood
    still at the river''s edge, snorting. Alexander the Great did not expect him back
    in Macedonia for a week. Remember this is the Ancient World, so such landmarks
    as line the Bosphorus as the Galata tower, the palaces of Dolmabahce, Ciragan,
    Yildiz, and Beylerbeyi, the Rumeli and Anatolian Fortresses, and the Kuleli Military
    High School had not yet been built. Bucephalus began to trot, following the river''s
    course, hoping to find a field where he could have a restful time munching nutritious
    foliage.

    It was late afternoon on that Thursday when the horse decided to rest, and planted
    his hooves in the mud at the edge of the Bosphorus where today one finds the Bogazici
    suspension toll bridge. He noticed a churning in the waters of the mighty river,
    and turned his horse-head to look more intently. He was astonished to see a tangle
    of cephalopods thrashing around in the river, cephalopods large and small, octopuses,
    squids, cuttlefish and chambered nautiluses, emitting clouds of ink, tentacles
    flailing. What were they doing upriver, rather than in the dark, cold abysses
    of the sea? Were they lost, and did this explain their frantic activity? Cephalopods
    are probably the most intelligent of invertebrates, with huge pulsating brains,
    and it is easy to imagine that the realisation of being lost in the Bosphorus
    could induce panic among them.


    Bosphorus

    Bucephalus had devoted his life to the service of Alexander the Great, but now
    he wondered how he might help these strange sea-creatures, so much more ancient
    than he, or Alexander, or even the Ancient World in which he lived. Could he somehow
    take them all back to the sea, and release them into the vast pitiless oceans
    that were their natural home, from the warm waters of the tropics to the icy chill
    of the poles? Being a horse, Bucephalus could not think how he might lay a trail
    of plankton and krill for the cephalopods to pursue. He could not think of any
    way at all to lead them to the sea. So on the spur of the moment, he decided to
    gallop back to Macedonia, to fetch Alexander the Great, confident that his master
    would know exactly what to do.

    Alas! When he got to Macedonia, Bucephalus was told that Alexander was in the
    ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, puzzling out how to undo the Gordian knot
    so he could become the future King of Asia. So the brave horse charged tirelessly
    onward, collected Alexander--who had either worked out how to undo the knot or
    just hacked it apart with his sword, depending on whose story you believe--and
    sped with him all the way back to the Bosphorus.

    When they got there, they found no sign of the cephalopods. If a horse can feel
    sheepish, Bucephalus certainly did. He watched as Alexander dismounted and strode
    off, his armour clanking, into the field where the horse had munched his lunch.
    The Macedonian warlord plucked a plant from the earth and brought it to over to
    the horse.


    Cephalopods

    "This, Bucephalus, is henbane. It is not only the bane of hens, but of horses
    too. One day, when the Ancient World has passed away and the new times are known
    as mediaeval, it will be used in the brews concocted by witches to cause visual
    hallucinations and the sensation of flight. This I know." Alexander smiled and
    patted Bucephalus affectionately on the mane. "Poor deluded horse," he continued,
    "You saw no cephalopods. You were seeing visions of things that cannot be. Come,
    let us return to Macedonia at a canter, and I will give you healthy hay to eat."

    And as night fell on the sultry, mysterious Bosphorus, Alexander and Bucephalus
    began their long journey home. And in the depths of the river, the waters stirred,
    and a squid slithered through a tiny crack in a riverbed rock, its black, fathomless,
    malevolent eyes piercing the underwater world, long long ago, and far into the
    future, for eternity.

    *NOTE : Alexander the Great is here paraphrasing a line from Anthea Bell''s translation
    of Twilight by Stefan Zweig, published by the Pushkin Press, and highly recommended.
    There is a photograph of Herr Zweig and his wife tucked away in the Hooting Yard
    archive for August 2004.

    FURTHER NOTE: If you want to keep up with the very latest in the world of squids,
    nautiluses, octopuses and cuttlefish, I recommend Cephalopod News.

    An audio version of this story, declaimed by the author, will shortly be available
    as a cephalopodcast.'
