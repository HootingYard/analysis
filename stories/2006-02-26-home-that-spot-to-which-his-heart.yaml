  text: '"Home, that spot to which his heart is tied with unseen cords and tendrils
    tighter than the muscles which hold it in his swelling chest. Perhaps he left
    his Home caring little for it at the time. Perhaps harsh necessity drove him from
    its tender roof to lie beneath THE THATCH OF AVARICE. It does not matter. As the
    great river broadens in the Spring, so do his feelings swell and overflow his
    nature now. Why does he tremble, that rough, weather-beaten man?" -- John McGovern,
    The Golden Censer'
