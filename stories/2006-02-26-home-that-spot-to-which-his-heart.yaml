  text: "\u201CHome, that spot to which his heart is tied with unseen cords and tendrils\
    \ tighter than the muscles which hold it in his swelling chest. Perhaps he left\
    \ his Home caring little for it at the time. Perhaps harsh necessity drove him\
    \ from its tender roof to lie beneath THE THATCH OF AVARICE. It does not matter.\
    \ As the great river broadens in the Spring, so do his feelings swell and overflow\
    \ his nature now. Why does he tremble, that rough, weather-beaten man?\u201D \u2014\
    \ John McGovern, The Golden Censer"
