  text: 'The penultimate chapter of our serial story The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet

    Blodgett suffered dreadfully from yaws, but the condition cannot excuse his behaviour.
    Yaws is also known as framboesia. Blodgett was also known as Jubble. The deception
    had been difficult. Sometimes he had had to be in two places at once. Moop had
    been willing to impersonate him from time to time, no questions asked. She had
    been a useful ally, but he had begun to distrust her. She would be the next to
    go, after Ruhugu. Preening his mustachios, he cackled, as if he were a character
    in a nineteenth century melodrama.'
