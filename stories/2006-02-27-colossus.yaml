  text: "It has been said that Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, bestrode the\
    \ 20th century like a colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself, when\
    \ still a young man. At the age of twenty, he published a pamphlet resoundingly\
    \ titled Why I Shall Bestride This Century Like A Colossus. It is a curious work,\
    \ out of print of course, a thin tract with a picture of a whooper swan on the\
    \ cover. It begins thus:\nI shall bestride this century like a colossus. My name\
    \ will ring out like a clarion. In years to come, whenever two or three are gathered\
    \ together to discuss pamphleteers, there will be but one name on their lips:\
    \ Dobson!\n\nSuch self-belief, in so callow a youth, is touching. Looking back,\
    \ in his dotage, Dobson found it touching too, and he took to sitting with his\
    \ one remaining copy of the pamphlet clutched to his chest, sobbing uncontrollably\
    \ for hours on end. When Marigold Chew found him thus, she flung open the windows,\
    \ whatever the weather, and stamped around the room singing loud, tuneless sea\
    \ shanties, ones that involved pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sailcloth\
    \ and shipwreck. Invariably, Dobson's self-pitying lassitude would be broken,\
    \ and he would fling the curiously pristine pamphlet towards the fireplace, wipe\
    \ away his tears, don his Bolivian military boots and his Stalinist cardigan,\
    \ and crash out of the house to go on one of his jaunts.\nDobson's jaunts, in\
    \ the latter part of his life, usually took him to the nearest pig sty, but there\
    \ was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction. He walked so far\
    \ that day that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where all the streets\
    \ had two names, one both illegible and unpronounceable, and the other devised\
    \ by Yoko Ono. Postal delivery persons in that city were required by law to learn\
    \ all the double street names by heart, or to face summary dismissal if they failed.\
    \ Often, those who did fail\u2014and there were many\u2014would flounce around\
    \ on the outskirts of the city warning travellers away. It was a paltry sort of\
    \ revenge, and seldom succeeded, for the delights of that shining city attracted\
    \ wayfarers from near and far, daily, in their thousands. It is a wonder that\
    \ Dobson had never been there before this particular Tuesday.\nA dismissed postal\
    \ delivery person stopped the out of print pamphleteer as he was about to cross\
    \ a bridge that would take him in to the most boisterous quarter of the city.\n\
    \u201CGo no further, old man,\u201D said this vengeful figure, whose yellow skin\
    \ scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath. His hair was of a\
    \ lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances\
    \ only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost\
    \ of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled\
    \ complexion, and his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous,\
    \ empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. \u201C\
    This city you approach is no place for out of print pamphleteers.\u201D\nEver\
    \ sensitive to warnings from spooks and wraiths, Dobson turned around and went\
    \ home. He found Marigold Chew in the back garden, drilling holes in an enormous\
    \ sheet of corrugated cardboard.\n\u201CI was warned away from a shining city\
    \ on a hill,\u201D he said, \u201CIs it a city you have visited?\u201D\nMarigold\
    \ Chew stopped drilling, reset the safety catch, and removed her protective goggles.\n\
    \u201CYou are a foolish old man in your dotage, Dobson,\u201D she said, though\
    \ there was kindness in her voice, \u201CAnd it is well you were warned away,\
    \ for that city you think you saw is illusory. Some say the hill it sits atop\
    \ is hollow, and contains heaven, and some say hell. Either way, I am pleased\
    \ to see you home. Let us clear the nettles from the vegetable patch.\u201D\n\
    That was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th century. Did\
    \ Dobson indeed bestride it as a colossus? He was not the only person to think\
    \ so, but the names of the others escape me for the time being. When I remember\
    \ them, I will tell you."
