  text: 'It has been said that Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, bestrode the
    20th century like a colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself, when
    still a young man. At the age of twenty, he published a pamphlet resoundingly
    titled Why I Shall Bestride This Century Like A Colossus. It is a curious work,
    out of print of course, a thin tract with a picture of a whooper swan on the cover.
    It begins thus:

    I shall bestride this century like a colossus. My name will ring out like a clarion.
    In years to come, whenever two or three are gathered together to discuss pamphleteers,
    there will be but one name on their lips: Dobson!


    Such self-belief, in so callow a youth, is touching. Looking back, in his dotage,
    Dobson found it touching too, and he took to sitting with his one remaining copy
    of the pamphlet clutched to his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end.
    When Marigold Chew found him thus, she flung open the windows, whatever the weather,
    and stamped around the room singing loud, tuneless sea shanties, ones that involved
    pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sailcloth and shipwreck. Invariably,
    Dobson''s self-pitying lassitude would be broken, and he would fling the curiously
    pristine pamphlet towards the fireplace, wipe away his tears, don his Bolivian
    military boots and his Stalinist cardigan, and crash out of the house to go on
    one of his jaunts.

    Dobson''s jaunts, in the latter part of his life, usually took him to the nearest
    pig sty, but there was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction.
    He walked so far that day that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where
    all the streets had two names, one both illegible and unpronounceable, and the
    other devised by Yoko Ono. Postal delivery persons in that city were required
    by law to learn all the double street names by heart, or to face summary dismissal
    if they failed. Often, those who did fail--and there were many--would flounce
    around on the outskirts of the city warning travellers away. It was a paltry sort
    of revenge, and seldom succeeded, for the delights of that shining city attracted
    wayfarers from near and far, daily, in their thousands. It is a wonder that Dobson
    had never been there before this particular Tuesday.

    A dismissed postal delivery person stopped the out of print pamphleteer as he
    was about to cross a bridge that would take him in to the most boisterous quarter
    of the city.

    "Go no further, old man," said this vengeful figure, whose yellow skin scarcely
    covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath. His hair was of a lustrous black,
    and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed
    a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour
    as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and
    his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human
    expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. "This city you approach
    is no place for out of print pamphleteers."

    Ever sensitive to warnings from spooks and wraiths, Dobson turned around and went
    home. He found Marigold Chew in the back garden, drilling holes in an enormous
    sheet of corrugated cardboard.

    "I was warned away from a shining city on a hill," he said, "Is it a city you
    have visited?"

    Marigold Chew stopped drilling, reset the safety catch, and removed her protective
    goggles.

    "You are a foolish old man in your dotage, Dobson," she said, though there was
    kindness in her voice, "And it is well you were warned away, for that city you
    think you saw is illusory. Some say the hill it sits atop is hollow, and contains
    heaven, and some say hell. Either way, I am pleased to see you home. Let us clear
    the nettles from the vegetable patch."

    That was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th century. Did
    Dobson indeed bestride it as a colossus? He was not the only person to think so,
    but the names of the others escape me for the time being. When I remember them,
    I will tell you.'
