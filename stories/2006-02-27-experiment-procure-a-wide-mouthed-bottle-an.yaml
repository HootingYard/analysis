  text: '"Experiment : Procure a wide-mouthed bottle, an egg, a glass tube about three
    inches long and a quarter-inch in diameter, a candle, and a piece of wire a little
    longer than the tube. Remove a part of the shell from the large end of the egg
    without breaking the skin beneath. This is easily done by gently tapping the shell
    with the handle of a pocket-knife until it is full of small cracks, and then,
    with the blade of the knife, picking off the small pieces. In this way remove
    the shell from the space about the size of a nickel. Remove the shell from the
    small end of the egg over a space about as large as the end of the glass tube.
    Next, from the lower end of the candle cut a piece about one-half inch long. Bore
    a hole in this just the size of the glass tube. Now soften one end of the piece
    of candle with the hole in it and stick it on to the small end of the egg so that
    the hole in the candle comes over the hole in the egg. Heat the wire, and with
    it solder the piece of candle more firmly to the egg, making a water-tight joint.
    Place the glass tube in the hole in the piece of candle, pushing it down till
    it touches the egg. Then, with the heated wire, solder the tube firmly in place.
    Now run the wire down the tube and break the skin of the egg just under the end
    of the tube. Fill the bottle with water till it overflows, and set the egg on
    the bottle, the large end in contact with the water. In an hour or so the contents
    of the egg will be seen rising in the glass tube." -- Charles L Goodrich, The
    First Book Of Farming'
