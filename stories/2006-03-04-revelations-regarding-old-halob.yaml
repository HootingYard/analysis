  text: 'Intensive and scrupulous new biographical research on Old Halob, the crusty
    and cantankerous sporting legend who was for many years the coach and mentor of
    fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, has revealed an amazing fact. (I think that sentence
    really ought to have an exclamation mark at the end, to emphasise just how exciting
    it is.)

    According to a recently published monograph by Pierre Sugum*, Old Halob worked
    with fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol for forty years without ever suspecting that
    his protege was not actually real. The wizened and untidy trainer, with his moth-eaten
    clothing and offensive hair oil, seems to have overlooked the weekly comic magazine
    Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol''s Weekly Comic Magazine For Girls And Boys, wherein
    the sprinter and sometime polevaulter''s breathtaking athletic feats were chronicled
    by a series of pseudonymous writers and illustrators.

    Professor Sugum has also unearthed compelling evidence that one of these pseudonymous
    writers may have been Dobson. If this is so, it would have been one of the few
    paying jobs the out of print pamphleteer ever held, along with his hectic janitorial
    escapades in that tinned milk of magnesia factory in Winnipeg. Sugum is reluctant
    to say for certain that Dobson wrote the early stories Fictional Athlete Bobnit
    Tivol And The Polevaulting Pole That Snapped In Two and Fictional Athlete Bobnit
    Tivol Buffs His Latest Medal With A Frayed Rag, leaving it to readers to judge
    the merits of the case.

    It is Old Halob''s ignorance of the athlete''s fictional status which is the most
    astounding revelation of the article. One has always been tempted to conclude
    that the wily coach knew more than he let on, and yet this view is comprehensively
    demolished by Sugum in a couple of sentences.

    I wish I could include extracts from this ground-breaking essay here, but I have
    been informed that Professor Sugum is highly litigious, a monster of depravity,
    and wallows in a foul pit of moral turpitude, so it would be foolhardy to antagonise
    him. Instead, here is a snapshot of Old Halob when young, or at least a snapshot
    that purports to be of Old Halob when young, or a member of his immediate family,
    or so I''m told, at any rate, credulous poltroon that I am.
