  text: "Intensive and scrupulous new biographical research on Old Halob, the crusty\
    \ and cantankerous sporting legend who was for many years the coach and mentor\
    \ of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, has revealed an amazing fact. (I think that\
    \ sentence really ought to have an exclamation mark at the end, to emphasise just\
    \ how exciting it is.)\nAccording to a recently published monograph by Pierre\
    \ Sugum*, Old Halob worked with fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol for forty years\
    \ without ever suspecting that his prot\xE9g\xE9 was not actually real. The wizened\
    \ and untidy trainer, with his moth-eaten clothing and offensive hair oil, seems\
    \ to have overlooked the weekly comic magazine Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol's\
    \ Weekly Comic Magazine For Girls And Boys, wherein the sprinter and sometime\
    \ polevaulter's breathtaking athletic feats were chronicled by a series of pseudonymous\
    \ writers and illustrators.\nProfessor Sugum has also unearthed compelling evidence\
    \ that one of these pseudonymous writers may have been Dobson. If this is so,\
    \ it would have been one of the few paying jobs the out of print pamphleteer ever\
    \ held, along with his hectic janitorial escapades in that tinned milk of magnesia\
    \ factory in Winnipeg. Sugum is reluctant to say for certain that Dobson wrote\
    \ the early stories Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol And The Polevaulting Pole That\
    \ Snapped In Two and Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol Buffs His Latest Medal With\
    \ A Frayed Rag, leaving it to readers to judge the merits of the case.\nIt is\
    \ Old Halob's ignorance of the athlete's fictional status which is the most astounding\
    \ revelation of the article. One has always been tempted to conclude that the\
    \ wily coach knew more than he let on, and yet this view is comprehensively demolished\
    \ by Sugum in a couple of sentences.\nI wish I could include extracts from this\
    \ ground-breaking essay here, but I have been informed that Professor Sugum is\
    \ highly litigious, a monster of depravity, and wallows in a foul pit of moral\
    \ turpitude, so it would be foolhardy to antagonise him. Instead, here is a snapshot\
    \ of Old Halob when young, or at least a snapshot that purports to be of Old Halob\
    \ when young, or a member of his immediate family, or so I'm told, at any rate,\
    \ credulous poltroon that I am.\n\n*NOTE : \u201CI Know All There Is To Know About\
    \ Old Halob Even Though I Am A Monster Of Depravity\u201D in The Bulletin Of Fictional\
    \ Sprinting And Related Athletic Pursuits, Vol XVII, No. 12"
