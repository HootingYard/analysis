  text: 'A new property development has recently appeared near where I live. It''s
    a block of flats called Marnie Court, so I suspect all the residents will be deranged
    blonde kleptomaniacs who try to suppress memories of having murdered a sailor
    when they were tiny tots.

    I do like the idea of naming blocks of flats after Hitchcock films. Wouldn''t
    you love to live in Psycho House, Rich And Strange Villas, Spellbound Court, Notorious
    Buildings, Torn Curtain Court, or Frenzy Flats?
