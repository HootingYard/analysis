  text: 'The Guardianruns a daily selection from its archives. Today''s article (advertisement?),
    originally published on 6 March 1844, is so good that I am including it here:

    Worms Destroyed : Medicine never witnessed a more important discovery than in
    Pritchett''s Vegetable Vermifuge, a remedy that neither purges, vomits, nor otherwise
    affects the constitution; requires no confinement, has neither taste nor smell,
    and is so harmless that it may be taken by an infant of an hour old; yet never,
    in one instance, failed destroying every worm in the body. It contains not a particle
    of calomel, scammony, gamboge, or other drastic article. Large packets 2s.9d.

    Apoplexy Prevented : Determination of blood to the head effectually prevented
    by the occasional use of Frampton''s Pill of Health, which, by strengthening the
    action of the stomach, prevents alarming giddiness, oppression of the brain, singing
    noise in the ears, headache. They are an excellent aperient, without griping or
    prostration of strength. Price 1 1/2d. and 2s.9d. a box.

    For Stopping Decayed Teeth : Patronised by her Majesty the Queen, his Royal Highness
    Prince Albert, her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent, his Majesty the King of
    the Belgians, his Majesty the King of Prussia, his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury,
    and nearly all the nobility, the bishops, and the clergy. Mr Thomas''s Succedaneum,
    for filling decayed teeth, however large the cavity. It is superior to anything
    ever before used, as it is placed in the tooth in a soft state, without any pressure
    or pain, and in a short time becomes as hard as the enamel, and will remain firm
    in the tooth for many years, rendering extraction unnecessary. It arrests all
    further progress of decay, and renders them again useful in mastication. All persons
    can use Mr Thomas''s Succedaneum themselves with else, without the aid of a dentist.
    Prepared only by Mr. Thomas, surgeon-dentist, 8, Berners-street, Oxford-street,
    London ; price 4s. 6d. Mr Thomas will send it free by post.

    General Debility : To these who are suffering from nervous complaints, rheumatism,
    scurvy, sorbutic eruptions and all diseases arising from impurity of the blood.
    The Cordial Balm of Syriacum is a gentle stimulant and enovator of the impaired
    functions of life, and is, therefore, calculated to afford decided relief to those
    who have fallen into a state of most chronic debility. It possesses wonderful
    efficacy in fits, headache, weakness, heaviness, dimness of sight, confused thoughts,
    wandering of the mind, and all kinds of hysteric complaints. Price 11s.'
