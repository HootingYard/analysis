  text: "Was Dobson a visionary? William Blake saw an angel in a tree in Peckham.\
    \ Dobson, so far as we know, never went to Peckham. But did he see other angels,\
    \ in other trees, elsewhere? If he did, he never wrote about them. He wrote about\
    \ all sorts of things\u2014propellers, dust, ringworm, Rod McKuen, spillages,\
    \ gloom and magnetism, for example.\nDobson's pamphlet on Rod McKuen is one of\
    \ his most extraordinary works. He took a single line from a poem by the gravel-voiced\
    \ bard of sentimental pap and spun from it a dizzying exegesis. The critic Lavender\
    \ Thule has praised Dobson's essay as the verbal equivalent of a bebop jazz improvisation,\
    \ although as she is profoundly deaf, and has been since birth, one wonders how\
    \ she arrived at this conclusion. One wonders, too, why she treasures a crumpled\
    \ photograph of the jazz-obsessed armaments manufacturer Chevenix Peaglue on the\
    \ back of which she has scribbled an illegible couplet.\n\nHedgehog lover Rod\
    \ McKuen\nThe line Dobson chose as the starting point for his majestic pamphlet\
    \ is from Rod McKuen's poem \u201CMornings Enough\u201D, where the cloying versifier\
    \ writes: The hedgehog grumbling back to darkness is known by me and loved by\
    \ me. In sweeping prose. Dobson notes that sleeping hedgehogs are often torn to\
    \ pieces by badgers, and ponders on savagery in the world of small mammals. Would\
    \ McKuen, he asks, declare his love for a badger with bloody fangs, fresh from\
    \ gorging itself on the entrails of a recently-slaughtered hedgehog? From there,\
    \ the out of print pamphleteer poses a series of questions about love, badgers,\
    \ blood, gravel pathways, wax, being unstinting about something, pantomime, poisonous\
    \ toads, The Duchess of Malfi, gloves, fruit with pips, fruit without pips, and\
    \ the methods we use to measure horses. It is a bravura performance, even though\
    \ Dobson refuses to answer any of the questions he raises.\nIndeed, on page sixty-six\
    \ he writes \u201CI refuse to answer any of these questions. You can put me in\
    \ a sack and seal the sack with knotted rope, and fling the sack containing me\
    \ into a dark and horrible pond, or even into the vast abominable sea, but I shall\
    \ remain steadfast in my silence!!!\u201D\nWhy did Dobson choose to end that sentence\
    \ with three exclamation marks? Do I know the answer to that question? If I do,\
    \ will I tell you? Or will I, like Dobson, invite you to put me in a sack and\
    \ seal the sack with knotted rope, and fling the sack containing me into a dark\
    \ and horrible pond, or even into the vast abominable sea?"
