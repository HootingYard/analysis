  text: '"What has happened to Dwight? Something that is not easily settled; for as
    the chickens sputter in the oven below, and the water boils off the potatoes,
    and the pudding is manufactured, and the cloud deepens and glooms, he does not
    recover his free-and-easy air and manner. He ceases his walk after a little, from
    sheer weariness, but he thrusts out his arm and seizes a chair with the air of
    one who has not time to be leisurely, and flings himself into it, and clasps his
    arms on the table, and bends his head on his hands and thinks on. The holy hours
    of the Sabbath afternoon waned." -- Pansy & Mrs C M Livingston, Divers Women'
