  text: '"I am going to outline for you a picture of an object which is everywhere
    recognized by good people as a symbol of defiance of the law, a suggestion of
    immorality, of poverty, depravity and death. [Draw beer keg, completing Fig. 15.]
    In plain words, it is a beer keg, and its close companions are the whiskey barrel,
    the wine cask and the demijohn! It well represents the liquor traffic as a whole--that
    terrible curse which holds in its grip so many men and boys, whose lives might
    be bright, happy and successful but for its blighting, fatal grasp. No right-thinking
    man has a good word for the business which makes good men into brutes, transforms
    honorable citizens into murderers, and brings many a prosperous family to rags
    and misery." -- J Griswold, Crayon And Character : Truth Made Clear Through Eye
    And Ear'
