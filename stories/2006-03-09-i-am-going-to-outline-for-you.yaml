  text: "\u201CI am going to outline for you a picture of an object which is everywhere\
    \ recognized by good people as a symbol of defiance of the law, a suggestion of\
    \ immorality, of poverty, depravity and death. [Draw beer keg, completing Fig.\
    \ 15.] In plain words, it is a beer keg, and its close companions are the whiskey\
    \ barrel, the wine cask and the demijohn! It well represents the liquor traffic\
    \ as a whole\u2014that terrible curse which holds in its grip so many men and\
    \ boys, whose lives might be bright, happy and successful but for its blighting,\
    \ fatal grasp. No right-thinking man has a good word for the business which makes\
    \ good men into brutes, transforms honorable citizens into murderers, and brings\
    \ many a prosperous family to rags and misery.\u201D \u2014 J Griswold, Crayon\
    \ And Character : Truth Made Clear Through Eye And Ear"
