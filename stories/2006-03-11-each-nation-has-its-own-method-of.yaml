  text: "\u201CEach nation has its own method of salutation. In Southern Africa it\
    \ is the custom to rub toes. In Lapland your friend rubs his nose against yours.\
    \ The Turk folds his arms upon his breast and bends his head very low. The Moors\
    \ of Morocco have a somewhat startling mode of salutation. They ride at a gallop\
    \ toward a stranger, as though they would unhorse him, and when close at hand\
    \ suddenly check their horse and fire a pistol over the person's head. The Egyptian\
    \ solicitously asks you, \u2018How do you perspire?\u2019 and lets his hand fall\
    \ to the knee. The Chinese bows low and inquires, \u2018Have you eaten?\u2019\
    \ The Spaniard says, \u2018God be with you, sir,\u2019 or, \u2018How do you stand?\u2019\
    \ And the Neapolitan piously remarks, \u2018Grow in holiness\u2019.\u201D \u2014\
    \ John H Young, Our Deportment"
