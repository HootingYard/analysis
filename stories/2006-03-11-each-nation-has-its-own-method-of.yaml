  text: '"Each nation has its own method of salutation. In Southern Africa it is the
    custom to rub toes. In Lapland your friend rubs his nose against yours. The Turk
    folds his arms upon his breast and bends his head very low. The Moors of Morocco
    have a somewhat startling mode of salutation. They ride at a gallop toward a stranger,
    as though they would unhorse him, and when close at hand suddenly check their
    horse and fire a pistol over the person''s head. The Egyptian solicitously asks
    you, ''How do you perspire?'' and lets his hand fall to the knee. The Chinese
    bows low and inquires, ''Have you eaten?'' The Spaniard says, ''God be with you,
    sir,'' or, ''How do you stand?'' And the Neapolitan piously remarks, ''Grow in
    holiness''." -- John H Young, Our Deportment'
