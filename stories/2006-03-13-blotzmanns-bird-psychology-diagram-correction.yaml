  text: "The trustees of the Blotzmann Institute of Bird Psychology have asked me\
    \ to point out that a number of errors appeared in the reproduction of the famous\
    \ Blotzmann Bird Psychology Diagram on Saturday (see below). Keen followers of\
    \ Blotzmann will be aware that he was forever refining his work, and I inadvertently\
    \ showed an early\u2014and discredited\u2014version of the diagram. Here, then,\
    \ is the definitive Blotzmann Diagram, as approved by the Institute.\n"
