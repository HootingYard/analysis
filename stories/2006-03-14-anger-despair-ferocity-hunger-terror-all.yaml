  text: '"Anger, despair, ferocity, hunger, terror--all were depicted upon those awful
    faces. Through the cracked glass, deadly fumes began to steal, my room seemed
    cloudy, I was as if transfixed, unable to move, to call, to reach the lights,
    to do aught but stand staring, tremblingly. The faces pressed closer and yet closer;
    they reached the glass, it cracked again, and more fumes poured in; long arms
    (there seemed hundreds of them) reached wildly up, skinny hands, like those of
    skeletons, were held out as if to grasp." -- Bessie Kyffin-Taylor, From Out Of
    The Silence'
