  text: "\u201CAnger, despair, ferocity, hunger, terror\u2014all were depicted upon\
    \ those awful faces. Through the cracked glass, deadly fumes began to steal, my\
    \ room seemed cloudy, I was as if transfixed, unable to move, to call, to reach\
    \ the lights, to do aught but stand staring, tremblingly. The faces pressed closer\
    \ and yet closer; they reached the glass, it cracked again, and more fumes poured\
    \ in; long arms (there seemed hundreds of them) reached wildly up, skinny hands,\
    \ like those of skeletons, were held out as if to grasp.\u201D \u2014 Bessie Kyffin-Taylor,\
    \ From Out Of The Silence"
