  text: "\u201CHark! what plunged from the bank\u2014what black thing moves towards\
    \ him across the water? The crocodile! coming with tears in his eyes, and a long\
    \ grin of serried teeth. Coming!\u2014the ugly scaly head is always nearer and\
    \ nearer. The boy screams; but who should hear him? He feels whether the talisman\
    \ be yet round his neck. He screams again, calling, in half-delirium, upon his\
    \ dead mother. Meanwhile the scaly snout is close upon him.\u201D \u2014 Julian\
