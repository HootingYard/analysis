  text: '"Hark! what plunged from the bank--what black thing moves towards him across
    the water? The crocodile! coming with tears in his eyes, and a long grin of serried
    teeth. Coming!--the ugly scaly head is always nearer and nearer. The boy screams;
    but who should hear him? He feels whether the talisman be yet round his neck.
    He screams again, calling, in half-delirium, upon his dead mother. Meanwhile the
    scaly snout is close upon him." -- Julian Hawthorne, Idolatry'
