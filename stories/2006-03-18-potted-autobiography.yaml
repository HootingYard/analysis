  text: "Occasionally the Hooting Yard postbox is choked with letters from readers\
    \ all of which say, in so many words, \u201CFrank, tell us what you're really\
    \ like\u201D. My natural diffidence makes me reluctant to respond to such pleas,\
    \ but today I have changed my mind. Here, then, is a brief but devastatingly accurate\
    \ pen-portrait of \u201CMister Hooting Yard\u201D.\nUnlike Maya Angelou, I have\
    \ no idea why the caged bird sings. Nor am I particularly given to singin' and\
    \ swingin' and gettin' merry like Christmas. On the contrary, I have an almost\
    \ fathomless ignorance of ornithological matters and the Yuletide season will\
    \ find me moping and lugubrious. Thus, if I am ever to write a series of memoirs,\
    \ it will not do for me to plagiarise Maya Angelou's catchy titles. I will have\
    \ to come up with my own ideas, and the strain of doing so makes it unlikely that\
    \ I will be in a fit state to continue writing once I have hit upon the perfect\
    \ title for the story of my own life. Of course, if I was able to get my hands\
    \ on the Cordial Balm of Siriacum (see O Cure Me, below, 6th March) that might\
    \ provide the fillip I need, and I would be able to type away energetically, regaling\
    \ you with anecdotes from my past, attempting an amusing yet cogent dissection\
    \ of my current state, and even looking forward to the future with the aid of\
    \ psychic messages from a squirrel. I beg you to wait patiently, therefore, while\
    \ I seek a reliable supply of the Cordial Balm. When I have done so, I shall continue\
    \ with my potted autobiography."
