  text: 'In the latest issue of the superb Chat! magazine, Ruth The Truth (the "psychic
    agony aunt") has this advice for Janice from Pembroke: "the squirrel in your garden
    has a message"*. Skeptics, nay-sayers and other blighters will retort that the
    squirrel''s message is likely to be "Give me some nuts" or "Give me some more
    nuts", but Ruth The Truth--and the squirrel-fanciers among us at Hooting Yard--know
    better.

    I can speak only from my own experience, but it has long been apparent to me that
    squirrels are in fact emissaries from The Beyond. All that hectic twitching and
    scampering is evidence not merely of a high metabolic rate but of the fact that
    their tiny squirrel brains are jam-packed with pulsating psychic energy. I do
    not deny that they want nuts, either to nibble right away or to put in storage
    for a long hard winter, but that is not the whole story. Consider those bushy
    tails. Have you ever wondered why they stick upwards, rather than thumping along
    the ground, like the tails of so many other animals? It is because each hair of
    a squirrel''s tail ends in a minuscule receptor, designed by nature to pick up
    and capture some of the billions of psychic messages swirling around the ether.
    These spooky thought-phenomena are invisible, fugitive and volatile, unnoticed
    by us humans with our puny minds, but they are the very atmosphere of the squirrels''
    world. Those quivering psychic nodes in their tails strain to pick up signals
    from those who have passed over to the Other Side, be they other squirrels, stoats,
    weasels, birds, insects, or indeed humans.

    Ruth The Truth, in Chat!, does not divulge what message the squirrel in her garden
    has for Janice from Pembroke, and it would be no doubt foolish to try to guess.
    But I am foolish sometimes. Perhaps Janice is a widow, and her departed husband
    has sent reassuring news from Heaven, or, more worryingly, a stricken plea from
    the Pit of Doom and Desolation. Maybe Janice had a pet swan which succumbed to
    bird flu** and it has sent, via the squirrel in the garden, news from that place
    to which perished swans are consigned when they leave the mortal world. It could
    even be that Janice from Pembroke trod accidentally upon a dozing bee on her garden
    path last summer, and the bee is telling her she is forgiven.

    It is unlikely that Janice from Pembroke is a keen reader of both Chat! and Hooting
    Yard, but if she is, I would like to invite her to share with us the message she
    has received from the squirrel in her garden. It may be, indeed, that she is unable
    to translate the message from the argot of squirrels in which it is couched, and
    here we can help, for Mrs Gubbins is a skilled interpreter of these things.

    *NOTE : I am indebted to Charlie Brooker of The Guardian for alerting me to this
    important matter, in a piece entitled Supposing ... The mainstream''s as mad as
    it seems to be.

    **NOTE : Janice from Pembroke could have avoided her swan''s bird flu death had
    she paid careful attention to Saving Your Swan (see 20th February 2006).'
