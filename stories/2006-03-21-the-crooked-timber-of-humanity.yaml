  text: "His frostbitten limbs. Sappho in the doldrums. Bad gas and forts. If these\
    \ phrases do not stir you, you are clearly not a devotee of Urbane Geistige Geist,\
    \ who was born one hundred years ago today. If, on the other hand, your brain\
    \ lit up like a beacon on reading those words, you will be one of that little\
    \ band who rightly acknowledge Geist as a key figure in twentieth century popular\
    \ music.\n\u2018Popular\u2019 is perhaps not the most appropriate word. Although\
    \ he worked within such fields as jazz, folk, rock, hootcha, pop, and swing, Geist's\
    \ music never won mass acceptance. He was only ever a cult figure, but it is to\
    \ be hoped that, with the celebration of his centenary, the ears of the world\
    \ can be opened to his extraordinary accomplishment. Who would have thought that\
    \ an obscure cadet in the Bolivian army would become\u2014in the words of one\
    \ perceptive commentator\u2014a cross between Yoko Ono, Xavier Cugat, and Mark\
    \ E Smith?\nWe need not dwell here on Geist's military career, except to note\
    \ that he learned to play his first instrument\u2014the glockenspiel\u2014when\
    \ he came under the wing of the legendary Bolivian army glockenspiel instructor,\
    \ Captain Enrique Finisterre Belbacqau, a man of whom it has been said that if\
    \ he did not exist, the staff of the Bolivian Army Glockenspiel Training School\
    \ would have had to invent him. (One body of opinion attests that that is precisely\
    \ what they did, creating a fictional character not unlike the supposed agent\
    \ George Kaplan in Hitchcock's North By Northwest, for whom the Cary Grant character\
    \ Roger Thornhill is mistaken. This theory has never satisfactorily answered the\
    \ obvious question: if Belbacqua did not exist, who exactly did teach Geist his\
    \ formidable glockenspiel technique?)\nAfter being thrown out of the Bolivian\
    \ army because of his flawed cadetship and shape-shifting, Geist hitch-hiked to\
    \ Paraguay, where he soon fell in with a criminal gang who, when they weren't\
    \ cutting throats and pushing widows into the paths of oncoming trains, toted\
    \ their piccolos and banjos around the market squares of provincial towns, playing\
    \ an infectious combination of bluegrass and light opera. This raggle-taggle peasant\
    \ band became, improbably enough, the first incarnation of The Crooked Timber\
    \ Of Humanity.\nThere has been much speculation regarding Geist's lifelong insistence\
    \ that the groups he led, no matter how often he changed personnel, must always\
    \ go by the same appellation, sometimes as just The Crooked Timber Of Humanity,\
    \ and sometimes as Bolivian Army Cadet Urbane Geistige Geist And The Crooked Timber\
    \ Of Humanity. He took the name from Immanuel Kant's observation that \u201Cout\
    \ of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made\u201D, and\
    \ it is tempting to see this as a less than subtle comment on that very first\
    \ line-up of evil-hearted robbers and violent thugs. (Incidentally, Dobson wrote\
    \ an out of print pamphlet entitled Nomenclature of Paraguayan Bandit Musicians\
    \ & Soviet Collective Farm Administrators Compared, in which he proposed that\
    \ Geist arrived at the name during a tarot reading. This is piffle.)\nSadly, no\
    \ recording exists of that very first group. By the time the LP Pelf And Cant\
    \ was released, with its magnificent trumpet-driven melodies, all but one of the\
    \ original band were either dead, imprisoned, or hiding in the hills. Geist was\
    \ supremely unconcerned at the almost total loss of his group, demonstrating for\
    \ the first time the ruthlessness which was to make him so feared. As Dave Pod\
    \ puts it in his Oral History Of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity, \u201CYou could\
    \ always tell when someone had done their time with Geist's band. Their hair was\
    \ prematurely white, most of their teeth had fallen out, and they walked, if they\
    \ were able to walk at all, on spavined legs. They trembled uncontrollably, burst\
    \ into tears every five minutes, and were unable to achieve closure on their issues\
    \ despite extensive, and expensive, therapy\u201D. Pod's own band became a sort\
    \ of rest home for ejected Crooked Timber, though artistically he is not fit to\
    \ lick Geist's boots. Nonetheless, one should not overlook the fact that by throwing\
    \ in their lot with Pod, the wrecked survivors of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity\
    \ were given a chance to play at the Eurovision Song Contest, something that was\
    \ unlikely to happen under Geist's iron rule. (He did, notoriously, attempt to\
    \ enter the competition when he kidnapped Kathy Kirby, but an international police\
    \ operation foiled his reprehensible, if entertaining, scheme. Many of us would\
    \ have given our eye teeth to witness that superb twenty-six strong line-up of\
    \ the band, all accordions, trombones and pounding drums, backing the British\
    \ songstress in the specially-written song Black Rubber Beelzebub.)\nHis Frostbitten\
    \ Limbs. Sappho In The Doldrums. Bad Gas And Forts. This was the trio of LPs that,\
    \ for many of us, cemented Geist's reputation. Released within the space of a\
    \ single month, containing between them no fewer than one hundred songs, shanties\
    \ and pop-madrigals, they still stand as one of the commanding achievements of\
    \ twentieth century music in any genre, vibrant, vivacious, vivid and even, at\
    \ times, deceptively cloth-eared. The story of those fractious recording sessions\
    \ has been told many times, notably in the memoir by lutenist Julian Beam, one\
    \ of the few band members who managed to remain in favour with Geist and appear\
    \ on all three LPs, although his contribution to Bad Gas And Forts consists of\
    \ a single string-pluck in the middle eight of The Gregory Peck Protein Imbalance\
    \ Song. By the time The Crooked Timber Of Humanity appeared on the television\
    \ show Pop Fabulousness! to promote its release as a single, Beam had been \u201C\
    consigned to the outer darkness\u201D as Geist always put it, and was hawking\
    \ his lute-playing skills at a variety of seaside resorts in exchange for the\
    \ price of a cake or bun for his dinner. By the time he came to write his book,\
    \ his arm was withered, his prematurely white hair was infested with beetles,\
    \ and he had all the telltale signs of an ex-Geistist.\nWhen we recorded the songs\
    \ on side one of His Frostbitten Limbs, wrote Beam, Geist had devised some new\
    \ ideas. He made us sleep in tents on the sloping roof of the studio, wear bells\
    \ on lanyards around our necks, and force fed us a grey, tasteless paste of his\
    \ own recipe. Every member of the band ballooned in weight and the constant clanging\
    \ of those bells sorely tried the engineer, who had to erase their clamour from\
    \ the tapes. The tents could not be properly secured to the concrete roof, and\
    \ there were violent gales throughout the month, so we got little sleep. Only\
    \ the hammer and tongs players, all six of them, were exempt from this regime.\
    \ They were put up in a luxury hotel and taken to exciting sporting events during\
    \ breaks. Geist himself spent most of the sessions smoking his pipe and making\
    \ lascivious phone calls to a floozie.\nElsewhere, Beam declared that no recording\
    \ session had given him such great joy, and he continued to idolise Geist for\
    \ the remainder of his life, until the day his pitiful wasted body collapsed in\
    \ a heap in a post office near the Blister Lane Bypass, and he was pronounced\
    \ dead. Reportedly, his dying words were \u201CUrbane Geistige Geist is a profound\
    \ and matchless genius and everyone should devote their lives to his work, as\
    \ I have been honoured to do, despite the feeble and broken carcass you see expiring\
    \ before your eyes on this post office floor near the Blister Lane Bypa\u2026\
    ..\u201D\nGeist himself was to die within a week. He had recorded over one hundred\
    \ and twenty LPs, played concerts in almost every country on earth, won the esteem\
    \ of a dedicated troop of followers, and been appointed as a Chevalier de Leo\
    \ Sayer in perpetuity. Countless times it had been foretold* that he would meet\
    \ his end at the hands of a vengeful, dismissed member of The Crooked Timber Of\
    \ Humanity. Fingers were pointed, even while the bandleader was still alive, at\
    \ bassoonist Ned Nightshade, the man who had played such a wonderful solo on a\
    \ reworking of The Snapping Turtles Of Old Cadiz, yet whose heart had shrivelled\
    \ and rotted when Geist sent him packing. Suspicions were raised, too, about Hetty\
    \ and Ingmar, the Norwegian teenagers who sang on over a dozen LPs but were sacked\
    \ from the band when Geist got himself into a flap about something or other.\n\
    In the event, the maestro was not murdered. One damp Sunday he was wheeling a\
    \ barrow of nettles over bracken, whistling the showstopper from his stage musical\
    \ version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs, when a bee landed on his hat. Geist had always\
    \ worn bee-proof hats until this fateful day, when a mix-up at the dry-cleaners'\
    \ found him for once in his life unprotected from bees. In a panic, he stopped\
    \ whistling and flew into convulsions. His head flushed purple, he gasped for\
    \ breath, and his tongue became puffy. He did not remove his hat, the fool. He\
    \ became snagged in the bracken, miles from civilisation, and by the time the\
    \ bee flew back to its hive, Geist had become hopelessly entangled. Unable to\
    \ free himself, he lay on his back, staring at the sky, and sang Roll Along Covered\
    \ Wagon, over and over again, until his last breath.\nRoll along covered wagon,\
    \ roll along, to the turn of your wheels I sing a song, city ladies may be fine,\
    \ but give me that girl of mine, roll along covered wagon, roll along. Going home\
    \ covered wagon going home, for this cowboy was never born to roam, 'long the\
    \ road that doesn't change, to that old bar twenty range, roll along covered wagon,\
    \ roll along. Yipee-teeyi, old timers, heading for your ranch house door, yipee-teeyi,\
    \ old timers, coral me so I'll never stray no more. Roll along covered wagon,\
    \ roll along. Come along old pal, let's get going. Roll along.\n*NOTE : But not\
