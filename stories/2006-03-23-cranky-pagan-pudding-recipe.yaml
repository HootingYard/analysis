  text: 'This all happened a long, long time ago, before you were born. It was a pagan
    time, a bit like The Wicker Man, but with no sign of extravagant bouffants, yellow
    polo-neck jumpers, and repressed police officers. Think more along the lines of
    flint arrowheads, woad, and grunting. When we turn our minds to ancient peoples,
    be they pagan sun-worshippers, cave dwellers, or marauding warriors, we tend to
    think of them as a homogenous mass rather than as a collection of individuals.
    We ascribe to them the sameness which is one of the more arresting characteristics
    of beings from other planets in science fiction--a common language, wardrobe,
    hairstyle, and so on. If we ever do meet alien life-forms, they will almost certainly
    be as multifarious as are living things on earth. This is, of course, no less
    true of our pagan ancestors.

    So I want you to consider that the pagan to whom we will now turn our attention
    was not just an inarticulate woad-daubed bog dweller wrapped in filthy animal
    hides--though he certainly fit that description--but that he had a personality,
    too, one that made him unique, as is every single one of God''s creatures. The
    name of this pagan has not come down to us, but what we do know is something of
    his character. He was cranky.

    Cranky, cantankerous, petulant, call it what you will. Had you been a primitive
    pagan, with matted hair, running sores, rotten teeth, and the distinct possibility
    of being laid upon a stone slab and sacrificed to the Sun God, you too might have
    thrown the occasional tantrum. Yet the capacity of the human spirit to cope with
    the most appalling circumstances is quite astonishing, and it has to be said that
    all of the cranky pagan''s compadres bore life''s ills with fortitude. The cranky
    pagan did not. He moaned and moped and grizzled and grumbled and flew into boiling
    tempers. He was moody and impossible.

    You might wonder why his companions did not shun him, or beat him about the head
    with clubs until he stopped being fractious, or indeed why they did not put him
    first on the list to have his heart torn from his breast and offered in trembling
    supplication to appease their enraged Sun God. We can not be sure that they had
    such a list, but archaeologists have found mysteriously neat scraping marks on
    certain stones, and it does not take a great stretch of the imagination to conclude
    that the marks were made by some pagan hierophant designating appointed victims.
    These ancient people may have been primitive by our standards, but they had a
    sense of order, and a system. Bureaucrats flourish in every time and every place,
    alas.

    Cranky he may have been, but the cranky pagan was a superb cook, and that is why
    he was not just tolerated but treasured. To gain some idea of just how much he
    was valued, imagine that all you have eaten for the last six months is the meat
    of birds and small mammals, usually raw, tearing at it ravenously with your aching
    teeth, blood dripping down your jaw. And then along comes the cranky pagan, growling
    and grunting as usual, but excitedly, and with a gleam in his eyes, shining brilliantly
    through the splattering of woad that covers his face. He points yonder, and jabbers,
    and beckons you to follow him. Wiping the blood of a weasel from your chin, you
    creak to your feet, and plod after the cranky pagan. He leads you to the edge
    of the bog. There, on a flat piece of ground, he has deposited a heap of goo.
    He bends, dips his grubby hand in it, scoops out some of the goo and shoves it
    into his mouth. He swallows, and then speaks. Obviously, he does not express himself
    in modern English, so in reporting what he says I have taken certain liberties.

    "Do not look so surprised to see me shovelling this goo into my mouth and swallowing
    it. You need not whirl your arms about in such alarm. I have invented pudding.
    I gathered a collection of nuts and berries and mashed them all together, and
    then I worked out a way of making the mash hot, with fire and flame, and this
    is the result. It is delicious. Try some."

    And there you have it. I only wish we knew precisely which nuts, which berries,
    went into this pudding, but we don''t, and perhaps we never will.
