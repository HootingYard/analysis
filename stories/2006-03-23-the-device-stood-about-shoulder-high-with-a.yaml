  text: "\u201CThe device stood about shoulder-high, with a star-shaped head, one\
    \ point of which could be opened. The head would contain the actual brain energy.\
    \ Its upper body, cylindrical in shape and of gleaming chrome, housed the output\
    \ units through which the brain would react, and also the controls. Antennas projecting\
    \ out on either side gave the look of arms. Its \u2018waist\u2019 was girdled\
    \ with a ring of repelatron radiators for exerting a repulsion force when it wanted\
    \ to move, by repelling itself away from nearby objects. Below the repelatrons\
    \ was an hourglass-shaped power unit, housing a solar-charged battery. The power\
    \ unit, in turn, was mounted on a pancake-shaped transportation unit. This unit\
    \ was equipped with both casters and a sort of caterpillar-crawler arrangement\
    \ for the contrivance to get about over obstacles. Inside was a gyro-stabilizer\
    \ to keep the whole device upright. Tom felt a glow of pride\u2014and eager impatience\u2014\
    as he inspected the device. If it worked as he hoped, this odd creature might\
    \ one day provide earth scientists with a priceless store of information about\
    \ intelligent life on Planet X!\u201D \u2014 Victor Appleton, Tom Swift And The\
    \ Visitor From Planet X"
