  text: '"The device stood about shoulder-high, with a star-shaped head, one point
    of which could be opened. The head would contain the actual brain energy. Its
    upper body, cylindrical in shape and of gleaming chrome, housed the output units
    through which the brain would react, and also the controls. Antennas projecting
    out on either side gave the look of arms. Its ''waist'' was girdled with a ring
    of repelatron radiators for exerting a repulsion force when it wanted to move,
    by repelling itself away from nearby objects. Below the repelatrons was an hourglass-shaped
    power unit, housing a solar-charged battery. The power unit, in turn, was mounted
    on a pancake-shaped transportation unit. This unit was equipped with both casters
    and a sort of caterpillar-crawler arrangement for the contrivance to get about
    over obstacles. Inside was a gyro-stabilizer to keep the whole device upright.
    Tom felt a glow of pride--and eager impatience--as he inspected the device. If
    it worked as he hoped, this odd creature might one day provide earth scientists
    with a priceless store of information about intelligent life on Planet X!" --
