  text: '"The following are a few of the mythological characters which play a part
    in many of the stories of the Passamaquoddies. They are all given on one of the
    cylinders of the phonograph. Kewok, a formless being with icy heart, and when
    mentioned regarded as a terrible one. Pedogiic, thunder. Pesok que tuk, lightning.
    Pook-jin-squess, the Jug, called also the toad woman. Glooscap, the beneficent
    being whose deeds are generally superhuman, and who figures in many heroic tales
    of the Passamaquoddies. The term as applied to a man is one of contempt. To call
    a man glooscap, or a woman glooscapess, is to call them liars. And there is Chematiquess,
    the big rabbit." -- J Walter Fewkes, Contribution To Passamaquoddy Folk-Lore'
