  text: "\u201CThe following are a few of the mythological characters which play a\
    \ part in many of the stories of the Passamaquoddies. They are all given on one\
    \ of the cylinders of the phonograph. Kewok, a formless being with icy heart,\
    \ and when mentioned regarded as a terrible one. Pedogiic, thunder. Pesok que\
    \ tuk, lightning. Pook-jin-squess, the Jug, called also the toad woman. Glooscap,\
    \ the beneficent being whose deeds are generally superhuman, and who figures in\
    \ many heroic tales of the Passamaquoddies. The term as applied to a man is one\
    \ of contempt. To call a man glooscap, or a woman glooscapess, is to call them\
    \ liars. And there is Chematiquess, the big rabbit.\u201D \u2014 J Walter Fewkes,\
