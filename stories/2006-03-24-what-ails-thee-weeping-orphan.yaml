  text: 'Due to hit the shelves of your local newsagent next month, What Ails Thee,
    Weeping Orphan? is a brand new weekly magazine, the brainchild of quondam poet
    Dennis Beerpint. It''s a surprising move for the notoriously reclusive versifier,
    who until now has published only slim volumes of bafflingly obscure work We sent
    Hooting Yard reporter Fatima Gilliblat to find out what he was up to.

    Gilliblat--There you are at last, you notorious recluse! I have been hammering
    on the door for about half an hour.

    Beerpint--Your persistence has paid off, tearing aside the protective veil of
    my notorious reclusiveness. Come in and sit yourself down on this wooden stool.

    Gilliblat--Do you not have a more comfortable seat?

    Beerpint--Would you prefer a beanbag chair?

    Gilliblat--I would, for a beanbag chair is like a modern update of the "Protean
    easy-chair" described in The Confidence-Man, His Masquerade by Herman Melville
    (1857).

    Beerpint--Ah yes, where he writes of "a chair so all over bejointed, behinged
    and bepaddled, every which way so elastic, springy, and docile to the airiest
    touch, that in some one of its endlessly changeable accommodations of back, seat,
    foot-board and arms, the most restless body, the body most racked, nay, I had
    almost added the most tormented conscience must, somehow and somewhere, find rest".
    Here you are.

    Gilliblat--Thank you. Now that I am suitably relaxed, I want to ask why a pipe-smoking,
    frazzle-haired poet of unrelenting seriousness is braving the cut-throat world
    of weekly magazines.

    Beerpint--The answer is quite simple. I began to wonder why it was that I could
    not look upon the shelves of magazines in my local newsagent without emitting
    a loud and long-drawn-out groan of despair. My brain fumed at being presented
    with endless variations of Celebrity Pap! and World o'' Hateful Chavs. No one
    was producing the magazine I wanted to read, so I have had to do it myself.

    Gilliblat--Hence What Ails Thee, Weeping Orphan?

    Beerpint--Precisely. A weekly magazine in which the only illustrations are mezzotints
    depicting pallid wretches engulfed by misery, perhaps standing frail and woebegone
    upon a blasted hillside in the teeth of a devastating storm, hungry and hollow-eyed,
    abandoned by Fate to a cruel ruination. A magazine in which the text is set in
    very small type, so it has to be peered at, straining the eyes, and in which the
    stories are long and wordy and unremitting in their gloom and dejection.

    Gilliblat--Well I shall be buying a copy! The slogan of Chat! magazine, as we
    know, is "Wit n'' Grit n'' Puzzles". Is there a catchy tagline for What Ails Thee,
    Weeping Orphan? "Doom n'' Gloom n'' Recipes", perhaps?

    Beerpint--I was thinking it might be "Shrieks n'' Sobs n'' Mezzotints", but that
    might be a bit melodramatic.

    Gilliblat--It might. Have you signed up an astrologer? "Your Stars" columns are
    always popular with readers.

    Beerpint--We''re not necessarily courting popularity, but I take your point. We''re
    not doing "Your Stars" as such, but "Your Biscuits" instead. Digestives, Rich
    Tea, Garibaldi, Cream Crackers...

    Gilliblat--And will you be running exciting competitions for readers?

    Beerpint--Indeed we will. In our launch issue there''s an opportunity to Win A
    Winding-Sheet. For the chance to win your very own funeral shroud, and to have
    your portrait painted in it while you''re still alive, just like John Donne, complete
    the following sentence: "The huge iron gates of the orphanage clanged shut, and
    tiny Prudence was left abandoned and..." When you have completed the sentence,
    add thousands more, until you have written a novel-length story of incalculable
    melancholy. The winning entry will be published as a supplement to the magazine.

    Gilliblat--It all sounds very exciting, I must say. You''re abandoning poetry,
    I take it?

    Beerpint--Certainly not! Huge swathes of the magazine will be taken up with my
    largely unread verse, in a special section entitled "Page Upon Page Of Impenetrable
    Screeds".

    Gilliblat--Have you attracted many advertisers?

    Beerpint--We have, though all the advertising space in the first issue has been
    taken up by David Blunkett with a plea of self-justification in an attempt to
    save his career yet again. It brought tears to his eyes, so let''s hope it works
    its magic on our readers!

    The launch issue of What Ails Thee, Weeping Orphan? will be available in two weeks''
    time from selected newsagents. Free gristle-rich bone for your dog with every
    copy.'
