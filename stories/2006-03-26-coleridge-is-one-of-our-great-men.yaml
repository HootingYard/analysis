  text: "\u201CColeridge is one of our great men who require many footnotes, for there\
    \ are characteristics of his which need all the extenuation they can get. How\
    \ comes it, for instance, that he could write, and not only write but publish,\
    \ in the same decade, and sometimes in the same year, poetry which is of our very\
    \ best, and some which for frozen inanity it would be hard to equal anywhere?\
    \ How could a thinker of his power of brain cover leagues of letter-paper with\
    \ windy nonsense and mawkish insincerity? And finally, of what quality was the\
    \ talk of one whose social life was entirely monologue?\u201D \u2014 Maurice Hewlett,\
    \ In A Green Shade"
