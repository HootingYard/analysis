  text: '"Coleridge is one of our great men who require many footnotes, for there
    are characteristics of his which need all the extenuation they can get. How comes
    it, for instance, that he could write, and not only write but publish, in the
    same decade, and sometimes in the same year, poetry which is of our very best,
    and some which for frozen inanity it would be hard to equal anywhere? How could
    a thinker of his power of brain cover leagues of letter-paper with windy nonsense
    and mawkish insincerity? And finally, of what quality was the talk of one whose
    social life was entirely monologue?" -- Maurice Hewlett, In A Green Shade'
