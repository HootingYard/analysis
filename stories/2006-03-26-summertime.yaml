  text: 'British Summer Time begins today. The clocks go forward by one hour, unless
    you believe The Guardian, which helpfully advised readers to turn their clocks
    back. As a result, thousands of people will be late for the traditional ceremony
    marking the start of summer, due to take place in thousands, if not millions,
    of homes across the land.
