  text: 'First instance. You are walking along a country lane as dusk descends. The
    path is muddy, but you are wearing a pair of stout Canadian Forestry Service boots.
    Crows caw from the trees, and from the direction of the lake you hear the demented
    cry of loons. Jauntily, you swing your stick through the air and whistle a half-remembered
    tune from the golden age of the hoochie-coochie dance band era. All of a sudden,
    your path is blocked by a diminutive figure. He is wearing a thrum nightcap and
    an ill-fitting suit of clothes. He has a goatee beard, a pasty complexion, and
    while one of his eyes is mischievously a-twinkle, the other seems dead, as if
    it were made of glass. He is carrying a little drum, and as he stands in front
    of you, he begins to pound it with his strangely muscular fist, arhythmically,
    even peskily. You step to one side, to stride past him, but he dodges in front
    of you. You step to the other side, but he springs sideways to forestall you,
    all the while banging his drum. Your temper rises. Brandishing your stick, you
    are about to belabour him about the head, but he anticipates your move, emits
    a sinister gurgling noise, and flits off into the trees as suddenly as he appeared.
    You walk on, no longer jaunty, but fractious and grim.

    Second instance. The arena is packed, and you stand at your lectern, looking out
    at the thousands of devotees who have gathered to hear your lecture. You enjoy
    nothing more than demolishing David Icke''s theory of intergalactic lizard people,
    and the talk you have prepared for tonight is perhaps your most cogent one to
    date. You clear your throat, and the huge crowd rustles into silence. All of a
    sudden, a diminutive figure crashes on to the stage at your side. He is wearing
    a thrum nightcap and an ill-fitting suit of clothes. He has a goatee beard, a
    pasty complexion, and while one of his eyes is mischievously a-twinkle, the other
    seems dead, as if it were made of glass. He snatches your lecture notes from the
    lectern, rips them into a thousand pieces, and casts them on the floor at your
    feet. Momentarily discombobulated, you become apoplectic with rage, and lurch
    towards the tiny man, intending to wring his neck. But before you can reach him,
    he flits away, and is instantly lost in the crowd. You had felt in such high spirits,
    and now you are fractious and grim.

    These two instances are fictional, of course, for you, the reader, have never
    been provoked in such a brazen manner by so diminutive a fellow in a thrum nightcap.
    My purpose in inventing these scenes was to give you an idea of what it was like
    to be accosted by Pindar Widgery, the pint-sized provocateur. Countless are those
    who have been so accosted. Each tells a similar story, that their mood was good,
    they were jaunty, in high spirits, when this tiny, goateed man in an ill-fitting
    suit, with that incongruous thrum nightcap atop his tiny head, appeared out of
    nowhere and provoked them to violence, violence he escaped by vanishing into a
    forest, or into a crowd, or even, according to some accounts, just going pfffft!
    in a puff of inexplicable vapour.

    Inexplicable indeed is the vapour into which he has now disappeared, for the last
    time. I am here to write his obituary. I know that, by convention, I ought to
    have begun by writing "Pindar Widgery, who has died aged ninety-two in a bobsleigh
    accident, was known as the pint-sized provocateur". That would have been the correct
    way to begin, but I wanted to break the news gently. And, in truth, I wanted to
    fill my allotted space with something, and, good grief, we know so little about
    Pindar Widgery''s life. Ancestry--unknown. Year of birth--unknown. Childhood--a
    mystery, save for an unreliable anecdote buried in a footnote in a biography of
    silver screen siren Edna Purviance. Formative influences--unknown. And so it goes
    on. We do not know when he decided to devote his life to pointless provocations,
    nor why. We can only guess that a smile crossed his lips when he was described
    in print as "the most exasperating man on the planet". We do not even know if
    that dead eye was made of glass. Perhaps all we can be sure of was that his presence,
    at such an advanced age, on a fully-crewed bobsleigh careering at terrifying speed
    in the snow-capped mountains of a cold and distant winter sports resort, must
    have been yet another provocative act.

    Oh, one other thing we know. Many witnesses have placed him indisputably on the
    sixth floor of the Texas Schoolbook Depository on Dealey Plaza in Dallas at noon
    on the 22nd of November 1962. I know this was exactly a year before the assassination
    of John F Kennedy, but still...
