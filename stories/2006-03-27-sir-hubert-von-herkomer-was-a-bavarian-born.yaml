  text: '"Sir Hubert von Herkomer was a Bavarian-born painter who founded an art school
    in Bushey [Hertfordshire] in the 1880s, and can also claim the distinction of
    having concocted, in a series of narrative paintings, all the Welsh druidic paraphernalia
    we now associate with that country''s Celtic prehistory. Herkomer made it all
    up in his studio, and his clients, rich Welsh industrialists, propagated his work
    at ersatz jamborees like the National Eisteddfod." -- Matthew Sweet, Inventing
    The Victorians'
