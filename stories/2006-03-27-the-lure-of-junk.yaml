  text: 'Finding one''s inbox crammed with junk emails is trying, although it is by
    no means top of the list of things that rouse my indignation. Pleasurable as it
    may be to embark upon a rant, I fear that in doing so Hooting Yard would fall
    victim to the tetchiness and spleen that sours so many websites. Readers do not
    alight here for that kind of thing, after all. We aim to instruct, edify, and
    entertain, and for those times when you are keen to read a litany of complaints,
    there are untold thousands of blogs and suchlike with names like Moaning Minnie
    and Getting In A Flap About Nothing In Particular. I may even start one myself.

    Where was I? Ah yes, junk emails. So often tiresome, but occasionally they can
    be amusing, as was one I received this morning, for the simple reason that it
    began "Dear Horse Enthusiast". After that, admittedly, it swiftly grew tedious.
    As the "owner of a horse-related website" I was being offered free inclusion in
    an equestrian directory, aiming to "improve the connection between people who
    provide horse-related information, services, and products and those who seek them".
    This seems to me an admirable service.

    I have never before thought of myself as a Horse Enthusiast, but perhaps Christine
    Wendin, who signed the letter, knows me better than I know myself. Ms Wendin is
    apparently the COO of the Equestrian Directory, which I take to indicate that
    she is its Chief Operating Officer, or similar, though she could conceivably be
    a Clairvoyant Old Ostrogoth, peering into an orb which reveals to her horse enthusiasts
    like myself who, for one reason or another, have so repressed our enthusiasm that
    we live empty lives in blithe ignorance of our true calling.

    I have given this much thought, and intend to print up a set of visiting cards
    reading Frank Key, Editor of Hooting Yard & Clairvoyantly Revealed Horse Enthusiast,
    perhaps emblazoned with a monogram of a horse''s head, or mane, or shanks.


    My lovely horse is the one on the right'
