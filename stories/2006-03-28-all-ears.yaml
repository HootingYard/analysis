  text: "It's an extraordinarily long time since we last had a Hooting Yard playlist,\
    \ way back on 7th October 2004 in fact. How time flies. Here, then, are ten pieces\
    \ of music that you might well hear if you happen to be wandering past the serried\
    \ belvederes of Haemoglobin Towers. In alphabetical order by title:\nElegie for\
    \ cello & piano\u2014Gabriel Faur\xE9\nEl Pueblo Unido Jamas Cera Vencido\u2014\
    Quilapayun\nFour Last Songs\u2014Richard Strauss\nFruits Of My Labour\u2014Lucinda\
    \ Williams\nGet Up\u2014Sleater-Kinney\nLakes Of Pontchartrain\u2014The Be Good\
    \ Tanyas\nNoye's Fludd\u2014Benjamin Britten\nThe Light Pours Out Of Me\u2014\
    Magazine\nThe Unborn Byron\u2014Slapp Happy\nTow-Truck\u2014Picastro\nAnd a special\
    \ mention must go to an eleventh piece, if only for the title:\nGrim And Frostbitten\
    \ Gay Bar\u2014Impaled Northern Moonforest"
