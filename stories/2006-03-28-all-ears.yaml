  text: 'It''s an extraordinarily long time since we last had a Hooting Yard playlist,
    way back on 7th October 2004 in fact. How time flies. Here, then, are ten pieces
    of music that you might well hear if you happen to be wandering past the serried
    belvederes of Haemoglobin Towers. In alphabetical order by title:

    Elegie for cello & piano--Gabriel Faure

    El Pueblo Unido Jamas Cera Vencido--Quilapayun

    Four Last Songs--Richard Strauss

    Fruits Of My Labour--Lucinda Williams

    Get Up--Sleater-Kinney

    Lakes Of Pontchartrain--The Be Good Tanyas

    Noye''s Fludd--Benjamin Britten

    The Light Pours Out Of Me--Magazine

    The Unborn Byron--Slapp Happy

    Tow-Truck--Picastro

    And a special mention must go to an eleventh piece, if only for the title:

    Grim And Frostbitten Gay Bar--Impaled Northern Moonforest'
