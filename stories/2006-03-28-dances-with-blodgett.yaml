  text: "One of the more outlandish episodes in Blodgett's frankly debauched life\
    \ was the time he opened a dancing school, or, to give it its correct title, Doctor\
    \ Blodgett's Terpsichorean Academy For Keen Young Chaps. It goes without saying\
    \ that the rascal was not a doctor of any kind. Nor, it must be said, did he have\
    \ any skills as a dancer, short of flinging himself around a room, knees and elbows\
    \ akimbo, like some ungainly puppet whose handler is having convulsions.\nAny\
    \ keen young chap who enrolled in the Academy hoping to learn how to disport himself\
    \ with aplomb in a quadrille, foxtrot or even the mashed potato, was quickly disillusioned.\
    \ \u201CDoctor\u201D Blodgett's musical tastes were narrow and intense. He was\
    \ a devotee of a particularly rigorous form of Teutonic improvisation, open-ended\
    \ pieces that often lasted for hours on end, performed by earnest young men with\
    \ incipient beards whose brows furrowed as they tinkered with deliberately out\
    \ of tune violas, trombones, bells, and thunderous pounding drums. Blodgett devised\
    \ his own dances to this screeching racket, the most notorious of which was called,\
    \ for no apparent reason, the Mustard Plaster.\nAs luck would have it, a record\
    \ of Blodgett's instructions for this dance survived the inferno which laid waste\
    \ the Academy just a month after it opened. Blodgett, of course, vanished as soon\
    \ as he got his hands on the insurance money, and as far as we know never taught\
    \ dance again. Thus what is presented here is a piece of history that could so\
    \ easily have been lost forever. But now you too can learn how to \u201CDo The\
    \ Mustard Plaster!\u201D, by following the notes written by Blodgett himself.\n\
    \nFigure One. Let us call the dancers Basil (left) and Guido (right). They take\
    \ up positions facing each other as shown, pointing with their sticks. Basil's\
    \ stick is cut from a sycamore tree, and has traces of birdlime upon it. Guido's\
    \ is made of plastic. The symbolism is clear. They maintain this stance, staring\
    \ fixedly at each other, until I snap my fingers.\n\nFigure Two. Basil raises\
    \ his stick, upwards and forwards. Guido essays a series of twirls, jumps, and\
    \ hops, and crashes his body as hard and as fast as possible into all four walls\
    \ of the studio. If his hat falls off, he must replace it in a single, fluid motion,\
    \ full of elegance and grace. He then takes a flying leap to return to his starting\
    \ point, and raises his plastic stick to meet Basil's.\n\nFigure Three. It is\
    \ now Basil's turn to jump about and hurl himself at the walls, while Guido stands\
    \ absolutely still with his stick above his head. Basil should flounce, however,\
    \ rather than trying to emulate Guido's more frenetic movements. He should nudge\
    \ the walls rather than buffet them, and sashay back to his starting position\
    \ with an air of insouciance. When he is once again opposite Guido, he punches\
    \ him in the throat.\n\nFigure Four. To the insistent clanging of bells, Guido\
    \ leans backwards, balancing his stick on his forehead. Basil takes hold of his\
    \ necktie, but not tightly. They rotate a full 360 degrees, pretending to be figurines\
    \ in a decorative snow-shaker. This takes consummate skill, and the difficulty\
    \ of teaching this movement explains the supplementary fee tacked on to the standard\
    \ cost of this lesson, to be paid in cash.\n\nFigure Five. Having completed a\
    \ full rotation, Basil adopts a heroic pose while Guido splays himself on the\
    \ floor. At a snap of my fingers, Basil crumples and Guido gets up, shimmies,\
    \ vaults over Basil, and in rapid succession essays a quadrille, foxtrot, and\
    \ mashed potato solo. Basil gets to his feet. They throw their sticks out of an\
    \ open window, and clutch each other like lovers on a hilltop during a thunderstorm.\
    \ A parp from the trombone brings the dance to an end."
