  text: '"Does any boy''s conscience smite him at my naming the insects? I hope not.
    I hope you have not been tempted by Satan to do any harm to the little harmless,
    and often useful, creatures that cross your path. A butterfly, a cockchaffer,
    a house-fly, a snail, a caterpillar, a worm--these, and all others, are God''s
    handy-work; and if you could see them through a glass that magnifies very much
    indeed, you would be more astonished than I can tell you." -- Charlotte Elizabeth,
    Kindness To Animals, Or, The Sin Of Cruelty Exposed And Rebuked'
