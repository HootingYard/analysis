  text: "\u201CDoes any boy's conscience smite him at my naming the insects? I hope\
    \ not. I hope you have not been tempted by Satan to do any harm to the little\
    \ harmless, and often useful, creatures that cross your path. A butterfly, a cockchaffer,\
    \ a house-fly, a snail, a caterpillar, a worm\u2014these, and all others, are\
    \ God's handy-work; and if you could see them through a glass that magnifies very\
    \ much indeed, you would be more astonished than I can tell you.\u201D \u2014\
    \ Charlotte Elizabeth, Kindness To Animals, Or, The Sin Of Cruelty Exposed And\
