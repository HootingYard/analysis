  text: "(To the tune of Bring Me Your Winding-Sheet, Oh Mother Of Mine)\nCold and\
    \ dark is this awful night, as I shiver in my shed. The Lord He has forsaken me\
    \ and deprived me of my bed. I have no pies nor pastries to shovel down my gob.\
    \ Oh the Lord He has forsaken me. All I can do is sob.\nI weep in my allotment\
    \ shed, I weep until the dawn. I curse the very buttercups upon the village lawn.\
    \ The Lord He has forsaken me and I am so forlorn. I wail and gnash my rotting\
    \ teeth that I was ever born.\nMy name is Leo Sayer, I am short, with frizzy hair.\
    \ I sit here in my wooden shed upon a wooden chair. I curse the fact that I share\
    \ my name with a singer of pop pap, and then I spill my flask of boiling tea into\
    \ my lap.\nThe Lord He has forsaken me, all I can do is whine. O Lord God Almighty,\
    \ please send me a sign. Please stop people thinking that I'm the singer Leo S,\
    \ the small-of-stature minstrel who got me in this mess.\nHe fled to the Antipodes,\
    \ or so I have been told. He moved across the globe because his records undersold.\
    \ It seems the Lord forsook him too, but that is only right. I sob and wail in\
    \ my shed on this dark and awful night.\nDETOURS : Muggletonian Celestial Prints\
    \ \u2026 Rapture Ready \u2026 Nice Cup Of Tea And A Sit Down"
