    Cold and dark is this awful night, as I shiver in my shed. The Lord He has forsaken
    me and deprived me of my bed. I have no pies nor pastries to shovel down my gob.
    Oh the Lord He has forsaken me. All I can do is sob.

    I weep in my allotment shed, I weep until the dawn. I curse the very buttercups
    upon the village lawn. The Lord He has forsaken me and I am so forlorn. I wail
    and gnash my rotting teeth that I was ever born.

    My name is Leo Sayer, I am short, with frizzy hair. I sit here in my wooden shed
    upon a wooden chair. I curse the fact that I share my name with a singer of pop
    pap, and then I spill my flask of boiling tea into my lap.

    The Lord He has forsaken me, all I can do is whine. O Lord God Almighty, please
    send me a sign. Please stop people thinking that I''m the singer Leo S, the small-of-stature
    minstrel who got me in this mess.

    He fled to the Antipodes, or so I have been told. He moved across the globe because
    his records undersold. It seems the Lord forsook him too, but that is only right.
    I sob and wail in my shed on this dark and awful night.
