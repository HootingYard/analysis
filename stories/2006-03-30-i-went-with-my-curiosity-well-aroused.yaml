  text: "\u201CI went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer old person half demon\
    \ and half man who has an idol-shop in a byway of the City and who keeps me informed\
    \ of affairs of the Edge of the World. And briefly over a pinch of heather incense\
    \ that he takes by way of snuff he gave me this tremendous information: that Mr.\
    \ Neepy Thang the son of Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World and\
    \ was even now in London.\u201D \u2014 Lord Dunsany, The Last Book Of Wonder"
