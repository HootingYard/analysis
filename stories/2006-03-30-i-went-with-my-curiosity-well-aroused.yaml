  text: '"I went with my curiosity well aroused to a queer old person half demon and
    half man who has an idol-shop in a byway of the City and who keeps me informed
    of affairs of the Edge of the World. And briefly over a pinch of heather incense
    that he takes by way of snuff he gave me this tremendous information: that Mr.
    Neepy Thang the son of Thangobrind had returned from the Edge of the World and
    was even now in London." -- Lord Dunsany, The Last Book Of Wonder'
