  text: "For a brief period in the middle of the last century, the phrase \u201Ctwo\
    \ men in a boat\u201D tripped off the tongue as easily as the more familiar Three\
    \ Men In A Boat of Jerome K* Jerome's comic novel. It was a very brief period,\
    \ no more than a fortnight, but during that time the whole world was a-buzz with\
    \ Basil and Guido's Kropotkin Fanfaronade. Unusually for a dance routine in praise\
    \ of a totemic anarchist, performed on a rowing boat to the accompaniment of a\
    \ shorebound orchestra, dance band, light show, perfumes and fireworks, it captured\
    \ the popular mood. Thousands of people\u2014some say millions\u2014trekked to\
    \ the lake near Bodger's Spinney to witness the spectacle during its two-week\
    \ run, and Basil and Guido became overnight celebrities, fawned over in what,\
    \ with retrospect, was an outbreak of mass hysteria. Within days of the final\
    \ performance, during which an orphan child in the audience became overexcited\
    \ and was clonked on the head with an oar, the whole thing was forgotten.\nTrudging\
    \ around the lake today, it is hard to picture the ecstatic scenes that took place\
    \ here fifty years ago. There are no longer any boats to be seen, and the lake\
    \ itself is surrounded by a tall electrified security fence. It is said that monstrous\
    \ aquatic beings with flippers and tendrils swim and writhe below the surface,\
    \ or that the water is poisoned, or even that the lake is haunted by the shade\
    \ of that orphan child, though she only suffered mild concussion and lived long\
    \ after the oar incident. These are just stories, believed only by the credulous,\
    \ but what is beyond doubt, and readily apparent to anyone who wanders there,\
    \ as I do, is that the lake is dead, choked by weeds, choked beyond hope.\nIt\
    \ was so different on the bright summer afternoon in 1951 when Basil and Guido\
    \ disembarked from their hired charabanc and stood hand in hand, rapt in wonder,\
    \ before laying out their picnic rug by the jetty. Freshly graduated from Doctor\
    \ Blodgett's Terpsichorean Academy For Keen Young Chaps (see below, 28th March),\
    \ the ill-matched duo were touring the land seeking a lake, pond, or other body\
    \ of water on which to stage their Kropotkin Fanfaronade.\nThe spark of the idea\
    \ came from Guido. Guido's brain was thick with Bible-learning, but he held the\
    \ Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921) in high esteem, having fallen\
    \ under his spell after reading a translated copy of \u201CResearch On The Ice\
    \ Age\u201D, an article Kropotkin published in Notices of the Imperial Russian\
    \ Geographical Society in 1876. Thereafter, impressionable young Guido devoured\
    \ everything by the Russian he could lay his hands on. When Blodgett demanded\
    \ that his students choose a subject to interpret via the medium of dance, Guido\
    \ was already decided.\n\nPeter Kropotkin\nBasil, roped in as collaborator, was\
    \ initially reluctant until shown a photograph of Kropotkin, whose beard thrilled\
    \ him, as no doubt it would thrill anyone who has the slightest interest in majestic\
    \ nineteenth century facial hair. It was Basil who brought to their partnership\
    \ the rowing boat element, possibly because he misunderstood Blodgett's instructions.\
    \ Basil was by no means stupid, but he was notoriously inattentive. We should\
    \ be glad it was so, for who can imagine the Kropotkin Fanfaronade taking place\
    \ on dry land? By confining the dance to the limited space afforded by a rowing\
    \ boat, Basil forced himself and Guido to find radical solutions to seemingly\
    \ intractable problems. Ideal as it was as a stage upon which to show Kropotkin's\
    \ periods of imprisonment, in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St Petersburg, and\
    \ later in France, the rowing boat had to be wholly re-imagined when the dance\
    \ addressed the anarchist's field trips to Finnish and Swedish glaciers. Basil\
    \ and Guido succeeded triumphantly.\nA fanfaronade can be defined as an ostentatious\
    \ display. It certainly was. There was the rowing boat on the lake, with the two\
    \ dancers aboard, pirouetting, jumping about, striking poses, and of course rowing,\
    \ while on the shore a full orchestra supplemented by a dance band with a slick\
    \ crooner played what can only be described as very frightening music. Guido's\
    \ parents, meanwhile, were scampering around operating the light show and the\
    \ complex piping system that sent jets of exotic perfumes wafting over the crowds.\n\
    And yet, and yet\u2026 what ought to have been the beginning of a whole new strand\
    \ of rowing boat-based dance extravaganzas, with Basil and Guido the pioneers\
    \ and masters of the form, was in the end just a flash in the pan. Though they\
    \ had sold enough tickets to keep the Kropotkin Fanfaronade running well beyond\
    \ its two-week run, Bodger's Spinney bye-laws meant it had to end. In any event,\
    \ Guido now fell victim to the jangles and was carted off to a mysterious clinic\
    \ hewn into an inaccessible mountainside, and Basil became a bus conductor. They\
    \ never worked together again.\nFURTHER READING : The literature on Basil and\
    \ Guido is hopeless and inadequate, written as it is chiefly by management consultants.\
    \ There is a fad for applying the lessons of the Kropotkin Fanfaronade to what\
    \ these craven wretches call \u201Cthe exciting world of the modern business environment\u201D\
    . Basil, Guido, and Peter Kropotkin himself must be turning in their graves, and\
    \ I would too, if I was entombed.\n*NOTE : K for Klapka.\nDETOURS : De Humani\
