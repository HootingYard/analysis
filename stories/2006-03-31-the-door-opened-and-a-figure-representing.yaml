  text: "\u201CThe door opened, and a figure representing the Roman Catholic idea\
    \ of his Satanic Majesty entered the room. He was very black, and covered with\
    \ long hair, probably the skin of some wild animal. He had two long white tusks,\
    \ two horns on his head, a large cloven foot, and a long tail that he drew after\
    \ him on the floor. He looked so frightful, and recalled to my mind so vividly\
    \ the figure that I saw at the White Nunnery, that I was very much frightened;\
    \ still I did not believe it was really a supernatural being. I suspected that\
    \ it was one of the priests dressed up in that way to frighten us.\u201D \u2014\
