  text: '"The door opened, and a figure representing the Roman Catholic idea of his
    Satanic Majesty entered the room. He was very black, and covered with long hair,
    probably the skin of some wild animal. He had two long white tusks, two horns
    on his head, a large cloven foot, and a long tail that he drew after him on the
    floor. He looked so frightful, and recalled to my mind so vividly the figure that
    I saw at the White Nunnery, that I was very much frightened; still I did not believe
    it was really a supernatural being. I suspected that it was one of the priests
    dressed up in that way to frighten us." -- Sarah J Richardson, Life In The Grey
    Nunnery At Montreal'
