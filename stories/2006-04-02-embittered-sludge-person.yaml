  text: "Q\u2014Did Dobson ever receive death threats from a vengeful maniac?\nA\u2014\
    Yes, he did. When he was living in the village of Mustard Parva he turned his\
    \ attention to rural matters and wrote a pamphlet\u2014now out of print\u2014\
    entitled My Revolutionary New Method Of Moving Sludge Around The Countryside.\
    \ A copy fell into the hands of the village sludge person, a peasant whose job\
    \ it was to push his barrow of sludge along country lanes, from a field to a barn,\
    \ or from a ditch to a coppice, or from a farmyard to a pond*.\nThe village sludge\
    \ person was unable to read, but was so entranced by the picture on the cover\
    \ that he took the pamphlet to Mistress Spinoza, who taught the village urchins.\n\
    \u201CHail, oh sludge person!\u201D she cried, as he crashed into her schoolroom,\
    \ holding the pamphlet as if it were a hot pie, \u201CI shall lock the urchins\
    \ in a dark cupboard so they do not get up to any mischief while I read Dobson's\
    \ latest pamphlet to you!\u201D\nAs soon as her forty-seven snivelling, whimpering\
    \ charges had been safely confined, and heavy iron bolts drawn across the cupboard\
    \ door, she rattled through the pamphlet as the sludge person listened, at first\
    \ with curiosity, then with growing rage.\nToo many of today's peasants simply\
    \ do not know how to move sludge, or indeed any other kind of rustic matter, along\
    \ the lanes of our bosky and idyllic countryside, wrote Dobson, so I have invented\
    \ a fantastic new technique, wholesome yet valiant, impeccable yet louche, which,\
    \ if put into effect, will utterly transform the movement of sludge from, say,\
    \ a barnyard to a trench, or vice versa. Mark my words, he continued, as a red\
    \ mist descended over the listening sludge person, unless the peasantry follows\
    \ this incredibly exciting new scheme, our land will fall into desuetude and ruin.\
    \ Do not say you have not been warned!\nMistress Spinoza handed the pamphlet back\
    \ to the sludge person and steered him into the kitchenette attached to the schoolroom.\
    \ She made him drink a draught of Doctor Gillespie's Brain Calming Syrup, and\
    \ as he tottered away on his spindly legs, she hoped that his anger would subside.\n\
    \nQ\u2014Did his anger so subside under the influence of Doctor Gillespie's excellent\
    \ syrup?\nA\u2014No, it did not, for unbeknown to her, Mistress Spinoza had bought\
    \ a rogue bottle of the syrup, laced with ingredients which served only to inflame\
    \ the sludge person's temper. He went directly from the schoolroom to Dobson's\
    \ cabin, and hammered on the door like a crazed thing.\nDobson was not amenable\
    \ to unexpected visitors. Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, he had had his Person\
    \ from Porlock moments, and he had taken to stuffing his ears with rags while\
    \ at work. Imagine then, how a hot-tempered peasant bashing on Dobson's door would\
    \ become increasingly splenetic as the hours passed. He was nothing if not persistent,\
    \ this sludge person, for he continued to beat his hairy fists on the door for\
    \ three hours, until exhaustion, agony, bruising, blood, and broken bones made\
    \ him stop. All the while, a deliberately deafened Dobson was writing another\
    \ pamphlet, this one on the subject of X-ray vision, dust, and fruit pastilles.\
    \ The sludge person lay slumped in the doorway for a further hour before crawling\
    \ back to his shabby hovel, where he sprawled on a mattress riddled with weevils\
    \ and other tiny scurrying beasts, plotting Dobson's downfall.\nQ\u2014May I ask\
    \ what angered him so?\nA\u2014You may. The pamphleteer's revolutionary new method\
    \ of moving sludge around the countryside threatened him. It threatened his livelihood,\
    \ but more importantly it threatened his pride. The sludge person had inherited\
    \ his job from his father, who had inherited it from his father, who had taken\
    \ the job over from his father, and so on, yea unto generations past. So long\
    \ as sludge had been moved around the lanes of Mustard Parva and thereabouts,\
    \ this peasant's family had been in the thick of it. Now along came this pamphleteer\
    \ with his peanut-shaped hat and his Paraguayan Detective Inspector's jacket,\
    \ and not only did he have the temerity to live in the cabin where once Old Mother\
    \ Weltschmerz had read the runes and done weird things with hamsters, but he was\
    \ putting it about that there were other, better ways to move sludge.\nAnd so,\
    \ as I said, he plotted Dobson's doom. He began, next morning, by going back to\
    \ the schoolhouse, just as Mistress Spinoza was letting the urchins out of the\
    \ grim dark cupboard.\n\u201CTop of the morning to you, oh sludge person!\u201D\
    \ she yelled, \u201CWould you like me to read Dobson's pamphlet to you once again?\u201D\
    \nThe sludge person explained that, on the contrary, this time he wanted her to\
    \ write a letter on his behalf.\n\u201CThen let me get my ink and nib,\u201D she\
    \ said, as she corralled the pallid consumptive infants back into their cupboard\
    \ so she would be able to write undisturbed.\n\u201CDear Pamphleteer,\u201D dictated\
    \ the sludge person, as Mistress Spinoza inscribed his words in her neatest copperplate,\
    \ \u201CI know how to move sludge and I am going to put you to death for threatening\
    \ my livelihood and injuring my pride, exclamation mark.\u201D\nHe had lain upon\
    \ his filthy mattress all night, embittered and impassioned, devising the exact\
    \ wording for his letter, and now that it was written he sat back on the sawdust\
    \ of the schoolroom floor, smug and content, as if the threatened deed had already\
    \ been accomplished. Then he noticed that the schoolmistress was peering at him,\
    \ and the look on her face was one of dismay and contempt.\n\u201CThis will never\
    \ do,\u201D she announced, tearing the letter to shreds before the ink was even\
    \ dry, \u201CI will not be party to threats of violence. You ought to be ashamed\
    \ of yourself. I have a good mind to lock you in the cupboard with the urchins.\
    \ In fact, that is exactly what I am going to do.\u201D\nMistress Spinoza was\
    \ a slight woman, rake-thin and not much taller than the tots she taught, but\
    \ she had inherited inhuman physical strength from her parents, a pair of circus\
    \ artistes known professionally as Herculean Strongman Gervase Spinoza And His\
    \ Equally Herculean Wife Constance. Now, their daughter picked up the peasant\
    \ by his grubby collar and deposited him in the cupboard. No sooner had she done\
    \ so than Dobson appeared.\n\u201CYou are harbouring a peasant who has threatened\
    \ me with death!\u201D he announced, \u201CAnd I know this is so because I have\
    \ been experimenting with a futuristic telepathy device made of rubber, gutta\
    \ percha, funnels, wiring, batteries, Coddington lenses and complicated electric\
    \ circuitry. Ha!\u201D \u2014 at this point he pointed to the torn up scraps of\
    \ the letter in Mistress Spinoza's waste paper basket\u2014\u201CCan you deny\
    \ it is so?\u201D\nWithout a word, Mistress Spinoza led the fuming pamphleteer\
    \ to the kitchenette, took the rags out of his ears, and made him a nice cup of\
    \ tea, which she laced with six droplets of Baxter's Terrible Liquid Nerve Suppressant,\
    \ \u201Cguaranteed\u201D \u2014 according to the label\u2014\u201Cto render the\
    \ most tempestuous hot-head comatose for up to a week\u201D. This had been purchased\
    \ from a reputable supplier, and Dobson soon fell into a swoon.\nLater, the resourceful\
    \ schoolmistress let the peasant out of the cupboard and had him load Dobson onto\
    \ his wheelbarrow and take him home. Then she sat down at her escritoire and fired\
    \ off a pamphlet of her own, entitled A Counterblast To The Mad Ideas Propounded\
    \ By Dobson Regarding The Movement Of Sludge Around Our Lovely Countryside, and\
    \ sent one of the urchins off with it to the printers.\n\nBy the time Dobson woke\
    \ up six days later, all the talk in the village was of Mistress Spinoza's bonkers\
    \ but brilliantly-argued philippic. No one was interested anymore in half-baked\
    \ schemes to revolutionise the movement of sludge around the lanes of Mustard\
    \ Parva. Dobson turned his attention to other things (jawbones, knitwear, Hedy\
    \ Lamarr), and as dusk fell on that hot, sun-battered day, the sludge person,\
    \ no longer embittered, could be seen pushing his wheelbarrow piled high with\
    \ sludge up Pang Hill towards the orchard, as he and his ancestors had always\
    \ done, and always would, throughout eternity, like Sisyphus.\n*NOTE : This may\
    \ have been the same peasant who planned to sell Mary Goldchew, the Savage Infant\
    \ of Splat, to a zoo. See Feral Childhood, 30th March.\nDETOURS : The Child's\
