  text: '"The true house fly is very abundant in localities where little or no horse
    manure is found, and in such cases it breeds in other manure, such as chicken
    manure in backyard poultry lots, or in slops or fermenting vegetable material,
    such as spent hops, moist bran, ensilage, or rotting potatoes." -- L O Howard
    & F C Bishopp, The House Fly And How To Suppress It'
