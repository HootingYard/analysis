  text: "As I wend my slightly crumpled way through the world, there is one question\
    \ I am asked more often than any other. Readers of this website and those who\
    \ listen to Hooting Yard On The Air, the weekly radio show on ResonanceFM, will\
    \ buttonhole me at bus stops or as I trudge around Nameless Pond, and say, usually\
    \ in importunate tones, \u201CFrank, why is it that you are so obsessed with the\
    \ fact that a few years ago Peter Maxwell Davies found an electrocuted whooper\
    \ swan, took it home, cooked it and ate it?\u201D\nRegular readers will know that\
    \ I have referred more than once to the swan-eating habits of the contemporary\
    \ British composer, who is also the Master of the Queen's Music (whatever that\
    \ might mean). And here I am beetling away at the topic again. Why does it exert\
    \ such a fascination upon me?\nOh, I could tell some long and involved story about\
    \ my invented ornithological past, but I am not going to. I will simply say this.\
    \ Max, as he is known to his chums, was interviewed by the police when they saw\
    \ a dead swan hanging outside his Orcadian retreat. They were concerned because\
    \ all swans are the property of the Queen. (I assume this means all British swans,\
    \ as opposed to every single swan throughout the world, but I am prepared to be\
    \ corrected on this detail. Commonwealth swans, too, possibly belong to Mrs Saxe-Coburg-Gotha-Windsor.\
    \ Maybe.) Anyway, I was wondering if a meeting had to be called where the Master\
    \ of the Queen's Music, still digesting that whooper swan, was hauled before the\
    \ Keeper of the Queen's Swans to explain just what he thought he was doing, stealing\
    \ food from the monarch.\nIt was then I learned that the post of Keeper of the\
    \ Queen's Swans\u2014the only job I ever really wanted\u2014had been abolished\
    \ in 1993. Reactionaries complain that the \u201CNew\u201D Labour government is\
    \ destroying traditions and institutions that have defined this country for centuries,\
    \ but here was a case of flagrant and senseless cultural vandalism from the Conservative\
    \ administration of John Major. I began to understand the true reasons for that\
    \ Labour landslide in 1997. It all came down to the Cones Hotline and the abolition\
    \ of the Keeper of the Queen's Swans!\nI admit that I carried myself with an air\
    \ of smugness, having identified one of the hidden threads of late twentieth century\
    \ history. But I was in for a shock. In fact, what I learned next meant that my\
    \ theory crumbled to dust, to ashes and dust. Yes, it was certainly true that\
    \ there was no longer a Keeper of the Queen's Swans. And no, the position had\
    \ not been replaced by zonk-eyed bean-counting management consultants under a\
    \ public-private partnership initiative, whose first decision would have been\
    \ to give it a trendy new name like Swansignia. What actually happened was that\
    \ the post was replaced by two brand new offices, the Warden of the Queen's Swans\
    \ and the Marker of the Queen's Swans. This made me so happy that I burst into\
    \ tears. Now all I need to do is wait for one of the post-holders to resign or\
    \ die. Wish me luck.\nThe above may not have answered that frequently asked question,\
    \ but I am sure it is a topic we shall return to again. And again."
