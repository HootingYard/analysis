  text: 'A few weeks ago, on 20th February, Hooting Yard provided full instructions
    for Saving Your Swan in the event of a bird flu pandemic. Clearly, the gritty
    northern folk who live in Cellardyke up in Scotland took absolutely no notice.


    I love the way the Daily Mail manages to inject a note of patriotic fervour. We
    don''t care tuppence about all those foreign birds, it implies, but this was a
    British swan, dammit! I hope they sent a reporter to hand-deliver a message of
    condolence to our bereaved monarch (see Frequently Asked Question, yesterday).'
