  text: "\u201CThere seems to be no good reason why a man's way of sharpening a pencil\
    \ is any better than a woman's. It is difficult to see just why it is advisable\
    \ to cover the thumb with powdered graphite, and expose that useful member to\
    \ possible amputation by a knife directed uncompromisingly toward it, when the\
    \ pencil might be pointed the other way, the risk of amputation avoided, and the\
    \ shavings and pulverised graphite left safely to the action of gravitation and\
    \ centrifugal force. Yet the entire race of men refuse to see the true value of\
    \ the feminine method, and, indeed, any man would rather sharpen any woman's pencil\
    \ than see her do it herself.\u201D \u2014 Myrtle Reed, The Spinster Book"
