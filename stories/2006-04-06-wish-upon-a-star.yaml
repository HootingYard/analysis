  text: 'When you wish upon a star, you are almost certainly wasting your time. It
    is surely not sensible to hope that your future can be in any way influenced by
    a piece of burning rock hurtling around in space, billions of miles away. Considering
    such behaviour objectively, it would not be unkind to say that you are deluded,
    if not completely bonkers. In a crueller age, you would probably have been locked
    up, or worse.

    One can imagine, perhaps, some mediaeval person standing in a field, staring up
    at the night sky, peering at a faraway star, then closing their eyes briefly,
    the better to concentrate, and mumbling a wish. Suddenly there is the sound of
    galloping hooves, and a detachment of horsemen from Prince Fulgencio''s palace
    comes to a halt in front of the wishing peasant.

    "Hail, peasant of the night," their leader might say, an evil smile playing about
    his thin lips, "What are you about?"

    The peasant, knowing how dangerous the Prince''s henchmen are, dissembles, muttering
    something about collecting night-potatoes, or some otherwise innocent deed. The
    captain of the horsemen cackles, and his companions laugh too, as if they are
    sharing a joke.

    "The Prince will be mighty pleased!" says the captain, wiping spittle from his
    chin with the sleeve of a rich purple tunic made of cloth so expensive that the
    peasant gasps at the sight of it, "You must come with us and tell the Prince that
    his realm has been blessed with potatoes in the sky!" There is a menacing pause.
    "For you were looking up at the firmament, were you not, rather than down in the
    muck where potatoes are usually found?"

    The peasant knows he is in trouble now, and tries to flee, but he is captured,
    taken back to Prince Fulgencio''s castle, and chained up in an oubliette. Though
    harsh, the Prince''s orders to his henchman make sense, as he does not want his
    temporal power threatened by a peasantry who owe allegiance to stars, planets,
    other heavenly bodies, or indeed to any system of supernatural hocus pocus that
    he cannot control.

    Such rigour is pooh-poohed in our more enlightened age, but not everywhere. There
    are still lands where the modern equivalents of Prince Fulgencio will have a stargazer
    stoned to death, or chop off their head. Over here we have taken a therapeutic
    route, and nowadays, if you stand in a field at night wishing upon a star, you
    are likely to be picked up by Social Services and given counselling until you
    achieve closure. The inference is the same, however, that by relying upon distant
    twinkling lights in the sky as a guide to your future, you are clearly a loon.

    When you wish upon a star, in the modern age, it is best if you use the word star
    figuratively. It is quite acceptable for you to wish upon such "stars" as Kevin
    Costner or Mel Gibson, Celine Dion or that Chantelle girl from Big Brother. This
    is seen as not only acceptable and safe, but is positively encouraged. Indeed,
    I get the impression that it is becoming compulsory.

    And my wish? Bring back Prince Fulgencio and his henchmen, and set them to do
    their worst at Celebrity Pap! magazine.
