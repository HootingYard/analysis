  text: "When you wish upon a star, you are almost certainly wasting your time. It\
    \ is surely not sensible to hope that your future can be in any way influenced\
    \ by a piece of burning rock hurtling around in space, billions of miles away.\
    \ Considering such behaviour objectively, it would not be unkind to say that you\
    \ are deluded, if not completely bonkers. In a crueller age, you would probably\
    \ have been locked up, or worse.\nOne can imagine, perhaps, some mediaeval person\
    \ standing in a field, staring up at the night sky, peering at a faraway star,\
    \ then closing their eyes briefly, the better to concentrate, and mumbling a wish.\
    \ Suddenly there is the sound of galloping hooves, and a detachment of horsemen\
    \ from Prince Fulgencio's palace comes to a halt in front of the wishing peasant.\n\
    \u201CHail, peasant of the night,\u201D their leader might say, an evil smile\
    \ playing about his thin lips, \u201CWhat are you about?\u201D\nThe peasant, knowing\
    \ how dangerous the Prince's henchmen are, dissembles, muttering something about\
    \ collecting night-potatoes, or some otherwise innocent deed. The captain of the\
    \ horsemen cackles, and his companions laugh too, as if they are sharing a joke.\n\
    \u201CThe Prince will be mighty pleased!\u201D says the captain, wiping spittle\
    \ from his chin with the sleeve of a rich purple tunic made of cloth so expensive\
    \ that the peasant gasps at the sight of it, \u201CYou must come with us and tell\
    \ the Prince that his realm has been blessed with potatoes in the sky!\u201D There\
    \ is a menacing pause. \u201CFor you were looking up at the firmament, were you\
    \ not, rather than down in the muck where potatoes are usually found?\u201D\n\
    The peasant knows he is in trouble now, and tries to flee, but he is captured,\
    \ taken back to Prince Fulgencio's castle, and chained up in an oubliette. Though\
    \ harsh, the Prince's orders to his henchman make sense, as he does not want his\
    \ temporal power threatened by a peasantry who owe allegiance to stars, planets,\
    \ other heavenly bodies, or indeed to any system of supernatural hocus pocus that\
    \ he cannot control.\nSuch rigour is pooh-poohed in our more enlightened age,\
    \ but not everywhere. There are still lands where the modern equivalents of Prince\
    \ Fulgencio will have a stargazer stoned to death, or chop off their head. Over\
    \ here we have taken a therapeutic route, and nowadays, if you stand in a field\
    \ at night wishing upon a star, you are likely to be picked up by Social Services\
    \ and given counselling until you achieve closure. The inference is the same,\
    \ however, that by relying upon distant twinkling lights in the sky as a guide\
    \ to your future, you are clearly a loon.\nWhen you wish upon a star, in the modern\
    \ age, it is best if you use the word star figuratively. It is quite acceptable\
    \ for you to wish upon such \u201Cstars\u201D as Kevin Costner or Mel Gibson,\
    \ Celine Dion or that Chantelle girl from Big Brother. This is seen as not only\
    \ acceptable and safe, but is positively encouraged. Indeed, I get the impression\
    \ that it is becoming compulsory.\nAnd my wish? Bring back Prince Fulgencio and\
    \ his henchmen, and set them to do their worst at Celebrity Pap! magazine.\nDETOURS\
