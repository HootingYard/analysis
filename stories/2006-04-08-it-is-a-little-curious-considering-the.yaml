  text: '"It is a little curious, considering the devotion of latter-day men of letters
    to tobacco, that in their early days so many of the men who wrote on the subject
    attacked the social use of tobacco with violence and virulence. Their titles are
    characteristic of their style. A writer named Deacon published in 1616 a quarto
    entitled ''Tobacco tortured in the filthy Fumes of Tobacco refined''; but Joshua
    Sylvester had easily surpassed this when he wrote his ''Tobacco Battered and the
    Pipes Shattered about their Eares, that idely Idolize so base and barbarous a
    Weed, or at least overlove so loathsome a Vanity, by a Volley of Holy Shot Thundered
    from Mount Helicon'', 1615. Controversialists of that period rejoiced in full-worded
    titles and in full-blooded praise or abuse." -- G L Apperson, The Social History
