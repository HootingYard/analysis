  text: "\u201CIt is a little curious, considering the devotion of latter-day men\
    \ of letters to tobacco, that in their early days so many of the men who wrote\
    \ on the subject attacked the social use of tobacco with violence and virulence.\
    \ Their titles are characteristic of their style. A writer named Deacon published\
    \ in 1616 a quarto entitled \u2018Tobacco tortured in the filthy Fumes of Tobacco\
    \ refined\u2019; but Joshua Sylvester had easily surpassed this when he wrote\
    \ his \u2018Tobacco Battered and the Pipes Shattered about their Eares, that idely\
    \ Idolize so base and barbarous a Weed, or at least overlove so loathsome a Vanity,\
    \ by a Volley of Holy Shot Thundered from Mount Helicon\u2019, 1615. Controversialists\
    \ of that period rejoiced in full-worded titles and in full-blooded praise or\
    \ abuse.\u201D \u2014 G L Apperson, The Social History Of Smoking"
