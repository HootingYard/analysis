  text: "Ever since a copy of The Third Policeman was shown, for a few seconds, in\
    \ an episode of the television series Lost, there has been a huge increase in\
    \ sales of Flann O'Brien's masterpiece. Clearly, then, the way to tackle the crisis\
    \ in literacy and to get people to read books is to extend such \u201Cproduct\
    \ placement\u201D throughout the TV schedules.\nAs an aside, it is unwise to rely\
    \ upon government action to create a literate population. The Education White\
    \ Paper that has caused such controversy had to be pulped and reprinted at a cost\
    \ of \xA323,000 because it was riddled with errors of spelling and grammar. It\
    \ could have been proof-read at a fraction of the cost, but we ought not expect\
    \ such a basic step from a gang of zombies who think and speak gobbledegook. Consider\
    \ this exchange, from Hansard on 7th November 2005:\nMr. Hollobone: To ask the\
    \ Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many (a) spelling mistakes and\
    \ (b) grammatical errors in the Education White Paper were identified by her Department\
    \ after publication.\nJacqui Smith: Since publication, we have focussed on disseminating\
    \ the policy ideas in the White Paper and planning their implementation rather\
    \ than proof-reading again. As with any document of this size, it is inevitable\
    \ that some minor errors will remain and a small number have been noted that are\
    \ not significant enough to require clarification.*\nNote to Ms Smith: errors\
    \ do not need to be \u201Cclarified\u201D. They need to be corrected. But then,\
    \ I suppose that's much less fun than \u201Cfocussing\u201D and \u201Cdisseminating\u201D\
    \ and \u201Cplanning\u201D and \u201Cimplementing\u201D.\nAnyway, where was I?\
    \ Ah yes, book placement as a variation on product placement. Here are some suggestions\
    \ for the programme-makers:\nA customer in one of those soap opera pubs, the Rover's\
    \ Return or the Queen Vic, could be shown reading a copy of Robert Burton's The\
    \ Anatomy Of Melancholy as they nurse their pint of lager.\nMedical dramas like\
    \ Casualty and Holby City provide endless opportunities for reading scenes, what\
    \ with all those bedridden patients not doing much. Shove a copy of Selected Works\
    \ Of Thomas De Quincey in their palsied hands.\nAt the end of news bulletins,\
    \ presenters like to shuffle their papers and smile at each other. Instead, they\
    \ could be shown going back to reading The Confidence Man, His Masquerade by Herman\
    \ Melville.\nGiven that most television persons are unaware of books other than\
    \ The Da Vinci Code or Bravo Two Zero, however, I can see that my scheme is doomed\
    \ to failure.\n*NOTE : Isn't that marvellous? Ms Smith manages to insert a grammatical\
    \ error into her written answer!\nDETOURS : Bobbed Haired Bandit \u2026 The Duchess\
    \ Of Malfi \u2026 Archaic Medical Terms"
