  text: '(Text of a paper given at the Fifteenth International Symposium Of Potato
    Chronometry, held in Ulm, Spring 2006)

    Helsinki or Ulm? Helsinki or Ulm? That was the question faced by our colleagues
    on the Steering Committee when wrestling with the problem of where to hold this,
    our fifteenth symposium. And I mean "wrestling", for that is how the matter was
    eventually decided. Winterbag represented the Ulmites, and Ah Fang the Helsinkiistas,
    and they fought a bout, each round of which was of course timed by a potato clock.

    In round one, Winterbag came out on top, making use of a butterfly, reverse crucifix,
    lady of the lake and octopus hold. Round two saw him further the cause of the
    Ulmites with some decisive inverted facelock camel clutches, tiger feint crucifix
    armbars, a chicken wing, beast choker, and a Tongan death grip. It looked as if
    our symposium was certainly headed for this fair German city. But in round three,
    Ah Fang rallied, with a two handed choke lift, an Argentine leglock, spinning
    toe hold, sharpshooter, clawhold, front chancery, stretch plum, pearl river plunge,
    mount, scoop and pump handle. He pushed home his advantage in round four, with
    a tilt-a-whirl and a tree of woe. Winterbag got his breath back, however, and
    in the final round won the match with a fish hook, sunset flip, Texas cloverleaf,
    gory special, Fujiwara armbar, hammerlock, sitting double chicken wing, anaconda
    vice, a wheelbarrow, and a Haas of Pain. It was all over, and the symposium was
    headed for Ulm.And here we are!

    There has never been a better time to sing the praises of potato chronometry.
    In a world threatened by bird flu, climate change, the depletion of oil reserves,
    terrorism, poverty, war, David Blunkett, and fundamentalisms of every stripe,
    we may yet have faith in the simple potato. A generation ago, in the doomed upheavals
    of 1968, the call was for "Power To The People!" Had those naive revolutionaries
    called for "Power To The Potato!" things would be very different today.

    For potatoes, as we know, have power. Which of us here in this splendidly-appointed
    conference centre in Ulm has not, at one time or another, taken two common galvanized
    nails, three alligator clip/wire units (that is, alligator clips connected to
    one another with wire), two short pieces of heavy copper wire, a simple low-voltage
    LED clock unit, and two potatoes, and obtained a simple LED clock unit that functions
    from the power of a 1- to 2-volt, button-type battery, opened the battery compartment
    to remove the battery, noted that there is a positive (+) and a negative (-) terminal
    point where the battery was installed, identified the potatoes as number one and
    number two, inserted one nail in each potato, inserted one short piece of heavy
    copper wire in each potato, placing it as far from the nail as possible, used
    one alligator clip/wire to connect the copper wire inserted in potato number one
    to the positive terminal in the clock unit, then used one alligator clip/wire
    to link the nail in potato number two to the negative terminal in the clock unit,
    used the final alligator clip/wire to link the nail in potato number one to the
    copper wire in potato number two, and finally, with no little sense of triumph,
    set the clock a-ticking? Which of us has not harnessed the power of the potato
    to control time?


    The history of potato clocks is the subject of Dobson''s magnificent pamphlet
    On The History Of Potato Clocks. Sadly, it is out of print. Those of you lucky
    enough to have read it will know that it caused a good deal of controversy among
    the experts, sharply dividing the world of potato chronometry into two hostile
    camps. Broadly speaking, there were the potato-ists, who held that the defining
    characteristic of the potato clock is its "potato-ness", vying with the clockists,
    who are wedded to the idea that the keeping of accurate time is the crux of the
    matter. Dobson himself refused to take sides, arguing with some elegance that
    both potato and clock are equally important in what it means to be a potato clock.
    This assertion itself led to a slew of letters and articles in the specialist
    press, accusing Dobson of preposterous arrogance.

    The pamphleteer, thundered one anonymous correspondent, claims that he knows what
    it is like to be a potato clock. This is arrant twaddle. A potato clock is made
    of potatoes and a few bits of wire and other things. Dobson is simply a flawed
    biped, and one whose brain is obviously not working properly.

    Where does this leave us? We stand at the dawn of a new millennium, one in which
    the potato clock will have a decisive part to play, even if we do not yet know
    with any precision what that part will be. Is our perception of time, as measured
    by potatoes, qualitatively different, better or worse than other methods of keeping
    time, more or less attuned to nature, to the cycle of the seasons, to the sun
    and the moon and the stars, to the tides of the sea and the life cycle of beings
    both tiny and huge? We need to answer these questions with some urgency, and that
    is why I propose that we storm the gates of all those remote and secretive buildings
    where so-called atomic clocks with their pinpoint accuracy are ticktocking away,
    and we wrench them from their fixtures and stamp them to bits under our big boots,
    and we replace them all with potato clocks. I, for one, foresee our triumph.

    Thank you. My next lecture will take place in the pie shop annexe where I will
    be addressing the exciting topic Measuring Distance By Laying Celery Sticks End
    To End.'
