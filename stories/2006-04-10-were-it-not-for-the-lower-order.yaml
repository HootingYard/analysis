  text: '"Were it not for the lower order of spirit brains, there would be comparatively
    few drunkards, gamblers, adulterers, fornicators, murderers, and suicides. It
    is they who excite man''s animal senses, by conjuring up alluring pictures of
    drink, and gold, and sexual happiness. By the aid of the higher type of spirit
    brains I have been enabled to perceive the atmosphere surrounding drinking-dens
    and brothels full of all kinds of bestial influences, from elementals, who allure
    men by presenting to their minds all kinds of attractive tableaux, to the earth-bound
    spirits of drunkards and libertines, transformed into horrors of the sub-human,
    sub-animal order of phantasms--things with bloated, nude bodies and pigs'' faces,
    shaggy bears with fulsome, watery eyes; mangy dogs, etc." -- Elliott O''Donnell,
    Byways Of Ghost-Land'
