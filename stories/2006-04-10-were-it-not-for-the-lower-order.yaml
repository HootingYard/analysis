  text: "\u201CWere it not for the lower order of spirit brains, there would be comparatively\
    \ few drunkards, gamblers, adulterers, fornicators, murderers, and suicides. It\
    \ is they who excite man's animal senses, by conjuring up alluring pictures of\
    \ drink, and gold, and sexual happiness. By the aid of the higher type of spirit\
    \ brains I have been enabled to perceive the atmosphere surrounding drinking-dens\
    \ and brothels full of all kinds of bestial influences, from elementals, who allure\
    \ men by presenting to their minds all kinds of attractive tableaux, to the earth-bound\
    \ spirits of drunkards and libertines, transformed into horrors of the sub-human,\
    \ sub-animal order of phantasms\u2014things with bloated, nude bodies and pigs'\
    \ faces, shaggy bears with fulsome, watery eyes; mangy dogs, etc.\u201D \u2014\
