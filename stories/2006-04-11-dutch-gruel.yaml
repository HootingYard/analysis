  text: "There has always been a pedagogical impulse throbbing at the heart of Hooting\
    \ Yard, so I am delighted to report that our recipe for gruel is now being used\
    \ as a set text. Students are directed to this \u201Crather elaborate recipe\u201D\
    \ by the editors of Alquin, a site for students learning English as a foreign\
    \ language. The assignment is as follows:\n\u201CSearch the Internet for recipes\
    \ for two of the following Victorian foodstuffs and translate the recipes into\
    \ Dutch, in a way that you, or someone else, would easily be able to prepare the\
    \ food. By presenting some Victorian food dishes, the actors who're in the play\
    \ [an adaptation of Oliver Twist] might be even more motivated to act Victorian.\
    \ Of course you could also feed them gruel, but that might not go down that well\u2026\
    \u201D\nThere follows a list of enticing grub including dumplings, black-cap pudding,\
    \ \u2018good common cake\u2019, pickled mussels, and potted meat sandwiches. Links\
    \ for each dish are provided for the students, ending with one to Hooting Yard,\
    \ suggesting that they \u201Ctry to work out from this description what you need\
    \ to do to make gruel\u201D.\nMay I implore all readers, next time they find themselves\
    \ eating out in the Netherlands, to order a bowl of gruel?\n"
