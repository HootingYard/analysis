  text: "\u201CI cannot see how a Christian, who has had a taste of 'angel's food',\
    \ can relish the miserable trash contained in novels. The tendency of novel reading\
    \ is most pernicious. It enervates the mental powers, and unfits them for close\
    \ study and serious contemplation. It dissipates the mind, and creates a diseased\
    \ imagination. It promotes a sickly sensibility, and renders its votaries unfit\
    \ for the pursuits of real life. It is a great waste of time, and on this account\
    \ alone may be regarded as sinful.\u201D \u2014 Harvey Newcomb, A Practical Directory\
    \ For Young Christian Females"
