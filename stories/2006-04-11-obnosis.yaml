  text: 'Here is an extract from a Scientology Handbook:

    There is a word "obnosis" which has been put together from the phrase, "observing
    the obvious." The art of observing the obvious is strenuously neglected in our
    society at this time. Pity. It''s the only way you ever see anything; you observe
    the obvious. You look at the isness of something, at what is actually there. Fortunately
    for us, the ability to obnose is not in any sense "inborn" or mystical. But it
    is being taught that way by people outside of Scientology. How do you teach somebody
    to see what is there? Well, you put up something for him to look at, and have
    him tell you what he sees. An individual can practice this on his own or in a
    group situation, such as a class.

    And here is an extract from Janet Reitman''s Rolling Stone article "Inside Scientology":

    [Scientologists] assert that 75 million years ago, an evil galactic warlord named
    Xenu controlled seventy-six planets in this corner of the galaxy, each of which
    was severely overpopulated. To solve this problem, Xenu rounded up 13.5 trillion
    beings and then flew them to Earth, where they were dumped into volcanoes around
    the globe and vaporized with bombs. This scattered their radioactive souls, or
    thetans, until they were caught in electronic traps set up around the atmosphere
    and "implanted" with a number of false ideas -- including the concepts of God,
    Christ and organized religion. Scientologists later learn that many of these entities
    attached themselves to human beings, where they remain to this day, creating not
    just the root of all of our emotional and physical problems but the root of all
    problems of the modern world.

    Oh, and one more extract from Reitman:

    Unique among religious faiths, Scientology charges for virtually all of its religious
    services.

    I think it can be a useful exercise to obnose those three paragraphs, and draw
    the obnostic conclusion.'
