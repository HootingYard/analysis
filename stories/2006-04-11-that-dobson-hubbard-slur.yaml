  text: "Speaking of Scientology, I read somewhere recently an article claiming that\
    \ Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, had pretensions to being some sort of\
    \ L Ron Hubbard figure, or \u201CEnron\u201D Hubbard, as some wags have taken\
    \ to calling the old rogue. This is a terrible slur on Dobson who, if not exactly\
    \ saintly, was by no means a money-grubbing charlatan. It is true that he wrote\
    \ a \u201Cguide to life\u201D entitled Dobsonetics, and devised a \u201Cpersonality\
    \ test\u201D with which he would attempt to entice passers-by on street corners,\
    \ but there the similarities end. Much as he might have wanted to, Dobson was\
    \ never able to buy a small fleet of ships and spend years sailing the oceans\
    \ with a private navy (the \u201CSea Organisation\u201D) as a tax-avoidance scheme.\n\
    The Dobsonetics personality test survives only in fragmentary form, for the simple\
    \ reason that most of those invited to take it judged it a piece of blithering\
    \ inanity and tore it to shreds. To his credit, the pamphleteer did not condemn\
    \ such folk as apostates who should be abominated, threatened, and shunned. Instead,\
    \ he looked on sadly as the torn-up scraps of yet another uncompleted test fell\
    \ to the ground, only to be picked up by the howling winds and carried off, fluttering\
    \ away in the air. He would watch until they disappeared, and then trudge home,\
    \ fix himself a cup of piping hot tea, and sit at his escritoire to devise more\
    \ questions.\nIt is worth pointing out that, as with so much else Dobsonian, the\
    \ personality test was a fleeting fad, and he soon moved on to pastures new. Years\
    \ later he penned a pamphlet entitled A Recantation Of Dobsonetics, which has\
    \ the dubious distinction of having sold precisely nil copies.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that there were two hundred questions in the original Dobsonetics personality\
    \ test. Of these, only seven have survived. As an act of historical curiosity,\
    \ you may wish to answer them.\n1. Complete the following sequence: thumping headache\
    \ \u2026 spinach \u2026 creosote \u2026 viper \u2026 Helen Shapiro \u2026\n2.\
    \ Do you prefer a flip-top lid to a twist-off cap?\n3. Have you ever been mistaken\
    \ for Stalin?\n4. Do you tremble in the presence of coat hangers?\n5. \u201CMen\
    \ are from Uttoxeter, women are from Didcot.\u201D True or false?\n6. The best\
    \ thing to do with a plastic basin full of bird feathers is\u2026.. what?\n7.\
