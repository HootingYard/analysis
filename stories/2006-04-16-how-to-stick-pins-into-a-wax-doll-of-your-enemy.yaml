  text: 'Here is a simple and cost-effective way to cause harm to your enemy. All
    you will need is some wax, a few pins, and a hank of your enemy''s hair or a scrap
    from clothing they have worn or some other item imbued with their spirit or Geist.

    You may protest, as so many people do, that you have not an enemy in the world,
    that your sunny disposition and acts of alms-giving mean that no one wishes you
    ill. Much as I would like this to be true, it is extremely unlikely. At one time
    or another, all of us have made enemies. Perhaps there was a time when you struck
    clunk rather than clang during bell-ringing, and so offended the ears of your
    captain that he has hated you ever since with a loathing that grows by the day.
    Or you may have inadvertently bashed into and maimed a goat while cycling at high
    speed--remember that collision?--and there is a farmer who spends his lonely nights
    cursing you to hell. You could even have made an enemy by stealing a bonbon from
    the mouth of a tiny tot, a mischievous deed that you have since forgotten but
    has led that infant, now a grown adult, to harbour a burning indignation which
    has quite distorted her life. So do not think you have no foes, and do not think
    yourself innocent and safe. There are people bent on revenge, and they will stop
    at nothing, and the best way to protect yourself is to cause them harm before
    they steal upon you at dead of night and smother you with your own pillow.

    Obtaining your wax and pins couldn''t be easier. You can get wax from a wax chandler,
    or you can just melt a few candles until they are soft enough to mould. You do
    not need a great deal of wax, as your doll will only be a tiny thing, like a little
    incubus. Ideally you should be able to hold it in one hand while, cackling and
    slobbering, you drive the pins home with the fingers of your other hand. But we
    are getting ahead of ourselves.

    I will assume you have the wax, and a means of heating it. Bunsen burners, as
    found in the laboratories of boffins both mad and otherwise, are useful for this
    part of the project, or you may prefer to use your gas cooker at home. Do remember
    to pay your bill, though, for if you neglect it your gas provider may cut off
    your supply, and you will be left with wax too hard to mould into a doll. When
    you have malleable wax, fashion it with your fingers and thumbs into a basic simulacram
    of a human being. It need not be an accurate representation of your enemy, unless
    they have a particularly noticeable physical flaw, such as a missing limb or a
    giant swollen head. In most cases, a standard humanoid shape will do.

    Some correspondents have asked me if the little doll which you will pierce with
    sharp pins to harm your foe can be made out of plasticine, or some other proprietary
    modelling clay suitable for infants and for those embarking on a course of physical
    therapy in an institution for the bewildered. The straightforward answer is "No,
    No, a thousand times No!" You must always, always use wax, for there is something
    weird and even sinister about wax.

    Now, about those pins. You can get pins from any old haberdasher or needlework
    shop, from anywhere in fact which sells pins for innocent domestic purposes. So
    long as the pins are of metal, you can''t really go wrong. But if you have a flair
    for wickedness, you might want to use special Zoltan(tm) pins. These are manufactured
    especially for plunging remorselessly into waxen images for nefarious purposes,
    and the makers promise faster and more decisive results. Independent studies have
    not been able to uphold such claims, alas, and it may be that the Zoltan(tm) pins
    people are guilty of hyperbole and guff. I leave the choice to you.

    One parenthetical note. You must use pins and not nails. If you try to press nails
    into your wax doll, you are making a category error. Nails exist to be driven
    into mud idols for quite other purposes. There was a time when children learned
    the useful phrase "Pins for wax, nails for mud" as soon as they could speak, but
    that seems to be one of those pieces of traditional wisdom we have lost in our
    pap-engulfed world. It ought to be revived, starting now.

    So, you have your doll and you have your pins. Most important of all, you have
    your enemy, whether it be the village wrestler who once scolded you as you frolicked
    in the graveyard, or the pilot of a jet aircraft whose uniform cap you tipped
    off his head and kicked along the street as he made his way home after flying
    his spy plane deep into enemy airspace. Now you have to imbue that little wax
    doll with the spirit of your foe. You will not be bringing the doll to life exactly,
    like some sort of waxen Pinocchio, but it needs to lose its anonymity and be clearly
    identified with your enemy. You can do this by attaching to it that hank of hair
    or scrap of clothing I mentioned earlier, or some other unique item. I shall leave
    it to your finely-honed wits to work out how to obtain such a thing. Unless you
    are the village barber or dry cleaner, you may need to employ a private detective
    or, as a cheaper option, hire the services of a ne''er-do-well hobbledehoy.

    Having somehow instilled your doll with the Geist of your foe, you are now at
    last ready to pierce it with pins. Go on, stick them in! Your face ought to take
    on an expression of evil concentration, and you may even cackle, but you do not
    need to have a bubbling cauldron of some foul eldritch potion at your side. That
    is mere whimsy.

    Opinions differ as to how you may judge the efficacy of the operation. Some hold
    that success consists in gaining immediate results, so that at the very instant
    you stick a pin into your doll''s leg, your enemy feels a sharp pang in the same
    spot. Others contend that a pin so placed will lead to your foe breaking their
    leg in the near future. There is no foolproof way of influencing the precise kind
    of harm your enemy will come to. You need to trust to the invisible powers of
    the cosmos, in much the same way as loveable disc jockey and television personality
    Noel Edmonds does, through his adherence to the Cosmic Ordering Service.
