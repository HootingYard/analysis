  text: "\u201CTo make Stars that will expand in Flame, and appear like natural Stars\
    \ in the Firmament for a time: Take half a Pound of Salt-peter, the like quantity\
    \ of Brimstone, finely beaten together, sifted and mingled with a quarter of a\
    \ Pound of Gunpowder so ordered: Then wrap up the Composition in Linnen Rags or\
    \ fine Paper, to the quantity of a Walnut, bind them with small Thread, and prick\
    \ holes in the Rag or Paper with a Bodkin, and place six or ten of them on the\
    \ Head of a great Rocket, as you did the Quills, and when the Rocket expires,\
    \ they take fire and spread into a Flame, hovering in the Air like Stars, and\
    \ descend leisurely till the matter is spent that gives them light.\u201D \u2014\
