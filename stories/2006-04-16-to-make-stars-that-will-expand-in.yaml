  text: '"To make Stars that will expand in Flame, and appear like natural Stars in
    the Firmament for a time: Take half a Pound of Salt-peter, the like quantity of
    Brimstone, finely beaten together, sifted and mingled with a quarter of a Pound
    of Gunpowder so ordered: Then wrap up the Composition in Linnen Rags or fine Paper,
    to the quantity of a Walnut, bind them with small Thread, and prick holes in the
    Rag or Paper with a Bodkin, and place six or ten of them on the Head of a great
    Rocket, as you did the Quills, and when the Rocket expires, they take fire and
    spread into a Flame, hovering in the Air like Stars, and descend leisurely till
    the matter is spent that gives them light." -- Robert Howlett, The School Of Recreation'
