  text: "Today's quotation, which you will have read attentively, is from Frederick\
    \ Arthur Ambrose Talbot's 1917 memoir Sixteen Months In Four German Prisons. Dobson\
    \ was a great admirer of this book and planned to write a sequel entitled Four\
    \ Months In Sixteen German Prisons. To this end, he arrived in \xDClm on a bright\
    \ spring morning and began to write an inflammatory pamphlet, hoping to be placed\
    \ under arrest. His plan succeeded brilliantly, and by midday he had been banged\
    \ up in the jug. He lay back on the cold stone bench in his cell and smiled. Then,\
    \ before a guard arrived with a tin bowl of evil-looking and worse-smelling soup,\
    \ the pamphleteer took from a secret compartment in his shoe a notepad and pencil\
    \ and wrote: Day one. In prison in \xDClm. One down, fifteen prisons to go. Soup\
    \ due soon.\nAt the time of which I write, Dobson was young and impetuous, and\
    \ he had not bothered to research the German penal system, particularly that part\
    \ of it related to the transfer of convicts between prisons. He was later to reflect\
    \ ruefully on his na\xEFvety. I thought I would be able to get myself moved from\
    \ prison to prison just by asking nicely, he wrote, but I reckoned without the\
    \ inhuman, mechanically creaking wheels of Teutonic jurisprudence.\nIt must be\
    \ said that this is a somewhat melodramatic evasion. What actually happened was\
    \ that, hauled before a court within two hours of his incarceration, Dobson was\
    \ condemned as an \u201Cidiotic nuisance\u201D and ejected from the country. He\
    \ was placed on a prison ship which sailed him home in time for tea.\n\nA ship\
    \ a bit like the one that sailed Dobson home from prison"
