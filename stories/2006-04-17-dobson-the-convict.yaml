  text: 'Today''s quotation, which you will have read attentively, is from Frederick
    Arthur Ambrose Talbot''s 1917 memoir Sixteen Months In Four German Prisons. Dobson
    was a great admirer of this book and planned to write a sequel entitled Four Months
    In Sixteen German Prisons. To this end, he arrived in Ulm on a bright spring morning
    and began to write an inflammatory pamphlet, hoping to be placed under arrest.
    His plan succeeded brilliantly, and by midday he had been banged up in the jug.
    He lay back on the cold stone bench in his cell and smiled. Then, before a guard
    arrived with a tin bowl of evil-looking and worse-smelling soup, the pamphleteer
    took from a secret compartment in his shoe a notepad and pencil and wrote: Day
    one. In prison in Ulm. One down, fifteen prisons to go. Soup due soon.

    At the time of which I write, Dobson was young and impetuous, and he had not bothered
    to research the German penal system, particularly that part of it related to the
    transfer of convicts between prisons. He was later to reflect ruefully on his
    naivety. I thought I would be able to get myself moved from prison to prison just
    by asking nicely, he wrote, but I reckoned without the inhuman, mechanically creaking
    wheels of Teutonic jurisprudence.

    It must be said that this is a somewhat melodramatic evasion. What actually happened
    was that, hauled before a court within two hours of his incarceration, Dobson
    was condemned as an "idiotic nuisance" and ejected from the country. He was placed
    on a prison ship which sailed him home in time for tea.


    A ship a bit like the one that sailed Dobson home from prison'
