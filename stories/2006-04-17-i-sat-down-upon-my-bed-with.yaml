  text: "\u201CI sat down upon my bed with my bleeding, aching head in my hands, an\
    \ object of abject misery. Not a sound beyond the clanging of doors was to be\
    \ heard, punctuated at frequent intervals by the dull thud of blows, as some hapless\
    \ wretch was being clubbed, the shrieks and howls of prisoners, and the groans\
    \ of those on the verge of insanity. It was just as if all the demons of the Nether\
    \ Regions were at work worrying and harrying their victims. While rocking myself\
    \ to and fro I heard the turning of the key. The gaoler entered with a bowl containing\
    \ some evil-looking and worse smelling soup.\u201D \u2014 Frederick Arthur Ambrose\
    \ Talbot, Sixteen Months In Four German Prisons"
