  text: '"My lung has just collapsed" is not a statement you are likely to hear spoken,
    for the simple reason that when someone''s lung has collapsed, they will not be
    able to do much more than gasp for breath. Think of the lung like an airbag which,
    when punctured, shrivels up with a wheezy noise. This is pretty much common sense
    and does not require extensive medical knowledge.

    Now, imagine for a moment that you do have extensive medical knowledge, that you
    are, for present purposes, a senior medico in an important hospital. You are sitting
    at your big desk in your big office, leafing through a sheaf of complicated diagrams
    which would mean nothing to a lay person. Years of training, and an acute and
    piercing mind, allow you to interpret the mass of medical information contained
    in these colourful charts and to reach swift, startling, and expert conclusions.
    You are about to press a blue knob on the desk console which pipes your instructions
    to less expert doctors elsewhere in the hospital, when you are interrupted.

    A man enters your office unannounced. He is blubbery and shaggy-haired and his
    clothing is creased and crumpled and he has a woebegone yet desperate air and
    his face is the colour of tallow and he smells of disinfectant and he says "Doctor,
    doctor, my lung has just collapsed".

    You look up at him, into his watery eyes, and you press the green knob on your
    console instead of the blue one, and as soon as you hear the gentle hum that indicates
    you are connected to the system, you say "Please come and get my brother and take
    him home". There is no exasperation in your voice, just inhuman patience and a
    trace, perhaps, of a love that is fathomless and bold. For you are Doctor Tint,
    and your visitor is Rex Tint. He is known to the world as a supremely talented
    mezzotintist. To you, he is a hypochondriac, constantly assailed by phantom maladies
    and imagined injuries.

    He is taken home by paramedics and tucked into bed on the mezzanine floor of his
    mezzotint-strewn flat, where he falls asleep. When he awakes, there is a chance
    that he may set to work on his latest mezzotint. Equally, he may be convinced
    that he is subject to black bile and the flux and hare at high speed back to the
    hospital, or to a clinic, or to a soothsayer.

    Rex Tint has much in common with the current Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, who
    likes to drink Lemsip while he works, because it makes him imagine that he is
    slightly ill. "I read in a biography of A E Housman that he wrote most of A Shropshire
    Lad while he had a cold," he told the BBC, "And I thought, yes, I know about that--that
    sort of slightly introverted self-pitying mood that a mild illness can give. It
    is absolutely conducive to poems."

    Rex Tint, however, felt that when mezzotinting, he needed something more than
    a "mild illness". He needed to be in trauma, close to death, face to face with
    extinction. Whether this genuinely improved the quality of his work is hard to
    say, for so matchless a mezzotintist was he that an open-mouthed gape of awe was--and
    remains--the only fitting reaction.

    Somewhere between Andrew Motion''s "self-pitying mood" and the mezzotintist Rex
    Tint''s counterfeit death agony comes Dobson''s approach to creativity. He had
    read about the Vatican''s practice of ensuring that the Pope is dead by hitting
    him on the head three times with a special ceremonial hammer while shouting his
    name in his ear. If the pontiff fails to respond, he is pronounced dead, and cardinals
    are summoned from around the world to choose a successor. Dobson was fascinated
    by this, and whenever he felt a pamphlet coming on, he asked Marigold Chew to
    beat him thrice on the head with a hammer and shout "Dobson! Dobson! Dobson!".
    Nursing a throbbing skull, he would sit down at his escritoire and set to work.

    I have not yet decided which of these three methods would suit me best, so I have
    decided to nurture a slight head cold, feign a collapsed lung, and get bashed
    on the head with a hammer all at the same time, with a dose of bird flu thrown
    in for good measure. As the reader, you will be able to judge the success or otherwise
    of this courageous plan.'
