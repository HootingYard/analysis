  text: "Dear Frank, writes Pansy Cradledew, I always enjoy reading about Rex Tint,\
    \ the mezzotintist, but I must confess that I am not entirely sure what a mezzotint\
    \ is. I am sure I cannot be the only reader to confess such ignorance, and I would\
    \ be very grateful for any light you can shed on the matter. Yours curiously,\
    \ Pansy Cradledew. PS : What on earth has become of Little Severin, the Mystic\
    \ Badger?\nI hope Pansy will forgive me if I simply reprint what the wikipedia\
    \ has to tell us. I do this for two reasons\u2014one, sheer idleness and two,\
    \ because it is quite fascinating in itself and I can hardly be expected to improve\
    \ upon it.\nMezzotint is a printing process of the intaglio family, in which the\
    \ surface of a metal plate is roughened evenly; the image is then brought out\
    \ by smoothing the surface, creating the image by working from dark to light.\n\
    Plates can be mechanically roughened, but the classical way is to rub fine metal\
    \ filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller\
    \ the grain of the surface. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel\
    \ rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per\
    \ inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle\
    \ projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct\
    \ angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the\
    \ copper. The plate is then moved\u2014either rotated by a set number of degrees\
    \ or through 90 degrees according to preference\u2014and then rocked in another\
    \ pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a\
    \ completely solid tone.\nCarol Wax's book The Mezzotint: History and Technique\
    \ (Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990) is the best available text on the subject, covering\
    \ history, development, methods and materials for the whole process. Mezzotint\
    \ is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely\
    \ roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colours to be printed;\
    \ secondly because the process of smoothing the texture with burin, burnisher\
    \ and scraper allows fine gradations in tone to be developed.\nThe mezzotint printing\
    \ method was invented by Ludwig von Siegen (1609-1680). His earliest surviving\
    \ mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of Amelia Elizabeth, Landgravine\
    \ of Hesse-Cassel. The word mezzotint is derived from the Italian mezzo-tinto,\
    \ meaning half-painted.\nThere we are, now you know as much about mezzotints as\
    \ I do. You may wish to follow the detour below, which leads to M R James' spooky\
    \ story The Mezzotint. As for Little Severin the Mystic Badger, expect an important\
    \ announcement very soon.\nDETOURS : The Mezzotint \u2026 Bird Sounds \u2026 The\
