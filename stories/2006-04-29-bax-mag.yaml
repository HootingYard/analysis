  text: 'Hooting Yard continues its mission to raise the tone of the monthly magazine
    market. From next week, hoping to oust all that drivel like Beer & Blokes and
    Handbags For Fluffyheads from your newsagent''s shelves, we will be launching
    an exciting new title devoted entirely to the composer Sir Arnold Bax (1883-1953).
    Issue one has an exciting article about Sir William Walton''s attempt to "knock
    Bax off the map" with his own first symphony, including a special mezzotint reproduction
    of the map itself from noted mezzotintist Rex Tint. Plus there is a chance to
    read some of Bax''s pseudonymous ''Dermot O''Byrne'' poems, a botanical description
    of The Garden Of Fand, and some swan recipes from Bax''s successor as Master of
    the Queen''s Music, that scamp Sir Peter Maxwell Davies.
