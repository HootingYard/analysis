  text: '"Bladud was the only child of the king and queen, and he was not only tenderly
    beloved by his parents, but was also considered as a child of great beauty and
    promise by the chiefs and the people. It, however, unfortunately happened that
    he was attacked with that loathsome disease, so frequently mentioned in Scripture
    by the name of leprosy. The dirty habits and gross feeding of the early natives
    of Britain, as well as of all other uncivilized people, rendered this malady common;
    but at the time in which Prince Bladud lived, no cure for it was known to the
    Britons. Being highly infectious, therefore, all persons afflicted with it were
    not only held in disgust and abhorrence, but, by the barbarous laws of the times,
    were doomed to be driven from the abodes of their fellow-creatures, and to take
    their chance of life or death in the forests and the deserts, exposed alike to
    hunger and to beasts of prey." -- Robert W Shoppell, The Afflicted Prince'
