  text: "\u201CBladud was the only child of the king and queen, and he was not only\
    \ tenderly beloved by his parents, but was also considered as a child of great\
    \ beauty and promise by the chiefs and the people. It, however, unfortunately\
    \ happened that he was attacked with that loathsome disease, so frequently mentioned\
    \ in Scripture by the name of leprosy. The dirty habits and gross feeding of the\
    \ early natives of Britain, as well as of all other uncivilized people, rendered\
    \ this malady common; but at the time in which Prince Bladud lived, no cure for\
    \ it was known to the Britons. Being highly infectious, therefore, all persons\
    \ afflicted with it were not only held in disgust and abhorrence, but, by the\
    \ barbarous laws of the times, were doomed to be driven from the abodes of their\
    \ fellow-creatures, and to take their chance of life or death in the forests and\
    \ the deserts, exposed alike to hunger and to beasts of prey.\u201D \u2014 Robert\
    \ W Shoppell, The Afflicted Prince"
