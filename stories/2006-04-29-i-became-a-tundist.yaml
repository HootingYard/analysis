  text: "Earlier in the year we published The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet, a story in\
    \ twenty-six daily(ish) episodes. This seemed to be popular with readers, harking\
    \ back to the days when fiction was routinely published in serial form, so today\
    \ we begin a second serialisation with the first episode of Testimony Of A Tundist.\
    \ This tale first appeared in pamphlet form in 1993, is long out of print (of\
    \ course), and copies are so rare that even the author doesn't have one.\nI became\
    \ a Tundist at the age of twenty-six. I have never regretted it. Oh, my life has\
    \ not been easy. I have been racked by doubts, spat upon, consumed by misery,\
    \ poked at with sticks, ridiculed, accused of numberless crimes, and pelted with\
    \ pebbles. Yet through years of torment, Tundism has sustained me. It has been\
    \ a solace and a joy, comforted me, emboldened me, kept me whole. I wear with\
    \ pride the Tundist's Vest.\nWhat makes one embrace Tundism? There is no simple\
    \ answer to the question. In my forties, for quite unrelated reasons, I was confined\
    \ to a dank and grim oubliette for a period of six years, during which time, with\
    \ little else to do but bite my fingernails and bash rodents with my spoon, I\
    \ analysed the forces which had impelled me, with ever increasing certainty, towards\
    \ that unforgettable day when, smoke billowing from the funnels, I donned the\
    \ Vest, and choirs sang.\nMy childhood was a happy one, marred only by insect\
    \ swarms and my father's occasional outbreaks of pumice mania, when he would charge\
    \ wildly around the house hurling pumice stones at invisible foes. We were a close-knit\
    \ family. I was the youngest of eight children. My sisters were strange, flushed,\
    \ lovelorn, towering, bloodthirsty and prim (in that order). My brother I hardly\
    \ remember; he was much older than me, and joined the post office when I was four,\
    \ and we saw little of him thereafter, though he kept in touch through letters,\
    \ often twice daily, recounting his adventures. It is a pity that his handwriting\
    \ was illegible.\nWe grew up in a ramshackle cottage on farmland. If my parents\
    \ had any connection with the farm, they never told me about it. My mother was\
    \ something in the world of amateur entomology. She regularly received envelopes\
    \ full of flies in the post, and would spend her afternoons pinning each fly to\
    \ a gigantic baize noticeboard in the pantry. Once or twice a year she would go\
    \ off to distant towns to attend entomological gatherings; sometimes one or two\
    \ of the children would be allowed to accompany her. I have a vivid memory of\
    \ sitting on a stool at the back of a cold and cavernous hall, somewhere on the\
    \ outskirts of Blot, while Mama stood behind a lectern at the front, addressing\
    \ a few dozen enthusiasts. I had no idea what she was talking about.\nOf my father,\
    \ there is little I can say which is not already in the public record. He lived\
    \ an obscure and blameless life until the terrible day when, celebrating his sixtieth\
    \ birthday, he was arrested under the provisions of the Suspicious Foreign Maps\
    \ Act. Once the press got wind of it, he didn't have a chance.\nBy then, of course,\
    \ I had already become a Tundist. I must go back ten years or more. I had left\
    \ home at fifteen, with my parents' blessings, and joined a troupe of hot-air-ballooning\
    \ minstrels. I remember those years with unalloyed pleasure. Our balloon would\
    \ touch down in some field, we hardly cared where, and we would clamber out of\
    \ the basket, clutching our lutes, crumhorns, sackbuts and shawms, and skip frolicsome\
    \ into the nearest village, where we would commandeer a square, or green, or bandstand,\
    \ and perform our spritely songs in return for money, victuals, ale, trinkets,\
    \ and whatever else a delighted populace could bestow upon us.\nIt was a glorious\
    \ life for a youngster, and I was devastated when, at nineteen, I was forced to\
    \ leave the troupe through injury. One teeming day in August 19--, I fell from\
    \ the balloon-basket and broke my back. I have been in a wheelchair ever since.\
    \ I spent the best part of a year in hospital, slowly coming to terms with my\
    \ new situation. I frittered the time away, driving the other patients crackers\
    \ with my sackbut, until it was confiscated by a gruesome janitor. Never much\
    \ of a reader in those days, I made little use of the hospital library. I invented\
    \ card games, and taught them to my fellow invalids. I developed a taste for reckless\
    \ gambling, using counters, until I had impoverished myself and any future children,\
    \ grandchildren, and great grandchildren I may ever dandle upon my knee. I learned\
    \ to paint facetious watercolours. My prim and towering sisters visited me. My\
    \ mother sent me a fly.\nDischarged a week after my twentieth birthday, I returned\
    \ briefly to the family cottage, but grew rapidly disgruntled, and struck off\
    \ alone, renting a hut in the grounds of a fireworks factory in Frump Harbour,\
    \ where, through the offices of one of my old ballooning pals, I had been offered\
    \ a job entertaining the workers during their lunch breaks by strumming upon a\
    \ banjo and howling. Life was squalid but bearable. My hut was often overrun with\
    \ weasels, squirrels and shrews. I had no running water, and the only heating\
    \ was a formidable and rather alarming oil-burner which had been abandoned\u2014\
    judiciously, I thought\u2014by a previous occupant of the hut. Each morning I\
    \ was woken by a gang of corncrakes, their raucous cries skirling across the factory\
    \ pond. I was not exactly happy, but I was content. Then, one dismal morning in\
    \ November, still in my pyjamas, I met a Tundist.\nTo be continued\u2026\nDETOURS\
