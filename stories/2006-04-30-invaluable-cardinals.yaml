  text: "Our Antipodean researcher Glyn Webster discovered what he calls \u201Can\
    \ invaluable checklist for the Hooting Yard birdwatcher\u201D on the wikipedia.\
    \ This list of large cardinals may of course refer to Roman Catholic \xFCberpriests\
    \ rather than to birds. The wikipedia page allows one to follow links to find\
    \ out more about the cardinals it lists, which somehow is not as satisfying as\
    \ a plain recitation, shorn of any detail.\nAlmost Ramsey cardinal, Erdos cardinal,\
    \ Extendible cardinal, Huge cardinal, Hyper-Woodin cardinal, Inaccessible cardinal,\
    \ Ineffable cardinal, J\xF3nsson cardinal, Mahlo cardinal, Measurable cardinal,\
    \ Ramsey cardinal, Reinhardt cardinal, Remarkable cardinal, Rowbottom cardinal,\
    \ Shelah cardinal, Strong cardinal, Strongly compact cardinal, Subcompact cardinal,\
    \ Subtle cardinal, Supercompact cardinal, Superstrong cardinal, Totally indescribable\
    \ cardinal, Unfoldable cardinal, Weakly compact cardinal, Weakly hyper-Woodin\
    \ cardinal, Woodin cardinal.\nIn an ideal world, \u201CWoodin\u201D above would\
    \ be a misprint for \u201CWooden\u201D, but alas, I know it is not so.\n\nAn ineffable\
    \ cardinal (right) and the vestments of an unfoldable cardinal (left)\nWhen I\
    \ was a child, I remember once being taken to a cathedral to hear Mass said by\
    \ a totally indescribable cardinal. I could witter on for ages about the cathedral\
    \ and its environs, the altar servers and sacristans and the softly swaying thuribles,\
    \ the taxidermist's crocodile hung in chains from the ceiling*, the choir and\
    \ the candles, the stained glass and the eucharist and the benediction, but try\
    \ as I might I will never be able to describe the totally indescribable cardinal,\
    \ because he was, and I am sure remains to this day, totally indescribable.\n\
