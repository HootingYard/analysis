  text: "\u201C[Mr Jones] wrote that he had never seen wild hazels with worms in them\
    \ and would like to learn more about them. I sent him both good and wormy nuts\
    \ from the wild hazel bush to which I had referred. He was so impressed by them\
    \ that he wished me to dig up the plant and ship it to him, writing that he wished\
    \ to cross it with filbert pollen as an experiment. I sent it as he asked but\
    \ before he was able to make the cross he intended, his death occurred. Several\
    \ years later, his daughter Mildred wrote to me about this hazel bush, asking\
    \ if I knew where her father had planted it.\u201D \u2014 Carl Weschcke, Growing\
