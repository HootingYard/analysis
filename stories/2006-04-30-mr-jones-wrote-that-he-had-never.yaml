  text: '"[Mr Jones] wrote that he had never seen wild hazels with worms in them and
    would like to learn more about them. I sent him both good and wormy nuts from
    the wild hazel bush to which I had referred. He was so impressed by them that
    he wished me to dig up the plant and ship it to him, writing that he wished to
    cross it with filbert pollen as an experiment. I sent it as he asked but before
    he was able to make the cross he intended, his death occurred. Several years later,
    his daughter Mildred wrote to me about this hazel bush, asking if I knew where
    her father had planted it." -- Carl Weschcke, Growing Nuts In the North'
