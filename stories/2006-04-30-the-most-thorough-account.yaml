  text: "Episode two of the serial story Testimony Of A Tundist\nThe most thorough\
    \ account of Tundism in the English language is probably Binder's magnificent\
    \ survey Wrought-Iron Rigour : The World Of The Tundists (Chumpot & Throwback,\
    \ 19--). A flavour of this astonishing book is perhaps best given by reproducing\
    \ the table of contents, thus:\n\nThe above gives some indication not only of\
    \ the breadth of Binder's research but also, to some extent, his piercing intensity.\
    \ The truly surprising thing is that Binder himself was not a Tundist. It seems\
    \ to me that the acuity of his insight would put to shame many of those who wear\
    \ the Vest\u2014myself included.Space prevents me from reprinting whole swathes\
    \ of Binder's work, which is unmatched elsewhere in the literature devoted to\
    \ Tundism. Sadly, in the Anti-Tundist crackdown of the last decade, Binder's book\
    \ has become almost impossible to obtain. I urge readers to scan carefully the\
    \ shelves of secondhand bookdealers, especially those in and around O'Houlihan's\
    \ Wharf, if they are to root out a copy.\nLet me take you back to that soggy November\
    \ morning. As I say, I was still in my pyjamas. I had had a night of frightful\
    \ dreams and, on waking, cursing the corncrakes, I could not bring myself, as\
    \ I usually did, to set about retuning my banjo ready for the lunchtime wassail.\
    \ Instead, plumping into my wheelchair, I decided to take a turn around the pond\
    \ and to hurl used batteries at my feathered tormentors. Five minutes into this\
    \ sport, I was accosted by a fellow I had never seen before. He came hurtling\
    \ towards me from the direction of the corrugated cardboard stacks, grabbed what\
    \ batteries I had left in my lap, and jammed them into his trouser-pockets.\n\
    I was astounded by his vest. It seemed to shimmer. Despite the autumn chill, he\
    \ wore no shirt, no jumper nor jacket. His vest was resplendent and numinous.\n\
    He had turned on his heel, and was about to bound away as swiftly as he had come,\
    \ but I called out to him, involuntarily, \u201CMy, what a vest!\u201D, or some\
    \ such words. He stopped, swivelled round to face me, and said\u2014oh! and I\
    \ remember every last nuance, as if he had spoken but a moment ago\u2014\u201C\
    I wear the Tundist's vest\u201D.\nNow this was most irregular. I am the most slavish\
    \ of Tundists, and one thing we absolutely forbid is to announce our identity\
    \ so blatantly. In retrospect, it has to be said that Glew\u2014the wearer of\
    \ the Vest, whose name was tattooed on his forearm\u2014was lax, obtuse\u2026\
    \ yes, lax and obtuse. Yet however unforgivable his lapse, I cannot find it in\
    \ my heart to scold his memory. Had he not spoken those words, had he continued\
    \ to hare away from me, my batteries in his pockets, and me dumbfounded, thunderstruck,\
    \ well, I would probably never have become a Tundist in my turn, and my life would\
    \ have been very different, my life would have been unbearable.\nAt the time,\
    \ of course, I was unaware of all this. For me, what Glew had said was irregular,\
    \ not the fact that he had said it at all. I thought I had misheard him. He was\
    \ already turning away from me again. \u201CI beg your pardon?\u201D I shouted,\
    \ rather too loudly, to forestall him. My eyes were still glued to the shining\
    \ vest. He turned back once more, and repeated the mysterious words.\nI was young\
    \ and garrulous. The vest, and curiosity, had driven the stolen batteries from\
    \ my mind. \u201CAnd who or what, pray, is the Tundist?\u201D I asked. He realised\
    \ the error he had made, came to his senses, and, dissembling, mumbled some hogwash,\
    \ then sprang away. In my ignorance, I thought him a cracker-brain, and resolved\
    \ to warn the fireworks factory sentries to keep a look-out for him. I wheeled\
    \ myself back to my hut, my ablutions, and my banjo. But I did not forget him.\n\
    Who or what is the Tundist? Without realising it, I had asked a stupendous and\
    \ world-shuddering question. The simple answer\u2014the best answer\u2014is to\
    \ dig out Binder, but as I have said, nowadays that is not so easy. Make do, then,\
    \ with these words, scribbled on the back of a fag packet by the great theorist\
    \ of Tundism, Diocletian Birdbag: \u201CYou will know a Tundist by these signs:\
    \ an upside-down badger tattoo on the torso; a punnet carried by means of a looped\
    \ string hung from the right shoulder; worldly wisdom; a Tundist Hat and a Tundist\
    \ Vest; the breath of unknown planets; the gait of unknown stars. The Tundist\
    \ is a woman or man who has cut loose from all peasant frailty, who has knelt\
    \ before the Tundist flag, who has crushed beneath balletic feet the paltry scrimscrums\
    \ of time and space. But no cult we! All can seek the rigours of Tundism, though\
    \ many will fall by the wayside. The true Tundist is one who has sucked on spangles,\
    \ fluttered as a moth, ascended the Ladder of Sibodnedwab, crackled, sparked,\
    \ and spun. A web is a window. A fact is a truce. A brain is a nest. Know the\
    \ Tundist through cargpan and stitchery, through what the Tundist is and was and\
    \ did and does and dares and daren't and digs. Soil sanctified\u2014sanctity soiled.\
    \ Yes, wear a balaclava, chew a twig, rail at flies and foundries. The Tundist\
    \ wears another hat, a special Vest\u2026 a Tundist's Vest.\u201D\nTo be continued\u2026\
