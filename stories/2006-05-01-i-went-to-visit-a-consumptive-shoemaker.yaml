  text: '"I went to visit a consumptive shoemaker; seated here I can single out his
    very house, nay, the very window of the room in which he is lying. On that straw
    roof might the raven alight, and flap his sable wings. There, at this moment,
    is the supreme tragedy being enacted. A woman is weeping there, and little children
    are looking on with a sore bewilderment. Before nightfall the poor peaked face
    of the bowed artisan will have gathered its ineffable peace, and the widow will
    be led away from the bedside by the tenderness of neighbours, and the cries of
    the orphan brood will be stilled. And yet this present indubitable suffering and
    loss does not touch me like the sorrow of the woman of the ballad, the phantom
    probably of a minstrel''s brain. The shoemaker will be forgotten--I shall be forgotten."
