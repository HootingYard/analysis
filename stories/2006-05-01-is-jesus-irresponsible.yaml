  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Pansy Cradledew, I fear I must protest that you gave
    publicity to Jesus Inspirational Sport Statues by including it as one of your
    so-called ''detours'' yesterday. In many of the representations, Jesus is shown
    inappropriately dressed for the sport, such as attempting to kick a football in
    sandals, or perform ballet in an ancient Hebrew shift. By choosing not to wear
    kneepads or safety helmet when rollerblading, Our Lord is setting a poor example
    to today''s youth with His reckless behaviour. In many of the scenes, He only
    seems to be participating in the sport half-heartedly, just standing around with
    His arms posed in what He thinks is some kind of benevolent attitude. It''s all
    a bit wishy-washy and unsportsgodlike. As for the golf statue, should He not be
    mindful of the traumas the Roman Catholic church has undergone in recent years
    due to the antics of its less salubrious priests? Yours in Christ, Pansy Cradledew.


    Having reviewed the site, and looked more carefully at some of the statues, I
    think Pansy has a point. In any case, would it not be more inspirational to show
    the little tots with Satan looming over their shoulders, threatening them with
    fire and brimstone unless they perked their ideas up and went out there to win?
    Where can I find Beelzebub Inspirational Sport Statues?'
