  text: "Testimony Of A Tundist, part three. The first two episodes appeared on April\
    \ 29th and 30th.\nSlowly but surely, my banjoing fell to rack and ruin. The fireworks\
    \ factory hands, all four hundred and fourteen of them, began to find other amusements\
    \ for their lunchtime revels: skittles, boules, chuck-mattress. The day came when\
    \ I did not even bother to wheel myself up onto my plinth, banjo in one hand and\
    \ a clutch of song-sheets in the other, and nobody noticed, and nobody cared.\
    \ I knew then that I would have to leave. I was penniless, witless and, twenty\
    \ three hours out of twenty four, distraught and fraught. And insomniac.\nWhy?\
    \ I could not have said, in those grim days. Only in retrospect can I see, so\
    \ clearly, the admixture of yearning, numbskullery, and a scarcely perceptible\
    \ throb of impossible glory which nestled in the root of my being. Or to put it\
    \ another way\u2014what was it about that Vest that the sense of it prowled through\
    \ every nerve of my body? I was certain that it was the Vest, and not the man\
    \ who wore it. I was equally sure that it was not even the Vest itself, but the\
    \ Vest's glow\u2026 perhaps simply the glow, the shimmer.\nIn the first days after\
    \ that singular encounter by the pond, I would be plucking some happy-go-lucky\
    \ sea shanty to a blissful crowd of factory workers when the glow would impinge\
    \ upon me, pellucid and incandescent, and of a sudden I would be all butterfingers,\
    \ and my fluting voice would crack. As weeks passed, the glow did not merely cause\
    \ the odd hiccough in the middle of a song, but led to me breaking into uncontrollable\
    \ sobs, tossing my banjo aside, and wheeling myself away, away.\nAs the tocsin\
    \ rang and the workers trooped back to their posts, I would sometimes overhear\
    \ them exchanging theories about my indisposition: drink, tumour, neurasthenia,\
    \ the jangles, snapping synapses. I half-believed half the theories myself. Strangely,\
    \ I never tried to locate Glew, wearer of the glowing Vest. As it was, I could\
    \ barely recall what on earth he looked like. Had he stood before me with the\
    \ Vest absent or covered, I knew I would never have recognised him.\nOn with it:\
    \ I left the factory, bound I knew not where. I lived for months on hawberries\
    \ and handfuls of water cupped from streams. I was dallied with by a wandering\
    \ band of rogues who bent the spokes on my wheelchair. A stinking barn was my\
    \ haven for the winter. In February I found a crate of liquorice abandoned and\
    \ hawked its contents in a scattering of dreary hamlets. One day I was covered\
    \ in soot, I cannot remember how. In March, in an orchard, I fell out of my wheelchair,\
    \ and lay in the damp grass mewling through the night, until rescued at dawn by\
    \ a cherry-cheeked farmer's wife who gave me another haven at her hearth for a\
    \ brace of days, until her goitred son strode home from hunting and pitched me\
    \ out the door with curses and a bludgeon. April found me moping in a fishing\
    \ village. In May, through a combination of luck, low cunning, and a road accident,\
    \ I attended a Tundist gathering. Let me tell you about it.\nI was squelching\
    \ my way through a reeking ditch not ten miles east of Flappings, that dim and\
    \ abominable fishing village, when ahead of me, making an assiduous study of toadstools,\
    \ I saw Glew, or a man I took for Glew\u2014a man, at any rate, who wore a glowing\
    \ vest. Destiny's darning-needle pierced my soul. If that sounds laughably melodramatic,\
    \ laugh\u2014but laugh in the knowledge that I am being painfully sincere. Quaking,\
    \ I wheeled myself frantically through the mud towards him. I was far too excited\
    \ to greet him with a wayfarer's cheery \u201Chello\u201D.\n\u201CIs that the\
    \ Tundist's vest?\u201D I blurted. He sprang upright, dropping a little inspection\
    \ fork from his right\u2014no, left\u2014hand, and fixed me with what can only\
    \ be described as a steely glare. His face was like most faces.\n\u201CTrap frap\
    \ moon,\u201D he said. Nonsensical as the words were, he freighted them with meaning.\
    \ Meaning what? My hearing is often muddy. I decided to ignore his remark, and\
    \ repeated my question. The man's countenance changed. He assumed the mask of\
    \ a simpleton. I had, you see, made it quite clear to him that I was no Tundist.\
    \ If you have a copy of Binder, read the section on modes of greeting and farewell.\
    \ Binder\u2014not I\u2014will tell you the exact words with which I would have\
    \ replied, had I then worn the Tundist's Vest. But no, he knew me for what I was\u2014\
    a Strob.\nI said I would not quote from Binder, but I am tired, and a short extract\
    \ will do no harm: Tundists divide the world cleanly into two populations: on\
    \ the one hand, themselves, and on the other, everyone else, non-Tundists, whom\
    \ they term Strobs. In their traffick with Strobs, the Tundists display an air\
    \ of simple-mindedness, almost a cretinism, by which means they hope to discourage\
    \ any intercourse or engagement with the non-Tundist world. In this sense, perhaps,\
    \ they are exclusive and cultist.\nBut, might I add, it would be wrong to construe\
    \ from this that we Tundists distance ourselves from or despise the world. The\
    \ matter is far more complex. It is Binder's one lapse. Should his book one day\
    \ be reissued, I hope to ensure that a corrective footnote is inserted. We are,\
    \ you will recall, worldly-wise, and our reluctance to go blabbering about, proclaiming\
    \ our Tundism willy nilly, is based upon the stern directive issued by Diocletian\
    \ Birdbag in that great foundation stone of our Vestery, the Gruesome Pages, the\
    \ only copy of which is housed in a heavily-guarded marble monstrosity in the\
    \ Pavilion of Tund, to which no map that I know of will direct you.\n\u201CYou\
    \ are not Glew, are you? Do you know Glew?\u201D I prattled. The man began to\
    \ drool and mumbled something incomprehensible. \u201CWhere did you get that vest?\
    \ It is tremendous! Can I get one?\u201D\nI am afraid I babbled on like this for\
    \ some time. While I was doing so, the man retrieved his fork from the muck, carefully\
    \ wiped it clean with a fork-cleaning cloth and, placing half a dozen toadstools\
    \ into his punnet, slung it over his shoulder and started to walk away from me.\
    \ He let out a couple of yelps and continued to drool. With hindsight, I have\
    \ to say that he rather overdid his pretence of doltishness, but it worked a treat\
    \ at the time. As he made off, I followed him.\nTo be continued\u2026"
