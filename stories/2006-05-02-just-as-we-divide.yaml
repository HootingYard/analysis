  text: "Episode four of our new daily serial Testimony Of A Tundist\nJust as we divide\
    \ people into Tundists and Strobs, so with objects. Every different class of thing\u2014\
    plants, implements, landscapes, weaponry, minerals, etc\u2014is split, violently,\
    \ into the Tund and the Strob. So, for example, with the sub-class root vegetables:\
    \ turnips, parsnips, and potatoes are, as we say \u201Cof Tund\u201D, whereas\
    \ such loathsome abominations as carrots are \u201CStrobs\u201D. Or consider implements,\
    \ more particularly that branch of implementa known as kitchen utensils: of Tund,\
    \ whisks, forks, and cheese graters; Strob, cruets and spoons.\nMy examples, of\
    \ course, are far from exhaustive. There is a taxonomy of Tundism which initiates\
    \ must learn. One of the tests inflicted upon those who seek to wear the Vest\
    \ is a four-hour question-and-answer session, of merciless rigour, at which students\
    \ will have a list of disparate and random nouns screeched at them by the Interrogators\
    \ (usually twelve in number) and must reply, loudly and instantly, \u201CTund\u201D\
    \ or \u201CStrob\u201D. Most have to attempt this examination dozens of times\
    \ before succeeding, and some never do. Countless are the times a glazed and incoherent\
    \ aspirant will be shouting \u201CStrund!\u201D or \u201CTob!\u201D after the\
    \ first ten minutes, only to be led sheepishly from the hall with a sympathetic\
    \ pat on the head and an injunction to buckle down to further study.\nWhen new\
    \ objects come into being\u2014inventions, discoveries, exhumations\u2014a Tundist\
    \ committee is called into session to debate whether to admit the thing to the\
    \ Tundist pantheon or to consign it to the dustbin of Strob. I was once called\
    \ to sit on the committee, when a new item of smuggler's headgear was brought\
    \ to our attention. The session lasted for two weeks, with a bitter division of\
    \ opinion among the members. We do not rest, you see, until a unanimous decision\
    \ has been reached and, with two hundred and two Tundists sitting together, there\
    \ can be grave difficulties. The smuggler's speckled hood, by the way, was finally\
    \ classified as of Tund.\nAs he made off, I followed him. I have no talent for\
    \ landscapes: I will not attempt to describe the surroundings through which, for\
    \ three and a half hours, I struggled to propel myself in his wake. Not once did\
    \ he look back. Perhaps he knew I was tailing him, perhaps not. Eventually we\
    \ arrived at a village, a miserable cluster of clapboard buildings dominated by\
    \ a round stone tower topped by one of the tallest lightning rods I have ever\
    \ seen. We had negotiated only a few of the village's foul alleyways when I guessed\
    \ that my quarry was headed for the tower. Is this the Tower of the Tundists?,\
    \ I thought. It was not: there is no such structure. My assumption was correct,\
    \ however. Still without glancing behind him, the vested man vanished into the\
    \ tower through a doorway. Undeterred, I wheeled myself after him, only to be\
    \ stopped short by a figure lurking in the shadows of the portal. She was stooping\
    \ and grey, and she too wore the Vest. Her voice was shrill but kindly.\n\u201C\
    I am afraid you cannot enter the tower,\u201D she said.\n\u201CI must! I must!\u201D\
    \ I wailed. Had I had the use of my legs, I would have stamped my feet. Oh, petulant\
    \ me.\n\u201CI am so sorry,\u201D she said, and she meant it. She gently eased\
    \ the big oak door shut, and I heard her lock it from the inside.\nBribery. Subterfuge.\
    \ Reckless daring. I had nothing of value to effect the first, and my intellect\
    \ was not sufficient to cope with the second. As for the third, a woman in a wheelchair\
    \ who, if I have not mentioned it before, was wracked by influenza and who had\
    \ eaten only a discarded dough bun in the last two days, was in no fit state to\
    \ engage in derring-do, to clamber up the walls of the tower and climb in through\
    \ an upper window, or to obtain a few sticks of dynamite and blast the door open.\
    \ What else could I do?\nI pounded the door with my fist. The shrill grey woman\
    \ opened a little hatch, at her eye level, and peered down at me, not without\
    \ sympathy.\n\u201CTrap flap moon!\u201D I cried. It was worth trying.\nShe looked\
    \ at me quizzically, as if thinking very carefully about what I had said. I had\
    \ no idea what I meant, but, surprisingly for me, I had correctly intuited the\
    \ Tundist password\u2014almost.\n\u201CAh,\u201D she said, after a long pause.\
    \ The key will turn in the lock, she will open the door, they will let me in,\
    \ I will join them, whoever they are, my eyes and ears and heart and brain and\
    \ spleen will explode with glory\u2026\n\u201CFrap,\u201D she said, \u201CFrap.\
    \ I really am sorry,\u201D and the hatch was closed again, and my head was ajangle.\
    \ I went for a roll around the tower, slowly, trying to think. I sensed\u2014\
    I knew\u2014that inside that tower there were at least two people, the man I had\
    \ followed and the woman who barred my way, and both wore vests that shone with\
    \ an unearthly glow, and perhaps there were even more of them inside, Glew perhaps,\
    \ and others I had never seen, and I wanted to join them, I wanted them to welcome\
    \ me, embrace me, explain to me the hot mystery nestling like an egg inside me,\
    \ make me understand the tremors which darted through me as the image of that\
    \ glow settled in my brain, in my heart, in the pit of my stomach, oh, I knew\
    \ I could not bear to live longer without the succour they could give me. I circled\
    \ the tower a second time, now seeking other entrances, but there were none.\n\
    Close to tears, I steered myself away from the tower, thinking to find a tavern\
    \ in one of the tenebrous alleys where I could sing a couple of tear-stained ballads\
    \ in return for a bowl of broth and enough firewater to douse the inferno in my\
    \ skull. As I entered a particularly ill-starred row of hovels, somebody was maimed,\
    \ and my luck came in. It happened very quickly: cyclist careering along, sudden\
    \ appearance of wheelchair rolling dead into the cyclist's path, skewed swerve\
    \ to avoid collision, cyclist smashes into wall of derelict bakery, crumples to\
    \ the ground, awful tangle of limbs and flesh and rubber and metal, gash on forehead,\
    \ wheels still spinning, cyclist passing out.\nAnd me? My eyes were popping out.\
    \ The cyclist wore a Tundist's vest. Forgive me: there was nobody about. I went\
    \ over to the bleeding man, reached down to him, disentangled him as best as I\
    \ could from his mangled bicycle, and then disentangled the vest from him. I tore\
    \ off my windcheater and blouse, and pulled on the vest. Scrambling back to the\
    \ tower, beating on the door, this time wearing the Vest, this time saying \u201C\
    frap\u201D, this time the door opening, letting me pass, guiding me in\u2026 I\
    \ found my haven among the Tundists.\nDo not imagine that I am\u2014was\u2014\
    a callous wretch. I called for an ambulance, from the telephone in the tower,\
    \ and the cyclist was nursed back to health within days, and was brought to us\
    \ on a stretcher, and I sought him out, and told him what I had done, and why\
    \ I had done it, and he understood, he placed his bruised hand in mine and said\
    \ he understood. I returned the Vest to him, for of course I was not yet worthy\
    \ of it. Once safe inside the tower, I had not tried to deceive the Tundists.\
    \ I told them everything. They had me wait in a room filled with crocuses and\
    \ dust. On the other side of the tower, in another room, twenty Tundists deliberated.\
    \ As darkness fell, the shrill grey woman wheeled me to them, through passages\
    \ loud with the hiss of an extraordinary network of piping, funnels, ducts and\
    \ cylinders, and as we entered the room, a Tundist with a stovepipe hat and a\
    \ crimson face moved towards me and announced their decision. They did not cast\
    \ me out.\nTo be continued\u2026"
