  text: "Came the day the fanatical adherents of Trebizondo Culpeper smashed their\
    \ way by main force through the huge iron gates of Fort Hoity. They were both\
    \ astonished and disappointed to find the fort deserted, save for a tethered goat\
    \ in the courtyard. The goat's tether extended far enough for it to be able to\
    \ reach a flowerbed by one fort wall, so it was a well-nourished goat as well\
    \ as a tethered goat.\n\u201CThat goat,\u201D said the fanatical Trebizondo Culpeper\
    \ adherent they called Bim, \u201CHas eaten half the flowers in that flowerbed,\
    \ and has not even begun on the weeds.\u201D\nHis companions jotted this observation\
    \ down in their logbooks, under \u201CB For Bim\u201D. They each used the spidery\
    \ handwriting they had learned at the feet of Trebizondo Culpeper's pencilling\
    \ master, the nameless gravel-voiced Peruvian laundry basket man who had inadvertently\
    \ sent them to Fort Hoity in the first place. Replacing their logbooks in their\
    \ pockets, the adherents gathered about Bim, who was now lolling by a brazier\
    \ in which hot coals burned still. Clearly, the fort had not long been abandoned.\n\
    \u201CThis fort has not long been abandoned,\u201D said Bim, \u201CFor the coals\
    \ in this brazier burn still. But how did the fort people flee? If they had left\
    \ by the huge iron gates, we would have seen them when we were standing on the\
    \ hill as dawn broke and we ate our breakfasts. The plans of the fort which we\
    \ have studied so conscientiously show no other exits. This, then, is a highly\
    \ perplexing circumstance. I wonder if that goat, in addition to being tethered\
    \ and well-fed, is also a talking goat?\u201D\nThe fanatical adherent known as\
    \ Bam slapped his forehead. \u201CFor crying out loud, Bim!\u201D he shouted,\
    \ \u201CHave you taken leave of your senses? There is no such thing under the\
    \ heavens as a goat that speaks human languages. That is the stuff of fairy tales.\u201D\
    \nThe other fanatical adherents mumbled together as a group. Both Bim and Bam\
    \ had them confused now, for they had expected to enter Fort Hoity through main\
    \ force and to be chopping and slashing and unleashing madcap havoc. Instead they\
    \ were standing around mumbling and pondering the connection, if there was one,\
    \ between fairies, elves, sprites and goats. The fanatical adherent named Diocletian,\
    \ much mustachioed, raised the topic of tethering. If one could tether a goat,\
    \ as the Fort Hoity goat had been tethered, could one tether a fairy? Would a\
    \ fairy not be nimble enough to slip its bonds? To this, Pembroket suggested that\
    \ a fairy could surely be tethered by using gossamer thin magical thread. The\
    \ mumbling grew louder. Time was passing. Bim made an announcement.\n\u201CNot\
    \ many leagues yonder is Fort Toity. I know in my bones that that is where the\
    \ Fort Hoity people have gone. I know not how they got there, but that is where\
    \ they must be. We shall leave a team here to secure the place, and the rest of\
    \ us will march like the clappers to Fort Toity. And we shall untether the goat\
    \ and take it with us.\u201D\nAnd so Bim and his bedraggled gang of fanatical\
    \ Trebizondo Culpeper adherents set out to traipse across the plain, whistling\
    \ as they marched. Those who had not undergone whistling training parped hooters\
    \ instead, or imitated crows, corncrakes, and loons. Every so often they would\
    \ stop and sit, and eat from their bags of confectionery, and Bim or Bam would\
    \ make pronouncements and the band of fanatical adherents would jot down their\
    \ aper\xE7us. All sorts of subjects related to the teachings of Trebizondo Culpeper\
    \ were covered, from dishwater and clanging noises to oil slicks and the bossa\
    \ nova, from freckles and optometry to cuddy and tack. They tied a colourful and\
    \ perfumed rag to one ear of the untethered goat, and let it lead the way across\
    \ the plain towards Fort Toity.\nSo who were they, the people they pursued, who\
    \ had fled from Fort Hoity to Fort Toity and who were now being borne down upon,\
    \ slowly but surely, by the fanatical adherents of Trebizondo Culpeper and an\
    \ untethered goat? First, they were the people who made miniature cardboard hens\
    \ and placed them on the sides of paths. Second, they execrated the very name\
    \ of Trebizondo Culpeper, regularly, every night in fact, as they sat around their\
    \ brazier of hot coals, staring at the moon, if it was visible through the clouds.\
    \ If the moon was not visible they shut their eyes. They would sit quite still\
    \ for so long that birds would nest in their hair and moss grow upon their feet.\
    \ There were more than a hundred of them, and they worshipped nothing, not even\
    \ the tethered goat they had so cruelly abandoned back at Fort Hoity.\nWhy did\
    \ they not take the goat with them, as they fled? This is the kind of question\
    \ the out of print pamphleteer Dobson would have addressed, had he been alive\
    \ at the time of which I write. But he was yet to be born. It is hard for us to\
    \ imagine a world without Dobson, a world where inexplicable things could happen\u2014\
    did happen!\u2014and there was no hastily-scribbled pamphlet issued, within days\
    \ or weeks, to make sense of events. How one would have longed for even a few\
    \ precious pages entitled Why Those Who Fled Fort Hoity For Fort Toity To Escape\
    \ The Fanatical Adherents Of Trebizondo Culpeper Cruelly Abandoned Their Tethered\
    \ Goat, With Footnotes And A Map!\nA map would certainly have been of use to the\
    \ pursuers, who became utterly lost on that barren plain. Try as they might, they\
    \ could not find Fort Toity. They wandered for months, led by the goat, until\
    \ their confectionery bags were empty, and the batteries on Bim's portable metal\
    \ tapping machine were dead. They were far from home, exhausted and hungry and\
    \ increasingly rancorous. Pembroket in particular was thoroughly frazzled, and\
    \ took to poking his fellows with a pointy stick, until they took it away from\
    \ him and stamped on his toes until he promised to desist. And desist he did,\
    \ for he fell victim to an ague, sweating and shaking and babbling incoherent\
    \ gibberish. Bam accused him of having a spurious ague, to elicit sympathy.\n\
    Diocletian said \u201CThis is not the first time you have made an accusation of\
    \ spurious ague, Bam. Do you have an id\xE9e fix\xE9e?\u201D\nBam replied: \u201C\
    Yes I do. Is that so wrong?\u201D\nBut Pembroket's ague was all too real, and\
    \ it was on the Thursday morning he expired out on that plain that the fanatical\
    \ adherents of Trebizondo Culpeper were plunged into despair. One by one they\
    \ perished, and with them perished the cult of Trebizondo Culpeper."
