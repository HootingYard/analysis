  text: 'Last week, outside a semi-derelict tin kiosk perched on the brow of Pang
    Hill, our favourite octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins announced the Hooting Yard
    Music Prize 2006. Here is a transcript of her speech, from which various interruptions
    (hacking cough, drooling, unexplained shrieks) have been excised:

    The rules for the Hooting Yard Music Prize this year are so simple that even the
    snivelling infants chained up in Pang Hill Orphanage will be able to understand
    them. Rule One is that the entries should be musical settings of words taken from
    anywhere on the Hooting Yard website. That includes all the quotations from other
    writers with which each bulletin begins. Rule Two is that entries should aspire
    to sound like the piece of music described by Marie Corelli in The Sorrows Of
    Satan (1895). I quote:


    Marie Corelli

    "The music swelled into passionate cadence--melodies crossed and re-crossed each
    other like rays of light glittering among green leaves--voices of birds and streams
    and tossing waterfalls chimed in with songs of love and playful merriment; anon
    came wilder strains of grief and angry clamour; cries of despair were heard echoing
    through the thunderous noise of some relentless storm, farewells everlastingly
    shrieked amid sobs of reluctant shuddering agony; and then, as I listened, before
    my eyes a black mist gathered slowly, and I thought I saw great rocks bursting
    asunder into flame, and drifting islands in a sea of fire--faces, wonderful, hideous,
    beautiful, peered at me out of a darkness denser than night, and in the midst
    of this there came a tune, complete in sweetness and suggestion--a piercing, sword-like
    tune that plunged into my very heart and rankled there--my breath failed me, my
    senses swam, I felt that I must move, speak, cry out, and implore that this music,
    this horribly insidious music should cease ere I swooned with the voluptuous poison
    of it--when, with a full chord of splendid harmony that rolled out upon the air
    like a breaking wave, the intoxicating sounds ebbed away into silence. No one
    spoke--our hearts were yet beating too wildly with the pulsations roused by that
    wondrous lyric storm. Diana Chesney was the first to break the spell. ''Well,
    that beats everything I''ve ever heard!'' she murmured tremulously."

    Before you start to complain that one can hardly affix an exclamation mark to
    a murmur, tremulous or otherwise, I want you to reread those two rules. That is
    all you need to know. So pick up your viol or banjo or sackbut or what have you,
    choose some words from the Hooting Yard website, and set to work as if your life
    depended upon it!

    Insignificant details such as closing date, judging panel, prize etc will follow.'
