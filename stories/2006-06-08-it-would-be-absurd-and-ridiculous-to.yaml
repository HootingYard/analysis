  text: "\u201CIt would be absurd and ridiculous to suppose that any person, however\
    \ great, or learned, or wise, could employ language correctly without a knowledge\
    \ of the things expressed by that language\u2026 It would not be like the sweet\
    \ notes of the choral songsters of the grove, for they warble hymns of gratitude\
    \ to God; not like the boding of the distant owl, for that tells the profound\
    \ solemnity of night; not like the hungry lion roaring for his prey, for that\
    \ tells of death and plunder; not like the distant notes of the clarion, for that\
    \ tells of blood and carnage, of tears and anguish, of widowhood and orphanage.\
    \ It can be compared to nothing but a Babel of confusion in which their own folly\
    \ is worse confounded.\u201D \u2014 William S Balch, Lectures On Language"
