  text: '"It would be absurd and ridiculous to suppose that any person, however great,
    or learned, or wise, could employ language correctly without a knowledge of the
    things expressed by that language... It would not be like the sweet notes of the
    choral songsters of the grove, for they warble hymns of gratitude to God; not
    like the boding of the distant owl, for that tells the profound solemnity of night;
    not like the hungry lion roaring for his prey, for that tells of death and plunder;
    not like the distant notes of the clarion, for that tells of blood and carnage,
    of tears and anguish, of widowhood and orphanage. It can be compared to nothing
    but a Babel of confusion in which their own folly is worse confounded." -- William
    S Balch, Lectures On Language'
