  text: 'Yes, yes, I know you have been tearing your hair out in the absence of recent
    Hooting Yard bulletins. I can only apologise. Every now and then, I am consumed
    by self-doubt, knowing in my heart that I will never be as great a writer as the
    out of print pamphleteer Dobson. You have no idea how hard it can be, to sit staring
    at that blank screen, fingertips poised over the keyboard, knowing that no matter
    how hard you try, you will never in your life write anything fit to share the
    same universe as Squelching Through A Field Outside Oswestry During A Thunderstorm,
    Humming ''Heavy Horses'' by Jethro Tull.

    But anyway... we must all try. So Mr Key is back again, however fruitlessly. And
    with an announcement to make before anything else. The serial story Testimony
    Of A Tundist (see below for the first five episodes) ought to be continuing from
    today, but due to a very nonsensical reason has had to be postponed. The sixth
    part, and those following, will appear here from next week onwards.

    And so we move on...'
