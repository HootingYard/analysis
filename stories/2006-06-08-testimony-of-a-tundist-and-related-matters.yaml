  text: "Yes, yes, I know you have been tearing your hair out in the absence of recent\
    \ Hooting Yard bulletins. I can only apologise. Every now and then, I am consumed\
    \ by self-doubt, knowing in my heart that I will never be as great a writer as\
    \ the out of print pamphleteer Dobson. You have no idea how hard it can be, to\
    \ sit staring at that blank screen, fingertips poised over the keyboard, knowing\
    \ that no matter how hard you try, you will never in your life write anything\
    \ fit to share the same universe as Squelching Through A Field Outside Oswestry\
    \ During A Thunderstorm, Humming \u2018Heavy Horses\u2019 by Jethro Tull.\nBut\
    \ anyway\u2026 we must all try. So Mr Key is back again, however fruitlessly.\
    \ And with an announcement to make before anything else. The serial story Testimony\
    \ Of A Tundist (see below for the first five episodes) ought to be continuing\
    \ from today, but due to a very nonsensical reason has had to be postponed. The\
    \ sixth part, and those following, will appear here from next week onwards.\n\
    And so we move on\u2026"
