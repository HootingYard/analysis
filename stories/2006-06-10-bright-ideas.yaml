  text: 'You know that feeling you get sometimes, when you wake from a fitful sleep
    and the first thing that pops into your head is "I really must obtain a portrait
    of ex-Vice President Spiro Agnew, one grown from wheat or maize or some other
    crop"? It is not always easy to satisfy such a longing, although of course it
    may not be a longing or a yearning, it may simply be a flash in the pan whim,
    one which will evaporate once you get out of bed and plunge your head into ice
    cold water. Indeed, by the time you sit down to your breakfast sausages, the very
    idea may seem absurd, and you can get on with your day untroubled by such thoughts.
    For some though, there can be a sense of desperation, an absolute need that must
    be assuaged. This can be a very debilitating condition.

    Luckily, help is at hand, if one is able to divert one''s desires from the ex-Vice
    President to his boss, President Richard Milhous Nixon. All one need do is copy
    the technique used by Lillian Colton, who won the Blue Ribbon Best In Show at
    the 1969 Minnesota State Fair with her portrait of Tricky Dicky grown from seeds
    of timothy, brome grass, canola, and birdsfoot trefoil. How simple is that?
