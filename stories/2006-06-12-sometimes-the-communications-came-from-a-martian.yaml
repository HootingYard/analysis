    \ Sector 6. In a tremulous, deep voice, Sir George [King] would relay these fantastical\
    \ messages from outer space\u2026 He advised against sitting with your back to\
    \ the engine whilst on train journeys\u2026 In his predictions for 1956 he warned\
    \ of the danger of hurricanes but added that it was possibly going to be \u2018\
    an excellent season for wool\u2019.\u201D \u2014 William Shaw, Spying In Guru\
    \ Land"
