  text: '"Sometimes the communications came from a Martian bearing the rank Mars Sector
    6. In a tremulous, deep voice, Sir George [King] would relay these fantastical
    messages from outer space... He advised against sitting with your back to the
    engine whilst on train journeys... In his predictions for 1956 he warned of the
    danger of hurricanes but added that it was possibly going to be ''an excellent
    season for wool''." -- William Shaw, Spying In Guru Land'
