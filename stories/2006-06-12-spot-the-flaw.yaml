  text: 'Ratatatat! Ratatatat! Prohibition-era machine gun fire pursued Blodgett as
    he fled down an alleyway. He was panting, dripping with sweat, and made an easy
    target, decked out as he was in the colourful raiment of a Bolivian mountain goatherd.
    But the cops were poor shots, having only been issued with their new guns that
    morning, and their cack-handed bursts of ratatatat pinged harmlessly off dustbins
    and sheets of corrugated iron and other dustbins.

    Blodgett hurled himself over an impossibly high brick wall at the end of the alleyway,
    landed on his feet, and--pausing to catch his breath and light a perfumed Serbian
    cigarette with his dainty, girly little lighter--he ran on towards the railway
    station. He had to get out of town fast. They were on to him, and if he were captured
    he was looking at twenty thousand years in Sing Sing, maybe even forty thousand
    years. Jumping a freight train, Blodgett settled himself in a boxcar with a pair
    of hobos. They had many discussions over the next few days, without a single platitude
    passing their lips. Blodgett began to think he could become a hobo himself. He
    practised introducing himself as such.

    "Hello there, I am Blodgett, the Panglossian hobo," he tried, until it was pointed
    out to him by one of his boxcar hobo companions that these were ill-advised words
    for a fugitive.

    Convinced by the logic of this argument, Blodgett changed his mind and decided
    to hole up in a hideout until the heat was off. Sooner or later the cops would
    forget about him, distracted by paperwork, ratatatat practice, and the emergence
    of a previously unknown criminal mastermind bent on masterminding criminality.
    Tipping his hat to the hobos, he rolled off the freight train as it slowed on
    the outskirts of a shining city. It was a pitch black night, and Blodgett the
    Panglossian fugitive crept stealthily through the streets, chewing on a brazil
    nut, seeking an unlocked door in one of the large buildings among which he wandered.
    Dawn was still an hour away when he found one. He blundered into the deserted
    building and jammed the door shut behind him, piling up crates and boxes and cartons
    to seal himself inside. At last he was safe. He had overlooked just one thing...
