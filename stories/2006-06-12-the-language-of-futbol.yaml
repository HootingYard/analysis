  text: 'I said that I would not babble on about the World Cup, but that was merely
    a rash promise, easily broken. And how can I not mention the superb comment by
    Santiago Segurola in El Pais regarding England''s opening performance against
    Paraguay?

    "It''s hard to say what England were," he wrote, "A flat team, grotesque and contaminating."

    You can almost hear the chewy disgust in that exquisite choice of words (albeit
    in translation). Why can''t the inarticulate has-beens slumped in their TV studio

    "It was grotesque, it was contaminating, it filled my belly with disgust. Such
