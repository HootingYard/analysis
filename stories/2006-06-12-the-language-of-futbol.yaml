  text: 'I said that I would not babble on about the World Cup, but that was merely
    a rash promise, easily broken. And how can I not mention the superb comment by
    Santiago Segurola in El Pais regarding England''s opening performance against
    Paraguay?

    "It''s hard to say what England were," he wrote, "A flat team, grotesque and contaminating."

    You can almost hear the chewy disgust in that exquisite choice of words (albeit

    "It was grotesque, it was contaminating, it filled my belly with disgust. Such
    a display of depravity have I ne''er seen in all my days in the dugout."

    I have also been toying with the idea of noting down some of the more baffling
    comments from the commentary box, so watch this space...'
