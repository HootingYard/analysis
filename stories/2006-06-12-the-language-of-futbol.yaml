  text: "I said that I would not babble on about the World Cup, but that was merely\
    \ a rash promise, easily broken. And how can I not mention the superb comment\
    \ by Santiago Segurola in El Pais regarding England's opening performance against\
    \ Paraguay?\n\u201CIt's hard to say what England were,\u201D he wrote, \u201C\
    A flat team, grotesque and contaminating.\u201D\nYou can almost hear the chewy\
    \ disgust in that exquisite choice of words (albeit in translation). Why can't\
    \ the inarticulate has-beens slumped in their TV studio chairs talk like that?\n\
    \u201CWhat did you think of the first half, Brian?\u201D\n\u201CIt was grotesque,\
    \ it was contaminating, it filled my belly with disgust. Such a display of depravity\
    \ have I ne'er seen in all my days in the dugout.\u201D\nI have also been toying\
    \ with the idea of noting down some of the more baffling comments from the commentary\
    \ box, so watch this space\u2026"
