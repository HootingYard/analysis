  text: 'There is, or may have been, an old superstition that every farmyard has its
    own fiend. It is said that Beelzebub personally allotted each fiend to its farmyard,
    and ratcheted up the fiendishness of his dastardly plan by making the fiends extremely
    hard to identify. So, for example, neighbouring farmyards may have very, very
    different resident fiends--a pig here, an old rusty iron pail there, a one-legged
    hen in one farmyard and a big bright red tractor belching smoke in another. Exorcising
    a farmyard of its fiend is thus fraught with difficulty, for the average countryside
    exorcist, stepping through the gate of a farmyard for the first time, does not
    know where to begin to look.

    There is great disparity in the fiendishness of farmyard fiends, and some diabolists
    have argued that Beelzebub treated the whole matter with an uncharacteristic lack
    of diabolic concentration. For every farmyard that is stricken by an energetic
    fiend, there are many more that can pass for years, even decades, in untroubled
    bucolic peace. But of course it is the former that gain attention. Who can forget
    the ruination visited upon Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard in the 1930s, all those crop
    failures, diseases, fires, murders, contaminations and inexplicable barn collapses,
    which ceased only when a marauding night-time squirrel was captured in a net by
    Father Dermot Boggis and subjected to the full rigour of his holy wrath? It took
    six months for the exorcist to expel every last vestige of fiendishness from the
    squirrel, leaving the poor bushy-tailed mammal thin and shrivelled and exhausted
    and close to death. And yet, as it was slowly revived by the coddling of Old Ma
    Purgative at her verdant squirrel sanctuary, so too did the farmyard flourish
    anew, with majestic fields of golden wheat, gleaming new buckets replacing the
    old rusty pails, and happy, happy pigs.

    You would be forgiven for thinking that the taxonomy of farmyard fiends is precisely
    the kind of subject to which Dobson would have devoted a pamphlet or two. Indeed,
    Marigold Chew often pressed him to tackle the topic, supplying the out of print
    pamphleteer with a constant stream of newspaper cuttings about hideous devastations
    of an agricultural kidney. She was a subscriber to the once popular monthly magazine
    Glimpses Of Farmyard Ruin, and wrote many letters to the editor, some of which
    were published and one of which (October 1954) was selected as ''Letter of the
    Month'', for which Marigold received a prize. Unfortunately, the prize was a very
    large hog with a brain disease which went on wilod rampages through the house.
    Mischievously, the editor of the magazine, who had his own farmyard, regularly
    used the monthly prize to rid himself of his farmyard fiends.

    Ah yes, note the plural. What happens, you will ask, when a fiend of the farmyard
    is identified and destroyed, whether by slaughter, exorcism, or being given away
    as a prize in a raffle, tombola, or by some other means, as happened with Marigold
    Chew? Did Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard stay fiend-free once its sinister squirrel
    had its demons cast out? How attentive was Beelzebub to the welfare of those he
    had sent to wreak havoc in our bosky rural domains? Were new fiends recruited
    and trained to carry out various infernal farmyard acts of fiendishness? These
    and other questions were answered by Father Dermot Boggis himself, in his deathbed
    ravings, carefully transcribed by his wrinkled old helpmeet, the widow Popsicle.
    Among the thousands of pages she scribbled, we find this startling passage:

    "Gaaaa... gaaaa... inexplicable torment of the devil''s long poking fork... his
    ladle... cataclysm of shuddering abasement in the pit... and when did you last
    see your potatoes?... gaaaa... have the fields been hoed?... I see hundreds of
    cows... thousands of cows... millions of cows... brutes... the flames of the fiery
    furnace... a crow on the branch of a dead tree... blasts of lightning... no diesel
    for the tractor... blight!... blight!... worms eating the flesh of resurrected
    horses... never resurrect a horse... never... pass me that feeble lamp... puddles
    of sludge and slop and constant rainfall... forty days and forty nights... flooded
    fields... the wheat ruined... ergot poisoning... a gruesome figure in the shroud
    of death... find me a lonely cave... remote from human kind... dark as the midnight
    grave... and dismal as my mind... gaaaa..."

    And with that last brief flash of lucidity, the remembered words of John Eccles
    (c.1688-1735), Father Boggis relapsed into inanity, four hundred pages'' worth
    of the widow Popsicle''s palsied pencil-scrawl. The clue to the farmyard fiends''
    damnable resilience is, I think, in that reference to the crow perched on the
    branch of a dead tree. Dawn is near. The sun will soon be lighting your path to
    the far flung fields. Go and till and plough and harrow, feed your horses and
    your cows and your happy, happy pigs. You may spit upon your farmyard fiend. It
    will pester you no more. It was only ever a superstition, or it might have been.'
