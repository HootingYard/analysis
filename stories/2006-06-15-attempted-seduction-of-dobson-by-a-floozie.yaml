  text: "So here is Dobson, reclining in an arbour on a bright, fresh morning. The\
    \ grass is dew-dappled. Dobson has an air of lassitude. In his right hand he holds\
    \ a slim volume of twee verse, but he is not reading. He is gazing into the middle\
    \ distance, rapt in thought. Little birds are perched on a bower above him, and\
    \ they are singing sweet and mellifluous airs.\nI'm sorry, that is wholly inaccurate.\
    \ Let's start again. It is pouring with rain. Dobson, windswept and dejected,\
    \ is trudging along the muddy towpath of the canal. He has a scowl on his face.\
    \ Suddenly, he stops, and peers at something floating in the canal, something\
    \ fetid and rotting and quite unidentifiable. So fascinating does Dobson find\
    \ this soggy nothing that he does not notice the approach of Popsie Shadrach,\
    \ the notorious floozie.\n\u201CYou were absorbed in thought, Dobson,\u201D observes\
    \ the wanton, planting herself in front of him and twirling some taffeta frippery\
    \ through her long fingers, the nails of which are painted crimson or scarlet\
    \ or some other garish colour suitable for a floozie's manicure.\n\u201CI was\
    \ indeed\u201D replies the pamphleteer, after clearing his throat and spitting\
    \ into the canal. There is a slim volume of twee verse by Dennis Beerpint poking\
    \ out of the pocket of his grubby jacket, and it does not go unremarked by Popsie.\n\
    \u201CYou were thinking of her you love, I would wager\u201D she says, and sighs.\
    \ It is a startlingly impassioned sigh, but Dobson appears not to take a blind\
    \ bit of notice. Instead, he begins trying to dislodge a shred of cabbage from\
    \ his teeth, at first by probing with his tongue, and then by shoving a calloused\
    \ finger into his gob. Dobson's nails are unpainted. In fact, they are hideously\
    \ gnawed. Popsie Shadrach sighs again, languidly this time.\n\u201CYou are beloved\
    \ in return\u2014yes, Dobson, most charming of out of print pamphleteers, you\
    \ are indeed beloved,\u201D she says. There is a tremulousness in her voice, a\
    \ throbbing in her breast, and a fleeting shudder as Dobson finally manages to\
    \ extract the shred of cabbage and inadvertently flicks it into her face. She\
    \ blinks, but regains her sultriness and edges closer to the pamphleteer.\n\u201C\
    Are you certain?\u201D he replies, eventually, though he is still peering at the\
    \ decaying matter which is bobbing in the water.\n\u201COh, I am but too certain.\
    \ You are beloved\u2014oh, how madly, by me!\u201D cries Popsie, and she flings\
    \ herself at his feet, caring not a jot that her gaudy red dress is now covered\
    \ in muck.\n\u201CBy you, Popsie Shadrach, notorious floozie that you are? You\
    \ jest surely\u2014Rise, rise, I beseech you from your unbecoming posture\u2014\
    unbecoming towards me\u201D shouts Dobson, turning to look at Popsie for the first\
    \ time. As he does so, a maniac crow flies past very close to his head, attracted\
    \ perhaps by the beetles which crawl through his unkempt hair.\n\u201COh, Dobson,\
    \ I love you, I adore you! Spurn me not then, I conjure you, for I cannot, cannot\
    \ conquer the fatal passion with which you have inspired me\u201D implores the\
    \ notorious floozie, clutching at the hem of Dobson's filthy jacket, and pulling\
    \ on it so violently that the slim volume of twee verse by Dennis Beerpint falls\
    \ from his pocket into a puddle. Dobson stamps his big boot onto the ruined paperback,\
    \ squelching it underfoot.\n\u201CMistress Shadrach, you strike me with horror!\
    \ It is Marigold Chew, my muse, amanuensis and typesetter, that I love\u201D he\
    \ snarls. On the other side of the canal, a lugubrious pig emerges from a clump\
    \ of trees. It has roamed far from its sty, and is quite lost.\n\u201CWhat\u2014\
    and you will never love me, pamphleteer?\u201D babbles Popsie.\n\u201CNo, never\
    \ while I have breath\u2014never!\u201D yells Dobson, slightly distracted by the\
    \ appearance of the pig and wondering whether or not to report its sighting to\
    \ the nearest Lost And Abandoned Pig Reporting Station. \u201CAllow me, if possible,\
    \ to respect you,\u201D he adds, though he has no intention of doing so.\nPopsie\
    \ Shadrach claws at his jacket, rises to her feet, and takes a melodramatic step\
    \ backwards, almost toppling into the canal. She flails her arms alarmingly, and\
    \ declares in a screech, \u201CCurses then seize thee, miscreant! I will live\
    \ to blast thee for this!\u201D\nThe pig disappears back into the trees, but not\
    \ before Dobson has taken out his notepad and pencil and jotted down a memorandum.\
    \ Popsie Shadrach awaits his response, frozen in an attitude of boiling rage.\n\
    \u201CMost infamous of women,\u201D says Dobson, once he is satisfied that he\
    \ will be able to make an accurate report of the lost pig, adding, as he returns\
    \ his pad and pencil to his inside pocket, \u201CLet me fly from thy loathed presence\u2014\
    let me in the wide world seek a refuge from infamy and shame, for infamy it is\
    \ to be the object of thy love!\u201D\nBatting Popsie aside, the pamphleteer trudges\
    \ off along the towpath. There is a cloudburst overhead, and the rain splatters\
    \ down relentlessly. Popsie scampers back to the car park and revs her souped-up\
    \ jalopy, thundering off at reckless speed towards a gin joint.\nWe do not know\
    \ whether Dobson was actually seized by her curses, nor whether she succeeded\
    \ in blasting him, but it may be pertinent that when he went to the Lost And Abandoned\
    \ Pig Reporting Station later that day, to report his sighting of the lugubrious\
    \ pig, he found it shut.\nNOTE : With a few minor adjustments, the lines of dialogue\
    \ in the above have been stolen from Zofloya : or, The Moor by Charlotte Dacre\
    \ (1806)"
