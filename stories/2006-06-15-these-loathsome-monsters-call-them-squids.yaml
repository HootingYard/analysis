  text: '"These loathsome monsters--call them squids, or devil-fish, or what you will--would
    sometimes come and throw their horrible tentacles over the side of the frail craft
    from which the divers were working, and actually fasten on to the men themselves,
    dragging them out into the water. At other times octopuses have been known to
    attack the divers down below, and hold them relentlessly under water until life
    was extinct." -- Louis De Rougemont, Adventures Of Louis De Rougemont'
