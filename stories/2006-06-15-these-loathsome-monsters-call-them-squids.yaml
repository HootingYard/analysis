  text: "\u201CThese loathsome monsters\u2014call them squids, or devil-fish, or what\
    \ you will\u2014would sometimes come and throw their horrible tentacles over the\
    \ side of the frail craft from which the divers were working, and actually fasten\
    \ on to the men themselves, dragging them out into the water. At other times octopuses\
    \ have been known to attack the divers down below, and hold them relentlessly\
    \ under water until life was extinct.\u201D \u2014 Louis De Rougemont, Adventures\
