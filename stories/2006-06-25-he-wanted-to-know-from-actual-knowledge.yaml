  text: "\u201CHe wanted to know from actual knowledge what sort of places the saloons\
    \ were. What he saw after a dozen visits to as many different groggeries added\
    \ fuel to the flame of indignation that burned already hot in him. The sight of\
    \ the vast army of men turning into beasts in these dens created in him a loathing\
    \ and a hatred of the whole iniquitous institution that language failed to express.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Charles M Sheldon, The Crucifixion Of Philip Strong"
