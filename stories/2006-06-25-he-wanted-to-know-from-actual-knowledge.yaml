  text: '"He wanted to know from actual knowledge what sort of places the saloons
    were. What he saw after a dozen visits to as many different groggeries added fuel
    to the flame of indignation that burned already hot in him. The sight of the vast
    army of men turning into beasts in these dens created in him a loathing and a
    hatred of the whole iniquitous institution that language failed to express." --
