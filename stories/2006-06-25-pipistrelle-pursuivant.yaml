  text: "The pipistrelle pursuivant is a heraldic bat, usually golden and black, but\
    \ sometimes red. It appears on shields, flags, and banners, visible when the banners\
    \ are unfurled but hidden when they are furled. In its furled state, the bat is\
    \ known as a clandestine pipistrelle pursuivant.\nYou will have seen this decorative\
    \ bat if you have ever visited the bleak and crumbling stately home you pass if\
    \ you are cycling between Pointy Town and O'Houlihan's Wharf. It is easy to miss\
    \ it, as the house is set in vast overgrown grounds and the grounds are ringed\
    \ by titanic cedars which have gone unpruned for a generation. No pruning, nor\
    \ any sort of gardening activity whatsoever, has taken place at Plunkett Hall\
    \ since it fell into the hands of Tadaaki Van Dongelbraacke, the half Japanese,\
    \ half Dutch kleptomaniac stamp collector, who bought it for a token shilling\
    \ in 1966.\nVan Dongelbraacke chanced upon a mezzotint of the pipistrelle pursuivant\
    \ in a shabby gift shop in O'Houlihan's Wharf, where it was used as scrap paper\
    \ to wrap up a gewgaw that took his fancy. In the unheated rumpus room of the\
    \ stately home, the philatelist, accompanied by his lanky companion Raoul, examined\
    \ his purchase.\n\u201CWhat do you think of my new gewgaw, Raoul?\u201D asked\
    \ Van Dongelbraacke.\nRaoul was a man of exquisite aesthetic sensibilities, which\
    \ first became evident when, at the age of six, he fell into a neurasthenic swoon\
    \ while listening to the first Blodwyn Pig album. A huge dosage of Baxter's Revivifying\
    \ Brain Salts was required to steady his nerves once he regained consciousness,\
    \ but thereafter Raoul was treated as a flawless arbiter of taste. Thus, Tadaaki\
    \ Van Dongelbraacke reacted to his pal's judgement with punctilio.\n\u201CThe\
    \ gewgaw is a worthless piece of trash,\u201D pronounced the frail beanpole, \u201C\
    But the paper in which it is wrapped is gorgeous, so much so that a mere glance\
    \ at the mezzotint of the heraldic bat and I feel my nerves juddering as if I\
    \ may swoon at any moment.\u201D\nInstantly, Van Dongelbraacke smashed the gewgaw\
    \ into a million pieces with a big fat hammer, and resolved to blazon copies of\
    \ the pipistrelle pursuivant from every cranny of his domain. And so it came to\
    \ pass. Raoul, of course, confronted wherever he looked with the image of the\
    \ superb bat, was in a constant state of enervated fragility, regularly wolfing\
    \ down bowls of mashed potatoes to try to keep his strength up. But inevitably,\
    \ he faded away, a puny weakling confined to his bed, while Van Dongelbraacke\
    \ paced the corridors of his magnificent home, biting his fingernails and tootling\
    \ dirges on his recorder.\nHold that image in your head, dear reader, for we shall\
    \ return to it at a later date."
