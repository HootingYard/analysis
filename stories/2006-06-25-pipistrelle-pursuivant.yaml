  text: 'The pipistrelle pursuivant is a heraldic bat, usually golden and black, but
    sometimes red. It appears on shields, flags, and banners, visible when the banners
    are unfurled but hidden when they are furled. In its furled state, the bat is
    known as a clandestine pipistrelle pursuivant.

    You will have seen this decorative bat if you have ever visited the bleak and
    crumbling stately home you pass if you are cycling between Pointy Town and O''Houlihan''s
    Wharf. It is easy to miss it, as the house is set in vast overgrown grounds and
    the grounds are ringed by titanic cedars which have gone unpruned for a generation.
    No pruning, nor any sort of gardening activity whatsoever, has taken place at
    Plunkett Hall since it fell into the hands of Tadaaki Van Dongelbraacke, the half
    Japanese, half Dutch kleptomaniac stamp collector, who bought it for a token shilling
    in 1966.

    Van Dongelbraacke chanced upon a mezzotint of the pipistrelle pursuivant in a
    shabby gift shop in O''Houlihan''s Wharf, where it was used as scrap paper to
    wrap up a gewgaw that took his fancy. In the unheated rumpus room of the stately
    home, the philatelist, accompanied by his lanky companion Raoul, examined his
    purchase.

    "What do you think of my new gewgaw, Raoul?" asked Van Dongelbraacke.

    Raoul was a man of exquisite aesthetic sensibilities, which first became evident
    when, at the age of six, he fell into a neurasthenic swoon while listening to
    the first Blodwyn Pig album. A huge dosage of Baxter''s Revivifying Brain Salts
    was required to steady his nerves once he regained consciousness, but thereafter
    Raoul was treated as a flawless arbiter of taste. Thus, Tadaaki Van Dongelbraacke
    reacted to his pal''s judgement with punctilio.

    "The gewgaw is a worthless piece of trash," pronounced the frail beanpole, "But
    the paper in which it is wrapped is gorgeous, so much so that a mere glance at
    the mezzotint of the heraldic bat and I feel my nerves juddering as if I may swoon
    at any moment."

    Instantly, Van Dongelbraacke smashed the gewgaw into a million pieces with a big
    fat hammer, and resolved to blazon copies of the pipistrelle pursuivant from every
    cranny of his domain. And so it came to pass. Raoul, of course, confronted wherever
    he looked with the image of the superb bat, was in a constant state of enervated
    fragility, regularly wolfing down bowls of mashed potatoes to try to keep his
    strength up. But inevitably, he faded away, a puny weakling confined to his bed,
    while Van Dongelbraacke paced the corridors of his magnificent home, biting his
    fingernails and tootling dirges on his recorder.

    Hold that image in your head, dear reader, for we shall return to it at a later
    date.'
