  text: 'Those of you who have read H P Lovecraft will be familiar with the mad Arab
    Abdul Al-hazred, author of the Necronomicon, that forbidden and blasphemous tome
    which is, thankfully, under lock and key. Lovecraft is fond of alluding to Al-hazred,
    but one cannot help but regret that he paid no attention to other notable mad
    Arabs. Nowhere in the canon, for example, is there any mention of the mad crooning
    Arab, Abdul Al-bowlly, who died in the Blitz, nor of the diminutive mad acting
    Arab, Abdul Al-anladd, who stood on a crate so he would look taller, on screen,
    than his co-star Veronica Lake.

    Then there is the mad retired footballer Arab, Abdul Al-anshearer, currently appearing
    on the BBC as a rather dull World Cup pundit. Lovecraft has nothing to say about
    him, and nor does he find room in his many stories for the late mad right wing
    Conservative MP and diarist Arab Abdul Al-anclark. Indeed it has been left to
    another crooner, Paul Simon, to draw attention to one of the neglected mad Arabs.
    Simon, one-time colleague of actor, poet, singer, wild frizzy hair pioneer, intellectual
    and general Renaissance man Arthur Garfunkel, had a hit record with his paean
    to fictional mad television chat show host Arab, You Can Call Me Al-anpartridge.

    If you know of any other mad Arabs never referred to by H P Lovecraft, please
    submit their names to the Hooting Yard Mad Arab Database.


    Mad crooning Arab Al-bowlly. Lovecraft does not mention him.'
