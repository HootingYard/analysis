  text: 'On Sunday this page was graced with an illustration from The Adventures Of
    The Men With Whisks (see below). Quite a few readers had their memories stirred
    by the picture of a stray peasant being bashed on the head with whisks, taken
    from The Men With Whisks Set Upon The Peasantry In A Whirling Tangle Of Violence
    (1952), once one of the most popular of this seemingly forgotten series of children''s
    books.

    Ruth Pastry, for example, wrote in to say: "Thank you so much for reviving my
    memories of The Adventures Of The Men With Whisks. When I was a tiny tot I had
    an almost complete set of these wonderful books, and seldom did I fall asleep
    at night without having one read to me by my mother or my father or, if they were
    indisposed, by the family factotum, Igor. My favourite volume was The Men With
    Whisks Are Attacked By A Giant Invisible Squirrel With Blood-Soaked Fangs, and
    I particularly treasured the scene where they cower in a spinney, trying desperately
    to scrape from their whisks the rust with which their utensils have become unaccountably
    caked."

    Dr Pastry goes on at length about the psychological impact of The Men With Whisks
    upon her infantile brain, but the rest of her letter is riddled with incomprehensible
    jargon, misplaced punctuation marks, and some sort of grotesque spillage, so I
    shall not reproduce it here.

    There were over thirty books in the series, all but the last two written and illustrated
    by Pabstus Tack. The manuscript of what would have been his final adventure, The
    Men With Whisks Visit A Toothpaste Factory, perished with him in the Munich Air
    Disaster of 1958. Although his satchel was recovered from the wreckage, its contents
    had been destroyed. For many years a rumour circulated that the lost story had
    been memorised by the Manchester United manager Matt Busby, who survived the crash.
    Busby became adept at deflecting questions related to The Men With Whisks, much
    as, in later years, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
    always refused to confirm or deny that he had been abducted by aliens, no matter
    how hard he was pressed by zonk-eyed conspiracy theorists.

    It is certainly not the case that the last two books, The Men With Whisks Tuck
    Into A Slap-Up Dinner Of Cocktail Sausages And Potato Pie, and The Men With Whisks
    Beat Benfica 4-1 In The European Cup Final, were written by Busby himself under
    the pseudonym Geraldine Scroonhoonpooge. Forensic examination of the manuscripts
    put paid to this absurd theory, as did an affidavit signed by Ms Scroonhoonpooge
    herself attesting that she had been visited during her sleep by the spirit of
    Pabstus Tack, who dictated the stories to her in an ethereal monotone. These last
    two volumes are, of course, unillustrated.

    Every single one of The Adventures Of The Men With Whisks is now out of print,
    yet there are many, like Dr Ruth Pastry, who remember them with fondness. Surely
    the time is ripe for a revival? In our post-literate age, maybe it will take the
    imprimatur of a Hollywood adaptation to spark the interest of a new generation.
    So, if you have any battered old copies of the books in your attic, dig them out,
    photocopy them, and send the copies to Kevin Costner.'
