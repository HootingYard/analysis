  text: "\u201CThe wind was howling like a thousand banshees with ulcerated teeth,\
    \ lashing the tall, somber cedars, which lined the Milsted driveway, till they\
    \ bent almost double before its force, and hurling sheets of mingled snow and\
    \ sleet against the house walls and window panes. The entire north wall of the\
    \ Milsted mansion was encrusted with storm-castings as the Professor, muffled\
    \ to the eyes in his motoring coat and with his fur cap pulled well over his ears,\
    \ forced his way through the tempest to the spot beneath the library window.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Seabury Quinn, The Monkey God"
