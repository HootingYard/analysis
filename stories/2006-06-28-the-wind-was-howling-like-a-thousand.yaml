  text: '"The wind was howling like a thousand banshees with ulcerated teeth, lashing
    the tall, somber cedars, which lined the Milsted driveway, till they bent almost
    double before its force, and hurling sheets of mingled snow and sleet against
    the house walls and window panes. The entire north wall of the Milsted mansion
    was encrusted with storm-castings as the Professor, muffled to the eyes in his
    motoring coat and with his fur cap pulled well over his ears, forced his way through
    the tempest to the spot beneath the library window." -- Seabury Quinn, The Monkey
    God'
