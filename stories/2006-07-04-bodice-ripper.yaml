  text: 'His name was Ned and he was a cad and a rascal. Given half a chance, he would
    rip a bodice while flashing his wolfish teeth. Ned had not got the hang of correct
    bodice-ripping, however, for he failed to understand that the bodices he ripped
    were meant to have fey damsels inside them. Ned simply headed for the nearest
    bodice warehouse, jemmied the lock, and, once inside, ripped all the bodices stored
    there by whichever needleworkers had made them. This made Ned hugely unpopular
    with the bodice-makers, and they ran him out of town.

    So Ned found himself sat on a stone in the middle of a field, all rustic and rural.
    Here there seemed little opportunity for him to be caddish or rascally. There
    was not a bodice in sight, only some cows and a few hens and a pigsty down the
    way. Ned was disconsolate.

    What he needed was a picaresque adventure. But such rollicking antics were not
    to be found in Tantarabim in days of yore, so Ned shredded cabbage instead. Whether
    or not you are fond of coleslaw, you have Ned to thank for its presence on your
    plate, or in your bowl, next to the cold mashed potatoes and the jumbo size sausages,
    as you sit in the canteen of your 26th century spaceship hurtling towards the
    weirdly crumpled planet where your destiny awaits.'
