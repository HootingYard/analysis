  text: "\u201COnce, in passing through my chamber, my attention was so strongly fixed\
    \ on an absent person that I was not only vividly conscious of his form, but also\
    \ of his voice and gestures, so that I was amazed by the lively image brought\
    \ before me. I could adduce other instances from my own experience and that of\
    \ others to show that in a waking and altogether normal state we may believe in\
    \ the reality of the image as we do in dreams. This vivid and momentary realization\
    \ of images is very common in the lower classes.\u201D \u2014 Tito Vignoli, Myth\
    \ And Science"
