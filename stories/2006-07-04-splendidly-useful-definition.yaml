  text: "Regular readers will have gathered that the bulk of the prose in Hooting\
    \ Yard is the result of many, many hours of painstaking research. Before writing\
    \ Pipistrelle Pursuivant, for example\u2014see below, 25th June\u2014I needed\
    \ to know a lot more about heraldic bats than I did when I woke up that morning.\
    \ Indeed, I had much to learn about bats, and even more about heraldry. To gain\
    \ a precarious foothold in the latter, one of my sources was Pimbley's Dictionary\
    \ of Heraldry. I must say, having read it in full, that this is the very model\
    \ of what a dictionary can be. Seldom have I found such a rigorous approach to\
    \ the act of definition. Pimbley's are clear, succinct, and remarkable. Take this,\
    \ as just one example: there you are, thumbing through your heraldic dictionary,\
    \ wanting\u2014even needing\u2014to know what is meant by the phrase \u2018Barry\
    \ bendy dexter and sinister\u2019. Pimbley defines it as \u2018a combination of\
    \ barry and bendy dexter and sinister\u2019. Isn't that perfect? You close the\
    \ book, thump your fist on your escritoire, and furrow your brow, older and wiser\
    \ than you were but a minute ago.\n"
