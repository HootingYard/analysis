  text: 'Regular readers will have gathered that the bulk of the prose in Hooting
    Yard is the result of many, many hours of painstaking research. Before writing
    Pipistrelle Pursuivant, for example--see below, 25th June--I needed to know a
    lot more about heraldic bats than I did when I woke up that morning. Indeed, I
    had much to learn about bats, and even more about heraldry. To gain a precarious
    foothold in the latter, one of my sources was Pimbley''s Dictionary of Heraldry.
    I must say, having read it in full, that this is the very model of what a dictionary
    can be. Seldom have I found such a rigorous approach to the act of definition.
    Pimbley''s are clear, succinct, and remarkable. Take this, as just one example:
    there you are, thumbing through your heraldic dictionary, wanting--even needing--to
    know what is meant by the phrase ''Barry bendy dexter and sinister''. Pimbley
    defines it as ''a combination of barry and bendy dexter and sinister''. Isn''t
    that perfect? You close the book, thump your fist on your escritoire, and furrow
    your brow, older and wiser than you were but a minute ago.
