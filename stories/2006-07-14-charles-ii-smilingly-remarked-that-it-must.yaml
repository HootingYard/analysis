  text: '"[Charles II] smilingly remarked that it must surely have been his own fault
    that he did not come back sooner, for he saw no one who did not protest that he
    had always longed for his return. One Dobson, a miller at Charlton, in Kent, burnt
    his windmill as a bonfire for joy." -- Professor Meikeljohn, The History Of England
    And Great Britain (Thanks, Max)'
