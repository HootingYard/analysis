story:

  text: 'It was blue, it rotated, and it smelled of birds. The blue was cerulean,
    the rotation was slow and juddery. It was a general sort of bird smell, one could
    not with any certainty say ''ostrich!'' or ''guillemot!'', much as one might wish
    to. That slow, juddery rotation was accompanied by a very faint clanking noise,
    so faint that a passer-by, huffing and puffing up the hill, might think he imagined
    it, as he reached the top, put down his bag, and lit his pipe, perplexity furrowing
    his forehead as he puffed on the savagely bitter cheap Serbian tobacco, the flesh
    around his piggy eyes crinkling. If moles or other burrowing creatures had created
    a temporary tussock on the hilltop, the passer-by might sit on it a while to rest
    his legs, perhaps take off his big boots and socks, and pick in a desultory way
    at the sock wool before examining his feet with greater diligence. Flesh the colour
    of curd, little red sores on his toes, but his eyes would be drawn to that cerulean
    blue, and he would forget his feet. His socks were blue, too, but that was just
    a coincidence. His boots were dappled and dun, like a cow''s colouring might be,
    in a land where there were cows to be seen, unlike this land.

    If fog came down and swirled about our passer-by, he would be reluctant to move.
    With his piggy-eyed vision occluded, that clanking noise would seem less faint,
    as his hearing grew sharper. Perhaps, too, once he had tapped out his pipe on
    a stone and the last wisps of the acrid Serbian smoke dispersed, he would become
    aware of the smell of birds, where there were no birds'' nests.

    At the bottom of the hill there is a sordid tavern where miscreants and ne''er-do-wells
    plot acts of the utmost fiendishness, and cackle as they do so. The tavern''s
    walls are trimmed with gimp passementerie. It is Shrove Tuesday, so pancakes are
    being served. Unfortunately, the pancakes have been made with contaminated flour,
    and in days to come this scene will be referred to as The Mass Poisoning Horror
    Of Cackpod, Cackpod being the name of the village at the bottom of the hill, or
    one of its names, for it has others, in other tongues, this being a country of
    ten different languages, some of them spoken by only a smattering of citizens,
    and that smattering in its collective dotage.

    Our traveller, with his foul pipe tobacco, is not in his dotage, and he crashes
    excitedly through the tavern door, having scurried down the hillside at the first
    hint of the fog lifting. There is something in his manner that suggests he is
    unused to the company of ruffians. There is a throbbing in his pituitary gland
    and beads of sweat upon his brow. He has of course put back on his socks and boots,
    and tucked his pipe into the breast pocket of his Austrian Postal Service jacket.
    Standing at the bar of this repulsive tavern, he asks the landlady for a refreshing,
    minty potage, with foam on top. He is thinking about cerulean blue, juddery rotation,
    and the smell of birds, and in his frazzled mind he is swept back to that day
    years and years ago when he danced a fandangoid hoocha with a floozie who wore
    a cerulean blue frock and span around like a wild thing as she danced, and though
    she did not smell of birds she had something of the look of a crow, bright black
    eyes and a corvine nose, and, yes, her hat was made of feathers, was it not?

    The ne''er-do-wells ignore the newcomer, for they are too busy gobbling down the
    poisoned pancakes which, within hours, will find them writhing and groaning in
    the sawdust of the tavern floor. Emboldened by the first few sips of his foamy
    potation, however, the traveller asks the landlady, "I say, what is that thing
    on top of yon hill, that blue rotating thing that smells of birds?"

    His voice is loud, and resounds in the stifling fug of the tavern, and there is
    a sudden silence. The landlady busies herself, pointedly polishing a tankard with
    a rag. Every single rapscallion stops chewing on his pancake. A dog that had been
    curled asleep at the foot of the pianola gets to its feet and pads slowly out
    of sight into a dark back room. The clock above the bar stops ticking. All is
    still, and silent, and heavy with menace.

    Eventually--it seems as if hours have passed--the ancient dog reappears, and lies
    down in the doorway. The sounds of chewing and munching and clinking tankards
    start up again. The landlady flings her rag on to the floor and dishes up more
    plates piled with pancakes. Queasily aware that he has said something untoward,
    the traveller slurps down his potage and takes his leave, edging past the sleeping
    hound. He does not know that within hours all the pancake eaters will be dead
    and gone, that the dog is tormented by nightmares, that the tavern will be condemned
    and fall to ruin.

    He steps outside. The sky is black. He peers with piggy eyes up to the top of
    the hill, but the blue rotating thing that smells of birds is engulfed in darkness
    and no longer visible. He turns to trudge towards Cackpod railway station. The
    image of that floozie flickers before him, and now he remembers how she winched
    him onto a ship from the rock where he had been abandoned for forty days, and
    how they danced and danced the tarantella, and how her frock was blue, and how
    she span, and how as midnight struck on the tavern clock she turned into a crow.'
