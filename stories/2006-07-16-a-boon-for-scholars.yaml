    has kindly provided the technologically hopeless ingrates at Haemoglobin Towers
    with a Hooting Yard search facility, which you will have noted above. Harnessing
    the mighty power of the Dobson(tm) search engine, those zonk-eyed boffins at Google(tm)
    came up with an [insert mumbo jumbo] which allows you, my dear readers, to cut
    through all the twaddle and home in on precisely the information you require as
    you study for your doctorate in Hooting Yard studies.

    That scalliwag Pansy Cradledew has already put this amazing new feature to the
    test. She writes: I have long been of the opinion that 99% of Hooting Yard is
    the sort of drivel I can well do without. Imagine my delight, then, to find that
    I can pinpoint with unerring accuracy all mentions of Little Severin the Mystic
    Badger, about whom I am writing a monograph.

    In keeping with this new gung ho approach, I have added to the top of the page
    an at-a-glance note of the date of the most recent update. What will we think
    of next?'
