  text: 'Episodes one to five of our exciting serial story Testimony Of A Tundist
    appeared between 29 April and 14 May. Due to stupidity, the continuation of this
    unbearably exciting yarn had to be postponed. Now at long last we are ready to
    proceed. Herewith, then, episode six...

    Owls done with, I was ready to begin the second, more rigorous stage of my pretundistship.
    On a March morning frightful with gales, Plankton Chews collected me from my room
    and took me to an abandoned quarry. Planting me in the midst of the ghostly landscape
    rife with broken rocks, he took out from his pocket and held before me on the
    open palm of his left hand a beetle. It had an astonishing number of legs, and
    appeared to be sickly. We remained thus for over an hour: see Binder, chapter
    ninety two.

    At this point in my memoir I am twenty four years old. A further two years will
    pass before I become a Tundist proper. I have set out to tell you something of
    myself, and how I was impelled to wear the Vest. That task is more or less done.
    I could regale you with further details of my studies, but you would begin to
    yawn, and flip impatiently through the pages looking for the exciting scene where
    I attend my first Tundist dandelion and burdock tasting.Instead, I wish to leap
    forward two decades. Twice, I think, I have mentioned that during my forties I
    was confined to a dungeon for a half dozen years. Strictly speaking the circumstances
    which led to that disaster are unrelated to Tundism, but I hope I will not be
    trying your patience if I devote my remaining paragraphs to them.

    My mentor Plankton Chews was a dedicated and faultless Tundist, one of the few
    to have passed the Tundist and Strob Noun Test at the first attempt. As a detective,
    however, he was unbelievably incompetent. Whenever I think about his career as
    a "solver[!] of those singular mysteries which perplexed the best minds of the
    professional police force" my jaw drops, and my brain is dizened. (The quotation,
    by the by, is from Dr Boilbag, slavish chronicler of every last deductive stupidity
    committed by Chews. For a long time I thought that the doctor embroidered, embellished,
    even knowingly distorted his fatuous recollections of Chews'' "exploits". Harsh
    experience taught me that the credulous Boilbag was an even greater fool than
    his idol.)

    The "singular case" that resulted in my imprisonment is recounted in The Ratiocinative
    Genius Of Plankton Chews (Pigbath & Spew, 19--), the seventh volume of Boilbag''s
    ridiculous series, where it appears under the title "The Strange Affair Of The
    Undigested Turnip". Simpleminded readers likely to be convinced by Boilbag''s
    version should stop reading now, and throw this book into a furnace: there. Now,
    I trust that those of you still with me will give more credence to my narrative
    than to Boilbag''s asinine pratings.

    It was March again, the March of my forty third birthday. I was a Tundist of long
    standing, proudly wearing the Vest, and making my living at the time by playing
    bongos and celeste in the dance band of the Bodger''s Spinney Hotel. I had not
    seen Chews for, oh, ten years. He had been a tireless and astute mentor, and even
    today I have to acknowledge that without him I may have reached the age of thirty,
    forty, perhaps even seventy before I was worthy of my Tundist Vest. My Tundism
    was nurtured by Chews, and his rigour, gusto, and sprightliness still shape the
    Tundist I am today, in my ninetieth year. He was there to rehearse me through
    the Noun Test. He was there when I sewed the string on to my punnet. He mussed
    my hair when I successfully located the wafers. When, at last, I donned the Vest,
    it was Chews who cooked the pie. And in the first few years of my Tundism, he
    was there as a prop, an ear, a rudder. Then I moved to Bodger''s Spinney, and
    he was called to a distant land. We exchanged letters for a year or two, then
    cards on Tundist gala-days, then silence. I was busy with bongo practice, he with
    goodness knows what absurdities.
