  text: "\u201CThe poetry is drugged, and as we read [Francis Thompson's] poems through\
    \ in the order of their publication, we feel the power of the poppy more and more.\
    \ At last the hand seems to lose its power and the will its control, though in\
    \ flashes of sheer flame the imagination shows wild and beautiful as ever. His\
    \ gorgeousness is beyond that of the Orient. The eccentric and arresting words\
    \ that constantly amaze the ear, bring with them a sense of things occult yet\
    \ dazzling, as if we were assisting at some mystic rite, in a ritual which demanded\
    \ language choice and strange.\u201D \u2014 John Kelman, Among Famous Books"
