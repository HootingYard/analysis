  text: "A haggard, wizened old man, impossibly ancient, creaks across the stage,\
    \ barely able to support himself on his battered crutches, which give off a powerful\
    \ stench of linseed oil and dubbin. One of his eyes is dull, even dead. The other\
    \ gleams with ferocity. The lights dim, and he crumples to the floor. Curtain.\n\
    This is, of course, the end of I Was Puny Vercingetorix, a play forever associated\
    \ with the great child Method actor Tad Wensleydale. Some still find it hard to\
    \ credit that a tiny tot of six could be so convincing as the one hundred and\
    \ forty year old antihero.\nBut whatever happened to Tad? Did he, like so many\
    \ child actors, succumb to booze and pills before taking up an important post\
    \ in the diplomatic service or the United Nations? Did he attempt to revitalise\
    \ his acting career later in life by accepting cameo roles in witless films? Did\
    \ he get a ghost to write a confessional autobiography freighted with implausible\
    \ scenes of childhood misery?\nTad did none of these things. It is well known\
    \ that he retired from stage and screen at the age of nine, after his barnstorming\
    \ appearance as the demimondaine flapper in The Barn In The Storm, an award-winning\
    \ drama about an old barn reduced to matchwood after being engulfed by a violent\
    \ storm. As he took his umpteenth curtain call, the diminutive thespian announced\
    \ that he would never appear in public again, and swept melodramatically off the\
    \ stage. And indeed, it was as if he had vanished forevermore. As days turned\
    \ to weeks turned to years with not a jot of news of the mighty stage-mite, so\
    \ inevitably did speculative stories begin to circulate.\nIt was said that Tad\
    \ had become a full-time Buzz Aldrin impersonator, in a scheme cooked up by the\
    \ astronaut himself, a rumour regularly scotched by Aldrin, who socked more than\
    \ one inquiring busybody on the jaw. Another tale had Tad grown mad and bad, filleting\
    \ his foes with a shiv in a dive, a master of disguise with murderous eyes and\
    \ mustard breath. Some said he had fallen in with goblins, and lived among them\
    \ as their King, in a sort of goblin-pod, now underground, now high in the sky,\
    \ but this was clearly codswallop.\nThe truth was more prosaic. Tad changed his\
    \ name to Gussie Ditch, opened a pie shop in Pang Hill, and lived out the rest\
    \ of his days baking and selling Pang Hill pies to the pie-eating people of Pang\
    \ Hill. It was an unremarkable and irreproachable life, banal even, a life filled\
    \ with pies and pie-fillings. Tad\u2014or Gussie\u2014rarely alluded to the meteor\
    \ that was those first nine years, an infant actorly glory comparable only to\
    \ the career of William Betty, \u201Cthe Young Roscius\u201D, whose grave in Highgate\
    \ Cemetery is now sadly overgrown.\nTad Wensleydale's own tomb, on which a solitary\
    \ chaffinch is always perched, is, as he wished, a \u201Cbaroque excrescence in\
    \ questionable taste\u201D, in the words of his own last will and testament, a\
    \ remarkable document baked in pastry letters, filled with raspberry jam and lemon\
    \ curd, and put into a pie.\n\nWilliam Betty(1791-1874), the proto-Tad, \u201C\
    not yet mature, but matchless\u201D, a \u201CBritish tragedian with feeling and\
    \ propriety, he astonishes the judicious observers of human nature\u201D."
