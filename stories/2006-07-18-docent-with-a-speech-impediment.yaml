  text: "When I was young, and they packed me off to school, and they taught me how\
    \ to begin prose pieces with quotations from Jethro Tull songs*, I came under\
    \ the spell of a remarkable docent. He was a shrivelled, partly collapsed person\
    \ with hair the colour of a gorgeous sunset over the Serengeti\u2014I think he\
    \ used dye\u2014and his bloodless lips were always puckered. He wore ill-fitting\
    \ suits woven from the wool of rare goats, eschewed spectacles in favour of some\
    \ floor-mounted light-reflecting contraption of many mirrors and lenses, and never\
    \ varied in his lunchtime preferences, which were pie-related and frankly unspeakable.\
    \ Sometimes he sported a moustache. Sometimes, when his duty was to clang bells,\
    \ he clanged bells with a vigour which belied his frail health. For this docent\
    \ was in fact clinging to life by a straw, had we but known it.\nHe was the finest\
    \ teacher I ever had, and yet I never understood a word he said, for he had a\
    \ jarring speech impediment. A fuse in his head had snapped, I think, so that\
    \ somewhere between his brain and his mouth perfectly sensible words were turned\
    \ into gibberish.\n\u201CGnaar snad poot horbungo!!\u201D he might say, or \u201C\
    Nuuurg\u2026 gaa! \u2026 pipitpipitpipit cruntuntun,\u201D for example. Sometimes\
    \ it was as if he was reciting a list of monstrous beings from the works of H\
    \ P Lovecraft. \u201CGlub glub glub,\u201D he would mutter, \u201CAzathoth! Nyarlothep!\
    \ Shoggoth! Asenath Waite!\u201D. If he entered the classroom with a sickly pallor,\
    \ you could almost guarantee that the only sound to issue forth would be a low,\
    \ growled, monotonous \u201Cgoonhoooooon\u2026 goonhoooooon\u2026. goonhoooooon\u201D\
    .\nIt was never entirely clear to me whether the docent realised that when he\
    \ thought he was saying, \u201CLet us now examine in formidable detail the film\
    \ career of Hedy Lamarr\u201D, what his listeners heard was \u201CDurgon. Podcast.\
    \ Gummo gummo. Phnag!\u201D\nIn a sense, it doesn't matter. What made him such\
    \ a superb educator were the diagrams he would chalk on the blackboard as he gibbered,\
    \ majestic, sweeping concatenations of lines and arcs and shapes and colours and\
    \ arrows and letters and numbers and boxes and circles and triangles and cross-hatching\
    \ and dots and dashes and angles and planes and squiggles and tonybuzanities,\
    \ fearsomely complicated yet at the same time explaining every last spark of human\
    \ thought to a room full of tinies like myself. What a wonder he was.\nHe only\
    \ taught at the school for a week, and then he was gone. It was said by some that\
    \ he was poached by the Hungarian football club Honved, where he wielded the magic\
    \ sponge and taught legendary striker Ferenc Puskas everything he knew. Others\
    \ claimed that the docent, like Sherlock Holmes, devoted his final years to beekeeping.\
    \ As for me, whenever I look at the Zapruder Footage, there seems to be something\
    \ very, very familiar about Umbrella Man\u2026\n\nRight : Umbrella Man. Left :\
    \ Fish Farm Man.\n*NOTE : \u201CWind Up\u201D, from Aqualung (1971), words and\
    \ music by noted fish farm proprietor Ian Anderson."
