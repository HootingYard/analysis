  text: "Here is the final instalment of our thrilling serial.\nThe March, then, of\
    \ my forty third birthday. On the first Monday in the month, in the windy afternoon,\
    \ a youngster in the full flush of his hobbledehoyhood rang the bell of an imposing\
    \ house in Blister Lane, a hundred yards from the Bodger's Spinney Hotel. The\
    \ lad picked his nose while he waited. No one answering, and noting that the door\
    \ was ajar, he crept inside, roaming cautiously through the hallway, the parlour,\
    \ the ping pong room, and the larders, thinking he might find some theftworthy\
    \ item in what appeared to be a deserted household. Tiptoe, he went from pantry\
    \ to washroom; opened a creaking door and entered a large lounge, in which he\
    \ was amazed to find a display of objects which his tatterdemalion brain could\
    \ not quite grasp: a quartz wigwam; eggs of rubber tied by a thong to a yolk;\
    \ an urn upon an ingot of ochre; a punnet of aspirin; a sprig of dahlia encased\
    \ in a fluoride and gum hod; a jam-smeared khaki lozenge, zipped to a xylonite\
    \ cake; a vellum bladder; a nugget of marzipan; a metal nose on a bust of Voltaire;\
    \ a collection of x-rays depicting the zygoma of a lapdog; a kemp jupon; hyssop\
    \ germinating on a fescue drill; a siphon of ambergris; pods of onyx in an ingle;\
    \ an udder of yapp, the trophy of resurrectionists; and an embrocation made of\
    \ wax and quince. In the midst of these startling exotica, sprawled across the\
    \ carpet in a pool of his own gore, lay the corpse of the philatelist Istvan Plunkett.\n\
    The boy ran from the house to the police station. A constable ran from the police\
    \ station to the house. The constable made a telephone call. A detective ran from\
    \ an ice hockey stadium to the house. Imagine here the bluster and disappointment\
    \ of constabulary spadework. The detective rubs his chin.\n\u201CThere is only\
    \ one thing for it, constable,\u201D he mutters.\n\u201CSir?\u201D asks the constable.\n\
    \u201CTo the telephone, man!\u201D cries the detective, \u201CThis is a job for\
    \ Plankton Chews!\u201D\nChews arrived some days later, accompanied as ever by\
    \ the preposterous Dr Boilbag. After a brief visit to the police station, where\
    \ they were fed chocolate pudding by the constable, they checked in to the Bodger's\
    \ Spinney Hotel. I was carrying my bongos through the lobby, about to wheel myself\
    \ into the dancehall, when I saw the unmistakeably corvine figure of my Tundist\
    \ mentor, carefully examining a minuscule stain on the carpet.\n\u201CWhat is\
    \ it, Chews?\u201D Boilbag was asking.\n\u201CHuman saliva, my dear Boilbag,\u201D\
    \ replied the sleuth, \u201CAnd if I am not mistaken, the human in question is\
    \ a man in his mid to late sixties, rather overweight, who wears a maroon blazer,\
    \ works in a sordid insurance office, visits his dentist with alarming regularity,\
    \ subscribes to The Daily Lantern, has a dachshund named Spinach, continually\
    \ mislays his library tickets, once pondered becoming a Jesuit priest, will have\
    \ no truck with new-fangled kitchen utensils, swats energetically at flies, uses\
    \ a box camera on his sightseeing tours, and is fond of radishes. Oh, and his\
    \ wife has left him and run off to join a circus.\u201D\n\u201CBy heaven, Chews!\u201D\
    \ spluttered Boilbag, \u201CHow on earth\u2014?\u201D\n\u201CCome, come Boilbag,\
    \ you know my methods. Apply them,\u201D said Chews.\nFortunately for the reader,\
    \ it was at this point that I interrupted. Casting aside my bongos, I called across\
    \ the lobby to my mentor, overjoyed to see him. Leaving the doctor to puzzle over\
    \ his inhuman genius, Chews bounded over to me. We embraced.\n\u201CChews, Chews,\
    \ what are you doing here?\u201D I babbled.\n\u201CYour police, my dear, are idiots,\u201D\
    \ he replied, \u201CThis Plunkett business has them running around like ballbearings\
    \ on the deck of a ship in a storm. Incapable of solving the case, they had no\
    \ option but to call me in. As I wolfed down the chocolate pudding they kindly\
    \ provided for me and my assistant here\u201D \u2014 Boilbag had now joined us,\
    \ and was boswelling frantically in his notebook with a cheap biro\u2014\u201C\
    they furnished me with the details of the murder. The philatelist Plunkett had\
    \ been found, shot through the brain, in the large lounge of his high house in\
    \ Blister Lane. He had been dead for about four hours when the corpse was discovered\
    \ by an urchin bent on felony. An examination of the house yielded nothing of\
    \ consequence. Chopped up in the mortuary, the cadaver elicited on item of interest\u2014\
    an undigested turnip eked from the stomach. The police made a note of it, but\
    \ its significance eluded them. Ha! It is always thus. Halfway through their bumbling\
    \ account of the murder, I had already solved it.\u201D\n\u201CHell's teeth, Chews!\u201D\
    \ exploded Boilbag, dropping his biro, \u201CAre you saying that you know the\
    \ identity of the fiendish and merciless killer?\u201D\n\u201CCome, doctor, we\
    \ are both in possession of the facts. I have merely deduced from them the only\
    \ possible solution. You could do the same, using the ratiocinative method.\u201D\
    \nBoilbag spluttered and frothed.\n\u201CIt is a simple enough case,\u201D continued\
    \ Chews, \u201CAlthough it has one or two singular features which amuse me. Shall\
    \ we repair to the hotel bar so that I can show off over a pint of brandy?\u201D\
    \nBoilbag and I assented, and once we were sat around our table, Chews with his\
    \ brandy, the doctor with a tumbler of cranston, and me with my habitual decoction\
    \ of fuming slops, the amateur detective held forth. Oh, he went on and on and\
    \ on, with an excruciatingly tedious self-preening tidal wave of drivel. Stamp\
    \ collecting and turnips, Ecuadorian banditti, the process of digestion, a plot\
    \ to disgrace an exiled monarch\u2026 it made no sense whatsoever, but there was\
    \ the loyal Boilbag, scribbling it all down at ferocious speed.\nI had to pay\
    \ attention at the end, however. Clamping his hand on my shoulder, Chews announced\
    \ that I was the culprit, and sent Boilbag off to fetch the coppers. Minutes later,\
    \ Woolworth, Shuddery and Beerpint duly crashed into the bar, brandishing their\
    \ handcuffs and knuckledusters. I was dragged off to prison, where I stewed for\
    \ six years, until I was released following a clerical error which inadvertently\
    \ included my name in an amnesty.\nThere is no need here to protest my innocence.\
    \ Plankton Chews is dead now, and the reputation he once had is largely forgotten.\
    \ That he was a great Tundist I still avow. But I never forgave him, and I never\
    \ saw him again.\nLet that be the end. The wind is coming in, and I have work\
    \ to do."
