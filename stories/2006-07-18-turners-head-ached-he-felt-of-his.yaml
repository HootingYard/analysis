  text: "\u201CTurner's head ached. He felt of his hair. Blood was matted there. It\
    \ was cold. The injury had occured too long ago to have been caused by the plane.\
    \ Something had struck him before it came crashing through the trees. Part of\
    \ the plane wreckage burst into flames, casting an eerie glow over the marshland,\
    \ and making dancing, fantastic figures out of tree shadows. John Turner stood\
    \ up. The plane had cut a clean path through the saplings and undergrowth. Parts\
    \ of human bodies were scattered along in the narrow opening. Sawgrass was splotched\
    \ with blood. He found it possible to move now, but his feet sank ankle deep in\
    \ the mire.\u201D \u2014 Lazar Levi, Mistress Of The Undead"
