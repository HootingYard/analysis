  text: '"As I searched feebly among the unmaterial transparencies that were growing
    more and more evanescent, I saw the symbol of the little shabby figure from the
    road, staring in at the window. Amid a turmoil of strange gyrations, I caught
    a sight of him in that zinc box, huddled knees to chin like a prehistoric corpse--there
    was yet enough water left to cover him. Afterwards I floated for unrealised years
    in immensity." -- J D Beresford, Nineteen Impressions'
