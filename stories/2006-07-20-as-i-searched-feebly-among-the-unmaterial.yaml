  text: "\u201CAs I searched feebly among the unmaterial transparencies that were\
    \ growing more and more evanescent, I saw the symbol of the little shabby figure\
    \ from the road, staring in at the window. Amid a turmoil of strange gyrations,\
    \ I caught a sight of him in that zinc box, huddled knees to chin like a prehistoric\
    \ corpse\u2014there was yet enough water left to cover him. Afterwards I floated\
    \ for unrealised years in immensity.\u201D \u2014 J D Beresford, Nineteen Impressions"
