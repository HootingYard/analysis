  text: 'Who is the typical reader of Hooting Yard? This is a question I asked myself
    a few months ago, and I decided to find out. My initial thought was to do a readers''
    survey and subject the results to careful analysis, but instead I employed a so-called
    "consultant", a private detective named Zoltan Cuspidor. What attracted me to
    Zoltan was that he was cheap (he asked only that I keep him supplied with breakfast
    cereal and butchers'' pencils), indefatigable (having had his skull trepanned,
    he never needed to sleep), and a man of limitless charm (no examples provided).

    We arranged to meet in a cow-strewn field during a thunderstorm, talked for over
    an hour, and later exchanged letters, which I shall reproduce here.

    Dear Zoltan, I wrote, It was a great pleasure to meet you in a cow-strewn field
    during a thunderstorm. I am looking forward to the results of your investigation.
    I enclose some vouchers which you can take to that kiosk near the baking soda
    factory and exchange for breakfast cereal and butchers'' pencils. Let me know
    when you need to replenish your supplies.

    Dear Frank, he replied, Thank you for the vouchers. Already I have made great
    strides. I am reluctant to divulge my methods, but you should be aware that they
    are sinister, perilous, hugely complicated, troubling, fiendish, unfailingly accurate,
    and dastardly. Rest assured that not one of your readers will ever suspect that
    a clever piece of software I took the liberty of installing on your website sends
    an invisible pneumatic beam shooting out of the screen straight into their brains.
    I have much material to assess, and in fact my printer is still chugging out reams
    upon reams of neuro-data. One finding you ought to be aware of is that MindMap(r)
    wizard Tony Buzan is not the typical Hooting Yard reader. Indeed, he does not
    appear to be a Hooting Yard reader at all, an anomaly even I find perplexing,
    but I am sure I will get to the bottom of it.

    At the beginning of May, Zoltan requested another meeting, this time at an abandoned
    ice rink. The ice had melted, and knots of bracken and bindweed were spreading
    over the site.

    "There will be cows here soon," observed Zoltan, in whose beard I could see tads
    of Special K, Coco-pops and Kellogg''s cornflakes. I handed him some more vouchers.

    "I have news," he added.I was unreasonably excited by this, and began to jump
    about.

    "The pneumatic brain-beam software is clogged," said Zoltan, "It''s been completely
    clogged up for the past three weeks, and when it gets clogged the data becomes
    contaminated and useless. I knew something was wrong when I tried a test and the
    typical Hooting Yard reader profile came out as Ghanaian football hero John Pantsil.
    I know for a fact he has never read a word of the site, as he is a confirmed Proustian
    with leanings towards Widdecombe."

    "Widdecombe?" I asked. As you can imagine, I was no longer jumping about. I was
    peering into the distance, watching as a few timid cows lumbered towards us, just
    as Zoltan had predicted.

    "Ann Widdecombe, also known as Doris Karloff, the combative Conservative Member
    of Parliament and sometime novelist. Her debut, The Clematis Tree, was well-received,
    but it is not exactly what we would call a Dobsonian ubertext. Anyway, fear not!
    I shall unclog that which is clogged and press on with my invaluable work. I just
    wanted to keep you informed. And thank you for the vouchers!"

    That was the last time I saw Zoltan Cuspidor. A month later, I received another
    letter.

    Dear Frank, he wrote, Something happened when I unclogged the clogging that increased
    the effectiveness of my program in unexpected ways. That is why I am able to send
    you my definitive results so soon. You do not have just one typical reader, but
    a family of eighteen! This group is so homogenous that I cannot pluck one of them
    away from the others without bringing the whole house of cards crashing down,
    if you see what I mean. And so to my announcement. The typical Hooting Yard readers
    are a family of God-fearing Republicans from the state of Arkansas. They are Jim
    Bob and Michelle Duggar and their children Joshua, Jana, John-David, Jill, Jessa,
    Jinger, Joseph, Josiah, Joy-Anna, Jedidiah, Jeremiah, Jason, James, Justin, Jackson
    and Johannah. If you visit their website, splendidly named www.jimbob.info, I
    think you will agree that they are wholesome, toothsome and quite, quite lovely
    in every way. I was a little perturbed that they make no mention of their fanatical
    devotion to all things Hooting Yard on their site, until it occurred to me that
    even the happiest of families has a dark secret gnawing away at their vitals,
    and for the Duggars it is clearly Dobson, Blodgett, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol,
    the gods of Gaar and all your other amusing characters. My work is done, but another
    stack of breakfast cereal and butchers'' pencil vouchers wouldn''t go amiss.


    Jim Bob, Michelle, and fourteen out of sixteen children whose names begin with
    the letter J.'
