  text: "If, like me, you harbour ambitions to be a sort of 21st century Madame Blavatsky\
    \ figure, offering an all-embracing synthesis of belief systems to the credulous\
    \ and wealthy, it is worth keeping an eye on the Religion News Blog. After all,\
    \ in a god-eat-god world, you can stay one step ahead by clutching every new twitching\
    \ tendril of faith to your capacious Blavatskyesque bosom as soon as it appears.\
    \ Recent news items alert us to some must-have additions to your cult.\nSo, for\
    \ example, ensure that your sect incorporates a \u2018blot\u2019, a sacrificial\
    \ meat offering to the ancient Norse Gods as practised by adherents of Asatru.\
    \ You might also want to smash statues and tear up baptismal gowns and wedding\
    \ veils like the devotees of Creciendo En Gracia, for whom 59-year-old Puerto\
    \ Rican Jos\xE9 Luis De Jesus Miranda is Christ. Like Jesus of Nazareth, he wears\
    \ fine suits and diamond-encrusted rings, drives a 7 Series BMW, and, until recently,\
    \ lived in a 5000-square-foot Miramar home with Corinthian columns and vaulted\
    \ ceilings. He also travels with a battalion of guards who wear dark suits and\
    \ conspicuous earpieces, but the running cost of this security detail is only\
    \ about $300,000 per annum, so is completely affordable if you tithe your followers\
    \ at the appropriate level.\nMeanwhile, don't forget to co-opt Kathleen McGowan\
    \ on to the shadowy ruling council of your sect. She has read Dan Brown's preposterous\
    \ The D* V***i C*de very, very carefully, and has announced that she is a direct\
    \ descendant of the aforementioned Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. Of course,\
    \ I am too, but I try not to make a big thing of it.\n\nRight, Madame Blavatsky.\
    \ Left, the new Jesus"
