  text: '"I see the children growing up. I see the girls droop and pine in this dreary
    parsonage, where the winds nip, and the miasma from the churchyard chokes them.
    I see the handsome promising boy going to the devil--slowly at first, then by
    strides. As their hope fades from his sisters'' faces, he drinks and takes to
    opium-eating--and worse. He comes home from a short absence, wrecked in body and
    soul. After this there is no rest in the house. He sleeps in the room with that
    small, persistent father of his, and often there are sounds of horrible strugglings
    within it. And the girls lie awake, sick with fear, listening, till their ears
    grow heavy and dull, for the report of their father''s pistol." -- Arthur Quiller-Couch,
