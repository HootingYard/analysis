  text: "\u201CI see the children growing up. I see the girls droop and pine in this\
    \ dreary parsonage, where the winds nip, and the miasma from the churchyard chokes\
    \ them. I see the handsome promising boy going to the devil\u2014slowly at first,\
    \ then by strides. As their hope fades from his sisters' faces, he drinks and\
    \ takes to opium-eating\u2014and worse. He comes home from a short absence, wrecked\
    \ in body and soul. After this there is no rest in the house. He sleeps in the\
    \ room with that small, persistent father of his, and often there are sounds of\
    \ horrible strugglings within it. And the girls lie awake, sick with fear, listening,\
    \ till their ears grow heavy and dull, for the report of their father's pistol.\u201D\
    \ \u2014 Arthur Quiller-Couch, Noughts And Crosses"
