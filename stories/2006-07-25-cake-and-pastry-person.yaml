  text: 'Many, many years ago, so long ago that you were probably not yet born, there
    was a cake and pastry person who drove a van around Pang Hill and Blister Lane,
    tooting a horn in the summer afternoons, for it seemed the sun was always shining
    in those far away days. Those were times when children still bought cakes and
    pastries from a van, a big pantechnicon painted yellow and red and pink and mauve
    and black.

    It was also, of course, the time when people worshipped the hideous bat-god Fatso,
    and walked the earth in fear of his flapping wings and his shrill squeaking that
    churned up the innards and pierced the soul. Where, in other lands, the roads
    would be lined by milestones telling the distance to an important town or port,
    here there were hundreds and hundreds of huge stone carvings of Fatso, the visible
    reminder of his terrible, and terribly haphazard, power. Children were protected
    from the worst of his wrath, for Fatso the bat-god did not fully reveal himself
    until a person reached adulthood. For tinies, the stone statues were simply part
    of the landscape, like trees or kiosks or pneumatic power towers.

    Although the bat-god is forgotten today, everyone remembers the resin hoops that
    were the favourite plaything of young and old alike. I am sure you know the words
    to the old song. "We skip and frolic and loop the loops / Along Pang Hill with
    our resin hoops / We skip and frolic on Blister Lane / With our resin hoops we
    loop again." Sometimes children would play at tossing their hoops over a Fatso
    statue, giving the bat-god a necklace. Everyone knew that a hoop''s resin, once
    resting around the stone neck of the god, would begin immediately to rot, and
    that by the next morning nothing would remain but a squelchy, foul-smelling string
    of glutinous goo, drippety-dripping on to the ground, where soon vile prickly
    poisonous weeds would sprout.

    These were the roads up and down which the cake and pastry person''s van would
    trundle, slowing to a halt whenever a little crowd of tinies gathered, each child
    clutching a cake and pastry token. In an excited gaggle, the children would exchange
    their tokens for cakes and pastries, and the cake and pastry person would collect
    the tokens in his token tin, which rattled when he shook it, and shake it he did,
    to hear that pleasing rattle. He beamed at the children as he handed out his cakes
    and pastries and took their tokens and rattled his token tin, but an acute observer
    might see that the beam was a false, rictus grin, for the cake and pastry person
    was plunged in melancholy. He remembered the innocent times when he, too, had
    been able to eat cakes and pastries without a care. Now, like every adult in the
    land, his days were consumed by a desperate need to placate Fatso the hideous
    bat-god. It seemed that Fatso needed more and more tokens every day, and the cake
    and pastry person was seldom satisfied until his tin was so crammed with tokens
    that it no longer rattled. Only then could he cease driving his pantechnicon round
    and round the roads, and park by the perimeter fence of the swan sanctuary, and
    take his tin, on foot, along the lane to Fatso''s cave, and wait, with all the
    other supplicants, for night to fall and for the bat-god''s lieutenants to shimmer
    into view. When at last his turn came, he would empty the tin into the outstretched
    paws of a greedy and grasping lieutenant, and plead for benediction, but benediction
    rarely came. Tomorrow, a bigger tin, more tokens. Thus was he commanded, in the
    horrible high-pitched squeals of Fatso''s inhuman myrmidons. One by one, then,
    they would flit away with their booty into the deepest, darkest recesses of the
    cave, and the cake and pastry person and all the other hunched and sorry believers
    would traipse away, back to their huts and shacks and cabins, and try to snatch
    a few brief hours of sleep before dawn broke and they faced a new day with redoubled
    effort. As they slept, the resin hoops rotted on the statues of their bat-god,
    poisonous weeds crept and curled along the ground, and in the nurseries, under
    cover of the night, tiny children giggled with delight, happy that they had bolstered
    Fatso''s power for another day, sure in the knowledge that tomorrow would bring
    more looping the loop with their resin hoops, more sunshine, and more cakes and
    pastries from the cake and pastry person''s yellow and red and pink and mauve
    and black cake and pastry van.'
