  text: "\u201CNow, if the tuning hammer is placed upon the tuning pin with the handle\
    \ straight upward, and it is pulled backward (from the tuner) just a little, before\
    \ it is turned to the right, the tension will be increased somewhat before the\
    \ pin is turned, as this motion, slight as it may seem, pulls the pin upward enough\
    \ to draw the string through the upper bridge an infinitesimally small distance,\
    \ but enough to be perceptible to the ear. Now if the hammer were removed, the\
    \ tendency of the pin would be to yield to the pull of the string; but if the\
    \ pin is turned enough to take up such amount of string as was pulled through\
    \ the bridge, and, as it is turned, is allowed to yield downward toward the pull\
    \ of the string, it will resume its balance and the string will stand at that\
    \ pitch, provided it has been \u201Crendered\u201D properly over the bridges.\
    \ We set forth these details that you may have a thorough understanding of what\
    \ is meant by setting the pins, and while it is not always advisable to follow\
    \ this method in tuning, there are some pianos that will stand more satisfactorily\
    \ when treated in this way.\u201C\u2014J Cree Fischer, Piano Tuning"
