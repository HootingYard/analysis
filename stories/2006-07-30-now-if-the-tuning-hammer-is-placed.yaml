  text: '"Now, if the tuning hammer is placed upon the tuning pin with the handle
    straight upward, and it is pulled backward (from the tuner) just a little, before
    it is turned to the right, the tension will be increased somewhat before the pin
    is turned, as this motion, slight as it may seem, pulls the pin upward enough
    to draw the string through the upper bridge an infinitesimally small distance,
    but enough to be perceptible to the ear. Now if the hammer were removed, the tendency
    of the pin would be to yield to the pull of the string; but if the pin is turned
    enough to take up such amount of string as was pulled through the bridge, and,
    as it is turned, is allowed to yield downward toward the pull of the string, it
    will resume its balance and the string will stand at that pitch, provided it has
    been "rendered" properly over the bridges. We set forth these details that you
    may have a thorough understanding of what is meant by setting the pins, and while
    it is not always advisable to follow this method in tuning, there are some pianos
    that will stand more satisfactorily when treated in this way."--J Cree Fischer,
