  text: "Yesterday I made passing mention of Popsy The Pig, and I have been asked\
    \ to point out that said pig is a fictional pig rather than a real, living, breathing\
    \ pig of flesh and blood. One might think this was obvious. Not so, as far as\
    \ serial Hooting Yard correspondent Dr Ruth Pastry is concerned.\nO Key! she writes,\
    \ in yet another frantically typed missive from wherever it is she lives, I have\
    \ been concerned for some time that you do not make plain what is fact and what\
    \ is fiction. We all know that educational standards are falling apart, that tinies\
    \ today are sent to \u201Ccommunity education hubs\u201D rather than schools,\
    \ and that they learn nothing because the blinkered nitwits who oversee things\
    \ are far too busy rolling out and embedding robust initiatives and driving forward\
    \ 360-degree change interfaces under the direction of a faith-based challenge\
    \ champion. These are the kind of people, remember, who see an arrow and call\
    \ it a \u201Cgraphic directional pointing emblem\u201D. Regrettable though it\
    \ is, you need to bear in mind that your future readership will need explicit\
    \ guidance to distinguish a pretend pig from a real one. To apprehend the full\
    \ import of your words, readers have to be absolutely clear what you are talking\
    \ about. It goes without saying that they need to have confidence that you know\
    \ what you're talking about in the first place. It does sometimes seem to me that\
    \ you have about as much idea about real pigs as you do about birds. In future\
    \ I suggest that you use some kind of colour coding system. Plain black text for\
    \ facts, red italics for things you have made up, and bold green type for when\
    \ you are wittering on about the many, many subjects of which you are profoundly\
    \ ignorant. That should sort the wheat from the chaff, and I suspect there will\
    \ be a huge amount of chaff. Yours in Christ, Ruth Pastry (Dr).\nEntertaining\
    \ though such rants may be, I have no intention of taking Dr Pastry's advice.\
    \ Unlike her, I respect my readers' intelligence, and I think it unlikely that\
    \ anyone would confuse the fictional Popsy-with-a-'y' The Pig and the real Popsie-with-an-'i'-and-an-'e'\
    \ The Pig. The latter pig was, of course, enstyed in the grounds of the pneumatic\
    \ power tower on the other side of the fields beyond the Big Unexplained Building\
    \ On The Hill, where it was regularly visited by Dobson, who fed it with an enticing\
    \ variety of fallen fruits and items of confectionery. Though he pretended a convincing\
    \ gruffness, Dobson had a soft spot for Popsie The Pig, who could reduce him to\
    \ tears by, for example, grunting, or wallowing in a particular patch of mud.\
    \ In the autumn of 1955, Dobson trudged across the fields to the pig sty twice\
    \ a day, his pockets filled with pig treats for Popsie.\nIt was on one such trudge,\
    \ a dawn one, as winter began to bite, that the out of print pamphleteer was accosted\
    \ by the local Inspector Of Pig, Squirrel, And Goat Food, with his pointy cap\
    \ and gleaming golden blazer buttons.\n\u201CMy name is Piccolo, and my mind is\
    \ a chaos,\u201D said this man, pointing a futuristic ray gun at Dobson's head,\
    \ \u201CAnd I am the local Inspector Of Pig, Squirrel, And Goat Food. My word\
    \ is law in these parts. Empty your pockets.\u201D\nDobson had been threatened\
    \ with ray gunsbefore, but never at dawn in the middle of a field, so reluctantly\
    \ he did as he was bid, tossing fallen fruits and items of confectionery on to\
    \ the ground. A partly-gnawed toffee apple struck the boot of the Inspector and\
    \ rolled into a ditch.\n\u201CGet into the ditch and retrieve that partly-gnawed\
    \ toffee apple,\u201D shouted the Inspector, waving his ray gun in a haphazard\
    \ way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with it. Dobson ducked and shimmied and\
    \ swiftly disarmed him, dislodged his pointy cap and pushed him into the ditch.\n\
    \u201CMy ankle is sprained,\u201D whined the Inspector.\nDobson eyed him with\
    \ contempt and picked up the fallen fruits and items of confectionery one by one.\n\
    \u201CListen to me, Inspector Of Pig, Squirrel, And Goat Food, or whoever you\
    \ are,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CI am going to continue trudging across the field\
    \ until I reach the pig sty. Then I will feed these fallen fruits and items of\
    \ confectionery to the pig known throughout this land as Popsie The Pig. That\
    \ is Popsie with an 'i' and an 'e', a real pig of flesh and blood and bone and\
    \ muscle, no mere fictional pretend pig of someone's fancy. Fictional pigs need\
    \ no feeding, Inspector, as your superiors must have made plain to you when they\
    \ handed you a requisition slip for that futuristic ray gun and sent you here.\
    \ While I am gone, eat of that partly-gnawed toffee apple, and fill in your forms.\
    \ When I return, I will fashion a makeshift stretcher out of branches and leaves,\
    \ and I will drag you across the fields to my home, and I will install you on\
    \ the sofa in the sitting room, and I will feed you with moretoffee apples, and\
    \ with soup, until your sprained ankle is sprained no more, and then you may go\
    \ on your way, armed once more with your ray gun, with your pointy cap set straight\
    \ upon your head, and your pockets stuffed with certain of my pamphlets which\
    \ you are to bring to the attention of your superiors, works in which I have addressed\
    \ in enormous detail the topic of the proper feeding of not only pigs, and squirrels,\
    \ and goats, but also cows and horses and stoats and crows and weasels and cormorants\
    \ and guillemots and badgers, both real and fictional. The overwhelming genius\
    \ of my recommendations has been ignored until now, and this has caused me anguish\
    \ that you can barely imagine from your position sprawled in a ditch with a sprained\
    \ ankle and only a partly-gnawed toffee apple for sustenance. But you will do\
    \ me this service, and by doing so your name will live forever in the hearts of\
    \ those who, from St Francis of Assisi onwards, have striven to strengthen the\
    \ links that bind us to the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and those\
    \ creatures that creep upon their bellies, and those that slither and wriggle\
    \ in the muck, the real ones and those that are fictional, like Popsy The Pig\
    \ when Popsy is spelled with a 'y'. It is you who will be remembered, Inspector,\
    \ not me, for I am but a mere out of print pamphleteer. I have no pointy cap,\
    \ as you do, nor a blazer with gleaming golden buttons, nor do I covet them. Mark\
    \ my words, and mark them well. And now I must trudge onward to the pig sty.\u201D\
    \nAlas, when Dobson returned to the ditch, the Inspector Of Pig, Squirrel, And\
    \ Goat Food had scarpered. He had only ever been a phantom from another world\
    \ and another time, and as Dobson threw the futuristic ray gun into a nearby waste\
    \ chute, he realised with a mixture of despair and disgust that his words had\
    \ been wasted, and that when he got home, as the bleak winter sun rose higher\
    \ in the sky, he would find those pamphlets which addressed in enormous detail\
    \ the proper feeding of pigs and squirrels and goats and cows and horses and stoats\
    \ and crows and weasels and cormorants and guillemots and badgers, both real and\
    \ fictional, still lying unread in the drawer of his writing desk, and he had\
    \ no one to give them to, no one to carry them away, far away, to distant buildings\
    \ in distant lands where important people made important decisions about the feeding\
    \ of Popsie The Pig and all the other creatures upon this planet that Carl Sagan\
    \ called a pale blue dot."
