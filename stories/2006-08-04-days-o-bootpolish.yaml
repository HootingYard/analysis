  text: "It was in the Days o' Bootpolish that I was banished from the palace. I had\
    \ done nothing wrong, but one Thursday morning they came for me in my cubicle\
    \ and tore the paperwork from my elegant hands and told me that I was to be banished.\
    \ I was led to a cupboard where I was told to deposit my pencils and my hats,\
    \ and then to another cupboard where there were many, many shelves stacked oh\
    \ so high with packets of nuts. They told me I could take six packets, two each\
    \ of peanuts and hazelnuts, one of pine nuts and one of brazil nuts. I was to\
    \ cram them into my pockets and pat the flaps down. It was made very clear to\
    \ me that my pockets would be rummaged through as I stepped outside the palace\
    \ to begin my banishment, and that if I had more than six packets of nuts about\
    \ my person, banishment from the palace would be the least of my worries. It was\
    \ not entirely clear to me what this meant, but it was not meant to be clear to\
    \ me, it was intended that I be stricken with terror and have my imagination run\
    \ riot at the prospect of some gruesome fate. In truth, I did not get myself into\
    \ a little flap, for I have always been law-abiding, and I had no intention of\
    \ taking more than my allotment of nuts. I have twice mentioned flaps, material\
    \ flaps and emotional flaps, and before I am through I may refer to other flaps.\
    \ We shall see.\nOnce I had packed my pockets with my six packets of nuts and\
    \ patted down the flaps, they told me to come out of the cupboard, and as soon\
    \ as I was in the corridor they slammed the cupboard door shut with such unnecessary\
    \ violence that I jumped into the air for a second. The ceiling was high enough\
    \ that I did not crack my head on it. I understood why they had instructed me\
    \ to pat down my pocket flaps, because had I not done so, one or more of the packets\
    \ of nuts may have fallen from my pockets during my inadvertent little jump. I\
    \ got the impression, waiting for their next move, that they had expected me to\
    \ jump.\nAround the corner of the corridor one of them now appeared, wheeling\
    \ a gurney. They told me to clamber on to it and to lie down on my back, and then\
    \ they strapped me to it with a series of buckled woolen belts. It was explained\
    \ to me that this was all part of the standard banishment procedure and that I\
    \ should read nothing sinister into it, so I didn't. I felt quite relaxed, staring\
    \ at the grimy yellow ceiling of the corridor as I was wheeled along. I mused\
    \ about the Days o' Bootpolish, and wondered if they were coming to an end. It\
    \ was hard to tell.\n\nFirst howler monkey\nWe arrived at a junction and turned\
    \ into another corridor. This one had a ceiling that was also yellow, but much\
    \ less grimy. After a while my gurney juddered to a stop, I was unbuckled, and\
    \ they told me to get off it and stand up. I did as I was told, and saw that I\
    \ was in a part of the palace that I had never seen before, butthis did not surprise\
    \ me, for I always knew that I was kept to only certain areas of what must have\
    \ been a tremendously large building. Now I was going to be thrown out of it altogether,\
    \ with six packets of nuts to see me on my way. I did find this all very curious,\
    \ but they showed no sign of giving me any explanation, so I kept my mouth shut.\n\
    There was a cold rush of air to my left, and I looked around and saw that a sliding\
    \ door had swooshed open, and beyond it was open air, a field, some shrivelled\
    \ vegetation, distant cows, and a magnificent blue sky. I had not seen the like\
    \ since before the Days o' Bootpolish, and for the first time since they ejected\
    \ me from my cubicle I spoke.\n\u201CGosh,\u201D I said.\nOne of them whacked\
    \ me on the windpipe with a tally stick, and I crumpled to the floor. My patted-down\
    \ pocket flaps kept my six packets of nuts safe from spillage. It took me some\
    \ while to get my breath back, and then they lifted me to my feet. I heard an\
    \ ungodly beeping noise. This was coming from a wall-panel which formed part of\
    \ the stupendously complicated palace communication system, installed at the very\
    \ beginnings of the Days o' Bootpolish, when inventions were still welcomed. I\
    \ knew it ran on electricity and pneumatics, but beyond that its workings were\
    \ a mystery to me. The beeping turned out to be a signal confirming my banishment.\
    \ They turned out my pockets, and as soon as they were satisfied that I was carrying\
    \ no more than six packets of nuts, I was shoved in the small of the back, out\
    \ into the field, and the sliding door swooshed shut behind me.\n\nSecond howler\
    \ monkey\nI walked away from the palace, in more or less a straight line, for\
    \ about an hour. Then the sky was filled suddenly with dozens of Swordfish jet\
    \ planes with military markings, dozens of planes, skitting and swooping, making\
    \ a terrible din. I clapped my elegant hands over my equally elegant ears to stifle\
    \ the racket, without much success. While I was standing there being a bit weedy,\
    \ one of the planes came into land about fifty cements away and disgorged a troop\
    \ of howler monkeys, who immediately came charging towards me, howling and howling.\
    \ They grabbed my arms and legs, lifted me off my feet, bundled me into a tarpaulin,\
    \ and carried me off towards the plane. I noticed a solitary starling in the blue\
    \ sky.\nOnce inside the plane, which took off again as soon as I had been ferried\
    \ aboard, I was tossed from the tarpaulin onto a surprisingly comfortable bunk\
    \ and injected with a serum. This gave me a splitting headache but also caused\
    \ me to begin babbling in urgent and breathless gulping sobs everything I knew\
    \ about the palace and the Days o' Bootpolish. I couldn't stop myself, even when\
    \ one of the howler monkeys passed me a tumbler of refreshing milkshake. I ended\
    \ up spitting most of it onto the floor, so desperate was I to tell everything\
    \ I could dredge up from the deepest nooks of my brain. It was all quite involuntary.\
    \ None of the howler monkeys was taking notes, in fact they did not seem particularly\
    \ interested in what I had to tell. I prattled on for at least a day, if not more,\
    \ before falling back on the bunk completely spent. They gave me some more milkshake,\
    \ and this time I drained my tumbler with lip-smacking relish. Then I fell asleep.\n\
    That was last week. This week, the howler monkeys have asked me to help them to\
    \ make a scale model of the palace out of corrugated cardboard. I will give them\
    \ what help I can. I have already given them the six packets of nuts that were\
    \ the tokens of my banishment. The Days o' Bootpolish are over now, at long last,\
    \ and I for one will not miss them. I have enough on my plate, ushering in the\
    \ Days o' Cellophane to a colony of a hundred thousand howler monkeys, learning\
    \ to howl just like them, but perhaps with a touch more elegance.\n\nThird howler\
    \ monkey"
