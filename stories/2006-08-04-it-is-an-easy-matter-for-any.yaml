  text: "\u201CIt is an easy matter for any sane man or woman to understand why an\
    \ immoral priest, and one who has no regard for honour, has such an easy task\
    \ in accomplishing the ruin of those whom he seeks to destroy. The paradise of\
    \ the priestcraft is inky darkness, as they prefer darkness to light, and by their\
    \ actions, their everyday lives take on the hue of midnight.\u201D \u2014 Bernard\
    \ Fresenborg, Thirty Years In Hell"
