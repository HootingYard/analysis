  text: '"It is an easy matter for any sane man or woman to understand why an immoral
    priest, and one who has no regard for honour, has such an easy task in accomplishing
    the ruin of those whom he seeks to destroy. The paradise of the priestcraft is
    inky darkness, as they prefer darkness to light, and by their actions, their everyday
    lives take on the hue of midnight." -- Bernard Fresenborg, Thirty Years In Hell'
