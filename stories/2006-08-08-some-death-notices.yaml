  text: 'I ran across a selection of 19th century death notices from a Michigan newspaper.
    Here are a few for your perusal:

    Thursday, May 12, 1887 Mrs. Chas. Martin, wife of a farmer living near Grand Rapids,
    poisoned herself and two of her children on the 3d, with "rough on rats."

    Thursday, May 12, 1887 A terrible accident occurred in the rolling mill of the
    Hubbard Iron company, at Hubbard, Ohio, shortly after 2 o''clock on the morning
    of the 6th. Engineer Griffith Phillipps, aged 29 years, in passing around the
    ore crusher oiling the bearings, was caught in the wheels and dragged into the
    crusher. He was mangled out of all semblance of humanity, the flesh adhering to
    the clogs. He leaves a wife and 3 children.

    Thursday, June 2, 1887 At Canton, Ohio, last week, Charles Danseizen, a bricklayer,
    went home drunk and, picking up a butcher-knife six inches long, murdered his
    wife by stabbing her in the throat. He says she drove him to the deed because
    she joined the Salvation Army.

    Thursday, November 24, 1887 It is said on the street that Miss Ida Carew, who
    mashed the patrons of the variety theatre by her song, "You can''t do it, you
    know", died at New Orleans lately.

    Saturday, April 14, 1888 Miss Metta Fordham, of Bronson, a music teacher and exceedingly
    bright young lady, died with measles. When the disease first seized her she told
    her friends she would never get well.

    Saturday, May 12, 1888 John Winter, who died recently at Grand Rapids, is alleged
    to have said with his dying breath that his wife poisoned him. The woman and her
    neighbors agree that he died of dissolute habits.'
