  text: "Apparently, the Grunty Man, that figure of childhood nightmares, has a song.\
    \ It begins:\nI grunt at the sun, I grunt at the moon, my grunts do not follow\
    \ a tune. I grunt at the stars, I grunt at the sky, my grunting makes household\
    \ pets die.\nOne day in March 1967, the Grunty Man went into a recording studio.\
    \ He was accompanied by a hand-picked gaggle of musicians who later became some\
    \ of the biggest names in prog rock, including future members of Yes, Emerson\
    \ Lake & Palmer, and Spooky Tooth. Also present was the youthful Gordon Sumner,\
    \ now known to the world as \u2018Stig\u2019 [sic], who was drafted in for his\
    \ ability to whine in a high-pitched caterwaul. I say they were hand-picked, but\
    \ in fact the Grunty Man arranged for each muso to be plucked from their mundane\
    \ doldrums by the Claw of Gack. It was an experience none of them ever forgot.\n\
    Eschewing the use of a producer or sound engineer, the Grunty Man barred and bolted\
    \ the studio doors and whirled about in a grunting frenzy until all the musicians\
    \ were suitably cowed. It would be unkind to state which of the ELP trio was so\
    \ frightened that he hid in a cupboard and piddled in his loon pants until coaxed\
    \ out with the promise of garibaldi biscuits.\nTen thousand years old and covered\
    \ in sores, the Grunty Man had recently started to use a guide dog. This dog,\
    \ Alan, was some kind of beagle, and was hopelessly inadequate for its task. It\
    \ was blind itself, in one eye, suffered from muscle spasms and liver failure,\
    \ and harboured a doggy desire to take part in the space programme rather than\
    \ have to drag around with the Grunty Man. It spent most of the recording session\
    \ curled up inside Carl Palmer's bass drum, dreaming of the stars.\nThe Grunty\
    \ Man decided to call his one-off band Ruddiman's Rudiments, after the Latin primer\
    \ used by generations of schoolchildren. With such a name, he thought, he would\
    \ not be dismissed merely as a grotesque grunting ogre from the earth's primeval\
    \ past, but as a somewhat more sophisticated being. Having a hit record would\
    \ give him even more charisma, and his long-cherished desire to win social acceptance\
    \ would be fulfilled. Perhaps he wanted too much.\nCertainly the auspices were\
    \ not good, as the band huddled in a corner of the studio quaking with terror,\
    \ Alan snoozed, and no one bothered to locate the light switches. When little\
    \ Sumner whimpered that they would need at least some light to work by, the Grunty\
    \ Man unleashed great bellows of his sulphurous, phosphorescent breath. The studio\
    \ was lit by a dim green mist which hung in the air, and the band stumbled reluctantly\
    \ to their positions.They ran through the music a few times, but never to the\
    \ Grunty Man's satisfaction.\n\u201CLess Herman's Hermits! More Scriabin!\u201D\
    \ he shouted, and as they could not understand his grunts, he clawed the words\
    \ onto the walls with his talons. But none of the band, not even the bombastically-inclined\
    \ future Emerson Lake & Palmer, were familiar with the works of the Russian composer*,\
    \ and they stuck to a toothsome sort of pop pap. The Grunty Man kept bellowing\
    \ to maintain the phosphorescent light levels. Alan woke up briefly and savaged\
    \ Carl Palmer's piddle-stained loon pants. And then a janitor arrived.\n\nThe\
    \ janitor, Old Ted Cargpan\nOld Ted Cargpan's intention was to throw the intruders\
    \ out of the studio. In the event, he saved the situation. Completely calm in\
    \ the face of the hideous Grunty Man, and contemptuous of the young musicians,\
    \ he at once sized up the scene, set the tapes running, and put the whole lot\
    \ of them through their paces. Even the Grunty Man deferred to the janitor, retreating\
    \ to a spot up in the rafters and allowing the little Sumner boy to take on the\
    \ lead vocal, while Alan the guide dog, refreshed after his nap, howled backing.The\
    \ instrumentalists, too, seemed energised by the crusty old janitor's presence,\
    \ Greg Lake in particular demonstrating the sort of skills that would, in a few\
    \ years time, make Brain Salad Surgery such a millstone. Sorry, I meant to type\
    \ \u2018milestone\u2019.\nThe track finished, Old Ted Cargpan sent the musicians\
    \ packing and brought the Grunty Man down from his perch near the ceiling to record\
    \ the B-side, a duet with Alan the guide dog. The Grunty Man grunted, Alan slobbered,\
    \ and the janitor moulded their din into a majestic three minute miniature rock\
    \ opera, subsequently plagiarised by everybody from Ultravox to swan-eating Peter\
    \ Maxwell Davies.\nSo whatever happened to the recordings? Some say that the adult\
    \ Gordon Sumner, wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice but still, as a middle-aged\
    \ man, calling himself \u2018Stig\u2019, opposed any reissue of the disc and even\
    \ had the master tapes destroyed. Another rumour has it that Alan the guide dog\
    \ somehow managed, in 1977, to get himself blasted towards Saturn on a space rocket,\
    \ and took the tapes with him. The Grunty Man himself remains silent on the subject,\
    \ merely grunting horribly in his cave, or next to his pond, haunting the nightmares\
    \ of tiny children, tuneless once more, and resigned to his immortal fate.\n*NOTE\
    \ : For more about puny neurasthenic Alexander Scriabin and his tiny hands, see\
    \ 29th January 2006."
