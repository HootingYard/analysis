  text: 'Here is a transcript of part of yesterday''s Hooting Yard On The Air radio
    show. When the podcast becomes available, I shall add a link to it.

    Regular listeners to Hooting Yard On The Air will know that I have been away for
    a couple of weeks. I wish I could say that I have been somewhere interesting--Aztec
    ruins, say, or the magic mountain, or even a chalet on the shingle beach at Pointy
    Town--but alas, I have been a pallid sickly wretch, suffering from risings in
    the spleen and the ague and black bile and the bloody flux and vapours in the
    cranial integuments. At times like these I tend to rely on the regular infusion
    of Baxter''s Terrible Fluid, or Dr Gillespie''s Vital Nerve Powders. The latter,
    sprinkled on to a plum or a conference pear, can work wonders on even the puniest
    constitution, and indeed, here I am back behind the microphone on a Wednesday
    afternoon, bringing the show to you live from the gleaming skyscraper which houses
    the ResonanceFM studio. Yes, I struggled my way through the weird pneumatic doors,
    I panted for breath as I staggered on to the moving walkway, there was a ringing
    in my ears as I slumped on the floor of the turbo-elevator which shot me to the
    top of the building in just four seconds, and I needed a bowl of energising vitamin
    soup before I could speak... but here I am, ready to provide you with half an
    hour of instructive prose to inspire your moral sentiments. Excuse me for a moment
    while I mop my still fevered brow.

    There. Now, one consequence of lying abed groaning and whimpering in the throes
    of neurasthenic horrors is a disinclination to write. Some might choose to call
    this writer''s block, or even idleness, but they know not whereof they speak.
    At least one acquaintance made this accusation in the past fortnight. As I tossed
    and turned in an agony of twitching fits, I became aware of a message on my metal
    tapping machine. Weakly, I reached for it, nearly falling from my rumpled pallet
    as I did so. And when I read the message, I was convulsed anew, as if ten thousand
    demons with ten thousand forks were pricking me ten thousand times.

    "For crying out loud, Key!" I read through my tears, "Stop being such a milquetoast
    whinger. There is nothing wrong with you that a brisk walk around the duckpond
    in a hailstorm won''t fix. Put on your boots and seize the day!"

    I tossed my metal tapping machine on to the floor among the piles of rags, and
    sobbed. Some hours later, when I had stopped sobbing, I did indeed clamber from
    my sickbed, put on my boots, and I launched myself towards the duckpond. I got
    as far as the garden gate before collapsing in a mewling heap. I shuddered and
    shook, twitching and shattered, and hideous visions swam in my brain. I knew they
    were visions, because there are no giant golden poisonous toads in this neck of
    the woods, but still... even though I sensed they were the product of my fuming
    brain, they were frightening enough, particularly the one called Graham, which
    had more eyes than you normally see on a toad, even a giant golden poisonous toad,
    and each eye was quivering on the end of a stalk, which again is untoadlike, as
    far as I know, not that I have ever made a study of the world''s toads, though
    it is on my list of Things to Do.

    Anyway, there I was, cutting the opposite of a dash, when the postie bashed his
    way through the garden gate, clonking me on the head. The hallucinatory toads
    vanished, and I sat up on the gravel, rubbing the lump that was already swelling
    where I had been clonked.

    "Oh, sorry I clonked you on the head," said the postie, "Here, I have a letter
    for you."

    Even in the most trying of circumstances, I try to be polite, so as I took the
    envelope from the postie I thanked him. He recoiled from me, as if I had screeched
    some blasphemous execration, as indeed I had, for the clonk on my head had dislodged
    some of the nerve-wirings in my brain, and for the next three days whenever I
    spoke, whatever I tried to say, I spewed forth a tirade of foulness. Luckily a
    cure was affected before I had to do this show, otherwise ResonanceFM would be
    shut down by the authorities for broadcasting disgusting language in the middle
    of a Wednesday afternoon, when innocent and sensitive ears would be appalled,
    and rightly so.

    I was able to treat the dislodged brain-wiring by myself, for though I have neglected
    to learn about the toads of the world, I do know a thing or two about the magnificent
    complexity of the human brain. I had a good teacher. Years ago I attended a two-day
    course at the Blotzmann Institute, where I learned, among other things, that if
    you immerse your head in a bucket of warm soapy water and do the Culpeper Manoeuvres
    until at the point of drowning, most of your brain problems will be solved. It
    certainly works for me.

    Now, where was I? I took the letter from the postie and crawled back into the
    house, somehow managing to hoist myself into a chair at the kitchen table. I did
    not like the look of the handwriting on the envelope. It spoke to me of theft,
    spasms, and cruelty. It spoke of moral turpitude. It spoke of rubber truncheons
    and contempt. You might ask how I could read so much into the few scribbled lines
    of my name and address, but I am not going to tell you. Instead, I am going to
    sulk while we have a short interval.

    + + +

    That''s better. I''ll get back to how I overcame what might have been writer''s
    block, or might have been something far more lethal, something almost too awful
    to contemplate, in a moment. But I want to mention that, in between recovering
    from my neurasthenic terrors and coming in to do today''s show, I went to see
    the film Snakes On A Plane. Most of the critics have--with their customary laziness--made
    a big deal of Samuel L Jackson''s line "I''m sick and tired of these beep-ing
    snakes on this beep-ing plane!", but for me there was a much better moment in
    the screenplay. One of the stewardesses enters the cockpit, where the co-pilot
    is trying to control the plane. (The captain has already been bitten by a poisonous
    snake.) She says: "What''s with the oxygen mask deploying?" Now, put yourself
    in the scene. You are that stewardess. You are wondering why all the oxygen masks
    have been released, for no apparent purpose, so you go to the cockpit to find
    out. Come on now, think yourself into the situation. What do you say, what words
    come out of your mouth? "What''s with the oxygen masks?" you might say, or at
    a push, "What''s with the oxygen mask deployment?" But "What''s with the oxygen
    mask deploying?" I think not. A great moment in a foolish but amusing film.

    + + +

    So I sat at my table, glaring at this envelope with its repellent handwriting.
    I plucked a plum from my plum bowl, sprinkled it with Dr Gillespie''s Vital Nerve
    Powders, took a bite, and glared at the envelope some more. I turned it over to
    see if there was a return address, and there was, but it was badly smudged and
    illegible. I cursed the postie. I flapped my arms, as if I were a bird, a big,
    legendary bird, like a roc. I pulled a piece of straw out of my hair. I pondered
    the implications of that anonymous 18th century suicide note which read, in its
    entirety, "All this buttoning and unbuttoning!" I couldn''t remember if there
    was an exclamation mark appended to it, so I tottered to my feet and headed for
    the bookshelves whereon nestled a dictionary of quotations. I never made it across
    the room, because as I took a few unsteady steps I was confronted by a phantom.
    It may have been a ghoul, but I think it was a phantom. It was grey and ethereal
    and shimmering and damp and cold and mournful, and it was clutching in its slender
    bloodless hand the key to a hotel room. Through some kind of ghostly thought-transference,
    it told me that the hotel it belonged to was far away, in Winnipeg, and that I
    must go there immediately. I tried a bit of thought transference myself, to explain
    that my passport had expired and that I was too sick to go to Winnipeg in any
    case, but I made a botch of it, and transferred my thoughts not to the phantom
    but to a carpet beetle near the skirting board, which was so traumatised by being
    suddenly zapped with alien thought processes that it had a heart attack and perished,
    flipping on to its back and wiggling its many, many little legs hopelessly in
    the air. Can carpet beetles have heart attacks, or did I misread the signs? Who
    knows, apart from entomologists? What I do know is that the carpet beetle was
    dead and the phantom was still looming there, reproachful and anguished. It was,
    by the way, a Dutch phantom, a Rotterdam phantom, one of the phantoms of Rotterdam.
    What was it doing in my house? Why was it imploring me to go to a hotel in Winnipeg?
    What awaited me in the hotel room? I tried to remove a sliver of plum peel that
    was caught in my teeth, without success. The Rotterdam phantom shifted suddenly,
    spine-tinglingly. Now it was behind me. I span around. The phantom was dissolving,
    slowly, but it had left the Winnipeg hotel key on the mantelpiece.

    I opened a window. From my neighbour''s house I could hear the strains of "20
    Great TV Themes" by the Dennis Drivel Accordion And Pan-Pipe Orchestra. I realised
    it was the limited edition version, including the theme from "It Shouldn''t Happen
    To A Vet". My head cleared. Everything seemed to fall into place. I had been sick,
    but now I was well. I flapped my arms again, like wings, but not like the wings
    of a legendary bird like a roc. I flapped my arms as if they were angel''s wings,
    and I was being borne to heaven, and I took the dead carpet beetle with me, for
    why should insects not share in the rapture of paradise?'
