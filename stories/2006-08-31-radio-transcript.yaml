  text: "Here is a transcript of part of yesterday's Hooting Yard On The Air radio\
    \ show. When the podcast becomes available, I shall add a link to it.\nRegular\
    \ listeners to Hooting Yard On The Air will know that I have been away for a couple\
    \ of weeks. I wish I could say that I have been somewhere interesting\u2014Aztec\
    \ ruins, say, or the magic mountain, or even a chalet on the shingle beach at\
    \ Pointy Town\u2014but alas, I have been a pallid sickly wretch, suffering from\
    \ risings in the spleen and the ague and black bile and the bloody flux and vapours\
    \ in the cranial integuments. At times like these I tend to rely on the regular\
    \ infusion of Baxter's Terrible Fluid, or Dr Gillespie's Vital Nerve Powders.\
    \ The latter, sprinkled on to a plum or a conference pear, can work wonders on\
    \ even the puniest constitution, and indeed, here I am back behind the microphone\
    \ on a Wednesday afternoon, bringing the show to you live from the gleaming skyscraper\
    \ which houses the ResonanceFM studio. Yes, I struggled my way through the weird\
    \ pneumatic doors, I panted for breath as I staggered on to the moving walkway,\
    \ there was a ringing in my ears as I slumped on the floor of the turbo-elevator\
    \ which shot me to the top of the building in just four seconds, and I needed\
    \ a bowl of energising vitamin soup before I could speak\u2026 but here I am,\
    \ ready to provide you with half an hour of instructive prose to inspire your\
    \ moral sentiments. Excuse me for a moment while I mop my still fevered brow.\n\
    There. Now, one consequence of lying abed groaning and whimpering in the throes\
    \ of neurasthenic horrors is a disinclination to write. Some might choose to call\
    \ this writer's block, or even idleness, but they know not whereof they speak.\
    \ At least one acquaintance made this accusation in the past fortnight. As I tossed\
    \ and turned in an agony of twitching fits, I became aware of a message on my\
    \ metal tapping machine. Weakly, I reached for it, nearly falling from my rumpled\
    \ pallet as I did so. And when I read the message, I was convulsed anew, as if\
    \ ten thousand demons with ten thousand forks were pricking me ten thousand times.\n\
    \u201CFor crying out loud, Key!\u201D I read through my tears, \u201CStop being\
    \ such a milquetoast whinger. There is nothing wrong with you that a brisk walk\
    \ around the duckpond in a hailstorm won't fix. Put on your boots and seize the\
    \ day!\u201D\nI tossed my metal tapping machine on to the floor among the piles\
    \ of rags, and sobbed. Some hours later, when I had stopped sobbing, I did indeed\
    \ clamber from my sickbed, put on my boots, and I launched myself towards the\
    \ duckpond. I got as far as the garden gate before collapsing in a mewling heap.\
    \ I shuddered and shook, twitching and shattered, and hideous visions swam in\
    \ my brain. I knew they were visions, because there are no giant golden poisonous\
    \ toads in this neck of the woods, but still\u2026 even though I sensed they were\
    \ the product of my fuming brain, they were frightening enough, particularly the\
    \ one called Graham, which had more eyes than you normally see on a toad, even\
    \ a giant golden poisonous toad, and each eye was quivering on the end of a stalk,\
    \ which again is untoadlike, as far as I know, not that I have ever made a study\
    \ of the world's toads, though it is on my list of Things to Do.\nAnyway, there\
    \ I was, cutting the opposite of a dash, when the postie bashed his way through\
    \ the garden gate, clonking me on the head. The hallucinatory toads vanished,\
    \ and I sat up on the gravel, rubbing the lump that was already swelling where\
    \ I had been clonked.\n\u201COh, sorry I clonked you on the head,\u201D said the\
    \ postie, \u201CHere, I have a letter for you.\u201D\nEven in the most trying\
    \ of circumstances, I try to be polite, so as I took the envelope from the postie\
    \ I thanked him. He recoiled from me, as if I had screeched some blasphemous execration,\
    \ as indeed I had, for the clonk on my head had dislodged some of the nerve-wirings\
    \ in my brain, and for the next three days whenever I spoke, whatever I tried\
    \ to say, I spewed forth a tirade of foulness. Luckily a cure was affected before\
    \ I had to do this show, otherwise ResonanceFM would be shut down by the authorities\
    \ for broadcasting disgusting language in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon,\
    \ when innocent and sensitive ears would be appalled, and rightly so.\nI was able\
    \ to treat the dislodged brain-wiring by myself, for though I have neglected to\
    \ learn about the toads of the world, I do know a thing or two about the magnificent\
    \ complexity of the human brain. I had a good teacher. Years ago I attended a\
    \ two-day course at the Blotzmann Institute, where I learned, among other things,\
    \ that if you immerse your head in a bucket of warm soapy water and do the Culpeper\
    \ Manoeuvres until at the point of drowning, most of your brain problems will\
    \ be solved. It certainly works for me.\nNow, where was I? I took the letter from\
    \ the postie and crawled back into the house, somehow managing to hoist myself\
    \ into a chair at the kitchen table. I did not like the look of the handwriting\
    \ on the envelope. It spoke to me of theft, spasms, and cruelty. It spoke of moral\
    \ turpitude. It spoke of rubber truncheons and contempt. You might ask how I could\
    \ read so much into the few scribbled lines of my name and address, but I am not\
    \ going to tell you. Instead, I am going to sulk while we have a short interval.\n\
    + + +\nThat's better. I'll get back to how I overcame what might have been writer's\
    \ block, or might have been something far more lethal, something almost too awful\
    \ to contemplate, in a moment. But I want to mention that, in between recovering\
    \ from my neurasthenic terrors and coming in to do today's show, I went to see\
    \ the film Snakes On A Plane. Most of the critics have\u2014with their customary\
    \ laziness\u2014made a big deal of Samuel L Jackson's line \u201CI'm sick and\
    \ tired of these beep-ing snakes on this beep-ing plane!\u201D, but for me there\
    \ was a much better moment in the screenplay. One of the stewardesses enters the\
    \ cockpit, where the co-pilot is trying to control the plane. (The captain has\
    \ already been bitten by a poisonous snake.) She says: \u201CWhat's with the oxygen\
    \ mask deploying?\u201D Now, put yourself in the scene. You are that stewardess.\
    \ You are wondering why all the oxygen masks have been released, for no apparent\
    \ purpose, so you go to the cockpit to find out. Come on now, think yourself into\
    \ the situation. What do you say, what words come out of your mouth? \u201CWhat's\
    \ with the oxygen masks?\u201D you might say, or at a push, \u201CWhat's with\
    \ the oxygen mask deployment?\u201D But \u201CWhat's with the oxygen mask deploying?\u201D\
    \ I think not. A great moment in a foolish but amusing film.\n+ + +\nSo I sat\
    \ at my table, glaring at this envelope with its repellent handwriting. I plucked\
    \ a plum from my plum bowl, sprinkled it with Dr Gillespie's Vital Nerve Powders,\
    \ took a bite, and glared at the envelope some more. I turned it over to see if\
    \ there was a return address, and there was, but it was badly smudged and illegible.\
    \ I cursed the postie. I flapped my arms, as if I were a bird, a big, legendary\
    \ bird, like a roc. I pulled a piece of straw out of my hair. I pondered the implications\
    \ of that anonymous 18th century suicide note which read, in its entirety, \u201C\
    All this buttoning and unbuttoning!\u201D I couldn't remember if there was an\
    \ exclamation mark appended to it, so I tottered to my feet and headed for the\
    \ bookshelves whereon nestled a dictionary of quotations. I never made it across\
    \ the room, because as I took a few unsteady steps I was confronted by a phantom.\
    \ It may have been a ghoul, but I think it was a phantom. It was grey and ethereal\
    \ and shimmering and damp and cold and mournful, and it was clutching in its slender\
    \ bloodless hand the key to a hotel room. Through some kind of ghostly thought-transference,\
    \ it told me that the hotel it belonged to was far away, in Winnipeg, and that\
    \ I must go there immediately. I tried a bit of thought transference myself, to\
    \ explain that my passport had expired and that I was too sick to go to Winnipeg\
    \ in any case, but I made a botch of it, and transferred my thoughts not to the\
    \ phantom but to a carpet beetle near the skirting board, which was so traumatised\
    \ by being suddenly zapped with alien thought processes that it had a heart attack\
    \ and perished, flipping on to its back and wiggling its many, many little legs\
    \ hopelessly in the air. Can carpet beetles have heart attacks, or did I misread\
    \ the signs? Who knows, apart from entomologists? What I do know is that the carpet\
    \ beetle was dead and the phantom was still looming there, reproachful and anguished.\
    \ It was, by the way, a Dutch phantom, a Rotterdam phantom, one of the phantoms\
    \ of Rotterdam. What was it doing in my house? Why was it imploring me to go to\
    \ a hotel in Winnipeg? What awaited me in the hotel room? I tried to remove a\
    \ sliver of plum peel that was caught in my teeth, without success. The Rotterdam\
    \ phantom shifted suddenly, spine-tinglingly. Now it was behind me. I span around.\
    \ The phantom was dissolving, slowly, but it had left the Winnipeg hotel key on\
    \ the mantelpiece.\nI opened a window. From my neighbour's house I could hear\
    \ the strains of \u201C20 Great TV Themes\u201D by the Dennis Drivel Accordion\
    \ And Pan-Pipe Orchestra. I realised it was the limited edition version, including\
    \ the theme from \u201CIt Shouldn't Happen To A Vet\u201D. My head cleared. Everything\
    \ seemed to fall into place. I had been sick, but now I was well. I flapped my\
    \ arms again, like wings, but not like the wings of a legendary bird like a roc.\
    \ I flapped my arms as if they were angel's wings, and I was being borne to heaven,\
    \ and I took the dead carpet beetle with me, for why should insects not share\
    \ in the rapture of paradise?"
