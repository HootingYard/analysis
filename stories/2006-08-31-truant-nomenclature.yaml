  text: 'It is just over a year since the Hooting Yard Nomenclature Monitoring Panel
    alerted us to the sonorously-named Demi-Leigh Tweddle (see 22 August 2005). Now
    we have further proof that youthful Britons are being given startling monickers
    by their judicious parents.

    A couple of weeks ago, the Guardian reported that a certain Mr & Mrs Haine had
    been sent to prison for four months because of their daughter''s persistent truancy.
    And the name of the girl who won''t go to school? Shlaine. Shlaine Haine. The
    couple''s son is called Caine.'
