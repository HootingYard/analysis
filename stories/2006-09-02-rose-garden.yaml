  text: "I beg your pardon. I never promised you a rose garden. Go and look at the\
    \ paperwork, where it is clearly stated that I promised you a ditch rife with\
    \ puddles and nettles, teeming with tiny creatures, worms, flatworms, things with\
    \ hundreds of legs and vibrating antennae, things with bulbous globular eyes and\
    \ things with no eyes at all. It is also made crystal clear that this ditch is\
    \ designed to surround your chalet, like a moat, and that no roses will grow in\
    \ it. A towering hollyhock or two, yes, but not a single rose. Why on earth do\
    \ you think that I promised you a rose garden?\nHow dare you accuse me of tampering\
    \ with the papers! Are you seriously suggesting that I tippexed out whole paragraphs\
    \ of the original and used a scratchy nib to insert a completely different schedule\
    \ of works? You are casting aspersions upon my skills as a landscape designer\
    \ of note and inferring that I am but a brute armed with a spade. I travelled\
    \ the length and breadth of the country to find you specimens of the creepy crawlies\
    \ you requested, rare maggots, weird blind wriggling transparent night crawlers,\
    \ slithering horrors, and all the rest. There was no rainfall for weeks on end,\
    \ so I created those puddles with my bare hands, carting bucket after bucket of\
    \ duckpond water from the brackish duckpond over yonder beyond the municipal bandstand.\
    \ It would have been a lot easier to plant a few roses in the ground, believe\
    \ me.\nYes, I know you did not call me a brute with a spade, those were my words,\
    \ but that is what you would have said were you a man of plain speech rather than\
    \ a pompous puffed up milksop given to Jesuitical circumlocution. Has it occurred\
    \ to you that your very verbosity may have contributed to you getting a ditch\
    \ dug around your chalet instead of a rose garden? You could have said to me \u201C\
    I'd like a rose garden, please,\u201D and I would have taken that on board, but\
    \ oh no, such simple language is not your style.\nYou did not say \u201CI'd like\
    \ a rose garden, please\u201D. I refute that utterly. If you had said that, why\
    \ would I be clutching three files of paperwork which clearly show that you asked\
    \ for a moat-like ditch rife with puddles and nettles and creeping creatures to\
    \ be dug to a depth of six feet around your chalet, without any provision for\
    \ a drawbridge? Do you think I just made that up off the top of my head? Why would\
    \ I do that? Ditch digging is back-breaking work, especially when you only have\
    \ one old rusty dented bent and battered spade to work with. Try it yourself.\n\
    There is no drawbridge straddling the ditch because you clearly specified that\
    \ you did not require one. Yes, that did perplex me, but I assumed you were planning\
    \ to vault the ditch on those long spidery legs of yours.\nIt is preposterous\
    \ to argue now that you did not ask for a drawbridge because you would not need\
    \ one to gain access to this putative rose garden you keep harping on about. Will\
    \ you stop banging your fists on that portcullis?\nWell\u2026 I will grant you\
    \ that. It is indeed unusual to find a portcullis blocking the door of a chalet\
    \ where there is no accompanying drawbridge. The two usually go together, I agree.\
    \ And no, nowhere in the bundle of papers do you request the installation of a\
    \ massive cast iron portcullis requiring the strength of ten muscular peasants\
    \ to winch it up, which is why it does not come with a winch, or any kind of levers\
    \ or pulleys or such contrivances. I am a landscapist, not an engineer.\nIf you\
    \ recall, on the tenth day that the works were being carried out on your ditch,\
    \ I told you that I would be unavailable on the following Thursday as I had to\
    \ attend the presentation of a prize cup far, far away in a distant, cold, and\
    \ mountainous land. Your immovable portcullis was installed in my absence, by\
    \ rogues. It has nothing to do with me.\nI have had quite enough of this. I am\
    \ about to send my messenger starling to perch on your portcullis. Tuck the banknotes\
    \ in the ring around its leg and flap your arms as a spur to send it back to me.\
    \ If you do not do so, I am going to go and fetch my old rusty dented bent and\
    \ battered spade and I will fill in your ditch. The puddles and the nettles and\
    \ the teeming creeping creatures will vanish under piles of muck and mud and soil,\
    \ and you will cut a forlorn figure, a Jesuitical milksop hammering on your portcullis,\
    \ a man without a ditch."
