  text: '"On ships, attempts to melt the ice by buckets of hot water or by steam jets
    are only partially effective, because a great deal of heat is needed to melt a
    little ice. Further, if the temperature is still below freezing point when the
    operation is being carried out, the melted ice may freeze again unless it can
    be pushed overboard first. Mechanical detachment of the ice is no easy matter,
    for ice adheres most tenaciously to clean, grease-free surfaces and a ship has
    often been thoroughly de-greased by wind-swept rain and spray before it becomes
    iced-up." -- G Van Praagh, De-Icing Of Ships'
