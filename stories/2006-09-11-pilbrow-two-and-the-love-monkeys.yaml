  text: "The ever-vigilant Dr Ruth Pastry has fired off a letter in response to last\
    \ Monday's item entitled Far Far Away.\nHail, Key!, she writes, My text for the\
    \ day is Deuteronomy 25:13. \u201CThou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights,\
    \ a great and a small.\u201D Before reading on, please check the contents of your\
    \ bag to ensure you are following the Lord's commands. And before you ask, yes,\
    \ of course I have checked my own bag, or rather bags, and I have nothing to fear\
    \ from Jehovah, because everything in my bags is sorted according to weight.\n\
    Now, I want to take issue with this tale of a cardboard, wax and string Romeo\
    \ and his (it's?) millions of unhatched love monkeys. I am not concerned that\
    \ they are magnetic and mute and blind, simply that there are millions of them\
    \ and only one of him, or it. For it seems to me that you are thereby condoning\
    \ polygamy. Are you some kind of fundamentalist Mormon? Youwill object that the\
    \ piece you wrote was fiction, or I suppose science fiction, but even so, you\
    \ should not underestimate the effect of your twaddle on impressionable young\
    \ minds\u2026 and impressionable older minds, too. I know that there are people\
    \ out there who base their lives on the texts in Hooting Yard, people who aspire\
    \ to be Dobsons or Tiny Enids, or even, god help us, Trebizondo Culpepers. What's\
    \ to say some feckless pimply youth with one too many Asbos thinks he might reform\
    \ his character by emulating Pilbrow Two? Just as you need to ensure you do not\
    \ have divers weights in your bag, you ought to give more thought to the moral\
    \ implications of your work.\nExcuse me for a moment while I do my daily chant.\
    \ Vad vod vud, vad vod vud, hoogoo, hoogoo, vad vod vud. There. I learned that\
    \ chant from a rather unhygienic suburban shaman. He was very fond of making little\
    \ plastic model aeroplanes, and he would sprinkle the completed kits with fairy\
    \ dust, chanting as he did so. He had a different daily chant to mine, of course.\
    \ I have to say that in all the years I have daily chanted the chant he allotted\
    \ to me, I have not felt a smidgeon of benefit from doing so. I suspect my chant\
    \ may be absolutely senseless.\nNow where was I? Ah yes, I think you need to write\
    \ more uplifting tales for your readers, ones with clear guidance as to one's\
    \ conduct in daily life. You often write about pies, so why not write about piety?\
    \ \u201CThe Pious Pie Shop Person\u201D, there's a title for you. Perhaps some\
    \ orphans being led astray could come under the pious influence of the pie shop\
    \ person. An evil demon may have persuaded the orphans to carry different weights,\
    \ great and small, in their bags, thus disobeying the word of the Lord. Apprised\
    \ of this foul abomination, the pious pie shop person would teach the tinies the\
    \ error of their ways. A story like this would do much to repair your reputation,\
    \ Mr Key. Think on it. Yours forever, Dr Ruth Pastry\nDr Pastry kindly attached\
    \ a picture of some pious orphans to inspire us all:\n"
