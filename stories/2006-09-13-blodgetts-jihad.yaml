  text: 'Bad Blodgett! One Tuesday in spring, he went a-roaming among the Perspex
    Caves of Lamont, part of that magnificent artificial coastline immortalised in
    mezzotints by the mezzotintist Rex Tint. Sheltering in one of the caves from a
    sudden downpour, Blodgett took his sketchbook out of his satchel and passed the
    time making a series of cartoon drawings of historical figures. The pictures were
    imaginary likenesses, of course, for Blodgett was ignorant of many things, and
    he had no idea what Blind Jack of Knaresborough looked like. Nor was he at all
    sure that his double cartoon of Barbara Stanwyckand Fred MacMurray bore any resemblance
    to the stars of Double Indemnity. The rain showed no sign of ceasing, so Blodgett
    filled page after page, scribbling drawings of Marcus Aurelius, Christopher Smart,
    Mary Baker Eddy, Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, and the Prophet Mohammed, among
    others. It was this last cartoon that caused ructions which were to have so decisive
    an effect on Blodgett''s life.

    Later that day, on his way home from the Perspex Caves of Lamont, Blodgett inadvertently
    left his sketchbook on the bus. A week or so later, a bus company employee was
    checking through the lost property and took a few moments to leaf through the
    book. Turning the fateful page, this employee--an adherent of the Islamic faith--was
    by turns outraged, humiliated, mortally offended and infuriated when he saw Blodgett''s
    cartoon. As is the way with such matters, he immediately arranged for copies to
    be distributed to mullahs and imams around the world, so that they too could share
    his outrage, humiliation, mortal offence and fury. Soon there were calls for Blodgett
    to be beheaded or otherwise put to death, and he went into hiding. Let''s take
    a look at the picture, so that we can understand what all the fuss was about.


    Blodgett''s cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed

    (In an interesting side note, there was a similar flurryof anger from a sect devoted
    to the cult of Fred MacMurray, but this fizzled out after Blodgett pledged to
    attend a penitential screening of one of the actor''s late pieces of Disney pap.)

    Meanwhile, hiding out in the Perspex Caves of Lamont, the evil cartoonist had
    time to think through what had happened. Blodgett was aware that the Victorian
    atheist Charles Bradlaugh had described the Christian Gospels as being "concocted
    by illiterate half-starved visionaries in some dark corner of a Graeco-Syrian
    slum", and he did not think it much of a leap to conclude that the Prophet Mohammed
    was an equally deluded soul, although perhaps a better-organised one, with access
    to weaponry which enabled him to spread his message faster and more efficiently.

    Around this time, Blodgett received through an intermediary an offer from the
    furious and offended Islamists. The sentence of death could be rescinded, they
    suggested, if he made a sincere conversion to their faith and promised to live
    out the rest of his days in submission to Allah. Blodgett considered this for
    about forty seconds before rejecting it. Apart from anything else, he reasoned,
    it was very unlikely that Mrs Blodgett would agree to spend the rest of her life
    cocooned in a person-sized tent and to stop going out by herself.

    Shortly after this, still in hiding, Blodgett had a brainwave. Indeed, he became
    somewhat furious and offended himself. The conversion offer, he decided, was an
    example of the old cliche "If you can''t beat them, join them". Well... he would
    join them, but not in the way they thought. If half-starved visionaries could
    propagate the Christian gospels, and Mohammed could claim to have heard the voice
    of God, as so many others down the centuries had insisted, with varying degrees
    of success, that they were in direct contact with supernatural powers, what was
    to stop Blodgett announcing that he, and only he, had found the true path? From
    this spark of inspiration was Blodgettism born.

    He began to make clandestine visits to the municipal library at Blister Lane,
    devouring, among other works, the Qu''ran, the Bible, the collected works of L
    Ron Hubbard and David Icke, the Book of Mormon, sacred texts from all the major
    religions and many of the minor ones, even a couple of novels by Ayn Rand. After
    a few weeks of constant reading, Blodgett set out to define Blodgettism. He did
    not want it to be a synthesis of every other faith--that seemed a little too pat,
    a little too Blavatskyesque--and nor did he want it to be simply an amalgam of
    the good bits. Considering that he was still under sentence of death from a number
    of shouting men with beards, Blodgett wanted Blodgettism to be a faith at once
    as rigorous and intransigent as Islam. Thus, he cast aside with reluctance some
    of the more amusing things he had learned, such as underwear regulations in Mormonism,
    and Mr Hubbard''s intergalactic drivel, and fixed his attention on jihad. As far
    as jihad-as-inner-struggle was concerned, Blodgett could not give a hoot. But
    jihad-as-holy-war appealed to him as a way of taking on his persecutors, and thus
    became the most important feature of the Blodgettist religion.

    In The Book Of Blodgett, published in paperback the following year, it has to
    be said that the founder of the new religion makes an impeccably reasonable argument
    in favour of his faith. Having devised a set of laws--called Blodgettia--he announces
    that it is the duty of everyone on earth to obey them, or be killed. Taking his
    cue mainly from the Qu''ran and the Old Testament, Blodgett devised an appropriately
    illogical and arbitrary set of regulations for human behaviour. The list of laws
    is too long and abstruse to reproduce here, but a couple of examples will suffice.

    "Blodgettia Law Number 12. Thou shalt not eat plums within ten yards of a pig
    or a goat or a starling. Those that disobey this law will be bundled up in sacking
    and thrown into a canal."

    " Blodgettia Law Number 49. It is forbidden to wear your hat at other than a jaunty
    angle. See appendix for diagrams of angles of jauntiness and non-jauntiness. Officials
    of the Committee For The Promotion Of Blodgettian Virtue And The Wholesale Suppression
    Of Blodgettian Vice And Abomination, armed with protractors and tape measures,
    will fan out across the land, and where they find hats worn at non-jaunty angles
    they shall proceed to poke malefactors with pointy sticks before putting them
    to an entirely justifiable death."

    Of course, the Prophet Mohammed--let''s just take a look at that picture again,
    to remind ourselves -


    As I was saying, the Prophet Mohammed was able to spread his word through a combination
    of historical and geographic circumstance and violence. Alas, Blodgettism never
    really took root, numbering perhaps only three or four devotees at its height,
    including Blodgett himself. But there are a few copies of The Book Of Blodgett
    which have not been pulped or thrown into dustbins, and they may yet inspire a
    new generation of fanatical adherents, who will demand, in big shouty voices,
    that they are right and every one else is wrong, and get very upset and angry
    if you disagree with them, and it will be your fault if they decide to blow you
    up or chop off your head. Be warned.'
