  text: '"Drunkenness, immorality and disease go hand in hand--a dreadful three. But
    more than this. The drunken man takes much longer over the sex-act, thereby prolonging
    the risk of disease, and he runs risks which he would rule out instantly if the
    fumes of alcohol had not changed the tawdry girl into the glittering fairy. Worse
    than all, he neglects to apply disinfection properly and promptly--he falls asleep
    or forgets all about it till too late. Men who are determined to have a ''night
    out'' should use calomel ointment (or some other substitute) before they start
    and if they have been in liquor they should disinfect instantly when they recover
    their sober senses." -- Ettie A Rout, Safe Marriage : A Return To Sanity'
