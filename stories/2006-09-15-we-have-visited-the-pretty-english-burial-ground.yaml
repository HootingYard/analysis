  text: '"We have visited the pretty English burial-ground, and the tomb of Smollet,
    which in the true English style is cut and scratched all over with the names of
    fools, who think thus to link their own insignificance to his immortality. We
    have also seen whatever else is to be seen, and what all travellers describe:
    to-morrow we leave Leghorn--for myself without regret: it is a place with which
    I have no sympathies, and the hot, languid, damp atmosphere, which depresses the
    spirits and relaxes the nerves, has made me suffer ever since we arrived." --
