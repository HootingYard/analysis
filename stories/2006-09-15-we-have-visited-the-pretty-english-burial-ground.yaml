  text: "\u201CWe have visited the pretty English burial-ground, and the tomb of Smollet,\
    \ which in the true English style is cut and scratched all over with the names\
    \ of fools, who think thus to link their own insignificance to his immortality.\
    \ We have also seen whatever else is to be seen, and what all travellers describe:\
    \ to-morrow we leave Leghorn\u2014for myself without regret: it is a place with\
    \ which I have no sympathies, and the hot, languid, damp atmosphere, which depresses\
    \ the spirits and relaxes the nerves, has made me suffer ever since we arrived.\u201D\
