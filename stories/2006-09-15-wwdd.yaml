  text: 'It has become fashionable among pious young Christian folk, particularly
    in the United States, to wear wristbands bearing the letters WWJD. This simple
    formula announces that the wearer has devoted their life to Christ, and faces
    any and all situations by asking the question What Would Jesus Do? Leaving aside
    the objection that the daily challenges faced by a mystic carpenter in Palestine
    two thousand years ago may not be wholly applicable to the kinds of ''issues''
    facing a young person hanging around a mall in Poughkeepsie in the twenty-first
    century, I think there is much to be said for this approach. If nothing else,
    it must lead to some interesting behaviour.


    For one thing, Jesus had a tendency to perform miraculous feats, such as walking
    on water or distributing improbable amounts of bread and fish. Then there were
    his occasional temperamental outbursts, as when he shooed a gang of moneylenders
    out of a temple. It''s to be hoped that the pious teenies emulate this kind of
    thing rather than Jesus'' rather priggish sermonising, for which he had a weakness.
    Although there are one or two nuggets of wisdom in his preaching, more often it
    is reminiscent of the airy New Age twaddle one might get from Deepak Chopra and
    his ilk.

    The difficulty remains, though, that a contemporary teenager is going to face
    circumstances that Jesus simply never had to deal with, all those years ago. Nowadays,
    the average young American Christian does not spend much time involved with oxen,
    say, or fatted calves, much less with tares and talents and the blood of the lamb.
    Young Tad or Biff is likely to get more het up about soda pop, baseball caps,
    and stadium rock. Working out what Jesus would do thus becomes a very fraught
    endeavour. Hours upon hours of Biblical study will go some way to resolving the
    problems, but sooner or later the morally anguished teen will resort to booze
    and drugs and firearms.

    Here at Hooting Yard, we have come up with an elegant solution to these modern
    dilemmas. We will soon unleash on the market wristbands bearing the legend WWDD.
    What would Dobson do? There is a simple beauty to this, in the sense that, whatever
    the situation, the answer is always "Write a pamphlet! (out of print)".'
