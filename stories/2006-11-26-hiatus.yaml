  text: 'We''ve had another hiatus here at Hooting Yard. The chief reason for this
    is that I agreed to take part in an experiment and have spent the last two months
    living as an otter. Only yesterday did Professor Tadaaki pull up at the riverbank
    in his big yellow rusty jeep to tell me that I had misheard his instructions and
    wasted valuable research time splashing about to no apparent purpose.

    I towelled myself dry and traipsed home in a bit of a temper, because the good
    Prof did not see fit to tell me what it was that I had misheard. Was I meant to
    have been living as a hatter? As a nutter? Who knows? Anyway, I am home now, and
    have already started scribbling prose to provide my loyal readers with entertainment,
    instruction, and a diversion from autumn thoughts of knitwear and shove-ha''penny.
    Now read on...'
