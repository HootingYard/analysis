  text: 'Look at this man coming up the path, the waterlogged path. They call him
    the district line dentist. He has dentistry in his blood. He has blood on his
    shoes. Blood on his shoes, talc in his hair, and as he walks along the waterlogged
    path he is shouting and shouting and shouting. The blood on his shoes is still
    wet and warm from the slaughtering he has been engaged in, up in the hills, where
    the district line never goes. It is not the blood of humans. There are no humans
    in those hills, only cardboard figures, and hardboard figures, and balsa wood
    figures, and an enormous colony of very, very frightening birds, like savage and
    pitiless birds from an ancient myth, except that these birds are real, fat with
    feathers, and absolutely terrifying. You may have seen their like on the sides
    of buses in Pointy Town, for it was images of similar birds that were used in
    that ill-conceived advertising campaign for a brand new type of fizzy and frothing
    detergent pill which, it was claimed, would put more pep into your pots and pans.
    We know that banging pots and pans is a traditional method of scarifying birds,
    but it would not work with these birds, the ones that perch on the cardboard and
    hardboard and balsa wood figures in the hills from which the man they call the
    district line dentist has just descended, with blood on his shoes and a song in
    his heart. That is why he is shouting. He has a song in his heart but he cannot
    sing. His song is about the sad final days of Edgar Allan Poe, and the chorus
    replicates that neurasthenic writer''s dying words.... "Reynolds! Reynolds! Reynolds!"
    That is what the district line dentist is shouting as he clumps along the path
    in his blood-soaked shoes. He clumps with a limp, for his legs are of uneven length,
    only just, but decisively so. He was not born that way. When he was a cherubic
    bonny baby both his legs were measured, and they were found by several independent
    authorities to be identical in length. Something happened to him between then
    and now to mar his symmetry, something he has always blamed on the ferocious birds
    up in the hills. That is why he is such a bitter man and a bird hater.

    He hated birds, but he was fond of moles. He had a little toy mole made of cambric
    and string, a puppet you could call it, which sat on a china plate on the dresser
    in the parlour of the boarding house by the seaside where he lived. Seeing a mole
    on a plate, many people chided the district line dentist that it looked as if
    he wanted the mole for his dinner, albeit that it was only a cambric and string
    toy. The presence of a knife and fork alongside the plate served only to emphasise
    this misapprehension, but that was part of his plan, or I should say part of one
    of his many plans. Dentistry was in his blood, but he no longer practised that
    trade, for he was an old, old man, retired to a seaside boarding house, a boarding
    house named after Ray Milland, the film star who memorably appeared in The Man
    With X-Ray Eyes. The gardens of the boarding house were riotous with foxgloves,
    and as you may know, foxgloves are poisonous to moles. At least, that is the case
    in the land of which I speak, it may or may not be the case elsewhere in the boundless
    universe. But of course the foxgloves which bloomed in the Ray Milland boarding
    house gardens were not harmful to the district line dentist''s mole, for it was
    but a toy, a plaything, sat on its plate on the dresser. The cutlery aligned next
    to the plate was of exquisite workmanship, of the finest metal, manufactured,
    according to legend, by gnomes, thoughthe tales told of these gnomes were full
    of holes, and every version was different. Sometimes the gnomes were said to live
    under a big bright mountain far away, and sometimes they were said to spend their
    lives jetting from one paradise island to another, making their knives and forks
    and spoons during stopovers in airport snack bars. In truth, nothing can have
    been more mundane than the actual making of the cutlery, and gnomes played no
    part in it. Every last teaspoon and sugar tong was made in a great grim factory,
    guarded by beagles, plonked in a field at the end of the district line, Hallelujah
    Field, where no grass grew, only weeds and tares.

    There are storms in teacups and barn-storms, but it is a very particular sort
    of storm that engages our attention now. Henry Cow recorded a piece entitled Bittern
    Storm Over Ulm, the title taken from a passage in one of Charles Fort''s compendia
    of anomalous phenomena, and likewise, we are dealing with a storm of birds. For
    up in the hills where the district line never goes, a surge of magnetism convulsed
    the colony of terrifying birds, and they filled the sky, screeching and shrieking,
    maddened beyond measure. Hearing the racket, the dentist clumped to a halt on
    the waterlogged path. His shoes were steeped in the blood of slaughtered birds,
    but for each one he had killed, dozens more had appeared, flapping in from who
    knows where, gathering in the hills, perched and brooding and awaiting the burst
    of magnetic energy sending them into a storm in the sky. But this was Pointy Town,
    not Ulm, and these were no bitterns. And the waterlogged path that came down from
    the hills led, in its meandering way, to a cluster of huts on the beach, huts
    that once belonged to boat builders, Noah figures whose beards were stiff with
    the salt of the sea, long gone now, the boats they built shattered and broken,
    wooden fragments scattered across the sands, eaten by worms, as those who built
    the broken boats were themselves devoured as they lay in their tombs in the pretty
    churchyard of Saint Bibblydibdib''s, hard by the beach, and popular with poets.
    Sand worms and earthworms, and the work they do, have been ignored by the graveyard
    poets of Pointy Town, and for that they should be ashamed. The district line dentist
    was heading for the huts where once boats had beenbuilt, for there he believed
    he would find sanctuary from the vengeful birds. Pelange and Froumier are among
    those who have written authoritatively about ritual appeasement of bird gods,
    and while I am not suggesting for one moment that there is a divinity lurking
    in the breasts of those screeching horrors in the sky over the hills--the sky
    now black with their swooping, flapping savagery, incidentally--yet we would do
    well to recall, in particular, Pelange''s nostrum regarding protecting shrouds.
    But of course, that popinjay writer knew nothing of birds driven bonkers by eerie
    magnetic forces which we still do not fully understand. Luckily for him, the district
    line dentist did.

    It was no accident that the church by the beach was consecrated to Saint Bibblydibdib,
    for he was the patron saint of something or other resonant of marine life. He
    is one of those saints for whom there is no convincing evidence of his actual
    existence, and it may be that he was simply a phantom shimmering in vapours from
    the brains of seaside mystics. Buried in the churchyard was one such mystic, a
    wise woman known as the Woohoowoodiwoo Woman. Legend in those parts held that
    she it was who had fallen foul of the birds in the hills, and had pelted the old
    boat builders with potatoes until they ceased to build boats, and that she had
    done so because she lived in mortal fear not only of the birds but of the sea.
    Hideous aquatic beings haunted her nightmares, from which she would awake crying
    "Woohoowoodiwoo!", hence the name by which she was known. Intriguingly, on 22nd
    November 1963, the day of the Kennedy Assassination, she awoke screaming "Reynolds!
    Reynolds! Reynolds!", like Edgar Allan Poe on his deathbed, but we do not know
    why, and nor did she ever divulge her dream, even to the district line dentist,
    who did her bridge canal work, and praised the enamel of her molars, and was her
    confidante and, some said, her inamorata, all those years ago, before the frightening
    birds haunted the hills, and while boats were still built in the cluster of huts
    on Pointy Town beach, the huts clustered between two coastal features called impagu
    and sacketysack. She was invariably dressed, even festooned, in those days, in
    a maroon shawl, the Woohoowoodiwoo Woman. Maroon, too, was the colour of the plumage
    of the most frightening of the frightening birds. Did the shawl act as her protective
    shroud, a la Pelange? The district line dentist suffered from Daltonism, or colour
    blindness, and he knew not what maroon was, nor how it differed from blue. As
    we know, maroon and blue are the two ''foundation'' colours in the Blotzmann Register.'
