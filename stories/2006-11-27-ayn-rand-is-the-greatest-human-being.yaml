  text: "\u201CAyn Rand is the greatest human being who has ever lived. Atlas Shrugged\
    \ is the greatest human achievement in the history of the world. Since Ayn Rand\
    \ has designated Nathaniel Branden as her \u2018intellectual heir\u2019 and has\
    \ repeatedly proclaimed him to be an ideal exponent of her philosophy, he is to\
    \ be accorded only marginally less reverence than Ayn Rand herself.\u201D \u2014\
