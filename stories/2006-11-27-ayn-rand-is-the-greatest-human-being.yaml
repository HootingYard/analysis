  text: '"Ayn Rand is the greatest human being who has ever lived. Atlas Shrugged
    is the greatest human achievement in the history of the world. Since Ayn Rand
    has designated Nathaniel Branden as her ''intellectual heir'' and has repeatedly
    proclaimed him to be an ideal exponent of her philosophy, he is to be accorded
    only marginally less reverence than Ayn Rand herself." -- Nathaniel Branden, Judgment
    Day : My Years With Ayn Rand'
