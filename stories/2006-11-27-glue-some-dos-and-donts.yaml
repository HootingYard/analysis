  text: 'Far too many people simply don''t understand how to make the best use of
    glue. For that reason, here at Hooting Yard we have taken it upon ourselves to
    educate our readers by providing some cardinal do''s and don''ts. Read, ponder,
    and digest, and never again will you stand accused of glue-related tomfoolery.

    1. Never use glue to stick your head to something it ought not be glued to. For
    example, you should avoid gluing your head to the nest of a being which will suck
    out your brains.

    2. Do not confuse glue with gum. Some gum can be chewed--indeed, such gum is often
    called ''chewing gum''. You cannot chew glue, and you will rue the day you do,
    should you be such a nincompoop so to do.

    3. Make sure you read Dobson''s various pamphlets on the subject of glue, all
    of which are highly informative. I particularly recommend The Adhesive Properties
    Of Six Hundred Different Types Of Glue, With Diagrams (out of print, but sometimes
    salvageable from rubbish tips in the vicinity of glue-making factories). This
    pamphlet has been condemned by a number of commentators as being a farrago of
    lies and bile, written by Dobson in order to exact revenge upon one of his enemies,
    but you should read it anyway, for even if the so-called facts with which it is
    packed are false and inaccurate, you will still learn much enabling you to hold
    your own in any argument concerning glue.

    4. Some glues are designed for very specific purposes. For example, library paste
    is thick and glutinous, whereas mucilage is thin, clear and gelatinous. Don''t
    get the two mixed up, or you may be beset by adherence issues, and none of us
    wants to face such a circumstance, bereft of glue-knowledge, alone and puny in
    a cold and pitiless universe. No!

    That is quite enough about glue for today.'
