  text: "Far too many people simply don't understand how to make the best use of glue.\
    \ For that reason, here at Hooting Yard we have taken it upon ourselves to educate\
    \ our readers by providing some cardinal do's and don'ts. Read, ponder, and digest,\
    \ and never again will you stand accused of glue-related tomfoolery.\n1. Never\
    \ use glue to stick your head to something it ought not be glued to. For example,\
    \ you should avoid gluing your head to the nest of a being which will suck out\
    \ your brains.\n2. Do not confuse glue with gum. Some gum can be chewed\u2014\
    indeed, such gum is often called \u2018chewing gum\u2019. You cannot chew glue,\
    \ and you will rue the day you do, should you be such a nincompoop so to do.\n\
    3. Make sure you read Dobson's various pamphlets on the subject of glue, all of\
    \ which are highly informative. I particularly recommend The Adhesive Properties\
    \ Of Six Hundred Different Types Of Glue, With Diagrams (out of print, but sometimes\
    \ salvageable from rubbish tips in the vicinity of glue-making factories). This\
    \ pamphlet has been condemned by a number of commentators as being a farrago of\
    \ lies and bile, written by Dobson in order to exact revenge upon one of his enemies,\
    \ but you should read it anyway, for even if the so-called facts with which it\
    \ is packed are false and inaccurate, you will still learn much enabling you to\
    \ hold your own in any argument concerning glue.\n4. Some glues are designed for\
    \ very specific purposes. For example, library paste is thick and glutinous, whereas\
    \ mucilage is thin, clear and gelatinous. Don't get the two mixed up, or you may\
    \ be beset by adherence issues, and none of us wants to face such a circumstance,\
    \ bereft of glue-knowledge, alone and puny in a cold and pitiless universe. No!\n\
    That is quite enough about glue for today."
