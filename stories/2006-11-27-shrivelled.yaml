  text: 'When I removed the shrivelled human head from the burlap sack, my first thought
    was that there must have been foul play, as detectives like to call it. But I
    am not a detective, and foul play seemed incongruous in this sun-dappled meadow
    splattered with buttercups, tansy and wild hollyhocks, under a gorgeous blue sky.
    Just before stumbling upon the sack I had been singing at the top of my voice,
    singing a happy song, one of my own devising, a paean of praise to bees, extolling
    the virtues of these splendid buzzy insects, and I was dressed like a bee, sort
    of, in a black and yellow hooped jumper, and black leggings, and a black cap upon
    my head.

    There was no cap or hat of any sort on the shrivelled head I took from the sack,
    just a few strands of filthy matted hair. I sat on the grass and took a pair of
    snippy butcher''s scissors out of my pocket and gave the shrivelled head a much
    needed haircut, and I made a little pile of the clippings on a patch of bare soil,
    and set fire to it with a match, and it blazed oh so briefly, sparking and crackling,
    and then all that was left was a trace of ash. I plopped the shrivelled head back
    into the burlap sack, swung it over my shoulder, and headed off towards Old Farmer
    Frack''s pig farm, singing lustily.

    No one knew how old Old Farmer Frack was, and no one could remember a time when
    he was not squelching about in the mud, at all hours of the day and night, raising
    his pigs. As farms go, it was a tiny farm, but Old Farmer Frack was a giant of
    a man, by the standards of that land, and his pigs grew to giants too, under his
    care. It was a mystery how he made his living, for he never took his pigs to market
    to sell them. When they reached a size that made them too big for the tiny farm,
    he drove them up into the hills and let them loose. That is why dutiful parents
    warn their children against going a-wandering alone in the hills, and tell terrifying
    tales of giant rampaging pigs which capture and carry off misbehaved infants in
    their big chomping jaws.

    I found Old Farmer Frack engulfed in a fug of culinary fumes in his kitchen. He
    was preparing his lunch, a concoction of jugged hare, devilled kidneys, and blancmange,
    and he was cursing like a sailor, for he had inadvertently jugged the kidneys
    and devilled the hare. One of his pigs--not yet titanic in stature--was rooting
    around the skirting boards, looking perhaps for beetles or other creeping things.
    I patted the pig on its shanks, if pigs have shanks, and placed my sack on the
    table.

    "This might interest you, Old Farmer Frack," I said, helping myself to a tumbler''s
    worth of water from the spigot. Except for his maritime curses, learned when he
    was but a boy, Old Farmer Frack was a man of few words. He eyed the sack, and
    he eyed me, and he eyed his spigot. Then he put down his jug full of kidneys and
    opened the sack with unnecessary vigour, causing the shrivelled human head to
    roll across the table and topple to the floor. To its credit, the pig ignored
    it. Old Farmer Frack stared at the shrivelled head and immediately made the sign
    of the cross. I had no idea he was a Papist pig farmer!

    "I just snipped the gory locks off this gory find," I said, "And then I burned
    them!"

    I stooped to lift the head back on to the table, but Old Farmer Frack clouted
    me with main force and I crumpled to the floor. Unconscious for a few seconds,
    I came to with the pig''s snout in my face. The shrivelled human head was perilously
    close to one of the pig''s cloven feet, and I feared that it would be crushed
    should the pig become excitable and begin stamping. Thinking fast, I reached my
    hand up and patted the pig soothingly. Previously, when I had patted its shanks,
    or what I believed to be its shanks, I had done so in a perfunctory manner, much
    as one might chuck a dog under the chin. Now I willed the placatory forces of
    Blotzmann Movement Number Seven (a) into my hand, that I might communicate absolute
    calm. At this point Old Farmer Frack smashed me on the head with a spade. Typical
    of a farmer, I thought, to keep a spade in his kitchen.And then I passed out,
    for hours.

    I was woken by the unbearable sound of a transistor radio blaring into my ears.
    ''Unbearable'', because on Radio Pipsqueak it was, apparently, U2 Day, and the
    noise assailing me was the voice of the preposterous Paul "Nobo" Hewson, a Christian
    Irish millionaire given to taking court action to retrieve a pair of trousers
    and a hat*. I lunged to deaden the sound in any way I could, and saw Old Farmer
    Frack looming above me, his jowls smeared with vestiges of devilled hare, jugged
    kidneys, and blancmange.

    "You brought me the wrong head," he said, lugubriously.
