  text: "Whatever else you may say about them, Islamic protesters know how to brandish\
    \ a good placard. Witness the slogan quoted above, which puts Western lefties\
    \ with their \u201CBush 'n' Blair, Oooh We Hate You\u201D vapidity to shame. Something\
    \ about the one time Cardinal Ratzinger clearly inspires the perpetually-offended\
    \ Islamists. His recent comments\u2014sorry, unforgivable insults for which he\
    \ deserves to be beheaded\u2014about the iniquity of old Mohammed led to the creation\
    \ of Hooting Yard's favourite placard of the year.\n"
