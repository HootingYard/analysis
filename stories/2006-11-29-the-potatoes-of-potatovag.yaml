  text: "\u201CWhen did you last clap eyes on the potatoes of Potatovag?\u201D\nI\
    \ was asked this question while standing on a bridge over a muddy river in a high\
    \ wind. I was wearing spats, as usual, minding my own business, and humming the\
    \ theme tune to the exciting TV quiz show Cormorant Or Grebe? It was pouring with\
    \ rain, but I didn't care, for atop my head I wore a sprightly wide-brimmed hat,\
    \ all golden, and decked with plastic chrysanthemums.\nYes, dear reader, I was\
    \ the spats-and-hat man you have heard so many stories about. Remember when you\
    \ were tiny, and mama tucked you up in bed and opened the Treasury Of Bedtime\
    \ Tales For Pallid And Sickly Infants, and how you begged her to ignore the vapid\
    \ rubbish about giants and dragons and magic kingdoms and what have you, and to\
    \ go straight to the stories of the spats-and-hat man? That's me. But of course\
    \ you would never have been told the tale of this particular day that found me\
    \ standing on a windswept bridge in a downpour being questioned about the potatoes\
    \ of Potatovag, because it was only yesterday, and there has not yet been time\
    \ for my scribe to boswell an account ready for the printing presses.\nIn truth,\
    \ I have a team of scribes, who work in relays. One follows me about, morning,\
    \ noon and night, scribbling down my doings. One sits at a desk in the chalet,\
    \ making a fair copy of yesterday's scribblings. One types up the fair copy in\
    \ the chalet's computer pod. One supervises the printing of the typed copy. One\
    \ carts the printed copies around to all the kiosks where they can be purchased.\
    \ And one has a day of rest, often spent studying the swans downriver. I am a\
    \ lucky spats-and-hat man to have so many Boswells at my beck and call, even if\
    \ they can be a tiresome bunch. Let me briefly describe their shortcomings. Hoobington\
    \ is curdled and indiscreet. Tack is blind. Dalewinton has pins in his legs and\
    \ a metal plate in his skull and his favourite tipple is the boiled blood of ducks.\
    \ Poop is a nincompoop. Hudibras is a swivel-eyed Stalinist maniac whose cardigans\
    \ always bear traces of yesterday's sausages. The sixth boswell is actually named\
    \ Boswell, or rather, Boswellboswell. This one topples over far too often for\
    \ my liking.\nSo, yesterday it happened that I was accompanied by this Boswellboswell\
    \ person. There I was, standing on the bridge in the rain, humming, and peering\
    \ over across the fields to where the phlox and pansies and pinks, the hellebore\
    \ and hollyhocks, the marigolds, verbascum and charlock and mimosa, spurge, gorse\
    \ and erica, the lupins, the daffodils, the broom and japonica, the creeping jenny,\
    \ the old man's beard and the cow parsley, the speedwell and flax and dock and\
    \ hops and oxlip and crocuses and teasel, and the geraniums and foxgloves and\
    \ fleabane and jonquil and lobelia grow in such heavenly profusion, when the person\
    \ from Potatovag drew up beside me in his death-trap jalopy, and shouted \u201C\
    When did you last clap eyes on the potatoes of Potatovag?\u201D\nI made my reply,\
    \ with all the wit and brio you have come to expect from the spats-and-hat man\u2026\
    \ but Boswellboswell chose that very moment to topple over yet again, and as we\
    \ were on a bridge, he toppled into the muddy river, and he sank, and with him\
    \ sank the words I spoke to the person from Potatovag, words now lost forever,\
    \ never to find their place in a new edition of the Treasury Of Bedtime Tales\
    \ For Pallid And Sickly Infants, infants now who will be deprived of a thin, weak\
    \ smile of glee before falling to a snooze in their iron sickbeds, a snooze from\
    \ which\u2014who knows?\u2014they may never awake."
