  text: 'As I was preparing for yesterday''s edition of Hooting Yard On The Air, I
    received an email from listener Jonathan Coleclough. Actually, Jonathan just forwarded
    an email to me, adding a note: "The subject line of the email below promised so
    much. But of course it was just spam. [Sigh]"

    The subject line of the forwarded email was "Dobson and longevity" and, indeed,
    what followed was twaddle. I wrote back to Jonathan as follows... "I find it disconcerting
    that Dobson is haunting the less salubrious corners of the world wide interweb,
    e''en from beyond the grave. That ... and longevity seems to betrying to tell
    us something... something spooky and almost Lovecraftian. I may have to investigate."

    Of course I have not yet had time to make a full investigation, to send agents
    from Haemoglobin Towers fanning out across the globe, with their ponderous briefcases,
    beaver fur headgear, badger badges, and piercing eyesight, but I have been able
    to give the matter some thought. Could it really be true that the out of print
    pamphleteer cheated death? That beneath the funeral shroud, that uncanny yellow
    festoonment cut from a bolt of cheap tarpaulin from a chandlery in the brine-soaked
    hellhole of O''Houlihan''s Wharf, a tarp stitched with cack-handed embroidery
    of piddocks and toredos and winkles and periwinkles and strombuses and whelks
    and loligos, that wrapped in it was not the dead Dobson but an imposter or simulacrum?
    If so, if Dobson lived, where was he? He would be impossibly old by now, creaking
    and crumbling. Was he trudging along alien pathways, anonymous, in some distant
    land, his eyes--one beady, the other milky--fixed straight ahead, an undead dead
    man plodding ever forward towards he knew not what? We had all thought our dear
    pamphleteer a wisp, a fume borne upon the luminiferous aether, the spindly frame
    he once inhabited discarded, hurled enwrapped in its hideous tarpaulin from the
    worm-eaten jetty outside O''Houlihan''s Wharf post office into the boiling sea.

    Dobson and longevity, indeed. But perhaps, ill tempered and hateful, he skulked
    in a booth somewhere, in the outskirts, feeding on biscuits and berries and birds
    plucked in mid-flight from the air, sucking drops of rainwater from the toggles
    of his duffel coat. Wherever he was, the undead Dobson remained invisible to all
    who had known him, yet he somehow had the ability to seed the world wide interweb
    with texts that none would ever read. Was he making some skewed commentary upon
    all those unread out of print pamphlets that poured out of him during the years
    before that thunder-wracked gathering in the bracken- and bindweed-choked churchyard
    of St Bibblydibdib''s when bells clanged lamentations, and salt tears ran down
    the cheeks of even the most grizzled countenance? Where was Dobson then? Did he
    scuttle from beneath the shroud when backs were turned? Were there conspirators
    who replaced him with an effigy of felt and excelsior and cardboard and rags?
    Who could such conspirators have been? Certainly Marigold Chew cannot have been
    among them, for who could ever question the bleak desolation with which she sported
    her widow''s weeds?

    If there is anyone to point a finger at, it would be Ned Blewitt. Dobson had not
    known this urchin for long. As far as we know the two met just an hour or so before
    Dobson''s death, or his alleged death as we must now refer to it. Dobson had left
    the house to buy a new picnic hamper, for it is a little-known fact that he was
    fond of extravagant picnicking occasions, and much given to hauling a hamper stuffed
    to the brim with cake and pomegranates and Limburger cheese and pre-sliced slices
    of pemmican and brazil nuts and more brazil nuts and even more brazil nuts and
    parsley and treacle pies and mashed potato and suet puddings up punishing slopes
    and down inclines into declivities in the hills where bats are legion and no other
    human being has ever trod. There, Dobson would unpack his hamper and scoff his
    food unobserved, one of his own out of print pamphlets propped open with a stick,
    chewing and reading and impervious to the wind and the drizzle. Such excursions
    battered the ageing Dobson as much as they battered his hamper, but a picnic hamper
    can be replaced. And so it was, on that March morning, that Dobson pulled on his
    Belgian Cadet boots and his souvenir cardigan from the Ayn Rand Exposition at
    Jakarta and strode off towards the picnic supplies boutique at the perimeter of
    Old Farmer Frack''s fields on that patch of scrubland beyond Blister Lane.

    Next to the boutique was a kiosk operated by the Holy Sisters Of Headaches And
    Dismay, an order of nuns who dispensed bowls of soup to passing mendicants. As
    Dobson made his tottering progress towards picnickery, he was buttonholed by one
    of the sisters... no, hang on, I''ve got the wrong day. The kiosk was gone by
    then, obliterated by livid purple death rays from a spaceship caught in a pocket
    of error in the continuum. I mean the space-time continuum, I think. Anyway, where
    the soup kiosk once stood there was now a tent, pitched there by The Mighty Alphonso,
    a roguish refugee from many a penny circus who promised to astonish and astound
    the crowds with feats of legerdemain and prestidigitation, accompanied by his
    assistant, Little Alphonso The Memory Man. But there were no crowds that day,
    only Dobson, who hurried in through the tent flaps to avoid an encounter with
    one of his creditors, it doesn''t matter which one, who was lurking outside the
    picnic boutique hoping to waylay the pamphleteer. Inside, in the gloom, he came
    upon Little Alphonso rehearsing his latest show-stopper, a recitation of a historical
    glossary of diseases. Peering over his shoulder to ensure that he had not been
    followed, Dobson slumped into a pew, one of many pews stolen from a cathedral
    by the ever-resourceful Mighty Alphonso, and hearkened to the words of the diminutive
    urchin as he learned his lines.

    "Abscess, Addison''s disease, Ague, Ague-cake, Anasarca (generalised massive dropsy),"
    recited Little Alphonso, "Apoplexy, Aphthae, Aphthous stomatitis, Ascites, Asthenia,
    Bad Blood, Bilious fever, Biliousness, Boil, Brain fever, Bronchial asthma, Camp
    fever, Cancrum otis, Catalepsy, Catarrh, Chlorosis, Cholera infantum, Chorea,
    Colic, Congestion, Congestive Fever, Consumption, Convulsions, Croup (the crouping
    noise was similar to the sound emitted by a chicken affected with the pip; also
    known rising of the lights), Debility, Diphtheria, Dropsy, Dysentery, Effluvia,
    Epilepsy, Erysipelas, Fatty Liver, Flux, Furuncle, Gangrene, Gleet, Gravel, Grippe,
    Hectic fever, Hives, Hospital fever, Hydrocephalus, Hydrothorax, Icterus, Inanition,
    Infection, Inflammation, Jaundice, King''s evil, Lockjaw, Lung Fever, Lung Sickness,
    Malignant fever, Marasmus, Meningitis, Milk Sick (poisoning resulting from the
    drinking of milk produced by a cow who had eaten a plant known as white snake
    root), Mormal, Neuralgia, Paristhmitis, Petechial fever, Phthisis, Pleurisy, Pneumonia,
    Podagra, Potts Disease, Putrid fever, Putrid sore throat, Pyrexia, Quinsy, Scarlatina,
    Scrofula, Septic, Ship fever, Softening of the brain, Spotted fever, Summer complaint,
    Suppuration, Trismus nascentium or neonatorum, Typhoid..."

    "Oh for God''s sake," shouted Dobson, "I have heard enough!"

    "Sorry, I didn''t see you there," said Little Alphonso. "I am Little Alphonso
    The Memory Man," he added, "Although of course that is a stage name, and as you
    can see I am preparing for a stage performance later on today when the rains tumble
    from the sky and the townsfolk hereabouts will seek shelter in this our tent as
    you have done for a purpose unbeknown to me. You are staring in perplexity at
    my pointy triangular cap, I see. Well, I always wear it for rehearsals, for concealed
    within it, attached to my cranial integuments, are wires which transmit brain-rays
    by invisible forces thus nourishing my mental capacity and magnifying it a thousandfold.
    Would you like a conference pear?" ... and the urchin took two of the said fruits
    from a pocket and passed one to Dobson.

    Bear in mind that Dobson had little more than an hour to live. There has never
    been any suggestion that he was poisoned by the pear proffered by Little Alphonso,
    whose real name, of course, was Ned Blewitt. If anyone had the means and wherewithal
    to spirit the still living Dobson from beneath his apparent funeral shroud, and
    to replace him with a counterfeit corpse, it was Ned, and that is why my suspicions
    rest on him.

    My investigations will continue. The next step is to ascertain if The Mighty Alphonso
    may also have been involved. Unlike Little Alphonso, The Mighty Alphonso was no
    mere stage name. That fact alone should give us pause. And so I shall pause, not,
    like the doomed--or maybe not doomed--Dobson, to gobble down a conference pear,
    but to stretch my legs in the direction of a pie shop, to purchase a lemon meringue
    pie, and to carry it in its cardboard packaging to a shrine where I will place
    it as an offering to appease the mad and terrible gods before whom I bow down
    on Wednesday afternoons.'
