  text: '"One day the Lord gathered together all the insects in the world, all the
    beetles, bugs, bees, mosquitoes, ants, locusts, grasshoppers, and other creatures
    who fly or hop or crawl, and shut them up in a huge sack well tied at the end.
    What a queer, squirming, muffled-buzzing bundle it made, to be sure! Then the
    Lord called the woman to him and said, ''Woman, I would have you take this sack
    and throw it into the sea''." -- Abbie Farwell Brown, The Curious Book Of Birds'
