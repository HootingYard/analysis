  text: "\u201COne day the Lord gathered together all the insects in the world, all\
    \ the beetles, bugs, bees, mosquitoes, ants, locusts, grasshoppers, and other\
    \ creatures who fly or hop or crawl, and shut them up in a huge sack well tied\
    \ at the end. What a queer, squirming, muffled-buzzing bundle it made, to be sure!\
    \ Then the Lord called the woman to him and said, \u2018Woman, I would have you\
    \ take this sack and throw it into the sea\u2019.\u201D \u2014 Abbie Farwell Brown,\
    \ The Curious Book Of Birds"
