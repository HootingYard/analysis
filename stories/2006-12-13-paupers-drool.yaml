  text: 'It was once believed that children frightened by thunderstorms could be emboldened
    by the application of a tincture of paupers'' drool to their infant foreheads.
    When I say "it was once believed", I mean to be very specific. This was once believed,
    by one person, for a very brief period of time.

    The person was Prince Fulgencio, the so-called ''prancing prince'', who one autumn
    day found his daughter, the Infanta Gertrude, cowering behind an arras in her
    playroom. One rarely finds an arras these days anywhere except upon the dramatic
    stage, but the prancing prince had thespian inclinations and his palace was littered
    with theatrical props.

    "Whyfore art thou cowering so behind the arras as thunderclaps rend the sky?"
    asked the prince.

    In reply, the Infanta Gertrude whimpered in terror as a fresh thunderclap rent
    the sky. Her playroom was on the topmost floor of the palace, and its ceiling
    had been removed, exposing the room to the mighty firmament overhead. The prince
    wanted to toughen up his daughter in preparation for a life of ruthless tyranny,
    and it dismayed him to see her milksop ways.

    Thus it was that he strode off into the Weird Woods of Woobyhoobyhoo to consult
    with the Wise Woman. He found her, oblivious of the storm, tossing fallen and
    gathered crab apples to her team of pigs. The Wise Woman was a shape shifter,
    and on this particular day she could have been mistaken for Nova Pilbeam, that
    siren of the British screen who, in the 1930s, starred in Alfred Hitchcock''s
    Young And Innocent and the first version of The Man Who Knew Too Much.


    Nova Pilbeam

    The prince explained his predicament. The Wise Woman, more intent upon her pigs
    than upon this strutting royal git, made up some blather about pauper''s drool
    off the top of her head. Prince Fulgencio listened carefully, scribbled some notes
    down with a biro in his filofax, remarked upon the Wise Woman''s resemblance to
    La Pilbeam, paid her with a pregnant pig he had found wandering disconsolate in
    the Weird Woods, and pranced princely and preening back to the palace.

    There, he commanded his loathsome servants Odo and Udo to scour the countryside
    collecting drool from paupers. In the teeth of the still-raging storm, they did
    so, returning many hours later with two brimming iron pails. The prince took the
    pails and swept in to the kitchen down in the basement of the palace, and called
    for Old Ma Blunkett, his cook, to prepare a tincture from the paupers'' drool,
    just as the Wise Woman had prescribed.

    Lightning flashed and thunder roared. Up in the playroom, still cowering behind
    the arras, the Infanta Gertrude was startled to receive a message on her metal
    tapping machine. It was from Professor Sigismundo, the wild-haired, wild-eyed
    boffin who had been banished from the princedom a year before, and who was now
    based at an important research laboratory far, far away. The Professor suggested
    to Gertrude that she get her laptop and look up his website, where she would find
    an essay subtitled Paupers'' Drool A Quack Potion And No Substitute For Rational
    Explanation When Emboldening Tiny Ones Terrified By Electrical Storms.

    Twilight descended with no let up in the ferocious tempest. The prince pranced
    into the playroom bearing a tray on which was set a brightly gleaming goblet containing
    a tincture of paupers'' drool, next to which lay some scraps of bandage pressed
    into service as pads with which to dab the tincture on to the forehead of the
    terrified quaking Infanta behind the arras. Yet she was gone!

    At midnight, the prince found his daughter at last. She was skipping, laughing,
    gambolling and giggling in the open fields behind the palace as thunderbolts crashed
    and lightning raked the heavens.

    And so never again did the Infanta Gertrude cower behind an arras during a thunderstorm,
    never again were Odo and Udo sent off with their iron pails to collect the drool
    of paupers, and never again did the prince believe a word he heard from the Wise
    Woman of the Weird Woods of Woobyhoobyhoo, who was, in any case, too busy with
    her team of pigs to twit the prancing prince from the crumbling palace in the
    faraway land of Gaar.'
