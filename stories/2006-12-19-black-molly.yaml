    This is a black molly which lives--happily, as we can see--in Claire''s Pond.
    I am honoured to tell you that it is called Frank, after your esteemed editor.
    Next time I go on holiday, Frank can take over the day to day running of Hooting
    Yard. We lack a certain piscine something at the moment, and I expect Frank will
    put that right.'
