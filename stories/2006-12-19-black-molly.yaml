  text: "\nThis is a black molly which lives\u2014happily, as we can see\u2014in Claire's\
    \ Pond. I am honoured to tell you that it is called Frank, after your esteemed\
    \ editor. Next time I go on holiday, Frank can take over the day to day running\
    \ of Hooting Yard. We lack a certain piscine something at the moment, and I expect\
    \ Frank will put that right."
