  text: 'At last! Say goodbye to lack-of-Hooting-Yard-paperback misery by clutching
    to your bosom a collection of fifty two stories lovingly collected together in
    book form! Now, you will be able to perch at the bedside of a pallid and sickly
    tot and never be at a loss for something to read by candlelight to the wan infant,
    in between mopping its brow and feeding it spoonfuls of milk of magnesia or some
    kind of fuming brain tonic.
