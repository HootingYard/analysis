  text: 'Hooting Yard crashes in to 2007 a month late and with a new format. The old
    pages--which of course you can still visit--had a certain ramshackle charm, but
    I''ve decided to use this standard blog format for a number of reasons. Better
    indexing, for one thing, and we all need indexes. Also I hope that readers will
    take full advantage of the Comments feature and spout their own twaddle to complement
    my own. Onwards and upwards! Here, for your delectation, is a picture sent to
    me by that scalliwag Max DA(c)charnA(c).
