  text: I was reading Electric Universe by David Bodanis, and was struck by his comment
    that Thomas Alva Edison spent an inordinate amount of his time working on plans
    for a concrete boat. It pleases me to learn that J L Lambot got there before him,
    in 1848. See A Short History Of Concrete.
