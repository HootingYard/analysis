  text: 'The world''s finest radio station, Resonance104.4FM, is in urgent need of
    funding. You can help the station remain on air by sponsoring next week''s Hooting
    Yard On The Air show, to be broadcast (live as ever) at 4.00 PM on Wednesday 14
    February. Here is how it works:

    1. Go to Resonance and donate a minimum of PS5.

    2. You may now choose a sentence, a phrase, a string of words, or a name to be
    incorporated into a specially-written story which will feature on next week''s
    show.

    3. Send your chosen words to me at hooting.yard@googlemail.com, and voila!, it''s
    as simple as that.

    4. After reading the story, I will recite the names of the donors (unless anonymity
    is preferred).

    5. Now follow Step 1, immediately!'
