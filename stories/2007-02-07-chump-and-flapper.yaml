  text: 'There was a chump and there was a flapper, and they sat in a rowing boat
    in the middle of a vast, vast lake. The lake was so big it might as well have
    been a sea, for neither the chump nor the flapper could see the shore. The chump
    thought he was fop, but the flapper knew she was a flapper.

    "I am a flapper," said the flapper, "and you are a chump."

    "I am not a chump," said the chump, insulted, "I am a fop."

    "Either way," said the flapper, "Hand me that oar. It is time we rowed home, for
    look!, the sun is setting, and if we do not row home we will be plunged into darkness
    out here in the middle of the vast, vast lake. Such a prospect gives me the collywobbles."

    Now you might protest that a world-weary demimondaine flapper is the last person
    in the world to get the collywobbles, and you would probably be correct. Be that
    as it may, the chump, being a chump, took her at her word, and handed her the
    oar, and grabbed hold of the other oar himself, and together they began to row.
    The flapper rowed with insouciant ease, and the chump rowed like a chump, that
    is to say, ineptly, so ineptly that instead of rowing home they rowed to the wrong
    side of the vast, vast lake. That is how the chump and the flapper found themselves,
    at nightfall, surrounded by a gaggle of murderous thugs lumbering about on the
    jetty of an ill-starred fishing village. There was much grunting from the thugs,
    most of whom were wielding clubs, and the clubs were spattered with blood and
    brains and the Lord knows what else.

    "I think it would be a good idea for you to essay a tad of chumpery to distract
    the thugs," said the flapper to the chump.

    "Surely you mean a tad of foppery?" protested the chump.

    "I mean what I say," snapped the flapper, "And be quick about it, or we will be
    bashed by brutes!"

    Wiping his hands on his plus-fours, the chump was about to engage in diverting
    chumpery when a police car screeched into view behind the murderous thugs, and
    out stepped Detective Inspector Cargpan! Yes, the so-called "spindly copper" had
    not, after all, plummeted to his doom over a waterfall in some Ruritanian princedom,
    for he was here, in this godforsaken fishing village, accompanied as usual by
    his troika of deceptively diffident bloodhounds, Bim, Bam, and Ubuntu!

    Thus, on a moonlit jetty, ended the criminal careers of the chump and the flapper.
    Cargpan placed them in manacles and bundled them into the boot of his car, before
    driving off at inhuman speed up into the hills, leaving the thugs to smash the
    rowing boat, and the rowing boat''s oars, to smithereens.'
