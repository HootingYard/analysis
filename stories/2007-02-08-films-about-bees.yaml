  text: 'One of the most eagerly-anticipated awards in the arts calendar is Hooting
    Yard''s Best Title Of A Film About Bees Made Within The Last Five Years. We only
    make this award after a rigorous selection process, fuelled by many, many cups
    of piping hot tea in Mrs Gubbins'' space-age kitchenette parlour.

    I am delighted to announce that the 2007 Award goes to William Bishop-Stephens
    for Bee Control In City Parks. He wins a toffee apple with bite marks which, a
    dentist tells me, could well have been made by fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol
    immediately after he won the 1966 Blister Lane Bypass Sprint Hurdles Cup And Saucer
    in a then record time of eight hours, sixteen minutes and forty-four seconds.

    Well done, Will, and I am sure all Hooting Yard readers will take the opportunity
    to watch your splendid film.'
