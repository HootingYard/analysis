  text: 'Last week we held a funeral service for the parish wolf, although none of
    us is sure if it is really dead. Its howling has not been heard for twelve years,
    though, and under our laws a death certificate can be issued for a missing wolf
    after just five years. The general feeling in the parish was summed up by the
    sexton in a notice nailed, Luther fashion, to the door of the church. Even in
    the absence of a corpse, it would be for the good of the parish if obsequies were
    held. This was the gist of his notice, though it was couched in the mighty prose
    he deployed even when writing nature notes for the parish newsletter, and he did
    not on any account use the word closure.

    One reason the sexton is so persuasive is that his appearance and bearing are
    strongly reminiscent of the actor James Robertson Justice (1907-1975). This is
    no accident. Over the years, the sexton has worked hard to imitate that booming
    voice, and he has undergone cosmetic surgery the better to ape the appearance
    of the man who, when not appearing in films, kept busy as a naturalist, racing
    driver, and falconry expert.


    Before dawn on the morning of the funeral there was a teeming downpour. The rain
    had ceased by the time we gathered in the churchyard, but the pugton trees were
    drenched, water droplets dripping from the tiny grey spongy buds, each bud like
    the brain of a homunculus. An extraordinary number of puddles had formed on the
    paths, and there are many paths converging on St Bibblydibdib''s, for it is the
    only church for miles around, all others having been smashed to ruination by the
    sexton''s predecessor, single-handedly. He was twice the size of the present incumbent,
    a titan among sextons, and a brute, and the parish has been much quieter since
    he wilted away and was carted off to a mercy home. No ducks plashed in the puddles,
    for word had not yet reached them that the parish wolf was dead, or at least thought
    to be dead, and no duck dared come near for fear of being torn to bits.

    I had been asked to read the obsequies, and had prepared what I thought was a
    pretty speech. I have a weakness for alliteration, and made use of lots of W words,
    describing the parish wolf as winsome and windswept and waterlogged and wiry and
    woebegone and witless. There was little truth in any of this, for the signal fact
    about the wolf was that it was, for the most part, invisible. Kim Fat Goo, the
    village bus driver, claimed to have seen it crossing the road once or twice, and
    the preposterous tabloid astrologer Jonathan Cainer, who once spent a week holed
    up in Old Ma Brimstone''s Bed And Breakfast establishment, said that the wolf
    paid him nocturnal visits in his dingy room, but few of us gave these tales any
    credence. Yet despite remaining unseen, the wolf was--or had been--a mighty presence
    in our parish, and I felt it deserved a memorable send-off, with all those W words,
    even if what I said was inaccurate.

    Our vicar had been abducted by a cadre of rogue Tundists and was tied up in a
    turret somewhere, so the sexton took charge of the service. When it came my turn
    to speak, no sooner had I propped my notepad on the lectern and cleared my throat
    than there came a bellowing of cows from the fields adjoining the church. My words
    were drowned out. The cows bellowed all day and all night and into the next day,
    for they were Mad Old Farmer Frack''s cows, and there were hundreds of them, massive
    and ungainly and bellowing. The funeral broke up in disarray, and we repaired
    to a hangar at the village airfield, and we ate cake and macadamia nuts under
    the shadow of gigantic propellers, and when we emerged, look!, ducks populated
    the puddles. The parish wolf was dead and gone.'
