  text: 'Here is an outdoor game for all the family. After singing lustily at the
    Sunday service, and having a little chat with the vicar on the church steps, you
    should repair to a patch of waste ground, taking with you a couple of battered
    iron pails, an unopened packet of processed cheese triangles, and some strips
    of bark from a pugton tree. Each family member should don a red balaclava, apart
    from the tiniest one, who goes bare-headed. One side of the patch of waste ground
    is designated Nobby Stiles. The opposite side is consecrated to David Blunkett.
    The object of the game is to get from Stiles to Blunkett as directly as possible,
    cleanly and without undue dithering. If the patch of waste ground is assailed
    by inclement weather, for instance a howling gale, a teeming downpour, or thunder
    and lightning, the family may be accompanied by beetle-browed urchins from beyond
    the railway tracks. Use counters and a tally stick to keep score.
