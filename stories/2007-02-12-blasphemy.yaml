  text: 'There is another flurry of outrage, in Cambridge this time, because someone
    has published a picture of a seventh-century mystic. Apparently, it is absolutely
    forbidden to draw pictures of "the prophet Mohammed", as the mystic is known.
    (I worry about that definite article, as I''m sure there have been other prophets
    from time to time.) Back in September 2006 (scroll down to Blodgett''s Jihad)
    we published a picture of this fellow, and it seems like a good idea to reprint
    it now, if only to remind readers just how outrageous such depictions are. When
    you have stopped quaking with fury--and outrage, of course--you can go and read
    this.
