  text: "There is another flurry of outrage, in Cambridge this time, because someone\
    \ has published a picture of a seventh-century mystic. Apparently, it is absolutely\
    \ forbidden to draw pictures of \u201Cthe prophet Mohammed\u201D, as the mystic\
    \ is known. (I worry about that definite article, as I'm sure there have been\
    \ other prophets from time to time.) Back in September 2006 (scroll down to Blodgett's\
    \ Jihad) we published a picture of this fellow, and it seems like a good idea\
    \ to reprint it now, if only to remind readers just how outrageous such depictions\
    \ are. When you have stopped quaking with fury\u2014and outrage, of course\u2014\
    you can go and read this.\n"
