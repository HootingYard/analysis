  text: 'It is with some trepidation that I announce an imminent court case. For a
    long time I turned a blind eye to the continued boasts of the L''Oreal company
    that some of their shiny hair products are enhanced by Light Reflecting Booster
    Technology. I am appalled that they continue to make this claim in their television
    adverts despite numerous letters urging them to desist. Well, I have been provoked
    far enough. Here at Hooting Yard we will be suing L''Oreal for infringement of
    intellectual property rights. Regular readers will be aware that every single
    word that appears on this website, and every word broadcast in the associated
    podcasts, could not have been wrenched from the innermost depths of Mr Key''s
    soul without Hooting Yard''s very own Light Reflecting Booster Technology. We
    got there first, L''Oreal!

    P.S. : If anyone can recommend a suitably shabby and cheap solicitor, please get
    in touch. Because I''m worth it.'
