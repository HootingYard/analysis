  text: "It is with some trepidation that I announce an imminent court case. For a\
    \ long time I turned a blind eye to the continued boasts of the L'Oreal company\
    \ that some of their shiny hair products are enhanced by Light Reflecting Booster\
    \ Technology. I am appalled that they continue to make this claim in their television\
    \ adverts despite numerous letters urging them to desist. Well, I have been provoked\
    \ far enough. Here at Hooting Yard we will be suing L'Oreal for infringement of\
    \ intellectual property rights. Regular readers will be aware that every single\
    \ word that appears on this website, and every word broadcast in the associated\
    \ podcasts, could not have been wrenched from the innermost depths of Mr Key's\
    \ soul without Hooting Yard's very own Light Reflecting Booster Technology. We\
    \ got there first, L'Oreal!\nP.S.\_: If anyone can recommend a suitably shabby\
    \ and cheap solicitor, please get in touch. Because I'm worth it."
