  text: 'The great Carl Sagan, in The Demon-Haunted World : "Occasionally, a vegetable
    or a pattern of wood grain or the hide of a cow resembles a human face. There
    was a celebrated eggplant that closely resembled Richard M Nixon. What shall we
    deduce from this fact?" I won''t continue with the quotation, but it may be worth
    posing the question: What can we deduce from the fact that I am obsessed with
    Nixon--to an extent I had never quite realised? Soon, inevitably, I shall have
    to drum up a recipe for eggplant and mashed potato.'
