  text: '[This story was written as part of a fundraising drive for ResonanceFM, and
    broadcast today on Hooting Yard On The Air. Listeners were invited, in return
    for a donation, to provide a sentence, a phrase, a string of words or a name which
    was then incorporated into the text. A list of those who so generously handed
    over their cash follows at the end.]

    "Ice Chaos" was the headline in one of the newspapers last week. This followed
    a day when the unthinkable happened. A flurry of snow, that settled for about
    twenty four hours, in the winter, in Britain (a country in the northern hemisphere)!
    Chaos indeed. Or perhaps just a cold snap.

    It''s true, though, that extreme or freakish weather conditions seem to be on
    the increase. There were tornadoes in London, Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami...
    (Incidentally, let us take this opportunity to recall the name of a seismologist
    involved in lack-of-tsunami warnings, Waverly Person.)

    Now, it has been pointed out to me more than once that I am hardly qualified to
    talk about extreme weather conditions, as the only weather we get at Hooting Yard
    is rain, sometimes torrential, sometimes a drizzle, and this is true. What my
    critics fail to note is that, ensconced in a cabin somewhere over by Blister Lane
    Bypass, we have a superb forecaster. I speak, of course, of Little Severin, the
    Mystic Badger. When it comes to predicting the weather, Little Severin is second
    to none, not even to the BBC''s magnificent Dan Corbett. If you have not watched
    Dan, visit That''s The Weather For Now and be amazed. Little Severin the Mystic
    Badger has not yet been blessed with a fan site all his own, but it can only be
    a matter of time.

    Before we go on, I want to make it absolutely plain that there is neither a jot
    nor scintilla of truth in the rumours that have been flying around. Little Severin
    did not pass through the catflap to the afterlife. In any case, he would have
    eschewed a catflap and sought a more appropriate badgerflap. Flaps for badgers,
    and indeed for stoats, pigs, wild hogs, otters and curlews, some of which are
    flaps to the afterlife and some not, are easily available, for example from Zip
    Nolan''s Flappery in Basoonclotshire. (That spelling is correct, as the name of
    the shire derives from basins, not from bassoons.)

    Little Severin''s method of weather divination is simple yet brilliant. He is
    not known as the Mystic Badger for nothing. At various times of day or night,
    he emerges from his cabin and scrubbles around in the muck, like badgers do. Then
    he goes back indoors. Voila! Those able to read the omens and portents of his
    scrubbling know whether tomorrow will bring rain, downpour, or drizzle, and not
    only that, for Little Severin can predict more than just the weather. Few people
    are aware that he forecast both the Cod Wars between Britain and Iceland, which
    lasted for seventeen years, and the Corned Beef Wars between Ireland and Argentina,
    which lasted thirty, among many other world-shaking events. As far as I am aware
    there have not yet been any Oregano Wars. Bear in mind that a number of Little
    Severin''s predictions are retrospective, for as his name implies, he is only
    little. And mystic.

    It is the mysticism which so upset Braithwaite, the one-time bus-seat companion
    of Clytemnestra Duggleby. It was Braithwaite, with his pipe, his face, his cheese,
    his keys, his rissoles, his cup, his roll-on-roll-off rim-fire thiamin, and that
    lip on him, the lip and the sculptured boy-hair, Braithwaite who called into question
    the accuracy of Little Severin the Mystic Badger''s paw-scrubbling weather forecasts.
    But what did he know? As Clytemnestra Duggleby attested in court after the incident
    with the wheezing scrivener and the invalid postscript font, he spent most of
    his time slumped in front of the radio, like some antediluvian beast, listening
    distractedly to The Sagans, (or Les Sagans) a long-running serial about husband-and-wife
    team Carl and Francoise and their thrills, spills, window sills and gas bills
    as they bring up their papoose Boo Boo. The show''s theme tune features the papoose
    Boo Boo singing "Meinen Mootzenzimmer" backed by an orchestra of massed banjos
    and ducks with electronic implants. Clytemnestra hated the drama, but adored the
    music, and hummed it as she went about her many and various janitorial doings
    in the town aquarium. It was a submerged aquarium, hewn out of the geological
    strata underneath the abandoned zoo, and it was rife with weird tentacled aquatic
    beings (actual size) including squid. According to the aquarium guidebook, "Squids
    are mammals, just like plants and clouds", for the book had been compiled by Zip
    Nolan (he of the Flappery) in a break from writing his pot-boiler series of animal-flap
    related thrillers such as Creepy Raoul And The Partridgeflap, Creepy Raoul And
    The Beeflap (serialised in Harpy magazine), and the million-selling Creepy Raoul
    And The Ineffable Mystery Of The Pentecostalist Cormorantflap, which famously
    begins "Rendered placid by the sickening stifle, this cumbersome vision of Britney
    lolled like some spastic hound, a revolutionary Lolita trying in vain to calm
    my wayward reflexes". Quite why Zip accepted the commission to compile the guidebook
    is as much a mystery as one of his thrillers, for he was no lover of waterworld--and
    I am not talking about the Kevin Costner film. Zip was a dry land sort of person,
    so much so that he avoided ponds and puddles, and made daily treks all the way
    from his Flappery in Basoonclotshire to consult with Little Severin The Mystic
    Badger about the weather, the weather, the weather.

    Ah yes, the weather. Rainfall, wild winds, ice chaos. Cool-a-stoop and a heary
    blear, thunderstorms, tornadoes, forked lightning, slush and frost and winter
    sunlight, Dan Corbett, and Little Severin, the Mystic Badger.

    Cage (also an anagram), Sandra Harris, Carolina Herbst, Lancton, Outaspaceman,
    Michael Pierce, Marvin Suicide, Chris Weaver, and others who wished to remain
    anonymous, which, as it begins with A, ought to have been at the beginning of
    the list, but wasn''t. I am pretty sure I have not forgotten anyone, but if I
    have, my profound apologies.]
