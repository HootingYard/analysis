  text: 'Pansy Cradledew bought a new kettle recently. Tempting though it is to use
    this as an excuse to regale you with my all-encompassing kettle theories--and
    believe me, you will be impressed--I''d like instead to say a few words about
    the particular make of kettle Ms Cradledew purchased.

    There is an egg-shaped window in the side of the kettle which enables the pleased-as-punch
    kettle owner to see at a glance the water level of the water that has been poured
    out of a tap or spigot into the kettle. It may be argued that I could rewrite
    that sentence so that it is less ungainly and doesn''t mention the kettle three
    times, but I want to be absolutely clear and I am writing in a rush. There is
    a pot of tea to be brewed, and I cannot type and make tea at the same time. You
    try it, and see how difficult it is.

    When the power is on, but the kettle is switched off, that is, when it is plugged
    in to the wall socket and the wall socket is switched on but the kettle remains
    in its default, at rest, idle state, an internal light is activated, and through
    the egg-shaped window the excited kettle owner sees a blue glow. This has the
    effect of making the water look not unlike a tropical sea, or at least a tiny
    portion of such a sea, on a blazing hot summer day--no small benefit when one
    lives in a land of ice chaos.

    Depress the switch underneath the kettle''s handle, however, and the blue glow
    is instantly transformed into a glow that is bright red. The kettle is now on,
    and begins to boil the water which was poured into it from the tap, or spigot.
    Gradually, it begins to bubble. As it approaches boiling point, the combination
    of seething, bubbling water and a blood-red glow makes it look like a scene from
    hell. Satan''s spa!

    I may write about further kitchen-based excitements at a later date, but now it
    is time for that pot of tea.'
