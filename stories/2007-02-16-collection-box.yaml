  text: "Here is another opportunity for readers to help save ResonanceFM. Let me\
    \ just point out that the station's financial circumstances are dismal and Your\
    \ Help Is Needed.\nA collection of rarities by (or including) your favourite Hooting\
    \ Yardist is going up for auction. Many of these items predate the Wilderness\
    \ Years (1993\u20132002), and this may be your only chance to obtain such gems\
    \ as Sidney The Bat Is Awarded The Order Of Lenin.\nSo get out your wallet and\
    \ make your bid!\nUPDATE\_: The closing date is 21st February at 11.59 a.m. and\
    \ the current highest bid is \xA3120.\nFURTHER UPDATE\_: The winning bid was \xC2\
    \xA3150, and the lucky recipient was someone using the pseudonym \u2018mustardplaster\u2019\
    . Many thanks to them, on behalf of Resonance."
