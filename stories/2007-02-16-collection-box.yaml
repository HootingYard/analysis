  text: 'Here is another opportunity for readers to help save ResonanceFM. Let me
    just point out that the station''s financial circumstances are dismal and Your
    Help Is Needed.

    A collection of rarities by (or including) your favourite Hooting Yardist is going
    up for auction. Many of these items predate the Wilderness Years (1993-2002),
    and this may be your only chance to obtain such gems as Sidney The Bat Is Awarded
    The Order Of Lenin.

    So get out your wallet and make your bid!

    UPDATE : The closing date is 21st February at 11.59 a.m. and the current highest
    bid is PS120.

    FURTHER UPDATE : The winning bid was APS150, and the lucky recipient was someone
    using the pseudonym ''mustardplaster''. Many thanks to them, on behalf of Resonance.'
