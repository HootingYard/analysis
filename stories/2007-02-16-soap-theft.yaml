  text: "More from Carl Sagan's excellent The Demon-Haunted World. He tells us that,\
    \ according to alien abductee Betty Hill, the pesky visitors from outer space\
    \ \u201Cfrequently help themselves to some of [the abductee's] belongings, such\
    \ as fishing rods, jewelry of different types, eyeglasses or a cup of laundry\
    \ soap\u201D.\nRemember that, and next time you see a myopic angler festooned\
    \ with rings and necklaces emerging from the launderette, you can make a citizen's\
    \ arrest and cart it off to your secret underground lab."
