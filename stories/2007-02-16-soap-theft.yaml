  text: 'More from Carl Sagan''s excellent The Demon-Haunted World. He tells us that,
    according to alien abductee Betty Hill, the pesky visitors from outer space "frequently
    help themselves to some of [the abductee''s] belongings, such as fishing rods,
    jewelry of different types, eyeglasses or a cup of laundry soap".

    Remember that, and next time you see a myopic angler festooned with rings and
    necklaces emerging from the launderette, you can make a citizen''s arrest and
    cart it off to your secret underground lab.'
