  text: 'One morning Tiny Enid awoke from uneasy dreams with a sense of tremendous
    urgency related to potatoes. She was based in Winnipeg at the time, and had taken
    a room in a motel of undoubted seediness. "I could not pinpoint the reasons for
    my sense of breathless urgency on that grim March morning," she wrote, many years
    later, in her Memoirs, "All I knew was that potatoes had something to do with
    it."

    The heroic young adventuress eschewed the motel breakfast, a Winnipeg-style egg
    ''n'' dough platter, sneaking out of a side entrance to avoid the man with the
    twisted lip at the front desk. The city was still new to her, and she had yet
    to locate any of the potato-related premises she felt such a tremendous urgency
    to visit. She limped across the plaza to her rented booster car and threw off
    its tarpaulin in one elegant sweep. Tiny Enid had been practising her elegant
    sweeping arm movements for some weeks, and the superb elegance with which she
    swept the tarpaulin off the car won her a round of applause from a nearby line
    of patient pastry persons queuing outside a pastry shop.

    Before revving up the engine of her booster car, Tiny Enid tramped over to the
    queue. She wanted to find out if she would sense an aura of potato urgency here,
    so close to her motel. It was possible, after all, that among the pastries sold
    by the pastry shop could be pastries with a potato filling. Was that urgency that
    cracked her awake a premonition that a Winnipeg-based criminal mad person had
    poisoned the potato pastries? If so, it would make sense for her to be bang on
    the scene rather than having to speed around the city, lost, unnerved, and not
    knowing quite what she was seeking, nor why. So many of the adventures of the
    tiny adventuress had begun from these moments of curious intuition.

    But it was still early in the day, and the pastry shop proprietor had not yet
    hoisted the shutters, hence the queue. Tiny Enid was hopeless at small talk, and
    she was at a loss how to engage with the still-clapping queue which was so impressed
    with the elegance of her sweeping arm movements. She pulled her sprightly black
    gold green crushed crepe hat down low, and pretended an interest in pebbles piled
    close to the pastry shop shutters. If her instincts were correct, she must be
    first into the shop when the shutters went up, before a poor innocent Winnipegite
    was felled by a poisoned potato pastry pie. Tiny Enid was a girl of impeccable
    manners, and she flushed with shame in anticipation of having to push aside the
    unkempt hobbledehoy who was first in the queue and who looked as if he had not
    eaten for a month.

    Luckily, as the pastry shop proprietor appeared with a hook on the end of a wooden
    pole with which by some shenanigans he hoisted the shutters, there was a distraction.
    Over by the statue of prominent Winnipegite Elias Conklin, who had been the city''s
    mayor in 1881, a swarm of killer bees appeared out of the blue and set upon a
    defenceless old woman wearing her widow''s weeds. The massed buzzing of the bees
    was nauseatingly loud, and the reaction of the pastry shop queue was instantaneous.
    Even the starving hobbledehoy forgot his grumbling belly as the line broke up,
    sprinting over to the Conklin statue flailing impromptu bee-scarifiers.

    Our tiny heroine took the opportunity to sneak into the pastry shop. Thumping
    the proprietor in the guts with her girly bludgeon, she incapacitated him with
    a few kicks to the head, swiftly located behind the counter every single piping
    hot pastry with a potato ingredient, and stuffed the lot of them into a canvas
    sack. She dragged the sack over to her rented booster car, chucked it into the
    boot, and sped away, just in time, for the killer bees had been confounded, the
    widow woman was safe, and the patient pastry people were heading back to the pastry
    shop with coinage clutched in their fists.

    An hour or so later, having dumped the canvas sack of potato pastries into the
    river at the Forks, where the Red River meets the Assiniboine, and then driven
    around until she found verdant parkland, Tiny Enid slumped onto a tuffet, dusted
    off her sprightly black gold green crushed crepe hat, and lit one of her high
    tar Paraguayan cigarettes. Soon, she knew, she would have to hunt down the criminal
    mad person and bash them about, but for now, the world could take a pause, and
    she could sit on her tuffet and smoke and watch the coots and moorhens for whom
    a Winnipeg pond was home.'
