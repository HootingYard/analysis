  text: 'Today is a very special day at Hooting Yard. It''s Yoko Ono''s 74th birthday.
    Just as the people of Tanna, in Vanuatu in the South West Pacific, worship the
    Duke of Edinburgh as a god, we here at Hooting Yard recognise the divinity of
    Yoko.

    Our devotion took a bit of a battering a few years ago when Mrs Gubbins dallied
    with Yokonetics, but a course of brain-sluicing with Baxter''s Terrible Fluid
    and a visit from Yoko''s lawyer set her back on the true path.

    If anyone wants me, I shall be spending this special day in that field near Blister
    Lane Bypass, sitting in a bag with wool wrapped round my legs, screaming.
