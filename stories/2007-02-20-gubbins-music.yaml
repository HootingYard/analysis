  text: "If you hear news from Haemoglobin Towers that birds are dropping dead from\
    \ the sky and cows stand stunned in the fields, it can mean only one thing. Alas,\
    \ Mrs Gubbins has a new musical fad. The octogenarian crone has taken her dusty\
    \ hi fi system down from the shelf, opened the windows, and is blasting out the\
    \ latest acquisitions from her record collection, day and night, over and over\
    \ again.\nLast time this happened, her undiluted enthusiasm for The Fall meant\
    \ that the peasants thereabouts had to put up with the complete works of Mark\
    \ E Smith cranked out at ear-splitting volume for weeks on end. La Gubbins only\
    \ grew tired of the self-styled \u201CNorthern white crap that talks back\u201D\
    \ after it was pointed out to her that Smith is slowly but surely turning into\
    \ Anthony Burgess\u2014Mancunian, drunk on words, and frighteningly prolific,\
    \ of course, but the most compelling evidence is the physical resemblance.\n\n\
    La Gubbins had always harboured a deep if irrational hatred of Burgess, so she\
    \ burned all her Fall records on a pyre and silence reigned. But now she has discovered\
    \ the work of Swiss maestro Blinky Guido, laid her hands on every single record\
    \ he ever made, and is in the throes of madness. Hence the dead birds and the\
    \ stunned cows.\nBlinky Guido will be known to some of you as the man who created\
    \ prog-wop, an unholy alliance of progressive rock and doo-wop which some enlightened\
    \ lands have made illegal. You may have sat through the full twenty-minute horror\
    \ that is Why Do Fools Fall In Love In The Magic Kingdom Of Elves or, even worse,\
    \ These Little Eldritch Unicorns Of Mine. Someone swears they saw Mrs Gubbins\
    \ smuggling a mellotron into her room the other day, which doesn't bear thinking\
    \ about.\nPerhaps the only way to bring an end to this nightmare is to doctor\
    \ a photograph of the Swiss prog-wop pioneer to make him look like J B Priestley,\
    \ another writer who elicits from Mrs Gubbins a strangulated cry of loathing."
