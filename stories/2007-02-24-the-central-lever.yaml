  text: '"The days of pulling the central lever are behind us"--Hazel Blears, quoted
    in The Guardian, 23 February 2007

    Readers of a certain age will remember the levers. There was a row of them, colour-coded,
    black and pink and orange and cerise and yellow and golden and dun and red and
    lavender and green and mauve and coffee and blue and wheat and white. They had
    to be pulled in a precise order, of course, which changed from hour to hour. It
    was not well-paid work, being a lever pulling person, but it was dignified and
    responsible and important work, and those who pulled the levers were accorded
    due respect. And none gained as much respect as the puller of the central lever,
    the only one which changed colour, or rather was wrapped in burlap sheaths of
    different colours, hour by hour, and sometimes minute by minute, by dint of a
    scheme so abstruse, so utterly bewildering, that those responsible for it rarely
    lasted more than a couple of months in the job before they had to be retired off
    to a seaside resort. Pebblehead''s bestselling paperback They Selected The Burlap
    Sheaths For The Central Lever : True Stories Of Heroic Colour-Coding is a useful,
    if failed, attempt to demystify the whole shenanigans in words of one syllable.

    It is sometimes hard to comprehend just how important the levers were. Nowadays,
    we are able to live happy and fulfilling lives without them, without the relentless
    pulling of them... or so it seems. I have my doubts. It is not mere nostalgia
    that makes me hanker for the days when the pulling of the levers, and particularly
    the pulling of the central lever, was uppermost in people''s minds, drawing us
    together, binding us, giving us a sense of common purpose.

    Blodgett always remembered his time as the puller of the central lever as the
    happiest period of his life. His enemies said--still say!--that he only did the
    job for the free toffee apples, and normally one would agree. I have had stern
    words to say about Blodgettian gluttony myself, but for once I think his motives
    were pure. After an apprenticeship on the golden and pink levers, he stepped up
    to the central lever pulling position on St Gertrude''s Day in 1952, and none
    who saw it will ever forget the beam of fantastic glee on his pockmarked and greasy
    face as he stood there, on his plinth, as the duty cadet swapped a blue for a
    slightly different shade of blue dyed burlap sheath on the central lever. The
    flock of trained nightingales on the railings burst into joyous song. Fiery stars
    flamed in the sky. Blodgett waited for the parp of a cornet which would be his
    signal to pull the central lever for the first time. Just thinking about it makes
    me want to weep, so please forgive my snufflings, as I forgive those who snuffle
    before me.

    Who would have thought that Blodgett would be the last person ever to pull the
    central lever? He did so for many, many years of course, with gusto and vim, to
    the applause of those who were, very occasionally, allowed past the railings to
    watch. But came the day that the pulling of the levers, the black and pink and
    orange and cerise and yellow and golden and dun and red and lavender and green
    and mauve and coffee and blue and wheat and white ones, as well as the central
    lever, became somehow irrelevant to our town, mocked even, seen as an antiquated
    and idiotic ritual. And Blodgett and the others were paid off with a crate of
    toffee apples and given free cabins in the hills, and the levers rusted, the burlap
    sheaths were left to rot, the nightingale trainer was taken to a quarry and shot
    by the new regime, and one day gigantic bellowing engines came and flattened the
    square where the levers and the railings had stood for a hundred years, and it
    was all gone.

    After-comers cannot guess the beauty been. An evaporated milk factory was built
    on the spot, indecently fast, and I watch children cycle round and round it, and
    I shout at them, and wave my bludgeon, and they cycle round and round and round.'
