  text: "Tiny Enid knew how vitally important it is to take an afternoon nap. Because\
    \ she was so often engaged in thrilling adventures, which usually involved kicking\
    \ someone's head in, she did not always find it easy to lull herself to sleep.\
    \ As this rare picture shows, she was as resourceful a girl when it came to naps\
    \ as she was when bashing up Prince Fulgencio's evil henchmen.\n\nSuspension Chloriforeene\
    \ from the State Library of Victoria, via Boynton\n\_"
