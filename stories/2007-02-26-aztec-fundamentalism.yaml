  text: "Ye gods and little fishes! It seems you can't breathe a word about religion\
    \ these days without being deemed \u201Coffensive\u201D. Yesterday's piece A Weekend\
    \ With An Owl God brought to my postbag a letter from Stephen Atahualpagreen of\
    \ Aztec Voice:\nDear Mr Key\_: I am writing to protest in the strongest possible\
    \ terms about your slanderous treatment of the Aztec faith. Traducing the name\
    \ of our night owl god Chalchiuhtecolotl in such disgusting terms is not funny.\
    \ It is deeply offensive to our most cherished beliefs. Like any other religion,\
    \ the Aztec faith demands respect in 21st century Britain, which means, among\
    \ other things, respecting our cultural right to practice a bloody form of human\
    \ sacrifice on big stone altars. As well as feeling wounded and offended, your\
    \ attack has also made us angry, and you know what happens when the gods get angry.\
    \ Please send me your postal address and telephone number so I can publish them\
    \ on our website and provoke other Aztec believers to exact the retribution which\
    \ is your due fate.\nI did a bit of research into Mr Atahualpagreen. Apparently\
    \ he sends his children to an Aztec faith school and has successfully applied\
    \ for government funding to set up something called the Aztec Human Rights Commission."
