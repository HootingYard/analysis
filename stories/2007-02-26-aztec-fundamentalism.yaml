  text: 'Ye gods and little fishes! It seems you can''t breathe a word about religion
    these days without being deemed "offensive". Yesterday''s piece A Weekend With
    An Owl God brought to my postbag a letter from Stephen Atahualpagreen of Aztec
    Voice:

    Dear Mr Key : I am writing to protest in the strongest possible terms about your
    slanderous treatment of the Aztec faith. Traducing the name of our night owl god
    Chalchiuhtecolotl in such disgusting terms is not funny. It is deeply offensive
    to our most cherished beliefs. Like any other religion, the Aztec faith demands
    respect in 21st century Britain, which means, among other things, respecting our
    cultural right to practice a bloody form of human sacrifice on big stone altars.
    As well as feeling wounded and offended, your attack has also made us angry, and
    you know what happens when the gods get angry. Please send me your postal address
    and telephone number so I can publish them on our website and provoke other Aztec
    believers to exact the retribution which is your due fate.

    I did a bit of research into Mr Atahualpagreen. Apparently he sends his children
    to an Aztec faith school and has successfully applied for government funding to
    set up something called the Aztec Human Rights Commission.'
