  text: 'Untold numbers of Hooting Yard readers have been writing in with a single
    demand. What we expect, Mr Key, they all say, is regular lobster diagrams! We
    know what we want and we want them weekly! Whether this is a true reflection of
    the popular will or a sinister campaign to divert us from our important work I
    cannot say. As a sop to the protesters, however, here is a lobster diagram. You
    will note that it emphasises the location of the lobster''s brain, which is, incidentally,
    the subject of Pebblehead''s latest bestselling paperback, The Location Of The
    Lobster''s Brain.
