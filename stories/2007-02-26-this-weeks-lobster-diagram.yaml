  text: "Untold numbers of Hooting Yard readers have been writing in with a single\
    \ demand. What we expect, Mr Key, they all say, is regular lobster diagrams! We\
    \ know what we want and we want them weekly! Whether this is a true reflection\
    \ of the popular will or a sinister campaign to divert us from our important work\
    \ I cannot say. As a sop to the protesters, however, here is a lobster diagram.\
    \ You will note that it emphasises the location of the lobster's brain, which\
    \ is, incidentally, the subject of Pebblehead's latest bestselling paperback,\
    \ The Location Of The Lobster's Brain.\n\n "
