  text: 'There was a heroic bus driver, and his name was Kim Fat Goo. He drove his
    bus through puddles. He drove it straight and true, though he swerved if he saw
    a duck or a pig or an infant human tiny or a succubus or an incubus as he steered
    towards the briny. He drove his bus across Pointy Town, heading for the sea. At
    the beach he stopped to let passengers off and he drank a flask of tea. Oh, Kim
    Fat Goo he drained his flask and he tipped the dregs in the sand, and he idled
    awhile on the promenade and he watched a spaceship land. Out poured a gaggle of
    alien beings with flippers and antennae and claws and flagrant disregard for the
    rubric of Pointy Town laws.

    "We are an invasion force from the Planet of Contaminated Wheat. We are starveling
    spacemen and we need something to eat."

    "I will drive you to the pie shop," said fearless Kim Fat Goo, "Get on the bus
    and sit quietly till we reach the pie shop queue."

    But he drove his bus up into the hills to a hermit''s abandoned hut, and he lured
    the invading spacemen in and sealed the doorway shut. So Kim Fat Goo the bus driver
    was the saviour of Pointy Town, and that is why his name rings out with imperishable
    renown.'
