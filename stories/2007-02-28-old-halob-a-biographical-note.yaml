  text: "Before winning fame\u2014or perhaps notoriety\u2014as the coach of fictional\
    \ athlete Bobnit Tivol, the chain-smoking miseryguts we know and love as Old Halob\
    \ led a purposeless and indigent existence. The familiar image of him, in that\
    \ raincoat, grim and windswept and coughing up catarrh, standing at the side of\
    \ a running track spurring his fictional prot\xE9g\xE9 on to ever greater sprinting\
    \ triumphs, had not yet been beamed through television screens across the globe\
    \ back in the days when only a cluster of hovels stood on the site that would\
    \ one day become the Old Halob Stadium Of Sporting Triumph And Prowess.\nIn his\
    \ bestselling paperback Old Halob And Petula Clark\_: Are They The Same Person?,\
    \ Pebblehead posits the theory that the (possibly) East European coach and the\
    \ English songstress are the same person. He points to the well-documented fact\
    \ that both, as children, sang in the entrance hall of Bentalls Department Store\
    \ in Kingston-upon-Thames in exchange for a tin of toffee and a gold wristwatch.\
    \ In addition, like Petula Clark, Old Halob released a CD entitled L'essentiel\u2014\
    20 Succ\xC3\xA8s Inoubliables. This is where his argument fails to convince, for\
    \ where the aged pop diva's album contained songs, and was a chart hit in Belgium,\
    \ Old Halob's CD consisted of a recording of him eating his breakfast and grumbling\
    \ about his moth-eaten raincoat, and was an international, rather than merely\
    \ a local, success.\nPebblehead's twaddle is thoroughly demolished, of course,\
    \ if we consider that for the first fifty two years of his life, Old Halob did\
    \ little except refill bird feeders in the grounds of a Home for the Deranged,\
    \ a job for which he was paid with a daily bowl of gruel and slops. His parents\
    \ were fabulously wealthy, and lived the life of Riley in a big forbidding castle,\
    \ but their son lacked ambition, and they disowned him when, at the age of nine,\
    \ he rejected their birthday gifts of a booster pack, the elixir of life, a modelling\
    \ contract with L'Oreal, and a populated planet in a far distant galaxy to treat\
    \ as his plaything.\nNo one, not even Pebblehead, knows what happened to transform\
    \ the dull-witted bird feeder maintenance man into an athletics coach of legend.\
    \ Perhaps a clue lies in his change of diet. Shortly after Old Halob's fiftieth\
    \ birthday, the management of the Derangement Home was restructured following\
    \ a report from consultants Pricewatergatecoopersfreemanhardywillis. As part of\
    \ their recommendations, Old Halob stopped eating gruel and slops and was instead\
    \ fed on whelks and barnacles. The evidence is not conclusive, but future biographers\
    \ would be stupid to ignore it.\nAnd that is all I have to say about Old Halob\
    \ today."
