  text: 'Before winning fame--or perhaps notoriety--as the coach of fictional athlete
    Bobnit Tivol, the chain-smoking miseryguts we know and love as Old Halob led a
    purposeless and indigent existence. The familiar image of him, in that raincoat,
    grim and windswept and coughing up catarrh, standing at the side of a running
    track spurring his fictional protege on to ever greater sprinting triumphs, had
    not yet been beamed through television screens across the globe back in the days
    when only a cluster of hovels stood on the site that would one day become the
    Old Halob Stadium Of Sporting Triumph And Prowess.

    In his bestselling paperback Old Halob And Petula Clark : Are They The Same Person?,
    Pebblehead posits the theory that the (possibly) East European coach and the English
    songstress are the same person. He points to the well-documented fact that both,
    as children, sang in the entrance hall of Bentalls Department Store in Kingston-upon-Thames
    in exchange for a tin of toffee and a gold wristwatch. In addition, like Petula
    Clark, Old Halob released a CD entitled L''essentiel--20 SuccA"s Inoubliables.
    This is where his argument fails to convince, for where the aged pop diva''s album
    contained songs, and was a chart hit in Belgium, Old Halob''s CD consisted of
    a recording of him eating his breakfast and grumbling about his moth-eaten raincoat,
    and was an international, rather than merely a local, success.

    Pebblehead''s twaddle is thoroughly demolished, of course, if we consider that
    for the first fifty two years of his life, Old Halob did little except refill
    bird feeders in the grounds of a Home for the Deranged, a job for which he was
    paid with a daily bowl of gruel and slops. His parents were fabulously wealthy,
    and lived the life of Riley in a big forbidding castle, but their son lacked ambition,
    and they disowned him when, at the age of nine, he rejected their birthday gifts
    of a booster pack, the elixir of life, a modelling contract with L''Oreal, and
    a populated planet in a far distant galaxy to treat as his plaything.

    No one, not even Pebblehead, knows what happened to transform the dull-witted
    bird feeder maintenance man into an athletics coach of legend. Perhaps a clue
    lies in his change of diet. Shortly after Old Halob''s fiftieth birthday, the
    management of the Derangement Home was restructured following a report from consultants
    Pricewatergatecoopersfreemanhardywillis. As part of their recommendations, Old
    Halob stopped eating gruel and slops and was instead fed on whelks and barnacles.
    The evidence is not conclusive, but future biographers would be stupid to ignore
    it.

    And that is all I have to say about Old Halob today.'
