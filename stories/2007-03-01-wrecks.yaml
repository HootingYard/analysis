  text: 'There is huge excitement at Bodger''s Spinney as we look forward to this
    weekend''s annual Spinney Wreck Competition. Rival teams have been preparing for
    months, in utmost secrecy, their re-enactments of The Wreck Of The Deutschland
    and The Wreck Of The Hesperus. As ever when the Jesuits meet the Hiawathas, there
    is a sense of age-old blood feud, and volunteer ambulance-based medicos wearing
    special armbands will be on the alert from before daybreak.

    Old Farmer Frack''s cows will be mooching in a nearby field to add an air of bucolic
    charm, and Mrs Gubbins will again be wearing the referee''s chapeau. In an exclusive
    pre-contest interview she told our reporter, "I am hoping things pass off with
    due decorum, but I have made sure we have enough tourniquets on site this year.
    No one wants to see a repeat of the time we had to send urchins scampering off
    across the hills to Old Ma Bagshaw''s Bandage Shop."

    Mrs Gubbins was made referee-in-perpetuity after she single-handedly sent packing
    a gang of rogue Opium-Eaters who tried to sabotage the contest with a wholly inappropriate,
    because shipless, re-enactment of The Household Wreck.

    The latest odds are available from the illegal gambling den behind the illegal
    butcher''s shop on the plaza.'
