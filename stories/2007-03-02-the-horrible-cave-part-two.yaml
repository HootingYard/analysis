  text: "I arrived at the Bird Inspectors\u2019 Hut to discover that it had been engulfed\
    \ by a tsunami and lay in ruins. A solitary moorhen was paddling about where the\
    \ door used to be, but there was no sign of the inspectors. I fancied that perhaps\
    \ this might be a talking moorhen which could apprise me where they had gone,\
    \ and asked my question in a slow, clear, loud voice, as one might use in speaking\
    \ to a recalcitrant infant. But of course the moorhen was incapable of speech!\
    \ What was I thinking?\nI felt it more important than ever to track down at least\
    \ one of the bird inspectors and relay my theory that crows were nesting in the\
    \ horrible cave, with alarming consequences. In my experience, most bird inspectors\
    \ sport Italianate mustachios and preen them fanatically with oils and waxes,\
    \ so I decided to head off on foot for the nearest village and seek out a shop\
    \ selling oils, waxes, and other hair treatments.\nI was in luck, for as soon\
    \ as I strode purposefully into the village I saw not only such an emporium, tucked\
    \ between a wholesaler of dinghies and a clapboard hovel, but a man with Italianate\
    \ mustachios lurking in the doorway. He was sopping wet, making his moustache\
    \ droop, but that made it all the more likely he had been caught in the tsunami.\n\
    I hailed him from a distance of some forty feet. That is the last thing I can\
    \ remember. I have no idea what happened from that moment until today, three weeks\
    \ later so I am told, when I found myself sitting in an armchair staring out at\
    \ a dying lawn, being proffered cups of tea and mashed potatoes by an oversolicitous\
    \ nurse. Her name, she told me, was Primrose. That name rang a faint bell in my\
    \ memory. I associated it with something petrifying and terrible, but Primrose\
    \ the nurse seemed to be neither. In fact her fawning was getting on my nerves.\n\
    I wanted to ask her where I was and how I got here, but she had already skipped\
    \ off to fetch more potatoes. Deciding to follow her, I walked rather unsteadily\
    \ into a corridor. It was painted a hideous shade of orange, and on the walls\
    \ hung framed portraits of members of Jethro Tull, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and\
    \ Barclay James Harvest. Was this some kind of benighted prog rock haven? I should\
    \ add that these were paintings rather than photographs, although perhaps the\
    \ word I am looking for is daubs. My infant child could do better, if I had an\
    \ infant child, but I do not. Long ago I vowed never to bring a new being into\
    \ a world with a horrible cave in it, lest the mite should accidentally wander\
    \ into it. I could not forgive myself if such a thing happened.\nI could hear\
    \ what sounded like potatoes being mashed coming from an open doorway over to\
    \ my left. Entering the room, however, I did not find Primrose. Instead I was\
    \ confronted by a slobbering ghoul. It spoke\u2014or rather, groaned\u2014at me\
    \ in Latin, for it was a Vatican ghoul. Atop its gruesome head I could see the\
    \ tattered remnants of a biretta, in which a number of locusts seemed to be feeding.\
    \ Were they eating the ghoul's straggly locks, or its priestly hat? Or both? I\
    \ was so fascinated by the locusts that I am afraid I paid little attention to\
    \ the gravel-voiced Latin being spouted at me. At this point Primrose came in.\n\
    \u201CThere you are, Mr MacTavish!\u201D she cooed sweetly, addressing the ghoul,\
    \ \u201CI've been looking all over for you. It's time for your mashed potato poultice.\
    \ Come with me, there's a dear.\u201D She took it by what I can only assume was\
    \ its arm and steered it away, still groaning. I was rather disconcerted that\
    \ Primrose had ignored me completely. Perhaps I was being oversensitive. I looked\
    \ at my wristwatch and saw that it was just coming up to midday. Why in heaven's\
    \ name was I dressed in pyjamas? I opened a cupboard and rummaged around until\
    \ I found a shiny and brand new boiler suit. I changed into it and checked how\
    \ I looked in a mirror, noting that its broad black and yellow hoops gave me a\
    \ faint resemblance to a giant bee. It was time to leave this place, wherever\
    \ it was. I pranced out onto the lawn and peered around, looking for a signpost.\n\
    I have always been fond of crocuses, and there was a clump of them nearby. In\
    \ the absence of a signpost, I decided I could do worse than tarry awhile examining\
    \ their flowers and leaves, and perhaps scrubbling in the soil to have a quick\
    \ look at the corm. One should take one's pleasures as one can, and if I was to\
    \ stride onward with a spring in my step, a few minutes\u2019 contemplation of\
    \ foliage would calm my brain for the inevitable travails ahead. These were early\
    \ crocuses, or Crocus tommasinianus, as no doubt the ghoul could have told me.\
    \ I wondered whereabouts on his grisly frame Primrose the nurse was going to apply\
    \ that poultice of hers. His head? That spindly arm? I wondered, too, how she\
    \ would cope with the locusts, who would devour the mashed potato as quickly as\
    \ she could apply it.\nThus lost in thoughts of potatoes, ghouls and crocuses,\
    \ I failed to notice that a man had approached me, all but silently.\n\u201CGood\
    \ day to you, sir,\u201D he said, clearing accumulated phlegm from his throat\
    \ as he did so, \u201CWould I be correct in thinking you know something of the\
    \ horrible cave?\u201D\nI looked up, astonished, and saw that my interlocutor\
    \ was none other than the so called limping irredentist, Florenzio Pabstus."
