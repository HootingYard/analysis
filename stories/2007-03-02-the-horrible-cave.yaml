  text: In the autumn of 2004 I wrote three episodes of a story entitled The Horrible
    Cave. It was left unfinished, but I always meant to get back to it, and now I
    have. Rather than sending readers back to the (unhelpfully indexed) archive for
    the first three parts, I decided to republish the whole thing here. So scroll
    down for all four episodes of... (sinister voice) ... The Horrible Cave!
