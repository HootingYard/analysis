  text: "In the autumn of 2004 I wrote three episodes of a story entitled The Horrible\
    \ Cave. It was left unfinished, but I always meant to get back to it, and now\
    \ I have. Rather than sending readers back to the (unhelpfully indexed) archive\
    \ for the first three parts, I decided to republish the whole thing here. So scroll\
    \ down for all four episodes of\u2026 (sinister voice) \u2026 The Horrible Cave!"
