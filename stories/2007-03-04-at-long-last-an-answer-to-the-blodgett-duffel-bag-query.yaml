  text: 'A week or two after the inaugural parade for the Hooting Yard website, as
    long ago as December 2003, I received a plea in the post from a concerned reader.
    Dear Frank, my anonymous correspondent wrote, I have heard it said that Blodgett
    always maintained an alphabetical contents in his duffel bag. Is this true, and
    if so, can you give an example, drawn from a typical Blodgett day?

    I have not ignored this question, but coming up with an answer has taken a lot
    of research, sometimes perilous. If you have undertaken perilous research, on
    any topic, you will know how it can make you a bit wobbly on your pins. Anyway,
    I did finally manage to find out what Blodgett kept in his rucksack on a typical
    day, and now that I am less wobbly on my pins, I can at last respond to that long-ago
    question.

    Yes, Blodgett did always maintain an alphabetical contents in his duffel bag.
    The twenty-sixth of March 1965 was, for Blodgett, a pretty unremarkable day--neither
    muckling nor mickling, as Fisher would say. Here is a comprehensive list of the
    contents of his duffel bag on that day:

    Aniseed. Blotzmann diagrams. Cake. Dust. Ectoplasm. Flippers. Grease. Hinges.
    Incunabula. Jam doughnuts. Kaolin. Linctus. Marmalade. Nothingness. Orpiment.
    Prunes. Queen Esmerelda''s Toilet Water. Ransom money. Sandpaper. Turps. Ullage.
    Vinegar. Wax. X-Ray Spectacles. Yeast. Zinc blobs.'
