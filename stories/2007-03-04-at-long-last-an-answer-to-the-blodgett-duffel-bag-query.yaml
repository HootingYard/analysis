  text: "A week or two after the inaugural parade for the Hooting Yard website, as\
    \ long ago as December 2003, I received a plea in the post from a concerned reader.\
    \ Dear Frank, my anonymous correspondent wrote, I have heard it said that Blodgett\
    \ always maintained an alphabetical contents in his duffel bag. Is this true,\
    \ and if so, can you give an example, drawn from a typical Blodgett day?\nI have\
    \ not ignored this question, but coming up with an answer has taken a lot of research,\
    \ sometimes perilous. If you have undertaken perilous research, on any topic,\
    \ you will know how it can make you a bit wobbly on your pins. Anyway, I did finally\
    \ manage to find out what Blodgett kept in his rucksack on a typical day, and\
    \ now that I am less wobbly on my pins, I can at last respond to that long-ago\
    \ question.\nYes, Blodgett did always maintain an alphabetical contents in his\
    \ duffel bag. The twenty-sixth of March 1965 was, for Blodgett, a pretty unremarkable\
    \ day\u2014neither muckling nor mickling, as Fisher would say. Here is a comprehensive\
    \ list of the contents of his duffel bag on that day:\nAniseed. Bl\xF6tzmann diagrams.\
    \ Cake. Dust. Ectoplasm. Flippers. Grease. Hinges. Incunabula. Jam doughnuts.\
    \ Kaolin. Linctus. Marmalade. Nothingness. Orpiment. Prunes. Queen Esmerelda's\
    \ Toilet Water. Ransom money. Sandpaper. Turps. Ullage. Vinegar. Wax. X-Ray Spectacles.\
    \ Yeast. Zinc blobs."
