  text: 'Is Hooting Yard a lopsided version of the world, or is the world a lopsided
    version of Hooting Yard? Today, news comes in that leads us a little closer to
    answering that age-old question.

    The comments appended here by readers are always worthy of your attention. Occasionally
    I think it necessary to give a comment a more prominent airing, for even the most
    assiduous reader might miss a buried gem. Like this one, received today regarding
    The Heroic Bus Driver Of Pointy Town:

    Hi there. With all this discussion of our township I thought it was about time
    we thanked you for putting Pointy Town on the map. Well, it already is on the
    map of the Yukon Territory here in Canada, but we don''t get to be in the news
    much. Pointy Town has just elected a Mayor for the first time, after being recognised
    as a township, and we have appointed a promotions chief to put us on the Web.
    The Mayor is Johnny Osikomiwasa (proud of his Inuit roots) and his buzz word this
    week is ''promotion''. So that''s what I am doing. So I intend to climb to the
    top of Pointy Hill (it really is very pointy) and start promoting--well actually
    I will probably have to do the promoting from my office computer. So keep up the
    good work and tell the world about our Pointy Town. Hugs, Kelly (very tired, on
    fire watch)

    Now, Kelly Le Cornu, my correspondent, has an email address at pointytown.com.ca,
    and I have no reason to believe she is a fictional character. Isn''t it marvellous
    to think that there is a real Pointy Town, with a Pointy Hill? I am looking forward
    to the promised web presence of this magnificent township, and will certainly
    link to it. If anyone would like to start planning an outing, let me know. As
    some wag put it the other day, "it''s like Hooting Yard gone mad!"'
