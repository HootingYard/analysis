  text: 'You don''t often come across a Duggleby Bin these days, more''s the pity.
    In its time it was a revolutionary new type of waste paper basket, the fad for
    which led to scenes reminiscent of the South Sea Bubble or tulipomania. Duggleby
    Bins would exchange hands for outrageous sums of money, or be bartered for grand
    houses, farmyards, entire fleets of ships, or, in one celebrated case, the monarchy
    of a mountain-girt kingdom shrouded in mystical mists. And then, as suddenly as
    they had become fashionable, so Duggleby Bins were shunned, discarded, abandoned,
    broken up with hammers, and ownership of one became a social gaffe, the cause
    of mockery and disgrace. Nowadays, you can trawl for weeks or months or years
    through junkyards and rubbish tips and never set eyes upon a Duggleby Bin. Rag
    and bone men who will happily clasp to their bosoms the most noisome detritus
    will look askance and pass on to examine something filthy and worm-eaten rather
    than hoist a Duggleby Bin on to their cart.

    It was with very little publicity, then, that last week saw the launch of the
    Duggleby Bin Appreciation Society. Its mission statement says that the Society
    aims to "revive, preserve, and enthuse about Duggleby Bins", although a footnote
    in the inaugural Newsletter reveals that not one of the founding members actually
    owns one, or has ever seen a genuine Duggleby Bin. The four po-faced individuals
    in the official Society photograph pose with what appears to be an Etch-a-Sketch
    rendering of what they imagine a Duggleby Bin might look like. It''s all rather
    quaint, and sad. Remember them in your prayers.'
