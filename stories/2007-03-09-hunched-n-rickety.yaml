  text: 'From The Likes Of Us by Michael Collins:

    Edwin Pugh was a slum novelist who attempted to insert a layer of sympathy between
    the hooliganism and the hangings. A former city clerk, Pugh was notable for lighting
    up the nether worlds of which he wrote with pathos and humour, even when the subject
    is a child with a hunched body, rickety legs, a flute-playing, philosopher father
    who seldom works, and a mother who drinks herself into oblivion, or at least the
    nearest kerb. Such is the content of Tony Drum, A Cockney Boy (1898).'
