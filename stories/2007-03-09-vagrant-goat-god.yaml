  text: 'I have been asked to write some further words about the golden key to the
    secret fortress of the mysterious Adepts of the hidden tower of the invisible
    goat deity. This key is referred to in Emboldened, In Gumboots, where it is suggested
    that obtaining it, and bringing it back to HQ, was the object of the no longer
    weedy volunteer brevet cadet''s dangerous mission.

    Rather than babbling on about the key, however, I think readers would be better
    served if I said something about the invisible goat deity itself. This goat god
    was not only invisible, but more significantly it was vagrant, in the sense that
    it was forever wandering around, hither and thither, without any apparent purpose.
    It was for this reason that the Adepts had constructed a tower in which to pen
    it. They let it out to go a-wandering on special ceremonial days, and were able--as
    Adepts--to track its aimless scurrying because the deity left a unique carbon
    footprint wherever it went. Perhaps ''carbon hoofprint'' is the apposite phrase.
    The mark of a true Adept was an acutely honed skill at offsetting the goat god''s
    carbon hoofprint. So few people had even the glimmer of an idea what ''offsetting
    the carbon hoofprint'' actually meant that there was only ever a handful of Adepts.
    Easily recognisable in their huge blue conical hats, waving their wands, and weighed
    down by necklaces of bones and teeth and jewels and stones and dough, the Adepts
    spent most of their time in their secret fortress, writing lengthy and learned
    texts about the deity.

    Careful never to reveal how they offset the goat god''s carbon hoofprint, they
    had two objectives. As their god was invisible and vagrant, they felt it necessary
    to compile a thorough account of its character, personality, likes and dislikes,
    temper, cogitations, diet, sensibility, and speech-patterns, or rather grunt-patterns.
    Their second aim was to convince the ignorant peasants who lived in the bailiwick
    of the fortress and the tower that the invisible goat was their Creator, and had
    ultimate power over their miserable lives.

    Pebblehead''s bestselling paperback Goat! is a fictionalised account of the exciting
    day when the goat outwitted the Adepts and locked them in the tower, then scampered
    off to the secret fortress and, in the company of a number of other goats, both
    visible and invisible, munched its way through their collected writings, leaving
    nothing but a clotted, chewed-up mass of spittle-soaked scrap paper. No one knows
    what became of the goat after that, for it resumed its vagrant ways, invisible.
    So ended its goatgodly Dominion, which had lasted for just six weeks, in the year
    of straw, long ago, but not so long ago as all that.'
