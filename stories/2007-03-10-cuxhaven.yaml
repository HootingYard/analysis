  text: 'This is the coat of arms of Cuxhaven:


    In Cuxhaven, there is a tower built of concrete which is inaccessible to the public,
    which means to you and me, as well as to native Cuxhavenites. The significance
    of this inaccessible Cuxhaven tower for denizens of Hooting Yard will become apparent
    quite soon.

    There is a beach at Cuxhaven, too, which is the setting for Pebblehead''s bestselling
    paperback The Beach At Cuxhaven, which I wouldn''t recommend, as it is a mere
    potboiler, with wooden characters, leaden imagery, and a pewter plot.
