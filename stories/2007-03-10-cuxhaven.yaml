  text: "This is the coat of arms of Cuxhaven:\n\nIn Cuxhaven, there is a tower built\
    \ of concrete which is inaccessible to the public, which means to you and me,\
    \ as well as to native Cuxhavenites. The significance of this inaccessible Cuxhaven\
    \ tower for denizens of Hooting Yard will become apparent quite soon.\nThere is\
    \ a beach at Cuxhaven, too, which is the setting for Pebblehead's bestselling\
    \ paperback The Beach At Cuxhaven, which I wouldn't recommend, as it is a mere\
    \ potboiler, with wooden characters, leaden imagery, and a pewter plot.\n\n \n\
