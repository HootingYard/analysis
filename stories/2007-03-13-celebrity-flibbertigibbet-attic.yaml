  text: 'Dobson could be a very prescient man. Imagine for a moment a world where
    the magazine racks in newsagent''s shops contain titles like Nunc Dimitis and
    Look, Cogitate & Learn and The Weekly Cranium, rather than Pap! and Fluffyhead!
    and Tat! It was like that once, in the middle of the last century. And it was
    in such a world that Dobson woke up one morning, went downstairs and ate bloaters
    for breakfast, and polished his Montenegrin hunting boots, and walked out into
    the rain with a surprising sense of purpose. He had had one of his bright ideas,
    and he was going to act on it without delay.

    He did not pause by the illegal butcher''s shop, nor by the Tundist Owl Library,
    nor at the lido nor the pie shop nor the allotments, but strode onwards to a pond
    at the very edge of town where a fledging television programme making unit had
    set up cameras to record a documentary about swans. A Quaint, Black And White
    Look At Some Swans Near A Pond was planned as a primetime series for later that
    year, and would prove to be the most popular show of the decade. It was that sort
    of world.

    Elbowing his way through a security cordon, Dobson identified the producer, seized
    him by the collar, and dragged him off to one side.

    "I have an idea for a television series," he shouted at the pipe-smoking, cardigan-wearing
    weakling who crumpled in awe of the out of print pamphleteer.

    "I suggest," continued Dobson, "That you immediately stop filming these confounded
    swans and instead take up my brilliant idea, which is as follows. You gather together
    roughly a dozen well-known persons, all of whom tend to be flibbertigibbets by
    nature, and you lock them in an attic for two months. You then film them, being
    flibbertigibbets in an attic. The programme would be called Celebrity Flibbertigibbet
    Attic, and I have absolutely no doubt that it will be a hit, a palpable hit!"

    The scrawny television producer squirmed free from Dobson''s importunate grasp,
    and thumped back through the mud towards where his team was filming over one hundred
    and twenty hours of swan footage. He paused only to re-light his pipe, which had
    gone out after a fleck of Dobson''s spittle landed slap in the middle of the bowl.

    At this point several swans who had wandered away from their allotted places set
    upon Dobson, whooping at him and pecking at his trousers, and he fled. On his
    way home, he stopped in at the early morning skiffle club milk bar, and became
    obsessed with the rhythmic bashing of washboards, an interest which utterly consumed
    him for several weeks, by the end of which time he had completely forgotten about
    his ground-breaking television concept. He could be, as I said, a very prescient
    man, but he was far too easily distracted.

    Further reading : inadvisable.'
