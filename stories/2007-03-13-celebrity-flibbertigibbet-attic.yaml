  text: "Dobson could be a very prescient man. Imagine for a moment a world where\
    \ the magazine racks in newsagent's shops contain titles like Nunc Dimitis and\
    \ Look, Cogitate & Learn and The Weekly Cranium, rather than Pap! and Fluffyhead!\
    \ and Tat! It was like that once, in the middle of the last century. And it was\
    \ in such a world that Dobson woke up one morning, went downstairs and ate bloaters\
    \ for breakfast, and polished his Montenegrin hunting boots, and walked out into\
    \ the rain with a surprising sense of purpose. He had had one of his bright ideas,\
    \ and he was going to act on it without delay.\nHe did not pause by the illegal\
    \ butcher's shop, nor by the Tundist Owl Library, nor at the lido nor the pie\
    \ shop nor the allotments, but strode onwards to a pond at the very edge of town\
    \ where a fledging television programme making unit had set up cameras to record\
    \ a documentary about swans. A Quaint, Black And White Look At Some Swans Near\
    \ A Pond was planned as a primetime series for later that year, and would prove\
    \ to be the most popular show of the decade. It was that sort of world.\nElbowing\
    \ his way through a security cordon, Dobson identified the producer, seized him\
    \ by the collar, and dragged him off to one side.\n\u201CI have an idea for a\
    \ television series,\u201D he shouted at the pipe-smoking, cardigan-wearing weakling\
    \ who crumpled in awe of the out of print pamphleteer.\n\u201CI suggest,\u201D\
    \ continued Dobson, \u201CThat you immediately stop filming these confounded swans\
    \ and instead take up my brilliant idea, which is as follows. You gather together\
    \ roughly a dozen well-known persons, all of whom tend to be flibbertigibbets\
    \ by nature, and you lock them in an attic for two months. You then film them,\
    \ being flibbertigibbets in an attic. The programme would be called Celebrity\
    \ Flibbertigibbet Attic, and I have absolutely no doubt that it will be a hit,\
    \ a palpable hit!\u201D\nThe scrawny television producer squirmed free from Dobson's\
    \ importunate grasp, and thumped back through the mud towards where his team was\
    \ filming over one hundred and twenty hours of swan footage. He paused only to\
    \ re-light his pipe, which had gone out after a fleck of Dobson's spittle landed\
    \ slap in the middle of the bowl.\nAt this point several swans who had wandered\
    \ away from their allotted places set upon Dobson, whooping at him and pecking\
    \ at his trousers, and he fled. On his way home, he stopped in at the early morning\
    \ skiffle club milk bar, and became obsessed with the rhythmic bashing of washboards,\
    \ an interest which utterly consumed him for several weeks, by the end of which\
    \ time he had completely forgotten about his ground-breaking television concept.\
    \ He could be, as I said, a very prescient man, but he was far too easily distracted.\n\
    Further reading\_: inadvisable."
