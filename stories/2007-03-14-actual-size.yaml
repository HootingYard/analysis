  text: 'Before plunging into the ocean, snorkelled and flippered or, as it may be,
    encased in full body diving gear, it is critically important that you are aware
    of the actual size of the innumerable life forms that teem within the vasty deep.
    If you have read Pebblehead''s bestselling paperback The Neurasthenic Aquaperson,
    you will appreciate the force of my argument. In this book, the author ploughs
    through a relentless litany of aquatic diving enthusiasts of a nervous disposition
    who came a-cropper in the water because they feared an encounter with some monstrous
    sea-being whose picture they had pored over in an album of marine life, without
    having taken care to read a parenthetical addendum to the caption saying (actual
    size) or (not to scale).

    For the hearty and the reckless, of course, there is no problem. They will topple
    off the side of their boat and go happily splashing about in the depths with the
    same gusto they would take to striding across a wild and desolate moor, or tucking
    into breakfast in a magnificent hotel dining room. But woe betide the mentally
    fragile diving person, one who suffers from attacks of the vapours, should they
    jump into the broiling ocean unprepared!

    Let us consider an example. Here is a picture of Zoanthus socialis:


    In reality, this is a tiny thing, much magnified in our reproduction, and threatens
    no peril to the average-sized human diver, whether hearty or neurasthenic. Yet
    the latter, those whose brains are given to fuming imaginings based upon anatomical
    inaccuracy, may have understood these wee creatures to be titanic in size. They
    may fear being sucked into Zoanthus socialis'' hideous maw, helpless and alone.
    Such timidity in the sea is desperately bad for the moral fibre.

    Pebblehead acknowledges that many nerve-wracked oceanic explorers will prepare
    themselves by swallowing a draught of some brain tonic or emboldening potion before
    clambering into their wetsuit. He condemns this practice, rightly in my view,
    in prose of towering vigour. "There can be no substitute," he writes, "for preceding
    each dive into the squalid black depths of the oceans with untold hours of study
    of the actual size of thousands, nay, millions of grotesque life forms that populate
    those very same squalid black depths into which the neurasthenic aquaperson is
    due to plunge!"

    Some cynics have pointed out that Pebblehead has a vested interest. He owns the
    rights to a patented mechanism by which the prospective diving person is able
    to stand before a full-length mirror and watch as, one after another, actual size
    images of numberless sea-beings are superimposed upon his or her body. An accompanying
    set of tomes contains colour plates of each creature, fully captioned in English
    and Latin, which can be consulted during the slide show, or separately. This seems
    to me to be a wholly admirable enterprise, and it is no skin off my nose if it
    earns Pebblehead a fortune. Indeed, one might ask what comparable service to humanity,
    neurasthenic or otherwise, is being provided by other bestselling paperback authors.
    Perhaps I am being unfair to the likes of Andy McNab, Barbara Taylor Bradford,
    and Martin Amis, but where oh where are their initiatives to give succour and
    hope to jangle-brained aquapersons, pig farmers, posties, stamp collectors, bellringers,
    detectives, pie shop proprietors, and conquistadors? Pebblehead deserves a medal,
    or at least a tin cup, and I for one will happily campaign on his behalf. I shall
    be outside the town hall with a placard and a flask of tea at six o clock tomorrow
    morning, and every morning. Join me.'
