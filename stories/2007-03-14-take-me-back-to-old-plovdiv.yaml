  text: 'This piece first appeared in August 2004. I am posting it again for the simple
    reason that now, thanks to the indefatigable Salim Fadhley, it can be accompanied
    by a photograph, and thus be truly inspiring...

    I am suffering from a spiritual malaise. I am soul sick. I have not eaten any
    breakfast. I need to darn a hole in the sleeve of my jumper, but I have no further
    wool that matches. I feel inconsequential and abandoned and remote. My cheeks
    blush furiously with an embarrassment born of pity. Every last pencil I have is
    blunt. I am being driven crackers by my landlord''s drooling hound. My senses
    are atrophied, like a muscle unexercised. Pots and pans are strewn haphazardly
    in my kitchen. My legs have given way. I have an evil taste in my mouth. Hope
    is something for other people, not for me. My teapot is cracked and the cosy is
    stained and threadbare. Nervous spasms contort my features. I keep to the shadows
    if I have to move in the street. Do you hear that sound? It is my groan of despair.
    I have extinguished all the lanterns and I know in my cold, base heart that they
    will never be lit again. The air is heavy with menace and all I can hear is the
    screaming of desolation and ruin. Insects swarm about my face but I cannot summon
    the energy to swat them away. I have sprained my ankle. Dust lies everywhere,
    ashes and dust. Desire, ah, desire for me is not even a memory. Feral cats hiss
    at me and extend their claws. Even my poultry is contaminated. All sense of urgency
    is lost and yet I cannot relax. My head is swimming. My shoes let in rainwater
    and my socks are soaking wet. The washbasin is cracked. The taps no longer work.
    Even the most innocent and cherubic children spit at me. I gag on my own wretchedness.
    And then with a mighty effort, I pull myself up, and I trudge across Bulgaria
    like a whipped cur, and I go the Central Post Office building in Plovdiv, and
    I look at Georgi Bozhilov''s mural. Yes, that Georgi Bozhilov, whose nickname
    was Slona, or Elephant, a member of the so-called Plovdiv Fivesome. I gaze at
    the post office mural and somehow I am pulled back from the brink, and I embrace
    life again, wholeheartedly, blissfully. Here... here is a photograph of the mural,
    so you too can gaze upon it, and experience revelation!
