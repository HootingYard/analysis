  text: 'Over at ResonanceFM there is another fundraising auction. This time bids
    are invited for two ancient books by Mr Key, House Of Turps and the ludicrously
    rare The Brink Of Cramp. Both of these were published in the year that Communism
    collapsed in Eastern Europe, although that may be purely coincidental. For further
    details, and to make a bid, go here. (You will need to join the Forum if you want
    to participate.)

    The money raised will go direct to ResonanceFM. Should you wish to add to Mr Key''s
    own paltry coffers, you can of course buy Befuddled By Cormorants or make a donation.
    Simply click over there on the right.'
