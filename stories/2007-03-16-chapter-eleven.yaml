  text: 'In which Flossie has her ears syringed, and Umberto becomes involved in an
    altercation with a beekeeping enthusiast down by the docks, together with a disquisition
    upon certain matters related to the crinkling of pastry; also, a chuckling maniac
    is discovered in the belfry by the intrepid infants, whereupon our story takes
    a sinister turn, and something terrible happens in a field full of charming cows.
