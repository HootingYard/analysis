  text: "From Much Depends On Dinner\_: The Extraordinary History And Mythology, Allure\
    \ And Obsessions, Perils And Taboos, Of An Ordinary Meal by Margaret Visser:\n\
    At the end of the seventeenth century, John Evelyn wrote a book on salads, called\
    \ Aceteria (things in vinegared dressing): A Discourse of Sallets, in which he\
    \ extols the reign of lettuce over the salad bowl. \u201CAnd certainly \u2018\
    tis not for nothing,\u201D he wrote, \u201Cthat our Garden-Lovers, and Brothers\
    \ of the Sallet, have been so exceedingly Industrious to cultivate this Noble\
    \ Plant, and multiply its Species; for\u2026 by reason of its soporiferous quality,\
    \ lettuce ever was, and still continues the principal foundation of the universal\
    \ tribe of Sallets, which is to cool and refresh, besides its other properties,\u201D\
    \ which include inducements to \u201Cmorals, temperance, and chastity.\u201D"
