  text: "\u201CThe principal function of Biblical exegesis\u201D, wrote Dobson in\
    \ jaunty mood one morning, \u201Cis for me to look with disdain upon the minnows\
    \ who have trod these paths before me.\u201D\nIt's hard to know whether the pamphleteer\
    \ was being deliberately muddle-headed with his image of walking minnows, but\
    \ as I said, he was in a jaunty mood, and at such times his prose could be perplexing.\
    \ There is no doubt, however, about the sincerity of his view that he had an unrivalled\
    \ grasp of the Bible. He did not write all that much about the holy book, but\
    \ he never lost an opportunity to pour scorn on scholars of the past such as Theodore\
    \ of Mopsuestia, Ludolph of Saxony, Pelagius, Tirinus of Antwerp, Manuel Sa, indeed\
    \ more scholars than you could shake a stick at, were you minded so to do. Dobson,\
    \ incidentally, was perhaps over-fond of shaking a stick at people or things of\
    \ which he disapproved, and attached an infant's rattle to one of his sticks the\
    \ better to make his point. His point was not always clear, either to him or to\
    \ the object of his stick-shaking, and eventually he was able to suppress this\
    \ aspect of his behaviour by attending a long course of therapy in a mountainous\
    \ sanatorium where the air was pure, the porridge was plain, and the calisthenics\
    \ were invigorating.\nThe finest of Dobson's exercises in Biblical scholarship\
    \ is his pamphlet The Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse\u2026 Or Were They? (out\
    \ of print). The title is a tad puzzling, but not for long, for in the very first\
    \ sentence Dobson states his case. \u201CI avow,\u201D he wrote \u201Cthat there\
    \ were no horsemen of the Apocalypse, nor, if there had been, were they four in\
    \ number.\u201D In the sixty pages that follow, he argued that a combination of\
    \ mistranslation, forgery, and carelessness had altered the original text, so\
    \ that \u201Cfour\u201D was correctly \u201Ctwo\u201D, and \u201Chorsemen\u201D\
    \ was properly Englished as \u201Ccows\u201D, or possibly \u201Cbees\u201D.\n\
    Challenged by the local papal nuncio after publication as to how two cows or two\
    \ bees could symbolise famine, war, pestilence and death, Dobson countered with\
    \ a theological sally, probably the greatest of his sallies, theological or otherwise.\
    \ Sadly, there is no record of what he said, for Marigold Chew's recently-purchased\
    \ Boswellite tape recorder was out of order, having been placed too close to the\
    \ toaster that morning, and consequently smothered in a particularly toothsome\
    \ marmalade."
