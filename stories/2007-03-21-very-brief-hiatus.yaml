  text: 'Astute readers, and fanatical Dobsonists, will have noticed that yesterday
    was the first post-free day since Hooting Yard was relaunched at the beginning
    of February. The reasons for this are twofold.

    1. I have a stinking cold, and am much dependent on Lemsip, which readers will
    recall is the favoured tipple of our poet laureate Andrew Motion. In fact, I have
    taken to calling it Motion Potion. In theory, sufficient draughts of this piping
    hot medicament ought to inspire me to write poetry, just as happens with Mr M.
    Alas, I seem to be immune.

    2. When not whimpering and snuffling and weakly calling aidez-moi! (see Bulle
    Ogier in Celine & Julie Go Boating, my role model when ill) I am concentrating
    on a couple of other projects which will be of interest to readers. The follow-up
    to Befuddled By Cormorants is now in preparation. Unspeakable Desolation Pouring
    Down From The Stars will include the novella-length title story and two other
    pieces, together with some charming drawings of postage stamps. In addition, I
    have been struck by the success of the auctions of ancient Key works in raising
    hundreds of pounds for ResonanceFM, and have been digging around in the Archives
    (ie, a couple of cardboard boxes in a cupboard) to see what other material might
    be made available to people with both money and sense. Watch this space for the
    imminent announcement of Hooting Yard Auction Number One, likely to feature original
    artwork.

    NOTE : The current Resonance fundraising auction has been moved to eBay. You can
    place bids for copies of The Brink Of Cramp and House Of Turps.

    UPDATE : At the end of bidding, these two titles between them raised PS199 for
    Resonance. Thank you to the successful bidders.'
