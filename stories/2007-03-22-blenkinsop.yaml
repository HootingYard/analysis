  text: '"Blenkinsop! Blenkinsop! Fain wert thou embrinaged there at the harbourside!
    No turncoat cutpurse at the ducking stool sought to jar thy chaps. Was it but
    a toughening that smudged such gobby vexations, or was a man o'' poultry glutted
    on bream ''n'' minnows? Fie! But how could that be?, you keen, spitter of pips
    with puppy-tears in grand cascade! Know ye that there are fires now blasting the
    barbicans? Well may thee prate ''neath a stickleback sneer, ipso facto, dear goosey
    that thou art whose heart fluttereth in spring and, yea!, in winter''s hawthorn
    cracklings too."

    Discuss.'
