  text: "\u201CBlenkinsop! Blenkinsop! Fain wert thou embrinaged there at the harbourside!\
    \ No turncoat cutpurse at the ducking stool sought to jar thy chaps. Was it but\
    \ a toughening that smudged such gobby vexations, or was a man o\u2019 poultry\
    \ glutted on bream \u2018n\u2019 minnows? Fie! But how could that be?, you keen,\
    \ spitter of pips with puppy-tears in grand cascade! Know ye that there are fires\
    \ now blasting the barbicans? Well may thee prate \u2018neath a stickleback sneer,\
    \ ipso facto, dear goosey that thou art whose heart fluttereth in spring and,\
    \ yea!, in winter's hawthorn cracklings too.\u201D\nDiscuss."
