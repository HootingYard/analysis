  text: 'At a jumble sale last week, I was delighted to pick up a bundle of Dennis
    Beerpint poetry books for less than the price of a toffee apple. Well, I say books,
    but these are leaflets really, of between four and twelve pages each, printed
    with a Gestetner machine in the early 1970s. Here at Hooting Yard we think Beerpint
    is a criminally overlooked versifier, often subjected to critical maulings when
    he ought justly be garlanded with laurels.

    Much of the material in these forgotten publications sees Beerpint finding his
    voice, and admittedly that voice was still a little shaky at this early stage
    in his career. I was struck, however, by the odd gem such as Illness, which begins:

    Oh how dark the night is / When you''ve got meningitis

    and by Being A Bee, with its wonderfully evocative couplet

    I do as I do and I does as I does / And what I do and does is buzz

    I think it is lines like these that fool people into thinking Beerpint "twee",
    or a peddler of doggerel. This seems a particularly fatuous accusation when one
    considers titanic works of poesy such as Lines Upon The Death Of Dag Hammarskjold
    In A Plane Crash (September 1961), with its vibrant "pluckety-pluck" rhythms,
    massive resonance, reach, vigour, gargantuan ambition, deliberately blurred vision,
    knock-kneed tremblement, sourness, decisively windswept atmosphere, implacability,
    tartness, muscular bounding strides, and bravery in confronting, head-on, conundrums
    of global significance. It ends with this Beerpintian flourish:

    O Dag! Alenda lux ubi orta libertas / I''ve reserved a pew at your Requiem Mass

    Who else could have written that?'
