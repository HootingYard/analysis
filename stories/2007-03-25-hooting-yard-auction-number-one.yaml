  text: 'As promised last week, here is the first in a series of Hooting Yard auctions.
    This is in the way of an experiment. I might use eBay in future, but I thought
    I''d keep this one on home turf and see what happens. Unlike the Resonance auctions,
    proceeds of this one go to the Hooting Yard Mercy Fund For Distressed Out Of Print
    Pamphleteers. Make your bid(s) in the Comments. Closing date is a week''s time,
    midnight on Sunday 1st April.

    And what are you bidding for? A mint copy of Sidney The Bat Is Awarded The Order
    Of Lenin, which Mr Key will sign and add a note thanking the successful bidder.
    A5, 8 pages, illustrated, originally produced for the legendary Counter Productions''
    Yuletide World o'' Wonders box in 1990.
