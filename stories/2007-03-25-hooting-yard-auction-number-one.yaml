  text: "As promised last week, here is the first in a series of Hooting Yard auctions.\
    \ This is in the way of an experiment. I might use eBay in future, but I thought\
    \ I'd keep this one on home turf and see what happens. Unlike the Resonance auctions,\
    \ proceeds of this one go to the Hooting Yard Mercy Fund For Distressed Out Of\
    \ Print Pamphleteers. Make your bid(s) in the Comments. Closing date is a week's\
    \ time, midnight on Sunday 1st April.\nAnd what are you bidding for? A mint copy\
    \ of Sidney The Bat Is Awarded The Order Of Lenin, which Mr Key will sign and\
    \ add a note thanking the successful bidder. A5, 8 pages, illustrated, originally\
    \ produced for the legendary Counter Productions\u2019 Yuletide World o\u2019\
    \ Wonders box in 1990.\n"
