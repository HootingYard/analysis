  text: Such a hullabaloo there was when they discovered Dobson's brain had been stolen!
    One cub reporter called it the hullabaloo to end all hullabaloos. Initially beside
    herself, Marigold Chew soon grew to appreciate the peace and quiet--the unhullabaloo--in
    the house itself, where Dobson lay perfectly still, as if asleep, on a mattress.
    She painted and sang and fed the squirrels in the garden. Occasionally she tiptoed
    into the room where Dobson lay sprawled, and examined the sutures on his skull.
    The police scientist agreed with her that it looked like a professional job. Detective
    Captain Cargpan was convinced that the pamphleteer's brain was being kept in a
    jar within a ten mile radius, and waited patiently for a ransom note. There was
    further hullabaloo when a picture was sent to the Daily Screech, purporting to
    show the brain on a platter, but painstaking analysis showed that it was just
    a grey lump of dough. Some wondered if a heroic pooch would find Dobson's brain
    while rummaging in a hedgerow, in a curious foreshadowing of the theft and recovery
    of the Jules Rimet trophy in 1966, a year later. Marigold Chew listened to her
    Xavier Cugat LPs and tended her hollyhocks and pasted cuttings into her scrapbook.
    Detective Captain Cargpan filled his pipe with untreated Uruguayan tobacco and
    paced up and down the garden path, praying for rain. He believed that a torrential
    downpour would flush out the brain thieves. Time passed, and the hullabaloo died
    down, and the cub reporter on the Daily Screech was embedded with a different
    police force investigating a different case. And then, despite the weather remaining
    balmy and sun-battered, one Thursday morning the postie came prancing along the
    lane carrying a package. Detective Captain Cargpan let Marigold Chew unwrap it,
    for she was deft where he was a butterfingers. She said "Gosh!" as she folded
    aside the last layer of blotting paper to reveal the pamphleteer's brain. It was
    rather muddy, as if it had been kept in a ditch, but she rinsed it thoroughly
    under the garden spigot and handed it to the police scientist, who scampered upstairs
    and reinserted it into Dobson's head. No one ever did find out who had stolen
    it, or where it had been stored, or whether any experiments had been carried out
    on it. Detective Captain Cargpan pursued the case for another month or two, but
    he was a maverick, so his manner of conducting his investigations was highly idiosyncratic,
    and passeth all understanding.
