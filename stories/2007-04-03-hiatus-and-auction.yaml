  text: 'Hmm. Another hiatus. I would like to report that I have been away at the
    Vatican, making use of the Latin language cashpoint machine* and giving the Pontiff
    tips for his speech on Hell, but alas, the truth is more mundane, so mundane in
    fact that I shall spare you the details.

    But excitingly, there is another Hooting Yard auction! Now you have a chance to
    get a copy of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet, one of only fifty copies ever produced.
    It''s on eBay, so off you go!

    *Here is that cashpoint machine. Click for a superb enlarged view.
