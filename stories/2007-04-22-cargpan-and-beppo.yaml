  text: 'A topic of consuming interest to a number of people is the manner in which
    Detective Captain Cargpan cut his crime-fighting chops. So impassioned are some
    that there is a weekly magazine to cater to their needs, entitled O Cargpan! That
    Thou Were With Us Still! in which beetle-browed fans with nothing better to do
    publish lengthy and frankly tedious disquisitions upon the earlier cases of the
    renowned copper. A short extract will suffice to give you some idea of the content:

    Later that summer, Cargpan was assigned to the team which had been trying, fruitlessly,
    to solve the mysterious case of the pod persons from Porlock. Acting on a tip
    off from Krumbein, the ambitious young detective took fruit with him to his first
    briefing. His plums were bruised, but he calculated, correctly, that the investigation
    would no longer be fruitless. His colleagues on the case were Kandinsky, Ferrero-Roche,
    Pabulum, Squit, Cranedneck, Solomon Gilliblat, Hinges, Darjeeling, Mens Sana,
    Pillipap, Coobin, Hoobin, Therapanticack and Choobin, Wesk, Flopper, Ruskin, Whistler,
    Pinkerton, Peris, Perisc, Periscope, Boo Boo, Conceptalbum, Wherwithal, Fanfares,
    Desk Sergeant Greasejacket, Desk Sergeant Greasejacket''s performing monkey, Flamboyant
    Man, Elspeth Duckwind, Lavengro, Rasselas, Pompidou and Vampire, Threadbare, Pot,
    Gack, Snap, Tiddlepan, Forlorn, Riskassessor, Kow Fat Loon, Hoon Bat Lim, Goon
    Fang, Chow Hang Lip, Kim Park Goong, Trilby Baxter, Serp, Slop, Shandy, Martinamis,
    Woolgatherer, Poopsie Clutterbuck, Poopsie Clutterbuck''s crippled nephew Simon,
    whose name was Peter, a pool of seconded temporary volunteers, and some horses,
    all under the command of Super Captain Fausto Coppi, no relation to the legendary
    cyclist of that name.

    This is the kind of thing the O Cargpan! That Thou Were With Us Still! readers
    adore. No doubt it took prodigious research to compile that list of team-members,
    but those of us with a less specialist approach are left wondering how, or even
    if, the case of the pod persons from Porlock was solved. The author of the piece
    does not tell us, nor does she follow up the ramifications of Cargpan''s provision
    of a basket of fruit.

    Later in his career, of course, like many fictional detectives, Detective Captain
    Cargpan had a trusty assistant, a Watson to his Holmes. You will find no mention
    of Beppo in the umpteen thousand pages of the bound volumes of O Cargpan! That
    Thou Were With Us Still! held in the reference library at Pointy Town, nor in
    any of the myriad other journals devoted to the cutting of Cargpan''s crime-fighting
    chops. Beppo was not yet born when the great detective joined the constabulary,
    and it was not until the famous case of the politician, the lighthouse, and the
    trained cormorant that the diminutive helpmeet appeared on the scene. Interestingly,
    this case is one that the aforementioned Dr Watson attributed, in passing, to
    Sherlock Holmes. Watson made this something of a habit, for he also tried to claim
    credit for a number of Cargpan & Beppo adventures, including the singular affair
    of the aluminium crutch, the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible
    death of Crosby the banker, the arrest of Wilson the notorious canary-trainer,
    and the one in which Isadora Persano, the well-known journalist and duellist,
    was found stark staring mad with a matchbox in front of him which contained a
    remarkable worm said to be unknown to science.

    Such true-life tales of detection and derring-do have thrilled generations. What
    is less well-known is that when Cargpan eventually retired from the force, and
    went off to some rustic backwater to keep bees and wasps, Beppo struck out on
    his own as a private investigator. Very few of his solo adventures have ever been
    made public, possibly due to their unremitting tedium. Poor Beppo was unfortunate
    in that he was only ever employed by clients fretting about the state of their
    taps, or their hedges, or a defective electric socket, or a cat in a tree, or
    a lost bus pass. He took to drink, and was last heard of wandering aimlessly around
    the gloomy suburbs of Tantarabim, emitting noxious fumes with every breath, and
    shouting his head off at snackbar hooligans.'
