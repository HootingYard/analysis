  text: Those of you who enjoy listening to the Hooting Yard On The Air podcasts,
    be warned. Following an important meeting chaired by Mrs Gubbins, the programmes
    will shortly be recalibrated, and you will no longer be able to listen to them
    on such equipment as iPods and mp3 players. Instead you will need to obtain a
    1952 Zenith Radio Hat. I am sure you will agree that your listening pleasure will
    be distinctly enhanced.
