  text: "You don't visit Hooting Yard to read about Paris Hilton, but there is something\
    \ magnificent about this story from yesterday's Guardian. I have emboldened the\
    \ most jaw-dropping passages:\n\u2026 the heiress and socialite yesterday appealed\
    \ to fans to sign an online petition urging California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger\
    \ to commute her 45-day sentence for driving while disqualified. \u201CIf the\
    \ late former president Gerald Ford could find it in his heart to pardon former\
    \ president Richard Nixon after his mistake(s),\u201D reads the appeal, \u201C\
    we undeniably support Paris Hilton being pardoned for her honest mistake as well,\
    \ and we expect that the governor will understand and grant this unusual but important\
    \ request.\u201D\nMs Hilton, 26, was sentenced on May 5 after being pulled over\
    \ while driving her \xA3120,000 Bentley along Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, in\
    \ February. Her licence had been suspended for 36 months last year for driving\
    \ while drunk. She had told the judge she was not aware this meant she was unable\
    \ to drive, since she never read her own mail. \u201CI have people who do that\
    \ for me,\u201D she said. \u201CI just sign what people tell me to sign.\u201D\
    \nThe letter to Mr Schwarzenegger says Ms Hilton should be freed because \u201C\
    she provides hope for young people all over the US and the world. She provides\
    \ beauty and excitement to (most of) our otherwise mundane lives.\u201D\nMs Hilton's\
    \ lawyers have filed notice of her intent to appeal. Should that fail she will\
    \ be required to present herself to the women's prison in south Los Angeles on\
    \ June 5. There she will share an austere cell, wear an orange jumpsuit and pass\
    \ the time with just three magazines or a book, though she will be in a \u201C\
    special needs\u201D wing thanks to her celebrity status."
