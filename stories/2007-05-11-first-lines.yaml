  text: 'In a piece on the Guardian Books Blog, Lee Rourke identifies "the greatest
    first line of any novel I have ever read", the opening of Ann Quin''s Berg: "A
    man called Berg, who changed his name to Greb, came to a seaside town intending
    to kill his father . . ." Some of the commenters propose their own favourite first
    lines, and one links to a list of the "hundred best" from a website called LitLine.
    There is no explanation of how the hundred were selected, or by whom, but it makes
    for an occasionally intriguing read.

    I had been thinking of compiling a list of the hundred best opening lines from
    out of print pamphlets by Dobson, and maybe one day I will do so. Certainly near
    the top of the list would be "There was a thunderstorm, and I discovered I had
    mislaid my bus pass" from How I Mislaid My Bus Pass During A Thunderstorm.

    Meanwhile, having managed to type a couple of paragraphs while wheezing and spluttering
    due to my fever-racked condition, I am going to reward myself with A Nice Cup
    Of Tea And A Sit Down.'
