  text: 'The front page of the online Guardian was recently redesigned, and there
    is a piece in today''s paper about readers'' reactions. Some people like the new
    look, some don''t. "Emily Bell [online editor... sorry, ''director of digital
    content''] has made it clear that there is no going back," apparently, but the
    disgruntled among the readership can rest assured--"she is listening to the feedback
    from users. Comments posted to her blog are being reviewed and sorted into ''silos
    of concern'' to be considered by editors, web developers and designers."

    I think what is meant here is that she has sorted out the comments, putting like
    with like. There are comments about fonts, ease of navigation, arrangement of
    menus, and so on. What I want to know is why a simple ''category'' becomes a ''silo
    of concern''? Do they think this sounds clever? Does it make the job of the unpaid
    work experience trainee doing the sorting out more exciting? "Pashmina, I want
    you to go through all the comments we''ve received and place each one in its SILO
    OF CONCERN!" I expect there is a Hub around which all the Silos are arranged,
    and each Silo will be dealt with in a series of Tranches.

    John Birt made a career out of this kind of gobbledegook in his days at the BBC,
    where an ''arrow'' became a ''directional pointing device'', for example. Why
    does no one ever take these people aside and gently point out to them that they
    are embarrassing themselves? Straightforward pomposity I could understand, but
    it''s more like the bureaucratic equivalent of teenage poetry, where the (mis)use
    of ''big words'' is a hapless attempt to confer profundity.

    According to the OED, which even the witless twelve-year-olds at the Guardian
    must have heard of, there are four distinct meanings of silo.

    Smooching With Istvan, the second Malice Aforethought Press anthology of writings
    and drawings by Mr Key and Max Decharne. Well do I remember creating the covers
    by spraying sheets of card with seven or eight different colours of car spray
    paint in a closed room. I should have opened the windows. Incidentally, it is
    within the pages of Smooching With Istvan that the words "Hooting Yard" appeared
    in print for the very first time. I will shortly be auctioning an exceedingly
    rare copy of this one hundred page collection of bran tub scrapings on eBay, but
    before doing so I will accept bids here, until noon on Saturday 19th May. A full
    eBay-style description of the book is added in the Comments. Taking advice from
    the kinds of people who advise me on such things, the starting price is PS100.'
