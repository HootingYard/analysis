  text: 'A card popped through the letterbox today from the Morning Star Church Of
    God. I wondered if this was evidence of some new alliance between the Communist
    Party and evangelical Christians. Maybe the sermons would consist of harangues
    from the editorial pages of the Morning Star about the necessity of building the
    class struggle by going on strike every five minutes. I looked in vain for a hammer-and-sickle-and-crucifix
    motif on the card, then turned my attention to the text:

    Are You A Victim?, it read, Every person is victimised by Satan, either by Depression,
    Stress, Heart Problems, Baroness, Skin Diseases, Kidney, Cancer, ENT and many
    more. No Hope + No Cure = No Peace. But There Is Hope.

    My initial surmise about the Communist element was clearly correct. Not only does
    Satan plague us with ailments and infirmities, but sets the aristocracy against
    us in the form of that Baroness. I pictured a sort of fairy tale baddie, or "Baroness"
    Margaret Thatcher, though of course it''s hard to tell the difference.

    Incidentally, when I am eventually ennobled, as is bound to happen sooner or later,
    I think I''d like to be a Baron. The title has a medieval, or Mitteleuropean quality
    about it that ''Lord'' or ''Earl'' or ''Duke'' somehow lack.'
