  text: '"In a lecture delivered at the Royal Institution, Dr Conolly, of the Hanwell
    Lunatic Asylum, speaking of the moral treatment of the insane, stated as the result
    of the experience of his whole life, that distorted views on religious subjects
    are the cause of at least two-thirds of the cases of mania in ladies, especially
    those belonging to the upper classes. Touching with all reverence on the proper
    study of religious books, Dr Conolly lamented that morbid brooding over subjects
    of theology and points of doctrine is such a fruitful cause of mental diseases...
    Although Dr Conolly''s remarks pointed generally to the impropriety and danger
    of persons--ladies especially--abandoning themselves to self-guidance, and over-prolonged
    contemplation on subjects of religious controversy, he severely commented upon
    the injurious effects of those poisonous literary emanations appearing without
    authority, and dignified most improperly by the name of ''religious''."

    I have to say that some of the greatest pleasures of my life have been found in
    morbid brooding about abstruse points of theological doctrine. Still, now I know
    better, don''t I? The quoted passage is from Things Not Generally Known by John
    Timbs (1858), where you can also read about such matters as insensibility of the
    brain, dread of eclipses, unpopular improvements, and the Death of the Beetle
    and the Giant. Clearly a work which had a profound influence on the out of print
    pamphleteer Dobson.

    Thanks to Scribal Terror.'
