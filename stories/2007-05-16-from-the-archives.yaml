  text: 'It has been suggested to me that I ought to transfer the vast Hooting Yard
    Archive 2003-2006 into this blog format so that readers can skip happily about
    tracking down their favourite items with ease. That sounds like a job for a factotum.

    While I ponder such an imponderable, I may post a few orts and scantlings from
    the Archive here, in a whimsical manner. This, for example, which first appeared
