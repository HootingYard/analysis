  text: "What land is on my map? A country I call Hoon, a land of clatter and banging,\
    \ of hideous shrubs and rivers. My eyes reject its colours\u2014it's grey and\
    \ blue in blotches. I keep a vinegar-stained map rolled up in my little suitcase.\
    \ Proud, majestic, grand, I leapfrog in the darkness. My torch shines on my map,\
    \ a map made by an idiot. One day I'll lose my thread. I'll stumble in the bracken,\
    \ catch fire, blaze, then smoulder. That land was just a rumour."
