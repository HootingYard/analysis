  text: What land is on my map? A country I call Hoon, a land of clatter and banging,
    of hideous shrubs and rivers. My eyes reject its colours--it's grey and blue in
    blotches. I keep a vinegar-stained map rolled up in my little suitcase. Proud,
    majestic, grand, I leapfrog in the darkness. My torch shines on my map, a map
    made by an idiot. One day I'll lose my thread. I'll stumble in the bracken, catch
    fire, blaze, then smoulder. That land was just a rumour.
