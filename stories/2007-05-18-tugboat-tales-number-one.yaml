  text: 'I once read a story, I can''t remember where, about a dyspeptic tugboat captain
    who wore sinister black gloves and struck fear into his crew. I remember that
    his name was Captain Bagshaw, or Shawbag, and that his tugboat was ancient and
    rusty and rotten. I think I read the story in a newspaper, which would suggest
    that it was factual rather than some made-up fiction, but I can''t be sure.

    The captain''s black gloves were made of wool, and often became tattered and frayed,
    and I recall a phrase in the story where we were told that he used to "darn them
    with malevolence". I''ve done a lot of darning in my time, for I am handy with
    needle and thread and crochet and knitting needles and suchlike, I have darned
    socks and jumpers and balaclavas and mittens, though not, admittedly, gloves,
    yet I cannot for the life of me think how I might darn something malevolently,
    though god knows I tried to, in the weeks and months after reading the story of
    Captain Bagshaw, or Shawbag, in that newspaper, if it was a newspaper. It may
    have been a periodical. I tried snarling, or spitting at passing puppy-dogs as
    I darned, but it came across as churlish and bad-tempered rather than malevolent,
    and I felt like a fool. When the captain snarled, he made a sound like the cawing
    of a thousand crows, and when he spat, he spat sulphur. There were no puppies
    on the tugboat, of course, but there was a badger. The captain did not snarl at
    it, because it was his creature, his familiar. At one point I think it is described
    as a "demonic badger", whatever that may be.

    I think we were meant to see the captain as a kind of Ahab figure, obsessed and
    mad as well as sinister, but for me this effect was flawed by the fact that it
    was a rented tugboat. Bagshaw/Shawbag did not own it. Every week he had to slip
    some coinage into the waiting palm of a seaside bureaucrat, representative of
    a dull organisation stuffed with accountants and administrators. Their main business
    seemed to be civic coastline management and prettifying, with renting out a tugboat
    to a sinister begloved madman as an afterthought. Somehow that made him less the
    master of his vessel, for me, and I remember tutting ruefully as I read the paragraph
    in which this was explained. Whoever wrote the story clearly felt it was important,
    for it was a very long paragraph, leaden with detail, and I skipped past it on
    my subsequent rereadings.

    So there was Captain Bagshaw, or Shawbag, on his rented tugboat, with his demonic
    badger and a terror-stricken crew, and then there was the radio cabin, a tiny
    cubbyhole squeezed under the orlop deck. I am no expert on maritime hoo-ha, but
    I suspect it is unusual for a tugboat to have an orlop deck, let alone a radio
    cabin. No illustrations accompanied the story, and the writer is vague on details
    about the tugboat''s specifications. I have to say that this did not bother me
    when I read it, and it was only years later, when I talked about the tugboat with
    a raddled and brine-soaked old sea dog while on holiday at O''Houlihan''s Wharf
    that I learned of these anomalies. I put them out of mind, however. I''m sure
    there are all sorts of different designs of tugboat plying the harbours of the
    world, big ones and tiny ones, rotting ones and gleaming ones, ones that fly flags
    and ones that don''t, and ones with and without orlop decks and radio cabins.

    It has only just occurred to me that we are never told the name of the tugboat.

    The captain''s handwriting was spidery, but surprisingly legible given that he
    never removed his sinister black woollen gloves, even when wielding his fashionable
    fat fountain pen. It was a sturdy pen, and it needed to be, because one of the
    captain''s enigmatic little ways was that he mixed his ink with glue. He used
    it to keep his log, of course, but was also given to scrawling commands and directives
    and warnings and decrees on sheets of foolscap and pasting them up all over the
    tugboat. One such sign was on the door of the radio cabin, forbidding any of the
    crew to enter in any circumstances, at any time, ever. The punishment for doing
    so was not made explicit, but it did not need to be, for as we have seen, Captain
    Bagshaw/Shawbag kept the tugboatists in a permanent state of stomach-churning
    terror. As a youth, if one could imagine him as a youth, he had studied the methods
    of tyrants and dictators and megalomaniacs, from Josef Stalin to Paul "Bono" Hewson,
    and once he stepped aboard his tugboat, even though it was rented, his self-belief
    carried him through. As I have indicated, I may not be convinced of his power,
    but the crew certainly were.

    Except, that is, for the latest recruit, a plug-ugly loose-limbed lantern-jawed
    feather-hatted scented and perfumed dimity deckhand who''d cut his teeth in the
    Puffin Club. I think the writer gives his name, but I can''t remember it. Let''s
    pluck a name out of the ether and call him, say, Siegfried Sassoon, for the sake
    of convenience. No, let''s not. Let''s call him Puffin Boy.

    Now, Puffin Boy, in addition to being plug-ugly and loose-limbed and lantern-jawed
    and feather-hatted and scented and perfumed and dimity, was functionally illiterate.
    He could just about manage simple three-letter words like orb and lip and jug,
    but anything more complicated was beyond him, and Bagshaw/Shawbag liked to write
    his brutish decrees in long-winded, flowery sentences so as not to waste even
    a speck of his foolscap. Thus it was that Puffin Boy blundered into the radio
    cabin quite unaware that it was off limits to such as he. Although most of the
    captain''s commands were senseless and deranged, he had good reason to keep his
    crew away from the radio. He wanted to ensure that no one twiddled the dial away
    from important seafaring information channels and tuned in to a programme very
    popular at that time, called Tugboat Crew Playtime. This was a music show which
    was bound to distract tugboat crews from their tugboat duties, for it featured
    a roster of presenters with mellifluous voices who played tunes requested by tugboat
    crew members from near and far. A typical show would include works by Glazunov,
    Borodin, Webern, Heinz Karl Gruber, Sibelius, Petula Clark, Conway Twitty, Scriabin,
    the Memphis Jug Band, Al Bowlly, Oumou Sangare, Sleater-Kinney, Silvestre Revueltas,
    Big Bill Broonzy, Bucks Fizz, Augustus Pablo, Bela Bartok, Cliff Richard and the
    Shadows, Morton Feldman, Charles Ives, Big Audio Dynamite, George Formby, Mercedes
    Sosa, Jacques Brel, Schubert, Schumann, Monteverdi, Ned Rorem, Quicksilver Messenger
    Service, Cassiber, Cab Calloway, the Psychedelic Furs, Omara Portuondo, Burning
    Spear, Peter Warlock, Carl Ruggles, the Strawberry Alarm Clock, Joan Baez, Havergal
    Brian, Dennis Brain, Cheech and Chong, Neutral Milk Hotel, and the Carpenters.
    Not only did Puffin Boy retune the radio to Tugboat Crew Playtime, but he managed
    to jam both the tuner dial and the volume knob. This was not done by design, for
    Puffin Boy was an innocent dunderpate.

    Up on the orlop deck, Captain Bagshaw/Shawbag was stalking around with his demonic
    badger in tow when his eardrums were assailed by Janacek''s Glagolitic Mass blaring
    from down below. As expected, he flew into a rage. What was unexpected was that
    he did so literally. His feet left the deck, he flapped his arms, and he found
    himself soaring forty feet above his rented tugboat. A gust of wind took him then,
    and he was carried off over the glistening sea, into the blue.

    Months later, an intrepid ornithologist was clambering around on a rocky outcrop
    buffeted by wind and waves. Peering through his Blotzmannscope, he observed a
    seabird''s nest, auks or skuas, I can''t recall, and there was the captain, in
    his sinister black gloves, scribbling on a sheet of foolscap with his fashionable
    fat fountain pen, and the birds were gathered around him screeching madly and
    trembling with terror.

    I wish I could tell you what became of the tugboat and its crew, particularly
    Puffin Boy, but the writer confesses he does not know. Perhaps one day I will
    remember where I read the story, and track down a copy, and find out whether it
    is truth or fiction, and tell it to you properly.'
