  text: 'An extract from Mrs Gubbins'' so-called Mission Statement:

    "We will seek new ways to enhance our readers'' Hooting Yard experience. For example,
    we should strain mightily to harness the awesome power of the interweb to create
    what I think are known as multimedia formats. We should exploit different platforms
    and portals. The site will strive to be a critical hub for the Hooting Yard community.
    Now get on with it! You can make a start by bunging in a few pictures so that
    readers can visualise those Frankish kings mentioned in Annals Of The Frankish
    Kings, or at least some of them."

    Ever mindful that Mrs Gubbins has a matchless grasp of what really matters in
    this often perplexing world, we have taken her advice. Here, then, are three of
    those Frankish kings.


    Pippin The Short


    Charles The Fat
