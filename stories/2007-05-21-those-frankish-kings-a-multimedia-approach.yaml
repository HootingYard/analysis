  text: "An extract from Mrs Gubbins\u2019 so-called Mission Statement:\n\u201CWe\
    \ will seek new ways to enhance our readers\u2019 Hooting Yard experience. For\
    \ example, we should strain mightily to harness the awesome power of the interweb\
    \ to create what I think are known as multimedia formats. We should exploit different\
    \ platforms and portals. The site will strive to be a critical hub for the Hooting\
    \ Yard community. Now get on with it! You can make a start by bunging in a few\
    \ pictures so that readers can visualise those Frankish kings mentioned in Annals\
    \ Of The Frankish Kings, or at least some of them.\u201D\nEver mindful that Mrs\
    \ Gubbins has a matchless grasp of what really matters in this often perplexing\
    \ world, we have taken her advice. Here, then, are three of those Frankish kings.\n\
    \nPippin The Short\n\nCharles The Fat\n\nLouis The Pious"
