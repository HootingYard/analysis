  text: 'An extract from Mrs Gubbins'' so-called Mission Statement:

    "We will seek new ways to enhance our readers'' Hooting Yard experience. For example,
    we should strain mightily to harness the awesome power of the interweb to create
    what I think are known as multimedia formats. We should exploit different platforms
    and portals. The site will strive to be a critical hub for the Hooting Yard community.
    Now get on with it! You can make a start by bunging in a few pictures so that
    readers can visualise those Frankish kings mentioned in Annals Of The Frankish
    Kings, or at least some of them."

    Ever mindful that Mrs Gubbins has a matchless grasp of what really matters in
    this often perplexing world, we have taken her advice. Here, then, are three of
    those Frankish kings.


    Pippin The Short


    Charles The Fat


    Louis The Pious'
