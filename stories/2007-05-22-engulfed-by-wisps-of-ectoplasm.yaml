  text: 'Unfortunately, Madame Boubou did not enclose a snapshot of her engulfment
    by ectoplasm with her Message From Beyond. As luck would have it, a trawl through
    the Hooting Yard Archives turned up this picture which enables lucky readers to
    see with their own eyes the amazing phenomenon of ectoplasmic hoo-ha:


    According to The Minnie Harrison Page, what we see here is "ectoplasm emanating
    from the Medium''s mouth. Taken in complete darkness using Kodak infra-red plate.
    Exposure by means of powerful ''Sashalight'' bulb through ''Wratten'' glass filter--extremely
    deep ruby-red colour. The Ectoplasm is emanating from her mouth and in this form
    it is quite transparent, very similar in appearance and texture to chiffon."

    Those of you who think Minnie Harrison is sitting there in her 1948 Middlesbrough
    sitting room with a net curtain stuffed in her mouth are sadly deluded and will
    not get a helping of Madame Boubou''s delicious Boiled Rhubarb Surprise.'
