  text: "Unfortunately, Madame Boubou did not enclose a snapshot of her engulfment\
    \ by ectoplasm with her Message From Beyond. As luck would have it, a trawl through\
    \ the Hooting Yard Archives turned up this picture which enables lucky readers\
    \ to see with their own eyes the amazing phenomenon of ectoplasmic hoo-ha:\n\n\
    According to The Minnie Harrison Page, what we see here is \u201Cectoplasm emanating\
    \ from the Medium's mouth. Taken in complete darkness using Kodak infra-red plate.\
    \ Exposure by means of powerful \u2018Sashalight\u2019 bulb through \u2018Wratten\u2019\
    \ glass filter\u2014extremely deep ruby-red colour. The Ectoplasm is emanating\
    \ from her mouth and in this form it is quite transparent, very similar in appearance\
    \ and texture to chiffon.\u201D\nThose of you who think Minnie Harrison is sitting\
    \ there in her 1948 Middlesbrough sitting room with a net curtain stuffed in her\
    \ mouth are sadly deluded and will not get a helping of Madame Boubou's delicious\
    \ Boiled Rhubarb Surprise."
