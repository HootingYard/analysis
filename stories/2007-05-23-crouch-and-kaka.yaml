  text: 'Apparently, Crouch is big threat says Kaka. At least, that''s what it said
    in big black letters on a stapled bundle of paper I noticed while sitting on a
    bus yesterday. There was smaller lettering underneath, lots of it, also black
    on a white background, but I was too far away to be able to read it.

    Having digested Kaka''s view of the threat from Crouch, I turned my head to look
    out of the window at the passing scene. There were all sorts of words to read
    outside, in all different colours: Tasty Snacks in red on yellow, Cheung Wah Loon
    red on white, STOP, all in upper case, black on white with a red trim, and Furniture
    Wanted in gold on green were just some I saw, among many, many others. But somehow
    I couldn''t get the Kaka/Crouch doo-dah out of my head.

    Later, back at home, I poured some boiled water into a cup and added an infusion
    of something I understood might dampen the fires in my brainpan. The infusion
    turned the water brown, but had little effect on the spongiform grey blob inside
    my skull, which was still throbbing away. I assumed that Kaka had good reason
    to see Crouch as a threat--indeed a big threat--and wondered if I too should feel
    imperilled, and if so what precautions I could take. The problem was that I did
    not understand the nature of the threat Crouch posed. Should I barricade myself
    inside my home, or was it a case of getting some tablets from the chemist? If
    I did both, I might be overreacting and laying myself open to ridicule, not for
    the first time, of course, but still...

    On the other hand, if I did neither, or if I failed to come up with any kind of
    defence against Crouch, who knew what might become of me? It is at times of quandary
    like this that some people turn to God, but I have read my Dawkins and Dennett
    and Harris and Hitchens and I wasn''t going to fall for that one. Incense and
    a kneeling posture wouldn''t help me if Crouch came smashing into my life wreaking
    whatever havoc Crouch wreaked. Kaka would be more help to me than God, I realised,
    could at least give me some handy tips on anti-Crouch techniques, but I had no
    idea how I might go about contacting Kaka. Despite its insipid taste and ineffectual
    brain-soothing properties, I gulped down another cup of the infusion and pondered
    what to do next.

    My first idea was to go out onto the balcony and shout "Kaka! Kaka! Kaka!", like
    some kind of secular muezzin, hoping that Kaka might be in the vicinity and would
    respond to my call. The chances of this were so remote that I swiftly dismissed
    it as the act of a poltroon. I have read exhaustively on the subject of poltroonery
    over the years, and believe me, it was not a fellowship I wished to join. Wild
    horses probably could drag me to a poltroon conclave, I do not think I would be
    strong enough to resist their demented equine force, but fingers crossed there
    were no nearby horses of sufficient wildness to do the deed.

    Another idea occurred to me, which was that I could arm myself with a hammer and
    a hacksaw and stalk the streets in search of Crouch. This too I dismissed, partly
    because I was unsure if a hammer and a hacksaw would be weaponry enough to finish
    Crouch off in one go, and partly because I did not want to risk getting an Asbo.
    I had only just got my bus pass and library tickets back after a confiscation
    order, and that was a road I never wanted to go down again.

    Dusk was falling. I spat into my tin spittoon and switched on the bairdboard bombardment
    box. On the screen, a glassy-eyed noodlehead was shrieking: "Who is the biggest
    threat? Crouch or Kaka? You decide! For Crouch, call 09567398762543 01. For Kaka,
    call 09567398762543 02."

    My brainpan whirled in a miasma of chaos. What fragile mooring I had in the here
    and now was snapped asunder. The hideous import of the noodlehead''s words was
    that Kaka too was a threat! It was not, as I thought, that Crouch spelled imperilment
    and Kaka provided sage counsel. It was a twin-pronged attack. How cruelly I had
    been deceived by the stapled bundle of paper on the bus!

    There was only one thing to do. I kicked the knob on the box to silence the still-shrieking
    noodlehead, pulled on an item of casual knitwear, and strode out towards the cluster
    of community hubs. Ah, but I carried on past them, not looking back, until I reached
    the civic pond, and I sat there in the twilight on the damp grass, and a moorhen
    paddled towards me and fixed me with its moorhen stare, and I stared defiantly
    back, and the space between us fizzled with silent and invisible sparks, until
    I was the moorhen, and the moorhen was me.'
