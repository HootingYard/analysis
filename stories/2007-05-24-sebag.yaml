  text: 'Young Stalin sounds like an instructive and entertaining biography, and I
    will add it to my reading list. I mention it here, though, simply as an excuse
    to celebrate the name of the author, Simon Sebag Montefiore. I want that middle
    name! Granted, Frank Sebag Key does not have the mellifluous multisyllabic beauty
    of Simon Sebag Montefiore, but it will have to do.

    Herman Melville''s Moby Dick; or The Whale is a work of matchless genius, and
    it may be considered sacrilege to tamper with the text. I can''t help but feel,
    however, that if the opening line was "Call me Sebag" it would somehow be even
    better.

    Incidentally, I discovered that Simon Sebag Montefiore is married to the sister
    of Tara Palmer-Tomkinson. A rich pap-brained partygoer is an unlikely Hooting
    Yard heroine, but I have had a measure of admiration for Ms Palmer-Tomkinson ever
    since, on television a few years ago, she uttered the immortal line "Those are
    Uri''s underpants. Burn them". Uri being, of course, the dismal charlatan Uri
    Geller.'
