  text: 'I have had a couple of enquiries from readers asking if Hubermann''s department
    store (motto: a byword for utter gorgeousness) has a mail order service. Hubermann''s
    was mentioned in both Balsa Wood Crow and Annals Of The Frankish Kings, for those
    of you who need to catch up. I am slightly fretful about Tim Thurn, whose request
    is rather more specific.

    Dear Frank, he writes, I am on the lookout for a penis-melting Zionist robot comb,
    not the kind of item a diffident chap like me is going to march into a shop and
    ask for, even in a whisper. I wonder if Hubermann''s runs a mail order service,
    and if so whether this is the kind of thing I might find in its catalogue?

    Well, Tim, even if Hubermann''s did do mail order, this is not the kind of thing
    you''d find in it, for the simple reason that a penis-melting Zionist robot comb
    lacks gorgeousness. Only the gorgeous is to be found in that legendary department
    store.

    The original shop was opened in 1909 by Jacopo Hubermann, and sold only cream
    crackers, shellac and baize. It was Jacopo''s paramour Loopy, an international
    woman of intrigue, who extended the range of stock to include other forms of gorgeousness.
    She believed firmly that the gorgeous could be found in all things, both expensive
    and cheap, hand-crafted and mass-produced, decorative and functional. At times,
    her choices--and those of the smitten Jacopo--were questionable, and stretched
    the definition of gorgeousness to an alarming degree. Loopy was very fond, for
    example, of mud-splattered gewgaws and filthy discarded things, some of which
    crumbled to dust when picked up. Just before the Great War, she was given the
    run of what became the "bargain bin basement" of Hubermann''s in its new premises,
    a fin de siecle monstrosity which had previously been the headquarters of a SMERSHesque
    cabal. There were rumours that Loopy continued the cabal''s sinister business
    from her hidey-hole next to the pneumatic piping system hub, but that was probably
    just tittle-tattle. Queer stories attached themselves to Jacopo Hubermann, too,
    for it was said that his limp was exaggerated, that his startling walrus moustache
    was counterfeit, that his penumbra of sobriety masked the looning of a madcap,
    and that his cakes were mere crumbs, and breadcrumbs at that. All false, of course,
    for the signal fact about Hubermann was that he shimmered like a saint.

    Today there is no bargain bin basement, and the pneumatic piping system has been
    replaced by a new-fangled uberpneumatic piping system, but otherwise Hubermann''s
    is, as it has been for nigh on a hundred years, the brightest star in the retail
    sector firmament. The absence of a mail order service so perplexed Dobson that
    he wrote a pamphlet on the subject, which is regrettably out of print. He devoted
    almost forty pages to worrying away at the problem, but was unable to reach a
    sensible conclusion. By the time he finished writing his essay, he was in such
    a foul temper that Marigold Chew dragged him off to the snackbar at Hubermann''s
    to stuff his face with lemon meringue pie.

    Incidentally, the snackbar at Hubermann''s is the very same snackbar where lumbered
    and stalked the snackbar hooligans mentioned at the end of Cargpan And Beppo.
    And so we find that everything in this world is linked by loops of intricate yet
    unfathomable significance. Or so it seems.'
