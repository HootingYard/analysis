  text: "What better way to spend a wet Bank Holiday afternoon than to curl up in\
    \ front of the television to watch a trilogy of films by one of the great unsung\
    \ auteurs of the silent screen? The cable channel UK Golden Pap is to be congratulated\
    \ for screening the masterworks of the great\u2014and greatly misunderstood\u2014\
    Pabstus Tack. When Tack's films are mentioned, which is rarely, they are dismissed\
    \ as fey, twee confections for children, in an age when childhood was seen as\
    \ a time of purity and innocence. Thus the damning rebuke of a cravat-wearing,\
    \ pipe-smoking, goatee-bearded critic like Jean-Luc Boff, who wrote: \u201CWith\
    \ these insipid pieces of froth, Tack not only drains his films of sound and colour,\
    \ but also of plot, tension, engagement, disturbance, of life and death and sex.\u201D\
    \nWhat Boff says is true, yet he fails to understand just how radical an approach\
    \ Tack took. Yes, these films are indeed fey and twee, yet at the same time they\
    \ are cloying and saccharine, miraculously inoffensive, whimsical in the most\
    \ nauseating sense of the word.\nThe first in the trilogy is Pippi The Pony Goes\
    \ To The Paddling Pool. The part of Pippi was played by Tack's own pony, Poopy,\
    \ a placid, well-groomed little darling with gossamer ribbons flowing from its\
    \ mane. In silent black and white, we watch as Pippi canters towards a paddling\
    \ pool and splashes about, gently and charmingly. There are no fancy camera angles,\
    \ no clever-clever montage. \u201CLook,\u201D Tack is saying, \u201CA pony in\
    \ a paddling pool.\u201D\nHe followed this up with Biffy The Africanised Killer\
    \ Bee Joins A Swarm. In this, possibly the finest of the three films, Biffy\u2014\
    played by Tack's pet Africanised killer bee, Letitia\u2014is shown buzzing around\
    \ a municipal flowerbed, then going off to join a swarm of her fellows. Tack's\
    \ camera is static except at the very end, where it pans to show Biffy's journey\
    \ from solitude to companionship.\nThe last film is the one where Tack takes the\
    \ greatest risk with his creative vision. With Schmoopy The Vampire Bat Sucks\
    \ The Life-Blood From A Consumptive Orphan the task of retaining a quintessentially\
    \ Tackesque tweeness must at times have seemed impossible. But once again, the\
    \ auteur in Tack pulls it off, in a magnificently sugar-coated fairy cake of a\
    \ film. Schmoopy, by the way, was played by Tack's own vampire bat, Flopsy, while\
    \ the part of the consumptive orphan went to a doe-eyed\u2014and consumptive\u2014\
    orphan the director found swooning and crumpled, clutching weakly at the railings\
    \ of Pang Hill Orphanage during a blizzard.\nIf there is a better way to spend\
    \ eleven hours on a wet Bank Holiday than watching these films, I for one am at\
    \ a loss to think what it might be."
