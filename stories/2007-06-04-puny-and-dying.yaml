  text: 'Yesterday I listened, belatedly, to a Little Atoms interview with Jonathan
    Meades. (It''s available for download here--the second one, dated 11 May 2007,
    though the earlier interview is well worth your attention too.) Each Little Atoms
    show has a musical interlude, often chosen by the guest. The magnificent Meades,
    perhaps the only reason to watch television these days, picked La canzone dell''amore
    perduto by Fabrizio de Andre. Not being at all familiar with Italian cantautores
    of the late twentieth century, his name was new to me, but I adored the song,
    so I decided to find out more. You can go and read his wikipedia entry, as I did,
    and do further research if you so wish, as I haven''t, yet.

    The entry devotes a paragraph to de Andre''s kidnapping by Sardinian bandits in
    1979, which is interesting, but I thought I''d draw your attention to two other
    things, mentioned in passing, that particularly intrigued me.

    De Andre''s first wife was named Puny. This is a superbly Hooting Yardish name,
    isn''t it? I do not think it will be too long before a character named Puny turns
    up in a piece of prose here, perhaps one that features heroic infant Tiny Enid.
    I recall that somewhere or other I refer to a book or film entitled I Was Puny
    Vercingetorix, and though puny there was intended as an adjective rather than
    as a first name, I may have to revisit that in the light of my new knowledge.

    The other thing that made me slap my forehead with glee was the title of de Andre''s
    second album--or rather, the contrast between it and the titles between which
    it was bracketed. (Forgive those two ''between''s, I can''t think offhand of a
    more felicitous way of putting it.) The first album was called Volume One, and
    the third was dubbed Volume Three. Yet for some extraordinary reason, the title
    of what a lesser artist would have called Volume Two was instead Tutti morimmo
    a stento, or We All Died Agonizingly.

    That''s the thing about Jonathan Meades, he provides you with new and unexpected
    avenues to explore, even when he''s just picking a piece of music.'
