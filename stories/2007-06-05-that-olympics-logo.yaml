  text: 'The new logo for the 2012 London Olympics has caused a flap. Sorry, it''s
    not a logo, it''s a brand, a brand which, according to diminutive Culture Secretary
    Tessa Jowell, "takes our values to the world beyond our shores, acting both as
    an invitation and an inspiration". I agree, and I know that Hooting Yard''s values
    are exactly the same in every last detail as Tessa''s. In fact, at an editorial
    conclave the other day, loveable octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins looked up from
    her knitting and said "When in doubt, just ask ''What would Tessa Jowell do?''"
    and we all nodded in recognition of the deep wisdom of those words. (All except
    the bloated janitor, of course, who still swears by Blunkett, but that''s another
    story.)

    Certain people seem to think that the logo--the brand, the brand!--is devoid of
    content and meaning, and make the same charge against Tessa''s words. Such carping
    is only to be expected. For my money, anything Tessa Jowell says ought to be carved
    in stone and studied, much as one would study the work of a great literary giant.
    The rewards are immense.

    To show that I know what I''m talking about, we commissioned a new Hooting Yard
    brand, the better to embody our values. It cost slightly more than the PS400,000
    price tag of the Olympic thing of beauty, but I''m sure you will agree that it
    was money well spent. At a meeting to identify funding, the vitamin-deficient
    inmates of Pang Hill Orphanage insisted that they can cope with severely reduced
    gruel rations for the next forty years. Indeed, they have never looked so blissful.
