  text: "The new logo for the 2012 London Olympics has caused a flap. Sorry, it's\
    \ not a logo, it's a brand, a brand which, according to diminutive Culture Secretary\
    \ Tessa Jowell, \u201Ctakes our values to the world beyond our shores, acting\
    \ both as an invitation and an inspiration\u201D. I agree, and I know that Hooting\
    \ Yard's values are exactly the same in every last detail as Tessa's. In fact,\
    \ at an editorial conclave the other day, loveable octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins\
    \ looked up from her knitting and said \u201CWhen in doubt, just ask \u2018What\
    \ would Tessa Jowell do?\u2019\u201D and we all nodded in recognition of the deep\
    \ wisdom of those words. (All except the bloated janitor, of course, who still\
    \ swears by Blunkett, but that's another story.)\nCertain people seem to think\
    \ that the logo\u2014the brand, the brand!\u2014is devoid of content and meaning,\
    \ and make the same charge against Tessa's words. Such carping is only to be expected.\
    \ For my money, anything Tessa Jowell says ought to be carved in stone and studied,\
    \ much as one would study the work of a great literary giant. The rewards are\
    \ immense.\nTo show that I know what I'm talking about, we commissioned a new\
    \ Hooting Yard brand, the better to embody our values. It cost slightly more than\
    \ the \xA3400,000 price tag of the Olympic thing of beauty, but I'm sure you will\
    \ agree that it was money well spent. At a meeting to identify funding, the vitamin-deficient\
    \ inmates of Pang Hill Orphanage insisted that they can cope with severely reduced\
    \ gruel rations for the next forty years. Indeed, they have never looked so blissful.\n"
