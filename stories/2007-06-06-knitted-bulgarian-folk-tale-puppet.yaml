  text: 'Ahoy, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, Thank you so much for affording us
    readers a glimpse of the inner workings of Hooting Yard in your piece on that
    Olympics logo. Brief as it was, I was fascinated by the reference to the editorial
    conclave, and to the fact that the bloated janitor remains an unreconstructed
    Blunkettite. The real reason I am writing, however, is because I am desperate
    to find out what Mrs Gubbins was knitting. Can you tell me?

    Well, Ruth, yes I can! A few weeks ago, the octogenarian crone was approached
    by a charity working with the filthy and destitute denizens of that cluster of
    hovels out Pointy Town way. As you may know, these ill-starred wretches are even
    lower than the lowest of the low, wallowing in a dank pit of turpitude and lacking
    even the most basic sanitation. Other charitable organisations shun them because,
    you know, there are limits. Anyway, Mrs Gubbins was asked to knit something for
    them, and she wisely decided to bring a little joy to their hearts--if they actually
    have beating human hearts--by making for them a life-size knitted puppet of Ugo,
    hero of a series of exciting Bulgarian folk tales.

    We have published a number of Ugo stories here at Hooting Yard, so this would
    be an opportune time to pluck them from the Archive and present all six here afresh,
    some three years after they originally appeared:

    Ugo Goofs Off

    Ugo lived in Plovdiv. In the fog, Ugo goofed off. "There you go, Ugo, goofing
    off again," said Ugo''s ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo. He got it on
    his boots. "Ma, I''ve got goo on my boots," said Ugo. Ugo''s ma gave him a rag
    to wipe the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws. Gewgaws and rags.
    Ugo''s ma was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on his boots, she opened
    the drawer of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for a rag rather than a gewgaw,
    for if she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn''t get the goo off his boots, but with
    a rag he would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing off and wiped the goo off his
    boots with a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.

    Ugo''s Pal Ulf

    In Plovdiv, Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. "Look at my bubo, Ugo,"
    said Ulf. "Oooh!" said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu. His ma made
    him a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about Ulf''s bubo.
    In the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo''s ma
    brought food for Ulf. "Have some pancakes, Ulf," said Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake.
    "Far be it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf," said Ugo''s ma, "But you should put the
    pancake on your bubo, like a poultice." "Oh," said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon
    his bubo was gone. But Ugo still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop.
    She could cure the plague but not the flu, and did not know what else she could
    do. For the time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.

    Ugo''s Pod

    In the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stool. Ugo''s ma said,
    "Ugo, why are you using a pod instead of a jar?" Ugo''s ma was blind, but she
    knew that the plop of Ugo''s pod was different to the plop of his jar. "Oh, ma,"
    said Ugo, "My jar is in the shed." Ugo''s ma bashed Ugo on the head. "Never leave
    your jar in the shed, Ugo," she said, "When you do I will bash you on the head,
    as I just did." Ugo said, "Sorry, ma. My pal Ulf put my jar in the shed." "Ah,"
    said Ugo''s ma. On Thursday last. In a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv.

    Ugo''s New Hooter

    Back in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter in his
    blind ma''s ear. "Ooh, Ugo," said Ugo''s ma, "That hooter makes a din!" "It''s
    a hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize," said Ugo. "And what did your pal Ulf
    win, Ugo?" asked Ugo''s ma, shelling peas as she spoke. "Ulf won a toy wolf, ma,"
    said Ugo, "It''s as noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your
    thumb on its tum, the toy wolf that Ulf won roars." Ugo tooted his hooter again
    and ran off to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.

    Ugo Turns Blue

    It was Saint Hector''s Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo''s hood got snagged
    on a tack and he turned blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. "Oooo" said
    Ugo''s pal Ulf, "Ugo, you look all blue." "Ack" said Ugo. "I''ll go and fetch
    your blind ma, Ugo, to see what she can do," said Ulf, though he could have pulled
    Ugo''s hood off the tack on which it was snagged. But Ulf had been sniffing glue.
    Ulf found Ugo''s ma sitting on a stool. "Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "Ugo has turned
    blue. His hood is snagged on a tack." Ugo''s ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped
    off her stool and ran to Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Ugo''s ma spat out her
    chew, and it landed in a pot of glue. It was the glue Ugo''s pal Ulf had been
    sniffing. Ugo''s ma unsnagged Ugo''s hood from the tack. "Ack" said Ugo. "Ooo,
    Ugo''s ma, I knew you would know what to do," said Ulf. Ugo''s ma clouted Ulf
    on the head with a spoon, and confiscated his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes.
    It was time for mass. At Saint Hector''s Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.

    Ugo Goes Loopy

    One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the
    yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard, Ugo''s
    blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo started
    to sound like a goose. "Ooo," said Ugo''s ma, "What am I to do? A shrew and a
    goose!" Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. "Wow!" said Ugo''s pal Ulf, who came
    tumbling into the yard dressed up like a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. "Is that
    you, Ugo''s pal Ulf?" asked Ugo''s ma. "Woo woo woo," said Ulf. "Ulf, there is
    a shrew and a goose and a cow in my yard," said Ugo''s ma. "No, Ugo''s ma," said
    Ulf, "It''s only Ugo being loopy." "Ah," said Ugo''s ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo''s
    pal Ulf off to school. On a tram. In Plovdiv.'
