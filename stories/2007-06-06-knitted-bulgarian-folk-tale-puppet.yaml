  text: "Ahoy, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, Thank you so much for affording us\
    \ readers a glimpse of the inner workings of Hooting Yard in your piece on that\
    \ Olympics logo. Brief as it was, I was fascinated by the reference to the editorial\
    \ conclave, and to the fact that the bloated janitor remains an unreconstructed\
    \ Blunkettite. The real reason I am writing, however, is because I am desperate\
    \ to find out what Mrs Gubbins was knitting. Can you tell me?\nWell, Ruth, yes\
    \ I can! A few weeks ago, the octogenarian crone was approached by a charity working\
    \ with the filthy and destitute denizens of that cluster of hovels out Pointy\
    \ Town way. As you may know, these ill-starred wretches are even lower than the\
    \ lowest of the low, wallowing in a dank pit of turpitude and lacking even the\
    \ most basic sanitation. Other charitable organisations shun them because, you\
    \ know, there are limits. Anyway, Mrs Gubbins was asked to knit something for\
    \ them, and she wisely decided to bring a little joy to their hearts\u2014if they\
    \ actually have beating human hearts\u2014by making for them a life-size knitted\
    \ puppet of Ugo, hero of a series of exciting Bulgarian folk tales.\nWe have published\
    \ a number of Ugo stories here at Hooting Yard, so this would be an opportune\
    \ time to pluck them from the Archive and present all six here afresh, some three\
    \ years after they originally appeared:\nUgo Goofs Off\nUgo lived in Plovdiv.\
    \ In the fog, Ugo goofed off. \u201CThere you go, Ugo, goofing off again,\u201D\
    \ said Ugo's ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo. He got it on his boots.\
    \ \u201CMa, I've got goo on my boots,\u201D said Ugo. Ugo's ma gave him a rag\
    \ to wipe the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws. Gewgaws and rags.\
    \ Ugo's ma was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on his boots, she opened\
    \ the drawer of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for a rag rather than a\
    \ gewgaw, for if she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn't get the goo off his boots,\
    \ but with a rag he would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing off and wiped the\
    \ goo off his boots with a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.\nUgo's Pal Ulf\nIn Plovdiv,\
    \ Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. \u201CLook at my bubo, Ugo,\u201D\
    \ said Ulf. \u201COooh!\u201D said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu.\
    \ His ma made him a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about\
    \ Ulf's bubo. In the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo\
    \ and Ugo's ma brought food for Ulf. \u201CHave some pancakes, Ulf,\u201D said\
    \ Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake. \u201CFar be it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf,\u201D\
    \ said Ugo's ma, \u201CBut you should put the pancake on your bubo, like a poultice.\u201D\
    \ \u201COh,\u201D said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon his bubo was gone. But Ugo\
    \ still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop. She could cure the plague\
    \ but not the flu, and did not know what else she could do. For the time being.\
    \ In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.\nUgo's Pod\nIn the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped\
    \ his pod onto a stool. Ugo's ma said, \u201CUgo, why are you using a pod instead\
    \ of a jar?\u201D Ugo's ma was blind, but she knew that the plop of Ugo's pod\
    \ was different to the plop of his jar. \u201COh, ma,\u201D said Ugo, \u201CMy\
    \ jar is in the shed.\u201D Ugo's ma bashed Ugo on the head. \u201CNever leave\
    \ your jar in the shed, Ugo,\u201D she said, \u201CWhen you do I will bash you\
    \ on the head, as I just did.\u201D Ugo said, \u201CSorry, ma. My pal Ulf put\
    \ my jar in the shed.\u201D \u201CAh,\u201D said Ugo's ma. On Thursday last. In\
    \ a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv.\nUgo's New Hooter\nBack in Plovdiv, Ugo\
    \ won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter in his blind ma's ear.\
    \ \u201COoh, Ugo,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201CThat hooter makes a din!\u201D \u201C\
    It's a hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize,\u201D said Ugo. \u201CAnd what did\
    \ your pal Ulf win, Ugo?\u201D asked Ugo's ma, shelling peas as she spoke. \u201C\
    Ulf won a toy wolf, ma,\u201D said Ugo, \u201CIt's as noisy as my booby prize\
    \ hooter, because when you press your thumb on its tum, the toy wolf that Ulf\
    \ won roars.\u201D Ugo tooted his hooter again and ran off to find Ulf. On a very\
    \ wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.\nUgo Turns Blue\nIt was Saint Hector's\
    \ Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo's hood got snagged on a tack and he turned\
    \ blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. \u201COooo\u201D said Ugo's pal\
    \ Ulf, \u201CUgo, you look all blue.\u201D \u201CAck\u201D said Ugo. \u201CI'll\
    \ go and fetch your blind ma, Ugo, to see what she can do,\u201D said Ulf, though\
    \ he could have pulled Ugo's hood off the tack on which it was snagged. But Ulf\
    \ had been sniffing glue. Ulf found Ugo's ma sitting on a stool. \u201CUgo's ma,\u201D\
    \ said Ulf, \u201CUgo has turned blue. His hood is snagged on a tack.\u201D Ugo's\
    \ ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool and ran to Ugo, who was\
    \ indeed very blue. Ugo's ma spat out her chew, and it landed in a pot of glue.\
    \ It was the glue Ugo's pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo's ma unsnagged Ugo's hood\
    \ from the tack. \u201CAck\u201D said Ugo. \u201COoo, Ugo's ma, I knew you would\
    \ know what to do,\u201D said Ulf. Ugo's ma clouted Ulf on the head with a spoon,\
    \ and confiscated his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass.\
    \ At Saint Hector's Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.\nUgo Goes Loopy\n\
    One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the\
    \ yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard,\
    \ Ugo's blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo\
    \ started to sound like a goose. \u201COoo,\u201D said Ugo's ma, \u201CWhat am\
    \ I to do? A shrew and a goose!\u201D Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. \u201C\
    Wow!\u201D said Ugo's pal Ulf, who came tumbling into the yard dressed up like\
    \ a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. \u201CIs that you, Ugo's pal Ulf?\u201D asked\
    \ Ugo's ma. \u201CWoo woo woo,\u201D said Ulf. \u201CUlf, there is a shrew and\
    \ a goose and a cow in my yard,\u201D said Ugo's ma. \u201CNo, Ugo's ma,\u201D\
    \ said Ulf, \u201CIt's only Ugo being loopy.\u201D \u201CAh,\u201D said Ugo's\
    \ ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo's pal Ulf off to school. On a tram. In Plovdiv."
