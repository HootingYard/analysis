  text: 'I read somewhere last week that Mohammed is now the second most popular name
    for newborn boys in the UK. It strikes me as a bit odd that you can get beheaded
    for drawing a picture of the Prophet Mohammed, but it''s perfectly fine to attach
    his name to your son. Still, there is much about Islam that I find perplexing,
    such as a recent fatwa in Egypt which allows an unmarried woman to work in an
    office alongside men so long as she breastfeeds each of them five times to create
    a familial bond. Now there''s a sensible idea.

    Anyway, I was prompted to think about boys'' names, and more particularly what
    name I would ideally like to see in the number one spot above Mohammed. Readers
    will know that I am very keen on Sebag, but my current choice to become the most
    popular boys'' name is Suetonius.

    Not only is it a splendid, resounding name, but of course it also commemorates
    the author of The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars. Suetonius--whose full name was
    Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus--can be seen as a kind of Dobson-like figure, in that
    many of his works are terminally out of print. That is, they are lost, possibly
    forever. We know that he wrote, among other things, Physical Defects Of Mankind,
    Lives Of Famous Whores, and an essay on Critical Signs Used In Books, but no trace
    of them survives. Luckily, we do have the rattling good read that is The Lives
    Of The Twelve Caesars.

    George Costanza, in Seinfeld, favoured the names Soda and Seven, neither of which
    holds a candle to Suetonius in my opinion. So if there are any expectant parents
    reading this, and your newborn is a boy, do the decent thing and name him after
    the Roman Ur-Dobson. And mothers please note! While I would recommend breastfeeding,
    it would probably be a good idea to limit the milk supply to little Suetonius,
    rather than sharing it out among those unprepossessing gits in the accounts department.'
