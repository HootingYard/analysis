  text: 'Hooting Yard is excited (possibly overexcited) to announce publication of
    Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars, a decisively sensible novella
    of high adventure, derring-do, and baffling conspiracies. Prior knowledge of arcane
    philatelic imponderables is useful, but not necessary. The book also contains
    two shorter pieces, one of which features mute blind magnetic love monkeys.
