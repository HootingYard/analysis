  text: "He washed his boots in the bath with a scrubbing brush. That is what he did\
    \ when he got mud on his boots. He took off his boots and placed them on a mat\
    \ and he filled the bath with boiling water. Then he plunged his boots into the\
    \ bath. He put on a pair of gloves before he plunged his boots so the flesh on\
    \ his hands would not burn. When the boots were in the bath he sprinkled soap\
    \ flakes from a box on the surface of the boiling water. Then he went to fetch\
    \ the scrubbing brush. The scrubbing brush was nowhere near the bath, he had to\
    \ go up and down stairs to get it from its hook. There was a hole drilled in the\
    \ handle of the scrubbing brush so it could be held by the hook. The hook was\
    \ fixed to the wall. It was a fixture and fitting. The scrubbing brush was not.\
    \ It was an appurtenance. He neither knew nor cared which was a fixture and fitting\
    \ and which was an appurtenance. His only concern was to get the mud off his boots.\
    \ He scrubbed his boots with the scrubbing brush while the boots were submerged\
    \ in the bathwater to which he had added soap flakes from a box. The mud came\
    \ off his boots in chunks. When the last flecks of mud had been scrubbed off his\
    \ boots he took the boots out of the bath and placed them back on the mat. The\
    \ mat was made of rubber. He pulled the plug out of the plughole in the bottom\
    \ of the bath and the bathwater drained away. While the water drained he took\
    \ the scrubbing brush up and down stairs and put it back on its hook. He tore\
    \ off his gloves and threw them down a chute. At the bottom of the chute was a\
    \ pile of other gloves and such things as shirts and socks and tunics. Once a\
    \ week the pile was swept into a hamper and taken off to be washed. But not today.\
    \ He went up and down stairs to the room with the bath in it and looked at his\
    \ boots on the mat until they were dry. Then he put on his boots. Just in time!\
    \ He heard the toot of a whistle. He sprinted up and down stairs and past the\
    \ place where the scrubbing brush hung on its hook and carried on out of the door\
    \ and through the garden gate and he sprinted round and round the running track\
    \ until the whistle tooted again. He stopped and panted and looked expectantly\
    \ at the whistle tooting person. The whistle tooting person was studying his stopwatch.\
    \ O how he hoped that this time he had sprinted round and round the running track\
    \ faster than the last time he had sprinted round and round the running track!\
    \ Then he had had mud on his boots but now he had washed them in the boiling hot\
    \ bath with a scrubbing brush and soap flakes from a box and there was no longer\
    \ any mud on his boots. A nod from the whistle tooting person told him he had\
    \ sprinted round and round the running track faster than before. He was O so happy!\n\
