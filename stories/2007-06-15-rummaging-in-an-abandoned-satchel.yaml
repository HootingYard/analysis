  text: 'The other day I had some harsh words to say about the out of print pamphleteer
    Dobson''s song-writing skills. "No one with any sense has ever listened to a Dobson
    song more than once", I wrote. Well, it seems I was mistaken. I was rummaging
    in a satchel that I found abandoned on a canal towpath, and I came upon indisputable
    evidence that at least one sensible person admired a Dobson song so much that
    they recorded a cover version of it. The song in question is one of the pamphleteer''s
    settings from the Book of Isaiah.

    Hooting Yard readers are a wise bunch, and I would not be surprised to be deluged
    with letters accusing me of making up the whole satchel-rummaging incident in
    some foolhardy attempt to chivvy up Dobson''s reputation. I therefore arranged
    for a local snapper to take a snapshot of what I found, as proof.


    am now going to have to go and lie down in a darkened, cork-panelled room while
    I mull over what this extraordinary artefact tells us about (a) Dobson, and (b)
    Tiny Enid.

    Thanks, by the way, to boynton.'
