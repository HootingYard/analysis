  text: "The other day I had some harsh words to say about the out of print pamphleteer\
    \ Dobson's song-writing skills. \u201CNo one with any sense has ever listened\
    \ to a Dobson song more than once\u201D, I wrote. Well, it seems I was mistaken.\
    \ I was rummaging in a satchel that I found abandoned on a canal towpath, and\
    \ I came upon indisputable evidence that at least one sensible person admired\
    \ a Dobson song so much that they recorded a cover version of it. The song in\
    \ question is one of the pamphleteer's settings from the Book of Isaiah.\nHooting\
    \ Yard readers are a wise bunch, and I would not be surprised to be deluged with\
    \ letters accusing me of making up the whole satchel-rummaging incident in some\
    \ foolhardy attempt to chivvy up Dobson's reputation. I therefore arranged for\
    \ a local snapper to take a snapshot of what I found, as proof. \n\nam now going\
    \ to have to go and lie down in a darkened, cork-panelled room while I mull over\
    \ what this extraordinary artefact tells us about (a) Dobson, and (b) Tiny Enid.\n\
    Thanks, by the way, to boynton."
