  text: "The other day I had some harsh words to say about the out of print pamphleteer\
    \ Dobson's song-writing skills. \"No one with any sense has ever listened to a\
    \ Dobson song more than once\", I wrote. Well, it seems I was mistaken. I was\
    \ rummaging in a satchel that I found abandoned on a canal towpath, and I came\
    \ upon indisputable evidence that at least one sensible person admired a Dobson\
    \ song so much that they recorded a cover version of it. The song in question\
    \ is one of the pamphleteer's settings from the Book of Isaiah.\nHooting Yard\
    \ readers are a wise bunch, and I would not be surprised to be deluged with letters\
    \ accusing me of making up the whole satchel-rummaging incident in some foolhardy\
    \ attempt to chivvy up Dobson's reputation. I therefore arranged for a local snapper\
    \ to take a snapshot of what I found, as proof. \n\nam now going to have to go\
    \ and lie down in a darkened, cork-panelled room while I mull over what this extraordinary\
    \ artefact tells us about (a) Dobson, and (b) Tiny Enid.\nThanks, by the way,\
    \ to boynton."
