  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I couldn't help noticing that in the piece\
    \ about fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's training regime, Dobson repeatedly refers\
    \ to \u201Csoap flakes in a box\u201D, without telling us which brand of soap\
    \ flakes the champion sprinter used. This is a pity. I cannot be alone among your\
    \ readers in having world-shuddering sporting ambitions, and I try to replicate\
    \ the fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol approach in every particular. I have gone\
    \ so far as to make my coach wear an East European raincoat and to chain smoke\
    \ at the side of the track while I scamper round it. I grant you that she looks\
    \ absolutely nothing like Old Halob, and is about half a century younger than\
    \ he was at his peak, but you'd be surprised how effective the illusion can be,\
    \ especially when she starts hawking up gobbets of phlegm just like the cantankerous\
    \ old rogue.\nIncidentally, I am on the lookout for a black Homburg she can wear\
    \ to make her look even more like Old Halob, so if any of your readers know where\
    \ I might get a genuine 1940s Homburg, perhaps they could contact me through your\
    \ Comments section. I'm afraid I do not know my coach's hat size, and nor, I suspect,\
    \ does she. Gone are the days when people were as familiar with their hat size\
    \ as with their shoe size. It is all chips and PINs now, but that doesn't wash\
    \ with me. I still sprinkle cash about, whenever I go roaming, not that I have\
    \ much time to roam given my busy fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol-like training\
    \ schedule.\nWhich brings me back to the matter at hand, namely those soap flakes\
    \ in a box. Was Dobson leery of advertising a brand name, or what? I am aware\
    \ that he was, or at least tried to be, a pamphleteer of considerable moral fibre,\
    \ but that seems to be taking things a bit far. I am sure his legion of fans would\
    \ have thought no less of him if he had bandied brands like Omo or Daz in his\
    \ pamphlets. When you consider that towering intellectual figures of our own day\
    \ such as Isaiah Berlin regularly turn up on television to peddle Twinings tea\u2026\
    \ no, that's wrong, it's Stephen Fry, isn't it? So easy to confuse two such rigorous\
    \ \xFCberbrains. Anyway, it is time for me to pound around that running track\
    \ like a mad pursued thing, so I'll stop there. But if you can winkle out of the\
    \ archives any information about those soap flakes in a box, I would be extremely\
    \ grateful. Passionately yours, Tim Thurn, \u201Cgoing for gold!\u201D"
