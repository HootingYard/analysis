  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I couldn''t help noticing that in the piece
    about fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol''s training regime, Dobson repeatedly refers
    to "soap flakes in a box", without telling us which brand of soap flakes the champion
    sprinter used. This is a pity. I cannot be alone among your readers in having
    world-shuddering sporting ambitions, and I try to replicate the fictional athlete
    Bobnit Tivol approach in every particular. I have gone so far as to make my coach
    wear an East European raincoat and to chain smoke at the side of the track while
    I scamper round it. I grant you that she looks absolutely nothing like Old Halob,
    and is about half a century younger than he was at his peak, but you''d be surprised
    how effective the illusion can be, especially when she starts hawking up gobbets
    of phlegm just like the cantankerous old rogue.

    Incidentally, I am on the lookout for a black Homburg she can wear to make her
    look even more like Old Halob, so if any of your readers know where I might get
    a genuine 1940s Homburg, perhaps they could contact me through your Comments section.
    I''m afraid I do not know my coach''s hat size, and nor, I suspect, does she.
    Gone are the days when people were as familiar with their hat size as with their
    shoe size. It is all chips and PINs now, but that doesn''t wash with me. I still
    sprinkle cash about, whenever I go roaming, not that I have much time to roam
    given my busy fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol-like training schedule.

    Which brings me back to the matter at hand, namely those soap flakes in a box.
    Was Dobson leery of advertising a brand name, or what? I am aware that he was,
    or at least tried to be, a pamphleteer of considerable moral fibre, but that seems
    to be taking things a bit far. I am sure his legion of fans would have thought
    no less of him if he had bandied brands like Omo or Daz in his pamphlets. When
    you consider that towering intellectual figures of our own day such as Isaiah
    Berlin regularly turn up on television to peddle Twinings tea... no, that''s wrong,
    it''s Stephen Fry, isn''t it? So easy to confuse two such rigorous uberbrains.
    Anyway, it is time for me to pound around that running track like a mad pursued
    thing, so I''ll stop there. But if you can winkle out of the archives any information
    about those soap flakes in a box, I would be extremely grateful. Passionately
    yours, Tim Thurn, "going for gold!"'
