  text: "Please note that access to HIMMELFARB is restricted. Within five seconds\
    \ a new window will open, in which you should type your access code.\nIf you do\
    \ not have an access code yet, where have you been? To get an access code, albeit\
    \ a late one, you must subscribe to the HIMMELFARB Groupuscule Register. Your\
    \ unique access code can be retrieved from the database when you receive a confirmation\
    \ email, unless you are a seedy person, in which case it will be sent by carrier\
    \ cyberpigeon.\nYour access code is different from your password, but must be\
    \ compatible. For help with access codes and passwords, and to check compatibility,\
    \ you need to download a .pdf file from the HIMMELFARB Document Storage Mirror\
    \ Site closest to you. A list of locations is available to unregistered users\
    \ via wingrotesque.\nIf the new window has not opened within five seconds, there\
    \ is either something wrong with your computer, or you have a deeply flawed personality.\
    \ You may even be a seedy person. It is not unknown for the seedy and dissolute\
    \ to try to gain access to HIMMELFARB, more's the pity. But the system is robust\
    \ and we have a proven track record of filtering out such deplorable specimens.\
    \ Less sympathy, more deploring, that's our motto. Much more deploring. Deploring\
    \ and condemning.\nTo view the readme file on our vindictive methods of condemnation,\
    \ you will need to install a plug-in. You can do this even if you are a deplorable\
    \ and seedy person, because the software has been developed in full cooperation\
    \ with the Holy See in Rome. Upon installation, your computer will be imbued with\
    \ Virtual Sanctity (version 4.03) with automatic upgrades. If you are a confessor\
    \ of a different faith, there is no hope for you, no matter how often you sprawl\
    \ on your prayer mat or slaughter a sacrificial goat. You are advised to repent\
    \ your sins before it is too late, and your raiment is torn in shreds and your\
    \ mouth is filled with ashes.\nWe are always seeking to improve the quality of\
    \ users\u2019 HIMMELFARB experience, and we welcome feedback, so long as it is\
    \ grammatically correct. Those of you who write in as if you were a teenage nitwit\
    \ sending a text message on a mobile phone will be subject to condemnation so\
    \ robust that you will wish you had never been born."
