  text: 'Please note that access to HIMMELFARB is restricted. Within five seconds
    a new window will open, in which you should type your access code.

    If you do not have an access code yet, where have you been? To get an access code,
    albeit a late one, you must subscribe to the HIMMELFARB Groupuscule Register.
    Your unique access code can be retrieved from the database when you receive a
    confirmation email, unless you are a seedy person, in which case it will be sent
    by carrier cyberpigeon.

    Your access code is different from your password, but must be compatible. For
    help with access codes and passwords, and to check compatibility, you need to
    download a .pdf file from the HIMMELFARB Document Storage Mirror Site closest
    to you. A list of locations is available to unregistered users via wingrotesque.

    If the new window has not opened within five seconds, there is either something
    wrong with your computer, or you have a deeply flawed personality. You may even
    be a seedy person. It is not unknown for the seedy and dissolute to try to gain
    access to HIMMELFARB, more''s the pity. But the system is robust and we have a
    proven track record of filtering out such deplorable specimens. Less sympathy,
    more deploring, that''s our motto. Much more deploring. Deploring and condemning.

    To view the readme file on our vindictive methods of condemnation, you will need
    to install a plug-in. You can do this even if you are a deplorable and seedy person,
    because the software has been developed in full cooperation with the Holy See
    in Rome. Upon installation, your computer will be imbued with Virtual Sanctity
    (version 4.03) with automatic upgrades. If you are a confessor of a different
    faith, there is no hope for you, no matter how often you sprawl on your prayer
    mat or slaughter a sacrificial goat. You are advised to repent your sins before
    it is too late, and your raiment is torn in shreds and your mouth is filled with
    ashes.

    We are always seeking to improve the quality of users'' HIMMELFARB experience,
    and we welcome feedback, so long as it is grammatically correct. Those of you
    who write in as if you were a teenage nitwit sending a text message on a mobile
    phone will be subject to condemnation so robust that you will wish you had never
    been born.'
