  text: 'Whenever bumpkins gather of an evening in the shack at the end of the lane,
    sooner or later their talk will turn to the Huffington Post. It is not uncommon
    for the peasantry to fixate upon minutiae, of course. We think of Old Farmer Frack,
    obsessed with his bellowing cows, or the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge, or any
    number of pig-related outbreaks of countryside mass hysteria, often focussed upon
    something as insignificant as the shape of a newborn pig''s snout or trotters.
    Yet the bumpkins'' preoccupation with the Huffington Post was curious, for to
    the untrained eye it looked like any other fencepost or stake or piece of paling.
    I dare say you or I would pass by that post without giving it a glance, and the
    prattle of the bumpkins of an evening in the shack at the end of the lane would
    sound to us nonsensical. But rustic wisdom is hard won, and only a fool would
    dismiss the bumpkins'' shack chatter as drivel.

    On a balmy evening one such fool blundered into the shack at the end of the lane
    and, hearing the bumpkins bandying the profundities of Huffington Post lore, took
    it for the idiocy of defectives. With his briefcase and bowler hat it was clear
    the fool dwelt in a city. Clear, too, that he could not tell the Huffington Post
    from any other posts and stakes and pales thumped into the muck for fencing the
    fields. His manner and his smirks were disparaging of the bumpkins, and when he
    left the shack and was making his way to the railway station, they waylaid him
    and carried him off to the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge. And as they had done
    with others who came to mock, they coated him in farmyard slurry and tar and poked
    him with pitchforks, and when they were done with him they buried him at midnight
    under the Huffington Post.'
