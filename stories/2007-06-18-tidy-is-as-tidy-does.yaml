  text: 'Dobson was an excessively tidy man. He firmly believed the old saw which
    insists there is a place for everything, and everything in its place. Thus, he
    kept sweets in jars, and jars on shelves in cupboards. This despite his loathing
    of confectionery. When asked why he stored so many sweets, including humbugs,
    toffees and jammy teardrops, in labelled jars on labelled shelves in labelled
    cupboards, Dobson blustered and tried to change the subject.

    "Oh look," he might say, pointing out of the window, "A mother shrike with her
    shrikelets," or "What would you say were the chief causes of the Boxer Rising?"
    In the latter example, he would not bother pointing out the window, but might
    furrow his brow, as if he had been pondering the topic for some time.

    This sneaky yet transparent technique worked surprisingly often. Few people, other
    than Marigold Chew, felt confident enough in the pamphleteer''s presence to challenge
    Dobson. The explanation for this lies not in any personal magnetism or force of
    personality. In fact, for the life of me I cannot think why he got away with his
    preposterous behaviour.

    Cutlery alignment in cutlery drawers was another type of tidiness which exercised
    the great man. At particularly fraught times he was known to align and realign
    the cutlery in the cutlery drawer ten times an hour. Sometimes he would be halfway
    along the path to the pond to commune with swans, then turn on his heel and stamp
    back into the house to attend to the knives and forks. Nowadays, of course, some
    pop psychologist would make a television documentary asserting that Dobson suffered
    from obsessive compulsive disorder, but I think we can safely reject such a notion.
    It is not as if he was washing his hands every five minutes, or going doolally
    at the sight of glitter. Indeed, he ought probably to have washed his hands more
    often. They were invariably ink-splattered and grubby in other ways, particularly
    if he had been down by the pond with the swans. No, I think we can rely on Dobson''s
    own account of the cutlery issue, which he addressed in a pamphlet entitled Keeping
    Cutlery Aligned Tidily In The Cutlery Drawer As An Absolute Imperative If One
    Aspires To Be Fully Human (out of print). For reasons I need not go into here,
    hardly anybody has ever bothered to read this middle-period work. The prose is
    clogged and clunky, the views expressed idiotic, and when typesetting it Marigold
    Chew chose so tiny a font that the average reader needs an extremely powerful
    magnifying glass to decipher the text.

    Oh, forgive me, I just went into the reasons why hardly anybody has ever bothered
    to read this middle-period work. Dobson would ascribe that little slip to the
    fact that the cutlery in my cutlery drawers is chaotic and askew. Am I not, then,
    fully human? And if not, what am I? Partly ape? Perhaps I would be able to answer
    those questions if I myself had read the pamphlet, but I confess I have not done
    so. My eyesight is not up to it. I could, perhaps, employ some bright-eyed literate
    youngster to read it to me, a perky little brainbox uncowed by Latin tags and
    arcane references and paragraphs that go on and on and on for twelve pages or
    more, by clogged and clunky prose and idiotic views, but where would I find such
    a creature? I suppose I could take a stroll in the rain down to the nearest community
    hub, but that would be the act of a desperate man. Better by far, surely, either
    to accept my semi-human status, to give vent to my inner ape and to stuff my face
    with bananas and nuts, or conversely to go and align the cutlery in the cutlery
    drawer with Dobsonian precision and thus destroy the ape that lurks within me.
    It is a simple choice, and one I shall not shirk from making.'
