  text: "I have been giving further thought to that logo\u2014or brand\u2014for the\
    \ 2012 Olympics. Clearly the \xA3400,000 design is a hideous mistake and will\
    \ have to be ditched and replaced at some point within the next five years. My\
    \ own view is that the organising committee ought to take a cheerful, jolly image\
    \ from an already proven successful brand, slap the Olympic rings on it somewhere,\
    \ and have done with it. What could be better than a picture of a lion being attacked\
    \ by a swarm of Africanised killer bees?\n"
