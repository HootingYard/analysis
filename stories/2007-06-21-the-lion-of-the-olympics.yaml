  text: 'I have been giving further thought to that logo--or brand--for the 2012 Olympics.
    Clearly the PS400,000 design is a hideous mistake and will have to be ditched
    and replaced at some point within the next five years. My own view is that the
    organising committee ought to take a cheerful, jolly image from an already proven
    successful brand, slap the Olympic rings on it somewhere, and have done with it.
    What could be better than a picture of a lion being attacked by a swarm of Africanised
    killer bees?
