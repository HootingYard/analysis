  text: John Fernely, a successful Victorian dauber who lived in Melton Mowbray, charged
    ten pounds to paint a portrait of a horse, but only seven pounds for a portrait
    of a cow. Were these costs fair? Would you have been prepared to pay more for
    a cow picture than a horse painting? If not, why not? What do you think was going
    on in Fernely's head when he set these prices? Comments please.
