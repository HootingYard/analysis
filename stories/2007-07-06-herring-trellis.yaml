  text: "Mr Key is currently a-moanin\u2019 and a-groanin\u2019 and generally feeling\
    \ sorry for himself, laid low by a seemingly endless series of colds. Perhaps\
    \ it is the same one, punctuated by brief periods of what passes for being hale\
    \ and hearty in these parts. Anyway, to the accompaniment of much snuffling, here\
    \ are a couple of items from the papers that deserve preservation in the Hooting\
    \ Yard Crate O\u2019 Press Cuttings.\nFirst, this report was issued by the Associated\
    \ Press in Amsterdam: A Dutch newspaper said yesterday it had received anonymous\
    \ threats to kill several of its journalists if the paper published its annual\
    \ herring review. There is more, but I think that first sentence is sufficiently\
    \ arresting. Perhaps the journalists would be better engaged doing something uncontroversial,\
    \ such as publishing cartoons of \u201Cthe prophet\u201D Mohammed\u2026 so long\
    \ as they don't include one of him munching on a herring, of course.\nNext, the\
    \ new Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, James Purnell, has this\
    \ to say, in today's Guardian: \u201CWhat's the trellis on which the plant can\
    \ grow? We create the trellis\u2026 but we need to make sure the trellis is not\
    \ getting in the way of people being excellent.\u201D Trellis metaphors are always\
    \ to be applauded, in all contexts, at all times, and this one is especially welcome,\
    \ for I feared the worst. Youthful Mr Purnell, in his past life at the BBC, was\
    \ a bright-eyed acolyte of the preposterous John Birt, a man who sees an arrow\
    \ and calls it a \u201Cdirectional pointing device\u201D.\nI am now going to go\
    \ and be excellent, unless my trellis is in the way."
