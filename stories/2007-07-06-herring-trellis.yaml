  text: 'Mr Key is currently a-moanin'' and a-groanin'' and generally feeling sorry
    for himself, laid low by a seemingly endless series of colds. Perhaps it is the
    same one, punctuated by brief periods of what passes for being hale and hearty
    in these parts. Anyway, to the accompaniment of much snuffling, here are a couple
    of items from the papers that deserve preservation in the Hooting Yard Crate O''
    Press Cuttings.

    First, this report was issued by the Associated Press in Amsterdam: A Dutch newspaper
    said yesterday it had received anonymous threats to kill several of its journalists
    if the paper published its annual herring review. There is more, but I think that
    first sentence is sufficiently arresting. Perhaps the journalists would be better
    engaged doing something uncontroversial, such as publishing cartoons of "the prophet"
    Mohammed... so long as they don''t include one of him munching on a herring, of
    course.

    Next, the new Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, James Purnell,
    has this to say, in today''s Guardian: "What''s the trellis on which the plant
    can grow? We create the trellis... but we need to make sure the trellis is not
    getting in the way of people being excellent." Trellis metaphors are always to
    be applauded, in all contexts, at all times, and this one is especially welcome,
    for I feared the worst. Youthful Mr Purnell, in his past life at the BBC, was
    a bright-eyed acolyte of the preposterous John Birt, a man who sees an arrow and
    calls it a "directional pointing device".

    I am now going to go and be excellent, unless my trellis is in the way.'
