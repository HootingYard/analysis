  text: "From Necropolis\_: London And Its Dead by Catharine Arnold:\n\u201COne of\
    \ the most spectacular monuments [in Kensal Green cemetery] is the \xC2\xA33,000\
    \ tomb of Andrew Ducrow, an Egyptian extravaganza that The Builder dismissed as\
    \ \u2018ponderous coxcombry\u2019. Ducrow (1793\u20131842) was a showman, \u2018\
    the Colossus of Equestrians\u2019, who wrestled with lions, re-enacted scenes\
    \ from Napoleonic battles, and could lift four or five children using nothing\
    \ more than his teeth.\u201D\nWe are not told if the children in question were\
    \ pious Victorian orphans, but I expect they were."
