  text: 'Now, where was I? Away in a haze, probably. But I really must tell you about
    the time Dobson wangled himself a job on Modern Snipe magazine. It is a wonder
    that a pamphleteer with so shaky a grasp of ornithology should seek employ on
    such a title, but Dobson had his reasons. Well, reason. In the course of a conversation
    with a regular down at the Cow & Pins, Dobson learned that the name of the editor
    of Modern Snipe was an anagram of Marigold Chew, and he chose to see in this some
    sort of mystical significance. Ten minutes later, he was hammering in a decidedly
    non-mystical manner on the office door of Grimlaw Chode.

    The offices of Modern Snipe were at that time a suite of rooms on the top floor
    of a massive and efficient laundry building. Steam billowed from open windows
    and pipes and ducts, and an overpowering odour of boiling shirts and soap powder
    pervaded the neighbourhood. Never the most observant of men, Dobson did not look
    up as he approached to see if any birds perched on the roof, but had he done so
    he would have seen but a solitary crow, and not a snipe in sight.


    We do not know how Dobson convinced Grimlaw Chode to take him on at once as a
    special rapporteur, but we do know that Chode, like the United Nations, was given
    to bandying about the word rapporteur rather than reporter. There was no element
    of pretension in this. Chode came from a family of international diplomats, and
    had modelled the editorial structure of Modern Snipe on that of a mixture of huge
    transnational organisations, of which the UN was only one. OPEC and CAFCON and
    SMERSH were in there, too. He gave Dobson a blue helmet to wear, and told him
    to go away and write something exciting about snipe.

    It is tempting here to veer off into a digression about Dobson and hats, a topic
    of endless fascination to some of us. But I fear things would get out of hand,
    particularly if I began to babble on about Dobson''s Homburg, itself a single
    hat that evokes a world of allusions and references, from James Mason to Procol
    Harum. Better that we address such matters at another time, and content ourselves
    now with the image of the pamphleteer trudging home along the towpath of the canal,
    a gleaming blue helmet atop his cranium, and the brain inside that cranium throbbing
    with an inchoate tangle of cerebral gibberish, at the dim centre of which lurked
    the signal fact that Dobson knew nothing whatsoever about snipe.

    Marigold Chew was in the back garden, training bees at the trellis, when the pamphleteer
    arrived home. He tossed his blue helmet onto a hat-peg with surprising aplomb,
    and sat down immediately at his escritoire. Pencil sharpened and with a fresh
    notebook open before him, he wrote:

    How fine a bird the snipe is! But first, consider this: he who wishes for the
    cloths of heaven may find his hopes dashed and his garb but rags and tatters.
    Yet there be not woe in this, for is it not the stamp of such a man that he looks
    out upon a darkling plain and pitches forth his wishes into a well where one day
    pennies will be spilled?

    At this point Marigold Chew came in from the garden. She had one of her trained
    bees on her shoulder, like a pirate''s miniature parrot. "What on earth is that
    blue helmet hooked on to the hat-peg?" she asked. Dobson explained.

    Marigold Chew was aghast. "I have nothing but admiration for your talents as a
    penny-catch-all pamphleteer," she announced, as her trained bee swapped shoulders,
    "But the job of special rapporteur on Modern Snipe will prove your undoing!" And
    she swept dramatically out of the door, and headed off in the rain to Huberman''s
    department store, to make enquiries about bee baskets. Dobson returned to his
    notebook.

    As your special rapporteur, he scribbled, it is my job to bring to readers new
    and unexpected perspectives on the travails of the modern snipe. That much I shall
    do, without fear. I once had custody of a clairvoyant pig, and in a very short
    time it taught me many things. One lesson I recall was sweet indeed. At that time
    I was fond of wearing my Homburg hat. It was the hat I wore when studying the
    Hittites, and now I wore the hat to study the pig. One day, walking across a field
    with the pig in tow, I stopped to mop my brow, and removed my hat and placed it
    on a stone. At once, out of the sky swooped a big-beaked bird and perched upon
    my Homburg. Was it a snipe? It may have been. I looked at the bird, and then I
    turned to look at the pig, and I realised with a start that the pig saw neither
    me nor the bird, for being a clairvoyant pig it could see only the future, centuries
    hence, when where we stood was a darkling plain, and the spot where I laid my
    hat was a deep dark well, at the bottom of which was a mountain of pennies chucked
    in hope by generation upon generation of the disappointed. And I further realised
    that all that hope was embodied in the form of the bird perched on my Homburg.
    And I affirm that, yes, it was a snipe.

    The last sentence was a complete lie, of course, as Dobson could affirm no such
    thing. But he was extremely pleased with his initial foray in to the heady world
    of contemporary ornithological journalism. Slapping the blue helmet back on his
    head, he stuffed the notebook into his satchel and crashed out of the door. On
    the canal towpath, he met Marigold Chew. She was carrying half a dozen bee baskets
    and the evening newspaper.

    "Look at this," she said.

    Dobson read the headline on the just-published Evening Dachshund. He was not a
    man who often goggled, but he goggled now. SNIPE MAN SLAIN, it read. Within the
    last hour, Grimlaw Chode had been shot dead. By a sniper. And so ended Dobson''s
    career as a birdy rapporteur.'
