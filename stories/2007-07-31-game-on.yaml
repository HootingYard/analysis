  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I am a huge fan of Hooting Yard and an even
    huger fan of computer and console games. Can you tell me if there are plans afoot
    for a Hooting Yard-based game I will be able to play on my Gameboy, Wii, or what
    have you?

    Oh dear, is all I can say. I can only assume that Tim is a teenage boy, for only
    teenage boys ought to be playing computer games. (Teenage girls are busy editing
    the features pages of The Guardian.) That so many adults spend their time "gaming"
    is clear evidence of the culture of infantilisation which we see all around us.
    I recommend compulsory reading of The Anatomy Of Melancholy and enforced contemplation
    of the paintings of Oskar Kokoschka, as a start.

    Meanwhile, somewhat shamefacedly, I do have to confess that I have granted a licence
    to a Japanese software development company to create a thoroughly enticing game
    based on certain Hooting Yard characters. The working title for the game is Fictional
    Athlete Bobnit Tivol Magnificent Sprinting And Polevaulting Golden Uberchallenge.
    As far as I can understand such things, the titular challenge for players is to
    lead a little pixellated fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol avatar through a series
    of increasingly difficult virtual sporting tournaments. As one progresses through
    each level, cantankerous trainer Old Halob is on hand (coughing and spluttering
    on a variety of high tar cigarettes) to offer tips and advice. The further along
    the player goes, of course, the less help is available from Old Halob, and at
    the highest levels he occupies a corner of the screen languishing in what looks
    like a sanatorium.

    The putative teenage purchaser of the game can choose from various options. You
    can play as fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, or compete against him. In this mode,
    Old Halob acts as a fiendish adversary, given to such tactics as poisoning your
    pre-sprint cornflakes, blinding you with pepper spray, or breaking your legs.
    You can also select different locations for the stadia in which the contests take
    place, including ancient Latvia, the Essex seaside town of Jaywick, and the mystic
    and frankly terrifying Land of Gaar, alive with nightmarish monsters and things
    that creep upon the face of the earth. The only game setting which is fixed and
    unchangeable is the colour scheme, which as you would expect is sepia.

    The developers hope to gain some celebrity endorsements before the game is released,
    and I understand that they have already made tentative approaches to such luminaries
    as Chris de Burhg [sic] and David Blunkett MP. According to marketing strategists,
    a touchy-feely version for the blind is predicted to outsell the sighted edition.'
