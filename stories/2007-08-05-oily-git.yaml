  text: On more than one occasion I have found myself locked in a chamber with an
    oily git. It is not an experience for the faint-hearted, and I have certificates.
    And let me tell you something, I made damned sure I kept my certificates far away
    from the oily git, at the times I was locked up with him, because he would have
    smudged them, just as he smudges anything with which he comes into contact, he
    can't help himself, it's what he does, it's the essence of him in many ways, he's
    a smudger, a smudger good and proper, and it is both sickening and heartbreaking
    to watch as he smudges things, you feel helpless to stop him, and you would never
    be able to stop him smudging in any case, no matter how many certificates you
    had accrued and clutched to your bosom with pride. At the last count I had forty-six
    certificates, but rather than clutching them to my bosom I keep them in a locker,
    and the locker is padlocked, with double padlocks, and the keys to the padlocks
    are locked up in a separate locker, to which the key is hidden. As for me, yet
    again I'm locked up with the oily git and he has already smudged the walls and
    the floor and even the ceiling, with his antics, and it is only through my quick
    wits that I remain so far unsmudged. But sooner or later the oily git will insist
    on clasping me in a bear hug, in a fit of misplaced camaraderie, and then I will
    end up smudged again, until they let me out of the chamber, one day. I have the
    benefit of knowing that my certificates are safe, though they will probably curl
    up at the edges, for the locker is in a place of much humidity. I have hunted
    for a spare locker in a place of less humidity, or even of no significant humidity
    at all, and I was following up a lead on such a locker when I once again found
    myself being locked up with the oily git. I suppose that particular locker will
    be taken by the time they let me out, one day, but I am nothing if not indefatigable,
    I will wash off the smudges and check my certificates--in that order--and then
    I will ascertain whether the locker is still spare, and if, as is likely, it has
    been taken, I will redouble my efforts and hunt for another, similar, locker,
    in a place of little or no humidity, to which I will transfer my certificates
    once I have been entrusted with the keys. And of course I will add a pair of padlocks,
    for additional security. It is the thought of being able to do this one day that
    makes my time in the chamber with the oily git bearable, though I say nothing
    about it to him. I try to speak to him as little as possible, other than to fend
    off his attempted bear hugs for as long as is seemly, even though I know that
    sooner or later I will succumb, and be hugged and smudged. It was ever thus. The
    oily git has no certificates at all, as far as I know, but I have seen a couple
    of smudged coupons sticking out of his coat pocket. I have not had a chance to
    examine them closely, but I suspect they are coupons of little value, the sort
    that are handed to gits oily or non-oily, by those who distribute such things.
    It is quite possible that the oily git is very pleased with his coupons, and treasures
    them. I would rather boil my own head than be seen with a couple of coupons sticking
    out of my coat pocket, but there you go, he is an oily git and I am not. For the
    time being we are locked together in this chamber, yet again, and though I may
    become smudged, you can rest assured that neither his oiliness nor his gitdom
    will rub off on me. Remember, I have forty-six certificates, and they don't poke
    out of my pocket like tawdry jamboree prizes, they are kept safe in a padlocked
    locker, and soon I trust they will be safer in a better locker, one in a place
    less humid than my current locker. I bet the oily git hasn't got a locker. And
    if he did its door would be smudged, and neighbouring lockers would be shunned
    by all righteous and upstanding persons. The oily git does not even wear a hat,
    for goodness' sake. It is true that I remove my hat when locked in the chamber
    with him, and of course it rapidly becomes smudged, but I pride myself on my manners.
    That is another thing I have to do when they let me out, which is to get my hat
    washed. I may do that before checking up on my certificates, depending on my state
    of mind and how badly smudged the hat is. You can appreciate that there is much
    I must take into account, even if for the time being I am in a kind of limbo.
    The Pope recently announced that Limbo did not exist, but he was referring to
    that ethereal realm where unbaptised infants who pass away were long thought to
    languish until such time as the mercy of God allowed them into Heaven, but that
    is not the limbo to which I refer, and after all I am both an adult--and a righteous
    and upstanding one, with forty-six certificates, and as far as I am aware I was
    baptised soon after my birth, all those decades ago. It is hard to tell whether
    the oily git is older than me, or younger, but I think we can be as sure as eggs
    is eggs that he was never baptised. Had he been he would not now be an oily git,
    I'll wager. Another thing I can quite clearly see, even from the confines of this
    chamber, is that I shall inherit my Kingdom, whereas the oily git will but bite
    on bitter fruit. And never shall I allow him to smudge my Kingdom, for it will
    be pristine. There will be antelopes in my Kingdom, elegant and high in the withers,
    and I shall look upon them from my turret. And where will the oily git be then?
    Why, he will remain locked up in this chamber, smudging the floor and the walls
    and the ceiling, biting upon smudged and bitter fruits and seeds.
