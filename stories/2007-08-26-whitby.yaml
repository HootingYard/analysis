  text: 'Dr Johnson (a sort of proto-Dobson) famously stated that when a man is tired
    of London he is tired of life. On the other hand, when a man is tired of Hooting
    Yard (not that such a mental aberration is remotely credible, of course) there
    are other Yards he can investigate. I have just returned from a stay in Whitby,
    where, among other Yards, I was happy to spot both Dark Entry Yard and Arguments
    Yard. Whitby is all Yards and Steps. Of the latter, the one hundred and ninety-nine
    steps leading up to the ruined Abbey are the most noteworthy, but there are plenty
    of less celebrated Steps to clamber up and down, many of then perilous and steep.

    Dark Entry Steps can be found opposite the railway station, which has a somewhat
    battered and semi-derelict air, and has but a single platform and a single track,
    on which a train plies between Whitby and Middlesbrough, back and forth all day,
    but not at night.

    My little trip to Whitby goes some way to explaining the eerie silence that has
    crept over Hooting Yard of late. But I am back again now, revivified, and will
    be posting a few more dispatches regarding "Seaside Resort Of The Year, 2006"
    in addition to the usual morally uplifting and instructive prose. So you can look
    forward to reading about the Scoresby Pump, Goth tat, a CCTV warning in Celtic
    uncials (in yet another Yard), the Whitby Literary & Philosophical Society, pipistrelles,
    and much else. Oh, and by the way, the offer may not last long, but one shop in
    that delightful town is currently giving away a free bra with every pair of flipflops
    sold. On second thoughts, I think I am misremembering that, and it''s the other
    way round.'
