  text: 'I chanced upon a fascinating pamphlet the other day, and I think I ought
    to tell you all about it. How To Gain Ingress To Lobbies That Have Been Bolted
    Shut is a tatty forty-four page screed, unclogged by illustrative matter, and--maddeningly--gives
    no indication of its author or date of publication. I read it at one sitting while
    picnicking on a pier.

    The first thing that struck me was that it is unusual to find a bolted lobby.
    Given the nature of lobbies, as antechambers to all sorts of premises, it is surely
    common to find them open and welcoming, drawing the visitor in. If you are shy
    of, or hostile to callers, you will not want a lobby, and if the building you
    take over has one in place, you are likely, as the new owner, to destroy the lobby
    or transform it into something else. I remember once going to a building that
    had been a hotel but was now the domain of a recluse, and what had in the past
    been the lobby was now a gated, unlit, forbidding hellhole stuffed with poisonous
    vegetation in pots. When I rapped upon the gate, an occult mechanism released
    a jet of gas that hit me full in the face, whereupon I fled, a napkin clutched
    to my nose and mouth, eyes streaming with tears. Perhaps it was the memory of
    that dismal morning that made me so intrigued by a pamphlet promising instructive
    tips on gaining access to lobbies bolted shut.

    As I said, I read the pamphlet upon a pier, and I was surrounded by bolted booths.
    Many of these were shabby booths, so to find them bolted shut did not come as
    a surprise. I dare say there is not a seaside resort in the land that does not
    have its share of shabby bolted booths, either upon the pier or along the promenade.
    One ought not confuse booths with chalets, although it is true that many chalets
    too are shabby, and some may be bolted shut, but on average I would aver that
    bolted booths outnumber bolted chalets. For purposes of clarity, let us assume
    that there is no appreciable difference between a booth and a kiosk.

    While I was reading the pamphlet perched on a bench on the pier lined with bolted
    booths and kiosks, the sea beneath me was roiling and churning. This was a wild
    coastline.

    So you want to gain ingress to a lobby bolted shut? were the opening words of
    the pamphlet. I paused at this point, took a sausage on a stick and a pot of savoury
    paste out of my haversack, removed the lid from the pot and dipped the sausage
    in the paste, and chewed the sausage as I tried to think if there was any particular
    bolted lobby to which I wished to gain ingress. The lobby I just mentioned, the
    gated and unlit and forbidding hellhole, could no longer count as a lobby, all
    things considered. Munching another mouthful of paste-caked sausage, I looked
    around at the bolted booths as if in doing so I might summon to mind a bolted
    lobby I was keen to enter, for if I harboured no desire to gain ingress to a real
    lobby that was bolted shut it hardly seemed worth my while to read the pamphlet.
    I may as well toss it over the railings into the roiling sea.

    Such a tossage was about to happen, for I had racked my puny brain as hard as
    ever a man did, when all of a sudden I was stopped in mid-toss. From an unbolted
    booth nearby I heard a voice. It was a wheezy and spittle-pipped voice, and I
    recognised it at once. "What in the name of heaven," I remember thinking to myself,
    "is the poet Dennis Beerpint doing skulking in an unbolted booth on a pier in
    a semi-abandoned seaside resort?" I stuffed the pamphlet into my rucksack, took
    a glug from my flask, and peeked into the booth. I did not see Beerpint in the
    booth, but a man at a lathe, lathing and listening to the wireless, the source
    of the poet''s wheezing. To be fair, I think the faulty reception made him wheezier
    than he really was. I have been an enthusiast for the outpourings of the twee
    yet titanic versifier for more years than the lifespan of the average hamster,
    but until now it had escaped my notice that he hosted a regular weekly wireless
    programme entitled Dennis Beerpint On The Air. I leaned insouciantly against the
    door of the booth and listened. So enrapt was the seaside lathesmeister, lathing,
    that of me, he was oblivious.

    I apologise. This is what happens to me with Beerpint, as soon as I think about
    him I start to write like him. I ought to have written "the person at the lathe
    was oblivious of me" or, better, "did not even notice me".

    So, I listened, and it became apparent soon enough that the great but neglected
    poet was reading from his Eclogues, or perhaps from his Pipistrelles. This latter,
    apart from being a type of bat, was a verse form devised by Beerpint, not dissimilar
    to an Eclogue, hence my uncertainty. I could make neither head nor tail of what
    he was wittering on about, of course, but I allowed the words to wash over me
    as I dug into my knapsack for another sausage on a stick. Alas, this second sausage
    was contaminated, and after swallowing a chunk I was forced to totter over to
    the side of the pier and vomit into the churning ocean. I glugged some more water-from-a-spigot
    from my flask to rinse out my mouth, and by the time I returned to the booth,
    it had been bolted shut. I lolloped over to a bench and sat.

    Now it occurred to me that helpful tips on gaining ingress to a bolted lobby may
    well be equally useful for a reader keen to gain ingress to a bolted booth, so
    I took the pamphlet out of my haversack and continued to read past the first sentence.

    First of all, it said, you need to weigh your desire to gain ingress to the lobby
    bolted shut against the reasons why the lobby has been bolted shut. You may be
    motivated by impure and fiendish urges which you barely, if at all, comprehend,
    and it may be that the bolting of the lobby was done as a means of protecting
    virtue. Conversely, you may well be close to sainthood and the bolting shut of
    the lobby an act of utmost wickedness. The crux of the matter is that you are
    diligent in your examination, and this will involve both rectitude and rigour.

    I yawned and skipped the next few pages, until I hit upon a paragraph teeming
    with the names of exciting and dangerous explosives. Not for the anonymous author
    such workaday solutions as jemmying the lock of the bolt with a jemmy, or hacking
    the chains of the bolt with a razor-sharp titanium saw. No, the only decent way
    to gain ingress to a bolted lobby, it appeared, was to blast that bolt with an
    enormous explosive charge and enter the lobby in triumph, covered in dust and
    debris and shrouded in a pall of smoke.

    Now I was in a quandary, and I do not like quandaries. I much prefer things to
    be simple. For example, if I eat a contaminated sausage, I would much rather be
    immediately sick over the side of a pier than to feel slightly off colour and
    be plagued for hours or days or weeks by waves of queasiness. I like big flat
    planes of colour rather than stippled dappled tincts. That is why I hold Dennis
    Beerpint in such esteem. You may not know what he is blathering on about, but
    more often than not his poems rhyme: cat, mat, hoist, joist, bank holiday, Special
    K, giddy, biddy. This is why he is so often dismissed as a versifier of twee pap.
    Well, as far as I am concerned, as Patrick Henry (1736-1799) so nearly said, "Give
    me pap or give me death!" My quandary was that if I followed the helpful tips
    in the pamphlet, the violence of the explosion would destroy not just the bolt
    with which the booth was bolted but the booth itself. As a general rule, lobbies
    are much bigger than booths or kiosks, and they are also mere parts of larger,
    more resilient structures. It dawned on me why the anonymous pamphleteer was so
    precise in titling his work. I sighed, and tossed the pamphlet over the side of
    the pier into the sea, and without even glancing back at the bolted booth wherein
    a man at a lathe listened to Dennis Beerpint On The Air on a bakelite wireless,
    I went on my merry way, back to the sausage shop to remonstrate with the sausage
    seller, on a wet and windy Wednesday afternoon.'
