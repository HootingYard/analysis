  text: "Today I learned, O Waly, Waly, that Benjamin Britten (1913\u20131976) was\
    \ the child of a dentist. Britten celebrated his fiftieth birthday on the same\
    \ day that both Aldous Huxley and C S Lewis died, which\u2014as all students of\
    \ such matters are vibrantly aware\u2014was the date of the assassination of President\
    \ John F Kennedy. Incidentally, not long before his death, the spookily tall and\
    \ almost blind Huxley answered the doorbell of his California home to a young\
    \ vacuum cleaner salesman named Don Van Vliet, soon to be better known as Captain\
    \ Beefheart. It would be fitting if I could end this squib with the observation\
    \ that Van Vliet, too, was the child of a dentist, but his Pa was a van driver\
    \ for a bakery, toting pastry-related items hither and yon, and I have no idea\
    \ of his Ma's occupation, alas."
