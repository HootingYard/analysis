  text: Today I learned, O Waly, Waly, that Benjamin Britten (1913-1976) was the child
    of a dentist. Britten celebrated his fiftieth birthday on the same day that both
    Aldous Huxley and C S Lewis died, which--as all students of such matters are vibrantly
    aware--was the date of the assassination of President John F Kennedy. Incidentally,
    not long before his death, the spookily tall and almost blind Huxley answered
    the doorbell of his California home to a young vacuum cleaner salesman named Don
    Van Vliet, soon to be better known as Captain Beefheart. It would be fitting if
    I could end this squib with the observation that Van Vliet, too, was the child
    of a dentist, but his Pa was a van driver for a bakery, toting pastry-related
    items hither and yon, and I have no idea of his Ma's occupation, alas.
