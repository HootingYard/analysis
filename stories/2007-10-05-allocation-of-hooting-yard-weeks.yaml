  text: 'This is just a quick reminder that last week was Our Lady Of Pituitary Glands,
    this week is the Goon Fang Pinocchio Of Camshafts, and next week is the Complacent
    Herons Of Totteridge & Whetstone.

    Please ensure your beads and counters are correctly aligned, and that your cushions
    are appropriately embroidered. If you will be eating any figs next week, be sure
    to keep them in a covered bowl and tilt the bowl slightly on your shelf. You can
    do this by wedging a triple-folded cardboard bus ticket under one side of the
    bowl''s base. When all the figs have been eaten and the bowl is empty, smash it,
    but do not smash it in the fireplace. There should be a cordon sanitaire around
    the fireplace from the week of Packaging Gnawed By Stoats to the week of Notorious
    Civil Engineering Scandals. Shoelaces ought to be tied according to the Winckelmann
    formula. Diagrams for guidance can be downloaded from the website at:
