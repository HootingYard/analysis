  text: 'Joost Van Dongelbraacke''s peppery constitution is the subject of not one,
    not two, but three new publications, a book, a pamphlet, and a monthly magazine.
    One might think that the constitution of a suburban shaman is too thin a topic
    to support a regular periodical, particularly such a fat and glossy one, but that
    is to discount the monomania of its editor, Tilly Whelkstallholder. Tilly is a
    woman of considerable intellectual energy. Early in life, her ambition was to
    become, like Eva Crane, a pivotal figure in the world of beekeeping for half a
    century, but she had to abandon this plan when it became clear that, try as she
    might, she simply could not get her head around the difference between bees, wasps
    and hornets. She would stare for hours at photographs, or illustrations, or dead
    bees, wasps and hornets suspended in aspic or a similar jelly, but all that happened
    was that her brain became a fuddled and fuming thing, and she had to go to the
    canteen at Hubermann''s department store for a reviving cup of tea.

    It was over one such refreshment that she first encountered the name Joost Van
    Dongelbraacke. The suburban shaman had been invited to respond to a Q & A in that
    week''s issue of Dashed Beekeeping Ambitions magazine, and Tilly found some of
    his answers fascinating. For example, asked who he would invite to his ideal dinner
    party, Van Dongelbraacke listed Jack and Bobby Charlton, Jack and Bobby Kennedy,
    Jack Teagarden, Bobby Previte, and Eva Crane, among some two hundred guests. In
    response to the question "O Joost, why hast thou forsaken me?", he reportedly
    answered with a stream of heavily sub-edited invective. What really took Tilly''s
    fancy, though, was the revelation that Van Dongelbraacke had a peppery constitution.
    Downing what remained of her cup of tea, she hurried out of the canteen, popped
    in to a kiosk to buy a bus ticket and a carton of expensive Paraguayan cigarettes,
    and dawdled impatiently at the bus shelter until the number 5724938 arrived. Settling
    herself in the seat just behind the driver, she plotted the first edition of Joost
    Van Dongelbraacke''s Peppery Constitution Monthly Magazine as the bus juddered
    along the muddy lane out of town, past the swimming pool and the heron enclosure,
    down through the big frightening tunnel and out onto the sycamore- and lupin-lined
    highway, picking up speed as it screeched through villages named after French
    film directors, swerved off towards the Blister Lane Bypass, then thundered inexorably
    downhill parallel with the derelict funicular railway until it reached the bus
    depot on the outskirts of the tiny and gruesome fishing village where Tilly rented
    half a barn during the summer months. It was winter, so she had no key, and had
    to clamber in though a funnel at the back of the other half of the barn and then
    smash down the connecting door with an axe. A week later, the first issue of her
    magazine appeared on the shelves of Old Ma Purgative''s pie shop and newsagent''s.

    It sold out within minutes, for the grubby fisherfolk of the village had a seemingly
    unquenchable enthusiasm for the work of Simon Schama and, ever canny, Tilly had
    persuaded the historian to contribute a cover story. Schama had never even heard
    of Van Dongelbraacke, but Tilly had given him free rein to write whatever he liked,
    and then edited the piece by inserting the suburban shaman''s name, and references
    to his peppery constitution, at whim. If Simon Schama complained, she reasoned,
    the threat of her axe to his spectacles would silence him. As we have seen, Tilly
    was a dab hand with that axe of hers.

    Another reason for the sales blitz was that Tilly gave away one of Old Ma Purgative''s
    homemade celery and beetroot pies with each copy of the first issue. Now, the
    Old Ma was as tight-fisted a crone as you could imagine, and Tilly had to pay
    for every single pie out of her own pocket. Having spent the last florin of her
    offshore hedge fund to produce the magazine, and as ignorant of complex financial
    instruments as she was of the difference between bees and wasps and hornets, Tilly
    was forced to go to her bank manager to beg for a loan. Like the emptied hedge
    fund, her bank was based offshore for legal, or possibly criminal, reasons, and
    the scuppered trawler in the cabin of which the bank manager held court like a
    latterday Neptune was a day''s hard rowing out at sea. By dint of an oar mishap,
    Tilly''s little boat ran aground on Scroonhoonpooge Sands, invariably described
    as "treacherous" by those in the maritime know. She wasted a precious week living
    off rainwater and eels until rescued by a floating zoo. By chance, the zookeeper
    captain was both the uncle of the bank manager and a lifelong devotee of Joost
    Van Dongelbraacke, and he gave Tilly a handful of cash to buy sufficient pies
    from Old Ma Purgative. It is a minor tragedy that Tilly never spoke to the captain
    about her dashed beekeeping ambitions, for by a further eerie coincidence, this
    polymathic nautical zookeeper had, some years past, devised a completely idiot-proof
    method for telling apart bees and wasps and hornets, which even Tilly might have
    understood.

    All that was a few months ago, and even though there are no more free pies, and
    Simon Schama has refused ever to write for it again, Tilly''s magazine continues
    to befuddle those marketing experts who predicted ruin. It is now on sale not
    only in Old Ma Purgative''s pie shop and newsagent''s, but also in Hubermann''s,
    and copies can be consulted in the Library of Congress, although Tilly becomes
    tight-lipped when asked precisely which Library of which Congress, and some suspect
    she may be referrring to a cupboard belonging to the Pang Hill Butchers'' Shops
    Trade Association.

    I began by saying that Tilly''s magazine was one of three new publications devoted
    to Joost Van Dongelbraacke''s peppery constitution, the others being a book and
    a pamphlet. I realise now that I misread an item in the latest newsletter from
    the Pang Hill Butchers'' Shops Trade Association, and that neither the book nor
    the pamphlet exist. I don''t know about you, but I''m getting sick and tired of
    irresponsible butchers peddling falsehoods or ambiguities in their trade publications.
    And don''t get me started on grocers, fishmongers, and pastry shop proprietors.
    It''s time something was done. Start writing your placards!'
