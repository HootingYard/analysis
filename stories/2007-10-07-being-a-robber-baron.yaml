  text: 'If you want to pursue a career as a robber baron, the very first step you
    need to take is to establish your baronetcy. You need to ensure that it has at
    least a patina of legitimacy, for you do not want nay-sayers and busybodies calling
    it into question. Youngsters who seek my advice are often surprised that wearing
    a burnished golden helmet while sitting astride a mighty steed is not, in itself,
    sufficient claim to be a baron. Of course, it is essential to have such a helmet
    and such a horse, no self-respecting robber baron could expect to go about his
    baronial robberies without them, but I''m afraid the drudgery of paperwork has
    to take precedence.

    You can pluck the name of your baronetcy out of the air, much as you might invent
    the name of a monster in a bedtime story for tinies, but if possible it is best
    to take on the appellation of a genuine baronetcy, one that has fallen into desuetude
    where the last baron died hundreds of years ago without issue. Many barons fell
    in battle in far distant lands, so a good start would be to check up on the manifests
    of ruinous military expeditions. Obviously, whenever a baron fell on the open
    battlefield, he was almost certainly unhorsed, so that serves as a reminder to
    you to choose your steed well, when we come to the prickly topic of steed choosing.

    Once you have picked an extinct baronetcy to revive, you will need a coat of arms.
    Don''t fuddle your head too much with all those heraldry words like azure and
    gules and rampant and argent and couchant, just make sure you have something that
    pleases you and that will look good emblazoned on the shields carried proudly
    by your masked outriders. You might be able simply to appropriate the actual coat
    of arms of the dead baron you have supplanted, but to do so risks alerting the
    busybodies and you might be faced with hard questions you will be in no position
    to answer. In any case, nothing could be easier than designing a coat of arms,
    it really is child''s play. You can even hire an orphan from Pang Hill to do the
    job for you.

    With your baronetcy secure(ish) and a spindly orphan beavering away at your coat
    of arms, the time has come to obtain a mighty steed. I cannot emphasise enough
    just how important this is. Without a suitable horse, all else is as naught. At
    this point, up goes the cry "But where do I find a horse?" Well, in my bailiwick,
    horses are usually to be found standing in fields or, if the weather is inclement,
    in what are known as paddocks. What you need to do is to wait until nightfall,
    when their human guards will all be tucked up in bed, and creep stealthily to
    a field or paddock armed with a torch and a bag of buns. You will use the torch
    to examine, in the engulfing darkness, such features of your prospective horse
    as its mane, fetlocks, and withers. Look closely at its musculature. Remember
    that the horse you choose will be galloping across the land with you astride its
    back for many years to come. When you have picked a suitable steed, lay a trail
    of buns from the field or paddock to the gates of your castle. Nearly all horses
    find buns irresistible and, depending on how far the field or paddock is from
    your castle, your mighty steed should be safe in its new home by break of dawn.
    It is good practice at this point to pop down to the cellar to check up on the
    orphan.

    You are now nearly ready to go marauding and to strike terror into the countryfolk
    for miles around. But remember that earlier I mentioned your masked outriders.
    You will need these accomplices, partly for emotional and psychological support,
    but mainly to help you carry back to your baronial castle the booty from your
    robberies. Opinions differ on how many masked outriders a robber baron needs,
    but as a rule of thumb two would be an absolute minimum, and four or five are
    preferable. The more masked outriders you have, the more saddlebags can be filled
    with clinking glistening baubles and coinage. When you have decided on the number,
    you can get the orphan to make the masks, once the coat of arms is finished. Very
    occasionally, masked outriders will work on a freelance basis, but it is far more
    common for them to "live in" at your castle, and they will expect a share of the
    booty. Just be on your guard that none among their number gets uppity and plots
    to usurp you from your baronetcy. Such things have happened, of course, so always
    be prepared to offer small bribes (leftover buns from the bag used to abduct your
    horse, for example) or, in an extremity, chop the would-be usurper to bits with
    a broadsword. You should have a collection of these lethal blades displayed upon
    the wall of the main hall of your baronial castle. Get the orphan to polish and
    buff them regularly.

    With the bulk of your preparatory work done, all that remains is for you to set
    out on your first robbery. It is at this stage that many a neophyte has moral
    qualms. If, until now, you have been a law-abiding sort, conscientious when it
    comes to paying your bus fare and never dropping litter, you may get a bit jittery
    at the prospect of robbing people. That is why you should begin by robbing another
    baron. Later on, with some experience under your belt, you will be able to waylay
    little bands of peasants and take away all their potatoes as you cackle with evil
    glee, but to get you started there is nothing like another baron, preferably a
    robber baron like you are setting out to be. So how do you go about it?

    First, gather your masked outriders around the table in your baronial hall. They
    do not need to be wearing their masks just yet, and you will be able to judge
    their readiness for the task ahead by studying their faces in the light of the
    flames roaring from the magnificent fireplace. Have the orphan posted there, regularly
    feeding more logs on to the blaze. Each outrider should have been provided with
    a goblet brimming with a frothy alcoholic potion, gigantic flagons of which are
    arrayed on a sideboard for whenever a refill is needed. Let them carouse and wassail
    for a little while to pep them up. Then spread out a big map on the table. This
    map should show nearby baronial halls with tracks and pathways leading to and
    from them. You will have made a careful study of the comings and goings of other
    barons, and thus be in a position to know when one of them will be cantering gently
    along a woodland path astride his own mighty steed, possibly on his way to an
    assignation with a comely damsel. Use a crayon to mark the likely spot for an
    ambuscade on the map, and ensure that each of your masked outriders knows how
    to get there. Clash your goblets together as a mark of camaraderie, stamp out
    of the hall with great determined strides, and make a final check that everyone
    has empty saddlebags ready to be filled with booty. Now is the time to set your
    horses a-galloping and to crash through the trees towards the unsuspecting baron.

    Do bear in mind that your victim may have his own masked outriders, and indeed
    that the gentle cantering of his steed can be deceptive. If he is not just a plain
    baron but a robber baron, he may be setting out to rob someone himself. That is
    why you and your masked outriders are armed to the teeth with the various polished
    and buffed swords from your baronial hall. In order to fill your saddlebags with
    booty, you may have to slash and thrust at the baron and his masked outriders
    until they are reduced to a pile of corpses on the woodland path, their blood
    and gore gleaming in the dappled sunlight shining through the trees. If this is
    the case, it is worthwhile stripping them of their armour and adding that to your
    booty. You can take their horses, too, either by pulling them along on a length
    of string, or by laying a trail of buns back to your castle.

    However, it is a perturbing fact that, this being your first baronial robbery,
    you and your masked outriders may well come off worse in any slashing and thrusting
    of lethal blades. If you are worried that it will be your blood and gore gleaming
    in the dappling sunlight, and your mighty steed which follows a trail of buns
    back to another robber baron''s castle, you may want to reconsider whether you
    are making the right career choice. You may decide you are better suited to being
    a postie, or a scrivener, or the Member of Parliament for Sheffield Brightside.'
