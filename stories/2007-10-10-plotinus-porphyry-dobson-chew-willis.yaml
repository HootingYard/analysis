  text: 'Plotinus, the philosopher of ancient Greece who gave us the six Enneads,
    had atrocious handwriting, did not properly separate individual words, and did
    not bother himself with the niceties of spelling. His student Porphyry, who edited,
    polished and arranged the Enneads for publication, had the thankless preliminary
    task of transcribing Plotinus'' shoddy and near-illegible scribbles. That was
    almost two thousand years ago, yet in many ways it describes perfectly the working
    relationship that obtained between Dobson and Marigold Chew. The out of print
    pamphleteer had an abysmal scrawl, possibly because of the unusual way he clutched
    his pencil, like a monkey with a pin-cushion. It may be difficult to make sense
    of that simile, but go and lie down in a darkened room and screw your eyes tightly
    shut and everything will become clear. For salvaging any clarity at all from Dobson''s
    notebooks, we have Marigold Chew to thank. Without her, not one of those majestic
    pamphlets would ever have been tucked lovingly on to the shelves of a motorway
    service station or airport bookstall.

    Among much that they had in common, Porphyry and Marigold Chew were excellent
    proofreaders, capable of spotting the tiniest error and correcting it. This is
    not a job you would give to the American cinema player Bruce Willis. Mr Willis
    is apparently a keen contributor to blogs and chatrooms, and when other readers
    pointed out his many infelicities of grammar and spelling, he issued the immortal
    retort "proofreading is for pussies". He will not be considered for a work experience
    placement at Hooting Yard.'
