  text: 'This morning I learned, a tad belatedly, that Hooting Yard has been voted
    64th in a list of the Top 100 Liberal Democrat blogs. I confess to being utterly
    beflummoxed by this news, chiefly because I''m not a Liberal Democrat, have never
    voted Liberal Democrat, and doubt that I ever would vote Liberal Democrat. In
    the unlikely event that the "votes" cast in this poll were the result of human
    agency, as opposed to a fiendish electronic crunching exercise, then I applaud
    the good sense of those who voted. To reciprocate, here at Hooting Yard we did
    a quick straw poll to vote on our favourite Liberal Democrat. No prizes for guessing
    that the winner is, of course, Lembit Opik.

    One brief footnote: while we''re on the subject of party politics, I am reliably
    informed that Michael Meacher keeps an A3 copy of the famous Hooting Yard Pontiff
    Mnemonic on his office wall.'
