  text: 'It is almost four years since the Hooting Yard website made its debut, and
    in that time it is fair to say that I have built a reputation as something of
    an authority on the out of print pamphleteer Dobson. As a result, I find myself
    fielding a bewildering number of messages on my metal tapping machine from Dobsonists
    around the world. The range of enquiries is quite astonishing, and evidence of
    the continued relevance of this towering figure of 20th century pamphleteering.
    On more than one occasion I have been asked to provide a digest of the calls that
    come in, and my replies, but I am afraid that is not possible, for after scribbling
    on the back of a toffee apple wrapper each query and my learned response, I dispose
    of them in a cauldron of flaming pitch. Otherwise I would be up to my ears in
    toffee apple wrappers, and lack dignity.

    As a special treat, however, I decided to save one sample enquiry from destruction,
    and duly present it here, together with my reply.

    Dear Mr Key, wrote a correspondent from the picturesque Essex seaside resort of
    Jaywick, I wonder if you can set my mind at rest regarding a biographical detail.
    Was our Dobson the Dobson of the financial services consultants Pricewaterhousebaileydobsoncoopercooperhateful
    which, as is well known, attempted an unsuccessful leveraged buy-out of Hubermann''s
    department store in 1971?

    The simple answer to this is : No, he was not. In fact, the very idea of Dobson
    obtaining a position for which even a vague knowledge of finance was desirable
    has me laughing like a drain. Interestingly, however, the pamphleteer may have
    been as qualified as anyone else to adorn the boardroom of the company. I always
    research my replies to correspondents with thoroughness and rigour, and in delving
    into this one I discovered some striking facts. Note that the bid for Hubermann''s
    was unsuccessful: therein lies a clue. What I found, toiling away in the cuttings
    library of the Pointy Town Bugle & Cruncher, was that neither Pricewater, nor
    House, nor Bailey, nor the Dobson who was a different Dobson, nor Cooper, nor
    the second Cooper, nor Hateful had the faintest idea what a "leveraged buy-out"
    was. Half of them were scurrying about looking for a lever, one like Hazel Blears''
    central lever, while the other half were tapping sap from a pugton tree in Bodger''s
    Spinney. They collected the sap, each in his own pail, and carted it back to their
    headquarters in time for an important meeting with the Hubermann''s people. As
    one of the Coopers remarked later from his prison cell, "We couldn''t find the
    damned lever, our bank accounts were empty, and the police dogs were snapping
    at our heels, but we had plenty of pugton sap!" Much good it did them.

    Well, there you go. I think now you can understand why I burn all those toffee
    apple wrappers.'
