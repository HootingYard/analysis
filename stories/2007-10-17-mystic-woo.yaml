  text: "It's easy to be cynical about the idea of reincarnation, and even easier\
    \ to mock the countless websites devoted to mystic woo in all its forms. But today\
    \ I had what platitudinists would term a \u201Cwake up call\u201D. At Past Life\
    \ Analysis, you will find a simple \u201Canalysis program\u201D to answer the\
    \ question \u201CWho were you in your last life?\u201D It looks idiotic, and I\
    \ do not recommend reading the Disclaimer, but when I entered my birthdate I was\
    \ flabbergasted to get this result:\nYour past life diagnosis:\nI don't know how\
    \ you feel about it, but you were male in your last earthly incarnation. You were\
    \ a fictional athlete, a sprinter and pole-vaulter named Bobnit Tivol, and you\
    \ won many tin medals under the guidance of a cantankerous chain-smoking coach\
    \ called Old Halob.\nYour brief psychological profile in your past life: Seeker\
    \ of cakes and celery pie. You could have had great insight into ancient Etruscan\
    \ soap-making techniques. Others perceived you as a pioneering prophet of Edward\
    \ De Bono's revolutionary \u201CSix Hats Thinking System\u201D, even though you\
    \ only had two hats.\nThe lesson that your last past life brought to your present\
    \ incarnation: You fulfil your lesson by taking well-earned naps. You came to\
    \ this life to learn to brim with compassionate intensity whenever you contemplate\
    \ the spindly inmates of Pang Hill Orphanage.\nDo you remember now?\nTo which\
    \ the answer is\_: Great Heavens to Betsy, I do!"
