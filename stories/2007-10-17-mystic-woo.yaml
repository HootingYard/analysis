  text: 'It''s easy to be cynical about the idea of reincarnation, and even easier
    to mock the countless websites devoted to mystic woo in all its forms. But today
    I had what platitudinists would term a "wake up call". At Past Life Analysis,
    you will find a simple "analysis program" to answer the question "Who were you
    in your last life?" It looks idiotic, and I do not recommend reading the Disclaimer,
    but when I entered my birthdate I was flabbergasted to get this result:

    Your past life diagnosis:

    I don''t know how you feel about it, but you were male in your last earthly incarnation.
    You were a fictional athlete, a sprinter and pole-vaulter named Bobnit Tivol,
    and you won many tin medals under the guidance of a cantankerous chain-smoking
    coach called Old Halob.

    Your brief psychological profile in your past life: Seeker of cakes and celery
    pie. You could have had great insight into ancient Etruscan soap-making techniques.
    Others perceived you as a pioneering prophet of Edward De Bono''s revolutionary
    "Six Hats Thinking System", even though you only had two hats.

    The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation: You fulfil
    your lesson by taking well-earned naps. You came to this life to learn to brim
    with compassionate intensity whenever you contemplate the spindly inmates of Pang
    Hill Orphanage.

    Do you remember now?

    To which the answer is : Great Heavens to Betsy, I do!'
