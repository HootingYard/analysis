  text: "Ask any halfway sane person where they go to find out the latest information\
    \ on peas, and chances are they'll say \"Hooting Yard, of course!\" We have a\
    \ proud record of bringing pea news to the masses, and in keeping with that here\
    \ is a communique from roving Hooting Yard reporter Tristan Shuddery, received\
    \ yesterday:\nDear Frank : This is an important fact that you may wish to file\
    \ somewhere in your\n  pulsating cranium. According to Wikipedia's article about\
    \ the aviator and recluse Howard Hughes: \"In the 1930s, close friends reported\
    \ he was obsessed with the size of peas.\"\nAn earlier pea-related dispatch is\
    \ archived in October 2005 (see Monday 10th), but to save you looking it up I\
    \ thought I'd reprint part of it here:\nThey're small, green, solid, edible spheres,\
    \ and you eke them from pods. I am talking about peas, of course! Let us sing\
    \ their praises:\nAt the dinner tables of Hooting Yard / There's a food we hold\
    \ in high regard / Oh I wonder what can it be? / It's the little green edible\
    \ sphere called the pea!\nThe shelling of peas has long been recognised as a therapeutic\
    \ activity on a par with pig observation. Some doctors of the brain recommend\
    \ that neurasthenic patients should spend an hour each day shelling peas and another\
    \ hour leaning over the fence of a sty watching pigs. The experimental psychiatrist\
    \ Tarpin Paltrow suggested doing both at the same time, with results that have\
    \ been hotly debated ever since.\nIt was Paltrow's student P K Spaceman who coined\
    \ the term PQ, for pea quotient. Your PQ is easily calculated. Take the number\
    \ of peas you have eaten in your lifetime, and divide it by your age. This figure\
    \ can be plotted on a grid against, for example, your body mass index, rotundity\
    \ of head, shoe size, and various phrenological data. Dr Spaceman was fond of\
    \ citing Lloyd George's view that Neville Chamberlain had \"a wrong-shaped head\"\
    \ and put this down to a lack of peas in the latter's diet. Sometimes he attributed\
    \ it to a lack of peas in the former's diet, too.\nIn desperate circumstances,\
    \ for example when one's life is at risk, peas can become useful tools, or at\
    \ least adjuncts to tools. There is the story of the Antarctic explorer, clinging\
    \ by his frostbitten fingertips to the edge of a crevasse down which he was about\
    \ to plunge, who managed to clamber up on to the ice by fashioning a harness using\
    \ ribbons, elastic bands and frozen peas.\nPeas have been compared with planets,\
    \ sometimes, by poets. The author of the song we heard at the beginning of this\
    \ piece wrote other pea-related verses, in one of which he takes each planet in\
    \ turn--using the mnemonic \"mud, vinegar, ectoplasm, moorhens, jasper, straubenzee,\
    \ unspeakable, Nixon, popinjay\"--and contemplates them as peas in a pod, not\
    \ yet shelled by one of Dr Spaceman's wild-eyed brain-sick patients. There is\
    \ no mention of pigs in the poem. Make of that what you will."
