  text: 'Here is my three-step plan to reinvigorate British politics.

    Step One : The Liberal Democrats elect Chris Huhne as their next leader.

    Step Two : A cabinet putsch in the Labour Party sees Geoff Hoon oust Gordon Brown.

    Step Three : Returning to their roots, the Conservatives ditch David Cameron and
    replace him with a proper toff, Lord Home. As is the way with the aristocracy,
    his name is not simply pronounced as it looks, but as "Hume".

    Done and dusted.
