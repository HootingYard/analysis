  text: "Continuing very briefly with the political slant, I felt impelled this morning\
    \ to fire off an email to Boris Johnson. This is what I wrote:\nDear Mr Johnson\n\
    I just stumbled upon an online sample of quotations from your collection Lend\
    \ Me Your Ears, in one of which you claim that ping-pong was first called whiff-whaff.\
    \ I think you may be mistaken. Ping-pong was, at least in Britain, originally\
    \ known as \u201CGossima\u201D, and marketed as \u201CCausing immense excitement\
    \ and healthy exercise and is the nearest approach that can be to the game of\
    \ lawn tennis as played out of doors\u201D (1901).\nI trust that in the m\u0207\
    l\xE9e of your constituency duties and campaigning for the London Mayoralty, you\
    \ will do the decent thing and arrange for a correction to appear in any future\
    \ edition of the book. Ideally, of course, you will also make a public statement\
    \ on the matter. Such willingness to acknowledge past errors does smack a little\
    \ of Stalinism, but may go down well with the ping-pong community.\nYours sincerely,\n\
    Frank Key"
