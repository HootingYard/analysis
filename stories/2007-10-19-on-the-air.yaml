text: I forgot to mention earlier that your favourite radio show, Hooting Yard On
  The Air, is now broadcasting again, live from the gleaming new studios of ResonanceFM.
  The show is on at the new time of 6.30 PM on Thursday, and is repeated at 1.00 PM
  on the following Monday. Podcasts will resume shortly, and I will drop a note here
  when the Podcast Maestro has got that organised.
