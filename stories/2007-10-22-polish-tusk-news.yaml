  text: 'Is it just me, or does Donald Tusk sound more like the protagonist of a contemporary
    American novel than the next Prime Minister of Poland? "Donald Tusk" could be
    a plutocrat in a fat Tom Wolfe paperback, or a sidekick of Oscar Crease in William
    Gaddis'' superb A Frolic Of His Own.

    Mr Tusk''s Civic Platform is likely to form a government in coalition with the
    Peasants'' Party. Why haven''t we got a Peasants'' Party here? I''d vote for a
    peasant to be put in charge of things. Not a farmer, nor a Countryside Allianceista,
    but a proper peasant, in a smock, with a piece of straw in their mouth, and a
    stock of folk wisdom which I may well find incomprehensible. There must be a peasant
    called Hoouhmne who could be persuaded to run for office, the sort of Prime Minister
    who would award honours for the cultivation of Curiously Lumpen And Hirsute Root
    Vegetables so that Miss Hathorn wouldn''t have to strike her own medal.'
