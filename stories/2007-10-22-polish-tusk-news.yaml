  text: "Is it just me, or does Donald Tusk sound more like the protagonist of a contemporary\
    \ American novel than the next Prime Minister of Poland? \u201CDonald Tusk\u201D\
    \ could be a plutocrat in a fat Tom Wolfe paperback, or a sidekick of Oscar Crease\
    \ in William Gaddis\u2019 superb A Frolic Of His Own.\nMr Tusk's Civic Platform\
    \ is likely to form a government in coalition with the Peasants\u2019 Party. Why\
    \ haven't we got a Peasants\u2019 Party here? I'd vote for a peasant to be put\
    \ in charge of things. Not a farmer, nor a Countryside Allianceista, but a proper\
    \ peasant, in a smock, with a piece of straw in their mouth, and a stock of folk\
    \ wisdom which I may well find incomprehensible. There must be a peasant called\
    \ Hoouhmne who could be persuaded to run for office, the sort of Prime Minister\
    \ who would award honours for the cultivation of Curiously Lumpen And Hirsute\
    \ Root Vegetables so that Miss Hathorn wouldn't have to strike her own medal."
