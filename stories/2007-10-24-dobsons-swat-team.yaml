  text: 'One wintertime, in a period when he was watching far too many action films,
    Dobson decided that he wanted to have his own SWAT team, to deploy as the fancy
    took him. Marigold Chew pointed out to the pamphleteer that this latest notion
    of his was particularly demented. She asked him where he expected to billet his
    team, how he proposed to pay them, in what delusional circumstances he might order
    them out on a mission, and, crucially, what resources he had to ensure they were
    given a thorough debriefing, with access if necessary to post-traumatic stress
    disorder counselling. Dobson replied with a series of low grunting noises, before
    clambering into his new oversized Uruguayan fair trade kagoul and crashing out
    into the downpour. The kagoul was second-hand, stained and rent in many places,
    but it was new to Dobson and he thought he cut a dash in it, though of course
    he did not, for Dobson rarely if ever cut a dash, and then only by accident.

    As he trudged along the canal towpath into town, Dobson composed in his fuming
    brain the advertisement he planned to place in the "Situations Vacant" column
    of the Evening Sofa & Last Trump. It duly appeared, remarkably free of misprints,
    a few hours later.

    Wanted. SWAT team to carry out engagements on behalf of out of print pamphleteer.
    Some of the missions may be perilous. Applicants should be armed to the teeth
    and preferably dressed from head to foot in black, with big black boots and shiny
    black helmets with visors. You will be able to give a full account of the vitality
    of your pneuma, in the ancient Greek sense of the fiery essence in the air, the
    creative and animating spirit drawn into the body through the lungs and generating
    your innate heat. Benefits include free pamphlets and lots of smoking breaks.

    It did not escape Marigold Chew''s notice that the advertisement failed to address
    any of the questions she had raised with Dobson earlier. That evening, on the
    way to a peasant theatre adaptation of Airport Chaplain, she tried a different
    tack.

    "Assuming for a moment that a sufficient tally of persons with vibrant pneuma
    apply to be on your SWAT team, Dobson," she said, "What sort of missions do you
    intend to send them on?"

    "SWAT team missions!" replied Dobson, excitedly, as their tram ploughed through
    a puddle of ice, "Missions that will test their valour and grit as well as their
    pneuma!"

    Pressed to supply just one tiny example before they arrived at the dilapidated
    barn that had been converted by goateed trust fund gits into a "performance space",
    Dobson suggested that he would deploy his SWAT team in the event of a calamitous
    tram collision resulting in dozens of dead and injured tram passengers. Marigold
    Chew pointed out that as there was but a single tram that plied the tram tracks
    of the town, no such collision could take place. Dobson countered that the tram
    might collide with a bus. Marigold Chew pointed out that the timetables and routes
    of the tram and the bus had been designed with just such a calamity in mind, and
    so clever had the planning been that a collision of bus and tram was both theoretically
    and physically impossible. Dobson thought she said "implausible" and clutched
    at that straw for a few seconds until corrected. He then aired the idea that the
    tram might collide with wild roaming cows. Marigold Chew was forced to admit that
    wild roaming cows did sometimes roam wildly through the town, and could conceivably
    roam wildly into the path of the oncoming tram. Dobson looked smug. Marigold Chew
    then landed the killer punch by asking Dobson pointedly what his pneuma-inspired
    SWAT team would do if sent to intervene in a scene of smashed-up tram and the
    tangled and bloody bodies of tram passengers and wild roaming cows dead, dying,
    wounded, scarred, fractured, and hysterical. Dobson had not thought beyond the
    excitement of his SWAT team descending on cables from their whirring helicopter,
    and had no ready reply. But at the very moment that he was going to improvise
    some unconvincing flimflam, the tram clanked to a halt next to the dilapidated
    barn, and the conversation was forgotten as both Dobson and Marigold Chew alighted
    in the snow and rummaged in their pippy bags for their Airport Chaplain tickets.

    Remarkably, in the ensuing weeks, Dobson received several applications from SWAT
    team wannabes. It is to his credit that he granted each one a lengthy interview,
    less so that irrespective of what they said he rejected them all on the grounds
    that their pneuma was deficient. One hopeful felt crushed by Dobson''s decision,
    called on him armed with documentary evidence of absolutely fantastic pneuma,
    and became belligerent. Marigold Chew set the crows on him and he fled. The following
    spring, he and Dobson passed each other in the street. They spat at each other.'
