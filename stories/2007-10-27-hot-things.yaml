  text: "Among the most inventive minds at work today are our management consultants,\
    \ those busy-brained men and women forever thinking up exciting new ideas for\
    \ the world of work. We are all, I hope, familiar by now with \u201CHot Desking\u201D\
    , a revolutionary approach which allows a business to sell off half of its office\
    \ furniture for the greater good. Now I learn, somewhat belatedly, that the BBC\
    \ has launched a \u201CHot Shoes\u201D initiative. First the furniture, now the\
    \ clothes. What will be the next hot thing?\nHere at Hooting Yard we always try\
    \ to keep one step ahead of the latest management thinking, so we tasked Mrs Gubbins\
    \ to come up with a list of hot thing initiatives. Being an octogenarian crone,\
    \ La Gubbins baulked at the use of \u201Ctasked\u201D as a verb, but we fed her\
    \ a bowl of gravy pudding and offered to help find that knitting needle she mislaid,\
    \ and she soon came on board.\nShe initially decided to set up a working party\
    \ to originate and assess various hot ideas, but this was felt to be crass, until\
    \ it dropped the \u201Cworking party\u201D title and renamed itself as an \u201C\
    ideas silo\u201D. The silo has a hub with radii, each radius has a directional\
    \ pointing device, and at the end point of each is a \u201Cbrain crate\u201D.\
    \ Responsibility for sifting through the crates rests with Mrs Gubbins herself,\
    \ in between her core activities of knitting tea cosies and taking naps.\nAs a\
    \ result of her first such sift, Hooting Yard will shortly be launching a series\
    \ of hot initiatives entitled \u201CHot Pencil Sharpeners\u201D, \u201CHot Carpets\u201D\
    , \u201CHot Puddings\u201D and \u201CHot Peter Wyngarde Monogrammed Cravats\u201D\
    . I think readers will be able to appreciate the tremendous benefits these hot\
    \ things will have on the ongoing Hooting Yard project. And remember, you are\
    \ important to us. Please let us know what we can do to make further 360\xB0 improvements."
