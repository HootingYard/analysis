  text: "Dear Frank, writes Jonathan Coleclough, I recently attended an illustrated\
    \ lecture at the History of Reading Society on the subject of chalk mining in\
    \ Reading. I was delighted to see that the first screen of the presentation was\
    \ a quote about brick manufacture with the single-word attribution \u201CDobson\u201D\
    . From that point on I was confident I would have a good evening. I wasn't disappointed.\n\
    The subject of chalk mining is of interest in this area, as the enclosed photo\
    \ illustrates.\n\n\_"
