  text: 'Dear Frank, writes Jonathan Coleclough, I recently attended an illustrated
    lecture at the History of Reading Society on the subject of chalk mining in Reading.
    I was delighted to see that the first screen of the presentation was a quote about
    brick manufacture with the single-word attribution "Dobson". From that point on
    I was confident I would have a good evening. I wasn''t disappointed.

    The subject of chalk mining is of interest in this area, as the enclosed photo
    illustrates.
