  text: "It is twenty years since \u201CHooting Yard\u201D first appeared in print.\
    \ The words were tucked away in a squib of verse included in the 100-page pamphlet\
    \ Smooching With Istvan, half of which was written by Mr Key and half by the estimable\
    \ Max D\xE9charn\xE9. Alas, like the complete oeuvre of Dobson, this Malice Aforethought\
    \ Press publication is now decisively out of print.\nOn page 96, we find the squib\
    \ in question, entitled \u201CSlab's Song\u201D, the first verse of which is:\n\
    The man with the hammers is Traitor Bill\nHis flag is made of shoes\nHe shut up\
    \ shop in Hooting Yard\nAnd drowned himself in booze\nThis was actually written\
    \ a few years before 1987, but I can't recall when that might have been with any\
    \ precision."
