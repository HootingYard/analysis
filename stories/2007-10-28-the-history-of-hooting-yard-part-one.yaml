  text: 'It is twenty years since "Hooting Yard" first appeared in print. The words
    were tucked away in a squib of verse included in the 100-page pamphlet Smooching
    With Istvan, half of which was written by Mr Key and half by the estimable Max
    Decharne. Alas, like the complete oeuvre of Dobson, this Malice Aforethought Press
    publication is now decisively out of print.

    On page 96, we find the squib in question, entitled "Slab''s Song", the first
    verse of which is:

    The man with the hammers is Traitor Bill

    His flag is made of shoes

    He shut up shop in Hooting Yard

    And drowned himself in booze

    This was actually written a few years before 1987, but I can''t recall when that
    might have been with any precision.'
