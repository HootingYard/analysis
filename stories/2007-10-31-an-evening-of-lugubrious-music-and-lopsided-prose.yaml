  text: 'It''s not often that the command "Drop what you''re doing and go to Slough!"
    is irresistible. This is one of those times. Or rather, next week, Friday 9th
    November is one of those times, for on that day you should drop what you''re doing
    and go to Slough for An Evening Of Lugubrious Music And Lopsided Prose. David
    OutaSpaceman will provide the lugubrious music, and I shall be declaiming lopsided
    prose from the Hooting Yard archive. You can find details, including a handy map,
    here, if you scroll down the page a bit.

    Addendum : Ten thrilling photographs from the evening can be found here.'
