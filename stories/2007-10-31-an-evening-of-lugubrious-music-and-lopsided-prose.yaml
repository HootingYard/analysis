  text: "It's not often that the command \u201CDrop what you're doing and go to Slough!\u201D\
    \ is irresistible. This is one of those times. Or rather, next week, Friday 9th\
    \ November is one of those times, for on that day you should drop what you're\
    \ doing and go to Slough for An Evening Of Lugubrious Music And Lopsided Prose.\
    \ David OutaSpaceman will provide the lugubrious music, and I shall be declaiming\
    \ lopsided prose from the Hooting Yard archive. You can find details, including\
    \ a handy map, here, if you scroll down the page a bit.\nAddendum\_: Ten thrilling\
    \ photographs from the evening can be found here."
