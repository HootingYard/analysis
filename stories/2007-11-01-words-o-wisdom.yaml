  text: 'While we are on the subject of gormlessness, I think praise is due to John
    Philbin, the man who organised the completely fake press conference for the US
    government agency Fema. No reporters turned up for the last minute briefing, so
    the resourceful Mr Philbin got agency staff to pose as hacks and ask questions.
    When the ruse was exposed, he explained: "I did not have good situational awareness
    of what was happening". This seems to me to be a splendid way of saying "I haven''t
    got a clue what''s going on", and I intend to use it often as I bumble through
    life perplexed and befuddled, as I do. I think it will also be a good idea to
    retitle the story below Tiny Enid And The Nipper With Poor Situational Awareness.'
