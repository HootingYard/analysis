  text: 'Nothing now would serve him but he must be a madman in print, and write a
    book of Ecclesiastical Policy. There he distributes all the Territories of Conscience
    into the Princes Province, and makes the Hierarchy to be but Bishops of the Air:
    and talks at such an extravagant rate in things of higher concernment, that the
    Reader will avow that in the whole discourse he had not one lucid interval. This
    Book he was so bent upon, that he sate up late at nights, and wanting sleep, and
    drinking sometimes Wine to animate his Fancy, it increas''d his Distemper. Beside
    that too he had the misfortune to have two Friends, who being also out of their
    wits, and of the same though something a calmer phrensy, spurr''d him on perpetually
    with commendation. But when his Book was once come out, and he saw himself an
    Author: that some of the Galants of the Town layd by the new Tune and the Tay,
    tay, tarry, to quote some of his impertinencies; that his Title page was posted
    and pasted up at every avenue next under the Play for that afternoon at the Kings
    or the Dukes House; the Vain-Glory of this totally confounded him. He lost all
    the little remains of his understanding, and his Cerebellum was so dryed up that
    there was more brains in a Walnut and both their Shells were alike thin and brittle...
    so this Gentleman, in the Dog-dayes, stragling by Temple-bar, in a massy Cassock
    and Surcingle, and taking the opportunity at once to piss and admire the Title-page
    of his Book; a tall Servant of his, one J.O. that was not so careful as he should
    be, or whether he did it of purpose, lets another Book of four hundred leaves
    fall upon his head; which meeting with the former fracture in his Cranium, and
    all the concurrent Accidents already mentioned, has utterly undone him.
