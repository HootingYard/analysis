  text: 'Blodgett had a certain militaristic cast to his character, so when he was
    given command of a pocket battleship it was understandable that he got slightly
    carried away. He fretted and fussed over his epaulettes and other trimmings of
    his uniform to a somewhat embarrassing degree, so much so that he neglected more
    critical aspects of his duty such as keeping a proper log. Thus it is that we
    do not have a reliable record of his one and only voyage.

    This was a time of gunboat diplomacy, and Blodgett''s mission was to anchor his
    ship in a faraway bay, train his guns on the coast, and to threaten to blow the
    township there to smithereens unless certain conditions were met. All very straightforward,
    or it would have been had the ship not had for its navigator a man who had lost
    his wits. This fellow''s name was Trubshaw, and it is a wonder that he still had
    the confidence of the Admiralty, for he had been bonkers for years. Instead of
    steering the ship towards the faraway bay, Trubshaw pored over his charts and
    barked instructions through a pneumatic funnel that led to the ship becoming encased
    in pack ice thousands of nautical miles away from its proper destination. There
    was no township upon which to train the guns, leaving Blodgett at a loss what
    to do, other than to preen his epaulettes and other trimmings with a little brush.

    Trubshaw, meanwhile, was following his own demented star. He took to pacing up
    and down the poop deck shouting at the sky. Icicles formed on the brim of his
    navigator''s cap, but he seemed impervious to the cold. Not so the rest of the
    crew, huddled below decks wrapped in blankets and keeping their spirits up by
    playing board games and eating sausages. Blodgett kept to his cabin, using his
    log as a pad for doodling. He had lost radio contact with the Admiralty weeks
    ago. There was nothing for it but to sit the winter out and wait for the ice to
    melt.

    At this point, I expect the majority of readers will be avid for further details
    of the board games and the sausages, and I will not disappoint. However, before
    dealing with those crucial topics, perhaps it is wise to say a few more words
    about Trubshaw. His insanity was not in doubt, but what has never been established
    is whether he deliberately stranded the ship in Antarctic waters, or whether within
    the vaporous murk of his mad brain he honestly believed the ship was heading for
    that faraway bay. There may be a clue in the words he was shouting at the sky
    while pacing the poop deck, and by chance we do have a record, albeit fragmentary,
    of what they were, or some of them at least. By chance an airship packed to the
    gills with the very latest magnetic cylinder recording technology passed overhead
    one day, and some of Trubshaw''s shouting was picked up by its monitors and etched
    onto a cylinder, preserved forever. If you get a special coupon for entry to the
    sound recordings rooms of the Museum At-Or-Near-Ack-On-The-Vug, you can listen
    to this bewildering caterwaul. Dobson once planned a pamphlet on Blodgett''s voyage,
    and transcribed part of Trubshaw''s tirade, but abandoned the essay in favour
    of his justly famous Bilgewater Elegies. Thanks to Dobson, though, we can reprint
    the shouting, and gain an eerie insight into the crackbrained navigator pacing
    the poop deck of that ice-girt pocket battleship so many, many years ago.

    "Wheat! Bulgar wheat!" begins the Dobson transcription, "Wheat and gravel and
    sand and grit! Powdered paste! Paste in puddles! Gravel and sand a-criminy! Pitch
    and tar and globules of black, black, blackened goo! Cracking pods squelching
    underfoot! Pods of ooze and glue! Pitted black olives in a jar, pitted and black
    like a black pit! Cracked bulgar wheat and cracking sand! Black pudding! Vinegar
    down your throat! Malt and muck underfoot in vast paste puddles of goo!"

    It is difficult to know precisely what to make of this, except to conclude that
    Trubshaw was completely off his head and that, charts and barked instructions
    to the crew notwithstanding, navigation was not uppermost in his mind. That being
    so, we can get on to the more diverting business of the board games and the sausages,
    as promised.

    The ship''s cook was a follower of the dietary theories of Canspic Ougat, and
    that being the case there was little if any animal flesh in his sausages. One
    might, when munching, occasionally sink one''s teeth into a fragment of pig or
    goat or starling, but only a tiny fragment, often so tiny as to go unnoticed.
    The cook made his sausages from an Ougat-approved compaction of mashed up turnips
    and marshland reeds and grasses, leavened with some sort of secret curd. They
    came in two sizes, jumbo and cocktail, although the latter were not served on
    cocktail sticks due to Ougat''s stern prohibition of sausage-piercing. Holes,
    even the very wee ones made by the average cocktail stick, were anathema to the
    dietician, for reasons propounded in the preface to his magisterial Codex Sausageiana.
    Even if you are not particularly interested in sausages, this book is a fantastic
    read, and I cannot recommend it too enthusiastically. I try to read a few paragraphs
    every day, much as some people dip daily into the Bible, or into Prudence Foxglove''s
    Winsome Thoughts For The Dull-Witted. Much of the ship''s cargo hold was occupied
    by the cook''s crates of sausage ingredients, and he was forever puffing and blustering
    about his galley, kneading the turnip and marshland reeds and grasses and secret
    curd and occasional bits of pig and goat and starling into the sausages in which
    he took such pride, inspecting every single one with a powerful microscope to
    ensure that it was free of even the most minuscule hole. And of course, the crew
    gobbled them down greedily at mealtimes, both jumbo and cocktail varieties, for
    they had nothing else to eat. That''s quite enough about sausages.

    Blodgett had made it a condition of his command of the pocket battleship that
    it be stocked with lots and lots of board games. And so three entire cupboards
    below the orlop deck were stacked with them, from family favourites such as Plutocrat!,
    Dentist''s Potting Shed and To The Finland Station to more obscure games like
    Treat The Dropsy With Leeches, Butcher''s Shop Railings, and Fictional Athlete
    Bobnit Tivol Cement Running Track Challenge Cup Heat Four. On the rare occasions
    he popped his head into the cabin where the crew huddled together for warmth through
    that freezing polar winter, Blodgett was always pleased to see that they were
    kept fully occupied by one board game or another. The gang of sailcloth patchers
    took particular pleasure in Patch That Sail!, a fast and furious yet at times
    slow-moving game involving equal measures of cunning and luck. The board itself
    represented a piece of sailcloth, and indeed was made of sailcloth, and the players
    took it in turns, by throwing dice and moving their counters, to patch up the
    various rips and rents in the cloth with needle and thread. Meanwhile, over in
    one corner of the cabin, Blodgett was sure to find the crows'' nest men playing
    a sprightly game of Groaning Widow, a contest so fiendishly complicated that only
    the superior brainpans of the crows'' nest men had a chance of understanding it.
    Other, less bright sailors would watch, gawping, for hours, as counters flew around
    the board, spinners were spun, card-packs consulted, and little plasticine models
    of characters from The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann were put in place, knocked
    over, taken to pieces, remodelled, repainted, and had the heads pulled off them
    and substituted with special bonus tokens. Only a fresh pan of sausages from the
    galley would interrupt the crows'' nest men''s concentration, when they would
    sulkily take a break to feed, having taken snapshots of the board from several
    different angles to prevent cheating.

    And so the winter wore on, until one day the ice melted away and the pocket battleship
    sailed home. Trubshaw had abandoned ship by this time, stomping off across the
    ice floes in curiously subdued fashion, no longer shouting at the sky, his face
    barely visible behind the thick row of icicles dangling from the brim of his cap,
    stooping occasionally to pluck some kind of primitive edible life form from the
    cold, cold sea with his fur-bemittened fist. Blodgett watched from the prow of
    the battleship as his navigator vanished into the white nothingness. Weeks later,
    they began the return voyage, guided by the stars, which one of the crows'' nest
    men knew how to read.

    Blodgett was of course hauled before an Admiralty Star Chamber to account for
    himself. Why had he failed to sail to the faraway bay for a spot of gung ho gunboat
    diplomacy? He burbled and babbled and preened his epaulettes and other trimmings,
    but at no point did he ever mention Trubshaw. He had even expunged the navigator''s
    name from the list of crew pinned up on a post at the entrance to the Star Chamber,
    and inevitably there was no reference to Trubshaw in Blodgett''s hopelessly inadequate
    captain''s log. Which, I suppose, begs the question: did Trubshaw ever actually
    exist? Or was he a wraith or phantom, or even a ghoul, of the kind known to haunt
    ships of the line as they ply the oceans, sailing round and round and round, into
    the maelstrom?'
