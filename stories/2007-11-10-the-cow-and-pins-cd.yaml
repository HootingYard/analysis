    Here is a treat. Using his considerable technological wizardry, David OutaSpaceman
    has masterminded an exciting compact disc featuring over an hour''s worth of lopsided
    Hooting Yard prose from 2004, taken from the original ResonanceFM recordings.
    Personally, I can''t think of a better gift for readers or their nippers to find
    stuffed in their Christmas stockings. The disc comes in a Pansy Cradledew-designed
    sleeve featuring the famous "Cow And Pins" tavern sign drawn by Mr Key aeons ago.
    To get your copy, inclusive of postage and packing, shove APS6 into the Hooting
    Yard PayPal account over there on the right (under ''Donate''), and send your
    name and postal address to the Duty Git at hooting.yard@googlemail.com using the
    header "Gosh, Frank, I can hardly wait to receive my Cow And Pins CD!"'
