text: "\n\_\nHere is a treat. Using his considerable technological wizardry, David\
  \ OutaSpaceman has masterminded an exciting compact disc featuring over an hour's\
  \ worth of lopsided Hooting Yard prose from 2004, taken from the original ResonanceFM\
  \ recordings. Personally, I can't think of a better gift for readers or their nippers\
  \ to find stuffed in their Christmas stockings. The disc comes in a Pansy Cradledew-designed\
  \ sleeve featuring the famous \u201CCow And Pins\u201D tavern sign drawn by Mr Key\
  \ aeons ago. To get your copy, inclusive of postage and packing, shove \xC2\xA3\
  6 into the Hooting Yard PayPal account over there on the right (under \u2018Donate\u2019\
  ), and send your name and postal address to the Duty Git at hooting.yard@googlemail.com\
  \ using the header \u201CGosh, Frank, I can hardly wait to receive my Cow And Pins\
  \ CD!\u201D"
