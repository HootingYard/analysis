  text: 'Is stoning ever justified?

    "It depends what sort of stoning and what circumstances," he replies.

    - From an interview with Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari, leader of the Muslim Council
    of Britain, in the Daily Telegraph, 10th November 1007... sorry, 2007.

    It goes without saying that stoning to death is the only proper way of dealing
    with certain crimes, but as Dr Bari so wisely says, one has to be clear about
    what sort of stoning. That is why Hooting Yard is pleased to announce a soon-to-be-out-of-print
    pamphlet entitled How To Choose The Right Sort Of Stoning To Death For Ne''er-Do-Wells.
    This helpful work gives tips on many different techniques of throwing rocks at
    defenceless women until they are dead.'
