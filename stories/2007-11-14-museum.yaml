  text: 'Trudging around an autumnally glum seaside resort the other day, I was halted
    in the street by a municipal person armed with a clipboard. It was questionnaire
    time. I gave a series of succinct, if baleful, replies to queries about my views
    on the various amenities and attractions of the town, and walked onwards towards
    the deserted beach. I mention this only because, as I stood staring out to sea
    in the dying light, I wished I had been in O''Houlihan''s Wharf, instead of where
    I was, for then my answer to the question "How do you rate the local museum?"
    would have been neither succinct nor baleful but gabbling and overenthusiastic.
    Wildly so. For it is in O''Houlihan''s Wharf that you will find my absolute favourite
    museum in the world.

    I cannot begin to explain why the Imperial Museum Of Rotting Vegetable Matter
    And Other Agricultural Waste Product holds me in such a spell each time I visit.
    Its matchless collection of rotting vegetable matter and other agricultural waste
    product is unrivalled by any museum anywhere, its special collections of silage
    and slurry jewels which any museum curator would kill for. (Notoriously, one curator
    did just that, but his evil scheme was found out and he was transported to a drab
    rock, a speck of volcanic gabbro girt by mighty seas, where he ended his days
    being pecked at by auks and petrels.) What once had been the Imperial Palace,
    where scenes of decadence and debauch played out under the yellow light of a thousand
    Pastewick lanterns, is palatial still, and the more so now that room upon room
    upon room is packed to bursting with sacks of rotting vegetable matter and other
    agricultural waste product in place of the pointy-chinned aristos and royal grotesques
    who played and partied and waltzed and vomited here in the old times. The lanterns
    still shed their unearthly Pastewick light, but how truly splendid now the recipients
    of that yellow gleam! Sack after sack, in tidy rows, in stack upon stack, rotting
    and pungent.

    I said that the museum holds me in its spell each time I visit, and that is true,
    but not the whole truth, for I am held in its spell constantly, whether I have
    taken the days-long charabanc ride to O''Houlihan''s Wharf or whether I have not.
    For at night I dream of the sacks of rotting vegetable matter and other agricultural
    waste product. I dream of them each and every night, and I think of them in my
    waking daydreams too, every single day. For that doomed curator who was pecked
    at on the gabbro was my father, and I hold his memory dear. I, too, would kill,
    if I could but take possession of the silage and the slurry, the rot and the sludge,
    the mould and the mush and the muck.'
