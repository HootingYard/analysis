story:
  date: 2007-11-14
  id: 2007-11-14-thousands-of-unusual-and-arresting-facts-about-birds
  text: 'Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting Facts About Birds was one of the fattest
    pamphlets Dobson ever published. The title is something of a misnomer, for the
    remarkable thing about this work is that it contains not a single fact about birds
    whatsoever. Indeed, apart from the occasional passing mention of starlings (page
    49), shrikelets (page 92) and a swan (page 119), birds are signally absent from
    the text. In spite of this, the pamphlet has been hailed by the upstart young
    Dobsonist Ted Cack as "the most informative text on ornithology that I have ever
    read". Cack is not always the most intellectually agile of critics, though, so
    perhaps we should not take him too seriously, the way we might furrow our brows
    in deep concentration at even the merest squib from a theoretical colossus like,
    say, Terry Eagleton.

    Dobson wrote the pamphlet at a time when he was preoccupied with moles. He was
    fascinated by their burrowing habits, near-blindness, and twitching snouts. Although
    the snouts of moles twitch less than those of shrews, particularly elephant shrews,
    Dobson was enamoured of what he considered the more "moley" twitching of the snouts
    of moles. Why, then, did he not essay a pamphlet of unusual and arresting facts
    about moles, rather than birds, when it was moles that intrigued him during this
    period? It should be noted that his tract makes no mention of [insert Latin tag
    for moles here] either.

    A clue may be found in the fact that at the time of the pamphlet''s writing, Dobson
    was engaged in a feud with a bellicose undertaker from down Pointy Town way. No
    one can be quite sure any more what caused the vendetta, not even Ted Cack, who
    admits to utter beflummoxment about the whole matter. But there was an exchange
    of letters, among much else, and in one of these the out of print pamphleteer
    wrote as follows:

    "Not only are you a singularly bellicose undertaker, sir, but you keep the seats
    in your death carriage in a very greasy condition. My dry cleaners had the devil
    of a job returning my trousers to their usual impeccability after last I sat upon
    those seats when attending the funeral rites of Thruxtonshaw Beppo, the noted
    mole- and bird-expert whose friendship I had come to treasure. It is true that
    I have not sought from you financial recompense for the cost of degreasing my
    trousers, but that is only because I have a more terrible revenge in mind."

    The authenticity of this letter has been questioned, chiefly because the last
    thing one tends to associate with Dobson is a pair of impeccable trousers. I am
    not suggesting that he was forever covered in grease, far from it, but a certain
    shabbiness, even grubbiness, was part of his general aura, even the aura detected
    by our psychic brethren and sistren, as attested by the redoubtable Madame Boubou,
    who sometimes did "readings" of the pamphleteer''s ethereal being. Dobson himself
    was unaware of these, as the turbanned Madame was given to following him about,
    skulking down alleyways or creeping after him as he reconnoitred picnicking spots
    in fields and parkland. She would target him, from behind, with her fearsome gaze,
    and make visible his aura for long enough to allow her to scribble a few notes
    into her psychic notepad. Often such notes contained the words "grubby", "grimy",
    "dishevelled", and "splattered with muck"... and remember, that was his spiritual
    aura, not his solid, earthbound person.

    Anyway, whether it is genuine or not, it is the reference in the letter to Thruxtonshaw
    Beppo that concerns us here. Dobson--or the counterfeiter pretending to be Dobson--correctly
    identifies the deceased Beppo as a mole- and bird-expert, as indeed he was, and
    one who the pamphleteer met often in the final days of his, the mole- and bird-expert''s,
    life. They first encountered each other at a football match (Red Star Hoon versus
    Pang Hill Academicals), where Dobson had gone to make a tape recording of turnstile-clacking
    noises and Beppo was present as a turnstile-clacking counter. It may seem to be
    unusual employment for a mole- and bird-expert, but Beppo was the kind of impoverished
    amateur who was perpetually short of cash, and on this particular day he was actually
    very close to starvation. It is thought that Dobson took pity on the skeletal
    clack-counter and tossed him a pastry from his bag, much as one might feed a zoo
    animal. The two men rapidly hit it off, and indeed there was something juvenile
    in their camaraderie. They addressed each other by foolish code-names, "Broadsword"
    and "Danny Boy", using these soubriquets as an excuse to practice their impersonations
    of Richard Burton and Michael Hordern in the film Where Eagles Dare. Incidentally,
    the film''s screenplay, and the novel on which it is based, were written by the
    alcoholic Scottish writer Alistair MacLean, who is buried just yards away from
    Richard Burton in a Swiss graveyard. Several of MacLean''s novels include the
    phrase "the huddled shapelessness of the dead", suggesting that this was an idee
    fixe lodged in the writer''s gin-soaked cranium, perhaps an unvanquishable memory
    from his war service in the Royal Navy, where he was involved in action in the
    Atlantic theatre, on two Arctic convoys and escorting carrier groups in operations
    against Tirpitz and other targets off the Norwegian coast; in 1944 in the Mediterranean
    theatre, as part of the invasion of southern France and in helping to sink blockade
    runners off Crete and bombard Milos in the Aegean Sea; and in 1945, in the Far
    East theatre, escorting carrier groups in operations against Japanese targets
    in Burma, Malaya, and Sumatra. MacLean''s late-in-life claims that he was captured
    by the Japanese and tortured have been dismissed by both his son and his biographer
    as drunken ravings. The Huddled Shapelessness Of The Dead is also the title of
    an exceedingly rare and out of print Dobson pamphlet, a piece of fluff about dead
    bees.

    Dobson and Beppo began to meet daily, commandeering a corner table in The Cow
    And Pins tavern, where they talked for hours about both birds and moles. The expert
    knew his days were numbered, as he had already been diagnosed with the invariably
    fatal Withered Innards Syndrome, and it may be that he wanted to pass on his knowledge
    before he died. Intriguingly, in his eight decades, Beppo had not once put pen
    to paper, and his matchless store of information about birds and moles he carried
    entirely in his head. And what a head it was! The versifier Dennis Beerpint once
    described it, in conversation rather than in a poem, as "Beppo''s head, that great
    block of human head, dense and solid and mottled like a potato". He made this
    remark during one of his rare television appearances, on the Shadrach & Abednego
    chatshow, on which he was a guest in the week after Beppo''s death. There were
    others lined up to extol the bird- and mole-expert, including songstress Kathy
    Kirby and bowler-hatted Avengers star Patrick McNee, but Beerpint would not stop
    babbling, and in those days of live broadcasts and a more spontaneous approach,
    he was allowed to continue until the next programme--a three-hour silent black-and-white
    documentary about swans--was due to begin. It was, of course, on a different edition
    of the same chatshow that Beerpint became the first person to utter the word "Ubuntu"
    on television.

    If either moles or birds were mentioned in Dobson''s pamphlet Thousands Of Unusual
    And Arresting Facts About Birds, we could draw the sensible conclusion that the
    pamphleteer had simply mixed up the fantastic amount of information pouring out
    of Beppo over that tavern table. But as we have seen, moles are not mentioned
    in the text at all, and birds only in passing. Wherein, then, lies the enigma
    of the seemingly gratuitous title? One possibility is that Dobson was using a
    code, akin to the childish "Broadsword" and "Danny Boy" with which the pair of
    ageing rascals addressed each other. If so, I do not think it is a code anyone
    is going to crack. Dobson left a teeming pile of notebooks and scribblings, catalogued
    by Aloysius Nestingbird and others with heroic diligence, and it seems to me that
    somewhere in that paper Kilimanjaro they would have found a scrap upon which the
    pamphleteer worked out his cipher, if cipher it was. The bumptious noodlehead
    and pretend Dobson scholar Emeric Vinvanvoo made a fool of himself with his claim
    that the pamphlet''s title was an anagram of Ubuntu And Dust Can Be No Fruits
    Of A Horrid SAS Salt Gas, chiefly because it isn''t. That did not stop him weaving
    a ludicrous fantasy that Dobson and Beppo were engaged in some kind of top secret
    paramilitary gas experimentation programme. Wittily, one commentator dismissed
    Vinvanvoo''s ravings as "like something out of an Alistair MacLean novel", demonstrating
    a contextual grasp of the whole Dobson/Beppo affair which I quite envy.

    I am doing my best, you see, but though I have studied the pamphlet for years
    now I can still make head nor tail of what Dobson was driving at. Usually, you
    know where you stand with his titles. How I Poked A Pointed Stick Into A Hedge
    is a pamphlet in which Dobson writes about poking a pointed stick into a hedge.
    Christ Stopped At Eboli is about Christ stopping at Eboli. Granted, in both these
    works, as with almost all his pamphlets, Dobson veers off into often surprising
    digressions, but generally speaking he takes his subject, his fad or whim of the
    moment, and wrings out of it all that can be wrung, and more. Even the youthful,
    callow Ted Cack has had the insight that "whatever the topic of his pamphlet,
    Dobson''s ambition was to have the last word, to make any further approach to
    the subject futile, for at least a century, and preferably longer. Whether writing
    about carpet beetles or electrical wiring systems or a dub version of the soundtrack
    to Carl Sagan''s television series Cosmos, Dobson worried away at his theme like
    a small predatory beast gnawing upon the limp body of a smaller, non-predatory
    beast from which the life was rapidly draining, as it were a tawny owl with a
    hamster, or a shrew with a newborn goat, for example."

    So if we take Ted Cack''s metaphor and think of Dobson as a tawny owl or a shrew,
    what kind of hamster or newborn goat is he tearing to pieces in Thousands Of Unusual
    And Arresting Facts About Birds? Is that a question to which we can ever give
    a sensible answer? Well, I think we can. Not today, maybe, and perhaps not tomorrow,
    nor even this week. Nor next week, nor next month, nay even unto Saint Loopy''s
    Day. But I will promise this much. By the time you are all celebrating the next
    Saint Loopy''s Day, I will publish the mighty tome on which I have laboured like
    an idiot for the last God knows how many years. I long ago lost count of the number
    of tallow candles I have burned to light my futuristic flame-resistant reinforced
    plastic writer''s cabin where I crouch, scrivening away, through days and nights,
    year after year, sustained only by a peculiar soup-based nutrient slop and by
    a blinding conviction that my privations are worthwhile because I shall, finally,
    pierce the shroud of ignorance enveloping Dobson''s fattest pamphlet. And when,
    on that merry day, The Annotated Pop-Up Edition Of ''Thousands Of Unusual And
    Arresting Facts About Birds'' By Dobson, With A Preface, Introduction, Notes,
    Commentary, Afterword, Exegesis, Maps, Colour Plates, Exquisite Binding, Greaseproof
    Wrapper And Presentation Crate, Guaranteed Free Of Infestation By Microscopic
    Paper-Devouring Beings hits the shelves of your local supermarket, I shall smash
    my way out of my cabin and scamper through the meadows, flailing my arms and beaming
    with glee.'
