  text: "Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting Facts About Birds was one of the fattest\
    \ pamphlets Dobson ever published. The title is something of a misnomer, for the\
    \ remarkable thing about this work is that it contains not a single fact about\
    \ birds whatsoever. Indeed, apart from the occasional passing mention of starlings\
    \ (page 49), shrikelets (page 92) and a swan (page 119), birds are signally absent\
    \ from the text. In spite of this, the pamphlet has been hailed by the upstart\
    \ young Dobsonist Ted Cack as \u201Cthe most informative text on ornithology that\
    \ I have ever read\u201D. Cack is not always the most intellectually agile of\
    \ critics, though, so perhaps we should not take him too seriously, the way we\
    \ might furrow our brows in deep concentration at even the merest squib from a\
    \ theoretical colossus like, say, Terry Eagleton.\nDobson wrote the pamphlet at\
    \ a time when he was preoccupied with moles. He was fascinated by their burrowing\
    \ habits, near-blindness, and twitching snouts. Although the snouts of moles twitch\
    \ less than those of shrews, particularly elephant shrews, Dobson was enamoured\
    \ of what he considered the more \u201Cmoley\u201D twitching of the snouts of\
    \ moles. Why, then, did he not essay a pamphlet of unusual and arresting facts\
    \ about moles, rather than birds, when it was moles that intrigued him during\
    \ this period? It should be noted that his tract makes no mention of [insert Latin\
    \ tag for moles here] either.\nA clue may be found in the fact that at the time\
    \ of the pamphlet's writing, Dobson was engaged in a feud with a bellicose undertaker\
    \ from down Pointy Town way. No one can be quite sure any more what caused the\
    \ vendetta, not even Ted Cack, who admits to utter beflummoxment about the whole\
    \ matter. But there was an exchange of letters, among much else, and in one of\
    \ these the out of print pamphleteer wrote as follows:\n\u201CNot only are you\
    \ a singularly bellicose undertaker, sir, but you keep the seats in your death\
    \ carriage in a very greasy condition. My dry cleaners had the devil of a job\
    \ returning my trousers to their usual impeccability after last I sat upon those\
    \ seats when attending the funeral rites of Thruxtonshaw Beppo, the noted mole-\
    \ and bird-expert whose friendship I had come to treasure. It is true that I have\
    \ not sought from you financial recompense for the cost of degreasing my trousers,\
    \ but that is only because I have a more terrible revenge in mind.\u201D\nThe\
    \ authenticity of this letter has been questioned, chiefly because the last thing\
    \ one tends to associate with Dobson is a pair of impeccable trousers. I am not\
    \ suggesting that he was forever covered in grease, far from it, but a certain\
    \ shabbiness, even grubbiness, was part of his general aura, even the aura detected\
    \ by our psychic brethren and sistren, as attested by the redoubtable Madame Boubou,\
    \ who sometimes did \u201Creadings\u201D of the pamphleteer's ethereal being.\
    \ Dobson himself was unaware of these, as the turbanned Madame was given to following\
    \ him about, skulking down alleyways or creeping after him as he reconnoitred\
    \ picnicking spots in fields and parkland. She would target him, from behind,\
    \ with her fearsome gaze, and make visible his aura for long enough to allow her\
    \ to scribble a few notes into her psychic notepad. Often such notes contained\
    \ the words \u201Cgrubby\u201D, \u201Cgrimy\u201D, \u201Cdishevelled\u201D, and\
    \ \u201Csplattered with muck\u201D\u2026 and remember, that was his spiritual\
    \ aura, not his solid, earthbound person.\nAnyway, whether it is genuine or not,\
    \ it is the reference in the letter to Thruxtonshaw Beppo that concerns us here.\
    \ Dobson\u2014or the counterfeiter pretending to be Dobson\u2014correctly identifies\
    \ the deceased Beppo as a mole- and bird-expert, as indeed he was, and one who\
    \ the pamphleteer met often in the final days of his, the mole- and bird-expert's,\
    \ life. They first encountered each other at a football match (Red Star Hoon versus\
    \ Pang Hill Academicals), where Dobson had gone to make a tape recording of turnstile-clacking\
    \ noises and Beppo was present as a turnstile-clacking counter. It may seem to\
    \ be unusual employment for a mole- and bird-expert, but Beppo was the kind of\
    \ impoverished amateur who was perpetually short of cash, and on this particular\
    \ day he was actually very close to starvation. It is thought that Dobson took\
    \ pity on the skeletal clack-counter and tossed him a pastry from his bag, much\
    \ as one might feed a zoo animal. The two men rapidly hit it off, and indeed there\
    \ was something juvenile in their camaraderie. They addressed each other by foolish\
    \ code-names, \u201CBroadsword\u201D and \u201CDanny Boy\u201D, using these soubriquets\
    \ as an excuse to practice their impersonations of Richard Burton and Michael\
    \ Hordern in the film Where Eagles Dare. Incidentally, the film's screenplay,\
    \ and the novel on which it is based, were written by the alcoholic Scottish writer\
    \ Alistair MacLean, who is buried just yards away from Richard Burton in a Swiss\
    \ graveyard. Several of MacLean's novels include the phrase \u201Cthe huddled\
    \ shapelessness of the dead\u201D, suggesting that this was an id\xE9e fixe lodged\
    \ in the writer's gin-soaked cranium, perhaps an unvanquishable memory from his\
    \ war service in the Royal Navy, where he was involved in action in the Atlantic\
    \ theatre, on two Arctic convoys and escorting carrier groups in operations against\
    \ Tirpitz and other targets off the Norwegian coast; in 1944 in the Mediterranean\
    \ theatre, as part of the invasion of southern France and in helping to sink blockade\
    \ runners off Crete and bombard Milos in the Aegean Sea; and in 1945, in the Far\
    \ East theatre, escorting carrier groups in operations against Japanese targets\
    \ in Burma, Malaya, and Sumatra. MacLean's late-in-life claims that he was captured\
    \ by the Japanese and tortured have been dismissed by both his son and his biographer\
    \ as drunken ravings. The Huddled Shapelessness Of The Dead is also the title\
    \ of an exceedingly rare and out of print Dobson pamphlet, a piece of fluff about\
    \ dead bees.\nDobson and Beppo began to meet daily, commandeering a corner table\
    \ in The Cow And Pins tavern, where they talked for hours about both birds and\
    \ moles. The expert knew his days were numbered, as he had already been diagnosed\
    \ with the invariably fatal Withered Innards Syndrome, and it may be that he wanted\
    \ to pass on his knowledge before he died. Intriguingly, in his eight decades,\
    \ Beppo had not once put pen to paper, and his matchless store of information\
    \ about birds and moles he carried entirely in his head. And what a head it was!\
    \ The versifier Dennis Beerpint once described it, in conversation rather than\
    \ in a poem, as \u201CBeppo's head, that great block of human head, dense and\
    \ solid and mottled like a potato\u201D. He made this remark during one of his\
    \ rare television appearances, on the Shadrach & Abednego chatshow, on which he\
    \ was a guest in the week after Beppo's death. There were others lined up to extol\
    \ the bird- and mole-expert, including songstress Kathy Kirby and bowler-hatted\
    \ Avengers star Patrick McNee, but Beerpint would not stop babbling, and in those\
    \ days of live broadcasts and a more spontaneous approach, he was allowed to continue\
    \ until the next programme\u2014a three-hour silent black-and-white documentary\
    \ about swans\u2014was due to begin. It was, of course, on a different edition\
    \ of the same chatshow that Beerpint became the first person to utter the word\
    \ \u201CUbuntu\u201D on television.\nIf either moles or birds were mentioned in\
    \ Dobson's pamphlet Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting Facts About Birds, we could\
    \ draw the sensible conclusion that the pamphleteer had simply mixed up the fantastic\
    \ amount of information pouring out of Beppo over that tavern table. But as we\
    \ have seen, moles are not mentioned in the text at all, and birds only in passing.\
    \ Wherein, then, lies the enigma of the seemingly gratuitous title? One possibility\
    \ is that Dobson was using a code, akin to the childish \u201CBroadsword\u201D\
    \ and \u201CDanny Boy\u201D with which the pair of ageing rascals addressed each\
    \ other. If so, I do not think it is a code anyone is going to crack. Dobson left\
    \ a teeming pile of notebooks and scribblings, catalogued by Aloysius Nestingbird\
    \ and others with heroic diligence, and it seems to me that somewhere in that\
    \ paper Kilimanjaro they would have found a scrap upon which the pamphleteer worked\
    \ out his cipher, if cipher it was. The bumptious noodlehead and pretend Dobson\
    \ scholar Emeric Vinvanvoo made a fool of himself with his claim that the pamphlet's\
    \ title was an anagram of Ubuntu And Dust Can Be No Fruits Of A Horrid SAS Salt\
    \ Gas, chiefly because it isn't. That did not stop him weaving a ludicrous fantasy\
    \ that Dobson and Beppo were engaged in some kind of top secret paramilitary gas\
    \ experimentation programme. Wittily, one commentator dismissed Vinvanvoo's ravings\
    \ as \u201Clike something out of an Alistair MacLean novel\u201D, demonstrating\
    \ a contextual grasp of the whole Dobson/Beppo affair which I quite envy.\nI am\
    \ doing my best, you see, but though I have studied the pamphlet for years now\
    \ I can still make head nor tail of what Dobson was driving at. Usually, you know\
    \ where you stand with his titles. How I Poked A Pointed Stick Into A Hedge is\
    \ a pamphlet in which Dobson writes about poking a pointed stick into a hedge.\
    \ Christ Stopped At Eboli is about Christ stopping at Eboli. Granted, in both\
    \ these works, as with almost all his pamphlets, Dobson veers off into often surprising\
    \ digressions, but generally speaking he takes his subject, his fad or whim of\
    \ the moment, and wrings out of it all that can be wrung, and more. Even the youthful,\
    \ callow Ted Cack has had the insight that \u201Cwhatever the topic of his pamphlet,\
    \ Dobson's ambition was to have the last word, to make any further approach to\
    \ the subject futile, for at least a century, and preferably longer. Whether writing\
    \ about carpet beetles or electrical wiring systems or a dub version of the soundtrack\
    \ to Carl Sagan's television series Cosmos, Dobson worried away at his theme like\
    \ a small predatory beast gnawing upon the limp body of a smaller, non-predatory\
    \ beast from which the life was rapidly draining, as it were a tawny owl with\
    \ a hamster, or a shrew with a newborn goat, for example.\u201D\nSo if we take\
    \ Ted Cack's metaphor and think of Dobson as a tawny owl or a shrew, what kind\
    \ of hamster or newborn goat is he tearing to pieces in Thousands Of Unusual And\
    \ Arresting Facts About Birds? Is that a question to which we can ever give a\
    \ sensible answer? Well, I think we can. Not today, maybe, and perhaps not tomorrow,\
    \ nor even this week. Nor next week, nor next month, nay even unto Saint Loopy's\
    \ Day. But I will promise this much. By the time you are all celebrating the next\
    \ Saint Loopy's Day, I will publish the mighty tome on which I have laboured like\
    \ an idiot for the last God knows how many years. I long ago lost count of the\
    \ number of tallow candles I have burned to light my futuristic flame-resistant\
    \ reinforced plastic writer's cabin where I crouch, scrivening away, through days\
    \ and nights, year after year, sustained only by a peculiar soup-based nutrient\
    \ slop and by a blinding conviction that my privations are worthwhile because\
    \ I shall, finally, pierce the shroud of ignorance enveloping Dobson's fattest\
    \ pamphlet. And when, on that merry day, The Annotated Pop-Up Edition Of \u2018\
    Thousands Of Unusual And Arresting Facts About Birds\u2019 By Dobson, With A Preface,\
    \ Introduction, Notes, Commentary, Afterword, Exegesis, Maps, Colour Plates, Exquisite\
    \ Binding, Greaseproof Wrapper And Presentation Crate, Guaranteed Free Of Infestation\
    \ By Microscopic Paper-Devouring Beings hits the shelves of your local supermarket,\
    \ I shall smash my way out of my cabin and scamper through the meadows, flailing\
    \ my arms and beaming with glee."
