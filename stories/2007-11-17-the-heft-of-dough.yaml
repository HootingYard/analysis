  text: "The Heft Of Dough is the title of an LP recorded towards the end of the last\
    \ century by Agnetha and Anna-Frid and Benny and Bjorn (alphabetical order). The\
    \ Scandinavian foursome were joined on this occasion by virtuoso glockenspielist\
    \ Dot Tint, who until then was better known as the accompanist of an oompah band\
    \ devoted to masterpieces of the Baroque. Dot was introduced to Agnetha, Anna-Frid\
    \ et al, by her brother Rex Tint, the mezzotintist, who had been commissioned\
    \ by either Benny or Bjorn to create a mezzotint for the cover of an earlier LP\
    \ by the quartet. Temperamental Rex completed the work but, in a characteristic\
    \ fit of hysterics, destroyed it before it could be used, alleging that it failed\
    \ to meet the exacting standards he set himself. This is unlikely to be true,\
    \ and those in the know suggest it was simply yet another unreasonable tantrum\
    \ by the talented but tiresome mezzotintist.\nHis sister possessed a more equable\
    \ demeanour, and the recording sessions for The Heft Of Dough were notable for\
    \ their almost uncanny calm. Granted, Benny went postal one afternoon when Anna-Frid\
    \ sang her lines tapioca rather than, as the score required, marmalade, and he\
    \ threatened to tear her throat out, but it was only that, a threat, and he was\
    \ quickly persuaded to go and take a nap. It was Dot Tint who did the persuading,\
    \ and it was upon Dot Tint's divan that he napped. Dot took her divan everywhere,\
    \ for she was overfond of naps herself. Some said her calmness was closer to narcolepsy,\
    \ and I suppose it is true that she only ever seemed fully awake when bashing\
    \ beauty from her glockenspiel.\nPress interest in the sessions was intense. Agnetha\
    \ and Anna-Frid and Benny and Bjorn had recently had a hit single with the prize-winning,\
    \ insanely catchy song Lepanto, the lyrics of which cleverly use the 1571 Battle\
    \ of Lepanto between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire as a metaphor for\
    \ the more obvious pop pap theme of romantic love. To keep intrusive hacks off\
    \ limits, all approaches to the recording studios were baited with baffles, made\
    \ of cement. These served a secondary purpose of deterring Rex Tint from barging\
    \ his way in. The insufferable mezzotintist declared that he had \u201Cunfinished\
    \ business\u201D with Benny, or possibly with Bjorn, and was set on disrupting\
    \ the recording of the LP. Frustrated by the baffles, he took to stalking the\
    \ streets of the nearest township, cursing and jabbering, until distracted at\
    \ last by a fresh commission for a set of mezzotints, though this was a ruse contrived\
    \ by his sister Dot to lure him even further away from the studio. By the time\
    \ Rex Tint discovered he had been fooled, he was holed up in a chalet on the other\
    \ side of the globe while Agnetha and Anna-Frid and Benny and Bjorn and Dot Tint\
    \ were putting the finishing touches to their LP.\nThe Heft Of Dough is a concept\
    \ album in which the fivesome use the heft of a ball of dough as a symbol for\
    \ various historical attempts to measure the weight of the human soul. Perhaps\
    \ the best-known of these are the experiments carried out in the early years of\
    \ the twentieth century by Duncan MacDougall, attending physician at Grove Hall\
    \ Consumptives\u2019 Home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. MacDougall used an ornate,\
    \ oversized Fairbanks scale, designed for weighing commercial silk, to weigh his\
    \ consumptive patients immediately before and after death, reasoning that any\
    \ perceptible weight loss must be accounted for by the departure of the heaven-,\
    \ or hell-, or purgatory-bound soul of the deceased. MacDougall was following\
    \ the lead of the seventeenth century Paduan physiologist Sanctorius, the founding\
    \ father of metabolic balance studies, who coined the term \u201Cinsensible perspiration\u201D\
    . One has to admire the manner in which Anna-Frid et al address this material\
    \ in a deceptively light pop pap format, with Dot Tint's frantic glockenspieling\
    \ adding a frisson of frantic glockenspieling.\nThe critics were not kind, however,\
    \ The Heft Of Dough being almost unanimously dismissed as a work of pretentious\
    \ twaddle. One of the most savage reviews of all was penned by Rex Tint, under\
    \ an anagrammatic pseudonym. After it appeared, in the weekly magazine Mezzotintists\
    \ Turn Their Hands To Writing Record Reviews, and she swiftly unravelled the anagram,\
    \ Dot Tint refused to speak to her brother for a decade. Curiously, Bjorn, or\
    \ it may have been Benny, was more forgiving, and he and Rex Tint renewed their\
    \ friendship and thereafter spent many a tenebrous Scandinavian dusk sitting together\
    \ on the rim of a fjord, swathed in coats of rabbit fur, drinking hooch and babbling\
    \ into the night."
