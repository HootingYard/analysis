  text: 'Regular readers know that my grasp of matters ornithological is second to
    none, so it is only fitting that I have been asked to compile an anthology of
    fictional works with the word "owl" in the title. It might be argued that such
    a task is purely bibliographical and requires no specialist ornithological knowledge,
    but I will defend my ramparts, as one must in this world of rascals and cut-throats
    and people who claim to know rather more about birds than I do. I am used by now
    to lippy slanderers who accuse me of almost fathomless bird ignorance, and though
    I have been known to quail and sob, I try my best to turn my becardiganed back
    on my detractors and get on with the job. So I am pleased to announce that work
    on the anthology is almost complete.

    One of the works I turned up, and one I am annoyed about, and want to take issue
    with today, is Margaret Craven''s 1967 bestseller I Heard The Owl Call My Name.
    Now, really! Granted it is a work of fiction, but when did you ever hear an owl
    hoot "Margaret Craven, Margaret Craven"? That is simply not the kind of call an
    owl makes, and to pretend otherwise is to be living in a fool''s paradise. Of
    course, as a fictioneer, Ms Craven has the right to bend the world to her whim,
    and I am not asking for blinkered stodge, but there are limits to what the reader
    will accept. And before you start arguing that maybe the name the owl calls is
    not that of the author, but that of her protagonist, bear in mind in that case
    that the owl is calling out the name "Brian". I think you will agree that is equally
    as idiotic an approximation of an owl sound as "Margaret Craven".

    I Heard The Owl Call My Name became a bestseller some years after its initial
    publication, in the early 1970s, alongside such empty-headed slop as Jonathan
    Livingstone Seagull and Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance. Coincidentally,
    my other current project is a wholesale rewriting of the latter entitled Roman
    Catholicism And The Art Of Booster Jetpack Maintenance, in which the narrator
    is a futuristic science fiction Jesuit priest. Whether it will sell as ludicrous
    a number of copies as Robert M Pirsig''s mystic drivel is another matter.'
