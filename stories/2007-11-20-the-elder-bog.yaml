  text: "When you go wandering through the bogs, in your boots, make sure you do not\
    \ confuse the elder bog with the younger bogs. It is an easy mistake to make.\
    \ To the untrained eye, the appearance of the bogs is much of a muchness, one\
    \ bog looks much like another, and though you might be able to hold in your memory\
    \ that there is one bog pretty with swamp parsley, and another bog not, still\
    \ you will probably come away with a picture in your head of general bogdom rather\
    \ than of this bog and that bog clear and discrete.\nThere is an old countryside\
    \ saying, in this countryside anyway, that \u201Cevery bog was once a puddle\u201D\
    . If that is true, and reason tells us it probably is, then the puddle that became\
    \ the elder bog was there long, long ago, before you were born. Imagine that.\
    \ I expect when you were tiny your parents, or your guardian, warned you never\
    \ to stray near the bogs, and particularly not the elder bog. But now you are\
    \ grown you can roam at will. You can, if you wish, spend days on end among the\
    \ bogs, and I have no doubt that you do so. I know I would, if I still had the\
    \ means, but the bus to the bogs was rerouted a couple of years ago, and now it\
    \ goes to the tents and statues and nowhere near the bogs. I was told, when I\
    \ asked, that the bus company decided to bypass the bogs because so few passengers\
    \ ever wanted to go there, that in fact I was the only person who ever alighted\
    \ at the bogs. I found that hard to believe, but they showed me paperwork to support\
    \ their case. I flipped. The bus company person took me down with a pop from his\
    \ security prod, and I began to spasm. I haven't stopped spasming, actually, although\
    \ nowadays the spasms only come once or twice a week. But I can no longer get\
    \ safely to the bogs, so now I try at least to hold them in my head. You are luckier,\
    \ you can go to the bogs and stay there for as long as you like.\nDid you know\
    \ that all the younger bogs have names? There are no signposts, nor placards.\
    \ The names of the bogs are a bit like that countryside saying, known to the countryside\
    \ persons but to no one else. The bogs are called Lamont, Baxter, Oriflamme, Shambeko!,\
    \ Cuddy, Gooboohoo, Coldplay, Mocker, Pippy and Hudibidas. At least that's what\
    \ I was told, once, by a country person. He may have been pulling the wool over\
    \ my eyes, of course, for reasons of his own. But I am minded to believe what\
    \ he told me, because we were standing on a panel of pewter, and pewter encourages\
    \ the truth, apparently. The pewter panel was embedded in the muck close by a\
    \ barn. It had been placed there as a sort of \u201Ctruth platform\u201D during\
    \ the witch trials, another thing that happened before you were born. The elder\
    \ bog and the pewter panel were both there, part of the world into which you dropped\
    \ from your mother's womb. And most of the younger bogs were already there too,\
    \ except for Baxter and Cuddy, both so new that even the puddles they grew from\
    \ were not yet there on your birthday. I know that because I questioned your ma\
    \ or your pa or your guardian, and they confirmed as much. You will want to know\
    \ which of them it was I spoke to, but I am keeping that under my hat, as is my\
    \ prerogative, and do not for one moment think you can have it otherwise. I shall\
    \ guide you through the bogs, and my price is silence, at least upon the matter\
    \ of your ma or pa or guardian and what pearls they let fall when speaking to\
    \ me of you as a tiny.\nI said to you that you must learn to tell the elder bog\
    \ from the younger ones, and you will want to know why. The reason is very simple.\
    \ The elder bog is the only one that has been painted, by skilled painters and\
    \ geniuses, and when you roam around it in your boots I want you to be aware that\
    \ you are stepping through great paintings, not just through any old bog among\
    \ bogs. Bog At Dawn, Bog At Dusk, and Shimmerings: A Bog are among the masterpieces\
    \ of art in this country, they hang in the Imperial Gallery and each day thousands\
    \ file past to gaze upon them with due awe. So when you stomp about in your big\
    \ boots be aware of what you are stomping through. No artist of repute ever thought\
    \ it worth painting Lamont or Baxter or Mocker, or any of the other younger bogs,\
    \ but time and again the elder bog has drawn to it dazzling masters of paint and\
    \ watercolour and crayon. I am not sure it is true that, as a tourist brochure\
    \ states, it is the bog most often painted in this land, for I think there may\
    \ be a bog elsewhere more popular with our painters, as, for example, the bog\
    \ at Hoobin, but only the elder bog has attracted those artists whose names will\
    \ resound down the ages, long after you and I are dead. I, with my spasms, will\
    \ probably die before you do, and you of course have the advantage of being able\
    \ to hang around the bogs as long as you like. But do not think you will discover\
    \ an elixir of life in one of the bogs. I thought that, back in the days when\
    \ the bus still took me there. That is why I kept on going back to the bogs, because\
    \ of what I had read, in some out of print pamphlet. That is why I flipped when\
    \ told the bus would no longer take me there. It felt like a death sentence. I\
    \ can only envy you, skipping along through the bogs, putting up your tent and\
    \ camping out there for weeks on end, but I pity you too if you think for one\
    \ minute that you will find the elixir somewhere among Lamont and Baxter and Oriflamme\
    \ and Shambeko! and Cuddy and Gooboohoo and Coldplay and Mocker and Pippy and\
    \ Hudibidas and the elder bog. They are all just bogs and hold no key to eternal\
    \ life. It grieves me to say that, for I used to think I might discover in one\
    \ of those bogs something transforming and transfixing. That is why I daily took\
    \ the bus there for years and years, until the bus stopped going to the bogs and\
    \ instead went to the tents and statues. Even if I had not been beset by spasms,\
    \ I would have shunned the tents and statues, for what could I learn from them?\
    \ Everything I know I learned by roaming the bogs. So you would do well to keep\
    \ alert as you wander in your boots among those bogs, while you still can, young\
    \ and feisty and brimming with joie de bogs."
