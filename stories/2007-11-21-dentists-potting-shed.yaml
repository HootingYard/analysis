  text: "I have had a few letters from readers asking me to explain the rules of the\
    \ board game Dentist's Potting Shed, which was mentioned in the piece Blodgett\
    \ And Trubshaw. Now, I hate to disappoint, but I simply can't be bothered to write\
    \ pages and pages about what is, after all, a spectacularly dull game. Believe\
    \ me when I tell you that if I started trying to explain to the beginner how to\
    \ play Dentist's Potting Shed, we would be here all day, and probably tomorrow\
    \ too, and even then we would have got little further than the first chubbgut.\
    \ I would of course have to try to explain the meaning of a chubbgut itself, and\
    \ that is only one of numberless terms a player has to understand before the dice\
    \ are even thrown. So I am afraid that on this occasion I am going to ignore my\
    \ imploring readers. If you want to play Dentist's Potting Shed, go and buy a\
    \ set and read up on the rules yourself.\nYou might want to wait until next year,\
    \ however, when a special edition is being released. On the sixth of February\
    \ 2008, Hubermann's will have in stock the Dentist's Potting Shed Commemorative\
    \ Edition Marking The Fiftieth Anniversary Of The Munich Air Disaster. This special\
    \ set will include small plastic figurines of Duncan Edwards, Geoff Bent, Liam\
    \ Whelan and the other \u201CBusby Babes\u201D who perished as a result of the\
    \ crash. The figurines are not an integral part of the board game, so I think\
    \ the idea is that you can display them on your mantelpiece, if you have a mantelpiece,\
    \ or elsewhere, such as on a shelf, if you do not have a mantelpiece, and arrange\
    \ them so that they appear to be watching the game of Dentist's Potting Shed you\
    \ will then proceed to play with your pals. Some may think it eerie to be watched\
    \ over by footballers\u2019 ghosts, in which case the figurines can be left to\
    \ languish in the little thrum dimity bag provided.\nGiven the complexity and\
    \ tedium of the game, it is hard to account for its popularity. Last year at Bodger's\
    \ Spinney, an international tournament attracted competitors from as far away\
    \ as the Port of Tongs, and tickets to watch the final sold out within seconds.\
    \ The tickets themselves have become collectors\u2019 items, and I have to say\
    \ they are very beautiful, as tickets go, cardboard and beige and cut just so.\
    \ I have managed to amass six so far, at unholy cost, one from a beekeeping acquaintance,\
    \ one abandoned in a nest of thorns, one sold to me by a ragamuffin, one stuck\
    \ to a decoy duck in a pond, one I suspect to be a forgery and one I found being\
    \ used as a bookmark in a secondhand copy of Dobson's pamphlet What Planet Does\
    \ Jeanette Winterson Live On? I did not go to the Dentist's Potting Shed tournament\
    \ myself, partly because as I have made clear I find the game unremittingly boring,\
    \ but partly because I am terrified of ever going near Bodger's Spinney again.\
    \ It is almost three years to the day that last I lumbered towards the spinney,\
    \ and still I shudder every time I recall the gigantic hobgoblins that jumped\
    \ down from the trees and pursued me all the way back to Blister Lane. They were\
    \ not only gigantic but crumpled and toothless and stained with vinegar and covered\
    \ in arrowroot biscuit crumbs and sweat. Should you ever find yourself being chased\
    \ away from a spinney or a copse by hobgoblins, pray it is not the ones who chased\
    \ me on that grim November day.\nAlthough I did not go to the tournament, I read\
    \ every single press report I could find. I was less interested in the board game\
    \ than in the possibility that the hobgoblins would disrupt things, scattering\
    \ the dice and counters and cards and terrifying the players. But no matter how\
    \ thoroughly I scoured the papers I discovered nothing hobgoblin-related. I could\
    \ only assume that they had clambered back up into the trees and remained hidden\
    \ in leafage, allowing the Dentist's Potting Shed tournament to play itself out\
    \ in the wind and the rain. I was perplexed by this until I read, the following\
    \ spring, a lengthy article in the Bulletin Of Bodger's Spinney Hobgoblin Behavioural\
    \ Studies, written by an academic panjandrum, which explained everything in prose\
    \ so crisp it took my breath away. If you want to read it too, look out for the\
    \ issue of the Bulletin with a picture of Celine Dion on the cover.\nI mentioned\
    \ that I obtained one of my six tickets by buying it from a ragamuffin. What,\
    \ you might think, was a ragamuffin doing in possession of such a prized piece\
    \ of beautifully cut beige cardboard? I was certainly tempted to assume that the\
    \ nipper had pickpocketed it. He was tiny and bony and as skinny as a pipe-cleaner,\
    \ and it was easy to imagine him skittering, uncatchable, through busy city streets,\
    \ dipping and snatching. Was I committing a crime by paying the ragamuffin for\
    \ stolen goods? I did not like to think of myself as a fence, and I remained troubled\
    \ until, a week after the exchange had taken place, I tracked him to the travelling\
    \ circus of which he was an unlikely veteran. I learned that, from the age of\
    \ just five months, he had been known as Howler Monkey Boy, and that his daredevil\
    \ acrobatics, performed without a safety harness, were famed throughout the circus\
    \ world. Ragamuffin he may have been, but he was no thief. He explained to me\
    \ that one of his colleagues, a moustachioed nincompoop known as The Human Pencil\
    \ Sharpener, was a besotted devotee of Dentist's Potting Shed, had attended the\
    \ tournament when the circus was encamped nearby in Scroonhoonpooge, and had given\
    \ the ticket to the ragamuffin as a birthday present. Satisfied by this tale,\
    \ relieved that I was not a fence, I stayed around to watch that evening's circus\
    \ performance. It was bloody fantastic, especially Howler Monkey Boy himself,\
    \ at whose antics I gasped. I even got to have one of my own pencils sharpened\
    \ by The Human Pencil Sharpener, whose teeth-marks can still be seen upon it,\
    \ for I have not written with it since, instead keeping it in a little tin display\
    \ crate on my mantelpiece, for I have a mantelpiece. If, next year, I succumb\
    \ to the fad and buy the special edition of Dentist's Potting Shed, I may have\
    \ to move the tin crate to make room for the Busby Babes figurines. That will\
    \ be a quandary, but I shall deal with it as best I can. What I might do is obtain\
    \ a wooden panel and nail it up as a sort of mantelpiece extension. It would not\
    \ look pretty, but it would create more display space, and who knows what further\
    \ baubles and gewgaws I will want to add as the years pass?\nAnd the years will\
    \ pass, of course, and I am glad of that, for as each year passes I hope and pray\
    \ that the memory of the Bodger's Spinney hobgoblins pursuing me across the fields\
    \ will one day begin to fade, and that there will come a time when I might sleep\
    \ through the night without waking in terror, shuddering and screaming and scaring\
    \ the wits out of my cat, Jeoffry. For I will consider my cat Jeoffry."
