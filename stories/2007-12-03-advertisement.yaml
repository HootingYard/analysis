    Hello. I''m celebrity beauty editor Nadine Baggott. I have long been a true fan*
    of Hooting Yard and it gives me great pleasure to endorse some products which
    I am sure other readers will find really make all the difference. When I was asked
    to choose some fantastic new prepackaged foodstuffs for a very complicated commercial
    tie-in venture between Hooting Yard and the God Mammon, I thought of that line
    from Hugh Selwyn Mauberly by Ezra Pound, about being "born / In a half savage
    country, out of date; / Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn". I
    am half savage and bent resolutely myself, and it is a wonderful opportunity to
    move on from the world of pentapeptides, lovely as they are, to a different branch
    of the retail sector. So goodbye soothing face creams and hello boil-in-the-bag
    fishcake convenience foods!

    Well, not literally, because those scrumptious fishcakes are made by a rival manufacturer
    which has not promised to pour funds into Mr Key''s so-called Hooting Yard Enterprise
    Zone. No, today I am here to recommend not one but two great new teatime novelty
    snacks from Hubermann''s Teatime Novelty Snacks range. And you won''t find any
    pentapeptides in either of them! First up we have Smokers'' Poptarts, delicious
    poptarts in two different flavours designed specially for smokers. Simply pop
    them in the toaster, light a fag, and voila!, before you can say "Hello, I''m
    celebrity beauty editor Nadine Baggott," you''ll be sitting down to a plate of
    delicious smokers'' poptarts. Choose between bread pudding or synthetic bean curd
    flavours. Yum!

    Did I say "Yum!"? Well, you''ll be saying it when you try out the other great
    teatime novelty snack. I''m talking about Flatpack Eggy Pork Scratchings. That''s
    right, the wonderful combination of powdered egg and pork substitute scratchings
    in a flatpack format. Simply remove from the carton, assemble, and you''ve got
    another great novelty snack for teatime. Warning: not suitable for children under
    the age of four.

    Next week, if the cheque has cleared, I''ll be back to recommend some great new
    breakfast ready meals guaranteed free of genetically modified reconstituted potato
    pudding froth niblets.

    *NB : Nadine subscribes to the definition of a "true fan" helpfully provided by
    Victoria Beckham: "I think it shows you are a true fan when you cry or pass out.
    When the paramedics are called I think that is a good sign."'
