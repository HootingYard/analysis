  text: "This is a guest post by celebrity beauty editor Nadine Baggott.\n\nHello.\
    \ I'm celebrity beauty editor Nadine Baggott. I have long been a true fan* of\
    \ Hooting Yard and it gives me great pleasure to endorse some products which I\
    \ am sure other readers will find really make all the difference. When I was asked\
    \ to choose some fantastic new prepackaged foodstuffs for a very complicated commercial\
    \ tie-in venture between Hooting Yard and the God Mammon, I thought of that line\
    \ from Hugh Selwyn Mauberly by Ezra Pound, about being \u201Cborn / In a half\
    \ savage country, out of date; / Bent resolutely on wringing lilies from the acorn\u201D\
    . I am half savage and bent resolutely myself, and it is a wonderful opportunity\
    \ to move on from the world of pentapeptides, lovely as they are, to a different\
    \ branch of the retail sector. So goodbye soothing face creams and hello boil-in-the-bag\
    \ fishcake convenience foods!\nWell, not literally, because those scrumptious\
    \ fishcakes are made by a rival manufacturer which has not promised to pour funds\
    \ into Mr Key's so-called Hooting Yard Enterprise Zone. No, today I am here to\
    \ recommend not one but two great new teatime novelty snacks from Hubermann's\
    \ Teatime Novelty Snacks range. And you won't find any pentapeptides in either\
    \ of them! First up we have Smokers\u2019 Poptarts, delicious poptarts in two\
    \ different flavours designed specially for smokers. Simply pop them in the toaster,\
    \ light a fag, and voila!, before you can say \u201CHello, I'm celebrity beauty\
    \ editor Nadine Baggott,\u201D you'll be sitting down to a plate of delicious\
    \ smokers\u2019 poptarts. Choose between bread pudding or synthetic bean curd\
    \ flavours. Yum!\nDid I say \u201CYum!\u201D? Well, you'll be saying it when you\
    \ try out the other great teatime novelty snack. I'm talking about Flatpack Eggy\
    \ Pork Scratchings. That's right, the wonderful combination of powdered egg and\
    \ pork substitute scratchings in a flatpack format. Simply remove from the carton,\
    \ assemble, and you've got another great novelty snack for teatime. Warning: not\
    \ suitable for children under the age of four.\nNext week, if the cheque has cleared,\
    \ I'll be back to recommend some great new breakfast ready meals guaranteed free\
    \ of genetically modified reconstituted potato pudding froth niblets.\n*NB\_:\
    \ Nadine subscribes to the definition of a \u201Ctrue fan\u201D helpfully provided\
    \ by Victoria Beckham: \u201CI think it shows you are a true fan when you cry\
    \ or pass out. When the paramedics are called I think that is a good sign.\u201D"
