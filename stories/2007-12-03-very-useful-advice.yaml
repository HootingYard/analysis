  text: "\u201CIf you are considering dyeing a sheep, first ensure that it is your\
    \ own sheep\u201D.\nA huge debt of gratitude to the Guardian for alerting us to\
    \ that most worrying of modern plagues, the tendency so many people have to dye\
    \ sheep that don't belong to them. Would that Dobson were with us now! In his\
    \ pamphlet How To Dye A Goat (out of print), he hammered home the very same point,\
    \ or almost the same point, attending as he did to the dyeing of goats rather\
    \ than to the dyeing of sheep, over dozens of pages, to such effect that there\
    \ is not a single recorded incident of a person dyeing someone else's goat for\
    \ the entire period that the pamphlet was available in all good goat-related bookshops\
    \ and/or airport terminals."
