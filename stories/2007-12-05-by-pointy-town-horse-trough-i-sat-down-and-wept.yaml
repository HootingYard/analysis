  text: '"In place of a frog, we discover a point of hard, shrunken, cracked substance,
    neither frog nor sole. We cut the clenches and take off the relic of ignorance
    and barbarism, throwing it with hearty good-will into the only place fit to receive
    it--the pile of scrap-iron."--John E Russell, Rational Horse-Shoeing, 1873

    In this passage, Russell is clearly casting aside "ignorance and barbarism", perhaps
    to atone for the mayhem caused by his earlier work Irrational Horse-Shoeing. It
    was the latter book which had a profound influence on Dobson, who is known to
    have read it from cover to cover at least forty times. Of course, the pamphleteer
    had no interest in horses per se--he could barely tell a Knabstrup from a Yonaguni
    with his glasses on--but the panting urgency of Russell''s prose style as he describes
    various completely bonkers approaches to shoeing horses was something Dobson spent
    his entire curdled and despicable life trying to match. And so should you.'
