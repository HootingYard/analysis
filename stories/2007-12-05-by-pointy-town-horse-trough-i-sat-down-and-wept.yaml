  text: "\u201CIn place of a frog, we discover a point of hard, shrunken, cracked\
    \ substance, neither frog nor sole. We cut the clenches and take off the relic\
    \ of ignorance and barbarism, throwing it with hearty good-will into the only\
    \ place fit to receive it\u2014the pile of scrap-iron.\u201D\u2014John E Russell,\
    \ Rational Horse-Shoeing, 1873\nIn this passage, Russell is clearly casting aside\
    \ \u201Cignorance and barbarism\u201D, perhaps to atone for the mayhem caused\
    \ by his earlier work Irrational Horse-Shoeing. It was the latter book which had\
    \ a profound influence on Dobson, who is known to have read it from cover to cover\
    \ at least forty times. Of course, the pamphleteer had no interest in horses per\
    \ se\u2014he could barely tell a Knabstrup from a Yonaguni with his glasses on\u2014\
    but the panting urgency of Russell's prose style as he describes various completely\
    \ bonkers approaches to shoeing horses was something Dobson spent his entire curdled\
    \ and despicable life trying to match. And so should you."
