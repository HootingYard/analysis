  text: "Long, long ago, in what seems like another life, I used to be paid a pittance\
    \ to write capsule film reviews. Since then, I have always had great respect for\
    \ those who have mastered what is a bewilderingly difficult form, summarising\
    \ a film (or a book, or a play, or whatever) in one or two sentences. I was prompted\
    \ to recall my own faltering steps in the art by the television listings in today's\
    \ Guardian. There are four films on the terrestrial channels tonight, with only\
    \ BBC2 eschewing cinema, in favour of snooker. And what an inspired choice the\
    \ viewer has! Here are condensed versions of the (uncredited) capsule reviews:\n\
    BBC1, 11.20\_: The Ghost And The Darkness\_: tedious adventure.\nITV1, 11.05\_\
    : Showtime\_: leaden action comedy.\nChannel Four, 10.00\_: Happy Gilmore\_: feeble\
    \ sports comedy.\nFive, 10.00\_: The Glimmer Man\_: dull and clich\xE9-ridden\
    \ action thriller."
