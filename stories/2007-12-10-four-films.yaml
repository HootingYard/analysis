  text: 'Long, long ago, in what seems like another life, I used to be paid a pittance
    to write capsule film reviews. Since then, I have always had great respect for
    those who have mastered what is a bewilderingly difficult form, summarising a
    film (or a book, or a play, or whatever) in one or two sentences. I was prompted
    to recall my own faltering steps in the art by the television listings in today''s
    Guardian. There are four films on the terrestrial channels tonight, with only
    BBC2 eschewing cinema, in favour of snooker. And what an inspired choice the viewer
    has! Here are condensed versions of the (uncredited) capsule reviews:

    BBC1, 11.20 : The Ghost And The Darkness : tedious adventure.

    ITV1, 11.05 : Showtime : leaden action comedy.

    Channel Four, 10.00 : Happy Gilmore : feeble sports comedy.

    Five, 10.00 : The Glimmer Man : dull and cliche-ridden action thriller.'
