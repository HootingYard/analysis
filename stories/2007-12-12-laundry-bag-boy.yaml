  text: 'I have never been a fan of comic books, nor have I developed a taste for
    graphic novels. I can admire the skill and inventiveness, but somehow I can''t
    drum up genuine enthusiasm. Of course, as a child, I had my weekly diet of comics,
    including Pipsy Papsy, Factorum Et Dictorum Memorabilium, and The Dinky, but when
    I discovered proper books I was smitten by prose, and there was no turning back.

    Until last week, that is, when I discovered a fantastic comic featuring the cartoon
    superhero Laundry Bag Boy. I have to admit it has been a revelation, and I am
    smitten all over again, this time by crude and cack-handed drawings and by storylines
    which have surely been devised by a dribbling toddler. Yet there is a majestic
    genius about Laundry Bag Boy, his adventures, his scrapes, his pratfalls, his
    laundry bag, that I find irresistible. The comic I picked up, absent-mindedly,
    from where it had been discarded on a bench under a sycamore by a path in a park,
    was fat and dog-eared and threatened by rainfall. I thought no more than to carry
    it to the nearest municipal waste bin and consign it to oblivion, but the waste
    bins had been commandeered by an avant garde arts project organised by a man called
    Simon, whose name was Peter, just like one of the apostles of Christ. But whereas
    the apostles were, as Charles Bradlaugh (1833-1891) observed, "illiterate half-starved
    visionaries in some dark corner of a Graeco-Syrian slum", the artist Simon and
    his pals were goatee-bearded trendies from Shoreditch destined to rot in hell.
    Before they rotted, they had filled all the municipal waste bins in the park with
    some kind of compacted orange substance, hard as concrete, rendering the bins
    unusable. According to leaflets available from a temporary kiosk, this "art intervention"
    was a "courageous statement about Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror".
    Much as I would have liked to wander through the park from bin to bin contemplating
    this thought-provoking work, I found that my thoughts were paralysed rather than
    provoked, so instead I took shelter from the downpour under a derelict bandstand
    and began to leaf through the comic. I am so glad I did.

    Issue 10, Volume 34 of Laundry Bag Boy contained a couple of short strips about
    Douglas The Pig, who was, I learned, Laundry Bag Boy''s pet pig, and a few pages
    of adverts and promotions for other publications. The bulk of the comic, however,
    was a single full-length comic strip adventure called Laundry Bag Boy : The Shakatak
    Years. Now, just as in my adulthood I have never been a comics buff, nor have
    I ever cared much, or at all, for Shakatak, the British jazz-funk band who had
    hits in the 1980s with "Night Birds" and "Down On The Street", among others. Frankly,
    their smooth pap left me cold when first I heard it, and still does, two decades
    on. Readers who disagree with me, and who wish to champion the music of Shakatak
    and show me the error of my ways, are invited to argue their case in the Comments,
    but I will only pay attention to contributions which shake me to the core and
    force me to reassess my entire Weltanschauung. Those are the stakes. Be very careful
    before you tap that keyboard and hit "Send".

    The plot of the story, such as it is, posits that for a period of seven years--precisely
    which years are maddeningly unspecified--Laundry Bag Boy acts as a kind of familiar
    to the dull as ditchwater jazz-funksters. They remain unaware of his presence,
    but he is always there, haunting them, watching over them, in a patch of shadow
    on stage or perched up in the rafters of the recording studio, breathing softly,
    clutching his laundry bag, which is sometimes empty but more often about two-thirds
    full of filthy unmentionables long overdue for the washing machine. With his yellow
    hair and blazing eyes, we, the readers, can always spot the superhero, but to
    the Shakatak personnel, including roadies, sound engineers and hangers-on, he
    might as well be invisible. You may wonder why none of them smell the pong emanating
    from his laundry bag, at times when it is about two-thirds full. This is because
    one of Laundry Bag Boy''s superpowers is an ability to pluck from the empty air
    a canister of air freshener and spray the contents of his noisome bag until it
    smells of roses and honey and lavender and poppy coral and citrus mango and pumpkin
    and neutradol and peach and apple and one other fragrance the name of which I
    cannot be bothered to look up right at this minute. More than one critic, reviewing
    a Shakatak concert, is claimed to have dubbed them the sweetest-smelling band
    in the world, although whether this really happened, outside the pages of the
    comic book, is not something I am competent to assert or deny, for I don''t care
    one way or the other. I am less interested in Shakatak than in Laundry Bag Boy
    himself. I have read mountains of prose in my time, books upon books upon books,
    but never have I fallen so deeply under the spell of a fictitious being. Despite
    looking, from some angles, like an incompetent portrait of the columnist Peter
    Hitchens, Laundry Bag Boy, with his aforementioned yellow hair and blazing eyes,
    and his pet pig Douglas, and his conjured-up air fresheners, and his laundry bag,
    stands, in my view, above the heads of Emma Bovary or Oscar Crease or Sancho Panza
    or Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, or Hans Castorp or Molly Bloom or Murphy or Molloy
    or Malone or Tyrone Slothrop or Doctor Slop or the Widow Wadman or Ishmael or
    Ahab or Pangloss or Percival Bartlebooth or Bartleby, the scrivener, or Trilby
    or Svengali or Hazel Blears or Gregor Samsa or Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of
    Salina, or Batman or Robin, The Boy Wonder, or Robin Hood or Humphrey Clinker
    or Pip or Magwitch or Geoffrey Firmin or Asenath Waite or the Mad Arab Abdul Alhazred
    or Pinkie Brown or Charles Swann or Quentin Durward or Martin Chuzzlewit or Fu
    Manchu or thousands of other fictional characters. He is a true superhero, and
    yet has a humanity that is palpable. Not literally palpable, of course, that would
    be stretching my enthusiasm too far, but figuratively, or so I would aver, and
    had already averred, during that very first skim reading, sheltering from the
    rain under the ruined bandstand in the park, as I became transfixed by the adventures
    of Laundry Bag Boy''s Shakatak Years.

    When I got home, I reread the comic with closer attention, three or four times
    I think. I learned more about Laundry Bag Boy, that he had many more superpowers,
    and ones that made the air freshener thing seem like a party trick. He could,
    for example, meld his brainwaves with those of Douglas the Pig, giving him an
    extrahuman perspective on any given situation. He could count the number of pins
    in a pin-cushion, with unerring accuracy, in a split second, from behind a drystone
    wall. His head, including the yellow hair and blazing eyes, could expand to four
    times its normal size for up to an hour at a time. Secret flaps on his laundry
    bag could be manipulated in such a way that it was turned into an inflatable dinghy,
    with plastic oars, a couple of emergency flares, a compass operative on this and
    other planets, and a waterproof cabin for the pig. Strictly speaking, possession
    of such a laundry bag is not a superpower as such. It smacks more of the kind
    of gadgetry deployed by fictional spies such as James Bond, who was, of course,
    named after an ornithologist, author of Birds Of The West Indies, first published
    in 1936 and, in its fifth edition, still in print today. On one page of the comic,
    Laundry Bag Boy is seen studying a copy of Bond''s book while loafing backstage
    at a Shakatak concert. This appears to be wholly gratuitous, as no important plot
    developments hinge upon it, and indeed there is a marked absence of any other
    ornithological content whatsoever. There are not even any birds seen in the sky,
    always depicted as a uniform pale blue, cloudless, flat and artificial.

    I soon learned that such a sky is a constant throughout the canon, for I was so
    enthused by The Shakatak Years that I took myself off to a specialist supplier
    of comic books and bought as many other Laundry Bag Boy titles as I could fit
    into my own, non-laundry, bag. Regrettably, most if not quite all of the stories
    had a subplot related in some way to jazz funk, though not specifically to Shakatak,
    and yet this did not dim my glee. I deduced that either the writer or the artist,
    neither of whose names appeared in any of the comics as far as I could see, was
    a devotee of that devilish music, and lacked the self-control to expunge their
    aberrant leanings from the otherwise stupendous stories. Yet how often we forgive
    writers and artists for what are, after all, minor irritants. For example, I have
    never been able to stomach Dennis Beerpint''s infuriating habit of conflating
    dishcloths with other kinds of rags and sponges, yet I am still able to enjoy
    his verse for its vigour and punctilio. I feel the same about Laundry Bag Boy,
    much as I might wish that William Hurlstone''s Bassoon Sonata, say, could stand
    as a substitute for True Colours by Level 42.

    Another thing I have noticed about Laundry Bag Boy is that he never blinks. This
    may be a limitation of the cartoon strip medium, or it may be that his eyes are
    ubereyes, piercing and all-seeing and never for a moment at rest. And there is
    a lot for him to look at. Although the quality of the drawing is scrappy and fumbled,
    occasionally looking as if created by a cretin on a damaged Etch-A-Sketch, throughout
    the series there is an incredible amount of detail. The sky may be shown as flat
    and birdless and cloudless, but everywhere else in these pictures is a magnificent
    clutter of things. To take a picture at random, consider the opening frame from
    Laundry Bag Boy Gets Into The Groove With Herbie Hancock (Issue 4, Volume 28).
    Examining this with a Winckelmannscope reveals, in a rectangle taking up half
    the page, potatoes, bloaters, the weirdstone of Brisingamen, fourteen owls, dental
    floss diagrams, cotton, pins, pork rind, fur balls, rotating things, custard,
    muck, shoelaces, coat-hangers, an aerodrome, flame retardant fabric samples, snappy-cap
    tin cans, a glazed bowl, a Viking helmet, a syrinx, a rickshaw, geese, pots and
    pans, Edvard Shevardnadze''s golden tooth mug, bunsen burners and other burners,
    a tea strainer, a fencepost, gravel, cloth, sand, effluvium, ectoplasm, railings,
    a Brothers Johnson compilation compact disc, basil, hornets, dust, tweaking mechanisms,
    a pail of lugworms, a dictaphone belt, sandpaper, grimy unpleasantness, winches
    and pulleys, talcum powder, country and western paraphernalia, lozenges, screwdrivers,
    shredded wheat, box cutters, Basho trug holders, shipping timetables, phosphorescence,
    a spider''s web, a fountain pen, mysterious hat-like objects which are not hats,
    a basin, a dimity scrap, a bathtub, a shoe tree, a bee, an ice bucket, an immortal,
    a puppet crow with one button eye dangling loose, a puppet cow, a tap and an outside
    spigot, a copy of The Protocols Of The Elders Of Pointy Town, dubbin, flock wallpaper,
    old man''s beard, Mary Westmacott''s cot, hinges, blubber, fruit, clamps, sugar,
    goo, pond life, a desk sergeant, a calendar, litmus paper, an Unanugu jumper (darned),
    salivating weasels, snapping turtles, basalt, tonic water, goat pens, hacks and
    traps and charabancs, Wolfe Tone''s death mask, an earwig, a selection of different
    berries ready for the crusher, and the berry crusher, and another crusher, and
    yet other crushers, and crushers galore. It really is extraordinarily packed with
    detail. Laundry Bag Boy himself does not appear in this opening frame of the cartoon,
    and nor does Herbie Hancock. Their absence at the beginning is a crucial part
    of the plot, but I will not spoil it for you by explaining why.

    While I was buying up back numbers in the comics shop, I took the opportunity
    to pump the proprietor for more information about Laundry Bag Boy. Intriguingly,
    the shop was run not by a geeky nerdy nerd geek, the kind we tend to associate
    with such establishments, but by a batty crone with a Quakerly air about her.
    Her hair was white and wild and she had a decided plum in her mouth. She was kind
    enough to offer me, from a somewhat battered tin, a choice of arrowroot and Garibaldi
    biscuits to munch while I browsed the cardboard boxes packed with comics. Unlikely
    as it seemed, she knew everything there was to know about my new-found fictional
    hero, a walking encyclopaedia of Laundry Bag Boy lore and learning, arcana and
    imponderabilities, facts and figures. One thing she told me in particular had
    me quite perplexed. In spite of the popularity of the yellow-haired, blazing-eyed
    superhero, there was no official worldwide fan club to which I could apply. This
    seemed anomalous, when there are such organisations devoted to virtually everyone
    you can think of, from fictional detectives such as Sherlock Holmes and Solar
    Pons, to real detectives like Sir Ian Blair and Cargpan of the Yard, from Sir
    Granville Bantock to Rock Hudson, from Lascelles Abercrombie to Spiderman, from
    Mike Huckabee to Ayn Rand, from Brutus Maximus to Popeye, from Arianna Huffington
    to Ringo Starr, from Krishnan Guru-Murthy to Tuesday Weld. Yet in this seething
    maelstrom of often ill-advised fandom, there was an unfathomable void where Laundry
    Bag Boy ought to have been.

    I have decided to correct this preposterous state of affairs. Tomorrow, at 5.15
    a.m. sharp, I will be striding on to a podium by the perimeter fence of Pang Hill
    Owl Sanctuary, and announcing the formation of the Official Laundry Bag Boy Fan
    Club. If you are unable to be there, please write to me at hooting.yard@googlemail.com,
    with "Gosh! It''s about time Laundry Bag Boy had his own fan club!" as the subject
    header, and nominate yourself for an official post in the organisation. You can
    make up your own grand-sounding title. A roster of Fan Club Officers will be posted
    on this site, and badges will be issued in due course.
