  text: "Use Your Loaf is an exciting new panel game in which contestants are challenged\
    \ to recreate the feeding of the five thousand. Those of you who have read your\
    \ Bible will be familiar with the story. Having gathered five thousand men, and\
    \ an unspecified number of women and children, in some wild and remote backwater,\
    \ the Christ manages to eke a slap-up lunch for the lot of them from five loaves\
    \ of bread and two fish, also unspecified. On the face of it, this seems unlikely,\
    \ and one suspects either charlatanry or perhaps defective memory on the part\
    \ of the chroniclers who recorded the event. But the game is about wholesome family\
    \ teatime entertainment , not theology, so a pox upon those who get into a skeptical\
    \ flap, say I.\nIncidentally, I use the term \u201Cthe Christ\u201D because this\
    \ is now the accepted way of referring to the beardy preacher man following Melvin\
    \ Gibson's motion picture The Passion Of The Christ, also a piece of wholesome\
    \ family teatime entertainment, with added homoerotic violence.\nAlthough lacking\
    \ in homoerotic violence, Use Your Loaf is nevertheless an energetic and quite\
    \ dangerous game in which blood is often spilled. Each member of the panel is\
    \ given a bread bin containing five baps, and a tray with a couple of fish on\
    \ it. For health and safety reasons, the fish are not actual fish, but replica\
    \ blennies made of marzipan. Contestants must then answer a series of bap- and\
    \ blenny-related questions to win either a reasonably sharp kitchen knife, a pair\
    \ of pinking shears, a huge and lethal slicing machine, or a fretsaw. When the\
    \ tools have been allocated, the panel members\u2014usually consisting of Stephen\
    \ Fry and Stephen Fry's friends\u2014are given ten minutes to cut up their bread\
    \ and fish into as many pieces as possible. After the advert break, in which celebrity\
    \ beauty editor Nadine Baggott extols either pentapeptides or smokers\u2019 poptarts,\
    \ a lovely and arithmetically competent assistant counts up each contestant's\
    \ bap and blenny bits. The winner is, of course, the one who achieves a score\
    \ as close to five thousand as possible.\nUse Your Loaf is shown on The Bread\
    \ And Fish Programmes Channel every weekday at teatime."
