  text: 'I see that Channel Four, or the BBC, is showing, or has already shown, a
    so-called Liverpool Nativity, presumably a wretched attempt at making the story
    of the birth of The Christ "relevant" to today''s feckless Britons, or at least
    to their northern segment. At Hooting Yard we have no truck with such twaddle.
    But while you are not watching the Liverpool Nativity you might be diverted by
    a brief account of the Pointy Town Nativity, an annual jamboree which has nothing
    to do with The Christ as such. The birth that is celebrated is that of a pig,
    the firstborn pig on Scroonhoonpooge farmyard after the feast of Saint Loopy,
    and known throughout the succeeding year as the New Pig.

    Much to the consternation of the Pointy Towners, adherents of various religions
    have taken offence at their beano. Those big but, let''s face it, witless books,
    the Bible, the Torah and the Koran, each get into a bit of a flap about pigs,
    deriding them as unclean abominable cloven-hooved beasts. On the contrary, pigs
    are charming, intelligent, loveable, and delightful animals, and it is well-known
    that leaning over the fence of a pig sty and watching pigs for an hour a day is
    one of the most relaxing activities known to humankind. You would be astonished
    at the kerfuffle caused a year or so ago when the New Pig was given the name Mohammed,
    which was viewed in Pointy Town as a compliment. Any name attached to a pig is
    thereby raised above the level of everyday Dennises and Ednas and Demi-Leighs
    and Kyles. A similar, but less violent, reaction occurred when the New Pig was
    named Jesus, but that is unlikely to be repeated due to the Gibsonian practice
    of dropping the J-word and referring simply to The Christ.

    Pig nomenclature has become something of a minefield, then, but that does not
    deter the good people of Pointy Town, who have a healthy and positive attitude
    to their pigs, the celebration of the birth of the New Pig being the proof of
    the pudding. (I am not entirely sure that last phrase means anything, or at least
    that it means what I intend it to mean, but I would ask readers to cut me some
    slack.)

    On Saint Loopy''s Day itself, the pregnant pigs of Scroonhoonpooge farmyard are
    gathered in a special piggery unit, part of an enormous barn decorated for the
    occasion with flags and bunting and embroidered portraits of Saint Loopy. Roaring
    Sawtooth jets from Pointy Town aerodrome screech across the sky in a series of
    fly-pasts and dozens of dirigibles loom over the barn. Meanwhile, the current,
    soon to be displaced New Pig is given a crate of crab apples and conference pears
    to feast upon. There is much wassail and jocundity, especially near the caves,
    where the Pointy Town cave-dwelling troglodytes'' curiosity is sparked, and they
    creep into the light for the only time in a twelvemonth. Outside the post office,
    a person upon a podium reads passages from the Pointy Town Pig Chronicle, recalling
    past New Pigs and their names, from the controversial Mohammed and Jesus to less
    troublesome ones such as Popsy, Hudibras, Quetzalcoatl, Poopy, Christopher Plummer,
    Gervase and Winifred. A hopelessly overqualified veterinary surgeon keeps a beady
    eye on the pregnant pigs, ready to relay news of the first whelping via a pneumatic
    communications tube to the Pointy Town Pig Nativity Announcer. There is dance
    band music, much trumpetry, the eating of milk slops, conjuring tricks, chanting,
    caterwauling, hysteria and shamanistic fire-dancing. Over by the Pointy Town potato
    patch, raw potatoes are carved into piggy shapes by trained potato-carving experts.
    And when, eventually, the New Pig is born, a hush descends upon the town, from
    Scroonhoonpooge farmyard to the horrible caves, while the Pointy Towners wait
    to hear the chosen name.

    The Naming of the New Pig is a solemn contrast to the rowdy celebrations which
    precede it. So solemn, indeed, that the silence is broken now and then by the
    sounds of sobbing and weeping and the rending of garments. Eventually, a designated
    orphan child will pluck a name out of thin air, and paint it, with a dangerous
    lead-based paint, on the outside of the barn. And thus the Pointy Town Nativity
    comes to a close, as the New Pig is given gifts of bran-tub scrapings, and the
    old New Pig is led away to an ordinary sty, and the townspeople trudge back to
    their daily drudgery, and the planet continues to spin upon its axis for no apparent
    purpose.'
