  text: "\nThis is a detail from a picture which appeared long ago in the Hooting\
    \ Yard Calendar 1993. I reproduce it here partly on a whim, and partly to alert\
    \ readers to the fact that in the new year I will be auctioning the artwork from\
    \ one or more Hooting Yard Calendars. Given that the successful bidders (if any)\
    \ will be buying the original pen, pencil, Tippex, and what have you drawings,\
    \ I'm hoping the sales will attract \u201Cart\u201D prices\u2026 you know, stupid\
    \ amounts of money. It could be that I'm living in a fool's paradise, but even\
    \ if that's the case, I would like to ask readers to post expressions of interest\
    \ in the Comments, so I can get an idea whether to go ahead with this harebrained\
    \ scheme. An expression of interest is just that, not a commitment, and by all\
    \ means post anonymously if you so wish. Oh, and I haven't yet decided whether\
    \ to auction single drawings or a whole calendar's artwork as a set, so you might\
    \ want to suggest a preference."
