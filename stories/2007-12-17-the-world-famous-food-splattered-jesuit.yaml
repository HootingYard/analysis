    This is a detail from a picture which appeared long ago in the Hooting Yard Calendar
    1993. I reproduce it here partly on a whim, and partly to alert readers to the
    fact that in the new year I will be auctioning the artwork from one or more Hooting
    Yard Calendars. Given that the successful bidders (if any) will be buying the
    original pen, pencil, Tippex, and what have you drawings, I''m hoping the sales
    will attract "art" prices... you know, stupid amounts of money. It could be that
    I''m living in a fool''s paradise, but even if that''s the case, I would like
    to ask readers to post expressions of interest in the Comments, so I can get an
    idea whether to go ahead with this harebrained scheme. An expression of interest
    is just that, not a commitment, and by all means post anonymously if you so wish.
    Oh, and I haven''t yet decided whether to auction single drawings or a whole calendar''s
    artwork as a set, so you might want to suggest a preference.'
