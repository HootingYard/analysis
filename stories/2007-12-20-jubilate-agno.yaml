    \ I am happy to report that a reading of the complete work, all three hours of\
    \ it, by Mr Key and the spoken word performer Germander Speedwell, has now been\
    \ recorded and will be broadcast (and podcast) by Resonance104.4FM on Thursday\

    \ podcast is permanently available here. I humbly suggest that you download it\
