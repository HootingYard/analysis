  text: 'Last month I mentioned, in passing, Christopher Smart''s poem Jubilate Agno.
    I am happy to report that a reading of the complete work, all three hours of it,
    by Mr Key and the spoken word performer Germander Speedwell, has now been recorded
    and will be broadcast (and podcast) by Resonance104.4FM on Thursday 27th December
    at 12 noon GMT. Further details here and here.

    UPDATE :  The podcast is permanently available here. I humbly suggest that you
    download it and set aside three hours every day to listen to it in full.'
