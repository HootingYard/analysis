  text: The appointment of Brian Eno (aged 59) as the Liberal Democrats' adviser to
    help new leader Nick Clegg (aged 40) keep in touch with Britain's youth has caused
    much hilarity in blogland. I particularly liked this post which reminds us of
    some of Brian's more enticing plans and projects. Yet I fear people are too quick
    to ridicule what is obviously a piece of visionary brilliance. Just imagine the
    transformation in the packs of brainless hoodies and gun-toting pre-pubescent
    inner city "gangstas" if, instead of being issued with Asbos, they are given a
    stiff dose of Oblique Strategies, innit?
