  text: "The appointment of Brian Eno (aged 59) as the Liberal Democrats\u2019 adviser\
    \ to help new leader Nick Clegg (aged 40) keep in touch with Britain's youth has\
    \ caused much hilarity in blogland. I particularly liked this post which reminds\
    \ us of some of Brian's more enticing plans and projects. Yet I fear people are\
    \ too quick to ridicule what is obviously a piece of visionary brilliance. Just\
    \ imagine the transformation in the packs of brainless hoodies and gun-toting\
    \ pre-pubescent inner city \u201Cgangstas\u201D if, instead of being issued with\
    \ Asbos, they are given a stiff dose of Oblique Strategies, innit?"
