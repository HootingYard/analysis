  text: 'So. My harebrained scheme for 2008 is to turn Hooting Yard into a daily blog.
    This will not change the fundamental character of your favourite website, for
    it will continue to record the doings of the out of print pamphleteer Dobson and
    all those other characters, such as the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage, who you
    have come to cherish in your bosoms. But I thought I should make an effort to
    be busier during those times when the muse fails to strike.

    By looking at the Categories list over to the right, I see that during 2007 I
    posted 99 pieces of prose, which isn''t bad going, but clearly trying for 365
    would be foolhardy. Though I prize the quality of foolhardiness more than most,
    I am not going to set myself an impossible task. Brimming with enthusiasm as I
    am today, however, I can see no reason short of idleness why the year to come
    cannot be packed with more entries under Random Twaddle, Things I Have Learned,
    or indeed Quotations. The latter has only one entry for the year just about to
    end, which I suspect is due to my having shoved other quotations into the wrong
    category. And I think one thing I have tended to neglect is drawing readers''
    attention to particularly splendid items I find elsewhere on the net--such as
    this piece about the Mundaneum.

    I am hoping that the idea of a Daily Hooting Yard does not crumble to dust by,
    oh, about the third or fourth of January, so bear in mind that suggestions and
    contributions are always welcome from readers, either in the Comments or directly
    to hooting.yard@googlemail.com

    Meanwhile, go and listen to Jubilate Agno again. It is "strangely mesmeric" according
    to one correspondent, who tells me he has so far listened to it, all the way through,
    four times. Very sensible man.'
