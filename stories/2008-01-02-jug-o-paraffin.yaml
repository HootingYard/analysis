  date: 2008-01-02

  text: "A curious tale attaches itself to the shortest pamphlet Dobson ever published.\
    \ Of a light-hearted, even frisky, disposition one foul winter's day, he wrote\
    \ as follows:\nObtain a large jug of paraffin. Remove the cap from the jug and\
    \ slosh the paraffin over a pile of something dry and brittle in a public place.\
    \ Toss a lighted match onto it, stand back, and watch the resulting blaze. This\
    \ will warm your cockles and provide a pleasing spectacle to pass the time of\
    \ day.\nHaving nothing further to add, the pamphleteer persuaded Marigold Chew\
    \ to set these four sentences in a particularly decisive and heroic typeface,\
    \ and issued it under the unambiguous title Fun With Paraffin! For the cover,\
    \ Marigold Chew chose a mezzotint by the mezzotintist Rex Tint, depicting his\
    \ sister Dot Tint hand-tinting one of his mezzotints with a paraffin-based colourant.\
    \ Before doing any typesetting or production work on the pamphlet, however, Marigold\
    \ Chew had a fractious to-do with Dobson over his use of the word jug. She insisted\
    \ that a jug was by definition an open-necked container, and that he should prefer\
    \ the word canister, for a canister would have a cap, and be a more likely receptacle\
    \ for paraffin, than would a jug, which, though it may be fitted with a plug or\
    \ stopper, would never have a cap.\nDobson never took kindly to having his errors\
    \ pointed out to him, believing that the sheer force of his prose, even in so\
    \ short a pamphlet as this, ought to silence his critics. He was fond of quoting\
    \ Christopher Smart's line from Jubilate Agno, where the poet says \u201CFor I\
    \ pray God for the ostriches of Salisbury Plain, the beavers of the Medway, and\
    \ silver fish of Thames\u201D. Sorry, wrong line. I was distracted there for a\
    \ moment by a freshly-laundered dishcloth flapping in the breeze. The line Dobson\
    \ liked to use to defend himself against detractors was \u201CFor my talent is\
    \ to give an Impression upon words by punching, that when the reader casts his\
    \ eye upon \u2018em, he takes up the image from the mould which I have made\u201D\
    .\nMarigold Chew, though, was a stickler, and challenged Dobson to produce, in\
    \ the real world rather than from the skewed universe inside his skull, a jug\
    \ sealed with a cap. Characteristically, the pamphleteer tried to shirk this by\
    \ muttering some nonsense about his urgent need to examine a nest of stints in\
    \ a shrubbery over by the pond. Why on earth he persisted in his lifelong delusion\
    \ that ornithology could rescue him from any pickle he found himself in is a question\
    \ for wiser heads than mine. Marigold Chew made short shrift of his stinty babblings,\
    \ of course, and Dobson was left with no choice but to head off to Hubermann's\
    \ in the hope that somewhere on the shelves of that unutterably gorgeous department\
    \ store he might pounce upon a capped jug.\nAnd therein lies the strangeness of\
    \ this tale. For as he approached the plaza where Hubermann's loomed enormous,\
    \ he found the building enshrouded in a weird mauve mist, like the purple cloud\
    \ in M P Shiel's novel of that title, and he wandered into the mist, and through\
    \ the doors of Hubermann's, and there in the foyer he came upon a tottering tower\
    \ of jugs, all with screw-top caps, and all filled to the brim with paraffin,\
    \ and he was convulsed by a desire to toss a lighted match upon them, and to pass\
    \ an entertaining time watching the blaze, just as he had described in his yet-to-be-typeset\
    \ pamphlet. But as he reached into his pocket for a box of lucifers, he was felled\
    \ by an eagle-eyed Hubermann's security guard, a titanic monster of a man whose\
    \ epaulettes glistened in the mist and whose buttons glistened in the mist even\
    \ more than his epaulettes so glistened. And Dobson was kept under lock and key\
    \ in a broom cupboard in the basement of the department store until bailed by\
    \ an eerie, cadaverous magistrate who roved the land on horseback, following the\
    \ mauve mist wherever it settled.\nHome again, fuddled and with mysterious mauve\
    \ stainage upon his clothing, the pamphleteer told his tale to Marigold Chew,\
    \ who, despite raising a skeptical eyebrow, skipped at once to her shed and cranked\
    \ out Dobson's pamphlet with the text as Dobson wanted it, the world once again\
    \ cast from the mould his words had made."
