  text: 'How right I was to predict that the Beecam would derail my harebrained scheme
    to make Hooting Yard a daily blog! Here is what happened yesterday:

    5.15 AM : Leap out of bed and plump myself in front of the beecam. Become enthralled.

    7.24 AM : Consider basic needs, such as washing and dressing and eating a hearty
    breakfast of kedgeree and bloaters and smokers'' poptarts, but am so overwhelmed
    by the beecam that I postpone any activity.

    11.45 AM : Bee-haunted.

    3.00 PM : Numb to the human world. Beginning to think like a bee. Making occasional
    buzzing noises.

    3.14 PM : Nip away from the beecam momentarily to don yellow-and-black striped
    leotard and black hat with antennae.

    7.52 PM : Recall that I planned to write something daily for the Hooting Yard
    page. Am too transfixed by the beecam to move.

    11.35 PM : Realise that I have spent the entire day observing either bees or the
    absence of bees on the beecam. Suffused with a warm glow of bee-ness. Continue
    to watch bees with now bleary eyes. Make a mental note to explain to readers that
    "bleary-eyed" has nothing to do with terrifying diminutive MP Hazel Blears.

    1.07 AM : Drag myself reluctantly from beecam to bed. As I fall asleep, reflect
    upon the fact that I have never had so bee-centred a day as the day just gone.
    Resolve to be even more bee-minded in future.'
