  text: 'Blodgett decided he wanted to live in a Schloss, so he did the sensible thing
    and went to an estate agent who specialised in Schlosses, or Schlossen.

    "What I''m looking for," he demanded in his demanding way, "Is somewhere bleak
    and forbidding and inaccessible except by a vertiginous and unreliable funitel
    or gondola lift. If you have seen the film Where Eagles Dare, directed by Brian
    G Hutton and released in 1968, you will have a good idea of what I am talking
    about, O estate agent."

    "That is not a film I have seen," replied the estate agent, an impossibly youthful
    and pimply person who was terrified of Blodgett for reasons he was as yet only
    dimly aware of. "I am not much of a cinemagoer at all," he continued, "For I prefer
    to spend my leisure hours at the circus."

    Blodgett had strong views on circuses, but so intent was he on viewing at least
    a couple of Schlossen with a view to purchasing one of them that he decided not
    to berate the estate agent just yet.

    "A pox upon circuses!" was all he said, and then asked the pimply person if there
    were any suitable Schlossen on his books, at which point he was handed a big fat
    leather-bound Schlossen brochure and invited to thumb through it, which he did,
    for about fifteen minutes, occasionally making strange explosive noises and thumping
    his fist on the estate agent''s desk.

    Outside, birds landed on the branch of a tree and began to squawk and sing.

    The pimpled youth was growing increasingly nervous of Blodgett, so he reached
    into his drawer for a can of pepper-spray. He had only used it once, to disable
    a ruffian bent on criminality, on a Wednesday morning. Now it was Wednesday morning
    again and he was faced with this bad-tempered giant of a man in a Homburg hat
    and unseasonal galoshes who was perhaps using Schloss-purchase as a blind for
    some evil deed, though what that deed might be the estate agent did not yet know.

    In truth, Blodgett was perfectly serious in his intention to buy a Schloss, although
    he had not worked out how in the name of heaven he was going to pay for it. That
    was why he wanted it to be bleak and forbidding and inaccessible except by a vertiginous
    and unreliable funitel or gondola lift, for then, once inside, for a viewing,
    he would simply stay put and pull up his ramparts, and defend himself against
    any bailiffs or law officers by pelting them with burning rags. It was not that
    he did not intend to pay the full Schloss-purchase price eventually, for at heart
    he was an honest man, but he wanted to be in his Schloss while devising a money-making
    scheme which would allow him to pay for it. Meanwhile, as he gazed at the pages
    of the Schloss-brochure with greedy eyes, he continued to thump his fist on the
    desk, because that is the sort of man he was.

    Outside, the tree on the branches of which little birds squawked and sang was
    being chopped down by an inept municipal tree-chopping man. Not only was he chopping
    down the wrong tree, but the direction of his chopping meant that when it fell
    it fell slap bang into the Schloss-specialist estate agency. And it fell, smashing
    the glass frontage, at precisely the moment that the pimply youth, unnerved by
    yet another thump of Blodgett''s fist upon his desk, pointed the pepper-spray
    at Blodgett''s face and sprayed him. At which point, also, one of the thicker
    branches of the tree, falling, landed with a mighty bash upon the youth''s head,
    braining him into a daze.

    The birds had flown away to the branches of another tree, and were squawking and
    singing still.

    Thus it was that Blodgett ended up at a clinic to have the pepper-spray rinsed
    out of his eyes, while the estate agent lay in a bed elsewhere in the same clinic
    having his brain examined. It is hardly surprising, then, that Blodgett failed
    to buy a bleak and forbidding Schloss, one inaccessible except by a vertiginous
    and unreliable funitel or gondola lift, on that Wednesday morning loud with birdsong
    and squawk.'
