  text: "Blodgett decided he wanted to live in a Schloss, so he did the sensible thing\
    \ and went to an estate agent who specialised in Schlosses, or Schlossen.\n\u201C\
    What I'm looking for,\u201D he demanded in his demanding way, \u201CIs somewhere\
    \ bleak and forbidding and inaccessible except by a vertiginous and unreliable\
    \ funitel or gondola lift. If you have seen the film Where Eagles Dare, directed\
    \ by Brian G Hutton and released in 1968, you will have a good idea of what I\
    \ am talking about, O estate agent.\u201D\n\u201CThat is not a film I have seen,\u201D\
    \ replied the estate agent, an impossibly youthful and pimply person who was terrified\
    \ of Blodgett for reasons he was as yet only dimly aware of. \u201CI am not much\
    \ of a cinemagoer at all,\u201D he continued, \u201CFor I prefer to spend my leisure\
    \ hours at the circus.\u201D\nBlodgett had strong views on circuses, but so intent\
    \ was he on viewing at least a couple of Schlossen with a view to purchasing one\
    \ of them that he decided not to berate the estate agent just yet.\n\u201CA pox\
    \ upon circuses!\u201D was all he said, and then asked the pimply person if there\
    \ were any suitable Schlossen on his books, at which point he was handed a big\
    \ fat leather-bound Schlossen brochure and invited to thumb through it, which\
    \ he did, for about fifteen minutes, occasionally making strange explosive noises\
    \ and thumping his fist on the estate agent's desk.\nOutside, birds landed on\
    \ the branch of a tree and began to squawk and sing.\nThe pimpled youth was growing\
    \ increasingly nervous of Blodgett, so he reached into his drawer for a can of\
    \ pepper-spray. He had only used it once, to disable a ruffian bent on criminality,\
    \ on a Wednesday morning. Now it was Wednesday morning again and he was faced\
    \ with this bad-tempered giant of a man in a Homburg hat and unseasonal galoshes\
    \ who was perhaps using Schloss-purchase as a blind for some evil deed, though\
    \ what that deed might be the estate agent did not yet know.\nIn truth, Blodgett\
    \ was perfectly serious in his intention to buy a Schloss, although he had not\
    \ worked out how in the name of heaven he was going to pay for it. That was why\
    \ he wanted it to be bleak and forbidding and inaccessible except by a vertiginous\
    \ and unreliable funitel or gondola lift, for then, once inside, for a viewing,\
    \ he would simply stay put and pull up his ramparts, and defend himself against\
    \ any bailiffs or law officers by pelting them with burning rags. It was not that\
    \ he did not intend to pay the full Schloss-purchase price eventually, for at\
    \ heart he was an honest man, but he wanted to be in his Schloss while devising\
    \ a money-making scheme which would allow him to pay for it. Meanwhile, as he\
    \ gazed at the pages of the Schloss-brochure with greedy eyes, he continued to\
    \ thump his fist on the desk, because that is the sort of man he was.\nOutside,\
    \ the tree on the branches of which little birds squawked and sang was being chopped\
    \ down by an inept municipal tree-chopping man. Not only was he chopping down\
    \ the wrong tree, but the direction of his chopping meant that when it fell it\
    \ fell slap bang into the Schloss-specialist estate agency. And it fell, smashing\
    \ the glass frontage, at precisely the moment that the pimply youth, unnerved\
    \ by yet another thump of Blodgett's fist upon his desk, pointed the pepper-spray\
    \ at Blodgett's face and sprayed him. At which point, also, one of the thicker\
    \ branches of the tree, falling, landed with a mighty bash upon the youth's head,\
    \ braining him into a daze.\nThe birds had flown away to the branches of another\
    \ tree, and were squawking and singing still.\nThus it was that Blodgett ended\
    \ up at a clinic to have the pepper-spray rinsed out of his eyes, while the estate\
    \ agent lay in a bed elsewhere in the same clinic having his brain examined. It\
    \ is hardly surprising, then, that Blodgett failed to buy a bleak and forbidding\
    \ Schloss, one inaccessible except by a vertiginous and unreliable funitel or\
    \ gondola lift, on that Wednesday morning loud with birdsong and squawk."
