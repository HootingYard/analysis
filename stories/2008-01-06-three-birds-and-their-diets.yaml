  text: 'Plovers eat the wind.

    Turtle-doves eat juniper seeds and sweet-smelling herbs.

    Larks eat only pebbles and sand.

    From Le Menagier De Paris (1393), cited in the Oddities section of the excellent
    Medieval Cookery website.

    NOTE : Though let us not forget that, as Christopher Smart reminds us in Jubilate
    Agno, "For mustard is the proper food of birds".'
