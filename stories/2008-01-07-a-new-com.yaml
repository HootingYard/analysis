  text: "One might think we had enough coms to be going on with. We already have sitcoms\
    \ and romcoms and divcoms and dotcoms\u2014respectively, situation comedies, romantic\
    \ comedies, The Divine Comedy by Dante, and comedies about dotterels, the small\
    \ wading bird of the plover family which breeds in the arctic tundra. So it might\
    \ be argued that yet another com is a com too many. Normally, I would agree, were\
    \ it not that the latest com is the frackcom, a series of comedies about Old Farmer\
    \ Frack. As these are chiefly written by the bestselling paperback author Pebblehead\
    \ I suppose they might equally well be called pebcoms. No doubt one or other term\
    \ will win out as the common usage, much as we say \u201Cping pong\u201D rather\
    \ than \u201Cgossima\u201D, and \u201Clawn tennis\u201D rather than \u201Csphairistike\u201D\
    .\nIt could be argued that there is little humour to be found in the perpetual\
    \ trudgings of a mad old farmer driving his bellowing cows from field to field,\
    \ pointlessly, in all weathers, through all the hours god sends. In fact, that\
    \ is a view I have myself favoured, as explicated thoroughly in my six-part television\
    \ series Penitence And Farm Implements, which insists that farmyard life is miserable\
    \ and grim and despondent and hateful and wretched and disgusting and absolutely\
    \ without comic possibility. But I reckoned without the skills of Pebblehead,\
    \ whose hilarious accounts of Old Farmer Frack driving his bellowing cows from\
    \ field to field, pointlessly, have me slapping my sides and gasping for breath.\n\
    The original books, of course, are known as farmyardlit, and it is the films and\
    \ TV series based upon them that are called frackcoms or pebcoms. It is important\
    \ to get this terminology right."
