  text: 'In the post, a very nice letter from Brooklyn poet Gregory Vincent St Thomasino
    responding to the recording of Jubilate Agno:

    Dear Frank,

    Once again I thank you for bringing this reading/recording to my attention. It
    is simply extraordinary. It is excellent, it is historical. And if I may, I think
    it is remarkable the having a female voice in the response, this makes the listening
    easier, never monotonous (never wearisome!). The voices compliment and complement
    each other. Smart is my affinity, my kin. He is encyclopaedic. I sense so deeply
    his sense of isolation, I am so deeply moved by his sense of isolation and frustration.
    At the 1:56 time there begins the part "For I Will Consider My Cat Jeoffry" and
    at that pont I followed along in my text. This complete reading of Jubilate Agno
    has not only been a pleasure and an education for me, it has been an episode.

    Yours sincerely,

    Gregory

    The letter has also been posted on Mr St Thomasino''s e-ratio postmodern poetry
    blog, where you will find a link to his own Elegy For Christopher Smart amid much
    else.'
