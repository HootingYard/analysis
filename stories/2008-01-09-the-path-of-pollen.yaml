  text: "Mr Key wishes to announce that henceforth he will be following the Path of\
    \ Pollen. As you may already know, this Path is an important and ancient tradition\
    \ of bee shamanism. Like Naomi Lewis, I will be bounding out of bed at dawn and\
    \ doing the lemniscatic walk. It looks like walking in a figure of eight. When\
    \ bees come back from foraging, they do this to tell the hive where the best nectar\
    \ is, and so on. The walk is seen to give one access to infinite knowledge and\
    \ vitality.\nYou might wonder what precisely is implied by that \u201Cand so on\u201D\
    , as if there is some kind of fluffy vagueness about the Path of Pollen, but I\
    \ can assure you this is not so. I am confident that, as infinite knowledge and\
    \ vitality begin to suffuse every last chink of Hooting Yard, you, as readers,\
    \ will be thankful that bee shamanism is being practised here, and you may indeed\
    \ take up lemniscatic walking yourselves.\nIncidentally, I have been asked a number\
    \ of times over the years if Joost Van Dongelbraacke, the suburban shaman, was\
    \ in fact a suburban bee shaman, but I am afraid my researches to date have thrown\
    \ only a very pale light on the matter. While some authorities claim that he shed\
    \ bits of beeswax as he roamed his shamanic suburb, others counter that they were\
    \ simply bits of earwax falling from his admittedly rather grubby head. I do not\
    \ yet know enough to pronounce on the question, for I have only been following\
    \ the Path of Pollen since this morning, and so my knowledge is not yet infinite.\
    \ I am hoping it will be so by about Thursday week."
