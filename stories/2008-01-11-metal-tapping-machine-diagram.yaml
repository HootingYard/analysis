  text: 'Meanwhile, somewhere in the Antipodes, longstanding Hooting Yard rapporteur
    Glyn Webster has devised a diagram showing the development of the modern metal
    tapping machine. It should be noted that the metal tapping machines occasionally
    mentioned in these pages bear greater resemblance to the one in the top left corner
    than to the one at bottom right. Click on the picture for a larger image.
