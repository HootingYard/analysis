  text: "My readers in the United States will owe a debt of gratitude to Cabinet Of\
    \ Wonders for bringing to our attention this map of roadside attractions, eccentric\
    \ museums, and other delights. If you are planning a day out, why not visit the\
    \ Unclaimed Baggage Centre in Alabama, or the Brothel Art Museum in Nevada, or\
    \ indeed the Harold Warp Pioneer Village in Nebraska? Personally, I am rather\
    \ taken with the Field Of Giant Corn Ears in Ohio. Readers\u2019 reports from\
    \ their travels are most welcome, so do keep me informed if you happen upon any\
    \ of these magnificent attractions."
