  text: 'You can now read Gilbert White''s The Natural History Of Selborne as a daily
    blog, so I recommend that you do so. One of my favourite items in the Hooting
    Yard library is a 1946 book entitled The Portrait Of A Tortoise : Extracted From
    The Journals And Letters Of Gilbert White, edited by the great Sylvia Townsend
    Warner. She went through the Journals and simply extracted all the references
    to Mrs Snooke''s tortoise Timothy, from 1st November 1771 ("Mrs Snooke''s tortoise
    begins to scrape an hole in the ground in order for laying up") to 1st June 1793
    ("Timothy is very voracious : when he can get no other food he eats grass in the
    walks"). Perhaps, after Jubilate Agno, I may read this on the radio next time
    there is a special edition of Hooting Yard On The Air.'
