  text: "OutaSpaceman dropped me a line to point out that I failed to observe the\
    \ feast day of St Mungo last Monday, 14th January. Remiss of me, I know. To make\
    \ up for such an inexplicable oversight, let me draw your attention to St Prisca,\
    \ whose feast day is today.\n\n \nSt Prisca was a child martyr, and you can read\
    \ all about her in The Book Of Saints And Friendly Beasts by Abbie Farwell Brown.\
    \ You will learn how, \"Small and defenceless though she was, she did not fear\
    \ to tell everyone what she believed and Whose Cross she followed. So she soon\
    \ became known as a firm little Christian maiden.\" When you have read this stirring\
    \ tale, and wept, yet felt strangely uplifted, I recommend some of the other stories\
    \ you will find there, such as Saint Keneth [sic] Of The Gulls, Saint Launomar's\
    \ Cow, Saint Fronto's Camels, and Saint Werburgh And Her Goose. That should be\
    \ quite enough saints to keep you occupied and out of mischief.\nNOTE : It strikes\
    \ me that St Prisca comes across as a Christian version of heroic infant Tiny\
    \ Enid, many of whose exploits have been recorded here. I am not aware to what,\
    \ if any, religious persuasion Tiny Enid adhered, but I shall do some research\
    \ and let readers know in due course."
