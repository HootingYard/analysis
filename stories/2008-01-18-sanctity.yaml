  text: 'OutaSpaceman dropped me a line to point out that I failed to observe the
    feast day of St Mungo last Monday, 14th January. Remiss of me, I know. To make
    up for such an inexplicable oversight, let me draw your attention to St Prisca,
    whose feast day is today.



    St Prisca was a child martyr, and you can read all about her in The Book Of Saints
    And Friendly Beasts by Abbie Farwell Brown. You will learn how, "Small and defenceless
    though she was, she did not fear to tell everyone what she believed and Whose
    Cross she followed. So she soon became known as a firm little Christian maiden."
    When you have read this stirring tale, and wept, yet felt strangely uplifted,
    I recommend some of the other stories you will find there, such as Saint Keneth
    [sic] Of The Gulls, Saint Launomar''s Cow, Saint Fronto''s Camels, and Saint Werburgh
    And Her Goose. That should be quite enough saints to keep you occupied and out
    of mischief.

    NOTE : It strikes me that St Prisca comes across as a Christian version of heroic
    infant Tiny Enid, many of whose exploits have been recorded here. I am not aware
    to what, if any, religious persuasion Tiny Enid adhered, but I shall do some research
    and let readers know in due course.'
