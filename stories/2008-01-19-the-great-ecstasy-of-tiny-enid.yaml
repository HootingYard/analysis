  text: 'Like Kaspar Hauser, she was an enigma. Like Petra Von Kant, she wept bitter
    tears. And like Woodcarver Steiner, she knew great ecstasy. But was it a religious
    ecstasy, or was it, as for Woodcarver Steiner, related to ski-jumping at championship
    level?

    Had she been so inclined, there is no doubt that Tiny Enid could have been a top
    skier in spite of her club foot, for we know that she never allowed that infirmity
    to dissuade her from the most remarkable exploits. Hang-gliding, hot air ballooning,
    pole-vaulting and daring undersea rescues were among her many accomplishments,
    and she was only narrowly pipped to the post in a vinkensport contest when her
    finch, Edgar, became rattled and chirped susk-e-wiat instead of susk-e-wiet in
    the final minutes. Yet we have no evidence that Tiny Enid ever strapped on a pair
    of skis, nor dwelt in an area of snow fallen on sloping ground.

    Equally, however, if hers was a religious ecstasy, we are hard put to identify
    to what brand of supernatural belief it could be ascribed. Those who knew Tiny
    Enid crinkle in glee as they recall that, like Benjamin Peret, she spat at Catholic
    priests, so I think we can rule out the Ratzingeristas, as we can confidently
    dismiss any connection to Aztec fundamentalism, given Tiny Enid''s reported remarks
    on Temaxcaltechi, the goddess of sweatbaths, whom she described as "far too sweaty".
    This is not the place to examine Tiny Enid''s somewhat unseemly preoccupation
    with both human and divine sweat, for we must keep on track.

    That track is the one we hope would lead us to know the source of Tiny Enid''s
    great ecstasy. With Woodcarver Steiner we know where we stand, as we do with Saint
    Teresa of Avila and any number of visionary enthusiasts and mystics through the
    ages. But what can we say of the great ecstasy of Tiny Enid except that it remains
    a puzzle? We know she experienced such ecstasy, for we have the mezzotints, done
    from the life, by the mezzotintist Rex Tint, which depict Tiny Enid in great transports
    of joy. It is true, as Rex Tint''s sister Dot Tint pointed out, that in many of
    these mezzotints Tiny Enid could more accurately be described as chuckling or
    giggling in a childish way at slapstick scenes of pratfalls and larkabout, rather
    than convulsed in spiritual ecstasy. But let us not forget that in one of the
    most well-known of the mezzotints Tiny Enid is shown so convulsed, standing next
    to a clown with unmistakeable beads of sweat upon his brow and great patches of
    perspiration visible under the arms of his clown costume as he reaches up to flap
    his beclowngloved hands in some sort of funny business. Tiny Enid would never
    have laughed at a clown, sweaty or not, for she feared them as she feared nothing
    else on earth, ever.

    Trawling through the various biographical documents which survive, I have found
    no indication that Tiny Enid ever professed any religious impulses whatsoever,
    nor, for that matter, any more broadly spiritual leanings. Indeed, all accounts
    agree that she was a severely practical type of heroic infant, never more essentially
    herself than when solving very concrete problems, usually involving the rescue
    of persons imperilled. One thinks, for example, of Tiny Enid abseiling down a
    crevasse to deliver a life-saving polythene bag of nutritious bread pudding to
    the half-starved, half-frozen polar explorer Sir Blinky Cheeselip, or digging
    a tunnel under the Vindervandersee to reach a trio of extras from a Werner Herzog
    film trapped in a subterranean pool rife with blind albino aquatic tentacled beings
    each with thousands of razor sharp fangs and unassuageable appetites. One pictures
    Tiny Enid kicking a git in the head with her big black boot.

    Perhaps, we must ask, it was her reveries of such deeds which sent her into her
    great ecstasies? We ask, but for the time being we cannot answer "yes" with any
    great conviction, not until much further work has been done to disentangle the
    hugely complicated legacy Tiny Enid left in her heroic, infantile wake.'
