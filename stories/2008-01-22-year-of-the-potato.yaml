  text: I ought to have mentioned this earlier, but better late than never. 2008 is
    the International Year Of The Potato. So whether you champion Accords or Belle
    de Fontenays or Caras or Carlingfords or Charlottes or Desirees or Duke of Yorks
    or Dundrods or Estimas or Fiannas or Golden Wonders or Harmonies or Kerr's Pinks
    or King Edwards or Marfonas or Maris Bards or Maris Peers or Maris Pipers or Nadines
    or Nicolas or Ospreys or Pentland Javelins or Pink Fir Apples or Premieres or
    Rockets or Romanos or Roosters or Santes or Saxons or Vivaldis or Wiljas, be sure
    to devote much of your time and energy this year to potato-related activities.
    Hooting Yard will be getting into the groove with a series of potato-postings
    as the months go by, so keep your eyes peeled.
