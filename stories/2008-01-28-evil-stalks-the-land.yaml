  text: It is easy to laugh at the English judiciary, with all those bewigged judges
    who seemingly know nothing of the wider world outside their chambers. But they
    know how to turn a phrase, those judges. With Nicholas Van Hoogstraten back in
    the news, it is worth recalling that many years ago he was described in court
    as "a self-styled emissary of Beelzebub". I wouldn't be surprised if he's used
    that phrase ever since when filling in his "Occupation" on documents.
