text: "It is easy to laugh at the English judiciary, with all those bewigged judges\
  \ who seemingly know nothing of the wider world outside their chambers. But they\
  \ know how to turn a phrase, those judges. With Nicholas Van Hoogstraten back in\
  \ the news, it is worth recalling that many years ago he was described in court\
  \ as \u201Ca self-styled emissary of Beelzebub\u201D. I wouldn't be surprised if\
  \ he's used that phrase ever since when filling in his \u201COccupation\u201D on\
  \ documents."
