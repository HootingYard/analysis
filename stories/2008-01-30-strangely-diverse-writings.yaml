  text: "\u201CPeople who are only aware of Jabir (or Geber as he was known in the\
    \ medieval West) as the name of an early scientist, may not be aware of what richly\
    \ bizarre treasures are to be found in his strangely diverse writings: sperm is\
    \ a crucial ingredient in the elixir of life; bird sperm is needed for producing\
    \ a man with wings; the effigy of a Chinaman in bed will keep one awake at night;\
    \ a picture of a man killing snakes done in magical ink will actually kill snakes;\
    \ there is a fish called \u201Cthe doctor of the sea\u201D that carries a stone\
    \ in its head that has the power to cure all ills; putrefied hair generates serpents;\
    \ demons can be usefully trapped in statues. In the monumental Jabir ibn Hayyan:\
    \ Contribution \xE0 l'histoire des id\xE9es scientifiques dans l'Islam, Paul Kraus\
    \ (1904\u201344), a genius who committed suicide at an early age, surveyed the\
    \ Jabirian corpus, which covered sexology, alchemy, the art of warfare, the manufacture\
    \ of talismans, artisanal techniques, religious polemic, grammar, music, invisible\
    \ inks, the artificial generation of human beings and much else.\u201D\nFrom this\
    \ book review."
