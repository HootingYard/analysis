  text: '"People who are only aware of Jabir (or Geber as he was known in the medieval
    West) as the name of an early scientist, may not be aware of what richly bizarre
    treasures are to be found in his strangely diverse writings: sperm is a crucial
    ingredient in the elixir of life; bird sperm is needed for producing a man with
    wings; the effigy of a Chinaman in bed will keep one awake at night; a picture
    of a man killing snakes done in magical ink will actually kill snakes; there is
    a fish called "the doctor of the sea" that carries a stone in its head that has
    the power to cure all ills; putrefied hair generates serpents; demons can be usefully
    trapped in statues. In the monumental Jabir ibn Hayyan: Contribution a l''histoire
    des idees scientifiques dans l''Islam, Paul Kraus (1904-44), a genius who committed
    suicide at an early age, surveyed the Jabirian corpus, which covered sexology,
    alchemy, the art of warfare, the manufacture of talismans, artisanal techniques,
    religious polemic, grammar, music, invisible inks, the artificial generation of
    human beings and much else."
