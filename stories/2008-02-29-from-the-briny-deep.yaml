  text: "From across the Atlantic, Hooting Yard podcast listener and aquatic ecologist\
    \ Darell Slotton writes with important news from the briny deep:\nHagfish are\
    \ spectacularly disgusting, being sea bottom, naked-looking, smooth, pink eels\
    \ with a battery of dodgy looking tendrils around the mouth. They burrow enthusiastically\
    \ into and through carcasses that fall to the bottom, until they are hollowed\
    \ out. The sight of a carcass bulging frenetically in the dim undersea light,\
    \ with a dozen of these lovelies inside, is... something. On top of that, if you\
    \ keep hagfish in an aquarium and reach in to pick them up, they instantly exude\
    \ a chemical that mixes with seawater to produce a huge ball of snot all around\
    \ them, which you are left holding as they slip away.\n\n \nHagfish diagram from\
    \ Bigelow and Schroeder, 1948, p. 34."
