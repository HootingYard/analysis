  text: 'Last week, the Guardian newspaper was giving away a seies of poetry pamphlets.
    There were selections from T S Eliot, Sylvia Plath, and Philip Larkin, among others,
    but I was dismayed to note that they did not include Dennis Beerpint.

    The twee versifier has been rather quiet of late, so I was pleased to learn that
    a new book is in the works. For the last year, apparently, Beerpint has been busy
    with a project entitled Imperfectly-Remembered Mitteleuropean Folk Songs In Translation.
    He has collected at least four or five examples, enough for a characteristically
    slim volume of verse.

    Under cover of darkness, Pansy Cradledew smashed her way into Beerpint''s so-called
    "poetry hut" and managed to steal Gestetnered copies of a couple of the pieces,
    so we can give readers a sneak preview. The first is called "The Shepherd''s Lament":

    There is a shepherd in the hills / There is a [something] green / But black is
    the crow in the [something] tree / And lightning blasts the sky / The shepherd''s
    lass has golden hair / She [something something] milk / But the crow has flown
    away, my love / And the ducks have left the lake.

    Marvellous. And here is the second one, which seems to be untitled:

    As I roamed the bosky verdance / Upon a summer morning / [Something something]
    gravel pits / And O my love was [something]. / Entwined in posies [something something]
    / I heard the sound of gunfire / Then [something] over by the cowshed / Upon a
    summer morning. / Tra la la and fol de rol / The geese are all a-[something] /
    My pig has got his hat on / And I''ll see you in the gloaming.

    Fantastic. I expect the editor of the Guardian will be kicking himself that he
    neglected to include Dennis Beerpint in the series.'
