  text: "Last week, the Guardian newspaper was giving away a seies of poetry pamphlets.\
    \ There were selections from T S Eliot, Sylvia Plath, and Philip Larkin, among\
    \ others, but I was dismayed to note that they did not include Dennis Beerpint.\n\
    The twee versifier has been rather quiet of late, so I was pleased to learn that\
    \ a new book is in the works. For the last year, apparently, Beerpint has been\
    \ busy with a project entitled Imperfectly-Remembered Mitteleuropean Folk Songs\
    \ In Translation. He has collected at least four or five examples, enough for\
    \ a characteristically slim volume of verse.\nUnder cover of darkness, Pansy Cradledew\
    \ smashed her way into Beerpint's so-called \u201Cpoetry hut\u201D and managed\
    \ to steal Gestetnered copies of a couple of the pieces, so we can give readers\
    \ a sneak preview. The first is called \u201CThe Shepherd's Lament\u201D:\nThere\
    \ is a shepherd in the hills / There is a [something] green / But black is the\
    \ crow in the [something] tree / And lightning blasts the sky / The shepherd's\
    \ lass has golden hair / She [something something] milk / But the crow has flown\
    \ away, my love / And the ducks have left the lake.\nMarvellous. And here is the\
    \ second one, which seems to be untitled:\nAs I roamed the bosky verdance / Upon\
    \ a summer morning / [Something something] gravel pits / And O my love was [something].\
    \ / Entwined in posies [something something] / I heard the sound of gunfire /\
    \ Then [something] over by the cowshed / Upon a summer morning. / Tra la la and\
    \ fol de rol / The geese are all a-[something] / My pig has got his hat on / And\
    \ I'll see you in the gloaming.\nFantastic. I expect the editor of the Guardian\
    \ will be kicking himself that he neglected to include Dennis Beerpint in the\
    \ series."
