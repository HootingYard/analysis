  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, Please look very carefully at the attached
    photograph. I have been staring at it constantly for about five hours, and I have
    convinced myself that the person we see here depicted is the out of print pamphleteer
    Dobson. You may wish to assert that a) the image is not a photograph and b) Dobson
    would never have allowed himself to be caught on camera while so preposterously
    engarbed. You are of course fully entitled to express such objections, but bear
    in mind that I am a man of mighty optical acuity and I know what I am talking
    about. Call me a deluded idiot if you must. I am now going to go on an Easter
    picnic event. Yours sincerely, Tim.
