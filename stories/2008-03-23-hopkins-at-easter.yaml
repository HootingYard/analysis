  text: 'Some Gerard Manley Hopkins for Easter. Here is the final stanza of The Wreck
    Of The Deutschland:

    Dame, at our door

    Drowned, and among our shoals,

    Remember us in the roads, the heaven-haven of the Reward:

    Our King back, oh, upon English souls!

    Let him easter in us, be a dayspring to the dimness of us, be a crimson-cresseted
    east,

    More brightening her, rare-dear Britain, as his reign rolls,

    Pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-priest,

    Our hearts'' charity''s hearth''s fire, our thoughts'' chivalry''s throng''s Lord.'
