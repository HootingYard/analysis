  text: "Bristow, Cuddy and I were out on the trail. It pleased me that the shanks\
    \ and withers of my horse were clearly superior to those of my companions\u2019\
    \ horses. Were we to gallop to a gulch I felt sure that I would get there first.\
    \ But we were in no hurry. I was the only one with a working knowledge of the\
    \ importance of vitamins, so I was in charge of our picnic arrangements, as usual.\
    \ My plan was for us to chow down at sunset, further up the trail, once we'd passed\
    \ Binsey Poplars. There ain't no poplars at Binsey, just scrub and tumbleweed,\
    \ but the place is sainted to the memory of Gerard Manley Hopkins, so that's why\
    \ the folk there call it what they do. A lot of those folk are monks who spend\
    \ their days grunting over illuminated manuscripts in the scriptorium, but there's\
    \ a fair smattering of cowpokes and wranglers and ornery cuss-mouthed old biddies\
    \ too. You'd need some kind of vade mecum to keep track of all the shenanigans\
    \ they get up to, and that includes the monks.\nBristow was originally from Finland.\
    \ His real name had lots of double \u2018i's and double \u2018k's in it, it was\
    \ too much of a mouthful, so he was known as Bristow. Back in Helsinki, or Helsingfors,\
    \ he had a wife, name of Theodora, who wallowed in a swamp of moral turpitude.\
    \ She had a way of tilting her head at a particular angle that drove Bristow hobgoblin\
    \ crazy, and that was why he'd left Finnish shores and was beside me now, on his\
    \ horse, heading along the trail. He was so daze-brained that he thought he knew\
    \ more about vitamins than I did, but I had him down as a cornpone and buckwheat\
    \ kind of man, and I was rarely wrong.\nI'd been wrong about Cuddy, true enough.\
    \ Cuddy was a talented countertenor who'd sung a few arias in his time, back east.\
    \ But then he got infected tonsils and suffered all sorts of disasters. He lost\
    \ an eye and some of his bones and could no longer pay the rent on his flophouse\
    \ room, so he hitched a ride on the Big Old Golem Railroad and fetched up on the\
    \ prairie with nothing but a pair of spurs and a bottle of mouthwash. His hair\
    \ was yellow and he had gruesome personal habits, but I gave him a horse and let\
    \ him ride with me. Sometimes a man needs a helping hand.\nCuddy sang as we rode\
    \ along the trail. \u201COh Mama,\u201D he sang, \u201CWhat colour will the lights\
    \ be? Will they turn blue on me?\u201D It was a song that Wacko Jimmy Osterburg\
    \ would record on the phonograph years down the line, but even with his ravaged\
    \ tonsils I always preferred Cuddy's take on it. You could tell he'd once wowed\
    \ the plutocrats at the opera house. But those days were gone, and Cuddy knew\
    \ it. Maybe that's why he never bothered polishing his spurs. My spurs were glistening.\
    \ I had them made specially, from pewter, by a pewter spur maker back in Choctaw\
    \ country. They were fastened to the heels of my Bingle boots. The Bingle company\
    \ makes the sturdiest boots you're ever likely to wear, and I know I'm going to\
    \ die with my Bingle boots on. They're advertised as \u201Cthe boots of destiny\u201D\
    , and even if you have no idea what your destiny will be, they're the boots you'll\
    \ want to be shod in when you meet it.\nIt was hot on the trail. We came to a\
    \ place where to one side of us was a swarm of flies and to the other side was\
    \ a swarm of bees. Cuddy stopped singing, took from his holster his self-loading\
    \ repeater Chabrol Truffaut-Rivette and shot them all dead, one by one.\nThe Mormons\
    \ have a home-made hooch called leopard sweat. You can look that up if you don't\
    \ believe me. I'm no kind of saint, let alone a Latter Day one, but I had a flask\
    \ of the firewater in my pochette. The hooch was a gift from a Mormon prophet\
    \ we'd met yesterday. He was out in what he called the wilderness and had got\
    \ himself hopelessly entangled in a thorn bush. Bristow and Cuddy wanted to rob\
    \ him and taunt him with rattlesnakes, but I advised mercy, and I was listened\
    \ to, so we rescued him from the thicket and got a flaskful of leopard sweat as\
    \ a result. I was damned if I was going to share it with my companeros. They could\
    \ make do with their own spit. The pochette, by the way, was a delicately embroidered\
    \ reticule made for me by a good time girl name of Maud from Old Ma Purgative's\
    \ Whorehouse back in Vinegarville. This Maud had a way of tilting her head at\
    \ a particular angle that reminded Bristow of his Helsinki Theodora, so we got\
    \ out of there quick before he got the jeepers. I was keeping a close eye on him,\
    \ and sometimes two eyes, through binoculars, if he strayed too far ahead or dallied\
    \ too far behind. Bristow's horse suffered from sleep apnoea and hysterics, and\
    \ he sat askew on his saddle, so that was causing us no end of problems.\nWe were\
    \ still hours away from Binsey Poplars when the trail was blocked by an incomprehensible\
    \ and gigantic and hard and rectangular and monolithic slab of pure black iron.\
    \ It was so huge that we were engulfed in its shadow long before we reached it.\
    \ Bristow's horse shook with terror and Cuddy's horse went all wobbly. My own\
    \ horse, with its superior withers and shanks, trotted bravely towards the slab,\
    \ but it was obvious there was no way to pass it. I tapped at the metal with a\
    \ tuning fork and out rang a tone at once sweet and sinister. I thought the sound\
    \ might prompt Cuddy to sing again, but he was busy chewing a prune.\nFatefully,\
    \ but of necessity, we left the trail, detouring off into unknown country and\
    \ hoping to rejoin it beyond Stovepipe Hat Gulch. Before we got that far, though,\
    \ we came to a cluster of ruined and rotting shacks. The horses were thirsty,\
    \ so we dismounted and took them to a burbling rivulet. As we did so, a group\
    \ of people emerged from the shacks. There were men, women, and children, all\
    \ of them slobbering inbred halfwits and all of them armed with Mannlicher Carcano\
    \ rifles. This, you will recall, was the cheap mail order firearm later to be\
    \ used by Lee Harvey Oswald to shoot President Kennedy in November \u201963. I\
    \ could see Cuddy reaching for his gun so I socked him on the jaw, knocking him\
    \ to the ground. I wanted, if I could, to avoid a shootout.\nThe leader of the\
    \ slobbering inbred halfwits came towards me. His stride was uncertain and spavined,\
    \ and as he got closer I saw that his eyes were milky and sightless. Then he tilted\
    \ his head at a particular angle and, behind me, Bristow let out a horrible scream.\
    \ I turned and saw that he was aiming his Balzac at the halfwit, but he was shaking\
    \ too much to be able to make a steady shot. I ran back and knocked the revolver\
    \ from his paw.\nIf you read the literature, you will find that cowboys often\
    \ found themselves in predicaments. Such predicaments may differ in circumstance\
    \ and detail from those you face in your everyday, contemporary lives, but you\
    \ are still able to place yourselves, through an imaginative leap, in predicaments\
    \ distant in time and place. So let us briefly exchange places, you and I. I will\
    \ leave you with Bristow and Cuddy, the one gibbering at the memory of his Theodora\
    \ and the other unconscious, while you are set upon by armed and slobbering inbred\
    \ halfwits in a hot and hostile desert landscape away from the trail, and I shall\
    \ sit on a bendy bus slewing through rainy windswept streets, bearing me god knows\
    \ where, and god knows why."
