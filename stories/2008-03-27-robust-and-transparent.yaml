  text: It is ever more apparent that Hooting Yard needs to be both robust and transparent.
    I want to move the debate forward, and that is why I am making arrangements for
    someone--possibly the octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins--to clamber up a ladder on
    to the roof of a large and imposing building and to shout, through a loudhailer,
    a robust and transparent message. The message will be shouted in a transparently
    robust manner, from behind a transparent screen, made of robust glass. It's a
    big ask, but I think it's important to begin the conversation. One benefit of
    such robust transparency is that we might, as a result, be invited into the government's
    big tent of all the talents. Asked to predict the likelihood of this, our resident
    prognosticator Little Severin The Mystic Badger scrabbled around in a pile of
    twigs and muck and came to no definite conclusion. Perhaps he is insufficiently
    robust. Nor, of course, is he transparent, being a badger.
