  text: 'Dear Mr Key : I was minding my own business, sitting on my bench in the attic
    room of the Mercy Home For Abandoned Infants Made Of Wood, when my attention was
    drawn to your article entitled Wooden Child And Fiery Serpent And Trees. I should
    at once make it clear that I am a wooden child and that I often run errands along
    the very same lanes of your bailiwick such as the one shown in the picture, and
    that on numerous occasions when running such errands I have been menaced by serpents
    belching forth flame from their mouths or from their fundaments and sometimes,
    terrifyingly, from both.

    Before I go on, you may be interested to know the nature of my errands. From time
    to time, the beadle at the Mercy Home, or one of his lieutenants, will require
    a crate of crab apples or bandages or plums or dust or conference pears or talcum
    powder or grease or vinegar cakes or marzipan or holy water tablets or pins or
    assorted crustacea or similar produce to be collected from the village shop. Being
    the possessor of a withered leg, the beadle himself is not able to undertake the
    journey along the winding lanes, and his lieutenants are kept so busy grouting
    and lathing and scraping and plugging and patching up holes in the fabric of the
    Mercy Home that the task falls to one or another of the abandoned wooden infants
    such as myself. We merrily do the beadle''s bidding, for Old Ma Dystopia, who
    runs the village shop, will usually treat us with a wooden biscuit or a wooden
    toffee apple before getting us to sign the impost for the crate we have come to
    collect. She is a kindly soul who is reputed to be over two hundred years old
    and to have taken part in many folk tales, living as she does in her ramshackle
    shop deep in the dense and gloomy woods. She is certainly a keen observer of the
    disposition of trees.

    What prompted me to write to you was your observation that the wooden tinies you
    rescue from perilous fiery serpents are skittish, and that you are rarely rewarded
    or thanked for your endeavours. Now, it is true enough that I do not recall a
    single occasion when, menaced by a serpent on this or that errand, my imperilment
    has been averted by you, or indeed anyone like you, emerging from the shrubbery
    armed with a portable fire extinguisher. Granted that my memory is not the most
    acute, given that my head and all its innards, including the brain, are, like
    the rest of me, made of wood. Yet I feel quite sure I would remember so stirring
    an incident. As it is, I have always had to effect my own deliverance from the
    threat of fiery serpents upon the lanes, using a combination of quick wits and
    wily stratagems. I am not lucky enough to carry my own fire extinguisher, partly
    because I am, on my return journey at least, laden with a crate of produce and
    thus hard put to carry anything extra, and also because the beadle is reluctant
    to let his tiny wooden charges get their hands on his one fire extinguisher, which
    he keeps bolted to the wall of his office. It is not the case that we are too
    skittish to be entrusted with it, by the way, rather that the beadle is a possessive
    and neurotic man prey to his own secret demons, for which I fervently hope he
    will one day seek professional counselling, or acupuncture, or even just straightforward
    puncturing, with a sharpened skewer.

    My main point is that, if ever there came a time when you did spray your so-called
    exciting fire-suppressant foam into the mouth or the fundament of a fiery serpent
    waylaying me upon the lane, I would certainly be profuse in my thanks and would,
    upon my return to the Mercy Home For Abandoned Infants Made Of Wood, hold urgent
    discussions with the beadle to arrange for you to be properly rewarded, perhaps
    with a lemon meringue pie or a box of paperclips. I am confident that all my wooden
    fellows would do the same. So I can only assume, when you assert that it is rare
    for you to be thanked or rewarded for your efforts, that the wooden children you
    have assisted in the past must hail from some other home for wooden children,
    perhaps one that nestles even deeper in these deep and gloomy woods, a home where
    the wooden children are, God forbid, skittish wooden ingrates.

    I hope you will see fit to publish this letter and thus to set the record straight.

    Passionately yours, A Nameless Wooden Child xxxx'
