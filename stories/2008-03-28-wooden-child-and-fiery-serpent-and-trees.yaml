  text: "\n\_\nIntriguingly, the serpent is belching fire not through its mouth but\
    \ from its fundament. This is more common than you might think. Often, when I\
    \ roam the lanes of my bailiwick, I come upon similar scenes of wooden tinies\
    \ being menaced by fiery serpents, and in a significant number of cases serpentine\
    \ fundament-fire is seen to occur. For the serpent, the advantage of this is that\
    \ when a public-spirited figure such as myself chances upon it and extinguishes\
    \ the flames with a handy portable fire extinguisher, it does not gag or choke\
    \ on the jet of exciting fire-suppressant foam, as invariably happens with mouth-sourced\
    \ serpentine flames, but merely shrugs it off, inasmuch as a serpent can shrug,\
    \ and slithers off on its merry way down the lane. Unfortunately, I have to say\
    \ that the skittish wooden tinies whose imperilment I so selflessly avert tend\
    \ to be an ungrateful lot, and it is rare indeed that I am even thanked, let alone\
    \ given a reward. Nevertheless, I shall not stint in my roamings, along the winding\
    \ lanes of my bailiwick, armed with my fire extinguisher.\nNote the disposition\
    \ of the trees.\nThe picture appears in Monster Brains, to which the reader is\
    \ referred."
