  text: 'In today''s botany lesson we are going to study a stalk of Fufton''s Bladderwort.
    We are going to examine it very very closely with the naked eye, and then under
    a microscope, and then, from an exemplary distance, through a telescope. We shall
    thoroughly sniff it, having first had our nasal passages cleared and fumigated
    with a nasal fumigation siphon-and-pump contraption specially made for us by a
    boffin.

    We are going to test the effect upon it of both extreme heat and extreme cold,
    as well as room temperature and other exemplary temperatures it is likely to encounter
    in what can laughingly still be referred to as the "real world". Thus far I have
    spoken of both distance and temperature as being exemplary and I am not finished
    with my exemplars.

    We are going to attach electrical wires to the stalk of Fufton''s Bladderwort
    and subject it to low and high voltages using a targeted electrical voltage delivery
    contraption specially made for us by a boffin. We shall designate one such voltage
    as an exemplary voltage, for reasons which will become apparent.

    Immersion in a tub of water will be the next step. We will be using water from
    the duckpond, having first boiled it and allowed it to cool. The water will be
    collected from the duckpond in pails, then transferred to a pan. It will be allowed
    to cool in the pan before being poured into the tub through a funnel. Rubber gloves
    will be worn during this procedure. The colour of the rubber gloves worn is open
    to choice, except that they ought not be the same colour as the stalk of Fufton''s
    Bladderwort. A rubber glove pigmentation chart has been specially prepared for
    us by a boffin, and we shall refer to it before plumping for our rubber gloves.

    We will then test the pH value of the stalk of Fufton''s Bladderwort before breaking
    for lunch.

    Lunch will be served in the sixth floor canteen. The prices are reasonable and
    the queues are short. There is a goodly selection of pies, cereals, chunks of
    unidentified meat, oats, barley, thieveries from squirrels'' winter storage, baked
    turnips, cocoa powder, blood oranges, various animal innards, gravy in boats and
    gravy in a spoon, plums, balsamic vinegar, toffee pudding, dentally-challenging
    biscuits and crackers, clam chowder, wafers with a drizzle of light ale, pastries,
    dried citrus husks, blancmange, lemon curd, bog sludge, and aspirins. The sing-song
    will take place immediately after lunch in the sixth floor canteen annexe. Song-sheets
    in a bold, hectoring typeface have been specially prepared for us by a madrigalist.

    Upon our return we will slice up the stalk of Fufton''s Bladderwort with a big
    sharp exemplary slicing implement. There will then be a test paper in multiple-choice
    format, to be completed in pencil. The rubber gloves should be disposed of down
    a chute, the location of which will be announced in due time. Any questions?'
