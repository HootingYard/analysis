  text: There is much in the news these days about the credit crunch, but this should
    not lead us to neglect many other important crunches. I sometimes worry that less
    attention is paid to some crunches because they lack the alliterative quality
    of the credit crunch, which of course makes it a favourite of headline writers
    and broadcasters. Actually, it's not quite true that I "sometimes" worry about
    this. If truth be told, my fretfulness about neglected crunches is starting to
    consume my every waking thought. Yesterday, for example, I was standing upon a
    bridge, staring off into the distance, buffeted by a gale, and all I could think
    of was the fact that the credit crunch is pushing some of my preferred crunches
    off the front pages. I don't have any useful media connections--or, to be more
    precise, my people don't have any connections with their people--so it's not as
    if I can just send a few metal tapping machine messages to selected newspaper
    crunch reporters and put pressure on them to cover other crunches. Would that
    I could! What I did instead, yesterday, was to trudge disconsolately home and
    to spend a fruitful few hours studying Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The
    Bumper Book Of Crunches. I can recommend this fantastic, and very fat, book to
    anyone who seeks to broaden their knowledge beyond the credit crunch. It is packed
    with crunch-related facts, anecdotage, illustrations, diagrams, and even its very
    own cleverly-crafted crunchiness.
