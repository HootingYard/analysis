  text: "There is much in the news these days about the credit crunch, but this should\
    \ not lead us to neglect many other important crunches. I sometimes worry that\
    \ less attention is paid to some crunches because they lack the alliterative quality\
    \ of the credit crunch, which of course makes it a favourite of headline writers\
    \ and broadcasters. Actually, it's not quite true that I \u201Csometimes\u201D\
    \ worry about this. If truth be told, my fretfulness about neglected crunches\
    \ is starting to consume my every waking thought. Yesterday, for example, I was\
    \ standing upon a bridge, staring off into the distance, buffeted by a gale, and\
    \ all I could think of was the fact that the credit crunch is pushing some of\
    \ my preferred crunches off the front pages. I don't have any useful media connections\u2014\
    or, to be more precise, my people don't have any connections with their people\u2014\
    so it's not as if I can just send a few metal tapping machine messages to selected\
    \ newspaper crunch reporters and put pressure on them to cover other crunches.\
    \ Would that I could! What I did instead, yesterday, was to trudge disconsolately\
    \ home and to spend a fruitful few hours studying Pebblehead's bestselling paperback\
    \ The Bumper Book Of Crunches. I can recommend this fantastic, and very fat, book\
    \ to anyone who seeks to broaden their knowledge beyond the credit crunch. It\
    \ is packed with crunch-related facts, anecdotage, illustrations, diagrams, and\
    \ even its very own cleverly-crafted crunchiness."
