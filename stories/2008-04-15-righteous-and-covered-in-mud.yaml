  text: '"Here''s the way I want to show up at the gates of heaven. I want to come
    skidding in there on all fours. I want to be slipping and sliding and I want to
    hit the gates of heaven with a bang. And when I stand up, when I stand before
    Christ, I want there to be blood on my knees, and my elbows. I want to be covered
    with mud. And I want to be standing there with a ragged breastplate of righteousness,
    and a spear in my hand. And I want to say, ''look at me, Jesus, I''ve been in
    the battles, I''ve been fighting for you''."--Retired Lieutenant-General William
    Boykin, addressing a conference of apocalyptic Christian Zionists, April 2008.'
