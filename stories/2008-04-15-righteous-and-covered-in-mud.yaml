  text: "\u201CHere's the way I want to show up at the gates of heaven. I want to\
    \ come skidding in there on all fours. I want to be slipping and sliding and I\
    \ want to hit the gates of heaven with a bang. And when I stand up, when I stand\
    \ before Christ, I want there to be blood on my knees, and my elbows. I want to\
    \ be covered with mud. And I want to be standing there with a ragged breastplate\
    \ of righteousness, and a spear in my hand. And I want to say, \u2018look at me,\
    \ Jesus, I've been in the battles, I've been fighting for you\u2019.\u201D\u2014\
    Retired Lieutenant-General William Boykin, addressing a conference of apocalyptic\
    \ Christian Zionists, April 2008."
