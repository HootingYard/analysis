  text: 'I''ve decided to start a keeping a note of interesting names as I come across
    them. First names, for the most part, though spectacular surnames may also earn
    a place in my collection.

    Two to begin with: Michael Gilleland ("antediluvian, bibliomaniac, and curmudgeon")
    at Laudator Temporis Acti reminds us that one of the signatories of the US Declaration
    of Independence gloried in the name of Button Gwinnet. And ever since I heard
    him being interviewed on the radio a few weeks back, I''ve had a soft spot for
    deaf activist Tomato Lichy. His assertion that deafness is not a disability is,
    um, unusual, but his name is Tomato and that''s good enough for me.'
