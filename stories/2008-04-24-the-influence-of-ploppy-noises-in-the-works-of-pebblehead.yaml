  text: "As a writer of bestselling paperbacks, Pebblehead tends not to attract serious\
    \ critical attention. Too often, his works are dismissed as pap for airheads,\
    \ and while this is arguably the case with such works as Pap For Airheads, Slops\
    \ Of Triviality Sloshing About Between The Ears, and his thriller The Glazed Stare\
    \ Of The Brain-Dead Mop-Bucket Zombie, it is an encouraging sign that one or two\
    \ scholars are addressing the Pebblehead oeuvre with perspicuity and panache.\
    \ Well, one, rather than one or two.\nI refer to Sidney Ullage's recent article\
    \ in the literary journal Bookish Goo in which he examines the influence of ploppy\
    \ noises in Pebblehead's as yet unpublished blockbuster Dustbin Of Pomposity!\
    \ Using critical techniques developed by men with terrific beards, Ullage argues\
    \ that we cannot begin to understand the book without first being locked up in\
    \ a dank cellar in which beetles scurry across the mildewed floor and mysterious\
    \ ploppy noises can be heard, possibly coming from behind a panel hidden in the\
    \ gloom.\nThere are those who poo-poo Ullage's close reasoning and breathtaking\
    \ critical acuity as the ravings of an idiot. There are those who accuse him of\
    \ having a decidedly oddly-shaped head and the wrong sort of beard. There are\
    \ those who, having engaged him in conversation at glamorous cocktail parties\
    \ in swish urban rooftop gardens, dismiss him as a babbling freak with \u201C\
    issues\u201D. There are those who wish he had been strangled at birth and disposed\
    \ of in a pond. There are those who wish he had never been born at all. There\
    \ are those who grunt unintelligibly at the mention of his name. There are those\
    \ who pick holes in the sleeves of their jumpers before shovelling the contents\
    \ of a jar of pickled sausages down their gullets.\nI am proud to be among those\
    \ who rightly see Sidney Ullage as a harbinger. I am not yet entirely clear what\
    \ he harbinges, but by all that is holy in heaven and on earth I shall stand here\
    \ and repeat what I have just said, over and over again, until not only am I blue\
    \ in the face, but everything around me that has a face, the hens, the cows, the\
    \ cassowaries, the ducks, the other ducks, they, too, all turn blue in the face,\
    \ a blue like the mightiest of skies over Pointy Town on a blazing noon when the\
    \ earth stops spinning."
