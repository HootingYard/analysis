  text: In a thicket, with a compass, I am thinking about blubber. I use blubber for
    my candles. I'm the captain of a whaler. Some use tallow, I use blubber. It gets
    smoky in my cabin. I'm not in my cabin now. As I said, I'm in a thicket. I'm on
    shore leave for a fortnight. I've been hiking with the devil. Satan left me in
    a thicket on the wild and windy moors. But I've got my trusty compass and my pipe
    clamped in my jaws. I am smoking in the thicket. I hope to see my whaler soon.
    Don't go hiking with the devil. Keep your compass in your pocket. I am thinking
    about blubber. Blubber is my candle light. It's a comfort in this thicket on the
    wild and windy moors to think of blubber candle light, for the devil trapped me
    in this thicket and it is a pitch black night.
