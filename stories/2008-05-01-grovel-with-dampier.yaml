  text: "Let us turn our attention to the world of gaming. There has been a fantastic\
    \ buzz in the industry as we approach the launch of the latest version of one\
    \ of the most popular games on the planet, a multibillion-dollar money-spinner\
    \ instantly recognisable from the three letters GWD.\nI am speaking, of course,\
    \ of Grovel With Dampier, the cardboard and chickenwire strategy game that numbers\
    \ among its fans Yoko Ono, Dale Winton, President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammedov of\
    \ Turkmenistan, and Stephen Fry. I have been fortunate enough to get a sneak preview\
    \ of version four and, let me tell you, it is everything it's cracked up to be.\n\
    As with the earlier releases, the basic concept of Grovel With Dampier is deceptively\
    \ simple. Sorry, that's not quite right. There's no deception involved. It is\
    \ simple! You, the player, accompany a simulacrum of buccaneering sea captain\
    \ Sir William Dampier (1651\u20131715) on his three circumnavigations of the globe.\
    \ Every now and again, you both disembark from your ship, whether it be the Cygnet,\
    \ the St George, or the Duke, and grovel in the stinking, muddy tidewaters of\
    \ whichever land mass you are at the edge of. Then, your hair festooned with kelp\
    \ and your eyes sore from salt water, you clamber back on to your ship and voyage\
    \ onwards to seek further grovelling grounds.\nAficionados will be pleased to\
    \ learn that most, if not all, of the irritating additional features have been\
    \ removed from this new edition, allowing players to concentrate fully on the\
    \ essence of the game. There is no distracting music, no bleeps and blips and\
    \ high resolution graphics, just a sheet of cardboard and some chickenwire and\
    \ the opportunity to pretend you really are grovelling with Dampier. Does it get\
    \ any better than this?"
