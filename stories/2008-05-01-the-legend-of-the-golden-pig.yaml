  text: "The circumstances in which I first heard the legend of the golden pig were\
    \ oddly similar to those of the Sermon on the Mount. Crushed in a multitude, I\
    \ followed a beardy man up on to a hillock, and sat down and listened to him speak\u2026\
    \ well, more or less. There were two or three of us, rather than a heaving mass\
    \ of humanity, it was a flat field, not a hillock, and we did not listen to a\
    \ beardy man speaking to us directly but to the disembodied voice of a woman,\
    \ broadcast from a radio set perched on the back of a farmer's cart. The voice\
    \ belonged to the Woman Of Twigs, the radio set was pneumatic, and the cart belonged\
    \ to mad Old Farmer Frack. It was his field we gathered in, and it was partially\
    \ flooded.\nThere was no sign of the horse we assumed must have pulled the cart\
    \ into the middle of the field. Old Farmer Frack only had one horse, named Desmond,\
    \ so it was likely he had led it off along the lane to the fruit and nut market.\
    \ It seemed he planned to leave the cart in the field for some time, for its wheels\
    \ had been removed. I had seen the cart before, so I knew that they were the big\
    \ wheels of Motown, to where, at a guess, they were being returned. There were\
    \ wheels within wheels, too, and it had to be assumed they were also bound for\
    \ Motown.\nMy companions and I found a patch of field relatively free of puddles\
    \ and crouched in the muck to listen to the voice of the Woman Of Twigs. It was\
    \ hard to tell whether it was a live broadcast or had been pre-recorded, and the\
    \ reception from the pneumatic radio set could have been better. Buffeting winds\
    \ howling across the flat landscape caused interference, and we had to take off\
    \ our densely-knit waxed woollen hats and prick up our ears. We were glad about\
    \ the winds, though, for they kept spinning the sails of the windmills on Pang\
    \ Hill. Unlike the windmills of your mind so memorably sung about by Rex Harrison's\
    \ son Noel, the Pang Hill windmills were proper windmills, and on days when the\
    \ air was still and their sails creaked to a halt there was something ineffably\
    \ sad about them.\nIneffably sad, too, was the cracked and desolate voice of the\
    \ Woman Of Twigs as she told the legend of the golden pig, which was what we had\
    \ come to the field to hear. Old Farmer Frack had sent out a circular a fortnight\
    \ earlier, to announce this cultural event. It was a welcome interruption to the\
    \ unremitting tedium of our rustic malaise, as thrilling in its way as the visit\
    \ of the travelling cinematograph the previous year, when we had been treated\
    \ to a showing, in a different but no less sodden field, of the first and second\
    \ reels of Ivan Reitman's classic picture My Super Ex-Girlfriend.\nIt was a mystery\
    \ how mad Old Farmer Frack found the resources to provide us with such entertainments.\
    \ He appeared to spend his entire time driving his bellowing cows from field to\
    \ field, pointlessly, bellowing as he did so, but obviously there was another\
    \ side to him which we did not see. It was hard to imagine him brokering deals\
    \ in the offices of media moguls, his huge ox-like frame squashed into a tubular\
    \ steel executive seating pod, poring over spreadsheets, but we supposed it must\
    \ be so. The Advanced Powerpoint Presentation Skills Certificate nailed up on\
    \ the side of the cow byre and laminated to protect it from rainstorms was evidence\
    \ that Old Farmer Frack had an inner management pointyhead to whom he occasionally\
    \ gave vent.\nThe same could not be said of the Woman Of Twigs. She seemed to\
    \ hail from an entirely other world, remote and ancient and savage. I once read\
    \ an exciting, and completely comprehensible essay in The Very Difficult Journal\
    \ Of Postmodernist Impenetrability entitled \u201CPippy The Pony And Twee Transgressive\
    \ Hermeneutics In Narratives Of The Other\u201D, hoping that I might gain some\
    \ insight into the frankly bewildering nature of the Woman Of Twigs, but I was\
    \ disappointed. The laugh-a-minute text, or discourse, had nothing in it to help\
    \ me understand a weird, immensely tall crone draped in a burlap shift, with countless\
    \ twigs stuck in her mop of matted ghost-white hair. My time was not entirely\
    \ wasted, however, as the essay contained an astute and devastating analysis of\
    \ Rawson Marshall Thurber's film Dodgeball, which I hope to see one day if Old\
    \ Farmer Frack is able to bring the travelling cinema back to one of his fields.\n\
    I was mildly perplexed that the Woman Of Twigs had chosen not to appear in person\
    \ to tell us the legend of the golden pig. Until recently she had been a familiar\
    \ sight in our bucolic paradise, tottering about by the horse-trough or standing\
    \ majestic and windswept in the middle of the moors. Certain spiteful gossips\
    \ put it about that she had taken the Murdoch shilling and was due to host a breakfast-time\
    \ chatshow on Sky. I hoped that was not true, and it indeed turned out to be a\
    \ falsehood, for which those responsible were tethered to a cement block on the\
    \ village green and beaten with cudgels. Old Farmer Frack rented out the cudgels\
    \ himself, which showed yet another side to this surprisingly kaleidoscopic mad\
    \ old man. It remained the case, however, that no one had seen hide nor hair nor\
    \ twig of the Woman Of Twigs for weeks. Where she dwelt had always been an unfathomable\
    \ mystery, so it was not a simple case of bashing her door down and clamping a\
    \ bleeper round her ankle as we would normally do with aged solitaries.\nStill,\
    \ crouched in the field listening to the pneumatic radio blaring and crackling\
    \ from Old Farmer Frack's cart, it was good to hear her voice. I was unfamiliar\
    \ with the legend of the golden pig, and I thank my lucky stars that I was not\
    \ told it when I was tiny, for it is without doubt the most absolutely terrifying\
    \ story I have ever heard."
