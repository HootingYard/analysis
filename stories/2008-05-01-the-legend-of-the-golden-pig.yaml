  text: 'The circumstances in which I first heard the legend of the golden pig were
    oddly similar to those of the Sermon on the Mount. Crushed in a multitude, I followed
    a beardy man up on to a hillock, and sat down and listened to him speak... well,
    more or less. There were two or three of us, rather than a heaving mass of humanity,
    it was a flat field, not a hillock, and we did not listen to a beardy man speaking
    to us directly but to the disembodied voice of a woman, broadcast from a radio
    set perched on the back of a farmer''s cart. The voice belonged to the Woman Of
    Twigs, the radio set was pneumatic, and the cart belonged to mad Old Farmer Frack.
    It was his field we gathered in, and it was partially flooded.

    There was no sign of the horse we assumed must have pulled the cart into the middle
    of the field. Old Farmer Frack only had one horse, named Desmond, so it was likely
    he had led it off along the lane to the fruit and nut market. It seemed he planned
    to leave the cart in the field for some time, for its wheels had been removed.
    I had seen the cart before, so I knew that they were the big wheels of Motown,
    to where, at a guess, they were being returned. There were wheels within wheels,
    too, and it had to be assumed they were also bound for Motown.

    My companions and I found a patch of field relatively free of puddles and crouched
    in the muck to listen to the voice of the Woman Of Twigs. It was hard to tell
    whether it was a live broadcast or had been pre-recorded, and the reception from
    the pneumatic radio set could have been better. Buffeting winds howling across
    the flat landscape caused interference, and we had to take off our densely-knit
    waxed woollen hats and prick up our ears. We were glad about the winds, though,
    for they kept spinning the sails of the windmills on Pang Hill. Unlike the windmills
    of your mind so memorably sung about by Rex Harrison''s son Noel, the Pang Hill
    windmills were proper windmills, and on days when the air was still and their
    sails creaked to a halt there was something ineffably sad about them.

    Ineffably sad, too, was the cracked and desolate voice of the Woman Of Twigs as
    she told the legend of the golden pig, which was what we had come to the field
    to hear. Old Farmer Frack had sent out a circular a fortnight earlier, to announce
    this cultural event. It was a welcome interruption to the unremitting tedium of
    our rustic malaise, as thrilling in its way as the visit of the travelling cinematograph
    the previous year, when we had been treated to a showing, in a different but no
    less sodden field, of the first and second reels of Ivan Reitman''s classic picture
    My Super Ex-Girlfriend.

    It was a mystery how mad Old Farmer Frack found the resources to provide us with
    such entertainments. He appeared to spend his entire time driving his bellowing
    cows from field to field, pointlessly, bellowing as he did so, but obviously there
    was another side to him which we did not see. It was hard to imagine him brokering
    deals in the offices of media moguls, his huge ox-like frame squashed into a tubular
    steel executive seating pod, poring over spreadsheets, but we supposed it must
    be so. The Advanced Powerpoint Presentation Skills Certificate nailed up on the
    side of the cow byre and laminated to protect it from rainstorms was evidence
    that Old Farmer Frack had an inner management pointyhead to whom he occasionally
    gave vent.

    The same could not be said of the Woman Of Twigs. She seemed to hail from an entirely
    other world, remote and ancient and savage. I once read an exciting, and completely
    comprehensible essay in The Very Difficult Journal Of Postmodernist Impenetrability
    entitled "Pippy The Pony And Twee Transgressive Hermeneutics In Narratives Of
    The Other", hoping that I might gain some insight into the frankly bewildering
    nature of the Woman Of Twigs, but I was disappointed. The laugh-a-minute text,
    or discourse, had nothing in it to help me understand a weird, immensely tall
    crone draped in a burlap shift, with countless twigs stuck in her mop of matted
    ghost-white hair. My time was not entirely wasted, however, as the essay contained
    an astute and devastating analysis of Rawson Marshall Thurber''s film Dodgeball,
    which I hope to see one day if Old Farmer Frack is able to bring the travelling
    cinema back to one of his fields.

    I was mildly perplexed that the Woman Of Twigs had chosen not to appear in person
    to tell us the legend of the golden pig. Until recently she had been a familiar
    sight in our bucolic paradise, tottering about by the horse-trough or standing
    majestic and windswept in the middle of the moors. Certain spiteful gossips put
    it about that she had taken the Murdoch shilling and was due to host a breakfast-time
    chatshow on Sky. I hoped that was not true, and it indeed turned out to be a falsehood,
    for which those responsible were tethered to a cement block on the village green
    and beaten with cudgels. Old Farmer Frack rented out the cudgels himself, which
    showed yet another side to this surprisingly kaleidoscopic mad old man. It remained
    the case, however, that no one had seen hide nor hair nor twig of the Woman Of
    Twigs for weeks. Where she dwelt had always been an unfathomable mystery, so it
    was not a simple case of bashing her door down and clamping a bleeper round her
    ankle as we would normally do with aged solitaries.

    Still, crouched in the field listening to the pneumatic radio blaring and crackling
    from Old Farmer Frack''s cart, it was good to hear her voice. I was unfamiliar
    with the legend of the golden pig, and I thank my lucky stars that I was not told
    it when I was tiny, for it is without doubt the most absolutely terrifying story
    I have ever heard.'
