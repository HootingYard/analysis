  text: "Sensible Peter Hitchens has made some judicious comments about the cardboard\
    \ and chickenwire strategy game Grovel With Dampier. He rightly points out that\
    \ it is \u201Csqualid mind poison\u201D and \u201Cmental slurry\u201D, riddled\
    \ with \u201Ctoxic fantasies\u201D which turn those who play it into \u201Cdesensitised\
    \ amoral husk[s]\u201D. Harsh but true."
