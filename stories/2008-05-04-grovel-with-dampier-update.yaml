  text: Sensible Peter Hitchens has made some judicious comments about the cardboard
    and chickenwire strategy game Grovel With Dampier. He rightly points out that
    it is "squalid mind poison" and "mental slurry", riddled with "toxic fantasies"
    which turn those who play it into "desensitised amoral husk[s]". Harsh but true.
