  text: 'Our first example of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching took place
    in a pantry cluttered with jars in much disorder. Some of the jars contained goo
    or curd or pips or suet, in varying quantities, and some of the jars were empty.
    None were clean. All the jars had a coating of grime, as if they had lain untouched
    for many moons, as indeed they had, for this was an abandoned pantry. The lids
    of the jars would not have been easy to loosen had a determined person entered
    the pantry bent upon loosening the lid of any one of the jars, perhaps to eke
    out some goo or curd or pips or suet, or perhaps to pour into one of the empty
    jars a new and exciting substance. And hark! Here comes such a person, a wheezing
    person stomping down the passage towards the pantry and kicking the door in. He
    is a liveried attendant gone to seed and become a brute and he is holding a hammer.
    He has come to smash all the jars in the pantry for he has lost all sense of decorum.
    And then an Angel of the Lord appears, all a-shimmer, and commands him to lay
    down his hammer and leave the cluttered jars untouched. This is when the person
    begins flapping about and twitching uncontrollably, for about thirty seconds,
    in fear and shame, before fleeing the abandoned pantry. That happened on a Thursday.

    The second example involves a peasant and a cow and many bees. It was a Saturday.
    The peasant had trudged into the field to take a close look at the cow, for the
    cow had been fractious and the peasant was concerned. Though unlettered, the peasant
    had a goodly store of country wisdom and was confident that if the cow was sick
    he would be able to identify the nature of its malady and cure it. Like many a
    tragic hero in fiction, the peasant sought redemption for an enormity in his past,
    an enormity committed due to a character flaw. Careful study of tragic heroes
    will reveal that they often have such a flaw. One thinks of Coriolanus, for example,
    or Dobson. Neither the nature of the peasant''s fatal flaw, nor of the enormity
    for which he sought redemption, need concern us here, for this is not a tragedy,
    it is just an example of uncontrollable flapping about and twitching. In any case,
    it is reportage rather than fiction. That being so, the reader is entitled to
    hard facts, rigorously researched, and the winnowing out of all fluffiness. That
    is why I have employed a Hooting Yard Fact-Checker so you can be absolutely sure
    that what you read here is the pure and unvarnished truth. Obviously you need
    to have confidence in the person charged with the fact-checking, and that is why
    I fought hard to get someone for the job who I know can be relied upon. Yes, it
    is easy to laugh at an ex-schoolteacher pushing sixty who still wishes to be known
    as "Sting", but this was the man, remember, who first pointed out to the world
    that "Russians love their children too". It is just such acuity of insight that
    makes him perfect for the job I have employed him to do, and for which I pay him
    a pittance each month. "Sting" has promised to set up a separate Hooting Yard
    Fact Check website, so we can all look forward to that.

    I ought to point out here that, just as you can rely on me (and "Sting") to provide
    you with big tough facts, so in return I expect a degree of attentiveness from
    you. Toe-tapping, head-scratching, and sloshing out of the ears with some sort
    of wax-crumbling fluid, these can surely wait until my report is done. That is
    the bargain we strike.

    Now we''ve got that cleared up, like a rash, we can return to the peasant and
    the cow and the bees. But wait! You will want to be sure that they are bees, and
    not hornets, or wasps. Wait for a minute while I fire off a quick instruction
    to "Sting" to check up on that. Hmm. I have just realised how apposite his absurd
    nickname is for such a task.

    OK. I have sent my missive and imagine that, as I write, "Sting" is checking his
    encyclopaedias and databases and whatnot. Unless I tell you otherwise, you can
    assume that the bees we are about to encounter in our second example of uncontrollable
    flapping about and twitching are indeed bees.

    So the peasant with the tragic flaw trudged into the field to look at the cow,
    hoping to ascertain the nature of its sickness. Because it was a Saturday, the
    field was muddier than usual. The cow was standing more or less in the centre
    of the field, gazing at nothingness in a cow-like way. Its hocks had lost their
    shine, and the cardboard tag stapled to one of its ears was smudged. In this day
    and age, it is quite common for cows to have pieces of cardboard or plastic stapled
    to their ears, serving a number of purposes, and the staplers used are not so
    different from the staplers used in offices up and down the land. "Sting" told
    me that.

    As he approached the cow, the peasant tried to dredge from his brain some of the
    folk wisdom with which it had been crammed since infancy. He remembered "If your
    cow is sick on a Monday morning / Go and spit upon a spade just as the day is
    dawning", but that was no use to him, as it was Saturday. He remembered "Cow,
    cow, blotchy and stiff / Spray it with a bottle of Jif", but that particular spell
    lost its efficacy when Jif products were renamed Cif as part of a marketing exercise
    early in the 21st century. And he remembered "Your cow is sick, it''s got bird
    flu / But the Russians love their children too". As a piece of countryside lore
    this was useless, of course, as it did not suggest any remedies for the sick cow,
    but it is evidence of the extent to which the terrific profundities spouted by
    my fact-checking employee have entered the collective wisdom of the world.

    Be that as it may, before the peasant got a chance to inspect the cow, a swarm
    of bees came in from the west, and buzzed menacingly about his head. Cue his uncontrollable
    flapping about and twitching, perfectly understandable in the circumstances. The
    bees harried the peasant until he turned tail and fled the field on that Saturday
    morning. The cow, by the way, had only a minor ailment, from which it recovered
    without human intervention, although I understand that it is currently in a cow-based
    twelve-step programme in an adjoining field. As for the peasant, he would have
    to await a new challenge to redeem himself from the peccadillos of his past, whatever
    they were.

    We move on now, breathlessly but with vigour, to the third of our examples of
    uncontrollable flapping about and twitching. Forget pantries, forget peasants,
    this is a case of unearthly sci-fi stuff, set on a spaceship roaring through galaxies
    unimaginably distant, on a Tuesday evening. Captain Biff Bucklebim is at the controls
    on the deck of the USS Milquetoast Jesuit. He is a bit like Captain James T Kirk
    from Star Trek, but has a larger head and a speech impediment. As he likes to
    joke, it has been no impediment to his rise through the ranks of Starship Command,
    which has been meteoric. Captain Biff is still only twelve years old, although
    such are the warps and wefts of intergalactic travel that he is simultaneously
    ten thousand years old, and yet unborn, and akin to a god. Hard to get your head
    round, I know, and probably too much of a challenge for "Sting", who is still
    working on those bees.

    The USS Milquetoast Jesuit is sponsored by L''Oreal, and is powered by light-reflecting
    booster technology, just like Andi MacDowell''s hair. Captain Biff is contractually
    bound to use various L''Oreal hair products, but if he had his way he would smear
    his ginger mop with grease from the engine room. He is that kind of captain. When
    danger threatens, as it often does, he tousles his mop with one hand while punching
    the starship''s complicated control panel expertly with the other, all the while
    barking out commands to his crew. His accent is a curious mixture of Wyoming,
    Luxembourg, and vampire. He is extremely fond of Janacek''s String Quartet Number
    One, "The Kreutzer Sonata", and likes to have it played by the starship band at
    moments of high peril. When they are otherwise engaged, for example if they have
    been beamed down to a newly discovered planetoid to give an impromptu concert
    of Thomas Beecham Lollipops, Captain Biff loses his rag and flies into a temper
    tantrum, with much uncontrollable flapping about and twitching.

    I hope you have found these three examples helpful. Please add your own in the
    Comments. And please note that as soon as "Sting" gets back to me about the bees,
    I will add his findings here as a post scriptum.'
