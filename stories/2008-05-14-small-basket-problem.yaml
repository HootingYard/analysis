  text: This morning on the Today programme on Radio 4, a titan of industry (whose
    name I have already forgotten) said "this is the problem of small baskets trying
    to survey very complex... things". He paused beautifully at the point where I
    have inserted that ellipsis. Leaving aside the intriguing notion of baskets carrying
    out surveys, this seems to be a statement of brilliant profundity. I have been
    thinking about it for a couple of hours now and have yet to winkle from it the
    core of its wisdom.
