  text: "This morning on the Today programme on Radio 4, a titan of industry (whose\
    \ name I have already forgotten) said \u201Cthis is the problem of small baskets\
    \ trying to survey very complex\u2026 things\u201D. He paused beautifully at the\
    \ point where I have inserted that ellipsis. Leaving aside the intriguing notion\
    \ of baskets carrying out surveys, this seems to be a statement of brilliant profundity.\
    \ I have been thinking about it for a couple of hours now and have yet to winkle\
    \ from it the core of its wisdom."
