  text: 'Today is the one hundredth anniversary of the Great Emblotchment. There were
    countless other emblotchments throughout our history, but the one we commemorate
    today was of a blotchy magnitude well above those other emblotchments.

    It all started in a commercial laundry on Pudding Boulevard. A man named Pim--who
    may or may not have been related to the late Francis Pym, Foreign Secretary from
    1982 to 1983 - was bundling some towels into a basket when he noticed that one
    of the towels had been subjected to emblotchment. A man of piercing eyesight,
    a bit like Ray Milland in The Man With X-Ray Eyes (1963) but obviously not quite
    as piercing as that, Pim was able at a glance to divine the cause of the emblotchment,
    and it sent him into a panic. He scampered up the staircase from the laundry to
    street level, and ran the length of Pudding Boulevard waving the emblotched towel
    in the air. Thus microscopic blotchy bits were released into the atmosphere, invisible
    but none the less blotchy.

    The authorities acted with admirable speed. Pim was carted off to a mysterious
    institute hidden behind trees in the countryside, the sort of place that would
    later become familiar to viewers of the 1960s television series The Avengers.
    He was placed in isolation and fitted with a metal helmet wired up to bleeping
    consoles. The emblotched towel was torn from his grasp and sent to another mysterious
    institute in the countryside to be analysed by trained emblotchment analysts.
    Meanwhile, Pudding Boulevard was cordoned off with what at the time was an entirely
    new cordoning technique. A controlled explosion destroyed the laundry and its
    neighbouring buildings, and the rubble was taken away by over fifty horse-drawn
    carts and tossed down a pit. It was not a bottomless pit, but the nearest thing
    to a bottomless pit that could be identified at short notice. When the last bit
    of rubble was thrown down it, the pit opening was covered with layers of cement
    over which a rich, loamy soil was scattered, and lupins and primroses were planted
    there. A similar operation was carried out on the site of the laundry, except
    that hollyhocks and hyacinths were planted instead of lupins and primroses. There
    were compelling reasons for this.

    Before the day was out, big pumps were moved into position at either end of Pudding
    Boulevard, and the air was sucked into them, deblotched, and pumped back out.
    Thousands of starlings were lured to flock over the laundry site and kept there
    by a magnetic barrier. They were monitored by a team of top ornithologists in
    a lead-lined cabin just beyond the Boulevard, around which a flowerbed was dug
    and planted with geraniums and wisteria. At nightfall, volunteers from Pang Hill
    Orphanage were sent to scurry through the cordoned-off area and, as soon as they
    emerged, were tested for emblotchment in a hastily-rigged up lab the floors of
    which were strewn with lilies and petunias.

    As we know, none of this hectic activity succeeded in stopping the emblotchment.
    Not only were the starlings and orphans and top ornithologists emblotched, so
    too were the gardeners who planted the lupins and primroses and hollyhocks and
    hyacinths and geraniums and wisteria. Soon everything was emblotched, and I mean
    absolutely everything. Even the stars in their heavens, the outer planets, the
    gas giants, all succumbed to what is rightly called the Great Emblotchment. And
    exactly one year later, on the fifteenth of May 1909, the actor James Mason was
    born in Huddersfield. Some see this as a coincidence, but those of us who have
    studied such things see deeper patterns, patterns not unlike the embroidered curlicues
    on the towel that Pim waved as he dashed frantically down Pudding Boulevard and
    let loose the Great Emblotchment, one hundred years ago today.'
