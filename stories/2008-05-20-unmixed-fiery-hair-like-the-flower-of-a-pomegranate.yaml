  text: '"Black hair announces cowardice and great craftiness, excessively yellow
    and pale white hair, such as the Scythians and Celts have, reveals ignorance and
    clumsiness and wildness, and that which is gently yellow points towards an aptitude
    for learning, gentleness, and skill in art. Unmixed fiery hair like the flower
    of a pomegranate is not good, since for the most part their characters are beastlike
    and shameless and greedy. Legs which are very hairy with thick black hair indicate
    slowness at learning and wildness. Those whose loins and thighs have lots of hair
    separately from the other parts of the body are very lascivious."
