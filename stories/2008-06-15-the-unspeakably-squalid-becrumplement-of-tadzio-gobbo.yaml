  text: 'This piece first appeared in July 2006.

    Intriguing news from the world of letters, where weedy poet Dennis Beerpint has
    turned his hand to a work of prose fiction. We have received a review copy of
    the novel, entitled The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo, presumably
    on the basis that we will give it a favourable notice and thus boost Mr Beerpint''s
    bank balance, albeit flimsily.

    "An immense mass of clotted nonsense". That was the verdict of the magazine Teachers''
    World upon the first publication of Ulysses* by James Joyce, and I am tempted
    to say the same about this Beerpint book, and leave it at that. Astonishingly,
    however, this thousand-page tome has already been made a set book for schools,
    colleges, and orphanages throughout the land, which means that your tots, if you
    have any, or you, if you are a tot, will have to become familiar with it. When
    examination time comes round, everyone''s knowledge of Dennis Beerpint''s fictional
    farrago will be tested to the full. And so, public-spirited as ever, I am going
    to try to save you from wasting your precious time actually reading the damn thing,
    by telling you what you need to know.

    Plot : Tadzio Gobbo is a princeling in a fictional Renaissance city state, clearly
    meant to remind us of the setting of a Jacobean drama such as The Courier''s Tragedy
    by Richard Wharfinger. As the novel opens, Gobbo is pristine, even, and uncreased.
    "If he were a piece of cardboard," writes Beerpint, "he would not be of the corrugated
    kind." Chapter by chapter we watch as the princeling becomes ever more becrumpled
    in a variety of unspeakably squalid ways, until at the end there is a deus ex
    machina and he is unfolded and ironed out.

    Characters : Tadzio Gobbo is a crude self-portrait of the author, sharing his
    weediness, neurasthenia, predilection for twee verse, and hypochondria. Many of
    his becrumplements are accompanied by the onset of an imagined disease, such as
    yaws, the bindings, ague, flux, black bile, bitter colic and the strangury. Beerpint
    attempts to play up a certain devil-may-care foppishness, but this is never convincing.
    In fact it is laughably inept.

    There is a host of secondary characters, the most important being Lugubrio, the
    princeling''s mad, stiletto-wielding uncle. Beerpint is constantly harping on
    about his "frantic black eyebrows", which soon becomes tiresome. Lugubrio''s sole
    motive for all his actions, from eating his breakfast to murdering a crippled
    beggar, is revenge, but what or whom he is avenging is never made clear to the
    reader.

    Other characters in the novel are a mixture of fictional, legendary, and real
    historical figures. Among the latter are Anthony Burgess, Edward G Robinson, Emily
    Dickinson, L Ron Hubbard and Veronica Lake. Beerpint thinks he is being clever
    by setting some of the scenes in a so-called ''Scientology tent'' on the banks
    of ''Lake Veronica'', but the effect is simply witless, and the reader will struggle
    not to throw the book into the fireplace.

    Imagery : As a poet, Beerpint has been praised for his imagery (although I cannot
    think why) and The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio Gobbo is jam-packed
    with all his old favourites. Crows, cows, burnt toast, pencil-cases, weather systems,
    the blood-spotted handkerchief of a tuberculosis patient, chaffinches, hedgerows,
    the horn of plenty and the Garden of Gethsemane, mud, chutes, Mudchute, potato
    recipes and pastry fillings, starlings, pigs, more starlings, more pigs, a nightmarish
    albino hen and the Munich Air Disaster are all evoked at one time or another in
    imagistic ways, as the princeling become ever further becrumpled.

    Does the book have heft? : Yes it does.

    Structure : The book is divided into forty nine chapters, fairly uniform in length.
    Each chapter ends with a reminder, as if the reader needed one, that a further
    stage of unspeakably squalid becrumplement has taken place, except for the last
    chapter, to which I have already referred. Beerpint is clearly fond of the practice
    found in the picaresque novel of summarising the plot in his chapter headings.
    To take a random example, Chapter XXVI is titled: "In which the becrumpling of
    Tadzio Gobbo proceeds apace, as his mad uncle Lugubrio unleashes a swarm of killer
    bees into the sports arena during a wrestling contest, and a false eclipse of
    the sun leads to rioting and flux; together with some notes on the flocking of
    chaffinches and the nesting habits of starlings, an aside in which a missing punctuation
    mark spells doom for an apothecary, and the reappearance of Lugubrio''s lobster."

    Plagiarism or quotations : Certain passages in the book appear to have been copied
    verbatim from novels by Barbara Taylor Bradford, Elias Canetti, Dan Brown, and
    the sociopathic ex-jailbird Jeffrey Archer. Dennis Beerpint presumably considers
    this to be postmodernist irony, a dangerous medical condition best treated by
    having one''s brain sluiced out with a violent purgative.

    Narrative sloppiness : Untold oodles of it. It is a sloppy, flabby and slapdash
    book from first to last. At its core is a burning jewel of flummery and poppycock.

    Brow : Neither high, middle, nor low. Not even no-brow. This book''s brow is frantic
    and black (see above).

    Bookcase location : Finding the right spot for this volume on your bookcase or
    bookshelf is likely to be fraught with difficulty. Dobson''s invaluable pamphlet
    on the shelving of books, which is sadly out of print, will not help you, even
    if you manage to track down a copy, for as the titanic pamphleteer readily admits,
    "There are certain books, especially those written by twee poets such as Dennis
    Beerpint, which resist proper shelving on even the most well-ordered of bookcases.
    Top left corner? No. Squeezed in among the drivel and tat on the bottom shelf?
    Hardly. Shoved behind the collected works of Edward Upward and quietly forgotten?
    Certainly not, because you will always remember that it is there, and its hidden
    presence will reproach you every time you go anywhere near the bookcase, and you
    will be as the lowest worm or beetle or that which creepeth on its belly in the
    foulest muck of the earth." Maddeningly, Dobson goes no further, he leaves us
    in the lurch, he refuses to say what I think he means--set fire to the damn thing
    in your garden, just as Burgess biographer Roger Lewis was tempted to do with
    a rival Life of the absurd Mancunian polymath.

    Marketing ploy : Each copy of The Unspeakably Squalid Becrumplement Of Tadzio
    Gobbo comes with a free gift, viz. a paper bag of badger food. For that reason
    alone, I recommend that you buy a copy at once.

    *NOTE : James Joyce always pronounced it as "Oolisiss".'
