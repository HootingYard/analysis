  text: I know next to nothing about computer games, but tireless Hooting Yard researcher
    Tristan J Shuddery tries hard to keep me abreast of the latest developments. Many
    thanks to Tristan, then, for alerting me to an exciting "interactive text adventure
    computer game" called Lost Pig. What topic could possibly be more thrilling? I
    admit myself to be befuddled by it, but for those of you who know how these things
    work, here is a link to it. Happy pig finding!
