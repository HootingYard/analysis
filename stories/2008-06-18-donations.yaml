  text: 'I want to take this opportunity to thank those readers and listeners who
    click that rectangular orange emblem over to the right and make donations to Hooting
    Yard via Paypal. There aren''t that many of you, and you know who you are, and
    you should be aware that your donations are genuinely appreciated. They do actually
    help me to meet such essential costs as my gas bill or bus fares.

    If you haven''t yet donated, and enjoy the teeming thousands of words here or
    the countless hours of podcast audio of me babbling into a microphone, please
    consider doing so. If nothing else, you will get your reward in heaven, or in
    hell via a handcart, depending upon your moral probity.'
