  text: "The global merchandising arm of the Hooting Yard franchise, always keenly\
    \ aware of what passes for the zeitgeist, will shortly be launching upon a delighted\
    \ public its latest product. Years of ruinously expensive research come to fruition\
    \ with the appearance in a shop near you of the Malevolent Homunculus Action Figure.\n\
    \nDeceptively innocent-looking, this tiny homunculus-sized homunculus is actually\
    \ a model of a particularly evil homunculus, one which can be sent out on nocturnal\
    \ escapades to terrorise one's unsuspecting neighbours. Although not as minuscule\
    \ as the homunculus favoured by spermist theoreticians, it is still remarkably\
    \ small, about the size of a newborn squirrel. It has moveable arms and legs,\
    \ a fully rotating head, and a well-ironed shirt the better to conceal its inherent\
    \ malevolence. Package also includes a scenic backdrop, made of sturdy cardboard,\
    \ of \u201Cthose pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing\u201D\
    \ from Brief Encounter (David Lean, 1945) against which the malevolent homunculus\
    \ can be posed, spookily."
