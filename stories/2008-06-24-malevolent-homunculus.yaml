  text: 'The global merchandising arm of the Hooting Yard franchise, always keenly
    aware of what passes for the zeitgeist, will shortly be launching upon a delighted
    public its latest product. Years of ruinously expensive research come to fruition
    with the appearance in a shop near you of the Malevolent Homunculus Action Figure.


    Deceptively innocent-looking, this tiny homunculus-sized homunculus is actually
    a model of a particularly evil homunculus, one which can be sent out on nocturnal
    escapades to terrorise one''s unsuspecting neighbours. Although not as minuscule
    as the homunculus favoured by spermist theoreticians, it is still remarkably small,
    about the size of a newborn squirrel. It has moveable arms and legs, a fully rotating
    head, and a well-ironed shirt the better to conceal its inherent malevolence.
    Package also includes a scenic backdrop, made of sturdy cardboard, of "those pollarded
    willows by the canal just before the level crossing" from Brief Encounter (David
    Lean, 1945) against which the malevolent homunculus can be posed, spookily.'
