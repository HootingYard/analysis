  text: "As usual during a major football tournament, I have been keeping note of\
    \ the bon mots (and bon Motsons) of the commentary teams, always a joy to listen\
    \ to. Euro 2008, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, is not yet over, but it is\
    \ unlikely that this gem will be bettered:\n\u201CHere we are in the field of\
    \ dreams, surrounded by fields of cows.\u201D"
