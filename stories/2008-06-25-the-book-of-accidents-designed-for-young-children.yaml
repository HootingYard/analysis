  text: 'Peacay, the onlie begetter of BibliOdyssey, draws my attention to the excellent
    Book Of Accidents Designed For Young Children (1831).

    I''m sure this must have been a set book for the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage.
    The anonymous author "conceives he cannot render a more important service to the
    rising generation and to parents, than by furnishing them with an account of the
    accidents to which Children, from their inexperience or carelessness, are liable.
    If generally studied it will save the lives of thousands, and relieve many families
    from the long and unavailing misery attendant on such occurrences". Among the
    potential mishaps addressed in this invaluable book are Playing With Horses, Worrying
    Dogs, Scalded At The Table, Playing With Fire-Arms, Falling Out Of A Coach, and
    Troubling The Cook.

    There are some sample pages here, where you will also find a link to the entire
    book online.'
