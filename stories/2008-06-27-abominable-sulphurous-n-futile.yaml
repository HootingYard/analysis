  text: '"France still produces abominable sulphurous State-made matches (the manufacture
    of matches being a State monopoly). The label designs are sometimes poor and the
    colouring crude... One of the earliest German labels, issued in 1835, illustrates,
    by drawing, how to ignite the match by rubbing it on the box. Even the most ignorant
    person knew how to light a match, and the label appears a very futile one."--A
    J Cruse, Matchbox Labels Of The World, With a History of Fire-Making Appliances
    from Primitive Man to the Modern Match, together with a History of the World''s
    Labels (1946).

    Further opinionated matchbox label observations are likely to follow, so watch
    this space. Many thanks to Ed Baxter.'
