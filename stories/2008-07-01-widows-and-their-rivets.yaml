  text: "The following was posted as a comment on Hunched Among These Shimmerings\u2026\
    \ but it raises such an important point that I decided to place it here on the\
    \ main page. R wrote:\nI wonder if Mr Key would be kind enough briefly to clarify\
    \ about the \u2018industrial funnel manufacturing compound\u2019? Is this a manufacturing\
    \ compound where industrial funnels are brought into being, or is it rather an\
    \ industrial manufacturing compound whose output happens to be funnels?\nLest\
    \ I seem to be splitting hairs, I should perhaps add that the former instance\
    \ might well be a case of two amiable widows occasionally meeting in, let's suppose,\
    \ a disused pig-pen or similar compound where they desultorily pop a few more\
    \ rivets into their long lives\u2019 work, a single immense funnel of statuesque\
    \ and sturdy conception; whereas the latter case might imply a colossal foundry\
    \ or other such satanic installation which churns out, in their tens of thousands,\
    \ minute funnels of such a definitively non-industrial calibre that they buckle,\
    \ or actually wither to dust, under the mere weight of the potential customer's\
    \ scrutiny.\nR is quite right to draw attention to the ambiguity, and I am happy\
    \ to clarify that the industrial funnel manufacturing compound to which I referred\
    \ was indeed a disused pig-pen wherein two widows popped rivets into a single\
    \ immense funnel. I'm glad we've cleared that one up."
