    but it raises such an important point that I decided to place it here on the main
    page. R wrote:

    I wonder if Mr Key would be kind enough briefly to clarify about the ''industrial
    funnel manufacturing compound''? Is this a manufacturing compound where industrial
    funnels are brought into being, or is it rather an industrial manufacturing compound
    whose output happens to be funnels?

    Lest I seem to be splitting hairs, I should perhaps add that the former instance
    might well be a case of two amiable widows occasionally meeting in, let''s suppose,
    a disused pig-pen or similar compound where they desultorily pop a few more rivets
    into their long lives'' work, a single immense funnel of statuesque and sturdy
    conception; whereas the latter case might imply a colossal foundry or other such
    satanic installation which churns out, in their tens of thousands, minute funnels
    of such a definitively non-industrial calibre that they buckle, or actually wither
    to dust, under the mere weight of the potential customer''s scrutiny.

    R is quite right to draw attention to the ambiguity, and I am happy to clarify
    that the industrial funnel manufacturing compound to which I referred was indeed
    a disused pig-pen wherein two widows popped rivets into a single immense funnel.
    I''m glad we''ve cleared that one up.'
