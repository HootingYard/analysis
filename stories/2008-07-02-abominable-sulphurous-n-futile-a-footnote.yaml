  text: 'By coincidence, the title of an earlier post, Abominable, Sulphurous & Futile,
    is the exact wording used by Blodgett whenever he is asked his opinion of ducks.
    Blodgett hates ducks. Scoter or shoveller, merganser or teal, he loathes them
    all. It is important to point out that this is not a phobia, an irrational fear,
    but rather a conscious, reasoned hatred, though the reasoning itself is flawed,
    as is Blodgett''s reasoning in pretty much every area of life save for matters
    of railway timetabling. Even then, his tendency to measure the speed of trains
    in nautical knots has led to all sorts of problems, but that is a topic for another
    time. I have already set aside this coming October for some thorough research
    into Blodgett and the railways.

    Blodgett himself has always insisted that he hates ducks because ducks hate him.
    The evidence for this appears to be that, as a small child, he was attacked by
    a massed gaggle of red-crested pochards at the edge of a pond into which he was
    innocently tossing pebbles. Let us examine that claim in some detail.

    We need, I think, to ask some hard questions. Where was this pond? Was it truly
    a pond, rather than, say, a puddle or a cwm or a tarn or a mere or a lake or even
    the edge of a mighty and unknown sea? As for the pebbles, were they indeed pebbles
    or were they dangerously large rocks with very sharp edges that could slice through
    the neck of a passing pochard or smew? By his own account, Blodgett was a mere
    tot when this incident took place, so how had he learned to distinguish between
    different types of duck? What sort of pedagogy would teach infants to identify
    teal before they learned to read and write and count and tell the time and tie
    their shoelaces? In a duck-strewn domain, of course, such methods may make sense,
    but from what we know of the land where Blodgett was raised we can safely say
    that its duck population was average and unremarkable. The same is true of its
    ponds and pond-like bodies of water, tallies of which were, and still are, kept
    by pond-counting persons employed by the local potentate. Make no mistake, pond-counting
    used to be an honourable profession, one to which any citizen possessed of good
    eyesight, sturdy limbs, and possession of a notched stick could aspire. Blodgett''s
    own mother trained as a pond-counter, but a promising career was curtailed when
    she choked on a pip and came down with Van Bronckhorst''s Syndrome.

    Getting back to those pebbles for a moment, what is the truth of Blodgett''s claim
    that he was tossing them into the pond innocently? One does not need to believe
    in the doctrine of Original Sin to be aware that oftentimes tiny children carry
    out acts of the most grievous moral turpitude. And though we may have difficulty
    grasping exactly what goes on in the brains of a gaggle of pochards, it is surely
    not beyond our wit to consider that, for a duck, the tossing of pebbles into a
    pond could be seen as an act of brute destruction. The psychology of ducks may
    not be a subject on the curriculum of the standard infant community hub, but if
    the tinies are taught to tell the difference between a smew and a merganser, might
    they not also be given a grounding in the hopes and fears, the joys and terrors,
    of these aquatic birds?

    Thus we need also to ask what sort of education the young Blodgett was given if
    we are to ascertain the truth of his claims. Are we to assume it was skewed in
    favour of the study of ducks? And if so, what would account for such an idiosyncratic
    approach? We all know that there are pedagogues with manias, obsessions, and tunnel
    vision. The deranged tutor is a staple of a certain type of fiction. One thinks,
    for example of the sinister schoolmaster Weems in the 1907 potboiler The Sinister
    Schoolmaster Weems by Peverel Greasebox, or the frankly batty provost of the cathedral
    school in Archibald Glubb''s long-running serial for the Dotty Capers For Boys
    comic. Did the tot Blodgett fall into the clutches of such a nutcase, or could
    it be that his own childhood memories were filtered through his readings of Greasebox
    and Glubb, if indeed he ever did read them? If he spent so much time learning
    about ducks, when could he have learned to read in the first place?

    By asking such questions, we begin to pick away at Blodgett''s tale, casting doubt
    on it. And do I need to explain why to do so is of such vital importance? The
    man is a scoundrel and a rogue, not in a likeable gap-toothed and moustachioed
    Terry-Thomas manner, but in a way far more damaging to our national fabric. Remember
    that Blodgett has tried his utmost to appear on flags and postage stamps and even
    on coinage. He would have us believe he is a model of probity. He likes to be
    seen on horseback at parades, wearing a helmet with feathers. The airbags in certain
    makes of car bear his imprimatur, and most recently he has had no fewer than five
    different soups named after him. These power-crazed shenanigans have to be curbed,
    for if Blodgett ever gets a toehold on power I fear for the future of our country''s
    ducks. He is a spiteful man. Already it seems we are in danger of losing our bees.
    Let us make sure we keep our ducks.

    pamphlet sold for tuppence at some point in the last century.'
