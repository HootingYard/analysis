  text: 'I have just created a Wordle. As far as I can see, it''s based on the most
    recent Hooting Yard entries, rather than all of them, which is what I would have
    preferred. And yet it is still a thing of beauty, I think.

    If I had more skill in technical jiggery-pokery, I would have copied the image
    and posted it here to save you following the link, but it didn''t seem to lend
    itself to standard copying and pasting. Perhaps I can rely on the helpful nature
    of a technobod reader to tell me how to do that, and also to tell me if it''s
    possible to do a Wordle of all of Hooting Yard, rather than just some of it.

    N.B.--There is a second one here.'
