  text: "Christopher Frew's letter in today's Guardian is worthy of note:\nI am sure\
    \ professional broadcasters will have many stories to tell of Charles Wheeler,\
    \ but my favourite dates from the defection of Kim Philby at the height of the\
    \ cold war (Obituaries, July 5). Wheeler was asked whether he was surprised at\
    \ Philby's treason. \u201CNot really,\u201D replied Wheeler, \u201CI never really\
    \ trusted him. He was the sort of fellow who \u2026 smiled at breakfast, that\
    \ sort of thing.\u201D A great loss, fondly remembered."
