  text: 'Christopher Frew''s letter in today''s Guardian is worthy of note:

    I am sure professional broadcasters will have many stories to tell of Charles
    Wheeler, but my favourite dates from the defection of Kim Philby at the height
    of the cold war (Obituaries, July 5). Wheeler was asked whether he was surprised
    at Philby''s treason. "Not really," replied Wheeler, "I never really trusted him.
    He was the sort of fellow who ... smiled at breakfast, that sort of thing." A
    great loss, fondly remembered.'
