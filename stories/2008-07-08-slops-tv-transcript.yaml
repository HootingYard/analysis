  text: 'If you are a keen traveller with an interest in gravy, you will already be
    aware that there are two recommended forms of transport to suit your palate, the
    gravy boat and the gravy train. Some years ago it was announced that a cheap and
    safe gravy booster jetpack was being developed, but alas! funding for the project
    was fumbled, as is so often the case, and the company behind the scheme collapsed
    amid bitterness and gall like something from the Book of Lamentations. There the
    story might have ended. Yet according to a fascinating documentary due to be broadcast
    next week on the soup-, sauce- and gravy-focused online channel Slops TV, one
    of the key figures involved is still working away at the idea from a potting shed
    on an allotment in a dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond. Hooting
    Yard is always keen to salute inventors, be they cranks or visionaries, so we
    managed to obtain a transcript of part of the programme:

    It''s rather cramped in this potting shed on an allotment in a dismal little town
    somewhere in the back of beyond, and there is very little light, so you probably
    won''t be able to see much apart from oppressive gloom. Also, we''re having a
    few problems with the camera, so the gloom will be not just oppressive but juddery.
    I''ve just sent a runner back to the studio to see if we can get a repair person
    or a replacement camera, but I''m not holding my breath.

    I was holding my breath a few minutes ago, however, because the man I''ve come
    here to see released some valves and the potting shed was filled with fumes, which
    luckily have dispersed. Apparently, the fumes were so toxic they could fell a
    field of cows in eight seconds flat, from a huge distance, so I consider myself
    pretty lucky that I''m still talking to you.

    So who is he, this man squashed into a cramped potting shed on an allotment in
    a dismal little town somewhere in the back of beyond releasing valves that let
    toxic fumes escape, endangering himself, and me, and Prudence the camerawoman,
    not to mention thousands of cows for miles around? Well, he won''t tell me his
    name, and he won''t speak. He wants to remain anonymous because of the top secret
    nature of what he''s up to, and he won''t speak because he''s too busy resealing
    the valves and mucking about with all sorts of other gubbins.

    Now you might think that, faced with an uncooperative subject and a faulty camera,
    we would just pack up and go home. But here at Slops TV we don''t know the meaning
    of failure. That''s why we''ve become the top soup-, sauce- and gravy-focused
    online channel on the web! We press ahead with the big stories where the faint
    of heart and the weak-minded would falter. As it says in our Mission Statement,
    we''re "not just about soup and sauce and gravy--we''re about the burning ambition
    and uncontrollable frenzy of a hothead who simply doesn''t understand the word
    NO!" Even Prudence had to sign up to that one, and she''s a Quaker, or a Mennonite,
    one of those Quietist sects... and a damned fine camerawoman if I may say so.

    See, now she''s managed to find a sliver of light coming in through a gap in the
    roof of the potting shed on an allotment in a dismal little town somewhere in
    the back of beyond, and even though the camera is even more juddery than before,
    you might just be able to get a glimpse of me presenting this exciting programme,
    flailing my arms around in an intriguing way. You still won''t be able to see
    the man we''ve come to film, because he''s skulking about in the gloom doing something
    to a pneumatic pump. I think he''s holding a pair of tweezers in one hand. In
    fact, he''s only got one hand. Like a lot of crackpot inventors he wears a prosthetic
    arm after losing the one he was born with in an explosion during one of his experiments.
    But that was then and this is now, and the tension is building as he patiently
    goes about his tinkering in the darkness. Like a mole or other burrowing animal,
    he is perfectly able to work in Stygian gloom, because he''s been doing this for
    years, fashioning all sorts of contraptions designed to make the world a better
    place.

    I''ll let you in on a little secret. It''s not actually related to soup or sauce
    or gravy, so forgive me for going off message, but this one-armed man with his
    tweezers working diligently in a cramped potting shed on an allotment in a dismal
    little town somewhere in the back of beyond is the man who gave us the retractable
    bloater skewer, that invaluable device which allows us to retract the skewer on
    which we have skewered our bloaters. Who can imagine a breakfast of bloaters where
    such a simple tool is not, at the very least, an option? Oh, you can say, I don''t
    want to retract the skewer from my bloaters, thank you very much! You can say
    that, and it might even be true, but I''ll bet there are times when the thought
    niggles away at you that, thanks to our friend here, you at least could if you
    wanted to.

    Prudence has very helpfully pointed out to me that soup, sauce, and gravy can
    all serve as accompaniments to bloaters, so I wasn''t going wildly off message
    after all.

    There is something strangely compelling about watching an amateur boffin at the
    top of his game. This reminds me of the time I was sent to do a report on a retired
    pig farmer who had devised an entirely new kind of bird scarifier. It was made
    of blotting paper and reconstituted meat substitute and dust, and the idea was
    that you attached it to a bunch of balloons and launched it into the air over
    your pig sty, and it would stop your pigs being attacked by savage starlings and
    guillemots and chaffinches. That old pig farmer also had a prosthetic limb, as
    a matter of fact, but in his case it was a leg. He, too, worked from a potting
    shed, but rather than being on an allotment in a dismal little town somewhere
    in the back of beyond, his was at the edge of a dilapidated cluster of buildings
    that had once been his pig farm before he retired, set in a sylvan vale, with
    brooks that babbled and dingly dells. It was certainly the most idyllic dilapidated
    pig farm I have ever filed a report from. The retired pig farmer gave me a demonstration
    of his invention, and I am hoping soon that this chap in the gloom is going to
    do likewise. At the moment he is messing around with some flaps and nozzles and
    I get the impression that he doesn''t want to be interrupted. So while Prudence''s
    camera is still rolling, let''s take a quick look outside.

    Well, as you can see, it''s pretty grim. These are blizzard conditions. I can
    see some hollyhocks and a turnip patch, but that''s about it. It''s actually quite
    difficult to get your bearings. In fact, I think we''ve strayed too far from the
    potting shed because I can''t even see it anymore. We''re in a sort of white nothingness.
    Ah, now, I don''t know if you can see this on your screens, but Prudence is pointing
    her camera at a sort of wraith-like being who is beckoning to us. It can''t be
    my taciturn crackpot inventor friend, because it''s much taller than him, much,
    much taller. We''re going to follow this impossibly huge albino ghoul and, this
    being Slops TV, you can come with us.

    We''re heading past some sleet-lashed potato beds now, and there seem to be more
    wraiths, a whole crowd of them, in fact, beckoning to us and groaning. This is
    fantastic! The spooky part is that we never seem to be getting any closer to these
    gigantic phantom beings. We must be a fair spit from the potting shed by now,
    judging by how far we''ve come, but the wraiths are still ahead of us, just at
    the edge of our vision. Their groaning and keening is getting louder, though,
    more desperate, and there''s something quite menacing about it.

    Oops, I think I just trod on a cabbage. And now I can''t feel anything at all
    under my feet. It''s as if we are in a complete void, white, limitless, and desolate.
    Prudence tells me that we''re now surrounded by wraiths, they''re behind us as
    well as ahead of us, at both sides, above us and below us, and the moaning and
    keening is growing ever more insistent and hideous and implacable. I haven''t
    known anything like this since the report I did from the Abyss of Doom in the
    Land of Gaar. Or, hang on, is that where we are now? Time doesn''t seem to mean
    anything anymore. No time. No space. Just howling, beckoning ghouls in a cold
    white emptiness. With Prudence by my side, running out of film.'
