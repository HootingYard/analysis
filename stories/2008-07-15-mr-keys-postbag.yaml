  text: "A letter arrives in Mr Key's postbag:\nSir\_: I find it promptly tricky that\
    \ during your latest musings on the life of Danny Blanchfowler, you failed to\
    \ mention Dobson's seminal pamphlet on the history and origins of the Fred Jessop\
    \ Cup On the history and origins of the Fred Jessop Cup (out of print).\nI happened\
    \ upon this pamphlet by chance in the August of 1987, whilst attending a car boot\
    \ sale in Swivenhoe, as my life then mainly consisted of scouring car boots in\
    \ the vein hope of unearthing a Penny Black. I was, anyway, passing uninterested\
    \ by tens and tens of jalopies full to their brims with tat their owners were\
    \ peddling: old lampshades, coloured rock, Ladybird books, copper barometers,\
    \ worn out bicycle tyres, Clarice Cliffe, rusty automata, dog-shaped humidors,\
    \ dirty vestas and assorted treen. One car boot though was devoid of tat, save\
    \ for a box filled with yellowing paperbacks and crumpled ordnance survey maps.\
    \ Having a penchant for ordnance surveys of the Upper Mendips, I had a rummage,\
    \ and there, sandwiched in between The Viper of Hunstanton: A Grant Panama Mystery\
    \ and Ordnance Survey Map number 216: Statton-on-Fosse to Lydford-on-Fosse, lay\
    \ Dobson's out of print pamphlet.\nI snatched it from the box with great gusto,\
    \ and upon examination of its condition, promptly haggled the slovenly oaf manning\
    \ the car boot down to thruppence and a glimpse at my prized Cuckoo's egg, for\
    \ purchase of the pamphlet.\nUpon returning to my hovel, I quickly consumed the\
    \ contents of the pamphlet\u2014savouring every moment, as respite from the squalid\
    \ little life I led at the time. It is what I then unearthed, \u2018neath its\
    \ tattered pages, for which I am bothering to pester you.\nQuoth Dobson:\n\u201C\
    the Fred Jessop cup, awarded once a year to the winners of the Fred Jessop Cup\
    \ association football competition, has several peculiar mysteries surrounding\
    \ it\u2014not least, the matter of it's disappearance in 1966, the year it was\
    \ won by Crackling Northwich. The 1965/66 season had gone splendidly well for\
    \ Crackling Northwich, a team made up of workers from De Bruuin's bulb factory.\
    \ This small town club used to the monotonous pinch and shove of the Rumbelow's\
    \ Division Four (North) had, under the guidance of Keswick De Bruuin, who acted\
    \ as their team coach, chairman, janitor, physiotherapist, coach driver, notary\
    \ and keeper of the club mascot (a rather disgruntled Kittiwake called Margaret),\
    \ achieved a miraculous cup run. Keswick's team had battled their way past the\
    \ Wigan Black Bull, Alsager Fare, and Hove Young Offender's Institute in the early\
    \ rounds.\nThen, after drawing a plum tie away to Tooting Mantrap (one of the\
    \ larger teams in their day), Crackling Northwich won through into the Semi-Final\
    \ of the Fred Jessop Cup. Winning eighteen nil, with champion booter Carlo Weinnacht\
    \ scoring a personal best of two. On the day of the draw at the football association\
    \ headquarters in Sloane Square, withering old twit and head of the association,\
    \ Herbert Drutt, took to the stage with an air of discomfort and a startled look\
    \ upon his chelonian features. He proceeded to announce to the watching masses\
    \ that the pride and joy of the association, the Fred Jessop Cup, had been pilfered\
    \ from its resting place in the boardroom, betwixt the case demonstrating the\
    \ various plumage phases of the mallard in eclipse and the portrait of the Prime\
    \ Minister remonstrating offside with the bosch during the annual World War One\
    \ Recreational Trench Warfare and Football picnic.\nSuspicion fell immediately\
    \ upon Keswick De Bruuin, who had previous for the theft of an elderly Boltonian\
    \ twenty years hence, and for whom the Fred Jessop Cup represented a golden opportunity\
    \ for some scrap metal smelting. Keswick, naturally in denial, retreated to his\
    \ hotel room with the entire Northwich Crackling squad, and was not heard from\
    \ again until three days later when the news broke that the cup had been found.\
    \ A part-time bomb disposal officer, Wally Sandwich, had been walking his collie,\
    \ Sniffles, around the outskirts of a disused children's recreational area, when\
    \ the dog had indicated the need to answer nature's call by giving Wally an uncomfortable\
    \ glance. Hurrying over to a swing, Wally saw metal glinting and gleaming from\
    \ underneath a climbing frame. When he went to investigate, there, crudely wrapped\
    \ in a soiled copy of Razzler, was the Fred Jessop Cup in all its unerring glory.\n\
    Three weeks later, Crackling Northwich were to defeat Rutland Water three goals\
    \ to two, allowing their captain, Nobby Blanchfowler to lift the Fred Jessop Cup\
    \ in front of his adoring audience and the onlooking paparazzo. To this day, no\
    \ one has ever solved the mystery of the Fred Jessop Cup snatch, and Keswick De\
    \ Bruuin never spoke of it again, meeting his untimely death at the hands of a\
    \ fraudulent psychic some two years later.\u201D\nI wonder Sir, whether the Nobby\
    \ Blanchfowler referred to therein is a relative, however distant, of footballing\
    \ prometheus Danny Blanchfowler?\nI eagerly await your reply.\nYours, in the bath,\n\
    Colonel Philomena Crow\n\_\nWell, Colonel, I can confirm that Nobby Blanchfowler\
    \ was indeed the twin brother of Danny Blanchfowler. Indeed, so close were the\
    \ twins that they shared the same neck. Further information on this rare medical\
    \ condition can be found in the song \u201CCharlie And Charlie\u201D on Slapp\
    \ Happy's album Acnalbasac Noom. I ought to point out, however, that the Fred\
    \ Jessop Cup bears no relation whatsoever to the similarly-named Fred Jesson Cup,\
    \ as mentioned in Danny Blanchfowler\_: A Life In Football. The latter trophy,\
    \ of course, bears the name of the fantastically exciting husband of Laura Jesson,\
    \ played by Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter (1945)."
