  text: 'Following on from Corncrake Project, the first in a series of what might
    be called Hooting Yard''s Readers'' Digest-style digested news stories, here is
    another one. Actually, this one is so digested that I have plucked just a single
    phrase from it.

    ... tinkering with a generator, while handling a sausage ...

    If I end up posting more of these enticing little bagatelles, they will need a
    proper collective name. "Hooting Yard Digestive Biscuits", perhaps.'
