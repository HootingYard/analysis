    \ be called Hooting Yard's Readers\u2019 Digest-style digested news stories, here\
    \ is another one. Actually, this one is so digested that I have plucked just a\
    \ single phrase from it.\n\u2026 tinkering with a generator, while handling a\
    \ sausage \u2026\nIf I end up posting more of these enticing little bagatelles,\
    \ they will need a proper collective name. \u201CHooting Yard Digestive Biscuits\u201D\
