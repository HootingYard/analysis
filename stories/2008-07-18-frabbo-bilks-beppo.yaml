  text: 'Beppo was bilked by Frabbo, so he plotted his revenge. Beppo came armed with
    a stiletto. We are in Verona, circa 1566. Frabbo was something of a dab hand at
    bilking, but no match for a pointy thing prodding at his torso. That was why he
    wore an iron vest.

    They say that Frabbo walked away unscathed that day in 1566. But he never again
    bilked in Verona. He had been shaken, and there were dents in his iron vest. He
    embarked upon a ship and sailed away to the New World.

    Aboard ship, Frabbo considered the rigging. All those skeins and knots reminded
    him of the plots in which he had so loved to become entangled. But for Frabbo
    a New World meant a New Leaf. He would be a good and simple exile.

    Frabbo''s brain became dizzy at the exotic strangeness of the New World. Seeking
    comfort in the familiar, he fell in with Jesuits. He helped them to convert the
    Inca through fire and flame. He lost all reason.

    Frabbo''s tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth and he scampered into the interior
    naked and loose of limb. The interior was a wild place of dripping foliage and
    shrieking birds and globular fruits. Frabbo found it horrible.

    Come 1576 and Frabbo is enswathed in turquoise raiment. He is deep in the interior
    and when he snaps his fingers monkey acolytes do his bidding. Ah, but hacking
    through fronds and creepers comes bilked Beppo at the head of a clanking platoon.
    It will be man versus monkey, and much blood will be spilt.'
