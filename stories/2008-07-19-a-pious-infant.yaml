  text: 'If, like me, you are unreasonably obsessed with the weird goings-on in the
    Anglican church, you might have discovered the blog being tapped out by Bishop
    Gene Robinson*. I am certainly pleased that I stumbled upon it, for I have learned
    about Saint Rumwold.

    Saint Rumwold was born at King''s Sutton in AD 662, the son of Saint Cyneburga
    and King Alchfrid. His first words, on the day he was born, were "I am a Christian".
    He then asked to be baptised, and to receive Holy Communion. The next day he preached
    a sermon, quoting freely from Scripture. On the third day he addressed another
    sermon, to his parents, and then he keeled over and died. A pious infant indeed.

    Possibly even more pious than Edward Gorey''s Henry Clump...


    *NOTE : Pansy Cradledew has asked me to point out that Bishop Gene Robinson, a
    gay bishop, should not be confused with Gay Bishop, the TV newsreader who sometimes
    presents news items about gay bishops.'
