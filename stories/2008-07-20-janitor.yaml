  text: 'For a long time, I used to go to bed early. I was exhausted from long days
    working as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. There are those who think
    that being a janitor is an easy life, little more than a matter of rattling a
    set of keys, sloshing a mop along a corridor floor, and glaring reproachfully
    at all who pass by. There may be janitors of that kidney, but I was not that kind
    of janitor, and never had been, neither in this nor in any of my earlier janitorships.
    It is a curious fact that the buildings in which I have been a janitor have all
    housed milk-related activities. Before being appointed to my post in the evaporated
    milk factory, I worked at a condensed milk canning plant, a milk of magnesia research
    laboratory, and a milk slops sloppage tank.

    When I was younger I lacked application and was frequently reprimanded, on a carpet,
    as is usually the case, by my superiors. The overseer of the sloppage tank was
    particularly rancorous, as I recall. But by the time I fetched up at the evaporated
    milk factory, I took my duties seriously, excessively so, and that was why I was
    exhausted at the end of the day. To be precise, I was exhausted before the end
    of the day, hence my going to bed early.

    There is a pamphlet by Dobson, entitled Tips For Janitors (out of print), which
    helped to mend my ways. One boiling hot summer Sunday, at a loose end, I went
    to visit a dying janitor in a Mercy Home. His brow was beetle and his jaw was
    lantern, and he was slowly perishing from a malady which had set in after an attack
    of the bindings and which he could not shake off due to his advanced age. It was
    not entirely clear just how old he was, for his birth certificate had been destroyed
    by worms. He certainly looked unbelievably ancient when I went to see him on that
    boiling day. Propped up in a sort of collapsible medical chair, surrounded by
    dripping foliage, like General Sternwood in The Big Sleep, he had made a vain
    attempt to mask his decrepitude by dyeing his hair black with boot polish and
    by sporting the type of tee shirt worn by young Japanese trendies. Neither ploy
    fooled me. I knew I was looking at a janitor who had begun his career in the age
    of gas mantles and steam.

    My visit was prompted by a plea from the Charitable Board For Janitors Close To
    Death, seeking volunteers to pay social calls on janitors close to death to brighten
    their last days. I thought myself too lugubrious to be suitable for such a good
    deed, but the Board''s director, an ex-flapper by the name of Mimsy Henbane, said
    that this particular dying janitor rejoiced in the lugubrious and funereal and
    bleak and that my presence would lift his spirits.

    Like the Italian castrato opera singer Luigi Marchesi (1754-1829), who, irrespective
    of the part he was playing, insisted on making his stage entrances on horseback,
    wearing a helmet with white feathers several feet long, I liked to cut something
    of a dash when entering a Mercy Home. On this particular Sunday I was ensmothered
    in fine kingly raiment, complete with the pelt of a wolverine (Gulo gulo, the
    largest land-dwelling member of the weasel family), a burnished golden helmet
    Marchesi would have died for, and a bauble or two. It was stiflingly hot, of course,
    but my blood is ice cold, and I had achieved a temperate equilibrium as I strode
    majestically into the greenhouse wherein the dying janitor awaited me. I am unable
    to tell you his name, not because I do not know it, but because I found it completely
    unpronounceable. He was of Tantarabim parentage, and bore one of those impossible,
    and I must say foolish, names they are so fond of in that land. He was also wearing
    a pair of dentures which had been designed for a mouth much larger than his, so
    it was not only his name I failed to catch. I had brought with me, as a gift,
    a bag of Extra Crunchy Hard Crunchable Crackers, and it looked to me as if those
    gigantic teeth would be more than a match for their crunchiness. Indeed they were.
    For a few minutes, as the dying janitor shovelled the crackers gratefully into
    his gob, it was like being in a hot damp greenhouse with a snapping turtle. He
    crunched his way through the whole bagful so rapidly that I wondered if he was
    ever fed. I had not seen any staff in the Mercy Home, not even a janitor. In fact,
    I had not seen any other patients. There were some pigs in a sty between the greenhouse
    and the main building, but otherwise the place seemed deserted.

    One of the things I have always liked about people from Tantarabim is that they
    are so easy to rub along with. After he had scoffed his crackers, the dying janitor
    sat there smiling weakly but, I supposed, contentedly, while I loomed above him
    lugubrious and funereal and bleak, just as Mimsy Henbane had suggested. I decided
    to stay until his smile faded, and propped myself against a pane of glass, having
    first twisted the dying janitor''s neck round slightly so I was still within his
    sight. It felt good to be doing something selfless for one who had trodden the
    path of janitordom before me. I pondered if this was what being a boy scout was
    all about. My only connection with the toggled tribe had been a single incident,
    in the year of the Tet Offensive, when I failed to stop a snackbar hooligan pushing
    a puny boy scout into a lake. I would have intervened, but I was preoccupied at
    the time with recalibrating a mechanism, one of my leisure pursuits in the days
    when I was an indolent janitor rather than the indefatigable one I became at the
    evaporated milk factory, when I no longer had time nor energy for leisure pursuits
    of any kind. Despite his puniness, the boy scout had passable swimming skills,
    and he managed to avoid drowning in the lake, a lake in which many had met a watery
    death. I knew this because their names were inscribed on a plaque affixed to a
    post at the edge of the lake, and I had bashed the post into the mud myself, with
    a hammer, one day many years before when I had nothing else to do. I used to roam
    the lakes and ponds and thereabouts with my hammer, looking for posts to bash
    into the muck. If I could not find any posts I became disconsolate and squatted
    on the nearest available tussock, sobbing, until it was time to wend my way home.

    I had plenty of time to dwell upon my past as I leaned against the pane of glass
    in the hot greenhouse, for the dying janitor''s smile never wavered. It seemed
    that he was so pleased with the crackers and with my lugubrious presence that
    he had entered a state of transcendent bliss. I was determined, however, to keep
    to my plan of staying with him until he was no longer smiling. I knew Mimsy Henbane
    would approve, and in a sense it was also a way of assuaging the guilt I still
    felt about failing to prevent the snackbar hooligan shoving that puny boy scout
    into the lake. That had happened many years before, as I have indicated, but as
    time passed my conscience gnawed at me with ever increasing ferocity. In those
    days, far from going to bed early, often I never went to bed at all, instead marching
    up and down countryside lanes all night, incapable of sleep. I was keeping the
    same hours as owls, and if nothing else that fraught insomniac period helped me
    to extend my ornithological education. If I was a pamphleteer like Dobson, rather
    than a janitor, I am sure I could churn out innumerable essays on owls and other
    nocturnal birds. As it is, I make do by buttonholing the occasional evaporated
    milk factory employee and sharing my bird-learning with them, whether they like
    it or not. It was a pity that the dying janitor was from Tantarabim, and wearing
    dentures far too big for his mouth, and thus would have been unintelligible to
    me were he to be prodded into speech, for there was something in his demeanour
    which told me that he, like me, was an erudite janitor. I could not guess what
    his area of expertise was, of course, so I made a mental note to ask Mimsy Henbane
    when next I called into the Charitable Board For Janitors Close To Death HQ.

    Mimsy''s journey from flapper to charitable board director was an extraordinary
    one. Her story has inspired poets, novelists, composers, film makers, and creative
    titans in just about any field you can think of, not least the designers of tee
    shirts worn by young Japanese trendies. Dennis Beerpint wrote a series of Cantos
    about her. Anthony Burgess struggled for years with a novel based on her life,
    but was forced to abandon it when he concluded that such a work was beyond his
    imaginative powers. An opera bouffe by Boof was inspired by her. Dan Brown is
    apparently working on a potboiler called The Mimsy Henbane Code. Before his untimely
    death, Rainer Werner Fassbinder planned a film about her set in a tough foreign
    dockyard full of tough homosexual sailors. The list goes on. Yet intriguingly,
    not one of the works based on her life ever addressed the root of her devotion
    to janitors close to death. There is always plenty about her flapperhood, and
    about the Antarctic expedition, the beekeeping, the shipwreck, the surgical interventions,
    the gladsome spring and the buffets of autumn, the postage stamp mystery, the
    years of crime, the gutta percha interlude, the bittersweet romances, the collapsed
    lung, the other collapsed lung, the delicate little fists beating hopelessly against
    wooden panels in the hut in the forest, the evil chickens, the gaudy boudoir,
    the Karen Carpenter incident, the vandalism, the scuba diving, the pitfalls, the
    obelisk, the gravel pathways, the euphonium band, the pint of milk, and the gruesome
    business in the tough foreign dockyard full of tough homosexual sailors. Yet of
    janitors, dying or otherwise, not one word. I know, because I''ve checked. Before
    I started working myself to exhaustion in the evaporated milk factory, I was able
    to spend some of my leisure time making a thorough study of all the Mimsy Henbane-related
    books and films and plays and opera bouffes and trendy Japanese tee shirts etcetera.
    From Beerpint to Burgess, from Boof to Brown, no creative titan deems janitors
    worthy of a mention. I try not to take this personally, and deny that I have poked
    pins into miniature wax effigies of any of those named, or of any others, such
    as Harrison Birtwistle and Salman Rushdie and the paperbackist Pebblehead, during
    spooky midnight ceremonies where I have been joined by jabbering chanting hooded
    bloodsoaked wild-eyed whirling drooling drugged-up maniacs. In any case, whatever
    lugubrious dismay I may feel towards those who have ignored my profession is more
    than outweighed by the fact that Mimsy Henbane herself devoted her latter years
    to my kind. And she did so selflessly, apart from the excessive fees she charged
    to those lucky enough to find a haven in one of her Mercy Homes, or in one of
    the greenhouses next to the pig sties in one of her Mercy Homes, and the extra
    charges she levied on the relicts of those janitors who, dying, died, and passed
    into the realm of which we know naught. So despite my hours of study, I am as
    clueless as the next janitor as to Mimsy''s motives. All I know is that she fully
    deserves my gratitude, and that is why I stood leaning against a pane of glass
    in that greenhouse while a dying janitor propped up in a collapsible medical chair,
    his hair slathered in boot polish and his dentures too big for his mouth, smiled
    at me for three whole days. I did it for Mimsy.

    I think what wiped the smile off his face at last was that he felt pangs of hunger
    for more crackers. He mumbled something at me in that weird, impossible Tantarabim
    accent, and pointed a bony finger at the empty cracker bag he had dropped on the
    floor. I told him that I would go to Old Ma Purgative''s clifftop superstore,
    a lengthy hike away, to get another bagful. I wondered if he would still be alive
    when I returned. As I turned to sweep out of the greenhouse as dramatically as
    I had entered, in my kingly raiment, he rummaged in a little wooden cupboard next
    to his chair, took out the Dobson pamphlet Tips For Janitors, and pressed it into
    my greedily outstretched hands.

    Over the next few days, as I made my slow lugubrious funereal bleak way towards
    the coast and the clifftop, I stopped from time to time to sprawl on bright summertime
    lawns and I read the out of print pamphlet from cover to cover. When I had finished
    it, I started again from the beginning. I was thunderstruck. In spite of my various
    milk-related janitorial posts, I felt I was reading about an entirely new and
    different calling, one of which I was profoundly ignorant. Between them, the dying
    janitor and Mimsy Henbane and Dobson changed my life.

    Eager as I was to become a reborn janitor at the earliest opportunity, I was mindful
    of my promise to the dying janitor in the greenhouse next to the pig sty. I had
    made him so happy with that bag of Extra Crunchy Hard Crunchable Crackers, and
    had vowed to fetch him another bag. Torn between duty and desire, I spent a miserable
    morning sobbing on a tussock. Then Fortune smiled upon me, just as the dying janitor
    had done, by sending into my path a boy scout. As puny as the one who, years before,
    I had seen pushed into a lake by a snackbar hooligan, the child appeared at the
    side of my tussock and inquired if I had a job for him to do in exchange for a
    shilling. I took his coinage and sent him off towards Old Ma Purgative''s clifftop
    superstore, having armed him with full instructions and a map, and his shilling
    back to pay for the crackers. Then I turned my face towards Pointy Town and headed
    for the evaporated milk factory, and a new life.'
