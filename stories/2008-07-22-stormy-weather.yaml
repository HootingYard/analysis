  text: 'James Joyce was terrified of thunder and lightning, and used to cower beneath
    a table during electrical storms.

    Dr Franklin first showed that lightning is the same as the electricity made by
    the electrical machine. As the electricity of the electrical machine is got by
    rubbing glass, so much of the electricity of the air is caused by the rubbing
    of moist air against dry air. A great deal is made by the turning into vapour
    or mist of the salt water of the ocean by the sun''s heat or by the blowing of
    the wind. More water is turned into vapour during the heat of summer and autumn
    than in winter, and this is why there is more lightning in warm than in cold weather.

    There is always a good deal of electricity in the air, and in clear weather it
    is generally positive electricity. But during fogs, rains, or snows it is usually
    negative electricity, though it changes often. It sometimes happens that two clouds,
    one charged with positive electricity and the other with negative electricity,
    come near each other, and then the two kinds of electricity rush together, when
    a flash of lightning is seen and thunder is heard.

    The lightning is the same thing as a spark from an electrical machine, the only
    difference being that a flash of lightning is sometimes several miles long and
    the spark only a few inches. The little spark gives out only a snapping sound,
    but if we were able to make a spark as large as a flash of lightning it would
    cause as much noise as thunder.

    When a cloud filled with one kind of electricity comes near the earth while the
    earth is filled with electricity of the opposite kind, the cloud may discharge
    its electricity to the earth. If any tall object, such as a tree, a steeple, or
    a house, happens to be near where the cloud discharges, the electricity will often
    pass down it to the earth. In this way houses are sometimes injured and set on
    fire, and great trees are blasted into tiny pieces. Sometimes, too, human beings
    and beasts of the field are struck and killed. It is not safe, therefore, to stand
    under a tree or close to a high house during a thunderstorm. James Joyce was safe
    enough cowering beneath his table.

    We see lightning in several different forms. Sometimes its flash is straight,
    sometimes it is forked or zig-zag, sometimes it is round like a ball, and sometimes
    it spreads over the clouds like a sheet of fire. When a thunder-cloud is near
    the earth the flash comes straight down to the earth, because there is but little
    air for it to pass through, but when the cloud is at a considerable distance from
    the earth, the air in the path of the lightning is made denser or thicker by being
    pushed together, and as lightning can pass quicker through thin than through thick
    air, it flies from side to side so as to pass where the air is thinnest. Thus
    its path is zig-zag or forked. When there is a very great charge of electricity
    in a cloud it sometimes forces its way through the air in the shape of a ball.
    What is called sheet lightning is either the reflection or shine on clouds of
    a stroke of zig-zag lightning which is too far off to be seen, or light discharges
    of electricity from clouds which have not enough to cause zig-zag lightning.

    When lightning passes through air it leaves behind it a vacuum--that is, an empty
    place--and the air rushing in to fill it makes the noise which is called thunder
    (ukkonen in Finnish). We do not usually hear this until some time after the flash
    of lightning, because light travels more than a million times faster than sound.
    Both light and sound travel incredibly faster than a human being, James Joyce,
    say, taking a stroll in the streets of Trieste. When the thunder-cloud is at a
    distance, the sound comes to us little by little, and it is then called rolling
    thunder, just like one of Bob Dylan''s concert tours in the 1970s. But when the
    cloud is near the earth the sound comes in one almighty crash. We can generally
    tell how far off a thunder-cloud is by noting how much time elapses between the
    flash of lightning and the sound of the thunder. If we can count to five as slowly
    as the ticktocking of a clock between the two, it is certain that the cloud is
    more than a mile away, and we can probably come out from beneath the table, if
    that is where we have gone to cower.

    Lightning, in its way to the earth, will always follow the best conductor, and
    when it strikes a building or a tree it will leap from side to side to find it.
    It likes pointy things rather than blunt or rounded things, and this is why lightning
    rods have sharp points. Buildings properly fitted with lightning rods are safe
    from being struck by lightning, because the rods lead off the electricity into
    the earth. When a cloud filled with electricity comes over the rods, the electricity
    will flow silently down them until the cloud is discharged, and we see no flash
    and hear no thunder. We can feel sure the building will not be struck. The tops
    of lightning rods are usually made of silver or are gilded, so that they may not
    rust and thus become worthless. The lower end of the rod must be carried down
    into damp earth. If the earth is dry it is better to carry the end of the rod
    into a well, because dry earth is not so good a conductor as moist earth, and
    the lightning might leap from the rod at the lower end and go into the cellar
    of the building. High chimneys should have lightning rods on them, because the
    soot in them is a good conductor, as is also the vapour which rises from them
    when fires are burning.

    The word lightning in Finnish is salama. A flash of lightning is salaman leimahdus.'
