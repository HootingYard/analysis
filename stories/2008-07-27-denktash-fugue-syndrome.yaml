  text: 'Mrs Gubbins, the octogenarian crone given to knitting and villainy, has recently
    come under the supervision of a doctor. It will not be too long before she becomes
    a nonagenarian crone, and though she is in terrifyingly tiptop health for one
    so aged, there have been signs that all is not well. First there was the abduction
    of Little Severin, the Mystic Badger, after which she went on the run for several
    months, holed up in a dank cave guarded by bats and owls. This was followed by
    her becoming smitten by the unlikely figure of Mark E Smith, and her habit of
    playing the complete works of The Fall at ear-splitting volume on a brand new
    Bang & Olufbangbangbang hi-fi system, with her windows open, at all hours of the
    day and night. A dawn visit from Blunkett and Blears, respectively sightless and
    diminutive, and somehow all the more minatory for being so, set her back on the
    straight and narrow.

    A couple of weeks ago, La Gubbins'' knitting circle invited Rolf Harris to give
    a talk. Unable to attend, yet honoured to be asked, Harris instead sent a tape
    recording of an entertaining address in which he spoke for some hours about various
    Rolfs and Ralphs and Rafes and Raufs. Fatefully, at one point he mentioned the
    name of Rauf Denktash, the one-time President of the Turkish Republic of Northern
    Cyprus. Hearing those two syllables, denk and tash, together, Mrs Gubbins was
    propelled into a fugue state, from which she has yet to emerge.

    Denktash Fugue Syndrome is a thankfully rare condition, so rare that Mrs Gubbins
    is only the second person in history to display the symptoms. It was first identified
    by the Victorian mountaineer and eccentric Dr Henry Hyde Hargreaves Hopton Hibbingdibhoondoon
    during a sojourn in Tashkent. The journals in which he wrote of his discovery
    have long been lost, or disfigured by potato mould, depending on who you believe,
    but the basic facts were retailed by Dobson in one of his early pamphlets. Atop
    a Tashkent mountain one day in 1862, the doctor''s brain was ravaged by mysterious
    fumes, and, when he tried to say "Tashkent" it came out as "Denktash". With him
    upon the peak was a dumpy, bearded sage, a man not unlike the Beatles'' pal the
    Maharishi in appearance, who, when he heard the word "Denktash", was sent into
    a fugue state. In his journal, Hibbingdibhoondoon spelled it "foog", but it is
    clear what he meant.

    What remains unclear is for how long the sage remained so affected. Dobson''s
    account simply peters out, in that annoying way he had, and which can make his
    early works such a trial to read. Also unclear is the nature of the fugue itself.
    In Mrs Gubbins'' case, it appears to take the form of dribbling, staring vacantly
    into the fireplace, and absentmindedly unravelling not only the tea cosy she has
    herself been in the midst of knitting but also those of her companeros in the
    knitting circle.

    Doctor Drainditch, who has been called in to treat the loveable yet spiky crone,
    claims to be the only living expert on Denktash Fugue Syndrome. Unfortunately,
    the treatment she recommends consists of a two-week retreat in a dank cave guarded
    by bats and owls with an abducted badger for company, followed by a therapeutic
    course of listening to the complete works of The Fall at ear-splitting volume.
    So round and round we go, it seems.

    If you, or anybody close to you, is suffering from Denktash Fugue Syndrome, there
    is a helpline number available. Premium rates apply, and if you manage to get
    through you might be lucky enough to hear a pre-recorded message from Rolf Harris
    telling you not to worry yourself sick. All callers are entered in a raffle, with
    the chance to win one of Mrs Gubbins'' tea cosy knitting patterns. You must tell
    your parents before placing the call, and if your parents have passed to the ethereal
    realm beyond our puny understanding, there is a range of ouija boards and ectoplasmic
    goo on special offer at Hubermann''s department store.'
