  text: 'After I posted the piece entitled Denktash Fugue Syndrome, in which mention
    is made of Mrs Gubbins and her knitted tea cosies, I was deluged with mail from
    younger readers who complained that they had no idea what I was talking about.
    The general tone of these missives was along the lines of "Oi, Mr Key, what in
    the name of heaven is a tea cosy, for crying out loud, innit?"

    It would appear that today''s youth have been seduced by something called "tea
    in a bag", and no longer make use of teapots and, thus, of tea cosies. This is
    a sorry state of affairs. However, here at Hooting Yard we occasionally make attempts
    to be "with it" and "groovy", so we decided to track down some of these so-called
    "tea bags" and see what all the fuss is about.

    Our delegated rapporteur, decked out in trendy East European clothing, strode
    manfully into an indoor retail-and-leisure consumer park and, selecting a boutique
    at random, went up to a counter and said, politely yet forcefully, "I would like
    a bag with tea in it, please". He had chosen an inappropriate boutique to make
    such a request, however, for the only bags for sale at this counter were empty
    ones, with handles, made of leather or plastic or cotton or the pelts of various
    endangered animals. Surmising, not unreasonably, that bag and tea had to be purchased
    separately, our doughty rapporteur picked from the display a small dimity pippy
    bag and, having paid the criminally expensive asking price with his Hooting Yard
    Card(tm), made off along the rattling pneumatic pedestrian express walkarama in
    search of somewhere to buy tea.

    Locating an emporium packed to the gills with grocery items, our chap hunted the
    aisles until he found a cardboard box of shredded tea leaves. After paying for
    this at a bleeping self-service console, he wasted no time in ripping open the
    box with his gnarled fingers, until it looked as if it had been savaged by a squirrel.
    He then poured the contents of the box into the pippy bag.

    The next step was to eke from the bag a lovely cup of piping hot tea, so our rapporteur
    repaired to a yard where he knew he would find an outside spigot. Holding the
    pippy bag open under the spigot, he filled it with brackish water, then zipped
    it shut. He then caught the bus back to Haemoglobin Towers, where Mrs Gubbins
    was waiting with her array of giant bunsen burners. Using a contraption of coat-hangers
    to suspend the pippy bag over the fearsome flames, crone and rapporteur waited
    for the tell-tale sight of steam escaping from the partly-unzipped bag to alert
    them that the bag''s innards were coming to the boil. From there, it was a simple
    matter of detaching the bag from its coat-hangers and placing it under a tea cosy.
    Of course, Mrs Gubbins used a pair of heat-resistant padded mittens to perform
    this action.

    Giving the infusion a few minutes to brew, the rapporteur then borrowed the mittens
    from La Gubbins, fully unzipped the pippy bag, and upturned it, sloshing the tea
    inside into a couple of dainty tea cups. There was a little spillage, but that
    was soon mopped up by a passing factotum armed with a mop and a pail. A dash of
    milk added, and the duo sat on a threadbare ottoman to enjoy their well-earned
    cuppa.

    All in all, and in spite of the sterling efforts of both the rapporteur and Mrs
    Gubbins, this seems to be a frankly foolish way of obtaining a cup of tea, and
    it is not an experiment we will be repeating.'
