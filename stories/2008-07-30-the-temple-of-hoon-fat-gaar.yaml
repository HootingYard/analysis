  text: "Because it was constructed mostly from canvas and cloth, and the canvas and\
    \ cloth were fed on by moths, the Temple Of Hoon Fat Gaar is sometimes known as\
    \ the Moth-eaten Temple Of Hoon Fat Gaar. Ravaged by moths and time, and lashed\
    \ by wild winds that blow across the tarputa, it is a wonder the temple still\
    \ stands, a thousand years after the first devotees entered it through the sacred\
    \ flap. It has of course been much patched and stitched over the centuries, and\
    \ its fabric is regularly stiffened with starch, carried in canisters for miles\
    \ upon miles by worshippers of the hideous bat-god Fatso. For it is He to whom\
    \ the temple is dedicated.\nThe wild winds that lash and batter the temple are\
    \ meteorologically very interesting indeed. Students of the weather have been\
    \ perplexed by them ever since modern wild wind studies began. Before our scientific\
    \ age, of course, the sheer weirdness of the winds that blow across the tarputa\
    \ was ascribed to the mercurial and petulant nature of the hideous bat-god Fatso,\
    \ for it was thought that He was responsible for them, as He was for everything\
    \ in the universe. We are wiser now, but no closer to getting to grips with the\
    \ wild lashing winds.\nThose who still believe in Fatso have a simple explanation.\
    \ For them, the winds are the physical manifestation of the temperament of Fatso's\
    \ magic pig. Actually, He has two magic pigs, but we can safely ignore one of\
    \ them for a moment or two. The idea is that this particular pig\u2014which, it\
    \ must be understood, is not a real pig in any sense\u2014somehow sends the winds\
    \ howling across the tarputa whenever it is fractious or hungry or obstreperous\
    \ or maddened or otherwise out of sorts. Why the hideous bat-god Fatso does nothing\
    \ to placate His magic pig is an ineffable mystery. The religion dedicated to\
    \ Him is short on theologians of any stripe, although one of the few to have addressed\
    \ the problem contended that Fatso spent much of his time pacifying the other\
    \ magic pig, which, if ever it fully awakened, would make the wild winds that\
    \ batter the temple seem like tiny pipsqueak gusts of summer breeze. Other so-called\
    \ scholars argued that this implied the other magic pig was somehow more powerful\
    \ than Fatso Himself, a clear heresy, so the first theologian was put in a crusher\
    \ and crushed.\nThere used to be at least five crushers on the mud plain around\
    \ the Temple Of Hoon Fat Gaar, so we must assume that there were plenty of heretics\
    \ to be crushed. Occasionally, a bright young whippersnapper archaeologist will\
    \ announce plans for a dig at the site, hoping to exhume a fantastical hoard of\
    \ crushed bones, but not one of these schemes ever succeeds. It is said that Fatso\
    \ Himself sabotages the expeditions, by causing shipwrecks and helicopter crashes\
    \ and by pickling the archaeologists\u2019 brains while they sleep. In these ploys\
    \ he calls on the assistance of his flock of bitterns. Unlike the two pigs, the\
    \ bitterns are not magical, but nor, of course, are they real. They are phantom,\
    \ spectral bitterns, beholden to Fatso for some service He did them in the distant\
    \ past. We cannot guess what that might have been, for it is a topic suspiciously\
    \ neglected by all the priests and wizards and jumping-about men who interpret\
    \ Fatso to his followers. Or, I should say, who used to do so. There are none\
    \ of them left alive today, at least none that we know of. Believers in Fatso\
    \ are a dwindling band, often greasy and myopic and spindly and gormless. They\
    \ tend to lack \xE9lan. Most of them, probably, would be crushed in the crushers\
    \ if the crushers were still there, because one thing we can be quite clear about\
    \ the hideous bat-god Fatso is that He expected His devotees to cut a dash. There\
    \ may have been few opportunities for glittering social panache on the prehistoric\
    \ tarputa, especially with those wild winds, but what rare chances there were\
    \ were seized on by Fatso's followers. Great attention was paid to the angles\
    \ of hats, the tying of cravats, and affectations of toffee-nosed insouciance.\
    \ This is not to discount a concomitant yearning for the mud, encouraged by one\
    \ of the magic pigs.\nSo today there are few who haul their canisters of starch\
    \ for miles and miles to stiffen the moth-eaten canvas and cloth of the Temple\
    \ Of Hoon Fat Gaar. Perhaps in a hundred years there will be none at all. Yet\
    \ Fatso himself will still, as far as He is concerned, hold sway over the universe,\
    \ and His magic pig will still make the wild winds blow, and His other, even more\
    \ frightening magic pig will doze and slumber, dreaming of havoc. It is easy for\
    \ us to dismiss their very existence. Until, that is, we have struggled, stylishly,\
    \ across the inhospitable tarputa, and stooped down to crawl through the sacred\
    \ flap, to enter the Temple. Then we see what all those believers through the\
    \ centuries saw, a sight so magnificent and terrifying that we sprawl helplessly\
    \ in the mud, shrieking, brains bedizened, gaga for the god of all gods."
