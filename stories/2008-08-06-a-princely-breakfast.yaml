  text: "Yesterday I was very pleased to be a guest writer at the IGGY Summer U. The\
    \ students on the creative writing course, aged 13 to 16, were charming, enthusiastic,\
    \ creative and full of ideas. One of the things I shared with them was the inspirational\
    \ joy of cryptic crossword clues. Forget about trying to solve them (that is a\
    \ separate pleasure), just treat them as phrases cut loose from any context, in\
    \ which case they can act as starting points for pieces of prose.\n\u201CPrince\
    \ enters flat of major\u201D was one of the clues in yesterday's Guardian crossword,\
    \ and I wrote a short piece inspired by it.\nPrince Fulgencio's entourage\u2014\
    all clanking armour and burnished golden helmets\u2014gathered in the corridor\
    \ outside the dingy flat wherein Major Blenkinsop lurked. The brevet captain of\
    \ the entourage rapped on the door, thrice, before the more brutish and sullen\
    \ members of the entourage kicked it down and stomped into the flat, roaring their\
    \ heads off and unleashing a flock of half-starved starlings to sow havoc and\
    \ confusion. Thus was the necessary atmosphere created for Prince Fulgencio's\
    \ entrance. He had come to have breakfast with the Major, and wanted to eat his\
    \ cornflakes and doughballs while watching starlings peck the wallpaper off the\
    \ walls. That was the kind of Prince he was, especially at breakfast time."
