  text: 'Yesterday I was very pleased to be a guest writer at the IGGY Summer U. The
    students on the creative writing course, aged 13 to 16, were charming, enthusiastic,
    creative and full of ideas. One of the things I shared with them was the inspirational
    joy of cryptic crossword clues. Forget about trying to solve them (that is a separate
    pleasure), just treat them as phrases cut loose from any context, in which case
    they can act as starting points for pieces of prose.

    "Prince enters flat of major" was one of the clues in yesterday''s Guardian crossword,
    and I wrote a short piece inspired by it.

    Prince Fulgencio''s entourage--all clanking armour and burnished golden helmets--gathered
    in the corridor outside the dingy flat wherein Major Blenkinsop lurked. The brevet
    captain of the entourage rapped on the door, thrice, before the more brutish and
    sullen members of the entourage kicked it down and stomped into the flat, roaring
    their heads off and unleashing a flock of half-starved starlings to sow havoc
    and confusion. Thus was the necessary atmosphere created for Prince Fulgencio''s
    entrance. He had come to have breakfast with the Major, and wanted to eat his
    cornflakes and doughballs while watching starlings peck the wallpaper off the
    walls. That was the kind of Prince he was, especially at breakfast time.'
