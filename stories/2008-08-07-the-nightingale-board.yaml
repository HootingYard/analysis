  text: 'For most of us, the words "Nightingale Board" call to mind that empanelled
    panel of eminent persons who devote valuable time to the counting and measuring
    and tallying and calculating of nightingales and nightingale populations, their
    habitats, flight patterns, wingspans, song variations and much else that is nightingale-related,
    sometimes tangentially. I have been meaning to write about the Nightingale Board
    for some time now, and regret the distractions of voodoo pig husbandry, ditch
    digging, aimless lolloping and despair which have prevented me from doing so.
    What I had in mind was to do a comparative study of the Nightingale Board and
    the Hummingbird Board, the latter an equally tireless band of empanelled persons
    who count and measure and tally and calculate all things hummingbird-related.
    I had, in fact, set aside this morning to attack the project with vim and verve,
    having farmed out the voodoo pig husbandry and ditch digging to a paid companion,
    made a promise to myself not to lollop, aimlessly or otherwise, and countered
    despair by drinking an infusion of Baxter''s Perky-Uppy Expectorant Fluid. After
    vomiting into an iron pail, I planned to sit down and bash out thousands of words
    on both the Nightingale Board and the Hummingbird Board.

    Alas! As I wiped my chin with a rag, the postie brought a letter from Hooting
    Yard reader Roland Clare, drawing my attention to a completely different Nightingale
    Board. Mr Clare has borrowed from his brother a book entitled Small Homes And
    How To Furnish Them by Mrs Waldemar Leverton, published in London in 1903 by C
    Arthur Pearson Ltd.


    With great diligence, Mr Clare has executed some photorealist pencil drawings
    of selected paragraphs from the book, the first of which tells us about this other
    Nightingale Board:


    Elsewhere in the book there is a splendid passage instructing the reader on the
    important matter of toy owl construction:


    According to Mr Clare, it is thought that "Mrs Waldemar Leverton" is a pseudonym,
    an anagram of the name of the true author of this excellent book, the Rev. Lowland
    Stammerer. Intriguingly, that godly man was a founder member of the very first
    Nightingale Board to be empanelled in his bailiwick. He may also have been involved
    in the Hummingbird Board, though my researches into that must sadly be postponed
    yet again, for I must lollop aimlessly now, in despair, while my paid companion
    husbands voodoo pigs and digs a ditch.'
