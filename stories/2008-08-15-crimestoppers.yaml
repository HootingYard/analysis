  text: "Elberry at The Lumber Room has an excellent solution to feral youths and\
    \ knife crime:\nI imagine there are several thousand, or hundreds of thousands,\
    \ of young men carrying knives \u2018in self-defence\u2019 who will, however,\
    \ pull it as soon as they imagine a confrontation is in the air. They would be\
    \ far better to carry expandable batons, and far less likely to accidentally kill\
    \ someone. They would do even better to stay at home reading Sir Philip Sidney.\n\
    Personally, I would recommend The Anatomy Of Melancholy, but just staying indoors,\
    \ reading improving literature, seems to me a splendid idea."
