  text: 'Here are a few useful things I learned while reading Buchanan''s Journal
    Of Man, Volume 1 Number 4, published in May 1887:

    "Pianos have lately been made from paper in Germany, instead of wood, with great
    improvement in the tone."

    "There is no denying that the young man about town of the nineteenth century is
    a blot upon our boasted modern civilization. His is not a pleasant figure to contemplate,
    though it is one that we all see very often and know very well--clothed irreproachably
    in the most expensive raiment that London tailors and unlimited credit can supply.
    He lives lazily and luxuriously on his father''s money and his wife''s, and, being
    after his natural term of days laid away in a tomb at Mt. Auburn, ends his existence
    without making any more impression upon the world''s history than a falling rose
    leaf, or an August cricket''s faintest chirp."

    "In 1885 we were informed of the success of spirits at Cleveland, Ohio, in communicating
    messages by the telegraphic method in rapping, in which our millionaire friend,
    Mr. J. H. Wade, has taken much interest. A little apparatus has been constructed,
    with which the spirits give their communications in great variety. I have repeatedly
    stated that the diagnoses and prescriptions of deceased physicians have always
    proved in my experience more reliable than those of the living. This has been
    verified at Cleveland. The late Dr. Wells of Brooklyn has been giving diagnoses
    and prescriptions through the telegraph."

    I think we can agree with the correspondent of the Vineland Rostrum, who said
    of the Journal''s editor J R Buchanan "We never read an article from the pen of
    this world-renowned thinker, but that we feel we are in the presence of one whose
    shoes'' latchet we are unworthy to unloose".

    Many thanks to Odd Ends.'
