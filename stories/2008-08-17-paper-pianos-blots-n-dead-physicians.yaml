  text: "Here are a few useful things I learned while reading Buchanan's Journal Of\
    \ Man, Volume 1 Number 4, published in May 1887:\n\u201CPianos have lately been\
    \ made from paper in Germany, instead of wood, with great improvement in the tone.\u201D\
    \n\u201CThere is no denying that the young man about town of the nineteenth century\
    \ is a blot upon our boasted modern civilization. His is not a pleasant figure\
    \ to contemplate, though it is one that we all see very often and know very well\u2014\
    clothed irreproachably in the most expensive raiment that London tailors and unlimited\
    \ credit can supply. He lives lazily and luxuriously on his father's money and\
    \ his wife's, and, being after his natural term of days laid away in a tomb at\
    \ Mt. Auburn, ends his existence without making any more impression upon the world's\
    \ history than a falling rose leaf, or an August cricket's faintest chirp.\u201D\
    \n\u201CIn 1885 we were informed of the success of spirits at Cleveland, Ohio,\
    \ in communicating messages by the telegraphic method in rapping, in which our\
    \ millionaire friend, Mr. J. H. Wade, has taken much interest. A little apparatus\
    \ has been constructed, with which the spirits give their communications in great\
    \ variety. I have repeatedly stated that the diagnoses and prescriptions of deceased\
    \ physicians have always proved in my experience more reliable than those of the\
    \ living. This has been verified at Cleveland. The late Dr. Wells of Brooklyn\
    \ has been giving diagnoses and prescriptions through the telegraph.\u201D\nI\
    \ think we can agree with the correspondent of the Vineland Rostrum, who said\
    \ of the Journal's editor J R Buchanan \u201CWe never read an article from the\
    \ pen of this world-renowned thinker, but that we feel we are in the presence\
    \ of one whose shoes\u2019 latchet we are unworthy to unloose\u201D.\nMany thanks\
    \ to Odd Ends."
