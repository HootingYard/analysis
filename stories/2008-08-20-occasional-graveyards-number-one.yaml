  text: 'The first in our Occasional Graveyards series is a shrine to a graveyard
    rather than a graveyard as such. You can read about the Cross Bones Graveyard
    here. It is about five minutes walk from the ResonanceFM studio on Borough High
    Street, so next time you listen to Hooting Yard On The Air, bear in mind that
    Mr Key may well have been pondering the Eternal Verities at the shrine just beforehand,
    or possibly soon afterwards. The photographs were taken by Pansy Cradledew, who
    has not posted them on a flickr page, because she''s not that kind of girl.
