  text: "The first in our Occasional Graveyards series is a shrine to a graveyard\
    \ rather than a graveyard as such. You can read about the Cross Bones Graveyard\
    \ here. It is about five minutes walk from the ResonanceFM studio on Borough High\
    \ Street, so next time you listen to Hooting Yard On The Air, bear in mind that\
    \ Mr Key may well have been pondering the Eternal Verities at the shrine just\
    \ beforehand, or possibly soon afterwards. The photographs were taken by Pansy\
    \ Cradledew, who has not posted them on a flickr page, because she's not that\
    \ kind of girl.\n\n\_\n\n\n\n"
