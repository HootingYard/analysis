  text: "An entertaining letter arrives in the Haemoglobin Towers postbox from, I\
    \ think, the United States. It is headed \"The Hooting Yard Effect\", and sounds\
    \ a cautionary note for podcast listeners. Here it is, in full:\nDear Mr. Key,\n\
    In late May of this year, I was pointed toward Hooting Yard (in the metaphorical\
    \ sense of having the Hooting Yard podcast suggested to me as an enjoyable listening\
    \ experience, as opposed to the more literal sense of being given directions to\
    \ the physical location of Hooting Yard). After listening to a few shows, and\
    \ being introduced to the works of Dobson, Blodgett, and Pebblehead, learning\
    \ about Bonkers Maisie, Marigold Chew, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, Mrs. Gubbins,\
    \ and diminutive adventuress Tiny Enid, and being exposed to some highly suspect,\
    \ albeit scrupulously alphabetical, soup recipes, I felt a bit lost and resolved\
    \ that perhaps if I listened to the complete archive of Hooting Yard shows, I\
    \ might gain a more thorough understanding of the world of Hooting Yard, and possibly\
    \ even learn how to spell \"Bibblybibdib's.\"\nI have now completed my task, and\
    \ in the space of little more than two months, have listened to all 140 shows\
    \ that I was able to find on the internet. Whether or not this effort has noticeably\
    \ improved my understanding of Hooting Yard, its environs, and inhabitants is\
    \ a matter open for debate. However, I have noticed an unusual side effect of\
    \ absorbing so much Hooting Yard over so little a time: I find that my \"internal\
    \ voice,\" when applied to odd bits of prose I come across in the course of the\
    \ day, now sounds exactly like Frank Key.\nFor example, I was recently in San\
    \ Diego, California. In want of something to do, wandering the Old Town section,\
    \ I happened across an old, restored cemetery. Most of the graves were marked\
    \ by blank wooden crosses, with small interpretive signs made of deteriorating\
    \ photocopied text sandwiched between glass plates. One of these signs read, as\
    \ best as I can recall:\nTHE UNKNOWN GERMAN\nThis grave marks the resting place\
    \ of the Unknown German. This man came to San Diego from Germany in 18- [terminal\
    \ digits illegible]. Very little is known about his life here. How and why he\
    \ came to San Diego, as well as how he died, is unknown.\"\nI read this, silently,\
    \ to myself. But the voice I heard was plainly Frank Key's. This doesn't happen\
    \ with newspaper articles, magazine stories, street signs, short stories, or novels.\
    \ It occurs only when I read unusual bits of prose like that above. I would caution\
    \ any other Hooting Yard listener contemplating ingesting a large amount of your\
    \ shows in a short period of time. The effect, while not unpleasant, is unusual.\n\
    Thank you for the hours of entertainment you've provided.\nVery respectfully,\n\
    \  Dr Jeffrey Chilton"
