  text: 'I had to go and see a man about a lozenge, but he was at a tangent. He suggested
    I take a wafer. I have written elsewhere, at some length, about wafers, and I
    do not intend to repeat that pretty little escapade, not when I am standing at
    the bottom of a staircase down which I fully expect a ghoul to traipse. Upon the
    descent of the ghoul, I shall climb the staircase myself and enter the chamber
    from which it has been expelled.

    My arrival may well cause consternation. A ghoul leaves, and almost immediately
    afterwards a chubby man wearing filthy gloves appears. When I use the word ''chubby''
    I am referring to my inner chubby man, you understand, my shadow self, the man
    I would be in my dreams.

    I do not know who awaits me in the upper chamber, although I now know that whoever
    it is will half expect me to be carrying a wafer. I can use the filthiness of
    my gloves as an excuse for not doing so. It is an excuse I have flourished on
    many occasions, not always successfully. Like the ghoul, I have been expelled
    from chambers and attics and parlours and even from cow sheds.

    But I will not be expelled from the chamber at the top of the staircase, for it
    is written that I shall dwell therein, unto the last trump. I am waiting for the
    ghoul to be thrust out, all dignity rinsed out of it, out out out, and then I
    shall rise up, a chubby man puffing up the staircase, and I shall take possession
    of my final chamber.'
