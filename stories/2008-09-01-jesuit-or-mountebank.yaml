  text: 'Over at BibliOdyssey, Peacay has a fantastic quotation from Robert Payne,
    in a letter to Gilbert Sheldon written in 1650:

    "The truth is, this Jesuit, as generally the most of his order, have a great ambition
    to be thoughte the greate and learned men of the world; and to that end writes
    greate volumes, on all subjects, with gay pictures and diagrams to set them forth,
    for ostentation And to fill up those volumes, they draw in all things, by head
    and shoulders; and these too for the most part, stolen from other authors. So
    that if that little, which is their owne, were separated from what is borrowed
    from others, or impertinent to their present arguments, their swollen volumes
    would shrink up to the size of our Almanacks. But enough of these Mountebankes."'
