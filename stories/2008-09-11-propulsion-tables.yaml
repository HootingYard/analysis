  text: 'When consulting propulsion tables, it is extremely important that you know
    exactly what you are looking at. This is all the more so since there are two different
    sets of propulsion tables in circulation, the popular Blotzmann Propulsion Tables
    and the somewhat arcane Non-Blotzmann Propulsion Tables. Both sets are widely
    available, either as booklets or as loose-leaf plastic sheets which can be propped
    on a little hands-free propulsion table-holding tripod. Of course, both the Blotzmann
    and Non-Blotzmann tables give pretty much the same results, depending on the precise
    nature of your experiment, and even some of our most top-drawer propulsionists
    have gone on record to say that they do not give two pins which set of propulsion
    tables they use. But there is slightly more to it than that.

    It is hardly surprising that Blotzmann himself execrated the Non-Blotzmann tables
    in rather fruity language. I would quote him directly, were it not that my upbringing
    makes me prefer the thought of throwing myself into the path of a speeding train
    rather than uttering some of the fruitier words in Blotzmann''s lexicon. Sheltered
    it may have been, and riddled with priests, but I make no apologies for the way
    I was brought up. Yes, I may blush when I read language like that spat from the
    mouth of Blotzmann, but that does not make me a bad person, merely, I would aver,
    one who does not wish to be sullied and besmirched. The Blotzmanns of this world
    may scoff at one of my refined sensibilities, and god knows they do, but I shall
    not waver. That is why I will not repeat the verbal abuse Blotzmann poured down
    upon the begetter of the Non-Blotzmann Propulsion Tables. You will just have to
    take my word that he condemned them absolutely.

    Given the popularity and effectiveness of Blotzmann''s own propulsion tables in
    calculating all kinds of propulsiony matters, it is common to find people asking
    why the Non-Blotzmann set was ever devised in the first place. Oh, I don''t mean
    that you will be asked such a question while waiting at a bus stop or trudging
    along the high street or when you pop into the newsagent to buy a packet of cheap
    Lithuanian cigarettes. But at any gathering of propulsionists, for example at
    a cocktail party held to celebrate the publication in an important academic journal
    of a new paper on a knotty propulsion problem, or in the queue for the toilets
    at an award ceremony for a propulsionist who has won a ribbon or a medal, you
    can bet that someone present will pipe up with the old question of why on earth
    the Non-Blotzmann Propulsion Tables were not only created, but published in great
    quantities, in innumerable editions and formats, and often included a picture
    of Blotzmann on the cover which was deliberately scribbled upon or otherwise defaced.
    It is as if he is some kind of Stalin figure, wielding limitless power, who must
    be deposed for the greater good. Perhaps there is an element of truth in this.
    After all, Blotzmann was a commanding figure in the world of propulsion, with
    a deafeningly loud voice, the constitution of a bison, and a tendency, at conferences,
    to wear dazzling suits dotted with badges made from semi-precious metals. He had
    a curious way of carrying himself, such that even when sprawled half-asleep in
    a chaise longue, his belly full of cognac, he looked as if he was standing upon
    a plinth, gazing into a brighter future. And of course, since his death in that
    unfortunate picnicking accident, statues of him have sprung up wherever one looks,
    or at least wherever one looks in propulsionist circles, and it cannot be denied
    that a sort of personality cult has arisen in his wake.

    It is also true that the person or persons who devised the Non-Blotzmann Propulsion
    Tables remain, to this day, completely anonymous. I had hoped, when I sat down
    to write this article, to reveal to the world their identity. Then we could at
    least refer, along with the Blotzmann Propulsion Tables, to, say, the Huffington
    or Widdecombe or Blunkett-Blears Propulsion Tables, instead of having to use that
    frankly irritating Non-Blotzmann formulation. It saddens me, immeasurably so,
    that I cannot make good on my intention. I have, you see, been "got at", by dark
    and sinister forces within the propulsionist community. Tomorrow morning at dawn
    I begin work in the salt mines. It will, I suppose, be something of a novelty
    to give lectures on propulsion to salt miners as they hack away with their picks
    and shovels, although I am fearful that the language deployed by salt miners is
    a sight more fruity than the language used by Blotzmann in his denunciation of
    the Non-Blotzmann Propulsion Tables. Wise, I think, to pack a pair of earplugs
    in my pippy bag, to protect my delicate sensibilities, for which, I repeat, I
    refuse to apologise.'
