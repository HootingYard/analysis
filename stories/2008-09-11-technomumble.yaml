  text: Mr Key is averse to the habit of computer boffins to constantly tweak and
    fiddle with software, even if there may be good reasons for doing so. But as you
    can see, Hooting Yard is undergoing some form of WordPress "upgrade", so things
    may look a bit odd for a few days until the new fanglements have been ironed out.
    Bear with me.
