  text: 'The engine of capitalism is said to be the creation of desires. Advertising
    and allied brain-manipulation techniques persuade us to covet things we did not
    even know we wanted, and illusory wants soon become needs. Sprawling insouciantly
    in my ivory tower, it is very easy to pretend that I am above such grimness. For
    example, I do not own--nor covet--a mobile phone, and would much rather curl up
    with a copy of Jubilate Agno by Christopher Smart than go shopping for fripperies.
    But of course, such pretence is delusional. I am as eager as anyone else to get
    my hands on stuff, depending on the stuff. Thus I am indebted to OutaSpaceman
    for drawing my attention to a product which I did not know existed, but realise
    I have always wanted, no, needed. I can say in all honesty that without this magnificent
    item my life would remain forever incomplete, pointless, wasted.











    I speak, of course, of the cardboard cut-out model of the Hindenburg disaster,
    available here.'
