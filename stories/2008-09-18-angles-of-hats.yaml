  text: "This is a transcript of a handwritten piece read today on Hooting Yard On\
    \ The Air on ResonanceFM. If you do not already keep your bakelite wireless tuned\
    \ in to the station twenty four hours a day, for god's sake get a grip!\nIt occured\
    \ to me to write something on the bus on the way to the studio, to give this week's\
    \ show a really contemporary feel. I know that Hooting Yard listeners rightly\
    \ expect a programme that has its finger on the pulse of the times, that is truly\
    \ up to the minute. Well, this week it certainly is, because what I am reading\
    \ to you was written within the past hour.\nAnd I am reading it with some difficulty,\
    \ actually, because a bus journey does not lend itself to the practice of exquisite\
    \ copperplate handwriting. I am trying to make sense of what can only be described\
    \ as a semi-legible scrawl. Buses bump and clatter and shake, and at times it\
    \ is akin to being a sock or a napkin in a tumble drier.\nGod, this is dull. Let\
    \ me turn to another, non-bus-related topic.\nRecently I referred in passing to\
    \ my Flemish cheesecloth suit, and as a result I received letters from several\
    \ listeners who, showing great good sense, sought my advice on matters of style\
    \ and fashion, of dash and \xE9lan. Strikingly, no fewer than four of these letters\
    \ concerned the wearing of hats at a rakish angle.\n\u201CDear Frank,\u201D wrote\
    \ one listener, somewhat over-familiarly, given that I have no idea who he is,\
    \ \u201CCan you tell me how best to calculate the exact angle at which I should\
    \ wear my hat, or titfer, to maximise its rakishness?\u201D\nWell, for that correspondent,\
    \ and for the others who raised this important issue, I am preparing a small pamphlet,\
    \ not yet in print, which addresses the question with more vigour and panache\
    \ than I would guess have ever been attempted since people began wearing hats,\
    \ caps, bonnets, Tam o\u2019 Shanters, berets, fezzes, and all sorts of other\
    \ headgear, which as you are probably aware was an immensely long time ago, back\
    \ in what we often call the mists of time, and certainly before you were born.\
    \ By my reckoning, it took several centuries from the first wearing of a hat to\
    \ the insight that to tilt said hat at a rakish angle lent the wearer a certain\
    \ cachet among the other members of their tribe, or what, following Hazel Blears,\
    \ we would now call their community.\nOf course, there were many false starts.\
    \ Some angles are simply not rakish, and never will be, but they were tried and\
    \ tested, often with the use of protractors and sextants and astrolabes, and we\
    \ should be grateful to those tireless but flawed hat angle experimenters, for\
    \ without their work we would doubtless still be going about our modern gleaming\
    \ city streets wearing our hats at ludicrously unrakish angles. Some people still\
    \ do, of course, including one or two of my fellow-passengers on this bus. I think\
    \ it is my duty, once my pamphlet is in print, to carry a carton of them with\
    \ me where'er I roam, handing out free copies to the insufficiently rakish.\n\
    End of bus journey now. I shall lay down my pen, and speak to you soon."
