  text: 'This is a transcript of a handwritten piece read today on Hooting Yard On
    The Air on ResonanceFM. If you do not already keep your bakelite wireless tuned
    in to the station twenty four hours a day, for god''s sake get a grip!

    It occured to me to write something on the bus on the way to the studio, to give
    this week''s show a really contemporary feel. I know that Hooting Yard listeners
    rightly expect a programme that has its finger on the pulse of the times, that
    is truly up to the minute. Well, this week it certainly is, because what I am
    reading to you was written within the past hour.

    And I am reading it with some difficulty, actually, because a bus journey does
    not lend itself to the practice of exquisite copperplate handwriting. I am trying
    to make sense of what can only be described as a semi-legible scrawl. Buses bump
    and clatter and shake, and at times it is akin to being a sock or a napkin in
    a tumble drier.

    God, this is dull. Let me turn to another, non-bus-related topic.

    Recently I referred in passing to my Flemish cheesecloth suit, and as a result
    I received letters from several listeners who, showing great good sense, sought
    my advice on matters of style and fashion, of dash and elan. Strikingly, no fewer
    than four of these letters concerned the wearing of hats at a rakish angle.

    "Dear Frank," wrote one listener, somewhat over-familiarly, given that I have
    no idea who he is, "Can you tell me how best to calculate the exact angle at which
    I should wear my hat, or titfer, to maximise its rakishness?"

    Well, for that correspondent, and for the others who raised this important issue,
    I am preparing a small pamphlet, not yet in print, which addresses the question
    with more vigour and panache than I would guess have ever been attempted since
    people began wearing hats, caps, bonnets, Tam o'' Shanters, berets, fezzes, and
    all sorts of other headgear, which as you are probably aware was an immensely
    long time ago, back in what we often call the mists of time, and certainly before
    you were born. By my reckoning, it took several centuries from the first wearing
    of a hat to the insight that to tilt said hat at a rakish angle lent the wearer
    a certain cachet among the other members of their tribe, or what, following Hazel
    Blears, we would now call their community.

    Of course, there were many false starts. Some angles are simply not rakish, and
    never will be, but they were tried and tested, often with the use of protractors
    and sextants and astrolabes, and we should be grateful to those tireless but flawed
    hat angle experimenters, for without their work we would doubtless still be going
    about our modern gleaming city streets wearing our hats at ludicrously unrakish
    angles. Some people still do, of course, including one or two of my fellow-passengers
    on this bus. I think it is my duty, once my pamphlet is in print, to carry a carton
    of them with me where''er I roam, handing out free copies to the insufficiently
    rakish.

    End of bus journey now. I shall lay down my pen, and speak to you soon.'
