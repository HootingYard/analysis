  text: For a long time, for years and years and years, I have been meaning to write
    about Dobson's dinghy. It is a subject which I am convinced will be hypnotically
    fascinating to my readers, and yet whenever I settle to the task, as I did yesterday
    morning, with the nib of my pen polished to a gleam and a fresh stack of blank
    rectangular paper, I found myself once again baffled and plaintive. It is not
    that the contents of my skull seized up, like a polar ship in pack ice, for I
    had done my usual crack-of-dawn brain exercises, flexing the synapses using a
    set of techniques culled from a Victorian Everyday book. Some might say that synapses
    are not things you can flex, and they may be correct, but I am sure you understand
    what I am driving at. The point is that I was in tiptop writing condition, hunched
    over my desk, nib gleaming and paper stacked and blank, and outside my window
    crows were stalking across the grass, fat and black and Ted Hughesy, and the sight
    of crows seldom fails to inspire me, no matter what I am writing about. Sometimes
    I have filled pages and pages blathering on about crows, and then cleverly crossed
    out every mention of the bird and substituted it with another noun, for example
    windscreen wiper or bazooka, or even with a dozen different nouns, whimsically,
    in a great creative outpouring the like of which would put Dobson himself to shame,
    were he still with us. I have tried this technique over the years when trying
    to write about Dobson's dinghy, as a weapon against my bafflement, but it never
    quite works, and those pages are turned into scrap or made into paper aeroplanes
    or paper hovercraft or paper Hindenburg airships, depending on my mood of the
    moment. It can be very relaxing to fold one's abandoned manuscripts into toy forms
    of transport. Once, I was so thoroughly relaxed after folding half a hopeless
    novella into a paper fleet of milk floats that I fell into a coma. Other writers
    find different uses for their discarded scribblings. The poet Dennis Beerpint,
    I learned, tears his disjecta into thousands of pieces, with untold savagery,
    cursing and fuming as he does so, while Pebblehead, the bestselling paperbackist,
    binds all his up into a bundle with butchers' string and carries it down to the
    beach and throws it into the sea. Frankly, I am surprised that a writer as successful
    and prolific as  Pebblehead ever has aborted works to so dispose of, but I am
    told that he is seen upon the sands at least once a week, casting his bundles
    upon the briny. Dobson never launched his dinghy into the sea. On very rare occasions,
    when the fancy took him, he would push it into a pond and clamber in and paddle
    it across, alarming any ducks, such as teal and coots, who got in his way. The
    dinghy was yellow, and made of rubber, and Dobson bought it at a closing-down
    sale from a ruined ship chandler's. There. There is the essence of my bafflement
    and my plaintiveness. I have just told you everything I know about Dobson's dinghy.
    Every time I have a mind to write about it, I reach the same impasse. I have exhausted
    the topic, and have nothing else to say. Give me a week, or a month, and no doubt
    I will wake up one morning and feel impelled, yet again, to try to write dozens
    of pages of vigorous and impassioned prose about Dobson's dinghy. I will mention
    the pond, the yellow colour, the rubber fabric, and the ruined ship's chandler,
    and that will be that.
