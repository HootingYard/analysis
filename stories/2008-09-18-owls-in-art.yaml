  text: "It has come to my attention that an art person called Alan Disparte has a\
    \ \u201Cwork on paper\u201D entitled Hooting Yard, depicting transmogrified owls.\
    \ Go and look at it here, and at his main page, or portal*, here. Hommage or coincidence?\
    \ Who can say? I cannot help but notice that his name is an anagram of Natal Despair.\n\
    * Do people still refer to \u201Cweb portals\u201D, or has that phrase gone the\
    \ way of \u201Cthe information superhighway\u201D and other once thrilling coinages?\
    \ This is not the kind of thing I know about, although I think this very page\
    \ you are reading ought to be known as The Hooting Yard Portal, or Lobby, or Vestibule."
