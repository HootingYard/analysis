  text: 'It has come to my attention that an art person called Alan Disparte has a
    "work on paper" entitled Hooting Yard, depicting transmogrified owls. Go and look
    at it here, and at his main page, or portal*, here. Hommage or coincidence? Who
    can say? I cannot help but notice that his name is an anagram of Natal Despair.

    * Do people still refer to "web portals", or has that phrase gone the way of "the
    information superhighway" and other once thrilling coinages? This is not the kind
    of thing I know about, although I think this very page you are reading ought to
    be known as The Hooting Yard Portal, or Lobby, or Vestibule.'
