    \ wrenching, yet compellingly vapid scene from Prudence Foxglove's play Oh Lord!\
    \ Let Us Give Vent To The Charitable Impulse By Offering Pies To Sordid Little\
    \ Ragamuffins! (1894). Long forgotten, this knockabout tragicomic melodrama has\
    \ been revived by the Bodger's Spinney Emotionally Wrenching Theatre Troupe, currently\
    \ performing a sixteen-hour version on the pier at Pointy Town."
