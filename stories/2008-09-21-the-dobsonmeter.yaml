  text: '"Dear Frank," writes Richard Carter of Gruts, "This week''s New Scientist  (20
    September, 2008) contains the rather stirring story of how a lone British Antarctic
    Survey scientist managed to give NASA a red face by discovering the hole in the
    ozone layer with a 50-year-old instrument assembled in a shed. The instrument
    was called a Dobsonmeter."

    The Dobsonmeter was invented by a certain Gordon Dobson, who may or may not have
    been related to the out of print pamphleteer whose doings are so assiduously chronicled
    at Hooting Yard. Judging by these excerpts from the New Scientist piece, there
    is a definite affinity:

    Without [Joe] Farman, the truth [about the ozone layer] might not have been discovered
    for several years or more. But he couldn''t have done it without his trusty Dobsonmeter,
    first assembled in a shed outside Oxford more than 50 years earlier by another
    dogged researcher, Gordon Dobson from the University of Oxford''s Clarendon Laboratory...

    The odd thing about the Dobsonmeter is that for a quarter-century it was an instrument
    without much use. It finally came into its own during the International Geophysical
    Year of 1957, when researchers decided to make global measurements of the ozone
    layer. They put in an order for around 50 Dobsonmeters with the London instrument
    maker, R. & J. Beck.

    Farman remembers going to Oxford to pick up his machine from Dobson in 1956. "Even
    after 25 years, they hadn''t completed the instruction manual," he recalls. "That
    only arrived the following year." Farman still has his original copy. For best
    results, it recommends wrapping a quilt round the instrument to keep it warm.

    Only about 120 Dobsonmeters were ever made, of which some 50 remain in use. Each
    is known by its number. Dobson''s original, No 1, is in London''s Science Museum.
    Farman made his discoveries with Nos 37 and 51. Probably the oldest still in use
    is No 8, now 73 years old and sitting on the roof of the Norwegian Polar Institute
    in Svalbard. Dobson died in 1976, so he never saw his instrument''s finest hour.'
