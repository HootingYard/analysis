  \ the music of the Beatles included \u201Cyeah-yeah-yeah howls which are capable\
  \ of striking dead a real beetle\u201D. I am sure Yoko takes a very dim view of\
  \ gratuitous cruelty to insects, and I look forward to the full-page advertisements\
  \ she will surely be taking out in the world's major newspapers to express her,\
  \ and her bespectacled husband's, devotion to our creepy-crawly friends."
