  text: "\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\nToday is the 291st birthday\
    \ of Horace Walpole, as fine a letter-writer as ever lived. Walpole coined a number\
    \ of words in his time, some of which are in general usage (serendipity) and others\
    \ which damned well ought to be (bewolfenbuddlement).\n\u201CThe whole secret\
    \ of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things\
    \ well.\u201D"
