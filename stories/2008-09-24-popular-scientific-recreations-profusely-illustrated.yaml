  text: Further to the thrilling item about the Dobsonmeter, the admirable Richard
    Carter has begun posting excerpts from an 1882 book entitled Popular Scientific
    Recreations, Profusely Illustrated at the Friends Of Charles Darwin site. He begins
    with that most useful of innovations, the dog-powered sewing machine. More outlandish
    "recreations" are promised, so do make sure you keep an eye on the site in the
    coming weeks and months, indeed years.
