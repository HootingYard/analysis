  text: "After I mentioned Prudence Foxglove the other day, I was deluged with post\
    \ from readers avid for more information about her. I am currently working on\
    \ a biography of the unsung Victorian genius which, though potted, will also be\
    \ magisterial. Meanwhile, I have managed to dig out an excerpt from her play May\
    \ The Light Of Our Saviour Beam Down Upon The Cripples And Paupers Of Every Parish\
    \ In The Land (1894).\n[Scene\_: A filthy hovel steeped in gloom.]\nDrunken Brute\_\
    : Go and get my bludgeon so I can bludgeon you about the head in a fit of intoxicated\
    \ rage.\nUrchin\_: Lumme, guvnor, you're as frightening a brute as ever bludgeoned\
    \ a poor half-blind urchin about the head!\nDrunken Brute\_: Yes I am, and if\
    \ you don't get my bludgeon this instant I'll box your ears as well, you urchin\
    \ you.\nUrchin\_: Oh! Did ever a poor half-blind urchin lead so squalid and unChristian\
    \ a life as I am fated to do since my parents perished in an early railway accident\
    \ and I was abducted from Kindly Old Ma Dropsy's Idyllic Cottage For Pallid Infants\
    \ by the Drunken Brute?\n[Urchin exits to fetch Drunken Brute's bludgeon. Drunken\
    \ Brute does some comic business with a birdcage and a set of napkins. Enter Urchin,\
    \ holding a prayer book.]\nDrunken Brute\_: What now, Urchin? That looks to me\
    \ suspiciously like a prayer book.\nUrchin\_: It is a prayer book, Drunken Brute.\
    \ While I was stumbling half-blind about the other part of the filthy hovel, trying\
    \ to find the bludgeon, a proper posh lady dressed all in finery came and handed\
    \ it to me, suggesting that I read some prayers to you.\nDrunken Brute\_: Grrr.\
    \ I've a good mind to give you a double boxing of the ears.\nUrchin\_: Yes, that\
    \ is quite understandable, given that you are a Drunken Brute. But perhaps the\
    \ lady was right, and that if I read you some prayers you will be engulfed in\
    \ the light of Our Saviour, and no longer be drunken and brutish but a reformed\
    \ character of sober mien and a determination to devote your life to hard work\
    \ and social advancement.\n[Urchin begins to recite prayer. Drunken Brute is seized\
    \ by pangs of remorse and self-loathing and collapses into his chair. Enter Prudence\
    \ Foxglove.]\nPrudence Foxglove\_: My name is Prudence Foxglove, and I am the\
    \ proper posh lady who pounced upon this half-blind Urchin in the other part of\
    \ the filthy hovel. And see what wonders I have wrought by bringing the word of\
    \ Our Saviour into this benighted hellhole. Note, too, the daring modernism of\
    \ my play, where I, the authoress, barge into the action and address you, the\
    \ audience, directly. We shall leave the Urchin and the Drunken Brute bedazzled\
    \ by the Lord's light, and in Act Two we shall cast our eyes upon another scene\
    \ of moral depravity and high debauch. The scene is another, filthier, hovel,\
    \ where a smallpox-scarred match-girl is at the mercy of a different drunken brute,\
    \ until by chance they hear a thunderous sermon from an Oxford-educated preacher,\
    \ a man of stern Protestant rectitude, and their lives are transformed."
