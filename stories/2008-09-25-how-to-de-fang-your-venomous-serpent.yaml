  text: 'Sooner or later, most owners of venomous serpents will wish to de-fang their
    cold-blooded pets. Neighbourhood Watch gauleiters and local busybodies often make
    life difficult for the venomous serpent owner, particularly when the paths and
    lanes in the vicinity are littered with the bodies of poisoned innocents with
    tell-tale puncture marks and faces frozen in a rictus of twisted horror. You have
    to weigh up the pleasure of having a happy serpent giving full vent to its instinctual
    drive to sink its fangs into the flesh of a passing greengrocer, and the opprobrium
    which is an almost inevitable result. Social death, and a want of invitations
    to elegant drawing-room soirees, are regrettably the lot of the venomous serpent
    owner, as if somehow it is the keeper rather than the pet who has been slithering
    about, dropping unexpectedly from the branches of trees, and injecting lethal
    toxins into everybody from the postmistress to the community hub outreach worker.

    It should be noted that I am referring to singularly aggressive venomous serpents,
    those which attack without provocation, due to their being agents of Beelzebub.

    Comes the time, eventually, when one tires of black looks from one''s fellows
    in the bus queue and of always being served last in the butcher''s shop. It is
    at this point that the venomous serpent owner concedes that the only solution
    is to de-fang their pet. Doing so is not without its risks, especially if the
    venomous serpent gets an inkling of what is afoot and decides to strike first.
    The obituary columns of the village newspaper are chocker with the names of rash
    wannabe de-fangers whose venomous serpents turned on them. Particularly quick-thinking
    venomous serpents have been known to plunge their fangs into the neck of their
    owner as a pre-emptive measure, before the owner has even resolved to go down
    the de-fanging route.

    The only guaranteed method of de-fanging your singularly aggressive agent of Beelzebub
    is to mesmerise it. Once it has been placed in a trance, it is a simple matter
    to extract its fangs with a pair of pliers, and then to dab on to its gums some
    sort of dual-action antiseptic anaesthetic jelly. There are plenty of proprietary
    brands to choose from at your local chemist, if of course you have not been barred
    from there following the agonising death of the pharmacist, struck down by your
    venomous serpent on an otherwise unremarkable village afternoon. If that is the
    case, which it probably is, you will have to go further afield, to a different
    village, and in such circumstances it is best to place your venomous serpent in
    a creche facility while you are away. Taking the venomous serpent along for the
    ride has its pitfalls, such as the novelty of a fresh set of victims unlikely
    to be on their guard against its sudden, lethal attacks. You will not want to
    be a social pariah in two separate villages, as this will only compound your problems.

    When you snap your de-fanged venomous serpent out of its trance, it will become
    fractious. Deprived of the ability to cause almost instant death by biting, it
    will seek new ways to express its inherent malevolence. And remember that Beelzebub
    will be taking an interest in its welfare. Unjust as it may be, you will quite
    possibly find yourself held responsible for a plague of stranglings and crushings
    in the village, depending upon the size of your ex-venomous serpent. Just as you
    were looking forward to a mantelpiece crammed with invitations to sophisticated
    dinner parties and potato show prize-givings, your hopes may be dashed, and you
    may have to mesmerise your serpent again. It is never easy the second time.'
