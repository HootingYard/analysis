  text: "Vargas, the moustachioed Mexican cop played by Charlton Heston in Orson Welles\u2019\
    \ classic Touch Of Evil (1958), had a walk-on part in one of the more curious\
    \ episodes of Dobson's life.\nMystery surrounds the sudden appearance in Mexico\
    \ of the out of print pamphleteer, although the oft-repeated story that he hove\
    \ into view on the very spot where, a few seconds earlier, Ambrose Bierce had\
    \ vanished, never to be seen again, can be discounted on the basis that it is\
    \ chronologically incoherent. What makes the idea of Dobson-in-Mexico so perplexing\
    \ is that he was notoriously unsuited to hot temperatures. Like Horace Walpole,\
    \ he often had a bucket of ice close to hand, though not, of course, when he was\
    \ in Mexico, for in the high noon of a sweltering day such as the one when he\
    \ made his inexplicable appearance in that hot land such a bucketful would have\
    \ melted away within seconds. As one might expect, Dobson was dressed inappropriately.\
    \ Witnesses record that he was enwrapped in a fur muffler and some sort of reindeer-hide\
    \ kagoul, his large ungainly feet slotted in to a pair of padded boots as worn\
    \ by Alpinists.\nIt would be helpful, I think, to have a goodly supply of words\
    \ in Spanish to deploy when setting the scene. Alas, that language is not among\
    \ my accomplishments, nor are most of the languages spoken and written in the\
    \ world, so you will just have to picture the pamphleteer tottering unsteadily\
    \ down a dusty road in a Mexican village. No one knew where he had come from,\
    \ how he had got there, nor what the ramifications of his presence would be. And\
    \ you can bet there would be ramifications. There always were with Dobson. He\
    \ was not, to be blunt, the sort of pamphleteer who could shrink into the shadows,\
    \ like a discarded and overlooked violet. If he did not always make a lot of noise,\
    \ he somehow seemed\_to. Things would crash around him, or he would disturb the\
    \ kinds of animals that howl and screech, such as dogs and wolves and screech\
    \ owls and monkeys, or he would set off clanging alarm bells. At least, such rackets\
    \ occurred on his foreign trips, for when he was at home in his dismal backwater\
    \ silence could sometimes reign for days on end, broken only by the endless thrumming\
    \ of rain upon the roof.\nThere was no rain here in Mexico, not today, just a\
    \ broiling and battering sun in a sky innocent of clouds. Beneath it tottered\
    \ Dobson, a pencil in one hand and a notebook in the other. Had anyone dared ask\
    \ him what he was bent upon doing, he would have explained that he was engaged\
    \ in what he liked to call \u201Cpamphleteering in the field\u201D. By this he\
    \ did not mean the sort of field he was used to at home, with its cows and rusty\
    \ farm equipment, but the abstract \u201Cfield\u201D beloved of anthropologists\
    \ and ethnographers, and indeed of all sorts of persons who charge about the place\
    \ imagining that they are grappling with the \u201Cauthentic\u201D. Dobson did\
    \ not care two pins about authenticity, delusional or otherwise, but he fancied\
    \ himself as the kind of pamphleteer who could wring a pamphlet from whatever\
    \ circumstances he found himself in, and once he had hit upon the \u201Cpamphleteering\
    \ in the field\u201D phrase, he made a meal of it. Thus in the year of which I\
    \ write he had been stumbling aimlessly from one place to another, pencilling\
    \ pamphlets as he went.\nNow, in Mexico, he slumped against an adobe horse-related\
    \ street appurtenance, lit one of his crumpled cigarettes, and wrote in his notebook:\n\
    Pamphlet In The Field, Number Ten. I appear to be in a Mexican village. There\
    \ will be ramifications, but as yet I do not know what they will be.\nIt was at\
    \ this point that Ramon Miguel \u201CMike\u201D Vargas came upon the scene. He\
    \ was off duty from his top job in the Mexican narcotics bureau, but his presence\
    \ in the small dusty village has never been satisfactorily explained. Perhaps,\
    \ like Dobson, he was just there, for no real purpose. History is full of such\
    \ apparently meaningless conjunctions. Consider that Stalin and Trotsky first\
    \ met each other in what is now a McDonald's restaurant on Whitechapel Road in\
    \ east London, or that Richard Milhous Nixon left Dallas from Love Field mere\
    \ hours before John F Kennedy flew in on that fateful November morning in 1963.\
    \ Can the encounter of Dobson and Vargas be said to have the same resonance? Certainly,\
    \ what passed between them seemed unimportant at the time. Remembering that he\
    \ had to buy some fruit pastilles for his wife Susie, and wishing to jot down\
    \ a note, Vargas asked to borrow Dobson's pencil. The pamphleteer obliged, mindful\
    \ of the quiet authority of the Mexican lawman, but as he handed over the pencil\
    \ he managed, in that Dobsonian way of his, to frighten some hens who were coming\
    \ to eat some grain that had been scattered near the adobe horse-related street\
    \ appurtenance. If you have ever seen a gaggle of panicked hens fleeing from a\
    \ pencil-brandishing pamphleteer, you will know quite well what chaos can be wrought\
    \ in a dusty village. There was uproar, and shouting, and the clattering of many\
    \ cooking pots, and semi-automatic gunfire. By the time things settled down a\
    \ few minutes later, after the village hen person wove his henly spell over the\
    \ hens to placate them, Vargas had forgotten all about Susie's fruit pastilles\
    \ and Dobson had quite lost his train of thought. Both men might have forgotten\
    \ the entire incident, but their lives were changed forever.\nIt is not clear\
    \ precisely what happened when Vargas returned to his motel room fruit pastilleless,\
    \ and it would be foolish to speculate. We know, however, that Dobson underwent\
    \ a neurasthenic miasma when he found he was incapable of completing Pamphlet\
    \ In The Field, Number Ten. By nightfall, he had left the Mexican village as suddenly\
    \ as Ambrose Bierce had vanished. Indeed, he had left Mexico altogether, and was\
    \ aboard a packet steamer, bound, eventually, for home. He spent the entire voyage,\
    \ and the connecting voyages on any number of other seagoing vessels, huddled\
    \ in his cabins, sucking on vitamin tablets and mopping his brow with wrung-out\
    \ dishcloths. His notebook remained unopened, unwritten in, partly due to the\
    \ neurasthenic miasma and partly because, in all the mayhem of the panicking hens\
    \ incident, Vargas had popped Dobson's pencil into his pocket, and he had neglected\
    \ to return it.\nThe pamphleteer fetched up at home months later, still wearing\
    \ his fur muffler and reindeer-hide kagoul and padded Alpine boots. The rain was\
    \ thrumming on the roof and Marigold Chew was fixing a tarpaulin over the guttering.\
    \ She greeted Dobson brightly.\n\u201CHello Dobson! How was the field?\u201D\n\
    \u201CI am done with the field,\u201D he muttered, \u201CIt has broken me. From\
    \ now on, I shall write all my pamphlets sitting at my escritoire, a pot of pencils\
    \ and a pencil sharpener in easy reach.\u201D\nAnd without another word, he went\
    \ and sat at the famed escritoire, and began to write the pamphlet we know today\
    \ as The Unutterable Chaos Caused By Panicking Hens (out of print). As you probably\
    \ recall, he dedicated it to Ramon Miguel \u201CMike\u201D Vargas."
