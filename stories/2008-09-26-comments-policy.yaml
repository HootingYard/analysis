  text: "I attended a seminar recently which had the jaunty title \u201CComments Policies\
    \ For Bloggers\_: How To Make Them Harsh And Unforgiving\u201D. It was all very\
    \ tiresome, and the \u201Cfacilitator\u201D, as he insisted on calling himself,\
    \ in spite of the fact that the facilities were woeful, had little understanding\
    \ of a blog such as Hooting Yard. Here, the prose is defiantly sensible and the\
    \ comments more sensible still.\nIt struck me, however, that I have never made\
    \ the Hooting Yard Comments Policy clear. I will do so now. New visitors may not\
    \ be aware that reading the comments here is compulsory, and is due to be enforced\
    \ by an exciting\u2014if somewhat alarming\u2014software device. If, in future,\
    \ you do not click on the comments, your computer will be disabled, your tongue\
    \ will cleave to the roof of your mouth, your hovel will be infested with pale\
    \ mutant creeping things, and you will no longer receive visits from outreach\
    \ workers from your local Harsh And Unforgiving Community Outreach Cadet Squadron.\n\
    I have taken this step to ensure that readers do not miss such treats as the discussion\
    \ of pippy bags to be found here, or\u2014to pluck just one of numerous profundities\u2014\
    wst's emotionally wrenching comment on The Roads To Jaywick.\nMoves are afoot\
    \ to make the writing, as well as the reading, of comments equally compulsory,\
    \ but the boffins in the software lab have all gone on a well-deserved autumn\
    \ break to the eerie Land of Gaar."
