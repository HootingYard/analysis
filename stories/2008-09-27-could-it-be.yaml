  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Dr Stan Bismark, Whilst ripping out an old fireplace\
    \ in my very own hovel I found, amongst a lot of bird poop, dead crows and other\
    \ muck, a small package tied up with rusty wire.\_ On opening\_ the package all\
    \ it contained was\_a small card-mounted photo of a style which I think is called\
    \ carte de visite.\_ On the back of the photo in green ink was written the following:\
    \ \u201CDobson, shortly befor he died\u201D [sic].\_ Do you think this could be\
    \ your very own pamphleteer?\_ I attach a copy of the photo.\n\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\
