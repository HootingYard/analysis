  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Dr Stan Bismark, Whilst ripping out an old fireplace
    in my very own hovel I found, amongst a lot of bird poop, dead crows and other
    muck, a small package tied up with rusty wire.  On opening  the package all it
    contained was a small card-mounted photo of a style which I think is called carte
    de visite.  On the back of the photo in green ink was written the following: "Dobson,
    shortly befor he died" [sic].  Do you think this could be your very own pamphleteer?  I
    attach a copy of the photo.
