  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Dr Stan Bismark, Whilst ripping out an old fireplace\
    \ in my very own hovel I found, amongst a lot of bird poop, dead crows and other\
    \ muck, a small package tied up with rusty wire.  On opening  the package all\
    \ it contained was a small card-mounted photo of a style which I think is called\
    \ carte de visite.  On the back of the photo in green ink was written the following:\
    \ \"Dobson, shortly befor he died\" [sic].  Do you think this could be your very\
    \ own pamphleteer?  I attach a copy of the photo.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
