  text: 'Everyone has their favourite type of duck, and for Prudence Foxglove it was
    the bufflehead. In the summer of 1894, the unsung Victorian genius took a break
    from writing her daringly modernist plays and compiled a fat volume entitled A
    Celebration Of The Bufflehead In Prose And Song. It was illustrated with her own
    cack-handed pencil drawings which, it has to be said, look much more like teal
    or mergansers than buffleheads. The dramatist had thousands of copies of the book
    printed at her own expense, a cost she could easily afford after the astonishing
    success of her plays such as See How The Intoxicated Brute Wallows In A Swamp
    Of Moral Turpitude Until His Ravaged Soul Is Uplifted By Muscular Christianity
    In The Personage Of A Pugilist Vicar (1894). The closing scene in that fine play,
    in which the Reverend "Nobby" Attenborough rains his beboxinggloved fists down
    upon the head of the intoxicated brute, is unforgettable.

    Prudence Foxglove had been collecting snippets about buffleheads from books, periodicals
    and food packaging since childhood. Most girls of that era would have pasted their
    cuttings into a scrapbook, but Prudence disliked both paste and scrapbooks, and
    instead she stuffed her snippings into an ever-burgeoning accumulation of burlap
    gunny sacks. When a sack was plump and full, she stitched it up using exemplary
    needlework skills, and entrusted it to the keeping of one of her many gardeners
    for use as a pillow. The Foxglove family estate had extensive grounds, grown wild
    over generations of neglect, and it was Prudence''s mother Hepzibah, improbably
    green-fingered, who determined to tame them, employing hundreds of snag-toothed
    peasants from the surrounding hovels to dig and prune and hoe and harrow. Under
    the spell of the social reformer Rufus Crank, Hepzibah Foxglove built a model
    village for her gardeners to live in. Each had their own hut, with guttering and
    drainage and a spigot and a sink and a pallet with a mattress and a shelf of improving
    tracts and prayerbooks and a picture nailed to the wall of Christ commanding the
    woman to throw the sack full of beetles and locusts and flies and snakes and hornets
    and wasps into the sea. It was unusual in those days for gardeners and other servants
    to have pillows, so Prudence''s gunny sacks were particularly welcome. At her
    mother''s insistence, she had taken the precaution of seeking approval from Rufus
    Crank himself. By then over ninety, the reformer wrote back to her in the famous
    "pillows for gardeners" letter, in which he laid out a set of principles we would
    do well to abide by today, if, that is, we still had gardeners in huts in the
    grounds of our estates.

    "Be warned," he wrote, "that a gardener plucked from his hovel and given a hut
    with modern appurtenances such as a sink and a spigot may get hoity-toity if allowed
    to rest his oddly-shaped head on a pillow. Yet Christian compassion tells us he
    must be given the chance so to do. The risk of hoity-toityness can be tempered,
    if not wholly eradicated, by observing some general principles. Rent the pillow
    to your gardener rather than giving it to him outright. Stuff it not with kapok
    nor duck feathers nor soft downy empadment, but with gravel or pebbles or sand.
    Paper and cardboard cuttings on the subject of buffleheads are an acceptable stuffing,
    in extremis. Use burlap gunny sacks or other rough fabric. Forbid pillow-cases."

    Young Prudence got herself into a tizzy when trying to decide how to charge the
    gardeners for pillow rental, for they were unfamiliar with coinage, being peasants.
    Then, at one of her mother''s regular soirees, she met the so-called "potato economist"
    Hicks, an extraordinary man whose theories ought to have resounded down the ages,
    but did not, possibly because he expounded them in prose so dense and clotted
    and awash with spelling errors that it was, and still is, mistaken for gibberish.
    When he spoke, however, Hicks was a model of clarity, and as he stood next to
    a blazing hearth at the soiree, his massive Victorian beard at risk of catching
    fire, he told Prudence to accept payment of pillow rent in potatoes. It was advice
    she took to heart, so much so that as the years passed, and she grew to adulthood,
    and found worldly success as a playwright, still she found time each week to potter
    from hut to hut in the grounds of the estate of which she was now the mistress,
    demanding--and receiving--a potato from each of the increasingly creaky gardeners
    who at night rested their heads on pillows stuffed with her collection of bufflehead
    clippings.

    Many of these potatoes were destined for the grubby lodgings where Hicks lived
    in penury. Every Thursday morning, Prudence Foxglove emparcelled a potato and
    took a horse and cart down to the village post office, where a new-fangled pneumatic
    funnel system sent packages whizzing across the land. What Hicks did with all
    these potatoes is an enduring mystery, for his diary is, if anything, even less
    comprehensible than his published writings. At one point it was thought a small
    clue was to be found in the startlingly fat book Table Talk Of Bearded Victorian
    Intellectuals, wherein nestles a report of a figure thought to be Hicks standing
    next to a blazing hearth making canny observations upon the dietary habits of
    impecunious bearded Victorian intellectuals, in which the potato features prominently.
    But Hicks, famously, viewed the potato as a currency, and he is unlikely ever
    to have eaten one. He was, in any case, an unrepentant carnivore, having trained
    his stomach to digest liver and gravy in huge quantities, as recommended by the
    nutritionist Bristow, another bearded Victorian intellectual but one who had never,
    so far as we know, been invited to one of Hepzibah Foxglove''s soirees.

    After her mother was killed as a result of a cartographic mishap, Prudence at
    first continued with the soirees. Hicks, Jetsam, Baxter, Coughdrop, Fig, and Figby
    were all regular visitors, trudging across the filthy fields to the estate in
    all weathers, keen to propound their various nostrums and being plied with hibiscus
    syrup and water biscuits while Prudence''s sister Drusilla tinkled sentimental
    songs at the piano. Drusilla''s repertoire was small, but she compensated for
    it by devising hectic improvisational passages, so that a mournful dirge such
    as Bring Me Your Winding Sheet, Oh Mother Of Mine, which lasts about two minutes
    when played straight, could last up to sixteen or seventeen hours, by which time
    the assorted bearded Victorian intellectuals had often become so argumentative
    that shouting and fisticuffs were not uncommon. Prudence''s drudge complained
    about forever having to mop up bloodstains from the rug adjacent to the blazing
    hearth, and threatened to seek drudgery elsewhere. Petrified of losing so tireless
    a mopper, Prudence decided to call a halt to the soirees. This left Drusilla at
    a loose end, until she was persuaded to transcribe her piano pieces for a chorus
    of voices, and, on their afternoons off, she trained and rehearsed the gardeners,
    leading them on loud and lusty singsongs roaming across the fields and hills and
    alarming cows and pigs and ponies.

    Without a drawing room full of pontificating bearded Victorian intellectuals,
    Prudence Foxglove too may have found herself in want of anything to occupy her.
    But instead she relished the solitude, and took her first faltering steps towards
    writing. The plays which would make her rich and famous lay in the future, and
    her early efforts were in verse and prose. She tried her hand at detective stories,
    ballads, non-fiction (A History Of Eggs), an epistolatory novel, and automatic
    writing dictated from the spirit world. For the latter, she had her arm hoist
    in a canvas sling, her hand grasping a steel pen, and stunned herself with laudanum.
    Publishers rejected everything she sent to them, with the single exception of
    the magazine Mawkish Chaff, which accepted her poem The Hopeless Hollyhocks. Her
    excitement was somewhat dimmed when it turned out that the editor was a Hicksite,
    and paid for her poem in potatoes.

    Nevertheless inspired by her appearance in the public prints, albeit in a magazine
    with a tiny circulation, Prudence fired off a series of similar pieces, including
    The Lugubrious Lupins, The Dismal Dahlias, and A Spinney Choked With Marshland
    Weeds, and impressed the editor with her industry. He invited her to visit his
    office, in a grim northern mill town, and so it was that Prudence found herself
    taking her first ever railway journey. The trip itself was uneventful, but not
    so her arrival at the grim northern mill town railway station. The editor of Mawkish
    Chaff came to meet her in person. He was a dashing cad with exquisite manners
    and the morals of the sewer, and as she disembarked from her train, he swept her
    into his arms, protested his undying passion for her, crossed the platform to
    bundle her on to a small branch line train and carried her away with him to a
    boarding house in a shabby seaside resort for a week of sinful debauch. Initially
    smitten, Prudence soon came to her senses. On the pretext of popping out of the
    boarding house to buy a couple of choc-ices from a sea front kiosk, she went straight
    to the police station and shopped her seducer. As the cad was carted off to clink
    by a team of rozzers, she took the train back to the grim northern mill town,
    let herself into the offices of Mawkish Chaff with a key she had secretly had
    cut, and set about running the magazine herself.

    Prudence Foxglove proved to be an editrix of genius. Pages once filled with sentimental
    pap now played host to extraordinary talents, as she called on all those bearded
    Victorian intellectuals who had attended the soirees to pen essays and manifestos
    and epic poems and novellas and visionary burbling and, occasionally, automatic
    writing dictated from the spirit world while their arms were hoist in canvas slings.
    Hicks himself was given three entire issues to expound his theories of potato
    economics, and then a further three when he decided he had not quite finished,
    followed by a couple of supplementary issues to tie up a few loose ends, and a
    Christmas Special to repeat the more pertinent points. Prudence was the first
    to publish both Fig''s hallucinatory ravings and Figby''s twee nature notes. It
    was in Mawkish Chaff that Coughdrop predicted, in the coming century, the appearance
    upon the world stage of a pamphleteer he mistakenly identified as "Bodson".

    Throughout this blizzard of editorial activity, Prudence continued to cut out
    clippings about buffleheads and to send them to Drusilla, who had been charged
    with stuffing them into burlap gunny sacks and collecting the pillow rent from
    the gardeners. It is curious that not a single cutting was ever taken from Prudence''s
    own magazine. One can search through the bound volumes and never once find the
    word "bufflehead", whereas the names of other types of ducks turn up frequently,
    particularly sheldrakes, which were an obsessional interest of Baxter''s, no matter
    what he was meant to be writing about.

    Although she did not wholly neglect her own work during these years, penning a
    so-called "pneumatic romance" and a study of the beards of Victorian intellectuals,
    Prudence had yet to hit upon the formula that she would make her own. The germ
    of that first, ground-breaking play was a walk she took through a patch of broken
    ground in the shadow of a grim mill one Sunday. She chanced upon a derelict, sloshing
    a bottle of turps and babbling to himself, and approached him with a charitable
    tuppence in her outstretched hand. The human wreckage grabbed at her wrist and
    would not let go, and Prudence realised with an awful pang that it was her boarding
    house cad. His manners were no longer exquisite and his morals were no longer
    even of the sewer, for they had been utterly blasted away through strong drink
    and turpentine. She had him carted off to an asylum in the hope that he would
    one day recover, and visited him there on subsequent Sundays, listening to his
    incoherent jabbering as he told her his story, from the despair of prison to the
    greater despair of the broken ground in the shadow of the grim mill. She felt
    impelled to share this terrible tale with the world, and it became the basis of
    her play The Dashing But Debauched Cad And His Descent Into A Netherworld Of Turpentine-Fuelled
    Depravity (1894). Writing it, she realised her inborn talent for dramatic dialogue,
    stage directions, interludes of knockabout comedy, emotionally wrenching climaxes,
    and daring modernist interventions, the latter owing something perhaps to Drusilla''s
    piano and choral techniques. From the very first performance, in which the legendary
    actor-manager Sir Hector Bombast played the dashing but debauched cad, the play
    left its audience stunned. Prudence Foxglove had found her Muse, and her future
    was assured.

    She returned the reins of the magazine to the now partially-recovered cad and
    headed back to her estate, where her many decrepit gardeners and her drudge welcomed
    her as a heroine. Drusilla, too, was overjoyed to have her sister back, for she
    had grown lame and the weekly traipsing from hut to hut to collect the pillow
    rent had become a sore trial to her. There was a folly next to a ha-ha in the
    grounds of the estate, and Prudence took it as her writing-room. The plays poured
    out of her, on an almost daily basis, and soon enough her dramas were being put
    on in every theatre in the land.

    Thus it was that, come the summer, she decided to take a break. One fine Friday
    afternoon, she took delivery of a set of sandbags and wheeled them in a barrow
    around the gardeners'' huts, retrieving each of her burlap gunny sacks and leaving
    a sandbag in its place. Then, holed up in her folly by the ha-ha, she emptied
    out the sacks and laboriously copied out each and every bufflehead-related clipping
    into a series of exercise books. When she was done, she took the horse and cart
    to the village post office and sent the embundled books to a printer. A month
    later, she received via the pneumatic funnel system thousands of copies of A Celebration
    Of The Bufflehead In Prose And Song.

    Unlike her plays, it was not a success. The public had come to expect from her
    stern moral invective, drunken brutes, comedic japes, crippled orphans, vapid
    drivellings, pugilistic vicars, and daring modernism. None of these was to be
    found in what was, after all, just a forbiddingly fat anthology of miscellania
    about ducks. When Prudence Foxglove died in 1922, all but one of the copies was
    found rotting in packing cases in the cellar of her estate. And that single, presumably
    sold, copy? The story is told that its owner, a grand-nephew of Hicks, had it
    in his luggage when he stepped aboard the airship Hindenburg in Frankfurt on the
    third of May 1937.
