  text: 'Chumpot''s Patent Rarefied Pigfat ''n'' Sourdough Paste comes in handy tubes.
    Spread thickly on a digestive biscuit, or between two slices of sliced-up solidified
    milk sludge, it makes for a perfect picnic snack.

    You will well know, if ever you have been held responsible for the packing of
    a picnic hamper, the difficulty of picking the appropriate picnic snacks. How
    common it is, to be sat in a meadow, pipe clenched in your teeth, moustache bristling,
    to be lambasted by your fellow picnickers as the picnic hamper is unpacked and
    harsh words are said about, say, the sausages or the unsliced, unsolidified milk
    sludge. Many an idyllic picnic has been destroyed before it has even properly
    begun because of hamper-contents fury. Many meadows have resounded with unseemly
    imprecations. Many moustache-ends have been tweaked with spiteful tugs by the
    fingers of furious picnickers reaching across the picnic rug to assault the hamper
    packer. It is a sorry state of affairs, but one which Chumpot''s aims to make
    a thing of the past. Our pastes are beyond reproach.

    We have been manufacturing pastes, in tubs and tubes, for over a century, from
    our pasteworks in Pointy Town. Old Pa Chumpot, who founded the firm, and whose
    moustache was as magnificent an example of the walrus variety as has ever been
    grown in this town, made it his business to end picnic unpleasantness good and
    proper. It is easy to chuckle at those early promotional leaflets, with their
    clunky slogans such as "There will be no more unwarranted tweaking of moustaches
    at picnics when you pack Chumpot''s pastes in your picnic hamper", but they bespeak
    a great moral purpose. It was a time when meadows were loud with the din of moustachioed
    men wearing boaters, pipes clenched between their teeth, venting their fury at
    the choice of snacks packed into their picnic hampers. Bebonneted ladies blushed
    and held their dainty hands over their ears and, in some cases, swooned. Into
    this maelstrom stepped Old Pa Chumpot, with pastes specifically designed to bring
    due decorum to our meadows. For more than a hundred years now, the firm that still
    bears his name has continued to manufacture exciting and toothsome pastes, usually
    quite edible, for use at picnics. We are proud to do so.'
