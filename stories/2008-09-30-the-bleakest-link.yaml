  text: Thrilling TV news! A fantastic new quiz show called The Bleakest Link begins
    tomorrow. Each week, the ghoulish wraiths of long-dead polar explorers, caked
    in ice, compete with each other to answer really hard questions. The winner is
    the icicle-dripping phantom who intones his answers in the bleakest, most ghastly
    tones. Filmed at an abandoned Antarctic weather station, the quiz features a tethered
    goat. A brain scanner attached to the goat measures the extent of its dreadful
    awe as each answer is boomed at it through a funnel, while a goat-physiology monitoring
    mechanism registers its fearful trembling. The quizmaster is Dale Winton, in a
    reindeer-hide anorak.
