  text: "Hey there Key!, writes the insufferably jaunty Dr Ruth Pastry, The crunch\
    \ of credit seems to be turning into complete economic meltdown. If you don't\
    \ believe me, read the papers. Anyway, from my bolt-hole here in the paradise\
    \ that is an out-of-season English seaside resort, I have a solution to the whole\
    \ bloody mess. We know, from listening to the news on the wireless, that economists\
    \ witter on about a \u201Cbasket of currencies\u201D. No wonder we face fiscal\
    \ Armageddon if all the money is put in baskets! If everyone did as I do, and\
    \ kept their cash in a pippy bag, I think we would see a dramatic about-turn in\
    \ the global economy. Now I am going to take my dog Skippy for a seashore walk.\
    \ Bye bye."
