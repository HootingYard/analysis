  text: "\n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have been wondering if it is time for Hooting Yard\
    \ to obtain a kitemark.  Readers from overseas will wonder what on earth I am\
    \ babbling about, so let me explain. Every single person in this country, man,\
    \ woman and child, upon seeing a little picture of a kite, knows viscerally that\
    \ whatever it is that the picture of a kite is attached to is an absolutely fantastic\
    \ thing, and they can confidently begin to drool with glee. Why this should be\
    \ so is not quite clear, but is probably bound up with age-old traditions of bureaucratic\
    \ twaddle.\nIt has its critics, of course, those in the reality-based community\
    \ who suggest there is something inane in the equation picture of a kite = gleeful\
    \ drooling. But we can only go on the evidence before us. I tested the Pavlovian\
    \ responses of passers-by in a bustling hamlet yesterday. First, I offered people\
    \ a string bag packed with oozing squelchy muck. There were no takers, and indeed\
    \ on more than one occasion I was clouted around the head or threatened by the\
    \ attentions of community hub vigilance officers. But then I made the same offer\
    \ having stuck a picture of a kite to the bag with Blu-Tac. The transformation\
    \ was astonishing. People began to openly drool in the streets, their glee uncontained,\
    \ and several grabbed at the bag full of muck until I had inadvertently created\
    \ a melee. In the end I had to hide behind a piece of civic statuary, but my point\
    \ was proved. "
