  text: 'Chunk Theory is the theory that everything can be crumbled into chunks the
    better to apprehend its meaning. Chunks are very different to, say, lumps or clods
    or crumbs or bits, and must certainly never be mistaken for smithereens. The proper
    definition of the chunk is given in the standard work on Chunk Theory, Chunk Theory,
    A Primer, by the Theory''s original theoriser, Gustav Chunk. Chunk was, of course,
    not the name he was born with, it is a pseudonym he hit upon the better to identify
    himself with the Theory he propounded. When he was not writing about chunks, Chunk
    busied himself destroying all trace of his true surname, so successfully that
    today we know him only as Chunk and do not have an atom of evidence regarding
    his real name. There is even some doubt as to whether or not his first name was
    Gustav but, as the parlance of today has it, let''s not even go there.

    Chunk was fond of demonstrating the beauty of his Theory by physically crumbling
    things into chunks, even things that do not readily lend themselves to crumblement.
    Faced with such a thing--a public telephone kiosk, for example--Chunk had no qualms
    about deploying hacksaws, axes, large heavy hammers and similar tools in order
    to effect his goal. He could regularly be seen marching about his town smashing
    things to bits, although when challenged he would protest that he was engaged
    in the "assisted crumbling of things into chunks". And boy oh boy was he challenged!
    He made innumerable complaints that he was being followed about by municipal cohesion
    officials and coppers, arguing that such stalking was a form of entrapment. Much
    of the Primer was written in the waiting rooms of various courts and assizes where
    Chunk was due to face sanction.

    He was the kind of man who tended to topple over when shoved with sufficient force,
    and this led him to refine his Theory in later years. Shoving and toppling were
    to be incorporated alongside crumblement and chunks without doing damage to the
    premisses of the original Theory, save for the sort of collateral damage one might
    expect. How it would all have held together is something we can only guess at,
    for the promised second edition of the Primer never appeared. Chunk himself was
    cagey whenever he was asked about it, which was seldom, as very few people--very,
    very few people--were remotely interested in his work. One Chunkist commentator
    claimed that only four copies of the Primer were ever sold, each of them to cronies
    with whom Chunk used to hang around in the streets of his town, laden with axes
    and hammers and slicers, eyeing up likely targets for assisted crumbling.

    But there are other Chunkist commentators who hold radically different views.
    Indeed, the most intriguing feature of the whole business is that Chunkist commentators,
    disputants, devotees, fellow-travellers and hangers-on vastly outnumber the total
    number of people who have ever even laid eyes on a copy of the Primer, let alone
    read the damned thing. This signal fact has led to an offshoot of Chunk Theory
    known as Chunk Theory Theory, a field which has spawned an entire academic industry
    populated by beardy good-for-nothings who would be better employed digging drainage
    ditches, some of whom, apparently, actually do such drainage ditch digging, in
    between penning abstruse articles for the numberless Chunk Theory Theory journals.

    I went to interview one such peasant scholar for this piece, but when I approached
    him, he shoved me with considerable force, and I toppled into the drainage ditch
    he had just completed digging. Such are the perils of Academe. I brush them aside,
    for I am both hoity and toity and I know where the bodies are buried. My father
    was a gravedigger, and his father before him, and they knew not only where the
    bodies were buried but on which side their bread was buttered, and they knew their
    onions too. You will rarely find a peasant scholar, Chunkist or otherwise, who
    knows such things. I was minded to follow the family gravedigging tradition, but
    I proved too weedy to handle a spade. Ironic, I suppose, that I end up flailing
    helplessly on my back at the bottom of a drainage ditch while a Chunkist starts
    to shovel chunks of crumbled earth over me, like a scene from a cheap horror film.
    But I shall abide, though I crumble to dust, dust in crumbled chunks, and in each
    crumbled chunk a worm that burrows.'
