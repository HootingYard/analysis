  text: 'It is imperative that I draw your attention to the latest post on the splendid
    blog According To The Ninth, "the world as seen through the clarifying lens of
    the 9th Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1875-1889)".  As you can gather
    from the illustration, the topic is fiendish experiments upon the brains of birds.

    vomit, but you will almost certainly learn something you did not know before.
