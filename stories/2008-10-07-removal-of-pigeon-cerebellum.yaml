    \ blog According To The Ninth, \"the world as seen through the clarifying lens\
    \ of the 9th Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1875-1889)\".  As you can\
    \ gather from the illustration, the topic is fiendish experiments upon the brains\
    \ of birds. Well, upon the brains of pigeons, to be specific. You may chuckle,\
    \ or you may vomit, but you will almost certainly learn something you did not\
    \ know before.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "
