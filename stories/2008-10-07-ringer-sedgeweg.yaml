  text: "Sedgeweg, a crony of the Tuppers, had many toppings. Some of them were like\
    \ lids and some like caps. One of particular note was the flat one, the one that\
    \ decisively lacked fizz. That was unusual, but not unexpected, for Sedgeweg was\
    \ a ringer, and a Tewkeston one at that, with the distinctive old red shawl and\
    \ the calipers. His grip was firm, you could say that for him, and you could say\
    \ much else. People did. Take a walk along the bridle path one morning, just after\
    \ dawn, and you will hear of little else. Even the birds making a birdy dawn din\
    \ seem to call out his name, although of course that is just our human fancy at\
    \ work. Any bridle path hereabouts will be the same, in the mornings, crowded\
    \ with folk who've risen early from their beds, wandering out of doors like sleepwalkers,\
    \ heading nowhere in particular, with no particular business. It may be the pong\
    \ of the bridle paths that attracts them, in their dozens, woken from dreams of\
    \ pigs upon gravel, always the same dream, shared by so many, it is quite a wonder.\
    \ After all, this is not pig country, hasn't been for a hundred years or so, long\
    \ before Sedgeweg's time. By the time he came along it was all geese, or otters,\
    \ or just vast tracts of cement. His parents had both been among those who poured\
    \ the cement, without much in the way of skill, but with enthusiasm. You need\
    \ to be keen to perform certain actions, when you've not been apprenticed to them.\
    \ But Sedgeweg knew ringing backwards, he'd been trained to it. Lots were, once.\
    \ You'd be surprised how readily he took to it, all things considered, by which\
    \ \u2018things\u2019 I mean his dumps and flops and clownishness. Each in turn\
    \ he struggled with, but defeated. He was a decent man. Some, on the bridle path\
    \ of a morning, have it that he cannot count and never could, but they are wrong.\
    \ A ringer unable to count would be a strange creature indeed, as strange in its\
    \ own way as those otters that now prevail where once the pigs held sway. They\
    \ are not quite like any other otters, or at least any you are likely to chance\
    \ upon at a standard riverbank. Take your binoculars or a telescope and have a\
    \ look, you'll see what I mean.\_"
