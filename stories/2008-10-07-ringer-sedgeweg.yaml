  text: Sedgeweg, a crony of the Tuppers, had many toppings. Some of them were like
    lids and some like caps. One of particular note was the flat one, the one that
    decisively lacked fizz. That was unusual, but not unexpected, for Sedgeweg was
    a ringer, and a Tewkeston one at that, with the distinctive old red shawl and
    the calipers. His grip was firm, you could say that for him, and you could say
    much else. People did. Take a walk along the bridle path one morning, just after
    dawn, and you will hear of little else. Even the birds making a birdy dawn din
    seem to call out his name, although of course that is just our human fancy at
    work. Any bridle path hereabouts will be the same, in the mornings, crowded with
    folk who've risen early from their beds, wandering out of doors like sleepwalkers,
    heading nowhere in particular, with no particular business. It may be the pong
    of the bridle paths that attracts them, in their dozens, woken from dreams of
    pigs upon gravel, always the same dream, shared by so many, it is quite a wonder.
    After all, this is not pig country, hasn't been for a hundred years or so, long
    before Sedgeweg's time. By the time he came along it was all geese, or otters,
    or just vast tracts of cement. His parents had both been among those who poured
    the cement, without much in the way of skill, but with enthusiasm. You need to
    be keen to perform certain actions, when you've not been apprenticed to them.
    But Sedgeweg knew ringing backwards, he'd been trained to it. Lots were, once.
    You'd be surprised how readily he took to it, all things considered, by which
    'things' I mean his dumps and flops and clownishness. Each in turn he struggled
    with, but defeated. He was a decent man. Some, on the bridle path of a morning,
    have it that he cannot count and never could, but they are wrong. A ringer unable
    to count would be a strange creature indeed, as strange in its own way as those
    otters that now prevail where once the pigs held sway. They are not quite like
    any other otters, or at least any you are likely to chance upon at a standard
    riverbank. Take your binoculars or a telescope and have a look, you'll see what
    I mean.
