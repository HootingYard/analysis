  text: 'Oh the farmer''s dancing round a pit. He''s trapped Beelzebub in it. Upon
    a branch a warbling tit sings: We have chained the devil-oh.

    The farmer tramples in the muck. His belly''s full of boiled duck. A chicken makes
    a warning cluck, says: The devil''s loosed his chains-oh.

    The sky above is a sudden black. The devil leaps up on the farmer''s back. He
    puts the farmer in a sack and he jumps back into the pit-oh.

    The chicken clucks and the tit still sings. It beats its frozen little wings.
    Oh rustics, you must learn these things: Don''t try to chain the devil-oh.

    Till your fields and hoe your ground. Harrow the earth and don''t look round when
    you hear that awful sound: The devil''s boiling the farmer-oh.

    That duck he ate avenged its fate. It took Baal''s shape and had Baal''s hate.
    The farmer learned that much too late, and he''ll dance no more round the pit-oh.'
