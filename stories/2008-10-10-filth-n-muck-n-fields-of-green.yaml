  text: 'Several readers have written in to ask if A Rustic Lesson is a genuine old
    folk song, culled from a collection collected by a collector of old folk songs.
    Figures such as Cecil Sharp and Percy Grainger and Bela Bartok were fond of traipsing
    the countryside jotting down the ululations of peasants, and my correspondents
    wonder if the tale of the duck and the devil and the farmer comes from such a
    source. Indeed it does. A Rustic Lesson was collected by Prudence Foxglove''s
    cousin Sagacity Wolfbag, a tireless explorer of rustic byways.

    It is exactly one hundred years since Sagacity published her anthology Filth &
    Muck & Fields Of Green, comprising thousands of pages of songs and ballads, lore
    and legend, recipes and remedies, proverbs, sayings and old saws, many if not
    all of them nonsensical. The bulk of the material in the book was gathered in
    one tiny rustic backwater, a dismal huddle of dilapidated huts in a field near
    the Blister Lane Bypass. Much of it seems to have been relayed to Sagacity Wolfbag
    by a single, particularly grubby peasant, who was probably in the throes of ergot-related
    hysteria, and who died babbling in a ditch shortly after the anthology was published.

    Thanks to R. for alerting me to the existence of Sagacity Wolfbag.'
