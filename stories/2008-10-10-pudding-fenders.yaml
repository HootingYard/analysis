  text: 'Dear Mr. Key, writes Mick Wiggins from across the pond, Just like a recent
    listener''s account of the Hooting Yard narrative voice taking over the helm whilst
    sightseeing, I similarly experienced the same while visiting the Maritime Museum
    in Astoria, Oregon, just this last weekend.  The museum, located at the mouth
    of the once mighty Columbia River, open to Cape Disappointment and just down the
    way from Dismal Nitch, was a very good museum, with many arcane and wonderous
    accounts of the famous "Graveyard of the Pacific".  Of course it was when I found
    myself studying a fantastic display of pudding fenders that the Hooting Yard Effect
    commandeered my own internal voice, and it really was a value-added treat. It
    is too bad you cannot capitalize on this effect, but perhaps you should look in
    to it. At any rate, thank you for the many hours of listening pleasure.

    I have replied to Mr Wiggins asking him to tell us more about pudding fenders,
    so watch this space.'
