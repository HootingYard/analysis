  text: 'Pansy Cradledew tells me that she has recently devised a new method of empowering
    her pod-on-a-lanyard. Rather than plugging it into a socket in the wall, via a
    recharger, she has obtained a piece of gubbins which is attached to her window
    with a sucker. Wings on the gubbins are exposed to the glare of that blazing mighty
    orb in the sky, the one John Donne rightly called a "busie old fool", and the
    pod thereafter is fed from the power stored in the gubbins.

    This is all very well, but it occurs to me that it could be the beginning of a
    slippery slope which might see Pansy becoming an Aztec fundamentalist. Now that
    she relies, with obvious enthusiasm, upon that burning golden disc for the empowering
    of her pod, can it be long before she is tearing out the still-beating hearts
    from the breasts of sacrificial victims upon a stone altar to assuage the angry
    Sun?

    Before you accuse me of overreacting, bear in mind that this is the woman who
    gleefully announced only the other day that she had bought a DVD of The Royal
    Hunt Of The Sun for PS3. This is the film, you will recall, in which Christopher
    Plummer gives a truly unforgettable performance as Captain Von Trapp Atahualpa.
    I rest my case.'
