  text: "Pansy Cradledew tells me that she has recently devised a new method of empowering\
    \ her pod-on-a-lanyard. Rather than plugging it into a socket in the wall, via\
    \ a recharger, she has obtained a piece of gubbins which is attached to her window\
    \ with a sucker. Wings on the gubbins are exposed to the glare of that blazing\
    \ mighty orb in the sky, the one John Donne rightly called a \u201Cbusie old fool\u201D\
    , and the pod thereafter is fed from the power stored in the gubbins.\nThis is\
    \ all very well, but it occurs to me that it could be the beginning of a slippery\
    \ slope which might see Pansy becoming an Aztec fundamentalist. Now that she relies,\
    \ with obvious enthusiasm, upon that burning golden disc for the empowering of\
    \ her pod, can it be long before she is tearing out the still-beating hearts from\
    \ the breasts of sacrificial victims upon a stone altar to assuage the angry Sun?\n\
    Before you accuse me of overreacting, bear in mind that this is the woman who\
    \ gleefully announced only the other day that she had bought a DVD of The Royal\
    \ Hunt Of The Sun for \xA33. This is the film, you will recall, in which Christopher\
    \ Plummer gives a truly unforgettable performance as Captain Von Trapp Atahualpa.\
    \ I rest my case."
