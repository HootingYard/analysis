  text: Regular readers will know that here at Hooting Yard we do our utmost to keep
    up with innovations in the world o' gruel, pap and slops. Someone has to, and
    who better for the task than our team of tireless Gruel And Pap And Slops Monitors
    hunched over their consoles from dawn to dusk and then again from dusk to dawn?
    Anyway, one such Monitor has just alerted me to a newly-sighted slop, spotted
    on the BBC, where Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable spoke of "credit
    default slops". The term will be added to our database after a due period of slobbering.
