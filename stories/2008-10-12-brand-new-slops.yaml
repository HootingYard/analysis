  text: "Regular readers will know that here at Hooting Yard we do our utmost to keep\
    \ up with innovations in the world o\u2019 gruel, pap and slops. Someone has to,\
    \ and who better for the task than our team of tireless Gruel And Pap And Slops\
    \ Monitors hunched over their consoles from dawn to dusk and then again from dusk\
    \ to dawn? Anyway, one such Monitor has just alerted me to a newly-sighted slop,\
    \ spotted on the BBC, where Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable spoke\
    \ of \u201Ccredit default slops\u201D. The term will be added to our database\
    \ after a due period of slobbering."
