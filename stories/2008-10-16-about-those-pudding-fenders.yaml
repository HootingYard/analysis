  text: "Mick Wiggins has sent in a splendidly informative report about those pudding\
    \ fenders. Many thanks to him for this:\nI will relate what little I know about\
    \ these bulbous knotted affairs that deck hands would hang from the deck and bow\
    \ in order to prevent damage to the hull from knocking about while the ship is\
    \ at berth. While commonly used up until the early 20th century, the hand-made\
    \ rope bumpers were eventually replaced with used auto tires and synthetic rubbers.\
    \ \nVisually, they're masterpieces of knot-craft, heavy and beautifully patterned.A\
    \ Lord knows how long it took to knit these things, but I hear sailors can have\
    \ a lot of free time on their hands while at sea. I did come across a site that\
    \ sells modern versions of Pudding Fenders, butA I can't really think why one\
    \ would buy one except for the reason of being able to shout \"Throw down the\
    \ Pudding Fenders\" to the first mate every so often.\nAlso known as Bow Pudding,\
    \ they came in all kinds of different shapes, sausage-like mostly, and even one\
    \ style that looks like a steroidal string mop hung from the bow like a great\
    \ messy beard.  .  \nHere's a nice example, just like one of the fenders I saw\
    \ on display--large and huggable even, it measured a meter+ in diameter.\n\n \n\
    \ \n \n \nOn a side note, I was a little, well, a lot confused about the Pudding\
    \ aspect, until tonight I remembered something about the English and their puddings.\n\
    \n \n \n \n \nMystery solved! I think this Hack Pudding would serve very nicely\
    \ as a fender.\nAs for Dismal Nitch, I did not make it down there, as it was raining\
    \ and dismal out. I learned though,A it was during a particularly fierce winter\
    \ stormA in the early 1800'sA that had the famous explorers Lewis and Clark pinned\
    \ down for days, that this spit of land near the mouth of the Columbia River earned\
    \ its name, which is still in use by locals."
