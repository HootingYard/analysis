  text: OutaSpaceman sends news of some exciting paint samples. A company called Green-Scene
    offers tins of General Muck, Corporal Crap, Devon Soil, and--my favourite for
    obvious reasons--Yard Filth. There is something endearing about a website advertising
    paint samples on which most of the pictures are missing, promising "Image Coming
    Soon", dated 2005.
