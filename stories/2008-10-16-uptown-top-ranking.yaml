story:

  text: 'Dobson was invited uptown, to the very top of uptown, in Pointy Town, to
    help adjudge a ranking event. The items to be ranked were rank: bags of filthy
    laundry, bowls of curdled milk slops, slices of rotting and contaminated offal,
    and the like. Quite why Dobson was thought to be an adequate judge of such things
    is a mystery. It is likely that he engineered his invitation as the one chance
    he had to go to the top of uptown Pointy Town, an exclusive resort peopled by
    fashionable chancers and a certain sort of plutocrat. It was the kind of place
    where cummerbunds were worn, and wristwatches glittered.

    Dobson is unlikely to have worn either a cummerbund or a wristwatch, but, armed
    with his invitation, he boarded the "Bucephalus", an engine on the funicular railway
    connecting the less pointy bits of Pointy Town to the magnificently pointier top
    of uptown. Gulls greeted him at the station, swooping and shrieking, as gulls
    do. Oh, those Pointy Town gulls! How one misses their clamour! They still prevailed
    in Dobson''s day, and he was mindful enough to execute a quick sketch of them
    in his notebook, since lost, alas.

    Puffing up the vertical, the funicular railway was scented, in those days, with
    lavender and hibiscus, and we can imagine Dobson breathing in those fumes, artificial
    though they were, as he prepared himself for the unaccustomed role of ranking
    judge. These contests took place every five years, and those who entered their
    rank engrubbiments, be they laundry bags or bowls or slices, were a rivalsome
    crew. There was Taplow, of course, and Scruton and Cribcage and Hooter. Venables
    and Ricketts, too, and old crumpled Stainforth in his breeches. Not one of them
    was allowed anywhere near uptown save for when the ranking contest took place.
    The rest of the time they kept to their middens in some dank, though reasonably
    pointy, corner of Pointy Town. That was a part of town Dobson knew well, for he
    often strolled there, of a morning, on his way to see pigs.

    But now both Dobson and the rank competitors with their rank bags and bowls and
    slices and whatnot were gathered in smart and flashy uptown, the very top of it,
    so pointy that in truth nowhere was pointier. Dobson looked at the scorecard he
    had been given by the referee, and chewed the end of his pencil. Then he walked
    slowly among the trestle tables on to which the items to be ranked had been chucked.
    He hoped he was carrying himself in a suitably authoritative manner, akin to a
    top judge at, say, a dog show. Dobson had never actually attended a dog show,
    but he had read a vivid eye-witness account of one in Vivid Eye-Witness Accounts
    magazine, to which he subscribed and, very occasionally, contributed. So his gait
    was firm as he toured the tables, and he did much frowning. Slumped and bedraggled
    on their uptown sofabeds, Taplow and Scruton and Cribcage and Hooter and Venables
    and Ricketts and old crumpled Stainforth watched and waited. They had no idea
    that the out of print pamphleteer ranking their rank items was completely baffled
    and did not have a clue what he was doing. Nevertheless, he began scribbling on
    his scorecard, boldly and decisively, and then he handed the card to the referee
    and went to lean against a big pointy plaster of Paris pointy thing, the kind
    you will only find at the top of uptown.

    As was usual at these events, there was a lengthy delay before the referee announced
    the result. In the sweltering heat, the rank bags and bowls and slices grew ranker
    still. Netting was deployed to protect them from those fantastic uptown gulls.
    Dobson had been hoping to use this time for some sight-seeing, but was disappointed
    to learn from the referee that his duties included leaning against the plaster
    of Paris pointy thing, completely immobile, until the result was announced. One
    of Dobson''s most tiresome pamphlets is the one in which he moans on and on about
    the regular thwarting of his touristy inclinations. If he is to be believed, every
    time he had his heart set on sight-seeing, someone or something dashed his hopes,
    be they thunderstorms, defective bus timetables, enormous puddles, recalcitrant
    flocks of sheep, poleaxed cutty shredders, or, in this case, a jobsworth ranking
    referee. But Dobson was on unfamiliar ground, in the middle of an arena filled
    with fancypants Pointy Town uptowners with their cummerbunds and glittering wristwatches.
    It was a bit like a Spandau Ballet stadium gig, and if you have ever been to one
    of those you will understand why the pamphleteer was distressed.

    And then, at long last, at twilight, the referee clacked his counters and announced
    the result. There was uproar, from both the crowd and, more violently, from the
    competitors. It was obvious to all that Dobson had absolutely no idea about the
    appropriate ranking of bags full of filthy laundry and bowls of curdled milk slops
    and slices of rotting and contaminated offal. He had, it appeared, simply filled
    out the scorecard at random, for all his judge-at-a-dog-show posturing.

    He wrote a melodramatic piece about the subsequent kerfuffle for Vivid Eye-Witness
    Accounts magazine, but it was rejected by the editor and the manuscript is lost.
    All we know is that Dobson was chased out of uptown by Pointy Towners armed with
    pitchforks and bludgeons, and was never, ever invited back. He was a gloomy pamphleteer
    indeed for about a week after this sorry episode, but thereafter he perked up
    by devising a board game called Picnic For Detectives.

    His ranking of the rank items was blotted from the record, and it took place again
    the following day, Blodgett having been jetted in specially to do a proper job
    of it. In first place, quite properly, was Taplow, who for the next five years
    wore his prizewinner''s goat-hair trousers with due pride.'
