  text: 'The peculiar forces of devastation induced by modern city life have only
    entered the world lately; and no existing terms of language known to me are enough
    to describe the forms of filth, and modes of ruin, that varied themselves along
    the course of Croxsted Lane. The fields on each side of it are now mostly dug
    up for building, or cut through into gaunt corners and nooks of blind ground by
    the wild crossings and concurrencies of three railroads. Half a dozen handfuls
    of new cottages, with Doric doors, are dropped about here and there among the
    gashed ground: the lane itself, now entirely grassless, is a deep-rutted, heavy-hillocked
    cart-road, diverging gatelessly into various brick-fields or pieces of  waste;
    and bordered on each side by heaps of--Hades only knows what!--mixed dust of every
    unclean thing that can crumble in drought, and mildew of every unclean thing that
    can rot or rust in damp: ashes and rags, beer-bottles and old shoes, battered
    pans, smashed crockery, shreds of nameless clothes, door-sweepings, floor-sweepings,
    kitchen garbage, back-garden sewage, old iron, rotten timber jagged with out-torn
    nails, cigar-ends, pipe-bowls, cinders, bones, and ordure, indescribable; and,
    variously kneaded into, sticking to, or fluttering foully here and there over
    all these,--remnants broadcast, of every manner of newspaper, advertisement or
    big-lettered bill, festering and flaunting out their last publicity in the pits
    of stinking dust and mortal slime.
