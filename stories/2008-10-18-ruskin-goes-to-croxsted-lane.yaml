  text: "The peculiar forces of devastation induced by modern city life have only\
    \ entered the world lately; and no existing terms of language known to me are\
    \ enough to describe the forms of filth, and modes of ruin, that varied themselves\
    \ along the course of Croxsted Lane. The fields on each side of it are now mostly\
    \ dug up for building, or cut through into gaunt corners and nooks of blind ground\
    \ by the wild crossings and concurrencies of three railroads. Half a dozen handfuls\
    \ of new cottages, with Doric doors, are dropped about here and there among the\
    \ gashed ground: the lane itself, now entirely grassless, is a deep-rutted, heavy-hillocked\
    \ cart-road, diverging gatelessly into various brick-fields or pieces of  waste;\
    \ and bordered on each side by heaps of--Hades only knows what!--mixed dust of\
    \ every unclean thing that can crumble in drought, and mildew of every unclean\
    \ thing that can rot or rust in damp: ashes and rags, beer-bottles and old shoes,\
    \ battered pans, smashed crockery, shreds of nameless clothes, door-sweepings,\
    \ floor-sweepings, kitchen garbage, back-garden sewage, old iron, rotten timber\
    \ jagged with out-torn nails, cigar-ends, pipe-bowls, cinders, bones, and ordure,\
    \ indescribable; and, variously kneaded into, sticking to, or fluttering foully\
    \ here and there over all these,--remnants broadcast, of every manner of newspaper,\
    \ advertisement or big-lettered bill, festering and flaunting out their last publicity\
    \ in the pits of stinking dust and mortal slime.\nJohn Ruskin, from Fiction :\
    \ Fair And Foul, 1880\n "
