  text: 'If you are planning to introduce the phrase "let the cat out of the bag"
    into a conversation, you can give your words a weightier punch by having a bag
    with a cat in it, ready to be released at the right moment. This is a variant
    on the argument from demonstration, and when we are looking at methods of adding
    heft to what we say, it can be very effective.

    The technique is simple. First, obtain a cat. The standard domestic moggy will
    suffice, and you can pick one up from an animal shelter or pet shop. I do not
    recommend abducting one while it is dozing in the sunlight on the windowsill of
    a happy family home, for that would be very wrong of you, and though you probably
    would not be sent to prison, a black stain would be seared upon your immortal
    soul for the crime of causing misery to blameless citizens, leaving bereft infants
    sobbing into their pillows as they spend fitful nights lamenting the loss of Tiddles.
    Make a note of that, in case you are tempted to cut corners and go out marauding,
    on the lookout for the first cat to cross your path.

    Choosing a bag is slightly more problematic, but only if you are dim. Clearly
    the bag must be big enough for the cat to fit inside it, and it must have some
    form of clasp or seal. If you have not grasped that much, go and get your brain
    hardened up at a cranial integument-stiffening facility and come back when you
    are less of a fool. The rest of you will have gathered that, as long as it meets
    the above provisos, pretty much any bag will do. It is unwise to spend excessively
    on some kind of designer handbag, a choice you might make if you are an oligarch
    or a plutocrat. Even if you have the riches of Croesus, there are much more constructive
    uses for your money, such as donating goodly sums to a charitable fund for out
    of print pamphleteers. Incidentally, the act of making such a donation is guaranteed
    to remove from your immortal soul any black stains or other besmirchments with
    which it has been seared or smeared, so listen up! I am not suggesting that by
    handing your money over to an impecunious scribbler you are thereby excused snatching
    a cherished family pet from its windowsill slumber, so don''t go thinking you
    can weigh the evil act against the good. Anyway, just get the damned bag and put
    the lawfully-obtained cat into it. Simply pick up the cat, put it in the bag,
    and use the fastening mechanism, whatsoever it may be, to ensure the cat stays
    put until you are ready.

    Let us leap forward in time to the exciting moment in the conversation that all
    this is leading up to. You are sitting in an armchair. The bag with the cat in
    it is on your lap. To add a vivid if unnecessary detail, let us picture your interlocutor,
    looming over you, standing at the fireplace, stabbing the air with his pipe as
    he speaks. "Blah blah blah," he says. His words are unimportant in this context,
    for all our attention is rightly upon you--you who have learned that it pays to
    increase your word power. "Blah blah blah," he continues, seemingly unstoppable,
    until he pauses to take a puff of his pipe, aglow with expensive Montenegrin tobacco
    obtainable only through a specialist supplier in the most exclusive quarter of
    your city. You take the opportunity of his brief silence to say, "Ha! That''s
    let the cat out of the bag!" and as you crow the words, you unfasten the bag and
    let the cat out of it. Quod erat demonstrandum.

    This ploy will work on a handful of occasions, after which it begins to lose its
    effectiveness. Thereafter, both the bag and the cat will need to be given new
    purposes in your life. You can use the bag to haul potatoes back from market,
    or to place as a hood over the head of any hostage you see fit to take, if you
    are that way inclined. As for the cat, it will be happy with regular bowls of
    milk and a supply of maimed but still-living field mice or small birds.'
