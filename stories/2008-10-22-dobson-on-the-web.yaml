  text: "On the Guardian's online books pages the other day there was a piece asking\
    \ Which are the best books that never existed? I am grateful to the eagle-eyed\
    \ Hooting Yard reader who alerted me to the fact that someone going by the name\
    \ of \u201Cboiledonions\u201D nominated How To Knit Knots While Remaining Invisible\
    \ To Hurrying Brutes by Dobson. Much as I applaud the wisdom of the choice, I\
    \ feel I should point out that this is, of course, a pamphlet rather than a book,\
    \ and an out of print one to boot. I should also express my dismay that \u201C\
    boiledonions\u201D seems to be claiming that it does not exist.\nThose cavils\
    \ aside, there is a wider point here, and one all readers should note, and note\
    \ well, in your little Daily Hooting Yard Devotional Observations notebooks, and\
    \ it is this: Dobson may be a figure of the last century, and he may be out of\
    \ print, but wherever and whenever you can, as you roam the highways and byways\
    \ of the interweb, you should take whatever opportunities as present themselves\
    \ to sing his praises, and to make his work more widely known.\nSo well done,\
    \ \u201Cboiledonions\u201D. You may even have won a prize."
