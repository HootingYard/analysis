  text: "\n\u201CAnd about bloody time!\u201D I hear you cry. At long last, after\
    \ much travail, the new Hooting Yard anthology is available. Gravitas, Punctilio,\
    \ Rectitude & Pippy Bags contains no fewer than a hundred and one stories eked\
    \ from the pea-sized but pulsating cranium of Mr Key. 340 pages, or thereabouts,\
    \ packed with common sense, with a few pictures thrown in, including that old\
    \ favourite the Chumpot Patent Soap label. Now you can curl up in your exciting\
    \ 60's style wickerwork seating pod, or sprawl on a lawn in a snowdrift during\
    \ a winter picnic, and furrow your brow as you grapple with the exceedingly sensible\
    \ doings of exceedingly sensible characters such as Dobson and Pebblehead and\
    \ Tiny Enid and fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol.\nSimply click on the picture to\
    \ order your copy."
