  text: 'Bobsleigh and curling were the great enthusiasms of the winter sports enthusiast.
    His enthusiasm was that of a spectator rather than a participant, his body being
    too gangly and chaotic for him to accomplish even the simplest athletic technique
    with any measure of success. As a youth, he had fancied himself as the sort of
    person who could throw himself off a high diving board and perform breathtaking
    pirouettes before plunging, straight as an arrow, into the municipal swimming
    pool, but his efforts were laughable. After dozens of attempts, he saw sense,
    slinking away from the pool and indeed away from the town, heading north until
    he reached snow and ice, where he felt at home, and where winter sports were engaged
    in all year round, and he became a fan of bobsleigh and curling, and he bought
    a pair of sunglasses and a season ticket to events.

    It was in a stadium watching a curling quarter-final that the enthusiast met the
    dimwit. The dimwit was an important figure in this cold country, having risen,
    as so many dimwits do, to civic office. He had his own box in the stadium, as
    he had boxes in all the stadia thereabouts, for though he knew nothing of the
    rules and drama of curling or of any other sport, winter or otherwise, the dimwit
    liked to be seen out and about, being important, a golden chain of office slung
    around his neck, and a cap upon his head.

    The enthusiast and the dimwit bumped into each other as they both made for the
    automated snack dispenser in the lobby of the stadium. The enthusiast recognised
    the dimwit, for the latter''s photograph was regularly published in newspapers
    and magazines and propaganda sheets, and he often appeared on television, against
    a backdrop of ice-girt palaces and official buildings.

    "Gosh!" said the winter sports enthusiast, "You are Bogdan Vingo, the minister
    of broad sweeping policy pronouncements!"

    "I am indeed, little gangly chaotic person," replied the dimwit, buffing his chain
    with the cuff of his coat.

    And so began a surprising friendship that was to last as long as they both lived,
    for the winter sports enthusiast and the dimwit discovered they had much in common,
    not least that, in a certain light, they could be taken for twins. They were not
    twins, of course, but the resemblance was close enough to disconcert the visually
    impaired citizens of that freezing land, and both used it to their advantage,
    in advancing their separate schemes and plots.

    If you were to chance upon your Doppelganger, you might wish it wasn''t a dimwit,
    but needs must when the devil drives. And the devil did drive the winter sports
    enthusiast, for as he realised the opportunities for mischief and shenanigans
    afforded by his striking likeness to the dimwit, he dug himself ever deeper into
    a pit of moral turpitude, and by the time he was racked by remorse and wished
    to clamber out of it, it was far too late.
