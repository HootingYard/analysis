  text: 'When the usual suspects publish their books, they can be guaranteed to pat
    each other on the back in the pages of their North London Literary Mafia house
    journals. When a starving scrivener such as Mr Key publishes his books, he does
    so to resounding indifference from those same publications. This is neither surprising
    nor particularly exasperating (on a good day), but it is a lamentable state of
    affairs. In the past, some review copies have been sent out, but they may as well
    have been chewed up by a post office hound.

    It occurs to me that Hooting Yard readers might wish to marshal the power of the
    interweb and write their own reviews, to be posted on their own blogs, if they
    have such things, or on a dedicated page here. This would give new visitors some
    idea of what delights await them, and also be a generally cockle-warming exercise
    for all concerned. Just a (possibly ill-advised) thought, in a moment of grumpiness.'
