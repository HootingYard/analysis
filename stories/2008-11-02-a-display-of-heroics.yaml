  text: 'You''ve got to search for the hero inside yourself, particularly if you are
    the sort of weedy milksop who gets sand kicked into your face by musclebound beach
    bullies of pronounced homoerotic tendencies. The search for the hero must be addressed
    with rigour, and you must not allow yourself to be distracted. That is why you
    should immediately head off towards the dunes and find a secluded nook where you
    can cogitate uninterrupted. Take your towel with you, and your picnic basket,
    and the piccolo you brought to the beach with you to practise upon and which was
    the cause of much cruel merriment to the bronzed hulks who kicked sand in your
    face. But do not play your piccolo in the nook, for your mellifluous if inexpert
    piping will betray your location, and it is imperative that you remain quite alone
    during your search.

    It is, of course, a wholly cerebral search, one in which you must marshal all
    your mental powers to find within yourself the heroic instinct. Shut your eyes
    and imagine you are a microscopic being on an Isaac Asimov-style fantastic voyage
    through your body, beginning at the top of your head and working your way slowly
    down to your tiptoes. Somewhere between the two you will hope to find the hero.
    If you get all the way to your tiptoes without running it to ground, work your
    way back upwards, making sure you examine every little cranny and hideyhole, particularly
    any that might be lurking in the vicinity of your liver or your kidneys.

    If, even after the most tremendous searching, you have still not found the hero
    inside yourself, you must accept that you are indeed a weed and a milksop. The
    best thing to do is to slink away from the dunes, and thus from the beach, and
    to continue your piccolo practice elsewhere, for example in a cupboard or on a
    deserted sea-girt atoll.

    On the other hand, if you do find the hero inside yourself, open your eyes, pick
    up your towel and your picnic basket and your piccolo, and prance back to the
    beach to confront the bare-chested bullies. Rap each of them on the nose with
    your piccolo, and then spit in their eyes and stamp upon their toes. Make sure
    you have a helicopter standing by to whisk you away as soon as you are done, and
    as you fly off into the sunset, laugh your head off, and thumb your nose at your
    tormentors, who will rapidly appear tinier and tinier as the chopper ascends,
    until they are no bigger than ants, and just as easily squashed.'
