  text: "\nThis picture shows the mezzotintist Rex Tint, as a child, painting a portrait\
    \ of his sister Dot Tint, chronicler of vampiric sea shanties and much else besides.\
    \ Rex had great pretensions, in his curdled youth, to becoming a painter of note,\
    \ rather than a mezzotintist, and he executed innumerable daubs, of which the\
    \ portrait of Dot is but one. Several art critics have tugged at their beards\
    \ and fiddled with their hornrimmed spectacles as they struggle to understand\
    \ why Rex Tint abandoned paint and set out on the path to mezzotinty glory. Now\
    \ the tale can be told. Well, not \"can be\" but \"has been\", in Pebblehead's\
    \ latest bestselling paperback How The Secret Police Confiscated Rex Tint's Paintbox\
    \ And How He Sobbed And Whimpered Until A Kindly Butcher's Shop Assistant Gave\
    \ Him A Secondhand Mezzotinting Kit. Annoyingly, the prize-winning paperbackist\
    \ does not tell us the reason why the secret police targeted the tiny painter.\
    \ Had he perhaps daubed a less than flattering portrait of Prince Fulgencio? Or,\
    \ on one of his plein air excursions, had he unwittingly painted a top secret\
    \ experimental brain-incapacitating nerve gas facility? It really would help if\
    \ Pebblehead could do some proper research for a change, but I expect he is too\
    \ busy bashing out his next bestseller on that antique typewriter of his, looking\
    \ up occasionally at the picture of Anthony Burgess drawingpinned to his cork\
    \ board and pretending it is a mirror.\n "
