  text: "\nThis picture shows the mezzotintist Rex Tint, as a child, painting a portrait\
    \ of his sister Dot Tint, chronicler of vampiric sea shanties and much else besides.\
    \ Rex had great pretensions, in his curdled youth, to becoming a painter of note,\
    \ rather than a mezzotintist, and he executed innumerable daubs, of which the\
    \ portrait of Dot is but one. Several art critics have tugged at their beards\
    \ and fiddled with their hornrimmed spectacles as they struggle to understand\
    \ why Rex Tint abandoned paint and set out on the path to mezzotinty glory. Now\
    \ the tale can be told. Well, not \u201Ccan be\u201D but \u201Chas been\u201D\
    , in Pebblehead's latest bestselling paperback How The Secret Police Confiscated\
    \ Rex Tint's Paintbox And How He Sobbed And Whimpered Until A Kindly Butcher's\
    \ Shop Assistant Gave Him A Secondhand Mezzotinting Kit. Annoyingly, the prize-winning\
    \ paperbackist does not tell us the reason why the secret police targeted the\
    \ tiny painter. Had he perhaps daubed a less than flattering portrait of Prince\
    \ Fulgencio? Or, on one of his plein air excursions, had he unwittingly painted\
    \ a top secret experimental brain-incapacitating nerve gas facility? It really\
    \ would help if Pebblehead could do some proper research for a change, but I expect\
    \ he is too busy bashing out his next bestseller on that antique typewriter of\
    \ his, looking up occasionally at the picture of Anthony Burgess drawingpinned\
    \ to his cork board and pretending it is a mirror.\n\_"
