  text: Quite apart from anything else, the dimwits and barbarians have clearly overlooked
    the fact that "Latin and Greek are the only tongues in which departed spirits
    can be addressed, for this reason they are denominated the dead languages. The
    nonappearance of these supernatural beings in the present day, may be fairly ascribed
    to the decay of the learned languages." The anonymous contributor to The Mirror
    Of Taste, And Dramatic Censor, Volume I, Number 5 knew this much in May 1810,
    so the elected representatives of Bournemouth and Salisbury Councils and the unelected
    dullards at the Plain English Campaign ought to know it too. Perhaps if they wander
    down to their local Andy Burnham Chat 'n' Snack Zone before all the books disappear
    they might learn something.
