  text: 'A brief note. Those of you who read Hooting Yard via an RSS feed will have
    spotted that you now only get the opening lines of each post, and will have to
    visit the site itself to read the whole thing. The purpose of this change is not
    to inconvenience you unduly, but to ensure that you are compelled to keep glancing
    to the right, where you cannot fail to see the books available--a fourth one is
    due early in 2009--and of course the ''Donate'' button, designed to instil pangs
    of unbearable guilt that so many, many words have been offered freely over the
    past five years.A

    ADDENDUM : Actually, I ought to say that not all readers need be beset by guilt-pangs,
    as some of you have been very generous. You know who you are, and I thank you.'
