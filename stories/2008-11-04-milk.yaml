text: "Dan Chambers alerts me to this. Do people really buy mik from Amazon? Do they\
  \ really write reviews of the milk they buy? Are those reviews really such utter\
  \ twaddle? It is often said that Hooting Yard is \u201Ca bit weird\u201D or \u201C\
  eccentric\u201D or \u201Codd\u201D, but the so-called \u201Creal world\u201D is\
  \ a much, much stranger place."
