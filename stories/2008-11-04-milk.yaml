  text: Dan Chambers alerts me to this. Do people really buy mik from Amazon? Do they
    really write reviews of the milk they buy? Are those reviews really such utter
    twaddle? It is often said that Hooting Yard is "a bit weird" or "eccentric" or
    "odd", but the so-called "real world" is a much, much stranger place.
