  text: 'I am not sure whether to be amused or nauseated to learn that the cleverest
    person in the known universe is launching Club Fry, "an arena, a forum, a social
    network, a sodality, a society for the sharing of knowledge and passions". Nice
    to know it''s all being organised by what he calls "my team".

    Here at Haemoglobin Towers, I''ve decided that the only possible response is to
    set up Club Key. Not having a team of spellbound acolytes to do the jiggery-pokery,
    it might take some time to get it up and running. But what can you expect if you
    sign up?

    Club Key members will meet online, once a month, dressed in the club uniform of
    food-splattered cybertunics. Discussion will be limited to ornithological topics,
    for obvious reasons, and grunting, whimpering, whingeing and prating will be actively
    encouraged. Think of it, not as a Club Fry-style arena or forum blah blah blah,
    nor as the modern equivalent of a literary salon or eighteenth century coffee
    house, but as a pond, a brackish and stagnant pond, upon the bottom of which you
    wallow, breathing through a straw poking up into the stale air above, which is
    swarming with midges and gnats. Occasionally members will be given the opportunity
    to sprawl in a virtual drainage ditch, batting away flies and even vultures. Both
    hissy fits and projectile vomiting will be allowed.

    All club meetings will be recorded and posted on YouBoot, a version of the video
    sharing site which concentrates on violent kicking and stamping while wearing
    big sturdy hiking boots of the pixellated variety.

    I have every confidence that this initiative is going to take off in a big way,
    and that we shall easily outnumber the members of Club Uberbrain. In fact, I have
    such faith in the project that to get things started I''m going to splatter my
    cybertunic with genetically modified sponge pudding and go and round up some injured
    swallows from the local injured birds hospice right this minute.
