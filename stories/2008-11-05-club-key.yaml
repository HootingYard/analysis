  text: "I am not sure whether to be amused or nauseated to learn that the cleverest\
    \ person in the known universe is launching Club Fry,\_\u201Can arena, a forum,\
    \ a social network, a sodality, a society for the sharing of knowledge and passions\u201D\
    . Nice to know it's all being organised by what he calls \u201Cmy team\u201D.\n\
    Here at Haemoglobin Towers, I've decided that the only possible response is to\
    \ set up Club Key. Not having a team of spellbound acolytes to do the jiggery-pokery,\
    \ it might take some time to get it up and running. But what can you expect if\
    \ you sign up?\nClub Key members will meet online, once a month, dressed in the\
    \ club uniform of food-splattered cybertunics. Discussion will be limited to ornithological\
    \ topics, for obvious reasons, and grunting, whimpering, whingeing and prating\
    \ will be actively encouraged. Think of it, not as a Club Fry-style arena or forum\
    \ blah blah blah, nor as the modern equivalent of a literary salon or eighteenth\
    \ century coffee house, but as a pond, a brackish and stagnant pond, upon the\
    \ bottom of which you wallow, breathing through a straw poking up into the stale\
    \ air above, which is swarming with midges and gnats. Occasionally members will\
    \ be given the opportunity to sprawl in a virtual drainage ditch, batting away\
    \ flies and even vultures. Both hissy fits and projectile vomiting will be allowed.\n\
    All club meetings will be recorded and posted on YouBoot, a version of the video\
    \ sharing site which concentrates on violent kicking and stamping while wearing\
    \ big sturdy hiking boots of the pixellated variety.\nI have every confidence\
    \ that this initiative is going to take off in a big way, and that we shall easily\
    \ outnumber the members of Club Uberbrain. In fact, I have such faith in the project\
    \ that to get things started I'm going to splatter my cybertunic with genetically\
    \ modified sponge pudding and go and round up some injured swallows from the local\
    \ injured birds hospice right this minute.\n\_"
