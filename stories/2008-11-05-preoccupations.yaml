  text: "\nThere is absolutely no reason to post a picture of the Busby Babes today,\
    \ and I do so only to illustrate the following:\nDear Mr Key, writes P. Funnel,\
    \ I have been reading (actually re-reading) my way through the Hooting Yard archives,\
    \ and am struck by some of your preoccupations. There are things and people you\
    \ regularly refer to which seem to have little or nothing in common, no overarching\
    \ theme, as it were, yet you seem obsessed with them. A brief--but by no means\
    \ complete--list would include:\nThe Munich Air Disaster; the Kennedy Assassination;\
    \ Peter Maxwell Davies eating an accidentally-electrocuted whooper swan; the Hindenburg\
    \ Disaster; Yoko Ono; Googie Withers; David Blunkett.\nI realise that my selection\
    \ includes two aerial disasters, so that is a common thread, but otherwise none\
    \ of them seem to link up in any coherent way. Are there some profound psychological\
    \ reasons that cause you to harp on about these subjects, or are you just repeating\
    \ yourself? And whichever is the case, can you give any clues as to how one might\
    \ predict whether or not an event or a person might become embedded in your brain,\
    \ and thus crop up time and time again in Hooting Yard?\nI suppose it would be\
    \ polite of me to reply to these questions, so I will try at some point to frame\
    \ a response, once I have finished making my set of Hazel Blears finger puppets.\n\
    \ "
