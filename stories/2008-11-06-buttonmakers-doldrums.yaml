  text: 'Hepcat buttonmakers Gravelrenche are, I am sorry to say, in the doldrums.
    For decades, as fashions came and went, Gravelrenche buttons remained impossibly
    with-it and groovy, favoured by everyone from beatniks to dowager duchesses. Wander
    as one might from establishment drawing rooms to counterculture flophouses, the
    sharp-eyed buttonist would spot a Gravelrenche everywhere, on cardigans and greatcoats
    and weskits and spats. For this reason alone, banks and hedge funds and venture
    capitalists were willing to advance untold sums of cash to the company, without
    asking any questions or, indeed, specifying a date upon which they wanted their
    money back.

    Well, the crunch de la credit has put paid to that jolly state of affairs, and
    over the past six months Gravelrenche has been unable to secure any funding at
    all, just at the point where button sales have dried up. In the last quarter,
    the company sold just three buttons, to a demented oligarch, and there is not
    a single order on the books. Grim-looking envoys from the banks have been seen
    loitering in the vicinity of the Gravelrenche buttonarium, armed no doubt with
    terrifying legal papers. The buttonmaking executives, however, are nowhere to
    be found. But those seeking them are asking the wrong question. Instead of wondering
    "Where on earth are they?", they should be asking "Who the hell are they anyway?"

    Because the company purports to have been founded by brothers Pierre and Claude
    Gravelrenche, and operates in the sickly world of fashion, there is an assumption
    that, when located, its managers will be found to be stylish Eurosophisticates,
    the Jose Mourinhos of the world o'' buttons. Well, "boff!", as the French say.
    The presiding genius of Gravelrenche is in fact a toothless, evil-smelling lumberbones
    who lurks in a battered seaside boardinghouse and keeps all that cash he has eked
    over the years under his mattress. It is an enormous mattress. His name is neither
    Pierre nor Claude, nor even Gravelrenche, but something unpronounceable, the sort
    of chewy polysyllabic name that demands guttural improbabilities and an excess
    of phlegm if one wishes to speak it aloud properly. In the unlikely event that
    this man ever found himself in the boardroom of a bank, he would be turfed out
    on his grubby ear, mistaken for a vagrant.

    What path did so unprepossessing a figure take to become the world''s fabbest
    buttonmaker? Before answering that question, I want to digress for a moment to
    take a look at that word "unprepossessing". What''s that all about? "Possessing"
    means having, or owning. "Prepossessing" would mean already having or owning,
    being in possession before the fact. The "un-" prefix suggests that, far from
    already owning or having, one has not nor owns not. It is all a bit of a muddle
    as far as I am concerned, but that does not stop me from deploying the word as
    and when I want to, without a care in the world. If I wish to be verbose, then
    verbose I shall be, and a pox upon your strictures!

    As for the path of the buttonmaker, that is a fairly straightforward matter. In
    spite of the unprepossessing figure he presented, and his unpronounceable name,
    and the stainage upon his clothing, and the vermin creeping in his bouffant, and
    his curd-like pallor, and his toothlessness, and his frayed elbow patches, and
    his stink, and his lasciviousness, and his grubby ears, and his filthy neck, and
    his gullet like a pelican''s, and his squalid patrimony, and his lack of scruples,
    and his horrible head, and his one eye bigger than the other, and his unfamiliarity
    with soap, he had an almost eldritch talent for button design. He learned as much
    early, when he bumped into King Zog I, Skanderbeg III of the Albanians in the
    street, and the monarch was so smitten with the homemade buttons on the buttonmaker''s
    homemade cardigan that he emptied his pockets of Albanian and other currencies''
    banknotes and coins, pressed them into the buttonmaker''s mucky paws, and begged
    to be given the buttons in exchange. That very same evening, the King sported
    the buttons upon his fantastic kingly garb at a palace reception for wealthy Eurogits,
    and the buttonmaker''s future was assured. Over the ensuing decades, clients such
    as Ringo Starr and Pat Nixon and Christopher Plummer and Krishnan Guru-Murthy
    and Monica Vitti and the brothers Miliband and Kathy Kirby bought hundreds and
    thousands of Gravelrenche buttons, even millions in the case of Mick Jagger, all
    of them under the impression that they were dealing with swish, effortlessly stylish
    Pierre and Claude.

    Now we know those two dashing Gallic fashion titans never actually existed, and
    it seems the banks and hedge funds and venture capitalists may have caught on
    too, for ever since the crunch came, very little cash has been shoved under that
    enormous mattress in that fetid boardinghouse room on that windswept seafront
    where the buttonmaker lurks, chewing fish-heads and still, still, making his magnificent
    groovy buttons.'
