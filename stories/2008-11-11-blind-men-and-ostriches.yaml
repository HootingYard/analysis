  text: 'One of the combat sports which thrilled the crowds in the circuses of Ancient
    Rome was the pitting of blind men against ostriches. A savage and ugly spectacle,
    no doubt, and one quite out of keeping with our modern sensibilities, to say nothing
    of health and safety legislation. Yet I can''t help feeling that it would make
    a tremendous subject for a Gladiator-style movie blockbuster. The Antipodean player
    Russell Crowe--or, as I prefer to think of him, the Artist Formerly Known As Bouffanted
    Rockabilly Star Russ Le Roq--is so talented an actor one can imagine him playing
    either a blind man or, caked in prosthetics, an ostrich. What with the computer
    generated wizardry available to today''s film-makers, he could appear on our screens
    as both antagonists, and indeed, his image multiplied a thousandfold, as the baying
    blood-crazed crowd.

    I may put my mind to drafting a screenplay, in which our hero is, let''s say,
    an Ancient Roman haruspex who is blinded when a struggling chicken whose entrails
    he is attempting to rip out pokes its taloned feet into his eyes. From there it
    is a short and sorry journey to the Colosseum, where an enraged and starving ostrich
    awaits. It strikes me that, if there is a need to do the film on the cheap, a
    high-tech ostrich outfit could be dispensed with. Russell Crowe is, famously,
    a knitting enthusiast, and given the right wool he could knit his own ostrich
    costume.

    Add a musical soundtrack of bumptious ditties by Randy Newman, and I suspect this
    could be a surefire hit.'
