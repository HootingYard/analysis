  text: "One of the combat sports which thrilled the crowds in the circuses of Ancient\
    \ Rome was the pitting of blind men against ostriches. A savage and ugly spectacle,\
    \ no doubt, and one quite out of keeping with our modern sensibilities, to say\
    \ nothing of health and safety legislation. Yet I can't help feeling that it would\
    \ make a tremendous subject for a Gladiator-style movie blockbuster. The Antipodean\
    \ player Russell Crowe\u2014or, as I prefer to think of him, the Artist Formerly\
    \ Known As Bouffanted Rockabilly Star Russ Le Roq\u2014is so talented an actor\
    \ one can imagine him playing either a blind man or, caked in prosthetics, an\
    \ ostrich. What with the computer generated wizardry available to today's film-makers,\
    \ he could appear on our screens as both antagonists, and indeed, his image multiplied\
    \ a thousandfold, as the baying blood-crazed crowd.\nI may put my mind to drafting\
    \ a screenplay, in which our hero is, let's say, an Ancient Roman haruspex who\
    \ is blinded when a struggling chicken whose entrails he is attempting to rip\
    \ out pokes its taloned feet into his eyes. From there it is a short and sorry\
    \ journey to the Colosseum, where an enraged and starving ostrich awaits. It strikes\
    \ me that, if there is a need to do the film on the cheap, a high-tech ostrich\
    \ outfit could be dispensed with. Russell Crowe is, famously, a knitting enthusiast,\
    \ and given the right wool he could knit his own ostrich costume.\nAdd a musical\
    \ soundtrack of bumptious ditties by Randy Newman, and I suspect this could be\
    \ a surefire hit."
