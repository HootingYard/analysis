  text: The Fire Wire has an amusing list of Secret Service codenames for American
    presidents and their nearest and dearest. Naturally, I am disappointed that neither
    "Broadsword" nor "Danny Boy" has been used, these of course being the codenames
    spectacularly en-un-cia-ted by Richard Burton (for himself and the great Michael
    Hordern) in Where Eagles Dare (1968). Still, at least I now know to refer to Richard
    Milhous Nixon as "Searchlight" in future.
