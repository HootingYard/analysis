  text: "It was the day of the annual Channel Four newsreaders' outing, and this year\
    \ it was Katie Razzall's turn to choose their destination. After much thought,\
    \ peering out of a window of the studio annexe into the pouring rain, she had\
    \ decided they should picnic next to Schubert's grave in the Central Cemetery\
    \ in Vienna.\nBetween them, Jon Snow and Carl Dinnen both packed and carried the\
    \ picnic basket.\n\"It is more of a hamper than a basket,\" said Carl, as they\
    \ lugged it along the path towards the imposing tombstone with its Karl Kundmann\
    \ relief.\n\"I wonder how one would best define the difference between a basket\
    \ and a hamper,\" replied Jon.\nLindsey Hilsum, who was walking alongside them\
    \ carrying a banjo in a banjo case, supplied them with just such a definition.\n\
    On this occasion, responsibility for the picnic blanket had been entrusted to\
    \ Samira Ahmed. The previous year, Krishnan Guru-Murthy had carelessly tossed\
    \ the blanket into the sea during what had been a startlingly rough crossing.\
    \ As pro tem captain of the boat, Alex Thomson had tried to shoulder the blame,\
    \ but there had been much muttering about Krishnan's cavalier tossage. The general\
    \ feeling was that, just because the boat was being buffeted by extraordinary\
    \ waves and seawater was sloshing about the deck was no reason for him to have\
    \ been such a flibbertigibbet. Jonathan Rugman argued that, given his surname,\
    \ and the similarity of a blanket to a rug, he ought to be the one charged with\
    \ bringing the picnic blanket safely to the picnic spot, but Samira overruled\
    \ him.\n\"In any case,\" she said, \"Your name is Rugman, not Blanketman, and\
    \ there is a difference between a picnic rug and a picnic blanket, a difference\
    \ which I am sure Lindsey can make crystal clear.\"\n\"I'm not sure I could,\"\
    \ said Lindsay Taylor. It was pointed out to him that Samira meant Lindsey Hilsum.\n\
    Kylie Morris and Cathy Newman were lagging behind, grubbing for worms in the rich\
    \ cemetery soil. They had been told by Gary Gibbon that Viennese worms made the\
    \ best bait for anglers, though whether this was true or not was a moot point.\
    \ Gary himself was trying to catch up with Lindsey Hilsum. He was cradling his\
    \ cornet in his arms and wanted to have a quick chat with her about the duet they\
    \ would play once the picnic was in full swing. Darshna Soni had suggested a medley\
    \ of special picnic songs she had written with Sue Turton, but the parts were\
    \ very complicated, and probably called for a bassoon and xylophone, neither of\
    \ which instruments was to hand.\nBy now most of the newsreaders had reached the\
    \ grave.\n\"Here music has buried a treasure, but even fairer hopes,\" declaimed\
    \ Faisal Islam, doing an impromptu translation of the epitaph inscribed on the\
    \ tombstone.\n\"Who wrote that?\" asked Nicholas Glass.\n\"I think you will find\
    \ it was the poet Franz Grillparzer,\" piped up Simon Israel, who, in spite of\
    \ the chilly weather, was not wearing any socks. Earlier, he had explained to\
    \ Victoria MacDonald that this was his small way of testing himself and pitting\
    \ himself against nature.\nSamira spread the blanket out with help from Julian\
    \ Rush and Lucy Manning, and soon they were all picnicking happily in the shadow\
    \ of Schubert's grave. The only thing that cast a pall on their outing was the\
    \ looming presence in the sky of a flock of rare Viennese vultures. Emily Reuben\
    \ threw pebbles at them, and Roz Upton shouted bird-scarifying imprecations, but\
    \ neither tactic made the flock disperse. But it did not rain, as it had threatened\
    \ to do, and they did not after all have to unroll the big tarpaulin that Nick\
    \ Paton Walsh had brought along with him just in case.\nOne of the interesting\
    \ things about Channel Four newsreader picnics was the way they distributed the\
    \ food. So, Jon, Samira and Nicholas ate only the cocktail sausages, Krishnan\
    \ and Sue the celery sticks with a drizzle of gin, Victoria, Julian and Alex the\
    \ individually-wrapped turnip pies, Kylie and Simon the cheeseballs, Cathy, Katie\
    \ and Faisal the cheese triangles, Lindsey and Lindsay the potato peelings with\
    \ suet, Darshna, Roz and Lucy the cuppasoup, Nick and Jonathan the Garibaldi biscuits,\
    \ and Emily, Carl and Gary the lettuce tart. All of them, however, drank copious\
    \ quantities of boiled Viennese beans 'n' cabbage water, sprinkled with icing\
    \ sugar.\nIt was a grand outing, and this year's pro tem boat captain, Kylie,\
    \ steered them skilfully and safely back across the channel so they were in the\
    \ studio by five to seven, in time for the news.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "
