  text: 'A book like no other that ever will be, as twenty brilliant acknowledgements
    from literary sovereigns,--"scintillating," "fascinating," "subtle," "sincere,"
    "sublime," "gorgeous," "fantastic," "exquisite," "ambrosial," "most soul-compelling,"
    "so suggestive of still higher things," "a glimpse into Eleusinian mysteries or
    the literature of the planet Mars," "like purple mountain peaks rising above the
    clouds and disappearing in the whiteness of shrouds of mist,"--expressly and by
    necessary implication agree.

    There is nothing like it in literature; and a splendid mind it is that goes flashing
    on through these pages.

    The ebullition of your thoughts makes me feel as if I had been attracted to within
    a few hundred miles of the sun and had his gas-jets in full view.

    Thanks to Odd Ends, I have learned that these measured statements appeared on
    the back cover of My Soundspeed Discovery, Expanding into a Constructive Medley
    of Wit and Song; being a Four Years After-Inflorescence of The Life-Romance of
    an Algebraist, by George Winslow Pierce (1895). I think we can honestly say that
    such a matchless blurb applies equally well to Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude
    & Pippy Bags.'
