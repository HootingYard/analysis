  text: 'I felt pangs when I lost my lozenge. I was in a bricked-up brutalist bricky
    building when I noticed it was missing. I''d mislaid it before, once on a Thursday
    and once outside a tent on a campsite of many gusts. It''s a yellow lozenge, a
    small cake or tablet of medicine and sugar meant to be held in the mouth and dissolved,
    but I have never put it in my mouth. I carry it in the pocket of my trousers,
    whichever pair of trousers I am wearing, and it is from my pocket it must have
    fallen, earlier, without my noticing. On the Thursday I found my lozenge within
    minutes, it had dropped on to the floor, and the floor was covered in bright red
    linoleum, so the yellow of my lozenge was easily visible. Outside the tent I was
    perplexed, but a passing widow woman approached me holding my lozenge in her black-gloved
    hand and said she had seen it tumble on to the grass when I was doing calisthenics
    a few minutes before. Usually when I do my jumping about and somersaulting and
    so on I wedge my lozenge deep into my pocket and push a scrunched-up rag or dry
    dishcloth in on top of it, but at the campsite I neglected to do so, for I was
    distracted by the millions of starlings swooping in the sky. In the bricky building,
    however, there was no red linoleum and nor was there a helpful widow woman. Also,
    it was bricked-up, so there was little light for me to see by, and soon it would
    be dusk and the bricky building would be darker still. I did not know if I had
    lost my lozenge here or elsewhere. No wonder I felt pangs.

    The pangs began in the pit of my stomach, as pangs often do, and slowly moved
    upwards until I felt a constriction in my throat. Pangs like those, that interfere
    with one''s breathing, can be lethal. To think that I might perish through pangs
    for something as tiny as a lost lozenge! And it was a very tiny lozenge. When
    manufactured, in, I supposed, a lozengery, it had been somewhat bigger, but before
    it came into my possession it had been partially sucked upon and  some of the
    outer coating had thus dissolved. The semi-sucked state of the lozenge was the
    reason it was so precious to me, and why I kept it in the pocket of my trousers,
    and felt pangs when it was lost. To be more precise, it was the identity of the
    sucker that was important, for this lozenge had been sucked by my all-time hero,
    the wrestling champion Bruno La Poubelle. He choked on it, and spat it out, and
    it landed at my feet, for I happened to be standing next to my hero on the balcony
    of a plush hotel. He was a guest, of course, whereas I was a mere employee of
    the hotel, a mopper of balcony tiles, with my mop and bucket. Bruno La Poubelle
    stopped choking as soon as he expelled the lozenge, turned around and swept back
    into his suite, and I picked up the lozenge and popped it into my pocket. That
    was years ago, and I have treasured the lozenge ever since, and kept it safe,
    except for the Thursday and the gusty campsite and, now, today, when for the third
    time I have mislaid it.

    I had other La Poubelle memorabilia: a milk tooth, a discarded cochlear implant,
    a battery from his wrestling training machine. These were displayed in a small
    votive shrine I had made in my kitchenette, but the lozenge I preferred to keep
    on my person. Now, leaning against a wall in the bricked-up building, I mentally
    retraced the steps on my journey here, trying to recall where I might have been
    when last I was sure that the lozenge was in my pocket. There were many, many
    steps to remember, for I had come from afar, on foot. I knew that I had the lozenge
    at Sawdust Bridge, because I had to turn out my pockets at the customs post. I
    distinctly recalled putting it back in my pocket after the frantically-eyebrowed
    customs man gave me the tap with his tappy stick, clearing me to carry on across
    the bridge and down through the subterranean car park, past the gated Hazchem
    compound and up again on to the path alongside the allotments. From there I hurried
    past the haunted zoo and slowed my pace as I forded the river at Shallow Sludge,
    crossed the football pitch and the park and the airfield, then rolled down the
    slope towards the puddles and ponds and the hermitage. There was another customs
    post hereabouts, but it was deserted, watched over by a solitary mordant heron.
    I struggled through bindweed and brambles and then followed for a few miles the
    line of the Great Celestial Pneumatic Railway until I reached the engine house,
    where I turned off past the crushers and hooters and thumpers and clunkers and
    carried on past the swan hospice and the post office and the ear clinic, where
    Bruno La Poubelle had discarded that cochlear implant and had a second one fitted,
    and the glue factory and the paper mill and the lunatic asylum and the terracotta
    army parade ground and the canoe maker''s and the clown shop and the windmill
    and the newsagent and the Aztec fundamentalist temple and the trendy so-called
    "suet pudding skyscraper" and the bordello and the ironworks and the futuristic
    plasma ray gun repair shop and the guide dog enclosure and the bell foundry and
    the cave full of vampire bats and the other cave and the country club and the
    patch of muck and the bowling alley and Rolf Harris''s house and the pit of fire
    and the pit of doom and the buttercup fields and the sinister laboratory and I
    ended up here at the bricked-up brutalist bricky building and discovered that
    I had lost my lozenge.

    When I arrived, of course, the bricky building was not fully bricked-up. I was
    able to make my entrance through an unlocked side door which led into the gloomy
    vestibule, on the walls of which hung the stuffed heads of otters and badgers
    and giraffes. I lay down on the floor to take a nap, and when I awoke I found
    that, while I slept, the remaining unbricked-up bits of the building had been
    bricked-up. I was so beset with pangs about my lost lozenge that it did not immediately
    occur to me that I was trapped. Now I have realised that is the case, I am going
    to have to do something about it. I am a shape-shifter, so  will shimmer ethereally
    for a few seconds and become like a beetle, and scuttle out of the bricky building
    through pipes and ducts. It will take much longer to retrace my steps in beetle-form,
    but it will be another fortnight before I can shape-shift again, and I will search
    diligently for my lozenge, and hope I am not trampled underfoot by the crowds
    making their way to the wrestling stadium for Bruno La Poubelle''s final bout.
