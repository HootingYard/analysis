  text: "I felt pangs when I lost my lozenge. I was in a bricked-up brutalist bricky\
    \ building when I noticed it was missing. I'd mislaid it before, once on a Thursday\
    \ and once outside a tent on a campsite of many gusts. It's a yellow lozenge,\
    \ a small cake or tablet of medicine and sugar meant to be held in the mouth and\
    \ dissolved, but I have never put it in my mouth. I carry it in the pocket of\
    \ my trousers, whichever pair of trousers I am wearing, and it is from my pocket\
    \ it must have fallen, earlier, without my noticing. On the Thursday I found my\
    \ lozenge within minutes, it had dropped on to the floor, and the floor was covered\
    \ in bright red linoleum, so the yellow of my lozenge was easily visible. Outside\
    \ the tent I was perplexed, but a passing widow woman approached me holding my\
    \ lozenge in her black-gloved hand and said she had seen it tumble on to the grass\
    \ when I was doing calisthenics a few minutes before. Usually when I do my jumping\
    \ about and somersaulting and so on I wedge my lozenge deep into my pocket and\
    \ push a scrunched-up rag or dry dishcloth in on top of it, but at the campsite\
    \ I neglected to do so, for I was distracted by the millions of starlings swooping\
    \ in the sky. In the bricky building, however, there was no red linoleum and nor\
    \ was there a helpful widow woman. Also, it was bricked-up, so there was little\
    \ light for me to see by, and soon it would be dusk and the bricky building would\
    \ be darker still. I did not know if I had lost my lozenge here or elsewhere.\
    \ No wonder I felt pangs.\nThe pangs began in the pit of my stomach, as pangs\
    \ often do, and slowly moved upwards until I felt a constriction in my throat.\
    \ Pangs like those, that interfere with one's breathing, can be lethal. To think\
    \ that I might perish through pangs for something as tiny as a lost lozenge! And\
    \ it was a very tiny lozenge. When manufactured, in, I supposed, a lozengery,\
    \ it had been somewhat bigger, but before it came into my possession it had been\
    \ partially sucked upon and\_ some of the outer coating had thus dissolved. The\
    \ semi-sucked state of the lozenge was the reason it was so precious to me, and\
    \ why I kept it in the pocket of my trousers, and felt pangs when it was lost.\
    \ To be more precise, it was the identity of the sucker that was important, for\
    \ this lozenge had been sucked by my all-time hero, the wrestling champion Bruno\
    \ La Poubelle. He choked on it, and spat it out, and it landed at my feet, for\
    \ I happened to be standing next to my hero on the balcony of a plush hotel. He\
    \ was a guest, of course, whereas I was a mere employee of the hotel, a mopper\
    \ of balcony tiles, with my mop and bucket. Bruno La Poubelle stopped choking\
    \ as soon as he expelled the lozenge, turned around and swept back into his suite,\
    \ and I picked up the lozenge and popped it into my pocket. That was years ago,\
    \ and I have treasured the lozenge ever since, and kept it safe, except for the\
    \ Thursday and the gusty campsite and, now, today, when for the third time I have\
    \ mislaid it.\nI had other La Poubelle memorabilia: a milk tooth, a discarded\
    \ cochlear implant, a battery from his wrestling training machine. These were\
    \ displayed in a small votive shrine I had made in my kitchenette, but the lozenge\
    \ I preferred to keep on my person. Now, leaning against a wall in the bricked-up\
    \ building, I mentally retraced the steps on my journey here, trying to recall\
    \ where I might have been when last I was sure that the lozenge was in my pocket.\
    \ There were many, many steps to remember, for I had come from afar, on foot.\
    \ I knew that I had the lozenge at Sawdust Bridge, because I had to turn out my\
    \ pockets at the customs post. I distinctly recalled putting it back in my pocket\
    \ after the frantically-eyebrowed customs man gave me the tap with his tappy stick,\
    \ clearing me to carry on across the bridge and down through the subterranean\
    \ car park, past the gated Hazchem compound and up again on to the path alongside\
    \ the allotments. From there I hurried past the haunted zoo and slowed my pace\
    \ as I forded the river at Shallow Sludge, crossed the football pitch and the\
    \ park and the airfield, then rolled down the slope towards the puddles and ponds\
    \ and the hermitage. There was another customs post hereabouts, but it was deserted,\
    \ watched over by a solitary mordant heron. I struggled through bindweed and brambles\
    \ and then followed for a few miles the line of the Great Celestial Pneumatic\
    \ Railway until I reached the engine house, where I turned off past the crushers\
    \ and hooters and thumpers and clunkers and carried on past the swan hospice and\
    \ the post office and the ear clinic, where Bruno La Poubelle had discarded that\
    \ cochlear implant and had a second one fitted, and the glue factory and the paper\
    \ mill and the lunatic asylum and the terracotta army parade ground and the canoe\
    \ maker's and the clown shop and the windmill and the newsagent and the Aztec\
    \ fundamentalist temple and the trendy so-called \u201Csuet pudding skyscraper\u201D\
    \ and the bordello and the ironworks and the futuristic plasma ray gun repair\
    \ shop and the guide dog enclosure and the bell foundry and the cave full of vampire\
    \ bats and the other cave and the country club and the patch of muck and the bowling\
    \ alley and Rolf Harris's house and the pit of fire and the pit of doom and the\
    \ buttercup fields and the sinister laboratory and I ended up here at the bricked-up\
    \ brutalist bricky building and discovered that I had lost my lozenge.\nWhen I\
    \ arrived, of course, the bricky building was not fully bricked-up. I was able\
    \ to make my entrance through an unlocked side door which led into the gloomy\
    \ vestibule, on the walls of which hung the stuffed heads of otters and badgers\
    \ and giraffes. I lay down on the floor to take a nap, and when I awoke I found\
    \ that, while I slept, the remaining unbricked-up bits of the building had been\
    \ bricked-up. I was so beset with pangs about my lost lozenge that it did not\
    \ immediately occur to me that I was trapped. Now I have realised that is the\
    \ case, I am going to have to do something about it. I am a shape-shifter, so\_\
    \ will shimmer ethereally for a few seconds and become like a beetle, and scuttle\
    \ out of the bricky building through pipes and ducts. It will take much longer\
    \ to retrace my steps in beetle-form, but it will be another fortnight before\
    \ I can shape-shift again, and I will search diligently for my lozenge, and hope\
    \ I am not trampled underfoot by the crowds making their way to the wrestling\
    \ stadium for Bruno La Poubelle's final bout.\n\_"
