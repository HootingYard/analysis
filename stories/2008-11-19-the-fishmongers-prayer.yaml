  text: '"Oh Lord, through Thy infinite grace, shower my counter with bream and plaice"
    is the opening couplet of the Fishmongers'' Prayer. This has the distinction of
    being the longest prayer in the English language, which is why you will rarely
    hear it recited in full. Its length is due to the fact that, within the rolling
    cadences of its many, many verses, all known types of fish, both edible and inedible,
    are mentioned at least once. It was the work of a piscatorial monomaniac named
    Egbert Bock. He was not himself a practising fishmonger, nor indeed did he live
    in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy little man whose ears
    were perplexingly shaped, inasmuch as they looked as if they had been stuck to
    his head upside down. His obsession with fish is thought to have been caused by
    a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders. Nine times out of
    ten such happenstance will lead to a phobia, but in Bock''s case it had precisely
    the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were made upon his brain
    after his death, it was discovered that the areas devoted to fish and the mongering
    of fish were terrifically shrivelled. Some seaside vicars still include an abridged
    version of the Fishmongers'' Prayer in their services. But not many.'
