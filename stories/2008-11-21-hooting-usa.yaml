    \ memorandum from R.:\nIt is unimaginably strange to hear an \u2018Unspeakable\
    \ Desolation\u2019 story read in a US accent \u2026 for those not traumatised\
    \ by the mere suggestion, http://tinyurl.com/58avg5\_ is the place to go, but\
    \ you have to weather an advertisement, a dictionary definition, and some stuff\
    \ about trains before the dawning of the Main Feature. \u2018Weird, awesome stuff,\u2019\
    \ the host declares.\nI have to say I like Norm Sherman's narration very much,\
    \ particularly the way he intones the words \u201Cmagnetic \u2026 mute \u2026\
    \ blind \u2026 love monkeys\u201D.\_"
