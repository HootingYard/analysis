  text: 'In case it''s overlooked in the Comments to the piece below, here is an informative
    memorandum from R.:

    It is unimaginably strange to hear an ''Unspeakable Desolation'' story read in
    a US accent ... for those not traumatised by the mere suggestion, http://tinyurl.com/58avg5  is
    the place to go, but you have to weather an advertisement, a dictionary definition,
    and some stuff about trains before the dawning of the Main Feature. ''Weird, awesome
    stuff,'' the host declares.

    I have to say I like Norm Sherman''s narration very much, particularly the way
    he intones the words "magnetic ... mute ... blind ... love monkeys".'
