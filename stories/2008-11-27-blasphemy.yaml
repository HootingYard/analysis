  text: "The witterings posted below reminded me of the complete lack of fury caused\
    \ by Hooting Yard's own Mohammed Cartoon non-controversy. Back in September 2006,\
    \ to accompany a piece called Blodgett's Jihad, a blasphemous portrayal of \u201C\
    the Prophet\u201D appeared here without causing ructions. Here it is again. Shield\
    \ your eyes if you do not wish to be offended.\n\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\
