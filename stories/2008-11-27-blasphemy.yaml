  text: 'The witterings posted below reminded me of the complete lack of fury caused
    by Hooting Yard''s own Mohammed Cartoon non-controversy. Back in September 2006,
    to accompany a piece called Blodgett''s Jihad, a blasphemous portrayal of "the
    Prophet" appeared here without causing ructions. Here it is again. Shield your
    eyes if you do not wish to be offended.
