    Bear in mind, as you consider the spiritual wisdom that follows, that Allah is
    routinely described by his adherents as "merciful". I''d hate to come across him
    in a bad mood...

    The hellfire is a place of the most extreme suffering, the most extreme pain of
    every level that you can imagine--physical, mental, and spiritual pain and suffering
    and torment. It is a place where Allah will burn the skins of the people, and
    then he will recreate their skins, and burn the skins again, so that the people
    in there will taste the punishment. It is a place of heat, a place of pain, a
    place of suffering. The people will cry in agony for water. They will cry for
    a drink--something to cool them--and they will be given water, they will be given
    a drink, but it is boiling water that will scald their faces and burn their insides.

    They will drink from a river, a river that is made from the pus that flows out
    of the wounds of the people of the hellfire. The wounds of the people of the hellfire
    will ooze pus, and this pus will gather together to form a river, and this is
    all they will have to drink. And their food will be the tree of Zakum, a tree
    the fruits of which are like the heads of devils. This tree is so bitter that
    if the people try to eat it, they can''t eat it. But they will force themselves,
    because there is nothing else to eat in the hellfire--a place where the people
    will neither live, nor will they die, a place where the people will fall into
    despair, arguing with each other, admonishing each other, criticizing each other.
    The fire will surround them in every place. The smallest punishment of the hellfire
    is that a person will wear a pair of sandals of fire, and their brain will boil....

    Thus Anthony Abdul Rahim Green, spouting on Peace TV, amusingly dubbed the "24
    Hour Islamic Spiritual Edutainment Satellite TV Channel". Thanks to Mick Hartley.'
