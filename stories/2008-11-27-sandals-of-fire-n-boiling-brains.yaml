  text: "There's nothing quite like a bit of eye-popping religious frenzy, is there?\
    \ Bear in mind, as you consider the spiritual wisdom that follows, that Allah\
    \ is routinely described by his adherents as \u201Cmerciful\u201D. I'd hate to\
    \ come across him in a bad mood\u2026\nThe hellfire is a place of the most extreme\
    \ suffering, the most extreme pain of every level that you can imagine\u2014physical,\
    \ mental, and spiritual pain and suffering and torment. It is a place where Allah\
    \ will burn the skins of the people, and then he will recreate their skins, and\
    \ burn the skins again, so that the people in there will taste the punishment.\
    \ It is a place of heat, a place of pain, a place of suffering. The people will\
    \ cry in agony for water. They will cry for a drink\u2014something to cool them\u2014\
    and they will be given water, they will be given a drink, but it is boiling water\
    \ that will scald their faces and burn their insides.\nThey will drink from a\
    \ river, a river that is made from the pus that flows out of the wounds of the\
    \ people of the hellfire. The wounds of the people of the hellfire will ooze pus,\
    \ and this pus will gather together to form a river, and this is all they will\
    \ have to drink. And their food will be the tree of\_Zakum, a tree the fruits\
    \ of which are like the heads of devils. This tree is so bitter that if the people\
    \ try to eat it, they can't eat it. But they will force themselves, because there\
    \ is nothing else to eat in the hellfire\u2014a place where the people will neither\
    \ live, nor will they die, a place where the people will fall into despair, arguing\
    \ with each other, admonishing each other, criticizing each other. The fire will\
    \ surround them in every place. The smallest punishment of the hellfire is that\
    \ a person will wear a pair of sandals of fire, and their brain will boil\u2026\
    .\nThus Anthony Abdul Rahim Green, spouting on Peace TV, amusingly dubbed the\
    \ \u201C24 Hour Islamic Spiritual Edutainment Satellite TV Channel\u201D. Thanks\
    \ to Mick Hartley.\_"
