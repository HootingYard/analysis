    One thing is abundantly clear. I am going to have to write a story to which this
    picture can serve as an illustration. I expect that in my tale Tiny Tim will be
    cast aside and replaced by Tiny Enid. The plucky heroine has not, to date, found
    herself concealed inside the hollow head of a mechanical man, so it is about time
    she did.

    You can see the original source of the picture at Monster Brains.'
