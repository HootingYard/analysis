  text: "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne thing is abundantly\
    \ clear. I am going to have to write a story to which this picture can serve as\
    \ an illustration. I expect that in my tale Tiny Tim will be cast aside and replaced\
    \ by Tiny Enid. The plucky heroine has not, to date, found herself concealed inside\
    \ the hollow head of a mechanical man, so it is about time she did.\nYou can see\
    \ the original source of the picture at Monster Brains."
