  text: 'Diligent readers of the Comments will know that the other day I got into
    a bit of a flap when someone had the temerity to include one of those godawful
    smiley faces to accompany her observations on the "Prophet" Mohammed cartoon.
    Indeed, so grumpy did I become that I could only becalm myself by mooing like
    a cow, which I am given to understand is a proven relaxation technique peddled
    by stress counsellors. I mooed the afternoon away, and so intensely did I immerse
    myself in cowdom that, at dusk, I found myself standing in a field, staring blankly
    at nothing, while gnats and midges hovered in the air around me.

    While I was thus engaged, Antipodean Hooting Yard researcher Glyn Webster made
    better use of his time. He has devised an extremely helpful Table Of Non-Blotzmann
    Smileys which is reproduced below. Mr Webster has suggested that it may be possible
    for a boffin to tinker with the WordPress software to make these the default symbols
    for Hooting Yard and, while I do not encourage the use of them at all, this is
    well worth looking into.
