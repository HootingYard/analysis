  text: "Diligent readers of the Comments will know that the other day I got into\
    \ a bit of a flap when someone had the temerity to include one of those godawful\
    \ smiley faces to accompany her observations on the \u201CProphet\u201D Mohammed\
    \ cartoon. Indeed, so grumpy did I become that I could only becalm myself by mooing\
    \ like a cow, which I am given to understand is a proven relaxation technique\
    \ peddled by stress counsellors. I mooed the afternoon away, and so intensely\
    \ did I immerse myself in cowdom that, at dusk, I found myself standing in a field,\
    \ staring blankly at nothing, while gnats and midges hovered in the air around\
    \ me.\nWhile I was thus engaged, Antipodean Hooting Yard researcher Glyn Webster\
    \ made better use of his time. He has devised an extremely helpful Table Of Non-Bl\xF6\
    tzmann Smileys which is reproduced below. Mr Webster has suggested that it may\
    \ be possible for a boffin to tinker with the WordPress software to make these\
    \ the default symbols for Hooting Yard and, while I do not encourage the use of\
    \ them at all, this is well worth looking into.\n\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\_\n\
