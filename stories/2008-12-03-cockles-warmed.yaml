text: Recently I bemoaned the fact that, not being a member of the literary in-crowd,
  I find it impossible to get my books reviewed. While not being reviews as such,
  a couple of blog posts devoted to Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude & Pippy Bags warmed
  what pass for the cockles of my heart. When you have read what Georgy Riecke and
  The Lumber Room had to say, you would do well to immerse yourself in the rest of
  their outpourings.
