    \ ourselves for a move to new headquarters. Well, at long last the builders and\
    \ painters and plumbers and decorators and sundry other artisans have finished\
    \ their labours, and we can move in! By chance, a snap of our fantastic new base\
    \ in its finished state has appeared on the Unmitigated England blog. Here it\
    \ is, in all its glory:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "
