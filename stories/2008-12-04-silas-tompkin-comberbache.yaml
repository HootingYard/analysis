  text: 'As a rider, his attempts ended frequently in disaster: "Within this week
    I have been thrown three times from my Horse, and run away with to no small pertubation
    of my nervous system." He developed saddle sores, "dreadfully troublesome eruptions,
    which so grimly constellated my Posteriors."

    An amusing account of Samuel Taylor Coleridge''s military career from Bill Peschel.'
