  text: "As a rider, his attempts ended frequently in disaster: \"Within this week\
    \ I have been thrown three times from my Horse, and run away with to no small\
    \ pertubation of my nervous system.\" He developed saddle sores, \"dreadfully\
    \ troublesome eruptions, which so grimly constellated my Posteriors.\" \nAn amusing\
    \ account of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's military career from Bill Peschel."
