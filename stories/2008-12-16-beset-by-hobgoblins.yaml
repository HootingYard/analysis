  text: "To those of you fretting at the silence that has descended upon Hooting Yard\
    \ recently, be it known that I have, for the past week or so, been beset by hobgoblins\
    \ that scampered out of the wainscot. They may well have been Vatican hobgoblins,\
    \ for one of them let slip, while besetting me, that the cashpoint machine or\
    \ ATM from which it had that morning withdrawn funds displayed its instructions\
    \ in Latin. While I was aware that the Vatican City is the only state, or statelet,\
    \ to have programmed its cashpoints thus, I had no idea that hobgoblins had need\
    \ of banknotes, or indeed of money in any form. So intent was this particular\
    \ hobgoblin on besetting me, however, that it took not a jot of notice of my politely\
    \ shrieked queries regarding its financial affairs, so I am none the wiser.\n\
    Another thing I did not know was that for decades there had been hobgoblins skulking\
    \ behind the wainscot, biding their time. This was a shocking revelation. So quietly\
    \ had they been preparing to beset me, over all those years, that I did not have\
    \ an inkling of their existence. Nor had they betrayed their presence when I was\
    \ doing the odd bit of wainscot-related do-it-yourself handiwork in the dying\
    \ days of the John Major government. Armed with a secondhand Barry Bucknell book,\
    \ I had been keen to cut my chops on a simple project, though I must confess that\
    \ I abandoned the work before the wainscot was fully rejigged, or whatever it\
    \ was I was doing to it, and I have more or less neglected to follow up with any\
    \ other home improvement jobs in the succeeding years. There have been other calls\
    \ upon my time, which I will not go into here, except to point out, because it\
    \ is pertinent, that during the first years of the Blair administration I learned\
    \ much about he-man wrestling holds, though as an observer rather than as a practitioner.\
    \ I had little opportunity to watch actual wrestling bouts where real wrestlers\
    \ demonstrated the holds I was learning about, and I relied for the most part\
    \ on black-and-white diagrams sprinkled throughout a Teach Yourself He-Man Wrestling\
    \ Holds book I had acquired at a rummage sale.\nSo when the hobgoblins came scampering\
    \ from the wainscot, I thought to effect a citizen's arrest\u2014or a series of\
    \ citizen's arrests\u2014by using the techniques I had taught myself through painstaking\
    \ study of he-man wrestling hold diagrams, often by candlelight on stormy winter\
    \ nights. Alas, through lack of practice I had grown rusty. This was stuff I had\
    \ learned when Frank Dobson was the Health Secretary, it was that long ago. I\
    \ was quite unable to gain any purchase on the limbs or necks of the besetting\
    \ hobgoblins, and they slithered and squirmed from my grasp with quicksilver ease.\n\
    I wondered if I might persuade them to desist by poking them with a fork. Somewhere\
    \ I had read that this was an effective deterrent with other types of goblin,\
    \ so it seemed a reasonable assumption that it would work with hobgoblins, even\
    \ ones which originated in the Vatican, if that was indeed the case. As I dashed\
    \ into the kitchenette flapping my hands at my besetters, I recalled that the\
    \ article I had read\u2014in a magazine devoted either to forks or to goblins\u2014\
    recommended first poking one's fork into a pickled onion. Thus would the tines\
    \ of the fork be coated with anti-goblin juices, including pickling brine. Now\
    \ as it happened, only the day before, in a fit of peckishness, I had gorged myself\
    \ stupid on pickled onions, and on other pickled items, and my cupboards were\
    \ bare, at least in that foodstuff subsection. Poking my fork into a fairy cake\
    \ or a munchy reconstituted fish slice would not be remotely helpful, nor, I surmised,\
    \ would steeping the tines of the fork in a jug of goat's milk. Nevertheless,\
    \ I opened my cutlery drawer and took out one of my treasured Margrave of Hohenhollernbadgasgothengraff\
    \ forks, from the dinner set presented to me all those years ago, around the time\
    \ of Harold Wilson's shock resignation, by the Margrave's very own great-great-great-granddaughter.\
    \ Her name, I recall, was Googie, the only Googie I have ever come across save\
    \ for the esteemed star of stage and screen Googie Withers (born 1917). It is\
    \ as fine a set of cutlery as human ingenuity has ever fashioned, and I felt that\
    \ the intrinsic quality of the fork could outweigh the absence of pickled onion\
    \ residue when it came time to poke it into one hobgoblin after another. That,\
    \ of course, was the task now before me, and I had no idea it would prove impossible.\
    \ If you have ever tried to poke a hobgoblin with a fork, you will know why.\n\
    Later, as I sat hopeless and forlorn in my armchair dangling a bent Margrave of\
    \ Hohenhollernbadgasgothengraff fork from my quivering hand, still beset by hobgoblins\
    \ seemingly more energetic than before, I reflected upon the manifold miseries\
    \ of existence in this vale of tears. I have only just recovered enough of my\
    \ wits to write about those terrible days. This morning, for reasons I cannot\
    \ explain, each and every hobgoblin suddenly ceased besetting me and scuttled\
    \ back behind the wainscot. Perhaps they had run out of cash and had to go to\
    \ their infernal Latin cashpoint machine to replenish their hobgobliny wallets.\
    \ But that would hardly take all day, and they show no sign of reappearing. I\
    \ know, though, that they are lurking there, silent and still, biding their time,\
    \ as hobgoblins do."
