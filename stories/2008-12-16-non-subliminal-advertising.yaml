  text: Apparently, if you use Lulu's super-duper extra fast express uberexpensive
    delivery option, it is Not Too Late to receive copies of Hooting Yard books in
    time for Christmas. (While we are on the subject, I would like to point out that
    I insist on calling Christmas Christmas rather than one of those wretched multi-or-no-faith
    euphemisms which are, as we know, abominations not to be tolerated.) So to avoid
    being faced with sulky disappointed relatives and friends on Christmas Day, go
    here and order your copies right this minute.
