  text: "Last Sunday, 14th December, came and went without my realising that it marked\
    \ the fifth birthday of the Hooting Yard website. Belatedly crack open those bottles\
    \ of aerated lettucewater! (There was, of course, an earlier Hooting Yard site\
    \ on the interweb, but it was static, in that it contained various stories and\
    \ pictures and was very, very rarely updated.) We have come a long way, readers,\
    \ you and I, and I thank you for your support. Here, for the hell of it, is the\
    \ very first item posted. The Search Engine Lure referred to is buried somewhere\
    \ in the Archive.\nVigilant readers of the Hooting Yard Search Engine Lure will\
    \ note within it the splendid word \u201Cbewolfenbuttlement\u201D. Like \u201C\
    solipsism\u201D, this is a coinage by Horace Walpole, but sadly one which never\
    \ caught on. When the future George III was a teenager, his grandfather tried\
    \ to marry him off to a European princess, much to the dismay of George's mother.\
    \ The name of the princess was Sophia Caroline Maria, daughter of the Duchess\
    \ of Brunswick-Wolfenb\xC3\xBCttel. Under his mother's influence, George became\
    \ fretful and aghast at the proposal, and\u2014as Walpole wrote\u2014he \u201C\
    declares violently against being bewolfenbuttled\u201D. To resurrect the word\
    \ successfully, perhaps it is necessary to widen it from the sense of being forced\
    \ into an arranged marriage to being forced into anything one doesn't want to\
    \ do. Start using it today!"
