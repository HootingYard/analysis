  text: 'Cast your mind back to the sixteenth of January. That was the day I posted
    an item, under the heading Mrs Snooke''s Tortoise, about Sylvia Townsend Warner''s
    1946 book The Portrait Of A Tortoise, where she extracted from the Journals of
    the 18th century clergyman Gilbert White all the entries regarding his tortoise,
    Timothy. I suggested at the time that a reading of this would make a splendid
    special edition of Hooting Yard On The Air, and lo! it has come to pass. I recorded
    it this morning, and it will be broadcast on ResonanceFM over the Christmas/New
    Year fortnight. I am not yet sure of the date, but keep an eye on the schedule
    and be sure not to miss it.

    UPDATE : The programme will be broadcast at 12.20 PM on Boxing Day, December 26th.'
