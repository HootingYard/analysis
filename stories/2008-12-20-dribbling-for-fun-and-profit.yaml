  text: 'You would be surprised how much fun you could have, and how much money you
    could make, by dribbling. Like most of us, you were probably encouraged not to
    dribble when you were a youngster. Your ma or pa probably said to you something
    along the lines of "God in heaven, child, you won''t get very far in life if all
    you do is stand around dribbling all day!" The thing is, they were right, which
    is why you would be astonished if you had fun, or made a profit, simply by dribbling.

    However, should you wish to pursue this activity as a career option, here are
    some tips.

    Of course, an element of luck is essential in all such career trajectories, but
    sooner or later one of your passers-by may well be a top-flight television executive,
    from either the BBC or one of the independent networks, and they will surely sign
    you up for your very own primetime show, where you will be able to dispense with
    the cap and the bells and the capering and the shoebox, and just face the camera
    and dribble, dribble, dribble.'
