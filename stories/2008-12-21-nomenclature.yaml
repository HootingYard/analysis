  text: 'Laban Tall at UK Commentators:

    "There''s a small Cultural Studies paper waiting to be written on names--how the
    Amalgamated Union of Wire-Drawers, Fettlers and Allied Trades turns in thirty
    years into something called ''Together'' or ''Unity'', British Insulated Cable
    and Radio Limited into ''Xantippe'' or ''Xenith'', and the Royal Signals and Radar
    Establishment via ''Defence Research Agency'' into ''QinetiQ''. The key being
    that the old, wordy, literate names actually described what the organisation did,
    the new ones conceal it and are post-literate, logos in letter form."

    And let us not forget the harebrained attempt by the Royal Mail to "rebrand" itself
    as Consignia.'
