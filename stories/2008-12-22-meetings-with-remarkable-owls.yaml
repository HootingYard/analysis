  text: "Dobson's pamphlet Meetings With Remarkable Owls (out of print) is a curious\
    \ work. Ostensibly, it is a simple account of a walk he took through the owl sanctuary\
    \ at Scroonhoonpooge, and of the owls he came across there. Given the unfathomable\
    \ depth of his ornithological ignorance, one is tempted to suggest that the pamphleteer\
    \ only knew the birds he \u201Cmet\u201D were owls because of the big neon signage\
    \ at the gate of the sanctuary.\nMore remarkable than the owls themselves, surely,\
    \ is the fact that Dobson was able to get anywhere near them in the first place.\
    \ Ever since the so-called Inexplicably Spooky Events that centred on Scroonhoonpooge\
    \ Farmyard, the entire area had been cordoned off by a massive security fence\
    \ patrolled by wolves and wild hogs. There had always been talk of the eerie barn\
    \ and the mutant albino hens and the disturbing well, to say nothing of the farmyard\
    \ itself, but after what happened on that wild and windy October weekend, so great\
    \ was the terror in the surrounding villages that the fence was erected overnight,\
    \ and the wolves and wild hogs let loose around the perimeter.\nDobson says nothing\
    \ of this. We are asked to believe that he was out and about pounding the countryside\
    \ one day when he found himself at the gate of the owl sanctuary and decided to\
    \ investigate. This cannot be right. To get to the gate, he would first have had\
    \ to find a way through the security fence without being savaged by wolves or\
    \ wild hogs, then have had to cross the perilous bogs, avoid the piano wire strung\
    \ across the pathways, clamber up the impossibly steep sludge banks, find his\
    \ way through the mist-enshrouded field riddled with concealed pits in which killer\
    \ spiders lay in wait, and pass through the notorious spinney of poisonous trees.\
    \ Even had he accomplished all that, he would somehow have had to persuade the\
    \ sentries at the owl sanctuary gate that he was a bona fide visitor, or they\
    \ would have shot him on the spot and buried his corpse where it would never,\
    \ ever be found. The sentries were hand-picked, undergoing rigorous psychological\
    \ testing to flush out any who had a less than fanatical protective instinct towards\
    \ owls.\nDobson was not a particularly boastful man, but he did have an operatic\
    \ diva's sense of drama, and it seems scarcely credible that he would let pass\
    \ the opportunity to prattle on about so death-defying a journey. So we must be\
    \ grateful for the research done by indefatigable Dobsonist Ted Cack, whose recently\
    \ published paper suggests that some weird properties in the atmosphere around\
    \ Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard may have actually modified Dobson's brain, one such\
    \ modification being a complete wiping clean of his memory between eating a choc\
    \ ice at the ramshackle kiosk adjacent to Sawdust Bridge and arrival at the gate\
    \ of the owl sanctuary three days later.\nSome traditionalists have had harsh\
    \ words to say about Ted Cack. After all, he made his name as a young firebrand\
    \ with a deliberately provocative book arguing that Dobson was not the true author\
    \ of the Bilgewater Elegies and that the pamphleteer had never set foot in Winnipeg,\
    \ let alone worked there as a janitor in an evaporated milk factory. These were,\
    \ and are, preposterous theories, and Cack did himself no favours with his shoddy\
    \ scholarship, cavalier approach to source material, and pomposity. Yet with his\
    \ Anthony Burgess hairstyle, hornrim glasses, and barking voice he was a natural\
    \ for television chatshows, and even the crustiest Dobsonists still speak in awe\
    \ of his legendary appearance on Russell Harty Plus. TV critic Loopy Sebag wrote\
    \ at the time that \u201CTed Cack, with his Anthony Burgess hairstyle, hornrim\
    \ glasses, and barking voice, is the best thing I have ever seen on television,\
    \ apart from It's A Knockout\u201D.\nIn his attempt to unravel what happened to\
    \ Dobson on the day of his visit to the owl sanctuary, Ted Cack put himself in\
    \ the pamphleteer's sturdy Hungarian Flying Officer's boots, and recreated the\
    \ journey. Of course, Scroonhoonpooge is much changed. The whole area around the\
    \ farmyard has been flattened, and there is no longer any sign of the eerie barn\
    \ or the disturbing well or the albino hens or indeed of the owl sanctuary. In\
    \ their place stands a derelict and abandoned shopping precinct in which feral\
    \ beasts and teenagers cavort and carouse. Only a branch of the plumbing chain\
    \ Spigots R Us remains open, and its stock is covered in dust and breadcrumbs.\
    \ Characteristically, Ted Cack was undeterred. He had read a lot of books about\
    \ psychogeography, and though he did not really understand what he read, he was\
    \ determined to pretend to be the pamphleteer in that place at that time on that\
    \ day so many years ago, so much so that he prepared by eating a breakfast of\
    \ bloaters and wearing a grubby pair of trousers. And, just as the painter Oskar\
    \ Kokoschka had a life-size rag doll made to replace his lost love Alma Mahler,\
    \ Ted Cack created a simulacrum of Marigold Chew using string and wool and scrunched-up\
    \ dishcloths, and waved it goodbye as he crashed out of the door on his way to\
    \ Sawdust Bridge.\nThe crucial paragraph in his research paper is this:\nThere\
    \ I stood, he wrote, in a puddle outside a boarded-up milk bar where once had\
    \ stood the gate of the Scroonhoonpooge Owl Sanctuary. I had absolutely no idea\
    \ how I got here. It was as if my brain had been modified in some sinister way\
    \ and my memory wiped clean. This leads me to the irrefutable conclusion that\
    \ exactly the same thing happened to Dobson, and that is why he never wrote about\
    \ his perilous journey in his pamphlet Meetings With Remarkable Owls (out of print).\
    \ What I do not yet know is how permanent this brain modification will prove to\
    \ be. God help me.\nI cannot see any holes in this argument whatsoever, so I am\
    \ prepared to state that Ted Cack, pompous and irritating as he may be, has solved\
    \ one of the enduring mysteries of the pamphleteer's career.\nAs for the pamphlet\
    \ itself, as I said, it is a curious work. Trudging through the owl sanctuary,\
    \ Dobson from time to time comes across an owl perched upon the branch of a tree.\
    \ He attempts, first, to describe it, and this is where his lack of ornithological\
    \ knowledge lets him down. Each description consists almost entirely of the words\
    \ head, beak, wings, big round eyes, talons, and hooting sound in various combinations.\
    \ But it is the second part of each \u201Cmeeting\u201D to which we turn, wherein\
    \ Dobson tries to, as he puts it, \u201Ccommune with the owls\u201D. He hoots\
    \ at them. He flaps his arms as if they are wings. He pounces upon a squirrel\
    \ or a fieldmouse and savages it and swallows it. He hoots again.\nI am Dobson,\
    \ he writes, and for today at least, I am become an owl.\nIt is, I think, not\
    \ the owls which are remarkable in this instance, but Dobson himself."
