  text: 'The latest victim of crunchy credit conditions is Pebblehead''s Christmas
    Annual, due to be published tomorrow but now indefinitely postponed. The bestselling
    paperbackist has been issuing his annuals every Christmas Eve for as long as anybody
    can remember, so this is what is known, in the language of his potboilers, as
    a bitter blow. Indeed, one of the features of this year''s annual was to be an
    exciting tale of polar tragedy called "Captain Jarvis And His Starving Huskies
    Are Pressed Flat Against A Glacier By The Bitter Blows Of An Antarctic Blizzard".
    I am sorry I am not going to be able to read that to my grandchildren as a bedtime
    story, nor indeed to act it out in the community hub frolicking compound, if necessary
    using bags of flour as a snow substitute should the weather continue balmy.

    As ever, the annual was to contain dozens of stories Pebblehead dashed off this
    past year in between writing his tremendous novels. According to the publisher''s
    blurb, we were promised such gems as "Vanessa Redgrave And The Revolutionary Space
    Cadets", "The Six Million Dollar Goat", and "Ooh La La, As He Sinks Beneath The
    Waves, Captain Jarvis Recalls What Bliss Was It In That Dawn To Have A Mild Headache".
    It is something of a mystery why Pebblehead has yet to write an entire novel about
    this Captain Jarvis character, who gets into all sorts of exciting scrapes in
    all sorts of locations, exotic and otherwise. Last year''s story, "Captain Jarvis
    Topples Out Of A Hot Air Balloon Piloted By Richard Branson" was particularly
    thrilling.

    We could also have expected many pictures of bees, ducks, gaping chasms, weasels,
    kitchen utensils, frogpersons, eggs, Ludwig Wittgenstein, cardboard boxes, giraffe
    heads, and tweezers. Pebblehead has been criticised for retaining the same picture
    categories year after year, every single annual containing three cack-handed pencil
    drawings of each subject, all crammed into the endpapers, but I think this says
    a good deal about the man. He is reliable, he is consistent, he is a bestselling
    paperbackist, and he can''t draw for toffee.

    This year''s factual articles were to include a potted history of potted fishpastes,
    an analysis of sulphurous woozy barbershop quartet demons, an annotated diagram
    of Christ''s wounds, and a reprint of Pebblehead''s classic pig paragraph.

    Add to that the quiz and the cut-out board game and the coating of scum upon the
    dust jacket, and it is clear we shall all be bereft at this time of otherwise
    unbridled jollity.'
