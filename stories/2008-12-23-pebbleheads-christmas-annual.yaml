  text: "The latest victim of crunchy credit conditions is Pebblehead's Christmas\
    \ Annual, due to be published tomorrow but now indefinitely postponed. The bestselling\
    \ paperbackist has been issuing his annuals every Christmas Eve for as long as\
    \ anybody can remember, so this is what is known, in the language of his potboilers,\
    \ as a bitter blow. Indeed, one of the features of this year's annual was to be\
    \ an exciting tale of polar tragedy called \u201CCaptain Jarvis And His Starving\
    \ Huskies Are Pressed Flat Against A Glacier By The Bitter Blows Of An Antarctic\
    \ Blizzard\u201D. I am sorry I am not going to be able to read that to my grandchildren\
    \ as a bedtime story, nor indeed to act it out in the community hub frolicking\
    \ compound, if necessary using bags of flour as a snow substitute should the weather\
    \ continue balmy.\nAs ever, the annual was to contain dozens of stories Pebblehead\
    \ dashed off this past year in between writing his tremendous novels. According\
    \ to the publisher's blurb, we were promised such gems as \u201CVanessa Redgrave\
    \ And The Revolutionary Space Cadets\u201D, \u201CThe Six Million Dollar Goat\u201D\
    , and \u201COoh La La, As He Sinks Beneath The Waves, Captain Jarvis Recalls What\
    \ Bliss Was It In That Dawn To Have A Mild Headache\u201D. It is something of\
    \ a mystery why Pebblehead has yet to write an entire novel about this Captain\
    \ Jarvis character, who gets into all sorts of exciting scrapes in all sorts of\
    \ locations, exotic and otherwise. Last year's story, \u201CCaptain Jarvis Topples\
    \ Out Of A Hot Air Balloon Piloted By Richard Branson\u201D was particularly thrilling.\n\
    We could also have expected many pictures of bees, ducks, gaping chasms, weasels,\
    \ kitchen utensils, frogpersons, eggs, Ludwig Wittgenstein, cardboard boxes, giraffe\
    \ heads, and tweezers. Pebblehead has been criticised for retaining the same picture\
    \ categories year after year, every single annual containing three cack-handed\
    \ pencil drawings of each subject, all crammed into the endpapers, but I think\
    \ this says a good deal about the man. He is reliable, he is consistent, he is\
    \ a bestselling paperbackist, and he can't draw for toffee.\nThis year's factual\
    \ articles were to include a potted history of potted fishpastes, an analysis\
    \ of sulphurous woozy barbershop quartet demons, an annotated diagram of Christ's\
    \ wounds, and a reprint of Pebblehead's classic pig paragraph.\nAdd to that the\
    \ quiz and the cut-out board game and the coating of scum upon the dust jacket,\
    \ and it is clear we shall all be bereft at this time of otherwise unbridled jollity."
