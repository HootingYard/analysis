  text: 'I am indebted to the great Max Decharne for drawing to my attention this
    little-known (to me, unknown) work by H G Wells. The title is foolish enough,
    but I am particularly fond of that resounding subtitle: Adventures, Poses, Stresses,
    Conflict, and Disaster in a Contemporary Brain. Somehow I think that deserves
    an exclamation mark. If any Hooting Yardistas have read it, perhaps they could
    post a review in the Comments.
