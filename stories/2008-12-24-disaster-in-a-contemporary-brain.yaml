  text: "I am indebted to the great Max D\xE9charn\xE9 for drawing to my attention\
    \ this little-known (to me, unknown) work by H G Wells. The title is foolish enough,\
    \ but I am particularly fond of that resounding subtitle: Adventures, Poses, Stresses,\
    \ Conflict, and Disaster in a Contemporary Brain. Somehow I think that deserves\
    \ an exclamation mark. If any Hooting Yardistas have read it, perhaps they could\
    \ post a review in the Comments.\n"
