  text: "Back in November, you will recall, we had a brief look at George Orwell's\
    \ diary and its\u2014at times\u2014exclusive concentration on egg-counting. I\
    \ have not seen fit to keep you abreast of the daily totals, confident as I am\
    \ that you are equally fascinated by this egg business, and thus have added a\
    \ check of the online diary to your daily routine. However, the latest seventy-year-old\
    \ entry is somewhat alarming, so I thought I should draw your attention to it.\n\
    26\u201328.12.38 Have been ill. Not certain about number of eggs, but about 9.\n\
    Not certain? Get a grip, George, get a grip!"
