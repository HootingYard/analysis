  text: 'Back in November, you will recall, we had a brief look at George Orwell''s
    diary and its--at times--exclusive concentration on egg-counting. I have not seen
    fit to keep you abreast of the daily totals, confident as I am that you are equally
    fascinated by this egg business, and thus have added a check of the online diary
    to your daily routine. However, the latest seventy-year-old entry is somewhat
    alarming, so I thought I should draw your attention to it.
