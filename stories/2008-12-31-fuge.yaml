  text: 'Michael Gilleland at Laudator Temporis Acti has a marvellous post on words
    ending in -fuge. He notes Thomas Hardy''s coinage of dolorifuge in Tess Of The
    D''Urbervilles -

    "The children ... had made use of this idea as a species of dolorifuge after the
    death of the horse."

    - and cites a contemporary reviewer of Hardy complaining about his "outlandish
    words" -

    "Think how absolutely out of colour in Arcadia are such words as ''dolorifuge'',
    ''photosphere'', ''heliolatries'', ''arborescence'', ''concatenation'', ''noctambulist''--where,
    indeed, are such in colour?--and Mr. Hardy further uses that horrid verb ''ecstatisize''."

    There are many more -fuge words to chew over, and I may well make use of some
    of them in the coming year.'
