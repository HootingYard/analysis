  text: 'In homage to George Orwell''s egg counting mania, I decided it would be an
    excellent idea to begin the new year by launching--to much fanfare, of course--Frank
    Key''s Squirrel Count(tm). I can think of nothing that would excite readers quite
    as much as learning how many squirrels I have seen each day. So, to the sound
    of tooting horns and shrill whistle-blasts, with flags and banners flying, and
    perhaps some clowns cavorting upon a specially-built platform, here is the very
    first bulletin from Frank Key''s Squirrel Count(tm) 2009.

    01.01.09 Six squirrels, or possibly three squirrels each seen twice.
