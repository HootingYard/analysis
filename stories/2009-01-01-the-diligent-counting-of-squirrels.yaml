  text: "In homage to George Orwell's egg counting mania, I decided it would be an\
    \ excellent idea to begin the new year by launching\u2014to much fanfare, of course\u2014\
    Frank Key's Squirrel Count\u2122. I can think of nothing that would excite readers\
    \ quite as much as learning how many squirrels I have seen each day. So, to the\
    \ sound of tooting horns and shrill whistle-blasts, with flags and banners flying,\
    \ and perhaps some clowns cavorting upon a specially-built platform, here is the\
    \ very first bulletin from Frank Key's Squirrel Count\u2122 2009.\n01.01.09 Six\
    \ squirrels, or possibly three squirrels each seen twice.\n"
