  text: 'Bluestocking polymath Dot Tint has a new book out next month, a magisterial
    study of aquatic birds entitled Dot''s Ducks. There are two very curious things
    about this hefty hardback, and I think it right that you are made aware of them
    before shelling out your cash for a copy.

    It is the first of Dot Tint''s innumerable books not to feature on its dust jacket
    a mezzotint by her brother Rex Tint, the noted mezzotintist. Indeed, a considerable
    number of her earlier titles have been absolutely riddled with mezzotints, often
    quite gratuitously, so much so that there are cynics who claim Dot is keeping
    Rex gainfully employed, whereas without her patronage he would be starving in
    some sort of mezzotintist''s garret, surviving on stale croissant crusts and tap
    water. This is piffle, of course, for Rex Tint is never short of commissions,
    and has been known to turn work down, for example when he was asked a couple of
    years ago to create a gigantic mezzotint to be displayed on the wall of a house
    owned by the Belgian actor and martial arts expert Jean-Claude Camille Francois
    Van Varenberg, better known as Jean-Claude Van Damme. It is not known whether
    the star chose his professional name to echo Philip Vandamm, the villain played
    by James Mason in North By Northwest, but we do know that Rex Tint snubbed him
    despite being offered a very large amount of Belgian money. Whether Dot pays Rex
    at all for the mezzotints he has until now provided for her books is unclear,
    making the charge that he is a kept mezzotintist all the more laughable. The absence
    of his work from Dot''s Ducks has led to speculation that there may have been
    a falling out between the siblings. Rex is notoriously temperamental, and has
    recently grown a preposterous beard, thus obscuring the distinctive Tint family
    cast of his features, so that might be something to do with it. I suppose if he
    shaves his beard off and is subsequently invited by his sister to provide mezzotints
    for her next book we will have a better understanding of the matter. Time will
    tell.

    The second curious thing about Dot''s Ducks is the inclusion of a vast amount
    of material about owls. Owls are not ducks, and Dot Tint cannot seriously believe
    that they are. Yet there are pages upon pages of owl-related material, offered
    without any qualification or explanation. I have read my advance copy of the book
    twice, all the way through, and sure enough, we go from mallard to merganser to
    teal to owl to shelduck to pochard to bufflehead, as if, in Dot Tint''s world,
    owls are ducks. It is all very strange. Or at least, it was, until quite by chance
    the other day I came upon what may be an answer to the riddle. I was browsing
    through a back number of the magazine Traumatic Childhood Incidents Of Bluestocking
    Polymaths, and lo and behold, there was a lengthy piece of anecdotage about Dot
    Tint. Apparently, when she was five or six years old, on a family holiday at a
    gruesome seaside resort, she was gambolling and frolicking upon the beach when,
    panting with infant glee, she stopped to catch her breath and looked out to sea,
    where she saw a rowing boat. Her eyesight was piercing back then, and she could
    clearly make out that there were two people in the rowing boat. One was rowing,
    in a fairly lacklustre way, while the other person was holding a sack. All of
    a sudden, as Dot Tint watched, this person took an owl out of the sack and held
    it under the water until it drowned, whereupon the dead owl was put back in the
    sack and the rower rowed the rowing boat away with greater urgency. It does not
    take a mind doctor to conclude that the traumatised child thereafter held fast
    to the delusion that owls were ducks, the water their habitat, and that she had
    not seen an owl cruelly drowned but merely one taking a dip in the sea. If anything,
    this forgotten magazine article makes Dot''s Ducks an even more compelling book
    than it otherwise would be, despite the absence of mezzotints by the mezzotintist
    Rex Tint. I''d buy it if I were you.'
