  text: "I read in the paper today that the governors of a new primary school in Sheffield\
    \ have decided the word \u201Cschool\u201D has \u201Cnegative connotations\u201D\
    \ and it will thus be known as a \u201Cplace for learning\u201D. No doubt staff\
    \ and pupils (or whatever euphemisms they use for them) will find their way around\
    \ the place by following the \u201Cdirectional pointing devices\u201D so favoured\
    \ by John Birt when he was in charge of the BBC. I am disappointed, of course,\
    \ that they neglected to use the correct phrase for \u201Cschool\u201D, which\
    \ as we know is \u201Ccommunity education hub\u201D.\nHorace Walpole wrote that\
    \ \u201CSheffield is one of the foulest towns in England\u201D, though he did\
    \ buy a pair of \u201Cquite pretty\u201D candlesticks while he was there."
