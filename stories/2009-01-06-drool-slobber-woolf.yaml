  text: 'A letter plops on to the mat from keen Hooting Yardist Roland Clare:

    Dear Frank, he writes, In view of Hooting Yard''s present, thoroughly understandable,
    preoccupation with slobbering, now may be the right time to recall a pleasingly
    Keyesque passage in Virginia Woolf''s Orlando:

    "... the doctors were hardly wiser then than they are now, and after prescribing
    rest and exercise, starvation and nourishment, society and solitude, that he should
    lie in bed all day and ride forty miles between lunch and dinner, together with
    the usual sedatives and irritants, diversified, as the fancy took them, with possets
    of newt''s slobber on rising, and draughts of peacock''s gall on going to bed,
    they left him to himself ..." (p48 of the 2000 Penguin Modern Classics edition).

    Many thanks to Mr Clare for that. Inexplicably, it may be the first appearance
    of the word posset on this website. I suspect it will not be the last.'
