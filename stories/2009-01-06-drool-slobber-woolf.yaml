  text: "A letter plops on to the mat from keen Hooting Yardist Roland Clare:\nDear\
    \ Frank, he writes, In view of Hooting Yard's present, thoroughly understandable,\
    \ preoccupation with slobbering, now may be the right time to recall a pleasingly\
    \ Keyesque passage in Virginia Woolf's Orlando:\n\u201C\u2026 the doctors were\
    \ hardly wiser then than they are now, and after prescribing rest and exercise,\
    \ starvation and nourishment, society and solitude, that he should lie in bed\
    \ all day and ride forty miles between lunch and dinner, together with the usual\
    \ sedatives and irritants, diversified, as the fancy took them, with possets of\
    \ newt's slobber on rising, and draughts of peacock's gall on going to bed, they\
    \ left him to himself \u2026\u201D (p48 of the 2000 Penguin Modern Classics edition).\n\
    Many thanks to Mr Clare for that. Inexplicably, it may be the first appearance\
    \ of the word posset on this website. I suspect it will not be the last."
