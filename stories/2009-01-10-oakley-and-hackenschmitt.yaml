  text: 'Five years ago today, when the Hooting Yard website was in its infancy, I
    posted this quotation from The Daily Telegraph Book Of Obituaries. It still makes
    me laugh.

    Sir Atholl Oakley (1900-1987) was a champion wrestler, an impresario of giants,
    organiser of "rugged holiday cruises" and an authority on Lorna Doone. His wrestling
    career began after he was beaten up by a gang of thugs. He built up his physique
    by drinking eleven pints of milk every day, a regimen designed by the giant wrestler
    Hackenschmitt, who later told Oakley that the quantity of milk prescribed was
    "a misprint".'
