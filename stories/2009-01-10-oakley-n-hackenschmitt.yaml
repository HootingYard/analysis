  text: "Five years ago today, when the Hooting Yard website was in its infancy, I\
    \ posted this quotation from The Daily Telegraph Book Of Obituaries. It still\
    \ makes me laugh.\nSir Atholl Oakley (1900\u20131987) was a champion wrestler,\
    \ an impresario of giants, organiser of \u201Crugged holiday cruises\u201D and\
    \ an authority on Lorna Doone. His wrestling career began after he was beaten\
    \ up by a gang of thugs. He built up his physique by drinking eleven pints of\
    \ milk every day, a regimen designed by the giant wrestler Hackenschmitt, who\
    \ later told Oakley that the quantity of milk prescribed was \u201Ca misprint\u201D\
