  text: "It can be the devil of a job to keep a pigtape sated. The standard pigtape\
    \ has three basic behaviours: grunting interminably until it is fed, eating the\
    \ food it is given, and, mercifully, taking post-prandial naps. One learns to\
    \ treasure those naps, for they are the only respite one gets from the pigtape.\
    \ Even then, it tends to grunt and snuffle and wheeze in its sleep, so it still\
    \ makes a noise, though not as horrible a noise as its incessant grunting for\
    \ food when awake or the absolutely disgusting chomping and slobbering noises\
    \ it makes when it is eating. It is fortunate that the pigtape is such a tiny\
    \ being, and the volume of its noises commensurate with its size, otherwise one\
    \ would be deafened by it, and not merely deafened but driven from polite society,\
    \ banished to a wilderness. Most pigtapes are audible only to their hosts, which\
    \ is a bad enough state of affairs.\nThe correct term is \u201Clittle pigtape\u201D\
    \ and it is similar to a tapeworm, except that the pigtape dwells within the soul.\
    \ This does not mean that the pigtape grunts for spiritual sustenance, such as\
    \ the reading of books by Deepak Chopra. The food for which it grunts is all too\
    \ solid\u2014cream crackers and cockles and mussels and lemon meringue pie and\
    \ bloaters and choc ices and cous cous and pastry and vinegar and a spit-roasted\
    \ half of an ox and aubergines and dumplings and suet pudding, to name but a baker's\
    \ dozen of its cravings. Before at last it is replete and takes a noisy nap, the\
    \ little pigtape somehow sucks all the food out of your stomach through internal\
    \ piping to its cranny in your soul.\nBecause it is so tiny, and dwells within\
    \ so inaccessible a spot, ridding oneself of a pigtape is well nigh impossible.\
    \ Maybe not even well nigh, but just impossible, full stop. Certainly there are\
    \ no recorded cases in the literature of anything resembling a little pigtape\
    \ being extracted from a body, either during a surgical procedure upon the living\
    \ or an autopsy upon the dead. Nor is it at all clear how one acquires a pigtape\
    \ in the first place. We all have our sacred souls, but not all souls provide\
    \ a home to these minuscule grunting greedy monsters. It is not true, despite\
    \ what you may have had drummed into you by priests or parents, that the presence\
    \ or absence of a pigtape is dependent in some way upon one's moral unbesmudgement.\
    \ Of course, it is advisable not to eat too much contaminated pork, but for a\
    \ host of other reasons, such as indigestion or death."
