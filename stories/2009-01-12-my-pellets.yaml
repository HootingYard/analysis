  text: 'You asked me to tell you about my pellets, so here goes. Some of the pellets
    were regurgitated by cats, some were gobbed up by owls, and some are made of metal,
    to be fired from a shotgun. All my pellets fall into one of those three categories,
    I think. If I think some more, which I am not going to do, it might occur to me
    that some of my pellets have a provenance other than those three, but I can always
    issue a corrective at a later date, after I have thought some more. Even if I
    recall some other type of pellet, it remains the case that the vast majority of
    my pellets are either those vomited up by cats or owls or those made of metal
    meant to be shot at something, such as a crow or a scarecrow or an irritating
    person.

    Yes, I have been known to fire metal pellets from a shotgun at persons who irritate
    me. I am sure that is lamentable, even criminal, behaviour, but we all have our
    breaking points, and if you start to moralise with me and suggest that I flip
    my lid a little too readily, I might well agree with you. But you and I have not
    sat on the same buses nor traipsed the same retail facility aisles, so you would
    be better off holding your tongue.

    Of more interest than my metal pellets are my cat and owl pellets, which are of
    course organic, and often contain the barely recognisable remains of small mammals
    such as mice and fieldmice, or of the tinier birds. Some of these pellets have
    been dropped in my doorway, as gifts, and some I have collected, on trawling expeditions
    in the forest. It is an extensive forest and home to many owls. They perch on
    the branches of trees and hoot as night falls, and in the darkness they swoop
    upon mice and fieldmice, and in the morning they gob up pellets, and there is
    me, with my sack, wandering the forest at dawn, on the lookout. I wear a charm
    bracelet when I wander in the forest, to keep me safe from kelpies.

    It is unfortunate that my charm bracelet does not protect me from irritating persons.
    I did try to modify it, by adding hawked-up pellets from a bird of prey, from
    a hawk in fact, but still I was beset, on buses and in retail facilities, by the
    rude and the gormless. Thus it was that I added to my collection of metal pellets,
    for the firing of them, from a shotgun, as necessity demanded.

    Watching a cat hawk up a pellet from its innards is an educative experience. There
    often appears to be much undigested grass from lawns impacted in the pellet, and
    yet I can never recall seeing a cat feeding upon grass, much as if it were a cow,
    which we are used to seeing eat grass. At least, I am used to such a sight, for
    I often watch cows, it is my hobby. If I have been put somewhere where cows are
    scarce or non-existent, I will travel to find them, so I can watch them, of an
    afternoon, or of a morning, or even all bloody day if I am in a cow-watching mood.
    Cows becalm the soul. And yet as far as I know they do not regurgitate pellets,
    as cats and owls do.

    I do not watch owls, I simply trace their presence in the forest, armed with my
    sack, and collect the pellets they have gobbed up. I do not think it would becalm
    me to watch owls, while wearing night-vision goggles, in the depths of the forest.
    I would always be on my guard against kelpies, even when wearing my charm bracelet.
    My heart would be hammering.

    Irritating persons are, of course, the opposite of becalming, and impervious to
    the magick of my charm bracelet. That is why they have to be dealt with by metal
    pellets from a shotgun. Peppered with pellets, they run away screeching. Before
    I wore my charm bracelet, I used to run away screeching from kelpies. I would
    hoist my sack upon my back and go wandering into the forest, at night, to collect
    pellets hawked up by owls, and very often I would be pursued or set upon or threatened
    or menaced by kelpies, and, with an empty sack, run screeching until I was safely
    back in whatever hut I had been put, by the authorities. My cat and metal pellets
    outnumbered my owl pellets to a great degree, there was a terrible imbalance,
    and it was my recognition of this that led me to make the charm bracelet. I followed
    instructions from a pamphlet written by a man whose life had been blighted by
    kelpies but who had been able to deter them by wearing a bracelet of beads and
    baubles and pellets and bones and teeth and feathers and sugarcubes. It was, for
    me, always an awful temptation to suck upon and crunch the sugarcubes on my charm
    bracelet, for I have a very sweet tooth, but I enrolled in a twelve-step programme
    run by Sugarcube Suckers And Crunchers Anonymous and that sorted out my head.

    You have to sort out your head, sooner or later, wherever the authorities have
    put you, be it a hut or a shed or an outbuilding. I found that developing an interest
    in my pellet collection was the thing that rescued me from a hopeless, pelletless
    existence. See them, my pellets, all aligned and catalogued, in my cabinets, the
    cat and the owl and the metal, and not a kelpie within a hundred yards of my hut.
    I am a happy man.'
