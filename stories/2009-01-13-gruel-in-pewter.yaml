  text: "According to the Press Association, Scientists will serve gruel to the public\
    \ today after recreating the porridge made famous by Oliver Twist. Members of\
    \ the Royal Society of Chemistry produced the recipe, consisting of water, oats\
    \ and milk, after consulting historic sources as well as Charles Dickens\u2019\
    \ novel. The Victorian workhouse staple, which will be prepared by French chef\
    \ Fabian in the society's kitchen, will be ladled into pewter dishes and served\
    \ to passersby at 11am by the society's own \u201CBeadle\u201D at the entrance\
    \ of its London home at Burlington House, Piccadilly. An RSC spokesman said: \u201C\
    Diners asking for more will be rejected.\u201D\nSadly, I read this too late to\
    \ be able to get to Piccadilly in time for my free pewter pot of gruel. I could\
    \ console myself, however, that it would not have been a new experience for me.\
    \ I think I have mentioned elsewhere that I spent a period, earlier in my life,\
    \ subsisting on a diet of gruel. This was not for reasons of ill-health or a traumatised\
    \ digestive system or even abject poverty. My flatmate at the time and I undertook\
    \ the gruel-only diet as an experiment in asceticism, puritanical fanaticism,\
    \ and self-righteousness. Indeed, as I read the Press Association report it struck\
    \ me that the RSC recipe seems rather luxurious, adding a slop of milk to the\
    \ oats and water. No such treats for us!\nMy grueldom took place many years ago,\
    \ early in the Thatcher administration, but the lessons I learned then, and the\
    \ stiffening of my moral fibre, have remained with me. In fact, whenever the opportunity\
    \ arises, I like to announce that \u201CI lived on a diet of gruel, you know,\u201D\
    \ to whomsoever is listening. Curiously enough, this is almost invariably met\
    \ by laughter and ridicule."
