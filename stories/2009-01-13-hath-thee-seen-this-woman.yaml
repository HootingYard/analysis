  text: 'The Independent reports on some very sensible new rules issued by the Vatican
    to deal with people who have visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or BVM.

    Anyone who claims to have seen an apparition [of the Virgin Mary] will only be
    believed as long as they remain silent and do not court publicity over their claims.
    If they refuse to obey, this will be taken as a sign that their claims are false.

    The visionaries will then be visited by a team of psychiatrists, either atheists
    or Catholics, to certify their mental health while theologians will assess the
    content of any heavenly messages to see if they contravene Church teachings.

    If the visionary is considered credible they will ultimately be questioned by
    one or more demonologists and exorcists to exclude the possibility that Satan
    is hiding behind the apparitions in order to deceive the faithful.

    I have put my name forward as a volunteer outreach demonologist for the new scheme.
    Peeking behind apparitions to check for the presence or absence of Satan is, after
    all, a long-standing hobby of mine, and I think I have the required skills-set.
    I would also perform my demonology duties in a robust and transparent manner,
    or in a weedy and opaque manner if that is what the Vatican would prefer.
