  text: 'Glory be! ''Tis the fourteenth of January, Saint Mungo''s Day, a landmark
    date in the Hooting Yard calendar, as important in its way as the third, fourth
    and fifth of February (the Muggletonian Great Holiday) and the nineteenth of July
    (the Muggletonian Little Holiday). As far as I am aware, there is absolutely no
    connection between Saint Mungo and Lodowicke Muggleton''s holy crew, save that
    the feast days and holidays of both are conscientiously observed here at Hooting
    Yard, for reasons which I hope are obvious.

    As a special treat for readers to celebrate Saint Mungo''s Day, let me announce
    the new subscription scheme. I know full well that many of you toss and turn at
    night, victims of a vague sense of unrest, kept awake by the nagging thought that
    you are able to read this grand panoply of words online absolutely free. A lot
    of you have generously donated to Mr Key''s almost bare cupboard in the past,
    and I am mindful of the effort it takes to do so. So now I have devised a scheme
    whereby you can make regular donations without lifting a finger, apart of course
    from the initial setting up.

    Look! At the top of the page, in the red rectangle, there is a new tab, second
    from the right, called "Subscriptions". If you click on it you will be taken to
    a page showing you the four options available--the Tiny Enid, the Old Halob, the
    Pebblehead, and the Dobson. Full details are given of the cost of each subscription
    and the use to which your funds will be put. Having plumped for the one that best
    suits you, just click on the accompanying button and follow the simple instructions.
    You will have no more sleepless nights, and can bathe in a warm glow of righteousness
    that your favourite out of print pamphleteer is better placed to keep the wolf
    from his door.

    The wolf, by the way, is named Martin, and I shall have more to say about him
    soon.

    NOTE : At the moment, that ''Subscribe'' button in the sidebar takes you automatically
    to the Old Halob option. It will be fixed, until when use the tab at the top.'
