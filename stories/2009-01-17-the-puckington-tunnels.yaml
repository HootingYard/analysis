  text: "It was a big fort, with delightful crenellations, and many flags, and it\
    \ had the shiniest portcullis outside of Navarre. This was Fort Hoity, sister\
    \ fort of Fort Toity, and an extremely interesting fort in its own right. For\
    \ underneath Fort Hoity ran the Puckington Tunnels, those tunnels you may have\
    \ come across in your reading, if, that is, you have been reading about tunnelling\
    \ systems as a change from your usual diet of chicklit, gitlit, and zadiesmithlit.\n\
    There is a regrettable temptation to neglect the literature of tunnels and to\
    \ be sidetracked by less meaty subject matter, by ephemera and winsomeness and\
    \ the outpourings of knaves. I am not immune to such distractions myself, and\
    \ in truth I ought to have done a lot more tunnely reading than I have, especially\
    \ once I put my mind to writing about the Puckington Tunnels. There are huge chasms\
    \ in my knowledge, and if I faced a quiz on the subject I suspect my score would\
    \ be embarrassing. Perhaps not so bad as that of clueless David Lammy\u2014unbelievably,\
    \ the government minister for Higher Education\u2014whose recent appearance on\
    \ the television show Mastermind elicited such delights as his belief that Henry\
    \ VII succeeded to the throne after Henry VIII, and that the surname of the Nobel\
    \ prizewinning scientists Pierre and Marie was Antoinette. The nitwit was not\
    \ asked any questions about tunnels, but we may safely assume he would have fluffed\
    \ them.\nSpeaking of fluff, there is a surprising amount of it in certain sections\
    \ of the Puckington Tunnels. Layers, or perhaps clouds, of dust would be explicable,\
    \ but it is difficult to account for the incredible fluffiness to be found underneath\
    \ Fort Hoity. After all, there is not a speck of fluff in either Fort Hoity itself\
    \ or in Fort Toity, and though both forts contain their fair share of dust and\
    \ orts and scum and grease-stains, all fluffiness has been eradicated, forever\
    \ and ever, yea, e'en unto the Last Trump, by the installation of modern fluff\
    \ obliteration technology developed by the computer giant Macrohard\u2122. Yet\
    \ take the staircase down from the Fort Hoity broom cupboard and enter the Puckington\
    \ Tunnels, take a left and a right and a second left, and you will be in the section\
    \ of tunnel dubbed the Fluffy Zone by those in the know. There are spits and spots\
    \ of fluff elsewhere in the system, but in this part it is quite simply overwhelming.\
    \ Nobody knows why.\nNor does anybody know why the tunnels were dug in the first\
    \ place. We know who dug them, because they are named after their digger, Puckington,\
    \ the so-called \u201Chuman mole\u201D, and we know when they were dug, for every\
    \ time he turned a corner or began a new stretch or created a tributary tunnel,\
    \ Puckington stuck pins in a panel to form the numbers of the date and hammered\
    \ the panel with nails to the tunnel wall at head height, head height for Puckington\
    \ being considerably higher than for most men, for he was eerily tall, and thus\
    \ all the tunnel junctions are unexpectedly cavernous, quite unlike the tunnels\
    \ themselves, through which Puckington himself could only move when stooped, or\
    \ by crawling upon his belly like a creeping thing as mentioned in the Bible,\
    \ a pocket-sized edition of which, in the Huckabee Version, he carried in his\
    \ pocket wherever he went a-digging, as a sort of charm or talisman which he insisted\
    \ protected him from tunnel collapses and subterranean mudslides. Obviously there\
    \ must have been one occasion when he went out with his spade and his jackhammer\
    \ and his crate of dynamite and his pickaxe and his other tunnelling paraphernalia\
    \ but forgot to tuck the Bible into his pocket, for on a very rainy Thursday Puckington\
    \ perished, buried under a ton or two of soaking wet soil the weight of which\
    \ proved too much for the wooden props with which he had shored it up in the tunnel\
    \ he was digging that day, a brand new tunnel far away from the tunnels he had\
    \ dug under Fort Hoity and which bear his name still and attract many a tourist\
    \ and many a weekend troglodyte.\nIt was as a sightseer with a bent for the loveliness\
    \ of crenellations that I discovered the Puckington Tunnels. I came to Fort Hoity\
    \ to see the fort, as did all those in my coach party. We were a gang of fort-freaks.\
    \ It happened that I became detached from my pals when, straggling at the back\
    \ of the group padding through the famed Fort Hoity corridor of cupboards, I stopped\
    \ to buy a carton of yoghurt from the yoghurt cupboard person. So delicious was\
    \ the yoghurt that I spooned all of it into my mouth there and then, only to find\
    \ that the group had gone ahead without me and I was all alone. I blundered into\
    \ the broom cupboard and followed the staircase down and thus found myself at\
    \ the entrance to the tunnels. I was awestruck, as who would not be? At the time\
    \ I jumped to the rash conclusion that the tunnels led directly underground from\
    \ Fort Hoity to Fort Toity where, I supposed, a second staircase would take me\
    \ up to the sister fort's majestic pantry, an architectural wonder of the pantry\
    \ and larder world if ever there was one.\nI did not know, then, that the Puckington\
    \ Tunnels were the work of a madman, dug without purpose, or direction, or sense.\
    \ I did not know, then, that the tunnels led nowhere, that all their twists and\
    \ turns and rises and plunges ended, if they ended at all, tapering ever narrower,\
    \ in blockages of black adamantine stone. I did not know that Puckington had,\
    \ in spite of their apparent chaos, designed his tunnels with a lunatic genius\
    \ for precision, such that he, and only he, could ever find the way out. These\
    \ are dark tunnels, these Puckington Tunnels, and I have dwelt within them, since\
    \ snacking on that carton of yoghurt, for over a hundred years."
