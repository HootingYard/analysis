    Here is a photograph of Mr Key''s mud idol. As is de rigueur with mud idols, nails
    have been driven into it. In this case, each nail represents the immortal soul
    of a badger, or of an otter. During secret ceremonies, Mr Key prostrates himself
    on his stomach before the mud idol and, in guttural ululations, beseeches it to
    pulverise his foes using the maleficent Gaar, or energy, of the badgers and otters
    impacted within its mudness.'
