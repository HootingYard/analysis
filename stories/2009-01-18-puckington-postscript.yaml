  text: "These are dark tunnels, these Puckington Tunnels, and I have dwelt within\
    \ them, since snacking on that carton of yoghurt, for over a hundred years.\n\
    That innocent little sentence, the conclusion to a piece about the Puckington\
    \ Tunnels, caused a good deal of consternation among the Hooting Yard readership,\
    \ and brought to the postbox a number of letters of complaint. This one, from\
    \ Olivia Funnel, is typical:\nDear Mr Key, she writes, I am well aware that the\
    \ Hooting Yard canon is riddled with inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and indeed\
    \ with sheer ignorance, but this time you have outdone yourself. At the end of\
    \ The Puckington Tunnels we learn that the narrator has been trapped in said tunnels\
    \ for over a century. This makes a nonsense of much of the preceding text. Even\
    \ if we take at face value the unlikely longevity of the narrator, we are left\
    \ with a number of problems, to wit:\nNone of the genres of lit referred to\u2014\
    chick, git, and zadiesmith\u2014existed one hundred years ago, so how is the narrator\
    \ aware of them? How, too, does he or she know about David Lammy's lamentable\
    \ appearance on Mastermind? If the tunnels are a magnet for tourists and part-time\
    \ troglodytes, and one cannot escape from the system once one has entered it,\
    \ surely the place must be teeming with bewildered folk? There are other stupidities\
    \ in the text, but those will do to be going on with. I think your devoted readership\
    \ deserves clarification of these matters, otherwise I will not be the only one\
    \ whose life will be blighted irreparably by flummoxment. Yours sincerely, O Funnel\
    \ (Ms).\nI was not a little perplexed by these matters myself, so I asked the\
    \ narrator to address them. It was a simple enough matter to communicate with\
    \ him using the awesome power of Woohooboo. Here is his reply:\nI am pleased your\
    \ correspondent does not take issue with my remarkable longevity, but it is still\
    \ worth explaining that it is accounted for by certain properties of the air within\
    \ the tunnels. What these properties are I cannot say, but I know I have never\
    \ felt fitter in my life and that my lung capacity is that of a fifteen-year old.\
    \ I tested it myself, only yesterday, with a plastic-and-cellophane lung analysis\
    \ kit, so that is no idle boast.\nWith her queries about my knowledge of bang\
    \ up-to-the-minute popular culture, Ms Funnel makes broad assumptions without\
    \ pausing to think things through. Can she really imagine that there is a spot\
    \ on the globe, albeit a subterranean spot, that has escaped the ubiquity of zadiesmithlit?\
    \ If anything, I would say that in the Puckington Tunnels we outdo much of the\
    \ world in our devotion to the trendily headscarved faux intellectuelle writer.\
    \ There is a cult of Zadie down here, and the totems of Jeanette Winterson have\
    \ been toppled at last! And of course we receive regular consignments of chicklit\
    \ and gitlit to keep the troglodyte zombies out of mischief. I confess that it\
    \ is unclear to me how our lit is delivered. It is, I think, something to do with\
    \ motors and rails and pulleys and vacuum tubes.\nRegarding the appearance of\
    \ the numbskull Lammy on Mastermind, my knowledge of that came to me in a vision\
    \ of almost Blakean intensity. Enough said.\nI have spoken of \u201Cwe\u201D and\
    \ \u201Cus\u201D and it is true that I am not alone in the tunnels, that we have\
    \ a thriving community here, kept busy crawling on our bellies and reading lit.\
    \ But there are fewer people than one might imagine, given the number of tourists\
    \ and weekenders. When he constructed the tunnels, the \u201Chuman mole\u201D\
    \ placed near the entrance a bottomless viper pit, modelled on the one at Shoeburyness,\
    \ and a majority of visitors plummet down that, screaming. He was a proper caution,\
    \ that Puckington.\nIt is to be hoped that Olivia Funnel and the other serial\
    \ whingers are satisfied with this compelling report from our man in the tunnels.\
    \ What he has to say makes complete sense to me, and if holes remain in his narrative,\
    \ then let it be a narrative with holes. Dennis Beerpint once wrote a poem with\
    \ holes in it, and it proved to be his most popular work, far outselling his usual\
    \ twee doggerel."
