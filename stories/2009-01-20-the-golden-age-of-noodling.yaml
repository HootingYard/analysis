  text: "A small error crept in to the piece Scenes From The Past Lives Of Tiny Enid,\
    \ where it was said that sixties psychedelic rocker Basil Groove had hung up his\
    \ plectrum. In fact, Basil Groove was the drummer in the band Turquoise Eye Of\
    \ The Lobster King, so it would be more accurate to say that he had stowed his\
    \ drumsticks in a cupboard.\nSoft-spoken and hairy, Basil Groove used to thump\
    \ his drumkit with gusto. To interviewers, he would quietly explain that \u201C\
    the drums do my talking for me\u201D. If that was really the case, it is very\
    \ difficult to know what Basil Groove wished to communicate, for his thumping\
    \ could be skittish and haphazard, as besuited a band given to twenty-minute bouts\
    \ of noodling. Such instrumental pieces were given titles of mythological resonance,\
    \ often involving wizards and dwarves and mist, but neither Basil Groove nor his\
    \ bandmates had a knack for writing lyrics. Instead they claimed to conjure up\
    \ an atmosphere, and wore ridiculous clothing.\nWhat made the band so compelling\
    \ was the authenticity of their sound. This was no accident. Basil Groove was\
    \ taught to play the drums by a genuine wizard, a figure as hairy as he with a\
    \ long grey beard, who was accompanied by a dwarvish assistant, both of them always\
    \ enshrouded in mist. He first encountered them while still a schoolboy, on his\
    \ way home after a long afternoon of Latin declension. Passing a cave, he was\
    \ startled to see the wizard and the dwarf loitering at its mouth, in mist. It\
    \ was a no-smoking cave, and the eldritch figures were taking a quick cigarette\
    \ break. Seeing young Basil Groove, the dwarf began to gibber in a high-pitched\
    \ caterwaul.\n\u201CAs it is destined, here he comes! The boy we'll teach to play\
    \ the drums! Not yet as hairy as he'll be, but wait and see! Wait and see!\u201D\
    \nAnd then the dwarf pounced upon the boy and dragged him into the cave.\nBasil\
    \ Groove emerged five years later, grown and hairy and possessed of an idiosyncratic\
    \ drumming technique. On the very same day, he answered an advertisement in the\
    \ underground newspaper Felix Dennis\u2019 Capitalist Truncheon and joined the\
    \ Turquoise Eye Of The Lobster King. The age of groovy noodling was upon us.\n\
    It was a golden age, whose memory we treasure, when hairy men's music gave us\
    \ such pleasure. They were groovy and fab and their beards were so wild. When\
    \ they noodled their noodles we were all beguiled."
