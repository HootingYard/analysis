  text: 'It has taken me a while to catch up with this, but recently at The Lumber
    Room elberry wrote "Being worshipped by ants is nothing to be proud of". I can
    see "where he''s coming from", as the airheads put it, but he is clearly unaware
    of the curious case of Old Halob, the coach and mentor of fictional athlete Bobnit
    Tivol.

    During a period in his life when he was not yet as old as he was due to become,
    Old Halob found his prowess as an egger-on of sporty feats under severe strain.
    This was in the days before he had turned the spindly, albeit fictional, Bobnit
    Tivol into a champion sprinter, and to date much of his work had been concentrated
    in the field of ice hockey puck brandishing technique. His record was patchy,
    but he had taken more than one raggle-taggle team of amateurs through cup competitions,
    in one case reaching the quarter-finals. It was his attempt to broaden his scope
    to the training of racing starlings that shattered his confidence. This was Old
    Halob''s first and only intervention in non-human, or inhuman, sport, and he quickly
    realised he was out of his depth. He found it well nigh impossible to communicate
    his vision of sportiness to birds, despite filling his pockets with millet and
    curtailing his habit of throwing rocks at swans.

    Casting around for tips, he fell in one day, upon a sandbank, with an animal behaviourist
    of great repute. This fellow, who may actually have been a charlatan, advised
    Old Halob to start by working with ants, work his way up through stoats and weasels,
    and only when he knew what he was doing to tackle the starlings. This argument
    was not without merit, for even a sports coach of genius, as Old Halob undoubtedly
    was, has to have a full understanding of ants and stoats and weasels, their habits
    and appetites, their anatomies and peccadillos, before hoping to work effectively
    with either birds or fictional athletes.

    Thus the irascible chain-smoking coach took up lodgings at the edge of an ant
    farm, and spent hours upon hours every day drilling the ants in all sorts of sporty
    disciplines. So fantastic was his rapport with the tiny insects that they came
    to worship him as a god, one who wore a Homburg hat and spat out much phlegm.
    Their weird alien insect brains underwent some kind of Old Haloby modification,
    and he became their single, simple focus, their one and only, their world.

    It was through his work with the ants that Old Halob honed the techniques which
    would make him a legend, and thus, contrary to elberry''s rash statement, he was
    always proud to be worshipped by them, as well he might be. Unfortunately, he
    did not go on to wreak his magic with either stoats of weasels or starlings, for
    one day he was out walking when he toppled into a ditch and was put in a clinic
    for a year or two. As the history books tell us, it was in that clinic, from his
    bed upon the balcony, that Old Halob learned of the existence of fictional athlete
    Bobnit Tivol. The future was set fair.'
