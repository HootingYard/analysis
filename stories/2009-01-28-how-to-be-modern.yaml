  text: 'Moderniser is favourite to lead Russian church, says the headline in today''s
    Guardian. The online edition sadly does not include the photograph of dynamic
    thrusting modernist Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk which appeared in the paper.
    But do not fret. I have found one, so readers'' jaws can drop at the breathtaking
    modernity of the man they call "Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk". That''s him
    on the right, in the oh so modern colourful robes, unlike the hopelessly passe
    figures next to him, who look positively mediaeval in their black garb. On the
    other hand, they might be beatniks, and it''s Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk
    who''s behind the times, daddy-o.
