  text: The cruel sea. The dismal pond. The glued vicar. The obsolete pudding. The
    terrible sludge. The grimy harpoonist. The Dutch pillbox. The prominent moustache.
    The customised hat. The awful pan. The disguised shrubbery. The pale horseman.
    The wicked nephew. The clueless dolt. The filthy sniper. The hot flap. The rotting
    twig. The crumpled swine. The village idiot. The spasmodic throbbings. The puckish
    stormtrooper. The flailing chump. The godforsaken peasouper. The dribbling maniac.
    The shabby cartographer. The unhinged wrestler. The tiny toadstool. The wielded
    hoe. The bloody stump. The tin bath. The crunchy plopper. The urgent message.
    The ticketyboo avalanche. The cupped sprain. The turquoise pip. The shoved helmet.
    The fantastic Moira. The governed tang. The collapsed lung. The indigestible suet.
    The stuck shirt. The old git. The worrisome spinster. The shambolic circus. The
    disgusted postman. The cheap bale. The splendid toucan. The fractious hamster.
    The baleful merchant. The spiffing socks. The Dungeness werewolf. The intrepid
    golliwog. The gaudy spats. The bewitched gubbins. The tawdry lump. The tungsten
    spigot. The wilful witch. The Ruritanian tyrant. The speckled toffee. The crumpled
    pooper. The insignificant mendicant. The woeful copse. The bad shunter. The first
    Adam. The globular emission. The spent fork. The other fork. The cataleptic nincompoop.
    The boiled dish. The sudden rink. The icy wastes. The dirty placebo. The incomprehensible
    gibberish. The fat fissure. The tansy klopstock. The gruesome boots. The Mexican
    floozie. The sordid details. The tattered tent. The vindictive biologist. The
    shabby phantom. The crashed pantechnicon. The odd chimp. The slimy bog. The shattered
    walnut. The horrible dirigible. The muddy waters. The contaminated mayonnaise.
    The belligerent scruff. The tidal estuary. The sodden moorhen. The avenging pig.
    The omnipotent Dagobert. The teeming downpour. The slapdash embroidery. The stale
    cake. The unbreakable jugs. The bonkers churning. The copper tricycle. The idiot
    savant. The charmless ragamuffin. The shredded diktat. The holy farmyard. The
    blistering flotsam. The deaf wonk. The gladsome cravat. The industrial stapler.
    The careworn widow. The lopped fig. The bulky cargo. The hepcat smoothie. The
    fundamentalist satrap. The oiled hair. The brusque Ostender. The lovely pie. The
    crushed kaboodle. The glamorous trumpet. The foul expat. The immense saucepan.
    The sequined tugboat. The gorgeous innards. The frail sot. The desperate genuflection.
    The dark peel. The grotesque kipper. The unsinkable sieve. The chumpot tawny.
    The albino chicken. The Germanic straw. The wiggling blob. The dug ditch. The
    safety pin. The fictional athlete. The abominable beaker. The popped savage. The
    glitzy surgeon. The extra limb. The chubby pickpocket. The pitted ointment. The
    wan hoop. The stricken passengers. The dotty haberdasher. The clumsy ghost. The
    frightful crevasse. The cloned duck. The unfortunate blot. The skindiving fatso.
    The drugged weasel. The jellied eel. The monstrous bag. The unreliable toothpaste.
    The preening bombast. The bitter chutney. The damp patch. The cluttered freak.
    The mordant heron. The sleeping ogre. The delightful custard. The unspeakable
    goat. The double chimney. The restricted barn. The potty boffin. The golden glut.
    The tugging pang. The clatterboard bodice. The shining throne. The plump shrike.
    The girly mittens. The sticky wolf. The Baptist cocoa. The snivelling orphan.
    The cantankerous toppler. The vile rug. The insanitary hellhole. The plastic splint.
    The chipper baronet. The navy buttons. The cheesy blubber. The surviving thieves.
    The untidy shore. The metal stick. The invisible tapeworm. The bent captain. The
    disgruntled Jesuit. The gleaming gloaming. The ratty scrimshaw. The hard biscuit.
    The grubby spittoon. The withered hoist. The ashen jackanapes. The gilded dustbin.
    The last splat. The heavy hod. The token undertaker. The whooper swan. The cruel
    sea.
