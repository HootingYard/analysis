  text: "I ought to have explained that the piece entitled The Cruel Sea was simply\
    \ a list of titles of the books currently being written by bestselling paperbackist\
    \ Pebblehead. He always has a number of works on the go at any one time, expertly\
    \ juggling everything in that big baked potato-like head of his. Hooting Yard\
    \ reader Dr Ruth Pastry tells me that she is drawing a diagram of Pebblehead's\
    \ head, or more precisely of the innards of his head, which she wants me to post\
    \ here when it is finished. That means we will all have a better, and long overdue,\
    \ insight into the great paperbackist's fantastic brain, in diagrammatic form,\
    \ with arrows.\nNOTE\_: Dr Pastry says her diagram will be without arrows."
