  text: 'I ought to have explained that the piece entitled The Cruel Sea was simply
    a list of titles of the books currently being written by bestselling paperbackist
    Pebblehead. He always has a number of works on the go at any one time, expertly
    juggling everything in that big baked potato-like head of his. Hooting Yard reader
    Dr Ruth Pastry tells me that she is drawing a diagram of Pebblehead''s head, or
    more precisely of the innards of his head, which she wants me to post here when
    it is finished. That means we will all have a better, and long overdue, insight
    into the great paperbackist''s fantastic brain, in diagrammatic form, with arrows.

    NOTE : Dr Pastry says her diagram will be without arrows.'
