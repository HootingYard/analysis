  text: 'I paid a visit to my friend Becke Beiderbix in her fortress in the mountains.
    We had known each other since childhood, growing up on a postwar housing estate,
    a workaday world of compactness and convention. But Becke was always a singleminded
    girl who followed her own strange star, and while the rest of us went off to polytechnics
    and office jobs and became fodder for a peculiarly dull-witted type of English
    fiction, Becke decamped to the mountains and built herself a fortress with her
    bare hands. I had no idea where she had picked up the skills to do this, and in
    truth, when I visited I was astonished to find how solid and immense and impregnable
    her fortress appeared, a massive edifice perched upon a bluff, as forbidding in
    its aspect as the Schloss Adler in Where Eagles Dare, but without the Nazi connotations,
    for Becke was the most apolitical person I have ever known.

    When she greeted me at the gate, she was holding a cornet in her hand.

    "Hello, Dennis," she said, planting a peck on my cheek, "As you can see I have
    taken up the cornet, like my near-namesake Bix Beiderbecke, the original young
    man with a horn, and perhaps the greatest jazzman of the nineteen-twenties."

    "From fortress-building to cornet-playing, you never cease to amaze me, Becke,"
    I replied, dumping my weekend luggage in a corner of the grim brickish vestibule.

    "As you are well aware, I follow my own strange star," she said, steering me into
    the canteen of the fortress where she ladled soup out of a tureen into a pair
    of bowls.

    "This is my own home-made soup," she announced, "For in addition to building the
    fortress and learning the cornet I have taken a correspondence course in devising
    original soup recipes. In your bowl you have what I dubbed Becke Beiderbix''s
    Boiled Black Broth, in which every single ingredient begins with the letter B.
    As you can see, it is a black soup, of a black so black that if you stare at it,
    instead of spooning it into your mouth, you will become entranced, pretty much
    like a voodoo zombie-person, and be entirely within my power."

    "Then I shall shut my eyes while I drain the bowl, Becke," I said.

    "Yes, I was about to recommend you do just that, Dennis," she replied.

    The soup proved to be bland and without even a hint of taste, but it warmed my
    innards and stopped the gurgling in my belly.

    "Now that your belly has stopped gurgling, Dennis, I shall take you to see my
    workshop," said Becke, and I followed her into the bowels of the fortress, to
    a room with a thousand padlocks and reinforced walls and sputtering candles. I
    half-expected to see a gibbering hunchback named Mungo, but it seemed Becke worked
    without assistance.

    "Well now," I said, "You have many towering piles of metal tapping machine directories
    from all around the world, much thumbed through and dog-eared, as if you have
    been poring over them with terrific diligence, Becke".

    "That I have, Dennis," she replied, "It is drudgery to be sure, but necessary
    to the success of my project."

    Of course, I asked her what the project was, and her reply shocked me to the marrow.
    For all that her star was a strange one, it had never occurred to me that Becke
    was capable of the abduction and incarceration, in dungeons beneath her fortress,
    of eight completely innocent souls. She had gone through those directories searching
    for names, and when she alit upon an apt name she tracked the person down, wheresoever
    they might be, and she crept up on them and shoved a rag soaked in chloroform
    over their breathing channels, and shoved them into the back of her van, and drove
    like the devil himself at tiptop speed until back in her mountain fastness, and
    then she dragged the abductee down into one of her dungeons and slammed the heavy
    iron door shut upon them, and every day thereafter she took them a bowl of her
    black, black soup, and made them stare into its blackness until it was lukewarm,
    so they were pretty much like voodoo zombie-persons, entirely within her power,
    and then she commanded them to drink the soup, until the gurgling in their bellies
    ceased.

    "But why, Becke, why?" I shrieked, as if taking part in a melodrama, wondering
    how the sensible, resourceful woman I had known had become quite loopy.

    "Oh, this is only part one of the plan, Dennis," she said, "It will all make perfect
    sense now that I have an abductee in each of my eight dungeons. You would not
    believe how long it has taken me to work my way through those confounded directories
    to find the names I need. And then of course to travel hither and yon to wherever
    they are and do the bit with the chloroform, which has its own risks. You gape
    at me goggle-eyed, Dennis, as if I have taken leave of my senses, and I would
    agree with you were it not that all this is merely a preparation for a grander
    scheme."

    I did not discover, over that weekend, what the grander scheme was. Becke showed
    me a few other things in her workshop, including some mysterious small trunks,
    then insisted that we head on up to her rooftop pingpong area and play pingpong
    for hours and hours. Every so often she took a break to visit the dungeons, and
    left me to lie on my back, exhausted, staring at the bitter sky, trying not to
    think about what in heaven''s name was going on far below in the subterranean
    depths of the fortress.

    I made my farewell on the Sunday evening, after being given a bowl of a different
    home-made soup which I could sup without shutting my eyes. It was as bland as
    the black zombie soup, but extremely welcome after all that pingpong. Becke waved
    at me as I trudged down the mountainside towards the bus stop. I looked back,
    and there she stood, at her fortress gate, and above her in the now darkening
    sky shone a single star. I couldn''t help but smile. She may have become bonkers,
    but she would always be my pal.

    A year or so passed. I was too busy with my halibut research to give much thought
    to Becke and her eight abductees. I sent her the occasional metal tapping machine
    message, to which she always replied, although she never said much about what
    she was up to, confining herself to remarks about general fortress maintenance.
    And then one day, passing through Pointy Town, some kind of woolly-hatted student
    in need of pin money handed me a leaflet. I shoved it into my pocket and forgot
    about it, and only later, as I was rummaging through my jacket for scrunched-up
    halibut research notes, did I come upon it and read it.

    Pointy Town Hepcat Jazz Club, it said, is pleased to announce a concert by a thrilling
    new combo. For the past year, Becke Beiderbix has been teaching the cornet to
    an octet of eight amateurs, and she is now ready to lead them in what promises
    to be a fantastic debut. The Becke Beiderbix Bix Beiderbecke Tribute Cornet Octet,
    featuring newcomers Bixder Beibecke, Beike Bixderbec, Kebec Bixderbei, Bixbec
    Beiderke, Beibix Becderke, Derke Bixbecbei, Kebeider Bixbec, and Bixke Derbeibec
    will perform a show of Bix Beiderbecke classics. Soup will be served, in the form
    of Becke Beiderbix''s Boiled Black Broth. Admission free.

    I attended the show, of course, but shut my eyes for the soup.'
