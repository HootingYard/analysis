  text: "As I wander about the world, or my small part of it, one thing I find peculiarly\
    \ distressing is the number of persons of frantic mien who rush up to me and clutch\
    \ at my lapels, beseeching me.\n\u201CMr Key, Mr Key!\u201D they plead, in cracked\
    \ voices, \u201CPlease tell me how to see gnomes! I want to be able to see gnomes!\u201D\
    \nWhat all these poor souls have in common is a tragic awareness that gnomes exist\
    \ coupled with an inability to perceive them. I speak of course of real gnomes\
    \ which, though they bear a striking resemblance to the jolly garden gnome beloved\
    \ of suburbia, with his pointy hat and pot belly and, occasionally, his angling\
    \ equipment, are by no means made of stoneware or plastic, and cannot be bought\
    \ in a garden centre. Real gnomes caper in the woods, going about their gnomey\
    \ business, but are very difficult to see. Yet judging by the number of people\
    \ who buttonhole me in the street, there is clearly a great desire among our citizens\
    \ to \u201Cget down with the gnomes\u201D, much as politicians like to \u201C\
    get down with the kids\u201D.\nIt has never been entirely clear to me why I should\
    \ be thought to have some kind of inner track to the world of gnomes. I can only\
    \ surmise that Hooting Yard's reputation as a repository of the sum of human,\
    \ and inhuman, knowledge must be spreading far and wide, and this must be a good\
    \ thing. Lord knows, I try my best, both here on the website and on my weekly\
    \ radio programme, to expound the wisdom of the ages. Despite the often dishevelled\
    \ and wild-eyed state of my street importuners, it is good to know that my efforts\
    \ are not entirely in vain.\nSo what I usually do when assailed by one of these\
    \ social inadequates is to take them aside and, after checking that they have\
    \ sufficient cash to pay for a couple of cups of tea, lead them to a caf\xE9,\
    \ where we sit together at a formica-topped table. They usually calm down a bit\
    \ after a couple of slurps of tea, though I often have to explain that I have\
    \ not brought them to gnomeland as such, and they are unlikely to be able to see\
    \ any gnomes just yet. This can crush the spirits of the more emotionally frail\
    \ beseechers, who seem to think I can just snap my fingers and make gnomes appear\
    \ before their eyes. It takes patience, and empathy, and as many additional cups\
    \ of tea for me that they can afford, to explain things to them.\nEventually,\
    \ still in the caf\xE9, and possibly stuffed with pastry treats too, depending\
    \ on the financial resources of the shabby indigent opposite me, I remove from\
    \ my pocket a scrunched-up scrap of paper on which I have copied out some very\
    \ wise words. I unscrunch the scrap, and read as follows:\n\u201CThis, chum, is\
    \ an extract from Theosophy\_: An Introduction To The Supersensible Knowledge\
    \ Of The World And The Destination Of Man by Rudolf Steiner, published in 1910.\
    \ He says: The spiritual outlook, in fact, is through [the Spirit of the Age (the\
    \ Zeitgeist)], extended over a variety of other beings, both lower and higher,\
    \ who live in the environment of man without his being able to perceive them with\
    \ his bodily senses. But those who have powers of spiritual sight perceive such\
    \ beings and can describe them. To the lower kinds belong those designated by\
    \ the spiritual investigator, as salamanders, sylphs, undines, and gnomes. It\
    \ is quite to be understood that anyone who is inclined to admit the validity\
    \ of physical vision only, regards such beings as the offspring of a wild hallucination\
    \ and superstition. They can of course never become visible to the physical eye\
    \ for they have no physical bodies. The superstition does not consist in regarding\
    \ such beings as real, but in believing that they appear in a way perceptible\
    \ to the physical senses. Beings with such forms cooperate in the building of\
    \ the world, and one comes into connection with them as soon as one enters the\
    \ higher regions closed to the bodily senses.\u201D\nThen I scrunch up the scrap\
    \ of paper, shove it back into my pocket, and, after getting the pitiful wretch\
    \ to hand over any remaining cash they have about their person, dismiss them from\
    \ my presence. My presence being, of course, a shining aura illuminating the gutter.\
    \ He was a very clever man, that Rudolf Steiner."
