  text: 'A letter arrives from OutaSpaceman:

    Dear Frank, I have been doing a bit of research into Barbaric tribes* and found
    this paragraph (relating to the Visigoths) on the hhg2g site:

    "There was still time for one last Gothic comedy. The panicking King Wamba called
    up priests to the army to prepare for a full-scale Moorish invasion, but the newly
    armed priests threw their lot in with a group of revolutionary nobles. In what
    must be one of the most bizarre coups of all time, Wamba was drugged and dressed
    as a monk. The rebels also shaved his head, because to the Visigoths long hair
    was a symbol of sovereignty. The embarrassed king stood aside for the rebel leader
    Ervigius. Then, when Ervigius'' grandson Witiza died, a brief civil war of succession
    put King Roderick on the throne in 710 in place of Witiza''s son, Achila. It was
    an inauspicious year for the Visigoths."

    Oh, to be ruled by Panicking King Wamba...

    Yours, OutaSpaceman

    *This is considered to be the finest opening line of any letter Mr Key has ever
    received.'
