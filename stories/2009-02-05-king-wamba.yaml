  text: "A letter arrives from OutaSpaceman:\nDear Frank, I have been doing a bit\
    \ of research into Barbaric tribes* and found this paragraph (relating to the\
    \ Visigoths) on the hhg2g site:\n\u201CThere was still time for one last Gothic\
    \ comedy. The panicking King Wamba called up priests to the army to prepare for\
    \ a full-scale Moorish invasion, but the newly armed priests threw their lot in\
    \ with a group of revolutionary nobles. In what must be one of the most bizarre\
    \ coups of all time, Wamba was drugged and dressed as a monk. The rebels also\
    \ shaved his head, because to the Visigoths long hair was a symbol of sovereignty.\
    \ The embarrassed king stood aside for the rebel leader Ervigius. Then, when Ervigius\u2019\
    \ grandson Witiza died, a brief civil war of succession put King Roderick on the\
    \ throne in 710 in place of Witiza's son, Achila. It was an inauspicious year\
    \ for the Visigoths.\u201D\nOh, to be ruled by Panicking King Wamba\u2026\nYours,\
    \ OutaSpaceman\n*This is considered to be the finest opening line of any letter\
    \ Mr Key has ever received."
