  text: "And while I was scrubbling about in the archive looking for Babbage, I came\
    \ upon this, from 28 January 2004:\n\u201CIt is a curious fact that the crowbar\
    \ is one of the very few tools to be named after our avian cousins. Things have\
    \ come to a pretty pass when our habits of nomenclature are so bereft. It is in\
    \ an attempt to rectify this sorry state of affairs that the manufacturing arm\
    \ of the Hooting Yard Foundation is working on the production of an exciting new\
    \ range of ironmongery products, to wit: guillemot bolts; lapwing nozzles; lark\
    \ basins; coot clips; teal pins; bittern jacks; little bittern jacks; snow bunting\
    \ tacks; flamingo hasps; grebe locks; moorhen horns; corncrake hinges; raven sticks;\
    \ tern rotors; buzzard extractors; and pipit wrenches.\u201D\nWith much shame,\
    \ and rending of garments, I have to confess that in the five years since that\
    \ was written, not a single one of these fabulous products has yet appeared on\
    \ the shelves of our credit crunchy mongers."
