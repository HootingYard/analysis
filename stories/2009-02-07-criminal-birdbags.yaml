  text: "Another one from the archives\u2026\nHistorians of crime have long been fascinated\
    \ by the Birdbag family, whose exploits were regularly recorded in the penny dreadfuls\
    \ of their day. Seldom has such purple prose been so apt, for their deeds were\
    \ truly the last word in scampishness and mischief. To rekindle the memories of\
    \ older readers, and to introduce a new generation to this dastardly clan, here\
    \ is a brief guide.\n\_\n\nCorky Birdbag, the fiend who pushed a knock-kneed unfortunate\
    \ into a lake, and stole his bus ticket.\n\_\n\nPolly Birdbag, whose forgery of\
    \ Selected Poems by Walter Pater fooled a docent at the University of Ack.\n\_\
    \n\nOld Ma Birdbag, whose tunnels were so expertly dug that the police thought\
    \ moles were responsible.\n\_\n\_\n\nVenkad Birdbag, the so-called \u201CCardboard\
    \ Hooter Man\u201D, who hooted through a cardboard funnel.\n\_\n\_\n\nLoopy Birdbag,\
    \ the woman who sent consignments of boiled sweets to Stalin and Barbara Stanwyck\
    \ at whim.\n\_\n\_\n\nFontella Bass-Birdbag, the queasy maven of sabotage who\
    \ did dark deeds with a whisk and a pin-cushion.\n\_\n\_\n\nPark Fang Birdbag,\
    \ desperate banjo player who often stood next to nondescript ponds for no purpose\
    \ but evil.\n\_\n\_\n\nSmedley Birdbag, wanted by the police of four continents\
    \ for doing something weird with a toy pig sty.\n\_\n\_\n\_"
