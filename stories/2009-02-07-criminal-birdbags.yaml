  text: "Another one from the archives...\nHistorians of crime have long been fascinated\
    \ by the Birdbag family, whose exploits were regularly recorded in the penny dreadfuls\
    \ of their day. Seldom has such purple prose been so apt, for their deeds were\
    \ truly the last word in scampishness and mischief. To rekindle the memories of\
    \ older readers, and to introduce a new generation to this dastardly clan, here\
    \ is a brief guide.\n \n\nCorky Birdbag, the fiend who pushed a knock-kneed unfortunate\
    \ into a lake, and stole his bus ticket.\n \n\nPolly Birdbag, whose forgery of\
    \ Selected Poems by Walter Pater fooled a docent at the University of Ack.\n \n\
    \nOld Ma Birdbag, whose tunnels were so expertly dug that the police thought moles\
    \ were responsible.\n \n \n\nVenkad Birdbag, the so-called \"Cardboard Hooter\
    \ Man\", who hooted through a cardboard funnel.\n \n \n\nLoopy Birdbag, the woman\
    \ who sent consignments of boiled sweets to Stalin and Barbara Stanwyck at whim.\n\
    \ \n \n\nFontella Bass-Birdbag, the queasy maven of sabotage who did dark deeds\
    \ with a whisk and a pin-cushion.\n \n \n\nPark Fang Birdbag, desperate banjo\
    \ player who often stood next to nondescript ponds for no purpose but evil.\n\
    \ \n \n\nSmedley Birdbag, wanted by the police of four continents for doing something\
    \ weird with a toy pig sty.\n \n \n "
