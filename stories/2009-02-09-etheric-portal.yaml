  text: 'For quite some time now, ever since I had a revelatory picnicking experience
    in a muddy field, I have been on the lookout for a proper Etheric Portal featuring
    the Circle of Power. Thanks to the Counterknowledge website, I have at last tracked
    one down. Doesn''t it look reliable?


    According to the blurb on the Ultimate Metaphysical Power Tools website, this
    particular Etheric Portal is "Brand New: Psychotronic 8, Etheric Portal Plus Supreme,
    Version 3.0, FEATURING THE CIRCLE OF POWER. Now Made With New ULTIMATE Orgontek
    (Orgone Matrix Material)".

    I found all those capital letters pretty exciting, and if you are sensible enough
    to go to the site, you will see lots and lots of bright colours too, making for
    a really braintastic visit. Here is the full spec of what must be the best Etheric
    Portal I''ve ever seen for sale:

    "This is the ultimate Psychotronic / Life Force Energy Enhanced Radionics / Psionics
    workstation, nothing even comes close to this powerful subtle etheric energy instrument.

    Featuring:

    The Circle Of Power, Version 3.0

    Variable-Capacitance Psychotronic / Radionic Tuner Control panels (2 Rad Cases
    12 Dials each)

    Photon Light Force Energy Projector Box: Vogel Cut Crystal (double terminated,
    12 sided) with Blue Light Beam Projecting through Crystal and Radiating the center
    Beamer Witness Plate with a high vibrational energy bath

    Scalar wave technology

    Magnetron Technology

    Life Force Energy Technology

    Vibrational Shape Wave Energy Patterns

    Sacred Geometry

    Crystal Power Technology

    Electronic Amplifier Module Transmitting System with 2 Transmitting Antenna

    Orgone E (Energy) Block Etheric Energy Projection System

    Sound Wave Input Feature

    Fixed and Variable Frequency Tuning System

    This amazing workstation features the upgraded and powerful etheric energy reactor
    the Circle Of Power, version 3.0, 5 years in the making its finally released to
    the public. Now you can do 8 operations simultaneous at one time for both your
    Trend/Remedy and or Target/Witness.

    Scalar wave technology combined with life force energy technology, Russian style
    Psychotronics, and Metaphysical Radionics makes this the most powerful Radionics
    / Psychotronic instrument available at this time.

    Finally a Radionics machine with enough etheric juice (fuel) to open a portal
    to other energy systems. The Psychotronic 8''s CIRCLE OF POWER is a vortex of
    flowing universal energy or "chi", it can be said that it is an etheric energy
    reactor in the subtle energy realms."

    I was so mind-numbed (in a good way) by all this that I had to go and lie down,
    so I didn''t explore the website thoroughly enough to gather how much it costs.
    As far as I recall, it says somewhere that it''s "under $3,000". Frankly, I wouldn''t
    care if it was over $3,000--or over $30,000. I want one, and I want one now!'
