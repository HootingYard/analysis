  text: 'Mr Key is pleased to announce that readers, obsessives, and persons of a
    bonkers disposition can now follow Hooting Yard on Witter. As you may already
    know, Witter is an exciting new social networking service, designed for people
    with pea-sized brains who want to shrink them further, even unto the point of
    invisibility. The idea is that, every fifty years, "witterers" write an account
    of their doings, in beautiful if somewhat clogged handwriting, on sheets of vellum,
    and roll the sheets up, and seal them with wax, and carry them around the countryside,
    stopping every now and then to accost a wayfarer or a peasant, whom they shove
    into a ditch, and to whom they then read the "witter", aloud, and at length. I
    think you will all agree that this is a splendid new way to get the Hooting Yard
    message across to folk far and wide.

    Witter should not be confused with a similar service, recently popularised by,
    among others, the Most Intelligent Life-Form Ever To Walk The Earth, otherwise
    known as Stephen Fry, who cleverly uses it to demonstrate his command of childish
    scatological exclamations, to the delight of a thankful nation.
