  text: "Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet, the most magnetic cartoon character of the Atomic\
    \ Age, was the brainchild of a washed-up has-been called Lamont Pinochet. As with\
    \ his namesake, the brutal Chilean dictator, Pinochet's surname was mispronounced\
    \ as \u201CPinoshay\u201D by all and sundry. \u201CI have a hard T, like Turandot!\u201D\
    , the cartoonist used to shout, slumped in the gutter, as he often was before\
    \ the late-flowering success he found with his magnetic hero. Even after that\
    \ success, he spent much of his time in the gutter, for he had grown familiar\
    \ with it, and felt comforted by the proximity of drains.\nIt is said that once,\
    \ when he was in the gutter, Pinochet got embroiled in a terrific argument with\
    \ a passer-by who insisted that General Augusto Pinochet himself pronounced his\
    \ name \u201CPinoshay\u201D, and that Giacomo Puccini specifically intended Turandot\
    \ to be pronounced \u201CTurandoh\u201D. The cartoonist was by this time so washed-up\
    \ that he could barely summon the energy to respond, but it was the one thing\
    \ he felt fierce about, so he inhaled the fumes from the nearest drain and gave\
    \ his opponent a verbal battering.\nI have my doubts that this incident can be\
    \ true, for at the time the Chilean would have been a youngster, and not yet a\
    \ general, and unknown on the world stage. Be that as it may, there is something\
    \ uplifting in the picture of the bedraggled cartoonist, dressed presumably in\
    \ rags, gathering his wits in a Winslety gathering way, and demanding his final\
    \ T be spoken aloud. Which of us can be sure we would have such gumption, even\
    \ if it seems to be a trivial thing to get into a lather about?\nGumption, of\
    \ course, is the quality we most readily associate with Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet,\
    \ together with perkiness and magnetism. In all his adventures, set in the fictional\
    \ city of Magnetville, battling evildoers and outwitting communists, Magnet Boy!\
    \ The Boy Magnet shows such incredible levels of gumption that, even as we cheer\
    \ him on, we fret about his health. How is it, we ask, that such a little chap,\
    \ albeit one whose physical form takes the shape of a snub-nosed perky head atop\
    \ a large horeshoe magnet, can display such gumption week in, week out, without\
    \ falling prey to the sort of debilitating weakness and neurasthenia that put\
    \ Edgar Allan Poe in his grave at the age of forty? Ah, but then we remind ourselves\
    \ that Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet is fictional, and does not suffer the worldly\
    \ buffets that beset Poe, and we are relieved.\nBut worldly buffets certainly\
    \ beset Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet's creator Lamont Pinochet. Even before he found\
    \ himself in the gutter, curled up by drains, he had been thrown from horses,\
    \ trapped in the mountains, buried alive, stranded on a beach, pursued by bears,\
    \ ravaged by toxins, imprisoned for tomfoolery, shoved in front of an express\
    \ train, attacked by irredentists, smothered by pillows, punched by a pig farmer,\
    \ locked in a cubicle, spat at by Mormons, burned by the sun, plagued by whitlows,\
    \ bled by cupping, tarred and feathered, and pelted with pebbles. He had also\
    \ repeatedly had his ears syringed by charlatans. He faced each and every one\
    \ of these outrages with whining and self-pity, crawling ever further down a moral\
    \ slope towards degradation and disgust.\nAnd yet all this time he was scribbling\
    \ his cartoons, on scraps of paper, on the backs of fag packets, on his own forehead.\
    \ Somehow none of these earlier creations ever caught the public imagination,\
    \ or even Pinochet's own imagination. There was a strip based on the more impenetrable\
    \ essays of John Ruskin. There was a plethora of chapbooks featuring a talking\
    \ celery stick called Drax, but because Drax came from another, celery-dominated\
    \ planet, he spoke in space-gibberish. There was a character called Unconscious\
    \ Squirrel!, a squirrel that was unconscious. Pinochet plugged away, trying out\
    \ each and every idea that popped in to his head, no matter how stupid, and all\
    \ the while the gutter beckoned.\nThe gutter, the gutter\u2026 the gutter that,\
    \ miraculously, inspired Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet. Oh, how I would love to reproduce\
    \ just one, tiny picture of my cartoon hero. But I cannot, for to do so is forbidden.\
    \ In his last will and testament, done in cartoon strip form, Lamont Pinochet\
    \ declared that, with his death, all trace of his life on earth be wholly and\
    \ utterly obliterated. \u201CI shall be expunged!\u201D sings his alter ego, a\
    \ singing ringing carpet beetle. And so it came to pass."
