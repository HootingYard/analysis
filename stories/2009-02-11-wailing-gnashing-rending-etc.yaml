  text: 'Astute readers will note that posts currently appear undated and without
    a comment option. This is due to one of those laughably-named "upgrades", which
    as far as I can see just make life more difficult. Fear not, equilibrium will
    be restored as soon as possible. I will be wittering about this in due course
    (i.e., in approximately fifty years time).

    UPDATE : Dates and Comments restored, as you can see. The Yard''s boffin is working
    on further tweaks to tidy up the spacing between posts and a few other horrors.

    UPDATE UPDATE : Back to normal. I suppose I could delete this post, but I will
    leave it here for the historical record, to be pored over by future scholars.
    Also, leaving it here means I can continue to assert that there has been at least
    one posting every day since the sixteenth of December last year, which makes a
    change from the awful hiatuses (hiatae?) of yore.'
