  text: "Maud Glubb, the aviatrix and author of The Book Of Gnats, is just one among\
    \ a number of Glubbs of note. This ought not surprise us. After all, as H P Lovecraft\
    \ wrote in The Thing On The Doorstep, It began with a telephone call just before\
    \ midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took down the receiver in the\
    \ library. No one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up and go\
    \ to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end.\
    \ Was someone trying under great difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought\
    \ I heard a sort of half-liquid bubbling noise\u2014\u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026\
    \ glub\u201D\u2014which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible\
    \ word and syllable divisions. I called \u201CWho is it?\u201D But the only answer\
    \ was \u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026 glub-glub.\u201D (The one-B Glub is a common\
    \ American variant of the more standard two-B Glubb.) It can be argued that Lovecraft's\
    \ \u201Cglub\u201D is a repetition of a single Glubb, much as we accept that Edgar\
    \ Allan Poe was referring to only one person when he shouted the name \u201CReynolds!\u201D\
    \ repeatedly as he lay dying in the Washington College Hospital in Baltimore.\
    \ Yet Lovecraft clearly indicates \u201Cunintelligible word and syllable divisions\u201D\
    , which sensible people who have their wits about them will take as hard evidence\
    \ of multiple Glubbs.\nOne such other Glubb, if we use that term to distinguish\
    \ our subjects from the aviatrix, was Old Mother Glubb. This fine upstanding dowager\
    \ was not the mother of Maud Glubb, by the way. In fact as far as we can ascertain,\
    \ Old Mother Glubb had no children. She was dubbed \u201COld Mother\u201D because\
    \ she was very aged, at the time we learn of her existence, and because she bred\
    \ moths. It is easy to see how people assumed that \u201CMother\u201D, to rhyme\
    \ with \u201CHiawatha\u201D, should be pronounced to rhyme instead with \u201C\
    brother\u201D. From such tiny presumptions can titanic historical errors occur.\
    \ Several bright and promising genealogists saw their careers ruined, their health\
    \ destroyed, and their lives wasted as they tried and failed to track down Old\
    \ Mother Glubb's non-existent progeny. Had they known about her revolutionary\
    \ moth-breeding programme, and the attention it gained from moth experts on two\
    \ or three continents, things may have been very different indeed. Or perhaps\
    \ not. Perhaps each of these genealogists had a fatal flaw which sent them chasing\
    \ phantoms, and had they not driven themselves mad with Old Mother Glubb, they\
    \ would have alighted upon some other hopeless pursuit. There are many, in the\
    \ groves of academe.\nThere is, for example, the case of another Glubb, Binnie\
    \ Glubb, the man who became Professor of Futile Studies at a large important university.\
    \ Sometimes called the senile grandparent of postmodernism, Binnie Glubb spent\
    \ years and years writing incomprehensible twaddle, in unreadable prose, about\u2026\
    \ well, about god knows what. If we knew what he was writing about it would suggest\
    \ that occasionally he was both comprehensible and readable, and he was neither,\
    \ ever. And yet his screeds were typeset and bound and published and sold and\
    \ stuck upon shelves in libraries across the land, and he had his photograph taken,\
    \ smoking a pipe, shoulder to shoulder with a French intellectual or a Maoist\
    \ psychopath, and airheads wrote fawning profiles of him for the Sunday supplements.\n\
    No such plaudits for the next Glubb in our set, the one-legged bobsleigh competitor\
    \ Digby Glubb. He was a sports-mad youth who was nonetheless completely useless\
    \ at everything he tried. Failing at p\xE9tanque, he took up pingpong. Failing\
    \ at pingpong, he tried vinkensport. Savaged by finches, he turned to curling,\
    \ and failed again, failed better, as Beckett might say. All this time he had\
    \ two legs. On his thirtieth birthday, still utterly useless in all sporting events,\
    \ he toppled into a ditch full of fierce biting ants, which ate most of one of\
    \ his legs before he was rescued by an ant-killing patrol. Recovering in a superbly\
    \ sterile clinic, Digby Glubb researched sports he could take part in while sitting\
    \ down, and decided to devote his life to bobsleigh, in spite of the fact that\
    \ he did not quite understand the point of it. For two decades he continually\
    \ crashed any bobsleigh he sat in, whether solo or as part of a team. What drove\
    \ him on, from one calamity to another? Was it perhaps revenge against the fierce\
    \ biting ants which had hobbled him? There are those who can be spurred on by\
    \ often harmful derangements, be they vengeance or jealousy or preening vanity.\n\
    Consider the cravattiste Shelvington Glubb. Convinced that, when he wore one of\
    \ his cravats, he might be mistaken for a young Apollo, this Glubb pranced about\
    \ the boulevards of Pointy Town watching Pointy Towners gasp and swoon at his\
    \ beauty. Some of them were blinded, he was so like the sun.\nThere, you have\
    \ some Glubbs to be going on with."
