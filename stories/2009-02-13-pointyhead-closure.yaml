  text: "Hooting Yard has been threatened with closure by a pointyhead. And no, I\
    \ don't mean airhead \u201Cclosure\u201D, I mean real closure, shutting down,\
    \ expungement from the web. This is apparently because our risk assessment protocols\
    \ and strategies lack robustness and transparency. Mr Key asked the pointyhead\
    \ where we were going wrong, and was told there was an unacceptable risk to \u201C\
    users\u201D that their heads would become blunter and would need to be sluiced\
    \ out with a whitewash-based fluid, or possibly some kind of gas.\nSticking up\
    \ for your rights, Mr Key demanded that the pointyhead produce evidence to back\
    \ up so foul an accusation. This was duly provided in the form of a cupboard full\
    \ of documents, all of which had been signed by the pointyhead and countersigned\
    \ by the pointyhead's own pointyhead person. By skim-reading just one bulging\
    \ Lever arch file, Mr Key learned that there was a whole hierarchy of risk tsars,\
    \ risk rapporteurs, risk champions, risk adjudicators, and whatnot. It was like\
    \ theology.\nMr Key set fire to the cupboard and pushed the pointyhead into a\
    \ pond.\_"
