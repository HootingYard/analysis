  text: 'Hooting Yard has been threatened with closure by a pointyhead. And no, I
    don''t mean airhead "closure", I mean real closure, shutting down, expungement
    from the web. This is apparently because our risk assessment protocols and strategies
    lack robustness and transparency. Mr Key asked the pointyhead where we were going
    wrong, and was told there was an unacceptable risk to "users" that their heads
    would become blunter and would need to be sluiced out with a whitewash-based fluid,
    or possibly some kind of gas.

    Sticking up for your rights, Mr Key demanded that the pointyhead produce evidence
    to back up so foul an accusation. This was duly provided in the form of a cupboard
    full of documents, all of which had been signed by the pointyhead and countersigned
    by the pointyhead''s own pointyhead person. By skim-reading just one bulging Lever
    arch file, Mr Key learned that there was a whole hierarchy of risk tsars, risk
    rapporteurs, risk champions, risk adjudicators, and whatnot. It was like theology.

    Mr Key set fire to the cupboard and pushed the pointyhead into a pond. '
