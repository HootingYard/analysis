  text: "I have been much enjoying the Times Archive Blog recently. Old news can be\
    \ so much more appealing than new news\u2014that is, news\u2014particularly when,\
    \ as in this case which I belatedly bring to your attention, it features a postie\
    \ toppling into a ditch, a scene that could come straight from a Hooting Yard\
    \ story:\nAbout noon on Thursday as a labourer, in the employ of Mr Cooper, of\
    \ Pyrford\u2014a village about seven miles from Guildford\u2014was passing through\
    \ Pondfield, in the neighbourhood of his master's farm, he espied an object in\
    \ the ditch, which attracted his attention. On examination the object, which was\
    \ nearly covered with snow, turned out to be a man named Tappin, the messenger\
    \ who delivers post letters in the outlying districts of which Pyrford and Wisley\
    \ form part. Mr Cooper was at once communicated with, and he speedily arranged\
    \ for the delivery of the letters, while with equal promptitude the messenger\
    \ was assisted from his bed of snow, where he had been for some hours. Tappin's\
    \ account is that he got into the drift and pitched headlong into the ditch, when\
    \ he was too exhausted to extricate himself.\nAs the Times\u2019 archivist notes,\
    \ how pleasing it is that the reporter assures us of the safe delivery of the\
    \ post before\_mentioning the rescue of the hapless Tappin. I suspect strongly\
    \ that, almost a century and a half after his ditch trauma, Postie Tappin may\
    \ be resurrected as a Hooting Yard character."
