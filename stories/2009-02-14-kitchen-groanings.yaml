  text: '"Kitchen Groanings addressed to the Parlour : a pamphlet so called, published
    fifty years ago. It is the spirited remonstrance of some angry cook-wench, or
    discontented housemaid, against lazy footmen with their ruffles, their canes,
    their bags, and powdered heads, who run away with the pecuniary perquisites, or,
    as they were at that period called, vails, without having their due proportion
    of the hard work of the house. This publication is said to have been actually
    produced by one of the sisterhood, whose cause it pleads; and, considering the
    quarter from whence it issued, is not badly written."

    Critical &c. Collected and Recorded by An Eminent Literary Character (I. J. Chidley,
    London 1841)

    I am not quite sure, but I think Dobson may have produced a Kitchen Groanings
    pamphlet of his own.'
