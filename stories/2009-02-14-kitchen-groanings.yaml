  text: "\u201CKitchen Groanings addressed to the Parlour\_: a pamphlet so called,\
    \ published fifty years ago. It is the spirited remonstrance of some angry cook-wench,\
    \ or discontented housemaid, against lazy footmen with their ruffles, their canes,\
    \ their bags, and powdered heads, who run away with the pecuniary perquisites,\
    \ or, as they were at that period called, vails, without having their due proportion\
    \ of the hard work of the house. This publication is said to have been actually\
    \ produced by one of the sisterhood, whose cause it pleads; and, considering the\
    \ quarter from whence it issued, is not badly written.\u201D\nFrom Anecdotiana;\
    \ or, A Library of Anecdote. Facts and Opinions, Historical, Biographical, Critical\
    \ &c. Collected and Recorded by An Eminent Literary Character (I. J. Chidley,\
    \ London 1841)\nI am not quite sure, but I think Dobson may have produced a Kitchen\
    \ Groanings pamphlet of his own."
