  text: 'Dax Pod clad in umber. Dax Pod Uberperson. Atop a large building, as he so
    often is.

    "I am Dax Pod," he says, "King of standing atop large buildings, declaiming."

    He declaims that he is Dax Pod and he is clad in umber and is an Uberperson.

    Dax Pod fans gather in the street below, peering at their hero through binoculars.

    Some fans have lorgnettes. Some fans are bluestockings. Dax Pod appeals to them
    because he knows his Milton, he knows his Sir Thomas Browne, he knows his Sylvia
    Townsend Warner. Sometimes as he stands, clad in umber, in his cape, atop a large
    building, he holds in one hand a literary work by one or other of this trio. He
    can, it is said, recite the entire works of Herman Melville from memory, including
    Pierre, or The Ambiguities.

    He is a man to be reckoned with.

    He swoops, from atop the large building, wherever and whenever he is needed. It
    may be a postal  delivery error, or a dog pound incident, or a planetary cataclysm.
    Whatever it is, Dax Pod swoops.

    Dax Pod swoops in his one-piece umber costume, for he is Dax Pod and must swoop
    in umber to placate his fans.

    They profiled him in Gack! Readers saw Dax Pod at home, clad in umber, with umber-clad
    Mrs Dax Pod and the Dax Pod kiddies, all clad in umber too, at their farmhouse,
    with their pigs.

    The pigs were snorting, wallowing in muck, filthy, filthy, filthy, and cloven
    of hoof.'
