  text: "The chief characteristic of a tub-thumper is a mania for thumping tubs. What\
    \ this means, irrespective of the tub-thumper's particular preoccupation, is that\
    \ they must have within handy reach a thumpable tub.\nOne might be deluded into\
    \ thinking that any old tub can be thumped once it has been up-ended, so that\
    \ the base of the tub is uppermost, and it rests upon its top, which may or may\
    \ not still have its lid attached. This fancy, for a fancy it is, is quite wrong,\
    \ for reasons which I hope to demonstrate. I say \u201Chope to\u201D, because\
    \ I fear my attempt may bite the dust, distracted as I am by the presence, directly\
    \ outside my window, of a tub-thumper who is thumping his tub with such vigour\
    \ that birds have scattered from their perches and the very earth is trembling!\n\
    You will note that I ended that last sentence with an exclamation point. I did\
    \ so to drive home, in the only way I know how, the sheer volume of the din being\
    \ thumped by the proximate tub-thumper. His tub is an empty tub, giving his thumping\
    \ noises a hollow, booming tone. It is not unlike the noise beloved of those odd\
    \ people who drive their cars through cities with the windows down, sharing their\
    \ choice of bass-heavy thumping racket with pedestrian passers-by. I have never\
    \ understood why such people wish to advertise their monumental stupidity and\
    \ lack of even a modicum of taste. Be that as it may, one can at least say of\
    \ them that they are mobile, and therefore, if one remains rooted to the spot,\
    \ like a growing carrot or parsnip, the volume of their thumpings fades away soon\
    \ enough.\nThe same cannot be said of the tub-thumper outside my window, who is\
    \ not inside a moving car, but encamped, next to some placards, on the path. Thump\
    \ thump thump, he thumps, thumping his tub, and at the same time he is shouting.\
    \ I am not sure what he is shouting about, but at a guess he will have taken as\
    \ his subject either Jesus or Mohammed or carbon footprints. Currently these are\
    \ the favoured topics of tub-thumpers. Go back twenty years and you will find\
    \ something else compelling their attention, although the thumping of the tub\
    \ itself will be identical.\nBoffins at a research lab have tried to show a correlation\
    \ between tub-thumping and teenagedom, where the teenagedom can be either chronological\u2014\
    the thumper actually is a teenager\u2014or mental, where the thumper is long past\
    \ teenagedom but still has teen-associated cerebral characteristics. This lapse\
    \ of the brain is often occasioned by a deep interest in people and places far,\
    \ far away, of which the thumper is ignorant in the profoundest sense.\nAs with\
    \ the thumper outside my window who is making this piece such a trial to write,\
    \ the thumped tub is often accompanied by a brandished placard. The best placards\
    \ are those which are misspelled, ungrammatical, or incoherent. \u201CBehead those\
    \ who insult the Prophet\u201D is a delightful example of the latter type, where\
    \ the perceived insult is the assertion that Mohammed was a violent maniac fond\
    \ of, er, beheading people.\nSpeaking of Mohammed, it is not true that in order\
    \ to be an effective tub-thumper one must have a beard and wear a pair of sandals.\
    \ In the past, at a time when, say, vegetarianism rather than carbon footprints\
    \ was among the thumpers\u2019 chart-toppers, beards and sandals were commoner\
    \ than they are today. Fashions change, but thumping carries on, unstoppable.\n\
    It is apparently unstoppable outside my window. Much as I would like to give you\
    \ a thorough taxonomy of tubs thumped, I am afraid I am at the end of my tether.\
    \ And tethers, their lengths and limits, are a different subject altogether, one\
    \ to which I shall turn when I have sprawled on a pallet in a darkling chamber,\
    \ plugs inserted in my ears and a damp cloth covering my eyes."
