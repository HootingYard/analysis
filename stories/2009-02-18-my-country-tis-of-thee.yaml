  text: "The flag is black and white, symbolising the whiteness of snow and the darkness\
    \ of Arctic areas.\_\n\nThe Defence Minister is the most successful female boxer\
    \ in Finnish history. The Foreign Minister has a photo gallery on his website\
    \ which is, er, startling. The Head of State \u201Cplays songs that are usually\
    \ considered bad\u201D.\nI speak of the Kingdom of Valtio. This seems to me the\
    \ kind of place where Hooting Yard, rather than being an obscure internet blog,\
    \ would be a daily newspaper. I note that applications for citizenship are accepted\
    \ from all and sundry. I shall be applying today, and I suggest that all my readers\
    \ do likewise.\nDiscovered via Mr Eugenides.\n\_"
