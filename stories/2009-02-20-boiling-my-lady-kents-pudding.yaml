  text: 'In looking through Thaumaturgia, or Elucidations Of The Marvellous the other
    day, for that quotation about the delusional glass man, I came across this:

    We shall conclude our astrological strictures with the following advertisement,
    which affords as fine a satirical specimen of quackery as is to be met with. It
    is extracted from "poor Robin''s" almanack for 1773; and may not be without its
    use, to many at the present day. We will vouch for it being harmless, but as we
    are not in the secret of all that it contains, our readers must endeavour to get
    the information that may be wanted, on certain important points, from other quarters...

    ADVERTISEMENT.

    "The best time to cut hair. How moles and dreams are to be interpreted. When most
    proper season to bleed. Under what aspect of the moon best to draw teeth, and
    cut corns. Pairing of nails, on what day unlucky. What the kindest sign to graft
    or inoculate in; to open bee-hives, and kill swine. How many hours boiling my
    Lady Kent''s pudding requires. With other notable questions, fully and faithfully
    resolved, by me Sylvester Patridge, student in physic and astrology, near the
    Gun in Moorfields."

    "Of whom likewise may be had, at reasonable rates, trusses, antidotes, elixirs,
    love-powders. Washes for freckles, plumpers, glass-eyes, false calves and noses,
    ivory-jaws, and a new receipt to turn red hair into black."'
