  text: 'One man who knew a thing or two about boiling My Lady Kent''s pudding, apart
    from Sylvester Patridge, was Blodgett. Blodgett first came upon the recipe when
    he was under the culinary tutelage of the so-called Culinary King of Cuxhaven,
    Binsey Poplars. Poplars himself unearthed the pudding details during his researches
    in an archive of pudding recipes at the Texas Recipe Book Depository in Dallas,
    bang next door to the more famous--or infamous--Texas Schoolbook Depository, from
    a sixth floor window of which, on a November day in 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald shot
    President John Fitzgerald Kennedy with a mail-order Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.
    Some would add "allegedly" after that statement, but not me. I have read my Posner.

    Nobody, so far as we know, ever shot anyone from a window of the Recipe Book Depository,
    not even Binsey Poplars, who, when he was not rummaging through old recipe books,
    could himself be impelled to acts of senseless violence. He once broke Blodgett''s
    legs, for example, quite deliberately, with blows from a tent peg mallet. Poplars
    called this mallet his Hammer of Pedagogy, which was something of a misnomer,
    as he also used it to crack eggs, to bash out dents in his pans, and to hammer
    tent pegs into campsite mud. He was fond of taking his students on camping trips
    to the outskirts of Cuxhaven, and having them forage or starve.

    It was on one such escapade, when Blodgett was still on crutches, that teacher
    and student fell into a lengthy conversation about puddings. The Culinary King
    had only recently returned from his Texas trip, and his head was full of the recipes
    he had discovered in the pudding archive. The countryside around Cuxhaven was
    at the mercy of roaring winds that weekend, and Poplars and his students were
    huddled in their tents. It was not foraging weather. The pedagogue made a point
    of sharing his tent with any student whose bones he had broken in a fit of temper,
    and so it was Blodgett on this occasion who sprawled at his master''s feet. As
    far as puddings went, Blodgett knew almost as much as Binsey Poplars. He had immersed
    himself in the world of puddings since infancy, and it was this enthusiasm that
    had led him to sign up to the Culinary King''s Crash Course in the first place.
    For though Blodgett could tell you about thousands of different puddings, he had
    no idea how to make a single one of them.

    In the tent, as gales howled and canvas flapped, Poplars and Blodgett talked about
    puddings for hours.

    "Of course," said Binsey Poplars pompously, "Sylvester Patridge claimed to know
    the correct boiling time for My Lady Kent''s pudding, but the man was a charlatan
    and a fool, and if you boiled it for the time he recommended you would end up
    with a pretty sorry excuse for a pudding".

    "Tell me more," said Blodgett, all ears, because here was a pudding that, remarkably,
    he had never heard of. And as his tutor prattled on, Blodgett scraped shorthand
    notes on to one of his crutches with a sharpened twig.

    Years later, far from Cuxhaven, restored in limb, and now a dab hand at cooking
    the puddings he had once merely salivated over, Blodgett stumbled upon his old
    crutch and deciphered the scrapings he had made upon it. He transcribed them into
    a notebook, embellished them, and published them as part of Blodgett''s Book Of
    Many Puddings, a copy of which, fittingly, was acquired by the trustees of the
    pudding archive at the Texas Recipe Book Depository on Elm Street in Dallas, just
    along from the overpass on the Stemmons Freeway.

    A fantastic challenge for any maker of boiled puddings, he wrote, is the pudding
    named after My Lady Kent. Should it be steamed before boiling, or afterwards?
    Should it indeed be steamed at all, or should one just get on and boil it? What
    is the best type of pan in which to chuck the pudding ingredients prior to boiling?
    Does the pan matter? If the pan is dented, should one bash out the dents with
    the Hammer of Pedagogy beforehand? If one neglects to do so, will any indentations
    in the finished pudding caused by the dents add to its savour, or will they detract
    from it? Is there a place, in the contemporary world, for dented puddings, or
    should we be aiming for clean lines and smooth edges? Can a modern version of
    My Lady Kent''s pudding compete with the original? Should we allow indentations
    irrespective of their effect simply because, in all likelihood, given the rough
    and tumble of the times, My Lady Kent''s own pans would have been outrageously
    dented? Rare was the pan in those days that did not get bashed about and suffer
    because of that bashing. That may be one reason for the popularity of puddings,
    for there are cogent arguments claiming that the final shape of a pudding, particularly
    a boiled pudding, matters not a jot to the eater of the pudding. Are there any
    cases we can advert to where a pudding has been sent back from table with the
    complaint "I cannot eat this pudding. It is dented."? Such reservations are likely
    with other things one might eat. A duck of the wrong shape, likewise a pig''s
    head or a pie full of misshapen blackbirds, will cause revulsion, for the eater
    may think, rightly, that they are being fobbed off with abominations of nature.
    But there is no such thing as the correct shape of a pudding, not even of My Lady
    Kent''s pudding. And yet to make one that is succulent and lip-smacking remains
    a challenge, and takes years of study, sometimes in a tent, on the outskirts of
    Cuxhaven, while canvas is buffeted and fierce winds blow.

    It does not escape the reader''s notice that Blodgett fails to answer many of
    the questions he--or Binsey Poplars before him--raises, and nor does he provide
    a workable recipe for the pudding he so enthuses about. That is Blodgett all over,
    of course, infuriating and exasperating yet strangely adorable for all that.

    Incidentally, it is said that the dressmaker Abraham Zapruder, who filmed the
    famous footage of the Kennedy assassination on his top-of-the-range Model 414
    PD 8 mm Bell & Howell Zoomatic Director Series movie camera, was planning to spend
    the afternoon, following the passing of the presidential motorcade, in the Texas
    Recipe Book Depository, specifically to consult Blodgett''s book. Whether he was
    intending to boil My Lady Kent''s pudding, and was looking for helpful hints,
    we do not know, and now we never will, for history took a fateful turn on that
    sunny day in Dallas, and the dressmaker''s boiled pudding thoughts were wiped
    clean from his brain. But not from yours, or mine.'
