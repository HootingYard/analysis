  text: 'I know I shouldn''t allow such twaddle to exasperate me so much. I know it
    is a sign of weakness, even of imminent mental collapse, when one feels compelled
    to post a comment at the Guardian. But alas, I couldn''t help myself. To discover
    the cause of my intemperance, go and read this. If you can''t bear to wade through
    all the comments, mine is here. (It will be distressingly familiar stuff to Hooting
    Yard readers, of course.)

    Now I am going to apply a cold compress to my forehead, and throw pebbles at swans.'
