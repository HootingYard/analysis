  text: 'Every now and then I receive letters from readers asking me to give some
    account of the geography of Hooting Yard and its hinterland. I have a standard
    reply to such requests, which is to say that through diligent study of the writings
    you could draw a map yourself. It would involve very close reading, being on the
    alert for clues and pointers, but all the information any half-competent cartographer
    needs is present in the texts.

    Today, I am going to make things a little easier for aspiring mappers by saying
    a few words about the train journey from Hooting Yard to that ill-starred fishing
    village O''Houlihan''s Wharf. Last week it would have been fairly pointless to
    do so, but the exciting news is that the branch line, long fallen into desuetude,
    is running again. Using the proceeds from a winning raffle ticket (number 666,
    beige) a team of volunteers has reopened the line as a cross between a "countryside
    heritage family leisure facility" and a "cutting-edge arts praxis installation".
    I have taken those two phrases from their brochure, a shabby piece of work duplicated
    on a Gestetner machine, designed perhaps to look like one of Dobson''s out of
    print pamphlets. Someone has gone to the trouble of hand-colouring all the covers,
    though, which shows the fanatical devotion of these enthusiasts.


    I am not one of these nutters myself, but I know the journey as well as I know
    the first three books of Paradise Lost, so take my hand, encased in a butcher''s
    mitten, and I shall lead you along the way.


    Our thrilling railway excursion begins, naturally enough, at Hooting Yard. What
    was once a gigantic terminus alive with hubbub is now a ruin which serves mostly
    as a roost for sparrows. However, the volunteers have recreated a very convincing
    facsimile of one of the original platforms, and it is from here that the decrepit
    steam engine creaks into gear.


    It is, of course, the Civic Platform. It had been hoped to place a commemorative
    copy of the Central Lever at one end, but Hazel Blears put the kibosh on that
    with a series of threatening letters. Diminutive and bumptious she may be, but
    she--or her officials--can certainly write poisonous prose. The branch line volunteer
    who opens the post has been admitted to a clinic for neurasthenics and has taken
    to wandering the grounds in a daze, like Ronald Colman at the beginning of Random
    Harvest, without the military uniform, of course, but with the pencil moustache.
    Anyway, off we go!


    The first stop, some five hours down the line on a good day, is Blister Lane.
    When I say "on a good day", I mean on a day when the train does not sputter to
    a halt about twenty yards out of Hooting Yard because the track is blocked by
    cows. This can happen distressingly often, for the fields hereabouts are teeming
    with cows, thousands of cows, and though they may be content to stand still staring
    at nothing, the likelihood is that mad Old Farmer Frack will come bellowing and
    waving his stick and drive them back and forth across the railway line for his
    own, no doubt profound, purposes. He is not a farmer who can be bribed, so if
    he is doing his thing with the cows, the train just has to wait.


    From Blister Lane we head on to Hoon. There are many who contend that Hoon is
    a place of myth, like Atlantis or Lemuria. Even if they are right--and remember,
    there is no definitive evidence either way--that is no reason Hoon cannot have
    its own railway station. The station itself shimmers, as if in mist, even on a
    clear day, and eerie sounds echo about its turrets and crenellations, for the
    station building is both turreted and crenellated, if blurry. It is not advisable
    to disembark from the train at Hoon.


    Nor is it a good idea to alight at the next stop, the Horrible Cave, unless you
    are an emboldened spelunker. Actually, there is a reasonable chance you may be
    so, for last time we did a readership survey it turned out that almost three-quarters
    of Hooting Yard readers have survived terrifying imperilment in caves, though
    not of course in the Horrible Cave itself. And it has to be said that the Horrible
    Cave is so horrible that it makes every other cave in any given subterranean system
    seem like a Prudence Foxglove Sunday School. The branch line volunteers refused
    to place any health and safety notices at the stations, even here, so you will
    have to keep your wits about you and use that unfashionable tool, common sense.
    But if you are a regular reader of Hooting Yard, you will of course have plenty
    of that.


    And so we steam on, still creaking, to the Macabre Village. Please note that this
    is not the Macabre Yet Goofy Village you may have read about in the works of Jean-Claude
    Unanugu, nor the same writer''s Goofy But Macabre Village. Those are fictional.
    This is just a macabre village, with no goofiness to be found, however hard you
    might search. If you jump off the train here, try not to go too close to any of
    the buildings, and take a torch with you, the more powerful the better. In fact,
    take a torch and a bag of pebbles. You can throw the pebbles at anything macabre
    that looms out of the shadows intent upon attacking you.


    Anybody with any sense will have stayed on the train, and be rewarded by arriving
    some hours later at The Ponds. This used to be a popular destination for picnicking
    parties, particularly the pond known as Stagnant Inky-Black Fathomless Spooky
    Pond, where generations of tinies cavorted and capered. Some of them even made
    it home alive.


    From The Ponds it is a short hop to Pang Hill, where the famous Orphanage graveyard
    is well worth a visit. Take a cotton napkin to mop up your tears. Various mawkish
    pamphlets are available from the graveyard gift shop, including some insufferably
    dreary collections of verse by Dennis Beerpint, penned (as he would say) before
    his reinvention as a twenty-first century beatnik. On that point, it appears that
    our cherished poetaster has disavowed his earlier work. He issued some kind of
    manifesto the other day declaring that he intends to rewrite each and every one
    of his pre-beatnik poems in the beatnik style. Whether or not that is something
    to look forward to I am not sure. It might be a good idea to snap up as many of
    his twee verses as you can while you are at Pang Hill, if you can cease sobbing
    and do a Winslety gather.


    The next stop is Pointy Town. The station is, of course, magnificent, and very
    pointy. Indeed, it is thought to be the pointiest railway station on the planet.
    Before reopening the branch line, the volunteers made a special effort to eradicate
    any blunt bits on the station concourse, using a sort of antisandpaper, supplies
    of which they found untouched in a basement storeroom of Hubermann''s, the gorgeous
    department store.


    And so, finally, to the benighted fishing village itself, O''Houlihan''s Wharf.
    For obvious reasons, the timetables are less than accurate, but you should arrive
    within two or three weeks of setting out from Hooting Yard. You will be exhausted,
    and your head will be enveloped in steam, but you will I hope experience a Lovecraftian
    shudder as you step on to the platform, with the sudden, hideous realisation that
    there is no way back, and you must spend the rest of your days trudging up and
    down the rotting jetty, befouled seawater sloshing against your boots, and squalls
    blowing in from the west.
