  text: 'The other day I very belatedly installed a programme that provides statistics
    on this site, telling me how many visitors have alighted here, which posts they
    have looked at, and so on. The most amusing feature is of course the list of search
    terms, typed into Google or some other engine, which have brought the innocent
    and unwitting to the big iron gates of Hooting Yard. I am preparing a post on
    this topic, which should appear in the next few weeks.

    Meanwhile, however, I was startled by one item in today''s list of "search terms
    people used to find your blog". It is this:

    is frank key will self? hooting yard

    Well, to whomsoever typed that, the answer is a resounding: No, of course not.

    Although I would like to add that towards the fag end of last year, I went to
    see an art installation called Seizure. It was located in a derelict and abandoned
    housing estate in southeast London and, because it had gained rather a lot of
    publicity, I thought it would be a good idea to arrive early to avoid being at
    the end of a long and straggly queue. On the morning of my visit, however, the
    rain was teeming down and Pansy Cradledew and I were only the second people to
    arrive. Ahead of us was a family group, and I recognised among them the tall lugubrious
    figure of Will Self. Shortly thereafter, I discovered that my cigarette lighter
    was kaput. So I asked Mr Self for a light. In the downpour, he twice tried unsuccessfully
    to light my cigarette, grumbled miserably about lighting his own cigarette first
    and, having done so, proceeded to light mine. I said thank you, and he carried
    on moaning to his family about the rain. So, although I am not Will Self, he did
    light my cigarette in a downpour.'
