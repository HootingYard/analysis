  text: 'In one corner of the room a huge church bell lies on its side. It is battered
    and dented but its clapper remains intact.

    Next to the bell is a crate of toads. The toads have been counted, and re-counted,
    at least three times, by the toad counting person, whose coat and cap are hung
    on a hook on the back wall between the bell and the crate. The toad counting person
    himself is no longer present. We are to understand, later, that he has been called
    away to an urgent toad count elsewhere, one for which he is permitted to dispense
    with his coat and cap, hence their presence on the hook. The toads have all been
    injected with a narcotic drug. They are still. Some of them are toxic toads, but
    it is not immediately apparent which ones, and this will prove significant, later
    on.

    Alongside the crate of toads is an occasional table on which has been placed a
    fiendishly embroidered tablecloth. It is a bit tatty around the edges, which overhang
    the table almost to the floor. The tattiness, we will learn, is the result of
    it having been gnawed by wild beasts. Arrayed atop the table, upon the cloth,
    are a whisk and a jar of unidentified paste and a Bible and a squirting utensil
    moulded from bright plastic. Later, we will learn that an accompanying funnel
    has been stolen from this tabletop arrangement, by person or persons unknown,
    as the legal parlance has it. Detectives will become involved.

    Then there is a gap. There is a trapdoor in the gap, but it has been secured with
    fastening pins to prevent accidents.

    Beyond the gap is a sofa, plumply upholstered. BAXTER is reclining on the sofa,
    wearing a cardigan and slacks and plimsolls. He is smoking a pipe, and, between
    puffs, is whistling Oh Danny Boy. He is an inexpert whistler, and the sound he
    makes is grating upon the ears. His hair is absolutely caked with brilliantine.

    Behind the sofa looms a piece of classical statuary. It is a representation of
    a generic Greek or Roman God. Later, there will be a brouhaha over the identity
    of the God, which will remain unresolved, even after blood has been shed and a
    terrible vendetta sparked. The head of the God is out of proportion to the body,
    and the legs are ill-made and of a Wordsworthian lack of ornament, although they
    are for the most part hidden by the sofa.

    Past the sofa there is another toad, this time solo and uncrated, although like
    the other toads it has been anaesthetised and is still. This toad may have escaped
    the earlier toad counting, and it may be toxic. Or the converse may be the case,
    on both counts, that is, the counting and the toxicity. The toad may have been
    counted, and it may be a non-toxic toad. BAXTER will be compelled to address these
    issues later, leading to the irretrievable loss of his wits.

    Finally, at the opposite end from the battered and dented bell, there is an iron
    spigot. By dint of a faulty washer it is leaking, and drops of water are falling
    into a pan placed at its foot. It is quite a big pan, tin, and pristine, as if
    it has come directly from the manufacturer''s production line. Lights are cleverly
    directed to shine upon it, making it gleam brightly, almost as brightly as the
    sun.

    Enter, stage right, THE ANTI-BAXTER

    These are the opening stage directions for Istvan Scrimgeour''s drawing-room tragicomedy
    The Bell And The Toads, Etcetera. Its 1951 production at the Festival of Britain
    closed twenty minutes in to Act I. It has never been revived.'
