  text: "Yesterday, V I Foxglove mentioned a ruffian from Klosterheim, or The Masque,\
    \ and I notice that the day before, over at Laudator Temporis Acti, Michael Gilleland\
    \ posted a marvellous bit of De Quincey:\n\u201CTo begin with his figure:\u2014\
    \ Wordsworth was, upon the whole, not a well-made man. His legs were pointedly\
    \ condemned by all the female connoisseurs in legs that ever I heard lecture upon\
    \ that topic; not that they were bad in any way which would force itself upon\
    \ your notice \u2014 there was no absolute deformity about them; and undoubtedly\
    \ they had been serviceable legs beyond the average standard of human requisition;\
    \ for I calculate, upon good data, that with these identical legs Wordsworth must\
    \ have traversed a distance of 175 to 180,000 English miles \u2014 a mode of exertion\
    \ which, to him, stood in the stead of wine, spirits, and all other stimulants\
    \ whatsoever to the animal spirits; to which he has been indebted for a life of\
    \ unclouded happiness, and we for much of what is most excellent in his writings.\
    \ But, useful as they have proved themselves, the Wordsworthian legs were certainly\
    \ not ornamental; and it was really a pity, as I agreed with a lady in thinking,\
    \ that he had not another pair for evening dress parties \u2014 when no boots\
    \ lend their friendly aid to masque our imperfections from the eyes of female\
    \ rigorists \u2014 the elegantes formarum spectatrices. A sculptor would certainly\
    \ have disapproved of their contour.\u201D\nFrom Literary Reminiscences, chapter\
    \ X (William Wordsworth)\nDe Quincey seems to think that the wearing of boots\
    \ can pull the wool over the eyes of female rigorists, but this was certainly\
    \ not the case with Marigold Chew. Indeed, it was the boots Dobson trudged around\
    \ in that often caused her acute, even physical, disgust. The out of print pamphleteer\
    \ had a huge and unlikely collection of boots, including those of the Austrian\
    \ Postal Service and the Nova Scotian Seabird Tagging Patrol. Unlike John Prescott,\
    \ he usually managed to pair them up correctly.*\n* NOTE\_: In his forthcoming\
    \ mem-wa A View From The Foothills, Chris Mullin MP writes: \u201C[Prescott's]\
    \ black mood is compounded by the fact that he has come to work this morning wearing\
    \ unmatching shoes. We are permitted a brief giggle at this. Towards the end of\
    \ the meeting a minion appears with a plastic bag containing an assortment of\
    \ shoes.\u201D"
