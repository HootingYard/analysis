  text: 'Last week, Mrs Gubbins suffered some sort of mental collapse and called in
    a team of consultants to overhaul the Hooting Yard "brand image". The octogenarian
    crone put aside her knitting and got it into her head that what was needed was
    a brand new logo. "It has to be punchy and zippy and bangy and crashy," she drivelled,
    adding that she wanted something that a half-blind orphan child could reproduce
    with a crumbling crayon. I have no idea how much the consultants charged for their
    work, but knowing these charlatans it was probably thousands and thousands of
    pounds. When the invoice turns up I shall cast it into a waste disposal chute.
    Anyway, here is the new logo, based I am told on an illustration from an alchemical
    treatise of long, long ago.
