  text: "Last week, Mrs Gubbins suffered some sort of mental collapse and called in\
    \ a team of consultants to overhaul the Hooting Yard \u201Cbrand image\u201D.\
    \ The octogenarian crone put aside her knitting and got it into her head that\
    \ what was needed was a brand new logo. \u201CIt has to be punchy and zippy and\
    \ bangy and crashy,\u201D she drivelled, adding that she wanted something that\
    \ a half-blind orphan child could reproduce with a crumbling crayon. I have no\
    \ idea how much the consultants charged for their work, but knowing these charlatans\
    \ it was probably thousands and thousands of pounds. When the invoice turns up\
    \ I shall cast it into a waste disposal chute. Anyway, here is the new logo, based\
    \ I am told on an illustration from an alchemical treatise of long, long ago.\n\
