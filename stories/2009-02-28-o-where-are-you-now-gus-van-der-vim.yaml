  text: "I sat bolt upright in bed in the middle of the night and realised that I\
    \ am dissatisfied with the word \"post\" to describe an individual blog entry.\
    \ Henceforth, at Hooting Yard, what was once a \"post\" will be known as a \"\
    postage\". That, by way of preamble to this:\nIn a comment on yesterday's Gubbinsy\
    \ postage, Georgy Riecke wrote: Punchy, Zippy, Bangy, Crashy--aren't they the\
    \ names of characters from the infamous Belgian kid's TV show 'War Zone'? A mean-spirited\
    \ bunch, make no bones about it, but they're embarrassingly photogenic and would\
    \ sell a corpse for a bride if you paid them in jellybeans. Mr Riecke is almost,\
    \ but not quite, correct. Punchy & co are indeed characters from a Belgian television\
    \ programme, ostensibly designed for children, but it is not called \"War Zone\"\
    \ and they are not mean-spirited. The adjective that best suits these characters\
    \ is, I think, \"bewildering\".\nPunchy is an intricately-constructed puppet of\
    \ wire and cardboard and straw and sandpaper and tin foil and rubber bands. Zippy\
    \ is a tea strainer the handle of which has been punched through the top of a\
    \ bag of icing sugar. Bangy is a rag. Not a rag doll, merely a rag, and a singularly\
    \ grubby one at that. Crashy is a piece of special effects digital wizardry and\
    \ takes one's breath away, if one is the sort of person to have one's breath taken\
    \ away by special effects digital wizardry. Not all of us are. Some of us are\
    \ more likely to be breathtaken by, oh, I don't know, the unbridled energy of\
    \ Boswell's London Journal, or, in a different register, the sixteen Revelations\
    \ Of Divine Love by Julian of Norwich.\nCertainly Julian's classic text inspired\
    \ Gus Van Der Vim, the creator of Punchy and Zippy and Bangy and Crashy. In fact\
    \ the entire series of shows, screened between 1972 and 1976, is a thickly-disguised\
    \ adaptation of the first Revelation, the one with the hazelnut. Although none\
    \ of our bewildering quartet resembles a squirrel visually, there is something\
    \ of the squirrel in the personality of Punchy, if a puppet can be said to have\
    \ a personality as such. Perhaps what it has is, rather, a puppetality. That being\
    \ so, it allowed Van Der Vim to express his frankly hysterical response to the\
    \ First Divine Revelation in the form of a weird, knockabout, psychedelic, baffling,\
    \ and occasionally creepy children's television programme, in which pursuit of\
    \ a hazelnut is the starting point of each show.\nThe fact that the programme\
    \ was cancelled by Belgian television executives in 1976 has led many soi disant\
    \ cultural commentators to argue that it was a victim of punk's Year Zero. Jon\
    \ Savage and others, who have forged careers based on their real or counterfeit\
    \ presence at early Sex Pistols gigs, like to claim that Gus Van Der Vim was ousted\
    \ from Flemish children's television because he had long hair and wore Lennonite\
    \ granny glasses. The truth, as ever, is more mundane, but what it is, that shining\
    \ truth, is clouded in the mystical mists of which Julian of Norwich gave us such\
    \ a majestic account, an account which gives due prominence, in the First Revelation\
    \ at least, to the hazelnut.\n "
