  text: 'Between the Gubbinses and the Bevellings there has been, since time immemorial,
    a blood feud. But only just. In English law, time immemorial is defined as any
    date before the third of September 1189, and the incident which prompted the blood
    feud happened on the evening of the second of September in that tempestuous year.
    It was, we are told, an altercation, next to a pond, and involved a Gubbins, a
    Bevelling, and a cormorant, or possibly two cormorants. Blood was shed, but to
    this day arguments persist about whether the blood was that of the Gubbins or
    of the Bevelling, or both, or of the cormorant, or cormorants.

    Nigh on a thousand years is not a particularly long time for a properly constituted
    vendetta. By definition, intergenerational hatred and vengeance takes many generations
    to take root. By some accounts, it was only in the fourteenth century that members
    of both the Gubbins and Bevelling clans first spoke of their enmity in terms of
    a blood feud. Before then, it was seen as a bit of a spat, or whatever word people
    of those distant times used for a spat. By then, of course, cormorants were no
    longer the casus belli. It was simply that, if you were born a Gubbins, you hated
    the Bevellings, and vice versa.

    Any members of Bournemouth Council who are reading this piece, and are offended
    by my use of Latin in the last two sentences, can go and boil their own heads.

    The boiling of heads, incidentally, was a favoured tactic of both parties in the
    blood feud, as was the slicing off of limbs, the evisceration of infants, and
    the impalement upon iron spikes of any Gubbins wandering absent-mindedly into
    Bevelling territory, or, again, vice versa. Those were gore-splattered times to
    be sure.

    Indeed, so blood-drenched had the feud become by the sixteenth century that certain
    figures in both clans, of a modernist and civilizing cast of mind, decided to
    strike a pact. Such an initiative was unpopular with the mass of their clansfolk,
    for whom the feud was a mere fact of nature, like a beating heart or a hooting
    owl or a drooling pauper. But the modernisers dismissed their protests, as modernisers
    always do, from that day to this, in all walks of life, and proceeded to sneak
    about in the gloom, working away to seal the pact.

    Now at this time, the Gubbinses were, like the Parkinson family in H G Wells''s
    1933 novel The Bulpington Of Blup, a sandwich-inventing clan, while the Bevellings
    were, like Theodore Bulpington''s Aunt Amanda, the life and soul of a bandage-making
    organisation in the Town Hall. I hasten to add that it was not Bournemouth Town
    Hall, which has today become a Latin-free bastion of ignorance. Actually, I am
    not sure which Town Hall it was, for both the Gubbinses and the Bevellings had
    fanned out across the land in the centuries since their vendetta began, next to
    a pond, on that September evening in 1189. The modernisers on both sides sensed
    that if they could find a commonality of purpose in the inventing of sandwiches
    and the making of bandages, they could convincingly press the case for the pact
    they dreamed of.

    But is there any demonstrable connection between sandwiches and bandages? They
    must have discovered something, because the pact was eventually struck, with a
    nod to historical resonance, on the evening of the second of September 1589.

    It met immediately with a retort, from a disgruntled Gubbins and an enraged Bevelling.
    The modernisers from both clans were rounded up, and bound with chains, and drowned
    in the very pond where once a cormorant, or cormorants, had sparked the vendetta
    in the first place. And ever since, the blood feud has continued and deepened
    and intensified, and it is likely that it would have overwhelmed the entire land
    by now, were it not that both the Gubbinses and the Bevellings were such insular
    clans that they were riddled with inbreeding, leading to an ever-shrinking gene
    pool, and they have almost died out, save for a few halfwit survivors, many of
    whom can be found sitting in the council chambers of our seaside resorts, dribbling.'
