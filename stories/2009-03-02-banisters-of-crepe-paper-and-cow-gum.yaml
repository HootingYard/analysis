  text: 'According to the old adage, "the best banisters are the sturdiest banisters".
    There is a great deal of wisdom in this simple phrase, as many unsteady persons
    who may otherwise have toppled to their deaths can attest. But it is a saying
    which has been wilfully ignored by trendy banistermaker Tim Snap, who is peddling
    his latest design, a banister rail made of crepe paper thickened with cow gum.
    We sent a roving Hooting Yard reporter to interview Mr Snap.

    Reporter : I am astonished to see you leaning insouciantly against your crepe
    paper and cow gum banisters, Tim, given they are all that stands between you and
    a yawning stairwell down which you could plunge to your death.

    Snap : You should add, for the benefit of your readers, that I am leaning my full
    weight against the banisters.

    Reporter : If you don''t mind me saying so, Tim, you are quite a chubby banistermaker,
    so there must be quite a bit of weight for your banisters to support.

    Snap : That is indeed so.

    Reporter : If I were to give you a shove, in a joshing sort of manner, as between
    a couple of pals, would your banister withstand the added pressure suddenly put
    upon it?

    Snap : I certainly hope so.

    Reporter : Let''s test it shall we?

    Snap : Well, before you do, please note that this new banister rail, like all
    my banisters, is primarily decorative.

    Reporter : Are you trying to wheedle your way out of my shoving test?

    Snap : Quite frankly, yes.

    Reporter : I think that tells us all we need to know.

    There is, you see, a point to those old adages, and a reason why they have survived.
    They express truths, both big and little truths. So when next you come upon a
    snaggle-toothed peasant sitting on a fence chewing a piece of straw and mumbling
    a litany of folk wisdom, do not dismiss what they say. Sometimes their sayings
    may seem to be blithering nonsense, as for example "A pig on the lane can cause
    you a sprain" or "When you see a door ajar, tug your forelock to the Master up
    at the Big House". If you reflect for long enough even upon the most ludicrous-seeming
    utterance, you will eventually bow to its wisdom. And you will be much less likely
    to fork over your cash to a pretentious git like Tim Snap who, our reporter revealed,
    was supported over that vertiginous stairwell not by his crepe paper and cow gum
    banisters, but by a system of invisible winches and pulleys. Let that be a lesson
    to you.

    You will almost certainly want to know more about cow gum. The great Tim Hunkin
    tells us this:


    and you should refer to his majestic  Rudiments Of Wisdom Encyclopaedia for much
    else besides.'
