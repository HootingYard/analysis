  text: 'The less variety there is at that meal [breakfast], the more is the danger
    from any single luxury; and there is one, known by the name of ''muffins,'' which
    has repeatedly manifested itself to be a plain and direct bounty upon suicide.
    Darwin, in his Zoonomia, reports a case where an officer, holding the rank of
    lieutenant-colonel, could not tolerate a breakfast in which this odious article
    was wanting; but, as a savage retribution invariably supervened within an hour
    or two upon this act of insane sensuality, he came to a resolution that life was
    intolerable with muffins, but still more intolerable without muffins. He would
    stand the nuisance no longer; but yet, being a just man, he would give nature
    one final chance of reforming her dyspeptic atrocities. Muffins, therefore, being
    laid at one angle of the breakfast-table, and loaded pistols at another, with
    rigid equity the Colonel awaited the result. This was naturally pretty much as
    usual: and then, the poor man, incapable of retreating from his word of honour,
    committed suicide,-having previously left a line for posterity to the effect (though
    I forget the expression), "That a muffinless world was no world for him: better
    no life at all than a life dismantled of muffins".

    Magazine (1845)
