  text: "News bulletins often try to add drama to stories by announcing, in excitable\
    \ tones, \u201CBlizzard Britain\u2014Day Four!\u201D or \u201CPigeon Crisis\u2014\
    Day Two!\u201D Once in a while, however, such an approach is justified, as it\
    \ is today, with \u201CResonance FM\u2014Day Two Thousand Five Hundred!\u201D\n\
    We should all throw our hats in the air and cheer at this achievement. Given that\
    \ on an unlikely number of those days \_the station has played host to Hooting\
    \ Yard On The Air, I ought to take this opportunity to thank the powers that be\
    \ at the benevolent dictatorship that is Resonance, as well as the many sound\
    \ engineers who have ensured my babbling is audible to the world.\nYou can thank\
    \ them too, by listening and donating and buying things from the shop."
