  text: 'News bulletins often try to add drama to stories by announcing, in excitable
    tones, "Blizzard Britain--Day Four!" or "Pigeon Crisis--Day Two!" Once in a while,
    however, such an approach is justified, as it is today, with "Resonance FM--Day
    Two Thousand Five Hundred!"

    We should all throw our hats in the air and cheer at this achievement. Given that
    on an unlikely number of those days  the station has played host to Hooting Yard
    On The Air, I ought to take this opportunity to thank the powers that be at the
    benevolent dictatorship that is Resonance, as well as the many sound engineers
    who have ensured my babbling is audible to the world.

    You can thank them too, by listening and donating and buying things from the shop.'
