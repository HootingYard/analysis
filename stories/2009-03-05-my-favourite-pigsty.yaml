  text: 'The title for this year''s Old Farmer Frack Memorial Essay has been announced.
    Entrants will be challenged to write fifty thousand words under the heading "My
    Favourite Pigsty". This follows on from previous years where there was terrific
    interest in subjects such as "My Favourite Cow Byre", "My Favourite Hen Coop",
    and "Startle the poor sheep back! is the shipwrack then a harvest, does tempest
    carry the grain for thee?"

    As usual, the rules of the contest are onerous. To commemorate Old Farmer Frack,
    essayists must use his own methods, which is to say that their fifty thousand
    words have to be either scraped on slates with a pointed stick, or done as Powerpoint
    presentations. Entrants have to assemble in a dilapidated barn in one of Old Farmer
    Frack''s fields before dawn on the designated date, and before putting stick to
    slate or fingertip to keyboard, each takes it in turn to drive the surviving cows
    down to the drainage ditch and back, bellowing all the while. The barn will be
    lit by a single Toc H lamp hanging from the rafters.

    As soon as it starts to rain, entrants can begin their essays, and must continue
    writing indefatigably save for picnic breaks. These will take place at allotted
    picnicking times, under tarpaulins, in one of the puddle-riddled fields. Contestants
    may not discuss the progress, content, general thrust, or stylistic flourishes
    of their essays during the picnics, but confine themselves to talk of how great
    Old Farmer Frack was. It is permitted to suggest he was mad, but not too forcefully.

    Judges for this year''s competition, who will also act as invigilators in the
    barn, include Wilf Self, Wilf Amis, Wilfette Winterson and Pebblehead, the bestselling
    paperbackist who has been commissioned to write the authorised biography of Old
    Farmer Frack and is a previous winner of the Memorial Essay prize. He won in the
    year the subject was "My Favourite Pebble".

    Entry is open to peasants, their friends and families. and those with whom they
    have been embroiled in rustic blood feuds reaching back for untold generations.
    The winner will be announced on the Muggletonian Little Holiday, the nineteenth
    of July.

    This year''s prize is a muffin, and a pair of loaded pistols.'
