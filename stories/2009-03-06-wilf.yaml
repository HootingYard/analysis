  text: 'Dear Frank, writes Tim Thurn, who has taken to calling himself Tim Thurn
    Of That Ilk, I assume in a desperate attempt to lend himself some gravitas, I
    was intrigued to read in your account of the Old Farmer Frack Memorial Essay Contest
    that the judges would include Wilf Self, Wilf Amis, and Wilfette Winterson. I
    have never heard of any of these people, despite being incredibly well-informed
    in all manner of subjects. Indeed, so huge is the amount of information stored
    within my brainpans that I have been compared, by idiots, to Stephen Fry, and
    by people with a modicum of sense to Roger Bacon (c.1219-1294), "Doctor Mirabilis",
    the man who, it was claimed, had read everything.

    Not wishing to doubt your word, I ran the names past my uncle, whose name also
    happens to be Wilf. He looked at me witheringly and, with barely a pause, accused
    you of having invented your Wilfs, and Wilfette, out of whole cloth. "These people
    do not exist," were his exact words, and I believe him, for he has made a point,
    during his long life, of keeping tabs on all the Wilfs and Wilfettes who have
    ever existed. Some may think it a foolish hobby, and it probably is, but that''s
    my Uncle Wilf for you.

    Anyway, his pronouncement set me thinking. Why, I asked myself, would Key go to
    the trouble of making up a couple of Wilfs and a Wilfette when he must have known
    that he would be exposed as a fraudster and scoundrel as soon as anyone took the
    trouble to check? I must admit that for quite some time I was stumped. I just
    sat there, chewing the end of a pencil, risking lead poisoning, beflummoxed. But
    soon enough it was time for Uncle Wilf''s daily outing, and I pushed him in his
    super whizzo wheelchair a few times around the pond, the pond next to the cement
    facsimile of the Old Tower of Lobenicht. You will recall that as the tower which
    Immanuel (not Wilf) Kant liked to look at through his window as he sat by the
    stove in circumstances of twilight and quiet reverie, not that he could be said
    properly to see it. Perhaps something of Kant''s cerebral magnificence imbued
    my own brain, in spite of the cement copy being a poor substitute for the real
    tower, for in a flash of insight I realised what it was you were up to.

    My theory, which I am going to write up into an essay and have published in some
    obscure and unread academic journal, Wilf willing, is that you were dropping great
    clanging hints to your readers of the full names of some of those Hooting Yard
    characters whose first names we are never given. Wilf Dobson? Wilf Blodgett? Old
    Ma Wilfette Purgative? Old Farmer Wilf Frack himself? You need neither confirm
    nor deny that this is the case, Mr Key, for so sure am I of the stupendous accuracy
    of my flash of insight that I know, as well as I know the consistency of the drool
    dribbling down my Uncle Wilf''s chin, that I will be proved correct in the Harmanite
    court of public opinion, the only court that counts.

    Yours ever, Tim Thurn Of That Ilk (and his Uncle Wilf, Of That Ilk)'
