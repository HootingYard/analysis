  text: "One of the more startling works of Dobson was the text often called \u201C\
    the joke pamphlet\u201D, dubbed such because its opening lines are almost identical\
    \ to one of those gags that begins \u201CThere was an Englishman, an Irishman,\
    \ and a Scotchman\u2026\u201D It is the least-read of Dobson's pamphlets by a\
    \ long chalk. Some think this may be due to the work itself being thought a joke,\
    \ perpetrated by an anti-Dobsonist, and thus not part of the canon. Equally, it\
    \ could be argued that the very rarity of the pamphlet has led to it being neglected.\
    \ Most estimates conclude that only three copies were bashed out on Marigold Chew's\
    \ Gestetner machine in her crumbling shed.\nThe pamphlet begins thus:\nThere was\
    \ a thnetopsychist, a psychopannychist, and an annihilationist, and they were\
    \ loitering in a graveyard. The thnetopsychist held that the souls of persons\
    \ and beasts perish along with their physical bodies, and that both body and soul\
    \ are resurrected at the Last Judgement. The psychopannychist believed that the\
    \ soul sleeps in the grave, to be awoken at the End . The annihilationist, as\
    \ his name indicated, said that there was no resurrection at all, for either the\
    \ body or the soul.\nClearly, any sensitive reader would not be expecting Dobson\
    \ to follow this with a comic punchline. This is a serious pamphlet by a serious\
    \ pamphleteer. There follows a lengthy conversation between the trio, written\
    \ in stilted, artificial, and highly-wrought prose, which Dobson disastrously\
    \ tries to render in a variety of regional accents, choosing regions where he\
    \ had never been, and of which he knew nothing. Indeed, it may be that the pamphlet\
    \ has attracted so few readers because it is virtually unreadable.\nBut, as ever\
    \ with the out of print pamphleteer, persistence pays off. Ted Cack has gone so\
    \ far as to claim that it is Dobson's finest, bravest, most valiant work, but\
    \ he is probably just showing off.\nOne might be forgiven for thinking that the\
    \ conversation between the thnetopsychist, the psychopannychist, and the annihilationist,\
    \ which makes up the bulk of the pamphlet, consists of each arguing their case\
    \ against the other. But it swiftly becomes apparent that this is not Dobson's\
    \ purpose at all. Well, it becomes swiftly apparent once one gets to grips with\
    \ the tortured prose, but if one has to struggle it becomes slowly apparent. (In\
    \ my case, it took about seven years hard slog, sitting up all night reading by\
    \ the light of tallow candles, shivering in a blanket, to reach a vague understanding\
    \ of this mighty text.) Rather than a standard mortalist debate about the fate\
    \ of the body and soul after death, we are treated to a sequence of what can only\
    \ be called rants by the three protagonists upon familiar Dobsonian themes\u2014\
    shipping timetables, foreign boot manufacture, breathtaking ornithological ignorance,\
    \ and so on\u2014interspersed with passages in which ghouls rise from the tombs\
    \ in the graveyard and dance a sort of tarantella.\nObviously, the pamphleteer\
    \ is playing with his readers here in a quite un-Dobsonish manner. Our moorings\
    \ are loosened, and we are set adrift. We wonder, or at least I wondered, by about\
    \ page 44, if we were heading for a maelstrom, like something out of Edgar Allan\
    \ Poe. We cling on, though, trusting in Dobson to rescue us. And rescue us he\
    \ does.\nIn the final pages of the pamphlet, the dancing ghouls harry the thnetopsychist\
    \ into one of the graves, chop up the psychopannychist with their ghoul-axes,\
    \ and hoist the annihilationist up a gum tree which just happens to be growing\
    \ in a corner of the graveyard and which we have glimpsed, briefly, earlier in\
    \ the text, when one of the protagonists\u2014it is not clear which, given the\
    \ stultifying density of the prose\u2014shins up it and taps it for gum to make\
    \ a point about tapping gum from gum trees. The ghouls then do a final little\
    \ dance\u2014more a hopping about, in truth\u2014before returning to their tombs.\
    \ But of course, one tomb is newly occupied by the stricken thnetopsychist, leaving\
    \ a single ghoul with nowhere to rest. This ghoul wanders out of the graveyard,\
    \ through the grim iron gates, past the cake shop and the colonic irrigation theme\
    \ park and the butcher's and the performing pinhead person's plinth, and then\
    \ vanishes into a mist, a mist reminiscent of the one that swallows up Arthur\
    \ Gordon Pym of Nantucket. The ghoul is bound we know not where, and nor does\
    \ Dobson tell us.\nIt is, in short, a tour de force, albeit one that is maddeningly\
    \ difficult to make sense of. Oddly, not one of the giants of prog rock ever adapted\
    \ it for a concept album. One can only imagine what a terrific gatefold sleeve\
    \ would have been designed for the original vinyl release, and with what vim adenoidal\
    \ youths would have carved Dobson's name into their school desks with a penknife.\
    \ Is there, one wonders, a parallel universe where such things came to be? And\
    \ is there a piece of boffinry that could take us there, away, away\u2026 away\
    \ from the sludge and gristle of our hapless hell?"
