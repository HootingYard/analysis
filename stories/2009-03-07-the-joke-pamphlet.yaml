  text: 'One of the more startling works of Dobson was the text often called "the
    joke pamphlet", dubbed such because its opening lines are almost identical to
    one of those gags that begins "There was an Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotchman..."
    It is the least-read of Dobson''s pamphlets by a long chalk. Some think this may
    be due to the work itself being thought a joke, perpetrated by an anti-Dobsonist,
    and thus not part of the canon. Equally, it could be argued that the very rarity
    of the pamphlet has led to it being neglected. Most estimates conclude that only
    three copies were bashed out on Marigold Chew''s Gestetner machine in her crumbling
    shed.

    The pamphlet begins thus:

    There was a thnetopsychist, a psychopannychist, and an annihilationist, and they
    were loitering in a graveyard. The thnetopsychist held that the souls of persons
    and beasts perish along with their physical bodies, and that both body and soul
    are resurrected at the Last Judgement. The psychopannychist believed that the
    soul sleeps in the grave, to be awoken at the End . The annihilationist, as his
    name indicated, said that there was no resurrection at all, for either the body
    or the soul.

    Clearly, any sensitive reader would not be expecting Dobson to follow this with
    a comic punchline. This is a serious pamphlet by a serious pamphleteer. There
    follows a lengthy conversation between the trio, written in stilted, artificial,
    and highly-wrought prose, which Dobson disastrously tries to render in a variety
    of regional accents, choosing regions where he had never been, and of which he
    knew nothing. Indeed, it may be that the pamphlet has attracted so few readers
    because it is virtually unreadable.

    But, as ever with the out of print pamphleteer, persistence pays off. Ted Cack
    has gone so far as to claim that it is Dobson''s finest, bravest, most valiant
    work, but he is probably just showing off.

    One might be forgiven for thinking that the conversation between the thnetopsychist,
    the psychopannychist, and the annihilationist, which makes up the bulk of the
    pamphlet, consists of each arguing their case against the other. But it swiftly
    becomes apparent that this is not Dobson''s purpose at all. Well, it becomes swiftly
    apparent once one gets to grips with the tortured prose, but if one has to struggle
    it becomes slowly apparent. (In my case, it took about seven years hard slog,
    sitting up all night reading by the light of tallow candles, shivering in a blanket,
    to reach a vague understanding of this mighty text.) Rather than a standard mortalist
    debate about the fate of the body and soul after death, we are treated to a sequence
    of what can only be called rants by the three protagonists upon familiar Dobsonian
    themes--shipping timetables, foreign boot manufacture, breathtaking ornithological
    ignorance, and so on--interspersed with passages in which ghouls rise from the
    tombs in the graveyard and dance a sort of tarantella.

    Obviously, the pamphleteer is playing with his readers here in a quite un-Dobsonish
    manner. Our moorings are loosened, and we are set adrift. We wonder, or at least
    I wondered, by about page 44, if we were heading for a maelstrom, like something
    out of Edgar Allan Poe. We cling on, though, trusting in Dobson to rescue us.
    And rescue us he does.

    In the final pages of the pamphlet, the dancing ghouls harry the thnetopsychist
    into one of the graves, chop up the psychopannychist with their ghoul-axes, and
    hoist the annihilationist up a gum tree which just happens to be growing in a
    corner of the graveyard and which we have glimpsed, briefly, earlier in the text,
    when one of the protagonists--it is not clear which, given the stultifying density
    of the prose--shins up it and taps it for gum to make a point about tapping gum
    from gum trees. The ghouls then do a final little dance--more a hopping about,
    in truth--before returning to their tombs. But of course, one tomb is newly occupied
    by the stricken thnetopsychist, leaving a single ghoul with nowhere to rest. This
    ghoul wanders out of the graveyard, through the grim iron gates, past the cake
    shop and the colonic irrigation theme park and the butcher''s and the performing
    pinhead person''s plinth, and then vanishes into a mist, a mist reminiscent of
    the one that swallows up Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. The ghoul is bound we
    know not where, and nor does Dobson tell us.

    It is, in short, a tour de force, albeit one that is maddeningly difficult to
    make sense of. Oddly, not one of the giants of prog rock ever adapted it for a
    concept album. One can only imagine what a terrific gatefold sleeve would have
    been designed for the original vinyl release, and with what vim adenoidal youths
    would have carved Dobson''s name into their school desks with a penknife. Is there,
    one wonders, a parallel universe where such things came to be? And is there a
    piece of boffinry that could take us there, away, away... away from the sludge
    and gristle of our hapless hell?'
