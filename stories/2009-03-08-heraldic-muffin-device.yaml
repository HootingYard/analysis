  text: 'Far away in the Antipodes, Glyn Webster has been pondering the terrible choice
    the lieutenant-colonel had to make between the muffins, on one side of his breakfast
    table, and the loaded pistols on the other. The result of Mr Webster''s exercising
    of his cranial integuments is this splendid heraldic device:


    I pointed out to Mr Webster that the muffins shown were unlikely to be the type
    of muffins which caused the lieutenant-colonel his dyspeptic atrocities. When
    you print out the device--and note I say "when", not "if"--you may use Tippex(tm)
    and a pencil to adjust the muffins to your preferred muffin-type should you so
    desire. But remember the religious ruling which states "uncertainty of muffin-type
    is no great sin".

    Incidentally, Mr Webster has been reading Zoonomia by Erasmus Darwin, and has
    found "many alarming stories about pistols", but not the one involving the lieutenant-colonel
    and his muffins. Was De Quincey making it up?'
