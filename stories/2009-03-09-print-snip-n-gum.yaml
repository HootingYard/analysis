  text: 'At the risk of this becoming a muffincentric website, I think it is important
    that readers are given the fruits of Glyn Webster''s tireless--if no doubt tiring--researches
    into what the OED defines as a small, flat, cake made from yeast batter and cooked
    on a hotplate, usually eaten split, toasted, and spread with butter, jam, etc.,
    esp. for breakfast or tea. Interestingly, in the dictionary''s first citation,
    from 1703, it is spelled Moofin, and in the second, from 1747, Muffing (capitalisation
    in the originals). I wonder if it is too late to beat against the tides of history
    and to reintroduce one or other of these spellings?

    Anyway, the only reason I have returned to this possibly inexhaustible topic is
    that, having apprised himself of the difference between true Moofins and what
    the rest of the world outside Britain think is a Muffing, Mr Webster has kindly
    provided these cut-out "patches" or "plug-ins" for your heraldic muffin device.
    Just print, snip, ''n'' gum!
