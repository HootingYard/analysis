  text: "At the risk of this becoming a muffincentric website, I think it is important\
    \ that readers are given the fruits of Glyn Webster's tireless\u2014if no doubt\
    \ tiring\u2014researches into what the OED defines as a small, flat, cake made\
    \ from yeast batter and cooked on a hotplate, usually eaten split, toasted, and\
    \ spread with butter, jam, etc., esp. for breakfast or tea. Interestingly, in\
    \ the dictionary's first citation, from 1703, it is spelled Moofin, and in the\
    \ second, from 1747, Muffing (capitalisation in the originals). I wonder if it\
    \ is too late to beat against the tides of history and to reintroduce one or other\
    \ of these spellings?\nAnyway, the only reason I have returned to this possibly\
    \ inexhaustible topic is that, having apprised himself of the difference between\
    \ true Moofins and what the rest of the world outside Britain think is a Muffing,\
    \ Mr Webster has kindly provided these cut-out \u201Cpatches\u201D or \u201Cplug-ins\u201D\
    \ for your heraldic muffin device. Just print, snip, \u2018n\u2019 gum!\n\n\_"
