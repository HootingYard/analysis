  text: "In a pioneering new work of social history, Dot Tint focuses her beady bluestocking\
    \ eye--through a lorgnette, we assume--upon the Festival Of Argumentative Music\
    \ At Ulm. To be precise, she examines the first occasion on which the festival\
    \ was broadcast over what used to be called the wireless, back in one of those\
    \ years in the first half of the twentieth century.\nIn an age of apples and pods,\
    \ it can be a bit of a strain for us to imagine the excitement generated by the\
    \ news that peasants in far-flung hovels would be able to listen to the goings\
    \ on live from Ulm. Dot Tint writes: \"When  it was announced that the full programme\
    \ of concerts, workshops, provocations and shouty stuff would be broadcast, there\
    \ were outbreaks of mass hysteria in the countryside. Farmhands fainted in the\
    \ fields. Hens acted weirdly in their coops. Wells were poisoned, and cows became\
    \ fractious.\"\nMany countryside wirelesses in those days were primitive pieces\
    \ of kit bolted together from odds and ends of metal and wiring and bakelite panels.\
    \ The fact that, as soon as one depressed the starter knob, they began to hiss\
    \ and crackle and emit ear-splitting shrieks made them the perfect medium for\
    \ listening to the racket from Ulm.\nThe festival that year was devised by a singularly\
    \ bad-tempered Teutonic hothead by the name of Klaus Krank. Dot Tint's pen-portrait\
    \ of him includes the fascinating note that \"even the furrows of his tempestuous\
    \ brows were themselves furrowed, deeply so, deep as the grave wherein my friend\
    \ was laid\". She does not tell us who this friend might be, not even in a footnote,\
    \ and I would have liked a footnote, given that the rest of her text is fairly\
    \ riddled with them, sometimes two or three to a page, in tiny, tiny type, so\
    \ tiny that I have had to crack the spine of my review copy to flatten it so that\
    \ I can place it on a platen and view it through the lens of a large important\
    \ industrial magnification instrument. It might be argued--it has been argued--that\
    \ I would be better off getting my eyes tested and wearing a pair of prescription\
    \ spectacles, or contact lenses, but why the hell should I? I see no reason to\
    \ be cowed by the gradual, inevitable dilapidation of my physical self, by the\
    \ relentless withering away of my senses. I shall fight that dereliction with\
    \ every atrophying fibre of my being, and, where necessary, with large important\
    \ industrial magnification instruments. Like Dot Tint's unnamed friend, I too\
    \ will one day be laid in a grave as deep as the furrows, or rather the secondary\
    \ furrows, of Klaus Krank's mighty brows, and until that time comes I shall simply\
    \ refuse, in a booming voice, to be extinguished. As the poet Dennis Beerpint\
    \ wrote, \"Do not prance winsomely into that grave / Rage, rage against the [something],\
    \ Dave\" in his verse Lines Upon The Imminent Death Of Dave, My Pet Viper.\nBeerpint\
    \ was not yet born when the Festival Of Argumentative Music At Ulm was first broadcast\
    \ on primitive wireless sets. One wonders how he might have tackled a commission\
    \ to write a threnody for it, to be set to music by one of Klaus Krank's hotchpotch\
    \ collection of composers, each outdoing the others in misanthropy and general\
    \ grumpiness. Yet theirs was a grumpiness of a very earnest, serious-minded sort,\
    \ and they wrote music to match. The lucky peasants who tuned in to the wireless\
    \ in their windswept fenland hovels were treated to such masterworks as Six Bagatelles\
    \ Upon A Windswept Fenland Hovel by Von Straubenzee, The Drainage Ditch Variations\
    \ by Ack, and Lullaby For A Cow Felled By Ergot Poisoning by Ergott.\nThe great\
    \ value of Dot Tint's book is that she makes explicit the link between the confrontational\
    \ nature of much of the music and the violent altercations between Klaus Krank\
    \ and the composers and the ticket sellers and the security patrols and the audience\
    \ and the paramedics and the wireless engineers and the dog handlers and the piano\
    \ detuners and the ratcatchers and the festival docents at Ulm. Not only that,\
    \ but she puts it in the wider context of Uruguayan political intrigues of the\
    \ time. She blithely dismisses the predictable objection that Ulm is not even\
    \ on the same continent as Uruguay in prose that glistens like a jewel. She even\
    \ appends a picture of such a jewel, in the form of a mezzotint by her brother,\
    \ the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint.\nIt is one of several such mezzotints in the\
    \ book, which also contains a small selection of photographs. The one reproduced\
    \ below purports to show Tiny Enid, Mrs Gubbins, and Old Farmer Frack listening\
    \ to the broadcast of Klaus Krank's own Festival Overture For Cello, Pots And\
    \ Pans, And Electronically Modified Corncrake, but this cannot be right, as the\
    \ three of them are known never to have occupied the same time and space upon\
    \ this or any other planet. Dot Tint confirms as much in a highly amusing Erratum\
    \ slip inserted into my copy of the book.\n\n "
