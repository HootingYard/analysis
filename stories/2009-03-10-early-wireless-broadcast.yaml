  text: 'In a pioneering new work of social history, Dot Tint focuses her beady bluestocking
    eye--through a lorgnette, we assume--upon the Festival Of Argumentative Music
    At Ulm. To be precise, she examines the first occasion on which the festival was
    broadcast over what used to be called the wireless, back in one of those years
    in the first half of the twentieth century.

    In an age of apples and pods, it can be a bit of a strain for us to imagine the
    excitement generated by the news that peasants in far-flung hovels would be able
    to listen to the goings on live from Ulm. Dot Tint writes: "When  it was announced
    that the full programme of concerts, workshops, provocations and shouty stuff
    would be broadcast, there were outbreaks of mass hysteria in the countryside.
    Farmhands fainted in the fields. Hens acted weirdly in their coops. Wells were
    poisoned, and cows became fractious."

    Many countryside wirelesses in those days were primitive pieces of kit bolted
    together from odds and ends of metal and wiring and bakelite panels. The fact
    that, as soon as one depressed the starter knob, they began to hiss and crackle
    and emit ear-splitting shrieks made them the perfect medium for listening to the
    racket from Ulm.

    The festival that year was devised by a singularly bad-tempered Teutonic hothead
    by the name of Klaus Krank. Dot Tint''s pen-portrait of him includes the fascinating
    note that "even the furrows of his tempestuous brows were themselves furrowed,
    deeply so, deep as the grave wherein my friend was laid". She does not tell us
    who this friend might be, not even in a footnote, and I would have liked a footnote,
    given that the rest of her text is fairly riddled with them, sometimes two or
    three to a page, in tiny, tiny type, so tiny that I have had to crack the spine
    of my review copy to flatten it so that I can place it on a platen and view it
    through the lens of a large important industrial magnification instrument. It
    might be argued--it has been argued--that I would be better off getting my eyes
    tested and wearing a pair of prescription spectacles, or contact lenses, but why
    the hell should I? I see no reason to be cowed by the gradual, inevitable dilapidation
    of my physical self, by the relentless withering away of my senses. I shall fight
    that dereliction with every atrophying fibre of my being, and, where necessary,
    with large important industrial magnification instruments. Like Dot Tint''s unnamed
    friend, I too will one day be laid in a grave as deep as the furrows, or rather
    the secondary furrows, of Klaus Krank''s mighty brows, and until that time comes
    I shall simply refuse, in a booming voice, to be extinguished. As the poet Dennis
    Beerpint wrote, "Do not prance winsomely into that grave / Rage, rage against
    the [something], Dave" in his verse Lines Upon The Imminent Death Of Dave, My
    Pet Viper.

    Beerpint was not yet born when the Festival Of Argumentative Music At Ulm was
    first broadcast on primitive wireless sets. One wonders how he might have tackled
    a commission to write a threnody for it, to be set to music by one of Klaus Krank''s
    hotchpotch collection of composers, each outdoing the others in misanthropy and
    general grumpiness. Yet theirs was a grumpiness of a very earnest, serious-minded
    sort, and they wrote music to match. The lucky peasants who tuned in to the wireless
    in their windswept fenland hovels were treated to such masterworks as Six Bagatelles
    Upon A Windswept Fenland Hovel by Von Straubenzee, The Drainage Ditch Variations
    by Ack, and Lullaby For A Cow Felled By Ergot Poisoning by Ergott.

    The great value of Dot Tint''s book is that she makes explicit the link between
    the confrontational nature of much of the music and the violent altercations between
    Klaus Krank and the composers and the ticket sellers and the security patrols
    and the audience and the paramedics and the wireless engineers and the dog handlers
    and the piano detuners and the ratcatchers and the festival docents at Ulm. Not
    only that, but she puts it in the wider context of Uruguayan political intrigues
    of the time. She blithely dismisses the predictable objection that Ulm is not
    even on the same continent as Uruguay in prose that glistens like a jewel. She
    even appends a picture of such a jewel, in the form of a mezzotint by her brother,
    the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint.

    It is one of several such mezzotints in the book, which also contains a small
    selection of photographs. The one reproduced below purports to show Tiny Enid,
    Mrs Gubbins, and Old Farmer Frack listening to the broadcast of Klaus Krank''s
    own Festival Overture For Cello, Pots And Pans, And Electronically Modified Corncrake,
    but this cannot be right, as the three of them are known never to have occupied
    the same time and space upon this or any other planet. Dot Tint confirms as much
    in a highly amusing Erratum slip inserted into my copy of the book.
