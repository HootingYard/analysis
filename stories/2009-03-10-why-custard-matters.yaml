  text: "The Heresiarch laments: \u201CThe depressing thing is that, increasingly,\
    \ custard is all we have left.\u201D\nBut remember the wise words of Ned Ward\
    \ (1667\u20131731) in British Wonders; Or, A Poetical Description of the Several\
    \ Prodigies and Most Remarkable Accidents That have happen'd in Britain since\
    \ the Death of Queen Anne (1717):\n\u201CCustard, that noble cooling Food,/ So\
    \ toothsome, wholsome, and so good, / That Dainty so approv'd of old, / Whose\
    \ yellow surface shines like Gold.\u201D\nYou can find a longer extract from the\
    \ poem, including some terrific lines about pudding, at BabelStone."
