  text: 'The Heresiarch laments: "The depressing thing is that, increasingly, custard
    is all we have left."

    But remember the wise words of Ned Ward (1667-1731) in British Wonders; Or, A
    Poetical Description of the Several Prodigies and Most Remarkable Accidents That
    have happen''d in Britain since the Death of Queen Anne (1717):

    "Custard, that noble cooling Food,/ So toothsome, wholsome, and so good, / That
    Dainty so approv''d of old, / Whose yellow surface shines like Gold."

    You can find a longer extract from the poem, including some terrific lines about
    pudding, at BabelStone.'
