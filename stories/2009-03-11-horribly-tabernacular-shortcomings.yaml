  text: '"It happens that here and there a word, or some peculiarity in using a word,
    indicates, in this author, a Scotchman;... the word shortcomings, which, being
    horribly tabernacular, and such that no gentleman could allow himself to touch
    it without gloves, it is to be wished that our Scottish brethren would resign,
    together with backslidings, to the use of field-preachers."

    Thomas De Quincey, "Protestantism", Tait''s Edinburgh Magazine, 1847

    Incidentally, Lodowicke Muggleton had a pathological hatred of Scotchmen, who
    often found themselves on the receiving end of Muggletonian curses.'
