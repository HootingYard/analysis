  text: "\u201CIt happens that here and there a word, or some peculiarity in using\
    \ a word, indicates, in this author, a Scotchman;\u2026 the word shortcomings,\
    \ which, being horribly tabernacular, and such that no gentleman could allow himself\
    \ to touch it without gloves, it is to be wished that our Scottish brethren would\
    \ resign, together with backslidings, to the use of field-preachers.\u201D\nThomas\
    \ De Quincey, \u201CProtestantism\u201D, Tait's Edinburgh Magazine,\_1847\nIncidentally,\
    \ Lodowicke Muggleton had a pathological hatred of Scotchmen, who often found\
    \ themselves on the receiving end of Muggletonian curses.\_"
