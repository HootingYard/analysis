  text: "Those of you who enjoyed listening to Norm Sherman's reading of \"Far, Far\
    \ Away\" will be pleased to hear that this week's featured story on his Drabblecast\
    \ podcast is \"Boiled Black Broth And Cornets\". Once again, his approach to the\
    \ telling of the tale is wildly at variance with my own*. Actually, I haven't\
    \ yet read this piece on the radio, but when I do, it will sound completely different.\
    \ I am very fond of Norm's treatment, he somehow makes my words much spookier\
    \ than I thought they were.\nIn the preamble, Norm mentions that he has just bought\
    \ a copy of Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude & Pippy Bags. He's obviously a very\
    \ sensible man. If you haven't yet purchased your own copy, do so now. \n* UPDATE\
    \ : In a comment on the Drabblecast discussion forum, listener \"tbaker2500\"\
    \ concurs: \"Whilst listening to the story, I also heard in my head how Frank\
    \ would read it. Two entirely different beasts. Frank always sounds so indifferent,\
    \ Norm so earnest. \" Hmm... \"indifferent\"? An interesting choice of word. I\
    \ think it may be the mot juste."
