  text: 'Those of you who enjoyed listening to Norm Sherman''s reading of "Far, Far
    Away" will be pleased to hear that this week''s featured story on his Drabblecast
    podcast is "Boiled Black Broth And Cornets". Once again, his approach to the telling
    of the tale is wildly at variance with my own*. Actually, I haven''t yet read
    this piece on the radio, but when I do, it will sound completely different. I
    am very fond of Norm''s treatment, he somehow makes my words much spookier than
    I thought they were.

    In the preamble, Norm mentions that he has just bought a copy of Gravitas, Punctilio,
    Rectitude & Pippy Bags. He''s obviously a very sensible man. If you haven''t yet
    purchased your own copy, do so now.

    * UPDATE : In a comment on the Drabblecast discussion forum, listener "tbaker2500"
    concurs: "Whilst listening to the story, I also heard in my head how Frank would
    read it. Two entirely different beasts. Frank always sounds so indifferent, Norm
    so earnest. " Hmm... "indifferent"? An interesting choice of word. I think it
    may be the mot juste.'
