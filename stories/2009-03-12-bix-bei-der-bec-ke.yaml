  text: "Those of you who enjoyed listening to Norm Sherman's reading of \u201CFar,\
    \ Far Away\u201D will be pleased to hear that this week's featured story on his\
    \ Drabblecast podcast is \u201CBoiled Black Broth And Cornets\u201D. Once again,\
    \ his approach to the telling of the tale is wildly at variance with my own*.\
    \ Actually, I haven't yet read this piece on the radio, but when I do, it will\
    \ sound completely different. I am very fond of Norm's treatment, he somehow makes\
    \ my words much spookier than I thought they were.\nIn the preamble, Norm mentions\
    \ that he has just bought a copy of Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude & Pippy Bags.\
    \ He's obviously a very sensible man. If you haven't yet purchased your own copy,\
    \ do so now.\_\n* UPDATE\_: In a comment on the Drabblecast discussion forum,\
    \ listener \u201Ctbaker2500\u201D concurs: \u201CWhilst listening to the story,\
    \ I also heard in my head how Frank would read it. Two entirely different beasts.\
    \ Frank always sounds so indifferent, Norm so earnest. \u201D Hmm\u2026 \u201C\
    indifferent\u201D? An interesting choice of word. I think it may be the mot juste."
