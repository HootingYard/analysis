    Pansy Cradledew draws to my attention this title from a small collection of Victorian
    Yellowjackets*. Alas, I have never read Misery Junction by Richard Henry, and
    I find myself wondering if the story is set in one of the notorious junctions
    and sidings of the Hooting Yard to O''Houlihan''s Wharf Branch Line. There, Misery
    Junction is the foul rainswept junction between two other junctions, one called
    Moral Squalor Junction and the other known as Pretty Little Dandelion Junction.
    It should be noted that the pretty little dandelions growing so profusely around
    the railway lines at that spot were contaminated with some kind of toxin, and
    the pretty little ponies which cantered up to them for a lunchtime chew were swiftly
    carted off to the knackers yard, stone dead.

    * NOTE : Pansy quite rightly points out that I have confused a series of 19th
    century paperbacks (Yellowbacks) with a type of wasp (Yellowjacket). Such an easy
    mistake to make.'
