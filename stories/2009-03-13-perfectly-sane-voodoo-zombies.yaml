  text: 'I don''t want to get into unspeakable navel-gazing, but cannot let slip one
    of the comments on the Drabblecast* reading of Boiled Black Broth And Cornets.
    One of the pleasures of having stories read there--apart from the fact that I
    was paid thirteen quid for this one--is the nature of some of the contributions
    to the discussion forum. The audience is, I suspect, at something of a tangent
    to the Hooting Yard listenership.

    Consider this, from "delfedd": "What the bleep happened in that story? I got the
    voodoo zombie part. But why did she go absolutely insane?" Perhaps I am reading
    it wrong, but "delfedd" appears to be suggesting that to ply your friends with
    voodoo zombie soup is perfectly normal behaviour. Only later does Becke Beiderbix
    go "completely insane". I find this quite a worrying attitude, the more so because
    "delfedd"''s location is given as "Everywhere", meaning that s/he could barge
    in through my door at any moment, in full voodoo zombie mode.

    * NOTE : Incidentally, I have been wondering what the connection is between Norm
    Sherman''s podcast and our own dear Margaret Drabble. And does he have plans to
    launch another podcast named after her sister A S Byatt?'
