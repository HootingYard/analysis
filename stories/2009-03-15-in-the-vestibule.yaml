  text: 'On the day Hattie Jacques died, Dobson was slumped in the vestibule of a
    large and shabby hotel, to which he had been summoned by a captain of industry.
    The out of print pamphleteer was on the verge his dotage, but was not quite there
    yet. If anything, his lucidity was terrifying. There were egg stains on his cravat.

    The captain of industry failed to turn up, leaving Dobson in the lurch. At a loose
    end, and with barely a penny in his pockets, he slumped in the vestibule. The
    hotel did not have a commissionaire, or indeed anybody who cared that a pamphleteer
    was blocking the entrance, smelling faintly of egg.

    Hattie Jacques died of a heart attack on the sixth of October 1980. The captain
    of industry whom Dobson was expecting to meet had died a day earlier. Nobody thought
    to look in his appointments diary. Even if they had, it would have beflummoxed
    them, for the captain of industry used an unbreakable code. He did this to lend
    himself an air of importance.

    Of Norman Wisdom, with whom she appeared in The Square Peg and Follow A Star,
    Hattie Jacques said he was "difficult and self-centred". The same could be said
    of Dobson. Indeed, he wrote as much, in a pamphlet entitled Why I Can Be Difficult
    And Self-Centred (out of print). Presenting an obstacle to anyone who wanted to
    enter or leave the semidilapidated hotel that afternoon was but one instance of
    this.

    A number of people stepped over the slumped pamphleteer that day. Some even trod
    on him, so frantic was their haste. Dobson did not complain, for he was past caring.
    He was composing an essay in his head, as he often did, so that when he returned
    eventually to his escritoire he could scribble away at high speed. Sometimes he
    wrote so quickly that he scorched his notepaper.

    The dead captain of industry had arranged to meet Dobson because he wanted the
    pamphleteer to write his biography. As we have seen, he had a massive and delusional
    sense of his own importance, and felt that only a master of majestic sweeping
    prose such as Dobson could do justice to his life. By any objective measure it
    had been a colourless and godawful life, devoted almost entirely to the manufacture
    and sale of buttons.

    Hattie Jacques sported many buttons made by the captain of industry''s button
    company during the second world war, when she worked as an arc welder. The company
    provided the welding factory with all its buttons, and made its fortune in so
    doing. It was in the factory that Hattie Jacques nurtured her comic talents.

    Dobson had been apprised of the reason for his abortive meeting, and, slumped
    in the vestibule, was tussling with a title. The Life Of A Buttoneer appealed
    to him, but there was already a book of that name, an adventure story by the bestselling
    paperbackist Pebblehead set in Wivenhoe and Cuxhaven. "A rip-roaring and emotionally
    wrenching rollercoaster ride!" exclaimed the review in Book Reviews With Lots
    of Exclamation Marks magazine.

    Like Hattie Jacques'' ex-husband John Le Mesurier, the captain of industry had
    arranged his own death notice to appear in the newspaper. It read "Decisively
    Important Maker Of Buttons Is Dead. Keep buying his buttons so his name lives
    on for thousands of years." One of the people who trod on Dobson in the hotel
    vestibule dropped his newspaper as he did so, and the page with the buttoneer''s
    death notice came to rest upon the pamphleteer''s egg stained cravat. He made
    no attempt to move it.

    Hattie Jacques was buried in St Paul''s Churchyard in London. The captain of industry''s
    body lay undiscovered in his captainy penthouse flat, where it was gnawed by rats
    and mice. Eventually it was tossed into a furnace by a feckless janitor. The shabby
    hotel vestibule was not Dobson''s final resting place, thank god. At some point
    in the evening of that October day, he bestirred himself, scrunched up the newspaper
    that had fallen on him and shoved it into his pocket, finessed the cravat about
    his neck, and plodded home, difficult and self-centred, like Norman Wisdom, along
    lamplit streets. He had a while left before his dotage descended upon him.
