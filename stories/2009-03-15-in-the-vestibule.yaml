  text: "On the day Hattie Jacques died, Dobson was slumped in the vestibule of a\
    \ large and shabby hotel, to which he had been summoned by a captain of industry.\
    \ The out of print pamphleteer was on the verge his dotage, but was not quite\
    \ there yet. If anything, his lucidity was terrifying. There were egg stains on\
    \ his cravat.\nThe captain of industry failed to turn up, leaving Dobson in the\
    \ lurch. At a loose end, and with barely a penny in his pockets, he slumped in\
    \ the vestibule. The hotel did not have a commissionaire, or indeed anybody who\
    \ cared that a pamphleteer was blocking the entrance, smelling faintly of egg.\n\
    Hattie Jacques died of a heart attack on the sixth of October 1980. The captain\
    \ of industry whom Dobson was expecting to meet had died a day earlier. Nobody\
    \ thought to look in his appointments diary. Even if they had, it would have beflummoxed\
    \ them, for the captain of industry used an unbreakable code. He did this to lend\
    \ himself an air of importance.\nOf Norman Wisdom, with whom she appeared in The\
    \ Square Peg and Follow A Star, Hattie Jacques said he was \"difficult and self-centred\"\
    . The same could be said of Dobson. Indeed, he wrote as much, in a pamphlet entitled\
    \ Why I Can Be Difficult And Self-Centred (out of print). Presenting an obstacle\
    \ to anyone who wanted to enter or leave the semidilapidated hotel that afternoon\
    \ was but one instance of this.\nA number of people stepped over the slumped pamphleteer\
    \ that day. Some even trod on him, so frantic was their haste. Dobson did not\
    \ complain, for he was past caring. He was composing an essay in his head, as\
    \ he often did, so that when he returned eventually to his escritoire he could\
    \ scribble away at high speed. Sometimes he wrote so quickly that he scorched\
    \ his notepaper.\nThe dead captain of industry had arranged to meet Dobson because\
    \ he wanted the pamphleteer to write his biography. As we have seen, he had a\
    \ massive and delusional sense of his own importance, and felt that only a master\
    \ of majestic sweeping prose such as Dobson could do justice to his life. By any\
    \ objective measure it had been a colourless and godawful life, devoted almost\
    \ entirely to the manufacture and sale of buttons.\nHattie Jacques sported many\
    \ buttons made by the captain of industry's button company during the second world\
    \ war, when she worked as an arc welder. The company provided the welding factory\
    \ with all its buttons, and made its fortune in so doing. It was in the factory\
    \ that Hattie Jacques nurtured her comic talents.\nDobson had been apprised of\
    \ the reason for his abortive meeting, and, slumped in the vestibule, was tussling\
    \ with a title. The Life Of A Buttoneer appealed to him, but there was already\
    \ a book of that name, an adventure story by the bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead\
    \ set in Wivenhoe and Cuxhaven. \"A rip-roaring and emotionally wrenching rollercoaster\
    \ ride!\" exclaimed the review in Book Reviews With Lots of Exclamation Marks\
    \ magazine.\nLike Hattie Jacques' ex-husband John Le Mesurier, the captain of\
    \ industry had arranged his own death notice to appear in the newspaper. It read\
    \ \"Decisively Important Maker Of Buttons Is Dead. Keep buying his buttons so\
    \ his name lives on for thousands of years.\" One of the people who trod on Dobson\
    \ in the hotel vestibule dropped his newspaper as he did so, and the page with\
    \ the buttoneer's death notice came to rest upon the pamphleteer's egg stained\
    \ cravat. He made no attempt to move it.\nHattie Jacques was buried in St Paul's\
    \ Churchyard in London. The captain of industry's body lay undiscovered in his\
    \ captainy penthouse flat, where it was gnawed by rats and mice. Eventually it\
    \ was tossed into a furnace by a feckless janitor. The shabby hotel vestibule\
    \ was not Dobson's final resting place, thank god. At some point in the evening\
    \ of that October day, he bestirred himself, scrunched up the newspaper that had\
    \ fallen on him and shoved it into his pocket, finessed the cravat about his neck,\
    \ and plodded home, difficult and self-centred, like Norman Wisdom, along lamplit\
    \ streets. He had a while left before his dotage descended upon him.\n\n "
