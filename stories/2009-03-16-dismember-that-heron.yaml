  text: 'CARVING--Wynkyn de Worde printed in the year 1508 "The Book of Kervinge".
    Some of the words are curious, and throw light on the names of dishes which have
    been corrupted by process of time. Where the meaning is quite plain the spelling
    is modernised, but not otherwise.

    "The terms of a carver be as here followeth. Break that deer--lesche (leach) that
    brawn--rear that goose--lift that swan--sauce that capon--spoil that hen--frusche
    (fruss) that chicken--unbrace that mallard--unlace that coney--dismember that
    heron--display that crane--disfigure that peacock--unjoint that bittern--untache
    that curlew--alaye that felande--wing that partridge--wing that quail--mine that
    plover--thigh that pigeon--border that pasty--thigh that woodcock--thigh all manner
    small birds--timber that fire--tire that egg--chine that salmon--string that lamprey--splat
    that pike--sauce that plaice--sauce that tench--splay that bream--side that haddock--tusk
    that barbel--culpon that trout--fin that chevin--trassene that eel--tranch that
    sturgeon--undertranch that porpoise--tame that crab--barb that lobster. Here endeth
    the goodly terms of Carving."
