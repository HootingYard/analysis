  text: Bela Tarr's Satantango sounds like my kind of film. Indeed, I'm astonished
    that it has only just come to my attention, given that it was released in 1994.
    Clearly I am not keeping up with things as energetically as I ought to be. Satantango
    is seven and a half hours long, in black and white, set on a collapsing collective
    farm in Hungary, and the opening shot, which lasts for almost eight minutes, follows
    a herd of Hungarian cows trudging around a collapsing collective farmyard. I have
    not yet seen it, but I suspect I will adore it.
