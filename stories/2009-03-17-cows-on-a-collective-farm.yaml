  text: "Bela Tarr's S\xE1t\xE1ntang\xF3 sounds like my kind of film. Indeed, I'm\
    \ astonished that it has only just come to my attention, given that it was released\
    \ in 1994. Clearly I am not keeping up with things as energetically as I ought\
    \ to be. S\xE1t\xE1ntang\xF3 is seven and a half hours long, in black and white,\
    \ set on a collapsing collective farm in Hungary, and the opening shot, which\
    \ lasts for almost eight minutes, follows a herd of Hungarian cows trudging around\
    \ a collapsing collective farmyard. I have not yet seen it, but I suspect I will\
    \ adore it."
