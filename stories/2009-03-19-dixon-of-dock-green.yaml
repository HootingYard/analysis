  text: "\nDixon went to Dock Green. It was a small patch of grass, hardly a lawn,\
    \ at the edge of the dock. The dock itself was one where huge steamers came into\
    \ port from faraway lands, carrying all sorts of exotic cargo. The cargo was mostly\
    \ packed into wooden crates, which were winched from ship to dock by dockhands.\
    \ When it was lunchtime, the dockhands sprawled on the green, the small patch\
    \ of grass, and prised the lids off their Tupperwares and unscrewed the lids from\
    \ their flasks. They ate their bloater paste sandwiches and drank their tea and\
    \ while they chewed and swilled they talked to each other about the cargo they\
    \ had winched ashore that morning. The wooden crates usually had lettering stencilled\
    \ on their sides and tops describing what the crates contained. One might read\
    \ FRUIT GUMS, another GIRAFFE BRAINS.\nLeaning on a fence, smoking his pipe, Dixon\
    \ listened carefully to the chitchat of the dockhands. He used to be a policeman.\
    \ Now he was a spy. His mission was to find out what cargo had been winched ashore\
    \ that morning and report back to his spymasters. His spymasters were shadowy\
    \ figures who sat behind a big desk in an unlit room in a skyscraper in town.\
    \ The room was unlit so that Dixon was unable to see them with any clarity and\
    \ thus recognise them and thus be able to identify them at a later date if ever\
    \ questioned.\nDixon could have just blundered around the dock and read the stencilled\
    \ lettering on all the crates but he preferred to listen to the chitchat of the\
    \ dockhands because he could not read. He used to be able to, when he was a policeman,\
    \ but he had lost the ability. One day, one September day to be precise, he had\
    \ been chasing a miscreant and lost his footing in a gutter and banged his head,\
    \ and after banging his head he forgot everything he had ever known, even his\
    \ own name, and where he lived, and how old he was, and what he did for a living,\
    \ and how to read. In short, he was an amnesiac.\nOne of the spymasters came to\
    \ the clinic where Dixon had been put. To disguise his identity, the spymaster\
    \ wore a mask and modified his voice with an electronic device. He offered Dixon\
    \ a job at Dock Green. This day I am telling you about was Dixon's first day.\
    \ While he was leaning against the fence smoking his pipe and listening to the\
    \ dockhands, he forgot all about the unlit room in the skyscraper and the shadowy\
    \ spymasters who had sent him on his mission. He became very interested in the\
    \ fruit gums and giraffe brains and the winching mechanism and he walked on to\
    \ the ship to take a closer look.\nDixon was still on the ship when it steamed\
    \ out of port on its way to a far distant land to collect more cargo. One day,\
    \ out in the middle of one of those big oceans that make up so much of the planet's\
    \ surface, he received a bash on the head from a violent sailor. Then Dixon remembered\
    \ everything. He remembered he was a policeman, so he tried to arrest the violent\
    \ sailor for bashing him on the head. But the law of the land holds no sway at\
    \ sea, and the ship's captain locked him up in a cabin until they made landfall.\n\
    The first land they came to was a tiny rock. The captain and the violent sailor\
    \ took Dixon by the arms and legs and shoved him off the ship on to the rock.\
    \ It was almost barren, encrusted with barnacles and other shelly denizens of\
    \ the sea and rocks, but there was a small patch of grass. Dixon dubbed it Dock\
    \ Green and fashioned a flag from his cravat and found a stick for a flagpole\
    \ and planted his flag in the grass. And he devised a fishing rod and a bow and\
    \ arrows and a desalination unit, for he was a resourceful policeman, and he ruled\
    \ over his little kingdom, where there was never a whiff of crime, for many, many\
    \ years. \nNOTE : Younger readers, and those unfamiliar with British television\
    \ of decades past, may like to know that an inaccurate adaptation of this story\
    \ was the basis for a long running series."
