    Yesterday postie delivered From The Atelier Tovar : Selected Writings by Guy Maddin.
    Readers may recall I enthused about Mr Maddin last year. I am looking forward
    to reading this collection of journals, journalism and film treatments by the
    Winnipegite, but for the time being there are two phrases from the back cover
    blurbs of which I am inordinately envious. How can one not delight in a book of
    which it is said: "his treatments are deadpan whatsits of the highest order" and
    "you have arrived there, at the Atelier Tovar. Galoshes recommended"?'
