  text: "\nYesterday postie delivered From The Atelier Tovar\_: Selected Writings\
    \ by Guy Maddin. Readers may recall I enthused about Mr Maddin last year. I am\
    \ looking forward to reading this collection of journals, journalism and film\
    \ treatments by the Winnipegite, but for the time being there are two phrases\
    \ from the back cover blurbs of which I am inordinately envious. How can one not\
    \ delight in a book of which it is said: \u201Chis treatments are deadpan whatsits\
    \ of the highest order\u201D and \u201Cyou have arrived there, at the Atelier\
    \ Tovar. Galoshes recommended\u201D?"
