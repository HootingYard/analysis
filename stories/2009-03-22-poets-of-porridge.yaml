  text: "Weedy poet Dennis Beerpint recently received a commission from PIG to write\
    \ a ballade in celebration of the election of its new Presidento. PIG, for those\
    \ of you wallowing in ignorance, stands for the Porridge Information Groupuscule,\
    \ a body devoted to promoting the sale and consumption of porridge in every corner\
    \ of the land.\nSince he became a beatnik, Beerpint's Muse has deserted him, and\
    \ he has written nothing except for fragmentary squibs. He accepted the commission,\
    \ partly because of the generous fee and partly in the hope that his versifying\
    \ gifts might be reborn. Alas, he spent many hours sat staring hopelessly out\
    \ of the window with an empty brain.\nFinally, in desperation, he cast around\
    \ in anthologies for something which, if he could not quite pass off as his own,\
    \ he could tinker with, or use as a model. As luck would have it, he discovered\
    \ George Huddesford's 1802 poem The scum uppermost when the Middlesex porridge-pot\
    \ boils over\_:\_ an heroic election ballad with explanatory notes\_: accompanied\
    \ with\_: An admonitory nod to a blind horse. Here was a work that fitted the\
    \ bill perfectly, featuring not only porridge and elections, but horses and scum.\
    \ As I write, Beerpint is mucking about with the text to turn it into something\
    \ he can call his own.\nHuddesford, incidentally, had a way with titles, among\
    \ his other published pieces being Bubble And Squeak\_: A Gallimaufry of British\
    \ Beef with the Chopped Cabbage of Gallic Philosophy (1799). As for PIG, it is\
    \ held by some of the members that the proper title of Timothy Mo's 1991 novel\
    \ The Redundancy Of Courage should in fact be The Consistency Of Porridge, though\
    \ this is thought to be a comment on its prose style."
