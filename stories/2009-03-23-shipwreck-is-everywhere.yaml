  text: 'Si bene calculum ponas, ubique naufragium est.--Gaius Petronius Arbiter.
    That is, "if you consider well the events of life, shipwreck is everywhere". Nobody
    considered the events of life with as much rigour as the out of print pamphleteer
    Dobson, and he came to agree with Petronius. Indeed, late in life he became notorious
    for breaking up happy gatherings, such as cocktail parties and jaunty sporting
    occasions and infants'' birthday celebrations, by brandishing mezzotints of famous
    shipwrecks in the faces of those gathered and reciting, in a booming voice, The
    Wreck Of The Hesperus or The Wreck Of The Deutschland, or both.

    The mezzotints Dobson clipped from a magazine to which he subscribed for many
    years. Partridge & Peacock''s Weekly Shipwreck News collected accounts of shipwrecks
    real and fictional, usually written in lurid prose, and illustrated them with
    mezzotints, many from the hand of noted mezzotintist Rex Tint. Neither Partridge
    nor Peacock had the slightest interest in improving safety at sea, nor did they
    campaign for better lifeboat provision or similar initiatives. Quite the opposite,
    in fact. Partridge and Peacock were a gruesome pair, who relished the horror of
    shipwrecks, clapping their hands in unseemly glee when they received fresh tales
    of maritime disaster. They employed a team of backroom scribblers to empurple
    and embroider the basic reports which came clicketyclacking into the office on
    some kind of tickertapeyfaxy gubbins the duo had themselves invented.

    Dobson never wrote for the magazine, although both Partridge and Peacock begged
    him to do so. There was one particular winter when either or both of the creepy
    cousins came banging on Dobson''s door offering blandishments, but the pamphleteer
    never succumbed. Even in the depths of penury, he appears to have held himself
    aloof, which is the more curious when one considers how devoted a reader of the
    weekly he was. Odder still that shipwreck is one of the few topics, one of the
    few "events of life", to which Dobson did not devote a pamphlet of his own. It
    is true that he penned more than one blitheringly infantile encomium upon mezzotintist
    Rex Tint''s shipwreck mezzotints, the ones he clipped so carefully from the magazine
    every Tuesday morning for untold years and which, late in life, he took to pressing
    upon the attention of jolly partygoers, but of shipwrecks in and of themselves,
    he wrote not a word.

    Although she did not share Dobson''s macabre interest, Marigold Chew once set
    The Wreck Of The Deutschland to music. She was, at the time, a pupil of grim beetle-browed
    composer Horst Gack, who set her the task of using Father Hopkins'' great poem
    as the basis for a harmochronotransduction for voice, piping, valves, and flute-to-be-played-while-standing-on-one-leg.
    Legend has it that she tried to get Dobson to sing the words during rehearsals
    in a farmyard barn, but that the project had to be abandoned when cows toppled
    over and goats got the vapours, hens became hysterical and rooks and bluebirds
    plummeted from the sky.'
