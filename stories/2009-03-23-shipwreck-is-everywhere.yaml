  text: "Si bene calculum ponas, ubique naufragium est.\u2014Gaius Petronius Arbiter.\
    \ That is, \u201Cif you consider well the events of life, shipwreck is everywhere\u201D\
    . Nobody considered the events of life with as much rigour as the out of print\
    \ pamphleteer Dobson, and he came to agree with Petronius. Indeed, late in life\
    \ he became notorious for breaking up happy gatherings, such as cocktail parties\
    \ and jaunty sporting occasions and infants\u2019 birthday celebrations, by brandishing\
    \ mezzotints of famous shipwrecks in the faces of those gathered and reciting,\
    \ in a booming voice, The Wreck Of The Hesperus or The Wreck Of The Deutschland,\
    \ or both.\nThe mezzotints Dobson clipped from a magazine to which he subscribed\
    \ for many years. Partridge & Peacock's Weekly Shipwreck News collected accounts\
    \ of shipwrecks real and fictional, usually written in lurid prose, and illustrated\
    \ them with mezzotints, many from the hand of noted mezzotintist Rex Tint. Neither\
    \ Partridge nor Peacock had the slightest interest in improving safety at sea,\
    \ nor did they campaign for better lifeboat provision or similar initiatives.\
    \ Quite the opposite, in fact. Partridge and Peacock were a gruesome pair, who\
    \ relished the horror of shipwrecks, clapping their hands in unseemly glee when\
    \ they received fresh tales of maritime disaster. They employed a team of backroom\
    \ scribblers to empurple and embroider the basic reports which came clicketyclacking\
    \ into the office on some kind of tickertapeyfaxy gubbins the duo had themselves\
    \ invented.\nDobson never wrote for the magazine, although both Partridge and\
    \ Peacock begged him to do so. There was one particular winter when either or\
    \ both of the creepy cousins came banging on Dobson's door offering blandishments,\
    \ but the pamphleteer never succumbed. Even in the depths of penury, he appears\
    \ to have held himself aloof, which is the more curious when one considers how\
    \ devoted a reader of the weekly he was. Odder still that shipwreck is one of\
    \ the few topics, one of the few \u201Cevents of life\u201D, to which Dobson did\
    \ not devote a pamphlet of his own. It is true that he penned more than one blitheringly\
    \ infantile encomium upon mezzotintist Rex Tint's shipwreck mezzotints, the ones\
    \ he clipped so carefully from the magazine every Tuesday morning for untold years\
    \ and which, late in life, he took to pressing upon the attention of jolly partygoers,\
    \ but of shipwrecks in and of themselves, he wrote not a word.\nAlthough she did\
    \ not share Dobson's macabre interest, Marigold Chew once set The Wreck Of The\
    \ Deutschland to music. She was, at the time, a pupil of grim beetle-browed composer\
    \ Horst Gack, who set her the task of using Father Hopkins\u2019 great poem as\
    \ the basis for a harmochronotransduction for voice, piping, valves, and flute-to-be-played-while-standing-on-one-leg.\
    \ Legend has it that she tried to get Dobson to sing the words during rehearsals\
    \ in a farmyard barn, but that the project had to be abandoned when cows toppled\
    \ over and goats got the vapours, hens became hysterical and rooks and bluebirds\
    \ plummeted from the sky."
