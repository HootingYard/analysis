  text: "The Rev. Dr Opimian\u2014Why, Lord Michin Malicho, Lord Facing-both-ways,\
    \ and two or three other arch-quacks, have taken to merry-andrewising in a new\
    \ arena, which they call the Science of Pantopragmatics, and they have bitten\
    \ Lord Curryfin into tumbling with them; but the mania will subside when the weather\
    \ grows cool\u2026\nMiss Gryll \u2013 But pray, doctor, what is this new science?\n\
    The Rev. Dr Opimian\u2014Why that, Miss Gryll, I cannot well make out. I have\
    \ asked several professors of the science, and have got nothing in return but\
    \ some fine varieties of rigmarole, of which I can make neither head nor tail.\
    \ It seems to be a real art of talking about an imaginary art of teaching every\
    \ man his own business. Nothing practical comes of it, and, indeed, so much the\
    \ better\u2026 Like most other science, it resolves itself into lecturing, lecturing,\
    \ lecturing, about all sorts of matters, relevant and irrelevant; one enormous\
    \ bore prating about jurisprudence, another about statistics, another about education,\
    \ and so forth; the crambe repetita of the same rubbish, which has already been\
    \ served up \u201Ctwi\xEBs hot and twi\xEBs cold\u201D, as at many other associations\
    \ nicknamed scientific\u2026\n[Lord Curryfin] had been caught by the science of\
    \ pantopragmatics, and firmly believed for a time, that a scientific organisation\
    \ for teaching everybody everything, would cure all the evils of society.\n\_\n\
