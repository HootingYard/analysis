  text: 'The Rev. Dr Opimian--Why, Lord Michin Malicho, Lord Facing-both-ways, and
    two or three other arch-quacks, have taken to merry-andrewising in a new arena,
    which they call the Science of Pantopragmatics, and they have bitten Lord Curryfin
    into tumbling with them; but the mania will subside when the weather grows cool...

    Miss Gryll - But pray, doctor, what is this new science?

    The Rev. Dr Opimian--Why that, Miss Gryll, I cannot well make out. I have asked
    several professors of the science, and have got nothing in return but some fine
    varieties of rigmarole, of which I can make neither head nor tail. It seems to
    be a real art of talking about an imaginary art of teaching every man his own
    business. Nothing practical comes of it, and, indeed, so much the better... Like
    most other science, it resolves itself into lecturing, lecturing, lecturing, about
    all sorts of matters, relevant and irrelevant; one enormous bore prating about
    jurisprudence, another about statistics, another about education, and so forth;
    the crambe repetita of the same rubbish, which has already been served up "twies
    hot and twies cold", as at many other associations nicknamed scientific...

    [Lord Curryfin] had been caught by the science of pantopragmatics, and firmly
    believed for a time, that a scientific organisation for teaching everybody everything,
    would cure all the evils of society.
