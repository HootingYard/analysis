  text: 'Clutching a bag of feathers in his sweaty fist, the nameless miscreant stalked
    along the towpath of the canal. It was a paper bag. It was a stinking canal, into
    which thoughtless gits dumped such debris as toffee apple wrappers and cartons
    and bent bits of metal. The feathers in the miscreant''s bag were the feathers
    of swans. He had not plucked them himself, but stumbled upon them, a pile of swan
    feathers swept into a heap by the side of the canal a mile or so south, where
    there had been a short-lived swan war earlier in the day. The feathers had been
    scattered, and swept together by a broom wielded by the lock keeper. The lock
    keeper was the father of the miscreant, the long lost father. He did not know
    the miscreant was his son, nor did the miscreant know the lock keeper was his
    father. In physical appearance, there was nothing to connect them. The one was
    improbably tall, and loose-jointed, and lantern-jawed, like a giant, the other
    chubby and squat. Morally, too, a chasm lay between them, for the lock keeper
    was civic-minded and held down a steady job and used his broom to sweep up that
    which was scattered alongside the canal, be it the feathers of swans or the discarded
    wrappings of toffee apples and other confectionery. The miscreant, by contrast,
    was a miscreant, who would, if given a broom, use it not to sweep up rubbish but
    to beat about the head of someone weaker than he whom he could rob.

    The miscreant had not stuffed the feathers into a paper bag for any motive of
    beautifying the canalside. He had simply taken them, as miscreants will take,
    opportunistically, anything they can take. He saw the swan feathers in a pile
    and thought to himself that he could sell them to a dishonest milliner of his
    acquaintance. This milliner, he knew, would decorate his hats with all sorts of
    gaudies of dubious provenance. His customers never asked questions, not even when
    their heads grew boils and sores because their hat harboured toxic elements the
    milliner was too careless to decontaminate. A ruffian might sell him a box of
    beads for cash, and the milliner would stitch the beads into a hat, and sell the
    hat, and neither know nor care that the box of beads had been robbed from a hazardous
    waste compound.

    So the miscreant was confident he could sell the bag of feathers to the dishonest
    milliner, even though the swan war was occasioned by disturbance in the brains
    of the swans caused by weird turquoise sludge through which they had glid, so
    gracefully, some hours earlier. The sludge was almost unbelievably poisonous.
    It had been dumped in the canal and in nearby ponds by boffins, bad boffins, who
    were engaged in secret and fiendish experiments in their lab. One of these boffins
    was the cousin of the lock keeper. There had been much interbreeding, over the
    course of untallied generations, in this part of the land. The milliner shared
    a bloodline with the boffin too, and thus with the lock keeper, and thus with
    the miscreant.

    There was even talk, in the tavern, of squalid couplings with swans, in the past,
    when people knew no better. "There''s been traffic with beings aquatic," an oldster
    might mutter, staring gloomily into his tankard. Only the most observant might
    note the feathers visible when he hitched up his trousers, or the way he waddled
    slightly as he left the tavern, later, heading into the night to none knew where.
    And was that a faint splash that could be heard, not so distant, within minutes
    of his leaving?

    It is tempting, when writing of swans and boffins and canals, to regurgitate great
    chunks of prose written on these topics by the acknowledged masters, men like
    Dobson and Definzi and women like Hattie Meldrum. It is a temptation which must
    be fought and defeated, partly in respect for the copyright laws and partly from
    sheer pomposity. One must breathe through one''s nose, in an actorly way, and
    make a world with words of one''s own. The fact that that last sentence is a direct
    quotation from Definzi is neither here nor there.

    The toxic sludge dumped by the boffin was a by-product of the experiments going
    on in the lab. The purpose of those experiments was monstrous, and related in
    some wise to the matter muttered by the oldster in the tavern. Not all boffins
    are miscreants, by any means, but some are, and the bad boffin whose daily duty
    it was to roam the canalside and the ponds pumping hazardous sludge into the waters
    was one such. He was impudent in his criminality, not caring a jot if it was witnessed
    by innocents. He was of the view that all souls are besmirched, that guilt gnaws
    away at the innards of everybody. In this part of the land, with its history of
    sordid breeding, he may have been correct.

    Just as not all boffins are miscreants, nor are all miscreants boffins. For example,
    the nameless miscreant with his paper bag of feathers was no boffin. He had a
    tiny brain, and one which did not always work properly, not due to contact with
    toxic sludge, but rather because of repeated blows to the head received from other
    miscreants, once upon a time, in his fighting days. Had he been a boffin of any
    kind, he might have devised a way of resolving the dilemma that faced him now,
    as he stalked along the canal towpath. For his way was blocked by a gaggle of
    swans. Recently at war, the swans were peppy with adrenalin, their aggression
    by no means diminished. A truce with each other struck, they turned their cold
    horrifying eyes on the miscreant, whose approach was impertinent.

    How one wishes it were meet to copy out a screed by Hattie Meldrum here. In her
    magnificent compendium of violent swan anecdotage, she relates dozens of instances
    not unlike this confrontation. Some of her tales even take place alongside canals,
    albeit that in her world the canals are clean and well tended, the lock keepers
    need not go brooming about, and miscreants are few and far between. It is true
    that more than one bad boffin hoves into view in her five hundred pages, but their
    sins are not of a sludge-dumping character. The badness of Hattie''s boffins is
    limited to swan cruelty, or one should say attempted swan cruelty, with one exception,
    and in that case the boffin is a blasphemer.

    Had our paper bag-clutching miscreant known that, deep in his past, there had
    been several occurrences of congress with swans and other waterfowl, he might
    have burrowed into the nooks and crevices of his tiny brain to deploy some atavistic
    sound or gesture with the effect of placating the swans blocking his path. But
    he knew nothing of his past. He did not even know his own father, who at that
    very moment was coming towards the swans from the rear, having swept up, with
    his broom, a couple of tin cans and stray toggles torn from a duffel coat. The
    lock keeper was returning to his lock keeper''s hut for tea and toast, his broom
    over his shoulder, his lips pursed in the whistling of a happy, happy tune.

    So. We have a gang of swans, rancorous swans, their innate savagery compounded
    by the effects of the traces of toxic sludge still present in their systems, their
    malevolence focused upon a hapless miscreant carrying a paper bag of swan feathers
    destined for a dishonest milliner. Unseen by the swans, because behind them, and
    not one of them looks back, comes a lanky man with a broom. That there will be
    violence, pecking, bashing, blood, screeching, laceration, splashing, all in the
    dapple of sunlight by the side of the canal, along its towpath, is, it would appear,
    inevitable. We expect the swans to attack the miscreant, the lock keeper to attack
    the swans, the outcome of course being beyond our wit to foresee. Oblivious to
    their parts, the boffin is siphoning sludge into a pannier, the milliner is sewing
    infected buttons on to a cap. For make no mistake, these two cannot be forgotten
    in the telling of the tale. Hattie Meldrum, for one, would have done more than
    sketch them in. You would get potted biographies as likely as not.

    There is a moment, in all anecdotage, where we can stop, as if freezing a frame
    in a motion picture. Some say events are foretold in the stars. Even if we disparage
    such twaddle, it remains the case that sometimes circumstances are such that we
    are convinced we know what is about to happen. Ah, but we forget. We forget, in
    the present instance, that there is another fellow who plays a part. At the very
    moment the swans are about to launch their attack on the miscreant, the same moment
    the lock keeper takes his broom from his shoulder ready to attack the swans...
    there is a gurgling in the canal. Bubbles disturb the filthy surface. And with
    a mighty splash, emerging from the depths comes the oldster, the mutter-man from
    the tavern, now transformed, half man, half swan, gigantic, and he, it, enwraps
    the lock keeper and the miscreant and all the swans within the folds of its enormous
    beating wings. It holds them close, close enough almost to suffocate them. But
    it does not suffocate them. It holds them whole.'
