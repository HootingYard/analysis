  text: 'Q--When stricken with the palsy, can one maintain a flamboyant demeanour?

    A--As the recently elected Potus might say, yes one can. Not only can one maintain
    flamboyance, but also poise. It is important to bear in mind that both these qualities,
    and indeed many others, such as spark and dash and A(c)lan, are innate, and need
    not be corrupted by any paresis of the limb or limbs. If, as often happens, the
    paresis is accompanied by violent and uncontrollable trembling, it can prove a
    tad more difficult to maintain one''s flamboyance, but it is by no means an impossibility.

    Take, for example, the case of that magnifico we know as Quintus Pabstus Compostus.
    The ancient world had its fair share of flamboyance and poise and spark and dash
    and A(c)lan, but seldom were all these attributes present in one man. From rooftops
    to arcades to fora, the name of Pabstus was bruited about as a paragon. He may
    indeed have lacked virtue, and horse sense, and he certainly never cut his martial
    chops, but his name was, as it still remains, a byword for flamboyance. A vivid
    portrait of him is drawn in the second of Puny''s Six Pantopragmaticons, viz:

    [Depending on the type of computer system you are using, text in a variety of
    ancient languages may not be visible to the naked eye, nor indeed to the eye enhanced
    by visual perspicuity aids.]

    At the peak of his public esteem, Pabstus was struck with the palsy. He was, we
    are told, in an arcade, on a hot morning, cutting a dash, the cynosure of the
    civity, when, as if struck by a bolt of lightning, he crumpled to the paving.
    Borne on a stretcher to a place of pallets, he was laid upon one and moved into
    cool and shade. Vestal nymphs soothed his brow, and a beardy haruspex was summoned
    to prognosticate upon his case by careful reading of the entrails of a freshly
    slaughtered hen. The palsy was confirmed.

    A less flamboyant paragon might have withered away. Consider Crotus Loppo, at
    one time the rival of Pabstus, who, when felled by a debilitating ague, was swiftly
    revealed to be a boor and a poltroon. All semblance of flamboyance deserted him,
    and he did indeed wither away. At the very end, his bones were tossed into the
    Vastulus, and the medals on which his head appeared were melted down for horseshoes.

    Not so with Quintus Pabstus Compostus. Transferred from the pallet on to a litter,
    he had himself paraded through the city, his weakened tremulous limbs covered
    by a cloak that might have been thought gaudy were it not so flamboyant. He had
    his beard and bouffant preened and scented with unguents and, because his speech
    was not impaired, was able to dazzle the populace with his rhetoric and repartee.
    This seldom made any sense, but his voice was sonorous and his delivery had great
    poise. Thus he is the epitome of the palsied flamboyant.

    Less distant in time, we might look to the Victorian dandy Auberon Wildbadger.
    Forever enwrapped in a cloak as flamboyant as the one that once covered the palsied
    limbs of Pabstus, Wildbadger is sometimes mistakenly thought of as a fop. But
    fops rarely sprout moustachios as decisive as his, nor show such effortless poise
    when leaning against large important buildings. It is no doubt pertinent that
    he was the son of a brimstone-and-sulphur preacher, a reverend gentleman who shook
    the walls of tin tabernacles with his frankly insane ravings. Wildbadger learned
    much from his father, but not what the latter would have wished to teach his son.
    The young Auberon smirked at the content, but lapped up the style. So later, when
    he made his way in the world, he knew precisely how to make people gasp, and even
    swoon, merely by the flamboyance with which, for example, he adjusted his cravat.

    Wildbadger too was struck by the palsy, while dining on oysters and lobster at
    the CafA(c) Showoff. Slumping in his chair, his limbs limp, and the trembling,
    the trembling of his limbs not yet set in, as it would shortly, and continue,
    relentlessly, for decades, the dandy merely raised an eyebrow and called the maitre
    d'' to his table to demand, in his fluting voice, more oysters and an extra lobster.
    They were brought, but without the flamboyance he desired, so he sent the hapless
    waiter away to try again. Back came the oysters and lobster, carried on a gilt
    platter, but again without the kind of dash and poise that Wildbadger, even in
    his physical collapse, thought apt. Other diners could not but be struck by his
    A(c)lan as he commanded the waiter back and forth until he was satisfied. As the
    diarist Lady Chlorine Skippington-Pip, who was present in the Cafe, wrote:

    Rare it is to witness such flamboyance in one so palsied. Methinks we must go
    back as far as the ancient world, and the example of Quintus Pabstus Compostus,
    to be swoony with awe at such poise and spark and dash.

    In summary, then, my questioner need have no fear. I have told of two exemplars,
    a pair of paragons. Even in your present adversity, you may yet prove to be a
    third.'
