  text: "Q\u2014When stricken with the palsy, can one maintain a flamboyant demeanour?\n\
    A\u2014As the recently elected Potus might say, yes one can. Not only can one\
    \ maintain flamboyance, but also poise. It is important to bear in mind that both\
    \ these qualities, and indeed many others, such as spark and dash and \xC3\xA9\
    lan, are innate, and need not be corrupted by any paresis of the limb or limbs.\
    \ If, as often happens, the paresis is accompanied by violent and uncontrollable\
    \ trembling, it can prove a tad more difficult to maintain one's flamboyance,\
    \ but it is by no means an impossibility.\nTake, for example, the case of that\
    \ magnifico we know as Quintus Pabstus Compostus. The ancient world had its fair\
    \ share of flamboyance and poise and spark and dash and \xC3\xA9lan, but seldom\
    \ were all these attributes present in one man. From rooftops to arcades to fora,\
    \ the name of Pabstus was bruited about as a paragon. He may indeed have lacked\
    \ virtue, and horse sense, and he certainly never cut his martial chops, but his\
    \ name was, as it still remains, a byword for flamboyance. A vivid portrait of\
    \ him is drawn in the second of Puny's Six Pantopragmaticons, viz:\n[Depending\
    \ on the type of computer system you are using, text in a variety of ancient languages\
    \ may not be visible to the naked eye, nor indeed to the eye enhanced by visual\
    \ perspicuity aids.]\nAt the peak of his public esteem, Pabstus was struck with\
    \ the palsy. He was, we are told, in an arcade, on a hot morning, cutting a dash,\
    \ the cynosure of the civity, when, as if struck by a bolt of lightning, he crumpled\
    \ to the paving. Borne on a stretcher to a place of pallets, he was laid upon\
    \ one and moved into cool and shade. Vestal nymphs soothed his brow, and a beardy\
    \ haruspex was summoned to prognosticate upon his case by careful reading of the\
    \ entrails of a freshly slaughtered hen. The palsy was confirmed.\nA less flamboyant\
    \ paragon might have withered away. Consider Crotus Loppo, at one time the rival\
    \ of Pabstus, who, when felled by a debilitating ague, was swiftly revealed to\
    \ be a boor and a poltroon. All semblance of flamboyance deserted him, and he\
    \ did indeed wither away. At the very end, his bones were tossed into the Vastulus,\
    \ and the medals on which his head appeared were melted down for horseshoes.\n\
    Not so with Quintus Pabstus Compostus. Transferred from the pallet on to a litter,\
    \ he had himself paraded through the city, his weakened tremulous limbs covered\
    \ by a cloak that might have been thought gaudy were it not so flamboyant. He\
    \ had his beard and bouffant preened and scented with unguents and, because his\
    \ speech was not impaired, was able to dazzle the populace with his rhetoric and\
    \ repartee. This seldom made any sense, but his voice was sonorous and his delivery\
    \ had great poise. Thus he is the epitome of the palsied flamboyant.\nLess distant\
    \ in time, we might look to the Victorian dandy Auberon Wildbadger. Forever enwrapped\
    \ in a cloak as flamboyant as the one that once covered the palsied limbs of Pabstus,\
    \ Wildbadger is sometimes mistakenly thought of as a fop. But fops rarely sprout\
    \ moustachios as decisive as his, nor show such effortless poise when leaning\
    \ against large important buildings. It is no doubt pertinent that he was the\
    \ son of a brimstone-and-sulphur preacher, a reverend gentleman who shook the\
    \ walls of tin tabernacles with his frankly insane ravings. Wildbadger learned\
    \ much from his father, but not what the latter would have wished to teach his\
    \ son. The young Auberon smirked at the content, but lapped up the style. So later,\
    \ when he made his way in the world, he knew precisely how to make people gasp,\
    \ and even swoon, merely by the flamboyance with which, for example, he adjusted\
    \ his cravat.\nWildbadger too was struck by the palsy, while dining on oysters\
    \ and lobster at the Caf\xC3\xA9 Showoff. Slumping in his chair, his limbs limp,\
    \ and the trembling, the trembling of his limbs not yet set in, as it would shortly,\
    \ and continue, relentlessly, for decades, the dandy merely raised an eyebrow\
    \ and called the maitre d\u2019 to his table to demand, in his fluting voice,\
    \ more oysters and an extra lobster. They were brought, but without the flamboyance\
    \ he desired, so he sent the hapless waiter away to try again. Back came the oysters\
    \ and lobster, carried on a gilt platter, but again without the kind of dash and\
    \ poise that Wildbadger, even in his physical collapse, thought apt. Other diners\
    \ could not but be struck by his \xC3\xA9lan as he commanded the waiter back and\
    \ forth until he was satisfied. As the diarist Lady Chlorine Skippington-Pip,\
    \ who was present in the Cafe, wrote:\nRare it is to witness such flamboyance\
    \ in one so palsied. Methinks we must go back as far as the ancient world, and\
    \ the example of Quintus Pabstus Compostus, to be swoony with awe at such poise\
    \ and spark and dash.\nIn summary, then, my questioner need have no fear. I have\
    \ told of two exemplars, a pair of paragons. Even in your present adversity, you\
    \ may yet prove to be a third."
