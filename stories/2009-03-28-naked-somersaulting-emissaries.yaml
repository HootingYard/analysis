  text: 'I think the time has come for me to acquire a team of naked somersaulting
    emissaries...

    In 589, a man went insane after being surrounded by flies in a forest near Arles.,
    in France; two years later, he dressed himself in animal skins and made his way
    down to Gevaudon, in the Cevennes, declaring that he was Christ, and that he had
    the power to heal the sick... He began to accumulate an army of followers, which
    reached three thousand, and towns they approached were asked to acknowledge that
    he was Christ--which most of them did to avoid trouble. Approaching the town of
    La Puy, he quartered his army in halls and churches, and sent naked messengers
    to announce his arrival to Bishop Aurelius.

    When the bishop saw these emissaries turning somersaults, he had no doubt that
    they were inspired by the devil, so, hiding his disgust, he sent some of his men
    to welcome the man who called himself Christ. They bowed as if to kiss the messiah''s
    knees, then dragged him to the ground and stabbed him to death. Without their
    leader, the followers quickly dispersed... but St Gregory of Tours, who records
    the story, adds that the messiah''s followers continued to believe in him until
    the day they died.

    From The Devil''s Party : A History Of Charlatan Messiahs by Colin Wilson (2000)

    Wilson, who knocks out books at a Pebbleheadian rate, can''t be bothered to provide
    us with footnotes and references (other than that allusion to St Gregory of Tours).
    I think by "Gevaudon" he means GA(c)vaudan, which, intriguingly, was terrorised
    by man-eating wolf-like creatures between 1764 and 1767. Could it be that, clothed
    in his animal skins, the fly-maddened Christ returned after twelve hundred years
    as the Beast of  Gevaudan? I suspect this is highly likely, for as we all know,
    the Lord moves in mysterious ways His flies to swat away wonders to perform.'
