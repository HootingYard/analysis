  text: "Give me a sieve or a riddle and, boy oh boy, before you can say \u201Clumme,\
    \ guvnor, knock me down with a feather\u201D, I'll have a pan of fine powder from\
    \ which all the cloddy clumps have been winnowed. By pouring a little warm water\
    \ in to the pan from a bowl, and stirring it with a stick, I will soon have a\
    \ paste. And you know what? I can add dye to the paste to make it any colour I\
    \ like. It doesn't matter what colour the powder was originally.\nThe next thing\
    \ I can do is to make the paste a little tacky by adding a binding agent. In 1859,\
    \ William H Gregory published Egypt In 1855\u201356, where he remarks, inter alia,\
    \ that \u201CThe rocky walls were black and sticky, and seemed to sweat a thick,\
    \ fatty, viscous liquor\u201D. That is precisely the kind of paste we want in\
    \ our pan.\nNow we return to the sieve, or riddle, which holds all the clumps\
    \ that didn't make it through. The first thing to do is to remove them, one by\
    \ one, and place them in a line on your countertop. Sort them in order of size,\
    \ so that you have a row of clumps gradually ascending from tiny to titanic. Of\
    \ course, the tiniest of the clumps will not be too tiny, for remember that what\
    \ you have here are the leavings in the sieve. What I always do at this stage\
    \ is to count the clumps, just to give me some idea of what lies ahead, in terms\
    \ of time and effort. Then I get a duster from the duster drawer and very carefully\
    \ swab all the clumps, one by one, wiping off any grime or filth from them.\n\
    When this part of the process is complete, shake the duster violently over a bucket\
    \ or pail, to collect all the bits of unutterable filth. However energetically\
    \ you shake the duster, some minuscule crumbs of dirt may cling to it. These can\
    \ be removed by aiming a jet of fast-rushing air from a nozzle over the whole\
    \ surface of the duster, pointing the jet in such a way that the last remnants\
    \ of grubbiness fall plop into the bucket or pail.\nIf you have got this far with\
    \ the project, give yourself a pat on the back, or, better, get someone else to\
    \ pat you on the back, or to give you a bear hug. Try, though, not to be tempted\
    \ to take a breather for a cup of tea and one of your cheap Bosnian cigarettes.\
    \ I make every effort to press right on, fearing a lack of momentum. Maybe that's\
    \ just me. You might be able to put your feet up and even take a nap, but I wouldn't\
    \ risk it.\nNext we wash our hands, before pouring the viscous paste out of the\
    \ pan into a clean bowl. We lay paper towels out on the countertop. We grasp a\
    \ pair of tongs. There are three basic classes of tongs, to wit: (a) tongs which\
    \ have long arms terminating in small flat circular ends and are pivoted close\
    \ to the handle, as in the common fire-tongs, used for picking up pieces of coal\
    \ and placing them on a fire. (b) tongs consisting of a single band of metal bent\
    \ round one or two bands joined at the head by a spring, as in sugar-tongs (a\
    \ pair of usually silver tongs with claw-shaped or spoon-shaped ends for serving\
    \ lump sugar), asparagus-tongs and the like, and (c) tongs in which the pivot\
    \ or joint is placed close to the gripping ends, such as blacksmith's tongs or\
    \ crucible-tongs. Which class of tongs you use is entirely up to you. I did not\
    \ tell you what colour to dye your paste, nor am I going to limit your choice\
    \ of tongs. There are ancient freedoms we must strain with all our might to protect.\n\
    Starting at the end of the row of clumps where you placed the tiniest clump, pick\
    \ up the first clump with the tongs and dip it into the paste, until it is coated,\
    \ and then place it carefully on the paper towels. Relax the tongs, and proceed\
    \ to the next clump. Continue without pause until you have dipped and coated all\
    \ the clumps with paste. Do not allow a squadron of Messerschmitts screaming across\
    \ the sky to distract you.\nWhile waiting for the clumps to dry, I take the opportunity\
    \ to carry the bucket or pail full of filth to a municipal filth depot, where\
    \ I upturn the bucket or pail and empty it. Back home, wipe the insides of the\
    \ bucket or pail with a rag. Do not use one of your dusters. That is not what\
    \ dusters are for.\nYou now have a set of pasted clumps, each of which has two\
    \ little unpasted patches where it was gripped by the tongs. There is likely to\
    \ be a third anomalous patch after you have picked up the clump to place it in\
    \ the bucket or pail. Given the viscosity of the paste, a shred of paper towel\
    \ may remain stuck to the clump. Treasure this imperfection.\nWhen all the clumps\
    \ are gathered in the bucket or pail, I always feel like singing a round of glees,\
    \ but you don't necessarily have to. What you must do is to take the bucket or\
    \ pail and place it in your porch. Nothing quite pulls a porch together as winningly\
    \ as a bucket or pail of clumps covered in paste, each clump with its two or three\
    \ little unpasted patches. And if you don't believe me, consider this entry from\
    \ the diaries of Lady Chlorine Skippington-Pip, denizen of the Caf\xC3\xA9 Showoff:\n\
    28th March 19\u2013. Dennis [Prong] came to visit, accompanied by his wolfhounds\
    \ and a crack troop of snipers fresh from dispersing unseemly rioters. I had hoped\
    \ to treat them to tea and biscuits and lobster, but they spent the whole time\
    \ shuffling around in the porch, absolutely transfixed by my bucket or pail of\
    \ clumps covered in paste, each clump with its two or three little unpasted patches.\
    \ It proved quite a hit. It was dark by the time they scuttled off. Despite the\
    \ cheerfulness of the porch time, I felt suddenly overcome with desolation and\
    \ anguish, and slumped on one of my carpets, sobbing, sobbing, long into the night,\
    \ until distracted by a squadron of Messerschmitts screaming across the sky."
