  text: 'Yesterday I posted an extract from The Devil''s Party : A History Of Charlatan
    Messiahs by Colin Wilson. Wilson is quite a maddening writer, slapdash and hurried,
    but I have to admire the way he litters his text with marvellously entertaining
    snippets of information. On page 73, for example, we learn that Jim Jones of the
    People''s Temple funded his early cult-building efforts by being a door-to-door
    monkey salesman.'
