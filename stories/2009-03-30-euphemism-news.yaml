  text: Jeff Goldstein has devised an excellent new euphemism for children. After
    rejecting little persons and pre-adults and future adults, he lit upon spatiotemporally-challenged
    proto-adults. I hope to see this accepted as the common usage in all official
    reports, directives, ukases and commands.
