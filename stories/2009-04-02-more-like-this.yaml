  text: "The BBC has a clip of London Mayor Boris Johnson getting a bit grumpy and\
    \ walking out of a Commons Select Committee meeting where he is being questioned\
    \ about the recent snowfall. Viewers are then offered the chance to watch similar\
    \ video clips--I assume that is the meaning of \"More Like This\"--including \"\
    Snow-crazed stoat 'goes berserk'\". Mayor, stoat... can you tell the difference?\n\
    Incidentally, I liked the Mayor's recent comment on some aspect, I forget which,\
    \ of the global economic meltdown--\"the medium has spoken but we have yet to\
    \ see the ectoplasm!\"A \nEqually superb was Peter Mandelson's reply to an interviewer\
    \ who asked him how he felt to be involved in \"the fulcrum of history\" (illiterate\
    \ hyperbabble for the G20 summit). A \"The soup's nice,\" said Mandelson."
