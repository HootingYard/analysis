  text: 'Speaking of malevolent putti, as I was below, here is a picture of a pair
    of them dissecting a dog. Elsewhere in the image, of which this is a detail, another
    couple of cherubs are examining the entrails of a freshly-slaughtered hare. So,
    for your own good, don''t be taken in by their oh-so-cutesy appearance!


    From the Wellcome Library, via Holly Tucker at the splendid Wonders & Marvels.'
