  text: "Upon waking, the sight of hoofprints on the ceiling, hoofprints that were\
    \ not there when you fell asleep, can be worrisome. The regime has now issued\
    \ a helpful step-by-step guide setting out precisely what to do in the circumstances.\n\
    i. Remain lying in bed, quite still, staring at the ceiling. Try to recall any\
    \ dreams you may have had while you were asleep. Did any hooved beasts, such as\
    \ goats or horses, feature in these dreams? If so, they were probably not dreams\
    \ at all, and thus you have a preliminary explanation for the hoofprints on your\
    \ ceiling. Report this immediately to your local nocturnal hoofprint investigating\
    \ officer.\nii.\_If you did not dream of hooved beasts, or cannot recall doing\
    \ so, you are left without a satisfactory explanation for the hoofprints. This\
    \ will not do. Get out of bed, plunge your head into a pail of icy water, thrice,\
    \ and look again at the ceiling. If the hoofprints are no longer visible, bury\
    \ the memory of ever having seen them.\niii. If, on the other hand, the hoofprints\
    \ are still there, clamber on to a step ladder and try to obliterate them with\
    \ a rag and a proprietary cleansing spray such as Hoofbegone!\u2122. If you are\
    \ able to eradicate the hoofprints entirely, fold up your step ladder, return\
    \ the spray to your cupboard, and wash the rag in warm soapy water.\niv.\_It may\
    \ be that the hoofprints on your ceiling are impossible to remove. Do not even\
    \ think about painting over them with whitewash. Instead, get dressed in something\
    \ fetching and pay a visit to the local nocturnal hoofprint investigation office.\
    \ Make an appointment to see a ceiling hoofprint specialist.\nv. At the subsequent\
    \ interview, before you are tied to a chair in the cellar, provide the specialist\
    \ with any snapshots you have taken of your ceiling. When asked to describe the\
    \ hoofprints, and any other phenomena that may be pertinent, give full and frank\
    \ answers before the hood is pulled over your head.\nvi. When you recover consciousness\
    \ in a ditch in a remote part of the country, dressed in a paper suit, make your\
    \ way to the border. Report to the guards, and on no account say a word about\
    \ the hoofprints. Submit willingly when one of the guards points a sort of magnetic\
    \ ray gun at your brain.\nvii. As a sleeper agent in the neighbouring statelet,\
    \ obtain a menial job and await further instructions. Note that the suckers on\
    \ your hands and newly-behooved feet should be kept free of dust and grime. Avoid\
    \ podiatrists, even in social settings such as cocktail parties and p\xE9tanque\
    \ tournaments."
