  text: "It is rare indeed to find video links at Hooting Yard, but... good grief,\
    \ this is superb! Mr Key's favourite beat combo, Henry Cow, performing \"Living\
    \ In The Heart Of The Beast\" at Vevey in Switzerland in 1976. (It looks to me\
    \ as if they're in the middle of a field*, which may explain the absence of the\
    \ standard lamps which were such a beguiling feature of their usual stage set.)\
    \ Irritatingly split into three parts. Watch, listen, and learn.\nIncidentally,\
    \ \"Living In The Heart Of The Beast\" was the piece that prompted Peter Blegvad's\
    \ dismissal from the Henry Cow / Slapp Happy collective on the grounds of flippancy.\
    \ Tim Hodgkinson wrote the music and, as Blegvad recalled in an interview in Hearsay\
    \ magazine, \"I was assigned the task for the collective to come up with suitable\
    \ verbals, and I wrote two verses about a woman throwing raisins at a pile of\
    \ bones. Tim just said, I'm sorry, this is not at all what we want. And he wrote\
    \ reams of this political tirade. I admired his passion and application but it\
    \ left me cold. I am to my bones a flippant individual\".\nWell, it is a tirade,\
    \ but it's still magnificent.\n*NOTE : This being Switzerland, I am reminded,\
    \ most appositely, of the timeless quotation \"Here we are in the field of dreams,\
    \ surrounded by fields of cows.\" See here for the source.\n "
