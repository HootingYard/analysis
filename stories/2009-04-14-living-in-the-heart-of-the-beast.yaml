  text: "It is rare indeed to find video links at Hooting Yard, but\u2026 good grief,\
    \ this is superb! Mr Key's favourite beat combo, Henry Cow, performing \u201C\
    Living In The Heart Of The Beast\u201D at Vevey in Switzerland in 1976. (It looks\
    \ to me as if they're in the middle of a field*, which may explain the absence\
    \ of the standard lamps which were such a beguiling feature of their usual stage\
    \ set.) Irritatingly split into three parts. Watch, listen, and learn.\nIncidentally,\
    \ \u201CLiving In The Heart Of The Beast\u201D was the piece that prompted Peter\
    \ Blegvad's dismissal from the Henry Cow / Slapp Happy collective on the grounds\
    \ of flippancy. Tim Hodgkinson wrote the music and, as Blegvad recalled in an\
    \ interview in Hearsay magazine, \u201CI was assigned the task for the collective\
    \ to come up with suitable verbals, and I wrote two verses about a woman throwing\
    \ raisins at a pile of bones. Tim just said, I'm sorry, this is not at all what\
    \ we want. And he wrote reams of this political tirade. I admired his passion\
    \ and application but it left me cold. I am to my bones a flippant individual\u201D\
    .\nWell, it is a tirade, but it's still magnificent.\n*NOTE\_: This being Switzerland,\
    \ I am reminded, most appositely, of the timeless quotation\_\u201CHere we are\
    \ in the field of dreams, surrounded by fields of cows.\u201D See here for the\
    \ source.\n\_"
