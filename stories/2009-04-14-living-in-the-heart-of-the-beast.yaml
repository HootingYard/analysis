  text: 'It is rare indeed to find video links at Hooting Yard, but... good grief,
    this is superb! Mr Key''s favourite beat combo, Henry Cow, performing "Living
    In The Heart Of The Beast" at Vevey in Switzerland in 1976. (It looks to me as
    if they''re in the middle of a field*, which may explain the absence of the standard
    lamps which were such a beguiling feature of their usual stage set.) Irritatingly
    split into three parts. Watch, listen, and learn.

    Incidentally, "Living In The Heart Of The Beast" was the piece that prompted Peter
    Blegvad''s dismissal from the Henry Cow / Slapp Happy collective on the grounds
    of flippancy. Tim Hodgkinson wrote the music and, as Blegvad recalled in an interview
    in Hearsay magazine, "I was assigned the task for the collective to come up with
    suitable verbals, and I wrote two verses about a woman throwing raisins at a pile
    of bones. Tim just said, I''m sorry, this is not at all what we want. And he wrote
    reams of this political tirade. I admired his passion and application but it left
    me cold. I am to my bones a flippant individual".

    Well, it is a tirade, but it''s still magnificent.

    *NOTE : This being Switzerland, I am reminded, most appositely, of the timeless
    quotation "Here we are in the field of dreams, surrounded by fields of cows."
