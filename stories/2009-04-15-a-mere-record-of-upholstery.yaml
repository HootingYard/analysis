  text: "Aladdin is possibly the best-known of the Tales Of The One Hundred And One\
    \ Nights, fodder for panto and Disney and even for film-makers in the Soviet Union.\
    \ I have never read the story myself, in any version, and I doubt that I ever\
    \ will, now that I have chanced upon Thomas De Quincey's judgment of it.\nIn Infant\
    \ Literature, he wrote: \u201Cin Aladdin, after the possession of the lamp has\
    \ been once secured by a pure accident, the story ceases to move. All the rest\
    \ is a mere record of upholstery; how this saloon was finished today, and that\
    \ window on the next day, with no fresh incident whatever\u201D.\nThat said, it's\
    \ an interesting narrative technique, if one has a particular readership, such\
    \ as upholsterers, in mind. But I don't."
