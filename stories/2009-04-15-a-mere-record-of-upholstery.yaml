  text: 'Aladdin is possibly the best-known of the Tales Of The One Hundred And One
    Nights, fodder for panto and Disney and even for film-makers in the Soviet Union.
    I have never read the story myself, in any version, and I doubt that I ever will,
    now that I have chanced upon Thomas De Quincey''s judgment of it.

    In Infant Literature, he wrote: "in Aladdin, after the possession of the lamp
    has been once secured by a pure accident, the story ceases to move. All the rest
    is a mere record of upholstery; how this saloon was finished today, and that window
    on the next day, with no fresh incident whatever".

    That said, it''s an interesting narrative technique, if one has a particular readership,
    such as upholsterers, in mind. But I don''t.'
