  text: "To celebrate what would have been Samuel Beckett's one hundred and third\
    \ birthday on Monday, Nige (whom I've not come across before) quoted from Watt:\n\
    \"The crocuses and the larch turning green every year a week before the others\
    \ and the pastures red with uneaten sheep's placentas and the long summer days\
    \ and the new-mown hay and the wood-pigeon in the morning and the cuckoo in the\
    \ afternoon and the corncrake in the evening and the wasps in the jam and the\
    \ smell of the gorse and the look of the gorse and the apples falling and the\
    \ children walking in the dead leaves and the larch turning brown a week before\
    \ the others and the chestnuts falling and the howling winds and the sea breaking\
    \ over the pier and the first fires and the hooves on the road and the consumptive\
    \ postman whistling The Roses Are Blooming in Picardy and the standard oil-lamp\
    \ and of course the snow and to be sure the sleet and bless your heart the slush\
    \ and every fourth year the February debacle and the endless April showers and\
    \ the crocuses and then the whole bloody business starting over again.\"\nAs is\
    \ probably crystal clear, Watt--along with much else of Beckett's prose--is a\
    \ key text for Mr Key. It remains for me one of the funniest books I have ever\
    \ read. I was introduced to Beckett by my English teacher when I was about fifteen.\
    \ The teacher's name was Dick Shone--the schoolboy joke was that, as an English\
    \ teacher, he lived in a Dick-Shone-ry. He was a fine pedagogue with a talent\
    \ for withering sarcasm, and I remember him with affection.\n "
