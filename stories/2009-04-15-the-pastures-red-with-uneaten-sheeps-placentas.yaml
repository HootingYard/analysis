  text: 'To celebrate what would have been Samuel Beckett''s one hundred and third
    birthday on Monday, Nige (whom I''ve not come across before) quoted from Watt:

    "The crocuses and the larch turning green every year a week before the others
    and the pastures red with uneaten sheep''s placentas and the long summer days
    and the new-mown hay and the wood-pigeon in the morning and the cuckoo in the
    afternoon and the corncrake in the evening and the wasps in the jam and the smell
    of the gorse and the look of the gorse and the apples falling and the children
    walking in the dead leaves and the larch turning brown a week before the others
    and the chestnuts falling and the howling winds and the sea breaking over the
    pier and the first fires and the hooves on the road and the consumptive postman
    whistling The Roses Are Blooming in Picardy and the standard oil-lamp and of course
    the snow and to be sure the sleet and bless your heart the slush and every fourth
    year the February debacle and the endless April showers and the crocuses and then
    the whole bloody business starting over again."

    As is probably crystal clear, Watt--along with much else of Beckett''s prose--is
    a key text for Mr Key. It remains for me one of the funniest books I have ever
    read. I was introduced to Beckett by my English teacher when I was about fifteen.
    The teacher''s name was Dick Shone--the schoolboy joke was that, as an English
    teacher, he lived in a Dick-Shone-ry. He was a fine pedagogue with a talent for
    withering sarcasm, and I remember him with affection.
