  text: 'Over at The New Psalmanazar, Ian Woolcott remarks: "If my cat were to write
    a book I think it would read something like Mein Kampf."A  He describes his cat
    as a wicked, embittered creature, which is almost certainly true of all cats,
    whose saving grace is their unfathomable stupidity. It is this combination of
    characteristics which makes them so engaging, unlike dogs. As we have seen, dogs
    are boring.

    We can adduce further evidence of cats'' fundamental malevolence from Nerea De
    Clifford. In her study What British Cats Think About Television, she wrote: "Most
    cats show an interest of some kind, though it is often of hostility... a significant
    reaction is the display of excitement when any picture, especially of birds, moves
    quickly across the screen." (Previously quoted in the Archives, March 2004.)

    Here is a photograph of Nerea De Clifford, described by the Cats Protection League
    as "a popular and gracious lady".
