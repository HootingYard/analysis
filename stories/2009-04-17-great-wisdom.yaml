  text: "The Islamic chaplain at Yale University says there is \u201Cgreat wisdom\u201D\
    \ in the idea of putting to death those who leave his religion. I suspect he may\
    \ need to have his brain tampered with, or at least be given a dictionary so that\
    \ he can learn the meaning of \u201Cwisdom\u201D. Here, for example, is a proper\
    \ example of great wisdom from Mick Hartley:\n\u201CIn these dark days it's somehow\
    \ comforting to think that someone, somewhere, has been spending their time fitting\
    \ eye-patches on bees.\u201D\nIt is indeed."
