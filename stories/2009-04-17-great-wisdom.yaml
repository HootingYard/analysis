  text: 'The Islamic chaplain at Yale University says there is "great wisdom" in the
    idea of putting to death those who leave his religion. I suspect he may need to
    have his brain tampered with, or at least be given a dictionary so that he can
    learn the meaning of "wisdom". Here, for example, is a proper example of great
    wisdom from Mick Hartley:

    "In these dark days it''s somehow comforting to think that someone, somewhere,
    has been spending their time fitting eye-patches on bees."

    It is indeed.'
