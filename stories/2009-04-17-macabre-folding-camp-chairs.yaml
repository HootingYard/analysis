  text: 'According to the visitor statistics, someone arrived at Hooting Yard yesterday
    having searched for the term "macabre folding camp chairs". I hasten to add that
    I am not making this up. I suspect what the inquirer was looking for was Dobson''s
    exceedingly rare Eerie & Macabre Picnic Praxis, a set of practical guidelines
    which appeared, oddly, as an appendix to his pamphlet A Dictionary Of Squirrels
    (out of print).

    Unusually for Dobson, the Praxis was written in response to a request from a reader.
    The pamphleteer was notoriously dismissive, even contemptuous, of his audience,
    such as it was. Marigold Chew recalls the great man stamping about in his study,
    spitting into the fireplace, shouting his head off at nobody in particular and
    insisting that his readership was composed of spiteful lickspittles and human
    wreckage. He had no evidence to back this claim, of course. He just enjoyed his
    misanthropic ravings, as who does not?

    We must wonder, then, why the pamphleteer responded with such alacrity to the
    letter he received from a correspondent signing himself simply as "JFK". There
    are compelling reasons to believe this was the soon-to-be-assassinated thirty-fifth
    Potus, but that is unlikely to have impressed Dobson, who had a weird animus towards
    men who wore surgical braces for excruciating back pain. A devotee of the "back
    quack" Rastus Tebbit, whom he occasionally visited in prison, Dobson swore by
    the old fraud''s patent back pain remedy of lettuce, toad, and cake.

    The letter itself was clear and concise. Dear Dobson, it read, I am planning to
    organise a picnic outing that will be both eerie and macabre, but I have no idea
    how to go about it. It has been suggested to me by one of my secret service agents
    that a pamphleteer such as yourself would be able to bash together some guidelines
    at the drop of a hat. Thanks in advance.

    It has been estimated that throughout his long career, Dobson received no fewer
    than eight direct requests from readers to address a particular topic. The other
    seven were binned or burned or torn to shreds or, on one memorable occasion, folded
    into a paper aeroplane of uncommonly aerodynamic soundness and launched from atop
    an Alpine peak into the blue empyrean, to the applause of a gaggle of Swiss boy
    scouts. Yet this one letter stirred something in the pamphleteer''s brain, and
    he immediately sat down at his escritoire and took a newly-sharpened pencil from
    his pencil pot and wrote the Praxis, it is thought in a single burst of concentrated
    picnic prose. The subject, it should be remembered, was one familiar to him, for
    he had written teeming pages on picnics in earlier years. Indeed, one of the first
    pamphlets ever to bear Dobson''s name was entitled God Almighty, Is There Anything
    More Satisfying Than A Well-Executed Picnic? (out of print).

    As mysterious as the enthusiasm with which he tackled a reader''s request, however,
    is the fact that, as soon as the Praxis was written, Dobson shoved it into a cardboard
    box and forgot about it. Within days, the manuscript was covered with other scribblings,
    and with biscuit crumbs and dust and spilled talcum powder and a cackhandedly-folded
    map of guillemot habitats and shells from a packet of brazil nuts and newspaper
    cuttings and a hiking boot catalogue until the box was full and its lid was fitted
    and it was consigned to a shelf in the cellar alongside dozens upon dozens of
    other cardboard boxes filled with a heteroclite jumble of forgotten miscellania.
    This habitual Dobsonian practice has proved infuriating for scholars. Perhaps
    it really would have been better if the whole damned lot had been burned to a
    cinder.

    Almost a decade passed. One Thursday afternoon, during a thunderstorm, Marigold
    Chew remarked to Dobson that his Dictionary Of Squirrels, which she was readying
    for print, would, in her opinion, be immeasurably enriched by the addition of
    a few more pages. But Dobson had exhausted his knowledge of squirrels, and had
    nothing more to say. By chance, he was rummaging about searching for the map of
    guillemot habitats, in preparation for his next project, A Dictionary Of Guillemot
    Habitat Maps, and, grabbing at the Praxis, he tossed it over to Marigold, muttering
    something along the lines of it being a "companion piece". This was nonsense,
    of course, for it is nothing of the sort. Squirrels are not even mentioned in
    its sixteen brief paragraphs. Marigold was skim-reading it, and about to protest
    that Dobson was fobbing her off with a non-squirrel-related text, when there was
    an almighty clap of thunder and both the pamphleteer and his inamorata were stricken
    with sudden terrific clap of thunder shock syndrome. Dazed and bumbling, Dobson
    then made things worse by insisting they both take Rastus Tebbit''s so-called
    "curative", a potion of toad, cake and radish, the only effect of which was to
    unhinge their reason for a period of forty-eight hours. It was during this time,
    with her judgement impaired, that Marigold Chew printed all known copies of the
    Dictionary Of Squirrels, with its wholly irrelevant appendix.

    Should we be glad she did so? The Eerie & Macabre Picnic Praxis is a curious work,
    and it is hard to see how practical the guidelines are if one is actually intent
    upon organising an eerie and macabre picnic. Paragraph six, for example, the one
    I think my visitor from yesterday was searching for, reads as follows:

    Most reputable stockists of folding camp chairs will be happy to listen to any
    requests from you regarding eerie or macabre ranges of their merchandise. They
    will listen happily because they tend, as a tribe, to be happy, even when faced
    by plague and cataclysm. I know this much because I have seen them laugh hysterically
    at an approaching swarm of locusts, on more than one occasion.

    As Aloysius Nestingbird, that most temperate of Dobsonists, asked, after reading
    this passage, "What in heaven''s name is he blathering on about?" To date, no
    one has given a satisfactory answer to that question.'
