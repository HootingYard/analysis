  text: 'There is a slight possibility that Hooting Yard may be offline for a couple
    of days, due to ludicrous shenanigans with which I shall not bore you. If this
    happens, get your fix by burrowing in the 2003-2006 Archives. With luck, however,
    I may be able to delete this entry. Fingers crossed.

    UPDATE : I am pleased to report that the shenanigans, such as they were, have
    been averted. I was on the point of deleting what I had written above, when a
    thought popped unbidden within my brain, and my hands, looming in readiness above
    the keyboard, loomed still, in mid-air, as if frozen in a snapshot. The thought
    was this: if I leave those measly words in place, could I not use them as a pretext
    upon which to tap out a further barrage of sensible prose? Each day one struggles,
    as if through fog, or mud, or foggy mud, for ideas, for things to say, for observations
    to make, for words to add to the teeming words already bashed from the keys, between
    glugs of tea, or Lemsip, between staring out of the window at the sky and the
    clouds and the flocks of swooping unidentified birds. There are of course more
    bitter struggles, let''s not get carried away. And sometimes it is not a struggle
    at all. Sometimes the words come as easily as falling off a log, as they say.
    Twenty two years ago, on the morning after the Great Storm, there were more logs
    lying around from which one could fall, having first clambered to stand upon them,
    than one usually finds in this bailiwick. Ordinarily one might have to walk a
    mile or two, or more, to find a log lying on its side, riddled with worms and
    burrowing tiny beings and grubs. But there were logs aplenty after so many trees
    had come crashing to the ground in the night, battered by howling winds. But perhaps
    I am confusing fallen trees with logs, when they are not quite the same thing,
    or not at all the same thing, and I am just displaying my ignorance of certain
    aspects of the world. It would not be the first time. I rarely check the accuracy
    of my assertions before I tap ''em out, and I never feel constrained to write,
    as that witless piece of advice has it, "only about what you know". How dull would
    that be? Only yesterday, for example, I stumbled upon a reference to the German
    film director Wieland Speck. I had never heard of him before, but something in
    his name appealed to me. "Wieland", with its echoes of Gothic from Charles Brockden
    Brown''s novel of that name, and "Speck", a lovely chunky word one can spit out,
    and its meaning of a thing tiny and evanescent and fugitive. Within five minutes,
    I had embroidered inside my head a majestic canon of Speck films about which I
    might hold forth, pretentiously, waving my arms in dramatic gestures, the cynosure
    of a salon''s worth of credulous admirers. I might be wearing a beret, and sporting
    a goatee, in this little mirage, taking languid puffs on a Gitane between singing
    the praises of an intense black and white melodrama of sulky demimondaines directed
    by Speck in 1966. For me, Speck--pronounced Shpeck, being German--was up there
    with Fassbinder and Herzog, as fecund as the one and as unhinged as the other,
    and I was ready to write a monograph about him. Alas, a couple of minutes of research,
    made so effortless by the interweb, told me that Wieland Speck was not the cinegod
    of my dreams, merely the director of a handful of features that sounded, frankly,
    a tad mediocre. Twenty two years ago, at the time of the Great Storm, before the
    interweb as we know it, it would have taken me much longer, weeks or months or
    even years, to track down information about Wieland Speck, assuming I maintained
    my interest long enough to do so. My private Speck would have had a longer life,
    with time to grow and develop, before the disappointment of the real Speck obtruded.
    At interweb speed, my dream Speck is come and gone in minutes, become a mere mental
    speck in my own history, and would be swiftly forgotten. Ah... but never forgotten
    if I write him down, no, and never deleted. Had I been so rash as to obliterate
    the shenanigans above, I might never have found myself recalling the glorious
    fictional cinematic career of my mental Wieland Speck, who has as just a claim
    to posterity as the real one. Well... probably not, all things considered, but
    you know what I''m saying, daddy-o, because I''ve just said it.'
