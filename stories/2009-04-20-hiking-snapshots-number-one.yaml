  text: 'Here is a very rare photograph of Dobson hiking in the mountains:


    UPDATE : A particularly rigorous Dobsonist has written a hot-headed letter insisting
    that this is not a photograph of the out of print pamphleteer, but is in fact
    a still from Arnold Fanck''s 1930 "mountain film" Sturme uber dem Montblanc.'
