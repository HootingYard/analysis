  text: "I haven't read anything by J G Ballard since I was a teenager. Nor have I\
    \ read, or enjoyed, much science fiction. A simple statement by Ballard, filmed\
    \ in 2006 and shown on a Channel Four News obituary last night, makes me suspect\
    \ I've been missing something. He said:\n\u201CThe great thing about science fiction\
    \ is that nobody lives in Hampstead.\u201D\nCompare and contrast with this extract\
    \ from a book review by some airhead a few years ago, which I shall have to paraphrase\
    \ because I cannot track down the exact quote:\n\u201CThis is a perfectly-observed\
    \ portrait of North London literary life, with such telling details as the copy\
    \ of the weekend Guardian Guide on the coffee table.\u201D\nI don't recall which\
    \ novel was under review, but it could have been one among hundreds, couldn't\
    \ it?"
