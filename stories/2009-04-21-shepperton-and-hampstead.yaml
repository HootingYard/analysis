  text: 'I haven''t read anything by J G Ballard since I was a teenager. Nor have
    I read, or enjoyed, much science fiction. A simple statement by Ballard, filmed
    in 2006 and shown on a Channel Four News obituary last night, makes me suspect
    I''ve been missing something. He said:

    "The great thing about science fiction is that nobody lives in Hampstead."

    Compare and contrast with this extract from a book review by some airhead a few
    years ago, which I shall have to paraphrase because I cannot track down the exact
    quote:

    "This is a perfectly-observed portrait of North London literary life, with such
    telling details as the copy of the weekend Guardian Guide on the coffee table."

    I don''t recall which novel was under review, but it could have been one among
    hundreds, couldn''t it?'
