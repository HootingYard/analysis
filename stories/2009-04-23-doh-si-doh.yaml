  text: "\u201CStrangle a pig and burn down the barn and doh-si-doh your partners!\u201D\
    \nIt was a rallying cry, and in its wake pigs were strangled, barns were burned,\
    \ and doh-si-dohs were essayed. How sweet the memory of those dances of my grandparents\u2019\
    \ youth. I was not alive then of course, so I have no direct memory, but I recall,\
    \ as an infant, sitting in a basket slung over one of grandpa's bison, and he\
    \ goading the beast along the lane, and telling me tales of his childhood in the\
    \ Wenkenblatt, the strangled pigs and the burning barns and the doh-si-dohs.\n\
    He told me how he and my grandma met at such a rally, the one with a bale of straw\
    \ and the other with a can of paraffin, and how they kissed as they set a barn\
    \ ablaze, and clambered to safety over the corpses of pigs, and doh-si-dohed in\
    \ the light of the flames.\nIt is another world. Now, pig protection teams stand\
    \ guard over the sties, and barns are built from fireproof panels, and the doh-si-doh\
    \ is classed as a criminal act, the penalty terrible. It is perhaps a more civilised\
    \ world, even here in the Wenkenblatt, but though I know it only from my grandparents\u2019\
    \ stories, still I miss that rustic mayhem. There is a hole where my soul should\
    \ be.\nI wander past the pig sty and beat my fists upon the side of the barn,\
    \ and very very quietly, so I will not be overheard, I put my lips together and\
    \ whistle a tune from the old pneumatic hoedownolator, a mad and giddy tune."
