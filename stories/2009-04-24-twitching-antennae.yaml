  text: "There hasn't been much key-tapping here at Haemoglobin Towers today, what\
    \ with such distractions as the monkey feng shui consultant and the sandpaper\
    \ palaver. But a few things twitched the Hooting Yard antennae, among them:\n\
    The imminence of a global pig flu epidemic\nThe fact that it was once common,\
    \ in fashionable society, to call a humble or paid companion a \u201Ctoad-eater\u201D\
    \nThe splendid news that Resonance magnifico Ed Baxter appeared in the Independent\
    \ On Sunday list of 100 people who make Britain happy\nBela Tarr's film The Man\
    \ From London, characteristically slow and grim and bleak and black and white,\
    \ contains a scene with a pair of tailors reminiscent of The Fast Show\nThere\
    \ is a Hooting Yard Appreciation Society on Facebook, with 28 members and little\
    \ or no activity\nIf I can rouse myself from indolence, I will insert links so\
    \ readers can scoot off elsewhere on the web to investigate these matters. If\
    \ not, you shall have to do your own research, which will no doubt be good for\
    \ your moral fibre, if not mine."
