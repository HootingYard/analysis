  text: 'We have learned, in recent years, to be on our guard against the terrors
    of bird flu. Those who cannot avoid handling hens now ensure they wear full protective
    body armour when doing so, and the rest of us steer clear of members of the hen
    community at all times. Here at Hooting Yard we have been at the forefront of
    a campaign to address the particular perils faced by those who have pet swans.
    General avoidance of birds is well nigh impossible, given their tendency to swoop
    and perch and paddle and nest pretty much wherever they like, but with judicious
    use of netting and frighteners and wild gesticulations of the limbs, most of us
    have been able to keep ourselves safe. Predictions of a world ruled by flu-ridden
    crows and cassowaries and nightjars, common enough at the turn of the century,
    have proved to be alarmist twaddle.

    Now we face a new danger. As I mentioned yesterday, it is no longer just birds
    we need to worry about, but pigs too. Virulent strains of so-called swine flu
    threaten to engulf us. This brings with it new problems, not the least being a
    wholesale rethinking of the practice of becalming our boiling brains through lengthy
    contemplation of pigs while leaning against the fence of a sty. As a tried and
    tested relaxation technique, pig contemplation is unsurpassed. It has been estimated
    that several wars have been averted through its organised application, and readings
    on a pneumatic belligerometer confirm its effectiveness. Any outbreak of swine
    flu will thus be devastating, with fizzing cranial disturbances inside people''s
    heads having no easy remedy. I am not referring here only to countryside persons,
    for there are innumerable urban pigsties where mental relief can be sought...
    or could be sought before this new and terrifying development.

    At a special conference to be held at the Blister Lane Bypass Pig Study Building
    Hub, a panel of boffins will be devising ways to counter the threat. Until they
    release the results of their deliberations in the form of handy pamphlets, try
    not to go near any pigs. However, if you are the sort of person for whom traffic
    with pigs is unavoidable, a course of Dr Baxter''s Antipig Calmative tablets is
    recommended. Take a dozen daily, with a bowl of cornflakes, and do not in any
    circumstances operate heavy machinery, such as one of those mechanical pig hoists
    we''ve been hearing so much about in the hoisting-and-winching press.'
