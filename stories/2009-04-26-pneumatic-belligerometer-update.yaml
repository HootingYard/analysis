  text: "Watch this, as I hoist from its sublunar obscurity in the Comments Crate\
    \ this observation from R. upon Bird Imperilment And Pig Terror:\n I would greatly\
    \ like to acquire a pneumatic belligerometer, (not least because it would serve\
    \ as such a handsome source of anagrams such as\nBarometric legume penlite,\n\
    Beagle courtier implement,\nBeetle-glimmer precaution,\nCollegiate number-emptier,\n\
    Cremation temple beguiler,\nElectable meringue import,\nEmblematic leering troupe,\n\
    Enigmatic petroleum rebel,\nGeometrical perineum belt,\nGlobule empire remittance,\n\
    Immutable ogre percentile,\nImpermeable ingot lecture,\nLemming teepee-lubricator,\n\
    Mantelpiece goitre-rumble,\nMemorable eugenic triplet,\nMetabolic eremite plunger,\n\
    Mincemeat bilge poulterer,\nMolecular beeping emitter,\nNebulae piglet micrometer,\n\
    Noticeable glum perimeter,\nPiecemeal mongrel tribute,\nPlebeian telecommuter\
    \ rig,\nPliable morgue centimeter,\nPolemical brunette regime,\nRenegotiable lime\
    \ crumpet,\nRepublican grime omelette,\nRubella peering-committee,\nTelegenic\
    \ pubertal memoir,\nTemper guillotine embrace,\nTolerable genetic premium\netc)\
    \ ... can Mr Key perhaps advise about a source? I have a feeling the answer will\
    \ be Huberman's ... in which case, some link to an online 'store locator' would\
    \ be helpful.\nI may have mentioned before my view that R. was born a few hundred\
    \ years too late, and would clearly have been a prime candidate for the post of\
    \ Royal Anagrammatist at the court of Louis XIV, or possibly Louis XVI. I always\
    \ get them mixed up, unlike the earlier Frankish kings, with whose doings I am\
    \ frighteningly familiar. Whether XIV or XVI, Louis did indeed employ someone\
    \ to devise anagrams for the purpose of foretelling the future and bringing arcana\
    \ to light. R., too, may have foretold the future, in the sense that any or all\
    \ of the above phrases may spark some fizz in Mr Key's cranium, resulting in a\
    \ piece of sensible prose. Watch this space.\nThe last I heard, Huberman's sold\
    \ off their dwindling supply of pneumatic belligerometers to a passing pedlar,\
    \ who careens along the lanes of some godforsaken part of the country in an unregistered\
    \ ice cream van. Hail it to a halt, and he might sell one to you."
