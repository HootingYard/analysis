  text: "At the end of the Pneumatic Belligerometer Update the other day, I mentioned\
    \ an unregistered ice cream van, and I have been asked to explain in what ways\
    \ such an ice cream van differs from a registered one. It is all to do with robins.\n\
    Some years ago, an inpector appointed by the regime started to notice the presence\
    \ of threatening robins whenever an ice cream van went barrelling along the lanes\
    \ around Pang Hill and its satellite dire and dirty villages. The more the inspector\
    \ looked, the more robins he saw, in the sky, upon branches, in shrubbery and\
    \ hedges, atop buildings, and even perched on the power lines that are strung\
    \ from paling to paling with no apparent purpose in this gas-fuelled bailiwick.\
    \ When the wheezy tinkling of an ice cream van was heard, the number of robins\
    \ seemed to double, then triple, and a sense of menace was made manifest.\nThe\
    \ inspector passed this information on to an officer back at headquarters. The\
    \ officer, resplendent in furry pelts and Hohenzolleren cavalry marshal's boots,\
    \ immediately hauled in as many ice cream van drivers as his agents could pull\
    \ from their beds at midnight, and had them questioned.\nHave you, or has your\
    \ van, ever been attacked by robins?\nThis was the gist of all the interrogations,\
    \ however they were phrased. The replies contained much dissembling, many evasions,\
    \ and outright lies, but that was only to be expected, and the graph on which\
    \ the results were plotted was adjusted accordingly. The officer had half a dozen\
    \ copies of the graph printed, in four colours, green and pink and dun and scarlet,\
    \ and sent them by pneumatic tube to his superiors. He was commended for his rigour,\
    \ and awarded yet another medal, this one of tin, circular, and expensively beribboned.\n\
    The committee of six, recognising their own lack of ornithological expertise,\
    \ empanelled a birdy nutter to add weight to their deliberations. He was no robin\
    \ specialist by any means, being more of a corncrake man. He spent most of his\
    \ time out in the wilds, living in tree hollows, surviving on berries and water\
    \ from rills, and the first meeting of the committee to decide what to do about\
    \ the menacing robins had to be delayed while he was tracked down. The task of\
    \ doing so was assigned to a cadet who happened to be a cousin of the original\
    \ ice cream van investigator. Though cousins, they had been reared as brothers,\
    \ as close as twins. The cadet's name was Bim and the investigator was called\
    \ Bam, and they were both fanatically loyal to the regime, in spite of the fact\
    \ that their other cousin, Shevelham, was a treasonous cur languishing in one\
    \ of the prison forts on the windswept plains out west.\nBim found the corncrake\
    \ expert hiding in a forest, eating a choc ice, peering at birds through a pair\
    \ of binoculars. They were not robins. \_\nThere was a deal of difficulty in getting\
    \ a seventh copy of the graph printed for the birdman. There was no shortage of\
    \ coloured inks, nor of paper, but the regime was faced with terrific transport\
    \ problems. So many vans had been converted to the vending of ice cream, despite\
    \ the robins, that few vehicles remained abroad for other purposes. Ink and paper\
    \ could not go by rail, nor by coastal paddle-steamer, due to ancient regulations\
    \ none dared overturn. It was, after all, that sort of regime.\nMore and more\
    \ robins were gathering in the sky and the trees and between the palings.\nIt\
    \ was on the third or fourth day after the empanelment of the committee that the\
    \ idea of registering the ice cream vans was proposed. The bird person, hefty\
    \ and somewhat disorientated out of his woods, remained unconvinced that robins\
    \ were intelligent enough to tell a registered ice cream van from an unregistered\
    \ one. The person sat to his left explained that unregistered ice cream vans would,\
    \ if found upon the lanes and boulevards, be blown up with bazookas.\nFewer vans,\
    \ fewer robins.\nThis was the committee's slogan. They had it stamped on items\
    \ of stationery and teacups and beakers as part of a campaign. A protocol was\
    \ devised whereby ice cream van drivers could apply for registration, at post\
    \ offices and bureaux and at vanishing points down grim horrifying alleyways.\
    \ This last was picked as a wheeze to do away with the more stupid ice cream van\
    \ drivers, those whom it was thought may be attracting more than a fair share\
    \ of the maleficent robins. The birdy panellist was asked to draw up a special\
    \ report on the meaningful brain activity of both ice cream van drivers and a\
    \ sample of captured robins, to find out if there was any correlation. He decamped\
    \ back to the forest before completing his work, and no search party ever found\
    \ him, however frantically they crashed through the undergrowth beating the foliage\
    \ with sticks.\nMuch was left undone that ought to have been done. Yet the registration\
    \ of ice cream vans remained as an emblematic law. As the robins gradually dispersed,\
    \ due to the depredations of owls and weasels and monkeys and a change in the\
    \ shapings of the sky, so the enforcers with their scanners and firearms were\
    \ removed from the kerbside kiosks, and unregistered ice cream vans again braved\
    \ the roads.\nThat is how it was."
