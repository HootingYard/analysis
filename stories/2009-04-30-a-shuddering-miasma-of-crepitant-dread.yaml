  text: "Listeners to Hooting Yard On The Air will be aware of my boundless admiration\
    \ for the pulp writer Hal K Wells. Many's the time I have read out on the show\
    \ one particular quotation from his story Black Pool For Hell Maidens, to wit:\n\
    \ \nCarlin's deep-shadowed eyes were flaming pools of mad menace.\n\"I could shoot\
    \ you both down where you stand,\" he rasped, \"but that would be a foolish waste\
    \ of valuable material... I shall turn the two of you over to the Dweller in the\
    \ pool!\"\n Dorothy Lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin's thin lips writhed in\
    \ a snarling smile...\n\"Who, or what, is the Dweller in the pool?\" demanded\
    \ Kent, \"And what devil's work is Carlin doing here anyway?\"\n\"The Dweller\
    \ in the pool,\" Dorothy answered, her low voice trembling, \"is my brother, Raoul!\"\
    \ ...\nSmall wonder that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should\
    \ combine to taint the very air with a shuddering miasma of crepitant dread!\n\
    That \"My brother, Raoul!\" gets me every time.\nI am pleased to report, via Odd\
    \ Ends, that another Wells story has been added at Project Gutenberg. In Devil\
    \ Crystals Of Arret, young Larry faces a six-hour deadline of death, plus rat-men,\
    \ octopus-bats, eldritch music and tinkling devil crystals! So alluring is the\
    \ prospect of wallowing in a Wellsian miasma, I have had to put on hold my plan\
    \ to read the umpteen volumes of John Ruskin's Fors Clavigera : Letters To The\
    \ Workmen And Labourers Of Great Britain, a work Guy Davenport suggested is comparable\
    \ only to Tristram Shandy in its magnificent eccentricity.\nThe Sun newspaper--yes,\
    \ The Sun!--once commanded its readers \"Go thee to H P Lovecraft and shudder!\"\
    \ Excellent advice, you'll agree, and I would like to echo it by recommending\
    \ you do the same with Hal K Wells. A few more of his tales are available online\
    \ here.\n "
