  text: "Listeners to Hooting Yard On The Air will be aware of my boundless admiration\
    \ for the pulp writer Hal K Wells. Many's the time I have read out on the show\
    \ one particular quotation from his story Black Pool For Hell Maidens, to wit:\n\
    \_\nCarlin's deep-shadowed eyes were flaming pools of mad menace.\n\u201CI could\
    \ shoot you both down where you stand,\u201D he rasped, \u201Cbut that would be\
    \ a foolish waste of valuable material\u2026 I shall turn the two of you over\
    \ to the Dweller in the pool!\u201D\n\_Dorothy Lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin's\
    \ thin lips writhed in a snarling smile\u2026\n\u201CWho, or what, is the Dweller\
    \ in the pool?\u201D demanded Kent, \u201CAnd what devil's work is Carlin doing\
    \ here anyway?\u201D\n\u201CThe Dweller in the pool,\u201D Dorothy answered, her\
    \ low voice trembling, \u201Cis my brother, Raoul!\u201D \u2026\nSmall wonder\
    \ that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should combine to taint the\
    \ very air with a shuddering miasma of crepitant dread!\nThat \u201CMy brother,\
    \ Raoul!\u201D gets me every time.\nI am pleased to report, via Odd Ends, that\
    \ another Wells story has been added at Project Gutenberg. In Devil Crystals Of\
    \ Arret, young Larry faces a six-hour deadline of death, plus rat-men, octopus-bats,\
    \ eldritch music and tinkling devil crystals! So alluring is the prospect of wallowing\
    \ in a Wellsian miasma, I have had to put on hold my plan to read the umpteen\
    \ volumes of John Ruskin's Fors Clavigera\_: Letters To The Workmen And Labourers\
    \ Of Great Britain, a work Guy Davenport suggested is comparable only to Tristram\
    \ Shandy in its magnificent eccentricity.\nThe Sun newspaper\u2014yes, The Sun!\u2014\
    once commanded its readers \u201CGo thee to H P Lovecraft and shudder!\u201D Excellent\
    \ advice, you'll agree, and I would like to echo it by recommending you do the\
    \ same with Hal K Wells. A few more of his tales are available online here.\n\_"
