  text: 'Listeners to Hooting Yard On The Air will be aware of my boundless admiration
    for the pulp writer Hal K Wells. Many''s the time I have read out on the show
    one particular quotation from his story Black Pool For Hell Maidens, to wit:


    Carlin''s deep-shadowed eyes were flaming pools of mad menace.

    "I could shoot you both down where you stand," he rasped, "but that would be a
    foolish waste of valuable material... I shall turn the two of you over to the
    Dweller in the pool!"

    Dorothy Lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin''s thin lips writhed in a snarling
    smile...

    "Who, or what, is the Dweller in the pool?" demanded Kent, "And what devil''s
    work is Carlin doing here anyway?"

    "The Dweller in the pool," Dorothy answered, her low voice trembling, "is my brother,
    Raoul!" ...

    Small wonder that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should combine
    to taint the very air with a shuddering miasma of crepitant dread!

    That "My brother, Raoul!" gets me every time.

    I am pleased to report, via Odd Ends, that another Wells story has been added
    at Project Gutenberg. In Devil Crystals Of Arret, young Larry faces a six-hour
    deadline of death, plus rat-men, octopus-bats, eldritch music and tinkling devil
    crystals! So alluring is the prospect of wallowing in a Wellsian miasma, I have
    had to put on hold my plan to read the umpteen volumes of John Ruskin''s Fors
    Clavigera : Letters To The Workmen And Labourers Of Great Britain, a work Guy
    Davenport suggested is comparable only to Tristram Shandy in its magnificent eccentricity.

    The Sun newspaper--yes, The Sun!--once commanded its readers "Go thee to H P Lovecraft
    and shudder!" Excellent advice, you''ll agree, and I would like to echo it by
    recommending you do the same with Hal K Wells. A few more of his tales are available
    online here.
