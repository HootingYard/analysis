  text: 'There is a tonsured buffoon I know, whose head is always inclined at an unnerving
    angle. His neck, I think, must be a supple one. He tells me, often, shouting at
    me from a distance of only a few inches, that he has startling capacity in one
    of his lungs, and almost none in the other, and that from day to day, sometimes
    even from hour to hour, there is a sudden switch, the lung that was capacious
    becoming clogged, and vice versa. To his own satisfaction, he has ascribed this
    to a pneumatic curiosity within his being. He says, or rather shouts, that it
    causes him no discomfort, and he has on no occasion discussed it with a doctor
    of medicine. I have asked him if in addition he has a hydraulic peculiarity, but
    answer comes there none, for he is not the most skilful of conversationalists.
    Even when leaning against a mantelpiece at a cocktail party, a situation where
    one might expect him to make some effort, he remains silent, his head at that
    odd angle, until someone comes close up to him, a few inches away. That is when
    he begins shouting. He has the piercing eyesight of a seagull, so myopia is not
    the explanation for his conduct. He shouts about matters other than his lungs,
    and can even be amusing, for instance when mimicking the sound of blotting paper
    being dragged across a pinboard. If one accepts that he will never answer a question
    directly put to him, nor hold his head at a reassuring angle, he can prove a splendid
    companion.

    And of course there is his tonsure, which he keeps smooth by shaving it morning
    and evening, and rubbing into it an ointment of his own recipe. He has also been
    known to dye it gold, or sometimes blue, as the fancy takes him. He claims neither
    the tonsure itself nor his dyeing of it has any ritual significance, that it is
    mere whim. Funny kind of whim, I say. Others say the same, and less politely.
    There is much muttering that the tonsure is symbolic of something, that the changes
    in the colour of the dye, at those times it is applied, relate to the moon and
    the tides, or to the gestation period of squirrels, or to cycles yet unknown to
    cosmologists. Whether the buffoon is aware of such talk or not is a moot point.
    It is not something he has ever shouted about, while leaning against a mantelpiece
    or otherwise.

    We were all surprised when he was placed under arrest. Crime of any kidney was
    the last thing one would associate with him. He was held in one of the fortresses
    which border the main square, but which one, ah, now that was a mystery. Their
    different purposes are announced only by the flags hung outside them, each of
    which is, in its own way, a masterpiece of decorative obfuscation. The sentries
    are mute. There are no windows on the lower floors, and those higher up are of
    frosted glass. It goes without saying that they are bulletproof, and proof against
    any other projectile, including the fist of a man clad in chain mail, hanging
    from a winch attached to an illegal helicopter. That man was me, actually, in
    a mad escapade from which I somehow emerged with body and soul intact.

    With the protracted absence of my friend, I sank into melancholy. I missed his
    close range shouting and that''s a fact. Then one day, years later, his head,
    still at that unnerving angle on his neck, appeared on our postage stamps. But
    the tonsure was gone! I could not fathom, nor could any of us, what these two
    startling developments meant. The mutterings, long unmuttered, started up again,
    with some desperation. When the morning carts clattered through the portcullises
    of the fortresses on Thursdays, we gathered in the square, wondering if we would
    see our old friend being carried upon one, dressed in finery perhaps, a sceptre
    held aloft, or bound and gagged and on his way to the gallows. But week followed
    week, and we saw only the usual mix of nobles and criminals, sometimes even sharing
    a cart. By the turn of the year we stopped going to the square altogether, and
    remained huddled in our chalets, playing games of lanternjaw or spite, smoking
    our pipes, and swatting at flies.

    I never forgot the buffoon, though I fear some of my colleagues did. I kept a
    collection of the postage stamps upon which his head had appeared, long after
    it was supplanted by new issues, showing the moon and the stars and pregnant squirrels
    and up and coming cosmologists. Those I did not collect. Nor did I ever find out
    what had become of my shouty, difficult pal. Until, on my deathbed, yesterday,
    or possibly the day before, he appeared hovering in a haze above my head. His
    mouth moved as if he was shouting, but there was no sound. I never learned to
    read lips, so I do not know what this shade or phantom or whatever it was was
    trying to tell me. Just before it vanished, in a sort of vaporous bursting, I
    saw that the angle of the head was no longer weirdly askew, indeed it was perfectly
    straight, or upright, but that the tonsure had reappeared, and it was golden again,
    oh so golden, and I was blinded by it.'
