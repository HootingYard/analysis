  text: "Bear with me while I quote once again from Fors Clavigera by John Ruskin,\
    \ but this is wonderful. One's only regret is that there is no illustration of\
    \ the work described.\n[I]t happened that on the very day on which I published\
    \ my last letter, I had to go to the Kensington Museum ; and there I saw the most\
    \ perfectly and roundly ill-done thing which, as yet, in my whole life I ever\
    \ saw produced by art. It had a tablet in front of it, bearing this inscription,\
    \ \u2013\n\u201CStatue in black and white marble, a Newfoundland Dog standing\
    \ on a Serpent, which rests on a marble cushion, the pedestal ornamented with\
    \ pietra dura fruits in relief.\u2014English. Present century. No. I.\u201D\n\
    It was so very right for me, the Kensington people having been good enough to\
    \ number it \u201CI.,\u201D the thing being almost incredible in its one-ness\
    \ ; and, indeed, such a punctual accent over the iota of Miscreation,\u2014so\
    \ absolutely and exquisitely miscreant, that I am not myself capable of conceiving\
    \ a Number two, or three, or any rivalship or association with it whatsoever.\
    \ The extremity of its unvirtue consisted, observe, mainly in the quantity of\
    \ instruction which was abused in it. It showed that the persons who produced\
    \ it had seen everything, and practised everything ; and misunderstood everything\
    \ they saw, and misapplied everything they did. They had seen Roman work, and\
    \ Florentine work, and Byzantine work, and Gothic work ; and misunderstanding\
    \ of everything had passed through them as the mud does through earthworms, and\
    \ here at last was their worm-cast of a Production,\nFrom Letter V. Whitethorn\
    \ Blossom"
