  text: 'Mr Key would like to draw to your attention a small exhibition at the National
    Portrait Gallery. Fabiola is a collection of mostly "amateur" portraits of Saint
    Fabiola, collected over the years by the Flemish artist Francis AlA?s. They are
    all based on a single source, a now lost 19th century painting, which means they
    look almost identical--but they''re not, of course. The effect of seeing them
    all gathered together in a couple of rooms is quite mesmerising. The official
    gallery page is here, and there is a photograph of an earlier showing in New York
    here.
