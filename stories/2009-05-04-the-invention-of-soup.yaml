  text: "As noted a few days ago, I have now begun reading Ruskin's Fors Clavigera.\
    \ Its eccentricity, adverted to by Guy Davenport, has already become apparent.\
    \ Here is an extract from Letter II, The Great Picnic.\nI. That the strength of\
    \ Hercules is for deed, not misdeed ; and that his club\u2014the favourite weapon,\
    \ also, of the Athenian hero Theseus, whose form is the best inheritance left\
    \ to us by the greatest of Greek sculptors, (it is in the Elgin room of the British\
    \ Museum, and I shall have much to tell you of him\u2014especially how he helped\
    \ Hercules in his utmost need, and how he invented mixed vegetable soup)\u2014\
    was for subduing monsters and cruel persons, and was of olive-wood.\n(My emphasis.)\n\
    It may be that my classical education is scanty, but I had no idea mixed vegetable\
    \ soup was invented by Theseus. I am hoping, with undisguised excitement, that\
    \ Ruskin keeps his promise and tells me more about this in a subsequent letter.\n\
