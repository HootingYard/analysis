  text: "As noted a few days ago, I have now begun reading Ruskin's Fors Clavigera.\
    \ Its eccentricity, adverted to by Guy Davenport, has already become apparent.\
    \ Here is an extract from Letter II, The Great Picnic.\nI. That the strength of\
    \ Hercules is for deed, not misdeed ; and that his club--the favourite weapon,\
    \ also, of the Athenian hero Theseus, whose form is the best inheritance left\
    \ to us by the greatest of Greek sculptors, (it is in the Elgin room of the British\
    \ Museum, and I shall have much to tell you of him--especially how he helped Hercules\
    \ in his utmost need, and how he invented mixed vegetable soup)--was for subduing\
    \ monsters and cruel persons, and was of olive-wood.\n(My emphasis.)\nIt may be\
    \ that my classical education is scanty, but I had no idea mixed vegetable soup\
    \ was invented by Theseus. I am hoping, with undisguised excitement, that Ruskin\
    \ keeps his promise and tells me more about this in a subsequent letter.\n "
