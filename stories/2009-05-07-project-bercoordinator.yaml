  text: "Long-term readers, and those who regularly frequent the 2003\u20132006 Archive,\
    \ will be aware that in those distant days Hooting Yard had a certain ramshackle\
    \ charm. Mr Key had to be dragged kicking and screaming to use a proper blog format,\
    \ though clearly there are innumerable benefits in terms of indexing and commenting\
    \ and so on. It was the lack of any helpful method of navigation that led to the\
    \ old site having what was rightly called an \u201CUnhelpful Index\u201D.\nNow,\
    \ through the titanic efforts of Glyn Webster, the 2003\u20132006 Archive has\
    \ been helpfully indexed. Readers can zip to any item at the click of a mouse.\
    \ This also means Mr Key can refer you back to some age-old piece without having\
    \ to use that increasingly annoying instruction to \u201Cgo to the page and scroll\
    \ down\u201D.\nMr Webster's work is very much appreciated, and it seems all good\
    \ Yardists ought to spend a few days, or weeks, or even months scrubbling around\
    \ in the Archive to dig out their favourites, or to discover things they didn't\
    \ even know were there.\nNOTE\_: The link in the sidebar now directs straight\
    \ to what Mr Webster calls Project \u1E7Abercoordinator. He has also provided\
    \ this handy diagram:\n"
