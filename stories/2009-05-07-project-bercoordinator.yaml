  text: 'Long-term readers, and those who regularly frequent the 2003-2006 Archive,
    will be aware that in those distant days Hooting Yard had a certain ramshackle
    charm. Mr Key had to be dragged kicking and screaming to use a proper blog format,
    though clearly there are innumerable benefits in terms of indexing and commenting
    and so on. It was the lack of any helpful method of navigation that led to the
    old site having what was rightly called an "Unhelpful Index".

    Now, through the titanic efforts of Glyn Webster, the 2003-2006 Archive has been
    helpfully indexed. Readers can zip to any item at the click of a mouse. This also
    means Mr Key can refer you back to some age-old piece without having to use that
    increasingly annoying instruction to "go to the page and scroll down".

    Mr Webster''s work is very much appreciated, and it seems all good Yardists ought
    to spend a few days, or weeks, or even months scrubbling around in the Archive
    to dig out their favourites, or to discover things they didn''t even know were
    there.

    NOTE : The link in the sidebar now directs straight to what Mr Webster calls Project
    Ubercoordinator. He has also provided this handy diagram:
