  text: 'You will be pleased to hear that I have been indefatigable, over the last
    couple of days, in my mermaid research. In a bunker deep underground, I was able
    to view several hours of footage from various demonstrations, hoping to spot a
    committed member of the social justice movement, in other words a mermaid, being
    clubbed senseless, possibly even to death, by a brutish copper or two. Well, when
    I say that is what I was hoping to see, I do not mean that I was excited by the
    prospect of watching a semiaquatic being being roughed up by the forces of law
    and order, rather if that is what I did see it would confirm mermaids'' status
    as committed members of the social justice movement. Are you still with me? This
    isn''t particularly complicated stuff, but I am having some difficulty explaining
    myself. Though I must say it was fun to write a grammatically correct sentence
    containing two adjacent "being"s. Anyway, to my infinite regret the footage was
    shaky and blurry and I couldn''t make anything out in detail, so I am still unable
    to reach a definitive mermaid conclusion. What I do have, courtesy of OSM, is
    a photograph of a gathering of mermaids, perhaps protesting in favour of world
    peace or against capitalism. Neither George Galloway nor Annie Lennox, say, is
    visible in the picture, so it''s hard to be sure what exactly the mermaids are
    making a fuss about. Careful study of the photo will be necessary, through a microscope,
    which I shall have to borrow from my next door neighbour, a somewhat perplexing
    individual with cake-crumbs in his beard. He is often reluctant to respond to
    my urgent hammerings at his door, so please be patient and I will return to this
    important topic when I have something concrete to report.
