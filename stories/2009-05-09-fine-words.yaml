  text: 'I am having to stop myself from copying out vast swathes of Ruskin''s Fors
    Clavigera for your entertainment and edification. How can you not love a writer
    who refers in passing to looking something up "in one of my thirteenth-century
    Bibles"? Here, in any case, are a few lines from Letter XXIII, The Labyrinth:

    [H]aving been obliged to write too young, when I knew only half truths, [I] was
    eager to set them forth by what I thought fine words. People used to call me a
    good writer then; now they say I can''t write at all; because, for instance, if
    I think anybody''s house is on fire, I only say "Sir, your house is on fire;"
    whereas formerly I used to say , "Sir, the abode in which you probably passed
    the delightful days of youth is in a state of inflammation," and everybody used
    to like the effect of the two p''s in "probably passed," and of the two d''s in
    "delightful days".

    I do like them... probably too enthusiastically.'
