  text: "I am having to stop myself from copying out vast swathes of Ruskin's Fors\
    \ Clavigera for your entertainment and edification. How can you not love a writer\
    \ who refers in passing to looking something up \u201Cin one of my thirteenth-century\
    \ Bibles\u201D? Here, in any case, are a few lines from Letter XXIII, The Labyrinth:\n\
    [H]aving been obliged to write too young, when I knew only half truths, [I] was\
    \ eager to set them forth by what I thought fine words. People used to call me\
    \ a good writer then; now they say I can't write at all; because, for instance,\
    \ if I think anybody's house is on fire, I only say \u201CSir, your house is on\
    \ fire;\u201D whereas formerly I used to say , \u201CSir, the abode in which you\
    \ probably passed the delightful days of youth is in a state of inflammation,\u201D\
    \ and everybody used to like the effect of the two p's in \u201Cprobably passed,\u201D\
    \ and of the two d's in \u201Cdelightful days\u201D.\nI do like them\u2026 probably\
    \ too enthusiastically."
