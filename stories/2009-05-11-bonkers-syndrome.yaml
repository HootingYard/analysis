  text: "Call me a hypochondriac if you will, but I fear I have succumbed to a highly\
    \ dangerous syndrome so baffling to medical science it has not yet been given\
    \ a proper name. Boffins in their underground labs have taken to calling it \u201C\
    bonkers\u201D, for the chief\u2014and so far only\u2014symptom is that victims\
    \ finds themselves agreeing with Peter Hitchens. The terrifying thing is that\
    \ it can be a progressive illness, where at first one nods in perplexity that\
    \ the columnist's words match one's own thoughts, almost anomalously, until towards\
    \ the end the patient has to be carted away, raving. Yesterday I had a definite\
    \ twitch of the early stage condition, when I read this:\nStephen Fry, in an interminable\
    \ article in a London lifestyle magazine, complains that he doesn't like being\
    \ called a \u2018Quintessential Englishman\u2019.\nGlad to hear it. No danger\
    \ of that happening to him here. In this column, he\_ is regarded as a Quintessential\
    \ Left-wing Luvvie, swollen by years of fashionable flattery into absurd prominence.\n\
    I'd also like to popularise the description once given of him in The Dictionary\
    \ Of National Celebrity: \u2018A stupid person's idea of what an intelligent person\
    \ is like.\u2019\nI've been longing to say this since he (an educated man with\
    \ a duty to take the side of the civilisation that sustains him) rallied to the\
    \ defence of the coarse barbarian oaf Jonathan Ross."
