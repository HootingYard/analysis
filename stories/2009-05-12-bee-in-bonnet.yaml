  text: 'There is always a risk, at Hooting Yard, of creeping monomania. A bee finds
    its way into my bonnet, and buzzes about. Fortunately for readers, and for my
    own sanity, the bee tends to buzz off after a few hours or days and things get
    back to normal.

    That by way of preamble to a note which might lead some to think this place has
    become AntiFry Central. The Most Intelligent Life-Form In The Known Universe was
    interviewed on BBC''s Newsnight yesterday--mercifully briefly--about the MPs''
    expenses hoo-hah. He claimed that everybody, including himself, fiddled their
    expenses, that it was nothing to get worked up about, and that making a fuss about
    it was "bourgeois". (This while suited and booted in black tie for some event
    he was attending.) Oh, how we vomited here at Haemoglobin Towers!

    I have a new heroine, however. Back in the studio, discussing the same topic,
    the MP Kate Hoey referred contemptuously to "that actor, whoever he is" and how
    he was talking twaddle. Gold star for her.'
