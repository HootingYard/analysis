  text: "There is always a risk, at Hooting Yard, of creeping monomania. A bee finds\
    \ its way into my bonnet, and buzzes about. Fortunately for readers, and for my\
    \ own sanity, the bee tends to buzz off after a few hours or days and things get\
    \ back to normal.\nThat by way of preamble to a note which might lead some to\
    \ think this place has become AntiFry Central. The Most Intelligent Life-Form\
    \ In The Known Universe was interviewed on BBC's Newsnight yesterday\u2014mercifully\
    \ briefly\u2014about the MPs\u2019 expenses hoo-hah. He claimed that everybody,\
    \ including himself, fiddled their expenses, that it was nothing to get worked\
    \ up about, and that making a fuss about it was \u201Cbourgeois\u201D. (This while\
    \ suited and booted in black tie for some event he was attending.) Oh, how we\
    \ vomited here at Haemoglobin Towers!\nI have a new heroine, however. Back in\
    \ the studio, discussing the same topic, the MP Kate Hoey referred contemptuously\
    \ to \u201Cthat actor, whoever he is\u201D and how he was talking twaddle. Gold\
    \ star for her."
