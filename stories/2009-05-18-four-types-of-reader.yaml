  text: 'An eighteenth-century subscription library in London* divided its readers
    into four categories: the Sedate, the Historian, the Theatrical Amateur, and the
    Gay and Volatile.

    If I can destroy the blockage which has made Hooting Yard fall silent in recent
    days, I shall devise a quiz so you can work out which type of reader you are.

    *NOTE : Not the London Library (see above).'
