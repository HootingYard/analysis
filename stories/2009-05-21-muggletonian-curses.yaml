  text: 'Immediately after God''s revelation on the third, fourth, and fifth of February
    1652 to John Reeve that he and his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton were the "Two Last
    Witnesses"...

    "There followed a period of hectic blessing and cursing which could have been
    lifted straight from the pages of Edwards''s Gangraena. A few examples will convey
    the flavour. John Robins, and a rival prophet [Thomas] Tany, were cursed and destroyed.
    A man called Pearson smote blows on Muggleton''s head; ten days later he was dead.
    At a Ranter tavern in the Minories Reeve placed his head on the ground for an
    enemy to trample upon. The infidel''s foot was arrested in flight. He could not
    go through with it. Muggleton noted ''the people all marvelled at this thing''.
    Barker tricked Reeve into blessing him, but was then exposed and damned by Muggleton.
    An over-zealous follower called Cooper cursed fifteen fellow silk-weavers off
    his own bat. The cynical Captain Stasy arranged dinner for the prophets with Goffin,
    a divine. The dinner ended with a predictable damnation for the clergyman."

    From The World Of The Muggletonians, Christopher Hill, Barry Reay, William Lamont
    (1983).

    Elsewhere we discover that Lodowicke Muggleton was himself cursed by that saintly
    Quaker William Penn: "To the bottomless pit are you sentenced, from whence you
    came, and where the endless worm shall gnaw and torture your imaginary soul to
    eternity." I am not clear whether this curse was pronounced before or after Muggleton
    published a pamphlet with the resounding title The Neck Of The Quakers Broken
    (1663).'
