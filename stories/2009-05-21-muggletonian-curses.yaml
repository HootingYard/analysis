  text: "Immediately after God's revelation on the third, fourth, and fifth of February\
    \ 1652 to John Reeve that he and his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton were the \u201C\
    Two Last Witnesses\u201D\u2026\n\u201CThere followed a period of hectic blessing\
    \ and cursing which could have been lifted straight from the pages of Edwards's\
    \ Gangraena. A few examples will convey the flavour. John Robins, and a rival\
    \ prophet [Thomas] Tany, were cursed and destroyed. A man called Pearson smote\
    \ blows on Muggleton's head; ten days later he was dead. At a Ranter tavern in\
    \ the Minories Reeve placed his head on the ground for an enemy to trample upon.\
    \ The infidel's foot was arrested in flight. He could not go through with it.\
    \ Muggleton noted \u2018the people all marvelled at this thing\u2019. Barker tricked\
    \ Reeve into blessing him, but was then exposed and damned by Muggleton. An over-zealous\
    \ follower called Cooper cursed fifteen fellow silk-weavers off his own bat. The\
    \ cynical Captain Stasy arranged dinner for the prophets with Goffin, a divine.\
    \ The dinner ended with a predictable damnation for the clergyman.\u201D\nFrom\
    \ The World Of The Muggletonians, Christopher Hill, Barry Reay, William Lamont\
    \ (1983).\nElsewhere we discover that Lodowicke Muggleton was himself cursed by\
    \ that saintly Quaker William Penn: \u201CTo the bottomless pit are you sentenced,\
    \ from whence you came, and where the endless worm shall gnaw and torture your\
    \ imaginary soul to eternity.\u201D I am not clear whether this curse was pronounced\
    \ before or after Muggleton published a pamphlet with the resounding title The\
    \ Neck Of The Quakers Broken (1663)."
