  text: 'While I have fallen silent due to blockage of the inspirational funnels in
    my cranium--about which more later--the media has been merrily obsessed with MPs
    and their expenses. I have been following all the details with far more intensity
    than is advisable for a sensible person. Today, I wish simply to leap to the defence
    of the Tory Sir Peter Viggers, who claimed APS1645 for a floating duck island.
    This seems to me to be a legitimate and imaginative use of taxpayers'' money,
    quite unlike such abuses as moat-cleaning, mortgage interest, and food--except
    food for ducks, which is fine.
