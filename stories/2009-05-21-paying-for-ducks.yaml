  text: "While I have fallen silent due to blockage of the inspirational funnels in\
    \ my cranium\u2014about which more later\u2014the media has been merrily obsessed\
    \ with MPs and their expenses. I have been following all the details with far\
    \ more intensity than is advisable for a sensible person. Today, I wish simply\
    \ to leap to the defence of the Tory Sir Peter Viggers, who claimed \xC2\xA31645\
    \ for a floating duck island. This seems to me to be a legitimate and imaginative\
    \ use of taxpayers\u2019 money, quite unlike such abuses as moat-cleaning, mortgage\
    \ interest, and food\u2014except food for ducks, which is fine.\n"
