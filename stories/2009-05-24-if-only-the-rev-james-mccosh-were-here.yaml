  text: "I must admit to being perplexed at my uninspired state. I have been tapping\
    \ the keyboard in a desultory way before abandoning the few lines of guff that\
    \ result, or, more commonly in recent days, feeling a reluctance even to begin\
    \ tapping. And the reason I am puzzled is that much of my reading, at the moment,\
    \ is of a writer whom I find fantastically inspiring.\nI decided to immerse myself\
    \ in the eight volumes of Fors Clavigera after coming across Guy Davenport's lament\
    \ that nowadays, hardly anyone reads John Ruskin. Well, I had never read him,\
    \ and I thought I would have to fight my way through these ninety-six letters\
    \ \u201Cto the workmen and labourers of Great Britain\u201D (one each month for\
    \ eight years), the reading being a challenge rather than a pleasure. Ah, but\
    \ what a pleasure lay in store\u2014and still does, as I am currently just halfway\
    \ through volume five.\nRuskin is a magnificent writer, not least in his ability\
    \ to veer off at unexpected angles. One minute he will be ranting about the iniquities\
    \ of industrialisation, then he will launch into a transcription of what he readily\
    \ admits is a fairly dull folk story about Swiss peasants, before reminding himself\
    \ that he meant to write about glacier theory.\n\u201CIf only the Rev. James McCosh\
    \ were here!\u201D begins a paragraph, for no apparent reason. I adore the surprise\
    \ and the sheer ease of his prose. You can sense the whirrings of the gigantic\
    \ and eccentric Ruskin-brain as he flits from topic to topic, but somehow never\
    \ quite gets lost. He writes about barging into someone's cottage to wish a happy\
    \ new year \u201Cto whoever was there\u201D, has some thoughts on the proper education\
    \ of children, and suddenly embarks on a sustained passage about the nature of\
    \ bees, what he does and doesn't know about them, and pauses to rummage among\
    \ his bookcases looking up bee information in Bingley, Cassell, Petter, Galpin,\
    \ and Ormerod. The latter's History Of Wasps, he decides, ought to be a standard\
    \ book in the primary education of girls.\nAm I so awestruck by Ruskin that his\
    \ prose intimidates rather than inspires me? I don't think that's the case. Anyway,\
    \ I have regular fads and enthusiasms for writers. I once read about a dozen novels\
    \ by Nabokov one after another, in a frenzy, with no ill effects. So I shall remain\
    \ vaguely perplexed, but try my best to start tapping away again with bluster\
    \ and vim. If all else fails, I shall have to summon the phantom of the Rev. James\
    \ McCosh from out of the shadows."
