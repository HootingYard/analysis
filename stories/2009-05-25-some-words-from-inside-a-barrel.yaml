  text: 'Mr Key has lately been described, elsewhere, as a "Diogenesian recluse".
    There is an element of truth in this. How many readers were aware that the material
    at Hooting Yard issues forth from inside a barrel, or large tub? Now you know.

    NOTE : For those following the link above, further details of The Fatal Duckpond--in
    the form of a blatant advertisement--will appear here when it is actually available
    (soon, as far as I''m aware).'
