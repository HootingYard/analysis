  text: '"Then next, take canal life as a form of ''university'' education. Your present
    system of education is to get a rascal of an architect to order a rascal of a
    clerk-of-the-works to order a parcel of rascally bricklayers to build you a bestially
    stupid building in the middle of the town, poisoned with gas, and with an iron
    floor which will drop you all through it some frosty evening; wherein you will
    bring a puppet of a cockney lecturer in a dress coat and a white tie, to tell
    you smugly there''s no God, and how many messes he can make of a lump of sugar.
    Much the better you are for all that, when you get home again, aren''t you?"

    John Ruskin, Fors Clavigera, Letter LXXV "Star Law" (1877)'
