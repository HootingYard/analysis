  text: "There are times, I think, when the gods who order our puny human affairs\
    \ take their lead from Hooting Yard. How else to explain this magnificent headline?\n\
    MP Blunkett injured in cow attack\nIncidentally, it is somewhat disconcerting\
    \ that the BBC feels it necessary to qualify the numinous Blunkett name with the\
    \ designation \u201CMP\u201D, as if there might be other newsworthy Blunketts\
    \ in the known universe. There are not.\nI am going to go on a little trip now.\
    \ I will be gone only for a couple of days, and will return in time for this week's\
    \ Hooting Yard On The Air at teatime on Thursday. I live in hope that a brief\
    \ change of scene, and the thought of that cow, will loosen up the cranial integuments,\
    \ the knotting of which has caused such regrettable silence of late."
