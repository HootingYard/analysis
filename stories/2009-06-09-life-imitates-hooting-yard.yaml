    MP Blunkett injured in cow attack

    Incidentally, it is somewhat disconcerting that the BBC feels it necessary to
    qualify the numinous Blunkett name with the designation "MP", as if there might
    be other newsworthy Blunketts in the known universe. There are not.

    I am going to go on a little trip now. I will be gone only for a couple of days,
    and will return in time for this week''s Hooting Yard On The Air at teatime on
    Thursday. I live in hope that a brief change of scene, and the thought of that
    cow, will loosen up the cranial integuments, the knotting of which has caused
    such regrettable silence of late.'
