  text: "Should you find yourself consulting your hare oracle with unseemly frequency,\
    \ or favouring it to such an extent that your crow oracle sits neglected on the\
    \ shelf, you may be on the slippery slope to a hare mania leading to criminality.\
    \ Here is a newspaper cutting from 1904. Consider it a warning.\nHARES HIS RUIN\n\
    In sentencing a man at Marylebone yesterday for stealing a hare, Mr Plowden said\
    \ to the prisoner, who had previously been bound over for a similar offence: \u201C\
    You are an honest man, I believe, except when you see hares. Then, your honesty\
    \ completely breaks down. It's a good thing you don't live where hares are abundant.\u201D\
