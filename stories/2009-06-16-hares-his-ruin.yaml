  text: 'Should you find yourself consulting your hare oracle with unseemly frequency,
    or favouring it to such an extent that your crow oracle sits neglected on the
    shelf, you may be on the slippery slope to a hare mania leading to criminality.
    Here is a newspaper cutting from 1904. Consider it a warning.

    HARES HIS RUIN

    In sentencing a man at Marylebone yesterday for stealing a hare, Mr Plowden said
    to the prisoner, who had previously been bound over for a similar offence: "You
    are an honest man, I believe, except when you see hares. Then, your honesty completely
    breaks down. It''s a good thing you don''t live where hares are abundant."
