  text: "\u201CLet the joy be unconfined!\u201D says Chris Cutler, with good reason.\
    \ For his ReR Megacorp has just released the second album by Vril, entitled The\
    \ Fatal Duckpond. Before we go any further, follow this link to buy your copy,\
    \ immediately. When you come back, read on.\nThe original trio of Cutler (drums),\
    \ Lukas Simonis (guitars), and Bob Drake (bass & guitars) is augmented this time\
    \ by Pierre Omer (guitars). Very sensibly, the puckish combo asked Mr Key to come\
    \ up with the album and track titles, and to contribute liner notes and illustrations.\
    \ Here, as a special treat for Hooting Yard readers, are those liner notes. It\
    \ should be noted that the emboldenment and italicisation of certain words were\
    \ inserted by Mr Cutler, or one of his minions, to excellent effect.\n\nThese\
    \ notes are reproduced with permission from Beekeepers Write About Compact Discs\
    \ magazine (a weekly periodical).\nAs far as I can ascertain, the second album\
    \ by the band VRIL has been made without any bee involvement whatsoever. These\
    \ eighteen new waxings by the group\u2014now a quartet\u2014form the soundtrack\
    \ to the European arthouse film classic The Fatal Duckpond.. Seven hours long,\
    \ black and white, and silent for large s t r e t c h e s apart from these musical\
    \ numbers and sparse patches of dialogue mumbled in an incoherent and invented\
    \ language, the film is a visionary reworking of the 1956 Hollywood western The\
    \ Bloodsoaked Revenge Of Escobar Beppo, itself an adaptation of a rare and little-performed\
    \ Jacobean drama whose author was stabbed to death in a brawl and whose corpse\
    \ was flung into the then stinking Thames.\nImportantly, VRIL have based their\
    \ \u201Cgroovy sounds\u201D\u2014I think that is the appropriate term\u2014on\
    \ all three sources. This does make it rather difficult to pinpoint exactly which\
    \ bit of the plot, or plots, is being evoked in each piece. To take just one example,\
    \ the fourth track, Baffling Calcium Lantern Light, could refer equally well to\
    \ the barnyard scene in the new film, the \u201CCasa Incognita\u201D episode in\
    \ the western, or indeed the bit in the Jacobean drama where the audience always\
    \ shuddered.\nMuch as it would be helpful to summarise the plot, of one or all\
    \ of the sources, it has to be said that it is a hopeless task. The original Jacobean\
    \ tragedy is a skein of untangleable knots, the western is dense and brooding,\
    \ and the latest film is frankly incoherent, in the best sense of the word. How\
    \ the director managed to pull the whole thing together without any bees or beekeepers\
    \ is a triumph, albeit a strange one.\nAh yes, the director. Rumour has it that\
    \ behind the person who appears in the (interminable) credits lurks the eerie\
    \ figure of Horst Gack. It was he who was really pulling the strings, he who took\
    \ the play and the western and decided to transform them into something quite\
    \ unprecedented. It is said that he pored over all known texts of the drama for\
    \ over a decade, and sat through thousands of screenings of the western, sometimes\
    \ alone, and sometimes accompanied by his mysterious wife and collaborator Primrose\
    \ Dent. It may even be that the whole thing is the brainchild of Primrose herself.\
    \ Certainly it was she who got VRIL on board to create the musical soundtrack.\
    \ She tracked the band down to a squalid cafeteria in Pointy Town, where they\
    \ had been retained as the regular afternoon entertainment. The cafeteria clientele,\
    \ an intriguing jumble of matelots, Jesuits, pin cushion sales reps, mountebanks,\
    \ prestidigitators, and\u2014yes\u2014beekeepers, were so distraught when they\
    \ learned that Primrose planned to whisk the band away to expensive rehearsal\
    \ studios in a Swiss canton that they rioted. Wily Primrose filmed the brouhaha\
    \ and inserted the raw footage into the finished version of The Fatal Duckpond.\
    \ Unfortunately for us, she shot without sound, so the band were unable to incorporate\
    \ the din of shouting, thumping, smashing and whatnot into the piece accompanying\
    \ this section of the film.\nAll in all, despite its perplexing beelessness, this\
    \ is a tremendous album, even for those who have never seen the film to which\
    \ it acts as a soundtrack. And quite honestly, the listener is probably better\
    \ off not having to sit through hours of bad acting, blurry visual effects, gruesome\
    \ smudgy charcoal burnings, blank screens, hectoring rants from unseen crew members,\
    \ and still shots of daffodil-strewn fields.\nNOTE\_: It occurs to me that newer\
    \ readers may be unaware of the earlier Vril release, Effigies In Cork. You will\
    \ find an informative note about it here, but one of the links appears to be out\
    \ of date, so to buy your copy, go here."
