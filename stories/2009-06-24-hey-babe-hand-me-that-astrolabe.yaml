  text: '"Swinburne... boasted to Burne-Jones that he had ''discovered the one serious
    rhyme in the language'' to ''babe'', which was, not very helpfully, ''astrolabe''."

    Mollie Panter-Downes, At The Pines : Swinburne And Watts-Dunton In Putney (1971).

    I was directed to this magnificent and eccentric book by Nige, who also provides
    a link to Max Beerbohm''s account of his Putney visit.'
