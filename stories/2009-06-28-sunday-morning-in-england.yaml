  text: "Rediscovered Urban Rituals, who helped to organise a May Day Jack in the\
    \ Green procession in Deptford in 2006, recreated the famous Charlton Horn Fair\
    \ procession today.\nThe Abbot of Bermondsey granted a charter in 1268 for an\
    \ annual fair to be held at Charlton, which was eventually banned in 1872 for\
    \ \u2018licentious conduct\u2019. The celebrants dressed up in drag and adorned\
    \ themselves with horns and masks, presumably evoking ancient ritual & fertility\
    \ symbolism. The procession of \u2018Hornified Fumblers\u2019 traditionally met\
    \ at Cuckold's Point in Rotherhithe, after crossing the Thames from the City.\
    \ They paraded through Deptford and Greenwich and on to the Fair.\nWhat better\
    \ way for Mr Key to spend his Sunday morning than to trail in the procession's\
    \ wake, albeit dressed in mufti?\n\n\nSnapper\_: Pansy Cradledew Photographic\
    \ Interventions GmbH. Mezzotints of the snaps will be made available in the fullness\
    \ of time."
