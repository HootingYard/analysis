  text: 'In an 1845 issue of The Mysteries Of London, G W M Reynolds provided a useful
    list of the sorts of items available from unregulated street-stalls in the districts
    of Spitalfields and Bethnal Green, "entire streets that are nought but sinks of
    misery and vice--dark courts, foetid with puddles of black slimy water--alleys,
    blocked up with heaps of filth, and nauseating with unwholesome odours... abodes
    of sorrow, vice, and destitution... vile streets, inhabited by the very lowest
    of the low, the most filthy of the squalid, and the most profligate of the immoral".

    Had you been among the most filthy of the squalid, you could have taken your pick
    from stalls selling "fish, fresh and fried, oysters, sweet-stuff, vegetables,
    fruit, cheap publications, sop-in-the-pan, shrimps and periwinkles, hair-combs,
    baked potatoes, liver and lights, curds and whey, sheep''s heads, haddocks and
    red-herrings".

    I for one would be only too pleased to see sop-in-the-pan on sale in our major
    supermarkets, even if it were pre-packaged under their own brand.'
