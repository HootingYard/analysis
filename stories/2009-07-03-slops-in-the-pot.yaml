  text: "Reynolds mentions slop-in-the-pan, but not that almost identical item of\
    \ Victorian cuisine, slops-in-the-pot. Each had its adherents, its devotees. There\
    \ was a sort of tribal loyalty to one dish or the other, so that brawls in taverns\
    \ or dens of vice, or out in the stinking streets, might be occasioned by the\
    \ \u201Cwrong\u201D answer to the challenge \u201Care ye a potman or a panner?\u201D\
    \nVictorian readers were so familiar with the rivalry between the two that it\
    \ drives the plot of many novels of the era. In Pallid Ada, The Crippled Heiress,\
    \ for example, the eponymous heroine is torn between her guardian, a slop-in-the-pan\
    \ man, and her suitor, who favours slops-in-the-pot. I haven't actually read the\
    \ book myself, so I can't tell you how things work out. It is just one of a great\
    \ pile of novels referred to in a majestic academic study of fictional slop and\
    \ slops from the Victorian era that I borrowed from the library but had to take\
    \ back because umpteen other borrowers had reserved it. I wish now I had photocopied\
    \ some of the more startling bits.\nOn the face of it, one would think slops-in-the-pot\
    \ won out over slop-in-the-pan every time. After all, with the former you're getting\
    \ more than one kind of slop presented in a presumably ceramic pot, whereas the\
    \ latter promises just a single slop still in the pan in which it was boiled.\
    \ I suppose what we have here is an echo of the eternal battle between Cavaliers\
    \ and Roundheads, hedonists and puritans. The louche and foppish Victorian man-about-town\
    \ with his decisive cravat and gaudy cuffs would plump for multiple slops in a\
    \ decorative pot, while the severe hawk-faced miseryguts groaning under the weight\
    \ of self-imposed moral strictures would deny himself anything but a simple slop\
    \ in a simple pan.\nIf I still had my library book I could copy out its summary\
    \ of the plot of another novel, or rather part-work, A Canker In The Belly Of\
    \ The Immoral Maniac Husband, or The Ruination Of Captain Purvis. In this piece\
    \ of virtually unreadable tosh, seemingly hundreds of characters, whom we have\
    \ difficulty keeping track of, devour endless pots of slops and pans of slop,\
    \ chapter after chapter, in between taking part in scenes of unimaginable vice\
    \ and degradation, not the least of which is the tying of a tin can to the tail\
    \ of an orphaned puppy. They don't write 'em like that anymore, for which perhaps\
    \ we should be thankful.\nNOTE\_: Reynolds refers to sop-in-the-pan, not slop-in-the-pan.\
    \ My mistaken recollection, twenty-four hours after typing up the original quotation,\
    \ clearly makes a nonsense of this entire piece. But I refuse to apologise. My\
    \ short-term memory may be in as ruinous a state as Captain Purvis's domestic\
    \ hearth, but I shall carry on regardless, contemptuous of brickbats, and I have\
    \ no doubt that I shall prevail, in the end, whenever an end may come."
