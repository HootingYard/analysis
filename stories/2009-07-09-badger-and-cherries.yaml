  text: 'Important news from Reuters'' Berlin bureau:

    A badger in Germany got so drunk on overripe cherries that it staggered into the
    middle of a road and refused to budge, police said yesterday. A motorist telephoned
    police near the central town of Goslar to report a dead badger lying in the road--only
    for officers to turn up and discover that the animal was alive and well, but drunk.
    Police later discovered that the badger had eaten cherries from a nearby tree
    which had fermented and given the animal diarrhoea as well as a hangover. Having
    failed to scare the animal away, officers eventually used a broom to chase it
    from the road.

    What the report fails to mention is that the "animal" in question was Little Severin,
    The Mystic Badger. How in heaven''s name do you think he is able to make all those
    devastatingly accurate mystic prognostications? Painting him as a simple drunk
    is a travesty. Little Severin had, of course, gorged on fermented fruit as a trusted
    method of inspiring a shamanistic--or rather, shabadgeristic--hallucinogenic trance.
    I must admit it is not entirely clear why he then chose to sprawl in the middle
    of an Autobahn, imperilled by the products of the mighty Teutonic car industry,
    rather than engage in his usual scrubbling about in the muck, but far be it from
    me to question the ineffable wisdom of Little Severin. After all, the last person
    who did so was turned into a toad, and not just a toad, but a blind toad with
    rickets and pins and needles. As, indeed, was foretold, by the Mystic Badger himself,
    during an earlier cherry binge.'
