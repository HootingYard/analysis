  text: We already knew there was a hen called Tiny Enid. Now it has come to my attention
    that, in the USA, there is a Dalmatian puppy also named after the plucky tot.
    Matt and Mandy (whomsoever they may be) are to be congratulated on their excellent
    pet-naming skills. Visit their Drop My Straw blog and you can see both a photo
    and a video of the canine Tiny Enid.
