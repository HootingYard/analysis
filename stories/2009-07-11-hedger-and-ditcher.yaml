  text: 'My father was a hedger and ditcher. My mother did nothing but spin, but hers
    is a tale for another time. In those long years of hedging and ditching, my father
    learned much, perhaps too much, about the birds that nest in hedges and the creeping
    things that slither in ditches. With infantile enthusiasm, I used to tell my father
    he should write a book about the birds and the creeping things. Sometimes, when
    I babbled so, he grunted. Sometimes he coughed up phlegm and spat it into the
    embers. And sometimes he boxed my ears. Or rather, ear, for I was born with but
    one, on the left side of my head. Where the right ear ought to have been there
    was a patch of fur, rough and bristly fur, in the shape of a hoof. That, like
    my mother and her endless, demented spinning, is a tale for another time.

    My father was not a bookish man, so the idea that he should write about the life-forms
    he found in his hedges and ditches was outwith his wits. Strictly speaking, he
    was not illiterate. He could write his name, and the name of my mother, and possibly
    even my name, and he was familiar I think with the formation of the words hedge
    and ditch and bird and creeping and thing, and of some others, such as toadstool
    and post office and President Nixon. And he could read, though the only book I
    ever saw him pore over, tongue lolling out of his mouth, was Atlas Shrugged by
    Ayn Rand. In the few leisure hours he enjoyed, he preferred to paint vast inexplicable
    apocalyptic landscapes, in oils or watercolour or gesso. They were artistically
    worthless, according to the tastes of the time, and of all times, and he knew
    as much. Nonetheless, he had me give his paintings Latin titles, to lend them,
    he hoped, an air of profundity. I never told him that my Latin was ill-taught,
    by Mistress Pilbeam, and ill-learned, and thus would be laughed at by elegant
    nobs in salons, had ever any of his paintings been hung in one. As it was, they
    were stacked, slowly rotting, in a spare barn on a farm along the lane, forgotten.

    I know only too well that others have written of birds in hedges, and creeping
    things in ditches, with greater facility than my father could ever muster. And
    yet, when I stand at his tombstone, every Friday afternoon, clutching my little
    fistful of chrysanthemums, I weep for that unwritten book. I weep, too, because
    what I know about hedges and ditches, and the birds and the creeping things that
    nest and slither within them, would not make a sentence, nor a paragraph, let
    alone a mighty, timeless tome such as my father could have written. What do we
    do, when we know what is lost?'
