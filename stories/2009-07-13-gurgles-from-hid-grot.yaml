  text: "If Charles Montagu Doughty (1843\u20131926) is remembered today at all, it\
    \ is as the author of Travels In Arabia Deserta, a classic account of his wanderings\
    \ in northern Arabia, published in 1888. One hesitates to call it influential,\
    \ for it is written in a highly-wrought, archaic, often quite bonkers style that\
    \ is probably inimitable. But it has, at least, been more or less constantly in\
    \ print since T E Lawrence enthused about it in the 1920s\u2014unlike Doughty's\
    \ later works, mad epics written in verse so chunky and chewy and Anglo Saxon\
    \ they make virtually anything else read like pointyhead management-guff.\nThe\
    \ titles include The Dawn In Britain (Volume One of which has been recently reissued,\
    \ I discover with glee), Adam Cast Forth, The Titans, and Mansoul, Or The Riddle\
    \ Of The World. For your edification and enlightenment, Mr Key has picked some\
    \ of his favourite lines and phrases from Book One of the last-named. [Sic] throughout,\
    \ by the way, all checked and re-checked.\nSun-stricken inhuman wasteful ground\n\
    I heard, hoarse murmuring tumult as of sea / Deeps long-maned wave-rows, beating\
    \ boisterous; / And rushing billows, like to raging scour / Of ravening wolves;\
    \ wide whelming on sea-cliffs. / And creaking-winged mews\u2019 clamour, cleping\
    \ loud,/ O'er long fore-shore\nOf human souls such multitude He comprised; / As\
    \ clustered blebs, some greater and some less; / We see oft in wind-driven floc\
    \ of foam, / In day of storm, on some tempestuous strand.\nI slumbered till a\
    \ turtles\u2019 gentle flock, / \u2026 folding from flight / Their rattling wings;\
    \ lighted on vermeil feet; / Jetting, with mincing pace, their iris necks; / With\
    \ crooling throat-bole; voice of peace and rest\nGurgles from hid grot\nBroods\
    \ o'er these thymy eyots drowsy hum\nThey sound their shrill small clarions /\
    \ And hurl by booming dors, gross bee-fly kin\nDawns shrill medleyed babble of\
    \ early birds ; / And Summers breath, in the bleak poplar leaves.\nWhence fuming\
    \ incense doth embalm his brain\nHewed as we sea-shells see within appear. / Whereon\
    \ were laced, with curious device / Of antique art, in purple leathern work ;\
    \ / Buskins, whose shining knops were Albans gold.\nThese unhewn sunless labyrinthine\
    \ crypts\nThe temple-maiden had aforetime scruzed, / Nepenthe and clary and moly\n\
    A croc of nard, set on an aumbry shelf\nNeath crumpled boughs, aye dripping baleful\
    \ mist! / On sleep-compelling canker-worts beneath, / Black hellebore and rank-smelling\
    \ deadly dwale / And bryony, and other more, I know not well ; / The Furies\u2019\
    \ garden-knots ; whose snaky entrailed / Locks, wrapped about my feeble knees\
    \ and feet."
