  text: 'Over at Gourmet, the splendidly-named and obviously A 1/4 bertrendy Adam
    Brent Houghtaling has had the bright idea of applying Brian Eno''s Oblique Strategies
    in the kitchen. Here at Hooting Yard, of course, we do not need the assistance
    of the man we know as Brain One (anag.) to inspire our culinary bagatelles. Here
    is the latest recipe from occasional contributor Fatima Gilliblat.

    Boiled (or Broiled) Conger Eel with Sandwich Paste and Brazil Nuts

    Take one fully-grown adult conger eel of handsome parts. Rinse it thoroughly in
    freezing cold water, then dab it dry with a large rectangular beach towel.

    Fill an eel-shaped pan with water, place on the hob! hob! hob! and bring to the
    boil (or broil). Plunge the conger eel into the seething liquid in one easy, elegant,
    yet startling movement. Add a dash of ground pepper. Leave to simmer for 45 minutes.

    Transfer the boiled (or broiled) conger eel onto a platter. Open a medium-sized
    jar of sandwich paste and spoon the entire contents onto the eel. Use a butter
    knife to spread the paste so it coats pretty much the whole topside. Place under
    the grill and toast for ten minutes, or until the colour of Turbinado sugar.

    Toss a few brazil nuts onto the platter, and serve. Best eaten with bare hands,
    tearing the conger eel to shreds, in a sort of frenzy, while listening to the
    Missa Luba on your hi-fi.'
