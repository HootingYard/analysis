  text: "Herewith Chapter 49 of Pallid Ada, The Crippled Heiress:\nCountless fathoms\
    \ deep, far far below the roiling ocean waves upon which our battered leaking\
    \ ship is pitched and tossed, down, down in the black depths at the very sea bed,\
    \ in a crevice of a rock encrusted with a billion years of salty encrustment,\
    \ what wonders would we see, lit by the glow of fat eerie beings that pulsate\
    \ and drift in the undersea world! Directly below our ship, far, far below, nestled\
    \ in the crevice, there is a man! Dressed in garb half tattered black cloth half\
    \ trailing weed, he is breathing freely, from his perfume bottle atomizer air\
    \ bulb invention. Around him are gathered ranks of aquatic beings, the finned\
    \ and the tendrilled, the suckered and the eyeless, the translucent and those\
    \ that are mere blobs. They are rapt. For, with glubs and gurgles, the man is\
    \ preaching to them the Word of the Lord. The man is none other than Alonzo Plunkett,\
    \ the kindly Christian gentleman we last saw being dragged into the sea from a\
    \ deserted stretch of British beach in the lobster-like claws of a sea monster!\n\
    It is with the aid of compass and sextant and stout-hearted prayer that we have\
    \ dropped anchor at the very spot, in the vastness of the oceans, below which\
    \ the semi-amphibious benefactor of Pallid Ada, the Crippled Heiress, is converting\
    \ the denizens of the deep. Following his briny abduction, a committee of seaside\
    \ worthies raised funds for a voyage to go in search of Plunkett. No better captain\
    \ could we have than the terrifying and God-fearing retired Admiral Pipstrew.\
    \ Poring over his charts, sucking on his pipe, beseeching the Lord, our captain\
    \ has steered us hither and thither for six long years, following the most fleeting\
    \ of clues, until now the prize is in our grasp!\nAuks and guillemots wheel madly\
    \ in the sky above our ship as, out on deck, crewmen Totteridge and Whetstone\
    \ laboriously engarb themselves in the very best shiny brass Victorian diving\
    \ gear. The captain stands to one side, his highly-polished peg leg glistening\
    \ in the sunlight. Having at the last affixed to their helmets unfeasibly extensive\
    \ lengths of pneumatic rubber tubing, the crewmen topple over the side, but not\
    \ before Admiral Pipstrew booms out a hymn, and we all join in. And then, first\
    \ Totteridge, then Whetstone, are gone, vanished below the waves. We can but wait\
    \ for their return, Alonzo Plunkett safe and sound in the net they carry between\
    \ them.\nSound, did I say? However kindly, however Christian, however expert in\
    \ the geological treasures of the British coastline, how sound can a man be after\
    \ spending six years in the blackest deep, his only company the weird aquatic\
    \ life-forms that God, having made, at once condemned to remain submerged in the\
    \ depths of the blue tumultuous waters? From poop to orlop, as we wait, there\
    \ are mutterings that the Plunkett restored to the world of men will be a twitching\
    \ and shattered glubb-glubbing wreck, drooling brine, his once fine bouffant shockingly\
    \ tangled with weed and sea-scum. The tension mounts, and we busy ourselves with\
    \ abstruse nautical activities, as our captain broods on the bridge, absent-mindedly\
    \ prising barnacles off a stray timber plank.\nNight falls. Night at sea is very\
    \ different to night on land. Better writers than I, immeasurably better, have\
    \ evoked the arresting aura of the sea-night. So much greater are they, the very\
    \ air around them is rarefied and pure and I am not fit to breathe an atom of\
    \ it. If ever I were to meet such a writer, which I would not, but if, say, I\
    \ was mistakenly invited to a swish cocktail party at which one was present, I\
    \ would expect to be squashed beneath their boot like a mite. I am but a humble\
    \ jack tar, eking my sorry living in the rigging, scribbling prose in my too few\
    \ idle moments, smudging the brine-soaked pages as I sweep from them the crumbs\
    \ of the hard tack biscuits that fall from my caried gob.\nDawn breaks, and still\
    \ there is no sign of Totteridge and Whetstone. Dawn at sea offers a very different\
    \ prospect to dawn on land. There are great painters whose canvases will show\
    \ you why. My own daubs, done with the dregs from tins of ship emulsion, will\
    \ not.\nOur only means of communication with the two crewmen gone below to rescue\
    \ Alonzo Plunkett is a coded system of tugs to the ropes to which they are attached.\
    \ It had been thought prudent not to extend the complexity of the system by adding\
    \ a series of secondary tugs to their pneumatic rubber tubing, as a single misjudged\
    \ tug might disrupt their air supply and consign them to a watery death. Admiral\
    \ Pipstrew, who has not slept, is ready to command one tug on the ropes, to signal,\
    \ as previously arranged, \u201CIs Almighty God keeping you safe from harm in\
    \ the immensity of His fathomless oceans?\u201D But he stays his hand when an\
    \ eagle-eyed cabin boy pipes up to announce that both Totteridge's and Whetstone's\
    \ ropes are being tugged from below. And as we look, indeed they are, not merely\
    \ tugged but yanked, pulled with main force, so threatening to topple the mast\
    \ to which they are lashed. That mast is the mainmast, so as it topples, the ship\
    \ itself will keel over. We are in mortal danger!\nWhatever is tugging those ropes\
    \ has inhuman strength. Our captain has to decide whether to sacrifice two of\
    \ his crew for the good of all. But a night without sleep has scattered his wits,\
    \ and he delays too long. With a last mighty heave, the ship is overturned, and\
    \ every man jack of us is tossed into the sea.\nOur descent to the depths is calm\
    \ and dreamlike. There is no panic, no thrashing about, no bobbing to the surface\
    \ for a last hopeless gulp of air before plunging again. We sink, every one of\
    \ us, slowly and peacefully, until we land, with scarce a bump, on the sea bed.\
    \ And there before us, in translucent shimmers, we see Alonzo Plunkett, and Totteridge,\
    \ and Whetstone, and any number of fantastic marine life-forms, greeting us with\
    \ glub-glub hosannahs, in the undersea paradise built with his bare hands by the\
    \ kindly Christian gentleman during six years of hard subaquatic toil, to the\
    \ glory of God."
