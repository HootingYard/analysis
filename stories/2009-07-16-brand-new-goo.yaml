  text: "They must have been putting something in Fatima Gilliblat's cornflakes. We\
    \ don't hear from her for many a moon, but now, hard on the heels of her latest\
    \ recipe comes this thrilling letter:\nPantsil, Mr Key! [This is the form of greeting\
    \ Fatima always uses, for reasons lost in the fog of doo-dah.] Finding myself\
    \ at a loose end, and unnerved by inexplicable clunks, I thought it would be a\
    \ good idea to bury myself in research. As you know, I have long been fascinated\
    \ by mystic foods devoured by mystic beings, so I trotted off to the library chat\
    \ \u2018n\u2019 snack zone to consult some reference works. I was wondering what,\
    \ if anything, was the connection between the manna sent down from heaven for\
    \ the Israelites, in the books of Exodus and Numbers, and ambrosia, as munched\
    \ by the gods of Greek mythology. It had also occurred to me that there may be\
    \ a link to the mess of pottage for which Esau sells his birthright in Genesis.\
    \ Yes, yes, I know most authorities would have it that Esau's mess was some kind\
    \ of lentil stew, but I have never been afraid to fly in the face of accepted\
    \ wisdom, nor indeed to fell sacred cows with my girly fists. I learned a thing\
    \ or two from the matchless deeds of Tiny Enid, you know.\nHaving silenced the\
    \ chattering, snacking, mobile phone wittering teenage hoi polloi with a thunderbolt,\
    \ I spent some happy hours poring over mystic texts. Pore, pore, pore, that was\
    \ me, brows furrowed in concentration, scribbling notes in my recipe ideas notebook.\n\
    You will be pleased to hear that the result of my studies is a brand new Fatima\
    \ Gilliblat recipe for what I was going to call The Goo Of The Gods, until it\
    \ struck me that violent monotheists might take the usual umbrage and I could\
    \ end up being cast into the outer darkness or beheaded. So I settled on God Goo.\
    \ For the time being I have decided to keep it a secret formula, like Coca Cola,\
    \ although I hasten to add that God Goo has nothing whatever in common with that\
    \ tooth-rotting fizzy pop.\nMy current plan is to unveil this wondrous goo in\
    \ a ten-part television series called Fatima Gilliblat's Spiritually Uplifting\
    \ Goo Kitchen Paradise. Keep an eye on the schedules."
