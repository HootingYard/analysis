  text: 'He has been represented as the most fascinating and accomplished of men.
    A member of the select and exclusive Jockey Club of Paris, and a foreign and honorary
    member of our own fashionable Travellers'' Club here, he was at first represented
    as one of the elite of society--the observed of all observers--the pink of fashion
    and the mould of form--"a gentlemanly-looking man of fifty-five," who did not
    merely drive a gig and graduate in respectability in such a middle-class way,
    but was an honoured guest in the saloons of exiled princes, and having easy access
    to the tables of the noblest of our countrymen, he appeared to live upon a social
    eminence which might have provoked jealousy, but which freed him from any suspicion
    of heinous criminality. On the other hand he has been represented, with perhaps
    equal exaggeration, to have been certainly a parvenu, and perhaps a bore. He is
    said to have been the son of a glove-maker, and to have had, in his own person,
    some mysterious commercial connection with button-making, and to have either acquired
    his title by the purchase of a small Italian estate which conferred that empty
    distinction upon him, or else to have been the last plebeian metamorphosed into
    an aristocrat by the will and pleasure of the late Louis Philippe. It is doubtless,
    as a matter of gossip, interesting to that curious individual, the general reader--but
    it is a matter of perfect indifference in an English court of law whether the
    accused is the undoubted scion of a family dating from the Deluge, or the most
    pushing, irrepressible, and objectionable of that terrible section of society,
    who are described as "distinguished foreigners".--The Morning Chronicle, 22 July
    1861

    Some barons fancy they may do as they like in England. This is rather a mistake.--The
    Illustrated News Of The World, 29 July 1861
