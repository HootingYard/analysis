  text: 'I went to sea in a fishing smack, and I dangled a net over the side, and
    I caught, among minnows and weed, a cod. Then I steered for shore. At the quayside,
    I hurried to my chalet and I slapped the cod on my tabletop and, with great savagery,
    I gutted it with my bare hands, exposing its innards. I took the liver over to
    the draining-board, where I had ready a glass jar into the neck of which I''d
    stuck a funnel. I squeezed and squeezed the liver until my fists ached, until
    every last drop of oil had dripped down the funnel into the jar. Then I threw
    the funnel away and took a big iron spoon, and I poured oil out of the jar onto
    the spoon and inserted the spoon in my mouth and I drank the oil greedily, desperately,
    gurglingly.

    And that, my syphilitic friends, is how I preserve my health, and why I can gambol
    ''cross the greensward with the zip and vim of a monkey, when the fancy takes
    me.'
