  text: "I went to sea in a fishing smack, and I dangled a net over the side, and\
    \ I caught, among minnows and weed, a cod. Then I steered for shore. At the quayside,\
    \ I hurried to my chalet and I slapped the cod on my tabletop and, with great\
    \ savagery, I gutted it with my bare hands, exposing its innards. I took the liver\
    \ over to the draining-board, where I had ready a glass jar into the neck of which\
    \ I'd stuck a funnel. I squeezed and squeezed the liver until my fists ached,\
    \ until every last drop of oil had dripped down the funnel into the jar. Then\
    \ I threw the funnel away and took a big iron spoon, and I poured oil out of the\
    \ jar onto the spoon and inserted the spoon in my mouth and I drank the oil greedily,\
    \ desperately, gurglingly.\nAnd that, my syphilitic friends, is how I preserve\
    \ my health, and why I can gambol \u2018cross the greensward with the zip and\
    \ vim of a monkey, when the fancy takes me."
