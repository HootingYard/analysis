  text: "I regret to say that yesterday we overlooked an important anniversary here\
    \ at Hooting Yard. I refer not to the birthdays of Gilbert White (1720) or Tristan\
    \ Corbi\xE8re (1845), nor to the shuffling from this mortal coil of Machine Gun\
    \ Kelly (1954). Nor am I even drawing to your attention the incident at Chappaquiddick\
    \ (1969), though you may very well expect me to.\nNo, what we ought to have celebrated\
    \ yesterday with flags and bunting and possibly a primitive blood sacrifice was\
    \ the tenth anniversary of the first ever batch of smokers\u2019 poptarts going\
    \ on sale. This toothsome \u201Cbreakfast solution\u201D is rightly celebrated\
    \ by smokers and poptart lovers throughout the world, or what passes for the world\
    \ when seen through a fug of dense Madagascan cigarette smoke.\nTo commemorate\
    \ what social historians are already calling \u201Cthe smokers\u2019 poptart decade\u201D\
    , the manufacturers are issuing celebratory packets of brand new Wafer-Thin Organic\
    \ Potato-Trifle-Flavour Rectangular Ready-Toasted Smokers\u2019 Poptarts, including\
    \ a free gift with every purchase of a poptart-shaped ashtray made of unbaked\
    \ clay from the spooky quarry on Blodgett Island.\nLegally inescapable health\
    \ warnings on the packaging have been artfully subverted, thanks to top mezzotintist\
    \ Rex Tint, whose design incorporates mezzotints showing noteworthy historical\
    \ figures simultaneously smoking and stuffing smokers\u2019 poptarts down their\
    \ gullets."
