  text: 'I regret to say that yesterday we overlooked an important anniversary here
    at Hooting Yard. I refer not to the birthdays of Gilbert White (1720) or Tristan
    Corbiere (1845), nor to the shuffling from this mortal coil of Machine Gun Kelly
    (1954). Nor am I even drawing to your attention the incident at Chappaquiddick
    (1969), though you may very well expect me to.

    No, what we ought to have celebrated yesterday with flags and bunting and possibly
    a primitive blood sacrifice was the tenth anniversary of the first ever batch
    of smokers'' poptarts going on sale. This toothsome "breakfast solution" is rightly
    celebrated by smokers and poptart lovers throughout the world, or what passes
    for the world when seen through a fug of dense Madagascan cigarette smoke.

    To commemorate what social historians are already calling "the smokers'' poptart
    decade", the manufacturers are issuing celebratory packets of brand new Wafer-Thin
    Organic Potato-Trifle-Flavour Rectangular Ready-Toasted Smokers'' Poptarts, including
    a free gift with every purchase of a poptart-shaped ashtray made of unbaked clay
    from the spooky quarry on Blodgett Island.

    Legally inescapable health warnings on the packaging have been artfully subverted,
    thanks to top mezzotintist Rex Tint, whose design incorporates mezzotints showing
    noteworthy historical figures simultaneously smoking and stuffing smokers'' poptarts
    down their gullets.'
