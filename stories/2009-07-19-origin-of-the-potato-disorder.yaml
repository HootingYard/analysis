  text: "Here is another newspaper cutting quoted in Deadly Encounters\_: Two Victorian\
    \ Sensations by Richard D Altick, this one from the Illustrated Times, 10 August\
    \ 1861:\nThat some unusual endemic excitement has been at work, directing weak,\
    \ debauched, and diseased minds into a homicidal course, must be apparent to every\
    \ newspaper-reader. May not the electrical condition of the atmosphere exercise\
    \ some hidden power in this way over the human brain? A correspondent of the Standard,\
    \ Dr. J. Q. Rumball, a well-known lecturer on science, points out electrical causes\
    \ as the origin of the potato disorder. It is a fact that lately the finest mechanisms\
    \ of clockwork, notably those at the Observatory at Greenwich, have been going\
    \ wrong, without visible derangement or imperfection, and this has been attributed\
    \ to an abnormal condition of atmospheric electricity. It is surely not a wildly-hazardous\
    \ theory to suppose that a similar agency acting upon that most susceptible and\
    \ complex of galvanic machines, the human brain, may have some tendency, if not\
    \ to the actual increase of crime, of lessening the healthy power which restrains\
    \ its committal or of aggravating the phrenal disease which but for such influence\
    \ might have been subdued, or at least retarded."
