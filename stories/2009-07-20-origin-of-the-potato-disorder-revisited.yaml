  text: 'Trebizondo Culpeper snorted. His was a mighty snort, caused on this occasion
    by his reading, in the Standard, of the well-known science lecturer Dr. J. Q.
    Rumball''s theory that the origin of the potato disorder was of an electrical
    nature.

    Trebizondo Culpeper gathered about him a buzz of acolytes, keen young Trebizondo
    Culpeperists with bright eyes and intriguingly windswept hairstyles.

    "Hark!" boomed Trebizondo Culpeper, waving the newspaper aloft, "Rumball is spouting
    forth his electrical theory of the origin of the potato disorder. Never has it
    been clearer to me that it is wholly and utterly a matter of gas! Fan out, now,
    youngsters, fan out and spread the word!"

    And so the Trebizondo Culpeperists went each to his own cubicle, and took up his
    stylus, and scraped on flat sheets of gleaming Trebizondoculpeperite(tm) screeds
    to the Standard, and to other newspapers, and to magazines and journals and important
    institutions, discrediting Rumball and his theory and making the case for a gas
    origin of the potato disorder.

    In his eyrie, Trebizondo Culpeper beamed with glee. He ground the Standard under
    his boot, and he poked pins into a waxen doll of Dr. J. Q. Rumball, and he unscrewed
    the nozzle on his canister, and put the siphon to his plumpish bulbous lips, and
    he took a deep, deep draught of the gas.

    And when he exhaled, all about him shrivelled and withered and died. He clapped
    his hands, and called to an acolyte to bring him a platter of newly disordered
    potatoes.'
