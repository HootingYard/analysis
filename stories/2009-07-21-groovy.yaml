  text: 'Dear Frank, writes Tim Thurn, It has long been apparent to me that Hooting
    Yard is by far the grooviest website on the planet. But how do I actually get
    down with its groove? Any tips would be most welcome.

    Tim is not the only person to ask this, or a similar, question. Boffins in a groovelab
    high in the Swiss mountains have spent years--or is it mere days?--trying to isolate
    the Hooting Yard Groove, for the betterment of humanity, while Mrs Gubbins has
    been indefatigable in her attempts to express the essence of the groove in the
    form of knitted tea-cosies. Every single time she picks up her needles she fails,
    fails better, but she goes on, she must go on, she can''t go on, she goes on.
    We will soon have to build a new depot for all those groovy tea-cosies, unless
    we can find a charitable foundation prepared to accept them.

    But are Tim Thurn and Mrs Gubbins and those Swiss boffins asking the wrong questions?
    Is there, in fact, a groove to be found? For the true horror may be that the grooviness
    is entirely superficial, and there is nothing behind it.

    Some would have it that such absence of groove is unthinkable. The boffins, for
    example, having invested a huge amount of Swiss currency in retorts and alembics
    and bunsen burners and rubber tubing and bakelite knick-knacks and Coddington
    lenses, not to speak of elbow grease and sweat and pipe tobacco, would be unmoored,
    cast adrift upon a sea of cognitive anguish, were they to entertain the idea of
    there not being a groove. I am less fretful on behalf of Tim and Mrs Gubbins,
    for I know that both of them have other resources, the one a button fetish and
    the other a predilection for criminal mayhem. If they could but accept they will
    never get with the putative groove, Tim would be happy as a pig in muck with his
    buttons, and Mrs Gubbins could round up the old gang and embark upon a series
    of armed robberies.

    Conversely, of course, there is a Hooting Yard Groove, a groove so groovy it outgrooves
    every other groove ever dreamed up by the grooviest of groovers. Surely I would
    know about it?, you ask. Well, not necessarily. Take as an example Dennis Beerpint.
    Ever since the incorrigibly twee versifier transformed himself into a beatnik,
    he has been, unarguably, the grooviest poet who ever lived. I say "unarguably"
    because there is not a soul who doubts this, not even Michael Horovitz. And yet
    Beerpint prances about the streets and coffee bars and milk bars and jazz clubs
    and happenings of his adopted world blithely unaware of his own irrefrangible
    grooviness. It is true that he makes much of his goatee beard, polo neck sweater,
    and hornrims, and that his trousers of choice are of the drainpipe variety, yet
    he remains free of affectation, almost childishly innocent, and reassuringly inept.
    But if anybody is down with the groove, daddy-o, it is Dennis Beerpint.

    If it is the case that a Hooting Yard Groove truly exists, it is of a different
    order of grooviness to the Beerpint Groove. The two do not quite cancel each other
    out, but they cannot happily coexist in the same grooveosphere. Mrs Gubbins demonstrated
    this when she tried to knit a dual-groove tea-cosy and became so thoroughly entangled
    in stray skeins of wool that she had to be carted off to a clinic.

    And on that cautionary note, I think I will leave it. Tim Thurn may remain in
    the dark about the groove he seeks, but that is the way with a groove. Once you
    stop looking, you might just find it. Or, if not, you can go and sprawl in a ditch
    and stare at the sky. It is immense, and blue, and spattered with clouds.'
