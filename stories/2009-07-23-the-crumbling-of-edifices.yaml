  text: 'Watching an edifice crumble can provide a salutary lesson. I do not mean
    the sorts of lessons government ministers are fond of announcing have been or
    will be learned following the latest debacle. Such announcements are merely the
    craven bleatings of incompetents. Andy Burnham springs to mind. How I wish he
    didn''t! No, the lessons we can learn from seeing with our own eyes the crumbling
    of an edifice are of a wholly different kidney.

    I speak from experience, having witnessed the crumbling of many, many edifices,
    the mighty and the modest, in my career as CEO of Crumbling Edifice Solutions.
    Before we go any further, let me acknowledge that "Crumbling Edifice Solutions"
    is something of a misnomer. Our role is not to "solve" the crumbling of an edifice,
    by which I suppose one might mean nipping the crumblement in the bud, or at least
    trying to slow its relentless progress towards utter devastation and ruin. We
    make no such claims. What we do, with consummate swish, is to watch edifices crumble.
    We act as witnesses.

    Let us say you know of an edifice that has begun to crumble. A hasty metal tapping
    machine message to one of our satellite bureaux dotted around the globe will have
    one of our agents on site within minutes, setting up a deckchair or camping stool
    slap bang next to the edifice, equipped with a pair of opera glasses or prismatic
    viewfinder. Our agent will fix a dispassionate gaze upon the crumbling edifice
    until it is nought but dust, scattered in the wind. In most cases, an edifice
    will crumble over many years, even generations, and thus we have in place a flawless
    system whereby agents work in relays, one replacing another as and when necessary,
    for example in the event of toilet breaks, lapses of attention, or death.

    At the point of complete crumblement, or CC as we call it in our organisational
    jargon, the agent on duty will stash their opera glasses or prismatic viewfinder
    in a pippy bag, fold up the deckchair or camping stool, and return to the satellite
    bureau via funicular railway. All our offices are high above sea level, for up
    in the empyrean the air is purer and thinner and conducive to la-la. Back at their
    desk, the agent ponders the lesson learned from watching the crumbling of the
    edifice, and writes a report. This is where their swish really comes into play,
    for our agents are recruited not just for their crumblement observation skills,
    but for their ability to write prose that has undeniable swish. When complete,
    the report is bound in greaseproof wrapping and lodged in our archive, a purpose-built
    edifice higher above sea level than even the highest of our bureaux, a granite
    fortress, remote and inaccessible, with a tower, at the top of which is my own
    office, from where I oversee the inevitable becrumblement of all that ever was
    and is and will be.'
