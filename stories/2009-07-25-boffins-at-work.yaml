  text: "[Originally posted on Friday 24 July]\nBoffins are at work mucking about\
    \ with the Hooting Yard website to ensure its continued gorgeousness for years\
    \ to come. While they go poking and prodding around in its innards, you may note\
    \ some hiccups. Fear not. As Julian of Norwich said, \u201Call will be well, and\
    \ all will be well, and every manner of thing will be well\u201D.\_ Very sensible\
    \ woman, that Julian. Had a pet cat."
