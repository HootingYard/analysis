  text: 'The boffins have now completed their work, and so exquisite has it been that
    you lot won''t even know anything has happened. But, by the long grey beard of
    Methuselah, it has! New Hooting Yard may look identical to old, tired, dull, pasty-faced
    Hooting Yard, but it is revivified and a-throb. Steam was pouring out of the funnels
    late into the night. I saw it with my own eyes.

    Actually, a couple of vague traces of the boffins'' work are apparent. The three
    postages from yesterday have had to be reposted, and I have added the original
    date in the interests of fanatical and pointless accuracy. Also, any comments
    made on those postages have vanished into the murk, so I would ask readers who
    spent hours crafting their pearls of wisdom to type them out again and repost
    them.

    It is at times like this we all ought to whistle along to Time, forward! by Gyorgy
