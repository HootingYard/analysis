    The bread I eat in London, is a deleterious paste, mixed up with chalk, alum,
    and bone-ashes ; insipid to the taste, and destructive to the constitution...

    The milk... should not pass unanalysed, the produce of faded cabbage-leaves and
    sour draff, lowered with hot water, frothed with bruised snails, carried through
    the streets in open pails, exposed to foul rinsings discharged from doors and
    windows, spittle, snot, and tobacco-quids from foot-passengers, over-flowings
    from mud-carts, spatterings from coach-wheels, dirt and trash chucked into it
    by roguish boys for the joke''s sake, the spewings of infants, who have slabbered
    in the tin-measure, which is thrown back in that condition among the milk, for
    the benefit of the next customer ; and finally, the vermin that drops from the
    rags of the nasty drab that vends this precious mixture, under the respectable
    denomination of milkmaid.

    I shall conclude this catalogue of London dainties, with that table-beer, guiltless
    of hops and malt, vapid and nauseous ; much fitter to facilitate the operation
    of a vomit, than to quench thirst and promote digestion ; the tallowy rancid mass
    called butter, manufactured with candle-grease and kitchen stuff ; and their fresh
    eggs, imported from France and Scotland.
