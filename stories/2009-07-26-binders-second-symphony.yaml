  text: 'Much as one admires the scholarship evident in his magisterial survey of
    the forty-nine Binder symphonies, one cannot help wishing the writer had given
    a bit more weight to the true masterpieces. Even the most enthusiastic of Binderists,
    among whom I count myself, is forced to admit, sooner or later, with a gun pointed
    at one''s temple, that there is chaff among the wheat, lead among the gold, cacophonous
    racket among the celestial choirs. While it is true that some people prefer the
    cacophonous racket, they tend to be trendy wankers with hornrim glasses and goatee
    beards, and their opinions can be dismissed with a contemptuous flourish of the
    cravat. Untie the cravat from around your neck before attempting to flourish it.

    Had I been asked to write about Binder''s symphonies, for example, I would have
    had much more to say about the second than that it "is based on the sound of winches".
    Much, much more. But I was not asked. Despite my having a broader, more profound,
    and pretty damned unbeatable knowledge and appreciation of Binder and all his
    works, I was passed over in favour of some upstart, who is probably about twelve
    years old and knows next to nothing.

    I bet this callow young Binderist is ignorant of the fact that, in preparing his
    difficult second symphony, the composer decamped to a remote rustic haven to get
    it together in the country. That is why he became so obsessed with trying to mimic
    the sound of winches using glockenspiel and bassoon and cheese-grater. He was
    listening, day by day, to farmyard winches, winching muck into or out of slurries,
    or similar manoeuvres familiar to our agrarian brethren and sistren. I cannot
    pretend to any useful knowledge of farmyard doings, for I am as urban as I am
    urbane. So much is obvious from the way I wear my cravat. But, you see, I can
    make the imaginative leap, I can place myself in that country cottage next to
    the old barn where Binder got his shit together, man. I can, if you will, inhabit
    Binder''s brain.

    The critic Chumpot made an ambiguous comment about the fourteenth symphony, and
    paid with his life. Fuming Binder was so outraged by the pimple reference that
    he hired a hitman, who machine-gunned Chumpot as he skulked in the very same burning
    cities where Binder skulked as an orphan child. With my matchless ability to think
    and see and hear and feel exactly as Binder did, I am on my way to those cities
    now, by charabanc, and when I get there I will track down the contemptible young
    pup who had the gall to write about the forty-nine symphonies, and I shall bash
    him to death with a spade. I know it is what Binder would have wanted.'
