  text: 'Cardboard Adam stands hand in hand with cardboard Eve in front of a cardboard
    tree around which is twined a serpent of plasticine. Plasticine, too, are the
    fruits which hang from the cardboard branches of the tree. In truth, cardboard
    Adam and cardboard Eve are not so much holding hands as sharing a single hand
    between them, for they have been cut from a single sheet of cardboard. Cardboard
    Adam''s other hand is a plain cardboard hand, but to cardboard Eve''s other hand
    is stuck a glob of plasticine. It is not perfectly spherical, for a chunk has
    been taken from it. The suggestion is that cardboard Eve has bitten the chunk
    out of the plasticine fruit. Tiny glittering beads are sunk in the head of the
    plasticine serpent, and they give the impression that they are gazing at Eve''s
    cardboard hand.

    There is a little motor attached by wires to the balsa wood panel upon which cardboard
    Adam and cardboard Eve are posed. Depressing a knob on the motor switches it on
    and causes the panel, and thus the cardboard figures, to tremble. Their trembling
    is redolent of the terror they experience when the Lord informs them of their
    Fall.

    Over on the draining board, a third cardboard figure is lying flat. It has been
    daubed with a blotch of crimson paint, and punctured with a toothpick. This is
    cardboard Abel. Cardboard Cain has been chucked into a patch of filth out in the
    gutter, representing the Land of Nod.

    It took me two years to make my replica Eden, or Eden and Nod. It was time well
    spent. I am now going to use my leftover cardboard and plasticine to make a model
    of Pointy Town pier, including the bats and the goats and the crocus.'
