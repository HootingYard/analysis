  text: 'First we had Blodgett in the sewers, now Mr Key himself has been squelching
    through the subterranean murk. You can hear the results in an episode of Tunnel
    Vision on ResonanceFM--go here for further details, I am not sure in which week
    my troglodyte adventures will be broadcast, but you should listen to the entire
    series in any case. My thanks to Bruno Rinvolucri, who made the programmes, took
    me down into the sewers (at West Dulwich) and, more importantly, led me back to
    the surface again.
