    \ through the subterranean murk. You can hear the results in an episode of Tunnel\
    \ Vision on ResonanceFM\u2014go here for further details, I am not sure in which\
    \ week my troglodyte adventures will be broadcast, but you should listen to the\
    \ entire series in any case. My thanks to Bruno Rinvolucri, who made the programmes,\
    \ took me down into the sewers (at West Dulwich) and, more importantly, led me\
    \ back to the surface again.\n"
