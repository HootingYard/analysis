  text: '"There is a Doctor and his Fart that haue kept a foule stinking stirre in
    Paules Churchyard ; I crie him mercy, I slaundered him, he is scarce a Doctor
    till he hath done his Acts ; this dodipoule, this didopper, this professed poetical
    braggart hath raild vpon me, without wit or art, in certaine foure penniworth
    of Letters and three farthing-worth of Sonnets ; nor do I mean to present him
    and Shakerley to the Queens foole-taker for coatch-horses : for two that draw
    more equallie in one Oratoriall yoke of vaine-glorie, there is not vnder heauen...
    why thou arrant butter whore, thou cotqueane & scrattop of scoldes, wilt thou
    neuer leaue afflicting a dead Carcasse, continually read the rethorick lecture
    of Ramme Allie? a wispe, a wispe, rippe, rippe, you kitchin-stuffe wrangler!"

    Thomas Nashe (1567-1601), writing of the poet Gabriel Harvey in Strange Newes,
    of the Intercepting Certaine Letters (1593)'
