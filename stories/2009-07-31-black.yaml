  text: Perusing the shelves of my local branch of Periodicals & Other Ephemera R
    Us the other day, I noted the existence of a glossy magazine called Black Hair.
    On the cover was a photograph of a woman with black hair. Leafing through it,
    I saw it was stuffed full of other similar photographs, and although I did not
    read any of the articles, all of them seemed to focus exclusively on the particular,
    narrow topic of women with black hair. Being a man with almost entirely grey hair,
    I replaced the magazine on the shelf. Plainly, I was not the kind of reader it
    was aimed at. But then neither were some of the adjacent titles, which included
    Black Shirts, a magazine for the fascist community, Black Narcissus, for sexually
    frustrated nuns, and Black Pudding, which seemed to be devoted wholly to celebrating
    the coagulated and sausagised blood of pigs. I looked in vain for the publication
    I was seeking--Tiny Enid's favourite comic, Boo Boo's Hooba Nooba--turned on my
    heel, and headed on up the hill towards a clump of aspens, where I sat down and
    lit a cigarette and looked at aspens, in a clump.
