  text: 'Shenanigans aplenty at Hooting Yard yesterday, when I awoke to discover that
    your favourite website had been targeted by fiendish cybercriminals from the hacking
    community. Well, in truth I did not notice immediately, for I spent my earliest
    waking hour or so researching a forthcoming Little Ruskin adventure--one where
    he is admonished for jumping off his favourite box on a Sunday. When it became
    apparent that I was unable to make postages, and that other funny business was
    afoot, my first impulse was to call in Detective Captain Cargpan. The doughty
    copper has, I understand, recently added a cybercrime unit to his force, a team
    of toughies who intersperse roughing up suspects down in the basement with tippy-tapping
    impenetrabilia into their laptops. Their helpline, however, informed me that Cargpan
    had taken them on a team-building awayday to some kind of jazz-funk seaside resort
    bowling alley aromatherapy human rights retail and leisure fairground complex,
    funded by a new and exciting quango. Money well spent, say I, never begrudging
    a single penny diverted towards the personal development of Detective Captain
    Cargpan and his crew.

    I turned instead, as perhaps I ought to have done from the outset, to Hooting
    Yard''s own technoboffin, asking him to investigate. Tirelessly, he poked around
    in the digital innards of the website. It took all day to isolate the horrible
    truth--that an unkempt oik, as pockmarked as Stalin, somehow connected to Horst
    Gack and his mysterious wife and collaborator Primrose Dent, had tampered with
    Hooting Yard for his own nefarious ends. And those ends? Nothing less than a delusional
    attempt to undermine years of Dobson scholarship. Had the oik succeeded in his
    plan, the titles of every single out of print pamphlet by the titanic out of print
    pamphleteer would have been altered. Fake ones would have been invented, and passages
    deleted or rewritten or attributed to other, non-existent, pamphleteers. There
    would have been the perpetration of similar outrages, not least among them the
    recasting of Marigold Chew as mere figment.

    That none of this happened is due entirely to the technoboffin. Single-handedly,
    he has averted disaster, and preserved the reputation of Dobson. We all owe him
    our gratitude.'
