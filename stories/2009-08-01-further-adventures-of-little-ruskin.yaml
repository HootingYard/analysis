  text: 'See, children, this couple walking along the road. One is a tall, handsome,
    and very finely made woman, with a beautiful mild firmness of expression, the
    other a conceited little boy. Why, of course, it is Ma Ruskin taking a stroll
    with Little Ruskin. They walk straight past the toyshop window without a glance.
    Little Ruskin knows he will never be allowed the temptation of toys. But Ma Ruskin
    has promised to take him to a spot, somewhere between Herne Hill and Camberwell,
    where he may pick a pebble to take home with him. Little Ruskin loves his pebbles.

    As they turn a corner, Little Ruskin''s buoyant mood changes, however, for ahead
    of them loom the great granite walls of the Charitable Mercy Home For Crippled
    Tinies.

    "Can we increase the speed of our strolling, Ma, the quicker to be past this benighted
    cripplehaven?" pleads Little Ruskin.

    "We shall stroll at the pace the Lord intends," replies Ma Ruskin, not unkindly,
    but with her usual mild firmness.

    Little Ruskin begins to tremble.

    And then, children, out of the gates of the Mercy Home comes Little Ruskin''s
    worst nightmare! It is a diminutive girlie with a twisted, deformed spine, and
    her hair is in ringlets!

    "Aaaghh!" screeches Little Ruskin, shielding his eyes from the horrible sight
    and trying to hide himself in the folds of Ma Ruskin''s skirts.

    Ma Ruskin scolds her son for making such a din and a spectacle, and she turns
    him about and marches him home.

    "There will be no pebble for you today, Little Ruskin!" she says, mildly firm.

    And so, quaking with a mixture of disgust and horror, Little Ruskin ends up back
    at the house on the hill, forbidden even to jump off his favourite box.
