  text: 'Readers may be aware of my views on Twitter. Briefly, I ahbhor it, despite
    the vaguely ornithological resonance of its name. I am assured, however, that
    it is increasingly the medium through which people keep abreast of that which
    is critical to their leading a well-ordered life. And what could be more critical
    than the doings at Hooting Yard? I have therefore arranged--via the indefatigable
    technoboffin--for a "tweet" to be generated whenever a new item appears on this
    website, and whenever a new podcast becomes available from ResonanceFM. I will
    most assuredly not be tapping idiotic drivel in to Twitter every five minutes.

    If you wish to "follow" Hooting Yard, the stuff on Twitter appears at, unsurprisingly,
    @hootingyard

    NOTE : I will also use Twitter to draw attention to intriguing links, for example
    this one, about a cork-, gutta percha-, and linseed oil-based floor covering called
    Kamptulicon.'
