  text: "Readers may be aware of my views on Twitter. Briefly, I ahbhor it, despite\
    \ the vaguely ornithological resonance of its name. I am assured, however, that\
    \ it is increasingly the medium through which people keep abreast of that which\
    \ is critical to their leading a well-ordered life. And what could be more critical\
    \ than the doings at Hooting Yard? I have therefore arranged\u2014via the indefatigable\
    \ technoboffin\u2014for a \u201Ctweet\u201D to be generated whenever a new item\
    \ appears on this website, and whenever a new podcast becomes available from ResonanceFM.\
    \ I will most assuredly not be tapping idiotic drivel in to Twitter every five\
    \ minutes.\nIf you wish to \u201Cfollow\u201D Hooting Yard, the stuff on Twitter\
    \ appears at, unsurprisingly, @hootingyard\nNOTE\_: I will also use Twitter to\
    \ draw attention to intriguing links, for example this one, about a cork-, gutta\
    \ percha-, and linseed oil-based floor covering called Kamptulicon."
