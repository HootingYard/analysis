  text: "\u201CThere is a superstitious belief that swans cannot hatch their eggs\
    \ unless a storm is raging, the sky mad with lightning bolts and thunderclaps.\
    \ I suspect this is true, for on the countless occasions I have gone blundering\
    \ into swans\u2019 nests, I have never seen eggs hatching, and the weather has\
    \ invariably been balmy, for that is the kind of weather I prefer when blundering\
    \ about among the nests of swans.\u201D\nFrom Quite A Few Things I Know About\
