  text: '"There is a superstitious belief that swans cannot hatch their eggs unless
    a storm is raging, the sky mad with lightning bolts and thunderclaps. I suspect
    this is true, for on the countless occasions I have gone blundering into swans''
    nests, I have never seen eggs hatching, and the weather has invariably been balmy,
    for that is the kind of weather I prefer when blundering about among the nests
    of swans."
