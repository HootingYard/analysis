  text: "\u201CTo be clear, Merced does not want to sacrifice a goat in his home.\
    \ He wants to sacrifice 5\u20137 goats, 1\u20132 turtles, 1 duck, 10\u201314 chickens,\
    \ 5\u20137 guinea hens and 10\u201314 doves all at one time. Keeping and killing\
    \ that many animals in a residential neighbourhood poses disease transmission\
    \ dangers. It creates stench and filth\u201D\u2026 Furthermore, said the lawyer\
    \ for Euless council, sacrificing goats was \u201Crepulsive and has no place in\
    \ an urban environment\u201D.\nI find myself particularly concerned for that lone\
    \ duck.\nHeresy Corner investigates the world o\u2019 goat sacrifice. Food for\
    \ thought not only for Santerian voodooists, but for Aztec fundamentalists and\
    \ those of us who worship the hideous bat-god Fatso."
