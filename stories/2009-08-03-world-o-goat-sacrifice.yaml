  text: '"To be clear, Merced does not want to sacrifice a goat in his home. He wants
    to sacrifice 5-7 goats, 1-2 turtles, 1 duck, 10-14 chickens, 5-7 guinea hens and
    10-14 doves all at one time. Keeping and killing that many animals in a residential
    neighbourhood poses disease transmission dangers. It creates stench and filth"...
    Furthermore, said the lawyer for Euless council, sacrificing goats was "repulsive
    and has no place in an urban environment".

    I find myself particularly concerned for that lone duck.

    Heresy Corner investigates the world o'' goat sacrifice. Food for thought not
    only for Santerian voodooists, but for Aztec fundamentalists and those of us who
    worship the hideous bat-god Fatso.'
