  text: "I have always thought the most efficacious cure for melancholy was to lean\
    \ on the fence of a sty and watch pigs. Help is at hand, however, for the pig-bereft\
    \ melancholic seeking to ease their woes. Dan Chambers sent me an extract from\
    \ an email from his Pa:\nIn his preface to The Anatomy of Melancholy Burton explains\
    \ that he wrote the book to rid himself of his own melancholia. This it failed\
    \ to do; Bishop Kennet wrote that Burton\u2018s only relief from despondency was\
    \ to lean over the footbridge at Oxford and listen to the bargemen swearing at\
    \ each other."
