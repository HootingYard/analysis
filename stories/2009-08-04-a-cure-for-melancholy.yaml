  text: 'I have always thought the most efficacious cure for melancholy was to lean
    on the fence of a sty and watch pigs. Help is at hand, however, for the pig-bereft
    melancholic seeking to ease their woes. Dan Chambers sent me an extract from an
    email from his Pa:

    In his preface to The Anatomy of Melancholy Burton explains that he wrote the
    book to rid himself of his own melancholia. This it failed to do; Bishop Kennet
    wrote that Burton''s only relief from despondency was to lean over the footbridge
    at Oxford and listen to the bargemen swearing at each other.'
