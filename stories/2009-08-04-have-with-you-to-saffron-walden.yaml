    I recently posted a quotation from Thomas Nashe (1567-c.1601), like Dobson an
    (almost) out of print pamphleteer. I think it will be a good idea for me to read
    his complete works, which include The Anatomy Of Absurdity, Nashe''s Lenten Stuffe,
    An Almond For A Parrot, and Have With You To Saffron Walden--the latter title
    alone filling me with glee. There is thus a chance that Hooting Yard will get
    clogged with further Nashe quotations, but I am confident readers will enjoy them.'
