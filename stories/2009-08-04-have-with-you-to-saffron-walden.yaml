  text: "\nI recently posted a quotation from Thomas Nashe (1567-c.1601), like Dobson\
    \ an (almost) out of print pamphleteer. I think it will be a good idea for me\
    \ to read his complete works, which include The Anatomy Of Absurdity, Nashe's\
    \ Lenten Stuffe, An Almond For A Parrot, and Have With You To Saffron Walden\u2014\
    the latter title alone filling me with glee. There is thus a chance that Hooting\
    \ Yard will get clogged with further Nashe quotations, but I am confident readers\
    \ will enjoy them."
