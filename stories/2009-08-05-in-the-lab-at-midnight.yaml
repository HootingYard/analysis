  text: 'There was an foolish man and an hairy man and they were in the lab at midnight.
    They were mucking about with magnets and retorts and galvanometers and Coddington
    lenses. Neither the foolish man nor the hairy man was authorised to be in the
    lab. They had broken in using a jemmy. "No Unauthorised Personnel" read a sign
    on the door they snapped the bolts of. The foolish man could not read standard
    lettering, and the hairy man was a rebellious curmudgeon who spat in the face
    of the law, even when it was a by-law. They were in the lab to build a robot.

    Their robot was to be large and pneumatic and lumbering and foolish and hairy.
    Its brain would be an exact replica of the brain of the foolish man, made from
    bakelite and rubber, and its hairiness would match that of the hairy man, for
    he had plucked out half his hairs and used gum to stick them to sheets of corrugated
    cardboard which would form the outer shell of the robot. They had already prepared
    both the brain and the shell and hidden them, days ago, in a bag under a sink
    in the lab. Only the lab janitor could stop them now! But if he came rattling
    his keys and flashing his torch into the lab at midnight, the foolish man and
    the hairy man had a plan. They would pelt him with caraway seeds, making him drop
    his keys and his torch, and then they would muffle him with a blanket. The foolish
    man had brought the blanket, and the hairy man had brought a big bag of caraway
    seeds.

    The purpose of the robot was manifold. Neither the foolish man nor the hairy man
    clearly understood what this meant, but they were acting on the orders of the
    Grunty Man, in whom they had absolute trust and whom they durst not question,
    ever. They had seen what happened to the pernickety man. He ended up tethered
    to a post in an abandoned quarry, pecked by scavenger birds.

    There was a haplessness about their mucking about with the magnets and retorts
    and galvanometers and Coddington lenses which did the foolish man and the hairy
    man no credit. Both of them had butterfingers. At one o'' clock in the morning
    they were no nearer to completing the robot''s innards than they had been an hour
    before. And then one of them, either the foolish man or the hairy man, discovered
    that the piping connected to the sink under which they had stowed the bag with
    the brain and the shell was cracked and leaking. It was a paper bag, and it was
    soaked through, and the rubber and bakelite and corrugated cardboard and hair
    were all ruined. There was some sort of corrosive chemical compound in the water.
    It was that kind of lab.

    So terrified were the foolish man and the hairy man at the prospect of having
    to confess their ineptitude to the Grunty Man that they ran away into the night,
    leaving the makings of their robot scattered in the lab. When the janitor came
    along at dawn, rattling his keys, he took one glance and saw what only a janitor
    with a well-trained eye could see. He pushed a knob on his walkie-talkie and made
    his report.

    "There has been an incursion into the lab by one of the Grunty Man''s manifold
    robots," he said, "Fortunately, it appears to have been as unstable as all his
    other robots, and has destroyed itself. The mopping up will begin now."'
