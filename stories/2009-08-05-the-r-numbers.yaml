  text: "1. For reasons which remain obscure to me, the text of John Ruskin's Praeterita\
    \ is arranged in numbered paragraphs. At least, such is the case with the Everyman\
    \ edition which I am reading. I have seen other versions where the numbering is\
    \ absent. This practice is not a substitute for, but rather an addition to, the\
    \ conventional division of the text into chapters. The numbering, however, is\
    \ continuous through the chapters, so that, for example, Chapter II of Volume\
    \ I (\u201CHerne-Hill Almond Blossoms\u201D) begins with paragraph number 36.\
    \ The book was originally published in three volumes, and each has its paragraphs\
    \ separately numbered, so that Volume I contains paragraphs numbered 1 to 260\
    \ in twelve chapters, Volume II 1 to 235 in twelve chapters, and Volume III 1\
    \ to 86 in four chapters, at which point Ruskin abandoned it.\n2. The numbering\
    \ of paragraphs does not support a critical apparatus appended to the book, such\
    \ as a commentary, notes, or what have you. Hence my perplexity. It appears to\
    \ be simply idiosyncratic.\n3. I have noticed, while reading, that my eyes tend\
    \ to glance over the numbers without registering them. And yet, when I first opened\
    \ the book, and saw the numbering, I found it very pleasing. I cannot quite articulate\
    \ why. Of course, it acts as a handy aide memoire for any nuggets of arresting\
    \ Ruskinian prose one wants to recall. However, I think there have been quite\
    \ enough quotations from Mr R. posted at Hooting Yard over recent months.\n4.\
    \ I am not sure what, if anything, is the purpose of this post, other than to\
    \ practise a bit of paragraph-numbering off my own bat. In my experience, it is\
    \ these odd and inconsequential postages which attract a greater number of comments\
    \ than usual. We shall see."
