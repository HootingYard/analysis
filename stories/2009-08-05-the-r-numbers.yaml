  text: '1. For reasons which remain obscure to me, the text of John Ruskin''s Praeterita
    is arranged in numbered paragraphs. At least, such is the case with the Everyman
    edition which I am reading. I have seen other versions where the numbering is
    absent. This practice is not a substitute for, but rather an addition to, the
    conventional division of the text into chapters. The numbering, however, is continuous
    through the chapters, so that, for example, Chapter II of Volume I ("Herne-Hill
    Almond Blossoms") begins with paragraph number 36. The book was originally published
    in three volumes, and each has its paragraphs separately numbered, so that Volume
    I contains paragraphs numbered 1 to 260 in twelve chapters, Volume II 1 to 235
    in twelve chapters, and Volume III 1 to 86 in four chapters, at which point Ruskin
    abandoned it.

    2. The numbering of paragraphs does not support a critical apparatus appended
    to the book, such as a commentary, notes, or what have you. Hence my perplexity.
    It appears to be simply idiosyncratic.

    3. I have noticed, while reading, that my eyes tend to glance over the numbers
    without registering them. And yet, when I first opened the book, and saw the numbering,
    I found it very pleasing. I cannot quite articulate why. Of course, it acts as
    a handy aide memoire for any nuggets of arresting Ruskinian prose one wants to
    recall. However, I think there have been quite enough quotations from Mr R. posted
    at Hooting Yard over recent months.

    4. I am not sure what, if anything, is the purpose of this post, other than to
    practise a bit of paragraph-numbering off my own bat. In my experience, it is
    these odd and inconsequential postages which attract a greater number of comments
    than usual. We shall see.'
