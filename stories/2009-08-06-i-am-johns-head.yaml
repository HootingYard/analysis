  text: 'Dobson went through a strange phase where he was consumed by a mania to have
    an article published in the Reader''s Digest. This obsession--mercifully temporary--is
    thought to have been occasioned by water on the brain, following an incident when
    the pamphleteer toppled off Sawdust Bridge and was submerged in the icy river
    for over six minutes. His toppling may have been due to the fact that he was,
    at the time, breaking in a secondhand pair of Tunisian Air Cadet boots, and was
    unsteady on his feet. Hoisted by a crane from the madly gushing water some miles
    downstream, Dobson was taken to a riverside crane-person''s hut and plonked in
    front of a radiator to dry off. There was a shelf stacked with untold copies of
    the Reader''s Digest in the hut, and the pamphleteer browsed through them as he
    sat engulfed in steam.

    Later, back at home, Dobson set himself to write a piece typical of the magazine''s
    content. He was in such a flap that he dashed off not one, but four articles,
    each entitled I Am John''s Head. These are not versions or rewritings of a single
    essay, but four discrete pieces of prose, and they could not be more different
    from one another.

    In one, John is a Jesuit priest, and his head is the size and shape of a potato.
    He lives in Shoeburyness, and is wrestling with doubts about his faith, which
    make his head throb. In the second piece, the head is no longer attached to the
    body of John--a different John in this case--but floating free, much like a hot
    air balloon, and subject to the same hazards and imperilments as a balloon, except
    of course that a head has a much tougher hide. The third piece treats John as
    a host upon which the head feeds as a parasite. By general assent, this is the
    most unnerving of the four essays, and there have been attempts to suppress it.
    In number four, John and his head barely rate a mention, as Dobson seems to get
    carried away with a prolonged and rancorous piece of invective about the ill-fitting
    Tunisian Air Cadet boots which caused his Sawdust Bridge mishap.

    Dobson seems to have got something out of his system by writing what scholars
    now call "The Four I Am John''s Head Essays". He never submitted any of them for
    publication in the Reader''s Digest, shoving them into an old cardboard box and
    forgetting about them. In an interview late in life, he was asked about the essays,
    and asked also why he had not written one called I Am Jane''s Head. Unfortunately,
    the questions were put to the pamphleteer during the notorious Pointy Town Pavilion
    interview, in which no sensible, or even half way sane, replies were given, the
    interviewer''s legs were broken, the pavilion burned to the ground, and a blithely
    oblivious Dobson sat there drooling into a tin cup and babbling on about President
    Nixon''s fondness for mashing potatoes as a relaxation technique*, one he was
    minded to ape. We have no evidence that he ever did so.

    The I Am John''s Head essays are due to be published for the first time in a single
    volume, with notes and commentary by upstart young Dobsonist Ted Cack, when he
    is released from a Swiss prison.

    * NOTE : This is true, of course, but I cannot recall where I read it, and would
    be grateful to any reader who can direct me to further information.

    UPDATE : Here is a reference to the source of my Nixon / mashed potato information.
    I will try to find the exact quotation during the coming days.'
