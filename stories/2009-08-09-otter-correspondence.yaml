  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Olivia Funnel, Perhaps I am thick. Or perhaps, by dint
    of my airy-fairy upbringing on a hippy commune, I do not possess a criminal''s
    imagination. Whatever the reason, I am utterly in the dark regarding the way in
    which otters in a laundry basket could prove a pivotal element in a heist. I must
    confess I have not seen the film Snakes On A Plane, which may put me at a disadvantage,
    but I did see, more than once, Krzysztof Kieslowski''s A Short Film About Killing
    Snakes On A Plane, upon which I understand the box office hit was based. In fact,
    after reading your piece, I watched the Kieslowski again on DVD, hoping to understand
    a little more about the fourth bungled heist. I am none the wiser, although I
    did get a mild frisson from watching a DVD starring the man after whom the technology
    is named, Dick Van Dyke. Were you aware, incidentally, that the veteran chim-chim-cheroo
    singer receives a royalty payment for every DVD sold, even pirated ones foisted
    on you by street corner urchins? Anyway, as I say, even watching the film again
    I was unable to grasp the role of a laundry basket full of otters in a criminal
    enterprise. Could you perhaps enlighten me, and those others of your readers who
    grew up on hippy communes and thus do not have a criminal bone in their bodies?

    Dear Ms Funnel, replies Mr Key, First of all I wish to take issue with your assertion
    that children raised on hippy communes lack any instinct for rascality and crime.
    Just because you spent your childhood talking to elves and fairies and communing
    with tree spirits does not mean that in adulthood you are incapable of committing
    heinous and unforgivable crimes. Always remember that there is a notorious serial
    killer called Sunflower Buttercup. Secondly, while you might enjoy the grim eurotosh
    of Kieslowski films, the great Dick Van Dyke is probably seen to better effect
    in an unashamedly populist entertainment such as Tod Baxter''s Three Colours :
    Beige, the kind of film you probably sneer at. And finally, were you half way
    literate and had read the Sherlock Holmes story The Strange Affair Of The Weasels
    In A Laundry Hamper, you would know precisely what the plan was for the fourth
    bungled heist, and would not need to write foolish letters to Hooting Yard.'
