  text: "I have it on good authority that three of the windmills included here are\
    \ the precise windmills Noel Harrison was wittering on about in \u201CThe Windmills\
    \ Of Your Mind\u201D. But which three are they? The first person to guess correctly\
    \ wins a retouched photograph of Noel and his pa Rex watching a lightning-bolt\
    \ striking a tree."
