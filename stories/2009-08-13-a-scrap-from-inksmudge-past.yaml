  text: 'Mooching about Interwebshire*, it is easy to forget those long ago days spent
    in the seedy village of Inksmudge. Although there are umpteen websites devoted
    to all sorts of past publishing glories, it is rare--at least in my experience--to
    chance upon an item I clearly remember snipping out of an old inky paper and slotting
    in to my teenage cuttings pile. (Why did I never bother to paste things into a
    scrapbook?)

    Those heaps of printstuff were, for the most part, lost or abandoned or buried
    or burned to a cinder many years ago. So I was delighted, this morning, roaming
    through the shire, to find this snippet, almost certainly from NME circa 1974.
    It still makes me laugh, though perhaps now accompanied by a lump in my throat.
    Tempus fugit, lost youth, blah blah blah...


    * NOTE : A term coined, as far as I''m aware, by John Barleycorn at the much-missed
    According To The Ninth.'
