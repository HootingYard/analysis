  text: "At the beginning of the year, you may recall, in homage to George Orwell's\
    \ egg-counting mania, I began a daily squirrel count. Alas, I lack the single-minded\
    \ diligence necessary for so useful a pastime, and I am afraid the count petered\
    \ out on, er, the second of January.\nI mention this solely as a pretext to draw\
    \ to your attention this squirrel.\nIt is said somewhere, possibly by Dobson,\
    \ that every fictional hero has an antipole, an eerie opposite that features in\
    \ an\u2014almost certainly unwritten\u2014mirror of the original work. (If it\
    \ was Dobson, it is a shame he never developed this thesis into an entire pamphlet.)\
    \ I think we can safely say that what we have here is the antipole of Unconscious\
    \ Squirrel!, the unconscious squirrel."
