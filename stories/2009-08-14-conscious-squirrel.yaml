  text: 'At the beginning of the year, you may recall, in homage to George Orwell''s
    egg-counting mania, I began a daily squirrel count. Alas, I lack the single-minded
    diligence necessary for so useful a pastime, and I am afraid the count petered
    out on, er, the second of January.

    I mention this solely as a pretext to draw to your attention this squirrel.

    It is said somewhere, possibly by Dobson, that every fictional hero has an antipole,
    an eerie opposite that features in an--almost certainly unwritten--mirror of the
    original work. (If it was Dobson, it is a shame he never developed this thesis
    into an entire pamphlet.) I think we can safely say that what we have here is
    the antipole of Unconscious Squirrel!, the unconscious squirrel.'
