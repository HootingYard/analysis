  text: "Bored by stamps, coins, and football paraphernalia, I decided to collect\
    \ flies in mud. I began my collection last Saturday, and what with one thing and\
    \ another have not been able to devote as much time to it as I would have liked,\
    \ so it is very much in what you could call its pupate stage. I have one fly trapped\
    \ in mud, but have assembled much of the kit I will need to add to my collection,\
    \ which I envisage becoming the finest in the world one day, if I stick at it.\n\
    Currently the collection is small enough to present no display problems. My fly\
    \ in mud is resting on an ornate Frampton stand in my parlour. Few people these\
    \ days designate one of their rooms as a parlour, but I do, and with reason. Some\
    \ time ago, I had an astonishingly vivid dream in which a terrifying divinity\u2014\
    I think it may have been the hideous bat-god Fatso\u2014appeared before me, shimmering,\
    \ and roared \u201CYou will have flies in mud in your parlour!\u201D\nI do not\
    \ always act upon instructions given to me by frightful gods in dreams, you understand,\
    \ otherwise my life might be untenable. But I was happy to go along with Fatso,\
    \ if indeed it was He, partly because, as I say, I was bored by stamps and so\
    \ on, but partly, too, because it gave me a chance to redesignate one of my rooms.\n\
    There was a chance I had slightly misheard the spooky intonation in my dream,\
    \ and that what the god had actually said was \u201Cflies and mud\u201D rather\
    \ than \u201Cflies in mud\u201D. I pondered this for a while, before realising\
    \ that the \u201Cin\u201D would meet both cases, whereas if I went with the \u201C\
    and\u201D, I might be at risk of mucking up what was quite obviously an important\
    \ pointer to my future.\nIt is not difficult to find mud around where I live.\
    \ I will not go into detail, but if you think about constant rainfall, unsurfaced\
    \ rustic tracks, and the clopping of drayhorses back and forth morning, noon and\
    \ night, you will get the idea. As for flies, they are plentiful, as they always\
    \ will be in an area with a large number of illegal butcher's shops. Time was\
    \ I got involved in hopeless attempts to shut them down, or at least to stop them\
    \ selling contaminated pork, but I had my arms broken and skull cracked once too\
    \ often to continue with my civic duties. Now I try to do my bit by subsisting\
    \ on a diet of peas and radishes and gooseberry fool. Very occasionally I have\
    \ one of my pork cravings, but I have found I can satisfy it by carving a radish\
    \ into the shape of a pig and using my imagination.\nOf course, I use different\
    \ cutters and slicers for radish-carving and for hewing the tidy cubes of mud\
    \ in which my flies are entrapped. Well, more accurately I should say \u201Ccube\
    \ of mud in which my fly is entrapped\u201D, for as I said, so far I have only\
    \ had time to make a start on my collection. The cutter-slicer is one of the crucial\
    \ elements of my kit, which also includes a Bolsover scope, tinted contact lenses,\
    \ pincers, an illustrated fly identification pamphlet, and a modified pippy bag.\
    \ Making the necessary adjustments to the pippy bag was a nail-biting process,\
    \ and in the end I called in expert help. One of the illegal butchers had been\
    \ \u201Cturned\u201D, regularly attending a twelve-choking-fit programme set up\
    \ by Illegal Butchers Anonymous, and he proved invaluable. Where I had been screwing\
    \ my courage to the sticking place, he ignored the sticking place entirely and\
    \ soon had my pippy bag ready for flies in mud. I was so pleased I gave him a\
    \ handful of peas as a gift.\nI am hoping to add to my collection this coming\
    \ weekend, and have in mind a particular stretch of mud over by the Ringo Starr\
    \ Caterpillar Breeding Centre. Armed with my kit, I shall trudge out in the rain,\
    \ at dawn, tum packed with a hearty gooseberry fool breakfast, the world, thanks\
    \ to my contact lenses, all gold and purple and brown and green and puce and mauve\
    \ and blue. If you see me, doff your cap, if you have a cap to doff. If not, just\
    \ tilt your head at the angle prescribed by Bl\xF6tzmann (Second Handbook)."
