  text: 'Bored by stamps, coins, and football paraphernalia, I decided to collect
    flies in mud. I began my collection last Saturday, and what with one thing and
    another have not been able to devote as much time to it as I would have liked,
    so it is very much in what you could call its pupate stage. I have one fly trapped
    in mud, but have assembled much of the kit I will need to add to my collection,
    which I envisage becoming the finest in the world one day, if I stick at it.

    Currently the collection is small enough to present no display problems. My fly
    in mud is resting on an ornate Frampton stand in my parlour. Few people these
    days designate one of their rooms as a parlour, but I do, and with reason. Some
    time ago, I had an astonishingly vivid dream in which a terrifying divinity--I
    think it may have been the hideous bat-god Fatso--appeared before me, shimmering,
    and roared "You will have flies in mud in your parlour!"

    I do not always act upon instructions given to me by frightful gods in dreams,
    you understand, otherwise my life might be untenable. But I was happy to go along
    with Fatso, if indeed it was He, partly because, as I say, I was bored by stamps
    and so on, but partly, too, because it gave me a chance to redesignate one of
    my rooms.

    There was a chance I had slightly misheard the spooky intonation in my dream,
    and that what the god had actually said was "flies and mud" rather than "flies
    in mud". I pondered this for a while, before realising that the "in" would meet
    both cases, whereas if I went with the "and", I might be at risk of mucking up
    what was quite obviously an important pointer to my future.

    It is not difficult to find mud around where I live. I will not go into detail,
    but if you think about constant rainfall, unsurfaced rustic tracks, and the clopping
    of drayhorses back and forth morning, noon and night, you will get the idea. As
    for flies, they are plentiful, as they always will be in an area with a large
    number of illegal butcher''s shops. Time was I got involved in hopeless attempts
    to shut them down, or at least to stop them selling contaminated pork, but I had
    my arms broken and skull cracked once too often to continue with my civic duties.
    Now I try to do my bit by subsisting on a diet of peas and radishes and gooseberry
    fool. Very occasionally I have one of my pork cravings, but I have found I can
    satisfy it by carving a radish into the shape of a pig and using my imagination.

    Of course, I use different cutters and slicers for radish-carving and for hewing
    the tidy cubes of mud in which my flies are entrapped. Well, more accurately I
    should say "cube of mud in which my fly is entrapped", for as I said, so far I
    have only had time to make a start on my collection. The cutter-slicer is one
    of the crucial elements of my kit, which also includes a Bolsover scope, tinted
    contact lenses, pincers, an illustrated fly identification pamphlet, and a modified
    pippy bag. Making the necessary adjustments to the pippy bag was a nail-biting
    process, and in the end I called in expert help. One of the illegal butchers had
    been "turned", regularly attending a twelve-choking-fit programme set up by Illegal
    Butchers Anonymous, and he proved invaluable. Where I had been screwing my courage
    to the sticking place, he ignored the sticking place entirely and soon had my
    pippy bag ready for flies in mud. I was so pleased I gave him a handful of peas
    as a gift.

    I am hoping to add to my collection this coming weekend, and have in mind a particular
    stretch of mud over by the Ringo Starr Caterpillar Breeding Centre. Armed with
    my kit, I shall trudge out in the rain, at dawn, tum packed with a hearty gooseberry
    fool breakfast, the world, thanks to my contact lenses, all gold and purple and
    brown and green and puce and mauve and blue. If you see me, doff your cap, if
    you have a cap to doff. If not, just tilt your head at the angle prescribed by
    Blotzmann (Second Handbook).'
