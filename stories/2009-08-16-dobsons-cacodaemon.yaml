  text: "Even the most learned of Dobson scholars has difficulty with his pamphlet\
    \ How I Thwarted My Cacodaemon With A Pointy Stick And Some Bleach (out of print).\
    \ For one thing, who knew Dobson had his own personal Cacodaemon? It is never\
    \ mentioned elsewhere in the canon, nor does it make an appearance in his voluminous\
    \ diaries. Occasionally, like other indefatigable diarists, Dobson had recourse\
    \ to codes and symbols, but all of these have been deciphered after decades of\
    \ study by Aloysius Nestingbird and their significance revealed in his magisterial\
    \ survey The Meanings Of Every Single One Of Those Enigmatic Symbols And Scribbles\
    \ In The Journals Of The Out Of Print Pamphleteer Dobson, itself, alas, now out\
    \ of print too. Nestingbird realised that the childish drawing of a horned and\
    \ hooved goaty devil figure brandishing a spit fork, usually done in red ink,\
    \ which appears in the diaries from time to time without additional written comment,\
    \ had nothing whatsoever to do with some putative Cacodaemon of Dobson's, but\
    \ was simply the pamphleteer's idiosyncratic manner of noting that Hungarian football\
    \ ace Ferenc Puskas had played a blinder in a match that day. Puskas was never\
    \ known by a nickname aligning him with a devil of any kind, but Nestingbird shows\
    \ convincingly that the inside of Dobson's head was rarely in accord with the\
    \ wider world.\nNor do we find any reference to a Cacodaemon in any of the recorded\
    \ utterances or memoirs of Marigold Chew. Surely the woman who knew Dobson better\
    \ than anyone else would have known of it? There is a possibility, of course,\
    \ that she did know, but kept a judicious silence for fear of exposing her inamorato\
    \ to ridicule. But then, there was much else that was preposterous about Dobson,\
    \ from his boots to his handwriting, and she seems to have happily acknowledged,\
    \ even celebrated, his various absurdities.\nWhat of the pamphlet itself? In its\
    \ startling opening sentence, the pamphleteer announces that he is going to tell\
    \ us all about how he thwarted his Cacodaemon with a pointy stick and some bleach,\
    \ and that if his prose were paint, in this pamphlet it would be matt rather than\
    \ gloss. The fact is, Dobson continues in some of the glossiest prose he ever\
    \ wrote. Indeed certain passages are so glossy that Nestingbird, among others,\
    \ has recommended reading it through a screen or veil to dull its unearthly sheen.\n\
    Dobson gives his Cacodaemon no \u201Cback story\u201D. He does not explain when\
    \ it first began to haunt him, nor how terrible, or otherwise, has been its impact\
    \ upon his life. It merely shimmers before him after breakfast one drizzly morning\
    \ in April, and he reports this matter-of-factly, as if it is a familiar accompaniment\
    \ to his post-breakfast drizzly April morning doings. On the particular morning\
    \ of which he writes, Marigold Chew is away, which may in itself be significant.\
    \ Dobson does not tell us where she has gone, but by checking the calendar one\
    \ can conclude she was probably on one of her periodic jaunts to Shoeburyness\
    \ as part of the bottomless viper-pit study group.\nDobson then recounts how he\
    \ loses patience with his Cacodaemon. It is making demands upon him, as we are\
    \ given to understand it \u201Calways does\u201D, and the pamphleteer snaps. He\
    \ goes to the broom cupboard and takes out a pointy stick, and dips the end of\
    \ the stick in bleach, and charges across the room at the Cacodaemon, shouting\
    \ his head off and threatening to impale it upon the stick. At this point, with\
    \ a hideous sort of sucking and seething and squelching noise, the Cacodaemon\
    \ seems to implode in upon itself. Bringing himself to a halt just before he clatters\
    \ into the wainscotting, the pamphleteer peers down at the floor and sees a tiny\
    \ smudge of noisome goo. This, he suggests, is all that is left of his Cacodaemon.\
    \ He leans the pointy stick against the wall, and goes to the draining board to\
    \ fetch a rag. He wipes the smudge with the rag, pours more bleach into a bucket,\
    \ and drops the rag into the bucket. There is, he writes, \u201Ca faint echo of\
    \ the sucking and seething and squelchy sound, as if heard through a funnel blocked\
    \ with pebbles and dust\u201D.\nAnd thus the pamphlet ends, save for a rather\
    \ curious colophon from which not even Nestingbird has been able to wring any\
    \ meaning. I suppose we have to ask if Dobson was just making the whole thing\
    \ up. We know there were times when he felt compelled to write a pamphlet even\
    \ when his head was empty of ideas. Perhaps this was one of those times. Further\
    \ light will no doubt be shed on the matter with the publication of Aloysius Nestingbird's\
    \ forthcoming study Dobson's Head, Its Innards, And What They Reveal About The\
    \ Colossus Of Twentieth-Century Pamphleteering.\nI had hoped to be invited to\
    \ write an introduction to this book, but I was told, in a dream, that there would\
    \ be no such invitation, that Nestingbird had never heard of me, and that my pretensions\
    \ to Dobsonist scholarship were flimsy and pathetic and doomed. Hard to argue\
    \ with that, belched and spat out as it was from the fiery maw of a Cacodaemon."
