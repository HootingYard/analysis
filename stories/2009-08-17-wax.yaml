  text: 'From the splendid Awful Library Books, a 1966 title that really ought to
    have been an international bestseller.


    While Mary correctly points out the likelihood of the publishing magnate saying
    "I think the kids are looking for a good book on wax", she overlooks clear evidence
    from the cover that the book''s true purpose was to popularise, for tinies, some
    sort of Aztec-voodoo wax doll curse-and-abomination pin-sticking procedure.'
