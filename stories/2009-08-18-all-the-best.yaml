  text: "Over at Comment Is Free, two impeccably bourgeois graduates of the grammar\
    \ and public school systems and of Oxford University debate whether the total\
    \ collapse of civilisation would be, on the whole, you know, a good thing. A commenter\
    \ called \u201Cquestionnaire\u201D gets to the nub of its amusement value:\nI\
    \ love the way George [Monbiot] and Paul [Kingsnorth] are putting \u2018best wishes\u2019\
    \ and \u2018all the best\u2019 at the end of each doom scenario."
