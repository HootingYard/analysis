  text: "Here are some of the topics I have considered writing about today, in no\
    \ particular order\u2026\nThe interior workings of the brain of a moose.\nThe\
    \ delivery of a brand new Snodgrass-Ponsonby Machine, to replace one sent for\
    \ repair.\nTwo Mossad agents playing pingpong in a dismal hangar.\nNelson Eddy,\
    \ by a waterfall, calling \u201Cyou-oo-oo-oo\u201D, to Jeanette Macdonald, because\
    \ he has sprained his ankle and wants her to call an air ambulance.\nA map of\
    \ Vange, with all its unmarked pathways marked.\nA discursive yet exhaustive history\
    \ of the unbutton.\n\u2026 but each of these subjects has been done to death by\
    \ Dobson, in a series of pamphlets. It is true that the pamphlets are out of print,\
    \ but it's old ground, old ground. I think I shall instead turn my hand to a mashed\
    \ potato waltz, and whistle down the wind."
