  text: 'Here are some of the topics I have considered writing about today, in no
    particular order...

    The interior workings of the brain of a moose.

    The delivery of a brand new Snodgrass-Ponsonby Machine, to replace one sent for
    repair.

    Two Mossad agents playing pingpong in a dismal hangar.

    Nelson Eddy, by a waterfall, calling "you-oo-oo-oo", to Jeanette Macdonald, because
    he has sprained his ankle and wants her to call an air ambulance.

    A map of Vange, with all its unmarked pathways marked.

    A discursive yet exhaustive history of the unbutton.

    ... but each of these subjects has been done to death by Dobson, in a series of
    pamphlets. It is true that the pamphlets are out of print, but it''s old ground,
    old ground. I think I shall instead turn my hand to a mashed potato waltz, and
    whistle down the wind.'
