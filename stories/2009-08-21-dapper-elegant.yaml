  text: 'As we sink further into barbarism, it is pleasing to be given reminders that
    the dapper and the elegant can survive, sometimes in the unlikeliest of places.
    I am not at all sure I would wish to live in Vietnam, but I would certainly like
    to see us copy their toilet signage. Would it not lift your spirits, ever so slightly,
    to see our public conveniences marked with these silhouettes?



    Some other signs here (via David Thompson).'
