  text: 'Importantly, here are two pigs aboard a concrete boat moored in the mud at
    Burnham-on-Crouch. Readers will recall the town as one where Daniel Defoe reported
    the existence of fogwives. He had nothing to say of pigs and concrete boats, but
    it is unlikely, given the sunlight, that we are looking at mistpigs. Note the
    heavy chain tethering the concrete boat to the mud, to ensure it does not drift
    off into the River Crouch and cause maritime havoc.
