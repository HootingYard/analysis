  text: '"The reviewer gets carried away with his own sensational tale of ''Medea
    Blenkinsop, or the Octogamist'':

    ''But think of the shifts and perplexities of a wife with eight husbands, being
    not only mysteriously married like Aurora Floyd to her noble husband''s horse-trainer,
    but... also to the Emperor of China, who writes compromising letters by each mail,
    the more compromising as she is also secretly married to the postman, who is of
    a suspicious temper...; also, under peculiar circumstances, to the giant of a
    show that is coming to be set up at a fair in the neighbourhood; also to a maniac
    whom she keeps in the cellar.''"
