  text: 'A new academic year will begin soon, and all across the land anxious parents
    will watch as fresh clumps of tinies skip through the school gates for the first
    time. By now, most places have been allocated. But I am still receiving letters
    seeking judicious Hooting Yard advice on what type of school is best. Often, my
    correspondents seem deluded, for they bang on about so-called "faith" schools,
    or Montessori schools, or even Steiner schools. Please remember that the latter
    are based on the ideas of a man who believed in invisible gnomes.

    There is of course only one type of institution to which the wet-behind-the-ears
    infant ought to be entrusted, and that is a Dobson school. Named after the titanic
    twentieth century out of print pamphleteer, these academies use pedagogic methods
    devised, not by Dobson himself, but by Desdemona Ferncraze, a brilliant bluestocking
    who was for many years responsible for the instruction of the inmates of Pang
    Hill Orphanage.

    Shortly after her arrival at Pang Hill, Dr Ferncraze, a voracious reader of everything
    she could lay her hands on, contracted a common ague which led to water on the
    brain, after which she became convinced that the sum of all human--and inhuman--knowledge
    was to be found in the pages of Dobson''s pamphlets. Even the pamphleteer himself
    did not make such a claim, though he came close to doing so in his slim work of
    1953 The Death Of Stalin Has Led Me By Dense Entangled Byways To The Unshakeable
    Conviction That A Complete And Thorough Pedagogic System Can Be Based Entirely
    Upon My Own Pamphlets (out of print). Curiously, it seems this was one work of
    Dobson''s which Desdemona Ferncraze never read. She developed her "method" while
    lying in her sickbed on an upper balcony of Pang Hill Orphanage, having instructed
    the gruesome brute Pepstow to dispose of her entire library, save for the Dobson
    items, by shredding the books and feeding them bit by bit to gulls and other scavenging
    birds. This he did, despite his qualms, for he burned with a secret passion for
    the stricken bluestocking. Pepstow was at his least gruesome and brutish when
    in her presence, though such was his yearning that he became tongue-tied and could
    only grunt at her unintelligibly. Dr Ferncraze herself was utterly oblivious to
    his blandishments, before and after her ague, a circumstance of such pathos that
    it has been adapted for the screen under the title Desperate Pang Hill Orphanage
    Brutes. For dramatic purposes, a fictional rival brute has been inserted into
    the story, hence the plural.

    When sufficient water on her brain had been evaporated using the Gillespie Head-Steaming
    Procedure, Desdemona Ferncraze leapt from her sickbed and set about drilling the
    Pang Hill orphans according to her new lights. Out went the wall-friezes of alphabets
    and numbers and fluffy farmyard animals, out went the Good Citizenship And High
    Self-Esteem Module Workbooks, and out went the Tuesday morning caterwauling. Instead,
    each week was devoted to the memorising of the complete text of a Dobson pamphlet.
    By midnight on Friday, scratching at their slates, every single tiny was expected
    to be able to write out an accurate copy, including any marginalia that their
    wild-eyed teacher saw fit to add. Those who failed were handed over to Pepstow,
    who wreaked his gruesome brutality upon them down at the drainage ditch.

    Dr Ferncraze''s astonishing discovery was that a firm grounding in the pamphlets
    of Dobson, memorised in whatever order, fitted the orphans perfectly for lives
    as bumbling, distracted polymaths given to lengthy walks along canal towpaths,
    chucking pebbles at swans, just like the pamphleteer himself. With her boundless
    energy, she set up a network of similar Dobson schools in and around Pang Hill,
    in derelict buildings and abandoned campsites. They are still flourishing, if
    that is the word I am looking for, though it probably isn''t. Such a school is,
    without a jot of doubt, the perfect place for the progeny of Hooting Yard readers.'
