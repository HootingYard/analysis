  text: '"Among the animals who expend industry on hygiene and the protection of their
    dwellings, we must place Bees in the first line. It may happen that mice, snakes,
    and moths may find their way into a hive. Assaulted by the swarm, and riddled
    with stings, they die without being able to escape. These great corpses cannot
    be dragged out by the Hymenoptera, and their putrefaction threatens to cause disease.
    To remedy this scourge the insects immediately cover them with propolis--that
    is to say, the paste which they manufacture from the resin of poplars, birches,
    and pines. The corpse thus sheltered from contact with the air does not putrefy.
    In other respects Bees are very careful about the cleanliness of their dwellings;
    they remove with care and throw outside dust, mud, and sawdust which may be found
    there. Bees are careful also not to defile their hives with excrement, as Kirby
    noted; they go aside to expel their excretions, and in winter, when prevented
    by extreme cold or the closing of the hive from going out for this purpose, their
    bodies become so swollen from retention of faeces that when at last able to go
    out they fall to the ground and perish."
