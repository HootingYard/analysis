  text: "When OutaSpaceman wrote to tell me about an online seal maker, my immediate\
    \ reaction was one of terror. Has technology advanced to such a stage, I wondered,\
    \ that with a laptop and an interweb connection one can actually create a pinniped,\
    \ with flippers, that will bark at you as you throw sprats to it from a bucket?\
    \ It was with no little relief that I learned it was not that kind of seal.\n\n\
    As the world mourns Edward \u201CThe Tedster\u201D Kennedy, let us not forget\
    \ another American politician of the era, whose life we can celebrate by banding\
    \ together in an association of enthusiasts to practise his favourite pastime.\n\
    UPDATE\_: Over at The Pavilion Of Innocent Pastimes, Glyn has been making the\
    \ other type of seals."
