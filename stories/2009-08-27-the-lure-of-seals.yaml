  text: 'When OutaSpaceman wrote to tell me about an online seal maker, my immediate
    reaction was one of terror. Has technology advanced to such a stage, I wondered,
    that with a laptop and an interweb connection one can actually create a pinniped,
    with flippers, that will bark at you as you throw sprats to it from a bucket?
    It was with no little relief that I learned it was not that kind of seal.


    As the world mourns Edward "The Tedster" Kennedy, let us not forget another American
    politician of the era, whose life we can celebrate by banding together in an association
    of enthusiasts to practise his favourite pastime.

    UPDATE : Over at The Pavilion Of Innocent Pastimes, Glyn has been making the other
    type of seals.'
