  text: 'We know the identities of six of the octogamist Medea Blenkinsop''s husbands.
    There is the nobleman Blenkinsop himself, his horse trainer, the Emperor of China,
    the postman, the circus giant, and the maniac in the cellar. But what of the remaining
    two? Who were they?

    Over the years, students of this kind of thing have toiled fruitlessly. This should
    not surprise us, as there are only certain kinds of toil which bear fruit, and
    even then, much of the fruit will be rotten and eaten away by canker-worms, at
    least in the orchards I frequent, with my stick and my lantern and my bird-scarifier.

    Lately, however, evidence has come to light suggesting Medea Blenkinsop''s seventh
    husband was none other than the dwarf Crepusco, confidante of the composer Binder.
    How like Medea Blenkinsop to be married to both a giant and a dwarf at the same
    time! This revelation, in a recent issue of the Bulletin Of Blenkinsopiana, has
    already stirred up a vipers'' nest of controversy in the field. When I say "field",
    I am referring to an academic field, that of Blenkinsop studies, not the field
    adjacent to one of the orchards in which I skulk, at night, breathing in the heady
    scent of rotting pears and persimmons. I cross the field to reach the orchard
    gate. There are many cows living in the field, it is their home, and though, after
    the Blunkett incident, the government has warned us of cow peril, I know the cows
    and the cows know me, and we have reached an understanding, and let me tell you
    here and now it is a fine, fine thing to have an understanding with cows, a finer
    thing than all else under the boundless firmament.

    Much of the controversy centres upon the idea that Crepusco is being counted twice,
    in that he is the same husband as the maniac chained in the cellar. This is clearly
    gibberish. Crepusco was no maniac, at least not habitually, and it is absurd to
    suggest that Binder, a Triton among minnows in the world o'' symphonic composition,
    would have had to creep down to the subterranean reaches of the Blenkinsop country
    pile every time he sought counsel from his confidante. In any case, what kind
    of composer would have a maniac for a confrere?--apart from Harrison Birtwistle,
    that is.

    No, I think we may safely assume Crepusco was indeed a separate, seventh husband.
    The case is compelling. We know Medea Blenkinsop and Crepusco went a-walking together
    along perilous clifftop pathways, in all weathers, she in her kagoul and he in
    his amusing knitwear. We know there were clinches in grottos. We know they swapped
    railway timetables, something Medea never did with her fourth husband, the suspicious
    postman. And we know that Crepusco''s torso was emblazoned with a tattoo, Rococo
    in design, spelling out the legend "God help me for I am besotted with Medea Blenkinsop
    and I worship the very spittle with which her lips are flecked".

    It is, actually, this last point that bolsters the otherwise worthless arguments
    of the anti-Crepuscoists. When, they ask, with some justification, were Medea
    Blenkinsop''s lips ever spittle-flecked? Not a trace of spittle is ever depicted
    in any of the hundreds of portraits of her, whether they be photographs or paintings
    or crayon scribbles or pencil drawings or primitivist daubings or mezzotints by
    the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint or hyperrealist linocuts by the noted hyperrealist
    linocutter Rex Hyper. It may be that, battered by wild gales as they clung to
    one another upon a stormy clifftop, shouting their heads off to be heard above
    the screeching of auks and gulls and kittiwakes, a fleck or two of spittle might
    have appeared, fugitively, upon Medea Blenkinsop''s lip, without a Rex Tint there
    to record it for posterity. We shall never know.

    Nor, it seems, are we likely to know the identity of husband number eight. The
    author of the essay in the Bulletin admits as much, when she writes:

    The more I have studied this kind of thing, the more convinced have I become that
    Medea Blenkinsop''s eighth husband was but a phantom, a chimera, an invention
    of her madcap brain, woven from whole cloth, a life-sized rag doll she carted
    about with her, to the opera and to cocktail parties, much as Oskar Kokoschka
    did with the Alma Mahler doll he had made for him at the end of their affair.
    But I am not one hundred per cent sure, even now, even now, oh baby, twenty-four
    hours from Tulsa.
