  text: 'Mr Key is off to the seaside today, possibly to an ill-starred resort with
    a rotting jetty beset by squalls. When one prances out along a pier or jetty,
    there is always a distinct possibility of toppling over and plummeting in to the
    sea. So I shall be going well-prepared, with my 1869-vintage life-saving suit,
    complete with Eureka! companion buoy kitted out with water, food, reading material
    (so that I may read the news to pass the time of day), cigars, a pipe and tobacco,
    plus torches.


    From Ptak Science Books, with thanks to peacay for drawing it to my attention.'
