  text: "Mr Key is off to the seaside today, possibly to an ill-starred resort with\
    \ a rotting jetty beset by squalls. When one prances out along a pier or jetty,\
    \ there is always a distinct possibility of toppling over and plummeting in to\
    \ the sea. So I shall be going well-prepared, with my 1869-vintage life-saving\
    \ suit, complete with Eureka! companion buoy kitted out with water, food, reading\
    \ material (so that I may read the news to pass the time of day), cigars, a pipe\
    \ and tobacco, plus torches.\n\nFrom Ptak Science Books,\_with thanks to peacay\
    \ for drawing it to my attention."
