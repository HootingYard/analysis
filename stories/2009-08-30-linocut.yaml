  text: "An exciting letter arrives from someone going by the online monicker \u201C\
    Flautist-standing-on-one-leg\u201D.\nDear Frank, he writes, I thought it might\
    \ interest you to know that some years ago, for an anniversary present, my wife\
    \ arranged for me to have my portrait done in linocut by the hyperrealist linocutter\
    \ Rex Hyper. It was our first wedding anniversary, and, alas, our last, for being\
    \ a fogwife Mrs F withered away due to the damp and fumous mists hovering o'er\
    \ the marshes, and was lying six feet under in the churchyard before our second.\n\
    On the day the portrait was to be cut, I got dressed up to the nines and slathered\
    \ enough pomade into my bouffant to smother a guinea pig. Rex Hyper's linocuts\
    \ had made him so wealthy he had a private helipad on the roof of his chateau,\
    \ but I did not have a helicopter, so I made my way there via the funicular steam\
    \ railway. As we wheezed to the top and the brakes screeched, I saw through the\
    \ smudged window a sort of Praetorian guard of gap-year crusties. These, I was\
    \ to learn, were Rex Hyper's personal security detail. The man was a raving noodlebrain\
    \ given to paranoid delusions, who was convinced his helipad would be the site\
    \ of an attack by giant extraterrestrial bloodsuckers. Before I was allowed to\
    \ disembark from the carriage, I had to provide evidence via tape measure that\
    \ I was not a giant, proof in the form of a magnetic aura probe piston that I\
    \ was of earthly form and origin, and had my sucking mechanisms disabled so I\
    \ would have been unable to suck Rex Hyper's blood even if I had wanted to. When\
    \ these procedures were complete, I was ushered into the great man's presence.\n\
    The room in which he did his linocutting was cavernous and impossibly beautiful.\
    \ Every inch of walls and floor and ceiling was covered in lino cut by the maestro\
    \ himself. You could see it had that hyperrealist Rex Hyper touch. It was almost\
    \ like being in a real room.\n\u201CBof!\u201D he cried, for no apparent reason,\
    \ \u201CStrike up your pose for me!\u201D\nI did so. I thought my wife would be\
    \ pleased if, for the portrait she had commissioned, I posed standing on one leg,\
    \ my arms deployed as if I were playing the flute. I had not been allowed to carry\
    \ my flute on the funicular railway, it had a woodwind bias built-in.\nThe speed\
    \ with which Rex Hyper slashed and rent his lino with great swingeing cuts was\
    \ awe-inspiring. Now I understood why he was known, in the linocutting world,\
    \ as the Billy Whizz of the Linocut. His paranoia meant that he was also known\
    \ as the Desperate Dan of the Linocut, and for his gluttonous and disgusting eating\
    \ habits he was called the Three Bears of the Linocut. Sooner or later he would\
    \ become the Little Plum of the Linocut, with a wigwam on the helipad.\nBarely\
    \ forty seconds after I had struck up my pose, Rex Hyper emitted an ear-splitting\
    \ yell of triumph, in what I took to be French. He tossed the completed hyperrealist\
    \ linocut across to me and swept out through a set of gaudy brocade curtains.\
    \ A couple of the gap-year crusties appeared, swiped my credit card through a\
    \ swiper, and hauled me off up to the helipad. I was hoping for a free helicopter\
    \ ride, but the funicular railway bell clanged and my dreams were shattered.\n\
    So successful was the hyperrealism of the linocut that when I got home and bounded\
    \ through the door, my wife thought she was seeing two of us, me, a bit blurry\
    \ and insubstantial, and my bright, dazzling, impossibly fantastic doppelganger.\
    \ Indeed, in the remaining six weeks of her fogwife life she clung to the linocut,\
    \ kissed it and wept upon it, and expired holding it in her now withered white\
    \ arms.\nAfter her death, I hung it in the pantry, among the pickles and preserves."
