  text: 'There comes a time in everybody''s life when foes must be fought in battle.
    This is a universal truth, as sure as eggs is eggs. It might be objected that
    some people have no foes to speak of, but that is moonshine. There is always an
    enemy lurking, lying in wait, whether it be a marauding troop of stiletto-wielding
    banditti, or an inner demon gnawing at the vitals. It might be further argued
    that one need not battle one''s foe, but instead flee from them, running away
    screaming, mayhap, or hiding in a barn. Much good that would do you with one of
    those vitals-gnawing types! And even external foes, such as the banditti, will
    be in close pursuit, and track you down, and have at you. No, I am afraid it is
    true that sooner or later one must battle one''s foes.

    That being the case, it can be instructive to examine the historical record, to
    consider how others have battled their foes, to pick up handy tips. Here, for
    example, we have a scene depicted in a mezzotint by the noted mezzotintist Rex
    Tint:


    Rex Tint is a particularly fab mezzotintist, so we can see at a glance the situation
    he has captured so skilfully. A gigantic knight, in chain mail, armed with a mighty
    sword and a big spiked thumping orb-on-a-stick, is confronted on a mountain path
    by a pale child threatening him with her girlie pin-cushion and pencil-sharpener.
    The knight is clearly in the utmost peril. His has been a life of chivalry and
    tourneys in which he never came upon a real foe, and even when he went off on
    a crusade against the Saracen hordes, he thought of them not as enemies but as
    mere pests in thrall to a false and fiendish god. But now, on what Rex Tint tells
    us in a scribble on the back of his mezzotint was a balmy Wednesday afternoon
    in the far Tyrol, he has come face to face with a very real and very menacing
    foe, the one that has awaited him, the one against whom he must do battle. Yes,
    he could flee. No doubt he could find a barn in which to cower, like a little
    mouse. But the knight knows his Nemesis would pursue him there, and find him trembling
    in the hayloft, from which there would be no escape. He knows this is his moment
    of destiny, when he must battle his foe, as we all must, one day, whether or not
    it be a Wednesday in the far Tyrol.

    And what of this foe, this girlie in her gingham frock and corrective boots? Why
    does she menace the giant yet chivalrous knight? How did she find him on this
    remote mountain path in the far Tyrol? For how long has she pursued him across
    the globe, her pin-cushion and pencil-sharpener always in readiness, their pins
    and blades glinting in the sunlight, when the sun is shining, or protected by
    wrappers against rust, when it is raining? What fires burn in her tiny head? (Incidentally,
    note how Rex Tint has cleverly shown her with a head much larger in proportion
    than it ought to be, for purposes of illustrative oomph, using a mezzotinting
    technique known as "making the tiny bigger".)

    All these questions are pertinent, and the answers to them would provide the knight
    with valuable information about his foe. Ah, but were he to pause long enough
    to ponder them, he would be a dead man. His guts would be spilled upon a mountain
    path in the far Tyrol and his foe would stand triumphantly over him, one corrective
    boot planted on his neck. By not immediately engaging his foe in battle, without
    stopping to think, all would be lost.

    So the lesson we can learn from Rex Tint''s mezzotint is clear. When battling
    one''s foe, go on the attack. Slash and slice with your sword and thump thump
    thump with your big spiked thumping orb-on-a-stick. Do not stint.

    Whatever the specific nature of one''s foe, and whatever the weaponry one has
    to hand, similar lessons can be learned by leafing through an album of mezzotints
    by Rex Tint, or indeed by careful study of other pictures by other artists. The
    important thing is to face one''s foe and do battle. Remember, if one chooses
    to flee and to hide in a barn, it might turn out to be the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge
    farmyard, where lurk fouler and more terrible foes than you could ever imagine
    in your most hideous dreams.'
