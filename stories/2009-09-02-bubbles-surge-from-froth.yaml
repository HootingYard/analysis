  text: 'Bubbles surge from froth. Hot pan, hot pan. Do the bubbles carry infection,
    disease, bad vapour, the sickness unto death? We shall find out. We coax some
    bubbles into a bubble-container box, and cart it to the bench. We have apparatus
    on the bench, with which we can apply all sorts of tests to the bubbles. Testing
    is overseen by our captain. He deters the sort of larking about to which we are
    tempted when we get to test things with the apparatus on the bench. Our captain
    has a Bjorn Borgish air. He is glacial in the midst of pandaemonium.

    When we complete the bubble tests it is clear that infection is present. And not
    just present, virulent. Thank heaven for our suits and serums! Our captain raises
    one Roger Moore eyebrow, a signal, we know, to cool the pan and diminish the bubbling.
    This is duly done, but done ineptly, and there is an escape of gas. The gas is
    more toxic than the bubbles. Hooters are activated.

    We gather in the field as per our drill. There are cows in the field, munching
    vegetation. We have already tested the vegetation and passed it with bright flags,
    as we do, and so we know the cows are safe. Our captain counts us. He counts the
    cows, too, for no apparent reason. It is the same number of cows as it was yesterday
    and will be tomorrow. Surely our captain knows that?

    Perhaps he does not, anymore. This may be the first sign. Diligent in his duty,
    our captain was the last one out. We were all gathered in the field, in our designated
    rectangular patch, while he was still inside. He must have breathed in some of
    the gas. And those cufflinks he sports. So elegant, so chic, yet so sharp at the
    edges! Could a chance swipe of cufflink have rent a rip in the bubble box? Might
    our captain have swallowed an escaped bubble, or even the whole sample?

    He has counted us, and he has counted the cows, and now he is counting the clouds.
    Poor captain! The gas and the bubbles are ravaging his cranial innards. Synapses
    are snapping in all the wrong ways, or snapping at the wrong time, or not snapping
    at all. He flaps his arms as he carries on his imbecilic counting. And now we
    can see bubbles coming out of his ears!

    We round upon the nitwit who muffed the pan-cooling. We berate him for the catastrophe
    he has caused. He is infuriatingly insouciant, leaning against a cow and lighting
    a cigarette. It is like berating Noel Coward. But what is that poking out of his
    breast pocket? It looks very much like a green cardboard triangle as carried by
    the Communists in at least one Mickey Spillane novel. Could it be there is a traitor
    in our midst?

    Our captain is now counting the birds in the sky. Somehow he has managed to get
    them to keep still for him, in mid-flight or -swoop or -dive, as he counts. At
    least his derangement has not atrophied his captaincy of the elements! We can
    take advantage of the stillness to subjugate the Bolshevik. And we do.

    Later, in the canteen, our captain congratulates us on our quick wits. He still
    has bubbles pouring out of his ears, but he has stopped counting things for the
    time being and seems more like his usual self. He has suggested we lay him out
    on the bench and test him with the apparatus, so we will do that after teatime.

    The most curious thing about the whole episode is that the number of cows in the
    field seems to be getting progressively fewer. I have counted them over and over
    again, in fact I am still counting them, but each time I count, there is one less
    cow to be counted. And yet the birds are once again in motion in the sky above,
    the Commie is bound and chained and tethered, and the bubbles are pouring out
    of my ears, too, just as they are from our captain''s, and I am flapping my arms,
    huge energetic flapping movements, flap, flap, flap.'
