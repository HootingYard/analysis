  text: "It is encouraging to note that a universal panacea for all ills* was discovered\
    \ as long ago as 1883. Following a morally uplifing tale of gruel, the North Otago\
    \ Times (at Papers Past) carries a recommendation for hop bitters.\n\nAnd if they\
    \ don't work, keep reading, and discover the benefits of German Syrup.\n*NOTE\_\
    : If you're going to practise tautology, do it properly!"
