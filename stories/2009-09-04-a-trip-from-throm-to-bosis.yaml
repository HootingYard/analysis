  text: 'The town of Throm is perhaps best known for its gorgeous sewers, with their
    chandeliers, Rococo ironwork railings, and jewel-encrusted access ladders. In
    spite of the magnificence of their sewers, the Thrompersons fought hard to win
    that official designation as a town. It is, after all, the size of a village,
    with the atmosphere of a hamlet, and the public morals of a cluster of shabby
    huts. But town it now is, at least on paper, and bursting with civic pride. The
    mayor''s chain of office hangs around his neck, and trails along the ground into
    the gutter, where it drops through a brightly polished grating down, down, deep
    down into the most subterranean of the sewers, where it is bolted to an adamantine
    slab of rock, and bolted fast. It is a long chain, a chain the mayor is proud
    to wear. At the end of his term, the soldering person will come and unfasten it
    from around his neck, and it is at this time, his ten-years'' duty done, unloosed
    from his chain, that the ex-mayor might make a trip to Bosis.

    Some have mistakenly dubbed Bosis the twin-town of Throm. It is no such thing.
    It is neither town nor village nor hamlet, nor even a cluster of huts. It certainly
    has no sewers to rival Throm. It has no sewers at all, for it is the kind of place
    that, though rained upon incessantly, has always been shunned by drainage engineers.
    So to the untrained eye Bosis can look like a mere midden of mud and filth and
    muck, roosted upon by the occasional disoriented scavenger gull or vulture. This
    unseemly prospect conceals, however, the great attraction of Bosis, which draws
    Thrompersons to it week in, week out, through the winter months. Bosis is registered
    as a site of historical significance, for it was here, at the dawn of time, that
    the Lord appeared, carrying an enormous burlap sack. There are many versions of
    the story, but the essential details are covered by Abbie Farwell Brown in The
    Curious Book Of Birds (1903):

    One day the Lord gathered together all the insects in the world, all the beetles,
    bugs, bees, mosquitoes, ants, locusts, grasshoppers, and other creatures who fly
    or hop or crawl, and shut them up in a huge sack well tied at the end. What a
    queer, squirming, muffled-buzzing bundle it made, to be sure! Then the Lord called
    the woman to him and said, "Woman, I would have you take this sack and throw it
    into the sea!"

    This Lord has been erroneously identified as the God of the Christians, but recent
    scholarship carried out at the Bosis Institute Of Insect History has put a pretty
    firm kibosh on that idea. It now seems certain that the Lord referred to was actually
    a native of Throm, or what passed for Throm in those distant days, and may have
    been the same Lord who dug the very first shaft of what was to become the fantastic
    sewage system. We know much more about the woman who was entrusted with the sack.
    She was a Bosisite, of the higher peasantry, in raiment of turquoise, with bells
    on her fingers and bells on her toes, a maiden of baffles and puffers and woad.
    Her name, we think, was Clothgard.

    Thus is the close link between Throm and Bosis explained, although one puzzling
    aspect of the tale is that both town and midden are far inland, far, far from
    the sea. It is possible that the Lord''s brain was ravaged by the fumes released
    when he sunk a shaft into the mud at Throm, and he knew not what he did. We have
    clues that he performed some other curious deeds, in Throm and Bosis and further
    afield. Incidentally, given the foul and barely habitable nature of present-day
    Bosis, the Institute Of Insect History hovers above it, in an airship tethered
    to a sturdy wooden post.

    Should you wish to make the trip from Throm to Bosis, bear in mind that the recommended
    route is one of much squelching, and watertight boots are advisable. One ex-mayor
    of Throm did the journey in his socks, for a wager, and they found him in a ditch
    in the squelchy wasteland between town and midden, shivering and gibbering and
    beset by flies and gnats and bugs and beetles and other escapees from the Lord''s
    enormous squirming sack.'
