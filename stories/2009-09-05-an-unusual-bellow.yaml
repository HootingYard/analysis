  text: 'Would that Alfred Hitchcock were with us now! It is time, surely, for a new
    version of The Birds called The Cows. First they attacked David Blunkett, which
    is understandable, but now they have killed a holidaying veterinary surgeon. Is
    there not authentic Hitchcockian menace in this report?

    around lunchtime they heard "an unusual bellow"

    "I looked out of the window and saw the lady in question stood up against the
    wall, she had a stick and was shaking it, trying to get the cows away."

    Mrs Johnson said she could see the cows "all stood, huddled together in an arch"

    Crowsley''s body was found leaning against a stone wall and a semi-circle of cows
    close by.
