  text: "Would that Alfred Hitchcock were with us now! It is time, surely, for a new\
    \ version of The Birds called The Cows. First they attacked David Blunkett, which\
    \ is understandable, but now they have killed a holidaying veterinary surgeon.\
    \ Is there not authentic Hitchcockian menace in this report?\naround lunchtime\
    \ they heard \u201Can unusual bellow\u201D\n\u201CI looked out of the window and\
    \ saw the lady in question stood up against the wall, she had a stick and was\
    \ shaking it, trying to get the cows away.\u201D\nMrs Johnson said she could see\
    \ the cows \u201Call stood, huddled together in an arch\u201D\nCrowsley's body\
    \ was found leaning against a stone wall and a semi-circle of cows close by.\n\
