  text: "Their first album pretty much defined the style we know as \u201Cbathtub\
    \ reggae\u201D, the follow up sounded like a swarm of hornets trapped in a funeral\
    \ parlour, and now top beat combo Brute Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride,\
    \ Plume, Here / Buckle! are storming the charts again with their new release.\
    \ It's a box set of cover versions of the seven Sibelius symphonies, recorded\
    \ in what might best be described as Ivesian pillow-talk progpunk doo-wop. Fatima\
    \ Gilliblat talked to the band outside a kiosk on a crumbling seaside pier.\n\
    Fatima\_: It's very windy.\nBand\_: Yes. And have you noticed how the gulls seem\
    \ tense, as if awaiting orders from some sort of gull-god?\nFatima\_: I am holding\
    \ tight to my choc ice, for I fear it might be snatched by one of these rapacious\
    \ scavenging birds.\nBand\_: But that's the point\u2026 you see how they are just\
    \ hovering, not swooping down to the pier at all, despite that pile of discarded\
    \ wafers and toffee apples and seaside resort cocktail sausages in puff pastry?\n\
    Fatima\_: Yes, that is curious. Perhaps they're not hungry.\nBand\_: [Hollow laughter.]\
    \ Gulls are always hungry.\nFatima\_: Well, anyway, let's talk about this new\
    \ album.\nBand\_: Wait! See, there is broiling and tumult in the clouds over to\
    \ the west.\nFatima\_: So there is.\nBand\_: The gull-god is come! Put aside your\
    \ choc ice, Ms Gilliblat, and clamber on to this makeshift altar we have cobbled\
    \ together from rotting pier-planks and seaweed.\nFatima\_: OK, if you say so.\
    \ But why?\nBand\_: Because we are going to sacrifice you to the gull-god of course,\
    \ and tape the\_ blood-curdling savagery, and then pop back to the studio to incorporate\
    \ the field recording into our next album.\nFatima\_: How exciting to think that\
    \ I shall give my life for the cause of experimental sound art!\nBand\_: That's\
    \ the spirit!\nUnfortunately, soon after this interview, the band split due to\
    \ \u201Cartistic differences\u201D. The latest news is that they have called a\
    \ truce and are getting it together in the country, so we may yet hear Fatima\
    \ Gilliblat's electronically-manipulated death throes.\nUPDATE\_: Apparently,\
    \ Fatima survived. She is in fact a descendant of mythical giant crows, and tore\
    \ the gull-god to pieces with the power of her corvine brain."
