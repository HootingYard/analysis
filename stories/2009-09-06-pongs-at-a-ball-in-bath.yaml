  text: '"my swooning was entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of fetid
    effluvia upon nerves of uncommon sensibility. I know not how other people''s nerves
    are constructed; but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse materials,
    to stand the shock of such a horrid assault. It was, indeed, a compound of villainous
    smells, in which the most violent stinks, and the most powerful perfumes, contended
    for the mastery. Imagine to yourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours,
    arising from putrid gums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies, rank arm-pits,
    sweating feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments, and embrocations,
    Hungary-water, spirit of lavender, asafoetida drops, musk, hartshorn, and sal
    volatile; besides a thousand frowsy steams, which I could not analyse. Such, O
    Dick! is the fragrant ether we breathe in the polite assemblies of Bath; such
    is the atmosphere I have exchanged for the pure, elastic, animating air of the
    Welsh mountains."
