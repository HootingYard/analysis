  text: "\u201Cmy swooning was entirely occasioned by an accidental impression of\
    \ fetid effluvia upon nerves of uncommon sensibility. I know not how other people's\
    \ nerves are constructed; but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse\
    \ materials, to stand the shock of such a horrid assault. It was, indeed, a compound\
    \ of villainous smells, in which the most violent stinks, and the most powerful\
    \ perfumes, contended for the mastery. Imagine to yourself a high exalted essence\
    \ of mingled odours, arising from putrid gums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies,\
    \ rank arm-pits, sweating feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments,\
    \ and embrocations, Hungary-water, spirit of lavender, asafoetida drops, musk,\
    \ hartshorn, and sal volatile; besides a thousand frowsy steams, which I could\
    \ not analyse. Such, O Dick! is the fragrant ether we breathe in the polite assemblies\
    \ of Bath; such is the atmosphere I have exchanged for the pure, elastic, animating\
    \ air of the Welsh mountains.\u201D\nTobias Smollett, The Expedition Of Humphry\
    \ Clinker (1771)"
