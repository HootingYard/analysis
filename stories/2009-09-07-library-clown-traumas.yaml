  text: '"True confession:  I have had two library clown traumas in my career."--Mary,
    at Awful Library Books.

    Mary clearly did not work at the Pointy Town Municipal Library during the 1950s,
    or she would have had many more such traumas. Between 1952 and 1958, the library
    was staffed entirely by frightful clowns in full traditional clown costume, as
    part of a "social engineering experiment" conducted by the Blotzmannite head librarian,
    one Barb Crutch. She never made clear the purpose of her scheme, nor indeed its
    results. She died in the Munich Air Disaster, puzzlingly, for no one ever discovered
    what connection she had with the Busby Babes, and her replacement as head librarian
    quietly dropped the clown business. One Tuesday morning in March 1958, she tricked
    all the staff into thinking they were going on a charabanc outing, and once they
    were all aboard, she persuaded the driver to take them to a big top erected on
    a piece of land reserved for government nerve gas tests. So ended the reign of
    clowns at Pointy Town Municipal Library.
