  text: "Thanks to Peter Ashley at Unmitigated England, I have found the perfect location\
    \ to shoot the terrifying Hitchcockian chiller The Cows. \u2018Tis the wonderfully-named\
    \ Sludge Hall Farm, a place Blunkett would not dare approach\u2026\n\nIncidentally,\
    \ I think \u201CWH\u201D is cow shorthand for \u201CWar (on) Humans\u201D. \_\
    Readers might like to suggest other possibilities in the comments.\nADDENDUM\_\
    : Back in 2006, we noted a particularly alarming example of cow nomenclature.\
    \ Collect your wits, do a Winslety \u201Cgather\u201D, and go here."
