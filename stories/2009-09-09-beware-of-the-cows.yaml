  text: 'Thanks to Peter Ashley at Unmitigated England, I have found the perfect location
    to shoot the terrifying Hitchcockian chiller The Cows. ''Tis the wonderfully-named
    Sludge Hall Farm, a place Blunkett would not dare approach...


    Incidentally, I think "WH" is cow shorthand for "War (on) Humans".  Readers might
    like to suggest other possibilities in the comments.

    ADDENDUM : Back in 2006, we noted a particularly alarming example of cow nomenclature.
    Collect your wits, do a Winslety "gather", and go here.'
