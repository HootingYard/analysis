  text: 'Legal Notice : The Sludge Hall Farm in this piece ought not be confused with
    the Sludge Hall Farm mentioned on Wednesday. They are two distinctly different
    farms, and halls. The sludge itself is, in most respects, broadly similar.

    It is a meteorological peculiarity that the sky over Sludge Hall Farm is always
    leaden, the air thick and oppressive, as if a storm is imminent, but a storm never
    comes. Equally anomalous is the fact that, over at Sludge Hall itself, the storminess
    never ceases, the semidilapidated building forever assailed by thunder and wrack
    and downpour.

    One does not often meet with a trio of stylishly dressed Italian police investigators
    tramping up the path to Sludge Hall Farm. In their Giuseppe Fonseca suits and
    Boffo Splendido shoes, they cut the sort of dash not seen in this landscape for
    a century, since the heyday of the so-called "peasantry moderne" movement. They
    have come from Sludge Hall, where they were received in the cubby by the monopod
    major domo, who served them with cream crackers and iron tonic. Thus fortified,
    the detectives announced their intention to visit the farm. The major domo shuddered,
    but swiftly dissembled, creaking on his crutch over to the dresser upon which
    rested Sludge Hall''s only metal tapping machine, a vintage wonder.

    "I shall let the farmer know to expect you," said the major domo. The detectives
    preened their mustachios and glanced at each other, and then at their host, and
    then out of the smudged cubby window, its frame rattling as the tempest roared
    outside.

    Having tapped out his communique, the major domo made arrangements for Lars, the
    factotum, to take the Italians on his covered cart half way towards the farm,
    to the point where the storm weirdly ceased and the leaden pall sapped all vigour
    from the air. And it is some yards beyond where Lars dropped them off that we
    find the detectives now, each walking with insouciance and swish. If Sludge Hall
    Farm harboured a comely milkmaid, no doubt she would swoon at the sight of such
    unimpeachable foreign elegance. Alas, it is many a long year since comeliness
    in any form has blessed the farm. As the policemen are about to learn, it is now
    a grim and godawful place.

    No one knows the name of the farmer of Sludge Hall Farm. He is a hermit and a
    mystic and a polevaulting champion. Though aged and wizened, and though his many,
    many medals are now rusted and the velvet cushions upon which they sat are eaten
    away by worms, the farmer still polevaults every day, morning and evening, under
    the leaden sky at Sludge Hall Farm. He is puffing from a polevault as the Italian
    detectives push open the gate and greet him.

    One wonders what will happen. Will the farmer of Sludge Hall Farm speak for the
    first time in twenty years? Will he use his mystic powers to crack asunder the
    close-knit and almost telepathic team spirit of the detective trio, until they
    are snarling at each other like mad dogs and fighting with pitchforks? Will one
    of the detectives seek refuge in a barn, only to be set upon by a hideous mutant
    angry pig that has snapped its chain? Will the pig, its thirst for Italian blood
    unquenched, then rampage around the farmyard causing the surviving pair of policemen
    to hide in a hayloft? Will the farmer placate his mutant pig and place it in a
    trance? Why is the hay in the hayloft not like normal hay? Is it hay from another
    dimension, or from somewhere else in the space-time continuum? How has the farmer
    managed to fill the Sludge Hall Farm hayloft with inexplicably bizarre hay? Why
    have the mustachios of the Italian detectives shrivelled by dint of their huddling
    in the hay? What in the name of heaven is the mystic farmer doing, leading his
    entranced pig in ever more rapid circles around a bonfire? What is the exact nature
    of those sparks shooting from the fire? Why is the leaden sky turning a violent
    orange? Why are the detectives now sprouting hay from every pore? Is there any
    intelligible meaning to the deafening grunts the entranced mutant pig is making
    as it circles around the fire faster and faster until it is a blur? Why, back
    at Sludge Hall, are the major domo and Lars hyperventilating, convulsed by giggles,
    slapping their thighs and dancing a jig upon the dining room table?

    Tomorrow, when we read the front page headline in the Daily Farmyard Polevaulter,
    will we be any the wiser about that awful mess at Sludge Hall Farm?'
