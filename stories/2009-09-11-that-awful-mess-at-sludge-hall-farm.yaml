  text: "Legal Notice\_: The Sludge Hall Farm in this piece ought not be confused\
    \ with the Sludge Hall Farm mentioned on Wednesday. They are two distinctly different\
    \ farms, and halls. The sludge itself is, in most respects, broadly similar.\n\
    It is a meteorological peculiarity that the sky over Sludge Hall Farm is always\
    \ leaden, the air thick and oppressive, as if a storm is imminent, but a storm\
    \ never comes. Equally anomalous is the fact that, over at Sludge Hall itself,\
    \ the storminess never ceases, the semidilapidated building forever assailed by\
    \ thunder and wrack and downpour.\nOne does not often meet with a trio of stylishly\
    \ dressed Italian police investigators tramping up the path to Sludge Hall Farm.\
    \ In their Giuseppe Fonseca suits and Boffo Splendido shoes, they cut the sort\
    \ of dash not seen in this landscape for a century, since the heyday of the so-called\
    \ \u201Cpeasantry moderne\u201D movement. They have come from Sludge Hall, where\
    \ they were received in the cubby by the monopod major domo, who served them with\
    \ cream crackers and iron tonic. Thus fortified, the detectives announced their\
    \ intention to visit the farm. The major domo shuddered, but swiftly dissembled,\
    \ creaking on his crutch over to the dresser upon which rested Sludge Hall's only\
    \ metal tapping machine, a vintage wonder.\n\u201CI shall let the farmer know\
    \ to expect you,\u201D said the major domo. The detectives preened their mustachios\
    \ and glanced at each other, and then at their host, and then out of the smudged\
    \ cubby window, its frame rattling as the tempest roared outside.\nHaving tapped\
    \ out his communiqu\xE9, the major domo made arrangements for Lars, the factotum,\
    \ to take the Italians on his covered cart half way towards the farm, to the point\
    \ where the storm weirdly ceased and the leaden pall sapped all vigour from the\
    \ air. And it is some yards beyond where Lars dropped them off that we find the\
    \ detectives now, each walking with insouciance and swish. If Sludge Hall Farm\
    \ harboured a comely milkmaid, no doubt she would swoon at the sight of such unimpeachable\
    \ foreign elegance. Alas, it is many a long year since comeliness in any form\
    \ has blessed the farm. As the policemen are about to learn, it is now a grim\
    \ and godawful place.\nNo one knows the name of the farmer of Sludge Hall Farm.\
    \ He is a hermit and a mystic and a polevaulting champion. Though aged and wizened,\
    \ and though his many, many medals are now rusted and the velvet cushions upon\
    \ which they sat are eaten away by worms, the farmer still polevaults every day,\
    \ morning and evening, under the leaden sky at Sludge Hall Farm. He is puffing\
    \ from a polevault as the Italian detectives push open the gate and greet him.\n\
    One wonders what will happen. Will the farmer of Sludge Hall Farm speak for the\
    \ first time in twenty years? Will he use his mystic powers to crack asunder the\
    \ close-knit and almost telepathic team spirit of the detective trio, until they\
    \ are snarling at each other like mad dogs and fighting with pitchforks? Will\
    \ one of the detectives seek refuge in a barn, only to be set upon by a hideous\
    \ mutant angry pig that has snapped its chain? Will the pig, its thirst for Italian\
    \ blood unquenched, then rampage around the farmyard causing the surviving pair\
    \ of policemen to hide in a hayloft? Will the farmer placate his mutant pig and\
    \ place it in a trance? Why is the hay in the hayloft not like normal hay? Is\
    \ it hay from another dimension, or from somewhere else in the space-time continuum?\
    \ How has the farmer managed to fill the Sludge Hall Farm hayloft with inexplicably\
    \ bizarre hay? Why have the mustachios of the Italian detectives shrivelled by\
    \ dint of their huddling in the hay? What in the name of heaven is the mystic\
    \ farmer doing, leading his entranced pig in ever more rapid circles around a\
    \ bonfire? What is the exact nature of those sparks shooting from the fire? Why\
    \ is the leaden sky turning a violent orange? Why are the detectives now sprouting\
    \ hay from every pore? Is there any intelligible meaning to the deafening grunts\
    \ the entranced mutant pig is making as it circles around the fire faster and\
    \ faster until it is a blur? Why, back at Sludge Hall, are the major domo and\
    \ Lars hyperventilating, convulsed by giggles, slapping their thighs and dancing\
    \ a jig upon the dining room table?\nTomorrow, when we read the front page headline\
    \ in the Daily Farmyard Polevaulter, will we be any the wiser about that awful\
    \ mess at Sludge Hall Farm?"
