  text: 'Astute reader Roland Clare reminds me that the soft drink sloshed all over
    the canteen table by the narrator of Impugned By A Peasant was the subject of
    an Andy Warhol painting.


    Three Cans Of Squelcho! (1966) recently fetched untold billions of dollars at
    auction. The buyer remained anonymous, though the word on the street* suggests
    the picture now hangs in the foetid lair of the Grunty Man, up in the hills. The
    Grunty Man has been a keen art collector for some centuries. If you look very,
    very carefully, you can spot him at the back of the auction scene in North By
    Northwest, where Roger O Thornhill (Cary Grant) confronts Philip Vandamm (James
    Mason) and causes a kerfuffle.

    * NOTE : Blister Lane, apparently.'
