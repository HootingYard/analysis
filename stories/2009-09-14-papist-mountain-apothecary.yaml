  text: "The mountain apothecary with his bag so black. Is it a bag or is it a sack?\
    \ He heaves it up the mountain on his back. It is full of pills and potions.\n\
    But no one lives upon this peak. So as he climbs who does he seek? Ah, look, a\
    \ goat, a goat so weak. He'll pamper it with his lotions.\nThe mountain apothecary\
    \ is no vet. The weakened goat's our hero's pet. He trapped it once, within a\
    \ net. But now it roams the slopes.\nThe air is thin when one's so high. The goat\
    \ is weak and it may die. The apothecary wears a Catholic tie. He's treated several\
    \ Popes.\nA Papist apothecary, do you say? On the mountain this very day? I would\
    \ drown him in the bay, for I say he's a sinner.\nAye, a sinner and a heretic!\
    \ Evil is what makes him tick. Almighty God, he makes me sick. I'll vomit up my\
    \ dinner.\nI ate in the chalet at the foot of the mount. Me and a baron and a\
    \ Protestant count. Oh we ate a huge amount, of mountain goat and hog.\nSee the\
    \ apothecary come back down. He's taking his goat into the town, where there's\
    \ a vet of great renown. I'll shove him into the bog.\n\u201CPapist Apothecary\
    \ Drowned In Bog\u201D, the headline in my Daily Log. Now I'll march off into\
    \ the fog, and vanish whence I came.\nI came from haunts of coot and hern. There\
    \ I watch the Papists burn. Repent! Before it is your turn, and shudder at my\
    \ name."
