  text: "Time to catch up with some of the expected fallout from last Thursday's Impugned\
    \ By A Peasant. Over at Think Of England, Brit provided a link to what he called\
    \ \_\u201Ca terrifying tale\u201D, prompting this response from Peter Burnet:\n\
    Bah! Bloody Euros! No wonder you're in terminal decline. You get impugned by a\
    \ peasant and you go all artsy-fartsy and spin it into an meandering tale of cravats,\
    \ bouffants and existential turmoil. Want to know how we in the New World handle\
    \ that kind of stuff? Just check out the economical prologue to Dan Brown's new\
    \ novel:\n\u201CI was once impugned by a peasant, so I shot him. It haunted me\
    \ until dinnertime.\u201D\nMeanwhile, at the weekend, I had a dream in which I\
    \ was impugned by a sort of seaside variety of peasant. I was sitting in a dockside\
    \ cafeteria, drinking coffee with a couple of friends I have not actually seen\
    \ for a decade or so. We watched as various animals disembarked from a steamship.\
    \ I pointed to one, and said excitedly:\n\u201CLook, half a cow with no head!\u201D\
    \nThat is indeed what I saw. Sitting alongside us in the cafeteria was a bunch\
    \ of seaside-type peasants, one of whom chortled and shouted:\n\u201CIt's a big\
    \ chicken, you fool!\u201D\nThus was I impugned, in my dream."
