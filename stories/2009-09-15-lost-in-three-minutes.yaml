  text: "You lot know I am a devoted fan of the preposterous television series Lost.\
    \ As, it seems, are millions of Iranians. The clamour for pirated DVDs is such\
    \ that the main video distributor in the country is putting the series on general\
    \ release, and talks are afoot for it to be shown on state television. So far,\
    \ so good. But\u2026\nProgrammes will be carefully censored to exclude \u201C\
    un-Islamic\u201D scenes such as those featuring scantily clad women or male-female\
    \ physical contact.\nGiven the beardy mullahs\u2019 usual ideas about what constitutes\
    \ being \u201Cscantily clad\u201D, given that none of the women characters shuffles\
    \ about in a big black sack, and given that men and women hang out with each other\
    \ in a relaxed, trapped on a tropical island kind of way, I am trying to work\
    \ out which scenes will not be censored.\nLost, the complete series\u2014now available\
    \ in the digested three-minute version!"
