  text: '"O Dobson thou art sick! Thou art sick amid the blossoms! O what shall we
    do? What shall we do? Let thy pamphlets be our guide!"

    This was the little recitation made, oh so plaintively, by a band of hiking orphans
    who stumbled upon a sick and feverish Dobson in a blossom-bestrewn field one morning
    in 1956. Orphan hikes were a short-lived social phenomenon of the decade, one
    which is almost forgotten today. Inspired by the Swiss film masterpiece The Hiking
    Orphans, children all across the land gathered into groups and went marching off
    o''er hill and dale, munching toffee apples and consulting extensively detailed
    maps. So popular did the hikes become that many of the tots taking part were not
    actually orphans at all. Some became dab hands at forging death certificates,
    others suffocated mama and papa in their beds, or poisoned their breakfast cereal.

    Dobson became a sort of patron saint of the orphan hikers following publication
    of his pamphlet My Parents Are Dead, But Christ!, I Adore Hiking (out of print).
    Because of the blasphemous abuse of the Lord''s name in the title, the pamphlet
    was swiftly banned and the print run pulped, but such was the demand from hiking
    tinies that illegal Gestetnered copies were soon circulating, often secreted in
    the folds of the extensively detailed maps the orphans carried in waterproof pouches
    strung from lanyards around their scrawny necks.

    These maps were themselves a marvel, more extensively detailed than any other
    maps ever made. It was said that the most extensively detailed of them showed
    the precise alignment of chaffinches perched on the branches of an aspen you would
    pass if you bore left at the hedge in which a rusted farm implement had been shoved
    and abandoned.

    Unusually, Dobson''s pamphlet included an illustration of the great man, a linocut
    by the hyperrealist linocutter Rex Hyper which showed the pamphleteer''s visage
    in breathtaking hyperrealism. So familiar was his face to the more indefatigable
    orphan hikers, who pored over it whenever they sat down on a log to rest, that
    when a band of them came upon the sick and feverish figure sprawled amid the blossoms,
    they instantly recognised him as Dobson. Hence their plaintive recitation. Let
    us parse it.

    "O Dobson thou art sick!"

    The orphans are making it plain that they recognise the crumpled invalid for who
    he is, and they recognise, too, that unlike the blossoms amid which he languishes,
    he is far from blooming. We might criticise them for not being more specific in
    their diagnosis of his ague, but ought to remember that they are mere tots, and
    orphaned tots at that, except for the one called Vincenzo, who is a fraudulent
    orphan, having used his pocket money to purchase a counterfeit newspaper cutting
    claiming his ma and pa perished in an avalanche.

    "Thou art sick amid the blossoms!"

    By repeating their declaration of the pamphleteer''s medical condition, the orphans
    reinforce its seriousness. This is no fugitive swoon nor spasm, they are saying,
    nor is Dobson lying there with his limbs splayed out because he has simply tripped
    upon a clump. And having driven home the point, they go on to place it in a geographical
    location--"amid the blossoms". If an air ambulance is coptering in the vicinity,
    equipped with fantastic sound detection technology calibrated to pick up piping
    orphan voices, they have pitched their recitation superbly. But of course, in
    1956 such air ambulances were rare, and rarer still those with fantastic sound
    detection technology calibrated to pick up piping orphan voices. And the chances
    of one hovering in range of the blossom-bestrewn field in which Dobson lies crumpled
    are so remote as to be not worth a fig. Tiny they may be, but the orphans know
    this, and thus the despair of the next line.

    "O what shall we do?"

    We may be brave and doughty hikers, they say, we may be free from our often repressed
    and oppressive parents, God rest their souls, except for Vincenzo''s, obviously,
    yet we are still but fragile and vulnerable tinies, and faced with this dramatic
    medical emergency we are beflummoxed and in some cases about to burst into tears.

    "What shall we do?"

    The repetition here is a pleasing echo of the repetition of "thou art sick" in
    the opening lines. It also commands our attention. The orphan hikers are not larking
    about. They are confronting, probably for the first time in their lives, a mortal
    dilemma. Toughened as they are by their hikes, well able to ford streams and negotiate
    bramble patches and vault dry stone walls and run screaming from flocks of savage
    angry swans, they are not so tough that they can cope with the sight of a sick
    and feverish pamphleteer amid the blossoms. Well, Vincenzo can, because he is,
    let''s say, an interesting little chap. The way in which his voice drops out of
    the recitation for this pair of lines lends an added harmonic jouissance, if one
    is listening with due care.

    "Let thy pamphlets be our guide!"

    Vincenzo''s voice returns for this triumphant ending. There is renewed hope. Medically
    ignorant and lacking such kit as bandages and tablets and proprietary nerve tonics,
    the orphans have one invaluable resource--the stricken pamphleteer''s own pamphlets!
    For all of them, their imaginations sparked by Dobson''s illegal pamphlet on hiking,
    have each acquired their own little collection of his works, which they carry
    with them wherever they hike. They realise that by taking all their Dobson pamphlets
    out of their pouches and combing through the texts, they are bound to alight upon
    a passage absolutely pertinent to the situation. As the pamphleteer himself continues
    to groan amid the blossoms, the orphans end their recitation on this note of optimism.

    So there we have the words in context. What is curious is that, for as long as
    the orphan hiking fad continued thereafter, roughly until the winter of 1958,
    the recitation became a sort of generic chant, along the lines of the seven dwarves''
    * "Hi ho, hi ho, it''s off to work we go". Having been cured and then recuperated
    in a clinic a few yards away from the blossom-bestrewn field, Dobson was as hale
    and sprightly as ever, a fortnight after the orphans stumbled upon him, and yet
    they carried on chanting their recitation as they hiked hither and yon, from the
    outskirts of Pointy Town to the Terrifying Grim Black Mountainous Horror Of Gaar,
    and even further afield, to places beyond imagining. And as our little band crossed
    paths with other hiking orphans, their chant was picked up, until all across the
    land, from Blister Lane to the Big Wet Sea, every hiking orphan knew the words
    by heart, and chanted and hummed and howled them as they hiked.
