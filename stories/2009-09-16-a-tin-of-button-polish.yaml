  text: "Who but an Englishman, the legendary Sir John Franklin, could have managed\
    \ to die of starvation and scurvy along with all 129 of his men in a region of\
    \ the Canadian Arctic whose game had supported an Eskimo colony for centuries?\
    \ When the corpses of some of Franklin's officers and crew were later discovered,\
    \ miles from their ships, the men were found to have left behind their guns but\
    \ to have lugged such essentials as monogrammed silver cutlery, a backgammon board,\
    \ a cigar case, a clothes brush, a tin of button polish, and a copy of The Vicar\
    \ Of Wakefield. These men may have been incompetent bunglers, but, by God, they\
    \ were gentlemen.\nFrom Ex Libris\_: Confessions Of A Common Reader by Anne Fadiman\_\
