  text: 'Who but an Englishman, the legendary Sir John Franklin, could have managed
    to die of starvation and scurvy along with all 129 of his men in a region of the
    Canadian Arctic whose game had supported an Eskimo colony for centuries? When
    the corpses of some of Franklin''s officers and crew were later discovered, miles
    from their ships, the men were found to have left behind their guns but to have
    lugged such essentials as monogrammed silver cutlery, a backgammon board, a cigar
    case, a clothes brush, a tin of button polish, and a copy of The Vicar Of Wakefield.
    These men may have been incompetent bunglers, but, by God, they were gentlemen.
