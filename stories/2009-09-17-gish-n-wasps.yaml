  text: 'In a comment on Googie ''n'' Bee, R. writes: I think there could be some
    useful mileage in Lilian Gish + wasps, too. I am afraid to say that this demonstrates
    a fundamental misunderstanding of the connections between stars of the silver
    screen and the sorts of insects that buzz and fly and sting, the Aculeate Hymenoptera.

    A modicum of research reveals a plethora of anecdotal material linking Googie
    Withers with bees. Much of this is hearsay, and some of it is undoubtedly fictitious,
    merely the product of fuming brains careening pell-mell into poltroonery for want
    of any more useful employment. Nevertheless, bloody good anecdotage should never
    be discounted entirely, as Dobson once said, at a picnic.

    Conversely, conversely, say it again daddy-o, you will wander the world for umpteen
    years before you ever come upon a reliable Gish-wasp story.

    Now, useful mileage there may be if we are talking about Tallulah Bankhead and
    hornets, or Nova Pilbeam and German wasps, or even Vilma Banky and bees. In the
    latter case we even have a story involving ectoplasmic bee goo, though it has
    been suppressed by Vilma Banky''s estate, for understandable reasons.

    I hope that makes things clear.'
