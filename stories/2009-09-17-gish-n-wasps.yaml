  text: "In a comment on Googie \u2018n\u2019 Bee, R. writes: I think there could\
    \ be some useful mileage in Lilian Gish + wasps, too. I am afraid to say that\
    \ this demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the connections between\
    \ stars of the silver screen and the sorts of insects that buzz and fly and sting,\
    \ the Aculeate Hymenoptera.\nA modicum of research reveals a plethora of anecdotal\
    \ material linking Googie Withers with bees. Much of this is hearsay, and some\
    \ of it is undoubtedly fictitious, merely the product of fuming brains careening\
    \ pell-mell into poltroonery for want of any more useful employment. Nevertheless,\
    \ bloody good anecdotage should never be discounted entirely, as Dobson once said,\
    \ at a picnic.\nConversely, conversely, say it again daddy-o, you will wander\
    \ the world for umpteen years before you ever come upon a reliable Gish-wasp story.\n\
    Now, useful mileage there may be if we are talking about Tallulah Bankhead and\
    \ hornets, or Nova Pilbeam and German wasps, or even Vilma Banky and bees. In\
    \ the latter case we even have a story involving ectoplasmic bee goo, though it\
    \ has been suppressed by Vilma Banky's estate, for understandable reasons.\nI\
    \ hope that makes things clear."
