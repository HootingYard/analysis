  text: Banished to a remote atoll, I subsisted on molluscs and rainwater. It was
    my own fault. I had been issued with one of the new-style Anti-Social Behaviour
    Orders. Now I would have many long years to reflect upon the consequences of brazenly
    smoking a cigarette at a bus stop, past which an endless parade of vehicles belched
    noxious fumes. It was, as they say, a fair cop, guv. I readily placed my wrists
    into the manacles presented by the Community Patrol Invigilation Cadet as I lay
    sprawled in the gutter following a salutary Tasering. My week in a befouled hulk
    anchored off the seaside was an enormous help. I was able for the first time to
    acknowledge the depth of my criminality. I can say, without dissembling, that
    I positively enjoyed the sensation of being tossed out of an aeroplane and descending,
    with the aid of an automatically-opening parachute, which I have since ripped
    up for bedding linen, onto my atoll. For it is, now, very much my atoll, where
    I subsist upon molluscs and rainwater, and my rapidly dwindling carton of untipped
    full strength Paraguayan cigarettes.
