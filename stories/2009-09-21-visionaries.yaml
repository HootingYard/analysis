  text: 'I was much taken with the title of a recent postage at the excellent Ptak
    Science Books blog, to wit Visionaries, Ice People, And The Marriage Of Stupid
    And Brutal. Indeed, fomenting within my pea-sized yet pulsating brain is a piece
    to which I can apply this title, a piece which will bear no actual relation to
    John Ptak''s post, though that is well worth your attention. Now, on Channel Four
    News, I have just heard an arresting reference to "a visionary cobbler".

    Clearly the ethereal spirits which reign within my brainpans are gently prodding
    me to turn my attention to visionaries. Watch this space.'
