  text: 'I am beginning to think that stealing the titles of other people''s blog
    postages may be the Way Forward... forward, of course, to that bright upland where
    I can bask under the Aztecs'' mighty orb when my work is done. Even while the
    Key cranium is ticking and whirring as it ponders John Ptak''s postage header
    along comes Patrick Kurp at Anecdotal Evidence with "Emptiness; Uncertainty; Inanity".
    Again, I advise you to read the original postage, but meanwhile I shall be pondering
    some prose to which it will serve as a fitting title.

    The "inanity" part should give me no trouble, as virtually any anecdote about
    Blodgett will fit the bill. His tin shadow, his dockside groans, his futile picking
    at unbuttons... there is so much material.  But "emptiness" and "uncertainty"
    may be more troublesome.

    One uncertainty is to what extent I can get away with writing about prose I have
    not yet written. Best not to dwell upon it, for that way emptiness lies.

    ADDENDUM : As Dave Lull notes in a comment, Patrick Kurp''s title is a quotation
    from Dr Johnson''s A Dictionary Of The English Language (1755). Though that is
    clear from reading the postage, I ought to have acknowledged it here.'
