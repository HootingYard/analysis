  text: "Christians have their seminaries, and Muslims their madrassas\u2014but where\
    \ is the school for the aspirant Aztec fundamentalist? I speak of myself, of course.\
    \ Home study is all very well, and I have tried to be diligent, but in the absence\
    \ of a collegiate setting, I am falling prey to the lure of rival, and surely\
    \ heretical, faiths.\nThis little complaint was occasioned by my stumbling upon\
    \ an account of a Mayan rebirthing ceremony. True Aztec believers, even the most\
    \ wishy-washy, should guard against falling into the Mayan embrace. And yet\u2026\
    \ is there not something irresistible in this Times report of 2001?\nThe ceremony\
    \ took place at dusk. Mr Blair and his wife, wearing bathing costumes, were led\
    \ to the Temazcal, a brick-coloured pyramid on the south end of the beach\u2026\
    \ Ms Aguilar told the Blairs to bow and pray to the four winds as Mayan prayers\
    \ were read out. Each side of the building is decorated with Mayan religious symbols:\
    \ the sun and baby lizards representing spring and childhood; a bird to signify\
    \ adolescence, summer and freedom; a crab to represent maturity and autumn; and\
    \ a serpent\u2014the most sacred in the Mayan Indian culture\u2014to symbolise\
    \ winter and transformation\u2026\nWithin the Temazcal, a type of Ancient Mayan\
    \ steam bath, herb-infused water was thrown over heated lava rocks, to create\
    \ a cleansing sweat and balance the Blairs\u2019 \u2018energy flow\u2019.\nMs\
    \ Aguilar chanted Mayan songs, told the Blairs to imagine that they could see\
    \ animals in the steam and explained what such visions meant. They were told the\
    \ Temazcal was like the womb and those participating in the ritual must confront\
    \ their hopes and fears before \u2018rebirth\u2019 and venturing outside. The\
    \ Blairs were offered watermelon and papaya, then told to smear what they did\
    \ not eat over each other's bodies along with mud from the Mayan jungle outside.\n\
    The prime minister, on holiday just a month before the 11 September attacks, is\
    \ understood to have made a wish for world peace.\nBefore leaving, the Blairs\
    \ were told to scream out loud to signify the pain of rebirth. They then walked\
    \ hand in hand down the beach to swim in the sea.\nQuoted in How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered\
    \ The World\_: A Short History Of Modern Delusions by Francis Wheen (2004). Elsewhere\
    \ in this splendid book, we are reminded that Margaret Thatcher was a devotee\
    \ of mystical \u2018electric baths\u2019."
