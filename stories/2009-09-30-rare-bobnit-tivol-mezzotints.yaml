  text: "You will be perplexed, or perhaps even sick with worry, at the unaccustomed\
    \ lack of postages over the past few days. Has Hooting Yard been ravaged by some\
    \ kind of toxic gas? Has Mr Key fallen down a mineshaft? Readers, fear not. All\
    \ is well, but I have been terribly, terribly distracted, and in the best possible\
    \ way.\nOn Saturday, as is my habit, I sat down at my escritoire, or its computer\
    \ age equivalent, before dawn. I wrote:\nThere is a tavern in the town.\nThe tavern\
    \ was the Cow & Pins, the town was Pointy Town. I was going to embark upon a quite\
    \ breathtaking architectural survey of the tavern, its beams and rafters, its\
    \ cornices and lintels, but before I crafted the second sentence my attention\
    \ was caught by the singing of a siskin outside my window. According to the Royal\
    \ Society For The Protection Of Birds, the siskin is an attractive little finch,\
    \ small and lively. Obviously I was keen not simply to listen to the bird, but\
    \ to commune with it, in what might be termed a Frank Key-bird-mind-meld. So I\
    \ jumped up creakily from my chair, slipped on a pair of trendy footwear items,\
    \ and headed out, making for the tree where I thought the siskin was perched,\
    \ singing. Alas, I stepped in a patch of filth, and was disconcerted. Rummaging\
    \ in the pockets of my windcheater to see if I had upon my person a rag suitable\
    \ for wiping the filth from my footwear, I chanced upon a forgotten scrap of paper\
    \ on which I had once copied out a Spirograph\u2122 drawing, the one devised by\
    \ the mentalist Gaston Freakorb. Yes, that one, the drawing that plunges the viewer\
    \ into a fugue state. I made the mistake of uncrumpling the paper and peering\
    \ at the drawing for three seconds. Thus did my Saturday morning become unmoored\
    \ from reason, from common sense, indeed from memory. The architectural glories\
    \ of the Cow & Pins were forgotten, as was the attractive little finch singing\
    \ its heart out on a sycamore branch.\nWhen I snapped out of the so-called Freakorb\
    \ Mind Miasma, it was midday on Sunday and I was standing in a queue. To my distress\
    \ I noticed that both of my trendy footwear items were now covered in filth. Luckily,\
    \ there was a Regency bootscraper right next to me, so I scraped and scraped.\
    \ By God, it was fun. I thoroughly recommend the scraping of filth off one's footwear\
    \ on a Regency bootscraper, particularly when one's footwear is as trendy as mine.\n\
    There was no sign of the scrap of paper bearing the Spirograph\u2122 drawing,\
    \ so I was fairly sure I could keep my wits about me. I wondered what I was queuing\
    \ for. Glancing up and down the line, I noticed that an alarming number of my\
    \ fellow queuers were wearing cummerbunds. Was I about to enter a Spandau Ballet\
    \ revival meeting? Then I recalled having read somewhere that the cummerbund was\
    \ part of the uniform designed for \u201Cnew modern technicians\u201D to which\
    \ the Prime Minister would refer in his upcoming conference speech. But I am a\
    \ scribbler, not a technician, new and modern or otherwise. I had no business\
    \ here, surely.\nIt turned out to be a complete coincidence. I learned that some\
    \ of the cummerbundiasts were indeed new modern technicians-to-be, some were raddled\
    \ old New Romantics, and some simply sported the cummerbund as, in their own witless\
    \ words, a \u201Clifestyle choice\u201D. To find all this out, I had to interrogate\
    \ each person individually, making notes with my pneumatic notemaking contraption,\
    \ and in so doing I lost my place in the queue. Rejoining it, I found myself standing\
    \ behind a twinkly elfin chap dressed all in green, though minus a cummerbund.\
    \ Suddenly he spun around to face me, and he cackled, and shouted in a weird reedy\
    \ voice.\n\u201CGuess my name and I'll tell you / What you're doing in this queue.\
    \ / If you guess amiss three times / I will cease to talk in rhymes. / I will\
    \ scream and shriek and howl / And you'll be turned into an owl.\u201D\nThen he\
    \ cackled again, daring me to challenge him. I did a stage yawn. I think I did\
    \ it rather well.\n\u201CI suspect,\u201D I said, \u201CYour name is Rumpelstiltskin.\
    \ Am I correct?\u201D\nThe little chap shrieked, then, but it was not a shriek\
    \ of triumph. Far from it. I had rumbled him and his feeble fairytale poltroonery,\
    \ and his shriek was one of becrushment. Just before he scampered away with smoke\
    \ billowing out of his pointy ears, he told me what I was queuing for. I was delighted\
    \ to discover that I was in line for an auction of rare Bobnit Tivol mezzotints.\
    \ I was even more delighted when, fumbling in my pockets, I found a wallet crammed\
    \ with banknotes. It had not been there when I left the house to commune with\
    \ the singing siskin, so it must have come into my possession during my fugue\
    \ state. I made a mental note to write a thank you letter to Gaston Freakorb when\
    \ I got home, and slowly made my way towards the front.\nI was, of course, aware\
    \ of the set of mezzotints of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol made by the noted\
    \ mezzotintist Rex Tint at the very beginning of his career. Commissioned by the\
    \ fictional athlete's coach Old Halob, paid for with the proceeds from an orchard-planting\
    \ scam, the twenty-six mezzotints were no sooner completed than they were scattered\
    \ to the four winds, and had never since been gathered together. Nor were they\
    \ now, alas, but it was quite something to have three of them up for sale, along\
    \ with an even rarer mezzotint purporting to be of Old Halob himself. I had so\
    \ much cash in my fugue-wallet that I easily outbid everyone, even the creepy\
    \ agents deployed by Rex Tint's sworn enemy, he who is the man they call \u201C\
    Sting\u201D. I admit I was rather dismayed to be handed the mezzotints rolled\
    \ up into a cheap cardboard tube, but it has to be said it was a fairly slovenly\
    \ auction house, as auction houses go.\nAnyway, when I got home I flattened each\
    \ of the mezzotints out on my kitchenette table, and spent hours upon hours poring\
    \ over them, while outside the siskin, that attractive little finch, sang and\
    \ sang. That is why I have not had time to post anything. I have been transfixed\
    \ by my mezzotints. So let me show them to you, in the form of rough copies I\
    \ have made, just in case the pebbles weighing them down are dislodged and they\
    \ are scattered once again, to the four winds.\n\nHere we see fictional athlete\
    \ Bobnit Tivol as a Christ-like figure, flanked by a couple of thieves, just as\
    \ in the crucifixion. It is thought the mezzotintist Rex Tint made some sort of\
    \ arrangement with his local prison to have a pair of miscreants pose for him,\
    \ hence the startling pelfeusement of the portraiture. As for fictional athlete\
    \ Bobnit Tivol, he's just great, isn't he?\n\nIn this mezzotint, Rex Tint has\
    \ captured the one occasion when the fictional athlete was disqualified for cheating.\
    \ It shows him winning the fourth heat of the qualifiers for the 1926 Scroonhoonpooge\
    \ Farmyard Polevaulting Tin Cup, where, notoriously, he vaulted without using\
    \ a pole.\n\nRex Tint uses his vivid imagination to show how things might have\
    \ been, depicting the same vault but pretending fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\
    \ had used his pole. Old Halob tried to use this mezzotint as evidence when seeking\
    \ to overturn his prot\xE9g\xE9's disqualification, a ruse which failed and led\
    \ to the cantankerous coach being locked up in the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge\
    \ farmyard for half an hour. He was never the same man thereafter.\n\nIt is claimed\
    \ that this mezzotint shows Old Halob himself, pausing on the way to his favourite\
    \ tobacconist."
