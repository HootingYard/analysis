  text: "\nOuta_Spaceman rightly calls into question the caption on this photograph.\
    \ \u201CSurely this is none other than Tiny Enid?\u201D he asks. Indeed, it is\
    \ almost certainly the plucky little fascist, and one wonders why the captioneer\
    \ felt the need to pretend it was a tot called Doreen. Note that the besuited\
    \ chap in the background is holding the heroic infant's lit cigarillo and bakelite\
    \ prize ashtray behind his back.\nThere have of course been innumerable attempts\
    \ to rewrite the true history of Tiny Enid. Readers are advised to rely solely\
    \ on the accounts given here. We know what we're talking about at Hooting Yard."
