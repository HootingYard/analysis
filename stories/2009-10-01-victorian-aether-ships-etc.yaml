  text: "Mr Key has recruited a hare-brained academic with wild hair and smudged spectacles\
    \ to carry out an analysis of search terms which fetch people up at Hooting Yard.\
    \ You will recall that some poor soul came here having sought information on \u201C\
    character flaw of mediaeval peasant\u201D. Among recent phrases of interest are:\n\
    Iron wolf implements\nVictorian aether ships\nJohn Le Mesurier dentures\nMormon\
    \ goat\nHow to make a crow\nHow to cook a cormorant\nI am hoping my befuddled\
    \ academic discovers that the person seeking culinary tips for cormorants was\
    \ Peter Maxwell Davies, the Master of the Queen's Music famed for his swan-eating\
    \ activities. We shall wait and see."
