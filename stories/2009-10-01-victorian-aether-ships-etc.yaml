  text: 'Mr Key has recruited a hare-brained academic with wild hair and smudged spectacles
    to carry out an analysis of search terms which fetch people up at Hooting Yard.
    You will recall that some poor soul came here having sought information on "character
    flaw of mediaeval peasant". Among recent phrases of interest are:

    Iron wolf implements

    Victorian aether ships

    John Le Mesurier dentures

    Mormon goat

    How to make a crow

    How to cook a cormorant

    I am hoping my befuddled academic discovers that the person seeking culinary tips
    for cormorants was Peter Maxwell Davies, the Master of the Queen''s Music famed
    for his swan-eating activities. We shall wait and see.'
