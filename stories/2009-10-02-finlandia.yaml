    \ rather taken aback by the sudden torrent of runology: \u201CHow do you know\
    \ this?\u201D i thought about this for a bit then said, \u201Ci'm just interested\
    \ in runes and things like that. i know people in Finland.\u201D\nIt occurs to\
    \ me that \u201Ci know people in Finland\u201D is an excellent catch-all response\
    \ to just about any question."
