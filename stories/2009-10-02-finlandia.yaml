  text: 'Elberry''s Ghost comes to the rescue of the tongue-tied:

    One student said, rather taken aback by the sudden torrent of runology: "How do
    you know this?" i thought about this for a bit then said, "i''m just interested
    in runes and things like that. i know people in Finland."

    It occurs to me that "i know people in Finland" is an excellent catch-all response
    to just about any question.'
