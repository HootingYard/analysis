  text: 'Here is a verbatim transcript of a snatch of dialogue from my dream last
    night.

    Boffin : You do realise that the entire human brain could be recreated in the
    lab from a single cell of a finch?*

    Mr Key : Would that be an attractive little finch like the siskin?

    Boffin : Sadly, no.

    * NOTE : My dream-boffin speaks false, of course. This is not actually true. Just
    my luck to have dreams peopled by mendacious boffins!'
