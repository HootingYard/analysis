  text: 'Whenever I come upon the phrase "over-egging the pudding", I want to know
    precisely what sort of pudding is being talked about, with a recipe where possible.
    I have been known to ask the question aloud, so keen am I to know. If I am out
    and about, on a bus for example, or sitting on a municipal park bench, my sudden
    cry of "Yes, yes, but what kind of pudding?" can disconcert those who overhear
    me. I have never, in these circumstances, received a satisfactory reply to my
    question, but that is hardly surprising. People just don''t seem to know as much
    about puddings as they used to. I am not sure why that is. It could be part of
    the same regrettable civilizational decline which has seen Received Pronunciation
    disappear from our radio broadcasts and television programmes. You can bet that
    a 1930s bus passenger or a 1950s municipal park bench occupant would have turned
    to face me and said, "Eggy pudding, I expect, old chap", clearly enunciating every
    last syllable.

    I give eggy pudding merely as an example. Remember that the presence of eggs,
    even too many eggs, in a pudding does not necessarily indicate that the pudding
    itself is an eggy one. It might be a plum pudding, a suet pudding, or My Lady
    Kent''s Pudding, to name but a lovely trio of puddings. There are others.

    What bothers me, what has me shouting my head off on a bus or a bench, or elsewhere,
    is the laziness of writers who trot out the phrase "over-egging the pudding" without
    thinking. I would not for a moment dare compare myself with George Orwell, but
    he and I have one thing in common, which is that we like to keep count of our
    eggs. Indeed, I would go further than the author of Shooting An Elephant. I like
    to keep count not only of my own eggs, but of other people''s eggs, and of fictional
    eggs, and of metaphorical eggs. I am Alfred Hitchcock''s worst nightmare. The
    point is, if I am told that a pudding has been over-egged, I want to know by how
    many eggs the recipe has been exceeded, and to know that I need to know the identity
    of the pudding. Is that a crime?

    In this day and age, it probably is. After all, there are council officials reading
    this who think "egg" might mean "for example" in Latin. They might well turf me
    out of my bus seat or bench and take me away to a compulsory brain-sloshing workshop,
    where I will learn that the counting of eggs is pernicious and the identification
    of puddings is antisocial. Until that day, I shall continue to demand an answer
    to my question, because I want to know about the eggs, and the puddings, and I
    make no excuses for being a seeker after knowledge and enlightenment.'
