  text: "I am occasionally cajoled by well-meaning friends and readers to submit stories\
    \ to one of the legion of online literary magazines. I never do. No doubt, were\
    \ one of my pieces accepted, I would gain a marginal increase in readership, but\
    \ for some reason the idea of spreading like a rash over the interweb doesn't\
    \ appeal. I think, too, there are elements of diffidence and fastidiousness which\
    \ make me reluctant to seek editorial approval. Sheer idleness also plays its\
    \ part, for I am happy enough to allow publication on the rare occasions when\
    \ an editor approaches me, rather than vice versa.\nThis solipsistic drivel was\
    \ prompted when I was pointed towards The View From Here. One's first port of\
    \ call is invariably the \u201Cabout us\u201D or \u201Cguidelines for submissions\u201D\
    \ bit. Now, I take an excessively judgmental approach to these things. Is this,\
    \ I ask myself, the kind of website whose imprimatur I would value? Here is what\
    \ The View From Here has to say for itself:\n\u2026 we showcase the weird, unusual,\
    \ thought provoking and occasionally bizarre. We classify ourselves as \u201C\
    Bohemian Eclectic\u201D \u2014 yes, we coined the term. Our stories will make\
    \ you wonder, laugh, cry and generally FEEL something. We expect to elicit a valid\
    \ emotional response from our readers.\nI make no comment on \u201CBohemian Eclectic\u201D\
    \ nor on that peremptory use of the upper case. But I can't help wondering what\
    \ on earth is meant by a \u201Cvalid\u201D emotional response. Here at Hooting\
    \ Yard, we hope for an invalid response, where invalid is a noun, with the stress\
    \ on the first syllable. A correct invalid response is the fey mopping of one's\
    \ brow, the call for a bowl of pap and slops in a weak and reedy voice, the groaning\
    \ of the withered as a poultice or mustard plaster is applied to one's pustules\
    \ and buboes. Reading while shakily downing a draught of Doctor Baxter's Invigorating\
    \ Nerve Syrup is also encouraged.\nNOTE\_: I should point out that The View From\
    \ Here is by no means alone in announcing itself in terms which find little favour\
    \ with Mr Key. There are much worse examples littered around the interweb."
