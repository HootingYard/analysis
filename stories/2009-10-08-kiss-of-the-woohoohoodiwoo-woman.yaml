  text: 'Lend me your ear while I call you a fool. You were kissed by a witch one
    night in the wood. Well, you thought it was a witch, but actually it was the Woohoohoodiwoo
    Woman, broadly similar to, but not exactly, a witch. She kissed you, there in
    the wood, in the night, and then she turned into a crow and flew away, you did
    not see where to, for it was so dark in the wood. What were you doing there, so
    late? You ought to have been tucked up in bed in your crumbling chamber on the
    topmost floor of Sludge Hall. But for reasons known only to yourself, you had
    set your pig-shaped alarm clock for half past two in the morning, and you woke
    and dressed in gaudy raiment and stalked down the servants'' staircase and out
    of the pantry door and along the lane, and when you reached the edge of the wood
    you pressed on, not stopping, though the trees grew denser and denser, until you
    met with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. She kissed you, and turned into a crow, but
    you were not transformed, you stayed just as you were, a fool, in the middle of
    the wood, in the middle of the night.

    Did you expect that you too would become a crow, or some other bird, a linnet
    or a partridge? And had you done so, what then? Did you think you could beat your
    wings and fly, and follow what you thought was a witch to where she perched, in
    the form of a crow, upon the sturdy branch of an oak tree? Remember that many
    of the trees in the wood are smeared with birdlime, and you might have become
    stuck, waiting helplessly for dawn to break and for the hunting men to come and
    break your neck and stuff you into a sack. You need have no fear that such a fate
    will befall the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, for long before morning she will transform
    herself again, from a crow into a squirrel, or a gnat, and she will have no trouble
    unsticking herself from the birdlime for she will use her powers. Perhaps you
    thought that, with one kiss from her, you would be granted those powers? Fool,
    fool! That is not how it works, and never has been, and you would know that if
    you had read your storybooks carefully.

    As it is, you were left alone in the wood, in the dark, kissed but untransformed,
    if anything more foolish than you had been before. What then, you wondered, did
    the kiss portend? And why had the witch, in truth the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, turned
    into a crow and flown away from you? Did she want you to seek her, to blunder
    about in the dark wood trying to find her perch, to clamber up the trunk of the
    oak and join her there in your foolish, still human form? Or did she intend that
    you turn back, once kissed, turn back and trudge all along the lane back to Sludge
    Hall, to climb back up the stairs and into your upper chamber and into your bed,
    and fall asleep, and remember nothing?

    Being a fool, you do not know which choice to make, so you simply stand there,
    in the middle of the wood. Suddenly, above, shifting clouds reveal the moon, the
    cold-hearted orb that rules the night. Through a gap in the dense leafage of oaks
    and sycamores and pines, a shaft of silver light beams down upon you. It lights
    up the mark on your forehead, the crimson mark where you were kissed by the Woohoohoodiwoo
    Woman. You will not see it until morning when, hearing the boots of the hunting
    men crunching through the duff, you gather what poor wits you have, and walk out
    of the wood, not back to Sludge Hall, but out the other side, towards the pond.
    At the pond, you stoop to see your reflection in the water. You see the head of
    a fool, bearing the mark of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. It is ineradicable. And
    swans paddle across the pond towards you, dozens of swans. The mark on your forehead
    begins to glow. It grows hot, until it is burning bright, and you see it reflected
    in the eyes of the swans. They surround you now, white and silent, as you slump
    to your knees at the edge of the pond. They will never let you leave them, You
    belong to them now. They worship you, with the fanaticism only swans are capable
    of. You are still a fool, but of a new, uncanny type. And as the swans gaze at
    you, unblinking, you hear the cawing of a crow, somewhere in the sky above, and
    feel a sharp pang in your forehead, where you were kissed by the Woohoohoodiwoo
    Woman at night in the wood.'
