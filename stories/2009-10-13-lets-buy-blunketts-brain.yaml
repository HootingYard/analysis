  text: 'Listening to the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning, I learned the thrilling
    news that David Blunkett is donating his brain to science. I have taken immediate
    steps to ensure that here at Hooting Yard we do not miss the chance to get our
    hands on this fantastic objet de Blunkett. So I am launching a special fundraising
    drive, dubbed Let''s Buy Blunkett''s Brain! Please use the donate button to give
    generously.


    David Blunkett (brain still inside head)

    To demonstrate our serious commitment to this project, I have already obtained
    a jar in which to keep the brain, and will be rummaging around in the pantry for
    chemicals and liquid pickling fluids in which to preserve it.


    Blunkett''s brain as it will look when extracted from his head

    Obviously there will be all sorts of exciting experiments to be done once we have
    the Blunkett brain snugly ensconced in the jar. I think priority should be given
    to one which attempts to discover why that cow attacked the heroic MP. In a designated
    field, the very same cow, or one similar, will be tethered to a post, and the
    jar containing Blunkett''s brain will be brandished in its face in a threatening
    manner. Will the cow be frightened in its turn, or will it strain at its rope
    and try to attack the jar? Or could there be another outcome entirely, such as
    the cow displaying no interest in the jar whatsoever and falling into cow sleep?


    A cow

    We will only find out if we do all in our power to get hold of that brain as soon
    as possible! Join the campaign today, and give as much cash as you can!'
