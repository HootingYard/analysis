  text: 'A note arrives from my son Ed.

    Hey Pa, he writes, Did you realise that Not Hairy God is an anagram of Hooting
    Yard? I liked that, and I think you will too.

    And I do. I just wonder why I had not already been informed of this by R., the
    sort of anagrammatist-by-appointment to Hooting Yard. Those of you who keep a
    beady eye on the comments here will be familiar with R.''s stupendous work. Though
    R. remains resistant to being anagrammatised himself, for obvious reasons.'
