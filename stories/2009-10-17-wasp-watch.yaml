  text: "Miriam Burstein directs us to what sounds like a masterpiece of wasp-related\
    \ fiction:\n\u201CThis evening, I came across a one-two punch sort of death in\
    \ a Catholic novel, the Rev. Langton George Vere's For Better, Not For Worse (1882).\_\
    \ Early on, the novel's two female protagonists nearly tumble into a quarry; much\
    \ Flashing Neon Foreshadowing ensues.\_ At the end, the Honorable Laura Mapleson\
    \ shoots Lizzie, the younger of the two female protagonists, then chucks the body\
    \ into the nearest \u201Crippling stream\u201D (231)\u2026\_ Righteous smiting\
    \ soon follows.\_ Laura, who apparently failed to look where she was going, stumbles\
    \ into a nest of wasps, and is quickly beset by \u201Cinfuriated insects\u201D\
    \ (231).\_ While trying to rid herself of the aforementioned insects, the Flashing\
    \ Neon Foreshadowing kicks in, and Laura \u201Clay a bruised and bleeding mass\
    \ of humanity in the darksome depth of the old disused quarry, where her victim,\
    \ the palefaced girl, had stood and shuddered, as she thought of the horror of\
    \ a fall into that dreadful darkness!\u201D (231)\u201D"
