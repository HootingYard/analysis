  text: From Wasp Watch to Walrus Watch. Glyn Webster prods me in the direction of
    The Dim-Post and its Walrus o' the Day. I agree with Mr Webster that it is indeed
    a most magnificent walrus. The pedant in me hesitated to link to it, due to the
    annoyingly misplaced apostrophe in the postage title, but I am in a magnanimous
    mood. Also, comment number four, from "garethw", which I recommend you read after
    glorying in the visual magnificence of the walrus, served to remind me that it
    is quite some time since I have been active in my pursuit of L'Oreal. Readers
    may recall that I was outraged to discover the company was claiming to have invented
    light reflecting booster technology, even employing the airhead Andie MacDowell
    to parrot this balderdash in its television adverts. For the umpteenth time, let
    me set the record straight. Light reflecting booster technology was originated
    and developed and concocted and devised here at Hooting Yard, for purposes other
    than hair. One day, I feel sure, L'Oreal will admit this, and get me to disport
    my bouffant in their adverts instead. Perhaps they think I have let them off the
    hook. Not so! I shall fire off one of my much delayed more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger
    missives later today.
