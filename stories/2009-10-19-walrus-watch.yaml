  text: "From Wasp Watch to Walrus Watch. Glyn Webster prods me in the direction of\
    \ The Dim-Post and its Walrus o\u2019 the Day. I agree with Mr Webster that it\
    \ is indeed a most magnificent walrus. The pedant in me hesitated to link to it,\
    \ due to the annoyingly misplaced apostrophe in the postage title, but I am in\
    \ a magnanimous mood. Also, comment number four, from \u201Cgarethw\u201D, which\
    \ I recommend you read after glorying in the visual magnificence of the walrus,\
    \ served to remind me that it is quite some time since I have been active in my\
    \ pursuit of L'Oreal. Readers may recall that I was outraged to discover the company\
    \ was claiming to have invented light reflecting booster technology, even employing\
    \ the airhead Andie MacDowell to parrot this balderdash in its television adverts.\
    \ For the umpteenth time, let me set the record straight. Light reflecting booster\
    \ technology was originated and developed and concocted and devised here at Hooting\
    \ Yard, for purposes other than hair. One day, I feel sure, L'Oreal will admit\
    \ this, and get me to disport my bouffant in their adverts instead. Perhaps they\
    \ think I have let them off the hook. Not so! I shall fire off one of my much\
    \ delayed more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger missives later today."
