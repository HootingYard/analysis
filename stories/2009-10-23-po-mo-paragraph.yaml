  text: '"... we can see those English-speaking academics who are investing their
    time, energy and personal endorsement in the concept of postmodernism as sorry
    figures indeed. They thought they were participating in an exciting and new theoretical
    movement. Instead, all they are producing, albeit unwittingly, is an English-language
    version of a French theory from the 1980s, which itself derives from a German
    thesis from the 1940s and 1950s that was originally developed by a group of ex-Nazis
    to lament the defeat of the Third Reich."
