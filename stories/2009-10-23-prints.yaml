  text: "Proof at last that Hooting Yard's eco-credentials are second to none! It\
    \ is two and a half years since we raised the important issue of carbon hoofprints,\
    \ with reference, I recall, to a vagrant goat god. Well, we were scorned and ridiculed,\
    \ but now, eventually, as I suspected would happen, the world has caught up with\
    \ our visionary eco-consciousness.\nMr Eugenides provides the valuable service\
    \ of directing our attention to a recent study:\nThe eco-pawprint of a pet dog\
    \ is twice that of a 4.6-litre Land Cruiser driven 10,000 kilometres a year, researchers\
    \ have found.\n(Incidentally, I think it was our Antipodean correspondent Glyn\
    \ Webster who created a superb compendium of wisdom by tapping \u201Cresearchers\
    \ have found\u201D into Google. Perhaps he can post it in the Comments.)\nOf course,\
    \ our tireless endeavours to be the most eco-superduper website in the universe\
    \ continue apace. Even as I write, earnest beardy besandalled Cassandras are hard\
    \ at work in the Hooting Yard Eco-Pod tallying up stats on the carbon talonprints\
    \ of a crow, the flipperprints of sea lions, and\u2014thrillingly\u2014the eco-suckerprints\
    \ of various squelchy aquatic life-forms.\nWatch this space."
