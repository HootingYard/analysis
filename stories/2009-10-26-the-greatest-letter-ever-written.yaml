  text: 'Every now and then, I come across a piece of writing so magnificent that
    I consider packing in this whole business. Why continue tapping away when such
    genius stalks the land? This, from yesterday''s Observer, is quite simply matchless:

    Dear Mariella, I have had a long-time interest in beekeeping. Unfortunately I
    have a mortal fear of bees (and similar stinging insects), and neither my partner
    nor I enjoy the taste of honey, rendering the material benefits of keeping bees
    somewhat moot. I have read a great deal of books on the subject and have yet to
    determine just why I am so fascinated by this most peculiar hobby--though I do
    quite enjoy watching beekeepers remove the honeycomb frame from an apiary, as
    I find it quite relaxing. It has got to the point where it is affecting my marriage,
    as my partner is entirely unsympathetic to what she describes as an "obsession".
    I tend to spend most evenings reading apiarist manuals and commenting on beekeeping
    forums on the net, to the detriment of our sex life. I am interested in sex, but
    at this point I am more interested in bees. Is this kind of relationship normal?
    How can I bring my partner round to enjoying my interest in beekeeping with me?'
