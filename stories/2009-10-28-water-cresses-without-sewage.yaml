  text: "\nThis is Shirley Hibberd\u2014or James Shirley Hibberd to give his full\
    \ name\u2014a Victorian writer and horticulturalist (1825\u20131890). I draw him\
    \ to your attention apropos of nothing in particular. By all accounts he was a\
    \ prolific author, churning out books and articles on many subjects apart from\
    \ his specialist field. He wrote beautifully. Consider this, from \u201CThe Instincts\
    \ And Habits Of Bees\u201D, published in The Intellectual Observer\_: Review Of\
    \ Natural History, Microscopic Research And Recreative Science, Volume VI (1865).\n\
    \u201CIf a man has but one stock of bees and is of the right temper to make pets\
    \ of them, his attachment to them will grow so surely that it will be strange\
    \ if he does not, in a very short time, renounce many a commonplace pleasure in\
    \ order to make room in his heart for a strong affection for these happy confectioners,\
    \ and perhaps appropriate a portion of his head to an investigation of their instincts\
    \ and habits, so as to prove for himself all the written records of bee history,\
    \ and live in hope of adding to them the results of personal observation.\u201D\
    \nI appropriated a portion of my head to wondering who this reminded me of. I\
    \ appropriated another portion of my head to discovering the titles of some of\
    \ the books of this proto-Dobson. They include:\nThe Seaweed Collector: A Handy\
    \ Guide To The Marine Botanist Suggesting What To Look For, And Where To Go In\
    \ The Study Of The British Algae And The British Sponges (1872)\nClever Dogs,\
    \ Horses, Etc (1868)\nThe Golden Gate And Silver Steps, With Bits Of Tinsel Round\
    \ About (1886)\nWater-Cresses Without Sewage (1878)\nAnd, in 1856, this:\n\nThe\
    \ photograph of Shirley Hibberd, by an unknown snappist, is copyright The Oxford\
    \ Dictionary Of National Biography."
