    This is Shirley Hibberd--or James Shirley Hibberd to give his full name--a Victorian
    writer and horticulturalist (1825-1890). I draw him to your attention apropos
    of nothing in particular. By all accounts he was a prolific author, churning out
    books and articles on many subjects apart from his specialist field. He wrote
    beautifully. Consider this, from "The Instincts And Habits Of Bees", published
    in The Intellectual Observer : Review Of Natural History, Microscopic Research
    And Recreative Science, Volume VI (1865).

    "If a man has but one stock of bees and is of the right temper to make pets of
    them, his attachment to them will grow so surely that it will be strange if he
    does not, in a very short time, renounce many a commonplace pleasure in order
    to make room in his heart for a strong affection for these happy confectioners,
    and perhaps appropriate a portion of his head to an investigation of their instincts
    and habits, so as to prove for himself all the written records of bee history,
    and live in hope of adding to them the results of personal observation."

    I appropriated a portion of my head to wondering who this reminded me of. I appropriated
    another portion of my head to discovering the titles of some of the books of this
    proto-Dobson. They include:

    The Seaweed Collector: A Handy Guide To The Marine Botanist Suggesting What To
    Look For, And Where To Go In The Study Of The British Algae And The British Sponges
    (1872)

    Clever Dogs, Horses, Etc (1868)

    The Golden Gate And Silver Steps, With Bits Of Tinsel Round About (1886)

    Water-Cresses Without Sewage (1878)

    And, in 1856, this:
