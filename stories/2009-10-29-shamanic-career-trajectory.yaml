  text: "\u201CThe changes in his appearance suggest an atavistic religious process.\
    \ In one of the few surviving photographs he appears in Russian army uniform,\
    \ neatly groomed, but with an intense, monastic appearance, like an Orthodox mountain\
    \ hermit, but near the end of his campaign he rode bare-chested, \u2018like a\
    \ Neanderthal\u2019, hung with bones and charms, his beard sprouting in all directions\
    \ and his chest smeared with dirt. He had gone from monk to shaman in a few years.\u201D\
    \nBaron Roman Nikolai Maximilian von Ungern-Sternberg (1885\u20131921), as described\
    \ by James Palmer in his biography The Bloody White Baron (2008)\n"
