  text: "Carpathian thick potato and sausage soup is a delicious soup from the Carpathians,\
    \ perfect for those long winter evenings as darkness falls and the temperature\
    \ plummets and a chill sets in to your bones. It is very simple to make. Basically,\
    \ you just boil up a pan of potatoes and sausages and add a suitable coagulant.\
    \ When it is thick enough for your iron spoon to stand up in it unsupported, tip\
    \ the whole lot into a bowl and garnish with the horns of a goat or two, for added\
    \ crunch.\nIn the past, entire Carpathian families lived off this soup for years\
    \ on end. It is true that in some cases they suffered from nutritional\u2026 difficulties,\
    \ and had many ructions with the Carpathian goat-herding community, but we live\
    \ in a different age, and can put such unpleasantness behind us. There is no benefit\
    \ whatsoever in reviving ancient Carpathian blood feuds, although of course to\
    \ do so can enliven an otherwise dull week.\nIf you are worried by the prospect\
    \ of a gang of Carpathian peasants hoving into view armed with flaming torches\
    \ and pitchforks, call our helpline. Our staff have been fully\u2014well, adequately\u2014\
    trained in Carpathian thick potato and sausage soup dispute resolution techniques,\
    \ and will not hang up if they hear you screaming for mercy."
