    My thanks go to OutaSpaceman for sending this photograph of a packet of what are
    no doubt extremely toothsome toffee apple sausages. He asks "Will they protect
    me when ghouls attack?"

    Indeed they will. To be more precise, they will actually deter any attack. The
    last point in the government Ghoul Czar''s handy checklist referred to the preventative
    measure of nobbling a ghoul so it is incapacitated from launching an attack in
    the first place. Toffee apple sausages are absolutely perfect for this purpose.

    I need hardly explain why ghouls are simultaneously attracted and repelled by
    this combinatory foodstuff. You do not even need to open the packet. Simply take
    a saucer from your crockery cupboard and place it on the floor, as you might do
    if intending to treat your cat to some milk. Instead of pouring milk into the
    saucer, however, just place the packet of toffee apple sausages on it, unopened,
    and go about your business, whatever that business may be, whether it is pickling
    the tiny bones of a wren or rearranging your collection of Vinder''s soccer coupons
    in their leather-bound album.

    When a ghoul comes a-shimmering and a-groaning into your homestead, it will be
    lured by the toffee apple sausages, and hunker over the saucer, befuddled. One
    cannot speak of its brain being discombobulated, for ghouls do not have brains
    as such. Whatever that hideous insubstantial blob nestling within its ghastly
    head may be, it is not a brain. But the blob will throb in the presence of toffee
    apple sausages, and if the ghoul lingers long enough over the saucer, its head-blob
    will either shrivel or explode, depending on what category of ghoul it is. The
    one thing it will not be able to do is to summon the wherewithal to launch an
    attack.

    It will have been successfully nobbled.

    There is much else that can be said about the commingling of sausage and toffee
    apple, quite irrespective of ghouls, but now I have to go and make a few changes
    to my exquisite hand-drawn map of Blunkett-by-the-Blears.'
