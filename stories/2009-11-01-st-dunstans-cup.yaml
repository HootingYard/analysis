  text: 'St Dunstan''s Cup is the name given to a wassail-and-carousing practice once
    popular in the Fens and the Ditches. In the midst of a wassail-and-carouse, a
    participant would throw their drained goblet up in the air, and whoever caught
    it with one hand upon its descent would become "St Dunstan". Other wassailers-and-carousers
    would then pick "St Dunstan" up, carry him to the yard outwith the wassailing-and-carousing
    parlour, and fling him into a cesspit. After wallowing for a few minutes, "St
    Dunstan" would then heave himself out of the pit, crawl back into the parlour,
    and shout "Which among you is my uncle AElfheah, Bishop of Winchester?" The person
    roaring their head off at the most ear-shattering volume would be dubbed the Bishop,
    and "St Dunstan" would hand them the goblet, which would again be tossed into
    the air, and thus the whole senseless business would begin again. At most wassails-and-carouses
    in the Fens and the Ditches, St Dunstan''s Cup would continue until everybody
    present had been flung into the cesspit at least once.

    The practice is thought to have died out with the development of modern sanitary
    methods of coping with human filth and muck. In those wassailing-and-carousing
    parlours which still survive, it has been replaced by a game called St Dunstan''s
    Tongs. This is a far more complicated pastime, with abstruse rules, and has been
    described as "contract bridge for the hopelessly inebriate". Some Sunday newspapers
    published in the Fens and Ditches carry columns devoted to the strategy and tactics
    of St Dunstan''s Tongs, written in impenetrable prose.
