  text: 'God in heaven knows how he finds the time, but in between bashing out his
    innumerable bestselling paperbacks, bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead has managed
    to familiarise himself with Spotify. Not only that, but he has offered to share
    with Hooting Yard readers some of his so-called "Pebblehead''s Picks".

    So here is the first one. Those of you who are already Spotifyists can simply
    copy the code below and paste it into the "search" silo hub at the upper left
    of the Spotify screen:

    spotify:user:pebblehead:playlist:3SNwkyCdDlxKEPJfBHXnZY

    Pebblehead writes: "I am not going to tell you in advance what this is. Just copy
    and paste and hit play, and listen through to the end. Recorded and performed
    less frequently than some of the composer''s more popular works, it is, in my
    view, twenty-five minutes of transcendent genius."

    Pebblehead knows whereof he speaks.'
