  text: "God in heaven knows how he finds the time, but in between bashing out his\
    \ innumerable bestselling paperbacks, bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead has\
    \ managed to familiarise himself with Spotify. Not only that, but he has offered\
    \ to share with Hooting Yard readers some of his so-called \u201CPebblehead's\
    \ Picks\u201D.\nSo here is the first one. Those of you who are already Spotifyists\
    \ can simply copy the code below and paste it into the \u201Csearch\u201D silo\
    \ hub at the upper left of the Spotify screen:\nspotify:user:pebblehead:playlist:3SNwkyCdDlxKEPJfBHXnZY\n\
    Pebblehead writes: \u201CI am not going to tell you in advance what this is. Just\
    \ copy and paste and hit play, and listen through to the end. Recorded and performed\
    \ less frequently than some of the composer's more popular works, it is, in my\
    \ view, twenty-five minutes of transcendent genius.\u201D\nPebblehead knows whereof\
    \ he speaks."
