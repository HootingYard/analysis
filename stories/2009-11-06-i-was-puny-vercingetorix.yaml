  text: "I Was Puny Vercingetorix\_: a novel by Lars Talc (2003) is not a novel and\
    \ it is not by Lars Talc. It is not a book at all. It is an objet d'art.\n\nIn\
    \ the words of art critic Cosmo Hoxtonwanker, \u201Cit is a bold, transgressive,\
    \ edgy work, interrogating notions of authenticity, desire, and jouissance while\
    \ incorporating both dippiness and a Playmobil figure holding a vacuum cleaner\
    \ under some streamers. If it was for sale, I would pay millions for it.\u201D\
    \n\nIt is not for sale.\n"
