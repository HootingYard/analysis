  text: '"Such is the immensity of this metropolis, so innumerable are its thoroughfares,
    and so widely separated its districts, that one who had passed half a lifetime
    at the west-end of London might well be excused for entire ignorance as to the
    situation of Bethnal Green, Jacob''s Island, Mile-end, and Stepney. They are as
    vaguely remote to many as the Ultima Thule of Orkney or Shetland. It is exceedingly
    probable that we have among our readers thousands who, with or without a map,
    would be utterly unable to point out the localities of Piccadilly Square, Honey-lane
    Market, Hay-Hill, Little Britain, Cloth Fair, Cock-lane, Bell square, Long-alley,
    and Bleeding-heart-yard; and people are born and run their race of life, and die
    within a mile or two of one another, and are as completely estranged from their
    neighbours as though they were separated from them by rocky mountains, by unfordable
    streams, by stormy seas.

    "This London is an amalgam of worlds within worlds, and the occurrences of every
    day convince us that there is not one of these worlds but has its special mysteries
    and its generic crimes. Exaggeration and ridicule often attach to the vastness
    of London, and the ignorance of its penetralia common to us who dwell therein.
    It has been said that beasts of chase still roam in the verdant fastnesses of
    Grosvenor square, that there are undiscovered patches of primaeval forest in Hyde
    Park and that Hampstead sewers shelter a monstrous breed of black swine, which
    have propagated and run wild among the slimy feculence, and whose ferocious snouts
    will one day up-root Highgate archway, while they make Holloway intolerable with
    their grunting. Seriously that may be said of the Londoner, who prides himself
    on his accurate topographical knowledge, which was said in modesty by the great
    philosopher of light. He is but picking up shells on the shore, while all before
    him lies a vast and undiscovered ocean.

    "It has seemed, however, fated, of late days, that the London public should hear
    enough--if not, indeed, too much--of the remote and ungenial region at the east
    end of the metropolis. Murders, actions for seduction, fierce theological dissensions,
    followed by alarming riots, robberies, and murderous assaults--such eventualities
    as these have formed the staple of our most recent tidings from the outlying faubourgs
    of White Chapel, Spitalfields, Mile-end, Bow, Stepney, Wapping, and Rotherhithe...
    To the scandalous accounts of church brawls have been lately added the ghastly
    revelations of the charnel house. The last importation from the East-end is the
    revolting story of the surreptitious disposal of the dead body of an infant, the
    illegitimate child of one Elizabeth Yorath, and which was smuggled into the earth
    in the coffin of an adult person, under the auspices of an undertaker in the Borough,
    and a clergyman of the Church of England."
