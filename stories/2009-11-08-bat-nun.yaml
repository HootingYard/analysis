    This is the Venerable Mother Jeronima de la Fuente, painted by Velazquez in 1620.
    She posed for him while passing through Seville on her way to Manila in the Philippines
    where she was to found a convent. The Venerable Mother was renowned for her particularly
    austere programme of penitence, one which might not go amiss for some of today''s
    unruly hoi polloi. Apparently, she was given to re-enacting the crucifixion by
    attaching herself to a cross and hanging upside down, like a bat in  a cave, for
    up to three hours at a time.

    You can go and prostrate yourself in spiritual abandonment before the Venerable
    Mother at the National Gallery''s exhibition The Sacred Made Real, until January
    next year. There are twenty-nine other works to see, all of them utterly marvellous.
    Catholicism has never been so passionate and gruesome.'
