  text: "Hooting Yard's anagrammatist-in-chief, R., has alerted me to Joel Stickley's\
    \ How To Write Badly Well blog. A cursory examination suggests I can pick up some\
    \ very useful tips there. This, for example, entitled \u201CPresent your research\
    \ in the form of dialogue\u201D, is brilliant:\n\u2018My god,\u2019 said Geoff,\
    \ \u2018so it's true. We hold in our very hands the original draft of the hitherto\
    \ unknown third treaty of the 1648 Peace of Westphalia signed by the Holy Roman\
    \ Emperor Ferdinand III himself.\u2019\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 confirmed Sally. \u2018\
    Who would have thought when we set off this morning for this remote Swiss village\
    \ that we would end the day in possession of the very document which marked the\
    \ birth of modern European statehood?\u2019\n\u2018Certainly not me!\u2019 laughed\
    \ Geoff.\n'Nor me!\u2019 guffawed Sally.\n\u2018And to think,\u2019 Geoff extemporised,\
    \ \u2018the Ratification of the Treaty of M\xFCnster occurred exactly three hundred\
    \ and sixty-one years ago today!\u2019\nMister Dan the Da Vinci Code Man has clearly\
    \ been keeping a gimlet eye on this blog, or I'm a Huguenot. There is much else\
    \ there to split your sides to, so go and visit. It may keep you all occupied\
    \ while I am away. Yes, Mr Key, the so-called \u201CDiogenesian recluse\u201D\
    \ (\xA9 Chris Cutler) will shortly be venturing abroad for a spell, during which\
    \ postages here will be sparse. More details later, when I have packed my rucksack\
    \ haversack knapsack pippy bag\u2026"
