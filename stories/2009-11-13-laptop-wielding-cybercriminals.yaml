  text: 'While watching Die Hard 4.0 the other day, it occurred to me that things
    might pan out very differently if, in films featuring laptop-wielding cybercriminals,
    the malefactors had to rely on PCs using Windows Vista.

    Criminal mastermind cackles evilly and issues a command to his technowhizz sidekick.

    "Upload the virus now!"

    Sidekick nods, taps the keys... and on his screen, a message appears:

    "Please wait. Windows is checking for updates and carrying out several other incomprehensible
    and purposeless activities. This may take a few minutes, or possibly hours, during
    which time your computer will make little whirring noises. Do not power off or
    unplug your machine."'
