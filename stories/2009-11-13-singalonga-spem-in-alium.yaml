  text: 'There are times when one leaps out of bed and feels impelled to gather thirty-nine
    pals or passers-by together to execute a faultless rendition of Spem in alium
    by Thomas Tallis. To assist in this enterprise, here are the words, from the Sarum
    Rite:

    Spem in alium numquam habui praeter in te Deus Israel qui irasceris et propitius
    eris et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione dimittis. Domine Deus, Creator coeli
    et terrae respice humilitatem nostram.

    Englished, thus:

    I have never put my hope in any other but in you, O God of Israel, who can show
    both anger and graciousness, and who absolves all the sins of suffering man. Lord
    God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, be mindful of our lowliness.

    However mindful we are of our lowliness, it may be that in our post-Christian,
    diverse and vibrant community hubs, trendy groovers will want to sing a more inclusive
    version suitable for all faiths and none. To wit:

    Spem in alium numquam habui praeter in te Dobsonius Tractator qui irasceris et
    propitius eris et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione dimittis. O Dobsonius,
    Creator tractati superbus respice humilitatem nostram.'
