  text: 'I am indebted to Ed Baxter (who in turn acknowledges the assistance of Adrian
    Barry) for providing an answer to the question: "Who was on the bill with Russolo
    and Marinetti when the Futurists visited London, performing at the London Coliseum
    in June 1914?" The query was posed by Ed himself, by the way, but, recognising
    that this information would be of immeasurable benefit to Hooting Yard readers,
    he has kindly allowed me to post the results of his research here, including the
    invaluable links. And the answer is:

    Lydia Kyasht, Russian ballerina, b.1885, performing an excerpt from Javotte.

    Helen Eley and Sam Hearn, after their tour of Hullo, Tango! (a successful 1913
    revue--485 performances in the West End -  devised by Max Pemberton and Albert
    de Courville. Music by Louis Hirsch; Lyrics by George Arthurs. Additional songs
    by Maurice Abrahams, Grant Clarke and Edgar Leslie. One song from which "Get Out
    and Get Under" was still popular enough to be performed in the 1960s.)

    Arthur Winckworth, Emilie Smith and George Graves & company in Koffo of Bond Street
    (farcical playlet, four years old already in 1914, featuring popular comedian
    Graves and opera singer Winckworth).

    George French , b. 1876, Scots comedian and panto star who drew on multiple cultural
    personae including a very popular madcap Geordie footballer, chosen to appear
    in the 1912 Royal Music Hall Command Performance.

    Gertie Gitana ("the Staffordshire Cinderella," b. 1887), popular for her signature
    tune "Nellie Dean" (premiered in 1907). Her earnings rose to well over PS100 per
    week and her name could fill any hall. Recorded songs on the Jumbo label in 1911--13.

    Cecilia and Lina Lallier - no details available

    The Nathal Trio - A novel turn. "One of these performers, in the guise of a monkey,
    might be described as Darwin''s "Missing Link". He climbed a rope fixed from the
    orchestra to the roof of the building, gripping with his toes as easily as with
    his fingers, and hanging head downwards from that dizzy height, literally made
    the audience gasp."

    Henry Helme, a "singer from the French Alps."

    In the interlude(s), The Bioscope (films unknown, but likely to be independently
    made in the provinces by small companies and comedic in nature: see here.

    Alfred Dove & orchestra, playing (i.a.) Saint Saens'' Javotte. Dove was conductor
    of the London Coliseum Orchestra, later the musical director for Oswald Stoll,
    who during the First World War put together all-female orchestras. The Coliseum
    retained its male drummer during the War.

    Note: Marinetti "got the bird" for a full twenty minutes from the audience "more
    thoroughly than we have ever heard it given in the history of variety theatres,"
    according to The Stage. Later Marinetti castigated the English newspapers for
    their baleful influence on perceptions of the avant-garde: "the public drank in
    their poisonous garbage." Plus ca change?'
