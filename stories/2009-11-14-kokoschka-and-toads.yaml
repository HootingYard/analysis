  text: "\u201CWhen one opens a door there's something on the far side that was not\
    \ there before. I had a premonition that it would be irrevocable when, from a\
    \ crate filled with wood-shavings or curly paper, she unpacked the death mask\
    \ of her late husband. Even when they were drawing up the ground plan of our future\
    \ house some had thought the choice of site a dubious one, for there was an underground\
    \ spring there in which the foundations would some day be awash. But with much\
    \ labour and expense the water was diverted. There was another disagreeable impression\
    \ I will not pass over. It was like this. When we went to look at the house, which\
    \ was just being finished\u2014the beribboned tree already set on the rooftop\
    \ by the master carpenter\u2014there, in the future bathroom, where the spring\
    \ had been piped and made to provide our water-supply, there was an aquarium such\
    \ as people use for ornamental fish. It was full of hideous creatures swirling\
    \ around in clusters. This was the visiting card of someone I loathed, a candidate\
    \ for the lady's favours, a zoologist who had made a name for himself with experiments\
    \ in cross-breeding. Presumably he had caught these toads here in order to take\
    \ them to Vienna and use them for his experiments in the Institute in the Prater.\
    \ A few days earlier he had committed suicide\u2014this I learnt subsequently.\
    \ So this was his bequest to us. As quickly as I could I emptied the tub full\
    \ of batrachians into the swampy field that had come into existence all round\
    \ the house since the previous winter. What I should have liked best would have\
    \ been to spare her the sight of these fat-bellied creatures, for she was pregnant.\
    \ Instead she had to watch and see how each of the yellowish, disgusting toads\
    \ of the larger sort, the females, carried one of the smaller, greenish males\
    \ to the water on her back. In coupling with the females the males had fastened\
    \ on to their sides with their sucker-feet. It was early spring.\u201D\nFrom A\
    \ Sea Ringed With Visions by Oskar Kokoschka (1962) Though he does not name her,\
    \ \u201Cshe\u201D is Alma Mahler\u2014the actual woman as opposed to the later\
    \ rag doll."
