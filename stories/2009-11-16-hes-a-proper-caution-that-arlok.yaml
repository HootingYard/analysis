  text: "I am deeply grateful to Odd Ends for posting a link to Astounding Stories\
    \ Of Super-Science, January 1931. Why so? Readers already know\u2014or ought to\
    \ know\u2014that I am no aficionado of SF, though oddly it seems some SF-minded\
    \ persons are keen on my work. Mine not to reason why.\nThere is one writer in\
    \ the field, however, cruelly neglected, whom I adore, unreservedly. I speak of\
    \ course of Hal K Wells, a man whose prose was forever pitched at hysteria level.\
    \ Lap up those adverbs and adjectives!\nI have just realised that I raved about\
    \ Mr Wells as recently as last April. No doubt my forgetfulness can be adduced\
    \ to the shuddering miasma of crepitant dread to which my brain has been reduced\
    \ by reading this newly-posted story, entitled The Gate To Xoran:\nThe attack\
    \ of the Xoranians was hideously effective. Clouds of dense yellow fog belched\
    \ from countless projectors in the hands of the bluish-gray hosts, and beneath\
    \ that deadly miasma all animal and plant life on the doomed planet was crumbling,\
    \ dying, and rotting into a liquid slime. Then even the slime was swiftly obliterated,\
    \ and the Xoranians were left triumphant upon a world starkly desolate.\n\u201C\
    That was one of the minor planets in the swarm that make up the solar system of\
    \ the sun that your astronomers call Canopus,\u201D Arlok explained.\n\u201COur\
    \ first task in conquering a world is to rid it of the unclean surface scum of\
    \ animal and plant life. When this noxious surface mold is eliminated, the planet\
    \ is then ready to furnish us sustenance, for we Xoranians live directly upon\
    \ the metallic elements of the planet itself. Our bodies are of a substance of\
    \ which your scientists have never even dreamed\u2014deathless, invincible, living\
    \ metal!\u201D\nYou know you should just stop whatever else you are doing and\
    \ go and read the whole brain-bedizening story right now. Then unjangle your nerves\
    \ with a nice cup of piping hot tea.\nNOTE\_: Checking the link back to that April\
    \ postage, I have noted\u2014not for the first time\u2014some kind of formatting\
    \ problem in older posts resulting in the appearance of extraneous characters.\
    \ I think this happened after the tumultuous and terrifying hacker attack of some\
    \ months ago. Steps will be taken, gingerly, to eradicate these alien hoofprints.\
    \ Until then, just try to ignore them."
