  text: 'My mother had a tin ear and a voice like a corncrake. In spite of these shortcomings,
    she saw it as her maternal duty to teach me a number of songs. I do not think
    she hoped that one day I might have bouquets thrown at me as I took a bow upon
    the opera house stage, it was merely that she felt the ability to sing songs was
    a necessary social accomplishment, like having good table manners or making small
    talk with riffraff.

    It was on the day after my sixth birthday that Ma announced her intention. I was
    happily sprawled on the floor playing with a stick and a lump of coal when she
    swished into my nursery through the butchers'' drapes, grabbed me by the wrist,
    and hauled me off to what she henceforth called "the music room". This was actually
    one of the pantries in which she had cleared space for her spinet.

    She began, inappropriately, by teaching me the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss.
    These were quite a challenge for a six-year-old who spoke no German and was accompanied,
    not by an orchestra, but by a cack-handedly tinkled spinet, and much aggression.

    "For Christ''s sake, Arpad!", Ma would shout, "Try harder or I will set the Grunty
    Man on you!"

    The precise nature of the Grunty Man had never been explained to me, but, like
    all six-year-olds, I was terrified of him. Ma did let slip that his awful rages
    could be soothed by song, and I believed her. Indeed, I still do, so many years
    later. Ma has long been in her grave, and her little Arpad has grown old and frail,
    but I never crawl into my bed at night without putting out a saucer of suet and
    marzipan to placate the Grunty Man should he smash his way into my chalet as midnight
    strikes. When he removes the treats from the saucer, the pressure knob concealed
    beneath it will click up and activate a gramophone player, and the fearsome creature
    will be lulled by the dulcet tones of Dame Nellie Melba crackling from a 78.

    When I had mastered the Four Last Songs to Ma''s satisfaction, we moved on to
    Dr Bogenbroom. This is a 1971 song by Jethro Tull, not one of their better-known
    pieces, and one which, curiously, I found far harder to learn than the Strauss.
    Much of the difficulty was due to the fact that Ma was now accompanying me on
    a wheezy and motheaten sackbut, an instrument with which she showed even less
    proficiency than the spinet. Our family factotum, Mungo, of Carpathian peasant
    stock, had grown fearful of the sound of the spinet after a series of nightmares,
    and had thrown it down a well. Ma resolved to change the locks on all the pantry
    doors, and to banish Mungo to the garden. He made himself a yurt as shelter against
    the snow, for this was a time of great howling blizzards. In the evenings, from
    my nursery window, I would hear Mungo singing away. He had a deep and booming
    voice and sang the Carpathian ditties remembered from his childhood, but Ma said
    they were abominations and nailed fast the shutters on my windows. Thereafter
    the silence was broken only by my own relentless practising, over and over again,
    of Dr Bogenbroom. It took me many months to crack it, but I did. As a reward,
    Ma gave me a new lump of coal to play with. The other one had crumbled, so I had
    been tapping my stick upon the floor, or upon the shell of Mungo''s tortoise.

    I did not have much playtime, though, because Ma insisted I next learn Essay On
    Pigs by Hans Werner Henze. Difficult, brutal, and shouty, these five settings
    of the poem by Gaston Salvatore suited me perfectly, and in a matter of days I
    had them down pat. In fact I learned them before Mungo had finished repairing
    the spinet. Ma had pushed him down the well and made him fetch the various broken
    fragments, then locked him in a linen cupboard with a hammer and pliers and nails
    until he put the instrument back in one piece. She hated the sackbut, as did I,
    and we both looked forward to the day she could bash out her witlessly-arranged
    accompaniments upon the spinet once more. But Mungo was a slow worker, and almost
    a year passed before he was done. During this time, it was my job to feed his
    tortoise, and I became very familiar with curly kale and lettuce, to my immeasurable
    benefit in later life.

    I fear I must pass in silence over the next stage in my song-singing education,
    for it is too painful to recollect. Ma somehow got it into her head to teach me
    Drink Ye Every One The Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come And Take You Away,
    the single--and singular--song written by the out of print pamphleteer Dobson.
    I learned it. I sang it. I can still sing it. But it gives me no pleasure to do
    so, and it frightens even the crickets in my hearth. I will write about them separately,
    by the way.

    Her spinet now restored, Ma''s pedagogic impulses were a-buzz. By the time St
    Bibblybibdib''s Day swung round, she had taught me Che gelida manina, Roll Along
    Covered Wagon, all one hundred and fourteen songs in the collection published
    by Charles Ives in 1922, and The Light Pours Out Of Me by Magazine. Keen as I
    was to crack right on, it was on the eve of my patron saint''s day that I was
    felled by an ague. I lost the use of my limbs, was rendered half-blind, and could
    only croak pitifully. Now, Ma had no truck with the medical profession, relying
    instead on Mungo''s befuddled and, I suspect, inaccurate memories of Carpathian
    peasant nostrums. Most if not all of these seemed to involve gunk and fluid drained
    from the gall bladder of his tortoise, and the chanting of gibberish at my bedside.
    I cannot say if, or how, it contributed to my recovery from the ague, but the
    chanting certainly had a profound effect on Ma. I have said she had a voice like
    a corncrake; now she began to behave like one. After listening, rapt, to Mungo,
    she would lollop off across the fields to the edge of Scroonhoonpooge farm, and
    hide in the wheat, gobbling down insects and seeds and shoots and frogs. As I
    got better, and my sight returned, I noted that when sitting at my bedside she
    was furiously knitting herself a pair of woollen wings.

    By the time of my seventh birthday I was fit as a fiddle. I jumped out of bed
    and scampered to the pantry, keen to begin work on The Song Of Investment Capital
    Overseas by the Art Bears and More Than A Feeling by Boston. Ma had given me to
    understand that these two songs would complete my repertoire, and with them under
    my belt I would never be at a loss to entertain sophisticated people at cocktail
    parties for the rest of my life. But when I pushed open the pantry door I was
    met with a sight so traumatic that it meant I would never become the sort of person,
    with easy manners and social dash, who receives invitations to cocktail parties.
    Mungo was keening his deafening Carpathian peasant chant, and applying a poultice
    made from his tortoise''s gall bladder goo to Ma, who was encased from head to
    toe in a corncrake suit made of wool. She, in her turn, was calling "crex! crex!
    crex!" over and over again. Of the spinet, there was no sign.

    I never did learn to sing those two songs. Over the following year, Ma tried all
    in her power to turn me into a corncrake chick. I was forbidden to sing anything
    at all, even the Essay On Pigs, my stick and my lump of coal were cast into a
    dustbin, and my time was split between hiding in the wheat and being chanted at
    by Mungo in the pantry.

    God knows what would have happened had fate not intervened. Shortly before my
    eighth birthday, Mungo was called up by the Carpathian peasant army reserve, and
    returned to his homeland. We waved him off from the station. He left his tortoise
    with me for safekeeping. It lives with me still, and I feed it on curly kale and
    lettuce, but I have never drained a drop of fluid from its gall bladder. Ma eventually
    came to her senses and shed her corncrake ways, but she never taught me any more
    songs.'
