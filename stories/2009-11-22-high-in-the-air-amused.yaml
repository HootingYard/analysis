  text: '"I have already been subject to abuse and physical attack (pelting with so-called
    ''organic'' vegetables etc.) because of my genetic engineering experiments: eg,
    my production of a new type of electronic bread, enriched with GMOs, which turns
    into toast on a voiced command.--Paul Ohm, Atomdene, Edgbaston"

    From Peter Simple''s Century by Michael Wharton (1999)--my aeroplane reading yesterday,
    crossing the Atlantic. I have never before read the uberreactionary Wharton, who
    is extremely funny and, I learn, was noting the activities of Aztec fundamentalists
    long before me.'
