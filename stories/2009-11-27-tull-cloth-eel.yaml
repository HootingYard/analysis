  text: 'Here are a few notes--by no means conclusive--from Mr Key''s American sojourn.
    Further bulletins may follow.

    I met a fanatical devotee of Jethro Tull, with whom I shared observations about
    the first four or five LPs and the apparel worn by the flautist Anderson in the
    early days.

    I am minded to note that what British people call a "flannel" and Americans call
    a "washcloth" has always been known in my family as a "facecloth". This is possibly
    due to a transliteration by my Flemish-speaking Ma.  It has been decreed that
    henceforth the social networking application Facebook will be referred to as Facecloth.
    All Hooting Yard readers and listeners are expected to adopt the new term exclusively
    and with immediate effect.

    I met a couple who have a pet eel named Peaches. Sadly, I did not meet Peaches
    The Eel herself. (Himself? Itself?)'
