  text: "Here are a few notes\u2014by no means conclusive\u2014from Mr Key's American\
    \ sojourn. Further bulletins may follow.\nI met a fanatical devotee of Jethro\
    \ Tull, with whom I shared observations about the first four or five LPs and the\
    \ apparel worn by the flautist Anderson in the early days.\nI am minded to note\
    \ that what British people call a \u201Cflannel\u201D and Americans call a \u201C\
    washcloth\u201D has always been known in my family as a \u201Cfacecloth\u201D\
    . This is possibly due to a transliteration by my Flemish-speaking Ma.\_ It has\
    \ been decreed that henceforth the social networking application Facebook will\
    \ be referred to as Facecloth. All Hooting Yard readers and listeners are expected\
    \ to adopt the new term exclusively and with immediate effect.\nI met a couple\
    \ who have a pet eel named Peaches. Sadly, I did not meet Peaches The Eel herself.\
    \ (Himself? Itself?)"
