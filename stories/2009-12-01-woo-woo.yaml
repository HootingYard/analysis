  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Vlasto Signalstrength, I read Hooting Yard mostly to
    keep up to speed with the doings of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, upon which you occasionally
    report. I wonder if you could tell me if she is in any way related to Willie "Woo
    Woo" Wong, after whom a San Francisco children''s playground is named? My tiny
    daughter has grown fond of Willie "Woo Woo" Wong''s swings, and is often to be
    heard screaming and gurgling with delight, noises which in an uncanny way remind
    me of the eldritch wailings of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman as she skips and trudges
    around in the dark dark woods on moonlit nights. What can it all mean?
