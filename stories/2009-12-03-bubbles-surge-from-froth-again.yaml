  text: 'Oddly coincident with Mr Key''s presence in the United States, the latest
    edition of the Drabblecast features a Hooting Yard story. Bubbles Surge From Froth
    is read by Norm Sherman, the man who made the words "magnetic mute blind love
    monkeys" sound so eerie and lascivious.

    Norm gives a splendid rendition once again, so many thanks to him, and to whomsoever
    is responsible for the delightful picture of the captain Communist, smoking a
    cigarette and leaning insouciantly against a cow while birds flock in the sky
    above.
