text: "Oddly coincident with Mr Key's presence in the United States, the latest edition\
  \ of the Drabblecast features a Hooting Yard story. Bubbles Surge From Froth is\
  \ read by Norm Sherman, the man who made the words \u201Cmagnetic mute blind love\
  \ monkeys\u201D sound so eerie and lascivious.\nNorm gives a splendid rendition\
  \ once again, so many thanks to him, and to whomsoever is responsible for the delightful\
  \ picture of the captain Communist, smoking a cigarette and leaning insouciantly\
  \ against a cow while birds flock in the sky above.\n"
