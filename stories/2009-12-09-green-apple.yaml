  text: 'Green Apple Books on Clement Street in San Francisco had been recommended
    to me as one of the finest bookshops it would ever be my pleasure to visit. As
    it happened, I was staying five minutes'' walk away, so I availed myself of a
    number of opportunities to pop my head in the door. They sell both new and used
    books, and we all know that a splendid selection of reasonably-priced secondhand
    books is basically what makes life worth living. Here is a list of my purchases,
    carted back to Blighty to take their places on the tottering bookshelves at Haemoglobin
    Towers. In no particular order:
