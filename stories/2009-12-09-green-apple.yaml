  text: "Green Apple Books on Clement Street in San Francisco had been recommended\
    \ to me as one of the finest bookshops it would ever be my pleasure to visit.\
    \ As it happened, I was staying five minutes\u2019 walk away, so I availed myself\
    \ of a number of opportunities to pop my head in the door. They sell both new\
    \ and used books, and we all know that a splendid selection of reasonably-priced\
    \ secondhand books is basically what makes life worth living. Here is a list of\
    \ my purchases, carted back to Blighty to take their places on the tottering bookshelves\
    \ at Haemoglobin Towers. In no particular order:\nH L Mencken\_: Disturber Of\
    \ The Peace by William Manchester\nSartor Resartus by Thomas Carlyle\nThe Post-Office\
    \ Girl by Stefan Zweig\nLolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner\nThe Coming Race\
    \ by Edward Bulwer-Lytton\nThe Sinking Of The Odradek Stadium by Harry Mathews\n\
    The Case Of The Persevering Maltese\_: Collected Essays by Harry Mathews\nSchnitzler's\
    \ Century\_: The Making Of Middle-Class Culture 1815\u20131914 by Peter Gay\n\
    Treatise On The Gods by H L Mencken\nThe Sardonic Humour Of Ambrose Bierce edited\
    \ by George Barkin\nLost Prince\_: The Unsolved Mystery Of Kaspar Hauser by Jeffrey\
    \ Masson\nRaymond Roussel And The Republic Of Dreams by Mark Ford\nSigns Of The\
    \ Times\_: Deconstruction And The Fall Of Paul De Man by David Lehman\nThe Making\
    \ Of Americans by Getrude Stein"
