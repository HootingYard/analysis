  text: 'The following forecast is applicable to all twelve astrological signs, and
    also to three or four of the far more reliable signs in the Blodgett Zodiac.

    "You are followed by an obbligato of hoots and grimaces from a derisive posse
    of ragamuffins."

    This prediction first appeared in Wanderings Of A Globe-Trotter In The Far East
    by Lewis Wingfield, published in 1889. One hundred and twenty years later, it
    shall come to pass.'
