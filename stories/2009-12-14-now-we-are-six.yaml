  text: "I must apologise for echoing A A Milne in the title of this postage. (In\
    \ 1928, in her Constant Reader column in The New Yorker, Dorothy Parker wrote,\
    \ immortally, \u201Cand it is that word \u2018hummy\u2019, my darlings, that marks\
    \ the first place in The House at Pooh Corner at which Tonstant Weader fwowed\
    \ up\u201D, thus telling us all we ever need know about Milne.) But \u201Cnow\
    \ we are six\u201D is, in the present case, literally true, for it was on this\
    \ day in 2003 that the Hooting Yard website came into being.\nThere was, as aficionados\
    \ know, an earlier Hooting Yard presence on the interweb, but it was a static\
    \ site containing a jumble of pre-Wilderness Years odds and ends. On 14th\_December\
    \ 2003, however, regular postages from Mr Key's pea-sized yet pulsating brain\
    \ began tumbling forth, and continue to do so, with the occasional hiatus.\nMany\
    \ thanks, on this anniversary, to the readers and listeners who stalk the muddy\
    \ lanes in and around Haemoglobin Towers and Bodger's Spinney for your support\
    \ and enthusiasm."
