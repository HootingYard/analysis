    "Probably the most curious by-product of the famous Palmer poisoning case was
    a book, published in London some four years after the doctor''s execution [ie,
    in 1860 or thereabouts] which translated the entire trial record, along with an
    account of Palmer''s sporting activities, into classical Greek."
