    \ now\u2026\n\u201CProbably the most curious by-product of the famous Palmer poisoning\
    \ case was a book, published in London some four years after the doctor's execution\
    \ [ie, in 1860 or thereabouts] which translated the entire trial record, along\
    \ with an account of Palmer's sporting activities, into classical Greek.\u201D\
