  text: 'Another thing I learned from Koba The Dread was that Stalin, for a time,
    backed the theories of the linguist Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr (1865-1934). One
    of Marr''s more amusing beliefs was that all words derive ultimately from the
    root sounds rosh, sal, ber and yon. ("Linguisticians who held otherwise", Amis
    tells us, "were jailed or shot.")

    Dobson came across Marr''s work at some point, and as a result produced what must
    be, by any measure, his most preposterous essay. In The FA Cup Final Of 1962 As
    It Might Have Been Reported By One Of Our Troglodyte Ancestors, the out of print
    pamphleteer "channels" the caveman mindset, as he sees it, and constructs a forty-four
    page text of blithering inanity. A (mercifully) brief extract will suffice:

    Ber. Sal-ber. Yon yon yon. Rosh ber sal ber yon rosh ber. Ber. Sal rosh rosh,
    rosh. Yon. Yon sal rosh ber sal ber yon sal yon ber rosh rosh ber ber ber ber
    ber ber rosh yon. Sal.

    And so it goes on. Unaccountably, this drivel scooped up no fewer than five prizes
    during 1963 and 1964, including the Prix Des Brochures Incroyable and the Pearl
    Carr And Teddy Johnson Glistening Golden Medal For Pamphlets Out Of Print Within
    Days Of Publication.
