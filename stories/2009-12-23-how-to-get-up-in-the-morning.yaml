  text: "\u201COn Thursday morning, he awoke heavy, confused and splenetic. On Friday,\
    \ he remembered a friend's prescription that, on arising, he should cut two or\
    \ three brisk capers round the room, which he did and found attended with most\
    \ agreeable effects. It expelled the phlegm from his heart, gave his blood a free\
    \ circulation and his spirits a brisk flow, so that he was all at once made happy.\
    \ He resolved to persist in the exercise.\u201D\nThe James Boswell approach to\
    \ getting up in the morning, as noted by Rayner Heppenstall in Reflections On\
    \ The Newgate Calendar (1975)."
