  text: "During the past few days, postie has been struggling along the lane towards\
    \ Haemoglobin Towers heaving a sack filled, not, I am afraid to say, with seasonal\
    \ greetings cards, but with tear-stained letters from listeners to the Hooting\
    \ Yard radio show on Resonance 104.4 FM. Lazy writers, and those of a hackneyed\
    \ bent, are fond of describing tears as \u201Ccopious\u201D. I thought I had the\
    \ full measure of that word until postie tipped out the daily sack of correspondence.\
    \ By god, every single envelope was drenched, drenched with the salty sobbings\
    \ of ungovernable anguish. I had to make use of a sponge and a mop before I could\
    \ open them and read the scribbled lamentations therein.\nThe cause of all this\
    \ misery is that this year I failed to record a Hooting Yard Christmas Special.\
    \ A twelvemonth ago, if you recall, Resonance broadcast my reading of Sylvia Townsend\
    \ Warner's selection from The Natural History Of Selborne by Gilbert White detailing\
    \ the activities of Timothy the Tortoise, and the year before that I was given\
    \ a whopping three hours of airtime to recite, with Germander Speedwell, Christopher\
    \ Smart's poem Jubilate Agno, a reading which proved to be an historic piece of\
    \ radio.\nAlas, come this year's festive season I simply could not alight upon\
    \ a suitable text. I pondered reading bits from A Withered Garland Of Mawkish\
    \ Pap by Prudence Foxglove, but somehow it seemed too withered and mawkish. I\
    \ was tempted by the idea of broadcasting two of Richard Nixon's Six Crises, but\
    \ was unable to choose among them. For a while I even considered devoting a programme\
    \ to the latest sorry outpourings of beatnik poet Dennis Beerpint, but neither\
    \ I nor the radio station could face the prospect of the inevitable legal proceedings.\
    \ So, with some regret, I threw in the towel, which was a pity, because I could\
    \ have used it to more effectively soak up the tears contained in postie's sacks.\
    \ The sponge and the mop only did half the job.\nAnyway, all I can do is to apologise,\
    \ and to suggest to the bereft that they hie on over to the Wikipedia page for\
    \ Jubilate Agno. Scroll down, and there at the foot of the page, you will find\
    \ a link to my and Ms Speedwell's reading, preserved forever on the interweb.\
    \ May I recommend listening to it in its entirety, at top volume, every day?\n\
    Oh, and I have exciting news! After untold years in preparation, Jubilate Agno\_\
    : The Motion Picture is due to be screened at your local multiplex early in the\
    \ new year. Directed by Mel Gibson, starring Christopher Plummer and using old\
    \ footage of Valentine Dyall and Basil Rathbone, this epic production has already\
    \ won plaudits from my favourite film critic, the grunting and snaggle-toothed\
    \ peasant with a rusty spade who stands, mysteriously, under an elm tree at the\
    \ edge of the cemetery, spitting at crows."
