  text: 'The first thing of note I learned on Christmas morning is that in Berkshire,
    to the south-west of the village of Hermitage, is a small area of land with the
    sonorous name Gravelly Pightles.

    Perhaps a kindly Berkshireist Hooting Yard reader with nothing better to do could
    hie over there with a camera and photograph it, preferably in black and white,
    during a drizzle?'
