  text: 'I thought, today, I would repost that old favourite What Dobson Did On Boxing
    Day and have done with it. But another matter has barged in on my attention, and
    must be addressed. Here is a letter received from moany reader Tim Thurn. It begins
    pleasantly enough:

    Dear Mr Key. Thank you so much for sending me Christmas greetings in the form
    of a black and white photograph of some old bells. If I am not mistaken, they
    look very much like the bells removed from the tower of St Wulfram''s church in
    Grantham, Lincolnshire, in 1946/47, and subsequently recast in Loughborough.

    Tim then starts in on his complaint:

    Though I like the photograph very much, I cannot say the same for the caption
    you have added to it. "Never send to ask for whom the jingle bell tolls; It tolls
    for thee" is, of course, a doctored quotation from John Donne''s Meditation XVII,
    Nunc Lento Sonitu Dicunt, Morieris from the Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions.
    You have inserted the word "jingle", presumably in a hare-brained attempt to lend
    a Christmassy air to what is in fact a more sombre sentiment. That might be excused,
    or even chuckled at, mildly, were you not doing violence to sheer sense. The point
    is, Mr Key, while the bells shown may well have tolled, when in their tower, they
    would never jingle, for they are not jingle bells. Even if we strip away the picture
    and consider the caption in isolation, it remains nonsensical, for a jingle bell,
    by definition, does not toll. It jingles. That is the point of it. A jingle bell
    is similar, if not identical, to a sleigh bell, as deployed in legend by Santa
    and in fact by the Russians, who for reasons of their own attached such bells
    to their sleighs as they hurtled across the freezing desolate steppes, bent upon
    some mission authorised by the Tsar, in the old days. Other inhabitants of cold
    climes, like Finns and Lapps, would also go a-jingling ''cross the snowy wastes
    from time to time. None of them, not the Russians nor the Finns nor the Lapps,
    would ever think to weigh down their sleighs with a big, tolling bell, for to
    do so would be insane. Might I suggest either that you amend your Christmas greeting
    or withdraw it entirely and replace it with something less stupid?

    Tim then provides a list of what he considers suitable subjects, including robins,
    puddings, or a Victorian pater familias placing a bauble upon a fir tree. He is,
    of course, quite right about jingling and tolling, and I really ought to have
    thought more carefully before messing about with the quotation from Dr Donne.
    But for crying out loud, Tim, have you nothing better to do?'
