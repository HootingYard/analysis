  text: "Regular readers will have noted a lack of postages here over the past few\
    \ days. This is due to what boffins call \u201Ca complete vacancy within the cranium\u201D\
    . In short, Mr Key is terribly, terribly uninspired. No doubt things will get\
    \ back on track in the new year. Meanwhile, if anybody can suggest profitable\
    \ lines of enquiry, please do so."
