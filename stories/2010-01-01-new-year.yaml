  text: '"It may take a long time, but my fame will outshine that of Victor Hugo or
    Napoleon. Wagner died twenty-five years too soon to know his day of glory. I hope
    to live long enough to see mine... There lies within me a latent glory of immense
    force, like that of a shell which has yet to burst... The light of this glory
    will fall upon all my works without exception, it will illuminate every action
    of my life; people will avidly dig up information about my childhood and marvel
    at the way I played prisoner''s base... Some people are predestined! Then, as
    the poet says, one feels the brand on one''s brow... The star one bears resplendent...
    I shall never forget it."--Raymond Roussel

    Mainly dry, with sunny or clear periods and very cold. A few light snow showers
    are possible, especially across eastern parts, but any accumulations of snow will
    be small. On the whole tonight will be dry and frosty. Aminadab! Aminadab! Burn
    the pastille, Aminadab! Starting with a widespread frost, and ice on untreated
    surfaces. Most places will have a very cold and dry day with sunny spells, but
    isolated light wintry showers may arrive. Here comes Jimmy Lickspittle, see him
    far away. See Jimmy Lickspittle, fallen in the gutter. Another dry but cold day
    is expected with some sunny spells especially during the afternoon. Light northwest
    winds. The pier, the shearers, the pier, the greater infortune, the lesser infortune,
    the connecting door, the pier, the pier, the blaze of noon. Another dry but cold
    day is expected with some sunny spells developing during the afternoon. Light
    northwest winds. Isolated light snow showers will arrive. Each night sharp overnight
    frosts will occur. I know, indeed, that all around me is wonderful... a dark veil,
    with the foolish words, NATURE OF THINGS, upon it, casts its deadening folds between
    me and their dazzling strangeness. Flowers open, and stars rise, and it seems
    to me they could have done no less. The middle of next week and into next weekend
    will continue very cold with widespread frosts. The frost will be severe in places
    and perhaps extreme in some rural spots. Patchy freezing fog is also likely to
    form, which will be slow to clear and may linger all day in a few parts. The mystery
    of distant mountain-blue only makes me reflect that the earth is of necessity
    mountainous; the sea-wave breaks at my feet, and I do not see how it should have
    remained unbroken. But one object there is still, which I never pass without the
    renewed wonder of childhood, and that is the bow of a Boat. Many western and southern
    parts will be mainly dry with some good sunny spells, although occasional sleet
    or snow showers are also possible. More frequent and heavier snow showers are
    likely in the north and east where further significant snowfall is likely. The
    further outlook will continue cold with further widespread frosts. However, it
    will probably not be as cold as the previous week, with perhaps fewer wintry showers.
    The stars will turn in their courses. The planets will spin. Jimmy Lickspittle
    will lie in the gutter, by the pier, at the harbour, in Britain.'
