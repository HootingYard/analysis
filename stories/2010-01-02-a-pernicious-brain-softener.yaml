  text: '"The initials stood for ''Present Question''. PQ was essentially a conference-holding
    organisation, devoted to the idea of synthesis... The distinguished lecturers
    were not themselves psychologists. They had their own terminologies, historical,
    anthropological, religious, scientific, literary, artistic, political. Their views
    were the opposites to be reconciled... Then there was ''wholeness'' and ''becoming
    a person'', but otherwise not much Jungian undertow, certainly not enough to bother
    me. With the whole idea of the thing, I was intellectually uninvolved. It was
    simply that every now and then I would get on a train to Oxford and spend a week
    gassing with distinguished chaps, many of them amusing. Most of the time, my interests
    lay decidedly elsewhere. Only later did I begin to think of Jung as perhaps the
    most pernicious brain-softener of our time."--Rayner Heppenstall, The Intellectual
    Part (1963)

    Heppenstall (1911-81) was an interesting character. In addition to writing novels,
    memoirs and criticism, he was an early English enthusiast--and translator--of
    Raymond Roussel. There is an essay about him by G J Buckell here, which points
    out that he is forgotten and out of print, and suggests one reason for the neglect
    is that he grew increasingly reactionary with age. Buckell says the last novel,
    The Pier, is "an uncomfortable diatribe... indicative... of a psychological collapse".
    On the contrary, it is a small masterpiece. It is not clear to me why the espousal
    of reactionary views is, in and of itself, evidence of mental instability.

    Here is Heppenstall in fine form, again from The Intellectual Part:

    "It had, as a matter of fact, been on starting to read a poem by T S Eliot that
    I first questioned the good sense of writing poems at all. That had been in the
    autumn of 1940... A copy of The New English Weekly had come in the post. It contained
    a long new poem, East Coker, by T S Eliot. I turned to the poem with some eagerness.
    It began:

    In my beginning is my end...

    "I flung the paper across the room. It was like a signature tune. The poem might
    just as well have begun:

    This is T S Eliot speaking...

    In due course, I picked up the paper and read the rest and no doubt liked some
    of it, as I do now. It is not, after all, in that poem that Mr Eliot bids us so
    oddly to pray for fishmongers."


    Rayner Heppenstall

    ADDENDUM : Speaking of prayers for fishmongers, Eliot may have been thinking of
    this.'
