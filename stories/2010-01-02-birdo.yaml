  text: 'At the risk of deluging you with Heppenstall, I cannot resist posting this
    line from The Intellectual Part:

    "I had never thought highly of Esperanto (my father had once tried to make me
    learn it, but when I found the word for bird was ''birdo'' I could no longer take
    it seriously)."

    I wonder if perhaps I should arrange for Blotzmann''s bird psychology diagram
    to be translated into a birdo psychologyo diagramo.'
