  text: 'Those of you who have been following the comments under Birdo will be aware
    of kerfuffle. Brit points out that representatives of the Esperantists'' militant
    wing tirelessly patrol Blogshire and weigh in wherever they feel Dr L L Zamenhof''s
    artificial language has been in any way traduced. Mr Wellington, on the other
    hand, suggests translating some Hooting Yard texts into Esperanto to see if they
    are thereby improved.

    Mr Key''s Esperantoglot pal Wolfgang Glot has come up trumps (or rather, trumpos)
    and dashed off this "Huad Jardo" paragraph, the opening of A Tip From A Shaman,
    or Pinto El Xamano, as we had better learn to call it.

    "Estis pensigite al mi, de antawurba xamano, ke mi devos prezenti de mia persono,
    kiel parto de, mia falsas la plumaro de hoopoe. Ke ci tio ne estas antaue okazinta
    al mi, estis nenia dubo, ke pro aparta manko de shamanic konsiloj en mia vivo
    supren al tio direktas. Mi irus gis nun kiel diri, ke mi havis aktive, pooh-pooha
    manifestadojn de la mistika cu en la formo de shamen sorqistoj, magiistoj la blinda
    plej see kies tendo estis starigita de la flanko de monto au vojeto, kiu pasis
    pretere, mia chalet."

    Future episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air on ResonanceFM may be conducted entirely
    in Esperanto... although, of course, that may enrage fanatical devotees of rival
    artificial language Glosa. What a quandary! (Or quandaryo!)'
