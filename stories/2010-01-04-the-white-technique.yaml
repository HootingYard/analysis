  text: "\u201COverhead, there would sound a curious wailing from Father Bernard's\
    \ room. When I first heard this sharp cry break out on Monday morning, I had supposed\
    \ that Father Bernard was either having a fit or whipping himself. [Eric] Gill,\
    \ however, had quickly reassured me. It appeared that Father Bernard's vocal cords\
    \ were not all they might be and that he was studying a new method of voice-production,\
    \ invented by a man called White, in which the vocal cords were dispensed with\
    \ altogether and the notes produced by expansion and contraction of the sinuses.\
    \ This did not seem to me possible.\u201D\nRayner Heppenstall, Four Absentees\
    \ (1960)"
