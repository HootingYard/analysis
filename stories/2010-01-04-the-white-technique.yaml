  text: '"Overhead, there would sound a curious wailing from Father Bernard''s room.
    When I first heard this sharp cry break out on Monday morning, I had supposed
    that Father Bernard was either having a fit or whipping himself. [Eric] Gill,
    however, had quickly reassured me. It appeared that Father Bernard''s vocal cords
    were not all they might be and that he was studying a new method of voice-production,
    invented by a man called White, in which the vocal cords were dispensed with altogether
    and the notes produced by expansion and contraction of the sinuses. This did not
    seem to me possible."
