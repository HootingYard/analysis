  text: 'Oddly, I can find no Wikipedia entry for the Blotzmann Dots. Odd, because
    they are without question the most important dots of the past one hundred years.
    They are, of course, odd in themselves. Blotzmann always referred to them as his
    "odd dots", leaving it to the wider world to dub them with his own name. Blotzmann
    was by no means a modest man, but he had his moments of diffidence, and the act
    of dot nomenclature was one of them.

    Blotzmann is thought to have named the dots after Dot Tint, bluestocking sister
    of the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint. In a particularly hectic twentieth-century
    year, Blotzmann and Dot had a fling, and it was when they were holed up in a love-nest
    in one of Ruskin''s favourite Swiss villages that Blotzmann, one snowbound wintry
    weekend, first conceived of the dots that would bring him fame.

    It is possible that the dots are not mentioned by the Wikipedia for security reasons.
    After all, it is their military applications that have changed the world. These
    were not foreseen by Blotzmann, who is on record as stating that, initially at
    least, he considered the dots of most benefit to gardening enthusiasts, potters,
    and hikers. It may have been Dot Tint herself who, recognising the dots'' versatility,
    sent a sketch of them to a bigwig at a top secret intelligence facility. In interviews
    later in life, she denied having done so, and it is perhaps one for the historians
    to winkle out, now that Blotzmann, Dot Tint, and indeed the military bigwig are
    all doornail dead and have long since fed the worms in their respective burial
    grounds.'
