  text: Were he still among the living, my father would have been celebrating his
    eighty-fifth birthday today. And were the thirty-seventh Potus still with us,
    he--Richard Milhous Nixon--would have been celebrating his ninety-seventh birthday.
    I had not previously realised that my Pa was exactly twelve years younger than
    Nixon. If I were a different kind of writer, I might make much of this, and embark
    upon a dazzling doublefold psychological study, of thousands and thousands of
    words. Of course, the result would say a lot more about me than it would about
    either my father or the late Potus. There would have to be an entire chapter about
    mashed potato. Nixon enjoyed the act of mashing, my father enjoyed eating the
    results. And would I find some mystic significance in the number twelve? These
    are deep waters indeed. What on earth would the twentieth century's most pernicious
    brain-softener have made of them?
