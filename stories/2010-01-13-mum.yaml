  text: "When asked how her children address her, the novelist A S Byatt replied \u201C\
    They call me A S Byatt\u201D. This seems to me to be parenting of a decisively\
    \ brilliant kind. It is rather late in the day, but I will demand that the not-so-tiny\
    \ Key nippers call me \u201CMr Key\u201D.\nMeanwhile, if ever I bump into A S\
    \ Byatt\u2014and I well might, in the bookish labyrinth of the London Library\u2014\
    I am going to call her \u201CMum\u201D."
