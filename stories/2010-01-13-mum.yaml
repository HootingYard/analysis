  text: 'When asked how her children address her, the novelist A S Byatt replied "They
    call me A S Byatt". This seems to me to be parenting of a decisively brilliant
    kind. It is rather late in the day, but I will demand that the not-so-tiny Key
    nippers call me "Mr Key".

    Meanwhile, if ever I bump into A S Byatt--and I well might, in the bookish labyrinth
    of the London Library--I am going to call her "Mum".'
