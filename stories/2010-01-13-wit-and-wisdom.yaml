  text: '''he kept on saying things one wished one had said oneself. Of a certain
    mushy spiritual writer named Idries Shah: "These books are a great deal harder
    to read than they were to write." Of a paragraph by Herman Wouk: "This is not
    at all bad, except as prose." He once said to me of the late Teddy Kennedy, who
    was then in his low period of red-faced, engorged, and abandoned boyo-hood, that
    he exhibited "all the charm of three hundred pounds of condemned veal." Who but
    Gore could begin a discussion by saying that the three most dispiriting words
    in the English language were "Joyce Carol Oates"? In an interview, he told me
    that his life''s work was "making sentences." It would have been more acute to
    say that he made a career out of pronouncing them.''

    Christopher Hitchens on Gore Vidal, in a piece here lamenting that latterly the
    great man has turned into a crackpot.'
