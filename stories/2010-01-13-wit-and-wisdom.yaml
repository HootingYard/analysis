  text: "\u2018he kept on saying things one wished one had said oneself. Of a certain\
    \ mushy spiritual writer named Idries Shah: \u201CThese books are a great deal\
    \ harder to read than they were to write.\u201D Of a paragraph by Herman Wouk:\
    \ \u201CThis is not at all bad, except as prose.\u201D He once said to me of the\
    \ late Teddy Kennedy, who was then in his low period of red-faced, engorged, and\
    \ abandoned boyo-hood, that he exhibited \u201Call the charm of three hundred\
    \ pounds of condemned veal.\u201D Who but Gore could begin a discussion by saying\
    \ that the three most dispiriting words in the English language were \u201CJoyce\
    \ Carol Oates\u201D? In an interview, he told me that his life's work was \u201C\
    making sentences.\u201D It would have been more acute to say that he made a career\
    \ out of pronouncing them.\u2019\nChristopher Hitchens on Gore Vidal, in a piece\
    \ here lamenting that latterly the great man has turned into a crackpot."
