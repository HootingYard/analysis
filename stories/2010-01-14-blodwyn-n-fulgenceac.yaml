  text: "Blodwyn was une merveilleuse. She had an orange head. She played spinet with\
    \ great \xE9lan the day before she wed. She married a man called Fulgenceac, one\
    \ of les incroyables. His nose was as the beak of a crow, and he soon lost his\
    \ marbles.\nBlodwyn hired a rowing boat and plied it \u2018cross the lake. She\
    \ gathered herbs and flowers an infusion for to make. \u201CThis will set your\
    \ brain to rights, do drink it, Fulgenceac,\u201D she said when she re-rowed the\
    \ lake, as soon as she got back.\nBut there was rotten ergot in her bubbling hot\
    \ tisane, so when her husband drank it he went permanently insane. Blodwyn had\
    \ to chain him up in the attic of their chateau, and ever after all her days were\
    \ filled with grief and woe.\nIf this story has a moral, it is one I have forgot.\
    \ Just be very wary of contaminated ergot."
