  text: 'I am indebted to reader Mike Jennings who, despite being banished to a pompous
    land, has, in his own words, been "compiling these tentative notes toward a Dobson
    bibliography". This seems to me to be a work of magnificent scholarship. Indeed,
    I cannot begin to imagine how we have all been coping without it.

    Mr Jennings adds "Much work is to be done of course with regard to details such
    as binding, font, illustration etc but I know my limitations.  Such scrutiny I
    will leave to more qualified Dobsonists with the requisite anoraks and little
    grease-proof bags of egg sandwiches."

    The bibliography is ordered according to an arcane system of Mr Jennings'' own
    devising, one the intrinsic beauty of which I hope we can all appreciate. I have
    taken the liberty of applying a set of Blotzmann Numbers to the pamphlet titles.
    Though broadly similar to ordinary numbers, they of course harbour a terrifying
    underlying significance. To paraphrase H P Lovecraft, "the most merciful thing
    in the world is the inability of the human mind to understand the Blotzmann Numbers".

    Unless otherwise stated--and it isn''t--all titles are out of print.'
