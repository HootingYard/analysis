  text: "It is not, I think, generally known that the notorious killer Babinsky was\
    \ also a man of letters. So the imminent publication of The Complete And Staggeringly\
    \ Voluminous Correspondence Of The Notorious Killer Babinsky, in no fewer than\
    \ forty volumes, is to be welcomed. Babinsky, it seems, when he could tear himself\
    \ away from the committal of blood-drenched enormities, wrote dozens upon dozens\
    \ of letters, every day, to a bewildering number of correspondents, some of whom\
    \ actually replied.\nAn unexpectedly high proportion of his letters are on the\
    \ subject of moles, and are of scant interest to the general reader, although\
    \ no doubt those as mole-dazed as Babinsky will find much to interest them. But\
    \ the great fascination of these huge fat volumes lies in the very occasional\
    \ letters written by Babinsky which address wider topics. Those of us who have\
    \ long wanted to know more about the lumbering, murderous, walrus-moustached psychopath\
    \ are well-served by this excellent collection.\nConsider this, for example:\n\
    Dearest Tod [or possibly \u2018Tad\u2019 or \u2018Ted\u2019\u2014Babinsky's handwriting\
    \ was atrocious], I am currently hiding in a cave by the mighty, pitiless sea.\
    \ Can you do me a favour and bring me a goat, so I can slaughter it with my bare\
    \ hands and eat it raw?\nThe very next day, before he has received a reply, Babinsky\
    \ writes to Tod again:\nBeloved Tod, Is there such a thing as a goat suitable\
    \ for vegans? One made out of marzipan or\_No-Egg\u2122 and suet substitute? It\
    \ clear slipped my mind, when I wrote to you yesterday, that I have decided to\
    \ eschew all animal products. While I take a distinct pleasure in acts of sickening\
    \ violence such as the Blister Lane Post Office Horror of a few months ago, I\
    \ would not wish to hurt a hair on a fly's head. I am not entomologist enough\
    \ to know whether flies actually have any hair on their heads, but my point, I\
    \ hope, is clear. When I am brought before the tribunal of beasts, in a dingly\
    \ dell, like something out of a Hicks painting, I want to be able to hold my head\
    \ high, and preen my walrus moustache, and cry: \u201CI vowed, when hiding in\
    \ a cave by the sea, never again to harm a single animal nor eat one, and I have\
    \ kept my promise, O beasts, and survived on lettuce and radishes and many types\
    \ of fruit and marzipan goats!\u201D I will be very grateful if you can sort something\
    \ out, because the night is drawing in and the waves are crashing on the rocks\
    \ and I am getting quite peckish.\nElsewhere, Babinsky can strike a surprisingly\
    \ plaintive tone:\nDear Spleen-Boy, You will probably be surprised at my plaintive\
    \ tone, but I have been sobbing quite bitterly. I have had to take refuge in a\
    \ lair in the blue forgotten hills, because I learned that the coppers wanted\
    \ to have a word with me about the gruesome slayings at Sawdust Bridge. I am woebegone\
    \ and emotional and have pins and needles in various limbs as I huddle here in\
    \ the darkness, listening to the gruntings and howlings of creatures of the night,\
    \ some of which might discover my lair and attack your poor tearful Babinsky!\
    \ What is to become of me?\nFortunately, we know from other sources what became\
    \ of Babinsky after that. Even if we did not, a letter he wrote some three weeks\
    \ later sheds some light:\nHey there, Dot! By now you might have heard about the\
    \ coppers who were found dead in a pit in the blue forgotten hills, their heads\
    \ turned inside out by some inexplicable act of violence. Well, when they do the\
    \ forensics, it will be my great grubby thumb-prints they'll find. But what do\
    \ I care? I fled the scene as they gasped their last and am now quite safe, holed\
    \ up in a seaside boarding-house, plotting an enormity at the docks. If you could\
    \ see your way to stuffing some flies into an envelope and sending them to me,\
    \ that would be grand.\nBabinsky does not state why he wants an envelope stuffed\
    \ with flies. It may form part of his plot, or perhaps he is just being enigmatic,\
    \ as he is in this later letter, also addressed to Dot:\nDear Dot, I have been\
    \ thinking for some time now that you have signally failed to realise just how\
    \ enigmatic I am. This grieves me. You really need to appreciate that when I am\
    \ not committing gore-splattered killings or keeping up with my mole correspondence,\
    \ I am just about the most enigmatic person you are ever likely to receive a letter\
    \ from. Note, for instance, the exquisite notepaper, its edges trimmed with pinking\
    \ shears, its lavender-and-cauliflower scent, and the way I have folded it so\
    \ that if you cut along the creases you will have sixteen pieces which can be\
    \ formed into a lifelike paper model of David Blunkett's guide dog, complete with\
    \ harness. PS: Many thanks for sending the envelope stuffed with flies so promptly.\
    \ I made very, very enigmatic use of it, so enigmatic I am not going to tell you,\
    \ in order to preserve my considerable mystique.\nAt other times, Babinsky was\
    \ more forthcoming about his activities. In a letter to David Blunkett, he wrote:\n\
    Dear Mr Blunkett, I would have you know that recently I have been creating lifelike\
    \ paper models of your guide dog, complete with harness. If you would like one,\
    \ please let me know, and I will send the template by return of post, unless of\
    \ course I am forced to flee from my current hidey-hole deep in the woods, sheltered\
    \ by stark pines and majestic laburnums. Everything is fine at the moment, but\
    \ there is always the possibility that I might betray my presence to the wizened\
    \ old woodcutter who dwells in a hovel a few yards away, and he looks like the\
    \ sort who would summon the coppers. They think I had something to do with the\
    \ Unspeakable Stranglings in Pointy Town last October, which I did, of course,\
    \ but who's to know, eh? Keep it under your hat, Mr Blunkett, if you have a hat,\
    \ which I'm sure you do, being a man of style and substance.\nBabinsky's own style\
    \ and substance were occasionally to be found in foreign parts. Now and then he\
    \ sailed across the mighty and pitiless sea, when, say, the police were hot on\
    \ his trail, or he had it in mind to carry out some foreign killings, or he wished\
    \ to familiarise himself with the ways of foreign moles. At these times, he kept\
    \ up his correspondence with gusto, although he had to make use of airmail, and\
    \ therefore of thin airmail notepaper, of which he did not approve.\nMy darling\
    \ Blodwyn, I am sure you will agree that this airmail paper is far too thin. I\
    \ have a good mind to scrunch it up in my big hairy fist, and then to calm myself\
    \ down by going out and setting upon a foreign person and visiting upon them an\
    \ unimaginably horrible and violent death, possibly involving pincers and bleach.\
    \ Why can't they make the aeroplanes bigger, so they can carry thicker paper?\
    \ If I wasn't lying low from the polizei, I would march into a large important\
    \ building and demand something was done. But I need to keep out of sight, and\
    \ the snowdrifts outside this remote chalet are so deep that I would leave telltale\
    \ tracks, even if I just popped down to the jolly goatherd's hut to abduct one\
    \ of his goats. Thank Christ I put all that vegan nonsense behind me. I will have\
    \ some explaining to do when I am hauled before the tribunal of beasts, but I\
    \ will hope to distract them by allowing the gentle breeze in the dingly dell\
    \ to waft my walrus moustache to startling effect. That worked for me before,\
    \ when I was about to be arrested for the Cuxhaven Poisonings. Those Cuxhaven\
    \ coppers were so bowled over by the elegant quivering of my moustache that I\
    \ was able to make my getaway across the sandbanks.\nBabinsky did not always escape\
    \ arrest, of course, and an entire volume of the collected correspondence is entitled\
    \ \u201CLetters From Prison\u201D. Here is one of them:\nDear Yoko, I was born\
    \ free, but now I am in chains. Please take out full-page advertisements in all\
    \ the major newspapers demanding my immediate release, alongside whatever else\
    \ you might wish for, such as world peace or no possessions. We both know that\
    \ you have global influence, and it will be a terrific boost to your moral fibre\
    \ to use that influence on behalf of a wretched prisoner like me. So get with\
    \ the programme, Missus!\nThis was not the only letter in which Babinsky babbled\
    \ about the boosting of fibre. It is a topic he returned to again and again.\n\
    Dearest Ludovico, I've got some fibre here and I am going to give it a boost.\
    \ If you want to watch, meet me behind the gasworks at dead of night. You will\
    \ be able to recognise me by dint of my walrus moustache, lumbering gait, the\
    \ blood of a freshly-slaughtered goat dribbling down my chin, and my general air\
    \ of seething psychopathic violence. Don't tell anybody you're coming, and don't\
    \ make any plans for tomorrow, or, indeed, for the rest of your life, which I\
    \ can assure you is going to be particularly nasty, brutish, and short. PS: Give\
    \ my regards to your delightful wife and seven lovely children.\nIt is not often\
    \ Babinsky allows himself, as here, to show his tender, sentimental side. One\
    \ of the pleasures of this extraordinary collection is that we get to see the\
    \ notorious killer in the round, warts, more warts, and even more warts. The warts,\
    \ of course, were usually hidden under that majestic moustache. As he wrote to\
    \ the Tod, or Ted, or Tad we met earlier:\nDear Tod, I feel I must let you know\
    \ that my warts are mostly hidden under my majestic walrus moustache. Forever\
    \ yours, Babinsky.\nSomehow, those words serve as an epitaph of sorts."
