  text: "Nowadays, if I understand these things correctly, long distance runners rehydrate\
    \ themselves by glugging lots of water during a race. Such namby-pamby methods\
    \ were alien to the doughty amateurs who ran the twenty-six mile Marathon at the\
    \ 1908 Olympic Games in London. Among their refreshments along the route were\
    \ muscatel grapes, calves\u2019 foot jelly with lemon, new-laid eggs soaked in\
    \ tea, orange segments, brandy, champagne, and small doses of strychnine.\nSo\
    \ I learned from The First London Olympics 1908 by Rebecca Jenkins (2008)\n"
