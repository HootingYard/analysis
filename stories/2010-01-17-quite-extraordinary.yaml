  text: 'It is quite extraordinary. I had no idea, when I posted, yesterday, the first
    in a projected series of photographs of notable authors sitting on swans, that
    it would prove to be the most popular item to appear anywhere on the interweb,
    ever. According to the statistics churned out by my Blotzmannometer, attached
    to the computer via a pneumatic funnel, that one blog postage has been viewed
    by billions of people, in every nation on earth, as well as by further billions
    of beings on far-flung planetoids, those, obviously, which have interweb connection
    infrastructure in place. Clearly there is something about a notable author sitting
    on a swan which speaks to people''s deepest yearnings. The picture is more popular
    even than such interweb hits as a video of a cat behaving foolishly, an amateur
    diva belting out a songlet, or the e-book download of The Anatomy Of Melancholy.

    And now my postbox is crammed full of photographs--many quite brazenly counterfeit--of
    other authors sitting on other swans. Many of these seem to have been sent by
    the writers themselves, keen to jump on the bandwagon. (Note to Jeanette Winterson--please
    desist. In any case, by the look of it, that is not a real swan.) Others are crude
    Photoshop fabrications showing, I presume, the sender''s favourite writer superimposed
    on a swan. I must admit I never realised just how many fans A S Byatt has.

    I have taken on a team of otherwise unemployable ragamuffins to sift through the
    mountain of pictures and to pick out the ones that appear genuine. Also, I have
    drummed in to their scruffy little heads that the series title is Notable Authors
    Sitting On Swans, to make sure they discard the Zadie Smiths and Adam Thirlwells
    of this benighted world.

    Oh, and it goes without saying that I am doing my utmost to track down a photograph
    of the twentieth century''s titanic pamphleteer, Dobson, sitting on a swan. I
    am not holding out much hope, though, for Dobson was notoriously camera-shy. Indeed,
    he usually attacked with a hammer anybody trying to take a snap of him with their
    box camera. He was that kind of pamphleteer.'
