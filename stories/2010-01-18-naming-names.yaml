  text: '"Odd names crop up in all Roussel''s texts, and we know he had extreme difficulty
    in arriving at each final choice. Leiris records that he sometimes asked Eugene
    Vallee, the overseer at the Lemerre printing house, to fill in the blanks or initials
    he had left in the manuscript, but then invariably replaced Vallee''s suggestions
    with other names. La Seine contains an especially eccentric range: Ernest Arson,
    Buss, Bopp, Burc, Bals, Roolf, Pauline Bux, Orry, Raga, Saerck, Eche, Renee Wunster,
    Lay... The manuscripts offer no indication as to how he arrived at these names."
