  text: "\u201COdd names crop up in all Roussel's texts, and we know he had extreme\
    \ difficulty in arriving at each final choice. Leiris records that he sometimes\
    \ asked Eug\xE8ne Vall\xE9e, the overseer at the Lemerre printing house, to fill\
    \ in the blanks or initials he had left in the manuscript, but then invariably\
    \ replaced Vall\xE9e's suggestions with other names. La Seine contains an especially\
    \ eccentric range: Ernest Arson, Buss, Bopp, Burc, Bals, Roolf, Pauline Bux, Orry,\
    \ Raga, Saerck, \xC8che, Ren\xE9e Wunster, Lay\u2026 The manuscripts offer no\
    \ indication as to how he arrived at these names.\u201D\nFootnote in Raymond Roussel\
    \ And The Republic Of Dreams by Mark Ford (2000)"
