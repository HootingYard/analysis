  text: "One blustery and bitter springtime morning, Tiny Enid decided to make a goodly\
    \ supply of bathtub gin. The plucky tot was wholly ignorant about the distillation\
    \ of spiritous liquors, but she was a resourceful girl, and so she clumped with\
    \ great determination along the streets, past the duckpond and the hazardous waste\
    \ facility, to her local library. Now, it may surprise some younger readers, but\
    \ in those days of Tiny Enid's tinydom, libraries were filled with books, and\
    \ had not yet become chat \u2018n\u2019 snack zones for diverse and vibrant hoodie\
    \ teenpersons. So the heroic infant was able to gen up on all she needed to know\
    \ about the making of bathtub gin by consulting a selection of large and impressive\
    \ volumes in the reference section. Having crammed her sparkling brain with information,\
    \ Tiny Enid picked up all the things she would need as she made her way home,\
    \ taking a different route which took her past the badger sanctuary and the moonshine\
    \ supplies emporium.\nWith her usual excessive, if not deranged, zeal, Tiny Enid\
    \ set to work, and soon had a bathtub full of gin. This she decanted into a jerrybuilt\
    \ vat, and proceeded with a second bathtubful. Only when the vat was filled to\
    \ the brim with rotgut gin did Tiny Enid relax, sitting down in her favourite\
    \ armchair, smoking a cheroot, and listening to gramophone records of Xavier Cugat\
    \ And His Orchestra.\nWhile at the library, Tiny Enid had taken the opportunity\
    \ to borrow an instructive book, by Gabbitas, entitled Large-Scale Sabotage Of\
    \ Civic Plumbing Infrastructure. She speed-read this while gobbling down her supper\
    \ of jugged hare and bloater paste sandwiches, so that before bedtime she was\
    \ able to pipe her vat of bathtub gin into the local water supply.\nBy the afternoon\
    \ of the following day, Tiny Enid was pleased to note that the whole town was\
    \ a scene of moral degradation and unparalleled debauch, a Hogarth print come\
    \ to life. She checked that her vat was now empty, readjusted the piping system\
    \ back to normal, plunked a cloche hat on her head, and went out into the teeming\
    \ streets to set the world to rights.\nMany, many years later, when she wrote\
    \ her Memoirs, Tiny Enid explained:\nIt can be difficult to imagine the frustrations\
    \ of a brave, adventurous tot, such as I was, growing up in a peaceable, indeed\
    \ an idyllic, little townlet. Those who have read Lark Rise To Candleford by Flora\
    \ Thompson, or watched the television adaptation, may have some idea how few opportunities\
    \ I was granted to perform acts of heroic derring-do, when everybody was basically\
    \ quite well-behaved and knew their place. I much preferred situations of chaos\
    \ and abandonment, in which I was able to assert my Fascist Supertiny persona.\
    \ The poisoning of the town's water supply with bathtub gin was one of my more\
    \ successful provocations. And while some might have used it to preach and hand\
    \ out temperance tracts, I had a good deal of fun kicking people in the head and\
    \ shouting my head off until they all sobered up. After that, they began to realise\
    \ who they were dealing with. They even struck a medal for me, to commemorate\
    \ the way in which I dragged the town back from the brink of moral collapse.\n\
    My oh my, she was a proper caution, that Tiny Enid."
