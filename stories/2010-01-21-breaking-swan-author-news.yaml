  text: "Reader Fitzmaurice Trenery has been studying very carefully number one in\
    \ our series of Notable Authors Sitting On Swans, and has reached a startling\
    \ conclusion:\n\u201CMr Key\_: Contrary to the description of the photograph,\
    \ it seems to me that it depicts the wondrous accidental meeting of two benighted\
    \ creatures, the swan-headed child and the child-headed swan. See how they embrace,\
    \ each chimera recognising in the other his own misery. The chin of the newly-confident\
    \ child-headed swan seems to jut in new-found defiance of the world! I'm not sure\
    \ if a beak can jut, so I shall reserve judgement on the swan-headed child\u2014\
    in any case it seems to me an altogether more ambiguous character. Such a firm\
    \ grip on the child-headed swan's neck; I infer here the crafty sense in the swan-headed\
    \ child's tiny bonce that it is the benefactor of this symbiotic relationship.\
    \ After all, the swan-headed child may be dextrous and bipedal, but it is led\
    \ around by a pea-sized brain. The child-headed swan, for its part, has a fey,\
    \ ethereal beauty\u2026 but when the head matures into adulthood the neck will\
    \ be powerless to support it, and what then? What then?\u201D\nThough I would\
    \ swear by the crumpled cloth of Anaxagrotax's winding-sheet that the snap does\
    \ indeed show Raymond Roussel as a tiny, so forceful and convincing is Mr Trenery's\
    \ argument that I am putting the series on hold pending further investigations.\
    \ I have it in mind to employ for the purpose Agence Goron, the detective agency\
    \ commissioned by Roussel to find and negotiate with an illustrator to provide\
    \ the drawings for New Impressions Of Africa (1932)."
