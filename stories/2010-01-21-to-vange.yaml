  text: "To Vange! We set out, the champ, the widow, and me, at break of dawn, hoping\
    \ to make Vange before nightfall. I knew little about my travelling companions.\
    \ I had no idea, for example, of what the champ was a champion, nor did I know\
    \ whose relict the widow was, nor for how long she had been wearing her widow's\
    \ weeds. They, in their turn, must have known almost nothing about me, save perhaps\
    \ that I was a fanatical devotee of Trebizondo Culpeper, whose glorious image\
    \ shot forth rays of golden light from the badge I wore upon my tunic.\nOur donkeys\
    \ we had abducted, with great daring, in broad daylight, from the beach where\
    \ they were employed to give rides to holidaying urchins. They were sturdy beasts,\
    \ with a surprising elegance in their carriage. I was well aware, as were the\
    \ champ and the widow, that laws exist to regulate the number of hours a donkey\
    \ may be worked, but I spat in the face of the laws, and my companions did too.\
    \ We were determined to get to Vange in a single day, and if in so doing we were\
    \ to exhaust our donkeys, then so be it. Trebizondo Culpeper's recorded pronouncements\
    \ on donkeys are gnomic, to say the least, and though I could not claim to have\
    \ a full understanding of them, I felt sure we were following the right path.\n\
    By \u201Cpath\u201D, I mean of course the Way of Trebizondo Culpeper, not the\
    \ path to Vange. Accustomed as they were to the golden strands of their seaside\
    \ resort, our abducted donkeys would have been utterly discombobulated had we\
    \ led them along the main arterial trunk road to Vange, with its thundering traffic\
    \ of container lorries and speed-phrenzied vanborne riffraff. We chose instead\
    \ to make our way across fields and greensward, taking the occasional quiet country\
    \ lane or abandoned railway line where the opportunity arose. We had no map. Instead,\
    \ we relied on the widow's profound, and in many ways unnerving knowledge of the\
    \ lie of the land. In less enlightened times they would have burned her for a\
    \ witch.\nOf\_ the three of us, only the champ had previously been to Vange. One\
    \ of the early heats in his progress to the championship had been due to take\
    \ place at Vange Marshes, and the champ was billeted in the village beforehand.\
    \ In the event, the contest was cancelled because of an unprecedented starling\
    \ storm, teeming millions of birds swooping over the marshes, and the champ and\
    \ his rivals were driven away in charabancs to a new location. When he spoke,\
    \ which was rarely, the champ's speech was punctuated with chuckles which I found\
    \ mightily disconcerting.\nMy own knowledge of Vange was based on a rotogravure\
    \ by the noted rotogravurist Rex Rotograv, which had been presented to me as a\
    \ prize for pursuivance by Trebizondo Culpeper's Inner Circle. I pored over this\
    \ picture for hours and hours, drinking in every detail, until I felt as if I\
    \ knew Vange itself. In truth, of course, I knew nothing, nothing whatsoever,\
    \ of Vange, of Vange Marshes, of anything at all, in essence. In The Ungrateful\
    \ Beggar (1898) L\xE9on Bloy reports his mother telling him: \u201CMy dear child,\
    \ it is true you're an ox, but an ox whose bellowings will one day astonish Christendom\u201D\
    . Through diligent study of the Way of Trebizondo Culpeper, I had eventually had\
    \ drummed into me my own ox-like stupidity. I had high hopes that my visit to\
    \ Vange might inspire my bellowings, which to date had been few, and those few\
    \ incoherent.\nWhen I published an account of an earlier journey by abducted donkey,\
    \ to a village that I mistook for Vange, it was suggested to me that I ought to\
    \ have included, through a kind of ventriloquism, the donkey's \u201Cthoughts\
    \ and observations\u201D. There are narratives that go in for that sort of thing,\
    \ and no doubt readers who lap it up. But Trebizondo Culpeper expressly forbids\
    \ such misuse of our talents, if talents we have, and he is surely right to do\
    \ so. On the present occasion, we had not even learned our donkeys\u2019 names,\
    \ and that would have been a necessary precursor to any attempt to burrow into\
    \ their interior beings. For logistical purposes, before we had even got clear\
    \ of the beach, the widow had assigned to each donkey a nonce name, but her choices\
    \ were long-winded and multisyllabic and did not serve their purpose. I have forgotten\
    \ what they were.\nI have forgotten more than that. But what I remember with absolute\
    \ clarity, as if it were yesterday, is how, as day became dusk and dusk darkened\
    \ to night, the champ, the widow, and I, upon our donkeys, guided at the last\
    \ by a star burning bright against the black, reached the end of our journey.\
    \ There was Vange! And there, closer still, so close we could stop and dismount\
    \ and make the last few yards on foot, was Vange Well No. 5! The domed building,\
    \ like a Grecian temple, was falling to ruin after years of neglect, its structure\
    \ cracked in places, a cross beam detached, the render upon the exterior walls\
    \ in need of replacement, and little remaining of the original lettering. There\
    \ was still evidence of the other wells close by, and hidden in the undergrowth\
    \ was the concrete hard standing, where once stood a large wooden hut that was\
    \ used for storage. This was the last of five wells sunk following the discovery,\
    \ over a century ago, of magic water by self-styled farmer Edwin Cash. It was\
    \ highly sulphated, and he bottled it and sold it, labelled as Farmer Cash's Famous\
    \ Medicinal Vange Water, extolling its great medicinal value in curing such ailments\
    \ as lumbago, stomach troubles, rheumatoid complaints, and nervous disorders.\
    \ But then the sanatorium was built nearby, on higher ground, and its drainage\
    \ system contaminated the magic water, and the business collapsed, just as the\
    \ structure of Vange Well No. 5 was in a state of collapse, just as, after a day\
    \ riding our abducted donkeys, the widow, the champ, and I were close to collapse.\
    \ We had strength enough, though, working together, to sink our siphons into the\
    \ ground and suck up the magic water. We cared not that it was contaminated. In\
    \ the night, on the outskirts of Vange, we drank our fill, each for our own reasons.\n\
    The champ, plagued by lumbago, fearing that next season he would fail to retain\
    \ his championship, drank the magic water. The widow, martyred by stomach troubles\
    \ and rheumatoid complaints, drank the magic water. And me, with my nervous disorders\
    \ and my fanatical devotion to Trebizondo Culpeper? I drank the magic Vange water\
    \ too. I drank deep.\nAbove us, the bright burning star was extinguished, and\
    \ we were engulfed in darkness. We could no longer see each other, nor our abducted\
    \ donkeys. We could no longer see even the crumbling ruin of Vange Well No. 5.\
    \ We waited for the dawn, for a new day, for the transfiguration wrought upon\
    \ each of us by the magic water of Vange."
