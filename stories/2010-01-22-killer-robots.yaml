  text: 'I was startled, to say the least, when I read that, some years ago, the Prime
    Minister of Japan was attacked and almost slain by a deranged killer robot. Imagine
    the kerfuffle if such a thing had happened to one of our own past Prime Ministers,
    Harold Macmillan, say, or Neville Chamberlain. (It was Lloyd George who remarked
    that Chamberlain had "a wrong-shaped head". Lord knows what he would have made
    of the bonce of a killer robot.)

    Alas, it appears from the video kindly posted by Mr Eugenides that the PM-robot
    encounter was not quite as blood-curdling as we are led to believe. This just
    goes to show that you simply cannot trust most of what you read, either in newspapers
    or on the interweb. One shining exception, of course, is Hooting Yard. I am regularly
    discomfited when it is suggested that I make a lot of this stuff up, whereas I
    spend untold hours engaged in rigorous, yes, damned rigorous research to bring
    you the nuggets of wisdom contained herein. Only yesterday, after To Vange! was
    posted here,  I had to put up with mutterings about the allegedly fictional nature
    of Vange Well No. 5, for goodness'' sake! Get a grip, readers. You will certainly
    never find me babbling on about killer robots attacking veteran politicians. Cows
    attacking Blunkett, yes. There is a difference.'
