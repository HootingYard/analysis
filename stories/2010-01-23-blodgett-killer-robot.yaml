  text: "Blodgett, of course, was often mistaken for a killer robot, whenever he went\
    \ rampaging around remote rural airfields and landing strips dressed in an outfit\
    \ of tin foil and sheet metal with plastic, bakelite, and glass adornments. Why,\
    \ might one ask, did he make such a spectacle of himself, repeatedly?\nLuckily,\
    \ we have evidence from Blodgett himself. He was interviewed on the television\
    \ chat show Let's Talk To People Who Rampage Around Remote Rural Airfields And\
    \ Landing Strips!, which was screened on the Swivel-eyed Nutcase TV Channel for\
    \ several months in the early 1970s. I have scoured YouTube for a clip without\
    \ success, but a transcript exists, which I got hold of through bribery, subterfuge,\
    \ and threats of violence. Alas, it is incomplete, but a fragment is better than\
    \ nothing.\nCheesy Host\_: Our next guest will probably surprise you, because\
    \ it's a killer robot! [Chortles.] Not really! It's just Blodgett, in an outfit\
    \ that makes him look like a killer robot! Give him a big hand!\n[Tumultuous applause.]\n\
    Cheesy Host\_: Welcome to the show, Blodgett.\nBlodgett\_: Yava Hoosita!\nCheesy\
    \ Host\_: Ho ho ho! Indeed! I think what our lovely audience want to know is why\
    \ you rampage around remote rural airfields and landing strips dressed like that.\n\
    [Tumultuous hoots of agreement from the audience.]\nBlodgett\_: Well, Sacheverell,\
    \ as you know, we are under serious threat from Communists. Stalin may be dead\
    \ these twenty years, but the Soviet beast has never been in such rude health.\
    \ We could be overrun by the Red Hordes tomorrow, unless we take every precaution\
    \ possible.\n[Applause both tumultuous and thunderous, save from a beardy cardigan-wearing\
    \ Open University lecturer.]\nCheesy Host\_: We all agree with that, Blodgett!\
    \ But how does your rampaging around remote rural airfields and landing strips\
    \ dressed as a killer robot help the fight against international Communism?\n\
    Blodgett\_: I have a one-word answer to that, Sacheverell\u2026\nAnnoyingly, the\
    \ transcript ends there."
