  text: '"Detailed and annotated mixed-media images of heroic flying machines--Barnum
    and Bailey, Buck Rogers and Jules Verne all stirred together--mazes of exotic
    detail, circus-tent gas-bags, bicycle wheels, belts and pulleys--crazily painted
    pods shaped like the space shuttle boosters..."

    The work of Charles Dellschau, a Prussian butcher resident in Texas, and member
    of the Sonora Aero Club secret society, obsessed with airships. Read a potted
    biography here, and look at some gorgeous pictures here. And for the next few
    weeks, those of you in or visiting London can see original works at the Museum
    Of Everything.
