  text: '"I am sorry there are such occasions to clean your pebbles; you must make
    use of the powder to them by putting it in anything of substance, wherein it will
    not swim a-top of the water."

    "On Sunday morning, I again examined Mr Blandy. He seemed much relieved, but,

    and ulcers."

    "I always thought there was mischief in those cursed Scotch pebbles."

    Four extracts from an account of the case of Mary Blandy, given in Tales Of The
    Newgate Calendar by Rayner Heppenstall (1981)'
