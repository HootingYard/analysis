  text: "\u201CA few months after my father had diagnosed this case, an assault of\
    \ the same nature was committed on another little girl living in the same house.\
    \ In this case, however, the victim survived and was able to point out the criminal\u2014\
    an imbecile, afflicted with goitre, stammering, strabismus, hydrocephaly, trochocephaly,\
    \ and plagiocephaly, with arms of disproportionate length, the son and grandson\
    \ of drunkards, who confessed the double crime and entreated pardon for the \u2018\
    trifling offence\u2019 since he had always done his duty and swept the staircase,\
    \ even on the day he committed the crime.\u201D\nFrom Criminal Man, According\
    \ To The Classification Of Cesare Lombroso Briefly Summarised By His Daughter,\
    \ Gina Lombroso-Ferrero (1911). This was No. 27 in \u201CThe Science Series\u201D\
