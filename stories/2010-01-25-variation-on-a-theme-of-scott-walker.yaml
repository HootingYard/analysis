  text: 'His mother called him Ivan, then she died. His name was actually Dennis,
    but his mother was in the throes of death-rattle delirium, and she mistook him
    for the priest, Father Ivan Plunkett, who had been at her bedside but a moment
    ago. He had popped out to rinse his rosary beads under a spigot, because they
    were caked with muck. One does not often see a priest carrying a set of filthy
    rosary beads, but Father Ivan Plunkett''s parish rounds took him to many farmyards
    and barnyards, and through many puddles and ditches. Dennis''s mother''s was not
    the only death he witnessed that day. At certain times of year there is much slaughter
    on farms, much, much slaughter, and this was one of those times. Father Ivan Plunkett
    rinsed the muck from his rosary beads only to have them steeped in the blood of
    a hen before an hour had passed. He rinsed that blood away too, into a farmyard
    gutter, and he did not weep.

    Back at the house, Dennis sat looking at his mother in her winding-sheet. He was
    perplexed that she had called him Ivan, for he had not put two and two together.
    He was soft in the head, and a worrier. If he was Ivan, he wondered, where was
    Dennis? He decided to set off in search of Dennis. That is, in search of himself.
    He put on his boots and a cloak and trudged out in the rain, squelching through
    the mud, calling "Dennis! Dennis!" in his surprisingly booming baritone until
    his throat was raw. Only the birds perched in the windswept trees answered him,
    cawing and cooing and chirruping, but Dennis was not so soft in the head that
    he thought one of the myriad birds was Dennis.

    Father Ivan Plunkett returned to his presbytery shattered by death. His housekeeper,
    Mrs Clank, a widow, made him a pot of tea. The pot was shrouded in a tea-cosy
    she had knitted for him, with great expertise, depicting, in wool, the martyrdom
    of Saint Spivack. His had been a gruesome death, and Mrs Clank had had much need
    of wool dyed deep red, for all the blood that spurted from poor Saint Spivack
    in his agony. It was a scene of great meaning for the housekeeper, for her late
    husband had died, fourteen years before, in an almost identical manner, at the
    hands of brigands. But he had not died for his faith, and so had not been canonised.
    Mrs Clank was too much of a realist to hope he ever would be. She busied herself
    dusting a statue of the BVM while Father Ivan Plunkett drank his tea and groaned.

    Failing to find the shadow Dennis in the fields and farms thereabouts, Dennis
    was reluctant to return to the house of death wherein his mother lay, so he made
    for the village. He called in at the tattooist, and had the name IVAN emblazoned
    across his puny chest. He wanted it on his forehead, but the tattooist was an
    ethical man with a code to which he kept, against all blandishments. He knew Dennis,
    for as well as conducting his tattoo business, he piloted an air ambulance, and
    had many a time flown to Dennis''s mother''s bedside in recent months, as she
    suffered. Poor befuddled Dennis did not recognise him, and did not tell him that
    his mother had passed to the other side. Leaving the premises, Dennis did not
    fasten his cloak across his front, so his tattoo was visible to everyone who passed
    him in the village streets.

    By nightfall, the slaughtering had ceased in all the farmyards save one. There,
    at Scroonhoonpooge Farm, the killing continued, in the eerie barn. Dennis stumbled
    in to the scene of horror on his way home. Soft in the head, he had strayed from
    his path in the darkness. The brigands were a blood-crazed and ruthless lot, but
    they were also, to a man, in thrall to rustic folk tales of ghosties and sprites
    and imps.

    "Eek!" yelled the first who saw Dennis, "It is Ivan, come back from the grave
    to avenge us!"

    Between straying from his path and entering the barn, Dennis had toppled into
    a ditch, and he was splattered with muck, as a zombie might be, clambering to
    the surface from its tomb in the churchyard.  With his piggy eyes and snub nose
    and scrupulously-tended bouffant slathered in pomade, Dennis bore a startling
    resemblance to Ivan Clank, the housekeeper''s husband slain by the brigands fourteen
    years before. As they scattered, terrified, into the night, leaving Dennis alone
    in the eerie barn with the dead and dying victims of their latest enormity, we
    might ask if it was indeed Father Ivan Plunkett to whom Dennis''s mother had called
    in her last moments. Might it have been, rather, Ivan Clank, the bailiff, her
    illicit inamorato of days long vanished?'
