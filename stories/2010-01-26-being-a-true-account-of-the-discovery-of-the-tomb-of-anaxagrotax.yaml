  text: 'Be it known that on the fourteenth day of the month of March in the year
    of picklings last, MR THUBB, the Hon. Secretary of the Pointy Town chapter of
    the Tuesday Weld Fan Club, hired a charabanc for the purposes of an excursion
    to outlying parts of the said town, there to picnic and exchange pictorial collector''s
    cards of Tuesday Weld, her contemporaries and her peers.

    That the driver of the charabanc was a man of frightful countenance and evil reputation.
    That he was said to have phantom limbs, additional to his given limbs, and that
    though these could not be perceived by the human eye in ordinary daylight, they
    were nevertheless present, and said driver might be said to have the form of a
    gigantic spider were he ever seen whole.

    That the cost of the hire of the charabanc and driver was met by subscription
    to the excursions and picnicking fund of the Tuesday Weld Fan Club, administered
    by the Hon. Treasurer MR BRIMSTONE. That MR THUBB and MR BRIMSTONE were at loggerheads
    by cause of imponderables and fathomless mysteries known to none but they and
    their wives and the late beadle, MR FLAIL, perished of an ague in the month of
    February past. That the relict of MR FLAIL was confined to a madhouse wherein
    she did knit, in a phrenzy, in all her hours of wakefulness.

    That the charabanc driver, by name BINNS, having agreed a route to the picnicking
    spot with MR THUBB, did diverge his vehicle up into the hills, whence his intention
    was to deliver all the excursioning members of the Tuesday Weld Fan Club into
    the clutches of the Grunty Man, who dwelt in a lair in said hills. That BINNS
    was to gain no pecuniary advantage from this treachery, in that his sole purpose
    was mischief and malfeasance. That the babblings of the excursionists within the
    charabanc excited them to such degree that none took cognizance of the divergence.

    That much frost and ice lay on the roads in that month of March for it was a bitter
    season. That there was no grit to be had nor wherewithal of Pointy Town civic
    gritting persons to spread it upon the roads if there had been, for they were
    in dispute with regard to their stipend and held banners in a throng outside the
    civic hall and had tubs which they thumped with main force. That notwithstanding
    his great merit as a driver of the charabanc, BINNS caused the vehicle to skid
    ski-skaw-skoo off the appointed way and go plunging into a ditch some four miles
    as the crow flies past the Bypass at Blister Lane. That had BINNS taken the route
    agreed with MR THUBB such accident would never have occurred.

    That the gentlemen and ladies of the Tuesday Weld Fan Club conducted themselves
    with decency and aplomb. That those who had been hurled from the charabanc assisted
    those who remained within its twisted wreckage to make their escape. That they
    gathered in the ditch and sipped with due daintiness from flasks of soup piping
    hot. That the Hon. Correspondence Secretary, MRS GLEETY, distributed to all Dr
    Gillespie''s Famous And Trustworthy Brain Powders For The Alleviation Of Disorders
    Of The Nerves And Integuments. That tears of emotion were shed when it was seen
    that MR THUBB and MR BRIMSTONE were putting aside their differences in the face
    of calamity and were shaking hands with each other with manly forbearance.

    That a considerable time elapsed before it was noted that the charabanc driver
    BINNS was not present with the others in the ditch. That said BINNS had taken
    to his heels at the first opportunity. That his fleeing gained much expedition
    from the fact that his visible heels were accompanied by any number of phantom
    heels. That the direction of BINNS'' fleeing was into the hills, where he threw
    himself upon the mercy of the Grunty Man with terrible bewailings that he had
    failed in his appointed task. That the Grunty Man was a stranger to mercy and
    grunted loud and awful grunts and dragged BINNS into the depths of his lair. That
    not hide nor hair of BINNS was ever seen again on this spinning earth.

    That the composure of the members of the Tuesday Weld Fan Club was a magnificent
    thing and a pride unto Pointy Town. That when wounds were bandaged and shattered
    bones set with splints, they clambered forth each and every one from the ditch
    to make the journey home on foot. That night fell and they lost their way yet
    did not once screech in terror nor complain of chill. That they kept their spirits
    up by calling one to another the titles of feature films in which Tuesday Weld
    had appeared, to which another would respond by calling out the name of the character
    she had played in said feature film, so that MR BRIMSTONE might call Rally ''Round
    The Flag, Boys! and MRS GLEETY call Comfort Goodpasture, or MR THUBB call The
    Private Lives Of Adam And Eve and the Hon. Picnics Secretary MRS BLEARS call in
    return Vangie Harper.

    That such jollies were brought cruelly to a close when it happened in the darkness
    that MR THUBB collided with an enormous block of masonry and was knocked insensible.
    That MRS GLEETY had exhausted her supply of Dr Gillespie''s Powders but was able
    to revive MR THUBB with a draught of arquebusade-water from a canister within
    her handbag. That it was resolved to remain in the lee of the enormous block of
    masonry pending the break of dawn, for it provided some shelter from a wild wind
    which now was roaring. That to pass the time until dawn, the excursionists hummed
    tunes made famous by Dudley Moore and Pinchas Zukerman, respectively the second
    and third husbands of Tuesday Weld.

    That when dawn came and examination was made of the masonry it was found to be
    covered in greatly mysterious inscriptions in an alphabet unknown to even the
    most erudite member of the Tuesday Weld Fan Club. That this was by common acclaim
    MR SHAMBEKO who was the author of many learned books, among them being a history
    of Pointy Town, a topographical description of the area around the Blister Lane
    Bypass, and a shot-by-shot analysis of the feature film I''ll Take Sweden, in
    which Tuesday Weld appeared as the character JoJo Holcomb. That in scraping clumps
    of mud from the masonry the better to view the inscriptions, it became apparent
    that much of the block remained submerged below the ground. That MRS GLEETY produced
    from her handbag a number of gardening trowels which she carried on the aborted
    excursion in case within the vicinity of the picnic spot had grown such plants
    as campions and hellebore and lupins for the digging up and transplanting to her
    garden behind the house on Turpentine Boulevard in Pointy Town. That those of
    the party not yet faint with exhaustion set to with a will a-trowelling away the
    mud to reveal as much of the enormous block of masonry as their efforts might
    allow.

    That thus was discovery made of the ancient tomb of Anaxagrotax. That MR SHAMBEKO
    thereafter wrote an account of the discovery and embarked upon an extensive lecture
    tour of many countries. That MR SHAMBEKO never failed to acknowledge the inadvertent
    part played by the evil spidery charabanc driver BINNS. That it remains unknown
    who or what Anaxagrotax was or in what era he lived if ever he lived at all. That
    his tomb now gleaming is surrounded by a fence to deter souvenir hunters, and
    that propped against the tomb, in a plain wooden frame coated with protection
    against the elements is a publicity photograph of Tuesday Weld, taken circa 1963
    during production of the feature film Soldier In The Rain, in which she appeared
    as the character Bobby Jo Pepperdine. That it is apt that a soldier stands guard
    in a sentry box beside the tomb of Anaxagrotax, and that it is raining, and that
    there is no roof upon the box, so the rain falls directly upon the soldier, whose
    badge declares his name as Private Pepperdine.'
