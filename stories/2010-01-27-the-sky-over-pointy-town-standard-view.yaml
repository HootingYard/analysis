  \ view\u201D of the sky, if one is looking up into the firmament when standing slap\
  \ bang next to the horse trough in Chris De Burhg [sic] Square. Apparently, there\
  \ are occasional days when the sky looks a tiny bit less threatening, but they are\
  \ few and far between in the span of years allotted to most of us, including tortoises.\n\
