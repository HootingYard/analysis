    As part of our exciting series Meteorologically Significant Pictures From Pointy
    Town And Thereabouts, here is what boffins describe as the "standard view" of
    the sky, if one is looking up into the firmament when standing slap bang next
    to the horse trough in Chris De Burhg [sic] Square. Apparently, there are occasional
    days when the sky looks a tiny bit less threatening, but they are few and far
    between in the span of years allotted to most of us, including tortoises.
