  text: 'I was out strolling by the canal the other morning when I was accosted by
    an ACRONYM--an Asbo-Carrying Ruffian Of Narrow Yob Mentality. He growled something
    unintelligible at me in his barbaric innit-spreche, which I countered by telling
    him, as bravely as I could, that I offered him the chance to turn himself from
    an ACRONYM into an ACROSTIC--an Asbo-Carrying Ruffian Of Spiritual Transfiguration
    In Christ.

    Without waiting for his reply, I whipped out of my pocket my much-thumbed paperback
    copy of the Selected Poems of duck-mesmerising Victorian Jesuit Gerard Manley
    Hopkins, and immediately began to declaim, in a booming voice, "God''s Grandeur".

    "The world is charged with the grandeur of God. / It will flame out, like shining
    from shook foil; / It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil / Crushed."

    The ACRONYM was too sunk in his vacuity to react in any perceptible way, but the
    words of Hopkins are shocking and mighty and irresistible, and I knew I had the
    upper hand.

    Nearby, on a leaf, a mealybug unfurled its wings and soared high into the heavens.

    My work was almost done. I took the ACRONYM by the hand and led him towards the
    church, where Father Boggis waited with an old rugged cross and a handful of nails.
    I patted my pocket, feeling for the hammer I carried there. I looked forward to
    landing the first blow, nailing to the rough wood the filthy ruffian hand I held
    in mine.

    NOTE : For readers outside the UK, it may be helpful to explain that an Asbo,
    or ASBO, is itself an acronym, for Anti-Social Behaviour Order, a terrifying deterrent
    to scalliwags, innit.'
