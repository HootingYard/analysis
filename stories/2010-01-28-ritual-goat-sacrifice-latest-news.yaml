  text: "Last week I remarked on the brouhaha that would be stirred were a British\
    \ (as opposed to a Japanese) Prime Minister to be attacked by a killer robot.\
    \ I am now trying to cope with the idea of our political masters indulging in\
    \ ritual goat sacrifice\u2014perhaps not every day, but quite often. According\
    \ to today's Guardian:\nPakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, has found solace\
    \ in an unusual form\u2014the ritual slaughter of goats.\nZardari has a black\
    \ goat killed every day at his Islamabad house to ward off \u201Cevil eyes\u201D\
    \ and protect himself against \u201Cblack magic\u201D, according to a report in\
    \ Dawn, Pakistan\u2018s paper of record.\nSpokesman Farhatullah Babar confirmed\
    \ the president practises sadiqa, or the sacrifice of an animal whose meat is\
    \ distributed among the poor. \u201CI have seen it been done. Not exactly every\
    \ day, but quite often, yes,\u201D he told the Guardian.\nBut he denied its purpose\
    \ was to fend off malevolent spirits. \u201CThe main belief is that this practice\
    \ invokes the pleasure of God. The corollary is that bad things will not happen,\
    \ of course, but that's a matter of interpretation,\u201D he said.\nI don't see\
    \ the slaughtering of goats as Gordon Brown's thing, but it would make sense with\
    \ someone like Geoff Hoon.\_ He looks like a goat-killer, as does his partner\
    \ in that recent failed coup, Patricia Hewitt. I expect the failure was due to\
    \ their being so busy tippy-tapping conspiratorial drivel into their Blackberries\
    \ that they forgot to sacrifice a goat at the propitious time. As for Miliband\
    \ 1 and Miliband 2, they strike me more as the type to interpret the bloody entrails\
    \ of ritually slaughtered poultry."
