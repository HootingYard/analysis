  text: 'Last week I remarked on the brouhaha that would be stirred were a British
    (as opposed to a Japanese) Prime Minister to be attacked by a killer robot. I
    am now trying to cope with the idea of our political masters indulging in ritual
    goat sacrifice--perhaps not every day, but quite often. According to today''s
    Guardian:

    Pakistan''s president, Asif Ali Zardari, has found solace in an unusual form--the
    ritual slaughter of goats.

    Zardari has a black goat killed every day at his Islamabad house to ward off "evil
    eyes" and protect himself against "black magic", according to a report in Dawn,
    Pakistan''s paper of record.

    Spokesman Farhatullah Babar confirmed the president practises sadiqa, or the sacrifice
    of an animal whose meat is distributed among the poor. "I have seen it been done.
    Not exactly every day, but quite often, yes," he told the Guardian.

    But he denied its purpose was to fend off malevolent spirits. "The main belief
    is that this practice invokes the pleasure of God. The corollary is that bad things
    will not happen, of course, but that''s a matter of interpretation," he said.

    I don''t see the slaughtering of goats as Gordon Brown''s thing, but it would
    make sense with someone like Geoff Hoon.  He looks like a goat-killer, as does
    his partner in that recent failed coup, Patricia Hewitt. I expect the failure
    was due to their being so busy tippy-tapping conspiratorial drivel into their
    Blackberries that they forgot to sacrifice a goat at the propitious time. As for
    Miliband 1 and Miliband 2, they strike me more as the type to interpret the bloody
    entrails of ritually slaughtered poultry.'
