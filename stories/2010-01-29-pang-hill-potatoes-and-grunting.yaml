  text: 'Well, stap my chives, what a day! Those of you who have studied the comments
    posted under the Book O'' Days postage will know that today is both Potato Day
    and Grunting Day. That being so, I set my alarm and was up and about before dawn
    to ensure I was in time to follow the annual parade from Pang Hill Orphanage.
    There they all were, the tinies, still half-asleep, each clutching a potato in
    their freezing little hands. Many of the potatoes were severely blighted with
    the spraingue, but that is only to be expected. Grimes, the Pang Hill allotment-keeper,
    has not really been doing his job properly since he was struck by lightning in
    that terrible storm on Saint Bibblybibdib''s Day two years ago, but whenever it
    is suggested that he retire and give up his post to a more sprightly replacement
    he casts eerie spells. Birds fall from the sky, hollyhocks shrivel and die, and
    Pang Hill is overrun with rabid squirrels. It really is best just to leave Grimes
    be.

    Spraingue blight or no, the orphans were all present and correct huddling in the
    porch of the orphanage at the crack of dawn, ready for the parade. As the first
    rays of that mighty orb, the sun, appeared on the horizon, the Pang Hill Orphanage
    Choir Conductor bashed his stick on the metal plate wedged in Grimes'' cranium,
    and the tinies, all forty of them, struck up their superb rendition of Spem in
    alium by Thomas Tallis, arranged for high-pitched infant grunting. And as they
    grunted, they began to march, through sludge and puddles, from the grim orphanage,
    across withered lawns, all the way up into the hills, where they placed their
    potatoes in a pile outside the lair of the Grunty Man. Then they marched empty-handed
    all the way back to their base and brickish home, grunting Muila ni meps, the
    Choir Conductor''s own composition for groans and grunting, which is basically
    just Spem in alium sung, or rather grunted, backwards, the sort of thing Brian
    "One Brain" Eno might record, and probably has done. Once safe back inside the
    orphanage, all the tinies were given a radish and some goaty fluid for breakfast.

    I stayed up in the hills, though, hoping to spot the Grunty Man creep out of his
    lair and gather up the forty potatoes left to him as an offering. It is thought
    that such a gift will assuage his grunty wrath for the year ahead, or at least
    until next week. But of course there was no sign of him, because he stayed inside
    his foul and stinking den, glued to his laptop, watching Tony Blair give evidence
    to the Chilcott Inquiry, and grunting throughout. But were they grunts of approbation
    or disdain? Only the Grunty Man knows, and it would be a brave and foolhardy person
    who attempted a mind-meld with that extraordinary, and extraordinarily pea-sized,
    grunty brain.
