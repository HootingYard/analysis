  text: '"The quality is moderately hot, proper for winter or summer. The drink is
    declared to be most wholesome, preserving in perfect health until extreme old
    age. The particular virtues are these: It maketh the body active and lusty. It
    helpeth the headache, giddiness and heaviness thereof. It removeth the obstructions
    of the spleen, it is very good against the stone and gravel. It taketh away the
    difficulty of breathing, opening obstructions. It is good against lippitude distillations,
    and cleareth the sight. It removeth lassitude, and cleanseth and purifieth acrid
    humours and a hot liver. It is good against crudities, strengthening the weakness
    of the stomach, causing good appetite and digestion, and particularly for men
    of corpulent body, and such as are great eaters of flesh. It vanquisheth heavy
    dreams, easeth the brain, and strengtheneth the memory. It overcometh superfluous
    sleep, and prevents sleepiness in general, a draught of the infusion being taken;
    so that without trouble whole nights may be spent in study without hurt to the
    body. It prevents and cures agues, surfeits, and fevers by infusing a fit quantity
    of the leaf, thereby provoking a most gentle vomit and breathing of the pores,
    and hath been given with wonderful success. It (being prepared and drunk with
    milk and water) strengtheneth the inward parts and prevents consumptions. It is
    good for colds, dropsies, and scurvies, and expelleth infection. And that the
    virtues and excellencies of this leaf and drink are many and great is evident
    and manifest by the high esteem and use of it (especially of late years) by the
    physicians and knowing men of France, Italy, Holland, and other parts of Christendom,
    and in England it hath been sold in the leaf for six pounds, and sometimes for
    ten pounds, the pound weight; and in respect of its former scarceness and dearness,
    it hath been only used as a regalia in high treatments and entertainments, and
    presents made thereof to princes and grandees till the year 1657."

    From a 17th century pamphlet on the subject of tea, quoted in Byegone England
    : Social Studies In Its Historic Byways And Highways by William Andrews, (1892).
    He also quotes from an Edmund Waller poem, thus: "The Muses''s friend, tea does
    our fancy aid / Repress those vapours which the head invade".'
