  text: "I disembarked from the Ship of Fools, and stepped aboard the Weltschmerz\
    \ Tug that would carry me to shore. The woes of the world weighed down the tugboat's\
    \ captain, who would not, or could not, hide his disgust. I was his only passenger,\
    \ and as he steered towards the Island of Pomposity, he spewed forth a litany\
    \ of misery, piling one curdled complaint upon another until I had to stop my\
    \ ears with corks. The sea sloshed, and smelled of rotting aquatic death. I could\
    \ see the land. It was close enough that I could make out various pompous ladies\
    \ and gentleman promenading upon the harbour wall, in fustian and crinoline and\
    \ tweed. But hours passed and the Weltschmerz Tug never seemed to get any nearer\
    \ the shore, though the engine was chugging away, belching foul black blooms of\
    \ smoke, poisoning the seabirds. Was I to be stuck forever between foolishness\
    \ and pomposity, trapped aboard a tugboat with a world-weary captain moaning and\
    \ spitting and cursing, corks in my ears and bile rising in my throat? Yes, I\
    \ was, and this, I would learn, was very Heaven.\nNOTE\_: Tugboat Tales, Number\
    \ One is here."
