  text: 'It is, by all accounts, lovely and elegant and varnished, the coffin in which
    I shall rot, in time to come. I chose it, in a whimsical mood, from a photographic
    brochure, at the coffin-maker''s workshop which I had entered distractedly, mistaking
    it for the pie ''n'' pastry shop. I cannot claim this was a simple error to which
    any humdrum jackanape might be prone, for not only are the exteriors of the coffin-maker''s
    and the pie ''n'' pastry shop radically distinct from one another, but they lie
    in completely different parts of town, the one at the eastern edge and the other
    slotted in a parade in the precinct to the south-west. It could with justice be
    said I was "not all there" that morning. I could blame my paramour or the postie
    or the weather, but to do so, in any of those cases, would be churlish and incontinent.
    Well, perhaps the weather. Hailstones pinging down in June? Who''d have thought
    it? My equanimity was disturbed, as, it seems, were the readings on my compass,
    for there I was, to the east rather than the south-west, and all beflummoxed,
    so.

    There were several coffin-makers busy in the workshop, most of them engaged in
    sawing and hammering and sanding and planing and hewing and chiselling. One was
    sat at a desk, writing a tract denouncing cremations and ashes and urns. I have
    since read it, thoroughly, and it makes a convincing argument without betraying
    the base personal motives of its author. It was this chap who, looking up from
    his scribbling, introduced himself to me and asked me what it was I wanted. He
    gave his name as Ned the Coffin-Maker. In spite of my befuddlement, I had already
    realised I was not in the pie ''n'' pastry shop, so I managed not to make a fool
    of myself. But I was rather tongue-tied, and all I managed to say in reply was
    "Hello there, Ned".

    There followed a confusing five minutes where Ned the Coffin-Maker mistook me
    for a long lost pal of his, who had run away to sea, or possibly to join a circus,
    many years before. Apparently, I looked startlingly similar to this fled companion,
    at least to how Ned imagined he might look after the passage of so many years,
    grayer and stooped and bewrinkled and riddled with liver spots. He assumed the
    bunch of chrysanthemums I was carrying was a gift for him, snatched it from me,
    and plunged it into a jug full of water. When we eventually escaped from our muddle,
    with the realisation that I was not after all his pal, I felt too embarrassed
    to ask for my flowers back and, indeed, Ned the Coffin-Maker made no offer to
    return them to me.

    I was poised to leave the workshop there and then. That is to say, I had manoeuvred
    my body so that my toes and nose were pointed in the direction of the doorway,
    my left arm was outflung to sweep me fully around without my overbalancing, which
    is always a risk with me, quite honestly, and I was in the process of shifting
    my glance away from Ned the Coffin-Maker''s characterful and strangely enormous
    head. But then he piped up, waving his pictorial brochure at me as he did so.

    "Your death is horribly inevitable. It is best to be prepared."

    I re-poised myself, facing him squarely on.

    "You would be wise," he continued, "To leaf through this pictorial brochure of
    coffins, and pick out the one you will want when the dread day occurs, as fate
    decrees it must."

    I heard a bell clang, then, but whether it was a real bell or a fancied clanging
    inside my head I did not know. But I felt impelled to sit down at Ned the Coffin-Maker''s
    desk, and while he set about chivvying along his colleagues, or underlings, I
    pored over hundreds of pages of colour photographs of coffins. Some were shabby,
    some garish. Most were wooden, but a few seemed made of tin or zinc or wolfram.
    Their shapes and sizes did not vary by much, and each coffin had been photographed
    in front of an identical map of Switzerland, tacked upon a baize-covered board,
    to give a consistent sense of scale. There were many, many pins stuck in the map,
    one for each graveyard in the whole of Switzerland. The coffins were named, rather
    than numbered, according to captions hand-written beneath them. I rejected out
    of hand The Dismal, The Alarming, and The Frankly Unspeakable, For Paupers. I
    dallied over The Penge Flask, The Egon Schiele, and The Stubby. But as soon as
    my eyes lit upon The Lovely And Elegant And Varnished, I knew it was the coffin
    for me. I slammed shut the brochure and called to Ned, who came lurching over
    to me, having donned a black cape like a shroud.

    "An excellent choice, if I may say so," he said when I told him my choice. His
    voice was newly sepulchral, as if he spoke from a deep dank grim and fetid grave.
    He explained that he would make all necessary arrangements when the time came,
    and for me not to worry my ditzy little head about anything, forevermore. I could
    have taken umbrage at "ditzy", and smashed my fist into his gob, but I reflected
    that, after all, the only reason I was in the workshop at all was my earlier befuddlement.

    I said my farewells, and thought I heard mischievous chuckling from the other
    coffin-makers as I stepped out the door. I threw my compass into a hedgerow and,
    instead of heading home, I decided to run away to sea, or to join a circus. I
    would see which I came to first, the booming ocean, or the Big Top.'
