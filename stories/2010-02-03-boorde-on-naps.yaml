text: "As a great enthusiast for the postprandial nap, which I like to think of as\
  \ a mark of civilised behaviour, I was somewhat alarmed to read the advice of Dr\
  \ Andrew Boorde, writing in his Dyetary of Helth in 1542: \u201CWhole men of what\
  \ age or complexion soever they be of, should take their natural rest and sleep\
  \ in the night, and to eschew all meridial sleep. But, an need shall compel man\
  \ to sleep upon his meat, let him make a pause, and then let him stand, and lean\
  \ and sleep against a cupboard.\u201D"
