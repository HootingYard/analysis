  text: 'As a great enthusiast for the postprandial nap, which I like to think of
    as a mark of civilised behaviour, I was somewhat alarmed to read the advice of
    Dr Andrew Boorde, writing in his Dyetary of Helth in 1542: "Whole men of what
    age or complexion soever they be of, should take their natural rest and sleep
    in the night, and to eschew all meridial sleep. But, an need shall compel man
    to sleep upon his meat, let him make a pause, and then let him stand, and lean
    and sleep against a cupboard."'
