  text: 'As we know, tiny John Ruskin was allowed to jump off his favourite box on
    Sunday afternoons. Things were not nearly so idyllic for Augustus Hare:

    "I remember that one day when we went to visit the curate, a lady very innocently
    gave me a lollypop, which I ate. This crime was discovered when I came home by
    the smell of peppermint, and a large dose of rhubarb and soda was at once administered
    with a forcing-spoon, though I was in robust health at that time, to teach me
    to avoid such carnal indulgences as lollypops for the future. For two years, also,
    I was obliged to swallow a dose of rhubarb every morning and every evening because--according
    to old-fashioned ideas--it was supposed to ''strengthen the stomach''! I am sure
    it did me a great deal of harm, and had much to do with accounting for my after
    sickliness."

    The Story Of My Life by Augustus J C Hare (1952)'
