  text: "As we know, tiny John Ruskin was allowed to jump off his favourite box on\
    \ Sunday afternoons. Things were not nearly so idyllic for Augustus Hare:\n\u201C\
    I remember that one day when we went to visit the curate, a lady very innocently\
    \ gave me a lollypop, which I ate. This crime was discovered when I came home\
    \ by the smell of peppermint, and a large dose of rhubarb and soda was at once\
    \ administered with a forcing-spoon, though I was in robust health at that time,\
    \ to teach me to avoid such carnal indulgences as lollypops for the future. For\
    \ two years, also, I was obliged to swallow a dose of rhubarb every morning and\
    \ every evening because\u2014according to old-fashioned ideas\u2014it was supposed\
    \ to \u2018strengthen the stomach\u2019! I am sure it did me a great deal of harm,\
    \ and had much to do with accounting for my after sickliness.\u201D\nFrom The\
    \ Years With Mother\_: Being an abridgement of the first three volumes of The\
    \ Story Of My Life by Augustus J C Hare (1952)"
