  text: 'The people of Pointy Town were once asked, in a referendum, if they wanted
    William S Burroughs as their writer-in-residence. Sensibly, they rejected him,
    arguing en masse that he was a gun-toting drug-addled nincompoop who took himself
    far too seriously and was, in turn, taken far too seriously by the kind of people
    who don''t actually read many books. That cut-up business may have won him some
    fashionable fans, but it''s just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis, innit? No,
    the Pointy Towners prefer their prose sequential and sparky, which is why they
    picked Pebblehead. But the bestselling paperbackist turned them down, for he was
    loth to live in Pointy Town, and residence therein was obviously a sine qua non
    for the position. There was a half-hearted plot to abduct Pebblehead from his
    "chalet o'' prose" high in the Swiss Alps and forcibly remove him to Pointy Town,
    but it fell apart by dint of timidity and awe.

    The people then called for the appointment of Christopher Smart, author of Jubilate
    Agno. That great poem had recently become popular in Pointy Town as a method of
    organising civic behaviour. A line or two would be chosen at random each day,
    much in the manner of bibliomancy, but rather than foretelling the future the
    chosen text was, as far as possible, "acted out" by all literate Pointy Towners,
    and used as a sort of guide to their public conduct in the streets and boulevards.
    It had to be gently pointed out to them that Smart was long dead, and that while,
    at a pinch, it may have been possible to exhume whatever remained of him and have
    it reinterred in L''Etoile Du Pointy Town Cemetery, there could be no expectation
    of any new writing being done.

    Pointy Town being a town without art, the panel next made the curious suggestion
    that the writer-in-residence post be offered to art critic Cosmo Hoxtonwanker.
    The thinking was that he might be able to identify this or that which could be
    considered as art, or could become art if viewed through artistic lenses. This
    idea was dismissed as foolhardy even faster than the rejection of Burroughs.

    The next name out of the hat, as it were, though there was not actually a physical
    hat as such, was that of Jeanette Winterson. Although it was thought by many that
    she was far too important a writer to be persuaded to bother herself with a dismal
    provincial backwater like Pointy Town, initial inquiries proved positive. The
    people were divided, but a slim majority found in her favour, and the panel had
    gone so far as to evict all the guests from the Grand Hotel on the seafront so
    the even grander novelist could be installed there and have the building and its
    lovely gardens all to herself. Alas, negotiations fell through when the great
    author said she would refuse to write with the Pointy Pencil Of Pointy Town, considering
    it to be a phallocentric symbol.

    At this point, quite unexpectedly, William S Burroughs, having heard the rumours,
    turned up in the town. He lurked on pathways like a ghoul of dreadful countenance,
    injecting himself with heroin and clearly lapping up being the cynosure of a certain
    cast of impressionable teenperson devoted to the "edgy". His presence grew so
    tiresome that eventually he was pelted with pebbles and laughed at until he left
    town.

    Still, though, Pointy Town was without a writer-in-residence. Even twee versifier
    Dennis Beerpint could not be persuaded to take on the job. And so the plan was
    quietly dropped... on the very day that, hoving into view on the horizon, huge
    and terrible and drooling, the Grunty Man approached! Could he wield the Pointy
    Pencil in his great clumsy fist? Inside that lumpen head, were there actually
    any thoughts that could be put down on paper, or even any thoughts at all? Was
    there in all Pointy Town a barn big enough to contain him in comfort?

    Read on next week in Episode Two, in which the Grunty Man wrests editorship of
    the Pointy Town Clarion & Big Thumping Iron Hammer from milquetoast fop Gervase
    Weed!'
