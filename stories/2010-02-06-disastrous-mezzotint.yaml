  text: 'Upon waking this morning, my first thoughts, as ever on this date, were of
    the Munich Air Disaster. Having sloshed ice-cold water on my head to dispel the
    pangs of loss, I then happened to read an interesting piece about mezzotints,
    which I recommend. Weirdly, it fails to mention the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint,
    but you can rely on me to make good that omission. For what I recalled, over my
    cornflakes ''n'' egg a la Blavatsky, was that in the early months of 1958 Rex
    Tint was busy with what came to be known as "the cack-handed mezzotints". This
    was a set of pieces which lack the sureness of touch and the dapper brilliance
    of his best work, but are nevertheless of interest, no piece more so than this
    rather clumsy mezzotint of the Busby Babes. So on this day, let us remember them,
    and remember too Rex Tint, who lost his mojo, whatever that might be, over half
    a century ago.
