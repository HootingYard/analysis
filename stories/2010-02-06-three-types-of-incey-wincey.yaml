  text: 'Incey-wincey badger, scrubbling in the dirt. Puts some sticks together and
    builds himself a yurt. He''s a New Age badger, his name is Little Kurt. Careful
    now, his feelings are very easily hurt.

    Incey-wincey goat-boy, creature of two realms. We can see you darting in between
    the elms. Half of you is human, the other half''s a goat. Incey-wincey goat-boy,
    drowning in a moat.

    Incey-wincey lobster, clacking in the sea. His brain''s completely alien to that
    of you and me. Incey-wincey lobster, much bigger than a bee. The lobster''s very
    strange, and is never ever twee.'
