  text: '"It is the sublime inconsequence of a farm that I like, the confusion of
    noises, the sense of unreality that is given as a great and heavenly gift to human
    beings who live among thudding, moaning cattle, and tumbling milk-cans, and hens
    screeching underfoot and who, no matter how they try, can never coerce their lives
    into routine, but must always wait on the weather and market prices and the temperamental
    vagaries of their stock, and at one time spend idle weeks in the rain, and at
    another toil both day and night, and at yet another time waste precious hours
    chasing a cow which has got into the wrong field and which, in running away, impales
    itself eventually on the railings, or in segregating cock chickens of three weeks
    old who suddenly discover their sex and in one afternoon reduce each other to
    bleeding wisps of tow. That is what I like about a farm."
