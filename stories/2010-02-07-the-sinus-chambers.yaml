  text: 'So here they are then, the sinus chambers. Not, as you might think, inside
    somebody''s head, but out in the open, in a field, enormous, built of some tough
    metal, with rivets. They can be seen for miles around, for this is a flat country,
    parts of it below sea level, though we are far from the coast. Though so easily
    visible, lots and lots of people have come to the field to get a closer look.
    There are picnics taking place, some in the shadow cast by the mighty sinus chambers
    beneath the sun glittering in a cloudless blue. Awestruck tinies gasp, as do their
    parents, who forget the picnic sausages and lemonade as they gaze up at the giant
    construction.

    It being a field, we have field officers stationed here and there to keep order.
    We have people on the ground, too, lying flat, at regular intervals, all the way
    from the coach park to the ground just yards from where the sinus chambers tower
    over us. Both the field officers and the people on the ground have been issued
    with badges as identification. The badges are enamel, and have upon them a device
    showing the sinus chambers in miniature and an arrow pointing up towards their
    own, inside-the-head, sinus chambers. Everybody has had to be very careful when
    pinning on their badges to ensure they are correctly aligned. Imagine the rumpus
    if an arrow pointed in the wrong direction.

    During the afternoon the huge metal sinus chambers slowly fill up with liquid.
    It has been specially prepared by boffins using a formula they have kept secret
    from rival boffins, some foreign, some bad. When the fluid reaches a level marked
    upon the side of each sinus chamber in fluorescent zalemba, a hooter will be sounded,
    and the draining will begin. The piping and the siphons and the funnels and the
    nozzles have been checked and re-checked by a specialist team flown in from a
    far off country of which we know little.

    Picnic hampers are packed away, and the shrieks of delight and frolic die in the
    throats of the tinies and their parents. In the coach park, the drivers huddled
    by the kiosk stub out their cigarettes, and gaze towards the field. Those who
    hold to their Catholicism make hurried signs of the cross. Even the birds perched
    in the trees are silenced.

    There is a deafening metallic judder and clank. And then the gurgling begins...'
