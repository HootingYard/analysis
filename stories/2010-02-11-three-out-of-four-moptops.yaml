  text: 'I have just started to read The Killing Of Julia Wallace, Jonathan Goodman''s
    account of one of the twentieth century''s most intriguing murder mysteries. The
    events took place in 1931, in Liverpool. Thirty-odd pages in, I have been struck
    by the following:

    One of the key locations is Menlove Avenue, the road where John Lennon grew up.
    The evening before the murder of his wife, William Herbert Wallace played chess
    with a man named McCartney, and on the day of the killing itself, he paid a visit
    to a Mrs Harrison. Alas, the index shows no sign of anyone called Starkey, or
    Starr. Still, three out of four loveable moptops is a pretty good tally so far
    as meaningless yet interesting coincidences go.'
