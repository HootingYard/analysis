  text: '"Few men, no matter what their calling, can have been the object of so many
    different descriptions as were applied to him... [Edward George Hemmerde, K.C.,
    the Recorder for Liverpool] was variously depicted as ''a profligate'', ''a wastrel'',
    ''a martyr to the establishment'', ''a stormy petrel'', ''a soured man'', ''a
    good-time Charlie'', and ''a man who was much maligned and misunderstood''; he
    was also... ''an irrepressible, loud-mouthed, honourable and outspoken braggart''...
    His physical perfection was marred by only one thing--or rather, two things: his
    feet. They were enormous. In profile, straight-backed and vastly-booted, Hemmerde
    was shaped like the letter L... He was conscious, too, of the unloveliness of
    his speaking voice, which, when he was at all excited, rose to a high-pitched
    screech. Since it took very little to get him excited, his voice, almost as often
    as not, was up in the higher registers, causing distress to sensitive ear-drums..."
