  text: '"The first volume in the series, The Boy Scouts of the Eagle Patrol, was
    necessarily confined to the activities of the young organization; but Rob and
    his mates met and overcame many difficulties that are well worth reading about.

    "In the second volume, The Boy Scouts on the Range, were recounted a series of
    strange adventures that befell some of the Eagles during a visit to the Far Southwest,
    where they took part in the wild life of a cattle ranch.

    "Through the pages of The Boy Scouts and the Army Airship the reader will find
    that Rob and his comrades always bore themselves manfully, no matter the emergency;
    and that they scrupulously observed ''scout law'' under any and every occasion,
    as every true wearer of the khaki makes it a point to do.

    "After this, followed an account of many remarkable happenings that befell the
    Eagles when under canvas. The Boy Scouts'' Mountain Camp has deservedly been reckoned
    one of the very best scout books ever published for boys, and those who own a
    copy are likely to read it many times.

    "Once more, chance allowed some of the leading characters in the Hampton Troop
    to come in touch with Government officers who were experimenting with a wonderfully
    designed submarine. It happened that Rob and his friends were enabled to assist
    Uncle Sam''s agents in defeating the plans of foreign spies who tried to steal
    the design of the new invention. In the pages of The Boy Scouts for Uncle Sam
    are recorded the adventures that accompanied their service, as well as mention
    of the reward following their victory.

    "It was a happy chance that allowed some of the boys to pay a visit to the then
    uncompleted Panama Canal. While in the Canal Zone they again demonstrated that
    they were always wide-awake and devoted to the service of their country. Much
    useful information will also be found between the covers of this volume, called
    The Boy Scouts at the Panama Canal.

    "Once more, Rob and several of his close adherents were unexpectedly allowed to
    take a trip. Andy Bowles, the bugler of the troop, had an uncle who owned a cattle
    ranch down in Chihuahua, in Mexico. He was sick, and unable to go down himself
    to dispose of the stock before the fighting forces of rebels and Federals drove
    the herds away. Accordingly, he sent his nephew and several of his chums to seek
    General Villa, whom he had once befriended, and gain his assistance in selling
    the valuable stock. The wonderful things they saw, and the peculiar adventures
    that came their way, have all been described in the seventh volume, just preceding
    this, under the title of The Boy Scouts Under Fire in Mexico.

    "That, telling briefly some of the remarkable things that happened in their career
    as Boy Scouts, will have to suffice to introduce Rob and his two chums to the
    reader."
