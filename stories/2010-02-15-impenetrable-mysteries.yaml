  text: 'There are certain impenetrable mysteries which tug at our imaginations and
    allow us no peace of mind. I am sure I am not the only person to be kept awake
    at night, tossing and turning, chewing the pillow, my brain fuming as I ponder
    in perplexity for the umpteenth time whether, for example, Badge Man was a living,
    breathing, armed maniac or merely a trick of the light, whether the Loch Ness
    Monster truly exists or is just a figment in the minds of socially inept men in
    anoraks who like to spend their time sitting in the lochside drizzle with Thermos
    flask and binoculars, whether it is permissible simply to wipe over one''s socks
    when performing wudhu. These are all terrifically mysterious matters, and there
    are many more, so many more it is a wonder we are not stunned into mental collapse.

    Every now and then, we stumble upon some fragmentary clue which promises to shed
    light where previously there has been only darkness, ignorance, and numbing stupidity.
    One of the greatest puzzles gnawing away inside my head has long been to find
    an answer to the question: what did Tiny Enid do, once she had grown up and was
    no longer tiny? Though I am still unable to give a full account of her adult doings,
    I can, today, say one thing with a modicum of confidence--she dressed up as a
    bat.


    There remains some doubt whether this really is Tiny Enid. It may be an impostor,
    or even a hallucination brought on by a surfeit of lampreys. I am clutching at
    straws, dammit, but sometimes that is all we can do.'
