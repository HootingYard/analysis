  text: "It is a truth universally acknowledged that, in this country at least, the\
    \ cultural tastes of top sportspersons are irredeemably bland and lowbrow. Our\
    \ native footballers, for example, when asked to name their favourite books, will\
    \ invariably mention Harry Potter or Andy McNab, if, that is, they have ever read\
    \ any books at all. (This is not the case with foreign footballers, particularly\
    \ the French, who are intellectual titans by comparison.) Similarly, the default\
    \ music choice for sporting champs seems to be smooth jazz, or jazz funk, or,\
    \ in the world o\u2019 rock, U2, Coldplay, and Phil Collins.\nThe great exception\
    \ to this has always been snookerist Steve Davis. The carefully-crafted public\
    \ image of a man who, away from a snooker table, is a boring mediocrity disguises\
    \ the truth that Mr Davis is a fanatical and knowledgeable enthusiast of prog\
    \ and related musics. Indeed, I seem to recall that some years ago he used his\
    \ wealth to persuade Teutonic nutcases Magma to reform for a series of concerts,\
    \ and has expressed a desire to do the same with Henry Cow, so far in vain.\n\n\
    So I am extremely grateful to reader Alasdair Dickson for drawing my attention\
    \ to PhoenixFM, Brentwood and Billericay's community radio station, where Mr Davis\
    \ has a regular show called The Interesting Alternative. Look at those playlists!\
    \ As Mr Dickson says, there is a fair amount of witless prog noodling, but also\
    \ early Soft Machine, the 5UU's, Camberwell Now, Univers Zero, and many other\
    \ Recommended or Recommendedish records.\nI know that Hooting Yard readers never\
    \ listen to any other radio station than ResonanceFM, but until the powers-that-be\
    \ at Borough High Street snap up Steve Davis, you will all be forgiven for tuning\
    \ in online to PhoenixFM for his show, wherever you are in the world."
