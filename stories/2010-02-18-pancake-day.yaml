  text: '[This piece ought to have appeared on Tuesday. Mea culpa.]

    Dobson adored Pancake Day. Every year, in the weeks leading up to Shrove Tuesday,
    he grew ever more hot-brained and excitable, gathering sacks of flour, carrying
    out repeated Orwellian egg counts, and begging Old Farmer Frack for churns of
    milk from the mad old rustic''s cow collection. Every year, too, he revised, polished,
    embroidered, and sometimes even rewrote from scratch his pamphlet Pancakes : Food
    Of The Gods? (out of print).

    In the complete Dobson bibliography, this title appears both with and without
    that question mark, like Sidney and Beatrice Webb''s fatuous Soviet Communism
    : A New Civilization?, written in 1935 at the height of Stalin''s terror, which
    lost its question mark between its first and second editions. Why Dobson ever
    phrased his title as a query in the first place is unfathomable, for he was absolutely
    convinced that all divine beings subsisted on pancakes and nothing else. A glance
    at any sacred text or compendium of myths quickly disproves the pamphleteer''s
    theory, if we can call it that, though "delusional idee fixe" would express it
    better. Dobson spent a preposterous amount of time working his way through the
    foundational texts of all major religions, Tippexing out all mentions of foodstuffs
    and, as soon as the Tippex was dry, scribbling in the word "pancakes". At one
    point he commissioned Rex Tint, the noted mezzotintist, to create a mezzotint
    showing the Greek gods atop Mount Olympus, stuffing their faces with pancakes.
    The work was never completed, or even begun, because Dobson wanted to pay the
    mezzotintist in eggs, flour, and milk, and Rex Tint, famously, was a "cash only"
    mezzotintist.

    It comes as something of a surprise to learn that in spite of his enthusiasm,
    Dobson was a hopeless pancake maker. He could never get the mixture quite right,
    and his tossing technique was laughable. He tried to divert attention from his
    pancake ineptitude through a combination of bluster, weeping, and pointing out
    of the window at an imaginary flock of chaffinches. Only late in his life did
    he face up to the truth, in the remarkable pamphlet My Pancake Ineptitude : A
    Heart-Rending Confession In Sixteen Bursts Of Hallucinatory Prose (out of print).
    In the sixteenth and final text, Dobson makes his most compelling case for the
    divine nature of this simple aliment, although the prose is so hallucinatory that
    not even the most diligent, pancake-focused reader can work out what in heaven''s
    name he is babbling on about.

    ADDENDUM : A better, and more accurate title than Soviet Communism : A New Civilization
    would have been Soviet Communism : Enemy Of Orchards, as Michael Gilleland at
    Laudator Temporis Acti reminds us.'
