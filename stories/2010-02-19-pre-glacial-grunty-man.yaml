    "''The Beast of the North is angry!'' he told himself.

    "Through the dark and storm, animals drifted past before the blasts of cold. They
    were fleeing; they were full of fear--fear of something that the dull mind of

    From Two Thousand Miles Below : A Four-Part Novel by Charles Willard Diffin, published
    in Astounding Stories between June 1932 and January 1933. New research suggests
    Diffin may have been writing about a fictionalised version of the Grunty Man who
    is, as we know, older than the Earth itself.'
