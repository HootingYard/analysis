  text: 'The other day the BBC Parliament channel showed a repeat of the general election
    coverage from February 1974. This is precisely the kind of thing I can watch,
    avidly, for hours. I rarely essay political topics here at Hooting Yard, but when
    not engaged in high level research into matters Dobsonian or limning the contours
    of Bodger''s Spinney or whatever else I prattle on about, I can be a terrible
    political pointyhead. There is a special fascination with old archive footage--the
    haircuts, the fruity pronunciation, the clunking technology, the on-screen fug
    of tobacco smoke, the impossibly youthful appearance of people still in the public
    eye, the phantoms of those who are dead and gone...

    Of many treasurable moments, one in particular stood out for me. Jeremy Thorpe
    was down in his Devon constituency, on camera yet speaking to the London studio
    via a large green telephone receiver clutched tight against his ear, and as he
    signed off he said he was planning to spend the weekend doing lots of gardening
    before returning to the fray on Monday. Back in the studio, Alastair Burnet said,
    very casually, "Jeremy Thorpe there, very Voltairean... now, some more results..."

    I cannot imagine any presenter today making that comment, either because they
    wouldn''t be capable of doing so, or, if they were, it would be considered too
    obscure a reference for the viewers, who need to be treated like slow-witted infants.

    I will, of course, be glued to the screen for hours come the forthcoming election,
    and will enjoy every minute of the coverage. But if any reference at all is made
    to anything outside the hermetically-sealed world o'' Westminster, it will be
    to an airhead "celebrity" rather than to an Enlightenment philosophe.'
