  text: 'John F Ptak at the invaluable Ptak Science Books blog has a superb post on
    Ranter and anti-Ranter pamphlets of the 17th century, in which he celebrates their
    way with titles, like this one:

    Hell broke loose: or, the notorious design of the wicked Ranters, discovered on
    Sunday last at Black-Fryers Being a true relation of the strange proceedings of
    Mr. Vaughan, and his wicked proselytes; and their entring of Black-Fryers church
    in sermon time, like so many spirits from hell, with four damnable papers in the
    hands, containing such horrible, audacious, and abominable songs, the like not
    to be parallel''d in former ages. With the manner how this onsolent Ranter traced
    the streets from Black-Fryers to Saint Paul''s Church-yard, in his Holland shirt,
    without doublet or breeches, a treble cap, like the Pope''s miter, with silk fring,
    and white shooes, and stockings. With their damnable plots, and conspiracies against
    the ministers of the gospel: their examination before the right honourable the
    Lord Mayor of London; the sad and woful speeched, made by the ringleader of the
    Ranters, concerning the city magistrates, and golden chains: and the committing
    of them to Bridewell till the next sessions. 1650'
