text: "Here are two things I learned today, which, taken together, have planted in\
  \ my brain the idea of writing A Dictionary Of Great Composers. These would be the\
  \ complete entries for those named, and dozens, nay, hundreds of others would be\
  \ similarly brief:\nSchubert, Franz. Upon his deathbed, his final wish was that\
  \ someone would bring him some books by James Fenimore Cooper.\nTippett, Michael.\
  \ He referred to the refrigerator in his kitchen as \u201CBernard Levin\u201D."
