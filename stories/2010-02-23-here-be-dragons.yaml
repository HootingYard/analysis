  text: 'One can truncate it slightly, and omit the inverted commas, without altering
    the essential meaning. This is the best headline since that business about Blunkett
    and the cow:

    Norman Tebbit attacks child in dragon outfit

    NOTE : Hmm. The Daily Mail has changed the headline on its story, thus making
    my truncation and omission comments meaningless. All I can say is that it''s a
    good job I posted this version before it was lost.'
