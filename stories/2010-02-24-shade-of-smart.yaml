  text: "Could it be that the shade of Christopher Smart is haunting the corridors\
    \ of a large and important municipal building in far away Oregon? This unlikely\
    \ question is prompted by a discovery made by Brit over at Think Of England. In\
    \ the course of his valuable research into the Official State Crustaceans of the\
    \ USA, Brit unearthed House Joint Resolution 37 from the Oregon Legislative Assembly,\
    \ adopted in 2009.\nThere is nobody called Smart among the Representatives and\
    \ Senators who passed the Resolution, but it is clear to me that the mad poet's\
    \ spirit hovered over whomsoever drafted it. Granted, it uses \u201CWhereas\u201D\
    \ rather than Christopher Smart's favoured \u201CLet\u201Ds and \u201CFor\u201D\
    s in Jubilate Agno, but otherwise this could be a lost fragment of that great\
    \ poem:\nWhereas the Dungeness crab fishery is the most valuable single-species\
    \ fishery in Oregon, making Dungeness crab an important part of Oregon's economy;\
    \ and\nWhereas the Dungeness crab is an iconic Oregon symbol; and\nWhereas the\
    \ Dungeness crab is the most delicious of the crab species; and\nWhereas the Dungeness\
    \ crab annual harvest begins each year on December 1, when Dungeness crabs are\
    \ hard-shelled, full of meat and in their prime; and\nWhereas the Dungeness crab\
    \ harvest ends on August 14 to minimize handling, so that post-molt, soft-shelled\
    \ crabs can fill out undisturbed; and\nWhereas this management method has served\
    \ the resource well for decades and ensures that the Dungeness crab fishery is\
    \ truly sustainable; now, therefore,\nBe It Resolved by the Legislative Assembly\
    \ of the State of Oregon:\nThat the Dungeness crab is the official crustacean\
    \ of the State of Oregon."
