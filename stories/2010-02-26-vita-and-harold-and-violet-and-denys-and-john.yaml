  text: "\u201CWhen Violet and Denys finally get married, after Vita decides just\
    \ before the wedding not to go through with the plan for the two women to elope\
    \ (she had heard from Harold, and \u2018something snapped in my mind\u2019), the\
    \ honeymooners and Vita all find themselves in Paris together, and Vita takes\
    \ Violet away from Denys (\u2018I wanted to say \u201CDon't you know, you stupid\
    \ fool, she is mine in every sense of the word?\u201D), then Denys takes her back\
    \ from Vita (\u2018That night I dined at the Ritz, and from the open window of\
    \ her room Violet watched me, and Denys sobbed in the room behind her\u2019, and\
    \ the general conclusion is that \u2018That day seems to have made a great impression\
    \ upon him\u2019\u2014well, I suppose it would) after which \u2018they went away\
    \ to St Jean de Luz, and I went to Switzerland with Harold\u2019, and then they\
    \ all go back to England, but soon the girls are off again, to Paris (\u2018I\
    \ used to sit in caf\xE9s drinking coffee, and watching people go by\u2019\u2014\
    fancy!) and Monte Carlo (\u2018divine\u2019), where \u2018a complication arose\
    \ over Denys announcing his arrival at Cannes\u2019 (by now his blue eyes must\
    \ have been damned near falling out of his head, never mind starting), and they\
    \ all form twos again and go back to London, but then Violet goes off to Amiens,\
    \ where Vita is to join her, for ever this time, only when Vita follows she takes\
    \ Denys along, which complicates the situation until Denys says he will leave\
    \ them and never come back (\u2018Denys cried the whole way\u2019), but he does\
    \ come back, this time travelling with Harold and only a couple of lengths behind\
    \ Violet's father, and then Harold actually suggests that Violet may have slept\
    \ with her own husband (\u2018I thought I should have gone mad when she said that\u2019\
    ) so Vita makes a scene and goes off with Harold from Amiens to Paris, and Violet's\
    \ father catches the same train, but no sooner do they get to Paris than Violet\
    \ turns up (maybe she was at the other end of the train), and the two girls go\
    \ up to Harold's and Vita's room, whereupon Harold bursts in with Denys (how many\
    \ people were on that train, for God's sake?), and Denys swears that he has never\
    \ done anything unbecoming with his own wife (\u2018I promise you there has never\
    \ been anything of that kind between Violet and me\u2019), which mollifies Vita\
    \ a little, \u2018but still it was bad enough that she should have deceived me\
    \ even to a certain extent\u2019, and then it all gets rather confused, except\
    \ that at one point Vita goes to Paris, Violet goes to Bordighera and Denys goes\
    \ to Cornwall (no mention of Harold\u2014perhaps he's just gone to bed), and among\
    \ other places visited by the various parties are Avignon, San Remo and Venice\u2014\
    oh, now I remember where Harold was\u2014he says he has been \u2018spending his\
    \ time with rather low people, the demi-monde\u2019, and he sums up by saying\
    \ \u2018my heart feels like a p\xEAche melba\u2019, and then Violet fades away\
    \ and Harold and Vita live happily ever after, apart from Vita's having an affair\
    \ with Virginia Woolf, and another one, just to vary things, with Geoffrey Scott,\
    \ while Harold\u2026\n\u201CThe long and the short of the matter is that practically\
    \ everybody in this ludicrous story has a nice comfortable income, apart from\
    \ the charwoman whom Vita steps across when visiting Violet early one morning,\
    \ and of whom she says \u2018There was a dreary slut scrubbing the doorstep\u2019\
    . When you have plenty of money you can not only afford to rush about between\
    \ London and Amiens and Paris (where you stay at the Ritz, of course\u2014well,\
    \ I mean, doesn't everybody?) and San Remo and Bordighera and Monte Carlo and\
    \ Avignon and Venice; you can also afford (if you are silly enough to want to)\
    \ to spend your time striking grotesque poses, keening over your own emotions,\
    \ and saying things like \u2018I had been vouchsafed insight, as one sometimes\
    \ is\u2019. The \u2018dreary slut\u2019 scrubbing the doorstep could no more afford\
    \ the poses than she could afford the travel, and I would dearly like to read\
    \ her diary, particularly if it contained a passage about some stupid, snobbish,\
    \ affected woman who stepped right on to her nice clean doorstep the minute after\
    \ she had just whitewashed the bleedin\u2019 thing.\u201D\nBernard Levin, reviewing\
    \ Portrait Of A Marriage by Nigel Nicolson in The Observer, 28 October 1973, collected\
    \ in Taking Sides (1979).\nADDENDUM\_: Elsewhere in the collection, Levin writes\
    \ thus of Yoko Ono's husband (in 1974): \u201CThere is nothing wrong with Mr Lennon\
    \ that could not be cured by standing him upside down and shaking him gently until\
    \ whatever is inside his head falls out.\u201D"
