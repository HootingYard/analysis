  text: '"When Violet and Denys finally get married, after Vita decides just before
    the wedding not to go through with the plan for the two women to elope (she had
    heard from Harold, and ''something snapped in my mind''), the honeymooners and
    Vita all find themselves in Paris together, and Vita takes Violet away from Denys
    (''I wanted to say "Don''t you know, you stupid fool, she is mine in every sense
    of the word?"), then Denys takes her back from Vita (''That night I dined at the
    Ritz, and from the open window of her room Violet watched me, and Denys sobbed
    in the room behind her'', and the general conclusion is that ''That day seems
    to have made a great impression upon him''--well, I suppose it would) after which
    ''they went away to St Jean de Luz, and I went to Switzerland with Harold'', and
    then they all go back to England, but soon the girls are off again, to Paris (''I
    used to sit in cafes drinking coffee, and watching people go by''--fancy!) and
    Monte Carlo (''divine''), where ''a complication arose over Denys announcing his
    arrival at Cannes'' (by now his blue eyes must have been damned near falling out
    of his head, never mind starting), and they all form twos again and go back to
    London, but then Violet goes off to Amiens, where Vita is to join her, for ever
    this time, only when Vita follows she takes Denys along, which complicates the
    situation until Denys says he will leave them and never come back (''Denys cried
    the whole way''), but he does come back, this time travelling with Harold and
    only a couple of lengths behind Violet''s father, and then Harold actually suggests
    that Violet may have slept with her own husband (''I thought I should have gone
    mad when she said that'') so Vita makes a scene and goes off with Harold from
    Amiens to Paris, and Violet''s father catches the same train, but no sooner do
    they get to Paris than Violet turns up (maybe she was at the other end of the
    train), and the two girls go up to Harold''s and Vita''s room, whereupon Harold
    bursts in with Denys (how many people were on that train, for God''s sake?), and
    Denys swears that he has never done anything unbecoming with his own wife (''I
    promise you there has never been anything of that kind between Violet and me''),
    which mollifies Vita a little, ''but still it was bad enough that she should have
    deceived me even to a certain extent'', and then it all gets rather confused,
    except that at one point Vita goes to Paris, Violet goes to Bordighera and Denys
    goes to Cornwall (no mention of Harold--perhaps he''s just gone to bed), and among
    other places visited by the various parties are Avignon, San Remo and Venice--oh,
    now I remember where Harold was--he says he has been ''spending his time with
    rather low people, the demi-monde'', and he sums up by saying ''my heart feels
    like a peche melba'', and then Violet fades away and Harold and Vita live happily
    ever after, apart from Vita''s having an affair with Virginia Woolf, and another
    one, just to vary things, with Geoffrey Scott, while Harold...

    "The long and the short of the matter is that practically everybody in this ludicrous
    story has a nice comfortable income, apart from the charwoman whom Vita steps
    across when visiting Violet early one morning, and of whom she says ''There was
    a dreary slut scrubbing the doorstep''. When you have plenty of money you can
    not only afford to rush about between London and Amiens and Paris (where you stay
    at the Ritz, of course--well, I mean, doesn''t everybody?) and San Remo and Bordighera
    and Monte Carlo and Avignon and Venice; you can also afford (if you are silly
    enough to want to) to spend your time striking grotesque poses, keening over your
    own emotions, and saying things like ''I had been vouchsafed insight, as one sometimes
    is''. The ''dreary slut'' scrubbing the doorstep could no more afford the poses
    than she could afford the travel, and I would dearly like to read her diary, particularly
    if it contained a passage about some stupid, snobbish, affected woman who stepped
    right on to her nice clean doorstep the minute after she had just whitewashed
    the bleedin'' thing."

    Bernard Levin, reviewing Portrait Of A Marriage by Nigel Nicolson in The Observer,
    28 October 1973, collected in Taking Sides (1979).

    ADDENDUM : Elsewhere in the collection, Levin writes thus of Yoko Ono''s husband
    (in 1974): "There is nothing wrong with Mr Lennon that could not be cured by standing
    him upside down and shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls
    out."'
