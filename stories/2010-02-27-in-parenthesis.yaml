  text: 'The greatest parenthesis in literature has already been written, and will
    never be improved upon. It is from Lolita, where Nabokov writes: "My very photogenic
    mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three."

    But one must always be on the lookout for superb phrases, or complete sentences,
    in parentheses, and there is a fine example in today''s Guardian. Into her review
    of The Woman Who Shot Mussolini by Frances Stonor Saunders, Lucy Hughes-Hallett
    drops this marvel: "(Rumour had it he kept a tortoise in his sporran.)"

    (One day I must set to work on an anthology of great parentheses.)'
