  text: "From The Times in 1833, enthusing about the new hydro-oxygen microscope:\n\
    \u201CIt can, in truth represent objects five hundred thousand times larger in\
    \ size than they really are. Thus the pores of the slenderest twig and the fibres\
    \ of the most delicate leaf expand into coarse net work. The external integuments\
    \ of a fly's eye, filled with thousands of lenses, appear the dimensions of a\
    \ lady's veil\u2014that gentleman yclept the flea, swells into six feet\u2014\
    worms seem like boa constrictors: while the population of a drop of goodly ditch\
    \ water presents such shapes as Teniers should have seen before he pencilled the\
    \ grotesque monsters who troubled the sleep of St Anthony.\u201D\nQuoted in The\
    \ Sun And The Moon\_: The Remarkable True Account Of Hoaxers, Showmen, Dueling\
    \ Journalists, And Lunar Man-Bats In Nineteenth-Century New York by Matthew Goodman\
