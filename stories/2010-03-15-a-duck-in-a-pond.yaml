  text: 'A duck in a pond, a pond near a swamp. Sometimes, the duck walks across the
    mud from the pond to the swamp and, standing on the edge, looks into the stagnant
    filth, like a duck Narcissus. On the horizon there are trees--larch, beech, sycamore,
    pine. Having gazed, unblinking, at its reflection, blurry, blurry, the duck turns
    about and walks back to the pond, into which it plashes, and often times upends
    itself, so to a passer-by only its fundament and feet are visible, its head and
    upper body submerged in the water. When a breeze gusts, as it usually does, the
    leaves on trees on the horizon rustle. If the breeze becomes a gale, the trees
    sway. Once the wind grew so strong one of them, a beech, crashed to the ground,
    its topmost twigs and branches falling into the swamp at the swamp''s edge. Fortunately
    for the duck, it was in the pond when this happened. The sky was black, for the
    wind was howling in the night, and there were no stars to be seen, because of
    clouds. The duck was terrified.

    If ever you pass by that pond, chuck some stale breadcrusts to the duck. If you
    are on your way to the trees, to take measurements, or to carve your initials
    and those of your sweetheart into the bark on a trunk, be sure to skirt the swamp.
    Even the stoutest and most voluminous wading boots will not save you from sinking
    into the murk and slime, glubb glubb glubb. If you take the proper route to the
    trees, you will pass the memorial garden where stones and piles of pebbles and
    rugged wooden crosses mark those whose souls the swamp has claimed. The duck has
    seen some of them, from the safety of its pond, as they sank, flailing and helpless
    and screaming. It is a traumatised duck.'
