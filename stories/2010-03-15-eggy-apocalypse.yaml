  text: "An important anniversary occured while I was away in Flanders, and I am very\
    \ grateful to Richard Carter, FCD, for drawing it to my attention. He writes:\n\
    Sadly, Orwell recorded the abandonment of his egg-count in his diary entry for\
    \ 13th March, 1940:\n\u2026Have now lost accurate count of the eggs & shall have\
    \ to close the egg-account book, which however gives an accurate account stretching\
    \ over 7 months, useful for future reference. From the milkman's account it appears\
    \ the hens have laid 270 eggs since 29.1.40 (6 weeks about). Yesterday 10. It\
    \ is now difficult to sell eggs, as there is a glut, so shall put some in water-glass.\n\
    Orwell's egg counting lasted much longer than my own pitiful attempt at a squirrel\
    \ count, and he was surely correct to note how useful it would be for future reference.\
    \ I am sure all Hooting Yard readers will share my sense of loss, knowing there\
    \ are no further egg tallies to pore over."
