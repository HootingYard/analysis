    Sun And The Moon : The Remarkable True Account Of Hoaxers, Showmen, Dueling Journalists,
    And Lunar Man-Bats In Nineteenth-Century New York by Matthew Goodman:

    Lewis Gaylord Clark on Edgar Allan Poe : "a mortified but impotent litterateur...
    an ambitious ''authorling'' perhaps of a small volume of effete and lamentable
    trash".

    I am minded to conduct enquiries into Dr Henry Hall Sherwood of New York, a man
    with "controversial electromagnetic theories" who "would become known for his
    ''savage rotary magnetic machine'' which he claimed could cure all manner of diseases
    from rheumatism to herpes and tuberculosis". Gosh!'
