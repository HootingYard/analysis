story:

  text: 'Alger Hiss lay sprawled on the jetty in his wetsuit. Oops, there ought to
    have been a space there... in his wet suit. It was a stylish and elegant suit,
    from Gabbitas & Thring, and it was sopping wet because some minutes earlier, Alger
    Hiss had toppled into the river basin, inadvertently, and had to haul himself
    back on to the jetty with no little exertion. He was still panting, and making
    a half-hearted attempt to wring out his soaking cuffs, when who should come striding
    along from the direction of the ice cream kiosk but Whittaker Chambers? Alger
    Hiss hailed his alleged pal with a weedy wave of his besuitsleeved arm. Whittaker
    Chambers waved back, and came lolloping along the jetty. His suit was less stylish,
    less elegant, and its crumpling was born of neglect rather than fashion.

    "How now, Hiss," he said, "I see you have been for a swim in the basin."

    "Not so, Chambers," Hiss replied, his panting somewhat abated, "I am afraid I
    fell in, clumsily."

    Whittaker Chambers removed a shred of lettuce from between his blackened rotting
    teeth and flicked it to the ground, but it sank gently in the air and came to
    land on the natty shoulderpiece of Alger Hiss''s suit.

    "Do you insult me, Chambers, for my clumsiness?" cried Hiss, shattered and woebegone.

    "Forgive me, Hiss," said Chambers, "I did not aim that lettuce-shred at you, and
    its falling upon you was as accidental as your toppling into the basin."

    "On this occasion I shall believe you, Chambers," said Hiss, marshalling his dignity,
    though he still lay sprawled, "Though you cannot claim to have been distracted,
    as I was when I toppled."

    "Oh?" said Chambers, "And what was it that distracted your attention and caused
    you to lose your footing at the very edge of the basin?"

    "My gaze was fixed upon the immensity of the heavens above us, rather than as
    it more wisely would have been upon the muddy path along which I trod," said Hiss.

    A glimmer of understanding flashed across Whittaker Chambers''s face.

    "Ah," he said, "You were looking up hoping to spot perhaps a Soviet spy plane
    scanning our terrain for valuable intelligence?"

    "Not at all," replied Hiss, clambering at last to his feet, "I was lost in contemplation."

    Whittaker Chambers looked at his alleged pal in some surprise.

    "What is there to contemplate?" he asked, "The sky is blue, and has clouds in
    it, and, fugitively, now and then, birds. And, if we are lucky, spy planes. But..."

    "Oh Chambers, Chambers!" said Hiss, interrupting him, "Be mindful of what Chalmers
    said. What is seen may be nothing to what is unseen; for what is seen is limited
    by the range of our instruments. What is unseen has no limit; and though all which
    the eye of man can take in, or his fancy can grasp, were swept away, there might
    still remain as ample a field, over which the Divinity may expatiate, and which
    He may have peopled with innumerable worlds. If the whole visible creation were
    to disappear, it would leave a solitude behind it--but to the Infinite Mind that
    can take in the whole system of nature, this solitude might be nothing; a small
    unoccupied point in that immensity which surrounds it, and which he may have filled
    with the wonders of his omnipotence. Though this earth were to be burned up, though
    the trumpet of its dissolution were sounded, though yon sky were to pass away
    as a scroll, and every visible glory, which the finger of the Divinity has inscribed
    on it, were to be put out for ever--an event, so awful to us, and to every world
    in our vicinity, by which so many suns would be extinguished, and so many varied
    scenes of life and of population would rush into forgetfulness--what is it in
    the high scale of the Almighty''s workmanship? a mere shred, which, though scattered
    into nothing, would leave the universe of God one entire scene of greatness and
    of majesty. Though this earth, and these heavens, were to disappear, there are
    other worlds which roll afar; the light of other suns shines upon them; and the
    sky which mantles them, is garnished with other stars. Is it presumption to say,
    that the moral world extends to these distant and unknown regions? that they are
    occupied with people? that the charities of home and of neighbourhood flourish
    there? that the praises of God are there lifted up, and his goodness rejoiced
    in? that piety has there its temples and its offerings? and the richness of the
    divine attributes is there felt and admired by intelligent worshippers?"

    Alger Hiss paused, and Whittaker Chambers took the opportunity to suggest that
    they stroll together, arm in arm, to the ice cream kiosk. Hiss nodded in agreement,
    and continued.

    "And what is this world in the immensity which teems with them--and what are they
    who occupy it? The universe at large would suffer as little, in its splendour
    and variety, by the destruction of our planet, as the verdure and sublime magnitude
    of a forest would suffer by the fall of a single leaf. The leaf quivers on the
    branch which supports it. It lies at the mercy of the slightest accident. A breath
    of wind tears it from its stem, and it lights on the stream of water which passes
    underneath."

    "Just as my dislodged shred of lettuce lighted upon your natty shoulder," said
    Chambers.

    "Indeed," said Hiss, "In a moment of time, the life we know, by the microscope,
    it teems with, is extinguished; and an occurrence so insignificant in the eye
    of man, and on the scale of his observation, carries in it, to the myriads which
    people this little leaf, an event as terrible and as decisive as the destruction
    of a world. Now, on the grand scale of the universe, we, the occupiers of this
    ball, which performs its little round among the suns and the systems that astronomy
    has unfolded--we may feel the same littleness, and the same insecurity. We differ
    from the leaf only in this circumstance, that it would require the operation of
    greater elements to destroy us. But these elements exist. The fire which rages
    within, may lift its devouring energy to the surface of our planet, and transform
    it into one wide and wasting volcano. The sudden formation of elastic matter in
    the bowels of the earth--and it lies within the agency of known substances to
    accomplish this--may explode it into fragments. The exhalation of noxious air
    from below, may impart a virulence to the air that is around us; it may affect
    the delicate proportion of its ingredients; and the whole of animated nature may
    wither and die under the malignity of a tainted atmosphere. A blazing comet may
    cross this fated planet in its orbit, and realize all the terrors which superstition
    has conceived of it. We cannot anticipate with precision the consequences of an
    event which every astronomer must know to lie within the limits of chance and
    probability. It may hurry our globe towards the sun--or drag it to the outer regions
    of the planetary system--or give it a new axis of revolution; and the effect,
    which I shall simply announce, without explaining it, would be to change the place
    of the ocean, and bring another mighty flood upon our islands and continents.
    These are changes which may happen in a single instant of time, and against which
    nothing known in the present system of things provides us with any security. They
    might not annihilate the earth, but they would unpeople it; and we who tread its
    surface with such firm and assured footsteps, are at the mercy of devouring elements,
    which, if let loose upon us by the hand of the Almighty, would spread solitude,
    and silence, and death, over the dominions of the world."

    "Your own footsteps were not so firm and assured when you toppled into the river
    basin," said Chambers, "But I should not tease you. Let me buy you a choc ice."

    The pair had arrived at the ice cream kiosk.

    "Just one thing," added Chambers, "When you speak of the Almighty, I assume you
    refer to Stalin?"

    "Hush, Chambers!" hissed Hiss, putting his finger to his lips, "Be careful. The
    fellow behind the ice cream kiosk counter may be a Federal Agent!"

    Whittaker Chambers slapped his forehead dramatically.

    "Dammit, Hiss, you are right of course. I am sorry."

    To be on the safe side, he made a great show, as he purchased two choc ices, of
    saluting the paper stars-and-stripes fluttering from the kiosk''s shingle roof.

    Munching their confectionery, as cold and chilly as the Siberian steppes, Alger
    Hiss and Whittaker Chambers walked off together in the blazing sunshine.
