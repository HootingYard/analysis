  text: "Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers were skulking along a corridor in a top\
    \ secret intelligence facility under cover of darkness when they heard, from a\
    \ heavily padlocked chamber, the unmistakeable sound of hissing.\n\u201CWhat do\
    \ you suppose that hissing sound is, Hiss?\u201D whispered Chambers, \u201CIt\
    \ sounds like a writhing tangle of asps.\u201D\n\u201CI very much doubt that it\
    \ is the hissing of asps, Chambers,\u201D replied Hiss, \u201CConsider where we\
    \ are.\u201D\nWhittaker Chambers looked perplexed.\n\u201CYou perplex me, Hiss,\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CHow can I know where we are when the entire point about the siting\
    \ of this top secret intelligence facility is that it is unmarked upon any map,\
    \ and that to get here we had to crawl through subterranean tunnels which twisted\
    \ and turned in such convolutions that all sense of direction, indeed all sense\
    \ of mental balance, is lost, and lost utterly?\u201D\nAlger Hiss smiled at his\
    \ alleged friend, and stooped to remove from the hollowed-out heel of his shoe\
    \ a small mechanism, fitting easily into the palm of his elegant hand, that looked\
    \ much like a compass.\n\u201CBy heavens, Hiss!\u201D hissed Chambers, \u201C\
    You have a compass!\u201D\n\u201CNot so, Chambers,\u201D replied Hiss, \u201C\
    This is in fact a miniature savage rotary magnetic machine, akin to the one devised\
    \ by Dr Henry Hall Sherwood of New York but designed for quite a different purpose\
    \ from his original.\u201D\nThe pair were now directly outside the chamber door,\
    \ and the hissing sound was louder, and more hissy than ever.\n\u201CBrilliant,\
    \ Hiss!\u201D whispered Chambers, \u201CTo use a magnetic machine of American\
    \ design to help facilitate the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Stalin\
    \ would approve such cunning. But what does it tell us?\u201D\n\u201CWell, Chambers,\u201D\
    \ said Hiss, \u201CNote the savagery of its magnetism and rotation, which increases\
    \ the closer we get to the door of the chamber. If I am not mistaken, beyond that\
    \ door is the bottomless viper-pit of Gaar!\u201D\nWhittaker Chambers's eyes nearly\
    \ popped out of his head.\n\u201CThe bottomless viper-pit of Gaar did you say,\
    \ Hiss?\u201D he said.\n\u201CI did, Chambers,\u201D said Hiss.\n\u201CB-b-but\
    \ how in the name of Lenin\u2026?\u201D\nAlger Hiss told his alleged friend that\
    \ the time for explanations would come later. For now, he said, it was enough\
    \ that they had located the top secret bottomless viper-pit. It was time to turn\
    \ back, make their way through the twisty turny subterranean tunnels, and meet\
    \ up with their Soviet contact, in heavy disguise, at the cocktail bar of a swish\
    \ hotel. He stowed the savage rotary magnetic machine back in his false heel,\
    \ and, taking Whittaker Chambers by his shabbily-suited arm, led him away from\
    \ the mysterious door, behind which the hissing of untold numbers of vipers continued,\
    \ growing fainter and fainter as the duo skulked away along the corridor."
