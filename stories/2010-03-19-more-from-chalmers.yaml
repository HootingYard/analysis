  text: 'Here is some more from Thomas Chalmers, a master of blithering nonsense wrapped
    in majestic prose. This is again from Discourses On The Christian Revelation,
    Viewed In Connection With The Modern Astronomy (1817):

    "What we have now to remark is, that the Infidel who urges the astronomical objection
    to the truth of Christianity, is only looking with half an eye to the principle
    on which it rests. Carry out the principle, and the objection vanishes. He looks
    abroad on the immensity of space, and tells us how impossible it is, that this
    narrow corner of it can be so distinguished by the attentions of the Deity. Why
    does he not also look abroad on the magnificence of eternity; and perceive how
    the whole period of these peculiar attentions, how the whole time which elapses
    between the fall of man and the consummation of the scheme of his recovery, is
    but the twinkling of a moment to the mighty roll of innumerable ages? The whole
    interval between the time of Jesus Christ''s leaving his Father''s abode to sojourn
    amongst us, to that time when He shall have put all His enemies under his feet,
    and delivered up the kingdom to God even His Father, that God may be all in all;
    the whole of this interval bears as small a proportion to the whole of the Almighty''s
    reign, as this solitary world does to the universe around it; and an infinitely
    smaller proportion than any time, however short, which an earthly monarch spends
    on some enterprise of private benevolence, does to the whole walk of his public
    and recorded history.

    "Why then does not the man, who can shoot his conceptions so sublimely abroad
    over the field of an immensity that knows no limits--why does he not also shoot
    them forward through the vista of a succession, that ever flows without stop and
    without termination? He has stept across the confines of this world''s habitation
    in space, and out of the field which lies on the other side of it has he gathered
    an argument against the truth of revelation. We feel that we have nothing to do
    but to step across the confines of this world''s history in time, and out of the
    futurity which lies beyond it can we gather that which will blow the argument
    to pieces, or stamp upon it all the narrowness of a partial and mistaken calculation.
    The day is coming when the whole of this wondrous history shall be looked back
    upon by the eye of remembrance, and be regarded as one incident in the extended
    annals of creation; and, with all the illustration and all the glory it has thrown
    on the character of the Deity, will it be seen as a single step in the evolution
    of His designs; and long as the time may appear, from the first act of our redemption
    to its final accomplishment, and close and exclusive as we may think the attentions
    of God upon it, it will be found that it has left Him room enough for all His
    concerns; and that, on the high scale of eternity, it is but one of those passing
    and ephemeral transactions which crowd the history of a never-ending administration."'
