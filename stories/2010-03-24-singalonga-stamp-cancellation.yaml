  text: Your favourite radio programme, Hooting Yard On The Air, will be six years
    old next month. As happens from time to time, I have been pondering whether or
    not to change the theme tune, which, since very early in the show's run, has been
    the "Caucasian Lullaby" by Slapp Happy & Henry Cow, from the Desperate Straights
    album of 1975. When I mention to people that I am considering a change, I am almost
    invariably met with gasps of horror, as if by dumping the eerie lullaby in favour
    of something else I would be doing violence to a well-loved national institution,
    much as if I were to throw pebbles at Stephen Fry. So there is every likelihood
    the sixth anniversary will come and go without any change whatsoever. I am enamoured,
    though, of the University of Ghana Postal Workers' Stamp-Cancelling Song, also
    from 1975, which was brought to my attention by Glyn Webster, to whom many thanks.
    Should this become the new Hooting Yard theme? Please make use of the Comments
