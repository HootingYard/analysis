  text: "That tiresome spring there appeared in the town a man surpassing grubby.\
    \ The sheer filthiness of him, in body and soul, caused untold jitters in the\
    \ townsfolk. Tongues wagged in taverns, and they did more than wag. There was\
    \ spitting and cursing and imprecation, until hotheads were quieted by the sending\
    \ of a citizens\u2019 delegation to the good burghers of the town. These burghers\
    \ were good, and they were elderly, and had terrific beards, and some were blind\
    \ or losing their sight, but this betokened, for the townsfolk, great wisdom,\
    \ on account of lore and legend.\nA hammer thumped thrice upon a panel indicated\
    \ the good burghers had made a decision, and the townsfolk gathered in the square\
    \ to hear it pronounced. The grubby man was to be coaxed into a tub of hot water,\
    \ and scrubbed with soapy brushes, scrubbed and rinsed and scrubbed and rinsed\
    \ until all trace of visible filth was expunged, and he would step from the tub\
    \ to be enwrapped in a large rectangular towel albino white while the water in\
    \ the tub was poured down a drain into the sewer.\nAnd so it came to pass.\nBut\
    \ voices were raised, in taverns and on street corners and in civic hubs of social\
    \ cohesion. The visible filth still lurked below, in the sewer, bubbling and frothing\
    \ and ready at any time to burst up through the piping, and also, also, never\
    \ forget, there was the grubbiness of the grubby man's soul, invisible yet the\
    \ more potent for that. A second citizens\u2019 delegation, a second thumping\
    \ of the hammer, a second gathering in the market square.\nThis time the good\
    \ burghers made two determinations, to meet the two concerns of the townsfolk.\
    \ First, that each day, forever, the sewers would be scrubbed and rinsed, with\
    \ brushes and hot water and carbolic soap, scrubbed and rinsed from end to end,\
    \ by volunteers. Second, that the grubby man would endure a course of moral instruction\
    \ and his soul examined daily, for hours and hours, under duress, until every\
    \ fleck of turpitude was obliterated in the pitiless light of Bl\xF6tzmannist\
    \ Lovely Thought.\nAnd so it came to pass.\nAnd hard as it may be to hold in your\
    \ head, that man surpassing grubby became, oh after many a year of instruction\
    \ and examination, a pillar of the community, never quite a good burgher yet one\
    \ whose advice was sought by townsfolk young and old on such matters as dogs and\
    \ cats and postal deliveries and running track maintenance and lamppost height\
    \ and Belisha beacon brightness and the fish market and soup recipes and ballet\
    \ troupe recruitment and gusts of wind and air temperature and flocks of swooping\
    \ scavenger birds and bus stop furniture and mountaineering equipment and oil\
    \ waste and Japanese fog monitoring systems and duck calls and the vanity of human\
    \ wishes and snow flurries and the raking of autumn leaves and pig feeding and\
    \ the brains of lobsters and the Flemish Primitives and mulching garden plots\
    \ and filth and muck and untold grubbiness.\nFor scrub and rinse as they might,\
    \ the volunteers never quite managed to eradicate the visible filth from the sewer.\n\
    And on the seventh day, petals fell in Petaluma."
