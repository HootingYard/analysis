  text: 'When I was young, I was keen to study the fantastic architecture of the burning
    cities. I enrolled in a college run according to Blotzmannist principles. We were
    taught to build scale models of the more outlandish buildings, from paper and
    cardboard and gum, and to set fire to them and watch them burn, keeping a safe
    distance. Viewed through heavy duty hectorscopes, from behind the potted begonias
    and chrysanthemums in our workroom, the effect was astonishing. One could imagine
    oneself standing, windswept, upon the tor, watching from that high peak, with
    its glistening mere, the city in flames far below.

    And when it was reduced to ashes and dust, what then? What then? Had we really
    been upon the tor, we would have no city to return to. As the smoke dispersed,
    would we have trooped down the far side of the tor and set out for new, undiscovered
    lands, to build and burn anew? Pimply students, we need not risk such adventure.
    We took our brooms and dustpans and swept up the ashes and then we left the workroom,
    laughing and babbling, heading across the lawn, with its glistening pond, for
    the cafeteria.

    And as we gobbled and drank, the college janitor locked up his cupboard, hung
    his keys on the hook in the porch, and took the bus to the foot of the tor. Up
    he trudged to the top, and he sat by the glistening mere, and looked upon the
    city, and he wept.'
