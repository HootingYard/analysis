  text: 'For some time now, I have been considering making a proper study of the hoof-patterns
    imprinted in mud or snow by celebrities. I speak, of course, of those celebrities
    who are hooved, either because they are centaurs, or are goat-footed beasts spawned
    by Beelzebub. The latter is often true of those celebrities one commonly sees
    only from the waist, or indeed neck, up. Celebrity centaurs are rarer, but can
    easily be spotted by the eye trained to spot such things. "Centaurs", incidentally,
    is an anagram of "Etruscan". That is well worth remembering.

    It will be objected that the last thing the world needs is for Hooting Yard to
    descend into the brain-dead realm of celebrity fixation, and I agree. See me nod.
    See me nod more. See me nod so much my head all but detaches itself and rolls
    along the lane into a ditch. See a cloud of flies settle upon my head in the ditch
    and poke their probosces into my scalp to suck upon my brain. See Old Farmer Frack
    disperse the flies with fumes from his aerosol repellant canister. See Old Farmer
    Frack pick up my head and place it in his sack. See Old Farmer Frack trudge along
    the lane swinging my head in a sack as he heads for the eerie barn.

    Sorry, where was I? Ah yes, celebrity hoof patterns. They have much to teach us,
    and I do not think we should ignore those lessons just because of celebrity involvement.
    For example, it was reported to me by an unimpeachable source that a trail of
    hoof imprints left in an Alpine snowdrift by a well-known celebrity centaur from
    the world of television cookery programmes shows an identical pattern--identical!--to
    the disposition of sightseers on the grassy knoll in Dallas at the very moment
    of the first shot from Lee Harvey Oswald''s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle on 22nd November
    1963. Unfortunately, because the snowdrift melted, as snowdrifts do, this cannot
    be independently verified.  Those of you muttering that I ought to have inserted
    the word "allegedly" somewhere alongside Oswald''s name should go and read your
    Posner.

    A second example, again well attested, is the extraordinary set of hoofprints
    left in mud by a Booker Prize-nominated celebrity goat devil in Penge. The pattern
    formed by the prints, viewed from a certain angle, in a certain light, on certain
    days, in certain mirrors, appears to spell out a line or two from the Book of
    Revelation, if written in spidery handwriting by a hamfisted shaking person. I
    have seen a blurred black and white photograph of this phenomenon, and I am convinced.

    There is much more material, suitable for a lavish coffee table book. Both the
    book and the coffee table designed to uphold it will be lavish, the latter perhaps
    more so than the former. It will be built from wood, teak or mahogany, stained
    with the most excellent varnish available, each leg carved to form a mythological
    figure, representing in turn Europe, America, Africa and Asia, similar to that
    of the splendid wooden carvings on the massive pulpit in St Peter''s church in
    the university town of Leuven in Brabant. The sole deviation from the standard
    iconography will be that each figure will have the hooves of a goat, embedded
    in wooden mud or snow.

    Wooden mud, ah! It is a fine, fine thing.'
