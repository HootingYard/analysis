  text: 'The time is right, I think, to flex my ornithological chops by setting a
    daily bird-related challenge. By doing so, I hope to silence forever those fiends
    who mutter darkly that "Actually, Mr Key is a complete ignoramus in matters avian".
    It is astonishing, is it not, that such brickbats can be thrown? Yet they are,
    with distressing regularity. Well, let us see how the birdy know-alls deal with
    the first of these challenges!

    Your task, which you must accept on pain of Aubreyan kim kam, is, bebooted and
    with your bird spotters'' book tucked in to the pocket of your rainwear, to locate
    and identify the following birds, as mentioned in Slouching Towards Kalamazoo
    by Peter De Vries (1983):

    "That there is no bluebird of happiness, only the robin of resigned acceptance
    of things as they are. The plain everyday starling of common, undeluded reality...
    and then what next?... The grackle of total disillusionment?"

    So there are four birds to spot, and spot well. No ordinary bluebirds, nor robins,
    nor starlings, nor grackles, mind. And, once spotted, you must execute pencil
    or crayon sketches of each, and post them, or links to them, in the Comments carton.
    Off you go!'
