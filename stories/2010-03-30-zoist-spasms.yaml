  text: '"Spasms (kraempfe) are an affection to which almost all sensitives are especially
    inclined. Many, especially those of a higher degree, suffer from them severely.
    They form the last term of the series--stomach-ache, head-ache, fainting, spasm.
    They may be occasioned by magnets, by terrestrial magnetism, by poles of crystals,
    by amorphous, unipolar, bodies, either odo-positive or odo-negative, by human
    odic poles, by the prismatic rays of either the solar or lunar spectrum, particularly
    the green rays, by down passes, but oftener by up passes, by charging and conduction,
    whether immediate or approximative, by the mere odic atmosphere, by the psychical
    action of insult, grief, anxiety, fear, annoyance, jealousy, quarrels, mental
    exertion, joy, or even dreams. They are most conspicuous in the extremities, solar
    plexus, and head. They can be artificially excited and calmed, or depart naturally.
    They often follow a tolerably similar course from the toes through the abdomen
    to the brain, and thence down the spinal cord, like a pass. In most cases they
    can be more or less easily calmed by down passes. Hence as they are essentially
    related to sensitiveness, and immediately dependent on odic motions, they undoubtedly
    belong to the domain of od."
