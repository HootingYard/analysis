  text: 'Oi, FK!, writes Tim Thurn in his usual artless manner, I am appalled at the
    latest evidence of your slipshod treatment of your loyal readers. I very much
    welcomed the Daily Bird Challenge instituted here on Monday, and I was even preparing
    to acknowledge that perhaps you do know a little bit about ornithological matters
    and are not a hopeless avian dumbkopf, as I have always suspected.

    I threw myself heart and soul into the first of your challenges, removing my binoculars
    from the satchel wherein they have been gathering dust since the last century
    and stalking up and down and around my bailiwick hoping to spot a bluebird and
    a robin and a starling and a grackle. I took a bag of reconstituted meat paste
    sandwiches and a flask of piping hot tea, because I was in this for the long haul,
    and could see myself being stranded on a hillside come dusk. I even had a picnic
    blanket thrown over my shoulder, just in case. I spent the whole bloody day in
    the open air, in spite of the weather, though I would have liked nothing better
    than to be curled up on a rug in front of a roaring fire, like a well-kept dog.

    Now, perhaps it is my own fault that I failed to check the noticeboard outside
    the civic hall, and thus was unaware that Monday had been designated And No Birds
    Sing Day by the authorities, in honour of some ailing palely loitering knight-at-arms
    of yesteryear. Clearly, the birds, their tweeting and chirruping forbad, voted
    with their wings and scarpered to a different neighbourhood for the day. That
    is why I failed to spot any birds at all, let alone the ones designated in your
    challenge. But I repeat, I put a great deal of effort into it, at some risk to
    my holistic wellbeing, for I suffered much, much!, until I eventually threw in
    the towel, towards midnight, and staggered home in a state of mental and corporeal
    exhaustion. The straw that broke the camel''s back was when I was impugned by
    a peasant while trudging around the lake, upon which even the sedge was wither''d.

    I slept in fits and starts, having hideous dreams about eggs and monkeys, but
    when I rose on Tuesday and plunged my head into a bucket of icy water, I consoled
    myself that the day would bring a new bird challenge. I resolved to be better
    prepared, and before dawn I took a little hike over to the civic hall to check
    the noticeboard for any further bird-related announcements. There were none, but
    to be on the safe side I popped in to Old Pa Kropotkin''s Bleach ''n'' Fags ''n''
    Periodicals Kiosk to pick up the local newspaper. Back home before cock-crow,
    I read This Particular Bailiwick''s Daily Intelligencer front to back, line by
    line, twice, over a breakfast of goat milk slops. I did not want a repeat of yesterday,
    with its crushing humiliations, so I meant to be absolutely sure I was apprised
    of all pertinent local ornithological goings-on before I took the daily Hooting
    Yard bird challenge.

    There was much to take in, for the Intelligencer was packed with special reports
    from its tiptop bird reporter, young Dagobert Stalin, whom I had had the pleasure
    of meeting a couple of times as he scampered around the bailiwick with his reporter''s
    pad and propelling pencil. There on page one was his "take" on the success (or
    otherwise) of And No Birds Sing Day. Apparently a crone on Rolf Harris Avenue
    had failed to muffle her sandpiper, while an avant-gardist at the Conservatoire
    had insisted on rehearsing his Passacaglia For Three Electronically Enhanced Buffleheads.
    Both crone and composer were to be shot at dawn, I learned, and in fact, in the
    distance, I heard the firing squad. Turning to page two, Stalin had a piece about
    owls, from which I could wring no sense, since he had written it aping the style
    of Terry Eagleton. The next few pages were taken up with the dismal and the mundane.
    I was looking for announcements and pronouncements of a birdy hue, and eventually
    found some on the inside back page. Today, Tuesday, I learned, there was to be
    an ostrich display in the park, the unveiling of a tin blue-footed booby statue
    in the market square, some flummery with birdseed and tea-strainers at the Opera
    House Annexe, and, according to Dagobert Stalin, the expected appearance, in the
    sky, of an enormous flock of migrating swallows, a flock so enormous it would
    blot out the sun. On the back page there was a small item about a siskin, an attractive
    little finch, caged, and to be presented as a prize to the orphanage''s Orphan
    Of The Month. Spooning the last of my goat milk slops down my gullet, I was well
    pleased and confident that I was as prepared as ever I could be for today''s bird
    challenge.

    Inside the technohut, I depressed the computer knob which began the process of
    "powering up" my Macrohard Vista operating system. In just a few hours now, I
    would be plugged in to the information superhighway of which Mr Blair had spoken
    with such enthusiasm. It seemed so long ago, that bright new dawn when things
    could only get better. I could barely remember whether it was before or after
    Peter Mandelson sported a dapper moustache, and which guide dog accompanied David
    Blunkett at the time. Thinking these thoughts, with time to kill, and savouring
    the goaty residue coating my tongue, I strode manfully over to the town gymnasium
    to throw medicine balls around to no apparent purpose and to spend a while on
    the simulated bobsleigh machine. At the corner, as luck would have it, I bumped
    into young Dagobert Stalin, but he was in a frantic hurry, rushing to some newsworthy
    incident, of which I would no doubt read in tomorrow''s paper.

    PT done and puffed out, not unlike a magic dragon, I returned to the hut and was
    pleased to see steam hissing from the i-ears of the computer, a sure sign that
    only a few minutes remained before its "booting up" would be complete. I was already
    booted, of course, and, in anticipation of the challenge to come, had changed
    into my dappled dun suburban rambling fatigues. I sat at the console and waited
    for the Brian Eno Parp. As soon as it parped, I logged in to what our Belgian
    chums call het internet and steered my way to Hooting Yard.

    What did I find? A picture of Rolf Harris, never unwelcome, but of no ornithological
    interest. Some drivel about Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss. The mention, twice,
    of "certain swooping birds of the air" momentarily sparked my interest, but no
    challenge was laid down to the reader, so I spat into my spittoon and moved on.
    Nineteenth century twaddle about mesmerism, followed by blather about soup. And?
    And? Nothing else. No Daily Bird Challenge.

    This, Key, is what I mean when I rebuke you for being slipshod and abusing the
    devotion, sometimes fanatical, of your readers. It has become quite clear that
    you know not a jot about ornithology, but I am now forced to ask if you actually
    understand what the word "daily" means. The newspaper I pored over with beetle-browed
    concentration is This Particular Bailiwick''s Daily Intelligencer. Has the significance
    of that title occurred to you? It signals, even to a halfwit, that the paper comes
    out every day. Not just now and then. Not just on rainy days. Not just when young
    Dagobert Stalin, its tiptop bird reporter, can be bothered to clamber out of bed
    a-morning and arm himself with his reporter''s pad and propelling pencil and charge
    with the vigour of youth through the streets and fields keeping his eyes peeled
    for all manner of birdy activity. No, the paper appears, on Old Pa Kropotkin''s
    kiosk counter and on other counters, and on shelves and racks and turny display
    carousels, every single day of the year, except of course for important festive
    holidays when everything shuts down. I speak of days such as the anniversary of
    the Hindenburg disaster and Yoko Ono''s birthday. But otherwise, "daily" means
    "every day". How in the name of the Prince Elector of Tantarabim can you claim
    as much for your bird challenge? It appeared once, and then the very next day
    it was gone, pfft!, vanished in the haze, like that conjuring trick with the magnet
    and the whisk and the attractive little caged siskin which I have been practising
    in my leisure hours.

    I am surely not the only reader to find myself sorely tested by your cavalier
    ways, Mr Key. Why don''t you just come clean and admit that what little you know
    of birds could be written, in very big bold block capitals, on a pinhead, and
    the head of a tiny, tiny pin at that, not one of the bigger ones you find in shops
    for the larger pin and pointy thing user? Were you to confess as much, believe
    me, you would feel refreshed, as if washed in the blood of the lamb and wrapped
    in a towel of unimaginable fluffiness. If I were not due back at the gymnasium
    in a few minutes to put all the medicine balls back in their cupboards and to
    tweak and grease the simulated bobsleigh machine in readiness for the orphans''
    simulated bobsleigh cup tie needle match tomorrow, I would happily draft a mea
    culpa for you, with vivid and sprightly wording you could be proud of. As it is,
    I and the rest of your despicably ill-treated readers will have no choice but
    to entrust you to do the decent thing.

    Yours, more in sorrow than in anger, well, in truth, boiling with rage and minded
    to strangle a few hens to assuage my fury, Tim Thurn.

    Mr Key would like it to be known, and not just known but shouted from atop tors
    and promontories, that he has no intention of writing any such confession of avian
    ignorance, now or at any time in the future, for he knows all there is to know
    about birds, from the Arabian babbler to the barn owl to the carrion crow to the
    dotterel to the Egyptian goose to the fulmar to the Goliath heron to the hoopoe
    to the indigo bunting to the jackdaw to the kittiwake to the little stint to the
    moorhen to the nightjar to the Oriental pratincole to the pin-tailed snipe to
    Quetzalcoatl, albeit a mythical serpent, but with feathers, with feathers, like
    a bird, to the ruddy shelduck to the sombre tit to the twite to the upland sandpiper
    to the veery to the whimbrel to the yellow-bellied sapsucker, yea, unto Zino''s
    petrel. Shame on you, Tim Thurn, shame on you! Next you will be telling me there
    is a bird beginning with X. There is not.'
