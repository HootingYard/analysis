  text: "Half a dozen precautions against premature burial:\n\u201CThe novelist Wilkie\
    \ Collins always left a letter on his dressing-table adjuring anyone finding him\
    \ dead to call a doctor and make certain, Harriet Martineau left her doctor ten\
    \ pounds to see that her head was amputated before burial, the actress Ada Cavendish\
    \ willed that her jugular vein be cut before interment, and the journalist Edmund\
    \ Yates did likewise, providing twenty guineas as a fee for the officiating surgeon.\
    \ Lady Burton provided for her heart to be pierced with a needle, while Meyerbeer\
    \ arranged to have bells tied to his extremities when he was dead.\u201D\nRonald\
