  text: 'Half a dozen precautions against premature burial:

    "The novelist Wilkie Collins always left a letter on his dressing-table adjuring
    anyone finding him dead to call a doctor and make certain, Harriet Martineau left
    her doctor ten pounds to see that her head was amputated before burial, the actress
    Ada Cavendish willed that her jugular vein be cut before interment, and the journalist
    Edmund Yates did likewise, providing twenty guineas as a fee for the officiating
    surgeon. Lady Burton provided for her heart to be pierced with a needle, while
    Meyerbeer arranged to have bells tied to his extremities when he was dead."
