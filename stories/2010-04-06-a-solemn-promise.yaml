  text: "The calling of a general election means that for the next month the ether\
    \ will be clogged with a miasma of vacuous twaddle. This sceptred isle will ring\
    \ with the outpourings of brain-dead pointyheads and vox pop riffraff alike. And\
    \ I shall lap it all up, with the enthusiasm of a cat pouncing upon an injured\
    \ starling.\nBut but but. Much as Hooting Yard readers may faint with pleasure\
    \ at mentions of cow-attack Blunkett and diminutive Great Helmswoman Blears and\
    \ those curious little Milibands, I have been asked to make a solemn promise not\
    \ to babble about such tosh. This means that you will be deprived of thirty-odd\
    \ days of a Hooting Yard Election Watch, unless of course I crack.\nApparently,\
    \ if I do crack, and break my vow, and start bloviating on matters electoral,\
    \ I am likely to find myself in a similar position to this hapless peasant:\n\n\
    \u2026 which is a reminder to readers with more money than sense to take part\
    \ in the auction."
