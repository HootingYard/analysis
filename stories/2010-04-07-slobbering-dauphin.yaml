  text: "In a piece marking the death, at 85, of General Alexander Haig, Christopher\
    \ Hitchens described the fifty-ninth US Secretary of State as a \u201Cslobbering\
    \ dauphin\u201D. This phrase will be more familiar to Hooting Yard readers as\
    \ the one commonly used to refer to Prince Fulgencio's sickly, pipsqueak son and\
    \ heir, whose official title was His Luminous Magnificence The Princeling Balthazar\
    \ Clovis Agamemnon De Pig De Pig Of Oogah And Sluice In The Islands Of Widdecombe\
    \ Sound. That was what it said on his badge. But everybody, including Prince Fulgencio\
    \ himself, called him the slobbering dauphin, when they were talking about him\
    \ or, indeed, talking to him.\nA typical exchange might go as follows:\nPrince\
    \ Fulgencio\_: Good grief! Ever since we arrived here at Fort Hoity where I am\
    \ to review my trooplets and cut a princely dash, you, slobbering dauphin, have\
    \ been slobbering away and quite taking the shine off my regal jib.\nThe Princeling\_\
    : Slobber slobber slobber.\nPrince Fulgencio\_: There, you are at it again! Yes,\
    \ slobbering dauphin, I am slapping my forehead hard, for you leave me at my wits\u2019\
    \ end. Perhaps it is your forehead I ought to be slapping, if I did not think\
    \ doing so would make you slobber all the more!\nThe Princeling\_: Slobber slobber\
    \ slobber.\nPrince Fulgencio\_: There is only one thing for it! While I remain\
    \ here at Fort Hoity I must have you out of my sight, so you must go to Fort Toity,\
    \ a mile or two yonder across the glinka, and stay put. You may take a little\
    \ groupuscule of henchpersons with you. Now hie thee hence, slobbering dauphin!\n\
    Thus is explained the otherwise puzzling fact that the spindly and sickly and\
    \ slobbering dauphin found himself, that long hot summer, in sole command of Fort\
    \ Toity. Freed from the repressive influence of his loathsome Papa, the Princeling's\
    \ slobberings grew fewer, and on some days he barely slobbered at all. Though\
    \ there was, at Fort Toity as at Fort Hoity, a full complement of domestic staff,\
    \ he spent much of his time in the first few days buffing the crenellations with\
    \ a rag, until they glistened. When this activity exhausted his weedy constitution,\
    \ the Princeling sprawled pallid and wan upon cushions, on a balcony, gazing for\
    \ hours at the desolate glinka, with its few scattered clumps of lightning-blasted\
    \ shrubbery and, dotted here and there, yawning pits of doom into which would\
    \ topple, from time to time, such small blind stupid furry creatures as had strayed\
    \ from their nestings and burrows in search of food. The sun was immense, and\
    \ golden.\nIn his paperback potted biography of the Princeling, Pebblehead is\
    \ at pains to point out that the slobbering dauphin's balcony cushions were uncomfortable,\
    \ and thus that his lolling upon them for untold hours was a kind of penitence.\
    \ But penitence for what? Pebblehead does not say, at least not explicitly. At\
    \ the time of the Fort Toity summer, the Princeling was but a pipsqueak youth,\
    \ and had not the years behind him to have drummed up the kind of catalogue of\
    \ crimes other writers have imputed to him, confusing him perhaps with his black-hearted\
    \ father, or even perhaps with the deranged killer Babinsky, to whom, in later\
    \ life, when he had grown an impressive walrus moustache, the Princeling bore\
    \ more than a passing resemblance. Indeed, it became a tactic of Babinsky's, whenever\
    \ the coppers were closing in on him, to slobber, the better to outwit them. Certainly\
    \ we have not one whit of evidence that the slobbering dauphin was involved in\
    \ the series of outrages that took place in and around the glinka in the months\
    \ before he was installed at Fort Toity. In any case, even had he harboured a\
    \ desire to wipe out great swathes of peasantry, how likely is it that he would\
    \ have crept about from place to place poisoning wells, when all he need do, as\
    \ Princeling, was to drop a word in his father's ear? Prince Fulgencio was always\
    \ looking for any excuse to issue a ukase to his henchpersons and to have them\
    \ clattering about the place on their fine ferocious horses bringing death and\
    \ ruination in their wake. That was the kind of Prince he was, those the kind\
    \ of henchpersons.\nIt is possible that Pebblehead mistranslated the ancient documents,\
    \ getting \u201Cuncomfortable cushions\u201D where he ought to have had \u201C\
    gorgeous embroidered pillows stuffed with duck down and a new kind of foam material\
    \ soft as marshmallow\u201D. The Princeling's own jottings give no sense that\
    \ he was consumed by guilt and the desire for uncomfortable cushion penitence,\
    \ though they are difficult to read, because his slobbering was always at its\
    \ most slobbery when he was writing, even during that blazing Fort Toity summer,\
    \ when he slobbered less in general.\nThere was an amusing fashion, for a brief\
    \ period in the latter half of the last century, for wealthy beat music combos\
    \ to decamp to chateaux, there to engage in the dual activities of high debauch\
    \ and the waxing of their latest disc. As we know full well, there is nothing\
    \ new under the sun, that immense and golden orb that beat down, once, upon the\
    \ desolate glinka and upon the balcony where the slobbering dauphin sprawled upon\
    \ his cushions. And one blazing noon, his brain grown hot, the Princeling had\
    \ a sudden thought, and clapped his hands to summon a henchperson.\nThe Princeling\_\
    : Today I am able to stop slobbering long enough to speak coherently, Arpad. [For\
    \ the henchperson's name was Arpad.] My brain is hot, and I have a sudden thought.\
    \ I want you to go bustling about the villages on the edges of the glinka and\
    \ round up some musicians. Players on the sackbut and shawm and pipe and drum\
    \ and what have you. Bring them to me, at once!\nArpad : It will be enacted, O\
    \ slobbering dauphin.\nArpad the henchperson was a frighteningly efficient fellow,\
    \ and no sooner had he been given his orders than he was off, on a cart drawn\
    \ by several horses borrowed from Prince Fulgencio's magnificent horsery at Fort\
    \ Hoity. As Pebblehead pointed out, for all his evil ways, Prince Fulgencio had\
    \ done much to eradicate sickness among his steeds, and the Fort Hoity horsery\
    \ proudly proclaimed itself to be free of glanders, headshaking, lethal white\
    \ syndrome, mud fever, contagious equine metritis, rainscald, strangles, quiltor,\
    \ hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia, choke, grass sickness, recurrent\
    \ airway obstruction, cerebellar abiotrophy, lavender foal syndrome, pythiosis,\
    \ poll evil, and many another common horse disease. So healthy and vigorous were\
    \ the horses pulling his cart that Arpad made the rounds of the villages in a\
    \ single afternoon, and returned to Fort Toity at dusk with various sackbuttists\
    \ and shawmists and pipers and drummers, to the unbridled delight of the Princeling,\
    \ who cut some capers and slobbered, and rewarded Arpad with a personal picnic\
    \ basket.\nSo happy was the Princeling that his slobbering became uncontrollable,\
    \ and he had to write down his instructions for the musicians, with Arpad at his\
    \ side mopping the slobber into a cup so it did not drip upon the vellum. Although\
    \ the original is lost, Pebblehead was able to reconstruct the Princeling's scribble\
    \ using the technique known as \u201Cboggle-eyed hallucinatory scribble reconstruction\u201D\
    , sitting in a darkened room kept at a constant chill, and with beetles scurrying\
    \ across the floor. The bestselling paperbackist actually wrote two entirely different\
    \ versions, because he was enjoying himself so much, but only one is suitable\
    \ for family reading. According to Pebblehead, this is what the slobbering dauphin\
    \ wrote:\nWhile I was buffing the crenellations with a rag, and more so when I\
    \ was just lying sprawled on cushions on the balcony gazing upon the desolation\
    \ of the glinka, all the while I have been hearing noises in my head. Noises,\
    \ I say? No, music, the music of the spheres, or at least between my ears. Now,\
    \ I charge you raggle-taggle band of players to make this music known to the world\
    \ outside my head, so others, including Arpad here, and the other henchpersons,\
    \ and my father's majestic horses, and the domestic staff, and all who dwell in\
    \ Fort Toity, and beyond, beyond the glinka, in the villages from whence you came,\
    \ and elsewhere, may hear it. For it is music destined to be immortal. It will\
    \ outlast me, as it will outlast my terrible reproachful father, Prince Fulgencio,\
    \ as it will outlast even you, who play it. For I command also Arpad, with or\
    \ without the help of his fellow henchpersons, to devise, from polished magnetic\
    \ pebbles and pointy bits of tin and interlocking wheels and belts made from the\
    \ stretchy sinewy guts of badgers and the like, an engine to entrap and then to\
    \ recreate this music, over and over again, so you need no longer play it and\
    \ may begone from Fort Toity and return to your villages. So, begin to play upon\
    \ your sackbuts and shawms and pipes and drums, and I will direct and guide you\
    \ by gesticulation of my arms and legs and movements of my brow, and by slobbering.\n\
    The music thus created, by fits and starts and with much agon, sounded remarkably\
    \ like the genre we know today as \u201Csmooth death metal\u201D. Before summer's\
    \ end, it was blasted by Arpad's engine across the glinka, from dawn to dusk,\
    \ occasionally jaunty, sometimes pounding, but mostly just smooth and deathly\
    \ and metallic, just as the slobbering dauphin heard it inside his head.\nBut\
    \ the summer ended, as summers will, and one morning Prince Fulgencio came to\
    \ Fort Toity, roaring his head off, on horseback, flanked by a trooplet of brutish\
    \ henchpersons.\nPrince Fulgencio\_: Well, slobbering dauphin, I have shut up\
    \ Fort Hoity for the bleaker months, and am set upon a long and arduous journey\
    \ to Castle Blunkett, there to hole up for the winter tormenting the peasantry\
    \ and eradicating disease among the horses and guide dogs. I wish you to accompany\
    \ me, for so vast is the castle that you can have your own wing to slobber in,\
    \ slobber as you will.\nThe Princeling\_:\_ Slobber slobber slobber.\nThen came\
    \ a wind such as swept across the glinka on autumnal mornings, a bitter wind.\
    \ Arpad helped the weedy Princeling up on to a horse, and off he rode, slobbering\
    \ onto the horse's magnificent shining mane, riding into the wind."
