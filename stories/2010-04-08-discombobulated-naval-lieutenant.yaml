  text: '"Dropping his studies in the realms of proverbial philosophy, that amiable
    mid-Victorian butt, Martin Tupper, toyed for a time with spiritualism. He attended
    one of Mrs Hall''s seances, when, with Home as the medium, the company included
    ''a countess, the widow of a colonel, and a naval lieutenant''. As a preliminary,
    they were instructed to ''kneel down and offer up a prayer''. This appears to
    have been effective, since the table rose from the floor, raps resounded by the
    dozen, and Home pulled red-hot coals out of the fire with his fingers. Although
    he had braved battle and the breeze often enough, such a spectacle was apparently
    too much for the representative of the senior service. ''It quite altered his
    career'', says Tupper, ''and, soon afterwards, he took Holy Orders''."
