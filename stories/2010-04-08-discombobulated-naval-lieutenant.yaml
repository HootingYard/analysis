  text: "\u201CDropping his studies in the realms of proverbial philosophy, that amiable\
    \ mid-Victorian butt, Martin Tupper, toyed for a time with spiritualism. He attended\
    \ one of Mrs Hall's s\xE9ances, when, with Home as the medium, the company included\
    \ \u2018a countess, the widow of a colonel, and a naval lieutenant\u2019. As a\
    \ preliminary, they were instructed to \u2018kneel down and offer up a prayer\u2019\
    . This appears to have been effective, since the table rose from the floor, raps\
    \ resounded by the dozen, and Home pulled red-hot coals out of the fire with his\
    \ fingers. Although he had braved battle and the breeze often enough, such a spectacle\
    \ was apparently too much for the representative of the senior service. \u2018\
    It quite altered his career\u2019, says Tupper, \u2018and, soon afterwards, he\
    \ took Holy Orders\u2019.\u201D\nHorace Wyndham, Mr Sludge, The Medium\_: Being\
