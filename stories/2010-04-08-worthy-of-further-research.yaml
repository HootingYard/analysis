  text: '"I not only investigated the so-called supernatural powers of the child known
    as the Infant Magnet, but, on a public stage, during the performance of certain
    mysterious phenomena by a young lady who shall be nameless, I consented to be
    locked up in a dark cabinet with that interesting maiden, whose toilette was superb."
