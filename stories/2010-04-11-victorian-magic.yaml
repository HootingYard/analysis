  text: "\u201CHis native land conquered, he had renamed himself the Great Wizard\
    \ of the North and headed south to London. John Henry [Anderson]'s magical repertoire\
    \ had grown accordingly, featuring egg-writing and an incomprehensible guinea\
    \ pig trick, and he started something of a trend when he had become the first\
    \ magician to pull a rabbit out of a hat\u2026 An unprecedented approach to advertising\
    \ had seen whole towns papered with playbills announcing the most extraordinary\
    \ sounding illusions, such as the \u2018Grand Metamorphesian Wonder\u2019 or the\
    \ \u2018Phoenixestocalobian\u2019\u2026 \_His tricks might be standard, but the\
    \ language of his posters promised something quite unique: \u2018A Grand Ambidexterological\
    \ Illusion with 12 Handkerchiefs, into which will be introduced the Enchanted\
    \ Loaf and Learned Bottle, the Animated Orange and the Invisible Pigeon\u2019\
    . Not that anyone had the slightest idea what that was supposed to mean, any more\
    \ than they would have recognised a Phoenixestocalobian, but that was just the\
    \ point.\u201D\nPeter Lamont, The First Psychic\_: The Peculiar Mystery Of A Notorious\
    \ Victorian Wizard (2005) (The book is a biography of D D Home, but includes this\
    \ splendid stuff about Anderson.)\n\nJohn Henry Anderson with his invisible pigeon"
