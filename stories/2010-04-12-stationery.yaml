  text: '"out of insecurity and boredom I developed an elaborate form of displacement
    activity, a self-estranging technique, creating what I called ''angel trap stationery''
    -- paper painted with symbols and impregnated with scents designed to attract
    various powers and dominions of the air to aid me in the act of composition."
