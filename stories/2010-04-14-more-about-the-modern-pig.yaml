  text: "I'm so happy, I'm dancing a jig. Why am I happy? Because I rented a pig.\
    \ It's a highly intelligent, modern pig. Hey, daddy-o, it flips my wig.\nWhen\
    \ you hire a pig on a rental scheme, it can be like a pig in an opiate dream\u2014\
    the kind of pig S T Coleridge'd invent, or De Quincey, perhaps, if he could afford\
    \ the rent.\nFor a rented pig does not come cheap. It costs a tremendous amount\
    \ to keep. There's the sty and the swill and the brain scans to pay, and bales\
    \ of straw and bales of hay.\nBut a modern intelligent pig is a treasure, a joy\
    \ and a boon quite beyond measure. A pig is a must. A pig is the top. Rent one,\
    \ as I did, from a pig hire shop!"
