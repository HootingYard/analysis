  text: 'Those of you familiar with the important Hooting Yard Book o'' Days will
    know that precisely six years ago today, the very first episode of Hooting Yard
    On The Air was broadcast on ResonanceFM. I will be celebrating by drinking a flask
    of aerated lettucewater and sacrificing a (vegan, marzipan) goat.

    Once upon a time, of course, radio shows were fugitive, ephemeral things, but
    today, with the wonders of podcasting, untold hours of Mr Key''s babbling remain
    available for you to download from the ResonanceFM archive. Apparently, thousands
    of people do, certainly more than ever read this blog.

    This seems as good a time as any, then, to note that a new podcast maestro has
    taken over the reins, whose self-appointed task is to increase the frequency of
    releases. Past programmes have been issued as podcasts generally about once a
    fortnight, but the plan now is for them to appear twice a week, until the backlog
    is cleared.

    For an insight into the tremendous technical challenges of the process, I refer
    you to this piece from the 2006 archives. Little has changed, save perhaps for
    the metal from which the maestro''s hat has been welded.

    My thanks are due to the podcast maestro and his predecessors, and you can make
    their dedication to this noble cause worthwhile by subscribing, downloading, and
    listening, for so long and so often that Mr Key''s voice haunts your dreams. And
    please remember that the very existence of ResonanceFM is a fragile and rickety
    thing, and your donations to the station will help it to survive.'
