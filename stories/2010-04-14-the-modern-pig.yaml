  text: '"This is accomplished by inserting the pig into a ''pig launcher''... push
    it along down the pipe until it reaches the receiving trap--the ''pig catcher''...
    there are "smart pigs" used to measure things... though some product can be lost
    when the pig is extracted... All systems must allow for the receipt of pigs at
    the launcher... pigs must be removed, as many pigs are rented... the pig can be
    ejected from the barrel and operators have been severely injured when standing
    in front of an open pig door... the pig is shuttled up and down... Modern intelligent
    pigs are highly sophisticated... Some smart pigs can combine technologies... the
    pig is unable to directly communicate with the outside world... It is therefore
    necessary that the pig use internal means to record its own movement during the
    trip... The original pigs were made from straw wrapped in wire... There are several
    types of pigs for cleaning... A pig has been used as a plot device in [the] James
    Bond film Diamonds Are Forever, where Bond disabled a pig... A pig was also used
    as a plot device in the Tony Hillerman book The Sinister Pig."

    My thanks to Duncsnoai Plover for drawing to my attention this exciting stuff
    about modern pigs (many of which are rented).'
