  text: 'As we have learned, from time to time the so-called "real world" catches
    up with Hooting Yard in quite charming ways. And what could be more charming,
    and more like something I made up, than the chance to adopt a lobster? I have
    to say I am extremely impressed that the National Lobster Hatchery, which offers
    this splendid opportunity, insists that the first stage of the process is to Name
    Your Lobster. Thus is the act of naming given its proper, paramount importance.

    These conscientious lobsterists at the Hatchery have gone to the trouble of listing
    all their thousands of adopted lobsters, at the point where they are released
    into the wild, and so will your adopted lobster appear on the website when its
    turn comes. Note my assumption that you will be adopting a lobster as soon as
    you have finished reading this. Do not let me down.

    While I do not wish to dictate in so important a matter as lobster nomenclature,
    I cannot help thinking that it would be a fine thing indeed if the waters around
    Padstow were to have clacking about in them lobsters named after your favourite
    Hooting Yard characters, such as Dobson, Tiny Enid, Old Halob, Dennis Beerpint,
    Little Severin The Mystic (Badger) Lobster, and the rest. Go on, you know it makes
    sense.

    Please leave a note in the comments when you have named and adopted your lobster.
