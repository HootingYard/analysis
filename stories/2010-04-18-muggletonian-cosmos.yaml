  text: 'The giant ball of the earth. Above, day, and a tiny sun. Below, night, and
    stars, and the moon. Beyond the outer circle, nothing, nothing at all. "System
    According To The Holy Scriptures". This is the Muggletonian Cosmos, as depicted
    in the nineteenth century by Isaac Frost.


    A big zoomable image can be found here, and another of Isaac Frost''s Muggletonian
    engravings is here. Many thanks to Ed Baxter for drawing them to my attention.'
