  text: 'In considering this subject with the attention that is due to it, it has
    appeared to me that all the stories of ghosts and super, or, un-natural appearances,
    may be referred to some of the following causes:

    1. To the augmentation produced by fear in any effect on the senses--thus the
    ear of a terrified man will convert the smallest noise into the report of thunder,
    or his eye will change the stump of a tree into a monster twenty feet high. As
    the senses are furnished for protection, their irritability, under the impression
    of fear, is part of their economy, as the means of preserving our being; but it
    is absurd to refer back the effects thus augmented, to external causes which might
    be capable of producing the augmentation. To such an error of the senses and of
    reasoning, is, however, to be referred half the ghosts and supernaturals of which
    we hear in village ale-houses, in nurseries and schools.

    2. To diseased organs of sensation; as an inflamed eye producing the effect of
    flashes of light in the dark, or fulness of blood producing a ringing or singing
    in the ears. Sometimes diseases of the visual organs are accompanied by hallucinations
    of mind; and persons ill in fevers often see successions of figures and objects
    flit before their eyes till the disease has been removed. The workings of conscience
    or nervous affections will also produce diseases of the senses, and such hallucinations
    of mind as to occasion a person to fancy he sees another, or to be haunted by
    him. But there is nothing supernatural in all this; it is sometimes a local disease,
    sometimes an effect of fever, sometimes a nervous affection, and sometimes partial
    insanity.

    3. To natural causes not understood by the parties. Thus, anciently the northern
    lights were mistaken for armies fighting; meteors and comets for flaming swords,
    portending destruction or pestilence; the electrified points of swords to the
    favour of heaven; the motions of the  planets to attractive effluvia; and all
    the effects of the comixture of the gases to benign or diabolical agency, as they
    happened to produce on the parties good or evil. So in the like manner old houses
    are generally said to be haunted, owing to the noises which arise from the cracking
    and yielding of their walls and timbers, and from the protection and easy passage
    which in the course of time they afford to rats, mice, weasels, &c. whose activity
    in the night-time affords the foundation of numerous apprehensions and fancies
    of the credulous.

    4. To spontaneous combustions or detonations, which produce occasional lights
    and noises, or, under unchanged circumstances, recurring lights and noises, chiefly
    claiming attention in the night. Thus houses shut up and unaired are apt, from
    the putrefaction of animal and vegetable matter, to generate hydrogen gas, the
    accidental combustion of which by contact with phosphoric matter, naturally generated
    in the same situation, will produce those effects of lights and noises heard in  empty
    houses. So Church-yards, Churches in which the dead are buried, Cemeteries, and
    Ruins of old buildings, must frequently give out large quantities of these gases;
    and consequently, from exactly similar causes, they are likely to produce the
    very effects which we witness in the will-o''-the-wisp, or in hydrogen gas when
    inflamed during calm weather in marshy situations.

    5. To the prevailing belief that effects, which cannot readily be accounted for,
    or which are caused by the contact of the invisible fluids or media always in
    action in the great laboratory of nature, are produced by the agency of spirits
    or demons; which belief, concurring with the unknown causes of the effects, and
    affording a ready solution of difficulties, prevents further inquiry, silences
    reasoning, and tends in consequence to sustain the prevailing errors and superstitions.

    Such are the general causes of ghosts, spirits, charms, miracles, and supernatural
    appearances. They all arise either from hallucinations of the mind or senses;  from
    the mutual action of the natural, though invisible, powers of gaseous and ethereal
    fluids; from the delusions of ignorance, implicit faith, or the absence of all
    reasoning.
