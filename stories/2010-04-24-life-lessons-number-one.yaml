  text: "I think it is time for Hooting Yard to provide readers with life-lessons,\
    \ some simple rules of conduct for prancing through a complicated world with elegance\
    \ and brio. Mr Key is, of course, far too ignorant to be able to cobble together\
    \ any such rules himself, so he will rely on the tried and tested wisdom of others.\
    \ And to begin with, we have this unarguable rule to live by:\nNever, ever question\
    \ Higgins\u2019 safety nous.\nMake of that what you will, but bear in mind the\
    \ awful fate of the last person who dared to question Higgins\u2019 safety nous.\
    \ Thereby hangs a tale to curdle the stomach and derange the collywobbles."
