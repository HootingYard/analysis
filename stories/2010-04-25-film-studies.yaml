  text: "From his exile in a pompous land, reader Mike Jennings very kindly alerts\
    \ me to a newly published film studies textbook from the University of \xDClm:\n\
    \nThe title translates as Oi Mate! Are You Looking For A Punch In The Face?\_\
    : Horst Gack and the Cinema of Belligerence. The first study dedicated to the\
    \ visionary director of \u201CGoats and Ogres: A Film from the Hillsides\u201D\
    , \u201CRevenge of the Pig\u201D and \u201CThe Fatal Duckpond\u201D. This thumping\
    \ tome collects together essays by some of the most incisive and rigorous minds\
    \ of Teutonic academia. Unfortunately all the contributors have chosen to remain\
    \ anonymous following reports that Horst Gack's mysterious wife and collaboratrix\
    \ Primrose Dent is \u201Cnot best pleased\u201D with the book. We know not why,\
    \ but then she is an international woman of mystery, so her motivations and manias\
    \ are forever hidden from the public gaze.\nWhat is most startling about the book\
    \ is that it completely avoids the sort of obfuscatory postmodernist verbal diarrhoea\
    \ that besmirches so many academic texts these days. The formidable German intellects\
    \ who have turned their brainpower towards the films of Horst Gack do so in prose\
    \ so plain and simple it can be understood by tiny tots. This passage, from an\
    \ essay entitled \u201CThe Use Of Smudged Camera Lenses In Revenge Of The Pig\u201C\
    , is typical. It was translated for Hooting Yard by our old pal Fatima Gilliblat:\n\
    \u201CSee the pig. See the pig in black and white. See the pig blurred. See the\
    \ pig go from the sty to the barn. See the clouds louring. See the rain falling.\
    \ Hear Horst Gack cry \u201CCut!\u201D Hear Primrose Dent cry \u201CNo, don't\
    \ cut yet!\u201D Hear a kerfuffle. See the camera fall off its tripod. Hear imprecations\
    \ and threats. See Horst Gack stomp off to lock himself in his trailer. See the\
    \ pig emerge from the barn and roll in the muck. See Primrose Dent channelling\
    \ the spirit of Leni Riefenstahl. See the rain continue to pour down relentlessly\
    \ until darkness falls.\u201D"
