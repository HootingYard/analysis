  text: 'Here is an important auction announcement. This coming weekend, May the first
    and second, sees ResonanceFM''s fundraising marathon. From noon to midnight on
    Saturday and Sunday a series of guests will be trooping into the studios offering
    delectable items to be snapped up in live auctions.

    Mr Key will be on air between 1.30 and 2.00 PM on Sunday, eliciting bids for a
    pair of uberrarities, the books Derek The Dust Particle and Bring Me The Head
    Of Derek The Dust Particle!, written by Perry Natal and illustrated by Frank Key,
    published two decades ago by Indelible Inc.

    So turn on, tune in, drop what you''re doing, and bid as if your life depends
    on it. Resonance needs you, almost as much as you need Resonance.'
