    \n\u201CCan we not all remember the time when, on first taking to heart Milton,\
    \ and afterwards Akenside,\u2014(before knowing anything of Dante,) we conceived\
    \ the grandest moment of possible existence to be that of a Seraph, poised on\
    \ balanced wings, watching the bringing out of a world from chaos, its completion\
    \ in fitness, beauty and radiance, and its first motion in its orbit, when sent\
    \ forth by the creative hand on its everlasting way?\u201D\nHarriet Martineau,\
