  text: 'I am fairly sure the answer to this question is a resounding "Yes!"

    "Can we not all remember the time when, on first taking to heart Milton, and afterwards
    Akenside,--(before knowing anything of Dante,) we conceived the grandest moment
    of possible existence to be that of a Seraph, poised on balanced wings, watching
    the bringing out of a world from chaos, its completion in fitness, beauty and
    radiance, and its first motion in its orbit, when sent forth by the creative hand
    on its everlasting way?"
