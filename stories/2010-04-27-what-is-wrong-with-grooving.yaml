  text: 'It''s been a while since we paid a visit to the groovelab, high in the Swiss
    Alps, where tireless boffins attempt to isolate the essential core of Hooting
    Yard''s grooviness. But we may have to pack our pippy bags and hike over there
    again, for it appears that objections have been raised to the very practice of
    grooving itself. Our dulcet-voiced South African correspondent Letta Mbulu has
    found herself leaping to the defence of all things groovy by asking, in the form
    of song, the cogent question What is wrong with grooving? Actually, Ms Mbulu asks
    what is wrong with groovin'', but I fear we ought not encourage her use of apocopation,
    otherwise we start getting into Hootin'' Yard territory, at which point civilisation
    begins to crumble.

    I pause here briefly to note that Ms Mbulu''s name is an anagram of Umlaut Belt
    (or Belt), which is, as we know, the name given to a far, far distant string of
    glittering stars and planets somewhere in this or another galaxy, dubbed as such
    by a fearsome Teutonic astronomer great of beard and brain alike. His own name,
    alas, I cannot quite recall. It is not even on the tip of my tongue. It is as
    if it has been utterly expunged from my memory, possibly by a bash on the bonce
    received when negotiating an Alp in Germany, on my way to Switzerland, there to
    visit the groovelab boffins.

    I had my pippy bag and my hiking apparel, and I had a handful of feed for any
    goats that might cross my path as I wended my way. The sky was blue, and I thought
    of Ruskin. Well, in truth I thought of both Ruskin and Letta Mbulu. I wondered,
    as I often have, if Ruskin would have got down with the Hooting Yard groove, had
    he been born in a different era. We tend not to associate Ruskin with grooviness
    of any kidney, but that is a mistake, I think. It has not escaped my notice that
    his very name suggests a Mbuluesque apocopation. What is wrong with Ruskin''?,
    indeed.

    Had I had my portable metal tapping machine upon my person upon that Alp, I may
    well have pranged a message to Ms Mbulu, insisting that she make a new recording
    of her song substituting Ruskin'' for groovin''. Not that this would have gone
    down too well with the boffins in the groovelab, who I know consider Ms Mbulu
    their staunch champion and her song their anthem. When your working day consists
    of exhausting hours of experimental groovy research, it must be a terrific dampener
    to learn that some are calling into question the practice of grooviness itself,
    its tenets and ethics and its jib-cut. I was keen to speak with the boffins, to
    see how they were bearing up, to spread some pep. Though I am often of lugubrious
    mien, I am not averse to dispersing pep where and when I can, particularly among
    boffins confined to their fastness in the Swiss Alps. I had gifts for them, too.
    Stuffed into my pippy bag were samizdat copies of some of the more inspiring letters
    from Ruskin''s Fors Clavigera.

    So there I was, toiling up an Alpine slope, on the lookout for goats, thinking
    about Ruskin and Letta Mbulu, and nary a thought in my head regarding the beardy
    brainy Teutonic astronomer who had named the Umlaut Belt. Perhaps had it been
    night rather than day, had the broad sweep of the heavenly firmament glittered
    in darkness above me, rather than the bronze and battering sun, I might have thought
    about stars and planets and astronomers old and new, Teutonic and otherwise, and
    that name I cannot now remember would have come to me. Around it, I could have
    framed a piece of anecdotage to beguile the boffins over lunchtime sandwiches
    in their canteen chalet. I would draw together their singing heroine Letta Mbulu
    with the stars in a distant galaxy, somehow work in Mr Ruskin, and then, la!,
    flip from my pippy bag the copies of Fors Clavigera to boost their pep. Alas,
    it was not to be.

    As I have indicated, I was well prepared should I meet with any goats who crossed
    my path. I had handfuls of goat feed, chiefly nettles and genetically modified
    sultanas and bran flakes, with which to assuage them. What had not occurred to
    me was that, being Alpine goats, they would be clumping about above the path,
    and, in a frisky moment, dislodge a rock or two, which, rolling unstoppably down
    the slope, would land upon my bonce, and knock me out.

    It was night when I came to. Above me, the mighty firmament, the stars in their
    courses glittering against a cloudless black expanse. Out there, somewhere, possibly
    visible if I had a powerful telescope, was the Umlaut Belt. What was it Dobson
    had written? Of all the belts in all the galaxies, the Umlaut Belt can lay claim
    to being the grooviest belt imaginable. I wondered if the boffins in the groovelab
    knew that. Try as I might, I could not remember the name of that long dead Teutonic
    astronomer. I got to my feet. Strewn on the path, I saw the untouched goat feed.
    Alongside it, my open pippy bag, and the few remaining shreds of my copies of
    Ruskin''s Fors Clavigera, chewed up and munched by the Alpine goats which, like
    the rocks that had bedizened me, had descended from the slopes. The goats were
    gone now, and my boffin-gift was gone too. I could hardly present them with the
    sorry tatters which, in any case, a mountain wind would soon disperse into the
    night. To arrive at the groovelab without a gift to pep the boffins would be unforgivably
    ungroovy. Sadly, I turned around, and began the long hike back to my homeland.
    I was in no mood for grooving. Perhaps I never would be, ever again.'
