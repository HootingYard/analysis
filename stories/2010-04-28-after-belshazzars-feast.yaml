  text: "Returning from Belshazzar's feast, Agnetha and Benny grew increasingly despondent,\
    \ and by the time they reached the hotel both of them were staggering under the\
    \ oppressive weight of grim Scandinavian misery.\n\u201CIf Fernando were here,\u201D\
    \ groaned Benny, \u201CHe would brighten things up. He could draw sunbeams from\
    \ a cucumber.\u201D\n\u201CYou forget that Fernando is but a fictional character\
    \ in a songlet, Benny,\u201D snapped Agnetha. Tears were rolling down her cheeks.\n\
    \u201COh,\u201D said Benny, staring out of the hotel window. He saw Anni-Frid\
    \ flit past, like a phantom. Agnetha was beating her fists upon a piece of pine\
    \ furniture.\n\u201CAt least here there is no mysterious writing upon the wall,\
    \ as there was at the feast,\u201D added Benny, trying to open a crack in the\
    \ gloom.\nAll of a sudden Bj\xF6rn came striding manfully into the hotel lobby.\
    \ His hair and beard and face and clothing were blackened from the charcoal he\
    \ had been burning.\n\u201CI am looking for Anni-Frid,\u201D he said, \u201CHave\
    \ you seen her?\u201D\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Benny, lying through his teeth. But\
    \ had he really seen her? Or were his eyes playing tricks on him again, as they\
    \ had in Uppsala?\n\u201CCheck the abandoned cow byre,\u201D said Agnetha, \u201C\
    She went there earlier to clean her rifle.\u201D\n\u201CSince many years I haven't\
    \ seen a rifle in her hand,\u201D said Bj\xF6rn. He dashed outside into the mist\
    \ that engulfed the hotel grounds.\nAgnetha and Benny slumped in the lobby armchairs,\
    \ expecting to hear a rifle shot in the distance. But none came. The only sound\
    \ was the whirring of the fan above their heads and, outside, the strange cries\
    \ of such Scandinavian birds as had not flown south for the winter.\n\u201CAnyway,\
    \ how would Fernando draw sunbeams from a cucumber?\u201D asked Agnetha, eventually.\n\
    But Benny had fallen asleep, lost in dreams of Belshazzar."
