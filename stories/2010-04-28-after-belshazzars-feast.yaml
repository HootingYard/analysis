  text: 'Returning from Belshazzar''s feast, Agnetha and Benny grew increasingly despondent,
    and by the time they reached the hotel both of them were staggering under the
    oppressive weight of grim Scandinavian misery.

    "If Fernando were here," groaned Benny, "He would brighten things up. He could
    draw sunbeams from a cucumber."

    "You forget that Fernando is but a fictional character in a songlet, Benny," snapped
    Agnetha. Tears were rolling down her cheeks.

    "Oh," said Benny, staring out of the hotel window. He saw Anni-Frid flit past,
    like a phantom. Agnetha was beating her fists upon a piece of pine furniture.

    "At least here there is no mysterious writing upon the wall, as there was at the
    feast," added Benny, trying to open a crack in the gloom.

    All of a sudden Bjorn came striding manfully into the hotel lobby. His hair and
    beard and face and clothing were blackened from the charcoal he had been burning.

    "I am looking for Anni-Frid," he said, "Have you seen her?"

    "No," said Benny, lying through his teeth. But had he really seen her? Or were
    his eyes playing tricks on him again, as they had in Uppsala?

    "Check the abandoned cow byre," said Agnetha, "She went there earlier to clean
    her rifle."

    "Since many years I haven''t seen a rifle in her hand," said Bjorn. He dashed
    outside into the mist that engulfed the hotel grounds.

    Agnetha and Benny slumped in the lobby armchairs, expecting to hear a rifle shot
    in the distance. But none came. The only sound was the whirring of the fan above
    their heads and, outside, the strange cries of such Scandinavian birds as had
    not flown south for the winter.

    "Anyway, how would Fernando draw sunbeams from a cucumber?" asked Agnetha, eventually.

    But Benny had fallen asleep, lost in dreams of Belshazzar.'
