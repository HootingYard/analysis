  text: 'A letter arrives from Peter Christian:

    Dear Frank, he writes, Have you been moonlighting over at the Dictionary of National
    Biography, or have they been somehow stealing your unpublished works? The following
    DNB entry is a blatant fiction, and its Hooting Yard origins manifest, I would
    say:

    "Cowley, Sir John Guise (1905-1993), army officer, was born at Mussooree, in the
    foothills of the Himalayas, during an earthquake on 20 August 1905, the son of
    the Revd Henry Guise Beatson Cowley, army chaplain, and his wife, Ethel Florence
    (nee Prowse). When the family returned to England by ship John won a contest for
    the ugliest baby on board. His early years were spent in a Dorset village, where
    his father was the rector and Thomas Hardy was a neighbour. He recalled Hardy
    as a sad, wizened old man who spoke seldom but who occasionally, though an atheist,
    attended church services, at which he always asked Cowley''s father to read the
    same passage from the Bible--Elijah''s vision of the earthquake."'
