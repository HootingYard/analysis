  text: 'On yesterday''s radio show I played the Hooting Yard Chant, in a simple version
    for two voices. It has now been given an audio going-over by Outa_Spaceman, and
    sounds quite formidable. Put it on repeat and use it as the soundtrack to your
    day.

    Hooting Yard! Hooting Yard! Ha-ha and gazebo! We will vanquish all our foes! Where
    have all the flowers gone? Hooting! Hooting Yard!

    Chant'
