  text: "Reading an item in yesterday's Guardian about tiny lethal phantasmal poison\
    \ frogs, I was reminded of Dobson's pamphlet My Terrifying Encounter With A Tiny\
    \ Lethal Phantasmal Poison Frog (out of print). It is by any measure one of his\
    \ most exciting works, guaranteed to have one panting for breath and to cause\
    \ beads of sweat to break out upon the brow. This is due to the pamphleteer deploying,\
    \ as he so rarely did, his remarkable ability for building suspense. Alerted by\
    \ the title, we are in a state of heightened expectation for the appearance of\
    \ the minuscule killer, so tiny yet so toxic. But Dobson is in no hurry to come\
    \ face to face with the lethal frog.\nHe begins by recounting, in exasperating\
    \ detail, how, in preparing for a morning trudge along the towpath of the old\
    \ canal, he discovered that the aglets on his Batavian Crimebusters\u2019 boots\
    \ had become rusted and brittle, the bootlaces fraying as a result. Reluctant\
    \ to don a different pair of boots\u2014for reasons he enumerates over five pages\u2014\
    Dobson describes his search, in drawers and cupboards and hideyholes, for a replacement\
    \ pair of bootlaces. Throughout this \u201Cdesperate fossicking\u201D, as he calls\
    \ it, Marigold Chew is staring out of the window at the incessant rainfall, picking\
    \ out a tune on her celeste, composing in her head the words of the song that\
    \ would later be known as The Ballad Of Incessant Rainfall.\nIn his monograph\
    \ on Dobson's various items of footwear, Aloysius Nestingbird asks why the pamphleteer\
    \ did not simply remove the laces from one of his other pairs of boots and reuse\
    \ them when it became obvious that he had no pristine bootlaces to hand. He answers\
    \ his own question by delving into Dobson's infamous pamphlet Every Lace Has Its\
    \ Own Boot (out of print), the work which plumbed in excruciating detail the unfathomable\
    \ depth of the pamphleteer's neurosis in these matters. Those of us who have read\
    \ our Nestingbird will have his commentary in the back of our minds as we follow\
    \ Dobson crashing about the house on his futile search. Twenty pages in, we are\
    \ no closer to our own encounter with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog,\
    \ but the tension is becoming unbearable. At the point where Dobson describes\
    \ tipping out onto the floor the contents of a battered cardboard box kept under\
    \ the kitchen sink, we are ready to put the pamphlet aside and to put the kettle\
    \ on for a calming cup of tea.\nNext, we take a nap, and when we return to the\
    \ pamphlet we find that is what Dobson did too. Giving up hope of finding new\
    \ bootlaces for his Batavian Crimebusters\u2019 boots, and leaving Marigold Chew\
    \ plinking and musing and staring out of the window, the pamphleteer retires to\
    \ his nap-hub. Now he cranks up the suspense by treating the reader to a detailed\
    \ account of his period of unconsciousness, accompanied by masterly, if somewhat\
    \ florid, descriptions of his pillows, his coverlet, and his mattress. Nestingbird\
    \ has remarked that \u201Cno one has ever written about the nap as brilliantly\
    \ as Dobson. The only wonder is that he never devoted an entire pamphlet to the\
    \ subject.\u201D This is uncharacteristically careless of Nestingbird, who has\
    \ overlooked the mid-period pamphlet Fifty Pages Of Prose About Daytime Naps In\
    \ Theory And Practice (out of print). It is an inexplicable lapse on the part\
    \ of the greatest of Dobsonists, one I am minded to attribute to his habit, in\
    \ later years, of mulch \u2018n\u2019 mop cloth bish bosh flossy flapping.\nAnd\
    \ so we are put on tenterhooks, still awaiting the terrifying encounter with the\
    \ tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog, wondering if perhaps when Dobson wakes from\
    \ his nap it will be to find the diminutive assassin perched within his bouffant.\
    \ But no. He wakes, he grunts, he stumbles to his escritoire and begins scribbling.\
    \ What we now come upon is not the fatal frog, but one of the central mysteries\
    \ of Dobsonist scholarship. This is what the pamphleteer tells us:\nI woke, I\
    \ grunted, I stumbled to my escritoire, and thereupon scribbled ten pages of mighty\
    \ prose, putting the finishing touches to my pamphlet Six More Lectures On Fruit.\n\
    The puzzle is that no such pamphlet exists. Given the importance within the canon\
    \ of the original Six Lectures On Fruit (out of print), it seems barely credible\
    \ that Dobson could have completed a sequel only to destroy it so utterly that\
    \ not a trace remains. As Nestingbird has demonstrated, though the pamphleteer\
    \ wrote innumerable fragments and scraps and unfinished doo-dahs, whenever he\
    \ considered a work complete he invariably published it, including the stuff that\
    \ can only be described as bollocks. That is Nestingbird's word, not mine. There\
    \ is no other reference, anywhere, to this pamphlet, and in fact Marigold Chew,\
    \ in a late interview, directly denied its existence. \u201CEverything Dobson\
    \ had to say about fruit,\u201D she said, into a tape recorder, \u201Cis contained\
    \ in the Six Lectures. The very idea that any further essays could have been wrung\
    \ out of his brain is preposterous. He simply didn't know enough about fruit.\u201D\
    \ As with all of Marigold Chew's tape-recorded pronouncements, this has the ring\
    \ of truth, and it is backed up by the remarks of the Pointy Town fruiterer Sigismundo\
    \ Figorplumtree, who recalled that Dobson used to stand in front of his market\
    \ stall fruit display scratching his head and wearing an entirely vacant expression\
    \ for hours upon end on many a market day morning. As if that were not evidence\
    \ enough, we have the famous incident when the pamphleteer took part in a charity\
    \ fruit quiz on the radio and failed to answer a single question correctly.\n\
    My own theory about this perplexing mystery is that Dobson is deliberately pulling\
    \ the wool over our eyes. By claiming to have written a pamphlet for which no\
    \ credible evidence exists, he guesses, rightly, that our bafflement will be sufficient\
    \ to make us forget all about the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog, at least\
    \ temporarily, so causing us greater terror and alarm when he reminds us about\
    \ it a few pages later. It is an inspired display of narrative fireworks. Here\
    \ is how he makes our hearts thump:\nHaving pocked the final full stop on my majestic\
    \ fruit sequel, I decided to go a-trudging along the canal towpath in the incessant\
    \ downpour after all. I determined to wear my Latvian Civic Cavalry boots instead\
    \ of the Batavian Crimebusters\u2019 boots, for the laces in the former were,\
    \ I knew, in tip top condition. Earlier in the week I had run them through a pneumatic\
    \ bootlace testing contraption hired from Hubermann's. It was worth every penny,\
    \ though when the time came to return the machine to that most gorgeous of department\
    \ stores I admit I shed a few tears. As I trundled it along the lane atop my cart,\
    \ I wondered if I would ever be able to afford to buy one of my own. Then all\
    \ my bootlace problems would vanish in the ether! Perhaps, I thought, as I rounded\
    \ the sordid duckpond, if I could write a pamphlet that would outsell a Pebblehead\
    \ paperback, I might\u2014oh, hang on, I am forgetting myself. You will want to\
    \ know about my terrifying encounter with a tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog.\n\
    Aloysius Nestingbird rightly numbers this as among the top one hundred paragraphs\
    \ ever committed to paper by the out of print pamphleteer. Yet even after this,\
    \ Dobson continues to twist the knife. It seems the suspense could not be brought\
    \ to a higher pitch, but it is. I have read the pamphlet a thousand times, studied\
    \ it, subjected the text to the most abstruse critical scrutiny, and even discussed\
    \ it with frightening Continental literary critics, all hornrimmed spectacles\
    \ and atrocious beards and Gitanes and arrogant hand gestures, but still I cannot\
    \ work out how he does it. No sooner has he reminded us of the tiny toxic Epipodobate\
    \ with which he is destined to come terrifyingly face to face than he postpones\
    \ the awful moment by spending dozens of pages wittering on about other types\
    \ of poison dart frog, frogs in general, toads, green things, things with legs,\
    \ tiny beings, poisonous beings, radiant beings, Ecuadorian and Andean life-forms,\
    \ and\u2014weirdly\u2014the Flemish painter Dirk Bouts. Now we are unable to let\
    \ the imminent encounter slip from our minds. There is no relief from the tension.\
    \ (Dobson's ability to shoehorn Bouts into his frog nightmare is sheer genius.)\
    \ If the reader manages to get through all this without swooning or just dropping\
    \ dead, it is a capital idea to toss the pamphlet aside and put the kettle back\
    \ on, or, if there is a dog in the vicinity, to take it for a walk, and let it\
    \ off its leash, when one reaches an expanse of greensward, and throw a stick\
    \ for it to fetch, repeatedly, and then perhaps to head to a pond, and take from\
    \ one's pocket the paper bag of stale breadcrusts one has brought with one, and\
    \ chuck the crusts one by one into the pond as nutriment for ducks, if there are\
    \ ducks in the pond, or swans, if there are swans, and unleash the dog again and\
    \ allow it to leap friskily into the pond for a swim, if the bye-laws permit the\
    \ swimming of dogs in the pond, then on the way home pop in to the orphanage to\
    \ distribute alms, and perhaps leave the dog there, to serve as the orphans\u2019\
    \ pet, unless the orphanage is in a designated risk o\u2019 rabies zone, in which\
    \ case Skippy, or Praxis, or whatever the dog is called, will have to be returned\
    \ to wherever it was one gathered it, from outside the post office perhaps, or\
    \ the dog pound, and then as one skips lightly along the path towards one's door,\
    \ becalmed, becalmed, one will be both physically and mentally prepared to face\
    \ the final hideous revelation of the Dobson pamphlet, the encounter, so long\
    \ threatened, with the tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog of the title, so, once\
    \ safely back in the parlour, thirst quenched by that nice cup of tea, one can\
    \ fling oneself into one's armchair, \xE0 la Nayland Smith in the Fu Manchu books\
    \ of Sax Rohmer, and in hands no longer shaking with fear, pick up the pamphlet,\
    \ and read\u2026\nAnd then, as I crept from the wreckage of the aeroplane onto\
    \ an Andean slope, so incredibly high above sea level, out of the corner of my\
    \ eye I saw something. It was tiny. It was lethal. It was phantasmal. It was poisonous.\
    \ It was a tiny lethal phantasmal poison frog! I was transfixed with terror. My\
    \ whole body stiffened, as if I were a piece of timber. The slopes of the Andes\
    \ are steep, so immediately I began to roll downhill, just as a piece of timber\
    \ would.. As I rolled, so the distance grew between me and the tiny lethal phantasmal\
    \ poison frog, until I could no longer see it. By the time I came to rest at the\
    \ foot of that Andean slope, I was no longer paralysed with fear. The tiny lethal\
    \ phantasmal poison frog was far, far above me now, in the thin air, and it was\
    \ so tiny I calculated that even hopping as frantically as it could, I would be\
    \ long gone before it reached sea level. I stood up, in Ecuador, and walked away\
    \ from the mountain, delivered from peril, sound of limb, numb of brain, writer\
    \ of pamphlets."
