  text: "This, from Ptak Science Books, is simply magnificent:\n\nM Maid Fainting\n\
    For the millions of Americans who were newly affluent in 1925 but not affluent\
    \ enough to afford a fainting maid that they could attend to came the Maid Fainting\
    \ Society Inc of America.\_ Bonded in 15 states, MFSA sponsored overseas maids\
    \ to faint in good American homes.\_ They were hired out at $4/hour (a handsome\
    \ hourly sum in 1925), the fainting maids being allowed to keep half.\_ In 1926\
    \ a sub-cult of Extra-Tall Fainting Maids was born (an example of which is pictured\
    \ above), and provided an income to thousands for several years.\_ (One of the\
    \ last silent films ever made, Fainting Maid Maiden, with Clara Bow, 1944, used\
    \ this phenomenon as a basis for its story; by that time however the craze had\
    \ passed, the war was on, and no one cared any more for silent films about fainting\
    \ maids.)"
