    M Maid Fainting

    For the millions of Americans who were newly affluent in 1925 but not affluent
    enough to afford a fainting maid that they could attend to came the Maid Fainting
    Society Inc of America.  Bonded in 15 states, MFSA sponsored overseas maids to
    faint in good American homes.  They were hired out at $4/hour (a handsome hourly
    sum in 1925), the fainting maids being allowed to keep half.  In 1926 a sub-cult
    of Extra-Tall Fainting Maids was born (an example of which is pictured above),
    and provided an income to thousands for several years.  (One of the last silent
    films ever made, Fainting Maid Maiden, with Clara Bow, 1944, used this phenomenon
    as a basis for its story; by that time however the craze had passed, the war was
    on, and no one cared any more for silent films about fainting maids.)'
