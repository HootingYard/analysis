  text: Make sure you tune in to Resonance today, between noon and midnight, for the
    second half of the Fundraiser Weekend Marathon. Mr Key will be on air from 1.30
    to 2.00 PM announcing the auction of Derek The Dust Particle, Bring Me The Head
    Of Derek The Dust Particle!, and a complete set of Massacre, issues one to five
    of the anthologies published in the 1990s. I think bidding for items, by telephone,
    email, or metal tapping machine, continues until midnight, but all will become
    clear if you listen carefully.
