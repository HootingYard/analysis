  text: 'A letter arrives from a werewolf. It is rather difficult to read, as the
    notepaper on which it has been written is soaked in blood and vestiges of entrail,
    but I have done my best to decipher and transcribe it:

    Dear Mr Key : As a werewolf, I feel I must take issue with your assertion that
    Dobson was wrong about me and my kind. I realise you were just echoing the witterings
    of young Ted Cack, but you have not subjected them to proper critical scrutiny
    and appear to believe every word of his tiresome book. Oh, and it may well be
    "densely argued", in the sense that we use "dense" as a synonym for "thick", "stupid",
    or "brain-fuddled", but to describe his prose as "pretty" is preposterous. The
    Cack book clunks along like some sort of leaden clockwork robot brimful of elephant
    tranquiliser. Do not start arguing with me that my analogy is flawed, in that
    a chemical tranquiliser would have no effect upon a robot''s mechanics, for I
    have actually stuffed the innards of a robot with mind-numbing powders from sachets,
    so I know whereof I write. The robot''s progress, clunking along the lane towards
    the lab, was just like Ted Cack''s prose, in terms of its apprehension by the
    average werewolf. Not that I consider myself average, by the way. I am just making
    a point. I inhabit a sphere far above and beyond the average werewolf. I am fantastic
    and magnificent, as you would know had you ever seen me in my sphere.

    It is in fact that sphere that I am writing to you about, for it is located on
    the island o'' werewolves, the existence of which both you and Ted Cack deny.
    It is a perfect sphere, constructed, much like a bird''s nest, of matted fur and
    twigs and duff, and it is punctured with breathing holes, through which I snort.
    It hangs from a hook in my cave, alongside my caged toads. This is where I stay
    between full moons, reclining in my werehammock, by turns whistling, puffing on
    acrid Lithuanian cigarettes, reading Pliny, Herodotus, and Jeanette Winterson,
    and taking werenaps. Occasionally I might play with my toads, goading them until
    the precious stones embedded in their heads glow, oh! so brightly. It is a good
    thing to amass such wealth, when one is a werewolf, for who knows when even we
    may be plunged into penury due to a credit crunch?

    Outside my cave, the island, my ancestral homeland, is bathed in a perpetual milky
    light. I do not know why it is milky. There are of course other caves, and other
    werewolves, those who have made it back here, as I did, by marauding around the
    docks until we were able to slink aboard a ship under cover of night. I myself
    managed to skulk aboard a tugboat moored at the benighted seaside resort of O''Houlihan''s
    Wharf. As soon as it chugged away from shore I went on the rampage, howling and
    slashing and sinking my fangs into anything that moved. Most of the crew jumped
    into the sea rather than have their throats ripped out, so I was very soon in
    sole command. I seem to recall that the tugboat was called "Manley Hopkins". Blood
    and gore dripping from my leathery lips, I steered her out into the vast expanse
    of the ocean, following my guiding star. Just as the Magi followed a star to find
    the infant Jesus, so we werewolves have our own star, up there in the heavens,
    to bring us home. I have absolutely no idea how it works, but it does, you can
    rest assured on that point. The hard bit is working out which of the myriad stars
    blazing in the firmament is the one you are meant to be following. No handy werecharts
    of the heavens have ever been drawn, probably because as a general rule we werewolves
    are clumsy and cackhanded with paintbrushes and pencils. That is true even of
    me, despite my all round general majesty. So I drifted about in "Manley Hopkins"
    for a few days and nights, gobbling up the cold vitals of the slaughtered crew
    when I became peckish, and howling at seabirds to pass the time. Occasionally
    I would fix a star with a gaze of my yellow eyes and mentally interrogate it.
    Are you the werestar that will guide me home to my island?, I would ask. But the
    stars never answer. They just glitter, silent in a chaotic universe.

    I found my star. On the third or fourth night aboard the tugboat, far from land,
    I noticed a flock of wereguillemots, disposed across the sky such that they formed
    an arrow, or directional pointing device, clearly leading me to a bright tiny
    speck. I howled and I set the engine a-chug on its last gallon of fuel, and took
    the steering wheel in my clumsy paws. With the rising of the sun, I saw land on
    the horizon, shrouded in sea mist. My heart pounded in my hairy lupine chest.
    It was the island o'' werewolves. And it was no myth! The island is as real as
    the rock or pebble kicked by Dr Johnson on that memorable day when he kicked a
    rock or pebble to prove a point. And I kicked and bucked as I leapt, intrepid
    and superb, from boat to shore, home at last.

    It is true that in the title of his pamphlet Dobson calls my island mythical,
    that in his text he suggests that it is merely a hallucination within my brain
    and the brains of other werewolves. If that were so, could I swing here in my
    werehammock? Could the walls of my cave drip with the blood of savaged werevictims?
    Would that milky light illumine scenes of such fecund beauty, the hollyhocks and
    rhododendrons and petunias, the furze and vetch and watercress, the limpid pools
    and the roaring waterfalls, the manicured lawns, the golf links, the running track?

    Ah, the running track. You know, I think I will put aside my Pliny and stretch
    my legs. This island has many weasels and stoats and badgers to which I can lay
    chase, round and round the track, round and round, until I pounce upon them just
    past the flagpole, and rip them to bloody pieces, howling and howling under the
    silver moon.'
