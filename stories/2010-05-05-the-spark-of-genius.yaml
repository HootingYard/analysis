  text: 'Could this be the finest couplet in rock music?

    Well I''ve come back from the foundry and I find you in bed

    With Chris and Tim and John and Lindsay, Dagmar and Fred

    It''s from the song "Group Sex" on the album The Gab--Gift Or Curse? by The Plain
    People Of England, an offshoot of the Orchestre Murphy. It is, I suppose, vaguely
    possible that some readers may not realise just who it is in the bed, so here
    is some further reading.'
