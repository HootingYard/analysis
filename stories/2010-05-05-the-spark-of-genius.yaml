    \ the foundry and I find you in bed\nWith Chris and Tim and John and Lindsay,\
    \ Dagmar and Fred\nIt's from the song \u201CGroup Sex\u201D on the album\_The\
    \ Gab\u2014Gift Or Curse? by The Plain People Of England, an offshoot of the Orchestre\
    \ Murphy. It is, I suppose, vaguely possible that some readers may not realise\
