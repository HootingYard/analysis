  text: 'Assessing the career of the tyrant king Crepuscus VIII, it is hard to avoid
    the conclusion that he was excessively dull-witted and dim. There is a plethora
    of anecdotage, from courtiers and palace leeches, revealing that the king was
    rarely able to answer simple questions such as "What part of the body sits atop
    the neck?", "How many angels can dance upon the head of a pin?" or "Who won the
    1953 FA Cup Final?"

    And yet this atrociously stupid man ruled over a mighty kingdom for many years,
    his hands steady at the helm though his mind was doolally. So, dim as he was,
    he has much to teach us about the craft of kingship, and indeed of tyranny, if
    we consider tyranny a craft. For let there be no doubt that his reign was tyrannical.

    "In the case of Crepuscus VIII," wrote the historian Sagely, sagely, "we find
    a fateful combination of childish whimsy and an inability to string together a
    coherent sentence. Thus it was that his henchpersons invariably misunderstood
    his ukases, but hurried to fulfil them come what may." Sagely gives as an example
    the occasion when the tyrant king''s whim was to burn down every barn in the land.
    But so muddled and mangled was the manner in which he gave the command that his
    Royal Barn Burner mistakenly put a pot-belled pig in charge of the palace treasury
    instead. As might have been expected, the pig spent every last golden coin on
    swill, and not a barn was burned to the ground. Fortunately, Crepuscus VIII was
    so dim that he did not realise what had happened, nor why, and he retired to his
    boudoir to gaze at the ceiling, thinking it was the vault of heaven.

    One could multiply such flimflam until the cows come home, and indeed there are
    many amusing--and sometimes alarming--books which cobble together hundreds of
    instances of Crepuscus VIII''s imbecility. I want to take a slightly different
    tack, however. The thing that has always fascinated me about the tyrant king is
    not his breathtaking dimness but his dinner jackets.

    Dinner was of supreme importance at the court of Crepuscus VIII. Whatever else
    was going on, at four o'' clock sharp every day, the king would sweep into his
    banqueting hall and sit down at his banqueting table, at which would be gathered
    all sorts of banqueting companions. In spite of his dimness, the king liked to
    be entertained during dinner by philosophers, scientists, novelists, artists,
    actors, clowns, jugglers, pamphleteers, scruffily-bearded film directors, engineers,
    podcast maestros, deep sea divers, chefs, snipers, ornithologists, sundry persons
    with metal plates in their skulls, magicians, mountaineers, ex-Beatles, priests,
    anthropologists, cartographers, architects, mesmerists, and, if he was available,
    Rolf Harris. It is doubtful if any of the high-flown table talk penetrated the
    king''s dull-witted brain, but he sat there, a fork in each hand (he never used
    a knife), beaming, and resplendent in his dinner jacket of the day.

    There were seven of these jackets, one for each day of the week, and the king
    cut quite a dash in all of them. Monday''s was made of crimplene and cardboard,
    with golden stars and ribbons and a coathanger embedded in it. Tuesday''s was
    of plain burlap sacking, adorned with coal dust and grease. Wednesday''s was a
    gorgeous embroidered flapping wonder. Thursday''s was satin, boxy and black. Friday''s
    was knit from strands of a rare and stinking wool, shorn from rabid sheep, tie-dyed
    like some hippy shawl, surrounded by an aura invisible. Saturday''s was of classic
    cut but frayed at the cuffs, with dangling bells. Sunday''s was somehow a blur,
    as if the king was vibrating, or on another plane just beyond human apprehension.
    Whatever day of the week it was, whichever dinner jacket he was wearing, the tyrant
    king ate sparingly, birdseed and millet mostly, accompanied by sips of lukewarm
    water from the palace spigot.

    Today the dinner jackets can be found hanging in display cases in a jolly little
    museum hidden away in one of the less salubrious faubourgs of Pointy Town. I exhort
    you to pay a visit, nay, repeated visits. Study the jackets, now caked with dust,
    hear the echoes of all that banqueting table babbling, take away with you a souvenir
    packet of Tyrant King''s Birdseed(r), relive the days when Crepuscus VIII reigned
    over us, dim and tyrannical and cutting quite a dash.

    The part of the body atop the king''s neck, by the way, was his head.'
