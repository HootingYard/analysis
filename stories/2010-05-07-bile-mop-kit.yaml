  text: 'As I write, the result of the general election has been confirmed as a hung
    parliament, and it is not yet clear who will form the government. While pundits
    babble, let us take pause, and note that 6 May 2010 will go down in history, or
    at least in the Hooting Yard Book o'' Days (which amounts to the same thing) as
    the day Lembit Opik lost his seat. Note that umlaut!

    But as we hang our heads, and weep, remember that every cloud has a silver lining.
    Mr Opik is now free to concentrate on other things, and I fully expect him to
    pursue a glittering media career. In a few weeks time, we will be unable to turn
    on a television or radio or i-hub without seeing the Estonian Anagram (bile mop
    kit?) presenting, for example, "The Lembit Opik Meteorite Collision Show, With
    Russian Bimbos!"'
