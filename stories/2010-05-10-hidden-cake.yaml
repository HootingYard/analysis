  text: "I hid some cake inside a box. I hid the box behind a hedge. The hedge was\
    \ clipped by a snag-toothed peasant, using a rusty pair of shears. He'd left the\
    \ shears out overnight, leaning against the side of a barn. In the middle of the\
    \ night, there came an enormous cloudburst. It was a downpour the like of which\
    \ leads to floods and puddles. So busy was the peasant, over the next days, sloshing\
    \ around with his siphon, on drainage bent, he forgot all about the shears, hence\
    \ their rustiness, their rustiness.\n\u201CYou must go and clip the hedge!\u201D\
    \ commanded the goblin perched on the peasant's shoulder, a few days after the\
    \ downpour. The sun was blazing, so hot the hedge was dry. Vapour rose from it\
    \ and dispersed. This was the morning I hid the cake in the box and the box behind\
    \ the hedge. I did not have a goblin on my shoulder. Hereabouts, it is only the\
    \ peasants who have goblins.\nThe peasant tramped about looking for his shears.\
    \ He found them leaning against the side of the barn, rusty, rusty. \u201CThese\
    \ will never do for clipping,\u201D he muttered, and spat, but his goblin goaded\
    \ him on. It whispered rustic lore into his ear.\n\u201CThe sun is boiling in\
    \ the sky, clip your hedge while it is dry. If your shears are caked in rust,\
    \ fool you are but clip you must!\u201D\nAfter hiding the box behind the hedge,\
    \ I took up a position high on a slope, from where I could keep the hedge in view,\
    \ using binoculars. I was camouflaged as a shrub. The more acute peasants know\
    \ every inch of their land, and will be suspicious of a sudden shrub, so I was\
    \ wearing athlete's spikes in case I had to make a run for it. But I drew the\
    \ attention only of small snuffling mammals and one or two birds of the air.\n\
    I watched the peasant clipping the hedge with his rusty shears all through the\
    \ long afternoon. His goblin was fast asleep on his shoulder. The sun was sinking.\
    \ Inside the box sat my cake, packed, packed with sultanas, fruits shrivelled\
    \ by the same boiling sun, but on a different day, quite some time ago. The hedge\
    \ then had been less profuse, the shears not yet rusty, rusty, but the goblin\
    \ had even then been assigned to its peasant and taken up its perch on his shoulder.\
    \ Such are the country ways.\nIt was dusk when the clipping was done and the peasant\
    \ stubbed his toe upon the box. I was watching though my binoculars. His goblin\
    \ was awake again. It commanded him to open the box.\n\u201CIt has been sealed\
    \ shut with rivets,\u201D protested the peasant.\nCake and rivets, sultanas and\
    \ shears. What a world I engineer from my counterfeit shrub! I will outwit the\
    \ peasant's goblin, and it will seethe. Then I shall shrug off my shrub and hare\
    \ down the slope in moonlight, and go home, and put another cake in another box,\
    \ and seal the box with rivets, and hide it behind another hedge, tomorrow, tomorrow,\
    \ through my vinegar years."
