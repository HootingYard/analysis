  text: 'I hid some cake inside a box. I hid the box behind a hedge. The hedge was
    clipped by a snag-toothed peasant, using a rusty pair of shears. He''d left the
    shears out overnight, leaning against the side of a barn. In the middle of the
    night, there came an enormous cloudburst. It was a downpour the like of which
    leads to floods and puddles. So busy was the peasant, over the next days, sloshing
    around with his siphon, on drainage bent, he forgot all about the shears, hence
    their rustiness, their rustiness.

    "You must go and clip the hedge!" commanded the goblin perched on the peasant''s
    shoulder, a few days after the downpour. The sun was blazing, so hot the hedge
    was dry. Vapour rose from it and dispersed. This was the morning I hid the cake
    in the box and the box behind the hedge. I did not have a goblin on my shoulder.
    Hereabouts, it is only the peasants who have goblins.

    The peasant tramped about looking for his shears. He found them leaning against
    the side of the barn, rusty, rusty. "These will never do for clipping," he muttered,
    and spat, but his goblin goaded him on. It whispered rustic lore into his ear.

    "The sun is boiling in the sky, clip your hedge while it is dry. If your shears
    are caked in rust, fool you are but clip you must!"

    After hiding the box behind the hedge, I took up a position high on a slope, from
    where I could keep the hedge in view, using binoculars. I was camouflaged as a
    shrub. The more acute peasants know every inch of their land, and will be suspicious
    of a sudden shrub, so I was wearing athlete''s spikes in case I had to make a
    run for it. But I drew the attention only of small snuffling mammals and one or
    two birds of the air.

    I watched the peasant clipping the hedge with his rusty shears all through the
    long afternoon. His goblin was fast asleep on his shoulder. The sun was sinking.
    Inside the box sat my cake, packed, packed with sultanas, fruits shrivelled by
    the same boiling sun, but on a different day, quite some time ago. The hedge then
    had been less profuse, the shears not yet rusty, rusty, but the goblin had even
    then been assigned to its peasant and taken up its perch on his shoulder. Such
    are the country ways.

    It was dusk when the clipping was done and the peasant stubbed his toe upon the
    box. I was watching though my binoculars. His goblin was awake again. It commanded
    him to open the box.

    "It has been sealed shut with rivets," protested the peasant.

    Cake and rivets, sultanas and shears. What a world I engineer from my counterfeit
    shrub! I will outwit the peasant''s goblin, and it will seethe. Then I shall shrug
    off my shrub and hare down the slope in moonlight, and go home, and put another
    cake in another box, and seal the box with rivets, and hide it behind another
    hedge, tomorrow, tomorrow, through my vinegar years.'
