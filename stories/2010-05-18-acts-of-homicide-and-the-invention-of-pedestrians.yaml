  text: "\u201CThe [1957 Homicide] Act was criticised on many grounds and in most\
    \ quarters. None criticised it more severely than those \u2018abolitionists\u2019\
    \ to placate whom the Bill had been brought in. That is perhaps natural enough.\
    \ For them, it abolished too little. The nervous and those who simply saw no reason\
    \ for change (known as \u2018retentionists\u2019, just as non-motorists had, to\
    \ their astonishment, come to be known as \u2018pedestrians\u2019) were dismayed\
    \ to find that no more than a \u2018life\u2019 sentence (averaging ten years)\
    \ thenceforward awaited those who, for the first time as far as the law knew and\
    \ when not actively engaged in robbery, for any reason or none, killed anyone\
    \ but a policeman or prison officer with poison, cold steel, a blunt instrument,\
    \ drowning, strangulation, smothering, burning, gassing, starvation, driving a\
    \ car at the victim or tampering with his brakes, infecting him with a fatal disease,\
    \ pushing him off a tall building or over a cliff, torturing him beyond what his\
    \ constitution would bear, shutting him in with dangerous animals, inducing madness\
    \ with drugs, hypnotic suggestion or sustained ill-treatment and then putting\
    \ the means of suicide into his hands or leading him to believe that a fatal trap\
    \ is a way to safety, anything in fact that a writer of detective stories might\
    \ plausibly imagine. Apart from prison officers and policemen, the victim might\
    \ be anyone at all, a child or the Queen.\u201D\nRayner Heppenstall, The Sex War\
