  text: Today's Grauniad has an article asking if Brighton is the "hippest city in
    Britain", whatever that might mean. (I have not provided a link to the piece,
    for I feel sure Hooting Yard readers have better things to do with their time.)
    I mention it only to note that a far more cogent question would be "Is Pointy
    Town The Pointiest Town In The Known Universe?" Unfortunately, this would not
    fill much space in a newspaper, as the answer is quite obviously "Yes, it is".
    One could I suppose extrapolate upon the most pointy of the pointy attractions
    of Pointy Town, and perhaps one day soon I shall do so. But will the Grauniad
    publish it?
