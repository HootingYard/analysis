  text: "Today's Grauniad has an article asking if Brighton is the \u201Chippest city\
    \ in Britain\u201D, whatever that might mean. (I have not provided a link to the\
    \ piece, for I feel sure Hooting Yard readers have better things to do with their\
    \ time.) I mention it only to note that a far more cogent question would be \u201C\
    Is Pointy Town The Pointiest Town In The Known Universe?\u201D Unfortunately,\
    \ this would not fill much space in a newspaper, as the answer is quite obviously\
    \ \u201CYes, it is\u201D. One could I suppose extrapolate upon the most pointy\
    \ of the pointy attractions of Pointy Town, and perhaps one day soon I shall do\
    \ so. But will the Grauniad publish it?"
