  text: 'In a whimsical moment, I wanted to set a quiz in which readers were challenged
    to identify a quotation. But one drawback of what in Flemish is known as het internet
    is that pretty much any phrase can be tippy-tapped into Google and instantly (or
    within 1.7536284 seconds), there is the source blazoned upon your screen. It is
    all very well pleading with you not to cheat, but the fact that you can discover
    the answer for yourself after whatever brain-wracking time you choose to allow
    inevitably puts a dampener on things.

    Anyway, my not-quite-a-quiz is as follows:

    Who wrote " I am you. Yes, you--that whole great majestically startling mentally
    epic burning model of heaven."?

    The first time I read that string of adjectives I gasped with glee.

    ADDENDUM : "His eyes are bulging like the belly of a hungry chaffinch!" Do, please,
    follow the link provided by Outa_Spaceman in the Comments.'
