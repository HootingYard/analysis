  text: 'Pebblehead, that titan of the potboiler, has always kept secret the precise
    whereabouts of his legendary "chalet o'' prose", wherein he taps out the billions
    of words of his bestselling paperbacks. On a recent hiking holiday, however, the
    noted daubist Rex Daub stumbled upon the location, and was able to execute a rapid
    daub in his portable hikers'' daubum.


    The chalet o'' prose itself remains half hidden behind a verdant slope. In the
    foreground, we see postie struggling up the lane heaving a sack full of fan mail.
    You will note that he is not wearing a postie''s uniform. That is because, in
    this mountainous region, wherever it is, all the posties are amateurs, a tradition
    harking back to the days of King Vud. This lame and pocky monarch took against
    professionalised posties in uniform from an early age, after a tantrum. It was
    an opinion from which he never wavered, and his first act upon his coronation
    was to grant crown licences for postal delivery to a gaggle of peasant amateurs.
    The existing uniformed posties were shipped off to a remote and barnacle-encrusted
    atoll.

    Also in the picture we see Pebblehead''s famous "seven cows", munching grass on
    the verdant slope. The paperbackist has written movingly of these cows, or of
    six of them at least, and rather more dispassionately about the seventh, in a
    series of cow-related potboilers. Clockwise in the picture, starting from the
    largest cow, we see Spinach, Toffee Apple, Miliband, Chlorophyll, Banana Brain,
    Graticule and Gaston Le Mesmer, all of them familiar to readers of the series,
    but not, until now, visually, caught brilliantly as they are by Rex Daub''s daubing.

    Beyond the chalet o'' prose, the roof of which we see, blue, blue, there is some
    other stuff in the background, but Rex Daub may have invented this just to finish
    off his daub. It is a tendency he has, when in a hurry, as he often is, whether
    or not on a hiking holiday. For further particulars see A Pedestrian Memoir Of
    Hiking Holidays Accompanied By Noted Daubist Rex Daub by Dobson (out of print).'
