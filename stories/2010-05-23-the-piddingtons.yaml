  text: 'So, I was thinking, as I so often do, of the golden age of the Bodger''s
    Spinney Variety Theatre, and then, over at Ragbag, I came upon this marvellous
    list of music hall acts:

    "The joy, perhaps as much in memory as at the time, was in the variousness: the
    magician Ali Bongo (''The Shriek of Araby''), the illusionist Cingallee, the pigeon
    act Hamilton Conrad, the animal and bird impersonator Percy (''I Travel the Road'')
    Edwards, the drag act Ford and Sheen, the mind-reader The Amazing Fogel, the lady
    whistler Eva Kane, the male impersonator Hetty King, the foot spinner and raconteur
    Tex McLeod, the yodelling accordionist Billy Moore, the human spider Valantyne
    Napier, the mental telepathists The Piddingtons, the novelty xylophonist Reggie
    Redcliffe, the speciality dancer Bunty St Clair, the pianist Semprini, the aereliste
    Olga Varona, and many, many others--inhabitants of a lost world."

    Later today I will be attempting to contact The Piddingtons, via mental telepathy
    of course, and I shall keep you informed of the ensuing revelations.'
