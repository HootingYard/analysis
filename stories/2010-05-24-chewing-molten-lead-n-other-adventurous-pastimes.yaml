  text: "\u201CBooks on \u2018Hindu feats\u2019 became available throughout the twentieth\
    \ century, explaining such classic Indian wonders as snake charming and \u2018\
    the bed of nails\u2019, but also including a wide range of potentially dangerous\
    \ demonstrations that were less obviously Indian. These were the books to read\
    \ if you were interested in \u2018Driving a spike into your head\u2019, \u2018\
    Eating a ball of fire\u2019, or the equally imaginatively entitled \u2018Car on\
    \ head\u2019. More delicate readers could relax at home with one of the more gentle\
    \ \u2018feats of the yogi\u2019, such as \u2018hypnotizing a rabbit\u2019. But\
    \ anyone attempting the more adventurous pastimes would do well to read the instructions\
    \ carefully. \u2018Chewing molten lead\u2019, for example, required a special\
    \ compound that \u2018melts at approximately 160 degrees. If you wish a lower\
    \ melting point, add to the above a small amount of quicksilver\u2026 When melted,\
    \ this mixture may be poured on the tongue which, it goes without saying, must\
    \ be moist with saliva.\u2019 And if the student was not convinced by that explanation,\
    \ the following assurance of the author was given: \u2018Personally, I have never\
    \ developed enough courage to try this, although several have told me it is OK.'\u201D\
    \nPeter Lamont, The Rise Of The Indian Rope Trick (2004), quoting from Thrilling\
    \ Magic by Leonard H Miller (1959)"
