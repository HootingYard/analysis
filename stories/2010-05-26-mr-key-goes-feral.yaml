  text: 'Babbling prose into a microphone for half an hour every week is all very
    well, but occasionally one feels impelled to vent in a less... shall we say, prosaic
    manner. To this end, I am very pleased (I think) to be taking part in a performance
    by Phil Minton''s Feral Choir this coming Saturday, 29th May.

    Tune in to ResonanceFM at 8.00 PM, and--as Charles Ives recommended--"sit down,
    pin back your ears, and listen like a man!" (Women are equally adept at this practice.)

    Incidentally, and quite coincidentally, both Phil Minton and I have contributions
    due to appear in a forthcoming recipe book, to be sold for charity. I am not joking.
    I will of course keep readers fully informed, so you can buy innumerable copies
    when this invaluable tome hits the boulevards.'
