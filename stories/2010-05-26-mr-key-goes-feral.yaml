  text: "Babbling prose into a microphone for half an hour every week is all very\
    \ well, but occasionally one feels impelled to vent in a less\u2026 shall we say,\
    \ prosaic manner. To this end, I am very pleased (I think) to be taking part in\
    \ a performance by Phil Minton's Feral Choir this coming Saturday, 29th May.\n\
    Tune in to ResonanceFM at 8.00 PM, and\u2014as Charles Ives recommended\u2014\u201C\
    sit down, pin back your ears, and listen like a man!\u201D (Women are equally\
    \ adept at this practice.)\nIncidentally, and quite coincidentally, both Phil\
    \ Minton and I have contributions due to appear in a forthcoming recipe book,\
    \ to be sold for charity. I am not joking. I will of course keep readers fully\
    \ informed, so you can buy innumerable copies when this invaluable tome hits the\
    \ boulevards."
