  text: 'We have already learned how one can guarantee a tea party free of monkey
    divertisements by the simple expedient of dangling, on the end of a length of
    string suspended from the ceiling over the centre of the tea table, a large sugarlump.
    And we have seen that this tactic has the additional advantage of preventing the
    guests from putting their brains in their pockets.

    But let us say we are contrary sorts who wish, at tea parties, to encourage both
    monkey divertisements and the placing of brains in pockets. Is it sufficient,
    in such a case, merely to snip the dangling string, with a pair of scissors, and
    to chuck the piece to which the gargantuan sugarlump is attached into a waste
    bin, or to secrete it in a drawer?

    Would that it were so straightforward! Alas, at tea parties as in life, there
    is a freight of woe before we may bask unburdened in Elysium (cf. Grimes). By
    all means remove the string and the sugarlump, but do not expect at once to find
    monkeys cavorting around the tea table, nor your guests to pluck their brains
    out of their skulls and place them in their pockets. More needs to be done.

    First, you are advised to hire the services of a monkey feng shui consultant.
    I hasten to add that this is a person who has expertise in feng shui for monkeys,
    not a monkey who knows about feng shui. Several poor raddled souls of my acquaintance
    have plumped for the latter, and in due course lost the shirts off their backs,
    and a lot more. A generation ago, punks used to parrot the line "Never trust a
    hippy", and, echoing them, one could well add "Nor a monkey who claims credentials
    in the ancient Chinese system of aesthetics believed to use the laws of Heaven
    and Earth to improve one''s life by receiving positive qi". Certainly that is
    a mantra some extremely astute ex-punk-persons recite daily (cf. Savage).

    To attract monkeys to create divertisements among the cakes and tea-strainers
    at your tea party, you will have to create the right conditions for them, and
    this is where a qualified monkey feng shui consultant proves a boon. They tend
    to charge quite high fees, and rarely accept payment in nuts, so be warned that
    your tea party overheads will be steep. By "overheads" I do not mean the string
    affixed to the ceiling, because you have already deposited that in a bin or drawer,
    along with the massive sugarlump dangling from it.

    Please, please, give the consultant free rein, no matter how abstruse or ridiculous
    a kerfuffle they kick up. Qi is volatile stuff, a bit like ectoplasm, and monkey
    qi particularly so. Clinics up and down the land are filled with persons who came
    a cropper thinking they could dismiss their monkey feng shui consultant half way
    through his or her shenanigans and finish off the job themselves. No, just let
    them get on with it. Your parlour will look like the wreck of the Hesperus by
    the time they have completed their work, and your wallet be empty, but monkeys
    of all sorts will beat a path to your door come teatime.

    Persuading your guests to put their brains into their pockets is a task yet more
    challenging. In this case, there are, as far as I know, no consultants to consult.
    You must go it alone. Do not make the childish error of leaving, on the sideboard,
    a trepanning drill, and hoping for the best. I am sick and tired of explaining
    that boring a hole in the skull is utterly inadequate if one wishes for complete
    removal of the brain (cf. Felix). You will need a saw. Actually, unless you have
    top of the range disinfectant facilities, you will need as many saws as you have
    tea party guests. The last thing you want, as your guests sip tea poured from
    a majestic Delft teapot, ornamented with paintings of fat little Dutch shepherds
    and shepherdesses tending pigs, and monkeys jump and swing and shriek and otherwise
    provide divertisements, is to have a troop of inspectors from the neighbourhood
    skullsaw hygiene community support hub bashing the door down and halting the tea
    party on grounds of by-law infraction. And they will, they will, believe you me.

    It pays to ensure that each guest is partnered by an intimate acquaintance, that
    is, a person whom they will trust to saw through the top of their skull in readiness
    for brain removal. If such pairings prove impossible in advance, you will need
    to devise some ice-breaking party games before everyone sits down to tea. Try
    playing Fumbling With Mother''s Brooch, Poke The Pin In The Sheet Of Cardboard,
    or Catholic Persecution, each of which is guaranteed to wholly obliterate shyness
    or social unease.

    You also need to provide each guest with an overgarment, to be worn over their
    stylish tea party apparel. It is unlikely that any of them will attend already
    dressed in something with pockets of suitable size or lining. Study a scale model
    of a brain and compare it with the size of an average pocket and you will understand
    what I am saying. The nature of the pocket''s lining is equally important, and
    those of the overgarments you distribute among the guests ought to be of satin,
    or of a fabric equally rich and smooth. Remember the brain, in all its miraculous
    complexity, is but a fragile thing (cf. Finch) and while resting in the pocket
    must be cosseted.

    It is wise to make some preparations for the replacement of the brains within
    the skulls at the end of the tea party. Here, I very much recommend that you first
    shoo the monkeys out of the way. To avoid any brain being plopped into the wrong
    skull, with untoward consequences, each one ought to be marked with a symbol,
    and an identical symbol imprinted on the forehead of the corresponding brain''s
    owner. You can use a magic marker for this. If you are not gifted with the ability
    to draw startling and memorable symbolic forms, the monkey feng shui consultant
    probably is, though they will charge extra for doing so. The symbols should also
    be marked upon the sawed-off portions of head, for obvious reasons. To guard against
    future dislodgement, once the brains are back within the crania and the tops of
    the skulls are resting on the correct heads, use glue or some sort of industrial
    welding equipment to fix them firmly in place.

    As soon as the last guest has waved goodbye from the porch, you may wish to retrieve
    the string with its gigantic sugarlump appendage, and hang it once again from
    the ceiling. This will keep those monkeys at bay, so you can have a well-earned
    nap.

    Next week, we will look in more detail at the fat little Dutch shepherds and shepherdesses,
    and the pigs they tend, both as teapot decoration and in brute reality.'
