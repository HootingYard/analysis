  text: "There was a pig. It was in the cellar. I was listening to a record by Paul\
    \ Weller. He sang \u201CTales From The Riverbank\u201D. I looked at the pig and\
    \ my heart sank. I looked at the pig and our eyes met, The Jam song deafening\
    \ on my Dansette, a very old record player if truth be told. The cellar was gloomy\
    \ and damp and cold. So I lifted the needle off of the disc, I filed the record\
    \ back under Misc., and I unlocked the door with a big iron key, and I climbed\
    \ up the stairs with the pig beside me, and we ran outside into the battering\
    \ sun, and down to the riverbank where we had fun, the pig and me paddling, splashing\
    \ about, with voles and otters. Then I heard a shout. A fellow was waving from\
    \ the opposite bank. At first I thought he was some kind of crank. But it was\
    \ Paul Weller, to my amaze, dressed as he was in his Style Council days. Now the\
    \ pig liked The Jam, it was that kind of pig. It had never gone near a Style Council\
    \ gig. It grunted and trotted off back to the cellar. So was my pig/river idyll\
    \ marred by Paul Weller."
