  text: 'It has long been my conviction that newspapers in this age o'' pap ''n''
    barbarism are written and edited by numbskulls, dimwits, airheads and know-noughts.
    The sort of people who think "prima donna" is spelled, and means, "pre-Madonna"
    and who are indeed wholly ignorant of almost everything that happened before about
    1985.

    Here is a picture of Ringo Starr. I need not explain to Hooting Yard readers who
    he is.


    Ringo was visiting the Chelsea Flower Show this week. A snap appeared in the Telegraph.
    The caption? "Ringo Starr, the narrator of Thomas the Tank Engine, with his wife
    Barbara Bach at the Chelsea Flower Show 2010." [My italics.]

    Cruel it may be, but one is tempted to force these nitwits to listen to "Octopus''s
    Garden" over and over and over again, until the cows come home.'
