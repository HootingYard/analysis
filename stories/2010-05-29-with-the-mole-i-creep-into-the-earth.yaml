  text: 'Yesterday I went to a concert given by William D Drake. One of the songs
    he and his band performed was a splendid setting of a sonnet by Michael Drayton
    (1563-1631), a poet of whom I confess I had never heard before. Here is a portrait,
    and the poem:


    When first I ended, then I first began;

    Then more I travelled further from my rest.

    Where most I lost, there most of all I won;

    Pined with hunger, rising from a feast.

    Methinks I fly, yet want I legs to go,

    Wise in conceit, in act a very sot,

    Ravished with joy amidst a hell of woe,

    What most I seem that surest am I not.

    I build my hopes a world above the sky,

    Yet with the mole I creep into the earth;

    In plenty I am starved with penury,

    And yet I surfeit in the greatest dearth.

    I have, I want, despair, and yet desire,

    Burned in a sea of ice, and drowned amidst a fire.'
