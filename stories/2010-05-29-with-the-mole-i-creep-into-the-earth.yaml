  text: "Yesterday I went to a concert given by William D Drake. One of the songs\
    \ he and his band performed was a splendid setting of a sonnet by Michael Drayton\
    \ (1563\u20131631), a poet of whom I confess I had never heard before. Here is\
    \ a portrait, and the poem:\n\nWhen first I ended, then I first began;\nThen more\
    \ I travelled further from my rest.\nWhere most I lost, there most of all I won;\n\
    Pin\xE8d with hunger, rising from a feast.\nMethinks I fly, yet want I legs to\
    \ go,\nWise in conceit, in act a very sot,\nRavished with joy amidst a hell of\
    \ woe,\nWhat most I seem that surest am I not.\nI build my hopes a world above\
    \ the sky,\nYet with the mole I creep into the earth;\nIn plenty I am starved\
    \ with penury,\nAnd yet I surfeit in the greatest dearth.\nI have, I want, despair,\
    \ and yet desire,\nBurned in a sea of ice, and drowned amidst a fire."
