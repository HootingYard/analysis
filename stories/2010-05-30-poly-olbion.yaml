  text: 'I have not yet borrowed a copy of Michael Drayton''s Poly-Olbion from the
    London Library, but I will do so shortly. Could this exceedingly lengthy work
    become a Hooting Yard On The Air Christmas Special, a broadcast I suspect would
    be longer than the three hours devoted to Christopher Smart''s Jubilate Agno?
    We shall see...

    Meanwhile, here is the title page of the copy held by Warwickshire County Council:
