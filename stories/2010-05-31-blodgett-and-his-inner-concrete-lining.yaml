  text: "Like William Taylor Marrs, Blodgett had to weigh in the balance being dead\
    \ with chills or having an inner concrete lining. He was, at the time, shivering\
    \ in an Antarctic cabin, having been lured there, and then abandoned, by the criminal\
    \ lunatic Babinsky. Though not of a neurasthenic bent himself, Blodgett was immensely\
    \ well-read in the literature of neurasthenia, as he was in the broader field\
    \ of peplack. We can ascribe this unlikely erudition to the influence on the young\
    \ Blodgett of his schoolteacher Margbort Stuke, for whom pep was king, and queen,\
    \ prince and princeling, lord, baron and marquise. Contracted by the school to\
    \ teach alg \u2018n\u2019 trig, he was ahead of his time\u2014perhaps regrettably\u2014\
    in that his lessons were more concerned with self-esteem and diversity. (Incidentally,\
    \ he went on to teach a college course in serial killer studies, in which the\
    \ career of Babinsky loomed large.)\nSo as he sat quaking in his cabin with icicles\
    \ forming on his nose, Blodgett recalled the choice made by Marrs in Confessions\
    \ Of A Neurasthenic (1908) and resolved to cultivate an inner concrete lining.\
    \ It was for this reason that he mustered a pack of huskies, harnessed them to\
    \ a sledge, and mooshed them north, until he reached the sea. From there, he stowed\
    \ away aboard a steamer, a sort of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket on a reverse\
    \ journey, fetching up eventually upon a beach suitable for his purpose.\nBlodgett\
    \ built himself a shelter using driftwood and fronds, and spent months living\
    \ on the beach, daily ingesting a diet of sand, crustacea, fruit-pips, oysters,\
    \ and seashells. Gradually his limbs began to stiffen, but he was at no risk of\
    \ chills, for even at night it was a hot beach, as beaches go.\nEventually the\
    \ concrete encrustment within him rendered Blodgett almost wholly immobile. Before\
    \ complete rigidity set in, he made a flag out of cut and dyed fronds, fixed it\
    \ to a pole, and awaited rescue.\nCarried aboard the HMS Corrugated Cardboard\
    \ by stretcher, one morning in September, Blodgett was deposited in a lifeboat\
    \ and covered with a tarpaulin. Twice a day a deckhand would appear, fold back\
    \ the tarp, shove a funnel into Blodgett's mouth, and pour into it an anticoagulant\
    \ soft drink, sweet and syrupy, with just a hint of steak and kidney pie. By the\
    \ time the ship docked at Tantarabim, Blodgett was able to walk ashore unaided,\
    \ though his gait was the subject of chuckles. He went immediately to an experimental\
    \ medical facility where his inner concrete lining, now somewhat softened, was\
    \ extracted in one piece, drawn out through his left ear with pliers and tweezers.\
    \ Exposed to the gusty Tantarabim air, it soon hardened again, and Blodgett made\
    \ a living for a few years exhibiting it, standing alongside him, under the show\
    \ business moniker Blodgett And His Almost Life-Size Concrete Effigy. He would\
    \ play sprightly tunes upon a xylophone while his concrete counterpart stood as\
    \ if listening with rapt attention.\nThat same gusty Tantarabim air eventually\
    \ brought Blodgett down with chills, and though he did not die from them, he returned\
    \ to the medical facility to see if it was possible to have his inner concrete\
    \ lining reinserted.\n\u201CThat will not be possible,\u201D said the medical\
    \ facility head honcho, who was none other than Babinsky in heavy disguise. He\
    \ watched the disappointed Blodgett traipse away down the path, snuffling, hand\
    \ in hand with the concrete effigy, and his lunatic criminal brain plotted a further\
    \ enormity."
