  text: 'Like William Taylor Marrs, Blodgett had to weigh in the balance being dead
    with chills or having an inner concrete lining. He was, at the time, shivering
    in an Antarctic cabin, having been lured there, and then abandoned, by the criminal
    lunatic Babinsky. Though not of a neurasthenic bent himself, Blodgett was immensely
    well-read in the literature of neurasthenia, as he was in the broader field of
    peplack. We can ascribe this unlikely erudition to the influence on the young
    Blodgett of his schoolteacher Margbort Stuke, for whom pep was king, and queen,
    prince and princeling, lord, baron and marquise. Contracted by the school to teach
    alg ''n'' trig, he was ahead of his time--perhaps regrettably--in that his lessons
    were more concerned with self-esteem and diversity. (Incidentally, he went on
    to teach a college course in serial killer studies, in which the career of Babinsky
    loomed large.)

    So as he sat quaking in his cabin with icicles forming on his nose, Blodgett recalled
    the choice made by Marrs in Confessions Of A Neurasthenic (1908) and resolved
    to cultivate an inner concrete lining. It was for this reason that he mustered
    a pack of huskies, harnessed them to a sledge, and mooshed them north, until he
    reached the sea. From there, he stowed away aboard a steamer, a sort of Arthur
    Gordon Pym of Nantucket on a reverse journey, fetching up eventually upon a beach
    suitable for his purpose.

    Blodgett built himself a shelter using driftwood and fronds, and spent months
    living on the beach, daily ingesting a diet of sand, crustacea, fruit-pips, oysters,
    and seashells. Gradually his limbs began to stiffen, but he was at no risk of
    chills, for even at night it was a hot beach, as beaches go.

    Eventually the concrete encrustment within him rendered Blodgett almost wholly
    immobile. Before complete rigidity set in, he made a flag out of cut and dyed
    fronds, fixed it to a pole, and awaited rescue.

    Carried aboard the HMS Corrugated Cardboard by stretcher, one morning in September,
    Blodgett was deposited in a lifeboat and covered with a tarpaulin. Twice a day
    a deckhand would appear, fold back the tarp, shove a funnel into Blodgett''s mouth,
    and pour into it an anticoagulant soft drink, sweet and syrupy, with just a hint
    of steak and kidney pie. By the time the ship docked at Tantarabim, Blodgett was
    able to walk ashore unaided, though his gait was the subject of chuckles. He went
    immediately to an experimental medical facility where his inner concrete lining,
    now somewhat softened, was extracted in one piece, drawn out through his left
    ear with pliers and tweezers. Exposed to the gusty Tantarabim air, it soon hardened
    again, and Blodgett made a living for a few years exhibiting it, standing alongside
    him, under the show business moniker Blodgett And His Almost Life-Size Concrete
    Effigy. He would play sprightly tunes upon a xylophone while his concrete counterpart
    stood as if listening with rapt attention.

    That same gusty Tantarabim air eventually brought Blodgett down with chills, and
    though he did not die from them, he returned to the medical facility to see if
    it was possible to have his inner concrete lining reinserted.

    "That will not be possible," said the medical facility head honcho, who was none
    other than Babinsky in heavy disguise. He watched the disappointed Blodgett traipse
    away down the path, snuffling, hand in hand with the concrete effigy, and his
    lunatic criminal brain plotted a further enormity.'
