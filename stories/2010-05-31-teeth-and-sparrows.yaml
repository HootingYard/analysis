  text: '"The small bones of poultry, preserved in a hole in a wall, the medullary
    channel being left intact, will immediately cure tooth-ache, they say, if the
    tooth is touched or the gum scarified therewith, care being taken to throw away
    the bone the moment the operation is performed. A similar result is obtained by
    using raven''s dung, wrapped in wool and attached to the body, or else sparrow''s
    dung, warmed with oil and injected into the ear on the side affected. This last
    remedy, however, is productive of an intolerable itching, for which reason it
    is considered a better plan to rub the part with the ashes of young sparrows burnt
    upon twigs, mixed with vinegar for the purpose."
