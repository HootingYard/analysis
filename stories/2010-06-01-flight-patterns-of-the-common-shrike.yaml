  text: "One rain-lashed November morning in the latter half of the 1950s, Dobson\
    \ awoke from uneasy dreams and succumbed to a fit of ornithomania. At the breakfast\
    \ table, after fletcherising his steamed dough \u2018n\u2019 gooseflesh flan,\
    \ he announced to Marigold Chew \u201CO inamorata o\u2019 mine! What the world\
    \ needs is a pamphlet, decisively written, on the flight patterns of the common\
    \ shrike.\u201D\nMarigold Chew let this intelligence sink in while she munched\
    \ her kedgeree. This was the period, it ought to be noted, when the out of print\
    \ pamphleteer and his belle kept to differing breakfast menus, later to be chronicled\
    \ in the pamphlet-cum-recipe book A Thousand Breakfasts In Five Hundred Days (out\
    \ of print).\nMunching done, Marigold Chew asked pointedly, \u201CAre you intending\
    \ to pen this pamphlet yourself, Dobson?\u201D to which the pamphleteer replied,\
    \ after a long pause while he masticated a mouthful of flan thirty-two times,\
    \ \u201CYes, of course!\u201D\nMarigold Chew sighed. \u201CDobson,\u201D she said,\
    \ not unkindly, \u201CYou know nothing of the shrike. I doubt you could tell one\
    \ apart from a robin or a starling or a pratincole or even a vulture. How the\
    \ hell are you going to write, decisively or otherwise, about the flight patterns\
    \ of a bird of which your ignorance is limitless?\u201D\n\u201CI have a one word\
    \ answer to that,\u201D replied Dobson, \u201CResearch!\u201D\nSo it was that,\
    \ when his breakfast was fully digested, Dobson clambered into his Galician Zookeeper's\
    \ boots, donned a threadbare waterproof, and stalked out into the rain. He made\
    \ for the top of Pilgarlic Tor and stared at the sky for hours. When he returned\
    \ home, he was drenched, and dusk was descending.\n\u201CWell?\u201D asked Marigold\
    \ Chew, \u201CWhat have you learned?\u201D\n\u201CThe sky is a vast expanse,\u201D\
    \ said Dobson, \u201CAcross which clouds scud, and from these clouds falls rain,\
    \ now as drizzle, now in sheets, hence the puddle forming at my feet which I shall\
    \ mop up with a mop on the end of a stick when I have done enlightening you, my\
    \ darling dear. From time to time, below the scudding clouds, birds soar and swoop\
    \ across the sky. Some go flitting until they can no longer be perceived by the\
    \ human eye, some come into land on the branches of trees or in nests built high\
    \ or low in trees or even in hedgerows. There are many different types of birds,\
    \ many more than the ones you catalogued over breakfast this morning. Each has\
    \ a distinctive manner of keeping itself airborne. Through keen and judicious\
    \ observation, one can learn to differentiate one type of bird from another, purely\
    \ from its method of flight, without needing to get close up to it, for example\
    \ while it is resting in its nest or on a tree-branch. As my pamphlet will be\
    \ devoted exclusively to the common shrike's flight patterns, that closer observation\
    \ in the nest will not be necessary. That is fortunate, for I much prefer to stand\
    \ windswept and rain-lashed upon the top of the tor than to be hunkered in shrubbery\
    \ for hours on end, where I would be subject to biting by insects and other things\
    \ that crawl upon the earth, and in shrubs.\u201D\n\u201CThere are goos one can\
    \ smear upon the skin to repel such creatures,\u201D said Marigold Chew, waving\
    \ her hand towards a wall-mounted cabinet wherein such goos were stored.\n\u201C\
    That may be so,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CBut if you are listening attentively\
    \ you will grasp that for present purposes I need no such repellant.\u201D\n\u201C\
    So will you be standing atop Pilgarlic Tor again tomorrow, staring at the sky?\u201D\
    \ asked Marigold Chew.\n\u201CI will not,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CFor tomorrow\
    \ I will be consulting works of ornithological reference in the library.\u201D\
    \nAnd lo! it came to pass. The following morning, after a breakfast of eggy buns\
    \ (Dobson) and lightly grilled hen-head with tomatoes (Marigold Chew), the pamphleteer\
    \ was to be found poring over an enormous ornithological reference work in the\
    \ ornithological reference library reading room. In those days, libraries were\
    \ havens of quiet in what Pratt dubbed \u201Cthe hurly burly of the urban conurbation\u201D\
    , and the only sounds to be heard were the frantic scraping of Dobson's very very\
    \ sharp pencil as he scribbled upon his jotter, and the strangulated choking of\
    \ a fellow bird researcher with a predilection for high tar cigarettes. Dobson\
    \ was making notes from his study of The Boys\u2019 And Girls\u2019 Bumper Book\
    \ Of Shrikes. He copied out one passage in its entirety:\nNow, tinies, let me\
    \ tell you why the shrike is known as the \u201Cbutcher bird\u201D. You see, it\
    \ is a rapacious and violent little birdie, and it likes to entrap in its talons\
    \ insects, small birds and even teeny weeny mammals like fieldmice and shrews.\
    \ Once caught, it impales its victim upon sharp thorns. This helps it to tear\
    \ the flesh into smaller, more conveniently-sized fragments, and serves as a sort\
    \ of pantry or larder so the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later\
    \ time. Its call is strident. You will probably have nightmares about it now,\
    \ but it is well to learn that nature is a realm of blood and gore.\n\u201CHow\
    \ did you get on at the library?\u201D asked Marigold Chew when Dobson returned.\
    \ He had trudged home in a downpour, and a puddle was forming around his feet,\
    \ which today were clad in a pair of Paraguayan Mining Inspector's boots.\n\u201C\
    It looks as though I will have more mopping up to do, o light of my life,\u201D\
    \ said Dobson. \u201CYou will no doubt be pleased to hear that I have formed a\
    \ plan of campaign for the accomplishment of what I suspect will be one of my\
    \ most important pamphlets.\u201D\n\u201CI am glad to hear it,\u201D said Marigold\
    \ Chew, who was knocking back a beaker of some fluid she had strained through\
    \ a sieve earlier that day. Its colour was indescribable, and it was pip free.\n\
    Dobson took his jotter from an inside pocket of his raincoat.\n\u201CListen to\
    \ this!\u201D, he said, in an excitable voice, \u201CThe shrike is a rapacious\
    \ and violent little birdie, and it likes to entrap in its talons insects, small\
    \ birds and even teeny weeny mammals like fieldmice and shrews. Once caught, it\
    \ impales its victim upon sharp thorns. This helps it to tear the flesh into smaller,\
    \ more conveniently-sized fragments, and serves as a sort of pantry or larder\
    \ so the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time. Its call is\
    \ strident. And that's not all, but you get the gist.\u201D\n\u201CI do,\u201D\
    \ said Marigold Chew, \u201CBut what is your plan of campaign and when are you\
    \ due to set it in motion?\u201D\n\u201CUsing keen and judicious observation,\
    \ from atop Pilgarlic Tor, I will wait to spot a bird impaling an insect or a\
    \ smaller bird or a fieldmouse or a shrew or some other tiny mammal upon a thorn.\
    \ \u2018That,\u2019 I will say to myself, possibly out loud, \u2018is a shrike!\u2019\
    \ It will then be a simple matter of watching it fly away from the thorn and to\
    \ trace, with my pencil, in my jotter, the patterns it forms in the sky. This\
    \ diagram will then form the basis for an accompanying text, which will describe\
    \ the patterns, in decisive prose.\u201D\nThe next morning, Dobson ate lobster\
    \ for breakfast while Marigold Chew had mashed up cake \u2018n\u2019 crumpets\
    \ \u2018n\u2019 cornflakes. Then the pamphleteer headed out for Pilgarlic Tor\
    \ in the torrential rain. He stationed himself in the vicinity of a thorn bush,\
    \ near the summit, and watched, keenly and judiciously, all day. That was Thursday.\
    \ Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were identical in all\
    \ particulars except, of course, for the breakfasts. By the time dusk descended\
    \ on the second Thursday, Dobson was soaked to the skin and had yet to spot a\
    \ shrike. He returned home crushed and despondent. Marigold Chew could tell from\
    \ the misery etched upon his countenance that his plan of campaign was yet to\
    \ bear fruit, but as the pamphleteer stood in a puddle in his Latvian Ice Rink\
    \ Attendant's boots, contemplating the mopping he would shortly be engaged in,\
    \ she asked, \u201CDid you spot a shrike today, Dobson?\u201D\n\u201CI did not,\u201D\
    \ he moaned, in a voice ancient and sepulchral.\n\u201CI did,\u201D said Marigold\
    \ Chew, \u201CJust after you left this morning I went out into the garden to cast\
    \ my gaze admiringly upon the hollyhocks, and gosh, all of a sudden a bird swooped\
    \ into view, a newborn hamster struggling in the vicious grip of its talons, and\
    \ I was jolted by a wave of nausea as I watched the bird impale the poor tiny\
    \ thing upon a thorn in the thorn bush next to the hollyhock patch beside the\
    \ shed. Somehow I managed not to vomit all over the lawn, and I realised the bird\
    \ was a shrike, so I ran indoors for my sketchpad and propelling pencil and rushed\
    \ back out in time to see the shrike fly away, thereupon executing a highly accurate\
    \ rendering of the patterns it formed in the sky until, some minutes later, it\
    \ was lost to view in the overcast grey immensity of the rain-raddled empyrean.\u201D\
    \n\u201CAnd you're sure it wasn't a pratincole?\u201D asked Dobson.\n\u201CAs\
    \ sure as eggs is eggs,\u201D said Marigold Chew, brandishing the relevant page\
    \ of her sketchpad in the pamphleteer's face, now transformed by joy.\n\u201C\
    This is fantastic news!\u201D cried Dobson, and he sprang forward and clutched\
    \ Marigold Chew in an embrace of boundless love. And that is why the pamphlet\
    \ Flight-Patterns Of The Common Shrike by Dobson (out of print) has the subtitle\
    \ With A Tremendously Accurate Diagram by Marigold Chew.\nIn closing, it is worth\
    \ noting that Dobson's text, far from being decisive, is incoherent, jumbled,\
    \ and in places quite potty, probably because in the bliss of their wild embrace,\
    \ Marigold Chew's sketchpad was dropped into the puddle of rainwater, and became\
    \ smudged. The diagram as published was newly drawn, from memory, a few days later,\
    \ and was by no means as tremendously accurate as claimed. In fact, a reputed\
    \ ornithologist has said that the flight patterns represented are typical, not\
    \ of the shrike, but of the pratincole."
