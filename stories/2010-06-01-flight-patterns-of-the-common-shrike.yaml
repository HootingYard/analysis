  text: 'One rain-lashed November morning in the latter half of the 1950s, Dobson
    awoke from uneasy dreams and succumbed to a fit of ornithomania. At the breakfast
    table, after fletcherising his steamed dough ''n'' gooseflesh flan, he announced
    to Marigold Chew "O inamorata o'' mine! What the world needs is a pamphlet, decisively
    written, on the flight patterns of the common shrike."

    Marigold Chew let this intelligence sink in while she munched her kedgeree. This
    was the period, it ought to be noted, when the out of print pamphleteer and his
    belle kept to differing breakfast menus, later to be chronicled in the pamphlet-cum-recipe
    book A Thousand Breakfasts In Five Hundred Days (out of print).

    Munching done, Marigold Chew asked pointedly, "Are you intending to pen this pamphlet
    yourself, Dobson?" to which the pamphleteer replied, after a long pause while
    he masticated a mouthful of flan thirty-two times, "Yes, of course!"

    Marigold Chew sighed. "Dobson," she said, not unkindly, "You know nothing of the
    shrike. I doubt you could tell one apart from a robin or a starling or a pratincole
    or even a vulture. How the hell are you going to write, decisively or otherwise,
    about the flight patterns of a bird of which your ignorance is limitless?"

    "I have a one word answer to that," replied Dobson, "Research!"

    So it was that, when his breakfast was fully digested, Dobson clambered into his
    Galician Zookeeper''s boots, donned a threadbare waterproof, and stalked out into
    the rain. He made for the top of Pilgarlic Tor and stared at the sky for hours.
    When he returned home, he was drenched, and dusk was descending.

    "Well?" asked Marigold Chew, "What have you learned?"

    "The sky is a vast expanse," said Dobson, "Across which clouds scud, and from
    these clouds falls rain, now as drizzle, now in sheets, hence the puddle forming
    at my feet which I shall mop up with a mop on the end of a stick when I have done
    enlightening you, my darling dear. From time to time, below the scudding clouds,
    birds soar and swoop across the sky. Some go flitting until they can no longer
    be perceived by the human eye, some come into land on the branches of trees or
    in nests built high or low in trees or even in hedgerows. There are many different
    types of birds, many more than the ones you catalogued over breakfast this morning.
    Each has a distinctive manner of keeping itself airborne. Through keen and judicious
    observation, one can learn to differentiate one type of bird from another, purely
    from its method of flight, without needing to get close up to it, for example
    while it is resting in its nest or on a tree-branch. As my pamphlet will be devoted
    exclusively to the common shrike''s flight patterns, that closer observation in
    the nest will not be necessary. That is fortunate, for I much prefer to stand
    windswept and rain-lashed upon the top of the tor than to be hunkered in shrubbery
    for hours on end, where I would be subject to biting by insects and other things
    that crawl upon the earth, and in shrubs."

    "There are goos one can smear upon the skin to repel such creatures," said Marigold
    Chew, waving her hand towards a wall-mounted cabinet wherein such goos were stored.

    "That may be so," said Dobson, "But if you are listening attentively you will
    grasp that for present purposes I need no such repellant."

    "So will you be standing atop Pilgarlic Tor again tomorrow, staring at the sky?"
    asked Marigold Chew.

    "I will not," said Dobson, "For tomorrow I will be consulting works of ornithological
    reference in the library."

    And lo! it came to pass. The following morning, after a breakfast of eggy buns
    (Dobson) and lightly grilled hen-head with tomatoes (Marigold Chew), the pamphleteer
    was to be found poring over an enormous ornithological reference work in the ornithological
    reference library reading room. In those days, libraries were havens of quiet
    in what Pratt dubbed "the hurly burly of the urban conurbation", and the only
    sounds to be heard were the frantic scraping of Dobson''s very very sharp pencil
    as he scribbled upon his jotter, and the strangulated choking of a fellow bird
    researcher with a predilection for high tar cigarettes. Dobson was making notes
    from his study of The Boys'' And Girls'' Bumper Book Of Shrikes. He copied out
    one passage in its entirety:

    Now, tinies, let me tell you why the shrike is known as the "butcher bird". You
    see, it is a rapacious and violent little birdie, and it likes to entrap in its
    talons insects, small birds and even teeny weeny mammals like fieldmice and shrews.
    Once caught, it impales its victim upon sharp thorns. This helps it to tear the
    flesh into smaller, more conveniently-sized fragments, and serves as a sort of
    pantry or larder so the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time.
    Its call is strident. You will probably have nightmares about it now, but it is
    well to learn that nature is a realm of blood and gore.

    "How did you get on at the library?" asked Marigold Chew when Dobson returned.
    He had trudged home in a downpour, and a puddle was forming around his feet, which
    today were clad in a pair of Paraguayan Mining Inspector''s boots.

    "It looks as though I will have more mopping up to do, o light of my life," said
    Dobson. "You will no doubt be pleased to hear that I have formed a plan of campaign
    for the accomplishment of what I suspect will be one of my most important pamphlets."

    "I am glad to hear it," said Marigold Chew, who was knocking back a beaker of
    some fluid she had strained through a sieve earlier that day. Its colour was indescribable,
    and it was pip free.

    Dobson took his jotter from an inside pocket of his raincoat.

    "Listen to this!", he said, in an excitable voice, "The shrike is a rapacious
    and violent little birdie, and it likes to entrap in its talons insects, small
    birds and even teeny weeny mammals like fieldmice and shrews. Once caught, it
    impales its victim upon sharp thorns. This helps it to tear the flesh into smaller,
    more conveniently-sized fragments, and serves as a sort of pantry or larder so
    the shrike can return to the uneaten portions at a later time. Its call is strident.
    And that''s not all, but you get the gist."

    "I do," said Marigold Chew, "But what is your plan of campaign and when are you
    due to set it in motion?"

    "Using keen and judicious observation, from atop Pilgarlic Tor, I will wait to
    spot a bird impaling an insect or a smaller bird or a fieldmouse or a shrew or
    some other tiny mammal upon a thorn. ''That,'' I will say to myself, possibly
    out loud, ''is a shrike!'' It will then be a simple matter of watching it fly
    away from the thorn and to trace, with my pencil, in my jotter, the patterns it
    forms in the sky. This diagram will then form the basis for an accompanying text,
    which will describe the patterns, in decisive prose."

    The next morning, Dobson ate lobster for breakfast while Marigold Chew had mashed
    up cake ''n'' crumpets ''n'' cornflakes. Then the pamphleteer headed out for Pilgarlic
    Tor in the torrential rain. He stationed himself in the vicinity of a thorn bush,
    near the summit, and watched, keenly and judiciously, all day. That was Thursday.
    Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were identical in all
    particulars except, of course, for the breakfasts. By the time dusk descended
    on the second Thursday, Dobson was soaked to the skin and had yet to spot a shrike.
    He returned home crushed and despondent. Marigold Chew could tell from the misery
    etched upon his countenance that his plan of campaign was yet to bear fruit, but
    as the pamphleteer stood in a puddle in his Latvian Ice Rink Attendant''s boots,
    contemplating the mopping he would shortly be engaged in, she asked, "Did you
    spot a shrike today, Dobson?"

    "I did not," he moaned, in a voice ancient and sepulchral.

    "I did," said Marigold Chew, "Just after you left this morning I went out into
    the garden to cast my gaze admiringly upon the hollyhocks, and gosh, all of a
    sudden a bird swooped into view, a newborn hamster struggling in the vicious grip
    of its talons, and I was jolted by a wave of nausea as I watched the bird impale
    the poor tiny thing upon a thorn in the thorn bush next to the hollyhock patch
    beside the shed. Somehow I managed not to vomit all over the lawn, and I realised
    the bird was a shrike, so I ran indoors for my sketchpad and propelling pencil
    and rushed back out in time to see the shrike fly away, thereupon executing a
    highly accurate rendering of the patterns it formed in the sky until, some minutes
    later, it was lost to view in the overcast grey immensity of the rain-raddled
    empyrean."

    "And you''re sure it wasn''t a pratincole?" asked Dobson.

    "As sure as eggs is eggs," said Marigold Chew, brandishing the relevant page of
    her sketchpad in the pamphleteer''s face, now transformed by joy.

    "This is fantastic news!" cried Dobson, and he sprang forward and clutched Marigold
    Chew in an embrace of boundless love. And that is why the pamphlet Flight-Patterns
    Of The Common Shrike by Dobson (out of print) has the subtitle With A Tremendously
    Accurate Diagram by Marigold Chew.

    In closing, it is worth noting that Dobson''s text, far from being decisive, is
    incoherent, jumbled, and in places quite potty, probably because in the bliss
    of their wild embrace, Marigold Chew''s sketchpad was dropped into the puddle
    of rainwater, and became smudged. The diagram as published was newly drawn, from
    memory, a few days later, and was by no means as tremendously accurate as claimed.
    In fact, a reputed ornithologist has said that the flight patterns represented
    are typical, not of the shrike, but of the pratincole.'
