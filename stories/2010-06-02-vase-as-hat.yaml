  text: "There comes a time, for a lady, as indeed for a gentleman, when an invitation\
    \ is received to attend a function at which the wearing of a stylish hat is de\
    \ rigueur. Receipt of such can fluster the hatless and the poor. Imagine you are\
    \ a pauper without a hat to call your own. Enchanted as you are to be expected\
    \ at, say, a king's levee, you will be plunged into seething fret by dint of both\
    \ your hatlessness and your impecunious state, which forbids you from simply dashing\
    \ out to a hat shop to purchase a stylish hat, as a non-pauper might do. You could,\
    \ of course, steal a hat, but that would be a step into a moral sewer, and at\
    \ the last, when your time on earth is done, you would be dragged by fiendish\
    \ claws into the hellfire, there to burn and rot in all eternity.\nBut fear not!\
    \ For here is salve for your agony from Hooting Yard's hat person Fatima Gilliblat.\
    \ Fatima has given much thought to the hat/pauper conundrum, and we are pleased\
    \ to reprint her excellent advice:\nDuring my long and searching wanderings through\
    \ the hovels of the destitute, I have always been impressed by the fact that even\
    \ the meanest midden has in it, on a windowsill or mantelpiece, a vase of flowers.\
    \ Perhaps this is due to the influence of John Ruskin. I do not know, but I know\
    \ the evidence of my eyes, and everywhere I look I see vases of flowers.\nI am\
    \ only too well aware of the flap a pauper gets into when postie saunters up the\
    \ filthy lane bearing an invitation to a municipal function or a swish cocktail\
    \ party or even a king's levee, any kind of do where one will be barred if not\
    \ wearing a stylish hat. So I have come up with a simple solution, which is to\
    \ turn your vase into a hat.\nThe first thing to do is to remove from the vase\
    \ the flowers lodged in it. Without water and bionutriment they will soon die,\
    \ but you must get your priorities right. Later you will have time to weep over\
    \ them. For now, however, you also need to empty the vase of said water and bionutriment,\
    \ so upend the vase and pour the w and the b down the sink. If you are so poor\
    \ that you have no sink, go outside and empty the vase into a ditch.\nYou must\
    \ ensure that the innards of the vase are clean and dry, so wrap some rags about\
    \ your fist and plunge your arm into the vase, then make the sort of motion with\
    \ your hand as you would were you whisking eggs. If the neck of the vase is too\
    \ narrow for your arm to fit inside it, tie the rags to a stick and poke the stick\
    \ into the vase instead.\nNow turn the vase upside down. Go and get some butchers\u2019\
    \ string. You will be using this to create a loop or lanyard, fixed to the vase,\
    \ to be tucked under your chin, in order to steady the \u201Chat\u201D on your\
    \ head and ensure it does not topple and smash upon the floor, embarrassingly,\
    \ just at the moment you are presented to the king, or handed a cocktail, or asked\
    \ to draw the raffle at a function. Cut the required length of butchers\u2019\
    \ string and then dip each end into a pan of the homemade glue you will have boiled\
    \ up earlier. Press the sticky ends to the vase, holding them in place until they\
    \ are stuck fast. Try a few experimental tugs to ensure the string is secure.\
    \ You can now place the vase\u2014still upside down, remember!\u2014upon your\
    \ bonce, and adjust the lanyard under your chin. There, you have a stylish hat.\n\
    But waste not, want not. You still have a lot of glue in the pan, so gather such\
    \ items as fruit and glitter and decorative baubles and smashed-up mirror fragments\
    \ and stick those chaotically all over the vase. Now it is even more stylish,\
    \ and when you sweep elegantly into the levee or party or function, all eyes will\
    \ be on your hat.\nAfterwards, unless you expect another invitation in the very\
    \ near future, you will probably want to put the vase back on your windowsill\
    \ or mantelpiece and place within it fresh flowers grown on your sordid little\
    \ allotment. Before doing so, you should remove the butchers\u2019 string and\
    \ the fruit and the glitter and the decorative baubles and the smashed-up mirror\
    \ fragments. If the glue you boiled is of incredible adhesiveness, this will be\
    \ quite a difficult task. But there is always a price to pay to achieve style\
    \ and dash, as I know from my own experience, the telling of which would make\
    \ you shudder.\nNext week, teabag as lampshade."
