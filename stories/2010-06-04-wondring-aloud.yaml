text: 'As I lumber about this world of ours, by turns perky and despondent, I often
  find myself wondering if it would be possible to enjoy all the comforts of twenty-first
  century western civilisation were I to be uprooted and cast, by some inexplicable
  agency, to live out the rest of my days on one of those far distant giant gas planets.

  Probably not.'
