  text: 'As I lumber about this world of ours, by turns perky and despondent, I often
    find myself wondering if it would be possible to enjoy all the comforts of twenty-first
    century western civilisation were I to be uprooted and cast, by some inexplicable
    agency, to live out the rest of my days on one of those far distant giant gas
    planets.

    Probably not.'
