  text: "1. A very poor child, of the parish of Newington-Butts\u2026 was a very monster\
    \ of wickedness, and a thousand times more miserable and vile by his sin than\
    \ by his poverty. He was running to hell as fast as he could go, and was old in\
    \ vice when he was but young in years: we scarcely hear of one so like the devil\
    \ in his infancy as was this poor child. What sin was there that his age was capable\
    \ of, which he did not commit? What by the corruption of his nature, and the abominable\
    \ example of little beggar boys, he was indeed arrived at a great pitch of impiety.\
    \ He would call names, take God's name in vain, curse, swear, and do all kinds\
    \ of mischief; and as to any thing of God, he was worse than a heathen\u2026\n\
    6. He was in grievous agonies of spirit; his former sins stared him in the face,\
    \ and made him tremble. The poison of God's arrows did even drink up his spirits;\
    \ the sense of sin and of wrath were so great that he knew not what to do. The\
    \ weight of God's displeasure, and the thought of lying under it to all eternity,\
    \ broke him even to pieces, and he bitterly cried out, \u201CWhat shall I do!\
    \ I am a miserable sinner, and I fear that I shall go to hell.\u201D His sins\
    \ had been so great and so many, that there was no hope for him\u2026\n14. The\
    \ Wednesday before he died, he lay in a trance for about half an hour, in which\
    \ time he thought he saw a vision of angels\u2026\n16 \u2026he gave a kind of\
    \ leap in his bed, and snapped his finger and thumb together with abundance of\
    \ joy. And from that time forward, in full joy and assurance of God's love, he\
    \ continued earnestly praising God, desiring to die, and to be with Christ.\n\
