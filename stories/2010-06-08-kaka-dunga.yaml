  text: 'It is a little over three years since we learned that Crouch is big threat
    says Kaka. Now things have taken a further turn. According to today''s inky bulletin,
    Kaka might claim he is in shape but Dunga is bound to be uneasy. There are two
    things of immediate note. First, Kaka has gained an accent over his final A, although
    we are not told what he has done to deserve this. Secondly, the threat of Crouch
    has not merely receded but vanished entirely, supplanted by the uneasiness of
    Dunga. Dunga does not have an accent on his A, which may account in part for his
    nerviness, born as it may be from envy of Kaka''s newly acquired accent. The obliterated
    Crouch, without an A to his name, was never going to be accorded an accent, and
    in any case at the time he was considered a threat by Kaka, Kaka himself was accentless.
    It may well be that the threat of Crouch and the unease of Dunga have nothing
    whatsoever to do with accents over As. Further work must be done before drawing
    a watertight conclusion.

    So what are we to make of Kaka''s claim to be "in shape"? It is surely pertinent
    that the shape itself goes unmentioned. Triangle? Oblong? Dodecahedron? Or perhaps
    even mere blob? This could be the true source of Dunga''s unease. Dunga may also
    be wondering what happened to Crouch, of course. Three years ago, Crouch was a
    big threat--or was at least perceived as such by Kaka, as he was then--and now,
    pfft!, he is nowhere to be seen, Kaka meanwhile having clambered into, or been
    ingested by, an undefined "shape". This would make any of us uneasy, so we ought
    not tsk tsk at Dunga for a wholly natural reaction. And we should mark well that
    not only is Dunga uneasy, he is bound to be uneasy. He has no choice in the matter.
    His uneasiness has been thrust upon him, whatever his feelings in the matter,
    by this claim of Kaka''s, a claim made, we take it, from within a shape, a shape
    of which we know little, if anything. You or I would, I''ll warrant, be uneasy.
    How much more so, then, Dunga, even without the vanished threat of Crouch?

    These are deep matters, to be sure, and there will no doubt be further developments
    in the coming weeks. We must do our best to keep abreast of them, and treat them
    with the gravity they deserve.'
