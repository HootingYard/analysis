  text: 'While the alignment of tree clumps in the West Kent area has rightly attracted
    the attention of some our most sensible investigators, the alignment of tree clumps
    in the East Kent area has been criminally neglected--until now. One of the most
    startling findings of the recent Blotzmann study, published in Tree Clump Alignment
    News, is that the alignment of the tree clumps in the eastern part of the county
    is significantly more intriguing than the alignment of tree clumps in the western
    part of the county. Studied from one angle, for example, a particular set of eastern
    tree clumps is identical to the alignment of Abraham Zapruder, Badge Man, Umbrella
    Man, Marymoon Man, JFK, and the sixth floor window of the Texas Schoolbook Depository
    at the precise moment the first shot was fired on that fateful November day in
    1963 in Dallas. Viewed from a different angle, the very same tree clumps are aligned
    in a pattern one can only call chaotic. A second set of tree clumps, more easterly
    in Kent than the so called "Assassination Clumps", reproduces exactly the disposition
    of the players on the pitch at the moment when South Africa scored the opening
    goal in the 2010 World Cup, a goal described calmly by the television commentator
    as "one of the most important moments in the entire history of sport". Yet, again,
    seen from another angle these very same tree clumps form merely a random pattern.

    The various angles to which I refer are those obtaining between the tree clumps
    on the ground and the position of the Blotzmann Tree Clump Project airship in
    the sky. Obviously, the position of the tree clumps on the ground is fixed, while
    the position of the airship in the sky is variable. I probably do not need to
    explain this, but am doing so in case you are extremely stupid. Those of you who
    believe that tree clumps on the ground are not stationary may have been malignly
    influenced by great works of literature, such as Macbeth, or infantile pieces
    of tosh, like all that Tolkien twaddle. If you happen to live in the East Kent
    area you may have seen the Blotzmann dirigible hovering at varying points in the
    sky. It looks not unlike the ill-fated Hindenburg (without the inferno of flames,
    obviously) although it is clearly identifiable from the word BLOTZMANN in big
    bold block capital letters emblazoned across its side. It does not identify itself
    specifically as the Tree Clump Project airship, for it is used in many another
    of Blotzmann''s exciting activities, at least in those which require an airship
    for their completion and hoped-for success.

    From the above it should be clear that proper perception of the alignment of the
    East Kent tree clumps depends to a large extent on the altitude and position of
    the airship. At ground level, it is almost impossible to appreciate the significant
    patterns created by the tree clumps. One can trudge about in one''s rambling gear
    among the "Assassination Clumps" or the "History Of Sport Clumps", or indeed among
    the other tree clumps I have not mentioned, and be none the wiser. That is why
    we should be grateful to Blotzmann for making such admirable use of his airship,
    rather than leaving it neglected in its giant hangar, as some other airship owners
    do. I am not naming names, but they know who they are.

    Blotzmann''s interest in the alignment of tree clumps in the East Kent area was
    prompted not, surprisingly, by Tony Wedd''s important study of the alignment of
    tree clumps in the West Kent area, but by a stray reference in a yellowing old
    copy of the St Bibblybibdib''s Parish Magazine And Religious Tirade, where a writer
    identified only as "Righteous Wanderer In The Woods" makes mention of a wander
    in the woods when his righteousness was tempted by some sort of hobgoblin tree
    spirit, green and pagan and covered in leaves and twigs. The author claims that,
    after fleeing from this sprite in fear for his immortal soul, he lay in the bath
    and realised that the trajectory of his fleeing, if represented in diagrammatic
    form, was analagous to the pattern made by a journeyman hiking between the cantons
    of Switzerland in alphabetical order. Blotzmann made the intuitive leap, in reading
    this, to a recognition that further significant patterns could reveal themselves
    through close study of the alignment of such things as tree clumps, piles of pebbles,
    and even the distribution across the landscape of airship hangars.

    It is the latter to which he will next turn his attention, and I am proud to say
    that, before taking off in the Blotzmann airship, he will be making much use of
    my database of hangars, which I compiled in order to fire off a series of sternly-worded
    poison pen letters to their owners. For the benefit of readers I would have liked
    to transcribe one of the letters here. Alas, they proved so toxic as to be lethal,
    and I would not wish any of you to keel over and perish, like a budgerigar zapped
    by a death ray.'
