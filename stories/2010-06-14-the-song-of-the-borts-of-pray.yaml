  text: "\nThis is Hadrian Beverland (c.1651\u20131716), accompanied by \u201Ca wanton\
    \ woman\u201D. Beverland was a theologian of sorts and a classical scholar of\
    \ great erudition. His book detailing the sexual abnormalities of the ancient\
    \ world was described as \u201Cabominable and scandalous\u201D and \u201Can abortion\
    \ from depraved brains\u201D by the authorities of Leyden University, and he was\
    \ banished from Holland. He spent much of the rest of his life in London and is\
    \ buried in the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent Garden.\nHe made various attempts\
    \ to gain permission to return to his homeland, and when these failed he developed\
    \ a persecution mania to which he gave vent in a series of pamphlets. These take\
    \ the form of letters to him from the fictitious Perin de Vago, together with\
    \ Beverland's responses. Beverland was particularly exercised by a certain Tempest,\
    \ \u201Cthat curst flatterer\u201D and \u201Cprophanest Reprobat\u201D who \u201C\
    tried to make a Tennissball of a Foreigner\u201D. Tempest sent \u201CGirrls into\
    \ the Fiels, who with a wanton eye could move olds mens entrails\u201D and \u201C\
    Wensches with Linnen Oisters and Orang Appels who breathe life into Deathmen\u201D\
    . \u201CAlackaday,\u201D he complained, \u201Conly for loaking fresh in a frosty\
    \ evening you must be suspected to be a Deboche.\u201D Others apart from \u201C\
    the Gnat Tempest\u201D were scheming against him, and \u201CIf the Mystery of\
    \ the Plot lies hidden in the bottom of Hell, it will not only be difficult to\
    \ draw it out of the Dunghill, but also dangerous to disturb the Dragons, Snakes\
    \ and Hornets. Let them Lices who suk their livelyhood out of our carcass glorys\
    \ in their guile. You avoid their Companye.\u201D\nTowards the end of his life\
    \ Beverland prepared a catalogue of his collection of paintings for sale, in which\
    \ he included this verse:\n(The Song of the Borts of pray,) I have no Wife / The\
    \ Devil Upon Two Crutches / Chear! Chear! / Hier / Carry me to Hell. / I do not\
    \ know my L. where Hell is: But if it may please your L. I carry you to the Devil.\
    \ / Go unto the Devil Tavern. / What upon Crutches! / I am very Old, if it may\
    \ please your L. / No Old Devil can please me. Have you no younger Devils in Hell?\
    \ / Yes, Long Brown, who carries little Davits upon his Shoulders: / What is become\
    \ of little Gibson?"
