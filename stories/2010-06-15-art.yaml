    the hours here.


    Should you find yourself spending far too long there, bear in mind, as I now do,
    these wise words from Peter De Vries, in The Prick Of Noon (1985): "I too believe
    in every kind of experimentation, freedom for the artist to shovel on reds and
    greens and oranges and purples in any quantity and as higgledy-piggledy as he
    wishes. But somewhere he''s got to draw a line."'
