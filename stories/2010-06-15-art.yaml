  text: "Thanks to my son Ed, I have discovered just how easy it is to fritter away\
    \ the hours here.\n\nShould you find yourself spending far too long there, bear\
    \ in mind, as I now do, these wise words from Peter De Vries, in The Prick Of\
    \ Noon (1985): \u201CI too believe in every kind of experimentation, freedom for\
    \ the artist to shovel on reds and greens and oranges and purples in any quantity\
    \ and as higgledy-piggledy as he wishes. But somewhere he's got to draw a line.\u201D"
