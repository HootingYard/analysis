  text: "\u201CClicking the link would have been a letdown\u201D noted Glyn Webster\
    \ in the email to which he attached this screenshot:\n\nHe may be right, and life\
    \ is too short to follow up every damned link thrown at us by Google. But I confess\
    \ I am very intrigued. In a world of fluffyheads, pseudoscientists, conspiracy\
    \ theorists, theocratic nutters and whatnot, who would have thought that the greatest\
    \ and most dangerous enemy of Reason is poultry? This calls for proper investigation,\
    \ before the majestic achievements of the Enlightenment are brought crashing to\
    \ the ground by vengeful and unreasonable hens. Fear not\u2014Mr Key is on the\
    \ case!\nI suppose one can take a crumb of comfort from the doubt implicit in\
    \ the question mark appended to the caption. Nevertheless, until I am able to\
    \ bring you further revelations, keep a beady eye on any poultry you come across.\
    \ Meanwhile, I shall begin by looking up what Diderot had to say about hens, to\
    \ discover if he had any inklings of the threat.\nUPDATE\_: Hmm, this could prove\
    \ significant. In D'Alembert's Dream (1769), Diderot has Bordeu say this\_: \u201C\
    But here's a strange fact which countless educated people will tell you is true\
    \ but which is false, namely, that in the poultry yard of the archduke they've\
    \ seen a disgusting rabbit who used to act as a cock and service around twenty\
    \ shameless hens who were happy with the arrangement. The people will add that\
    \ they have been shown some chickens covered with fur which were the products\
    \ of this bestiality. You can be sure they were ridiculed.\u201D\nClearly my next\
    \ step must be to conduct a rigorous survey of the poultry yards of archdukes."
