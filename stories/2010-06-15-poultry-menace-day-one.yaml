  text: '"Clicking the link would have been a letdown" noted Glyn Webster in the email
    to which he attached this screenshot:


    He may be right, and life is too short to follow up every damned link thrown at
    us by Google. But I confess I am very intrigued. In a world of fluffyheads, pseudoscientists,
    conspiracy theorists, theocratic nutters and whatnot, who would have thought that
    the greatest and most dangerous enemy of Reason is poultry? This calls for proper
    investigation, before the majestic achievements of the Enlightenment are brought
    crashing to the ground by vengeful and unreasonable hens. Fear not--Mr Key is
    on the case!

    I suppose one can take a crumb of comfort from the doubt implicit in the question
    mark appended to the caption. Nevertheless, until I am able to bring you further
    revelations, keep a beady eye on any poultry you come across. Meanwhile, I shall
    begin by looking up what Diderot had to say about hens, to discover if he had
    any inklings of the threat.

    UPDATE : Hmm, this could prove significant. In D''Alembert''s Dream (1769), Diderot
    has Bordeu say this : "But here''s a strange fact which countless educated people
    will tell you is true but which is false, namely, that in the poultry yard of
    the archduke they''ve seen a disgusting rabbit who used to act as a cock and service
    around twenty shameless hens who were happy with the arrangement. The people will
    add that they have been shown some chickens covered with fur which were the products
    of this bestiality. You can be sure they were ridiculed."

    Clearly my next step must be to conduct a rigorous survey of the poultry yards
    of archdukes.'
