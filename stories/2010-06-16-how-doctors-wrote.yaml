  text: "\u201CThe antiquarian may take his stand upon Mam-Tor, the mother rock, when\
    \ the moon sheds her silvery light o'er Loosehill Mount, and, carrying his mind\
    \ back into the past some 230 years, hear the bugle's note as it sweeps through\
    \ the Wynnats Pass, and is taken up by the Peverel Castle and transmitted onwards\
    \ through the Vale of Hope, calling the hardy dalesmen to their midnight rendezvous,\
    \ there to be instructed in the science of war, so as to enable them to protect\
    \ their homes and families against the marauding myrmidons of a cruel, heartless,\
    \ and unreliable king; or if the antiquarian seeketh a knowledge of the High Peak\
    \ folk-lore, and feareth neither pixie or graymarie, he can, on a spring night,\
    \ just as the moon has entered her last quarter, and the first note from the belfry\
    \ of the chapel in the frith has proclaimed the arrival of midnight, take his\
    \ stand upon Blentford's Bluff and peer into the dark and sombre depths of Kinder,\
    \ when he will hear the hooting of the barn owl on Anna rocks, the unearthly screech\
    \ of the landrail as he ploughs his way through the unmown grass in search of\
    \ his mate, the scream of the curlew and chatter of the red grouse as they take\
    \ their flight from peak to peak, and see the fairy queen come forth from the\
    \ mermaid's cave in a shimmering light, followed by her maids, who dance a quadrille\
    \ to the music of the spheres, and hear the wild blast of the hunter's horn heralding\
    \ the approach of the Gabriel hounds as they take their rapid course across the\
    \ murky sky, and become lost in the unfathomable depths beyond the Scout.\u201D\
    \nRobert Ottiwell Gifford-Bennet, M.D., Senior Acting Physician To The Devonshire\
    \ Hospital And Buxton Bath Charity, Buxton And Its Medicinal Waters (1892)"
