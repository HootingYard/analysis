  text: '"A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" is perhaps Gertrude Stein''s most
    memorable utterance. It first appeared in the 1913 poem Sacred Emily (published
    in 1922 in the collection Geography And Plays) as "Rose is a rose is a rose is
    a rose", the first Rose being a proper name. There are other lines in the poem
    of which I am very fond, including:

    It is rose in hen... Weeds without papers are necessary... Humming does as humming
    is... Electrics are tight electrics are white electrics are a button...  A very
    reasonable berry... A coral neck and a little song so very extra so very Susie...
    Cow come out cow come out and out and smell a little... Websters and mines, websters
    and mines... Cunning piler... Thimble of everything.

    ADDENDUM : For more about Gertrude Stein and cows, go here.'
