  text: "\u201CIt is bootless to pine after knowledge irretrievably buried in oblivion.\
    \ Otherwise we might fairly have wished to have stood beside King Nebuchadnezzar\
    \ when he so unadvisedly uttered that proud vaunt which ended in his being condemned\
    \ to a long course of vegetable diet.\u201D\nWilliam Bodham Donne, Old Roads And\
    \ New Roads (1852)"
