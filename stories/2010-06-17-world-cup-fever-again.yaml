  text: 'We know that the important thing about any televised foopball match is the
    demented wittering of the commentators. The 2010 World Cup has, in that sense,
    reached its climax with just a week of matches played. For I do not believe any
    commentator, however bonkers, will be able to better the stupendous words declaimed
    during tonight''s France v. Mexico tie:

    "For a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who''d just plopped out of
    the womb."'
