  text: "Someone drew to my attention that all this business about Kak\xE1 and Dunga\
    \ and Crouch could be related to the World Cup, so I embarked upon a spot of research.\
    \ What I found was some spectacular nonsense (splendidly dealt with here\u2014\
    note particularly the closing paragraph) and some spectacular sense (note particularly\
    \ the correct, Molesworthian spelling of foopball)."
