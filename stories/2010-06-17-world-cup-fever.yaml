  text: Someone drew to my attention that all this business about Kaka and Dunga and
    Crouch could be related to the World Cup, so I embarked upon a spot of research.
    What I found was some spectacular nonsense (splendidly dealt with here--note particularly
    the closing paragraph) and some spectacular sense (note particularly the correct,
    Molesworthian spelling of foopball).
