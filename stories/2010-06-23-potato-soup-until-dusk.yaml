  text: "A marked lack of activity in the Key cranium these past few days, I'm afraid,\
    \ though there is some prose in progress. Meanwhile, here is something I learned\
    \ that I think worthy of further attention.\nIn Voodoo Histories\_: The Role Of\
    \ The Conspiracy Theory In Shaping Modern History (2009), David Aaronovitch mentions\
    \ in passing \u201Can incident in the small town of Mosinee, Wisconsin, where\
    \ in 1950 veterans from the American Legion disguised as Russian soldiers took\
    \ over the town, arrested the mayor, imprisoned the clergy, nationalised businesses\
    \ and allowed only potato soup to be served in the cafes, before allowing everyone\
    \ to be liberated from communism at dusk.\u201D"
