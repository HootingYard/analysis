  text: 'A marked lack of activity in the Key cranium these past few days, I''m afraid,
    though there is some prose in progress. Meanwhile, here is something I learned
    that I think worthy of further attention.

    In Voodoo Histories : The Role Of The Conspiracy Theory In Shaping Modern History
    (2009), David Aaronovitch mentions in passing "an incident in the small town of
    Mosinee, Wisconsin, where in 1950 veterans from the American Legion disguised
    as Russian soldiers took over the town, arrested the mayor, imprisoned the clergy,
    nationalised businesses and allowed only potato soup to be served in the cafes,
    before allowing everyone to be liberated from communism at dusk."'
