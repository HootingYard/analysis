  text: '"Ordnance Survey Map 104 : Leeds and Bradford... It''s a riot of names that
    could be nowhere else but Yorkshire: villages such as Luddendon Foot, Mytholmroyd,
    Farsley Beck Bottom, Wibsey, Odsal, Idle, Owlet, Harden, Greetland, Rastrick,
    Ossett, Soothill, Scarcroft, Wike, Kirkby Overblow, Spofforth, Scriven, Blubberhouses,
    Stainburn, Birstwith, Thwaites Brow, Cringles, Glusburn and Goose Eye--a list
    that sounds more like entries in a dictionary of Dickensian ailments."
