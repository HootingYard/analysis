  text: Here at Hooting Yard we rarely take note of tennis tournaments, but let it
    be recorded that Tsvetana Pironkova, who surprisingly knocked Venus Williams out
    of the Women's Singles at Wimbledon yesterday, hails from Plovdiv in Bulgaria.
    No doubt the plucky giant-killer was inspired by the Plovdiv Central Post Office
    mural painted by Georgi Bozhilov, a member of the legendary Plovdiv Fivesome.
    Perhaps, too, she grew up listening to the stories of Ugo and his blind Ma and
    his pal Ulf in Old Plovdiv. I like to think she owes her success to these things,
    which have been given the all-important Hooting Yard imprimatur.
