  text: 'I do not often contribute to the Comments threads on blogs. Whether this
    is a character flaw or a virtue I am not sure. Probably it is sheer idleness.
    However, up bright and early this morning I turned to Peter Hitchens'' latest
    postage over at the Mail Online, and came upon this sentence:

    Seeing several of [Mary Renault''s] books at bargain prices, I stuffed them in
    my backpack and began reading (as it happened) ''The King Must Die'' as I waited
    for a delayed train on a country platform.

    I could not let this pass without comment. So I commented:

    Mr Hitchens : I really must take issue with your use of the word "backpack". It
    ill becomes you. "Backpack" is a barbaric neologism used by young persons, often
    those on so-called "gap years". In future, please ensure you use one of the three--yes,
    three!--acceptable alternatives, "rucksack", "haversack", or--my personal preference--"knapsack".

    These words of wisdom are awaiting moderation, but I hope to see them appear soon.
    Peter Hitchens is one of the few mainstream press bloggers who engages fully,
    indeed robustly, with his readers, so I also hope to see his grovelling mea culpa
    before too long.'
