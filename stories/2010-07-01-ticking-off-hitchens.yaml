  text: "I do not often contribute to the Comments threads on blogs. Whether this\
    \ is a character flaw or a virtue I am not sure. Probably it is sheer idleness.\
    \ However, up bright and early this morning I turned to Peter Hitchens\u2019 latest\
    \ postage over at the Mail Online, and came upon this sentence:\nSeeing several\
    \ of [Mary Renault's] books at bargain prices, I stuffed them in my backpack and\
    \ began reading (as it happened) \u2018The King Must Die\u2019 as I waited for\
    \ a delayed train on a country platform.\nI could not let this pass without comment.\
    \ So I commented:\nMr Hitchens\_: I really must take issue with your use of the\
    \ word \u201Cbackpack\u201D. It ill becomes you. \u201CBackpack\u201D is a barbaric\
    \ neologism used by young persons, often those on so-called \u201Cgap years\u201D\
    . In future, please ensure you use one of the three\u2014yes, three!\u2014acceptable\
    \ alternatives, \u201Crucksack\u201D, \u201Chaversack\u201D, or\u2014my personal\
    \ preference\u2014\u201Cknapsack\u201D.\nThese words of wisdom are awaiting moderation,\
    \ but I hope to see them appear soon. Peter Hitchens is one of the few mainstream\
    \ press bloggers who engages fully, indeed robustly, with his readers, so I also\
    \ hope to see his grovelling mea culpa before too long."
