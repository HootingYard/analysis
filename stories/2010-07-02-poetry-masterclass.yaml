  text: 'Warning by Jenny Joseph is, apparently, Britain''s best-loved postwar poem.
    It is said to be "life-affirming". Pah! Who needs life to be affirmed when, as
    Dr Malcolm said, and as we all know, "life will find a way"? Anyway, let''s take
    a look at the poem, shall we?

    When I am an old woman I shall wear purple

    Well, I am not a woman, but I am old, and I''m not wearing purple. I am not Erik
    Satie, for god''s sake.

    With a red hat which doesn''t go, and doesn''t suit me.

    The only people who habitually wear red hats are cardinals of the Roman Catholic
    Church. At the time of writing, women, whether old or young, are not allowed to
    become priests, let alone cardinals, so there is some kind of cognitive dissonance
    going on here.

    And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves / And satin sandals,
    and say we''ve no money for butter.

    This demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of Bismarck''s domestic policy in
    late 19th century Germany. It was guns before butter, not brandy and gloves and
    footwear. What sort of nation state can you expect to build if everybody totters
    around in a stupor brought on by spiritous liquor, decked out like the most foolish
    of New Romantics?

    I shall sit down on the pavement when I''m tired

    Actually, that''s fair enough. So that line can stand. But only that one, so far.

    And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells / And run my stick along
    the public railings / And make up for the sobriety of my youth.

    No you bloody well won''t, because you''re slumped on the pavement, or preferably
    in the gutter, remember? You''re far too tired to get up and start charging around
    the place as described here, because your tiny brain is exhausted from all that
    catch-up reading you''ve had to do to correct your misunderstanding of German
    history.

    I shall go out in my slippers in the rain / And pick flowers in other people''s
    gardens /And learn to spit.

    Nobody learns to spit. You just spit. In any case, whether learned or innate,
    if you spit and steal you will get an Asbo, and so you should. Carry on, and you''ll
    be banged up in a large concrete building with iron bars on the windows and made
    to sew mailbags until you die, whereupon you''ll be buried in an unmarked grave
    over which quicklime will be poured to hasten your dissolution. (I may have an
    outmoded view of prison conditions, but a man can dream.)

    You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat

    Oh, so all of a sudden this is about me? It''s all very well casting aspersions
    upon my majestic dress sense etcetera from behind prison walls, but I''m not the
    one forced to wear a rough sackcloth uniform covered in arrows and withering away
    on a bread and water diet. (See above re: prison conditions.)

    And eat three pounds of sausages at a go

    Yes, thank you, I will eat as many sausages as I like. That line can stand.

    Or only bread and pickle for a week

    You don''t understand German history, and you don''t listen. I have no idea where
    you get the idea there might be pickles on the menu. See above--bread and water,
    not bread and pickle.

    And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.

    Stationery is fine, but you won''t need a beermat for your rusty beaker of water,
    and what in heaven''s name are these "things" in boxes? Lovecraftian monsters
    with suckers and antennae? You''ve got another thing coming if you think they''ll
    stay happily boxed up. As soon as you turn your back they will burst from their
    confines and latch on to your throat and drain the lifeblood from you, what''s
    left of it. And they will make an absolutely terrifying noise while they do so.

    But now we must have clothes that keep us dry / And pay our rent and not swear
    in the street / And set a good example for the children.

    Pure wishful thinking, given that you are sprawled on the cold stone floor of
    your prison cell with a hideous alien being that defies all known organic lineaments
    wrapped around your neck sucking your blood and slowly, slowly crushing the last
    breath out of you.

    We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.

    By "the papers" I assume you mean those academic papers about Bismarck that you
    ought to have been reading when you still had the chance. Too late, too late.

    But maybe I ought to practise a little now?

    No.

    So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised / When suddenly I am old,
    and start to wear purple.

    Yeah, yeah, and I''m Erik Satie. Get a grip, for god''s sake.

    Thus we are left with two lines of clarity from all this delusional twaddle:

    I shall sit down on the pavement when I''m tired / And eat three pounds of sausages
    at a go

    And that can be cut to make it more punchy:

    I shall sit down  / And eat sausages

    Now that is a poem the nation can be proud of!'
