  text: "\u201CI have had what, in many respects, I boldly call the misfortune, to\
    \ set my words sometimes prettily together ; not without a foolish vanity in the\
    \ poor knack that I had of doing so ; until I was heavily punished for this pride,\
    \ by finding that many people thought of the words only, and cared nothing for\
    \ their meaning.\u201D\nJohn Ruskin, The Mystery Of Life And Its Arts (1868)\n\
    No such problem for Mr Key, I am happy to say, for judging by my bulging postbag,\
    \ almost all of my readers devote many hours to cogitating upon the meaning\u2014\
    indeed the multiple meanings\u2014of each and every postage at Hooting Yard. But\
    \ just in case there are one or two of you out there who still, tragically, overlook\
    \ significance at the expense of verbal blather, I thought it would be helpful\
    \ to pluck from that postbag one pertinent letter, and reproduce it in full. It\
    \ is from Tim Thurn, who can often be a picky wanker, but whose devotion to Hooting\
    \ Yard has never been in doubt.\nAhoy there, Frank! he writes, I thought you might\
    \ be interested to hear about the little routine I have devised for myself to\
    \ help me winkle out the deep and deeper meanings of your many and various postages.\
    \ This is what I do. As soon as I have finished reading, I get up from my chair\
    \ and go straight to the bathroom, wherein I fill the sink with ice cold water,\
    \ steep in it a towel, and then wrap the towel tight about my head. This is to\
    \ prevent my brain from overheating. I next gargle with Dr Baxter's Effervescent\
    \ & Volatile Gargling Fluid, and cut a few capers while gargling, though the vigour\
    \ of my capers is constrained somewhat by the cramped dimensions of my bathroom.\n\
    The next step is to go down to my cellar, a dank pit which light never penetrates,\
    \ and to lie sprawled on the floor. Before sprawling, however, I fumble about\
    \ in the blackness to locate my vintage bakelite cassette player, and depress\
    \ the knob which sets the tape going. The tape, which is a loop and which is thus\
    \ always ready to play, is a recording of the Urbane Blodgett Sextet performing\
    \ the song cycle Drink Ye Every One The Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come\
    \ And Take You Away. I don't know why, but I find this music perfectly suited\
    \ to the cogitations I must now embark upon while sprawled in the darkness. The\
    \ Sextet's lean and flashy songs grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw,\
    \ which is my kind-a music!\nHours may pass as I plumb the depths of my mental\
    \ basin, thinking over the Hooting Yard postage I lately read. Sooner or later,\
    \ the meaning, or meanings, become clear, and not just clear but incandescent.\
    \ It is almost as if there is actual light in the cellar. Almost. I fumble for\
    \ the cassette player, press the stop knob, and blunder my way up and out. The\
    \ towel around my head is usually still damp, so I wring it out over the bathroom\
    \ sink and hang it up to dry before dashing out into the streets to buttonhole\
    \ passers-by with an excitable account of my new knowledge.\nI thoroughly recommend\
    \ this method of discovering the many, many profundities inherent in the Hooting\
    \ Yard oeuvre, and I am so grateful to you, Mr Key, that I am even tempted to\
    \ make a donation. But only tempted, for on reflection I much prefer to wallow\
    \ in a puddle of moral turpitude and filth, like the sordid ingrate I am.\nPassionately\
    \ yours, Tim Thurn"
