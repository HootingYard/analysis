  text: '"I have had what, in many respects, I boldly call the misfortune, to set
    my words sometimes prettily together ; not without a foolish vanity in the poor
    knack that I had of doing so ; until I was heavily punished for this pride, by
    finding that many people thought of the words only, and cared nothing for their
    meaning."

    John Ruskin, The Mystery Of Life And Its Arts (1868)

    No such problem for Mr Key, I am happy to say, for judging by my bulging postbag,
    almost all of my readers devote many hours to cogitating upon the meaning--indeed
    the multiple meanings--of each and every postage at Hooting Yard. But just in
    case there are one or two of you out there who still, tragically, overlook significance
    at the expense of verbal blather, I thought it would be helpful to pluck from
    that postbag one pertinent letter, and reproduce it in full. It is from Tim Thurn,
    who can often be a picky wanker, but whose devotion to Hooting Yard has never
    been in doubt.

    Ahoy there, Frank! he writes, I thought you might be interested to hear about
    the little routine I have devised for myself to help me winkle out the deep and
    deeper meanings of your many and various postages. This is what I do. As soon
    as I have finished reading, I get up from my chair and go straight to the bathroom,
    wherein I fill the sink with ice cold water, steep in it a towel, and then wrap
    the towel tight about my head. This is to prevent my brain from overheating. I
    next gargle with Dr Baxter''s Effervescent & Volatile Gargling Fluid, and cut
    a few capers while gargling, though the vigour of my capers is constrained somewhat
    by the cramped dimensions of my bathroom.

    The next step is to go down to my cellar, a dank pit which light never penetrates,
    and to lie sprawled on the floor. Before sprawling, however, I fumble about in
    the blackness to locate my vintage bakelite cassette player, and depress the knob
    which sets the tape going. The tape, which is a loop and which is thus always
    ready to play, is a recording of the Urbane Blodgett Sextet performing the song
    cycle Drink Ye Every One The Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come And Take
    You Away. I don''t know why, but I find this music perfectly suited to the cogitations
    I must now embark upon while sprawled in the darkness. The Sextet''s lean and
    flashy songs grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw, which is my kind-a
    music!

    Hours may pass as I plumb the depths of my mental basin, thinking over the Hooting
    Yard postage I lately read. Sooner or later, the meaning, or meanings, become
    clear, and not just clear but incandescent. It is almost as if there is actual
    light in the cellar. Almost. I fumble for the cassette player, press the stop
    knob, and blunder my way up and out. The towel around my head is usually still
    damp, so I wring it out over the bathroom sink and hang it up to dry before dashing
    out into the streets to buttonhole passers-by with an excitable account of my
    new knowledge.

    I thoroughly recommend this method of discovering the many, many profundities
    inherent in the Hooting Yard oeuvre, and I am so grateful to you, Mr Key, that
    I am even tempted to make a donation. But only tempted, for on reflection I much
    prefer to wallow in a puddle of moral turpitude and filth, like the sordid ingrate
    I am.

    Passionately yours, Tim Thurn'
