    Dannatt... Susannah York... Rt Hon Sir John Major... Prunella Scales... Frederick
    Forsyth... Sir Michael Caine... Sir Richard Branson... Joanna Lumley... Nicholas
    Parsons... Stephen Fry... Frank Key. Oo-er, missus!

    Your favourite impoverished scribbler is in this august company as a contributor
    to that recipe book I was telling you about a few weeks ago, in connection with
    my participation in a broadcast by Phil Minton''s Feral Choir. Mr Minton''s recipe,
    Deptford Squat Stir-Fry, is truly sensational.

    The book is Able To Cook, and all proceeds go to the charities Age UK Norfolk
    and Connects & Co. I command, by diktat, all readers to go here, immediately,
    and buy a copy.


    My thanks to R., by the way.'
