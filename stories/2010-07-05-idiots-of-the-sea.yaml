  text: '"''Everything found on land is found in the sea.''...

    "Another day I was looking for somewhere to live and went in a north-westerly
    direction. From some dingy agent in the vicinity I got the key of a house to let.
    Wandering along the streets I came to a row of peeling stucco houses with cat-walks
    in front, and mouldering urns, which could hold nothing, surmounting their plastered
    gate-posts.

    "My key fitted the front door of one of these houses; I went in and up the stairs
    to the first floor. I entered a large room with three windows looking out upon
    the road; folding doors connected it with the room behind. These I pushed open
    and found myself in another room exactly like the first; I went over to the central
    one of its three windows and looked out. Instead of the characterless gardens
    and hinder facade of a parallel block, I saw a sloping strip of ground overgrown
    with brambles, then a pebbly shore, and beyond, the crash and smother of Atlantic
    waves, breaking ceaselessly and without tide. This ocean stretched away to the
    horizon where it met a misty sky, but did not merge with it--the heaving water
    set up a melancholy distinction out there; and here within, a briney exultant
    smell penetrated the panes, cutting through the mustiness of a house long closed.

    "What extraordinary growths, I wondered, flowered in those wasteful depths? There
    must be a submerged garden whose silken green held curiosities far surpassing
    those I had come upon before. Idiots often describe such places and describe what
    they see; making idiots is one of the sea''s favourite games. But when it tires
    from this from time to time, it casts up instead a supernatural being on an unwelcoming
    strand, who ever afterwards, spends his nights asleep at the bottom of some vast
    watery gulf."

    Ithell Colquhoun, Goose Of Hermogenes (1961)'
