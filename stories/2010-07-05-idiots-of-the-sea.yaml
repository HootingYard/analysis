  text: "\u201C\u2018Everything found on land is found in the sea.\u2019\u2026\n\u201C\
    Another day I was looking for somewhere to live and went in a north-westerly direction.\
    \ From some dingy agent in the vicinity I got the key of a house to let. Wandering\
    \ along the streets I came to a row of peeling stucco houses with cat-walks in\
    \ front, and mouldering urns, which could hold nothing, surmounting their plastered\
    \ gate-posts.\n\u201CMy key fitted the front door of one of these houses; I went\
    \ in and up the stairs to the first floor. I entered a large room with three windows\
    \ looking out upon the road; folding doors connected it with the room behind.\
    \ These I pushed open and found myself in another room exactly like the first;\
    \ I went over to the central one of its three windows and looked out. Instead\
    \ of the characterless gardens and hinder facade of a parallel block, I saw a\
    \ sloping strip of ground overgrown with brambles, then a pebbly shore, and beyond,\
    \ the crash and smother of Atlantic waves, breaking ceaselessly and without tide.\
    \ This ocean stretched away to the horizon where it met a misty sky, but did not\
    \ merge with it\u2014the heaving water set up a melancholy distinction out there;\
    \ and here within, a briney exultant smell penetrated the panes, cutting through\
    \ the mustiness of a house long closed.\n\u201CWhat extraordinary growths, I wondered,\
    \ flowered in those wasteful depths? There must be a submerged garden whose silken\
    \ green held curiosities far surpassing those I had come upon before. Idiots often\
    \ describe such places and describe what they see; making idiots is one of the\
    \ sea's favourite games. But when it tires from this from time to time, it casts\
    \ up instead a supernatural being on an unwelcoming strand, who ever afterwards,\
    \ spends his nights asleep at the bottom of some vast watery gulf.\u201D\nIthell\
    \ Colquhoun, Goose Of Hermogenes (1961)"
