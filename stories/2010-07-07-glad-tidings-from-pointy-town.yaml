  text: "Glad tidings from Pointy Town, where there has been a massive increase in\
    \ the number of applications to join the local chapter of the Tuesday Weld Fan\
    \ Club. You will recall that a troop of Pointy Town Weldists, on an ill-starr'd\
    \ charabanc outing, made an important archaeological discovery. If by chance you\
    \ do not recall it, I can refer you back to an account of it through the magic\
    \ of \u201Chet internet\u201D hyperlink.\nIncidentally, did you know that British\
    \ Telecom once tried\_\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014to claim copyright of the word\
    \ hyperlink? That is true, though you ought not believe similar stories, such\
    \ as Tesco laying claim to the phrase sausages on the cheap, The Grauniad trying\
    \ for muddle-headed leftie blather, or both the BBC and ITV attempting to copyright\
    \ maverick police officer with \u201Cissues\u201D.\nAnyway, it appears that the\
    \ tale of the finding of the tomb of Anaxagrotax has drummed up an unprecedented\
    \ amount of interest in the Tuesday Weld Fan Club, in spite of the fact that many\
    \ younger Pointy Towners have absolutely no idea who Tuesday Weld is. Perhaps\
    \ they think if they are allowed to join the club they will be taken on charabanc\
    \ outings by sinister, spidery drivers, although my understanding is that there\
    \ have been no excursions since the one reported here. In fact, there is some\
    \ mystery regarding the precise activities of the Fan Club, for they have held\
    \ no jamborees, jumble sales, Weldathons or film screenings for a very long time.\
    \ Even their newsletter, Weld!, published every week on Tuesday, has ceased to\
    \ appear in the newsagents\u2019 kiosks of Pointy Town.\nI did manage to track\
    \ down the minutes of the most recent executive committee meeting, but it was\
    \ difficult to wring any sense out of them. Take this, for example:\nWe lent our\
    \ ears to a man standing on one leg, who puffed upon a flute and called us fools.\
    \ When he did so, he stretched out the \u201Coo\u201D in \u201Cfools\u201D so\
    \ that it lasted several minutes. During the whole time he maintained his monopod\
    \ posture. Eventually, he was asked by Weldist No. 472 how this imprecation related\
    \ to Tuesday Weld. In reply, he gave another somewhat wheezy puff on his flute\
    \ and stole softly away, like Jack-in-the-Green.\nIs this evidence of some sort\
    \ of esoteric hoo-hah going on in the preciously staid atmosphere of the Tuesday\
    \ Weld Fan Club? Certainly the sheer numbers of new applicants suggest a coup\
    \ or takeover. But what in heaven's name could their agenda be? I shall keep a\
    \ beady, if myopic, eye on these matters, and may send Mrs Gubbins to be an infiltrator\
    \ among the infiltrators.\nMeanwhile, to keep you occupied while you await further\
    \ developments, here is a cut out \u2018n\u2019 keep Tuesday Weld to print, \u2018\
    n\u2019 cut out, \u2018n\u2019 keep upon your mantelpiece. Dust it often, and\
    \ dust it well.\n"
