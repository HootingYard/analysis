  text: 'It saddens me to report that weedy poet Dennis Beerpint has been caught red-handed
    in an act of plagiarism. His verse "The Fountainhead : Homage a Ayn Rand" from
    his well-received recent collection A Series Of Homages To Female Right-Wing Russo-American
    Postage Stamp Collectors was, it seems, lifted word for word from this paragraph
    in Compound Words : A Study Of The Principles Of Compounding, The Components Of
    Compounds, And The Use Of The Hyphen by Frederick W. Hamilton, LL. D., published
    in 1918 by the Committee on Education of the United Typothetae Of America:

    "41. Following is a list of words of everyday occurrence which should be hyphenated,
    and which do not fall under any of the above classifications.

    after-years food-stuff sea-level

    bas-relief guinea-pig sense-perception

    birth-rate horse-power son-in-law

    blood-relations loan-word subject-matter

    common-sense man-of-war thought-process

    cross-examine object-lesson title-page

    cross-reference page-proof wave-length

    cross-section pay-roll well-being

    death-rate poor-law well-nigh

    folk-song post-office will-power

    fountain-head

    These rules are the consensus of opinion of a considerable number of good authorities
    from DeVinne (1901) to Manly and Powell (1913)."

    The only change Dennis Beerpint makes is to add an exclamation mark after "fountain-head",
    presumably to remind himself to shout the word, triumphantly, at recitals.'
