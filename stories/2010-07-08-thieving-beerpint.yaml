  text: "It saddens me to report that weedy poet Dennis Beerpint has been caught red-handed\
    \ in an act of plagiarism. His verse \u201CThe Fountainhead\_: Homage \xE0 Ayn\
    \ Rand\u201D from his well-received recent collection A Series Of Homages To Female\
    \ Right-Wing Russo-American Postage Stamp Collectors was, it seems, lifted word\
    \ for word from this paragraph in Compound Words\_: A Study Of The Principles\
    \ Of Compounding, The Components Of Compounds, And The Use Of The Hyphen by Frederick\
    \ W. Hamilton, LL. D., published in 1918 by the Committee on Education of the\
    \ United Typothetae Of America:\n\u201C41. Following is a list of words of everyday\
    \ occurrence which should be hyphenated, and which do not fall under any of the\
    \ above classifications.\nafter-years food-stuff sea-level\nbas-relief guinea-pig\
    \ sense-perception\nbirth-rate horse-power son-in-law\nblood-relations loan-word\
    \ subject-matter\ncommon-sense man-of-war thought-process\ncross-examine object-lesson\
    \ title-page\ncross-reference page-proof wave-length\ncross-section pay-roll well-being\n\
    death-rate poor-law well-nigh\nfolk-song post-office will-power\nfountain-head\n\
    These rules are the consensus of opinion of a considerable number of good authorities\
    \ from DeVinne (1901) to Manly and Powell (1913).\u201D\nThe only change Dennis\
    \ Beerpint makes is to add an exclamation mark after \u201Cfountain-head\u201D\
    , presumably to remind himself to shout the word, triumphantly, at recitals."
