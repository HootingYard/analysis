  text: "\u201CIn the mediaeval imagination, this was a region of uttermost dread\u2026\
    \ where the heavens fling down liquid sheets of flame and the waters boil\u2026\
    \ where serpent rocks and ogre islands lie in wait for the mariner, where the\
    \ giant hand of Satan reaches up from the fathomless depths to seize him, where\
    \ he will turn black in face and body as a mark of God's vengeance for the insolence\
    \ of his prying into this forbidden mystery. And even if he should be able to\
    \ survive all these ghastly perils and sail on through, he would then arrive in\
    \ the Sea of Obscurity and be lost forever in the vapours and slime at the edge\
    \ of the world.\u201D\nPeter Forbath, The River Congo\_: The Discovery, Exploration\
    \ And Exploitation Of The World's Most Dramatic River (1977)"
