  text: 'It is quite some time since I have heard from Dr Ruth Pastry, but at last
    she has broken her silence. Here is her letter:

    Dear Mr Key : Last week I read your postage Poultry Yards Of The Grand Archdukes
    and, though I was not impressed, I could not help but be intrigued by your reference
    to a breakfast recipe which involves, and I quote, "more eggs than you can shake
    a stick at". How many eggs is that?, I wondered. The only indication you give,
    and I quote again, is "a goodly number of eggs". This is less than helpful. "A
    goodly number", in and of itself, is not a measurable quantity. A writer with
    more concern for his or her readers would be precise in these matters, and tell
    us plainly how many eggs we would have to assemble before we were no longer able
    to shake a stick at them.

    Because of your laxity, I was put in the position of having to find out for myself.
    I went for a walk in the woods and came back carrying a stout and sturdy stick.
    I think it was a branch from a hornbeam. It was a very shakeable stick, as I ascertained
    by shaking it experimentally a few times while still in the woods. Squirrels scattered
    as I shook it, and there was movement in shrubbery as if a small woodland creature
    had been startled. Had I had with me my net, I would have used it to entrap the
    creature, whatever it was, and then rained blows upon it with the stick until
    ''twere dead, and taken it home with me to boil for a snack, garnished perhaps
    with a tomato and some basil. As it was, I was netless, so I returned home with
    just the stick.

    I then set to preparing my test area. You know, I think, how thorough I am. I
    shoved the kitchen table back against the kitchen wall, thus creating sufficient
    space for me to be able to shake the stick without risking damage to my many and
    various kitchen appurtenances. Next, I opened my refrigerator, and removed from
    it every single egg currently in my possession, placing them, in their carton,
    on my countertop. I was somewhat dismayed to note that I had only five eggs, from
    the carton''s original complement of six. My instinctive thought was that five
    was unlikely to be the "goodly number of eggs" you prescribed. However, instinct
    is one thing, and empirical evidence is another thing entirely. It was clear to
    me that the absolute minimum possible indicated by "a goodly number of eggs" was
    a simple plurality, in other words, two eggs.

    Before continuing, I fetched from a cubby a fresh ledger, dozens of pages of creamy
    paper divided by faint blue lines into squares. In this, I would tabulate my results,
    using several different coloured pencils, which I duly sharpened with a pencil
    sharpener. I then removed two eggs from the carton and placed them on the table,
    taking care to position them in such a way that they would not roll off the tabletop
    and smash to squelchy ruin upon the floor linoleum. I had already made certain
    the tabletop was level, using a Van Der Hoddle Levelometer, a splendid device
    which I find far more effective than the common spirit level, and which uses no
    spirits whatsoever.

    With the two eggs in place upon the table, as they would be were I to be embarking
    upon my breakfast preparation, I shook the stick at them. I suffered no hindrance,
    and could have gone on shaking the stick for hours upon end, had I been so minded.
    But I shook the stick only for long enough to become convinced beyond any shade
    of doubt that two was not the "goodly number of eggs" defined as "more eggs than
    I could shake a stick at". I noted the results in the ledger, painstakingly, and
    then removed a third egg from the carton and placed it next to the original brace
    of eggs on the table, proceeding to shake the stick once again.

    You will, I suppose, have worked out that soon enough I tried four, then five,
    eggs, with identical outcomes. Pleased as I was with the severe beauty of the
    tabulation of results in my ledger, I had now exhausted my supply of eggs. For
    a madcap moment, I considered propping a mirror upon the kitchen table, thus doubling
    the visible number of eggs, thinking by doing so I could somehow "trick" the stick.
    Two immediate objections to such tomfoolery rapidly presented themselves. First,
    the positioning of the mirror would be enormously complicated if I were to be
    able to present the appearance of the intermediate egg numbers, from six through
    nine. Second, the stick was just a stick, from a hornbeam, probably, and did not
    in itself have sense perception, visual or otherwise. The impossibility of shaking
    a stick at "a goodly number of eggs", whatever that number might be, was, I felt
    sure, dependent not upon the stick itself, but on the quantity of eggs one was
    attempting to shake it at. And in turn, that surely meant they had to be real
    eggs, not mirror images nor any other eggs of illusion.

    Now, I was reluctant to march off to my nearest egg shop to buy the extra eggs
    I would need. For one thing, I had no idea how many eggs that might be. Also,
    what was I going to do with them all when my experiment was done? One can only
    eat so many eggs before becoming disgusted at the prospect of yet another egg-based
    meal, and it would be a terrible sin, and a waste of money, to let them rot uneaten.
    I thought it unlikely that the proprietor of the egg shop would be willing to
    allow me to return any bought but unused eggs, for he is not the most amiable
    of shopkeepers. Indeed, more than once I had had blazing arguments with him, and
    not always on the subject of eggs.

    Then I recalled that there had been recent tidings from the farmyard of Mad Old
    Farmer Frack. It was said that he was no longer devoting himself exclusively to
    his bellowing cows, but had installed a hen coop, with hens in it, on the farm.
    Where there''s hens there''s eggs, I said to myself, not wholly grammatically,
    but memorably. I wondered if it was an old country saying. I resolved to ask Old
    Farmer Frack if this were so, although the main business of the visit to him I
    now embarked upon, without delay, was to borrow from him as many eggs as possible.

    "Hail to thee, Old Farmer Frack," I cried, within the hour, leaning against his
    fence, "I was wondering if it would be possible for me to borrow from you as many
    eggs as possible? I will bring them back before nightfall."

    The mad old farmer was standing in the middle of one of his fields, looking mad
    and farmerly, doing something with a spade. When he heard me, he looked up, let
    fall the spade, and came bounding over to me at inhuman speed. His eyes were bloodshot
    and his hair was a tangle of filth.

    "My eggs are not for borrowing," he said, "Under any circumstances. But for an
    old friend like you, Dr Pastry, I might consider renting them out."

    And so we haggled. We had done so many times before, over the years. The thing
    is, I have advanced haggling skills, whereas Mad Old Farmer Frack is hopeless
    and inept in this area as in so many others. Within a few minutes, I had him agreeing
    to let me take away hundreds upon hundreds of eggs in return for a photocopy of
    my bus pass and a sprig o'' myrtle. Of course, I then had to scoot off to town
    to get the photocopy, and pop in to Myrtle Sprigs R Us(r) to get the sprig, but
    that was soon accomplished.

    When I returned to the farm, Mad Old Farmer Frack was nowhere to be seen. I thought
    he might be herding his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly, and went
    a-roaming to see if I could spot him, and them. I found the cows, all of them,
    without their farmer, standing around in a distant field beyond a drainage ditch,
    in the rain. I trudged back through muck and puddles to the hen coop, and poked
    my head in for a look-see. Lots and lots of hens, but no farmer, and, more to
    the point, no eggs. A couple of the more savage hens made moves to attack me,
    but I remonstrated with them in a sort of screechy hensprache I picked up from
    a hen person I met on my travels, long ago, and they were immediately pacified,
    and not just pacified but put into comas, from which they will only awake when
    next it is time for them to lay an egg.

    That done, I wandered aimlessly around the farm for a few hours before giving
    up and going home, cursing Mad Old Farmer Frack and throwing pebbles at crows
    in my annoyance. I unlatched the door of Pastry Cottage, and there, in my kitchen,
    was the mad old farmer himself, waving a stick at the kitchen table upon which
    teetered a gigantic pile of eggs. He looked around as I came in.

    "Ah, there you are, doctor," he said in his mad voice, "I was so interested in
    what you were telling me about your egg experiment during our haggling process,
    I thought I''d carry on where you left off while you were fetching the agreed
    rental. Speaking of which, do you have the photocopy of your bus pass and the
    sprig o'' myrtle?"

    Nonplussed, I handed over the items without a word.

    "So far I am up to a hundred and sixty-two eggs," said Old Farmer Frack, "And
    still nothing is impeding me from shaking the stick at them."

    "Have you been tabulating the results in the ledger?" I asked, not unreasonably.

    "Oh... I forgot to do that bit," he said. At least he had the grace to look shamefaced.

    "Then we must begin again, from six upwards," I said, "Otherwise the experiment
    will not have been conducted with sufficient rigour."

    "Yes, yes, of course," said the mad old farmer, and I was delighted to see that
    he immediately began to remove a hundred and fifty-six eggs from the table, one
    by one, with surprisingly dainty movements, placing them hither and thither about
    the kitchen wherever he was able to find space among the many and various kitchen
    appurtenances I mentioned earlier, only a few of which he had broken or dented
    when clumping about before suddenly remembering his daintiness upon my arrival
    home.

    I have to say that tackling this as a two-person job has been a marked improvement.
    I can concentrate on the majestic sweeping penmanship of my ledger entries, while
    Mad Old Farmer Frack shakes the stick. As a farmer, he is able to shake a stick
    with much more conviction than I can muster, for of course he shakes a stick at
    something most days, whereas I only rarely do so. We are taking it in turns to
    move the eggs from their temporary storage places, one at a time, to join the
    eggs accumulated upon the table.

    I am beginning to worry if the legs of my kitchen table will continue to support
    the ever-increasing weight of eggs, and, as I write, have sent Mad Old Farmer
    Frack off to fetch lengths of titanium cut to size, from Old Ma Purgative''s Cut
    To Size Titanium Reinforcement Rods Shoppe. I scribbled a note for him to take,
    explaining to Old Ma Purgative that the table is currently supporting six hundred
    and forty eggs, and asking that she supply titanium rods sturdy enough to support
    twice that number. I added, of course, the relevant measurements, of both my table
    legs and the approximate weight of eggs.

    Fairly soon, however, we are going to run out of eggs. Between us, I am sure we
    will work out how to get more, by hire or theft or, as a last resort, cash purchase.
    Meanwhile, I am beginning to wonder just how many eggs we will have piled on my
    reinforced table before I pause, coloured pencil held steady over my ledger, and
    the time comes when Mad Old Farmer Frack raises the hornbeam stick, to shake it
    yet again, and finds--oh! sweet mystery of life, or rather of egg-numbers--that
    he is completely unable to do so. When that time comes, Mr Key, I will write to
    you again, requesting further details of your eggy breakfast recipe, which I have
    no doubt is both succulent and toothsome.

    Yours waiting for Mad Old Farmer Frack to come crashing through the door,
