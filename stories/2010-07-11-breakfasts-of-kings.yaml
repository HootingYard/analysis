  text: 'This is the first in our important series "Breakfasts Of Kings" in which
    we cast a beady eye on the breakfast preferences of various monarchs throughout
    history.

    King Leopold II of Belgium ate six poached eggs, an enormous number of slices
    of toast, and an entire jar of marmalade for his breakfast each day.

    Leopold spoke French, rather than Flemish, so he did not refer to his breakfast
    as "het ontbijt", as Mr Key does, usually.

    ADDENDUM : It concerns not just breakfast but every daily meal, and it is not
    a king writing, but this quotation from the journals of Roger Casement is worth
    noting: "Chicken, chicken, custard, custard... every day... Goddam". Casement''s
    meals at the time (1903) were prepared by a cook known only as "Hairy Bill".'
