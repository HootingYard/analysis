  text: "This is the first in our important series \u201CBreakfasts Of Kings\u201D\
    \ in which we cast a beady eye on the breakfast preferences of various monarchs\
    \ throughout history.\nKing Leopold II of Belgium ate six poached eggs, an enormous\
    \ number of slices of toast, and an entire jar of marmalade for his breakfast\
    \ each day.\nLeopold spoke French, rather than Flemish, so he did not refer to\
    \ his breakfast as \u201Chet ontbijt\u201D, as Mr Key does, usually.\nADDENDUM\_\
    : It concerns not just breakfast but every daily meal, and it is not a king writing,\
    \ but this quotation from the journals of Roger Casement is worth noting: \u201C\
    Chicken, chicken, custard, custard\u2026 every day\u2026 Goddam\u201D. Casement's\
    \ meals at the time (1903) were prepared by a cook known only as \u201CHairy Bill\u201D\
