    Dramatis Personae

    SIGNOR PLOPPO, a man of parts

    AMBROSE, a bird

    AMBROSE : Bring me a jar of lemon curd!

    PLOPPO : (Aside) Can such things be? A talking bird? (To Ambrose) Whyfore dost
    thou want lemon curd?

    AMBROSE : Perchance this day my loins to gird.

    PLOPPO : I did not know that birds have loins. However, if you give me some coins,
    I will go and buy a jar. There is a curd shop not so far.

    AMBROSE : I beg thee, signor, use your own cash. (Aside) Should I praise his fine
    moustache? (To Ploppo) Your moustache is really great. Now hurry before it is
    too late!

    PLOPPO : Fear not, the curd shop never shuts. But -

    AMBROSE : But me no buts! Go and buy my lemon curd, or I shall be a distraught
    bird.

    PLOPPO : (Aside) I loathe the prospect of a bird distraught. It goes against everything
    I was taught. My parents put it very well--"Be good to birds, or you''ll go to
    hell."

    AMBROSE : (Aside) If I had hands, I''d clap with glee. This signor fears upsetting
    me. His childhood guilt, it haunts him yet. (To Ploppo) Make sure the lemon curd''s
    thick-set. I cannot bear it thin and runny.

    PLOPPO : Are you quite sure you have no money?

    AMBROSE : As sure as eggs is eggs, signor. Now do not tarry anymore. Go to the
    shop and buy me curd, or I shall be a loin-limp bird.

    PLOPPO : I will do as you ask and pay for your snack.

    Exit PLOPPO

    AMBROSE : The next scene is called "When Birds Attack!"'
