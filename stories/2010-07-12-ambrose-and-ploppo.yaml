  text: "Below is a scene from Dennis Beerpint's new \u201Cverse drama\u201D Signor\
    \ Ploppo In Conversation With A Bird, together with a short extract.\n\n(Snapshot\
    \ courtesy of unexpectedtales)\nDramatis Personae\nSIGNOR PLOPPO, a man of parts\n\
    AMBROSE, a bird\nAMBROSE\_: Bring me a jar of lemon curd!\nPLOPPO\_: (Aside) Can\
    \ such things be? A talking bird? (To Ambrose) Whyfore dost thou want lemon curd?\n\
    AMBROSE\_: Perchance this day my loins to gird.\nPLOPPO\_: I did not know that\
    \ birds have loins. However, if you give me some coins, I will go and buy a jar.\
    \ There is a curd shop not so far.\nAMBROSE\_: I beg thee, signor, use your own\
    \ cash. (Aside) Should I praise his fine moustache? (To Ploppo) Your moustache\
    \ is really great. Now hurry before it is too late!\nPLOPPO\_: Fear not, the curd\
    \ shop never shuts. But \u2013\nAMBROSE\_: But me no buts! Go and buy my lemon\
    \ curd, or I shall be a distraught bird.\nPLOPPO\_: (Aside) I loathe the prospect\
    \ of a bird distraught. It goes against everything I was taught. My parents put\
    \ it very well\u2014\u201CBe good to birds, or you'll go to hell.\u201D\nAMBROSE\_\
    : (Aside) If I had hands, I'd clap with glee. This signor fears upsetting me.\
    \ His childhood guilt, it haunts him yet. (To Ploppo) Make sure the lemon curd's\
    \ thick-set. I cannot bear it thin and runny.\nPLOPPO\_: Are you quite sure you\
    \ have no money?\nAMBROSE\_: As sure as eggs is eggs, signor. Now do not tarry\
    \ anymore. Go to the shop and buy me curd, or I shall be a loin-limp bird.\nPLOPPO\_\
    : I will do as you ask and pay for your snack.\nExit PLOPPO\nAMBROSE\_: The next\
    \ scene is called \u201CWhen Birds Attack!\u201D"
