  text: '"Nearly every Roman indeed had qualified himself before he was fifty to be
    a candidate for the Travellers'' Club; and sometimes the fine gentleman, who declined
    taking an active part in public affairs, found himself unexpectedly a thousand
    miles from home, with an imperial rescript in his portmanteau enjoining him not
    to return to Rome without special leave.

    "To such a compulsory journey was the poet Ovid condemned, apparently for his
    very particular attentions to the Princess Julia. His exile was a piece of ingenious
    cruelty. He was sent to Tomi, which was far beyond the range of all fashionable
    bathing-places. The climate was atrocious; the neighbourhood was worse; the wine
    was execrable and was often hard frozen, and eaten like a lozenge, and his only
    society was that of the barracks, or a few rich but unpolished corn-factors, who
    speculated in grain and deals on the shores of the Euxine. To write verses from
    morn to dewy eve was the unfortunate poet''s only solace; and he sent so many
    reams of elegies to Rome, that his friends came at last to vote him a bore, and
    he was reduced, for want of fitting audience, to learn the Getic language, and
    read his lacrymose couplets to circles of gaping barbarians."
