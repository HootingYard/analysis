  text: 'Regarding the Great Exhibition of 1851 :  "A specially strong opponent...
    was Colonel Sibthorp, M.P. for Lincoln, ''a man of limited intelligence and bigoted
    views''. He dubbed the scheme ''an exhibition of the trumpery and trash of foreigners
    who had no business to be here at all; and he offered a heartfelt prayer that
    Providence would think fit to destroy the impious project by a visitation of lightning''...
    ''He had,'' he solemnly declared, ''never set foot in this so-called Crystal Palace;
    and he considered it his duty to his fellow-creatures not to go into the place
    on any pretext. The very thought of it positively sickened him''."
