  text: "Regarding the Great Exhibition of 1851\_: \_\u201CA specially strong opponent\u2026\
    \ was Colonel Sibthorp, M.P. for Lincoln, \u2018a man of limited intelligence\
    \ and bigoted views\u2019. He dubbed the scheme \u2018an exhibition of the trumpery\
    \ and trash of foreigners who had no business to be here at all; and he offered\
    \ a heartfelt prayer that Providence would think fit to destroy the impious project\
    \ by a visitation of lightning\u2019\u2026 \u2018He had,\u2019 he solemnly declared,\
    \ \u2018never set foot in this so-called Crystal Palace; and he considered it\
    \ his duty to his fellow-creatures not to go into the place on any pretext. The\
    \ very thought of it positively sickened him\u2019.\u201D\nHorace Wyndham, This\
    \ Was The News\_: An Anthology Of Victorian Affairs (1948)"
