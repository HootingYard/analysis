  text: 'During the 1980s, my mother wrote a memoir of her teenage years in Belgium
    during World War Two. The first version was written in longhand, and then she
    bought a typewriter, typed it up, and made copies for her children. As far as
    I know, she never submitted it for publication. The other day, my brother had
    a bright idea. Why don''t we publish it on the internet?, he suggested. Although
    it is not written in diary format, I added my tuppenceworth to the effect that
    it would lend itself to appearing as a blog, so... voila!, here is Ghent In Wartime,
    a memoir in weekly instalments.

    I encourage you all to read it.
