  text: "Many a moon ago, back in February 2004, I provided a couple of examples of\
    \ the kind of invective to deploy when writing an unfavourable book review. The\
    \ book in question was Ulysses by James Joyce\u2014he invariably pronounced it\
    \ \u201COolissis\u201D, by the way\u2014and these were the passages I found so\
    \ diverting:\n\u201CAn immense mass of clotted nonsense\u201D\u2014Teachers\u2019\
    \ World\n\u201CThe maddest, muddiest, most loathsome book issued in our own or\
    \ any other time\u2026 inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty \u2026 a book\
    \ that one would have thought could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum.\u201D\
    \u2014The Sphere\nI can now recommend a couple more such tirades, though in this\
    \ case the book is less well-known. Adah Isaacs Menken (1835\u20131868) was an\
    \ actress, painter, poet, possible bigamist, and bareback circus equestrienne,\
    \ and in the last year of her life she published a volume of poetry entitled Infelicia.\
    \ In order to drum up sales, the rumour was spread, perhaps by Menken herself,\
    \ that some, or all, of the poems were in fact written by her pal Algernon Charles\
    \ Swinburne. However, all of them had previously appeared in various American\
    \ magazines before she even met Swinburne. Infelicia\u2018s lack of success may\
    \ have been due, at least partly, to reviews such as these:\n\u201CA wilderness\
    \ of rubbish and affected agonies of yearnings after the unspeakable, which achieve\
    \ the nonsensical.\u201D\u2014The Athenaeum\n\u201CA bleared panorama of deaths\
    \ and sighs and blood and tears and fire and general gloom and watery ghastliness.\u201D\
    \u2014The Saturday Review\n"
