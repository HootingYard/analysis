  text: "\u201CFollowing the approved practice, two large vases, containing \u2018\
    a representative sample of contemporary items\u2019, were deposited in the pedestal\
    \ [of Cleopatra's Needle, on Thames Embankment]. \u2018The mere list of these\
    \ objects,\u2019 declared the Saturday Review, \u2018must provoke a smile.\u2019\
    \ It was certainly well-calculated to have this effect, for, among them, were\
    \ a Bible, a translation of the hieroglyphics on the column, a portrait of the\
    \ Queen, a standard set of weights and measures, a Whitaker's Almanack, a Bradshaw's\
    \ railway-guide, a Post Office directory, a \u2018Mappin's shilling razor\u2019\
    , an \u2018Alexandra feeding-bottle, as used in the Royal nurseries\u2019, and\
    \ \u2018photographs of twelve pretty Englishwomen\u2019. Altogether, a mixed assortment.\u201D\
    \nHorace Wyndham, This Was The News\_: An Anthology Of Victorian Affairs (1948)\n\
    Is all that stuff still there, entombed in vases beneath the Needle?"
