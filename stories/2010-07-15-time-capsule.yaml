  text: '"Following the approved practice, two large vases, containing ''a representative
    sample of contemporary items'', were deposited in the pedestal [of Cleopatra''s
    Needle, on Thames Embankment]. ''The mere list of these objects,'' declared the
    Saturday Review, ''must provoke a smile.'' It was certainly well-calculated to
    have this effect, for, among them, were a Bible, a translation of the hieroglyphics
    on the column, a portrait of the Queen, a standard set of weights and measures,
    a Whitaker''s Almanack, a Bradshaw''s railway-guide, a Post Office directory,
    a ''Mappin''s shilling razor'', an ''Alexandra feeding-bottle, as used in the
    Royal nurseries'', and ''photographs of twelve pretty Englishwomen''. Altogether,
    a mixed assortment."

    Horace Wyndham, This Was The News : An Anthology Of Victorian Affairs (1948)

    Is all that stuff still there, entombed in vases beneath the Needle?'
