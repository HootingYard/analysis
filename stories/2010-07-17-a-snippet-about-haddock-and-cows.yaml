  text: '"The haddock... amongst marine animals, is supposed, throughout maritime
    Europe, to be a privileged fish : even in austere Scotland every child can point
    out the impression of St Peter''s thumb, by which, from age to age, it is distinguished
    from fishes having, otherwise, an external resemblance. All domesticated cattle,
    having the benefit of man''s guardianship and care, are believed, throughout England
    and Germany, to go down upon their knees at one particular moment on Christmas
    Eve, when the fields are covered in darkness, when no eye looks down but that
    of God, and when the exact anniversary hour revolves of the angelic song, once
    rolling over the fields and flocks of Palestine."
