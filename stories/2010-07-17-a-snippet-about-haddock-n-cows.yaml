  text: "\u201CThe haddock\u2026 amongst marine animals, is supposed, throughout maritime\
    \ Europe, to be a privileged fish\_: even in austere Scotland every child can\
    \ point out the impression of St Peter's thumb, by which, from age to age, it\
    \ is distinguished from fishes having, otherwise, an external resemblance. All\
    \ domesticated cattle, having the benefit of man's guardianship and care, are\
    \ believed, throughout England and Germany, to go down upon their knees at one\
    \ particular moment on Christmas Eve, when the fields are covered in darkness,\
    \ when no eye looks down but that of God, and when the exact anniversary hour\
    \ revolves of the angelic song, once rolling over the fields and flocks of Palestine.\u201D\
