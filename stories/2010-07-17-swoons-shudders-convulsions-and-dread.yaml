  text: 'Here is a further enlightening snippet from Hargrave Jennings'' Curious Things
    Of The Outside World, Last Fire (1861) :

    "Amatus Lusitanus relates the case of a monk who fainted when he beheld a rose,
    and never quitted his cell while that flower was blooming. Orfila (a less questionable
    authority) gives the account of the painter Vincent, who was seized with violent
    vertigo, and swooned, when there were roses in the room. Voltaire gives the history
    of an officer who was thrown into convulsions and lost his senses by having pinks
    in his chamber. Orfila also relates the instance of a lady, of forty-six years
    of age, of a hale constitution, who could never be present when a decoction of
    linseed was preparing, being troubled in the course of a few minutes with a general
    swelling of the face, followed by fainting and a loss of the intellectual faculties,
    which symptoms continued for four-and-twenty hours. Montaigne remarks on this
    subject, that there were men who dreaded an apple more than a cannon-ball. Zimmerman
    tells us of a lady who could not endure the feeling of silk and satin, and shuddered
    when she touched the velvety skin of a peach : other ladies cannot bear the feel
    of fur. Boyle records the case of a man who experienced a natural abhorrence of
    honey ; a young man invariably fainted when a servant swept his room. Hippocrates
    mentions one Nicanor, who swooned whenever he heard a flute ; and Shakespeare
    has alluded to the strange effect of the bagpipe. Boyle fell into a syncope when
    he heard the splashing of water ; Scaliger turned pale on the sight of water-cresses
    ; Erasmus experienced febrile symptoms when smelling fish ; the Duke d''Epernon
    swooned on beholding a leveret, although a hare did not produce the same effect
    ; Tycho Brahe fainted at the sight of a fox, Henry III of France at that of a
    cat, and Marshal D''Albret at a pig. The horror that whole families entertain
    of cheese is well known."'
