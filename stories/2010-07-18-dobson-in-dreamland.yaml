  text: 'According to Hargrave Jennings, in Curious Things Of The Outside World :
    Last Fire (1861), "There are moments in the history of the busiest man when his
    life seems a masquerade. There are periods in the story of the most engrossed
    and most worldly-minded man, when this strong fear will come, like a cloud, over
    him; when this conviction will start, athwart his horizon, like a flash from out
    a cloud. He will look up to the sunshine, some day, and in the midst of the business-clatter
    by which he may be surrounded, a man will, in a moment''s glance, seem to see
    the whole jostle of human interests and city bustle, or any stir, as so much empty
    show. Like the sick person, he will sometimes raise his head, and out of the midst
    of his distractions, and out of the grasp which that thing, ''business'', always
    has of him, he will ask himself the question, What does all this mean? Is the
    whole world awake, and am I asleep and dreaming a dream? Or is it that the whole
    world is the dream, and that I, in this single moment, have alone awakened?"

    That great twentieth-century pamphleteer, Dobson, woke up in this state of mind
    every single morning of his adult life. And that was not the end of his confusion,
    for Dobson was a great one for naps, he took a nap daily, very often more than
    one, plural naps, as it were, and each time he woke from his naps he likewise
    asked himself the questions posed by Hargrave Jennings, as he had already done
    on the morning of the day, when first he awoke.

    "Do you have the slightest idea," asked Marigold Chew, one blustery blizzardy
    Monday in the late 1950s, "How tiresome it is to have you lumbering about the
    place like a dippy person, asking the kinds of questions most sensible people
    stop posing when they outgrow their years of teendom?"

    Dobson''s reply to this perfectly reasonable query was most annoying.

    "Are you really speaking, Marigold, or am I just imagining this conversation within
    the wispy mysterious mists of mystery?"

    Marigold Chew was holding a handful of pebbles, and proceeded to throw one at
    the pamphleteer. No, that''s not right. Marigold Chew was holding a Pebblehead
    paperback, and it was this she threw across the room. The book was Pebblehead''s
    latest bestselling potboiler, The Interpretation Of Breams, a guide to foretelling
    the future using a combination of fish and recordings of lute music. Luckily,
    the book missed Dobson''s head by an inch.

    "I am going to go about my business in the real, palpable world, Dobson," announced
    Marigold Chew, "If you choose to waft about the place in a moonstruck daze, that
    is up to you. But it won''t get any pamphlets written!" and she swept out of the
    house into the blizzard, bent upon her real and palpable business, whatever it
    might have been that day.

    Dobson picked up the Pebblehead paperback from the floor and leafed through it,
    distractedly. He read a few lines here and there, and decided to go out to the
    fishmonger''s and the record shop. But he got no further than the chair on which
    he sat to don and to lace up his Canadian Snowplough Mechanic''s boots, for, yet
    enmired in his dreamy daze, he wondered if the chair, the laces, the boots were
    but figments. "Figments" made him think of figs, and then of Fig Newtons, a type
    of biscuit of which, at this period, he was inordinately fond, and, with his right
    foot encased in a boot the laces of which were not yet tied and his left foot
    merely ensocked, he rose from the chair and made for the cupboard wherein the
    biscuits, and similar snack items, were stored. When he stood, he was, in boot
    and sock, necessarily lopsided, and this being so, Dobson lost what balance he
    had, and toppled, bashing his bonce on the wainscot.

    He was unconscious for some minutes, during which time he really did dream, of
    the glove of Ib and of his weak Bomba, whatever that might mean.

    And of course, when he woke, sprawled on the floor, the pamphleteer''s swimming
    brain was yet again prompted to ask the Hargrave Jennings questions. Round and
    round we go, in an endless cycle, akin to the orbit of the planets around the
    sun.

    Marigold Chew was still out and about, so Dobson was alone in his daze. Now wide
    awake, but still unable to gain a foothold in the real, palpable world, he mooched
    about the house as a person might blunder about in a thick fog, what they used
    to call a "pea-souper" because of the supposed similarity of the cloudy density
    of the air to the consistency of soup made from peas, not to be confused with
    pease pudding, which is, as its name suggests, a pudding, not a soup. Dobson was
    thinking neither of soup, nor of the Fig Newtons, which he had utterly forgotten.
    He was doing things such as tapping the walls with his fingertips, peering carefully
    at curtains, opening and then closing doors, or in some cases leaving them ajar,
    as he tried to grasp what was real and what was not. Stumbling past an airing
    cupboard into the bathroom, he was astonished, in a bleary way, to come face to
    face with a monster of the deep, wallowing in the tub. It was bloated, lascivious,
    coarse, and repulsive, rather like Gertrude Atherton''s vision of Oscar Wilde,
    except that it had fins and hideous trailing tendrils, like those of a jellyfish.
    One such tendril now lashed out and struck Dobson across the face, leaving, not
    just a vivid crimson stripe, but droplets of an unbelievably aggressive toxin
    which seeped in seconds through his pores and began ravaging his innards. The
    pamphleteer toppled once again to the floor, this time of his bathroom rather
    than of his kitchen, still wearing one boot, but now he was convulsed by fits,
    as if he were Voltaire''s officer with pinks in his chamber alluded to in another
    passage from Hargrave Jennings'' very sensible book, and, like the officer, Dobson
    lost his senses.

    In the tub, the sea monster now began to gurgle, and to splash about. Suddenly,
    through the bathroom window crashed Father Ninian Tonguelash, the Jesuit priest
    and self-styled "Soutane-Attired Nemesis Of Sea Monsters", clutching in one gloved
    hand a harpoon and in the other a crucifix. Then...

    Then...

    Then... I awoke, and I realised that all I have just written was a dream. Of course
    it was! Dobson did not become the titanic pamphleteer he was by faffing about
    the place all muddleheaded. When he woke up, every day of his adult life, he knew
    exactly where he was, and if perchance there was a smidgen of doubt in the matter,
    he would in any case plunge his head into a bucket of icy water, just to be on
    the safe side. How foolish of me to confuse the hallucinations of my sleeping,
    pea-sized brain with the iron truth!'
