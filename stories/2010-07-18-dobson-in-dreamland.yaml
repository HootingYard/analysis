  text: "According to Hargrave Jennings, in Curious Things Of The Outside World\_\
    : Last Fire (1861), \u201CThere are moments in the history of the busiest man\
    \ when his life seems a masquerade. There are periods in the story of the most\
    \ engrossed and most worldly-minded man, when this strong fear will come, like\
    \ a cloud, over him; when this conviction will start, athwart his horizon, like\
    \ a flash from out a cloud. He will look up to the sunshine, some day, and in\
    \ the midst of the business-clatter by which he may be surrounded, a man will,\
    \ in a moment's glance, seem to see the whole jostle of human interests and city\
    \ bustle, or any stir, as so much empty show. Like the sick person, he will sometimes\
    \ raise his head, and out of the midst of his distractions, and out of the grasp\
    \ which that thing, \u2018business\u2019, always has of him, he will ask himself\
    \ the question, What does all this mean? Is the whole world awake, and am I asleep\
    \ and dreaming a dream? Or is it that the whole world is the dream, and that I,\
    \ in this single moment, have alone awakened?\u201D\nThat great twentieth-century\
    \ pamphleteer, Dobson, woke up in this state of mind every single morning of his\
    \ adult life. And that was not the end of his confusion, for Dobson was a great\
    \ one for naps, he took a nap daily, very often more than one, plural naps, as\
    \ it were, and each time he woke from his naps he likewise asked himself the questions\
    \ posed by Hargrave Jennings, as he had already done on the morning of the day,\
    \ when first he awoke.\n\u201CDo you have the slightest idea,\u201D asked Marigold\
    \ Chew, one blustery blizzardy Monday in the late 1950s, \u201CHow tiresome it\
    \ is to have you lumbering about the place like a dippy person, asking the kinds\
    \ of questions most sensible people stop posing when they outgrow their years\
    \ of teendom?\u201D\nDobson's reply to this perfectly reasonable query was most\
    \ annoying.\n\u201CAre you really speaking, Marigold, or am I just imagining this\
    \ conversation within the wispy mysterious mists of mystery?\u201D\nMarigold Chew\
    \ was holding a handful of pebbles, and proceeded to throw one at the pamphleteer.\
    \ No, that's not right. Marigold Chew was holding a Pebblehead paperback, and\
    \ it was this she threw across the room. The book was Pebblehead's latest bestselling\
    \ potboiler, The Interpretation Of Breams, a guide to foretelling the future using\
    \ a combination of fish and recordings of lute music. Luckily, the book missed\
    \ Dobson's head by an inch.\n\u201CI am going to go about my business in the real,\
    \ palpable world, Dobson,\u201D announced Marigold Chew, \u201CIf you choose to\
    \ waft about the place in a moonstruck daze, that is up to you. But it won't get\
    \ any pamphlets written!\u201D and she swept out of the house into the blizzard,\
    \ bent upon her real and palpable business, whatever it might have been that day.\n\
    Dobson picked up the Pebblehead paperback from the floor and leafed through it,\
    \ distractedly. He read a few lines here and there, and decided to go out to the\
    \ fishmonger's and the record shop. But he got no further than the chair on which\
    \ he sat to don and to lace up his Canadian Snowplough Mechanic's boots, for,\
    \ yet enmired in his dreamy daze, he wondered if the chair, the laces, the boots\
    \ were but figments. \u201CFigments\u201D made him think of figs, and then of\
    \ Fig Newtons, a type of biscuit of which, at this period, he was inordinately\
    \ fond, and, with his right foot encased in a boot the laces of which were not\
    \ yet tied and his left foot merely ensocked, he rose from the chair and made\
    \ for the cupboard wherein the biscuits, and similar snack items, were stored.\
    \ When he stood, he was, in boot and sock, necessarily lopsided, and this being\
    \ so, Dobson lost what balance he had, and toppled, bashing his bonce on the wainscot.\n\
    He was unconscious for some minutes, during which time he really did dream, of\
    \ the glove of Ib and of his weak Bomba, whatever that might mean.\nAnd of course,\
    \ when he woke, sprawled on the floor, the pamphleteer's swimming brain was yet\
    \ again prompted to ask the Hargrave Jennings questions. Round and round we go,\
    \ in an endless cycle, akin to the orbit of the planets around the sun.\nMarigold\
    \ Chew was still out and about, so Dobson was alone in his daze. Now wide awake,\
    \ but still unable to gain a foothold in the real, palpable world, he mooched\
    \ about the house as a person might blunder about in a thick fog, what they used\
    \ to call a \u201Cpea-souper\u201D because of the supposed similarity of the cloudy\
    \ density of the air to the consistency of soup made from peas, not to be confused\
    \ with pease pudding, which is, as its name suggests, a pudding, not a soup. Dobson\
    \ was thinking neither of soup, nor of the Fig Newtons, which he had utterly forgotten.\
    \ He was doing things such as tapping the walls with his fingertips, peering carefully\
    \ at curtains, opening and then closing doors, or in some cases leaving them ajar,\
    \ as he tried to grasp what was real and what was not. Stumbling past an airing\
    \ cupboard into the bathroom, he was astonished, in a bleary way, to come face\
    \ to face with a monster of the deep, wallowing in the tub. It was bloated, lascivious,\
    \ coarse, and repulsive, rather like Gertrude Atherton's vision of Oscar Wilde,\
    \ except that it had fins and hideous trailing tendrils, like those of a jellyfish.\
    \ One such tendril now lashed out and struck Dobson across the face, leaving,\
    \ not just a vivid crimson stripe, but droplets of an unbelievably aggressive\
    \ toxin which seeped in seconds through his pores and began ravaging his innards.\
    \ The pamphleteer toppled once again to the floor, this time of his bathroom rather\
    \ than of his kitchen, still wearing one boot, but now he was convulsed by fits,\
    \ as if he were Voltaire's officer with pinks in his chamber alluded to in another\
    \ passage from Hargrave Jennings\u2019 very sensible book, and, like the officer,\
    \ Dobson lost his senses.\nIn the tub, the sea monster now began to gurgle, and\
    \ to splash about. Suddenly, through the bathroom window crashed Father Ninian\
    \ Tonguelash, the Jesuit priest and self-styled \u201CSoutane-Attired Nemesis\
    \ Of Sea Monsters\u201D, clutching in one gloved hand a harpoon and in the other\
    \ a crucifix. Then\u2026\nThen\u2026\nThen\u2026 I awoke, and I realised that\
    \ all I have just written was a dream. Of course it was! Dobson did not become\
    \ the titanic pamphleteer he was by faffing about the place all muddleheaded.\
    \ When he woke up, every day of his adult life, he knew exactly where he was,\
    \ and if perchance there was a smidgen of doubt in the matter, he would in any\
    \ case plunge his head into a bucket of icy water, just to be on the safe side.\
    \ How foolish of me to confuse the hallucinations of my sleeping, pea-sized brain\
    \ with the iron truth!"
