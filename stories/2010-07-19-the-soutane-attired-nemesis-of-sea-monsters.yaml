  text: 'Father Ninian Tonguelash, the Jesuit priest and self-styled "Soutane-Attired
    Nemesis of Sea Monsters" who appeared in my dream yesterday, was, I would have
    you know, a real historical figure. He is often thought to be fictional, probably
    because the only reliable biography we have of him, by Pebblehead pere, was published
    in the form of a series of short episodes between the covers of pulp magazines
    such as Mildly Alarming Stories!, Yarns That Might Raise Your Blood Pressure Just
    A Tad, and Vaguely Disquieting Tales. That the various scattered pieces were never
    brought together as a proper book is one of literature''s, indeed life''s, great
    tragedies, and the blame must lie squarely with Pebblehead pere himself. For all
    his learning and wisdom and panache as a biographer, he was a very bewildering
    person. Even just walking down the street, he left a swathe of boggle-eyed bewilderment
    in his wake, and the captains of ships were ever reluctant to have him aboard
    their pleasure steamers.

    Bewildering, too, is his treatment of the life of Father Tonguelash, quite apart
    from its being broken up into bits and published in magazines designed for a readership
    of the semi-literate and the timid and the nerve-bejangled. Although what research
    has been done seems to confirm that Pebblehead pere''s accounts are historically
    accurate, indeed devastatingly so, each episode as written is almost identical.
    The general schema is as follows:

    1. Father Ninian Tonguelash has just finished saying Mass when an urchin sprints
    panting into the vestry to announce that a sea monster has been sighted. Either
    a ship or a boat or a coastal hamlet is imperilled.

    2. Without stopping to ask any questions--even something as basic as in which
    direction he should speed--Father Tonguelash grabs a harpoon and a crucifix and
    charges out into the wild and windy shoreland. It is invariably wild and windy.

    3. After a little while of harum scarum scampering, the priest stops, as Christ
    stopped at Eboli, and, all windswept and resolute, takes from his pocket a volume
    of poems by his friend and colleague Father Gerard Manley Hopkins. He opens the
    book at random and declaims a poem, shouting into the wind. Declaiming done, he
    returns the book to his pocket, makes the sign of the cross, and scampers onward.
    The panting urchin who brought the message of sea monster peril has now had time
    to catch up with the priest, and sticks close to his heels.

    4. Father Ninian arrives at the scene of imperilment and confronts the sea monster.
    He is absolutely fearless. "I am attired in the soutane of a Jesuit, and I am
    your Nemesis!" he cries. At this point the sea monster usually makes a gurgling
    sound we are led to interpret as a plea for God''s ineffable mercy. But Father
    Ninian shows none. He hands the crucifix to the panting urchin, telling the lad
    to brandish it at the sea monster. Then he launches the harpoon, with unerring
    accuracy, felling the sea monster instantly.

    5. It is an interesting point that all of the sea monsters harpooned by the Jesuit
    were of the kind that, when struck, shrivel up and vanish in a puff of cloudy
    gaseous green vapour.

    6. Father Tonguelash reels in his harpoon, pats the panting urchin on the head,
    retrieves his crucifix, and acknowledges the grovelling gratitude of those whose
    imperilment he has quashed, be they the crew of a ship or a boat or the peasant
    inhabitants of a coastal hamlet.

    7. As the priest wends his way back to his vestry, Pebblehead pere does three
    things. He makes note, based upon what sources he never reveals, of all the types
    of birds in the sky and perched upon branches which the Jesuit, were he looking,
    would see upon his journey. He makes some attempt, not always successfully, to
    elucidate various sea monster references hidden in the text of the Gerard Manley
    Hopkins poem declaimed by Father Tonguelash earlier in the episode. Lastly, and
    characteristically, he ends each piece with a flourish of distinctively bewildering
    prose.

    As a tot, Pebblehead fils, the bestselling paperbackist, was taught this "seven-point
    plan of literary composition", as his pere dubbed it. Careful readers will still
    find traces of the technique in some of the potboilers that pour out of the "chalet
    o'' prose" day after day. Consider, for example, even so recent a blockbuster
    as The Jesuit And The Sea Serpent which follows the pattern almost exactly, despite
    being over a thousand pages fat, with a gold-embossed cover making it suitable
    for airport book kiosks.'
