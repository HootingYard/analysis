    Now, imagine the scene. It was shortly after breakfast time on a cold and storm-tossed
    morning in the 1950s at the home of the twentieth century''s most magnificent
    pamphleteer. Dobson had eaten his bloaters. Marigold Chew had something eggy.
    They were still sitting at their breakfast table. Outside, hailstones were pinging.

    "Marigold, o my darling dear," boomed Dobson, "I have devised a marvellous plan!
    Listen carefully. You often comment upon what you consider to be my breathtaking
    ignorance of the natural world. And though I usually swat away your charges, as
    a giant may swat away a dwarf, I have, this day, found within myself a reservoir
    of humility, and I must admit there is a certain truth in what you say."

    Marigold Chew interrupted here, to suggest she capture Dobson''s words upon a
    tape recorder for the settling of any future contretemps, but the pamphleteer
    pressed on.

    "That being so," he said, "My plan is to increase my knowledge in the best way
    possible, and what method could be more efficacious than to write a book about
    what I do not know? And not just any book. I shall take as my guide that great
    ancient encyclopaedia by Pliny The Elder, the Natural History, and rewrite it
    in its entirety! To ensure I cover the sweeping width and breadth of all natural
    phenomena, I  shall follow slavishly the chapter and section headings of the great
    work, but, subjoined to them, the texts shall be my own! Is that not a fantastic
    plan and a superb way to extend my knowledge of that which you claim me to be
    ignorant.. of, again, I think, if I am to be grammatically sound?"

    "Are you sure you mean ''subjoined'', Dobson?" asked Marigold Chew, who was in
    chucklesome mood.

    "I am not one hundred percent certain, no, but let that pass, o my inamorata.
    The thing is, I have decided to begin the project this very day, not at the beginning,
    but plunging straight in to the tenth book of Pliny, which you will recall is
    the one in which he addresses matters ornithological. That is an area in which
    you suggest my ignorance is boundless and unfathomable, so it will be the perfect
    test bed. And no, I am not sure I mean ''test bed'', but let that pass too, for
    the time being."

    "I am quite happy to do so," said Marigold Chew, "For now my eggy breakfast is
    digested, I am going off and out to a beekeeping bonanza jamboree. Get thee to
    thy escritoire, and when I return I shall be happy to have you read to me the
    initial scribblings of your Natural History, a book I am sure will knock Pliny
    from his plinth."

    Dobson took this repartee in good part, scurried to his escritoire, sharpened
    a pencil, and flung open his dusty copy of Pliny at the tenth book. The nature
    of birds. (i-ii) The ostrich, the phoenix, he read. He closed his eyes and tried
    to summon a vision of an ostrich and a phoenix, first separately, then together.
    He was determined not to cheat by reading what Pliny The Elder had had to say
    on the subject nearly two thousand years ago. Then the pamphleteer shook his head,
    like a man waking from a jarring dream, opened his eyes, and began to scribble
    with his sharpened pencil on the first page of a brand new notepad.

    Both the ostrich and the phoenix, he wrote, are birds, the one real, the other
    mythical. On the front of the head of the real bird, there is a beak. And, lo!,
    what do we find on the front of the head of the bird of myth? It too has a beak!
    And this is not the only feature they have in common, for the bodies of both birds
    bear plumage in the form of feathers.

    Dobson looked upon what he had done, and saw that it was good. No doubt there
    would be more to say about both the ostrich and the phoenix, but he felt he had,
    at the very least, cracked the method he planned to employ. Pliny would be his
    guide, but only his guide. The grand sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose would
    be Dobson''s alone. He went to take a post-breakfast nap.

    When he awoke, the pamphleteer''s brain was befuddled after a series of dreams,
    the details of which, so vivid in sleep, vanished pfft! the instant his head rose
    from the pillow. He opened a can of revivifying Squelcho! and poured it into a
    tumbler, then sat again at his escritoire to consult his Pliny. Eagles... vultures...
    hawks... owls... woodpeckers... it was a long, long list of things with beaks
    and feathers! Dobson threw his pencil across the room, donned his greatcoat and
    his Belgian Post Office Inspector''s boots, and went out in the teeth of the hailstorm
    to trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal to clear his head. He saw
    a number of birds while on his trudge, not one of which was either an ostrich
    or a phoenix. He threw a pebble at a swan. He stopped in at Old Ma Purgative''s
    Canalside Lobster Hatchery ''n'' Winter Sports Togs Bazaar, and browsed among
    the lobsters and the winter sports togs, but in spite of the Old Ma offering bargains
    galore in a special ''hailstorm sale'', Dobson, enmired in penury as ever, bought
    nothing. Eventually he trudged back home, passing the puddle in which the pebble
    he had thrown at the swan had somehow fetched up, as pebbles do. And as pamphleteers
    do, he returned to his escritoire, sharpened another pencil, and, jaw set in determination,
    cast his eye over the Pliny. Peacocks... bustards... swans... hoopoes... partridges...
    goat-suckers... this last reminded Dobson that he had a goat-milk popsicle in
    the refrigerator, and he was about to go and fetch it, for a midmorning snack,
    when, towards the end of the contents of Pliny''s tenth book, he read instances
    of affection between snakes and a bomb exploded inside his brain.

    Suddenly Dobson recalled the dream from which he had awoken befuddled after his
    nap. He remembered it in every last detail, for it was his recurring dream, the
    one that flickered in his sleeping cranium on so many, many nights, and in so
    many, many daytime naps, and had done since infancy. He turned to a fresh page
    of his notepad, and began scribbling.

    When I was a tot, he wrote, I had a favourite bedtime story which I implored my
    ma or pa to read to me before I fell asleep. I drank my bedtime beaker of milk
    of magnesia and settled my little head on my little pillow, and listened, night
    after night, to the tale which, ever since, has haunted my dreams, and about which
    it is incomprehensible that I have not written a pamphlet until today. Well, thanks
    to Pliny The Elder, now I can address that omission. The story began as follows:

    Once upon a time there was a boa constrictor named Dagobert. He was loitering
    on a verdant slope when he happened to spot a passing vole. Dagobert uncoiled
    himself, pounced, sank his fangs into the tiny vole, and gulped it down in one
    fangsome mouthful. But before his digestive juices could begin to reduce the paralysed
    but yet living vole into nourishing pulp, along came a viper named Clothgard.

    "My oh my!" thought Dagobert, "What a lovely viper she is. I feel a great pang
    of affection for her."

    Clothgard herself was a sore vexed viper, for she had not eaten for many days.

    "O boa constrictor loitering on the verdant slope, canst thee help a sore vexed
    viper who has not eaten for many days? My name is Clothgard," hissed Clothgard.

    So mighty were the pangs of affection felt by Dagobert that he immediately regurgitated
    the vole and offered it to the famished viper.

    "Why thank you," she hissed, "You are quite the most charming boa constrictor
    it has ever been my pleasure to meet."

    There was more to the story, much more, but it was always around this point that,
    as a tot, I fell into my golden slumbers, and ma or pa placed the storybook gently
    by my pillow and tiptoed away.

    This you will recognise, I expect, as the opening of Dobson''s important pamphlet
    The Significance, In My Long-Ago Infancy, Of An Undigested Vole (out of print).
    He was still scribbling away furiously, possessed by a pamphleteer''s demons,
    when Marigold Chew arrived home. Thinking he was at work on his revision of Pliny,
    she did not interrupt him, but went straight into the back garden with the new
    bees she had brought back from the bonanza jamboree. Not until a few days later,
    when she asked Dobson if he had yet written his chapter on the nature of puff-eggs,
    addled eggs, and wind-eggs, did she learn that the pamphleteer had abandoned his
    Pliny.

    "Oh that," he said, over breakfast, "It''s just one bird after another. I can''t
    be doing with it."'
