  text: 'From Harper''s New Monthly Magazine, Volume 2, Number 12, May 1851

    "Physico-Physiological Researches on the Dynamics of Magnetism, &c., by Baron
    CHARLES VON REICHENBACH, translated from the German, by JOHN ASHBURNER, M.D.,
    is a scientific treatise, showing the relations of magnetism, electricity, heat,
    light, crystallization, and chemism to the vital forces of the human body. It
    is founded on an extensive series of experiments, which tend to bring the mysterious
    phenomena of Mesmerism within the domain of physics, and in fact to reduce the
    whole subject of physiology to a department of chemical science... The investigations,
    of which the results are here described, are of a singularly curious character,
    exhibiting the most astonishing developments, with a philosophical calmness that
    is rare even among German savants."

    "In the album presented to the King of Bavaria by the artists of Munich, is an
    admirable composition by Hubner. It is an expression of the feelings of a large
    portion of Upper Germany. It represents a female prostrate upon the ground, with
    the arms crossed, the face entirely hidden, in an attitude of the deepest despair.
    The long hair floats over the arms, and trails along the ground. The whole figure
    is a mixture of majesty and utter abandonment. The simple title of the piece is--Germania,
    1850."'
