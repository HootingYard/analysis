  text: 'The rebranding exercise applied to the seven dwarves, of Snow White''s acquaintance,
    has by any measure been a PR triumph. Everyone is familiar with their names. Would
    that were so with Hamstrung, Pointy and Downcast, a trio now largely forgotten,
    so much so that even the cleverest brainboxes would be hard pressed to say whether
    they were a music hall act, a set of cartoon strip characters, or if they occupied
    some other corner of popular culture. There is uncertainty, too, regarding the
    identity of the third member, who is sometimes referred to as Downcast and at
    other times as Mordant.

    References to them are scattered here and there in the records of the past, in
    biographies and memoirs, old newspaper clippings, scrapbooks, letters, official
    and unofficial reports, and salvaged ephemeral bittybobs. Yet Hamstrung, Pointy
    and Downcast somehow refuse to swim into focus. They remain impossible to pin
    down, each seeming "fact" contradicted, or even erased, by the next.

    Consider, as one example, the nature of their living quarters. Based on a glancing
    and none too clear bit of footnotery in a photocopy of a manuscript by Pabstow,
    many people are of the view that Hamstrung, Pointy and Downcast inhabited a sweatlodge.
    At least, Pointy is said to have used the word "lodge" when filling in forms,
    and the three of them emitted copious amounts of sweat, to the extent that they
    collected it in sealed jars which they then tried to market as some sort of medicinal
    potion, though the details of that little enterprise are so disgusting that we
    would best not dwell upon them. Yet elsewhere (Gobbing, The Vileness Of Seaside
    Resorts) it is suggested that Hamstrung and Pointy, if not Downcast--whose name
    is given here as Mordant--lived permanently in the sand and silt and bilge beneath
    a jetty, and were semi-amphibious to boot. The evidence for this appears to be
    a scribble in the margin of a police report prepared by legendary copper Detective
    Captain Cargpan, but whether the scribble is in his hand or that of one of his
    brutish subordinates is not made clear. Like so much else in the matter of Hamstrung,
    Pointy and Downcast, we are left clutching haplessly at straws, straws that snap
    or are borne away on a gust of fierce and sudden wind.

    Of necessity, we have to read between the lines, and sometimes not just between
    them but behind them, or at an angle to them H P Lovecraft might have described
    as belonging to an abnormal geometry loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions
    apart from ours. When we do that, we may come no closer to gaining a proper conceptual
    grasp of the trio, but we can appreciate, I think, that there was a time when
    Hamstrung, Pointy and Downcast were as famous as Josef Stalin or Martin Tupper
    or Xavier Cugat, and as culturally significant.

    Perhaps we ought to recall that passage in the Memoirs of Old Halob, the coach
    and mentor of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, where he writes I went out to the
    kiosk to buy a carton of high tar cigarettes, and as I clattered along the street
    it seemed to me the ground, the sky, the air, by Christ every atom in Creation,
    was somehow shouting out the names of that illustrious threesome, safe and snug
    in their sweatlodge or under the jetty, in sand and silt and bilge. It is telling
    that this sentence was expunged from the published version of the Memoirs for
    reasons never divulged to the hoi polloi.'
