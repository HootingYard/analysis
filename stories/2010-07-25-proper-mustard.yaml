  text: 'A Very British Dude * explains proper mustard:

    "Listless and radioactive yellow, [American mustard] does not add to the celebration
    of all that is good and holy in your mouth. The "Actions on" ingesting Proper
    Mustard are as follows. Your sinuses should clear instantly; your brain should
    be invigorated and you should develop a nose bleed. English Mustard delivers and
    it is thus the correct Mustard."

    * I am charitably assuming this is a deliberate oxymoron. The alternative is too
    horrifying to contemplate.'
