  text: "A Very British Dude * explains proper mustard:\n\u201CListless and radioactive\
    \ yellow, [American mustard] does not add to the celebration of all that is good\
    \ and holy in your mouth. The \u201CActions on\u201D ingesting Proper Mustard\
    \ are as follows. Your sinuses should clear instantly; your brain should be invigorated\
    \ and you should develop a nose bleed. English Mustard delivers and it is thus\
    \ the correct Mustard.\u201D\n* I am charitably assuming this is a deliberate\
    \ oxymoron. The alternative is too horrifying to contemplate."
