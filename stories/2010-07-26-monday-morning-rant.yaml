  text: 'Monday morning, time for a rant. Given that I persist in taking the Grauniad,
    I suppose I have only myself to blame that while the day is yet young I was minded
    to fling the paper across the room and utter execrations. What bothers me is that
    their highly-paid columnists--at least, paid a fat lot more than I am, i.e. nothing--betray
    such ignorance. It is the little details that vex me... those admittedly minor
    errors which, I sense, one only makes if lacking the broad sweep of what used
    to be called "general knowledge".

    Today''s case in point comes from fatuous television reviewer Sam Wollaston. Reviewing
    last night''s new Sherlock on the BBC, he notes that the modern-day setting of
    the series means the characters get around by black cab rather than by "the handsome
    carriage". The what? He means the Hansom cab, of course. Anyone who knows that
    would not mistype it as "handsome". The heavens will not fall in, the planets
    will continue to spin, but yet this slapdashery pains me.

    A while ago, another Grauniad television reviewer, addressing himself to a new
    adaptation of The Turn Of The Screw, repeatedly referred to the story''s presiding
    evil spirit as "Peter Clint", rather than "Quint"--this in spite of the name being
    clearly visible, at one point, upon a tombstone. Again, we are dealing here with
    what I would consider general knowledge. Henry James'' ghost story is a classic,
    certainly a piece with which I would have thought anybody employed in "cultural"
    journalism would be familiar.

    Taking the cake, though, is Grauniad America editor Michael Tomasky, who sets
    us a history quiz. The first question is:

    1. Arguably the first great work of history in the Enlightenment era was by Edward
    Gibbon and in six volumes described:

    a. The Greco-Roman wars

    b. The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire

    c. The "Mohametan" conquest of Iberia

    In the notes at the end of the quiz, he announces smugly "If you didn''t get this
    one, you should have stopped right then and there." It is difficult to "get" one
    where none of the three alternatives is correct. Gibbon''s great work was, of
    course, The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire. No doubt I will
    be accused of nit-picking, but it seems to me this is yet another example of blithe
    lack of attention to detail. And a narrative of rise and fall would be a very
    different book to one limited to decline and fall--the phrase, itself, one which
    the literate instantly recognise.

    Incidentally, if the Grauniad and the rest of the papers still employed a sufficient
    number of subeditors, these embarrassments would be much less likely to occur.
    Bruce Willis is a man who is rarely right about anything, and he was never more
    wrong than when he wrote the immortal words "Proofreading is for pussies".'
