  text: '"He was an expert in many subjects and intervened widely in others. Among
    his contributions to learned journals were papers on meteorology, navigation,
    surveying, anthropology, archaeology, painting, photography, the use of spectacles
    by divers, ultrasonic whistles, diet fads, currency reform, visions, corporal
    punishment, the ideal length of rope for hanging people, the flashing of signals
    to Mars, and dozens of other topics. Almost as numerous were his inventions, ranging
    from advanced scientific instruments to gadgets for personal convenience. At the
    age of thirteen he designed a steam flying machine, followed by an hour-glass
    speedometer for bicycles, and, in later life, a periscope for seeing over the
    heads of crowds. It was used for viewing processions, of which he was particularly
    fond, in conjunction with a wooden brick, wrapped in cloth and tied to a string
    so that it could be lowered to the ground for standing on."

    I know what you''re thinking. Did Dobson and Blotzmann spawn some kind of love-child
    (perhaps using a technique concocted by the latter)? But no. Apart from anything
    else, that would be chronologically incoherent, like a leech doctor with a brain
    scanner. It is in fact Francis Galton, as described in Eccentric Lives And Peculiar
    Notions by John Michell (1984). There is a touch, too, of Joost Van Dongelbraacke,
    the suburban shaman. Michell notes that Galton

    "was strongly religious, but the only type of worship that appealed to him was
    the spontaneous variety he had seen among the Africans. He considered that their
    chants, dances and fetish worship expressed the genuine religious spirit of the
    natural man. As usual, he put that belief to practical test. Looking round for
    the least worshipful object he could find, he hit upon the comic figure of Mr
    Punch, and forced his mind into believing that it possessed divine powers. The
    experiment succeeded. He came to experience ''a large share of the feelings a
    barbarian entertains towards his idol'', and for a long time he was unable to
    look at Mr Punch''s grotesque features without a feeling of reverence."
