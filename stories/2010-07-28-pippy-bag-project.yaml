  text: "Here is another project to keep the tinies occupied during the summer holidays.\n\
    Get your pippy bag, and cram it full of kapok. Using a length of butcher's string,\
    \ or an old bootlace, tie the pippy bag tightly closed so that none of the kapok\
    \ will fall out. Now stick innumerable pins into it, and voila! you have a splendid\
    \ homemade pin cushion.\nIt may be that your interests do not run to needlework\
    \ or embroidery, in which case you will not find much use for a pin cushion. So\
    \ let me show you how easy it is to turn it into something far more exciting!\n\
    Fashion a few pipe cleaners into the basic shape of a human body\u2014arms and\
    \ legs and torso. Then poke this into your pin cushion, which serves as the head.\
    \ Depending on the size of your pippy bag, the proportions will be all wrong,\
    \ and it will look a bit like a three-dimensional stick person with a huge bloated\
    \ hydrocephalic head, but don't worry about that. Think of it as a voodoo dolly.\n\
    The next thing you need to do is to force your mind into believing that the dolly\
    \ is genuinely imbued with the spirit of a real person, just as Francis Galton\
    \ convinced himself that Mr Punch was a god. Bear in mind that the dolly has innumerable\
    \ pins stuck in its head, which almost guarantees that the person you choose,\
    \ whether it is David Blunkett, for example, or Gore Vidal, will shortly afterwards\
    \ have their actual head attacked by a swarm of bees."
