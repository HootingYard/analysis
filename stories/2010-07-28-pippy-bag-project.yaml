  text: 'Here is another project to keep the tinies occupied during the summer holidays.

    Get your pippy bag, and cram it full of kapok. Using a length of butcher''s string,
    or an old bootlace, tie the pippy bag tightly closed so that none of the kapok
    will fall out. Now stick innumerable pins into it, and voila! you have a splendid
    homemade pin cushion.

    It may be that your interests do not run to needlework or embroidery, in which
    case you will not find much use for a pin cushion. So let me show you how easy
    it is to turn it into something far more exciting!

    Fashion a few pipe cleaners into the basic shape of a human body--arms and legs
    and torso. Then poke this into your pin cushion, which serves as the head. Depending
    on the size of your pippy bag, the proportions will be all wrong, and it will
    look a bit like a three-dimensional stick person with a huge bloated hydrocephalic
    head, but don''t worry about that. Think of it as a voodoo dolly.

    The next thing you need to do is to force your mind into believing that the dolly
    is genuinely imbued with the spirit of a real person, just as Francis Galton convinced
    himself that Mr Punch was a god. Bear in mind that the dolly has innumerable pins
    stuck in its head, which almost guarantees that the person you choose, whether
    it is David Blunkett, for example, or Gore Vidal, will shortly afterwards have
    their actual head attacked by a swarm of bees.'
