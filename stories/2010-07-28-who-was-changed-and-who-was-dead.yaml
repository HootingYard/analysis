  text: "\nNige has a postage about Barbara Comyns, which served to remind me that\
    \ Who Was Changed And Who Was Dead (1954) is one of my favourite novels, and without\
    \ any doubt the finest book in the popular outbreak-of-ergot-poisoning genre.\
    \ I have not reread it for years, so have removed it from the shelves in readiness.\n\
    Those who like to delve into such things may wish to know that I consider it an\
    \ important influence on my own scribblings. How could it not be, when, leafing\
    \ through it just now I note sentences such as:\nThere was a great smell of mud,\
    \ and it was the first of June.\nWe always have cocoa after a thunderstorm.\n\
    The village bachelor, drink-sodden Lumber Splinterbones, usually ambled along\
    \ to Grandmother Willoweed's birthday party.\nDennis was frightened of cows\n\
    and there should now be a question mark to end this sentence on a grammatically\
    \ sound footing, thus\u2026 ?"
