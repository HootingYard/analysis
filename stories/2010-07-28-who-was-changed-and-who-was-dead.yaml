    Nige has a postage about Barbara Comyns, which served to remind me that Who Was
    Changed And Who Was Dead (1954) is one of my favourite novels, and without any
    doubt the finest book in the popular outbreak-of-ergot-poisoning genre. I have
    not reread it for years, so have removed it from the shelves in readiness.

    Those who like to delve into such things may wish to know that I consider it an
    important influence on my own scribblings. How could it not be, when, leafing
    through it just now I note sentences such as:

    There was a great smell of mud, and it was the first of June.

    We always have cocoa after a thunderstorm.

    The village bachelor, drink-sodden Lumber Splinterbones, usually ambled along
    to Grandmother Willoweed''s birthday party.

    Dennis was frightened of cows

    and there should now be a question mark to end this sentence on a grammatically
    sound footing, thus... ?'
