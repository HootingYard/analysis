  text: 'Discouraging news reaches me about Dennis Beerpint. The weedy poet has, it
    seems, cast off his beatnik persona. In an interview with the magazine Ex-Beatnik
    Poets Speak Out! he says:

    "People will accuse me of selling out, but quite frankly I am sick and tired of
    sticking it to The Man, you dig? There''s no money in it. I want to be a people''s
    poet, like Carol Ann Duffy or Ian McMillan, but I am neither the Poet Laureate
    nor an irritating professional northerner. So when the Co-op offered me the position
    of surrealist-in-residence, I jumped at the chance."

    "Surreal" is a much-abused word these days, but it is surely appropriate to describe
    Beerpint''s first effort on the Co-op''s behalf. He was asked to add an intriguingly
    madcap line to the allergy advice on their jam doughnuts, and came up with this
    corker:

    These products have been prepared in an area that handles the following ingredients:
    Celery, Crustaceans, Fish, Lupins and Molluscs.

    Clearly, though he may indeed have "sold out", Dennis Beerpint has not lost his
    mojo.

    NOTE : Many thanks to Gaw for drawing this to my attention.'
