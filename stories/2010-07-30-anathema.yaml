  text: 'I don''t know about you, but increasingly I find myself compelled to cast
    anathemas, often at bus stops, supermarkets, and other sites of close contact
    with one''s fellow citizens. But getting the tone right can be the devil of a
    job. One wishes the curse to come across as neither deranged nor weedy, but rather
    as a considered, cogent, rational, searing, and--above all--unarguable response
    to the situation.

    How pleased I am, then, to have discovered this splendid outburst from Austin
    Osman Spare:

    "Your theology is a slime pit of gibberish become ethics. In your world where
    ignorance and deceit constitute felicity, everything ends miserably, besmirched
    with fratricidal blood."

    It is from his book Anathema Of Zos, A Sermon To The Hypocrites (1927) which I
    am clearly going to have to read, possibly even learn by heart. Further reading
    here and, enticingly, the opportunity in a couple of months'' time to see an exhibition
    of Spare''s work.
