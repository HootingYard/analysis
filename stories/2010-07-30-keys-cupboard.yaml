  text: 'Mr Key is delighted to announce that his global domination schemes continue
    apace. Now, in addition to this very Hooting Yard you are reading, the radio show
    and the vast archive of podcasts available from ResonanceFM, he has found another
    berth on what our Flemish pals call het internet. Very sensibly, the quintet of
    indefatigable blogpersons who have created The Dabbler : A Culture Blog have invited
    your favourite impoverished scribbler to occupy his own cupboard there.


    Postages will be placed in Key''s Cupboard once a week, probably on Fridays, and
    include a mix of brand new stuff written exclusively for The Dabbler and forgotten
    items long buried in the Hooting Yard archives.

    So hie ye over there right now, and make sure you read all the other interesting
    dabblings. (I particularly recommend the item about the Cobham Cuckoos.)'
