  text: "Mr Key is delighted to announce that his global domination schemes continue\
    \ apace. Now, in addition to this very Hooting Yard you are reading, the radio\
    \ show and the vast archive of podcasts available from ResonanceFM, he has found\
    \ another berth on what our Flemish pals call het internet. Very sensibly, the\
    \ quintet of indefatigable blogpersons who have created The Dabbler\_: A Culture\
    \ Blog have invited your favourite impoverished scribbler to occupy his own cupboard\
    \ there.\n\nPostages will be placed in Key's Cupboard once a week, probably on\
    \ Fridays, and include a mix of brand new stuff written exclusively for The Dabbler\
    \ and forgotten items long buried in the Hooting Yard archives.\nSo hie ye over\
    \ there right now, and make sure you read all the other interesting dabblings.\
    \ (I particularly recommend the item about the Cobham Cuckoos.)"
