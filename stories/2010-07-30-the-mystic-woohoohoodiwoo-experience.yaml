  text: "You would be surprised how often I am asked by readers if it possible to\
    \ somehow experience the mystic woohoohoodiwoo conjured up by the Woohoohoodiwoo\
    \ Woman in the deep dense weird woods, without actually having to enter the deep\
    \ dense weird woods for a moonlit encounter with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman herself.\
    \ In part, your surprise would be that anybody could manage to articulate that\
    \ question on an empty stomach. Until now, my standard answer has been \u201C\
    No, it is not possible to somehow experience the mystic woohoohoodiwoo conjured\
    \ up by the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman in the deep dense weird woods, without actually\
    \ having to enter the deep dense weird woods for a moonlit encounter with the\
    \ Woohoohoodiwoo Woman herself,\u201D although depending on how much time is at\
    \ my disposal I might just say \u201CNo\u201D or even slap the importuning reader\
    \ about the head with the outer packaging from a carton of smokers\u2019 poptarts.\n\
    I say \u201Cuntil now\u201D because, thanks to David Thompson, I have learned\
    \ of the activities of a certain Erial Ali. Click on this link, scroll down, slowly,\
    \ slowly, and be engulfed in mystic woohoohoodiwoo!"
