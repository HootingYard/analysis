  text: 'You would be surprised how often I am asked by readers if it possible to
    somehow experience the mystic woohoohoodiwoo conjured up by the Woohoohoodiwoo
    Woman in the deep dense weird woods, without actually having to enter the deep
    dense weird woods for a moonlit encounter with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman herself.
    In part, your surprise would be that anybody could manage to articulate that question
    on an empty stomach. Until now, my standard answer has been "No, it is not possible
    to somehow experience the mystic woohoohoodiwoo conjured up by the Woohoohoodiwoo
    Woman in the deep dense weird woods, without actually having to enter the deep
    dense weird woods for a moonlit encounter with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman herself,"
    although depending on how much time is at my disposal I might just say "No" or
    even slap the importuning reader about the head with the outer packaging from
    a carton of smokers'' poptarts.

    I say "until now" because, thanks to David Thompson, I have learned of the activities
    of a certain Erial Ali. Click on this link, scroll down, slowly, slowly, and be
    engulfed in mystic woohoohoodiwoo!'
