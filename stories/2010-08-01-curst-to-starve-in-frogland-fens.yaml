  text: 'So there I was, thinking that in Austin Osman Spare I had found my go-to
    guy for curses, imprecations and anathemas. That was until I came upon the Scots
    poet Allan Ramsay (1686-1758), of whom I was only dimly aware.

    What happened was this. It occurred to me this afternoon that it was a matter
    of utmost urgency that I discover the etymology of "frogman", specifically whether,
    at any point, the word "toadman" had been preferred. As always happens as soon
    as one consults the Oxford English Dictionary, I was blown off course. My attention
    was caught by "frogland", which is defined, not unexpectedly, as "marshy land
    in which frogs abound, as the Fens, Holland, etc." The first of a mere two citations
    in the OED is "1721 RAMSAY Tartana xxxiii, May she be curst to starve in frogland
    fens."

    My curiosity was piqued. Who was she and what had she done to deserve so awful
    a fate? I soon found an online edition of Allan Ramsay''s Poems of 1721 and read:

    May she be curst to starve in Frogland Fens, / To wear a Fala ragg''d at both
    the Ends, / Groan still beneath an antiquated Suit, / And die a Maid at fifty
    five to boot ; / May she turn quaggy Fat, or crooked Dwarff, / Be ridicul''d while
    primm''d up in her Scarff ; / May Spleen and Spite still keep her on the Fret,
    / And live till she outlive her Beauty''s Date ; / May all this fall, and more
    than I have said, / Upon that wench who disregards the Plaid.

    Gosh. This strikes me as a somewhat hysterical overreaction to someone eschewing
    the wearing of tartan, but then I am not a mad Scotsman, so what do I know?'
