  text: '"the Knyght was a little less than Perfect, and his horse did not have a
    metabolism"

    Preamble to A Knyght Ther Was by Robert F Young, Analog Science Fact & Fiction,
    July 1963

    This fragment from a pulp magazine was almost certainly the inspiration for Dobson''s
    important pamphlet, published, as it happened, on the day of the Kennedy assassination
    in Dallas, entitled, somewhat inelegantly,  A Comparative Study Of The Metabolisms
    Of The Horses Of Three Knights Of The Realm (out of print).

    Dobson begins with a bold declaration:

    In this pamphlet I am going to prove, beyond all reasonable doubt and brooking
    not one whit of opposition, that the horse of Sir Lancelot, of the Arthurian Round
    Table, had the metabolism of a squirrel, that the horse of his confrere Sir Bedivere
    had the metabolism of a gnat, and that the horse of Sir Cloudesley Shovell, of
    later date, had a metabolism so extraordinary and anomalous that science has yet
    to account for it. My findings, which will completely overturn the accepted wisdom
    regarding the metabolism of horses ridden by knights of the realm, are backed
    up by a wealth of evidence only I have had the energy and diligence to winkle
    out of the documentary record, and this evidence, in the form of a vast scholarly
    apparatus of footnotes and citations and what have you will be published in a
    separate series of pamphlets in due course.

    It never was--so the reader has to take on trust forty pages of wild assertion,
    idiotic wittering, equine ignorance, and frankly incomprehensible gibberish, all
    of it written, as we would expect, in majestic sweeping paragraphs. The pamphlet
    is remembered today chiefly for the much-anthologised passage about nosebags crammed
    with hay which, though factually inaccurate, has served as a model for many a
    novice pamphleteer. I well remember the way these words of Dobson''s transfixed
    me in my early, faltering stabs at composition, and how for years I was unable
    to write a finished piece without inserting something about hay in nosebags, no
    matter what my ostensible subject. It must be said that editors were kind to me.
    The inevitable rejection letters I received gently pointed out that I could easily
    delete the hay in nosebags stuff without fatally undermining my prose. But, oh!,
    I was young and headstrong and I would not countenance the change even of a comma
    to what I had scribbled so decisively with my propelling pencil on my tablet of
    notepaper. In those days, I cared not to pound the keys of a typewriter like Mancunian
    polymath Anthony Burgess. My hero Dobson was a scribbler, and so would I be.

    The truth of it was, of course, that without acknowledging the fact I was being
    smothered under the Dobson cushion, as so many beginners have been. My salvation,
    and the prompt that allowed me at long last to cast the cushion aside, was a commission
    from a now defunct magazine, Beasts Of Barnyard And Field, to pen an article about
    nosebags crammed with hay. I worried and fretted at it so much that, in nervously
    gnawing my propelling pencil I managed to get a sliver of lead stuck in my craw,
    and had to be enclinicked. It was the morning of my fifty-first day there when,
    sprawled on my balcony gazing at the mountains, I sensed a tiny yet dramatic shifting
    of the integuments within my head, and knew at once that I was free of Dobson.
    The mighty out of print pamphleteer will always remain my idol, but on that morning
    in that clinic on that balcony I knew it was possible for me to plough my own
    furrow.

    I tore up the few puny pages of prose I had written about hay in nosebags, and
    instead submitted to the magazine a piece about swill for pigs. Alas, later that
    day, listening to the news on the wireless in the clinic''s rumpus room, I learned
    that the skyscraper housing the offices of Beasts Of Barnyard And Field had collapsed
    after attack by woodworm and weevils and tiny, tiny beings that bore through cement,
    and the magazine had ceased publication. Ha!, I thought, I am not going to let
    that stop me. And it has not.'
