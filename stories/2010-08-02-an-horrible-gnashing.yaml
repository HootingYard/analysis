  text: "Forgive me for returning to Pliny's Natural History yet again. Here (in Philomen\
    \ Holland's English translation of 1634) he is surely describing the tribe or\
    \ grouplet which spawned the Grunty Man:\n\u201CTauron writeth, That the Choromandae\
    \ are a savage and wild people: distinct voice and speech they have none, but\
    \ in stead thereof, they keep an horrible gnashing and hideous noise: rough they\
    \ are and hairy all over their bodies, eies they have red like the houlets, and\
    \ toothed they be like dogs.\u201D\nEarlier, I cannot remember where, I have said\
    \ that the Grunty Man is older than the Earth itself, but now I may have to revise\
    \ that statement in the finished version of my ten thousand page biography The\
    \ Life And Times Of The Grunty Man! (The exclamation point in the title is quite\
    \ deliberate, and intended to impart a sense of excitement to what is otherwise,\
    \ I have to say, quite a dull narrative, consisting as it does chiefly of scenes\
    \ in which the Grunty Man grunts from within his grim dark foul-smelling lair,\
    \ century after century.)"
