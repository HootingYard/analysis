  text: '"Now certain Nations there be that account beasts, yea, and some filthie
    things for gods; yea and many other matters more shamefull to be spoken; swearing
    by stinking meats, by garlicke, and such like. But surely, to beleeve that gods
    have contracted mariage, and that in so long continuance of time no children should
    be borne between them : also that some are aged, and ever hoarie and gray: others
    againe young and alwaies children: that they be blacke of colour and complexion,
    winged, lame, hatched of eggs, living and dying each other day; are meere fooleries,
    little better than childish toies."

    Pliny The Elder, The Naturall Historie, The Second Booke, Chap. 7. Of God in the
    1634 English translation by Philomen Holland

    One person who was very familiar with the ancient idea that an egg might serve
    as a childish toy, and that from the egg would hatch a god, was Tiny Enid. On
    the day of her birth she was presented with an egg by her mysterious, unnamed
    mentor, and as soon as she grew old enough for childish play it became her favoured
    toy. It is easy to forget, given the plucky tot''s many deeds of heroism and derring-do,
    that she was still but a tot, and, when time allowed, she played as other tots
    do. She played games such as Hide The Egg In The Pantry, Roll The Egg Down A Gentle
    Incline, and Balance The Egg On A Precipice Over A Yawning Chasm.

    It is not entirely clear when Tiny Enid learned that her egg contained an as yet
    unhatched god. It is also perfectly possible that it did not, and that the venturesome
    little fascist simply invented the idea for purposes of self-dramatisation. Either
    way, we do know that one hot summer''s day she stopped treating the egg as a plaything,
    placed it in a carton, put the carton on her mantelpiece, and spent many hours
    watching over it, waiting for it to hatch.

    Several writers--better to call them hacks--have devoted vast swathes of psychobabble
    to the suggestion that Tiny Enid was convinced, or convinced herself, that by
    embarking on ever greater feats of infant heroism she could somehow persuade the
    god to crack open its egg and burst forth into the world, ushering in a new dispensation
    under the cope of heaven and, not incidentally, installing the tot as its Archangel.
    In this reading, Tiny Enid is impelled to acts and adventures of ever greater
    recklessness for purely selfish reasons. The hacks who peddle this stuff never
    stop to consider two blindingly obvious facts. One, it makes no sense whatsoever,
    and two, there is no evidence that, at the end of each of her adventures, Tiny
    Enid dashed back to her mantelpiece to check on the egg. On the contrary, she
    was notorious for sticking around to receive plaudits and medals and cups and
    cash prizes and to watch parades pass by in her honour, and on occasions when
    these things did not happen, she would bash a few heads together, literally, until
    she considered due gratitude was displayed. These are not the activities of one
    who hankers for the imminent intervention of the divine, whether from an egg or
    from anywhere else.

    Indeed, a better case could be made that a child as self-possessed and drunk on
    her own reputation as Tiny Enid would consider the arrival of a new god as fatally
    stealing her thunder. It is worth asking what sort of god she was expecting to
    hatch from the egg on her mantelpiece. Although she was not a religious girl,
    it is a matter of record that she had, like the Swiss skiing ace Woodcarver Steiner,
    great ecstasies. During these entrancements, did she have visions of her egg-hatched
    god? It is a great pity that she never left us an account of at least one of her
    great ecstasies in her Memoirs. The egg itself is mentioned, over and over again,
    at first in references to its status as a plaything, as here, on page 47:

    I passed many a happy hour playing Carry The Egg Towards The Pond and other delightful
    pastimes

    and then, from page 88 onwards, she constantly reminds us of its numinous presence:

    Before revving up my jalopy to speed to the rescue of the stricken and the maimed
    who had been attacked by the giant lobster being, I paused to look at the egg
    in its carton on the mantelpiece. It had not yet hatched.

    for example, and

    The next Thursday was a particularly dull day without any opportunity for daring
    rescues of those imperilled. I spent much of my time contemplating the egg in
    its carton on the mantelpiece, from which no god had yet hatched.

    In her lifetime, no god ever did hatch from the egg, but I suppose it is not impossible
    that one might still do so. For though Tiny Enid herself grew old and died, she
    always kept the egg with her wherever she roamed in her long life, and at her
    death it was found among her effects. Carefully catalogued by those who keep her
    flame alive, the egg, in its carton, is now kept in the Tiny Enid Museum, recently
    established in a cavernous hangar on a so-called "rustic industrial estate" on
    the edge of the mephitic marshes on the outskirts of Pointy Town. If you visit,
    and pay through the nose for an entrance ticket, seek out the egg in its refrigerated
    chamber, and who knows?, perhaps while you are there you will see the shell crack,
    and a god hatch out, come blind and trembling into the world.'
