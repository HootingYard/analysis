  text: 'I was striding manfully across Sawdust Bridge, on my way to see a man about
    some snails, when I was accosted and harangued by a gobby git. His speech, if
    one can call it that, was indecorous and unseemly, and his head was somewhat larger
    than the usual head. I wondered if, in his infancy, his fontanelle had sealed
    properly, or if it remained ajar, as it were, allowing a surfeit of oxygen into
    his cranium. Were that the case, it might, just might, account for his loud haranguing.
    For loud it was, drawing the attention of other citizens passing along the bridge,
    each of whom gazed at him, and at me, before hurrying along bent upon whatever
    errands they were bent upon, that morning.

    I found it very difficult to judge whether his torso was clothed in a pullover
    or a cardigan. The garment seemed to resist definition. It was certainly not a
    sweater nor a jumper, nor could it be called a "top", but I could not pinpoint
    exactly what it was. Such was the nature of his harangue that it was impossible
    to interrupt him, so I had no opportunity to question him on the matter. The presence
    of buttons argued for a cardigan, yet it was not quite a cardigan, having a definite
    something of the pullover about it. It began to rain.

    Atop the git''s unusually large head perched a yellow oilcloth sou''wester, suggesting
    to me that he was not neglectful of meteorological conditions. Given the size
    of his head, the sou''wester, which would have served as adequate cover for most
    heads, looked comically tiny. It occurred to me that he might wear it in rain
    or shine, as protection for his unsealed fontanelle, and that its keeping the
    rainfall off the top of his head was secondary, a sort of bonus. Meanwhile, with
    a certain brio, I unfurled my brolly. I held it aloft as if I were Liberty brandishing
    her flambeau, though necessarily at an angle better poised to bar raindrops from
    falling on my head.

    And just as my brolly barred the raindrops, so the gobby git barred my progress
    further along Sawdust Bridge towards my appointment with the snails chap. As he
    delivered his loud and unseemly stream of invective, he constantly shifted his
    position so that he was always standing directly in front of me, as I feinted
    this way and that in my attempts to go where I wanted to go. I ought to have lashed
    out at him with my brolly, but long, long ago I made a vow. Well, if I am honest,
    I was forced to make a vow, on pain of eternal punishment in the hereafter, and
    with the added spur of the threat of having my fontanelle pierced and punctured
    in the here and now. The important thing, for present purposes, was that the vow
    had been made, and I held to it.

    Raindrops were falling at a slight angle upon the buttons of the gobby git''s
    cardigan or pullover, and thence dripping to his feet which, I noted, were shod
    in the sock-and-sandal combination associated with a certain stereotype. He did
    not seem at all that type, to me, there on Sawdust Bridge in the morning rain,
    delivering his loud harangue and accompanying it now with wild gesticulations.
    I did not feel menaced by these gesticulations, for at no point did his arms move
    towards my head or my body. They were, rather, like the movements of the sails
    of a windmill, or of a swimming person doing the butterfly stroke. They seemed
    curiously disconnected from his harangue, neither emphasising points within his
    indecorous guttural bawling, if indeed there were any, nor accompanying it in
    any way. Also, he was wearing mittens.

    There was a spattering of yellow stains upon the mittens, an identical shade to
    the patches of yellow on his moustache, which was of the walrus variety. I jumped
    to the conclusion that it was either mustard or custard, perhaps from the eating
    of a hot dog or a custard tart. I was unable to discern any crumbs, the composition
    of which, of bread or pastry, would have confirmed which of my suspicions was
    the correct one, although of course it was possible that the stains were neither
    mustard nor custard but another yellow substance entirely. Again, so unstoppable
    was the gobby git''s harangue that I was unable to question him on the point.

    When, long ago, I made, or was forced to make, my vow, I was vouchsafed a few
    tips about what I could do, in circumstances where I might wish to lash out with
    my brolly, instead of lashing out with my brolly, but with similar effect. One
    is rarely vouchsafed anything at all nowadays, but as I said, it was long, long
    ago. As I peered at the gobby git''s rather gauche cheesecloth trousers--or were
    they pantaloons?--one of these tips bubbled up from the sea of memory and bobbed
    to the surface. "Tilt your head heavenward," I recalled being told, "And call
    out, lustily, and high in pitch, for all the angels in heaven to beclabber together
    and send down to you a deus ex machina!"

    Now I have never knowingly seen an angel, and instinctively I feel such a creature
    cannot really exist, but the gobby git was getting on my wick by this time, and
    so I followed the old advice I had been vouchsafed. Of course, when I tilted my
    head heavenward all I saw was the dry underside of my brolly, so I shifted it
    to one side, again with I hope no little brio, and, though raindrops immediately
    splashed upon my face, I sang out, imploring the aid of quite probably fictional
    unearthly winged beings. And do you know, all at once there was a mighty gust
    of wind across the bridge, and the sou''wester atop the gobby git''s head was
    blown clear away, it skimmed and swooped across the sky like a bright yellow bird,
    and a raindrop, perhaps more than one, raindrops plural, fell directly through
    his unsealed fontanelle and landed splish splosh upon his exposed brain, and he
    crumpled to the ground and--oh, at last, at last--he ceased haranguing me, for
    he neither spoke now nor croaked. He was silent.

    I left him where he lay, sprawled upon the paving slabs, whether dead or alive
    I did not know, and I hurried onward to meet my appointment with the snails man.
    We transacted useful business, repaired to a canteen for luncheon, parted with
    a handshake in the shade of a gigantic shrub in the botanical gardens, and I made
    my way home. Crossing Sawdust Bridge, I saw no sign of the gobby git who had harangued
    me, and I learned later, listening to a local news bulletin on the wireless, that
    he had died, upon the bridge, that morning, of water on the brain.

    I attended his funeral later that week, and placed a bunch of dandelions in the
    graveside mud. It was still raining.'
