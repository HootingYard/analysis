  text: 'In an email I sent to someone the other day, I confessed to having an inner
    Guardian-reading armchair lefty airhead nestling within me, adding the parenthetical
    comment that he needs to be bludgeoned into submission. In truth, my inner woolly-brained
    "progressive" loon has been shrivelling up slowly but surely for quite some time.
    It won''t take a bludgeon to bash him utterly senseless.

    And indeed it has not, for today I have finally understood the obvious superiority
    of capitalism. I really have.

    There is, this week, in Trafalgar Square, a temporary maze. It is open from 11
    am to 8 pm, entrance is free, and it is a proper maze, with wrong turns and dead
    ends and, best of all, hedges higher than Mr Key''s head. I blundered through
    it this afternoon, in sunshine after rainfall, and enjoyed myself, if not quite
    immensely, then enough, enough. It was a diverting fifteen minutes, wandering
    through a high hedge maze slap bang in the middle of London.

    My pleasure was soured only by the fact that, on the blue plaques dotted hither
    and thither within the maze, I noted a number of typos. "Fred Astair" without
    a final "e"? A misplaced apostrophe in "Beatle''s"? I have come to expect such
    slapdashery, but still it never fails to depress me. The blue plaques themselves,
    by the way, give a clue to one reason for the maze being there in the first place,
    which is that it''s meant to boost the West End as a tourist hub. There are no
    advertisements for particular shops or restaurants, just the general message that
    this is a place of great historical interest which now, in the twenty-first century,
    is the world''s finest and most popular retail ''n'' leisure complex (or words
    to that effect). That''s one reason why the maze is there, the other being, of
    course, simply to provide people with the chance, for a week, to walk through
    a maze in Trafalgar Square, at no cost, and without having your forehead tattooed
    with a corporate logo or some such marketing ploy.

    But why has it made me embrace the joys of capitalism? For one very simple reason.
    Those high hedges, of which the maze is constructed, were provided by RentaHedge!
    What a fantastic idea for a business, one which--crucially--no bureaucrat or civic
    functionary would ever think up. I am lost in admiration for the entrepreneurial
    genius who, one day, thought: "I know! I will make a living by renting hedges
    to people!"

    Sadly, my own talents do not lie in that direction, so I shall continue to plough
    my lonely furrow of prose. Pansy Cradledew suggested starting a business called
    RentaSedge(warbler), renting sedge warblers to those who needed a temporary sedge
    warbler, but a bank manager took one look at the business plan and reached for
    his bludgeon. Heigh ho.'
