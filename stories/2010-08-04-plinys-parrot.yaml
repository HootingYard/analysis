  text: 'Conjure up an image of the ancient world. Do you see a betoga''d fellow beating
    a bird about the bonce with an iron bar? No? Then read your Pliny. Here he is,
    in the Natural History, telling us about parrots:

    "She hath an head as hard as is her beak: when she learns to speak, she must be
    beaten about the head with a rod of yron: for otherwise she careth for no blowes."

    ADDENDUM : Pliny''s seventeenth-century English translator Philomen Holland uses
    the phrase "barton & mue" for aviary. This is splendid, and I suggest we all take
    every opportunity to resurrect so grievous a loss to the language. You may wish
    to write a note of it in your day-book, particularly if, as Pliny/Holland says
    elsewhere, your "memory is so shittle, [you] will soone forget the same againe".'
