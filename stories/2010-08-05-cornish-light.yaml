  text: "Much as I am enamoured of the idea of sun worship, as practised by Aztec\
    \ fundamentalists and the islanders in The Wicker Man, among others, I cannot\
    \ help but feel John Donne was right when he described the golden orb as a \u201C\
    busie old foole\u201D. At Hooting Yard, it is usually overcast, or raining, or\
    \ snow-smothered, which is just how we like it. (To those of you who live in snowless\
    \ regions, be advised that snow is nothing else but the foam or froth of rainwater\
    \ from heaven.)\nOne person who I suspect would have agreed with me was the painter\
    \ Karl Weschke. When asked if he chose to live in Cornwall because of the quality\
    \ of the light, he replied: \u201CCornish light? I've got a 60-watt light-bulb\
    \ and I keep the curtains closed.\u201D\nSee how much one can learn by reading\
    \ The Dabbler?"
