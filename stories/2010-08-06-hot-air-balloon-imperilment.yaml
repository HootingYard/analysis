  text: 'She was a plucky tot, a heroic infant, and a little fascist... but was Tiny
    Enid also a feminist pioneer? On the face of it, the answer to that question seems
    self-evident. How else would one describe the club-footed young gal, pootling
    about in her clapped-out jalopy, puffing away at cheroots, essaying deeds of matchless
    valour, and giving a variety of malefactors a good kicking? Yet such were the
    constraints imposed by society on what was deemed seemly, Tiny Enid oftbetimes
    made great pretence of being a helpless weedy flibbertigibbety waif, ready to
    swoon away or throw a fit of the vapours. Sometimes she put on such a show even
    while performing one of her brave deeds. In this picture, for example, it looks
    as if Tiny Enid is about to topple from a hot air balloon basket, and is being
    saved by a pair of tender-hearted ruffians. She is, of course, acting out the
    part expected of her in a patriarchal culture. What is actually happening here
    is that Tiny Enid is cleverly distracting the ruffians--card-carrying members
    of the Communist Party, no less!--for, moments after the sketch was completed,
    she was back in the basket, her big black boot stamping on the neck of one ruffian
    while the other flung himself overboard in a cowardly escape from the tot''s righteous
    wrath.
