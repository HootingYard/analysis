  text: "\u201CAre not some men themselves meere poisons by nature? for these slanderers\
    \ and backbiters in the world, what doe they else but lance poison out of their\
    \ black tongues, like hideous serpents? what doe these envious persons, but with\
    \ their malicious and poisonfull breath sindge and burne all before them that\
    \ they can reach or meet with, finding fault with every thing whatsoever? Are\
    \ they not well and fitly compared to those cursed souls flying in the dark, which\
    \ albeit they sequester themselves from birds of the day, yet they bewray their\
    \ spight and envy even to the night and the quiet repose thereof, by their heavie\
    \ grones (the only voice that they utter) disquieting and troubling those that\
    \ be at rest: and finally, all one they be with those unluckie creatures, which\
    \ if they happen to meet or crosse the way upon a man, presage alwaies some ill\
    \ toward, opposing themselves (as it were) to all goodnesse, and hindering whatsoever\
    \ is profitable for this life. Neither do these monstrous and abominable sprites\
    \ know any other reward of this their deadly breath, their cursed and detestable\
    \ malice, but to hate and abhor all things.\u201D\nPliny The Elder, The Naturall\
    \ Historie, The Eighteenth Booke, Chap. 1. Of the venomes of man, in the 1634\
