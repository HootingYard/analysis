  text: In the potsage a few days ago regarding the keeping of a list of books one
    has read, I completely forgot to mention one "voracious reader" whose list goes
    back over forty years to 1968 and is available for all to see online. Yes, 'tis
    Art Garfunkel, golden-voiced croonperson and thespian. When you are done checking
    to see which books you and "The G" (as he is called on one section of his site)
    have both read, you may wish to investigate his transcontinental walks (of both
    the USA and Europe). Oscar Wilde famously said that all Art is quite useless,
    but clearly he was not referring to Mr Garfunkel.
