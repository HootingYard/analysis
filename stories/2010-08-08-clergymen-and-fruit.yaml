  text: '"Ministers of religion have always been attached to their orchards. Ever
    since the Serpent induced Eve to eat of a particular apple and Eve tempted Adam
    to do the same, the livelihood of the clergy has depended upon a proper appreciation
    of fruit."

    Bedside Author", in Extraordinary People (1965)'
