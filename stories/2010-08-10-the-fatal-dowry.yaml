  text: "\u201CThe Fatal Dowry has been cobbled, I see, by some purblind ultra-crepidarian\
    \ -McCready's friend, Walker, very likely; but nevertheless, I maintain 'tis a\
    \ good play, and might have been rendered very effective by docking it of the\
    \ whole fifth act, which is an excrescence,\u2014re-creating Novall, and making\
    \ Beaumelle a great deal more ghost-gaping and moonlightish. The cur-tailor has\
    \ taken out the most purple piece in the whole web\u2014the end of the fourth\
    \ Act\u2014and shouldered himself into toleration through the prejudices of the\
    \ pit, when he should have built his admiration on their necks. Say what you will,\
    \ I am convinced the man who is to awaken the drama must be a bold trampling fellow,\
    \ no creeper into worm-holes, no reviver even, however good. These reanimations\
    \ are vampire-cold. Such ghosts as Marloe, Webster &c. are better dramatists,\
    \ better poets, I dare say, than any contemporary of ours, but they are ghosts;\
    \ the worm is in their pages; and we want to see something that our great-grandsires\
    \ did not know. With the greatest reverence for all the antiquities of the drama,\
    \ I still think that we had better beget than revive; attempt to give the literature\
    \ of this age an idiosyncrasy and spirit of its own, and only raise a ghost to\
    \ gaze on, not to live with\u2014just now the drama is a haunted ruin.\u201D\n\
    Thomas Lovell Beddoes (1803\u20131849), letter to Thomas Forbes Kelsall, 11 January\
    \ 1825"
