  text: '"The Fatal Dowry has been cobbled, I see, by some purblind ultra-crepidarian
    -McCready''s friend, Walker, very likely; but nevertheless, I maintain ''tis a
    good play, and might have been rendered very effective by docking it of the whole
    fifth act, which is an excrescence,--re-creating Novall, and making Beaumelle
    a great deal more ghost-gaping and moonlightish. The cur-tailor has taken out
    the most purple piece in the whole web--the end of the fourth Act--and shouldered
    himself into toleration through the prejudices of the pit, when he should have
    built his admiration on their necks. Say what you will, I am convinced the man
    who is to awaken the drama must be a bold trampling fellow, no creeper into worm-holes,
    no reviver even, however good. These reanimations are vampire-cold. Such ghosts
    as Marloe, Webster &c. are better dramatists, better poets, I dare say, than any
    contemporary of ours, but they are ghosts; the worm is in their pages; and we
    want to see something that our great-grandsires did not know. With the greatest
    reverence for all the antiquities of the drama, I still think that we had better
    beget than revive; attempt to give the literature of this age an idiosyncrasy
    and spirit of its own, and only raise a ghost to gaze on, not to live with--just
    now the drama is a haunted ruin."

    Thomas Lovell Beddoes (1803-1849), letter to Thomas Forbes Kelsall, 11 January
