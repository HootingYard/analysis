  text: "McCready's friend, Walker, was not the only purblind ultra-crepidarian cobbling\
    \ plays on the theatrical stage two hundred years ago. There were others, none\
    \ more energetic than producer, director, actor, playwright, stage manager, impresario,\
    \ dramaturge, and scene-shifter Jarvis Greasecollar. Damn near forgotten today,\
    \ for the first two decades of the nineteenth century, he had, in George Bernard\
    \ Shaw's words, \u201Cthe advantage of a celebrity that is not idolatry and a\
    \ regard that is untainted by a secret abhorrence of the angry ape posing as a\
    \ god\u201D, (although Shaw was writing about somebody else).\nGreasecollar made\
    \ his name with the production, in a crumbling theatre in a seaside town, of The\
    \ Thick Fog, a one-act play he probably wrote himself, although some claim it\
    \ to be an adaptation of a jeu d'esprit by Swausage. He followed it, at another\
    \ crumbling theatre in another seaside town, with The Impenetrable Mist, this\
    \ time a two-act play adapted, certainly, from one of Swausage's opera bouffes.\
    \ Critics from the capital city, hearing of the unprecedented enthusiasm of seaside\
    \ theatregoers, flocked to the coast to see for themselves. \u201CSeldom has so\
    \ purblind an ultra-crepidarian cobbled such a play at the seaside!\u201D crowed\
    \ the (anonymous) critic of The Weekly Starling.\nShowered with offers to open\
    \ his next production at big important theatres in the capital, Greasecollar declined,\
    \ and moved further along the coast. In a theatre so crumbled that it was open\
    \ to the elements, he unveiled Oh! Tenebrous Gloom, a three-act play with a cast\
    \ of hundreds. It opens with the memorable lines \u201CCold-hearted orb that rules\
    \ the night / Removes the colours from our sight / Red is grey and yellow white\
    \ / But we decide which is right / And which is an illusion\u201D, a declaration\
    \ that was to inspire fey long-haired airheads a century and a half later.\nFollowing\
    \ this triumph, Greasecollar was given a knighthood and married his leading lady,\
    \ Edith Sebag, herself no mean ultra-crepidarian, though she was never purblind.\
    \ She collaborated with him on several later plays, including The Foul Blizzard,\
    \ Chasm Of Death, The Little Incey-Wincey Bunny Rabbits, and Croaks From A Plague\
    \ Pit.\nIn 1821, for unfathomable reasons, Jarvis Greasecollar's star waned, and\
    \ not a theatre in the land would stage, nor cobble, one of his productions. He\
    \ fell out with Swausage, endured a mysterious calamity in yet another seaside\
    \ town, and his wife ran off with a dapper gentleman of foreign extraction. Years\
    \ later, she was to play a shadowy role\_as a counter-revolutionary\_in the revolutionary\
    \ turmoil that engulfed a continent.\nIn 1837, by now in quite a disgusting state,\
    \ Greasecollar was found sprawled on a pebbly beach howling at the cold-hearted\
    \ orb\u2026 sorry, at the moon. He was carted off to an asylum, where he died\
    \ at the advanced age of one-hundred-and-twenty-two on the day of Queen Victoria's\
    \ funeral in 1901. A purblind ultra-crepidarian to the last, he toppled from his\
    \ earthly socket into the dust. He left behind an unfinished manuscript, his final\
    \ play, Toppling Into The Dust. It has never been performed, nor cobbled, nor\
    \ even read."
