    One would think so from the exciting headline ''Radioactive boars'' on loose in
    Germany (pity about those quotation marks) which suggests packs of demented glow-in-the-dark
    beasts rampaging through the Teutonic forests, attacking woodcutters and orphans
    roaming lost in the woods. Alas, the boars feed on mushrooms, truffles and wild
    berries rather than human flesh.
