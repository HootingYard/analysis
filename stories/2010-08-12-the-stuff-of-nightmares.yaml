  text: "The stuff of nightmares\u2026 or at least of a gleefully low-budget horror\
    \ film. One would think so from the exciting headline \u2018Radioactive boars\u2019\
    \ on loose in Germany (pity about those quotation marks) which suggests packs\
    \ of demented glow-in-the-dark beasts rampaging through the Teutonic forests,\
    \ attacking woodcutters and orphans roaming lost in the woods. Alas, the boars\
    \ feed on mushrooms, truffles and wild berries rather than human flesh.\n\nWild\
    \ boar (non-radioactive version)"
