  text: "One of the more intriguing Sherlock Holmes cases unrecorded by Dr Watson\
    \ is the affair of the bogus laundry. It is mentioned in The Adventure Of The\
    \ Cardboard Box, where Inspector Lestrade writes to Holmes:\n\u201CHe is a big,\
    \ powerful chap, clean-shaven, and very swarthy\u2014something like Aldridge,\
    \ who helped us in the bogus laundry affair.\u201D\nI suppose \u201Claundry\u201D\
    \ here refers to the business establishment, to what we might today call a launderette,\
    \ rather than to the stuff itself, cravats and sheets and shirts and socks etc.\
    \ gathered in a hamper. But perhaps not. Given the wild fancies of Conan Doyle's\
    \ imagination, either is possible.\nAnd, just as the word \u201Claundry\u201D\
    \ is open to more than one interpretation, so is \u201Cmodel\u201D. What are we\
    \ to make of this, recently drawn to our attention by Backwatersman?\n\nA model\
    \ laundry? Abstracted, perhaps, from a model village like Bekonscot and left to\
    \ fend for itself in a Derbyshire townlet? \u201CCome, tinies, we are going on\
    \ an outing to see the model laundry!\u201D If the hampers of laundry in the model\
    \ laundry are bogus, what then? What then?\nIt is enough to give me a swimming\
    \ in the head."
