text: "\u201CI see there was a short piece in the Guardian Review yesterday about\
  \ authors making appearances in their own work, how it is usually done out of vanity\
  \ but can, as in the cases of John Fowles or Martin Amis or Paul Auster or, recently,\
  \ Michel Houllebecq, be a vehicle for self-criticism or bleak self-awareness, though\
  \ the general view is that it is almost always a terrible idea,\u201D said Frank\
  \ Key, a vision of magnificence with his tremendous bouffant and glorious cravat,\
  \ his noble pulsating brain throbbing with fantastic vibrations.\n\u201CFor god's\
  \ sake stop wittering and put a sock in it,\u201D said Pansy Cradledew.\nIt was\
  \ a summer's day in the twenty-first century, on another planet."
