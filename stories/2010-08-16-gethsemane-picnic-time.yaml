  text: 'One vile broiling August afternoon, Blodgett sold his birthright for a mess
    of pottage. Ever the wheeler-dealer, he then immediately sold the mess of pottage
    to a wealthy fool for thirty pieces of silver. Blodgett licked his lips and punched
    the air with his hairy fist. "At last!" he thought, "I have sufficient funds to
    organise a picnic in the Garden of Gethsemane!"

    Blodgett travelled thither by hot air balloon. He was accompanied by his next
    door neighbours at the time, a peevish couple who rarely spoke directly to each
    other but babbled incessantly at Blodgett, who eventually stuffed cotton wool
    into his ears. For all his faults, Blodgett was a singularly honourable fellow,
    and he felt a sense of obligation to Mr and Mrs Fagash for a favour done to him
    long ago, though he could no longer remember what it was. Thus he was able to
    kill two birds with one stone, as they say, by fulfilling a personal picnicking
    ambition at the same time as repaying a moral debt by providing a treat for an
    elderly impoverished couple.

    The picnic hamper was an exact replica, scaled down, of the balloon basket. The
    wicker of which both were woven had even come from the same wicker factory. Blodgett
    had stocked the hamper before the voyage with much provender from his favourite
    picnic supplies shop. Without bothering to quiz Mr and Mrs Fagash on any dietary
    preferences they may harbour, he had spent some of his pieces of silver on sausages
    and lemonade and sandwich paste and pork scratchings and flan and jam and buns
    and sultanas and mashed potatoes and raw liver and meringue and plums and milk.
    The threesome took it in turns to keep flies away by waving fans, of the same
    wicker as the hamper and the balloon basket. Flies, they knew, would find a way
    to wriggle through the tiniest gaps in the wickerwork.

    If it had been vile and broiling back at home, it was even more vile and more
    broiling in the Garden of Gethsemane when their balloon basket thumped to earth.
    Blodgett himself broke out in a sweat so deep it was as it were great drops of
    blood falling down to the ground, like Christ. Hearing a series of bangs from
    inside the hamper, he realised the sausages were exploding. Mrs Fagash, who was
    a devout Catholic, suggested they seek shelter from the sun in the misnamed Grotto
    of the Agony, and as they staggered towards it, she explained the misnomer, dating
    back to the removal of a stone in the fourteenth century. Blodgett found it hard
    to follow what she was saying, and resolved to consult a reference work when he
    returned home after the picnic. He was beginning to wonder how sinful it would
    be to abandon Mr and Mrs Fagash in the grotto and make the trip back alone.

    In all the years he had dreamed of this picnic, Blodgett never envisaged that
    he would find himself sitting in a dark cave eating raw liver in the company of
    a pair of scowling geriatrics. Even the lemonade had gone flat, due to a bottling
    mishap. As he chewed and glugged and swatted away flies, he reflected that perhaps
    he would have been better not to sell his mess of pottage, which even now the
    wealthy fool would be lapping up in the cool luxury of a shaded arbour. And he
    further reflected that it might have been better never to have sold his birthright
    for the mess of pottage in the first place. For what had he gained?, what had
    he gained?

    It was this thought, as gloomy as the gloom of the grotto, that was bloating in
    Blodgett''s brain when, inside the hamper, the last unexploded sausage exploded
    with a mighty bang. Birds scattered from the branches of the olive trees outside.

    "Forgive me, Mr and Mrs Fagash, for I know not what I do," blurted Blodgett. He
    stood up, flicked crumbs from his person, and sprinted out of the Grotto of the
    Agony across the garden to the hot air balloon. He clambered into the basket and
    set the burners roaring, and very soon he was aloft, and he sailed away into the
    blue.
