  text: "With my siphon and funnel I march to the hills, stamping on insects to add\
    \ to my kills. I have distributed thousands of pills, and now I must hide in a\
    \ grot.\nMy siphon! My siphon! I dropped it back there. I must go and fetch it\
    \ while the weather stands fair. I will need it within my elfin grot lair. So\
    \ I retrace my steps at a trot.\nMy pathway is barred by a knight at arms. Alone\
    \ and pale, he lacks all charms. I think I have seen him patrolling the farms,\
    \ the farms where I poisoned the poultry.\nPalely loitering like a monitor lizard,\
    \ the knight plunges his lance right into my gizzard. \u201CI am no knight, I'm\
    \ a pinball wizard!\u201D cries this latter-day Roger Daltrey.\nI crumple to earth\
    \ and let fall my funnel. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.\_A clich\xE9\
    \ I know, but as long as the sun'll shine I'll stay clear of the fiery pit.\n\
    The wizard twirls a mic on the end of a lead. By Christ, it is Roger Daltrey indeed!\
    \ Is he going to sing in my hour of need? He's such a preposterous git!\nI reach\
    \ for my funnel and chuck it at him. But the light at the end of the tunnel grows\
    \ dim. My immediate prospects are decidedly grim. To die at the hands of The Who!\n\
    \u201CSee me, feel me, touch me \u2013\u201D I groan. \u201CNo, you must reap\
    \ what you have sown\u201D says Daltrey as I wail and moan. I am but left to rue.\n\
    I rue that I killed every hen, every duck, all the innocent pigs in their filthy\
    \ muck. I was being an evil countryside Puck. Now I just want my Mommy.\nGore\
    \ spouts from my gizzard, my life leaks away. But worse is to come \u2018fore\
    \ I call it a day. With his awful hair like a bale of hay, Daltrey shakes it and\
    \ starts to sing \u201CTommy\u201D.\nAt the last, the mercy of God doth abide.\
    \ As he opened his gob, I died."
