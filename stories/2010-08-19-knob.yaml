  text: "\nKnob.\nFrom an exquisite alphabet at Ptak Science Books, originally published\
    \ in 1879, the year of the felling of Binsey Poplars. Not that there is the remotest\
    \ link between Kantner's Illustrated Book of Objects and Self-Educator in German\
    \ and English and Father Hopkins\u2019 aspens dear. I just thought I'd mention\
    \ it. I can't see that year written down without thinking of them."
