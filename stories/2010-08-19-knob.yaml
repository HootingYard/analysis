    Knob.

    From an exquisite alphabet at Ptak Science Books, originally published in 1879,
    the year of the felling of Binsey Poplars. Not that there is the remotest link
    between Kantner''s Illustrated Book of Objects and Self-Educator in German and
    English and Father Hopkins'' aspens dear. I just thought I''d mention it. I can''t
    see that year written down without thinking of them.'
