  text: 'From an obituary in the Telegraph:

    "Bill Millin, who died on August 17 aged 88, was personal piper to Lord Lovat
    on D-Day and piped the invasion forces on to the shores of France; unarmed apart
    from the ceremonial dagger in his stocking, he played unflinchingly as men fell
    all around him. Millin began his apparently suicidal serenade immediately upon
    jumping from the ramp of the landing craft into the icy water. As the Cameron
    tartan of his kilt floated to the surface he struck up with Hieland Laddie. He
    continued even as the man behind him was hit, dropped into the sea and sank. Once
    ashore Millin did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series
    of tunes...

    "[Later...] Millin was surprised not to have been shot, and he mentioned this
    to some Germans who had been taken prisoner. They said that they had not shot
    at him because they thought he had gone off his head."
