  text: 'Some months ago we turned our attention to the modern pig, and I am pleased
    to post this letter received from Outa_Spaceman in which he recalls his very own
    modern pig experience:

    Many years ago one of my ''in-between-jobs'' was as a security guard. I had to
    look after a ''pig trap''. It looked like a bungalow-sized oil refinery, all red
    painted pipes, valves and exciting gauges. It was positioned in a small village
    called Lofthouse at the top of Nidderdale.

    The ''intelligent'' pig (iPig?) had been inserted at Billingham and trundled down
    the pipeline inspecting and cleaning as it went. Boffins monitored its progress,
    via in-built T.V. cameras, in a portakabin alongside the pig trap. My job was
    to make sure no yokels attempted to interfere with the installation, as the pipeline
    carried a highly explosive pressurised gas (methane I think).

    At the end of my night-long vigil I decided to stay and wait for the pig to arrive
    and watch the trap being ''blown''. Frantic boffin activity, lots of valve opening
    and closing, the pig arrived in the trap and the methane burnt off. It created
    the biggest sheet of flame I''ve ever seen and, even though I was a good way off,
    singed my eyebrows. After tests and recalibration the pig was reinserted and sent
    off toward Stanlow.

    For me the most amazing fact is that there''s a pipeline that connects one side
    of the country to the other via the Pennines.'
