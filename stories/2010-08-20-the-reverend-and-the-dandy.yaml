  text: "Yesterday's crumbs of Babinskiana provoked an inundation of letters from\
    \ female readers imploring me to post a picture of the Reverend John Chippendall\
    \ Montesquieu Bellew, he of the head of hair like a great ball of spun white silk,\
    \ so they could print it, cut it out, put it in a frame, and make it the centrepiece\
    \ of a shrine at which they could adore him, as so many women did when he was\u2014\
    becomingly, remember\u2014alive. I managed to track the Reverend down here, where\
    \ you may note he is categorised not merely under \u201Ccassock\u201D, \u201C\
    clergyman\u201D and \u201CVictorian\u201D but also \u201Carms crossed\u201D and\
    \ \u201Ckeen eyed\u201D. Et voila!\n\nNot to be outdone, a plethora of male readers\
    \ beseeched me, similarly, to post a picture of Jules Am\xE9d\xE9e Barbey d'Aur\xE9\
    villy, the boulevard magnifico, of the gold-knobbed cane and hand-held mirror,\
    \ no doubt so they could pick up some invaluable tips on personal grooming. As\
    \ always, I am happy to oblige.\n\nPlease note that these pictures are of Bellew\
    \ and Barbey d'Aur\xE9villy themselves, not of the criminal lunatic Babinsky in\
    \ disguise, first as one, emerging from a hovel, then as the other, prancing off\
    \ a pier."
