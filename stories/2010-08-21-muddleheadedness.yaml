  text: "\u201CMuddleheadedness has always been the sovereign force in human affairs\u2014\
    a force far more potent than malevolence or nobility. It lubricates our hurtful\
    \ impulses and ties our best intentions in knots. It blunts our wisdom, misdirects\
    \ our compassion, clouds whatever insights into the human condition we manage\
    \ to acquire. It is the chief artisan of the unintended consequences that constitute\
    \ human history.\u201D\nPaul R Gross & Norman Levitt, Higher Superstition\_: The\
    \ Academic Left And Its Quarrels With Science (1994)"
