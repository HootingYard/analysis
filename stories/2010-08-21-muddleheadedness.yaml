  text: '"Muddleheadedness has always been the sovereign force in human affairs--a
    force far more potent than malevolence or nobility. It lubricates our hurtful
    impulses and ties our best intentions in knots. It blunts our wisdom, misdirects
    our compassion, clouds whatever insights into the human condition we manage to
    acquire. It is the chief artisan of the unintended consequences that constitute
    human history."

    Quarrels With Science (1994)'
