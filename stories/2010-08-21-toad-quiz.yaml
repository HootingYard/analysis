  text: 'Time now for the ever-popular Hooting Yard Toad Quiz, where you can sharpen
    your wits by testing your knowledge of toads.

    Here is a photograph of a toad. Study it very carefully for five or ten minutes.
    It is, of course, a Kihansi spray toad, a tiny little dwarf amphibian just three-quarters
    of an inch long, native to Tanzania. (I am referring to the larger of the two
    toads in the picture. You can ignore for the time being the even tinier baby Kihansi
    spray toad clinging to the back of the adult.) When you think you have prolonged
    your careful study for a sufficient period of time, answer the question below
    the picture.


    Is this Kihansi spray toad (a) cheerful, (b) mordant, (c) choleric, or (d) hysterical?

    You will find the correct answer here.'
