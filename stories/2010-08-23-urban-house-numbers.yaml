  text: "\u201CStreet addressing is one of the most basic strategies employed by governmental\
    \ authorities to tax, police, manage, and monitor the spatial whereabouts of individuals\
    \ within a population.\_ Despite the central importance of the street address\
    \ as a political technology that sometimes met with resistance, few scholars have\
    \ examined the historical practice of street addressing with respect to its broader\
    \ social and political implications\u2026\_ We are particularly interested in\
    \ showcasing recent work that links the history of urban house numbering to broader\
    \ debates concerning the interrelations of space, knowledge, and power that have\
    \ animated contemporary discussions in the social sciences and humanities.\u201D\
    \nCall for papers for a special section in the journal Urban History on the history\
    \ of urban house numbering, cited in Pseuds\u2019 Corner, Private Eye, No. 1269,\
    \ 20 August\u20142 September 2010.\nIn his days as an armchair revolutionary,\
    \ Blodgett became peculiarly exercised about urban house numbering. He lived at\
    \ the time at 6 Rolf Harris Mew. Most Mews are plural, but this one wasn't. There\
    \ were nine bijou little dwellings in the Mew, and with what Blodgett identified\
    \ as a typically hegemonic capitalist patriarchal linear system of oppression\
    \ they were numbered, consecutively, from one to nine.\nBlodgett had to subject\
    \ this system to a rigorous poststructuralist interrogation before he was in a\
    \ position to subvert it, and this he did, strolling up and down the Mew making\
    \ notes, accompanied by impossibly complicated diagrams, in his jotting pad. Across\
    \ the way, crippled mendicants, brought to such a state of destitution that they\
    \ were lower even than the lowest of the lumpenproletariat, wallowed in their\
    \ own filth and wailed for crumbs. Blodgett occasionally went over to consult\
    \ with these wretches, garnering their views on his important research.\nHis first\
    \ step in defiance of an unconscionable tyranny was to upend his door number so\
    \ that it looked like a 9 rather than a 6. For this blow against the system he\
    \ was shouted at by the postie and beaten insensible with a club by the occupant\
    \ of number 9. Blodgett had, of course, expected violence as the response to his\
    \ supremely transgressive act. But, he asked himself as he lay bandaged in a clinic,\
    \ was it transgressive enough?\nWhen he was well enough to return home, he stole\
    \ out one night and, using a screwdriver, removed the door number from each house\
    \ in the Mew. He made a pyre of them and set them ablaze, using an oil-soaked\
    \ rag liberated from one of the mendicants. By the light of the fire, he took\
    \ a paint pot and daubed upon each door a slogan of resistance. For this, he was\
    \ again shouted at by the postie, and again beaten insensible by the occupant\
    \ of number 9, a person labouring under false consciousness who was joined, on\
    \ this occasion, by three or four of the neighbours.\nThis time, upon his discharge\
    \ from the clinic, Blodgett discovered that all trace of his daubings had been\
    \ erased, and brand new metal numbers affixed to the doors, except his own, which\
    \ now had nailed to it, in a clear plastic bag as protection from the incessant\
    \ rainfall, a notice from the civic authorities. Blodgett sat on the stoep to\
    \ read it. In essence, it told him that he was a fathead and an idiot.\nPoor Blodgett!\
    \ For a while it looked as if he might be homeless, and have to join the wretched\
    \ untermenschen across the way. But then he had one of his magnificent Blodgettian\
    \ brainwaves. He scampered off to the civic authorities\u2019 oppressive brutalist\
    \ headquarters and explained to an official that he was an artist. This declaration\
    \ did the trick. He was welcomed back to Rolf Harris Mew as a returning prodigal,\
    \ even by the bourgeois scum at number 9, and resumed his activities, talking\
    \ Twaddle to Power."
