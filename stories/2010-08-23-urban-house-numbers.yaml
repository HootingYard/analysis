  text: '"Street addressing is one of the most basic strategies employed by governmental
    authorities to tax, police, manage, and monitor the spatial whereabouts of individuals
    within a population.  Despite the central importance of the street address as
    a political technology that sometimes met with resistance, few scholars have examined
    the historical practice of street addressing with respect to its broader social
    and political implications...  We are particularly interested in showcasing recent
    work that links the history of urban house numbering to broader debates concerning
    the interrelations of space, knowledge, and power that have animated contemporary
    discussions in the social sciences and humanities."

    Call for papers for a special section in the journal Urban History on the history
    of urban house numbering, cited in Pseuds'' Corner, Private Eye, No. 1269, 20
    August--2 September 2010.

    In his days as an armchair revolutionary, Blodgett became peculiarly exercised
    about urban house numbering. He lived at the time at 6 Rolf Harris Mew. Most Mews
    are plural, but this one wasn''t. There were nine bijou little dwellings in the
    Mew, and with what Blodgett identified as a typically hegemonic capitalist patriarchal
    linear system of oppression they were numbered, consecutively, from one to nine.

    Blodgett had to subject this system to a rigorous poststructuralist interrogation
    before he was in a position to subvert it, and this he did, strolling up and down
    the Mew making notes, accompanied by impossibly complicated diagrams, in his jotting
    pad. Across the way, crippled mendicants, brought to such a state of destitution
    that they were lower even than the lowest of the lumpenproletariat, wallowed in
    their own filth and wailed for crumbs. Blodgett occasionally went over to consult
    with these wretches, garnering their views on his important research.

    His first step in defiance of an unconscionable tyranny was to upend his door
    number so that it looked like a 9 rather than a 6. For this blow against the system
    he was shouted at by the postie and beaten insensible with a club by the occupant
    of number 9. Blodgett had, of course, expected violence as the response to his
    supremely transgressive act. But, he asked himself as he lay bandaged in a clinic,
    was it transgressive enough?

    When he was well enough to return home, he stole out one night and, using a screwdriver,
    removed the door number from each house in the Mew. He made a pyre of them and
    set them ablaze, using an oil-soaked rag liberated from one of the mendicants.
    By the light of the fire, he took a paint pot and daubed upon each door a slogan
    of resistance. For this, he was again shouted at by the postie, and again beaten
    insensible by the occupant of number 9, a person labouring under false consciousness
    who was joined, on this occasion, by three or four of the neighbours.

    This time, upon his discharge from the clinic, Blodgett discovered that all trace
    of his daubings had been erased, and brand new metal numbers affixed to the doors,
    except his own, which now had nailed to it, in a clear plastic bag as protection
    from the incessant rainfall, a notice from the civic authorities. Blodgett sat
    on the stoep to read it. In essence, it told him that he was a fathead and an
    idiot.

    Poor Blodgett! For a while it looked as if he might be homeless, and have to join
    the wretched untermenschen across the way. But then he had one of his magnificent
    Blodgettian brainwaves. He scampered off to the civic authorities'' oppressive
    brutalist headquarters and explained to an official that he was an artist. This
    declaration did the trick. He was welcomed back to Rolf Harris Mew as a returning
    prodigal, even by the bourgeois scum at number 9, and resumed his activities,
    talking Twaddle to Power.'
