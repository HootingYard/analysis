  text: "Instruct the tinies in your charge to read carefully the passage about Thomas\
    \ Babington Macaulay's great-grandfather. Allow sufficient time so that even the\
    \ dimwits and the ones who drool will be able to complete the task. Standing imperiously\
    \ at your lectern, your arms folded in the manner of the Reverend J C M Bellew,\
    \ roar at the top of your voice the following set of questions designed to test\
    \ the tinies\u2019 comprehension. They should scrape their answers on their slates.\
    \ Model answers are given below, just in case you yourself have failed to comprehend\
    \ the passage because your brain is fuming with visions of sprites and monsters.\n\
    Q. What did the Laird take from the Minister?\nA. The Laird took from the Minister\
    \ his stipend.\nQ. In the jaws of utter destitution, what was the Minister's admirable\
    \ cast of mind?\nA. The Minister's cast of mind was valiant.\nQ. What was the\
    \ outcome for the Minister's health after some time had elapsed?\nA. After some\
    \ time had elapsed the Minister's health was much impaired.\nQ. To what feature\
    \ of the weather was the Minister exposed in all seasons?\nA. The Minister was\
    \ exposed to the violence of the weather.\nQ. We are told the Minister had no\
    \ manse. What else had he not?\nA. The Minister had not a glebe.\nQ. Name two\
    \ other things the Minister had not.\nA. The Minister had not a fund for communion\
    \ elements nor mortification for schools.\nQ. For what else might the Minister\
    \ have been able to use mortifications, had he had them?\nA. Had he had mortifications\
    \ the Minister could have used them for pious purposes.\nQ. Where would the Minister\
    \ have pursued his pious purposes?\nA. The Minister would have pursued his pious\
    \ purposes in Tiree and Coll both.\nQ. Describe the air.\nA. The air was unwholesome\
    \ and fetid and murky and rank and corrupt and mephitic and damp and vile and\
    \ foul.\nADDENDUM : I was going to suggest that in the next part of the lesson\
    \ you get the tinies to deconstruct the passage, but having read the following,\
    \ I suspect that would not be such a good idea:\n\u201CAsked to characterise the\
    \ deconstructionists he has known, an exasperated professor who specialises in\
    \ modern British literature delivered this tirade: \u2018Arrogant, smug, snotty,\
    \ meretricious, addicted to straw-man arguments, horrible writers who demand to\
    \ be of the company of Jane Austen and Chaucer, appallingly ingrown and cliquish\
    \ at the same time that they talk about expansiveness and new frontiers of discourse,\
    \ unbelievably wooden and mechanical at the same time that they make their wooden\
    \ and mechanical obeisances to jouissance and free-play, like all perpetual adolescents\
    \ contemptuous of the past and convinced that by great good fortune the truth\
    \ happened to be discovered just as they were hitting puberty, a daisy-chain of\
    \ brown-nosers declaring their high-flown independence from the normal irksome\
    \ constraints of community and continuity, who without the peculiar heads-I-win-tails-you-lose\
    \ rationale of their arguments\u2014if evidence and logic bear me out, fine, if\
    \ not, we can always deconstruct them\u2014would almost none of them have written\
    \ an essay that could stand up in a decent senior seminar.'\u201D\nQuoted in David\
    \ Lehamn, Signs Of The Times\_: Deconstruction And The Fall Of Paul De Man (1991).\
    \ Sadly, Lehman does not\_ reveal the identity of this prize ranter."
