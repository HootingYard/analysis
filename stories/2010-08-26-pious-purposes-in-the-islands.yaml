  text: "\u201CIn the beginning of the eighteenth century the great-grandfather of\
    \ the famous Lord Macaulay, the author of the glowing and impassioned History\
    \ of England, was minister of Tiree and Coll, when his stipend was taken from\
    \ him at the instance of the Laird of Ardchattan. The slight inconvenience of\
    \ having nothing to live upon did not seem to incline the old minister in the\
    \ least degree to resign his charge and to seek a flock who could feed their shepherd.\
    \ He stayed valiantly on, doing his duty faithfully by his humble people. But\
    \ after some time had elapsed, \u2018his health being much impaired, and there\
    \ being no church or meeting-house, he was exposed to the violence of the weather\
    \ at all seasons; and having no manse or glebe, and no fund for communion elements,\
    \ and having no mortification for schools or other pious purposes in either of\
    \ the islands, and the air being unwholesome,\u2019\u2014he was finally compelled\
    \ to leave, much to his own regret and that of his poor little flock.\u201D\n\
