  text: "\nThis week in my cupboard at The Dabbler, a bit of blatant puffery for the\
    \ recording I made\u2014with Germander Speedwell\u2014of Christopher Smart's bonkers\
    \ epic Jubilate Agno. I am well aware that Hooting Yard readers have learned the\
    \ habit of listening to it daily, setting aside the three hours necessary to do\
    \ so. Now you will, I hope, be joined by the extended readership of The Dabbler."
