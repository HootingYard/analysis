    This week in my cupboard at The Dabbler, a bit of blatant puffery for the recording
    I made--with Germander Speedwell--of Christopher Smart''s bonkers epic Jubilate
    Agno. I am well aware that Hooting Yard readers have learned the habit of listening
    to it daily, setting aside the three hours necessary to do so. Now you will, I
    hope, be joined by the extended readership of The Dabbler.'
