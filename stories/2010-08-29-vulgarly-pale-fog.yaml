  text: '"The blanching or bleaching of the London fogs, by the improved methods of
    consuming smoke, must be a very fine thing for the dwellers in that overgrown
    city. We hear, however, of one old lady, a duchess, who thinks the fog now to
    be very vulgarly pale; and regrets the good old days of what she thought a much
    more picturesque gloom."
