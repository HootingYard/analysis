  text: "\u201CThe blanching or bleaching of the London fogs, by the improved methods\
    \ of consuming smoke, must be a very fine thing for the dwellers in that overgrown\
    \ city. We hear, however, of one old lady, a duchess, who thinks the fog now to\
    \ be very vulgarly pale; and regrets the good old days of what she thought a much\
    \ more picturesque gloom.\u201D\nHenry Hartshorne, 1931\_: A Glance At The Twentieth\
    \ Century (1881)"
