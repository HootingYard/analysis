  text: 'Another thing I found when fossicking in that cupboard was a scrap of paper
    on which was scribbled the following:

    11 Petiver, Buddle & Doody. 48 Withering. 53 Rousseau''s wife. 56 Huttonian theory.
    63/64 Buckland. 76 Robert Dick--biscuit. 77/78 McGillivray''s journey. 80 Philip
    Gosse diary entry. 82 Buckland concealed hammer on the Sabbath. 129 Discovery
    of plankton.

    Deploying my Holmesian deductive skills, I worked out that these were notes I
    had made, long ago, when reading The Naturalist In Britain : A Social History
    by David Elliston Allen (1976). Seeking enlightenment, I located the volume on
    the teetering bookshelves, and turned to the relevant pages. In some cases, it
    is no longer clear to me what sparked my interest. Others, however, I was extremely
    pleased to be reminded of. Here are the relevant quotes:

    "Rousseau''s extreme short-sight was such that at the best of times he saw the
    landscape as a blur, while his wife, in similar fashion, never knew which day
    of the week it was and never even learned to tell the time."

    "In many ways [Buckland] was undeniably a very curious person: an oddly truncated
    man... He sported childish jests and puns, devised peculiar contraptions, went
    in for the weirdest kinds of food... It was typical of him that he drove round
    in a special kind of carriage, strengthened in an ostentatious manner... he carried
    around a mysterious blue bag... he led his students on excursions into the field
    wearing quite incongruously formal clothes."

    "Robert Dick... ''the Botanist of Thurso'' made it his regular practice to walk
    all day, for up to forty miles, with one ship''s biscuit as his only sustenance."

    "Philip Henry Gosse became so lost in his work that he registered the birth of
    his only child with the remarkable entry in his diary: ''Received green swallow
    from Jamaica. E delivered of a son.''"'
