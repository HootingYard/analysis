  text: 'August has been exceedingly fecund here at Hooting Yard, with more postages
    in a single month than at any time since the site reared its gorgeous head almost
    seven years ago. However, I now wish to alert readers to the possibility that
    things may quieten down for a week or so, the reason being that a critical stage
    has been reached in the production of this year''s Lulu paperback. Yes!, fear
    not, fairly soon now your Christmas-present-purchasing-befuddlement will be washed
    away, like the blood of the lamb, with the publication of another fat (350 pages
    or thereabouts) anthology of mighty lopsided prose, direct from Mr Key''s pea-sized
    yet pulsating brain to the printed page!

    The mind-numbing business of bashing the book together is at an advanced stage,
    formatting the text and proofreadnig and reformatting the text, etcetera etcetera
    ad nauseam.. This ought to be a simple matter, but as the ever-reliable Mr Fadhley,
    who directs the operation, points out, the programme used to create the book "was
    designed by nerds for nerds and is monstrously complex". Think of that when, eventually,
    you clutch the treasured tome in your dainty little hands, as tiny as Scriabin''s,
    if that is an approximate description of your hands, though I realise it may not
    be. You may have huge hairy paws. It matters not.

    So for the next few days at least I will be trying to tackle the remaining monstrous
    complexities. Should anything momentous bubble up in my cranium I shall try to
    post it here, but I thought it worth alerting you that things may quieten down
    just a tad.

    Meanwhile, you might want to make a day trip to Beccles.'
