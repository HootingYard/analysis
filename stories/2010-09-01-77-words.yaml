  text: 'The history of Britain, 1939-2010, in seventy-seven words:

    "The British soul was at its zenith when everyone had clipped accents and sex
    was furtive and all men wore hats and leapt onto steam locomotives as they pulled
    out of the station (before alighting at Boxhill and Westhumble) and thin-moustached
    officers in tropical outposts sweated gin-and-tonic and quoted Latin proverbs;
    and everything that''s happened since, from the welfare state to The X Factor
    to the Guardian website, has been unmistakeably symptomatic of our purposeless
    spiritual decline."

    Thus Brit, over at The Dabbler.'
