  text: "The history of Britain, 1939\u20132010, in seventy-seven words:\n\u201CThe\
    \ British soul was at its zenith when everyone had clipped accents and sex was\
    \ furtive and all men wore hats and leapt onto steam locomotives as they pulled\
    \ out of the station (before\_alighting at Boxhill and Westhumble) and thin-moustached\
    \ officers in\_tropical outposts sweated gin-and-tonic and quoted Latin proverbs;\
    \ and everything that's happened since, from the welfare state to\_The X Factor\
    \ to the Guardian website, has been unmistakeably symptomatic of our purposeless\
    \ spiritual decline.\u201D\nThus Brit, over at The Dabbler."
