  text: '"[Bishop Hall] sobs me out half a dozen phthisical mottoes wherever he had
    them, hopping short in the measure of convulsion-fits; in which labour the agony
    of his wit having escaped narrowly, instead of well-sized periods, he greets us
    with a quantity of thumb-ring posies. ''He has a fortune therefore good, because
    he is content with it.'' This is a piece of sapience not worth the brain of a
    fruit trencher"
