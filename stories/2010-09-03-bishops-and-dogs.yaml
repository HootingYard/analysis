  text: 'It has come to my attention that a bishop, when dying, is compelled by law
    to bequeath his pack of dogs to the reigning monarch, for the sovereign''s free
    use and disposal.

    Perhaps there is a legal expert among my readers who could confirm whether or
    no this sensible measure remains on the statute book. And if it does, I would
    be interested to know if it is possible to pursue, beyond the grave, any bishop
    who, before his last gasp, broke the law by not so bequeathing his pack of dogs.
    It seems to me that a prelate who sinned by breaking the law, even in his last
    extremity, ought to be pitched from his heavenly perch into the maw of hell.'
