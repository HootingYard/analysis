  text: "\nThis week at The Dabbler my cupboard features the well-loved Hooting Yard\
    \ Pontiff Mnemonic. When declaimed aloud it is always a crowd-pleaser, so I should\
    \ take this opportunity to remind readers that, for an appropriate fee, I will\
    \ be happy to come and shout it aloud at your community social cohesion hub or\
    \ neighbourhood frolic \u2018n\u2019 learning zone. I was hoping I might get an\
    \ invitation to boom it out at one of the official events during the imminent\
    \ Papal visit, but as yet no Vatican nuncio has beaten a path to my door, alas.\n\
    ADDENDUM\_: In the comments at The Dabbler, Barendina Smedley asks \u201CSo, who's\
    \ going to set this as plainsong?\u201D and imagines it being chanted lugubriously.\
    \ Perhaps a musically inclined reader might wish to take up her suggestion\u2026"
