  text: '"In Queen Eliz: time, Gravitie and state was kept upp. In King James time
    things were pretty well. But in K. Charles time there has binn nothing but Trenchmore
    & the Cushion dance, Omnium gatherum, tolly polly, hoyte come toyte."

    The Table-Talk Of John Selden (1689)

    Apropos Brit''s history of Britain 1939-2010 in seventy-seven words, clearly things
    have been going to pot for a long, long time. Tolly polly and hoyte come toyte
    indeed! What fresh hell will yet assail us?

    ADDENDUM : In 1652, John Evelyn complained of "the depraved youth of England,
    whose prodigious disbaucheries and late unheard of extravagancies far surpasse
    the madnesse of all other civilized Nations whatsoever".'
