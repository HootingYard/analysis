  text: '"I would my father had made me a Hangman, when he made me a Stationer; for
    we are call''d to Accompt for Other Men''s Works, as well as for our Own. And
    one thing that''s cast in our Dish, is the selling of Translations, so Dog-Cheap,
    that every Sot knows now as much as would formerly have made a Passable Doctor,
    and every Nasty Groom, and Roguy Lacquay is grown as familiar with Homer, Virgil,
    Ovid, as if ''twere Robin the Devil; The Seven Champions; or a piece of George
    Withers.

    "He would have talkt on, if a Devil had not stopt his Mouth with a Whiffe from
    a rowle of his own Papers, and Choak''t him with the smoak on''t. The Pestilent
    Fume would have dispatch''t me too, if I had not got presently out of the reach
    on''t. But I went on my way, saying, this to myself; If the Book-seller be thus
    Criminal, what will become of the Author!"
