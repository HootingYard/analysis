  text: 'It is monumentally curious, is it not, that fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol
    won renown in sports which are not, themselves, remotely fictional? Polevaulting
    and haring round and round a running track are both activities in which plenty
    of non-fictional athletes have taken part, in the past as in the present day.
    Now, the release of previously repressed passages from the Memoirs of Bobnit Tivol''s
    coach and mentor, the catarrh-wracked, Homburg-wearing Old Halob, show how sporting
    history might have taken a different path.

    Unlike his protege, Old Halob was of course all too terrifyingly real, yet he
    harboured a deep love for fictitious sports. While Bobnit Tivol was scampering
    round and round those cinder running tracks following his punishing training regime,
    Old Halob, we now learn, was dreaming of pitting his champion against Markus Geissler,
    the big Austrian, in a Guyball match. It remained a dream, for all the cantankerous
    trainer''s attempts to enrol the fictional athlete in a Guyball team came to naught
    through a series of mishaps. Telegrams went astray, railway timetables proved
    to be forgeries, buses crashed, the addresses on envelopes were smudged to illegibility
    by rainfall... those sorts of mishap dogged Old Halob.

    Later in the same year, he was in secret talks with John Tetrad and Max Quad in
    an attempt to have Bobnit Tivol join their fennel team. In this case, it seems
    negotiations were far advanced, and only fell apart when nobody could find a fictional
    pen with which the fictional athlete could sign on the fictional dotted line of
    a fictional contract. This prompted the strange, almost hallucinatory passage
    in the repressed Memoirs where Old Halob blathers on for page after page bemoaning
    the non-existence of a well-stocked fictional stationery shop.

    Take it from me, the Repressed Memoirs Of Old Halob is suitable reading for repressed
    sport enthusiasts of any stripe.'
