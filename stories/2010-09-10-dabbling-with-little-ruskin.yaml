    This week at The Dabbler I recommend the setting up of a free school with a curriculum
    devoted to the works of John Ruskin, and include two Tales Of Little Ruskin suitable
    for reading aloud to tinies. Incidentally, I could not help noticing the manner
    in which the Grauniad reported the official approval given to the setting up of
    sixteen such free schools. One idealistic teacher suggested that among the things
    deemed important in his planned school, in a deprived area, would be good manners
    and the basic civilised matter of sitting down together at mealtimes. The privately-educated
    well-brought-up Grauniad staff take these things for granted, of course, but the
    very idea that they should be inculcated in the lower orders is anathema. The
    front page headline sneerily misrepresented the plans as teaching "etiquette and
    fine dining".'
