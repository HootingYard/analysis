  text: 'The drudgery of proofreadnig (second tranche) is done, I am pleased to say,
    and pending a few final formatty fiddlesticks and decisions about the cover design,
    the next Hooting Yard Lulu paperback will be ready--after, I suppose, groaning,
    a further proofread, just to be on the safe side.

    I have to say that a prolonged bout of reading and rereading and rerereading my
    own stuff, in concentrated form, is scarcely conducive to writing new-minted blather.
    That is why Hooting Yard has gone a bit quiet over the last couple of weeks. I
    pause before tippy-tapping on a new blank screen. Blah blah Dobson blah blah Blodgett
    blah blah cows blah blah... there is an awful sense of futility. I know it will
    pass, and I know too that I constantly need new material to prate on the radio
    once a week, so all will be well.

    Meanwhile, instead of all the usual nonsense (ie, Dobson and Blodgett and cows
    etc.) it occurred to me that I needed some kind of fresh challenge. My eyes alit
    on this, snipped from the cover of some 1950s pulp magazine:


    Could I write a novel of intrigue in the void? Isn''t the point of a void that
    it is empty, vacant, that there is nothing whatsoever in it? That''s why it''s
    a void! What sort of intrigue takes place in a void? As soon as you put something
    into it, to create or prompt an intrigue, surely it is no longer a void?

    These are mighty questions, and perplexing ones, but I do not think a mere list
    of questions, however lengthy, would deserve to be called a novel. Or would it?
    Might the questions themselves form the intrigue unravelling in the void? Or is
    that a circular self-referential knot of twaddle, much like this postage itself?

    These are less mighty questions, yet just as perplexing, are they not? So perplexing
    that I am all a-dither. I think I''ll have a cup of tea, and then go for a walk,
    and then sit and dribble into a pewter pot, gazing at the stars, up there in what
    would be a void if it were not for the very stars with which it is riddled.'
