  text: 'David McKie, who is always worth reading, had a piece in the Grauniad last
    week about the first lines of novels. He refers to a reference work I had never
    heard of, Novel Openers : First Sentences of 11,000 Fictional Works, Topically
    Arranged with Subject, Keyword, Author and Title Indexing compiled by Bruce L
    Weaver and published in 1995. No doubt one could spend many happy hours browsing
    through it seeking out one''s own favourites, cursing the absence of others, and
    making new discoveries. It set me to thinking, by the by, that such compilations,
    whether fat like Weaver''s or brief and idiosyncratic like any number found in
    books and magazines and online, seem invariably to focus on fiction. What about
    arresting openings of non-fiction works? How about this, from Sword Of Wisdom
    : MacGregor Mathers And ''The Golden Dawn'' by Ithell Colquhoun (1975):

    I was a schoolgirl sitting on a lavatory-seat and leaning forward so as to see
    into the depths of an osier basket lined with newspapers. The closely-printed
    pages carried an article by a young woman visiting an Abbey in Sicily and described
    the strange goings-on there. The director of the place was someone whom she called
    ''The Mystic'' but did not otherwise identify: and his Abbey was far from being
    an ordinary monastic establishment. I stayed put until I had read through the
    two or three large pages, in spite of imperious rattling at the door.

    That certainly did what McKie says Bruce L Weaver suggests is "the best way to
    capture readers"--it instantly put me somewhere else and piqued my curiosity.
    A page or so later I was introduced to an amusingly intriguing cast of characters:

    I began to pick up dark hints about the activities of certain (unspecified) members,
    of whom others were suspicious. The rumours centred around a third studio, situated
    beyond the one used as a library, and their chief disseminator was the librarian,
    a Miss Worthington... The members were not all of Miss Worthington''s calibre,
    however; they included Dr Moses Gaster, the eminent Hebraist, whose youngest daughter
    was my contemporary at the Slade; Hugh Schonfield, whose scholarly preoccupations
    did not prevent his founding later The Mondcivitan Republic; Dr W B Crow, Grand
    Master of the Order of the Holy Wisdom and author and lecturer on Traditional
    themes; Margaret L Woods, the Edwardian poet; Gerard Heym, the scholar and bibliophile,
    and Edward Langford Garstin who was  secretary of the Society, his Alchemical
    treatises, Theurgy and The Secret Fire, not yet published.

    This is a peculiarly British, or English, shabby-genteel world of the interwar
    years, suburban mystics scraping by on invisible means, their secret wisdom unsuspected
    by their neighbours, and often unintelligible even to their disciples. Later,
    Ithell Colquhoun is invited to a weekend in the country:

    The basic formula for such establishments is a simple one: get hold of a large
    house and garden, also a biddable and industrious wife and/or a selection of concubines
    with similar qualities; then collect disciples of both sexes willing not only
    to pay for their keep but to work for it. (You recommend work in house and garden
    for its therapeutic value, but it also saves you the expense of employing staff.)
    The formula was used successfully for a number of years early this century by
    ''Monsieur Gurdjieff'' at Fontainebleau; by Crowley (more briefly) at his Abbey
    of Thelema, Cefalu, in the early Nineteen-Twenties, and by P D Ouspensky in the
    ''Thirties, when he occupied at least two different properties in the Home Counties.
    To expand the cynical remark that ''behind every Western teacher is a boarding-house
    or a brothel'', I would put Meredith [Starr] and Ouspensky into the first category;
    but if the reports of inmates are exact, there were at least elements of the second
    chez MM Gurdjieff and Crowley.

    She arrives at Frogmore on a chilly November day, met at the nearest station by
    her host in a "battered car".

    Frogmore proved to be a red-brick gabled house set on sloping ground; the atmosphere
    of the demesne at once struck me as gloomy, the interior no less so. The dining-hall
    was sombrely pannelled and almost without illumination; we all sat at a long table
    with Meredith at the head. The diet, strictly food-reform, was far from being
    the delicious fare vegetarian food can and should be; I remember a tasteless soup
    with something like barley-kernels in suspension, also whole cooked cabbage-leaves
    like dark linoleum. Why these could not have been chopped up, seasoned, and served
    with an appetising sauce I don''t know : perhaps that would have destroyed their
    virtue?

    Writing in the 1970s--or, as she would put it, the Nineteen-Seventies--Ithell
    Colquhoun looks back and sees parallels with the present:

    My room was cold, cramped and shabby : when later I described it to Margot, ''Very
    simple'', she murmured with a far-away look. But is it simple when all water has
    to be carried, the lavatory is a long way down a spooky corridor, and the only
    warmth comes from hot bottles? Is an earth-closet in the garden that has to be
    emptied periodically really simpler than main drainage? Or rather, does not the
    absence of mod. cons. make for less simple household-running than if things were
    arranged with a little common sense? I suspect that to-day some hippie-girls,
    after enthusiastically integrating themselves with a commune, learn this same
    fact the hard way. Life may be simple for their men if these do little but discuss
    what they call philosophy, but how about the women? To keep even relatively warm,
    clean, and fed in primitive conditions is more difficult than in ''squarer'' surroundings.
    (Incidentally, how far out-dated is much hippie ideology when it comes to considering
    women as human beings! Or failing to consider them at all.)

    Forty years on from this spot-on observation of hippies, she still skewers, in
    a few simple sentences, the inanities of those of our twenty-first century eco-warriors
    who would like nothing better than to plunge us into a pre-industrial dark age.

    I realise I have quoted on far beyond that startling opening paragraph, but doing
    so proves the point I suppose. Read it, and you''re hooked. I am fifty pages in,
    and am looking forward to the rest of the book with immense glee.'
