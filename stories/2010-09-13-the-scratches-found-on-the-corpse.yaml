  text: 'A paragraph that leaves you wanting to know more...

    "[An] episode is highlighted in Ritual Magic In England (1970) by Francis King
    who, misled by Dion Fortune''s account of it, accused Moina [Mathers] of killing
    a Miss Netta Fornario by black magic. As the incidents leading to Miss Fornario''s
    death did not take place until some eighteen months after Moina''s own, the charge
    is scarcely worth refuting. Even if the latter had been living, the scratches
    found on the corpse are less likely to have resulted from an attack by Moina in
    the form of a monster cat, than from running naked in the dark over rough country,
    which Miss Fornario had done immediately before her collapse."
