  text: "A paragraph that leaves you wanting to know more\u2026\n\u201C[An] episode\
    \ is highlighted in Ritual Magic In England (1970) by Francis King who, misled\
    \ by Dion Fortune's account of it, accused Mo\xEFna [Mathers] of killing a Miss\
    \ Netta Fornario by black magic. As the incidents leading to Miss Fornario's death\
    \ did not take place until some eighteen months after Mo\xEFna's own, the charge\
    \ is scarcely worth refuting. Even if the latter had been living, the scratches\
    \ found on the corpse are less likely to have resulted from an attack by Mo\xEF\
    na in the form of a monster cat, than from running naked in the dark over rough\
    \ country, which Miss Fornario had done immediately before her collapse.\u201D\
