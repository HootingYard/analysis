  text: Carry me down from the hills. They are horrible hills. Carry me down from
    the horrible hills in a palanquin. Do not shake me as you carry me. I am already
    shuddering from the horror of the hills. Tread carefully. There is no path. There
    is no path nor beaten track down from the hills. There are innumerable puddles.
    Carry me, carry me, in my palanquin. I languish in my palanquin, like a symbolist
    aesthete. But my moustache is unwaxed and flecked with spittle. I did much spitting
    in the horrible hills. I spat and spat. Bile in the gorge. Maw all jitters. I
    shall not spit in my palanquin. Carry me down from the hills. In the puddles live
    many bugs and beetles. They attach themselves to your ankles and bite you, you
    my carriers. They cannot bite me, for I am beyond their reach in my palanquin.
    Its draperies are tattered and torn. But I am clued up. Yes, I am all clued up
    and wise to tricks and box-hot. Carry me, carry me down with all due haste, for
    we must reach the plain before midnight strikes. I have a fob watch to tell the
    time, and I am checking, checking, checking the time each quarter-minute. When
    midnight strikes, the twentieth century begins. O carry me!
