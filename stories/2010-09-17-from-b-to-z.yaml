  text: 'A thought has occurred to me--possibly a rather foolish one, but then, many
    of my thoughts are foolish, as I have no doubt are many if not most of yours,
    dear readers. The previous postage, because it took for its subject the thirteen
    Bierce siblings, all of whose names began with A, I chose to entitle ''A''. Once
    posted, I noted the elegant simplicity of it upon the screen, in contrast to all
    those postage titles formed of whole words and phrases, some of which, distressingly,
    fail to fit neatly on to a single line. This is when the foolish thought bubbled
    up in my brain. Mayhap, I thought, I should entitle the next twenty-five postages
    alphabetically, from B to Z. Their subject matter would, of course, be constrained
    by the letter of their title. Thus I would be following an Oulipian procedure
    for a couple of weeks at least.

    Whether or not this thought becomes a plan and then an actuality, well, who can
    say?

    File under vague, ill-thought, pointless twaddle.'
