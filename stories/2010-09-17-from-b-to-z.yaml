  text: "A thought has occurred to me\u2014possibly a rather foolish one, but then,\
    \ many of my thoughts are foolish, as I have no doubt are many if not most of\
    \ yours, dear readers. The previous postage, because it took for its subject the\
    \ thirteen Bierce siblings, all of whose names began with A, I chose to entitle\
    \ \u2018A\u2019. Once posted, I noted the elegant simplicity of it upon the screen,\
    \ in contrast to all those postage titles formed of whole words and phrases, some\
    \ of which, distressingly, fail to fit neatly on to a single line. This is when\
    \ the foolish thought bubbled up in my brain. Mayhap, I thought, I should entitle\
    \ the next twenty-five postages alphabetically, from B to Z. Their subject matter\
    \ would, of course, be constrained by the letter of their title. Thus I would\
    \ be following an Oulipian procedure for a couple of weeks at least.\nWhether\
    \ or not this thought becomes a plan and then an actuality, well, who can say?\n\
    File under vague, ill-thought, pointless twaddle."
