  text: "Our alphabet continues with C for canker worm.\nSorely perplexed was I, that\
    \ I was waking each morning, and had been for months on end, engulfed in a miasma\
    \ of unutterable spiritual desolation. I sought advice from a quack I encountered\
    \ on a charabanc outing. He was sitting in the seat next to mine, all wrapped\
    \ up in a visible aura of wisdom, a sort of pinkish violet haze, and his one good\
    \ eye seemed, to me, to emit a ray, a ray that could pierce my spiritual innards\
    \ were he but to train it upon me. I tapped him on the shoulder, so he would turn\
    \ to face me.\n\u201CYou look like the kind of fellow who might be able to diagnose\
    \ the miasma of spiritual desolation within which I tremble, engulfed,\u201D I\
    \ said, not beating about the bush.\n\u201CI am that man,\u201D he replied, and\
    \ about thirty seconds later he added \u201CYou have a canker worm nestling within\
    \ the very core of your soul, and it is gnawing away at your spiritual vitals.\u201D\
    \n\u201CI knew I could rely on you,\u201D I said, possibly a bit too loudly, for\
    \ elsewhere in the charabanc heads turned and craned to look. I slipped some coinage\
    \ into the quack's outstretched palm, settled back in my seat, and shut my eyes.\
    \ Soon enough we reached the destination of our outing, a ruined fortification\
    \ of great antiquity and becrumblement, lashed by wind and rain. Tugging my windcheater\
    \ close about my puny frame, I fairly skipped out of the charabanc into the mud,\
    \ animated by a sense that, having discovered the cause of my unutterable spiritual\
    \ desolation, I could now do something about it.\nBut what was I to do? The canker\
    \ worm was nestled in my soul, and we still do not know whereabouts within us\
    \ the soul resides. Indeed, there is a growing body of opinion that we do not\
    \ have souls at all, that the whole idea is a phantasy, or a metaphor, or just\
    \ blithering nonsense. Well, I laugh in the face of those who deny the soul's\
    \ existence! I may not know precisely where mine is, in brain or heart or spleen\
    \ or kidney, but I know that it is about the size and shape and colour of a plum\
    \ tomato. I was told as much by a Magus at a seaside resort, long, long ago.\n\
    Traipsing round the ruin, and then on the charabanc journey back\u2014during which\
    \ there was no sign of the quack, his seat next to mine having been taken by a\
    \ television chat show host to whom I could not quite put a name, and dare not\
    \ ask, for he was frowning mightily\u2014I mentally chewed over what I might do\
    \ about my canker worm. Was there some substance or formula I could ingest that\
    \ would do me no harm but would blast the little canker worm to perdition? Some\
    \ potion or preparation, of milk and aniseed and potable gold? Or could I somehow\
    \ excise it with a pair of ethereal pliers? That might put me at risk of irreversible\
    \ psychic injury, of course, but was it a price worth paying?\nI juggled these\
    \ and other thoughts until my brain overheated, at which point I went to bed,\
    \ for it was by now late and dark. While I slept, I had a dream, like Dr King,\
    \ and when I awoke, I wanted to go and stand on a podium, like Dr King, and declaim\
    \ the contents of my dream to the gathered masses, declaim it in powerful preacherman\
    \ language. It took me a few seconds to realise that I had not the magnetic charisma\
    \ of Dr King to attract the teeming thousands to hear me. The next thought that\
    \ popped in to my head was to wonder precisely when \u201CDr King\u201D became\
    \ the preferred way of referring to the Reverend Martin Luther King, and if this\
    \ had happened at the same time as it became obligatory for all United States\
    \ Presidential candidates so to mention \u201CDr King\u201D in at least one campaign\
    \ speech, to garner guaranteed applause. Seconds later, the next, and most important\
    \ thought, occurred to me. For the first time in months, I had woken up without\
    \ feeling engulfed in a miasma of unutterable spiritual desolation! Quite the\
    \ contrary. I was filled with vim and gush and pep. I was ready for a large eggy\
    \ breakfast, and nothing was going to stop me.\nTucking in to my eggs, prepared\
    \ in accordance with the Bl\xF6tzmann system (see the appendix to the third handbook\
    \ in the Lavender Series), I tried to remember my dream, as clearly it provided\
    \ the clue to my new-found mental and spiritual wellbeing. But I could remember\
    \ nothing, so after a post-breakfast hike along paths and lanes and canal towpaths,\
    \ and through a municipal park, I took from its cubby my hat-sized metal cone,\
    \ plopped it atop my head, aligned my head at the correct angle (see the instructions\
    \ in Bl\xF6tzmann's seventh handbook, Lilac Series) and stared into space, mouth\
    \ hanging open, dribbling.\nGosh! It soon became apparent that, in the mists of\
    \ sleep, I had visualised my little canker worm, gnawing its way through my plum\
    \ tomato-shaped soul, and instead of seeing it as an invader to be repulsed or\
    \ expunged, I had cosseted it as a pet. I named it Dagobert, and furnished it\
    \ with a hutch, and pampered it, and took it for walks, insofar as a worm can\
    \ walk, attached to a lead. The lead was made of ectoplasmic string from a spirit-viola.\n\
    The question now was whether I was able to apply these methods to my real, albeit\
    \ invisible and intangible, spiritual canker worm. Perhaps, if I kept the metal\
    \ cone on my head beyond the recommended time-limit, thus risking weird head judderings,\
    \ paralysis, and death, I might be granted the powers to construct Dagobert's\
    \ little hutch. After all, I reasoned\u2014ha, reason!\u2014if he was snug in\
    \ his hutch he would desist from his gnawing, wouldn't he? I was certain, though\
    \ on what grounds I knew not, that my plum tomato soul could regenerate sufficiently\
    \ to repair all the damage caused by the gnawing. But where would I take my little\
    \ canker worm on its necessary walks? Under the metal cone, my head grew hot and\
    \ frazzled, and I fell into a swoon\u2026\nThe following week, I once again boarded\
    \ the charabanc for an outing, this time to a den of iniquity preserved in quicklime.\
    \ I sat down next to a different quack, one whose visible aura was purple and\
    \ golden, and whose spirit-piercing ray projected, not from his eye, but from\
    \ a star in the centre of his forehead.\n\u201CExcuse me,\u201D I said, \u201C\
    But you look like the kind of fellow who might be able to see into my soul and\
    \ tell me if it is being gnawed at by a little canker worm named Dagobert.\u201D\
    \n\u201CI am that man!\u201D he roared in reply, and aimed his ray at me. I waited\
    \ for him to report his findings. As I waited, the driver lost control of the\
    \ charabanc and we veered scree scraw off the road and plunged into a ditch. The\
    \ ditch was riddled with puddles, and each puddle was rife with worms, and some\
    \ of them were canker worms, and they were legion, and uncountable. But somehow,\
    \ I could count them, and I did, and I learned that as we flailed, panting and\
    \ stricken, in the ditch, their number had increased by one. Little Dagobert had\
    \ gone to join his fellows in their cankerous ditch-puddle of doom, and I was\
    \ free!"
