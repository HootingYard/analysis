    Mr Key is very pleased to announce that he will be reading a couple of (short)
    stories as part of a night of live radio art presented by the Resonance Radio
    Orchestra at the Jellyfish Theatre on Sunday the third of October. Tickets are
    just PS5, and doors open at 7.30 PM.

    The Jellyfish Theate is a temporary structure built of pallets and discarded doors
    and old nails. You can read about it here and find out where it is here.
