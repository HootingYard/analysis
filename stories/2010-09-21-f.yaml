  text: 'Flares. That''s right, flares. And not just any old flares, but solar flares,
    up in the heavens, immense and dazzling. Solar flares due to create a space storm
    that could incapacitate the infrastructure of civilisation on earth. Or, as The
    Sun puts it, excitingly, "could turn the sky red, wipe internet and paralyse Earth".

    These world-shuddering solar flares were an item on last night''s Channel Four
    News. In spite of the fact that these huge explosions of energy from the sun which
    could crash electricity grids and paralyse the earth are due to occur in just
    three years'' time, the story was not the main headline. Nor even the second or
    third. In fact, it came at the tail-end of the bulletin, the place one might expect
    to be told about a skateboarding duck or a pancake bearing the face of Christ.

    Has it come to this? The destruction of civilisation is considered to be of lesser
    account than Nick Clegg? Yes, yes, we know Clegg smokes and idolises Samuel Beckett
    and weeps when he listens to the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss, but remember,
    too, that Chris Mullin, a man of (I think) some integrity, who still watches television
    in black-and-white, describes him as "easily the biggest charlatan of the lot".

    The terrifying thing is that, if two-thirds of the skies will indeed be smothered
    in a blood-red aurora, what will become of Hooting Yard? Let''s get our priorities
    right. The Lib Dem party conference may be of interest to smoking Beckettian Straussist
    charlatans and their hangers-on, but any sane person would be preparing themselves
    for a hideous new dispensation of pre-industrial scavenging, untold savagery,
    and silence like unto death itself falling upon Dobson and Blodgett and Tiny Enid
    and Pebblehead and all your Hooting Yard favourites. Surely even Krishnan Guru-Murthy
    can grasp the horrifying implications.

    There is a crumb of comfort, I suppose, in the likelihood that we will reach the
    end of our alphabetic postage series long before 2013.'
