  text: "G is for Mrs Gubbins, obviously\n\u201CBathsheba Gubbins! You have been found\
    \ guilty of a raggle-taggle salmagundi of crimes, some so heinous that they beggar\
    \ belief and make strong men break down into convulsive weeping. Now, by dint\
    \ of the awful and arbitrary power invested in me, do not ask when or by whom,\
    \ I pronounce sentence. Mrs Gubbins, you shall be taken from this place, by horse\
    \ and cart, during a rainstorm, and deposited none too kindly in a chamber within\
    \ the sort of institution appropriate to a crone of your advancing years, and\
    \ there you will remain, and there you will knit. You will knit and knit and knit\
    \ forevermore, without cease. When cities burn and the planet crumbles and the\
    \ sun is extinguished, still you shall knit, Bathsheba Gubbins! You shall knit\
    \ tea-cosies and scarves and miscellaneous woolies, and at the very instant they\
    \ are completed, they shall unravel and you will knit them again from scratch.\
    \ From dawn until dusk and through the cold dark horrors of the night, you shall\
    \ knit much like Sisyphus hopelessly pushing his boulder uphill. As he gaped to\
    \ watch it roll down to the bottom of that hill, so shall you see your knitting\
    \ unravel until all you have to show for your toil is a tangled skein of wool,\
    \ wool you must knit again and again into a tea cosy or a scarf or a wooly. The\
    \ only sound in your chamber shall be the interminable clack clack of your knitting\
    \ needles. Knit, La Gubbins, knit! From now until the end of time, and beyond,\
    \ clack clack clack! Take her down.\u201D\nCrikey! What a revelation! Until now,\
    \ it has been beyond the most acute of wits to grasp why on earth the criminally-minded\
    \ octogenarian crone never ever ceases to knit. Veteran of innumerable armed robberies\
    \ and mystic badger abductions, La Gubbins sits clacking away, occasionally dribbling,\
    \ staring into the middle distance, seemingly happy in her toil. Only the chance\
    \ discovery of this dictabelt recording, in a cardboard box underneath a sink\
    \ in an outhouse in the grounds of a mysterious country pile situated behind enormous\
    \ wrought iron gates partly hidden at a bend in a bosky lane lined by titanic\
    \ cedars and larches along which brightly coloured sports cars driven at reckless\
    \ speed by raffish chaps wearing cravats and goggles zoom past, has revealed the\
    \ truth of the matter. The matter being that endless knitting, which at last we\
    \ can understand as Sisyphean.\nWhere and when the dictabelt recording was made\
    \ is unclear. It is fanciful to suggest, as Van Spurtbosch does in his recently-published\
    \ monograph, that it came from the same cache that yielded the dictabelt recording\
    \ from the police motorcycle of Officer H B McLain whose radio microphone was\
    \ accidentally stuck in the open position as he accompanied the presidential motorcade\
    \ along Dealey Plaza in Dallas on the twenty-second of November 1963 and thus\
    \ picked up sounds and \u201Cimpulse patterns\u201D which were to become germane\
    \ to the inquiry regarding the identity of the assassin or assassins of President\
    \ John Fitzgerald Kennedy on that day, and in that place. Waters were muddied\
    \ in that case by Officer McLain later suggesting his dictabelt was not the source\
    \ of the recordings, but rather that of one of his colleagues. Equally fanciful\
    \ is Van Spurtbosch's wild claim that John McClane, the character played by Bruce\
    \ Willis in the Die Hard tetralogy, was based on the Dallas police motorcyclist.\
    \ One need only compare the spellings of the names to see it ain't so. Had Van\
    \ Spurtbosch done his homework, much grief, much much grief, indeed as much grief\
    \ as there is Gubbinsy knitting, could have been spared.\nGrief, like Gubbins,\
    \ begins with G, so in this instalment of our alphabetic postage schedule, you\
    \ have had double helpings. Remember that, next time you are minded to bemoan\
    \ your lot."
