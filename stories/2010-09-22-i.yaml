  text: "This morning I embarked upon the latest, and I hope final, proofreadnig of\
    \ the forthcoming Hooting Yard paperback anthology. As I read, a Great Imponderable\
    \ occurred to me, and as it happens the \u2018I\u2019 in our alphabetic schedule\
    \ stands for Imponderable.\nWhy is it, I wonder, that so many of my stories are\
    \ set in the countryside, and feature peasants and farmyards and rustic squalor,\
    \ given that I grew up on a suburban council estate and have lived my entire life,\
    \ apart from about two months in 1980, in what Keith Pratt in Nuts In May calls\
    \ \u201Cthe hurly-burly of the urban conurbation\u201D?"
