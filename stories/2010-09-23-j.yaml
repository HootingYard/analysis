  text: 'The OED defines jiggery-pokery as "deceitful or dishonest ''manipulation'';
    hocus-pocus, humbug". By OED, I mean the Oxford English Dictionary of course,
    the common referent of that abbreviation. The out of print pamphleteer Dobson,
    however, tried to foist upon the world another OED, the Omni-Encyclopaedia Dobsonia.
    We must be careful, when ploughing through the works of the pamphleteer, not to
    mistake one OED for the other. If we look up "jiggery-pokery" in Dobson''s own
    OED, we are told simply, "see pamphlet". In fact, pretty much anything we look
    up in Dobson''s OED carries the same advice or instruction. It is difficult to
    see the point of this so-called reference work, which consumed many, many hours
    of the pamphleteer''s time. Even if we consider it as a sort of universal index
    to the contents of his pamphlets, it is by and large worthless, as he never deigns
    to inform us which particular pamphlet he is enjoining us to "see".

    In the case of jiggery-pokery, though, we are on firm ground. The pamphlet to
    which the OEDobsonia refers must be The History, Theory And Practice Of Jiggery-Pokery,
    From Ancient Times Up To Yesterday Morning, With Practical Tips And Cut Out ''N''
    Keep Cardboard Display Models For Your Mantelpiece (out of print). At barely a
    dozen pages, the pamphlet is distressingly brief, and nowhere does Dobson grant
    us a definition, so we are never entirely clear what he means, or understands,
    by the term "jiggery-pokery". There is one lengthy paragraph which seeks to describe,
    in mind-numbing detail, a series of "manipulations", "passing movements", "flummeries
    and gesticulations" and "hoo-hah" which the pamphleteer watched being performed
    by a man he describes as "a shattered ship''s captain" on board a boat plying
    an unidentified sound on New Year''s Eve 1949. If we accept this to be a description
    of jiggery-pokery, we are none the wiser regarding its purpose, as Dobson does
    not bother to tell us. One suspects he had no idea what he was looking at.

    The pamphlet''s title makes great claims, which only the most charitable reader
    could consider are met. History? Well, Dobson has a couple of sentences in which
    he makes glancing reference to "well-known instances of jiggery-pokery by Lars
    Porsena of Clusium and one-eyed Horatius Cocles" and to "that funny business involving
    a certain Frankish king", but we are left scratching our heads wondering what
    on earth he is talking about. I just scratched my head, incidentally, and a beetle
    fell out of my bouffant. Time to wash my hair with a proprietary shampoo! Wait
    there.

    I have returned, cleaned and preened and ready to proceed. Where were we? Ah yes.
    If the "history" element of the pamphlet''s title is scarcely justifiable, what
    about "theory"? On page five, Dobson announces, with quiet menace, "The time has
    come to consider jiggery-pokery in the abstract". This is menacing because anybody
    who has even a passing acquaintance with the pamphleteer''s work knows that when
    he embarks upon passages of "abstraction" the best thing to do is to bash one''s
    head repeatedly against a surface of adamantine hardness until one loses consciousness.
    There was a time, when I was foolishly attempting to write a magazine article
    entitled "Abstract Dobson", when I actually installed a rectangular panel of granite
    next to my writing desk, so I could do the bashing without having to get up from
    my chair. If you fear your cranium cannot withstand repeated bashing, it is important
    to find an alternative method of dealing with the all too potent horrors of Dobson
    in "abstract" mode. Some illegal pharmacists with pharmacies tucked away down
    sordid alleyways may be able to procure for you the kinds of powdered tranquilisers
    that can stun an entire herd of cattle, but ingesting them, even in a bergamot-scented
    tisane, has its own risks. Some more experienced Dobsonists have tried the trick
    of simply flipping past the awful pages and resuming their reading when the pamphleteer
    gets some sense back in his head. Do what you have to do.

    For now, all I will say about Dobson''s "Theory of Jiggery-Pokery" is... glubb...
    glubb...glubb-glubb. Some of you will recognise that as the telephone call made
    by a terrifying semi-aquatic creature in The Thing On The Doorstep by H P Lovecraft.
    Warning enough, I think.

    And so we come to "Practice", which I suppose Dobson addresses in that interminable
    paragraph about the shattered ship''s captain, but as we have seen, whether what
    he witnessed was jiggery-pokery, or some kind of maritime ballet, is by no means
    clear. Over the years I have watched various crew members of ships, from Rear
    Admirals to barnacle scrapers, perform all sorts of baffling physical manoeuvres,
    and not once have I thought any of it fitted the definition of jiggery-pokery,
    except on one occasion when I was aboard a very sinister ship which sailed into
    a clammy mist, in which all sorts of ugly shenanigans took place until, at the
    last, I was marooned, with several other paying passengers, upon a remote atoll,
    populated only by squelchy creeping things, and bereft of paper and pencils and
    writing desks and panels of adamantine hardness. Luckily, the one, brine-soaked,
    Dobson pamphlet I managed to salvage from the ship was written in his more familiar
    majestic sweeping paragraphs, with nary a pippet of "abstraction" within it. Its
    title, by the way, was Popular Games And Pastimes Suitable For Those Marooned
    On Remote Atolls Pending Rescue By A Ship Of Fools (out of print).

    Returning to the pamphlet under discussion, my copy of The History, Theory And
    Practice Of Jiggery-Pokery, From Ancient Times Up To Yesterday Morning, With Practical
    Tips And Cut Out ''N'' Keep Cardboard Display Models For Your Mantelpiece contains
    neither practical tips nor cut out ''n'' keep cardboard display models for my
    mantelpiece, not that I have a mantelpiece in my chalet, for architectural reasons.
    I suspect Dobson appended these items to his title to woo a wider readership,
    attracting the kinds of people who like practical tips and the construction of
    cardboard display models. I once cut out, from a Kellogg''s cornflakes carton,
    ''n'' constructed ''n'' kept, a cardboard display model of the head, just the
    head, of Henry VIII. But that was long ago, when I was young and tiny, and almost
    as long ago it was lost. Both are lost, the time of my youth and the cardboard
    head, lost too, one suspects, the wits of Dobson when he sat down to write his
    jiggery-pokery pamphlet. Perhaps that was his own kind of jiggery-pokery, as a
    pamphleteer, to convince us he was a sensible man writing sensible prose, when
    more often than not he was a nincompoop.'
