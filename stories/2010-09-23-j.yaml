  text: "The OED defines jiggery-pokery as \u201Cdeceitful or dishonest \u2018manipulation\u2019\
    ; hocus-pocus, humbug\u201D. By OED, I mean the Oxford English Dictionary of course,\
    \ the common referent of that abbreviation. The out of print pamphleteer Dobson,\
    \ however, tried to foist upon the world another OED, the Omni-Encyclopaedia Dobsonia.\
    \ We must be careful, when ploughing through the works of the pamphleteer, not\
    \ to mistake one OED for the other. If we look up \u201Cjiggery-pokery\u201D in\
    \ Dobson's own OED, we are told simply, \u201Csee pamphlet\u201D. In fact, pretty\
    \ much anything we look up in Dobson's OED carries the same advice or instruction.\
    \ It is difficult to see the point of this so-called reference work, which consumed\
    \ many, many hours of the pamphleteer's time. Even if we consider it as a sort\
    \ of universal index to the contents of his pamphlets, it is by and large worthless,\
    \ as he never deigns to inform us which particular pamphlet he is enjoining us\
    \ to \u201Csee\u201D.\nIn the case of jiggery-pokery, though, we are on firm ground.\
    \ The pamphlet to which the OEDobsonia refers must be The History, Theory And\
    \ Practice Of Jiggery-Pokery, From Ancient Times Up To Yesterday Morning, With\
    \ Practical Tips And Cut Out \u2018N\u2019 Keep Cardboard Display Models For Your\
    \ Mantelpiece (out of print). At barely a dozen pages, the pamphlet is distressingly\
    \ brief, and nowhere does Dobson grant us a definition, so we are never entirely\
    \ clear what he means, or understands, by the term \u201Cjiggery-pokery\u201D\
    . There is one lengthy paragraph which seeks to describe, in mind-numbing detail,\
    \ a series of \u201Cmanipulations\u201D, \u201Cpassing movements\u201D, \u201C\
    flummeries and gesticulations\u201D and \u201Choo-hah\u201D which the pamphleteer\
    \ watched being performed by a man he describes as \u201Ca shattered ship's captain\u201D\
    \ on board a boat plying an unidentified sound on New Year's Eve 1949. If we accept\
    \ this to be a description of jiggery-pokery, we are none the wiser regarding\
    \ its purpose, as Dobson does not bother to tell us. One suspects he had no idea\
    \ what he was looking at.\nThe pamphlet's title makes great claims, which only\
    \ the most charitable reader could consider are met. History? Well, Dobson has\
    \ a couple of sentences in which he makes glancing reference to \u201Cwell-known\
    \ instances of jiggery-pokery by Lars Porsena of Clusium and one-eyed Horatius\
    \ Cocles\u201D and to \u201Cthat funny business involving a certain Frankish king\u201D\
    , but we are left scratching our heads wondering what on earth he is talking about.\
    \ I just scratched my head, incidentally, and a beetle fell out of my bouffant.\
    \ Time to wash my hair with a proprietary shampoo! Wait there.\nI have returned,\
    \ cleaned and preened and ready to proceed. Where were we? Ah yes. If the \u201C\
    history\u201D element of the pamphlet's title is scarcely justifiable, what about\
    \ \u201Ctheory\u201D? On page five, Dobson announces, with quiet menace, \u201C\
    The time has come to consider jiggery-pokery in the abstract\u201D. This is menacing\
    \ because anybody who has even a passing acquaintance with the pamphleteer's work\
    \ knows that when he embarks upon passages of \u201Cabstraction\u201D the best\
    \ thing to do is to bash one's head repeatedly against a surface of adamantine\
    \ hardness until one loses consciousness. There was a time, when I was foolishly\
    \ attempting to write a magazine article entitled \u201CAbstract Dobson\u201D\
    , when I actually installed a rectangular panel of granite next to my writing\
    \ desk, so I could do the bashing without having to get up from my chair. If you\
    \ fear your cranium cannot withstand repeated bashing, it is important to find\
    \ an alternative method of dealing with the all too potent horrors of Dobson in\
    \ \u201Cabstract\u201D mode. Some illegal pharmacists with pharmacies tucked away\
    \ down sordid alleyways may be able to procure for you the kinds of powdered tranquilisers\
    \ that can stun an entire herd of cattle, but ingesting them, even in a bergamot-scented\
    \ tisane, has its own risks. Some more experienced Dobsonists have tried the trick\
    \ of simply flipping past the awful pages and resuming their reading when the\
    \ pamphleteer gets some sense back in his head. Do what you have to do.\nFor now,\
    \ all I will say about Dobson's \u201CTheory of Jiggery-Pokery\u201D is\u2026\
    \ glubb\u2026 glubb\u2026glubb-glubb. Some of you will recognise that as the telephone\
    \ call made by a terrifying semi-aquatic creature in The Thing On The Doorstep\
    \ by H P Lovecraft. Warning enough, I think.\nAnd so we come to \u201CPractice\u201D\
    , which I suppose Dobson addresses in that interminable paragraph about the shattered\
    \ ship's captain, but as we have seen, whether what he witnessed was jiggery-pokery,\
    \ or some kind of maritime ballet, is by no means clear. Over the years I have\
    \ watched various crew members of ships, from Rear Admirals to barnacle scrapers,\
    \ perform all sorts of baffling physical manoeuvres, and not once have I thought\
    \ any of it fitted the definition of jiggery-pokery, except on one occasion when\
    \ I was aboard a very sinister ship which sailed into a clammy mist, in which\
    \ all sorts of ugly shenanigans took place until, at the last, I was marooned,\
    \ with several other paying passengers, upon a remote atoll, populated only by\
    \ squelchy creeping things, and bereft of paper and pencils and writing desks\
    \ and panels of adamantine hardness. Luckily, the one, brine-soaked, Dobson pamphlet\
    \ I managed to salvage from the ship was written in his more familiar majestic\
    \ sweeping paragraphs, with nary a pippet of \u201Cabstraction\u201D within it.\
    \ Its title, by the way, was Popular Games And Pastimes Suitable For Those Marooned\
    \ On Remote Atolls Pending Rescue By A Ship Of Fools (out of print).\nReturning\
    \ to the pamphlet under discussion, my copy of The History, Theory And Practice\
    \ Of Jiggery-Pokery, From Ancient Times Up To Yesterday Morning, With Practical\
    \ Tips And Cut Out \u2018N\u2019 Keep Cardboard Display Models For Your Mantelpiece\
    \ contains neither practical tips nor cut out \u2018n\u2019 keep cardboard display\
    \ models for my mantelpiece, not that I have a mantelpiece in my chalet, for architectural\
    \ reasons. I suspect Dobson appended these items to his title to woo a wider readership,\
    \ attracting the kinds of people who like practical tips and the construction\
    \ of cardboard display models. I once cut out, from a Kellogg's cornflakes carton,\
    \ \u2018n\u2019 constructed \u2018n\u2019 kept, a cardboard display model of the\
    \ head, just the head, of Henry VIII. But that was long ago, when I was young\
    \ and tiny, and almost as long ago it was lost. Both are lost, the time of my\
    \ youth and the cardboard head, lost too, one suspects, the wits of Dobson when\
    \ he sat down to write his jiggery-pokery pamphlet. Perhaps that was his own kind\
    \ of jiggery-pokery, as a pamphleteer, to convince us he was a sensible man writing\
    \ sensible prose, when more often than not he was a nincompoop."
