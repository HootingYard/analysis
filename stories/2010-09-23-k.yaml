  text: 'I have decided that K, in our alphabetic schedule, stands for Knowledge.
    More specifically, this postage is about the status of Knowledge, how we know
    what we know, and how we can "know" things which we know are untrue. Actually,
    the real reason K stands for Knowledge is simply that I wanted to advert to this
    splendid postage by backwatersman. Having read just the title, and been astounded,
    I now "know" that...

    The last words of the Emperor Napoleon were "weasel trappers may be lurking in
    your area".

    Alas and alack! I then continued to read the full postage, and though I was mightily
    entertained--and learned a thing or two--I was shattered to discover that these
    were not Napoleon''s last words, nor had anybody ever claimed them to be. But
    to look on the bright side, there is a part of my brain that will always have
    the comfort of once, very briefly, on this day, having "known" that they were.

    I am happy to admit that this was a pretty desperate attempt to shoehorn an otherwise
    K-free postage into my scheme. I could have waited for M for Misreading, or N
    for Napoleon, or even W for Weasel, but I was impatient. You will thank me for
    it one day.'
