  text: "I have decided that K, in our alphabetic schedule, stands for Knowledge.\
    \ More specifically, this postage is about the status of Knowledge, how we know\
    \ what we know, and how we can \u201Cknow\u201D things which we know are untrue.\
    \ Actually, the real reason K stands for Knowledge is simply that I wanted to\
    \ advert to this splendid postage by backwatersman. Having read just the title,\
    \ and been astounded, I now \u201Cknow\u201D that\u2026\nThe last words of the\
    \ Emperor Napoleon were \u201Cweasel trappers may be lurking in your area\u201D\
    .\nAlas and alack! I then continued to read the full postage, and though I was\
    \ mightily entertained\u2014and learned a thing or two\u2014I was shattered to\
    \ discover that these were not Napoleon's last words, nor had anybody ever claimed\
    \ them to be. But to look on the bright side, there is a part of my brain that\
    \ will always have the comfort of once, very briefly, on this day, having \u201C\
    known\u201D that they were.\nI am happy to admit that this was a pretty desperate\
    \ attempt to shoehorn an otherwise K-free postage into my scheme. I could have\
    \ waited for M for Misreading, or N for Napoleon, or even W for Weasel, but I\
    \ was impatient. You will thank me for it one day."
