    We interrupt this programme alphabet to point readers, with a pointy stick, towards
    The Dabbler, where this week Mr Key''s cupboard contains a couple of pieces about
    Belshazzar''s feast. Or, more accurately, one is set before Belshazzar''s feast,
    and the other just after it. Intriguingly, when these little tales first appeared
    here at Hooting Yard, many readers thought they were about the Swedish pop group
    Abba, presumably because the protagonists share their Christian names with the
    Scandinavian foursome, and quote lyrics from a couple of their songlets. I would
    like to take this opportunity to make it crystal clear that these are sheer coincidences,
    and no resemblance to any real persons, either living or passed beyond mortal
    realms, was intended.

    ADDENDUM : The two "Belshazzar''s Feast" tales, with musical accompaniment provided
    by legendary noise decomposer Lepke Buchwater, will form Mr Key''s segment of
    the Resonance Radio Orchestra evening at the Jellyfish Theatre on Sunday 3rd October.
