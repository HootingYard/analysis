  text: 'After that little interruption we return to our alphabetic schedule with
    L. And as with G, L is a double bill, for L stands for both Lettuce and Leeks.

    According to the BBC, there was much amusement recently when police in Hampshire
    released an e-fit picture of a burglary suspect who appeared to be wearing a lettuce
    on his head.


    What has gone unremarked is the possibility that the image may be devastatingly
    accurate, and that it is the habit of burglars and other ne''er-do-wells in the
    Hampshire area to sport the makings of salads upon their bonces. It would not
    surprise me if some urban folklorist, attached perhaps to a polytechnic, was at
    this very moment preparing a monograph on, say, the radish-wearing footpad of
    Gosport, or the Winchester Watercress Rascal.

    A wider range of vegetables has been used by miscreant scamps in the past, of
    course, though for hiding behind rather than wearing openly upon the head. Six
    long years ago here at Hooting Yard we dealt, in passing, with the case of the
    chap who skulked under cover of a serried array of leeks hanging from a ceiling.


    It just goes to show that sooner or later the so-called "real world" tends to
    catch up with Hooting Yard, albeit sometimes at a slightly lopsided or tangential
    angle.'
