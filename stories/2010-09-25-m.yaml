    M is for Mead, that is Dr Richard Mead (1673-1754), and also for his Medica Sacra
    : Or, A Commentary On The Most Remarkable Diseases Mentioned In The Holy Scriptures
    (1748, posthumously reprinted 1755). Here you can read about the diseases of Job,
    Jehoram, Judas, Herod, and others, also of palsy, demoniacs, and "the bloody sweat
    of Christ". The full text is online, and to whet your appetite here is part of
    Mead''s chapter on the disease of our old pal King Nebuchadnezzar:

    "Those things, which are related of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, appear so
    surprizing and contrary to nature, that some interpreters have imagined that he
    was really transformed into a beast. For ''being driven from the company of men
    for seven years, his dwelling was with the beasts of the field, he fed on grass
    as oxen; his body was wetted with the dew of heaven; his hair and nails were grown
    like those of birds. At length at the end of that space of time, his understanding
    was restored to him, and he was established in his kingdom, and excellent majesty
    was added unto him. Now his crime was pride and the contempt of God'' [See Daniel,
    Chap. iv. and v.]

    "All these circumstances agree so perfectly well with hypochondriacal madness,
    that to me it appears evident, that Nebuchadnezzar was seized with this distemper,
    and under its influence ran wild into the fields: and that, fancying himself transformed
    into an ox, he fed on grass in the manner of cattle. For every sort of madness
    is, as I shall specify more particularly hereafter, a disease of a disturbed imagination;
    which this unhappy man laboured under full seven years. And thro'' neglect of
    taking proper care of himself, his hair and nails grew to an excessive length;
    whereby the latter growing thicker and crooked, resembled the claws of birds.
    Now, the ancients called persons affected with this species of madness [Greek:
    lykanthropoi] or [Greek: kynanthropoi]; because they went abroad in the night,
    imitating wolves or dogs; particularly intent upon opening the sepulchres of the
    dead, and had their legs much ulcerated either by frequent falls, or the bites
    of dogs."

    ADDENDUM : I suppose, given the day, that M ought to have stood for Miliband.
    Thereagain, if we are to have an M Addendum, I would prefer that it be this quotation
    from Charles Darwin, from one of his letters : "Would anyone trust in the convictions
    of a monkey''s mind?"'
