  text: "O is for Ozymandias\n\u201CMy name is Ozymandias, King of Kings, / Look on\
    \ my Works ye Mighty, and despair!\u201D\nNow as it happens, I am mighty, and\
    \ I was hanging around one Thursday morning on the boundless and bare lone and\
    \ level sands, and I took the opportunity to look on the works of the King of\
    \ Kings, and I did not despair. What I did was guffaw. Well, first I belched,\
    \ for I had just finished eating a big pie, two dozen blackbirds baked in puff\
    \ pastry, with a side helping of spring onions and marmalade. I belched, and then\
    \ I guffawed. Not everyone is able to emit a full-throated guffaw, in all its\
    \ glory, but I can. I used to be a chuckler, but that was before I embraced my\
    \ mightiness, and developed a guffaw to go with it. I was taught it by a mountebank,\
    \ on a seaside pier, far away from the sands on which I was prancing on that Thursday\
    \ morning.\nI had been sent to inspect the works of Ozymandias by one mightier\
    \ than myself, if you can imagine such a personage. This unbelievably mighty wight\
    \ was so mighty he would have flicked Ozymandias from his mighty presence as if\
    \ the King of Kings were a mere fly, or a bluebottle. He, my mighty employer,\
    \ had not had a moment to spare to go and see the works of Ozymandias, but he\
    \ had heard reports, and was aware of the accepted wisdom that looking on them\
    \ could plunge him into despair. Such a prospect confounded his mighty brain,\
    \ so he took me on as a sort of surveyor-emissary, at a handsome salary.\n\u201C\
    Go thou and look upon the works of Ozymandias, King of Kings!\u201D he boomed\
    \ in his mighty baritone at the conclusion of my interview, \u201CAnd make haste\
    \ to return to my mighty office on the top floor of this mighty skyscraper, and\
    \ tell me of your findings. Though you are a mere speck of weediness in comparison\
    \ to me, you are yet sufficiently mighty to be in a position to test the authenticity\
    \ of Ozymandias\u2019 claim.\u201D\nBefore leaving the skyscraper, I called in\
    \ to the PX to collect a wadge of pie-coupons. As I was counting them, and calculating\
    \ how many blackbird pies I would be able to devour during my survey, it so happened\
    \ that the mountebank who had taught me to guffaw popped in.\n\u201CI hear you\
    \ are going to look on the works of Ozymandias, King of Kings,\u201D he said.\n\
    \u201CGosh, news travels mightily fast in this skyscraper,\u201D I replied.\n\u201C\
    That it does, that it does,\u201D said the mountebank, \u201CBut remember, this\
    \ skyscraper, mighty as it is, will one day topple, or be toppled, and be nought\
    \ but dust and ashes. In fact, I have it on good authority that such topplement\
    \ may well occur before you have time to return from the boundless and bare lone\
    \ and level sands for which you are headed.\u201D\n\u201CReally?\u201D I asked.\n\
    The mountebank tapped a finger on the side of his nose in the universal gesture\
    \ of conspiratorial scalliwaggery, and then he swept away, his cape billowing\
    \ behind him with controlled urgency and stylish \xE9lan.\nAnd that is why, on\
    \ that Thursday morning some weeks later, I guffawed as I looked on the works\
    \ of Ozymandias, King of Kings. For the mighty skyscraper had toppled, and in\
    \ its topplement my mighty employer had perished. I had my fat salary, and half\
    \ my wadge of pie-coupons, and a belly full of blackbird pie and spring onions\
    \ and marmalade, and I need never return from the boundless and bare lone and\
    \ level sands. Here I could build my own mighty works, and guffaw at the universe!\
    \ Now there was none mightier than me!"
