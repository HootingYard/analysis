  text: 'P is for Piffle

    Some people do spout the most extraordinary piffle, and I suppose we should expect
    the words of politicians to be particularly piffle-strewn. Consider this, reported
    in today''s Grauniad:

    "One of his shadow cabinet allies insisted Ed Miliband was growing in stature
    as a leader by the hour."

    By the hour? He became the Labour Party leader on Saturday afternoon, and if we
    grant that to get elected in the first place he must already have demonstrated
    just a teensiest smidgen of leadership quality, what on earth must he be like
    by now, and what will he be like in a week''s and a month''s time? Assuming the
    next general election takes place in 2015, and his stature continues to grow by
    the hour, he will have become a mighty potentate, a modern Ozymandias, King of
    Kings!


    Young Ned Miliband, soon-to-be Supreme And Majestic Potentate Of The Universe'
