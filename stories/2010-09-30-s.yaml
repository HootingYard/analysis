  text: "S is for Saints\nWell, just one saint, actually, Saint Bibblybibdib, the\
    \ church dedicated to whom stands, in partial ruin, in sunlight that is forever\
    \ dappled, as was Saint Bibblybibdib himself, usually, by all accounts. It may\
    \ have been that Gerard Manley Hopkins was thinking of St Bibblybibdib when he\
    \ wrote \u201CGlory be to God for dappled things\u201D in Pied Beauty, though\
    \ in praising \u201Call things counter, original, spare, strange\u201D the Jesuit\
    \ does not actually mention the saint by name, or indeed by inference, and it\
    \ may be that I am just indulging in wishful thinking. It would not be for the\
    \ first time.\nHis dappledom, whatever may have caused it, is one of the few things\
    \ we know about St Bibblybibdib. As with many, though not all, saints, his life\
    \ is more myth than history, and it is arguable that he never existed at all,\
    \ being rather an amalgam of several shadowy figures obscured by the mists of\
    \ time. Who those figures might be is open to conjecture. One recent hagiographer\
    \ posits the possibility that the saint we think of as \u201CSaint Bibblybibdib\u201D\
    \ is a combination of over two hundred persons of mediaeval times or earlier,\
    \ who all got cobbled together through an error in the illumination of a codex\
    \ in the scriptorium of an abbey perched on a declivity in the foothills of a\
    \ large and important mountain range during a ferocious twelfth-century thunderstorm.\n\
    But just as I prefer to imagine Father Hopkins sprawled on the grass among the\
    \ tombstones of Saint Bibblybibdib's churchyard on a gorgeous springtime afternoon,\
    \ contemplating the saint and writing his sprung rhythms, so I like to imagine\
    \ a real, corporeal, dappled saint, roaming mediaeval fields and riversides, dressed\
    \ in some sort of ecclesiastical garb, a battered halo hovering above his bonce,\
    \ being saintly.\nWhat else do we know about him? Not much. His symbolic attributes\
    \ include a toasting-fork, a funerary urn, a finch and a robin, half a wolf, a\
    \ bloody sword, a corrective boot and a medallion of beaten tin. These are arrayed\
    \ around him, clockwise in alphabetical order, in his icons, some of which date\
    \ as far back as 1937, when he was canonised, on the same day, coincidentally,\
    \ as the Hindenburg disaster. That hagiographer I mentioned posits something else,\
    \ as it happens. He claims the Hindenburg exploded in gigantic balls of flaming\
    \ gas because one of the crew was heard to curse Saint Bibblybibdib as the airship\
    \ approached Lakehurst Naval Air Station for its high landing, known as a \u201C\
    flying moor\u201D because it would be moored to a high mooring point, and then\
    \ winched down to ground level. As we know, there was to be no winching of an\
    \ airship on that fateful day. The hagiographer provides no evidence for this\
    \ grave charge, which must cause considerable pain to any living relatives of\
    \ the cursing crewman, and which, it must be said, paints Saint Bibblybibdib himself\
    \ as a petulant and vengeful saint, flying into a rage at the merest slight. I\
    \ am sure there must be at least a few saints of whom that might be a fitting\
    \ character sketch, but surely not dear old Saint Bibblybibdib! I prefer to think\
    \ of him dappled, with his attributes, bestowing his patronage hither and thither.\
    \ Alas, as far as I have been able to ascertain, Saint Bibblybibdib is the patron\
    \ saint of nothing, of nothing or no one at all."
