  text: T is for Taylor, more precisely Joseph Taylor, author of Apparitions or, The
    Mystery of Ghosts, Hobgoblins, and Haunted Houses Developed. Being A Collection
    Of Entertaining Stories, Founded On Fact, And Selected For The Purpose Of Eradicating
    Those Fears, Which The Ignorant, The Weak, And The Superstitious, Are But Too
    Apt To Encourage, For Want Of Properly Examining Into The Causes Of Such Absurd
    Impositions (1815), wherein he remarks, inter alia, "idiots in general are remarkably
    fond of any thing relative to a funeral procession". Well worth bearing in mind,
    I think.
