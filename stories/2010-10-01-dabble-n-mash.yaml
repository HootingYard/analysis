    While you wait for me to aim my alphabetic skewer at the letter U, hike over to
    The Dabbler where, it being Friday, the doors of my cupboard are thrown open.
    The doors of my cupboard, incidentally, are not unlike Aldous Huxley''s Doors
    Of Perception, in some ways. In other ways, they are utterly different. I shall
    leave it to you to allocate the similarities and differences, it will give you
    something to do at lunchtime. Anyway, this week I confess my foolish fascination
    with a president and his potatoes.'
