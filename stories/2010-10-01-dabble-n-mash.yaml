  While you wait for me to aim my alphabetic skewer at the letter U, hike over to
  The Dabbler where, it being Friday, the doors of my cupboard are thrown open. The
  doors of my cupboard, incidentally, are not unlike Aldous Huxley''s Doors Of Perception,
  in some ways. In other ways, they are utterly different. I shall leave it to you
  to allocate the similarities and differences, it will give you something to do at
  lunchtime. Anyway, this week I confess my foolish fascination with a president and
  his potatoes.'
