  text: 'Another brief interruption to the alphabetic schedule. I am reading Chris
    Mullin''s Decline And Fall : Diaries 2005--2010, packed with amusing anecdotes
    and observations. Most are of course political, but I was struck by this literary
    snippet:

    "Wednesday, 10 December 2008. To the Almeida theatre in Islington for Pat Kavanagh''s
    memorial meeting. Strictly by invitation to exclude the Evening Standard and the
    dreadful Jeanette Winterson."'
