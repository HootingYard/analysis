  text: "V is for Vinkensport, surely one of the most foolish\u2014and tedious\u2014\
    sports ever devised. I make no apologies for lifting the following description\
    \ directly from the Wikipedia (with minor tamperings and omissions):\n\u201CVinkensport\
    \ (Dutch for \u201Cfinch sport\u201D) is a competitive animal sport in which male\
    \ chaffinches are made to compete for the highest number of bird calls in an hour.\
    \ Also called vinkenzetting (Dutch for \u201Cfinch sitting\u201D), it is primarily\
    \ active in the Dutch-speaking Flanders region of Belgium.\n\u201CVinkensport\
    \ traces its origins to competitions held by Flemish merchants in 1596, and is\
    \ considered part of traditional Flemish culture. As of 2007, it is estimated\
    \ that there were over 13,000 enthusiasts, called vinkeniers (\u201Cfinchers\u201D\
    ), breeding 10,000 birds every year. Animal rights activists have opposed the\
    \ sport for much of its history.\n\u201CIn a contest, a row of small cages, each\
    \ housing a single male finch, is lined up approximately six feet apart along\
    \ a street. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time\
    \ a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their call\u2014most often transcribed\
    \ as susk-e-wiet\u2014a tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The\
    \ bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest.\n\u201C\
    The earliest known records of vinkeniers are from 1596. By the late nineteenth\
    \ century, vinkenzetting's popularity had diminished significantly, but it saw\
    \ a resurgence after the First World War.\n\u201CVinkeniers use a variety of methods\
    \ to increase the number of calls in their birds. Techniques to develop singing\
    \ aptitude include selective breeding programs, high-protein diets, and stimulating\
    \ them with music and recordings of bird song. As wild finches generally begin\
    \ singing during the spring mating season, keepers may also use artificial lights\
    \ placed in aviaries to encourage increased song.\n\u201CSome vinkeniers claim\
    \ that finches from the different regions of Belgium sing in different dialects,\
    \ with birds from Flanders singing \u201Cin Dutch\u201D and those from Wallonia\
    \ singing undesirably \u201Cin French\u201D. While minute regional differences\
    \ in song have been observed in the chaffinch (though not within Belgium), the\
    \ differences have only been reliably distinguishable by the use of sonograms.\
    \ Taxonomically, there are no officially-recognized subspecies of chaffinch within\
    \ Belgium.\n\u201CAs with other sports, vinkensport has had its cheating scandals,\
    \ as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278\
    \ susk-e-weits in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird\
    \ with testosterone. After one contestant sang the exact same number of calls\
    \ in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.\u201D\
    \nThere is further material in the original article about various cruelties practised\
    \ by vinkeniers, which you may\_go and read if you wish. I have not included it\
    \ here because I know deep in my heart that there is not a single Hooting Yard\
    \ reader who would ever countenance cruelty to our avian pals, and I do not wish\
    \ to nauseate you.\nIf you are thinking of taking up competitive Vinkensport,\
    \ might I suggest that you may need to be incarcerated in a mercy home for those\
    \ plagued by criminal insanity directed towards birds?"
