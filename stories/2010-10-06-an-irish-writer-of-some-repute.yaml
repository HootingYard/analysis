  text: 'While I have been beavering away at my alphabet, a few other things have
    cropped up which I couldn''t easily slot into the scheme. Among them, this:

    "One evening, an acquaintance of mine, who is an Irish writer of some repute,
    having drunk rather more than was good for him, a by no means unusual occurrence,
    in attempting to stagger home from his club, by some means he could never quite
    explain, got into a strange house instead of his own, and found himself in a semi-dark
    room full of queer-looking people, male and female, clad in leopard skins. Being
    given a skin by a dark, foreign-looking girl, he tried to put it on and, in spite
    of his addled senses, he so far succeeded that no one appeared to notice it was
    upside down. Probably no one paid any heed to him, everyone''s attention being
    centred on a woman, who was standing in the middle of the room, haranguing them.
    My friend could not see her very distinctly owing to the lights being turned down,
    but he judged her to be coloured, she looked so dark, and not a British subject,
    as she spoke with a decided foreign accent. The cool night air, blowing into the
    room, through an open window near at hand, gradually sobered him, and his brain
    became quite clear. He realised then that the people around him belonged to some
    strange exotic cult, and finally the amazing fact that they were Leopard and Panther
    People dawned on him."

    The quotation is from Strange Cults And Secret Societies Of Modern London by Elliott
    O''Donnell, published in 1934. If his book is to be believed, Mr O''Donnell could
    hardly walk into a pub or a hotel lobby, or stroll through a park, without bumping
    into someone who had an astonishing tale to tell of weird and hitherto unsuspected
    goings-on in the city and its suburbs. You will be hearing more from him in coming
    days.'
