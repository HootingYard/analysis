  text: 'Y is for Yachtsman

    Some years ago, were one strolling in a marina or a harbour, it would be quite
    common to hear a bunch of tinies chanting a rhyme as they danced, hand in hand,
    in a ring around a collapsed and comatose seaside sot.

    See the drunken yachtsman, vomit on his blazer / It is Mijnheer Blotzmann, zap
    him with your Taser!

    There are several problems with this, and we are indebted to Arturo Himmelfarbarb,
    the noted collector of children''s gruesome seaside songs, who recently published
    a research paper in which he tabulates the perplexities on an abstruse graph,
    with pointy bits and no doubt expensive four-colour printing. As is the way with
    good old Arturo, a draconian embargo has been placed on the graph, so I cannot
    reproduce it here. Instead, I will do my best to summarise the points he makes,
    using plain words rather than exciting graphic hullabaloo.

    First, Blotzmann is given the Dutch honorific "Mijnheer", in spite of the fact
    that all the available evidence suggests he was Swiss. Though there have been
    arguments, of deathly tedium, questioning his nationality, nobody has ever claimed
    Blotzmann was a Netherlander, or even a Belgian. As for the so-called "Afrikaaner
    Cradle-In-The-Nursery Conjecture", that nonsense was comprehensively demolished
    long, long ago, by yours truly, on primetime television no less, thanks to the
    good offices of Russell Harty.

    Secondly, Blotzmann was famously teetotal, and never allowed a drop of spiritous
    liquor to pass his lips. The idea that he would be found lying ruined by drink
    at a marina is laughable. It is true he was fond of the sea, which he memorably
    described as "that soaking wet immensity stretching to the horizon and beyond",
    and often skulked about ports and harbours and quaysides and marinas, doing his
    Blotzmanny doings, but those doings were always done sober, have no doubt about
    that. To which one might add that his love of coastal purlieux did not extend
    to the sea itself, for he was a boat-scared man all his life. That he would ever
    have gone yachting is inconceivable.

    In a different section of his fantastic graph, Arturo demonstrates that at the
    time the children''s ditty was recorded, the Taser had not yet been invented.
    In those days, if one wanted to fell a malefactor, one used a club or a bludgeon.
    The Taser itself, in its initial form, dates from 1974, the year of Potus Richard
    Nixon''s disgrace and resignation. In any case, as the upper right segment of
    the graph demonstrates with admirable clarity, one needs neither Taser nor club
    nor bludgeon to subdue a sot in a coma whose collapse is due to his having glugged
    an unconscionable amount of hooch.

    In sum, then, the rhyme makes no sense whatsoever. Hot-brained Gallic postmodernist
    Jacques Postmod has attempted to "undo", as he puts it, Arturo''s tremendous diagram,
    but nobody takes him seriously anymore, thank heaven.

    Which all goes to show that the life can be sucked out of even the jauntiest children''s
    chant when the leeches of academe are properly applied.'
