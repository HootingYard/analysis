  text: 'During the last splutters of the Harold Wilson years, I had occasion to read
    a slim book entitled Zen Buddhism, which consisted simply of a series of what
    I think are called koans, anecdotes or parables designed to assist one in striving
    towards enlightenment. I do not recall any particular koan in detail, but they
    all seemed very similar, and tucked away in my memory there is a sort of generic
    koan, which goes something like this:

    One day Bin-Bag was fishing in a stream, and he caught a pike. He decided to take
    it to his Master as a gift.

    "Here, Master, I have brought you a pike," he said.

    Bin-Bag''s Master took the pike, and then he picked up a stick and bashed his
    pupil about the head with it.

    "Ouch!" wailed Bin-Bag. "Why are you hitting me when I have brought you a pike?"

    The Master pushed Bin-Bag down a slope and resumed his meditation. Bin-Bag rubbed
    his head and understood he was one step further towards Enlightenment.

    I was young and impressionable, but even then I could see that this was complete
    twaddle. Compared to Zen, Roman Catholicism seemed sensible and coherent. I decided
    to have no truck with Eastern mysticism in future.

    Years later, however, I was glad I had read the book. I was commissioned to write
    a potted biography of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, and struggled to find an angle
    from which to approach the subject. Then I realised that the witless koans provided
    an ideal model. I was able to scribble dozens of short yarns about the Woohoohoodiwoo
    Woman, based on my faltering recollection of Zen koans. The only changes I had
    to make were to substitute the Zen Master''s bashing and shoving with the Woohoohoodiwoo
    Woman''s technique of making haphazard gesticulations at a robin, or at a flock
    of sparrows, or, in extremis, when faced with a particularly recalcitrant acolyte,
    wandering woozily off to a nearby kiosk to buy herself a toffee apple.

    And that brings us smartly to the end of our alphabet.'
