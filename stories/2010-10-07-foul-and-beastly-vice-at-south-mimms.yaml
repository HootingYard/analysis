  text: 'More shenanigans from Strange Cults And Secret Societies Of Modern London
    by Elliott O''Donnell (1934):

    "Just out of bravado [my friend] had slept several nights under a tree (known
    to followers of the tree cult as dangerous) near certain old cross-roads, in the
    South Mimms district. Now, like murder, some vices will ''out''; and when I saw
    my friend, after he had been sleeping under that tree, I was startled at the great
    change in his appearance. In his face I could detect signs of vice I had never
    associated with him before. He confessed his guilt to me, and attributed it, as
    I have already hinted, to the cross-roads and tree influence.

    "As he lay under the tree in question, watching its gently swaying branches over
    his head, and its smooth, gleaming trunk, he felt a current of vice emanating
    from it and passing into him. He felt it was trying to communicate telepathically
    with him, trying to fill his mind with its own foul and beastly ideas, and when
    at last he fell asleep, his dreams so strengthened his vicious thoughts that he
    could never shake them off. Day and night they obsessed him, and eventually he
    indulged in the vice from the urge to which there seemed to be no escape. As a
    last resource, in his efforts to turn over a new leaf, he went abroad, and I have
    never heard of him since."

    Questions : to what foul and beastly vice did Mr O''Donnell''s friend succumb,
    and is the sinister tree at South Mimms still standing? And what type of tree?
    A larch? A yew?'
