  text: 'What is it about South Mimms? Further revelations from Strange Cults And
    Secret Societies Of Modern London by Elliott O''Donnell (1934):

    "On All Hallows E''en certain members of the [Ghost] Circle were invited to meet,
    at eleven at night, in secrecy, at cross-roads not far from South Mimms. All turned
    up, the founder, as usual, arriving first, and on the neighbouring clock striking
    midnight, they were surprised to see a herd of pigs trotting down the road towards
    them, road and pigs gleaming white in the moonbeams. Never had any of the members
    of the Ghost Circle seen such pigs! They seemed to be positively gigantic, but
    thin. On they came, perfectly noiselessly, and on arriving at the cross-roads,
    they passed through a gateway into a field, leaving in their wake a current of
    icy air. There was something so strange and eerie about them that several members
    of the Ghost Circle, overcoming a certain reluctance, ran to the gate to have
    another look at them. The field, which afforded no cover of any kind, was very
    large, and it was empty, save for cattle. The pigs had inexplicably vanished.

    "The members of the Circle learned subsequently that the cross-roads were known
    to be haunted by a herd of phantom pigs, but only on All Hallows E''en."

    I think at the end of this month the Hooting Yard Phantom Pig Spotting Club should
    convene at that cross-roads in South Mimms. Be there or be square, as the hepcats
    used to say, half a century ago, daddy-o!'
