  text: "\nTo celebrate the restoration and reopening of Strawberry Hill, I suggest\
    \ we do our utmost to revive a word coined by Horace Walpole and used by him,\
    \ as far as I know, just once. Devoted Hooting Yard readers will know the word\
    \ whereof I speak, but it seemed appropriate to persuade readers of the super\
    \ soaraway\_Dabbler to join us in our cause."
