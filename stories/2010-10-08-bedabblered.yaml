  text: '

    To celebrate the restoration and reopening of Strawberry Hill, I suggest we do
    our utmost to revive a word coined by Horace Walpole and used by him, as far as
    I know, just once. Devoted Hooting Yard readers will know the word whereof I speak,
    but it seemed appropriate to persuade readers of the super soaraway Dabbler to
    join us in our cause.'
