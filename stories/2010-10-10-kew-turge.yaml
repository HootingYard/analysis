  text: "One twentieth-century Thursday, under a leaden sky, the balletomane Nan Kew\
    \ was gadding about the boulevards of Pointy Town when she encountered the Swiss\
    \ dramaturge Rolf Turge, accompanied by his deputy dramaturge Bob Dep.\nCue much\
    \ mwah! mwah! kissing of both air and cheeks, immediately after which Nan Kew,\
    \ balletomane that she was, began babbling excitedly about a new ballet she had\
    \ seen only the other day, a work of contemporary urgency in which the Hungarian\
    \ toxic sludge disaster was interpreted in the form of ungainly cavorting and\
    \ the tooting of piccolos.\n\u201CI agree it is both urgent and contemporary,\u201D\
    \ Rolf Turge managed to interrupt after ten minutes or so, \u201CBut it lacks\
    \ the even greater contemporaneity and hectic urgency with which a dramaturge,\
    \ particularly a Swiss one, would imbue it.\u201D\nBob Dep remained silent, for\
    \ unlike many a deputy, he was not facetious.\n\u201CEven were I to concede that\
    \ so unimprovable a ballet could be improved,\u201D said Nan Kew, \u201CSurely\
    \ an indigenous Hungarian dramaturge would out-turge one from Switzerland, no?\u201D\
    \n\u201CMight I suggest,\u201D said Rolf Turge, \u201CThat so ballet-bedizened\
    \ is your balletomane brain that the grand heroics of Swiss dramaturgy fall outwith\
    \ your pond of competence?\u201D\nHad they not been such fast pals, Nan Kew might\
    \ have taken offence at this. As it was, she made a mental note to ponder, next\
    \ time she could concentrate on something other than the ballet for a few minutes,\
    \ Rolf Turge's curious choice of the image of a pond to represent her area of\
    \ knowledge and expertise.\nBob Dep, who was skilled in the telepathic arts, chuckled\
    \ and butted in.\n\u201CPonder ponds as you like, Nan Kew, but the guvnor's usage\
    \ merely reflects his, and my, current preoccupation, which is the pond plays\
    \ of Maud Wasp, the waspish playwright.\u201D\n\u201CHave any of them been adapted\
    \ as ballets?\u201D asked the balletomane, predictably.\n\u201CNot as such,\u201D\
    \ said Bob Dep. If examined, this could be seen as an enigmatic statement, but\
    \ though he was telepathic, the deputy was as enigmatic as he was facetious, which\
    \ is to say not at all.\nNan Kew was about to resume her seemingly endless blathering\
    \ about the Hungarian toxic sludge disaster ballet, but before she could do so\
    \ Swiss dramaturge Rolf Turge blurted out a dramatic expostulation.\n\u201CLook!\u201D\
    \ he cried, \u201CA hole has been dug in the road, by some agency unknown to us,\
    \ though we might surmise it to have been a fellow with a spade.\u201D\nHe pointed,\
    \ as only a Swiss dramaturge could, with an elegant beringed finger at the hole,\
    \ and both Nan Kew and Bob Dep peered where he pointed.\nThe two gentlemen and\
    \ the lady then contemplated the length of dug-up pipeline exposed by the digging.\
    \ At that very moment, the astonishingly tall Renaissance man Peter Blegvad was\
    \ passing by, and he executed a drawing of the scene, helping to make it vivid\
    \ for us.\n\nBut not, perhaps, as vivid as we would like. The original drawing\
    \ was fanatic with detail of Nan Kew, Rolf Turge, and Bob Dep, so much so that\
    \ one might have mistaken it for a hyperrealist linocut by noted hyperrealist\
    \ linocutter Rex Hyper. But when Peter Blegvad showed the finished drawing to\
    \ the trio, they became strangely fractious, and insisted that he obscure their\
    \ features. Reluctantly, he did so, as you can see.\nUnbeknownst to Peter Blegvad,\
    \ the balletomane and the dramaturge and the deputy dramaturge were each of them\
    \ on the run from the Pointy Town police force, following a series of crimes against\
    \ the performing arts. How one might commit such crimes is a mystery, as Mrs Robert\
    \ Fripp might put it. Maud Wasp would put it more waspishly, were anyone to ask\
    \ her opinion. But nobody did, for she lived in an ivory tower, with her pet wasp\
    \ Martin, in an atmosphere of Jacobean tragedy."
