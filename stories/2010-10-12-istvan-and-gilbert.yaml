  text: 'Reading Gilbert Adair''s second Evadne Mount mystery, A Mysterious Affair
    Of Style (2007), I note that his film director character Rex Hanway has a cat
    called Cato. This served to remind me of a personal favourite from the implausibly
    vast Hooting Yard archives, the 2004 quotation from Spine-Tingling Tales Of Glucose
    Deficiency by Istvan Scrimgeour :  "He had two pets: a cat called Doge and a dog
    called Cato."'
