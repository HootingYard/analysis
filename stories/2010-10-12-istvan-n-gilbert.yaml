  text: "Reading Gilbert Adair's second Evadne Mount mystery, A Mysterious Affair\
    \ Of Style (2007), I note that his film director character Rex Hanway has a cat\
    \ called Cato. This served to remind me of a personal favourite from the implausibly\
    \ vast Hooting Yard archives, the 2004 quotation from Spine-Tingling Tales Of\
    \ Glucose Deficiency by Istvan Scrimgeour\_:\_ \u201CHe had two pets: a cat called\
    \ Doge and a dog called Cato.\u201D"
