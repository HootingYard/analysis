  text: "From the hallowed shed of OutaSpaceman, a new wonder! Taking a couple of\
    \ drawings from Hooting Yard calendars of the last century, he has fashioned a\
    \ breathtaking animated film:\nIt is to be hoped this will be shown on ResoVision,\
    \ ResonanceFM's four-day televisual experiment, beamed to you live from the Frieze\
    \ Art Fair. Word has it that Mr Key and Lepke B will be re-forming their double\
    \ act to present a brand new piece of gorgeousness\u2014as yet unwritten and un(de)composed\u2014\
    on Saturday."
