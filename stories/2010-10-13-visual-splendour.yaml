  text: 'From the hallowed shed of OutaSpaceman, a new wonder! Taking a couple of
    drawings from Hooting Yard calendars of the last century, he has fashioned a breathtaking
    animated film:

    It is to be hoped this will be shown on ResoVision, ResonanceFM''s four-day televisual
    experiment, beamed to you live from the Frieze Art Fair. Word has it that Mr Key
    and Lepke B will be re-forming their double act to present a brand new piece of
    gorgeousness--as yet unwritten and un(de)composed--on Saturday.'
