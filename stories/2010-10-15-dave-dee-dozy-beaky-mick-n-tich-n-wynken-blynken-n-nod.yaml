  text: Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich one night in the wood encountered a witch.
    She was a bricklaying witch and she carried a hod. She asked "Which of you is
    Blynken, which Wynken, which Nod?" Beaky replied on behalf of the five, "That
    trio is fictional, but we are alive. They were invented for verse by Eugene Field."
    With these words the fivesome's fate was sealed. The witch's countenance became
    twisted with hate and she cried "I'm his childhood sweetheart, Captivity Waite!
    He abandoned me, the cur, the dog, yet my name is immortalised in his autobiog,
    Love Affairs Of A Bibliomaniac", and then, maddened, she started to whack Dave
    Dee and Dozy and Beaky and Mick and Tich with brick after brick after brick until
    in the wood in the dead of the night the soul of each pop star took heavenward
    flight. Their mortal lives gone, they sat next to God, despatched by the bricklaying
    witch with her hod.
