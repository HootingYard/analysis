  text: "\nFor my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, I exhumed a brace of ancient\
    \ tales buried, like Chilean miners, deep in the Hooting Yard archives, dusted\
    \ them down, glued them together, and applied a lick o\u2019 lacquer to freshen\
    \ them up for a new readership. And in a promptly-posted comment, I preempt an\
    \ objection that may be raised by pedants on the lookout for flaws in what is\
    \ a piece of startling, even brutal, realism."
