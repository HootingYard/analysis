    For my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, I exhumed a brace of ancient tales buried,
    like Chilean miners, deep in the Hooting Yard archives, dusted them down, glued
    them together, and applied a lick o'' lacquer to freshen them up for a new readership.
    And in a promptly-posted comment, I preempt an objection that may be raised by
    pedants on the lookout for flaws in what is a piece of startling, even brutal,
    realism.'
