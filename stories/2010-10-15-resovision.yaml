  text: Unlikely as it may seem, the first--and quite probably only--edition of your
    favourite television show of all time, The Frank Key And Lepke B. Half-Hour will
    be broadcast live, yes live!, on ResoVision tomorrow (Saturday) at 2.30 PM UK
    time. Turn on, tune in, shovel snack foods down your gullet, furrow your brow,
    and concentrate. That is all I ask of you. God knows it is little enough, at least
    for the time being, pending inquiries, debriefings, further snacking opportunities,
    and hell freezing over.
