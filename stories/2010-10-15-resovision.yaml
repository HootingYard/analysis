  text: "Unlikely as it may seem, the first\u2014and quite probably only\u2014edition\
    \ of your favourite television show of all time, The Frank Key And Lepke B. Half-Hour\
    \ will be broadcast live, yes live!, on ResoVision tomorrow (Saturday) at 2.30\
    \ PM UK time. Turn on, tune in, shovel snack foods down your gullet, furrow your\
    \ brow, and concentrate. That is all I ask of you. God knows it is little enough,\
    \ at least for the time being, pending inquiries, debriefings, further snacking\
    \ opportunities, and hell freezing over."
