  text: 'The Defiant Ones lodged in a suite in a hotel at the foot of a tremendous
    mountain. There were several of them. It is impossible to be precise about their
    number, for, true to their name, they defied accurate counting. If you attempted
    to take a tally, you would discover that one had popped out to the post office,
    or was concealed behind an arras, or one was counted twice by being duplicated
    in a mirror, or by radically changing his appearance in the middle of the counting.
    And after all, did it really matter how many, or how few, they were, the Defiant
    Ones?

    It mattered to the major domo, who ran, as he liked to put it, "a tight hotel".
    Most people would have used the common phrase "a tight ship", but the major domo
    hated nautical metaphors, for reasons buried deep in his psyche, if he could be
    said to have a psyche, and whenever he was tempted to use one he plumped for hotel
    imagery instead. So he would say "worse things happen in hotels" rather than "worse
    things happen at sea", or refer to the "mamahotel" in place of "the mothership".
    Because of these verbal idiosyncracies, it was often said of him that he was born
    to the hotel business, even though in truth he was the progeny of death-defying
    circus acrobats. Was it their defiance of death that caused him to be so preoccupied
    with the Defiant Ones in the suite of the hotel?

    It cannot be said that death was among the things defied by the Defiant Ones,
    for on at least one occasion the problem of counting them accurately hinged upon
    the fact that one or more of them had died, and rapidly been encoffined and carted
    away to a burial ground. The major domo, or his proxy tallyman, was unable to
    match the number of dead Defiant Ones with the number of coffins seen delivered
    to the hotel, nor indeed with the number of coffins later carted away. O such
    perplexity!

    You would think a tallyman, employed by the hotel for the specific purpose of
    conducting counts and tallies, with no other duties to bother his big hairy head,
    could be relied upon to arrive at accurate numbers. And indeed, when counting
    rooms or corners in corridors or cutlery services or flower beds or types of blossom
    depicted upon wallpapers, the tallyman could not be faulted. He was even awarded
    bonuses. But the Defiant Ones, their numbers, and their coffins, defied him. This
    wreaked havoc with his sense of professional tallying worth, and for a time he
    took to drink. He might have ended in the gutter, were it not that his slide into
    degradation and debauch was halted by the major domo, by dint of persistent hectoring
    underscored by vivid hotel-related metaphors.

    "Imagine a hotel..." the major domo would begin, slapping the tallyman round the
    face, in a pantry or a cubby where the latter had taken refuge with a bottle of
    mother''s ruin. The metaphors came pouring out thick and fast, until the tallyman
    had sobered up, and could see in his mind''s eye a gorgeous and glorious hotel,
    perched on a promontory overlooking a glittering sea, a sea empty of shipping.

    In his turn, the major domo began to imagine his own hotel emptied of the Defiant
    Ones. How he wished they would leave! He gave instructions to the chambermaids
    to neglect cleaning the suite, but the Defiant Ones defied this ruse by doing
    their own cleaning. He had their breakfast sausages overcooked, or undercooked,
    or, in desperation, wholly absent from their plates, but they defied this by filling
    their bellies with extra kedgeree or kippers, obtained through machinations the
    major domo could never fathom, and his tallyman was helpless to prevent. He went
    so far as to devise a plot, Heliogabalus-like, to construct a false ceiling in
    their suite, with a view to smothering them under a cascade of roses and violets,
    but the Defiant Ones defied this by burning to a cinder every single florist''s
    shop for miles around.

    Those florists who had lived above their business premises, which was almost all
    of them, now took rooms in the hotel, and this was to prove the undoing of the
    Defiant Ones. Their acts of arson had been ingeniously disguised as Acts of God,
    and thus they were not viewed with suspicion by the newly-arrived florist hotel
    guests. Yet an equilibrium, unacknowledged but decisive, was upset. The tallyman,
    quite capable of taking accurate count of the florists, reported their numbers
    daily to the major domo. And though the Defiant Ones still defied counting, it
    became obvious even to the untrained eye that they were outnumbered by florists.
    How could they hope to defy this stark fact, except by recruiting further Defiant
    Ones to their uncountable band? But there were only so many beds, so many easy
    chairs, so much oxygen that could be crammed into their suite. Something the Defiant
    Ones could not defy, try as they might, were the physical laws which governed
    not just the hotel, but the universe itself.

    Though try they did. They all sat up one night, out on the balcony of their suite,
    by turns imploring the heavens and casting runes and conjuring Beelzebub to appear
    in a cloud of smoke and manoeuvring their arms in obscurely significant passing
    movements through the cold air. But in the morning, the balcony was the same balcony,
    the suite the same suite, the hotel absolutely the same hotel. At breakfast, there
    were no sausages to be had, though they saw the plates of the florists piled high
    with them. The Defiant Ones stuffed themselves with their mysteriously-obtained
    kippers and kedgeree and went clumping out of the breakfast room, making as much
    noise as possible, defiance etched on each of their defiant countenances. They
    hiked half way up the mountain, and took shelter in a bivouac from where they
    could look down upon the roof of the hotel, with its towers and chimneys and turrets.
    Sudden gusts of icy wind whipped in, but they defied them, staying where they
    were, huddling close together on the mountainside. Then, from above, from far
    above, a rumble of dislodged rocks. The Defiant Ones could not defy a mighty Alpine
    avalanche.

    The hotel, however, could. The major domo had seen to that. At the first stirrings
    of the rumbling rocks high above, he set the tallyman to count and count again
    the avalanche-protection devices, and he gathered the florists and all the other
    guests in the hotel ballroom, and he announced, in his surprisingly high and squeaky
    voice, "Imagine a hotel... a hotel that evaporates at the approach of tumbling
    rocks in an Alpine avalanche, and then the very same hotel, identical in every
    detail, comes shimmering into solid form, miles away, at the foot of a different,
    more stable mountain, and all around the fields are rife with blossoms, a riot
    of blossoms, ready for the plucking. Imagine that."

    And so they did, and so we do.'
