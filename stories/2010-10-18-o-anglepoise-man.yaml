  text: "(To the tune of O Tannenbaum, if you put some effort into it.)\nO Anglepoise\
    \ Man, toss me a bone, for I am famished and dressed in rags! They sent me to\
    \ Mudchute to jabber and keen, which was fine by me, I had no particular plans\
    \ for October. I travelled there by train, clutching a mittenful of coupons. Before\
    \ I arrived it occurred to me that I am a total irrelevance in the grand scheme\
    \ of things, as seen from the perspective of, say, a Mudchute magnifico. There\
    \ are plenty of magnificos in Mudchute, more than you might imagine, yes, you,\
    \ Anglepoise Man! My disembarkation from the train had something of the farce\
    \ about it. Rix would have approved. After I'd pulled up my trousers\u2014ragged,\
    \ ragged!\u2014I swept across the pavings towards my assignation. At this stage\
    \ I already wanted a bone upon which to gnaw, but there was no sign of you, nor\
    \ of any other superheroes. I could have had noodles, from Hong Fat Goon, but,\
    \ do you know what?, they were despicable noodles. So despicable, indeed, that\
    \ in comparison I took on an air of nobility. If I planted myself next to the\
    \ noodles, even in my rags and insignificance I would have shone brightly, like\
    \ young Apollo. But what sort of behaviour would that be? Foolish behaviour, that's\
    \ what. I took up my post at the jabbering and keening slab, put there by a paviour,\
    \ a proper Mudchute paviour. Did you know there are almost as many paviours as\
    \ magnificos? I didn't. But then I know very little about Mudchute, still. For\
    \ instance, I had absolutely no idea it was your spiritual home, Anglepoise Man.\
    \ I always thought you hailed from somewhere far away, even mythical, Zembla or\
    \ Gondwanaland. Nobody ever asked me to keen and jabber there, in either of them,\
    \ in October or any other month, in spite of my clutch of coupons. My mittens\
    \ are the only part of my apparel that are not rags. They were donated to me by\
    \ a benefactor. He bore a striking resemblance to you, Anglepoise Man. Perhaps\
    \ he is your brother, or one of your dozens of cousins? He gave me mittens instead\
    \ of the bone I wanted. Wanted? Yearned for! O to yearn for a bone! What am I\
    \ become? Irrelevant, insignificant, surely. At least I may buff my shrivelled\
    \ sense of self with the knowledge that I am not as despicable as the noodles.\
    \ Not yet."
