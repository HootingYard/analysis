  text: "\u201CThese noodles are despicable!\u201D shouted the priest.\nHe was glaring\
    \ at the bowl set before him, his eyes glistening like globs of molten fire. Or\
    \ rather, his eye, for he had just the one. He had plucked out its twin, years\
    \ ago, in an act of penitence for sins as despicable as his noodles.\n\u201CThey\
    \ are the last noodles in the monastery pantry, Father,\u201D said the monk.\n\
    \u201CI am a Monsignor!\u201D shouted the priest, \u201CAnd you will address me\
    \ as Your Magnificence!\u201D\nHe was a very shouty Monsignor.\n\u201CForgive\
    \ me, Monsignor, but I do not think that is the correct form of address for your\
    \ station within the hierarchy of the Church,\u201D said the monk. Deftly, he\
    \ placed a pair of chopsticks next to the bowl. \u201CNow eat up before your noodles\
    \ go cold.\u201D\nThe Monsignor's eye burned with even greater ferocity and he\
    \ banged his fist upon the table. He had only the one fist, for the arm to which\
    \ its twin had once formed the extremity had been ripped from its socket, years\
    \ ago, in an agricultural mishap.\n\u201CCold and despicable noodles!\u201D he\
    \ shouted, \u201CIs this how you welcome My Magnificence to your shabby abbey?\u201D\
    \n\u201CThis is a monastery rather than an abbey, Monsignor,\u201D replied the\
    \ monk, tucking a bib of golden cloth under his superior's chin, \u201CAnd though\
    \ the shabbiness of its fabric is unarguable, our souls are pure, or at least\
    \ as pure as constant and hysterical prayer can make them.\u201D\nThe Monsignor\
    \ swept the bowl aside with his one forearm, and it clattered to the floor, strewing\
    \ the noodles all kim kam. The bowl did not break, for it was made of tin.\n\u201C\
    Bring me better noodles!\u201D he shouted, \u201CAnd serve them in a ceramic bowl!\u201D\
    \n\u201CI am afraid I cannot accede to your request,\u201D said the monk, \u201C\
    For as I have explained, these noodles were the last in the pantry, and our stocks\
    \ are now exhausted. As for the bowl, it has perhaps escaped your Monsignorial\
    \ notice that we are a tinny monastery, and quite, quite potless.\u201D\nAs he\
    \ spoke, the monk used a broom to sweep the strewn noodles back into the bowl,\
    \ which he replaced in front of the Monsignor.\n\u201CThere,\u201D he said, or\
    \ cooed, \u201CNo harm done. Tuck in.\u201D\nThe monk was going to add a jaunty\
    \ remark about mishaps in a monastery refectory being far less traumatic than\
    \ agricultural mishaps, comparing the circumstances and ramifications of both,\
    \ but before he could do so the Monsignor started shouting again.\n\u201CWhat\
    \ filth has been commingled with these noodles as you swept them back into the\
    \ bowl from your refectory floor?\u201D he roared, with such titanic rage that\
    \ his whole body trembled and the bib of golden cloth came loose. The monk gently\
    \ tucked it back into place.\n\u201CI grant there is filth on our floor, Monsignor,\
    \ but rest assured it is mild filth, the odd pock of dust and perhaps a few million\
    \ harmless bacteria. Who knows, they may add a certain piquancy to your noodles.\u201D\
    \nThe Monsignor's countenance, already florid, now took on the tint we imagine\
    \ a painter might use to depict the fires of hell.\n\u201CThese noodles were despicable\
    \ when first you set them before me!\u201D he shouted, \u201CAnd now they are\
    \ doubly despicable! You have the gall to make My Magnificence feed on dust and\
    \ bacteria as well?\u201D\n\u201CMonsignor,\u201D said the monk, his patience\
    \ almost inhuman, \u201CThere are paupers in the hovels surrounding our monastery\
    \ who would happily lick that tin bowl clean. Might I suggest you take off all\
    \ those bright-bejewelled rings on your fingers the better to manipulate the chopsticks?\u201D\
    \n\u201CSpeak not to me of paupers!\u201D boomed the Monsignor, \u201CI swept\
    \ past their hovels astride my horse on my way here! Had I still a second arm\
    \ I would have used it to cut them down with a mighty Monsignorial sword!\u201D\
    \n\u201CAll well and good if it please you,\u201D said the monk, \u201CBut slaughtering\
    \ paupers, even in thought only, is hungry work, as many a baron and brigand can\
    \ attest, so you really ought to gobble up those noodles while they're lukewarm.\u201D\
    \n\u201CWhere are all the other monks?\u201D shouted the Monsignor, changing the\
    \ subject suddenly, to distract attention from the fact that now he began sliding\
    \ the bright-bejewelled rings off his fingers using his teeth, prepatory to picking\
    \ up the chopsticks and eating the contents of his tin bowl. His hunger had defeated\
    \ his pride.\n\u201CDon't you worry your little head about them,\u201D said the\
    \ monk. It was his first error, in this battle of wits to force the bowl of noodles\
    \ and dust and bacteria down the Monsignor's gob. If there was one thing the Monsignor\
    \ was sensitive about, to the point of psychosis, it was the size of his head.\
    \ Once, it had been of average adult human head dimension, but following a missionary-among-jungle-tribesmen\
    \ mishap, years ago, it had been shrunk to the size of a potato. A bigger than\
    \ average potato, but a potato nevertheless.\nOnce again sending the bowl clattering\
    \ across the floor with a sweep of his forearm, the Monsignor rose from his stool\
    \ and clumped out of the refectory on his crutches, shouting incoherent imprecations\
    \ as he went. Outside, in the rain, his tubercular yet elegant horse was waiting.\
    \ He mounted it, slotted his crutches into the panniers, and hi-ho'ed away, towards\
    \ a different monastery, surrounded by different hovels, where he hoped to be\
    \ fed less despicable noodles.\nIn his tantrum, he had forgotten to retrieve his\
    \ bright-bejewelled rings. The monk gathered them from the table, and later that\
    \ day, when it had ceased to rain, he squelched out into the muck and distributed\
    \ them among the paupers, first insisting that they kneel down and pray, constantly,\
    \ hysterically, and at so high a pitch of frenzy that miles away, sitting down\
    \ to a supper of picable noodles in the refectory of a nunnery, the Monsignor\
    \ thought he could hear the shrieking of the damned. It was a din that delighted\
    \ him. As he swallowed the last noodle from his ceramic bowl, he grinned, a grin\
    \ somehow wider than his tiny head allowed, and so terrifying that the nun who\
    \ served him his noodles swooned."
