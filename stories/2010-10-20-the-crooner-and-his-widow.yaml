  text: Crooner Bong Crisby went widdershins round the kirk. Three times he did it,
    in fog, mist, and murk. He had not read his M R James, or so his weeping widow
    claims. He vanished off the earth and has no tomb. I hear his golden crooning
    in my living room. It issues from the walls, all day and all night, crooning,
    pleading for his widow's mite.
