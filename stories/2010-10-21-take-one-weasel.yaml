  text: "Here is a simple method of grasping a weasel by the scruff of its neck, hypnotising\
    \ it, and having it do your bidding.\n1. Take one weasel.\n2. Grasp the weasel\
    \ by the scruff of its neck and hold it so that its head is no more than a couple\
    \ of inches from your eyes.\n3. Stare into the eyes of the weasel while making\
    \ hypnotic weaselly noises.\n4.\_Place the weasel carefully on your floor and\
    \ issue it with a command.\n5. When the weasel returns from its mission, pick\
    \ it up by the scruff of the neck, and repeat step 3, substituting hypnotic weaselly\
    \ noises with antihypnotic weaselly noises.\n6. Release the weasel.\nWhat could\
    \ be simpler than that? Indeed, the only difficulty most students find is to think\
    \ up a suitable command for the hypnotised weasel to obey. Experience shows that\
    \ tasks involving high-pitched squealing and savagery are likely to achieve the\
    \ best results. If you are of a squeamish disposition, command the weasel to do\
    \ its slashing and slaughtering in another room, or even outside, in your front\
    \ garden, if you have a front garden. Try to remember that weasels will attack\
    \ most effectively if set upon organisms of equal size, or smaller than themselves,\
    \ although in certain circumstances they can prove lethal and terrifying pitted\
    \ against larger beings, particularly if such beings are tethered to a stout post.\n\
    Advanced students may wish to attempt the grasping, hypnotising, and commanding\
    \ of more than one weasel at a time.\nEven more advanced students can omit steps\
    \ 5 and 6, and maintain a pack of hypnotised weasels primed and ready to do their\
    \ bidding in perpetuity, or until the weasels die."
