  text: '"An interesting, though rather detestable, creature called the ant-lion is
    found in some of the bestiaries of the Middle Ages... The ant-lion was so called
    because of its size, since ''while to other animals it is only an ant, to ants
    themselves it is as if it were a lion''.

    "As an instance of the implicit credulity of the Middle Ages witness this account
    of the ant-lion given in the Physiologus. This states that the ant-lion''s father
    was shaped like a lion and his mother like an ant. The father was a flesh-eater;
    its mother herbivorous. When these two had issue, this was the ant-lion, partaking
    of the features of its parents, its forepart being that of a lion and its hindquarters
    like an ant. Being thus composed the wretched insect could neither eat flesh like
    its father nor herbs like its mother, and so it starved to death!"

    Colin Clair, Unnatural History : An Illustrated Bestiary (1967). Alas, the ant-lion
    is not illustrated in the book, and nor is the gigantic gold-digging pismire,
    with which it shares a chapter.'
