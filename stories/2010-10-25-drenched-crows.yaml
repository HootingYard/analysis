  text: I squelched across the marsh, in driving rain, and linnets sang within my
    brain. There were no linnets to be seen, just crows, drenched crows, drenched
    crows. I lit my pipe and sucked, and heard the caw of a drenched crow. The rain
    was pelting down as I made my slopping way from marsh to town. And in the town,
    no linnets, no, nor crows. Just shuttered kiosks and the stadium. An athlete threw
    his javelin in the air. I watched it soar then stab the sodden grass. I went to
    the canteen. An arty print of crows hung on the wall. I slurped a bowl of steaming
    warming broth, and then I caught a bus back to the marsh.
