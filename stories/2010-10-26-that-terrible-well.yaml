  text: "\nOne has to ask\_: did Ambrose Bierce grow up on Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard,\
    \ or an eerily exact replica of it? \u201CThe Old Oaken Bucket\u201D\u2014published\
    \ \_in The Wasp, 3rd November 1883\u2014begins thus:\nWith what anguish of mind\
    \ I remember my childhood Recalled in the light of knowledge since gained, The\
    \ malarious farm, the wet, fungus-grown wildwood, The chills then contracted that\
    \ since have remained; The scum-covered duck pond, the pigsty close by it, The\
    \ ditch where the sour-smelling house drainage fell, The damp, shaded dwelling,\
    \ the foul barnyard nigh it\u2014But worse than all else was that terrible well,\
    \ And the old oaken bucket, the mould-crusted bucket, That moss-covered bucket\
    \ that hung in the well."
