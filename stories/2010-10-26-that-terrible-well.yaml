    One has to ask : did Ambrose Bierce grow up on Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard, or an
    eerily exact replica of it? "The Old Oaken Bucket"--published  in The Wasp, 3rd
    November 1883--begins thus:

    With what anguish of mind I remember my childhood Recalled in the light of knowledge
    since gained, The malarious farm, the wet, fungus-grown wildwood, The chills then
    contracted that since have remained; The scum-covered duck pond, the pigsty close
    by it, The ditch where the sour-smelling house drainage fell, The damp, shaded
    dwelling, the foul barnyard nigh it--But worse than all else was that terrible
    well, And the old oaken bucket, the mould-crusted bucket, That moss-covered bucket
    that hung in the well.'
