  text: 'Many years ago, I wrote a story based upon an alphabetic structure, called
    Abandoned Zoo. Yet I could so easily have used the title Alpine Zombie to achieve
    the same narrative ends. Whereas Abandoned Zoo was about an abandoned zoo, Alpine
    Zombie, had it ever been written, would have been about a zombie in the Alps.
    The mood, rather than being one of misty melancholy--and as I recall, there was
    much mist in Abandoned Zoo--would have been closer to terror, as the zombie stalked
    denizens of the Alps such as goatherds and yodelling Edelweiss-pickers. I might
    even have arranged for a walk-on part for Captain Von Trapp, memorably played
    by Christopher Plummer in the film version of The Sound Of Music. How would the
    Austrian martinet have dealt with a threatening zombie? The cold imperious contempt
    with which he faced the Nazis would not, I''ll wager, suffice to cow a great lumbering
    glassy-eyed member of the living dead community, as I suppose we should call them
    nowadays. I have not read enough of the literature to know if a zombie can be
    stopped in its tracks by a person brandishing an acoustic guitar, gathering around
    him an ex-nun and several tinies, and launching into an Alpine songlet. It would
    be a tactic worth trying at least once, and that could be made the central incident
    at the heart of the story called Alpine Zombie.

    Given that the central figure in the tale would be a monster of the mountains,
    my prose would have to glisten with sufficiently bright clarity to ensure the
    reader did not mistake the zombie for a Himalayan Yeti. Inserting the  proper
    names of a number of notable Alpine peaks would help to pin our yarn to its geographical
    cushion. Their deployment within the text could follow an alphabetic schema to
    enhance the A to Z superstructure of our story. Thus, the zombie could pursue
    Captain Von Trapp from Alphubel to Zinalrothorn, taking in, say, Bluemlisalp and
    Care Alto and Dom and Eiger and Finsteraarhorn and Grimming and Hochgall and so
    on and so forth along the way. So haphazard and incoherent a journey may make
    no sense, but in dizzying the brains of both the reader and Captain Von Trapp
    himself, it would no doubt add to the terror of the tale.

    It would probably be a good idea to have the ex-nun and the tinies also menaced
    by zombies, perhaps while cowering in a chalet.'
