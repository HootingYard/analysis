  text: 'I am not a frequent flier, so it may be some while before I can take advantage
    of this excellent service. However, next time I am summoned to an important Hooting
    Yard-related international conference, I shall insist that my all-expenses-paid
    trip is made via Henri Lehmann Airlines. Satisfied customer Saint Catherine of
    Alexandria chirrups: "My flight was so comfortable it was almost as if angels
    were transporting me to my dedicated monastery at Mount Sinai after a foolhardy
    attempt by bad, bad heathens to have me broken on the wheel".
