  text: '"It has been observed that in their treatment of the Western frontier Bret
    Harte made the prevalent contempt for the law picturesque and Mark Twain found
    it humorous, but Ambrose Bierce labeled it for what it was--murder, armed robbery,
    assault with intent to kill. His occasional essays into Western crime were as
    bluntly stated as a police blotter: no chivalrous gamblers, just cardsharks; no
    courtly gunfighters, just homicidal psychopaths; no golden-hearted dancehall girls,
    just pathetic whores; no gallant soldiers nor stouthearted pioneers, just men
    on the government payroll bored by routine and farmers looking for a better piece
    of land. The Western legend was, to use his favourite word, bosh."
