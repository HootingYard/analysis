  text: 'Another snippet from Richard O''Connor''s 1967 biography of Ambrose Bierce:

    "The book-reviewing end of his chores, predictably, loosed [Bierce''s] most savage
    energies... He once composed what may be the shortest, nastiest book review on
    the record by listing its title, author and publisher and adding the one-line
    comment, ''The covers of this book are too far apart''.

    "Occasionally, like an eagle swooping down on the carrion-littered plains of literature,
    he would quote one paragraph of a current novel as an example of hopelessly bad
    writing. Such as : ''She remained inactive in his embrace for a considerable period,
    then modestly disengaging herself looked him full in the countenance and signified
    a desire for self-communion. By love''s instinct he divined her purpose--she wanted
    to consider his proposal apart from the influence of the glamour of his personal
    presence. With the innate tact of a truly genteel nature he bade her good evening
    in French, and with measured tread paced away into the gathering gloom''."

    Alas, we are not told the titles of the two books under review.'
