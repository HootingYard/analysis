  text: "Another snippet from Richard O'Connor's 1967 biography of Ambrose Bierce:\n\
    \u201CThe book-reviewing end of his chores, predictably, loosed [Bierce's] most\
    \ savage energies\u2026 He once composed what may be the shortest, nastiest book\
    \ review on the record by listing its title, author and publisher and adding the\
    \ one-line comment, \u2018The covers of this book are too far apart\u2019.\n\u201C\
    Occasionally, like an eagle swooping down on the carrion-littered plains of literature,\
    \ he would quote one paragraph of a current novel as an example of hopelessly\
    \ bad writing. Such as\_: \u2018She remained inactive in his embrace for a considerable\
    \ period, then modestly disengaging herself looked him full in the countenance\
    \ and signified a desire for self-communion. By love's instinct he divined her\
    \ purpose\u2014she wanted to consider his proposal apart from the influence of\
    \ the glamour of his personal presence. With the innate tact of a truly genteel\
    \ nature he bade her good evening in French, and with measured tread paced away\
    \ into the gathering gloom\u2019.\u201D\nAlas, we are not told the titles of the\
    \ two books under review."
