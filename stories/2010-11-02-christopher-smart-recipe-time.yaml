  text: 'At Mustard Plaster, a splendid recipe for bubble and squeak by Christopher
    Smart:

    "Take of Beef, Mutton, or Lamb, or Veal, or any other meat, two Pounds and an
    half, or any other Quantity; let it lay in Salt, till the saline Particles have
    lock''d up all the Juices of the Animal, and render''d the Fibres too hard to
    be digested; then boil it over a Turf or Peat Fire, in a Brass Kettle cover''d
    with a Copper Lid, till it is much done. Then take Cabbage (that which is most
    windy, and capable of producing the greatest Report) and boil it in a Bell-Metal
    Pot till it is done enough, or if you think it proper, till it is done too much.
    Then slice the beef, and souse that and the Cabbage both in a Frying-Pan together,
    and let it bubble and squeak over a Charcoal Fire, for half an Hour, three Minutes,
    and two Seconds. Then eat a Quantum sufficit, or two Pounds and a half, and after
    it drink sixteen Pints of fat Ale, smoak, sleep, snoar, belch, and forget your
    Book."'
