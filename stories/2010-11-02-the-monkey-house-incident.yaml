  text: "Scene One. The Monkey House at Central Park Zoo, New York, on\_ the 16th\
    \ November 1906. A FOREIGN GENT and a RESPECTABLE LADY are standing by the cage\
    \ of KNOCKO THE MONKEY.\nFOREIGN GENT\_: Good morning, madam.\nRESPECTABLE LADY\
    \ (Turning to look at him)\_: Why sir, you are like unto a sun god! Your light\
    \ obliterates your surroundings! But do you always keep your hands in your overcoat\
    \ pockets when addressing a respectable lady?\nThe FOREIGN GENT moves towards\
    \ the RESPECTABLE LADY and \u201Cannoys\u201D her. Or possibly not.\nEnter the\
    \ NEW YORK COP.\nNEW YORK COP\_: (To the FOREIGN GENT)\_: I've had my eye on you,\
    \ chum. You're under arrest!\nKNOCKO THE MONKEY looks on, while monkeying about\
    \ in his cage.\n\nScene Two. The police cells, later that day. The FOREIGN GENT\
    \ is weeping loudly.\nEnter HEINRICH CONREID, Director of the New York Metropolitan\
    \ Opera.\nFOREIGN GENT (Still weeping)\_: Thank heaven you have come!\nHEINRICH\
    \ CONREID\_: Don't you worry about a thing. I have posted bail. Do you think for\
    \ one minute I would allow Enrico Caruso, the finest Italian tenor of them all,\
    \ to languish in prison?\n\nScene Three. The courtroom, a week later.\nPROSECUTING\
    \ COUNSEL\_: Tell us what happened, officer.\nNEW YORK COP\_: This foreign gent\
    \ was \u201Cannoying\u201D several women and girls in full view of Knocko The\
    \ Monkey in the Monkey House. He has slits in the pockets of his overcoat. Enrico\
    \ Caruso, that is, not Knocko.\nPROSECUTING COUNSEL\_: It is because of the crowd\
    \ of moral perverts and dogs and curs out there in the courtroom who come here\
    \ to listen\u2026 Our mothers and our sisters are not safe in the streets; they\
    \ cannot go about without being subjected to insult by this scum from the lazaretto\
    \ of Naples.\nJUDGE\_: (To the FOREIGN GENT, who is indeed famous tenor Enrico\
    \ Caruso)\_: Guilty as charged. I fine you ten dollars.\n\nScene Four. The Fire\
    \ Station, later.\nALFRED M DOWNES (Thinking aloud)\_: This monkey house incident\
    \ and the subsequent legal palaver has stirred public interest in Knocko The Monkey.\
    \ He may have been one of the monkeys kept as mascots by the Fire Department until\
    \ their disruptive antics meant they had to be removed to the zoo. I think I will\
    \ take advantage of the brouhaha and write a book called Firefighters And Their\
    \ Pets. It should be ready for publication by next year.\nCurtain.\nFurther reading\
    \ at The Believer."
