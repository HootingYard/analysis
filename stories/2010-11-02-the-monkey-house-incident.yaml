  text: 'Scene One. The Monkey House at Central Park Zoo, New York, on  the 16th November
    1906. A FOREIGN GENT and a RESPECTABLE LADY are standing by the cage of KNOCKO
    THE MONKEY.

    FOREIGN GENT : Good morning, madam.

    RESPECTABLE LADY (Turning to look at him) : Why sir, you are like unto a sun god!
    Your light obliterates your surroundings! But do you always keep your hands in
    your overcoat pockets when addressing a respectable lady?

    The FOREIGN GENT moves towards the RESPECTABLE LADY and "annoys" her. Or possibly
    not.

    Enter the NEW YORK COP.

    NEW YORK COP : (To the FOREIGN GENT) : I''ve had my eye on you, chum. You''re
    under arrest!

    KNOCKO THE MONKEY looks on, while monkeying about in his cage.


    Scene Two. The police cells, later that day. The FOREIGN GENT is weeping loudly.

    Enter HEINRICH CONREID, Director of the New York Metropolitan Opera.

    FOREIGN GENT (Still weeping) : Thank heaven you have come!

    HEINRICH CONREID : Don''t you worry about a thing. I have posted bail. Do you
    think for one minute I would allow Enrico Caruso, the finest Italian tenor of
    them all, to languish in prison?


    Scene Three. The courtroom, a week later.

    PROSECUTING COUNSEL : Tell us what happened, officer.

    NEW YORK COP : This foreign gent was "annoying" several women and girls in full
    view of Knocko The Monkey in the Monkey House. He has slits in the pockets of
    his overcoat. Enrico Caruso, that is, not Knocko.

    PROSECUTING COUNSEL : It is because of the crowd of moral perverts and dogs and
    curs out there in the courtroom who come here to listen... Our mothers and our
    sisters are not safe in the streets; they cannot go about without being subjected
    to insult by this scum from the lazaretto of Naples.

    JUDGE : (To the FOREIGN GENT, who is indeed famous tenor Enrico Caruso) : Guilty
    as charged. I fine you ten dollars.


    Scene Four. The Fire Station, later.

    ALFRED M DOWNES (Thinking aloud) : This monkey house incident and the subsequent
    legal palaver has stirred public interest in Knocko The Monkey. He may have been
    one of the monkeys kept as mascots by the Fire Department until their disruptive
    antics meant they had to be removed to the zoo. I think I will take advantage
    of the brouhaha and write a book called Firefighters And Their Pets. It should
    be ready for publication by next year.
