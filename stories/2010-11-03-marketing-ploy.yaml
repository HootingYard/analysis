    In 1922, Charles Ives self-published his collection of 114 songs. Now, almost
    one hundred years later, Mr Key has self-published a collection of 114 stories.
    Yes, at last, wrenched from the innermost core of his creative innards, Impugned
    By A Peasant & Other Stories is available for you to buy, to fawn over, to stroke
    tenderly with your fingertips just like Christopher Plummer as Atahualpa in The
    Royal Hunt Of The Sun, in dazzling sunlight, strokes the Holy Bible. Or you may
    prefer to keep your copy locked away in a lead-lined cabinet, submerged in a pit,
    cordoned off by an electric fence patrolled by wolves and hogs. It''s up to you,
    really. The important thing is that you buy as many copies of the book as a sensible
    person would, what with Christmas coming up, and all those birthdays and anniversaries
    and saints'' feast days on which you will want to present your nearest and dearest
    with a treasurable gift. So get with the programme, readers, and hike over to
    Lulu at once to make your purchase!'
