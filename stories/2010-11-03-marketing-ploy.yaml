  text: "\nIn 1922, Charles Ives self-published his collection of 114 songs. Now,\
    \ almost one hundred years later, Mr Key has self-published a collection of 114\
    \ stories. Yes, at last, wrenched from the innermost core of his creative innards,\
    \ Impugned By A Peasant & Other Stories is available for you to buy, to fawn over,\
    \ to stroke tenderly with your fingertips just like Christopher Plummer as Atahualpa\
    \ in The Royal Hunt Of The Sun, in dazzling sunlight, strokes the Holy Bible.\
    \ Or you may prefer to keep your copy locked away in a lead-lined cabinet, submerged\
    \ in a pit, cordoned off by an electric fence patrolled by wolves and hogs. It's\
    \ up to you, really. The important thing is that you buy as many copies of the\
    \ book as a sensible person would, what with Christmas coming up, and all those\
    \ birthdays and anniversaries and saints\u2019 feast days on which you will want\
    \ to present your nearest and dearest with a treasurable gift. So get with the\
    \ programme, readers, and hike over to Lulu at once to make your purchase!"
