text: "Readers who keep track of these things will know that I am fond of Horace Walpole's\
  \ coinage \u201Cbewolfenbuttlement\u201D, recently noted in my cupboard at The Dabbler.\
  \ I have today learned that Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, that great figure of the Enlightenment,\
  \ was for some years the librarian at the Herzog-August-Bibliothek in Wolfenb\xFC\
  ttel. In the 1770s, he published, anonymously, the Wolfenb\xFCttel Fragments, essays\
  \ by the (deceased) Professor of Oriental Languages at Hamburg, Reimarus, questioning\
  \ the status of miracles recounted in the Bible.\nHis skepticism in this regard\
  \ means Lessing is one of the few European thinkers who has a ditch named after\
  \ him. It is an ugly, broad ditch, but, disappointingly, is a theoretical ditch\
  \ rather than a real one.\nHe also had an interestingly egg-shaped head.\n"
