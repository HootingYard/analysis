  text: "Readers who keep track of these things will know that I am fond of Horace\
    \ Walpole's coinage \u201Cbewolfenbuttlement\u201D, recently noted in my cupboard\
    \ at The Dabbler. I have today learned that Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, that great\
    \ figure of the Enlightenment, was for some years the librarian at the Herzog-August-Bibliothek\
    \ in Wolfenb\xFCttel. In the 1770s, he published, anonymously, the Wolfenb\xFC\
    ttel Fragments, essays by the (deceased) Professor of Oriental Languages at Hamburg,\
    \ Reimarus, questioning the status of miracles recounted in the Bible.\nHis skepticism\
    \ in this regard means Lessing is one of the few European thinkers who has a ditch\
    \ named after him. It is an ugly, broad ditch, but, disappointingly, is a theoretical\
    \ ditch rather than a real one.\nHe also had an interestingly egg-shaped head.\n"
