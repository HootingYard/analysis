  text: "I am having one of my occasional bursts of activity on Facecloth, the social\
    \ networking site. Temperamentally, a Diogenesian recluse such as myself would\
    \ be better suited to an antisocial network, but needs must when the devil drives,\
    \ as they say. Yesterday I posted on Facecloth a snippet which fits neatly into\
    \ the Hooting Yard \u201CThings I Have Learned\u201D category, and it elicited\
    \ a couple of comments in reply which are worth sharing with a wider audience.\n\
    I learned, from Peter Ackroyd's new book The English Ghost\_: Spectres Through\
    \ Time, (and I quote from my paraphrase at Facecloth):\nOn Christmas Day 1716,\
    \ Samuel Wesley (father of John Wesley) was haunted by an apparition of \u201C\
    a badger, with no head\u201D. It was called Jeffrey.\nThis is something I am very,\
    \ very glad to know, and I doubt that a Yuletide will pass in future without me\
    \ mentioning it.\nBob Drake replied, saying \u201CThat got me thinking. Would\
    \ I rather be haunted by a badger's disembodied head, or a badger's headless body?\
    \ I can only conclude that it would depend on the temperament of the partial apparition\u201D\
    , while Roland Clare picked up the echo of Jubilate Agno, and suggested: \u201C\
    For I Will Consider My Headless Badger Jeffrey \u2026\u201D\nIt is my fond hope\
    \ that Mr Drake will be inspired to write a song on the subject, and Mr Clare\
    \ will essay a badgerised version of the pertinent section of Christopher Smart's\
    \ poem."
