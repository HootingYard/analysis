  text: 'I am having one of my occasional bursts of activity on Facecloth, the social
    networking site. Temperamentally, a Diogenesian recluse such as myself would be
    better suited to an antisocial network, but needs must when the devil drives,
    as they say. Yesterday I posted on Facecloth a snippet which fits neatly into
    the Hooting Yard "Things I Have Learned" category, and it elicited a couple of
    comments in reply which are worth sharing with a wider audience.

    I learned, from Peter Ackroyd''s new book The English Ghost : Spectres Through
    Time, (and I quote from my paraphrase at Facecloth):

    On Christmas Day 1716, Samuel Wesley (father of John Wesley) was haunted by an
    apparition of "a badger, with no head". It was called Jeffrey.

    This is something I am very, very glad to know, and I doubt that a Yuletide will
    pass in future without me mentioning it.

    Bob Drake replied, saying "That got me thinking. Would I rather be haunted by
    a badger''s disembodied head, or a badger''s headless body? I can only conclude
    that it would depend on the temperament of the partial apparition", while Roland
    Clare picked up the echo of Jubilate Agno, and suggested: "For I Will Consider
    My Headless Badger Jeffrey ..."

    It is my fond hope that Mr Drake will be inspired to write a song on the subject,
    and Mr Clare will essay a badgerised version of the pertinent section of Christopher
    Smart''s poem.'
