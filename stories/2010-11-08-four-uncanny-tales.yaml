  text: "Here are four stories, each of a hundred words. Earlier versions, a little\
    \ shorter or longer, can be dug out from the Archives should you care to look.\n\
    I\nI was sitting on a bench in a bower on a bright summer's day. It was a Wednesday,\
    \ or possibly a Thursday, in August, in the year after the Kennedy assassination,\
    \ far far away in Dallas, and the air was heady with verbena, and hollyhock. I\
    \ was eating my snack. All of a sudden, gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling\
    \ extraterrestrial hideousness began oozing from my marmalade and fish-head sandwich,\
    \ and I swooned. When I came to, I had a tiny radio transmitter implanted in my\
    \ forehead, but I remained unaware of it for the rest of my sordid and sorry life.\n\
    II\nThey called him Blomqvist, and he was the village wrestler. He lived in a\
    \ room above the post office. No other living being ever set foot in the room\
    \ until the day Blomqvist died. They found him lying on his bed, as if he were\
    \ asleep, but there was no doubt that he was dead, for hovering above his chest\
    \ was a baleful phantom, emitting gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial\
    \ hideousness which it poured into a funnel inserted into Blomqvist's right ear.\
    \ They closed up the room and nailed the door shut. It remained unopened for the\
    \ next hundred years.\nIII\nThe bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what\
    \ caught the attention of Jarvis, the bird scientist.\n\u201CLook, there is a\
    \ bird on the bell tower,\u201D he said to his pneumonia-racked assistant Cubbit,\
    \ who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips.\nJarvis pointed\
    \ at the bird, expecting Cubbit to look, but the spindly youth was distracted\
    \ by a passing pantechnicon all a-clatter with pots and pans. It was the neighbourhood\
    \ Windy Man, on his rounds, and spookily, sitting next to him in the passenger\
    \ seat, was a hideous extraterrestrial being, suppurating, greasy and malevolent.\n\
    IV\n\u201CHand me that chaffinch, Cubbit,\u201D said Jarvis to his lantern-jawed\
    \ assistant. Jarvis was a bird scientist, devoted to the study of chaffinches.\
    \ Wandering the hills, he had spotted one. As Cubbit picked up the chaffinch,\
    \ he heard a scream. Spinning round, he saw Jarvis being engulfed by a gruesome\
    \ suppurating monster. The poor lad scampered back to the lab and told what had\
    \ happened to Mrs Purgative.\n\u201CWell! I never heard of such a thing!\u201D\
    \ she exclaimed. She hoisted her mop on her shoulder, took Cubbit by his withered\
    \ hand, and led him far away, all the way to Gondwanaland."
