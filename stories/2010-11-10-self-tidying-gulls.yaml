  text: "Last week we looked at self-tidying swans, and we can now extend our ornithological\
    \ researches courtesy of Johnny Seven. Mr Seven, incidentally, is a man to whom\
    \ you should be profoundly thankful. Not only does he present the excellent \u201C\
    Pull The Plug\u201D show on ResonanceFM, but he is currently the sound engineer\
    \ charged with making sure Mr Key's dulcet tones are transmitted into your ears\
    \ every week.\nLong, long ago, in the last century, Johnny snapped a gang of self-tidying\
    \ seagulls. He writes: \u201CTaken on Tuesday 10th December 1984 (I know this\
    \ since it's written on the back of the photographs), I was interested in the\
    \ slate-grey blanket of fog shrouding the trees on the embankment in Putney. No\
    \ sooner had I set up the tripod than the hungry birds came (picture no.1). See\
    \ their expectant little faces. Imagine their disappointment when croutons were\
    \ not scattered. I moved further back to get a wider (and, to be honest, less\
    \ pleasingly composed) view, and the gulls moved further up the railing toward\
    \ me, increasing in number (picture no.2, and detail).\u201D\n\n\n\nYou will note\
    \ that, unlike the self-tidying swans, these self-tidying gulls are not accompanied\
    \ by an equal number of water gulls. This is due to their choice of emperchment,\
    \ upon railings, if, indeed, it was a conscious choice. Who can say what weird\
    \ shenanigans occur in the tiny brains of birds? One thing we can be sure of is\
    \ that they know how to line up very neatly, with the precision for which self-tidying\
    \ gulls are applauded, in some circles."
