  text: "\nGritty historical realism in Key's Cupboard at The Dabbler this week, where\
    \ I present a reconstruction, based upon impeccable source material, of an episode\
    \ in the life of Franz Liszt. The reader is transported, as if by magic, to nineteenth-century\
    \ Rome, and an assignation between the newly-ordained Abb\xE9 Liszt and his Russian-born\
    \ lover, Princess Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein\u2026"
