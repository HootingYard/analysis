  text: 'Here is a sound recording of what will come to be known as "the legendary
    Jellyfish session", when Lepke B. and I performed at the now-demolished theatre
    in October. In the accompanying snap, Lepke is but an orange blur, but this is
    hardly surprising given the dizzying physical manoeuvres he adopts when plying
    his art. The voice you hear introducing us is the Benevolent Dictator of ResonanceFM,
    Ed Baxter (as featured in The Independent On Sunday Happy List 2009).
