  text: '"The habit is now confirmed in me of spending the greater part of the day
    in sleep, while by night I wander far and wide through the city under the sedative
    influence of a tincture which has become necessary to my life. Such an existence
    of shadow is not without charm; nor, I think, could many minds be steadily subjected
    to its conditions without elevation, deepened awe. To travel alone with the Primordial
    cannot but be solemn. The moon is of the hue of the glow-worm; and Night of the
    sepulchre. Nux bore not less Thanatos than Hupnos, and the bitter tears of Isis
    redundulate to a flood. At three, if a cab rolls by, the sound has the augustness
    of thunder. Once, at two, near a corner, I came upon a priest, seated, dead, leering,
    his legs bent. One arm, supported on a knee, pointed with rigid accusing forefinger
    obliquely upward. By exact observation, I found that he indicated Betelgeux, the
    star "a" which shoulders the wet sword of Orion. He was hideously swollen, having
    perished of dropsy. Thus in all Supremes is a grotesquerie; and one of the sons
    of Night is--Buffo."
