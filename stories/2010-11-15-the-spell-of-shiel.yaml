  text: 'It is rather quiet at Hooting Yard at the moment. Partly this is because
    I am recovering from the ague which felled me last week, and partly, I think,
    because I am reading a stout collection of short stories by M P Shiel. It is two
    decades since I last immersed myself in the works of that master of purple prose,
    but I am a sensible person, and, as Rebecca West so wisely said, "Sensible people
    ought to have a complete set of Shiel". I do not own such a set, but that may
    be a small mercy. Reading Shiel may not exactly fuddle the brain, but I must be
    very careful not to try to imitate his highly-wrought outpourings when tippy-tapping
    my own prose. Long-time readers may recall what happened to Dobson when he fell
    under Shiel''s spell...
