  text: "It is rather quiet at Hooting Yard at the moment. Partly this is because\
    \ I am recovering from the ague which felled me last week, and partly, I think,\
    \ because I am reading a stout collection of short stories by M P Shiel. It is\
    \ two decades since I last immersed myself in the works of that master of purple\
    \ prose, but I am a sensible person, and, as Rebecca West so wisely said, \u201C\
    Sensible people ought to have a complete set of Shiel\u201D. I do not own such\
    \ a set, but that may be a small mercy. Reading Shiel may not exactly fuddle the\
    \ brain, but I must be very careful not to try to imitate his highly-wrought outpourings\
    \ when tippy-tapping my own prose. Long-time readers may recall what happened\
    \ to Dobson when he fell under Shiel's spell\u2026\n"
