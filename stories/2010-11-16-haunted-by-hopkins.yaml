  text: 'With my head still buried in tales by M P Shiel, I find myself wondering
    if our author was haunted by the spirit of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Rather like
    that wonderful game Cheese or Font?, one could ask, of certain short passages,
    Shiel or Hopkins?

    Consider the emboldened patch of this sentence, from the apocalyptically bonkers
    Shiel story Vaila:

    "As he lifted a latch the metal flew inward with instant impetuosity and swung
    him far, while a blast of the storm, braying and booming through the aperture
    with buccal and reboant bravura, caught and pinned me against an angle of the
    wall."'
