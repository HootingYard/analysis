  text: 'I must apologise for the dearth of decisive prose at Hooting Yard over the
    last while. At first I attributed the absence of fizzing sparks in my cranium
    to my becoming enwrapped in M P Shiel, but I am beginning to think there is another
    cause. My mind is haunted, haunted I tell you!, by the image of those friendly
    porpoises pushing octogenarian surfboard man Dick Van Dyke safely to shore from
    his imperilment upon the sea. Is there any other subject worthy of the attentions
    of the writer of today? I think not. But then, how to treat, in mere prose, an
    incident that seems to me more and more numinous and mythic?

    No doubt I will shake off this sluggishness and return to the fray, but right
    now I feel hampered by my sheer inability to do justice to The Greatest Story
    Ever Told.'
