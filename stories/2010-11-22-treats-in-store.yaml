  text: "Back in the summer of 2008, I had cause to mention Sabine Baring-Gould, author\
    \ of innumerable works including a sixteen-volume Lives Of The Saints, a study\
    \ of werewolves, grave desecration and cannibalism, and a biography of Robert\
    \ Stephen Hawker (1803\u20131875), the eccentric country vicar who spent much\
    \ of his time smoking opium in a clifftop hut made from driftwood, talked to birds,\
    \ dressed up as a mermaid, excommunicated his cat, and kept a pet pig.\nI am pleased\
    \ to report that this morning, at the London Library, recalling Baring-Gould,\
    \ and brimming with glee, I borrowed his Hawker biography (The Vicar Of Morwenstow,\
    \ 1886), a collection of pieces entitled Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869), and\
    \ a biography of the great man himself, Onward Christian Soldier\_: A Life Of\
    \ Sabine Baring-Gould, Parson, Squire, Novelist, Antiquary 1834\u20131924 by William\
    \ Purcell (1957).\nThis trio of tomes will, I expect, contain much that is diverting\
    \ and instructive and I shall share the more startling bits with you when I buckle\
    \ down to reading them."
