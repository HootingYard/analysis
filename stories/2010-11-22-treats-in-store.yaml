  text: 'Back in the summer of 2008, I had cause to mention Sabine Baring-Gould, author
    of innumerable works including a sixteen-volume Lives Of The Saints, a study of
    werewolves, grave desecration and cannibalism, and a biography of Robert Stephen
    Hawker (1803-1875), the eccentric country vicar who spent much of his time smoking
    opium in a clifftop hut made from driftwood, talked to birds, dressed up as a
    mermaid, excommunicated his cat, and kept a pet pig.

    I am pleased to report that this morning, at the London Library, recalling Baring-Gould,
    and brimming with glee, I borrowed his Hawker biography (The Vicar Of Morwenstow,
    1886), a collection of pieces entitled Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869), and
    a biography of the great man himself, Onward Christian Soldier : A Life Of Sabine
    Baring-Gould, Parson, Squire, Novelist, Antiquary 1834-1924 by William Purcell
    (1957).

    This trio of tomes will, I expect, contain much that is diverting and instructive
    and I shall share the more startling bits with you when I buckle down to reading
    them.'
