  text: Hooting Yard's campaign for global dominion continues apace with the first
    of four "sponsored" episodes of Norm Sherman's Drabblecast fiction podcast. Hear
    Mr Key read a story with added music and sound effects! My thanks are due to Norm
    and to Salim Fadhley. Follow the link and home in on episode 188, and remember
    there are three more to come, each with Hooting Yard-related enticements.
