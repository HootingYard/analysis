  text: "1. Now there dwelt in Gath a moptop whose name was Ringo. And one day the\
    \ Lord appeared to Ringo and he was sore affrighted. Ringo tugged at the fringe\
    \ of his moptop so it might cover his eyes that he could hide the Lord from his\
    \ sight.\n2. \u201CBe not afeared, moptop!\u201D boomed the Lord, for the Lord\
    \ always spake in a boom when He appeared in Gath.\n3. And Ringo, who carried\
    \ a stick in each hand with which he thumped animal hides, had dropped his sticks\
    \ when tugging at his hair.\n4. \u201CPick up thy sticks!\u201D commanded the\
    \ Lord, and Ringo did so.\n5. \u201CWhat dost thou want with me, Lord?\u201D wailed\
    \ Ringo. He was an hairy moptop with many rings on his fingers and an innate sense\
    \ of rhythm.\n6. \u201CThou shalt hie thee hence to Pisgah,\u201D boomed the Lord,\
    \ \u201CAnd thou shalt climb to the top of the mountain and thou shalt thump thy\
    \ sticks there, upon the hides of bison and salamander, stretched upon a frame,\
    \ and thump them too upon discs of metal, and make a din.\u201D\n7. And the Lord\
    \ made mysterious manoeuvres with his hands and blessed Ringo the moptop, and\
    \ then He vanished in a cloud of vaporousness, and all was still, and Ringo was\
    \ alone in Gath.\n8. And Ringo betook himself with great haste to the main railway\
    \ terminus in Gath where he might catch a train to take him all the way to Pisgah.\n\
    9. Now at the railway terminus there was a satrap of exceeding girth, and Ringo\
    \ spake unto him, saying, \u201CI am sent to Pisgah by the Lord, but I know not\
    \ how I might journey thence from here.\u201D\n10. And the satrap led Ringo to\
    \ a tank engine and commanded him in a voice of great pomp to step aboard. The\
    \ engine was blue, the blue of heaven.\n11. And with chugs and wheezes the tank\
    \ engine with the moptop aboard set off along the branch line to Pisgah.\n12.\
    \ But lo! unbeknownst to Ringo the satrap of exceeding girth had so arranged things\
    \ that the engine was shunted into sidings half way between Gath and Pisgah, and\
    \ there it sat, and would not move.\n13. And thus did Ringo the moptop find himself\
    \ marooned and far from Pisgah, and from the mountain top, and his two sticks\
    \ dangled from his beringed fingers with nought to thump, and he wept."
