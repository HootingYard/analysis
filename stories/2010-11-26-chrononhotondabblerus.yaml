    ''Tis Friday morning, which means of course that one finds something new in my
    cupboard at The Dabbler. This week, a brief note on a forgotten drama by the author
    of God Save The King/Queen, Henry Carey (c.1687-1743), together with a link to
    the complete text. I hope this will be of interest to any clapped-out old thespians
    among my readership. Word has it that the Bodger''s Spinney Variety Theatre will
    be mounting a star-studded production of the play in lieu of this year''s Christmas
    panto.'
