  text: "\n\u2018Tis Friday morning, which means of course that one finds something\
    \ new in my cupboard at The Dabbler. This week, a brief note on a forgotten drama\
    \ by the author of God Save The King/Queen, Henry Carey (c.1687\u20131743), together\
    \ with a link to the complete text. I hope this will be of interest to any clapped-out\
    \ old thespians among my readership. Word has it that the Bodger's Spinney Variety\
    \ Theatre will be mounting a star-studded production of the play in lieu of this\
    \ year's Christmas panto."
