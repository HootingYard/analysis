  text: And from The Dabbler to The Drabblecast. This second sponsored show includes
    a marvellous version of "O Say Can You See" sung by Mr Key's son Ed, with full
    musical accompaniment, and then Mr Key himself giving some tips on what to do
    if you wake to find hoofprints on your ceiling. Once again, Norm Sherman provides
    a superb musical background. Listen and learn.
