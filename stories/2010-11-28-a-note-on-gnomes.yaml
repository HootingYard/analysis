  text: 'When keeping a tally of gnomes, it is important to be aware of the different
    varieties, including newly-discovered types of gnome. It is all very well being
    able to spot, for example, well-known gnomes such as garden gnomes, the gnomes
    of Zurich, and Rudolf Steiner''s curiously disturbing invisible gnomes, but what
    will it profit a man if he tallies up some types of gnome but overlooks others
    entirely?

    Consider, for example, the exhausted pipe-cleaner gnomes mentioned in passing
    on page 149 of Kate Atkinson''s novel Started Early, Took My Dog (2010). To the
    best of my knowledge, these busy little fellows have not previously been recorded
    in any authoritative list of gnome-types. Now they have been brought to light,
    however, it is clear that one must keep an eye out for them when conducting a
    gnome tally.

    Ms Atkinson has little to say about them, although she does note their propensity
    for drunkenness. We should not be surprised at this, for it does not take much
    to intoxicate a gnome. And we can hardly begrudge these gnomes their pots of foaming
    Norwegian lager after a hard day''s pipe-cleaning. Even though you are not a gnome,
    I expect you too would be exhausted if you were up at the crack of dawn, armed
    with a scrubbing brush and a bucket of bleach, off to clean pipes until nightfall.

    Gnomes are particularly suited to cleaning duties, of course, even when suffering
    from hangovers, as they usually are. Yet somehow in his magisterial survey of
    common gnome occupations, Blotzmann omits the pipe-cleaner gnomes, jumping, in
    his alphabetic list, from oilrig janitor gnomes directly to potting shed snack
    preparation gnomes. From this we can conclude that the exhausted pipe-cleaner
    gnomes have deliberately concealed their existence from the wider world, more
    successfully even than Steiner''s creepy invisible gnomes, which is saying something.
    The alternative is that Blotzmann failed to notice them, which would mean that
    his survey is not as magisterial as we have been led to believe. Frankly, that
    doesn''t bear thinking about. One thing we learn from any half-competent gnome
    tally is that calling Blotzmann''s expertise into question unleashes those terrible,
    terrible Blotzmann Reputation Protection gnomes, with their sharpened pins and
    hallucinatory facial expressions.'
