  text: "Last summer, in a ground-breaking piece of rustic radio, Hooting Yard On\
    \ The Air broadcast a very rare audio excerpt from the BBC's magnificent bumpkin-and-yokel\
    \ drama Lark Rise To Candleford. In this scene, one of the peasants sprawls next\
    \ to the drainage ditch and recites Captain Beefheart's \u201COld Fart At Play\u201D\
    \ from Trout Mask Replica. It is now available on the most recently-released podcast,\
    \ or you can listen to it directly, here, without the rest of Mr Key's babbling\
    \ flummery.\nOldFartAtPlay (mp3)"
