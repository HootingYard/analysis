  text: 'Last summer, in a ground-breaking piece of rustic radio, Hooting Yard On
    The Air broadcast a very rare audio excerpt from the BBC''s magnificent bumpkin-and-yokel
    drama Lark Rise To Candleford. In this scene, one of the peasants sprawls next
    to the drainage ditch and recites Captain Beefheart''s "Old Fart At Play" from
    Trout Mask Replica. It is now available on the most recently-released podcast,
    or you can listen to it directly, here, without the rest of Mr Key''s babbling
    flummery.
