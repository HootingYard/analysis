  text: 'The slack-jawed dribbler drooled as he danced. In spite of his dribbling
    and drooling, he executed as fine a waltz as any man alive. His partners, fey
    ladies prone to fits of the vapours, learned to wear protective shawls, of plastic
    or rubber, to parry the drool. It was viscous drool that dribbled from his slack
    jaw. We do not have time here to delve into his innards and their startling chemistry
    to explain the equally startling viscosity of his drool, suffice to say he had
    been studied by boffins, who found him fascinating, though they cared not a jot
    for his waltzing. But perhaps they ought to have cared, and investigated, for
    it may be that there was a link, unsuspected but adamantine, between his anomalous
    innards and his terpsichorean talent.

    Because of his drooling, the slack-jawed dribbler was a man of few words. It was
    said that he expressed himself more fully in the waltz than he could ever manage
    with words. When he spoke, he slurred and slurped and his eyes grew wild. The
    fey ladies shuddered or swooned, and who can blame them? It is also true that
    he had no conversation, of the kind suitable for tea dances and soirees. He had
    fixed views on two or three topics of limited interest, and these he expounded,
    so far as his drooling and slurring and slurping allowed, in a low monotone indistinguishable
    at times from the buzz of a distant swarm of hornets.

    And hornets were indeed one of his topics of interest, along with taxidermised
    plovers and steam power. He was learned, but limited in his learning, as if mighty
    ramparts of concrete surrounded his mind. This, too, may have been connected to
    the curious chemical reactions within his innards. It does nothing to explain
    his waltzing, which was a wonder.

    He haunted the drawing-rooms I myself haunted for a decade or more. I always stood
    on the other side of the room, peering at him through my binoculars from the shadows.
    I studied him as one might study a bluebottle fly, or one of the worms. But before
    I could reach any conclusions, one afternoon he was no longer to be seen, dancing
    so elegantly across the parquet. He was gone, and nobody ever spoke of him. The
    fey ladies took up with other dancing partners, men with medals and moustaches
    who did not drool. I had neither medals nor a moustache. I had just my binoculars.
    And with the slack-jawed dribbler gone, I trained them upon other subjects. But
    I trained them in vain, for by now the lenses were cracked and smudged, and all
    I saw was blurs.

    Then they ejected me from the drawing-rooms, and barred me for the future. I sought
    the slack-jawed dribbler high and low, mon semblable, mon frere!,  but I never
    tracked him to his lair. I made my own lair, in a horrible cave, and here I''ll
    stay.'
