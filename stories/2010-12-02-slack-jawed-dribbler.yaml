  text: "The slack-jawed dribbler drooled as he danced. In spite of his dribbling\
    \ and drooling, he executed as fine a waltz as any man alive. His partners, fey\
    \ ladies prone to fits of the vapours, learned to wear protective shawls, of plastic\
    \ or rubber, to parry the drool. It was viscous drool that dribbled from his slack\
    \ jaw. We do not have time here to delve into his innards and their startling\
    \ chemistry to explain the equally startling viscosity of his drool, suffice to\
    \ say he had been studied by boffins, who found him fascinating, though they cared\
    \ not a jot for his waltzing. But perhaps they ought to have cared, and investigated,\
    \ for it may be that there was a link, unsuspected but adamantine, between his\
    \ anomalous innards and his terpsichorean talent.\nBecause of his drooling, the\
    \ slack-jawed dribbler was a man of few words. It was said that he expressed himself\
    \ more fully in the waltz than he could ever manage with words. When he spoke,\
    \ he slurred and slurped and his eyes grew wild. The fey ladies shuddered or swooned,\
    \ and who can blame them? It is also true that he had no conversation, of the\
    \ kind suitable for tea dances and soir\xE9es. He had fixed views on two or three\
    \ topics of limited interest, and these he expounded, so far as his drooling and\
    \ slurring and slurping allowed, in a low monotone indistinguishable at times\
    \ from the buzz of a distant swarm of hornets.\nAnd hornets were indeed one of\
    \ his topics of interest, along with taxidermised plovers and steam power. He\
    \ was learned, but limited in his learning, as if mighty ramparts of concrete\
    \ surrounded his mind. This, too, may have been connected to the curious chemical\
    \ reactions within his innards. It does nothing to explain his waltzing, which\
    \ was a wonder.\nHe haunted the drawing-rooms I myself haunted for a decade or\
    \ more. I always stood on the other side of the room, peering at him through my\
    \ binoculars from the shadows. I studied him as one might study a bluebottle fly,\
    \ or one of the worms. But before I could reach any conclusions, one afternoon\
    \ he was no longer to be seen, dancing so elegantly across the parquet. He was\
    \ gone, and nobody ever spoke of him. The fey ladies took up with other dancing\
    \ partners, men with medals and moustaches who did not drool. I had neither medals\
    \ nor a moustache. I had just my binoculars. And with the slack-jawed dribbler\
    \ gone, I trained them upon other subjects. But I trained them in vain, for by\
    \ now the lenses were cracked and smudged, and all I saw was blurs.\nThen they\
    \ ejected me from the drawing-rooms, and barred me for the future. I sought the\
    \ slack-jawed dribbler high and low, mon semblable, mon fr\xE8re!, \_but I never\
    \ tracked him to his lair. I made my own lair, in a horrible cave, and here I'll\
    \ stay."
