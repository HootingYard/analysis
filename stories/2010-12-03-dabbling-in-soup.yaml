  text: 'In my cupboard this week, I bring to the huddled masses of Dabbler readers
    Maud Pastry''s recipe for alphabet soup. Within seconds of it being posted this
    morning, my email inbox emitted a raucous clanging noise, audible as far away
    as Timbuctoo--a signal that I had received a missive from the bluestocking soup
    maven herself. It reads as follows:


    "It is a crying shame, Mr Key, that you did not seek my permission before letting
    those Dabbler people, whomsoever they may be, reproduce my receipt for alphabet
    soup. Either through neglect or mischief you omitted a crucial passage from the
    receipt, and I feel sorry for any reader who prepares the soup according to the
    bastardised version which is now so regrettably in the public domain. It occurred
    to me to issue a corrective as a tweet on The Dabbler''s Twitter feed, but on
    reflection I realised I do not even know what that means, being as I am a creature
    very much of the previous century, if not the one before that. I therefore insist
    that you air this letter on your weblog.

    "Please note that when leaving the bowl to stand, and before transferring the
    contents to a cauldron, one should introduce into the liquid a duck, preferably
    a merganser or teal. The duck should be left to plash ''n'' dabble in the bowl,
    as if it were a pond, for at least two hours. You should then remove the duck,
    gently, wearing gloves, and allow it to go on its merry way, perhaps to rejoin
    its family of other ducks, wherever they may be. The soup will contain a "memory"
    of the duck''s presence, plashing ''n'' dabbling, and this adds a piquancy to
    the flavour which, though imperceptible on the palate, is such stuff as soups
    are made on, as the Swan of Avon (a man, not a duck) might have said.

    "I shall look forward to seeing this important note appear, Mr Key. Do this in
    memory of me."'
