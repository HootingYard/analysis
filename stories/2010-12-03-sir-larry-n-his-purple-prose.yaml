  text: '"Olivier doesn''t fall asleep, for him ''the god Morpheus had applied his
    gentle pressure to my dormic nerve''; he doesn''t go for a quick shag, Olivier
    has ''tender venturings into the blessed unction of sex''. It''s a masquerade."

    Roger Lewis, The Real Life Of Laurence Olivier (1996), quoting from the actor''s
    autobiography.'
