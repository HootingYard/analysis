  text: "\u201COlivier doesn't fall asleep, for him \u2018the god Morpheus had applied\
    \ his gentle pressure to my dormic nerve\u2019; he doesn't go for a quick shag,\
    \ Olivier has \u2018tender venturings into the blessed unction of sex\u2019. It's\
    \ a masquerade.\u201D\nRoger Lewis, The Real Life Of Laurence Olivier (1996),\
    \ quoting from the actor's autobiography."
