  text: 'A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned that I had armed myself with a trio of
    books by or about Sabine Baring-Gould. I have now set to reading them, and so
    confident am I that they will furnish much instructive and amusing material that
    it seems a good idea to dub this postage the inaugural one in what I intend to
    be Sabine Baring-Gould Week at Hooting Yard.

    Let us begin then, with a snippet from William Purcell''s 1957 biography, Onward
    Christian Soldier:

    "Sabine had a warm liking for his tutor. And that he in return was looked upon
    with affection is surely to some extent shown by the fact that he was asked by
    Mr Goodwin to choose his wife''s hats. Mrs Goodwin, it seems, had appalling taste.
    The results of leaving her to dress herself could be shocking in the extreme.
    Her husband''s pupil was therefore asked, and apparently agreed, not only to accompany
    the lady in an advisory capacity when she went shopping but also to inspect her
    before she left the house.

    "Mr Goodwin was later made Bishop of Carlisle, a characteristic choice for one
    of those bishops who, as the century progressed, found themselves faced by forces
    greater than they were equipped to understand. Who supervised his wife''s choice
    of hats in Carlisle is not recorded."'
