  text: The television presenter Adrian Chiles read the headline Porpoises rescue
    Dick Van Dyke and was consumed by jealousy. Ever since he was tiny, Chiles had
    hankered to feature in an exciting news story alongside sea creatures, and now
    his thunder had been stolen by the octogenarian pretend chimney-sweep! It was
    too much to bear. Yet, rather than turning his twisted mental havoc upon Dick
    Van Dyke, the West Bromwich Albion-supporting anchorman began to plot vengeance
    against the very sea creatures which until now had fascinated him. In his mania,
    he decided to obliterate the largest sea creature he could obtain, to obliterate
    it in the most disgusting way, by eating it. And he decided to make of his revenge
    a festive occasion, by arranging his foul dinner to take place on the day when
    we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. What demons swept through his maddened
    mind, to so finesse his unutterable act? Alas, no hint was given of his motives
    in the newspaper report which followed, in the cheaply-photocopied Weekly Cetacean
    News Roundup, under the headline A Whale's Christmas In Chiles.
