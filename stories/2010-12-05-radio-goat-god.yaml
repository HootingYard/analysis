  text: The third sponsored Drabblecast is now up, where you can listen to Mr Key
    and his occasional radio helpmeet Mr Dickson read the Goat God Catechism, with
    the added bonus of a brief bit of blather from Mr Key, recorded, just the other
    day, on a telephone device. Many thanks once again to both Norm Sherman and Salim
    Fadhley.
