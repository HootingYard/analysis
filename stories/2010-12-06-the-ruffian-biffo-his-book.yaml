  text: '"In the dying hours of the year, in a foul and ill-lit alleyway, a raddled
    roue, staggering out of a den of vice, was set upon by a ruffian. The ruffian
    biffed the roue upon the bonce, and kicked him on the shins, just above his spats,
    and thumped him in the stomach, and the roue crumpled to the ground, winded and
    helpless in the noisome filth. Then the ruffian stamped his big black boot upon
    the roue''s biffed bonce, and spat upon his person, and stalked off down the alleyway
    into the night. And soon thereafter came the pealing of bells, ringing in the
    new year, and from a clump of dark trees in the park, the hooting of an owl."

    Thus begins Pebblehead''s paperback potboiler The Ruffian Biffo, His Book, surely
    the most relentlessly violent novel ever published. Its four hundred pages consist
    of little more than descriptions of the ruffian Biffo biffing and kicking and
    punching and thumping a series of victims, from the raddled roue staggering from
    a den of vice to a preening fop on a roister doister, a dandy in the doorway of
    a bordello, a macaroni on horseback and a pantalooned magnifico on his way to
    un ballo en maschera.

    Interspersed with these almost identical scenes, Pebblehead makes a few half-witted
    attempts to probe the interior life of his ruffianly protagonist. Biffo, we are
    told, is variously "a card-carrying communist", "devoted to his dear old mum",
    and "a wizard at the loom". To be fair, there is one lengthy and anomalous passage
    (pp. 103-149) where Biffo weaves a blanket for his mother, a blanket emblazoned
    with a hammer-and-sickle and a daringly avant-garde portrait of Stalin.

    In an interview, Pebblehead did not claim, as one might have expected him to,
    that this scene--beautifully written and astonishing in its detail of blanket-weaving
    and communist ideology--is the "heart of the novel". In fact he was quite shameless
    in his insistence that Biffo''s biffings and kickings and punchings and thumpings
    are what the book is "about", adding that he only threw in the other material
    because he had a head cold and drank too many beakers of Lemsip.

    It is difficult to know what to make of the book, but like all Pebblehead''s paperback
    potboilers, it is a bestseller. Apparently, he plans to follow it up with a spin-off
    about the raddled roue, following his debauches in the weeks leading up to the
    fateful encounter with Biffo. "I am hoping," announced the writer from his chalet
    o'' prose, "That the next book will prove to be the most relentlessly debauched
    novel ever published. After that I shall move on to a mawkish and vapid heist
    ''n'' espionage romantic science fiction teenage detective blockbuster, with vampires."'
