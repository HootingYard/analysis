  text: "\u201CIn the dying hours of the year, in a foul and ill-lit alleyway, a raddled\
    \ rou\xE9, staggering out of a den of vice, was set upon by a ruffian. The ruffian\
    \ biffed the rou\xE9 upon the bonce, and kicked him on the shins, just above his\
    \ spats, and thumped him in the stomach, and the rou\xE9 crumpled to the ground,\
    \ winded and helpless in the noisome filth. Then the ruffian stamped his big black\
    \ boot upon the rou\xE9's biffed bonce, and spat upon his person, and stalked\
    \ off down the alleyway into the night. And soon thereafter came the pealing of\
    \ bells, ringing in the new year, and from a clump of dark trees in the park,\
    \ the hooting of an owl.\u201D\nThus begins Pebblehead's paperback potboiler The\
    \ Ruffian Biffo, His Book, surely the most relentlessly violent novel ever published.\
    \ Its four hundred pages consist of little more than descriptions of the ruffian\
    \ Biffo biffing and kicking and punching and thumping a series of victims, from\
    \ the raddled rou\xE9 staggering from a den of vice to a preening fop on a roister\
    \ doister, a dandy in the doorway of a bordello, a macaroni on horseback and a\
    \ pantalooned magnifico on his way to un ballo en maschera.\nInterspersed with\
    \ these almost identical scenes, Pebblehead makes a few half-witted attempts to\
    \ probe the interior life of his ruffianly protagonist. Biffo, we are told, is\
    \ variously \u201Ca card-carrying communist\u201D, \u201Cdevoted to his dear old\
    \ mum\u201D, and \u201Ca wizard at the loom\u201D. To be fair, there is one lengthy\
    \ and anomalous passage (pp. 103\u2013149) where Biffo weaves a blanket for his\
    \ mother, a blanket emblazoned with a hammer-and-sickle and a daringly avant-garde\
    \ portrait of Stalin.\nIn an interview, Pebblehead did not claim, as one might\
    \ have expected him to, that this scene\u2014beautifully written and astonishing\
    \ in its detail of blanket-weaving and communist ideology\u2014is the \u201Cheart\
    \ of the novel\u201D. In fact he was quite shameless in his insistence that Biffo's\
    \ biffings and kickings and punchings and thumpings are what the book is \u201C\
    about\u201D, adding that he only threw in the other material because he had a\
    \ head cold and drank too many beakers of Lemsip.\nIt is difficult to know what\
    \ to make of the book, but like all Pebblehead's paperback potboilers, it is a\
    \ bestseller. Apparently, he plans to follow it up with a spin-off about the raddled\
    \ rou\xE9, following his debauches in the weeks leading up to the fateful encounter\
    \ with Biffo. \u201CI am hoping,\u201D announced the writer from his chalet o\u2019\
    \ prose, \u201CThat the next book will prove to be the most relentlessly debauched\
    \ novel ever published. After that I shall move on to a mawkish and vapid heist\
    \ \u2018n\u2019 espionage romantic science fiction teenage detective blockbuster,\
    \ with vampires.\u201D"
