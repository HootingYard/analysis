  text: "It is Sabine Baring-Gould Week at Hooting Yard, and today our hero sinks\
    \ into a bog. He is out on Dartmoor with a man called Thomas from the Ordnance\
    \ Survey. As night falls, the pair realise they are hopelessly lost. This passage\
    \ is quoted in William Purcell's biography, but he does not tell us from where\
    \ in Baring-Gould's preposterously profuse writings he has extracted it:\n\u201C\
    The bog at night exhaled a deathlike sickly odour. Not a sound could be heard.\
    \ No bird was roused, not an insect hummed. It was night now; not even a spark,\
    \ not a Jack o\u2019 Lantern. We could no longer see each other, and we had ceased\
    \ to call to each other. Then all at once a fear came over me that we had got\
    \ into Crowdy Marsh. I had seen quite enough of that. It is not composed of peat;\
    \ it is simply water which is slimy with decomposing vegetable matter. It is dangerous\
    \ to men and fatal to beasts\u2026\n\u201CAll at once I uttered a cry of \u2018\
    Help me\u2019, and sank to my armpits. It was instantaneous. I was in water, not\
    \ on moss; and in sinking all I could do was to catch at some particles of floating\
    \ moss fibre, half-rotten reed and water-weed, and rake myself forward with strokes\
    \ like those of a swimmer till I could lay hold of the spongelike surface of moss\
    \ that formed the skin over the quaking bog. The moss was a foot thick, very porous\
    \ but light, so that it floated till saturated with water. In my struggles I drew\
    \ much of this moss towards me, but, as I pressed on it it sank under my weight,\
    \ became waterlogged, and surrounded me, helping to suck me down. Against the\
    \ wan sky I could see the moss as a mound black as ink, which wavered and rolled\
    \ as I clung to and dragged at it.\n\u201CFinding that my efforts were unavailing,\
    \ and by this means I could never extricate myself, I extended the bamboo I held\
    \ horizontally, a hand at each extremity, and pressed this down on the surface\
    \ of the moss. By this means I managed to heave myself up, and I had just enough\
    \ power to throw my head and my neck forward on the moss, with arms extended like\
    \ a spider. I felt as if I were striving against a gigantic octopus, that was\
    \ endeavouring with boneless, fleshy arms to drag me under water. So great indeed\
    \ was the suction that the leather gaiters that extended to the knee were torn\
    \ off my legs.\n\u201CHaving thus reached the surface, and spread myself upon\
    \ it, I worked myself along till I arrived at a hassock of coarse grass or reed,\
    \ and on that I planted myself to breathe\u2026 I was quivering in every muscle\
    \ after the supreme strain of wrenching myself out of the mire\u2026 There was\
    \ still a long tract of moss very similar in nature to that through part of which\
    \ I had struggled, and I was fain to go through it in the same manner as before,\
    \ writhing along like a lizard.\n\u201CAt length, I came to firm land, exhausted,\
    \ panting, my brow beaded with sweat, yet at the same time conscious of extreme\
    \ cold from immersion. I called again and again\u2026 and soon came up with Thomas.\
    \ The stench of the decomposing matter in my nostrils sickened me. However, a\
    \ sense of relief and exhilaration came over me, and we made our way on till we\
    \ struck a road, and finally reached our inn. I found my purse in my pocket sodden,\
    \ my watch in my waistcoat pocket stopped\u2026\n\u201CI found moss on my left\
    \ shoulder, so that I had sunk that far, and, as I had said, the suction tore\
    \ my gaiters off my legs.\u201D"
