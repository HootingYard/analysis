  text: 'From far California, my brother has sent me a snap of something so sausagey
    and preposterous that I feel compelled to share it with you. Constructed by a
    drama teacher who once put my nephew through his thespian paces, this is a Christian
    nativity scene made entirely from sausages and bacon. Warning : may contain sausages
    and bacon.
