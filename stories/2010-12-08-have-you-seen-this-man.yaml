  text: '"Antoinette Bourignon, that extraordinary mystic of the seventeenth century,
    had some strange visions of the primeval man and the birth of Eve. The body of
    Adam, she says, was more pure, translucent, and transparent than crystal, light
    and buoyant as air. In it were vessels and streams of light, which entered and
    exuded through the pores. The vessels were charged with liquors of various colours
    of intense brilliancy and transparency; some of these fluids were water, milk,
    wine, fire, &c. Every motion of Adam''s body produced ineffable harmonies. Every
    creature obeyed him; nothing could resist or injure him. He was taller than men
    of this time; his hair was short, curled, and approaching to black. He had a little
    down on his lower lip. In his stomach was a clear fluid, like water in a crystal
    bowl, in which tiny eggs developed themselves, like bubbles in wine, as he glowed
    with the ardour of Divine charity; and when he strongly desired that others should
    unite with him in the work of praise, he deposited some of these eggs, which hatched,
    and from one of them emerged his consort, Eve."

    Sabine Baring-Gould, Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869)
