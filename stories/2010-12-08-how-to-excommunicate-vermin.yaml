  text: 'Sabine Baring-Gould Week continues with some extremely useful information
    imparted in his book Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869), written when our hero
    was living in the abundant mud of Dalton i''t Muck. Examining legal proceedings
    taken against "snails, flies, mice, moles, ants, caterpillars, &c.", Baring-Gould
    gives us the precise wording recommended when one wishes to excommunicate such
    vile creatures. This was drawn up by Bartholomew de Chasseneux, "a noted lawyer
    of the sixteenth century". Please note that you should always bring your case
    against creepy-crawlies and vermin before the ecclesiastical rather than the civil
    courts.

    The correct form of excommunication is as follows: "O snails, caterpillars, and
    other obscene creatures, which destroy the food of our neighbours, depart hence!
    Leave these cantons which you are devastating, and take refuge in those localities
    where you can injure no one. I.N.P., &c."

    It is unclear to me whether that "&c." indicates simply the reading of the Lord''s
    Prayer--"I.N.P." standing for "In Nomine Patris"--or whether there are further
    animadversions and anathemas to follow. In the absence of any clear guidance I
    suppose you shall have to get the presiding excommunicator to improvise.'
