  text: "Sabine Baring-Gould Week continues with some extremely useful information\
    \ imparted in his book Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869), written when our hero\
    \ was living in the abundant mud of Dalton i't Muck. Examining legal proceedings\
    \ taken against \u201Csnails, flies, mice, moles, ants, caterpillars, &c.\u201D\
    , Baring-Gould gives us the precise wording recommended when one wishes to excommunicate\
    \ such vile creatures. This was drawn up by Bartholomew de Chasseneux, \u201C\
    a noted lawyer of the sixteenth century\u201D. Please note that you should always\
    \ bring your case against creepy-crawlies and vermin before the ecclesiastical\
    \ rather than the civil courts.\nThe correct form of excommunication is as follows:\
    \ \u201CO snails, caterpillars, and other obscene creatures, which destroy the\
    \ food of our neighbours, depart hence! Leave these cantons which you are devastating,\
    \ and take refuge in those localities where you can injure no one. I.N.P., &c.\u201D\
    \nIt is unclear to me whether that \u201C&c.\u201D indicates simply the reading\
    \ of the Lord's Prayer\u2014\u201CI.N.P.\u201D standing for \u201CIn Nomine Patris\u201D\
    \u2014or whether there are further animadversions and anathemas to follow. In\
    \ the absence of any clear guidance I suppose you shall have to get the presiding\
    \ excommunicator to improvise."
