  text: "In three days\u2019 time, the Hooting Yard website will be seven years old,\
    \ and I am disconcerted, on trawling back through the archives, to note that every\
    \ Yuletide season has passed without the appearance of what one would have thought\
    \ was essential, a Hooting Yard Christmas Gift Guide. God alone knows how you\
    \ lot have coped! Anyway, following an exclusive commercial tie-in with the most\
    \ gorgeous department store in the known universe, Hubermann's, I can now rectify\
    \ this terrible omission. Here, then, are five superlative gifts, available at\
    \ bargain bin prices from a bin outside the bargain bin basement of Hubermann's\
    \ \u201Cbeacon\u201D store in Pointy Town.\nJumbo Sack O\u2019 Agricultural Waste\
    \ Matter. The perfect gift for the peasant in your life. A mind-numbingly gigantic\
    \ burlap sack absolutely cram-packed with noisome slurry and farm filth.\nWandering\
    \ Mendicant's Collapsed Lung, Preserved In Jelly. Surgically removed by top doctors\
    \ from the corpse of a wandering mendicant, this collapsed lung has been expertly\
    \ preserved in special jelly. Is what it says on the jar.\n\u201CTwo-In-One\u201D\
    \ Marionette. Made from old coathangers, rags, and solidified puff pastry, this\
    \ fascinating puppet looks just like Yoko Ono until you turn it round and tweak\
    \ it a bit, when, voila! you have a lifelike Bernard Cribbins doll! Hours of fun\
    \ with two of your favourite non-fiction characters. (Provide your own string.)\n\
    Grow Your Own Marsh. Transform your living room into an eerie marsh, complete\
    \ with mephitic vapours, inexplicable darting lights, and pipe-smoking marsh sprites.\
    \ Simply sprinkle the contents of the sachet on to your carpet and watch it dissolve,\
    \ before sinking up to your armpits and flailing hopelessly, just like Sabine\
    \ Baring-Gould!\nThe Radiating Lance Of Saint Poppo. If you have any Belgian Catholics\
    \ in your family, they will treasure this miniature plastic toy lance, radiating\
    \ fire from heaven just like the lance of Saint Poppo (977\u20131048), one of\
    \ the first Flemish pilgrims to the Holy Land."
