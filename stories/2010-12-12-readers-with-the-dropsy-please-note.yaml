  text: 'It has come to my attention that several readers think Saint Poppo, he of
    the radiating lance, is a figment of my imagination. I am, apparently, given to
    dubbing fictional characters with names not dissimilar to "Poppo"--one is reminded,
    perhaps, of Signor Ploppo, who had a dramatic conversation with a bird called
    Ambrose.

    While I emit an equally dramatic sigh, may I point out, yet again, with some exasperation,
    that the content of this website, and of the allied Hooting Yard podcast, is almost
    entirely factual, based as it is on exhaustive research? It is true that occasionally
    I might make something up from a sense of mischief, or embroider certain facts
    to add a tad of piquancy or grit, but generally speaking, what you have here is
    straightforward reportage. This planet of ours is a very odd orb, you know.

    Just in case there remain some doubting Thomases, I reproduce below a tremendous
    photograph of a fully poseable toy action figure of Poppo. You will find some
    accompanying text here. Please remember to pray for Poppo''s intercession should
    you be dropsical.
