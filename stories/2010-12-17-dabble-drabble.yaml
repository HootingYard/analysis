    In my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, as promised, a small addendum to Sabine
    Baring-Gould Week. You can forget all about The Little Shop Of Horrors and consider
    instead The Little Shop Of Roger Giles, surely the finest emporium ever to grace
    the West of England.

    Meanwhile, continuing the Hooting Yard Global Outreach service, the fourth and
    final sponsored episode of The Drabblecast includes an extract from I Had A Hammer,
    and the inimitable Norm Sherman reading a snippet from Brit''s review of Impugned
    By A Peasant & Other Stories. If I have not already done so, I must take this
    opportunity to bestow a thousand thanks upon the bonce of Salim Fadhley, onlie
    begetter of the whole sponsorsip hoo-hah.'
