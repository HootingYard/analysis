  text: "\u201CIt occurred to a medical man some years ago that the uniform atmosphere\
    \ of this cave might be a specific for consumption.\n\u201CPossessed with this\
    \ theory, the doctor had a dozen small houses constructed in the cavern, about\
    \ a mile or two from its mouth, and to these he conveyed his patients. From the\
    \ appearance of these places of abode, the only wonder is that the poor invalids\
    \ did not expire after twenty-four hours of residence in them. They, however,\
    \ contrived to exist there about three months, most of them being carried out\
    \ in extremis. The houses consisted of a single room, built of the rough stone\
    \ of the cavern,\u2014which, in this part, bears all the appearance of a stone-quarry,\u2014\
    and without one particle of comfort beyond a boarded floor, the small dwelling\
    \ being constructed entirely on the model of a lock-up, or \u2018stone-jug\u2019\
    . The cells of a modern prison are quite palatial in comparison with them. The\
    \ darkness is such as might be felt; and it is impossible to realize what darkness\
    \ actually is until experienced in some place where a ray of sunlight has never\
    \ penetrated\u2026\n\u201CThe houses\u2014or rather detached stone boxes\u2014\
    were so small that without vitiating the air only one person could remain in them\
    \ at one time; so that, besides the darkness,\u2014in case of any accident to\
    \ their lamps,\u2014these poor creatures must have endured utter solitude. Their\
    \ food was brought from the hotel, two or three miles away, on the hill, and consequently\
    \ must have been cold and comfortless. They were kept prisoners within their narrow\
    \ cells, for the rough rocks and stones everywhere abounding rendered a promenade\
    \ for invalids quite impracticable. The deprivation of sunlight, fresh air, and\
    \ all the beauties of the earth must have been the direst punishment imaginable.\
    \ No wonder these poor creatures were carried out one by one to die.\n\u201CThe\
    \ last one having become so weak that it was deemed unsafe to move him, his friends\
    \ resolved to stay with him in the cavern till the last. What transpired is now\
    \ beyond investigation. Whether some effect of light, which in this cavern has\
    \ a most mysterious and awful appearance, or whether the death-bed was one of\
    \ terrors, owing to some imp of mischief having laid a plan to \u2018scare\u2019\
    \ them, as they say in this country, is not known; but they rushed terror-stricken\
    \ from the cave, and on reaching the hotel fell down insensible. Subsequently\
    \ they declared they had seen spirits carrying away their friend. Mustering a\
    \ strong force, the people from terra firma, with the guides and plenty of torches,\
    \ sallied down to the lower and supposed infernal regions. The spirits, however,\
    \ had fled, leaving nothing but the stiffening corpse of the poor consumptive.\
    \ This ended all hope of the cavern as a cure for consumption.\u201D\nTh\xE9r\xE8\
