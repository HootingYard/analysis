  text: "\nBeware, earthlings, for the tentacles of Hooting Yard creep ever further\
    \ in our tireless pursuit of global dominion. Most recently, Mr Key turns up on\
    \ the SubGenius Hour Of Slack Podcast (The Church Of The SubGenius Weekly Radio\
    \ Ministry) where he can be heard reciting the Lark Rise To Candleford peasant\
    \ version of Captain Beefheart's Old Fart At Play, in among an hour of sound collages\
    \ and Devo cover versions. Thanks to Outa_Spaceman for his \u201Cintervention\u201D\
    , if that is the word I am looking for."
