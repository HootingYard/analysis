  text: 'Listening to the hysterical news reports of our current snow-blanket, one
    might think we had entered a new Ice Age. But this too shall pass. As far as I
    recall, there are such things as seasons. For a sense of perspective, let us turn
    to George A B Dewar :

    "At the acme of the year, days of great June with its clouds of endless forms
    and phantasies, wisp, stipple and fleece of cirrus and cirrostratus, snow mountains
    of cumulus; July with sorceries of silence and the scented breath of its eve,
    with its strange dance of ghost moths at dusk, when Capella is flashing intensely
    out of the afterglow and the gold taper of Mars is alight in the awful blue; August
    knee-deep in the copse grasses with yellow-hammer days; autumn with its golden-haired
    larches; winter with a wine-coloured withy wood by the estuary, and the ghost-like
    earth-cloud, stratus, creeping over the darkening marsh or heath; and at the same
    seasons the whirling columns of winter-gnats and the glittering gossamer weighted
    with rainbow dewdrops. Then there is the faery year of our English birds : spiral
    evolution of linnets in the frosty skies, loop of the rooks going home to rest,
    a flock of starlings in autumn black-budding the ash tree a field away, swans
    angel white clipt out on the leaden lake, thrushes singing like mad in the grey
    stormy March dawn."

    It is surprising, perhaps, to find that an English nature writer in the first
    decade of the last century was some kind of proto-Stalinist, but then there is
    this :

    "The right enjoyment and study of these things must make men and women happier,
    completer in understanding in taste and eye, and therefore better members of the
    State."
