  text: 'This photograph has yet to be authenticated by the Tiny Enid Photographic
    Authentication Bureau, but appears to show a tot who could possibly be Tiny Enid
    standing next to her cardboard submarine. That the plucky little fascist had a
    cardboard submarine we already know. Remember that stirring line in the Memoirs,
    "I had a submarine and it was made out of cardboard"?
