    It may be a little quiet here for a few days while I watch my flocks and muck
    about with gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and stare at a star, and other such
    important activities. I will, however, try to post the traditional Hooting Yard
    pictorial Christmas greeting tomorrow, if I can find something suitable.

    Meanwhile, over at The Dabbler, you can find a seasonal tale exhumed from the
    Archives. Devoted readers will probably have it by heart, and be ready to recite
    it to the tinies at bedtime, but I learned that apparently there are a few visitors
    to The Dabbler who have not spent the past six months poring over the accumulated
    treasures of Hooting Yard (2003-2010), so we must help them get up to speed before
    the new year.'
