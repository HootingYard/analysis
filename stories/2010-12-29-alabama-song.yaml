  text: O show us the way to the next Brecht symposium. O don't ask why, o don't ask
    why. For we must find the next Brecht symposium and spout twaddle, or if we don't
    attend the plenary session and spout twaddle I tell you we must die, I tell you
    we must die, I tell you, I tell you, I tell you we must lose out on tenure in
    a professorship in Brecht studies at an important university where we can be paid
    handsomely to spout twaddle until kingdom come, which is surely not unlike death,
    in a spiritual sense, is it not, Lars?
