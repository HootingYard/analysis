    A missive arrives from Dr Ruth Pastry:

    So then, Mr Key, I have just had the dubious pleasure of reading Old Key''s Almanacke
    in today''s Dabbler. I note that in your prognostications for the coming year
    you failed to mention birds. Knowing, as I do, that you are a man of exceeding
    ornithological perspicacity, this came as something of a surprise. You will protest
    that eggs get a mention, in October, but as I need hardly tell you, eggs are not
    birds. Some of them may become birds, in due time, but that is beside the point.

    I myself would never presume to foretell the future without first making a very
    careful study of our wing-blessed friends. It is, I think, well known that accurate
    forecasts about the future doings of princes and potentates and popes depend upon
    acute "reading" of the various timbres of coos and caws and clucks and chirrups
    and shrieks of all sorts of birds, not excluding budgerigars and pratincoles.
    Similarly, by plucking and arranging in significant array the plumage of certain
    birds, including avocets and owls, one gains eldritch insight into the likely
    outcome of the coming year''s important sporting fixtures. Of course, you need
    to know which type of bird to pluck the feathers from, how to lay out the feathers
    upon a plain flat surface, and, crucially, how to interpret the pattern thus formed.

    I do not claim, however, to be a haruspex, for the simple reason that it is against
    my moral code wilfully to slaughter a bird--any bird--that I might wrench out
    its entrails, hot and bloody, for the sole purpose of fortune telling. I leave
    that kind of thing to the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman.

    Anyway, I wish you a happy new year, whatsoever may come to pass, and now I must
    dash, because the iFry I received as a Christmas gift is wittering imbecilically
    upon every subject under the sun, and I shall be driven insane unless I silence
    it by plunging it into a bucket of scum-coated rainwater. Toodle pip!'
