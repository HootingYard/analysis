  text: "\nA missive arrives from Dr Ruth Pastry:\nSo then, Mr Key, I have just had\
    \ the dubious pleasure of reading Old Key's Almanacke in today's Dabbler. I note\
    \ that in your prognostications for the coming year you failed to mention birds.\
    \ Knowing, as I do, that you are a man of exceeding ornithological perspicacity,\
    \ this came as something of a surprise. You will protest that eggs get a mention,\
    \ in October, but as I need hardly tell you, eggs are not birds. Some of them\
    \ may become birds, in due time, but that is beside the point.\nI myself would\
    \ never presume to foretell the future without first making a very careful study\
    \ of our wing-blessed friends. It is, I think, well known that accurate forecasts\
    \ about the future doings of princes and potentates and popes depend upon acute\
    \ \u201Creading\u201D of the various timbres of coos and caws and clucks and chirrups\
    \ and shrieks of all sorts of birds, not excluding budgerigars and pratincoles.\
    \ Similarly, by plucking and arranging in significant array the plumage of certain\
    \ birds, including avocets and owls, one gains eldritch insight into the likely\
    \ outcome of the coming year's important sporting fixtures. Of course, you need\
    \ to know which type of bird to pluck the feathers from, how to lay out the feathers\
    \ upon a plain flat surface, and, crucially, how to interpret the pattern thus\
    \ formed.\nI do not claim, however, to be a haruspex, for the simple reason that\
    \ it is against my moral code wilfully to slaughter a bird\u2014any bird\u2014\
    that I might wrench out its entrails, hot and bloody, for the sole purpose of\
    \ fortune telling. I leave that kind of thing to the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman.\nAnyway,\
    \ I wish you a happy new year, whatsoever may come to pass, and now I must dash,\
    \ because the iFry I received as a Christmas gift is wittering imbecilically upon\
    \ every subject under the sun, and I shall be driven insane unless I silence it\
    \ by plunging it into a bucket of scum-coated rainwater. Toodle pip!"
