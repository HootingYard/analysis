  text: "\nThis intriguing snapshot was taken exactly one hundred tears ago today\
    \ in the Big Hangar At Pointy Town, a big hangar in Pointy Town. We can see a\
    \ number of people, now all dead, standing or milling about, and, with a single\
    \ exception, not one of them is paying attention to the large and mysterious crate.\
    \ The group slap bang next to the crate is peering past it, at something else,\
    \ we know not what. Others are seen walking past, as if oblivious. In the foreground,\
    \ however, we see a diminutive figure, possibly a curious infant, who seems to\
    \ want to move towards the crate but is being bustled away by its guardian or\
    \ governess, dressed in hood and cape.\nCan it be that the tiny one, alone of\
    \ those in the hangar, knew what the crate contained, was attracted to it by invisible\
    \ forces the nature of which must remain to us as mysterious as the crate itself?\
    \ Some say this snap is the sole evidence of the arrival in Pointy Town of the\
    \ Grunty Man. For it is thought that, with uncharacteristic cunning, he had himself\
    \ concealed in the crate and shipped across the mighty oceans, from the pestilential\
    \ land that spawned him to the fair shores of our own continent!\nIf this is so,\
    \ we are compelled to ask\u2014who was that infant? And what became of them? Answers\
    \ on a postcard, please.\n(Snap spotted at Ptak Science Books)"
