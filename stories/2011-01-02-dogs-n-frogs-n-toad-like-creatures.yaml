  text: '[Feb. 2, 1895.] I venture to send you the following story I have lately heard
    from an eye-witness, and to ask whether you or any of your readers can throw any
    light upon the dog''s probable object. The dog in question was a Scotch terrier.
    He was one day observed to appear from a corner of the garden carrying in his
    mouth, very gently and tenderly, a live frog. He proceeded to lay the frog down
    upon a flower-bed, and at once began to dig a hole in the earth, keeping one eye
    upon the frog to see that it did not escape. If it went more than a few feet from
    him, he fetched it back, and then continued his work. Having dug the hole a certain
    depth, he then laid the frog, still alive, at the bottom of it, and promptly scratched
    the loose earth back into the hole, and friend froggy was buried alive! The dog
    then went off to the corner of the garden, and returned with another frog, which
    he treated in the same way. This occurred on more than one occasion; in fact,
    as often as he could find frogs he occupied himself in burying them alive. Now
    dogs generally have some reason for what they do. What can have been a dog''s
    reason for burying frogs alive? It does not appear that he ever dug them up again
    to provide himself with a meal. If, sir, you or any of your readers can throw
    any light on this curious, and for the frogs most uncomfortable, behaviour of
    my friend''s Scotch terrier, I should be very much obliged.--R. Acland-Troyte.

    [Feb. 9, 1895.] I think I can explain the puzzle of the Scotch terrier and his
    interment of the frogs, for the satisfaction of your correspondent. A friend of
    mine had once a retriever who was stung by a bee, and ever afterwards, when the
    dog found a bee near the ground, she stamped on it, and then scraped earth over
    it and buried it effectually -presumably to put an end to the danger of further
    stings. In like manner, another dog having bitten a toad, showed every sign of
    having found the mouthful to the last degree unpleasant. Probably Mr. Acland-Troyte''s
    dog had, in the same way, bitten a toad, and conceived henceforth that he rendered
    public service by putting every toad-like creature he saw carefully and gingerly
    "out of harm''s way," underground.--Frances Power Cobbe.
