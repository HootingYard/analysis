  text: "[Feb. 2, 1895.] I venture to send you the following story I have lately heard\
    \ from an eye-witness, and to ask whether you or any of your readers can throw\
    \ any light upon the dog's probable object. The dog in question was a Scotch terrier.\
    \ He was one day observed to appear from a corner of the garden carrying in his\
    \ mouth, very gently and tenderly, a live frog. He proceeded to lay the frog down\
    \ upon a flower-bed, and at once began to dig a hole in the earth, keeping one\
    \ eye upon the frog to see that it did not escape. If it went more than a few\
    \ feet from him, he fetched it back, and then continued his work. Having dug the\
    \ hole a certain depth, he then laid the frog, still alive, at the bottom of it,\
    \ and promptly scratched the loose earth back into the hole, and friend froggy\
    \ was buried alive! The dog then went off to the corner of the garden, and returned\
    \ with another frog, which he treated in the same way. This occurred on more than\
    \ one occasion; in fact, as often as he could find frogs he occupied himself in\
    \ burying them alive. Now dogs generally have some reason for what they do. What\
    \ can have been a dog's reason for burying frogs alive? It does not appear that\
    \ he ever dug them up again to provide himself with a meal. If, sir, you or any\
    \ of your readers can throw any light on this curious, and for the frogs most\
    \ uncomfortable, behaviour of my friend's Scotch terrier, I should be very much\
    \ obliged.\u2014R. Acland-Troyte.\n[Feb. 9, 1895.] I think I can explain the puzzle\
    \ of the Scotch terrier and his interment of the frogs, for the satisfaction of\
    \ your correspondent. A friend of mine had once a retriever who was stung by a\
    \ bee, and ever afterwards, when the dog found a bee near the ground, she stamped\
    \ on it, and then scraped earth over it and buried it effectually -presumably\
    \ to put an end to the danger of further stings. In like manner, another dog having\
    \ bitten a toad, showed every sign of having found the mouthful to the last degree\
    \ unpleasant. Probably Mr. Acland-Troyte's dog had, in the same way, bitten a\
    \ toad, and conceived henceforth that he rendered public service by putting every\
    \ toad-like creature he saw carefully and gingerly \u201Cout of harm's way,\u201D\
    \ underground.\u2014Frances Power Cobbe.\nFrom Dog Stories From The Spectator\_\
