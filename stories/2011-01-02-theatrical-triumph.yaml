  text: 'We do not pay much attention to the theatrical world here at Hooting Yard,
    unless, that is, we have tidings to report from the Bodger''s Spinney Variety
    Theatre. But every so often, a dramatic production so stupendous comes along that
    we can but gasp in awe and admiration.


    Such a theatrical triumph is Entries From Reverend Gilbert White''s Diary In December,
    performed by Miss Hathorn''s Little Paper Theatre at Mustard Plaster. If there
    was a smidgen of sense in the world, this would transfer to the West End and pack
    in the punters and be showered with awards.


    Readers are reminded that the Hooting Yard Christmas Special for 2009, devoted
    to Mrs Snooke''s tortoise Timothy (pictured above), can still be listened to here.'
