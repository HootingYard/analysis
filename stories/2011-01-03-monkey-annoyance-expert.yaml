  text: 'As one of the world''s leading monkey-annoyance experts, I am regularly pressed
    by people to give handy hints on ways to annoy monkeys. For example, I might be
    leaning against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated cocktail party and be importuned
    by a sophisticated cocktail partygoer demanding to be told how he or she might
    best annoy a monkey. Invariably, I reply that I do not actually spend my time
    devising ways to annoy monkeys as a hobby or pastime, but that I am in fact a
    serious and dedicated scientist whose object of study is the neurological complexity
    of the monkey brain. No matter how sophisticated they are, my interlocutors are
    always disappointed to hear this, and move off across the drawing-room to strike
    up a new cocktail party conversation with somebody more amusing than me.

    Personally, I can think of few activities more foolish than to deliberately annoy
    a monkey. When, for example, I shut a monkey in a room with a flying squirrel,
    I do so in the interests of science, not because it gives me a big belly laugh
    to watch how annoyed the monkey becomes. In any case, I am too busy keeping an
    eye on my monkey brain-scan monitors and other precision gubbins even to crack
    a smile. Now and then, it is true, one of my research assistants might chuckle
    at the monkey''s annoyance, but when that happens I punch the assistant on the
    jaw and transfer them to janitorial mopping duties for a week. They soon learn.

    I recall first becoming fascinated by annoyed monkeys when I was a small child.
    My parents kept a pet monkey named Harrison, and it often became annoyed. Now
    I realise its annoyance was due to the presence of my parents'' other pet, a flying
    squirrel named Birtwistle. It took many long years of gruelling study for me to
    discover this. After all, Harrison might have been annoyed by many other things,
    such as my father''s habit of tapping his pipe on railings, or my mother''s staple
    gun, or my sister''s frosty icing palaver, especially on Sundays. These things
    annoyed me, so why should they not annoy the monkey? Only after enrolling in a
    baccalaureate in monkey annoyance at a large and important seat of learning did
    it begin, slowly, to dawn on me that Birtwistle the flying squirrel could be the
    primary cause of Harrison the monkey''s annoyance. By the time my studies were
    complete, and I published my world-shuddering paper on monkey annoyance, both
    the pets were dead, as were my parents. My sister, meanwhile, had run off to an
    ashram with a yogi.

    I have since published several other papers, equally brilliant, on further monkey
    annoyances. Now I am ready to go beyond annoyance to rage, and am investigating
    advanced methods of enraging monkeys. So if you should encounter me at a sophisticated
    cocktail party, oh do not ask "What is it?" let us go and make our visit to the
    enraged monkey lab, where you can see for yourself how tirelessly I probe the
    inner workings of the monkey brain, and your brain too, if your brain resembles
    that of a monkey, which it probably does, judging by the people I meet at the
    sophisticated cocktail parties to which I am invited.

    Now off you go and read the Christian Science Monitor.
