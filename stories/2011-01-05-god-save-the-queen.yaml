  text: 'We must thank ZMKC for cutting out of a 2001 issue of the New Yorker this
    absolutely splendid photograph of Queen Victoria. I suspect that the Queen was
    channelling Madame Blavatsky, presenting herself as a mystic seer. Such garb should
    set an example to the royal personages of today.
