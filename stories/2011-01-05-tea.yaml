text: "Now we have Christopher Hitchens in Slate telling us how to make a cup of tea,\
  \ I look forward to the next instalment. John Pilger, perhaps, with instructions\
  \ on how to boil an egg? No doubt the Pilge will explain that egg-boiling is an\
  \ act of Zionist imperialist aggression, to be resisted at all costs by hard-hitting\
  \ ill-argued whingeing, with a goodly dollop of manipulative sentimentality.\nHitchens\u2019\
  \ piece is splendid, and has the added benefit of quoting Yoko Ono. She may, as\
  \ he points out, be talking drivel, but every syllable that drops from her lips\
  \ is to be treasured, as you well know, innit?"
