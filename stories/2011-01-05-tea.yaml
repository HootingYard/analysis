  text: "Now we have Christopher Hitchens in Slate telling us how to make a cup of\
    \ tea, I look forward to the next instalment. John Pilger, perhaps, with instructions\
    \ on how to boil an egg? No doubt the Pilge will explain that egg-boiling is an\
    \ act of Zionist imperialist aggression, to be resisted at all costs by hard-hitting\
    \ ill-argued whingeing, with a goodly dollop of manipulative sentimentality.\n\
    Hitchens\u2019 piece is splendid, and has the added benefit of quoting Yoko Ono.\
    \ She may, as he points out, be talking drivel, but every syllable that drops\
    \ from her lips is to be treasured, as you well know, innit?"
