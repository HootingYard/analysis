  text: 'Now we have Christopher Hitchens in Slate telling us how to make a cup of
    tea, I look forward to the next instalment. John Pilger, perhaps, with instructions
    on how to boil an egg? No doubt the Pilge will explain that egg-boiling is an
    act of Zionist imperialist aggression, to be resisted at all costs by hard-hitting
    ill-argued whingeing, with a goodly dollop of manipulative sentimentality.

    Hitchens'' piece is splendid, and has the added benefit of quoting Yoko Ono. She
    may, as he points out, be talking drivel, but every syllable that drops from her
    lips is to be treasured, as you well know, innit?'
