    This week over at The Dabbler I am afraid I have had to issue a set of corrections
    and clarifications to Old Key''s Almanacke for 2011. As I point out, the errors
    in the original were probably due to the wrong kind of ectoplasm on the line,
    the "line" in this case being an invisible thread strung between the corporeal
    world and the eldritch realms inhabited by the shade of Old Key himself.

    The mysterious prognosticator can, however, already claim a triumph of foresight
    in the first week of the year. Old Key noted that birds fall out of the sky when
    petulant Ozymandias, King of Kings, gets one of his temper tantrums, and what
    do we find? In Arkansas, blackbirds have plummeted from the blue, while flocks
    of jackdaws have crashed to earth in Sweden.'
