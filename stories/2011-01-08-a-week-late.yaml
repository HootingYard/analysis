    I ought to have posted this waxen image last week, to mark the changing of the
    year, but back then, in the past, I had never seen it. It''s a detail from "Time
    And Death" by Caterina de Julianis (1695-1742), a Neapolitan nun and student of
    the Sicilian abbot and waxworker Gaetano Giulio Zumbo (1656-1701). More here,
    though I came across it when reading the section on "Wax" in Marina Warner''s
    Phantasmagoria : Spirit Visions, Metaphors, And Media Into The Twenty-First Century
    (2006). Later on in the book I am looking forward to "Ether" and "Ectoplasm"--as,
    in the latter case, will be many visitors to this website. According to the statistics,
    more people come stumbling through the rusty iron gates of Hooting Yard in search
    of ectoplasm than of any other topic--not surprisingly, when we consider Marina
    Warner''s observation that "the gossip circuits of unofficial knowledge give the
    mental skyscape of the twenty-first century the wild heterogeneity of the Hellenistic
    world, as residues from different eras have adhered to form a sticky, bristling
    deposit. Judaeo-Cabbalistic angels; Gnostic energumens, phantasms and succubi;
    Neoplatonist daimons; Middle Eastern ghouls and genies; Romantic vampires and
    revenants; African, Caribbean, and Native American zombies and spectres--all these
    various spirits and more besides flock and throng the entertainment ether and
    the world-wide Web".'
