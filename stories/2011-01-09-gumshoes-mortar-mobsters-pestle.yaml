  text: Kitchencraft in the milieu of Prohibition-era gangland is a neglected topic,
    so we must be grateful to Hoagy Velikovsky, Pipsqueak Professor of Organised Crime
    and Kitchencraft at the University of Slop, for his thumping great tome Gumshoe's
    Mortar, Mobster's Pestle, recently reissued with corrections. This is film noir
    territory, and the Prof demonstrates convincingly that the mortars and pestles
    of gumshoes and mobsters were invariably black, or white, or shades of grey, and
    that both mortars and pestles, being solid objects, cast shadows which, in this
    context, could often be eerie and even expressionist. Indeed, his opening chapter
    is devoted entirely to kitchen shadows. In some cases, a gumshoe is lurking in
    a kitchen shadow waiting to put the heat on a mobster. In others, a mobster hides
    in kitchen shadow preparatory to socking a gumshoe with a blackjack. There are
    even occasions when the kitchen shadows are empty, concealing nothing, for both
    gumshoe and mobster are absent. Velikovsky is very good at evoking the suspense
    inherent in an unattended mortar and pestle, resting on a kitchen table or countertop.
    We know something is due to be crushed and ground, but we do not yet know what
    manner of thing it might be. We know, too, that at some point both the gumshoe
    and the mobster will enter the kitchen, separately or together, and flit between
    light and shadow, armed perhaps not only with their roscoes but, fresh from grocery
    shopping, with a bag of caraway seeds or arrowroot biscuits ready to be crushed.
    The gumshoe will almost certainly have patronised a legal grocery, whereas the
    mobster will have made his purchases on the black market. It is a pity that the
    Prof does not spend more time discussing contraband caraway seeds and illegal
    arrowroot biscuits, for this would be fertile ground. He does have a few paragraphs,
    however, on the near-identical brown paper bags in which both seeds and biscuits
    would be ferried from grocery or black market to the shadowy kitchen wherein the
    mortar and the pestle await, inert and inanimate yet somehow throbbing with potential
    violence, just as the gumshoe and the mobster themselves, violent men by necessity,
    so throb. Velikovsky reflects, too, on the mutual dependence, the duality, of
    gumshoe and mobster and mortar and pestle. The one cannot have any meaningful
    existence without the other. In a passage of sparkling prose which I am sure will
    find its way into many an anthology of kitchencraft writing, he posits a second,
    or dual, duality, that of gumshoe and mortar and mobster and pestle. Curiously,
    he does not extend this conceit to the further combination of mobster and mortar
    and gumshoe and pestle. I suspect his failure to do so is due to deep and intractable
    psychological horrors the like of which frighten the horses. Horses, so essential
    to the western genre, are almost entirely absent from the film noir world. Yet
    in terms of kitchencraft, there are many parallels, and we are as likely to come
    upon mortars and pestles in a tumbledown Wild West shack's kitchen, outside which
    a horse is tied to a post, as we are along the mean film noir streets down which
    a man must go in order to make his way to his kitchen. Indeed, without a mortar
    and pestle, one wonders how the cowboy might crush and grind to a digestible consistency
    the grainy content of his horse's nosebag. This is a topic Professor Velikovsky
    may wish to explore in a forthcoming book.
