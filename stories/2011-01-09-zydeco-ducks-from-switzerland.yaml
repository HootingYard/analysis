  text: "\n\u201CDucks are a very important part of the Mama Rosin story,\u201D Girod\
    \ explains. \u201CWe have a boat on the lake which we use for birdwatching trips\
    \ and that is how we became known in Geneva as the Fr\xE8res Souchet (the name\
    \ translates as \u201CWild Duck Brothers\u201D). Also because Cyril sounds a bit\
    \ like a duck when he sings.\u201D"
