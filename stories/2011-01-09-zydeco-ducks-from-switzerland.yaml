    "Ducks are a very important part of the Mama Rosin story," Girod explains. "We
    have a boat on the lake which we use for birdwatching trips and that is how we
    became known in Geneva as the Freres Souchet (the name translates as "Wild Duck
    Brothers"). Also because Cyril sounds a bit like a duck when he sings."'
