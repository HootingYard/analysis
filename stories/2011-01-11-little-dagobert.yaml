  text: 'I banged my head on the baptismal font, but that was only the beginning of
    my troubles. The font was hewn from adamantine rock, and the water it contained,
    though of necessity holy water, was icy. When the priest slopped it on to my bashed
    head, I screamed at such a pitch that a stained glass window depicting the martyrdom
    of St Bibblybibdib (spikes, tongs, fire) was shattered. A falling shard sliced
    the priest''s jugular, and he collapsed, but not before dropping me into the font.
    While I splashed about, bawling and freezing, minuscule organisms with which the
    water was riddled swam into my ears, and burrowed tiny tunnels into my brain,
    wherein they laid their eggs. If the organisms were minuscule, imagine how microscopically
    wee were their eggs! Before death claimed me, I was plucked from the font by the
    sexton, whose beard was so vast and hairy I was almost suffocated as he clutched
    me to him. Gurgling, I was passed to my mother, a woman of great dottiness who
    endangered my life many a time in the following months, usually by taking me to
    unsuitable picnics--unsuitable in that they took place in snowstorms or, during
    balmier weather, on steep hillsides down which I would roll, gathering pace as
    I approached, at the bottom, a railway line or major arterial thoroughfare along
    which huge container lorries thundered. Fortunately, though perplexingly, the
    sexton was always on hand to rescue me in the nick of time.

    Miraculously, I survived into toddlerhood. Around this time my mother began to
    encourage me to play on the roof of our hotel during electrical storms. I was
    grateful for the rubber bootees and lead-lined swaddling jacket the sexton gave
    me. More than once I toppled from the roof into the moat, and I soon learned to
    swim skilfully to dodge both the sharp-fanged scavenger fish and the unexploded
    mines therein. Regular swimming while wearing raiment of lead does wonders to
    build up one''s muscular strength, and sure enough by my sixth birthday my mother
    was exhibiting me at circuses and freak shows. I was known as Little Dagobert,
    The Strongest Boy In The Universe. Sometimes I came close to being flattened by
    the steamrollers I pulled across lawns and village greens, until the sexton gave
    me a handy tip to avoid even the gentlest of downhill inclines.

    Being of an implausibly rare blood group, I had to be extra careful in the vicinity
    of sharp knives, axes, and slicers. My caution served me well when, on my tenth
    birthday, my mother had me apprenticed to a well-known butcher. He was a florid,
    chubby, deranged and blood-drenched man, who took both pride and pleasure in his
    inhumane slaughtering methods. I was inconsolable for days after he slew the sexton
    and chopped him to bits and made him into illegal pie-fillings. I resolved to
    run away to sea, though we lived far, far from any coast.

    One crisp autumn''s dawn I gathered my few pitiable belongings and tied them in
    a bundle and tied the bundle to the end of a stick, and with the stick propped
    jauntily over my shoulder I set out to make my way in the world. Before I got
    so far as the garden gate, however, the microscopic eggs in my brain all hatched
    at once, and let forth monsters. Though I had passed through much travail in my
    short life, things were about to get much, much worse.'
