  text: "Over at The Dabbler, Gaw has been taking a stroll through the \u201Ctended\
    \ decadence\u201D of Abney Park Cemetery, prompting Nige to recall a fine gravestone\
    \ epitaph in his local churchyard. Which in turn prompts me to recall one of my\
    \ own favourite epitaphs, that of the quack doctor Lionel Lockyer (1600\u2013\
    1672), whose miracle pills included sunbeams among their ingredients, in Southwark\
    \ Cathedral:\nHere Lockyer; lies interr'd enough; his name\nSpeakes one hath few\
    \ competitors in fame;\nA name soe Great, soe Generall't may scorne\nInscriptions\
    \ whch doe vulgar tombs adorne.\nA diminution 'tis to write in verse\nHis eulogies\
    \ whch most mens mouths rehearse.\nHis virtues and his PILLS are soe well known..\n\
    That envy can't confine them vnder stone.\nBut they'll survive his dust and not\
    \ expire\nTill all things else at th'universall fire.\nThis verse is lost, his\
    \ PILL Embalmes him safe\nTo future times without an Epitaph\n\nPhoto courtesy\
