  text: 'Over at The Dabbler, Gaw has been taking a stroll through the "tended decadence"
    of Abney Park Cemetery, prompting Nige to recall a fine gravestone epitaph in
    his local churchyard. Which in turn prompts me to recall one of my own favourite
    epitaphs, that of the quack doctor Lionel Lockyer (1600-1672), whose miracle pills
    included sunbeams among their ingredients, in Southwark Cathedral:

    Here Lockyer; lies interr''d enough; his name

    Speakes one hath few competitors in fame;

    A name soe Great, soe Generall''t may scorne

    Inscriptions whch doe vulgar tombs adorne.

    A diminution ''tis to write in verse

    His eulogies whch most mens mouths rehearse.

    His virtues and his PILLS are soe well known..

    That envy can''t confine them vnder stone.

    But they''ll survive his dust and not expire

    Till all things else at th''universall fire.

    This verse is lost, his PILL Embalmes him safe

    To future times without an Epitaph
