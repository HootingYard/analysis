  text: It is that time of year when reader Mike Jennings, from his exile in a pompous
    land, supplies us with an update to his comprehensive Dobson bibliography. A further
    twenty-four pamphlets have been added to the earlier list, which you can find
    here. Mr Jennings has once again applied those terrifying, and terrifyingly significant,
    Blotzmann Numbers. Please note that, unless otherwise stated, all the listed titles
    are currently out of print.
