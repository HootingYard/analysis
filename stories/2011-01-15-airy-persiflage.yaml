  text: "\nIt is fortunate that your own dear Mr Key is such a level-headed fellow,\
    \ or I might begin to suffer from delusions of L Ron Hubbarddom. Notwithstanding\
    \ the enduring popularity of the hideous bat god Fatso, it seems that the Goat\
    \ God Catechism has captured the imagination of the masses\u2014or, if not quite\
    \ the masses, then at least of two American podcasters.\nFirst, the catechism\
    \ was given a fine treatment by golden-voiced Norm Sherman at the Drabblecast.\
    \ Now it has been picked up by one Walter O'Hara. Mr O'Hara's podcast is called\
    \ Airy Persiflage, and with a title like that we can assume he is a man of impeccable\
    \ taste. Indeed, he has also essayed a reading of some twaddle I wrote about venomous\
    \ serpents.\nThe striking thing about this new version of the Goat God Catechism\
    \ is Mr O'Hara's inspired decision to have a child read the responses. The child\
    \ in question is \u201Cyoung Gar\u201D, who lends a splendid piquancy to the piece.\
    \ I wonder if young Gar hails from the awful, spooky land of Gaar, that place\
    \ of nightmares and ill-advised picnics?"
