    It is fortunate that your own dear Mr Key is such a level-headed fellow, or I
    might begin to suffer from delusions of L Ron Hubbarddom. Notwithstanding the
    enduring popularity of the hideous bat god Fatso, it seems that the Goat God Catechism
    has captured the imagination of the masses--or, if not quite the masses, then
    at least of two American podcasters.

    First, the catechism was given a fine treatment by golden-voiced Norm Sherman
    at the Drabblecast. Now it has been picked up by one Walter O''Hara. Mr O''Hara''s
    podcast is called Airy Persiflage, and with a title like that we can assume he
    is a man of impeccable taste. Indeed, he has also essayed a reading of some twaddle
    I wrote about venomous serpents.

    The striking thing about this new version of the Goat God Catechism is Mr O''Hara''s
    inspired decision to have a child read the responses. The child in question is
    "young Gar", who lends a splendid piquancy to the piece. I wonder if young Gar
    hails from the awful, spooky land of Gaar, that place of nightmares and ill-advised
    picnics?'
