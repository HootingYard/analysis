  text: '"And they make moon and stars appear on the ceiling after this manner. In
    the central part of the ceiling, having fastened a mirror, placing a dish full
    of water equally (with the mirror) in the central portion of the floor, and setting
    in a central place likewise a candle, emitting a faint light from a higher position
    than the dish, in this way, by reflection, (the magician) causes the moon to appear
    by the mirror. But frequently, also, they suspend on high from the ceiling, at
    a distance, a drum, but which, being covered with some garment, is concealed by
    the accomplice, in order that (the heavenly body) may not appear before the (proper)
    time. And afterwards placing a candle (within the drum), when the magician gives
    the signal to the accomplice, he removes so much of the covering as may be sufficient
    for effecting an imitation representing the figure of the moon as it is at that
    particular time. He smears, however, the luminous parts of the drum with cinnabar
    and gum; and having pared around the neck and bottom of a flagon of glass ready
    behind, he puts a candle in it, and places around it some of the requisite contrivances
    for making the figures shine, which some one of the accomplices has concealed
    on high; and on receiving the signal, he throws down from above the contrivances,
    so to make the moon appear descending from the sky.

    "And the same result is achieved by means of a jar in sylvan localities. For it
    is by means of a jar that the tricks in a house are performed. For having set
    up an altar, subsequently is (placed upon it) the jar, having a lighted lamp;
    when, however, there are a greater number of lamps, no such sight is displayed.
    After then the enchanter invokes the moon, he orders all the lights to be extinguished,
    yet that one be left faintly burning; and then the light, that which streams from
    the jar, is reflected on the ceiling, and furnishes to those present a representation
    of the moon; the mouth of the jar being kept covered for the time which it would
    seem to require, in order that the representation of full moon should be exhibited
    on the ceiling.

    "But the scales of fishes for instance, the seahorse, cause the stars to appear
    to be; the scales being steeped in a mixture of water and gum, and fastened on
    the ceiling at intervals."
