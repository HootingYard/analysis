  text: 'Exciting news from the BBC. Werner Herzog has been persuaded to direct a
    forthcoming episode of twee bucolic period drama Lark Rise To Candleford. This
    follows the unprecedented global success of the scene where the peasant sprawled
    in the drainage ditch recites Captain Beefheart''s Old Fart At Play.

    Herzog is currently working on the screenplay for his episode, which is likely
    to feature either a conquistador and a gang of howler monkeys laying waste to
    Dorcas Lane''s Candleford post office, and/or an attempt by a deranged impresario
    to build an opera house in the squalid village of Lark Rise.
