  text: 'One of the more intractable problems in goblin identification has at last
    been resolved with the formal adoption of a colour coding system. According to
    a press release from the World Council Of Goblins, the new scheme comes into immediate
    effect, and any goblin discovered not to be wearing a tunic, badge, or dye-patch
    of the appropriate colour will be catapulted into the stratosphere, daddy-o.

    Designed to benefit both the goblin and non-goblin communities, the colour coding
    is the result of decades of tireless work by Bim and Bam and Nat, the trio of
    retired blacksmiths who set themselves the task back at the 1954 UGINAK Conference.
    So much time has passed that neither Bim nor Bam nor Mat, nor any of their special
    rapporteurs nor aides de camp can remember what UGINAK stands for.

    It is thought Julian Assange got hold of a draft copy of the press release some
    months ago, but failed to leak it on his website. If so, this is possibly because
    the Antipodean chancer is actually a goblin himself, and fears the implications
    of the new system. Alternatively, it could be because the press release is in
    the form of Tolkieny runes scratched on bark, making it worse than useless in
    the age of digital twittering.

    Bim and Bam and Nat hit on the inspired idea to match each of the seven distinct
    types of active goblin to a colour of the rainbow. This is surprising when one
    considers that both Bim and Nat are colour-blind and Bam is so aged and creaky
    and stooped that he can no longer angle his head to look upon the sky. In spite
    of these obstacles, the threesome have arrived at a classification system which
    can only be described as flawless. It cannot be described in any other way whatsoever,
    so don''t even try to use another word.

    We employed a team of unpaid interns to translate the runes, locking the scalliwags
    in a cellar lit by a single Toc H lamp until their work was done. Then we had
    them deported to a remote atoll, to live on barnacles and rainwater, from motives
    of simple cruelty. This is what they came up with:

    Red : Hobgoblins.

    Orange : Fat Goblins.

    Yellow : Pilfering Goblins.

    Green : Teutonic Forest Goblins.

    Blue : Goblins found under sinks.

    Indigo : Wet Goblins.

    Violet : All other goblins not classified above.

    We cannot swear to the accuracy of the interns'' translation, but for the time
    being this will have to do.'
