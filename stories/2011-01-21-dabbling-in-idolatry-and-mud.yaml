    This week in The Dabbler I address the important topic of mud idol maintenance,
    with some simple tips on sprucing up your talismanic fetish object. This is the
    first article in a projected series intended to cover everything a sane person
    might wish to know about the subject. My people are currently in talks with a
    publisher, with a view to issuing the complete set as a part-work, building week
    by week into an exhaustive mud idol encyclopaedia, to be slotted in to ring-binders,
    eventually taking up an implausible amount of shelf-space. The marketing people
    insist that something like this will only sell if there is a "free gift" every
    week, so we are looking at the idea of giving away sachets of mud, sourced from
    a bog of mystic legend. If any readers can suggest an apt bog, please get in touch
    via your spirit medium.'
