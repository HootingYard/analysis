  text: 'Speaking of drayhorses, as we were yesterday, I could not help but notice
    that the phrase "Git on drayhorse" is an anagram of "Hooting Yarders". This has
    the vexing implication that my average reader or listener is a git mounted on
    a drayhorse. One pictures a rustic lane along which a great grey drayhorse is
    plodding, atop which is a git, leafing through a copy of Gravitas, Punctilio,
    Rectitude & Pippy Bags perhaps, or listening to my radio show on a pair of headphones
    jammed into their gitty ears.

    Now I do not wish to think of any Hooting Yard devotee as a git. Perhaps what
    we have here is akin to that phenomenon where otherwise staid and reasonable persons
    turn into psychotic maniacs when they get behind the driving wheel of a car. Does
    the placid and altogether lovely Hooting Yarder become a git at the moment of
    plopping in to the saddle of their great grey drayhorse? I suppose it is possible.

    Anagrammatic determinism being what it is, all I can do is to plead with my readers
    and listeners to find for themselves an alternative means of pulling their carts
    along the country lanes. Many of you will, I know, be toiling along those very
    lanes today, engarbed in peasant rags, transporting your carts piled high with
    rustic muck from one filthy field to another, or perhaps rolling in to a market
    square at the centre of a squalid hamlet. And what better way to pass the time,
    as the wind howls through the branches of larches and pines, than to read a tale
    from Befuddled By Cormorants or to listen on your iHoot to a morally instructive
    episode of Hooting Yard On The Air? But doing so need not, must not, make you
    a git. So eschew your drayhorse, I beg of you, and if you cannot afford a fume-belching
    tractor, pull the damned cart yourself.'
