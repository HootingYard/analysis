  text: '"Benjamin Rackstrow, a most enterprising showman in Georgian London, staged
    ''The Chair of Beatification'', which involved irradiating a willing member of
    the public with the kind of flaming amazement that Ariel conjured on the shipwreck:
    ''a Glass Crown being placed on the Head of the Person who sits in the Chair,
    immediately becomes filled with Aetherial Fire; and likewise a Glass Sceptre,
    wherein is to be seen one continued stream of Electrical Fire, of a beautiful
    Purple Colour''."
