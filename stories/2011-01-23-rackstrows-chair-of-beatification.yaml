  text: "\u201CBenjamin Rackstrow, a most enterprising showman in Georgian London,\
    \ staged \u2018The Chair of Beatification\u2019, which involved irradiating a\
    \ willing member of the public with the kind of flaming amazement that Ariel conjured\
    \ on the shipwreck: \u2018a Glass Crown being placed on the Head of the Person\
    \ who sits in the Chair, immediately becomes filled with Aetherial Fire; and likewise\
    \ a Glass Sceptre, wherein is to be seen one continued stream of Electrical Fire,\
    \ of a beautiful Purple Colour\u2019.\u201D\nMarina Warner, Phantasmagoria\_:\
    \ Spirit Visions, Metaphors, And Media Into The Twenty-First Century (2006)"
