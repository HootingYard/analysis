  text: 'Swiss sage Alain De Botton excels himself:

    "Airlines and travel agencies should think more about the nature of their business.
    At one level they''re sending passengers around the world. At a deeper level they''re
    connecting people with their dreams and hopes. I would like to be offered a therapy
    service prior to booking a ticket, and have a chance to talk to a therapeutically
    trained agent about why I want to travel to a particular place."
