  text: 'Swiss sage Alain De Botton excels himself:

    "Airlines and travel agencies should think more about the nature of their business.
    At one level they''re sending passengers around the world. At a deeper level they''re
    connecting people with their dreams and hopes. I would like to be offered a therapy
    service prior to booking a ticket, and have a chance to talk to a therapeutically
    trained agent about why I want to travel to a particular place."

    From an interview in Lufthansa in-flight magazine, quoted in Pseuds'' Corner,
    Private Eye No. 1280, 21 January--3 February 2011'
