  text: "Swiss sage Alain De Botton excels himself:\n\u201CAirlines and travel agencies\
    \ should think more about the nature of their business. At one level they're sending\
    \ passengers around the world. At a deeper level they're connecting people with\
    \ their dreams and hopes. I would like to be offered a therapy service prior to\
    \ booking a ticket, and have a chance to talk to a therapeutically trained agent\
    \ about why I want to travel to a particular place.\u201D\nFrom an interview in\
    \ Lufthansa in-flight magazine, quoted in Pseuds\u2019 Corner, Private Eye No.\
