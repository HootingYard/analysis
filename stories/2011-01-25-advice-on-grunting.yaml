  text: 'Courtesy of The Cat''s Meat Shop, some extremely detailed advice on grunting:

    Take the baby hand in one of yours. Spread out the hand. Point to the thumb, and
    say decidedly, yet confidingly -

    1. This little pig went to market." (Grunt and let it be an ordinary pig''s grunt.)

    Point to the next finger and say, in the deepest bass you can assume -

    2. "This little pig stayed at home." (Give a morose bass grunt and frown.)

    Point to the next finger and say, with an insinuating tone and smile, elevating
    your eyebrows and bowing -

    3. "This little pig had roast beef" (and add three quick little grunts of satisfaction.)

    Point to the next finger and say, in a voice just ready to cry -

    4. "This little pig had none." (Give two low grunts of weariness, and look ready
    to cry.)

    Then pointing to the little finger, say very pleasantly, in a shrill, droll voice,
    laughing meanwhile, "This little pig cried, ''Tweak! tweak! tweak!''" pinching
    and twirling the child''s finger gently, as if you had hold of the pig''s tail.

    This makes a complete harmless drama of the story of the pigs, and rouses baby''s
    feelings, sensations and ideas in a healthy manner. Five distinct emotions are
    raised: 1. Interest; 2. Fear; 3. Pleasure or sympathy; 4. Grief, almost to tears;
    5. A sudden reversion to mirth, and "All''s well that ends well," a great desideratum
    in baby estimation. We must remember too, that the feelings during babyhood are
    ephemeral in the extreme, light and evanescent...'
