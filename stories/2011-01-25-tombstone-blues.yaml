  text: "\u201CI am not just a person who goes around peeing on tombs, but a writer\
    \ with a serious oeuvre.\u201D\nSo says one Eduardo Labarca, quoted in today's\
    \ Grauniad. Proclaiming oneself to be the creator of \u201Ca serious oeuvre\u201D\
    \ is akin to the claim, invariably made by humourless persons, that \u201CI've\
    \ got a mad sense of humour, me\u201D. Labarca also states \u201CPeeing on that\
    \ tomb was a legitimate artistic act.\u201D Ah! How delightfully transgressive!\n\
    It briefly occurred to me to court notoriety and publicity by desecrating the\
    \ grave of, say, Anthony Burgess, but then I realised that I am no longer a teenperson.\
    \ Nor, for that matter, is the absurd Labarca."
