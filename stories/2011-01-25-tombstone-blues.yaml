  text: '"I am not just a person who goes around peeing on tombs, but a writer with
    a serious oeuvre."

    So says one Eduardo Labarca, quoted in today''s Grauniad. Proclaiming oneself
    to be the creator of "a serious oeuvre" is akin to the claim, invariably made
    by humourless persons, that "I''ve got a mad sense of humour, me". Labarca also
    states "Peeing on that tomb was a legitimate artistic act." Ah! How delightfully
    transgressive!

    It briefly occurred to me to court notoriety and publicity by desecrating the
    grave of, say, Anthony Burgess, but then I realised that I am no longer a teenperson.
    Nor, for that matter, is the absurd Labarca.'
