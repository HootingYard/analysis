  text: I met this morn a beckoning ghoul. It beckoned me, and like a fool I answered
    its summons. I followed it towards the drains. There, by the gutter, next to the
    drains, it began to drool. I shuddered, as one shudders when confronted by a ghoul.
    The drains stank. The ghoul stank too. From the sprig in my fist, I handed it
    a chrysanthemum. It took the flower in its ghostly claw, and chucked it into the
    drains. O ingrate ghoul! Ingrate ghoul! I turned my back on the stinking phantom
    and pranced away, contemptuous, like a fop. It does not do to show contempt to
    a ghoul. From behind, it clutched me in its cold spindly arms, and twirled me
    round, and flung me into the drains. I dropped my sprig of chrysanthemums. O scattered
    sprig! Scattered sprig! Sprawled in the drains, I saw the ghoul shimmer and vibrate
    and shape-shift. Before my eyes, it was become a pig. It grunted once, and trotted
    away towards its sty. I lay in the drains and stared up at the sky, immense and
    blue and blank. And no birds sing.
