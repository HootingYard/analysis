  text: 'One has to admire Mr and Mrs von Hohenheim, the parents of Paracelsus (1493-1541),
    for giving their tot the Christian names Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus.
    Two things worth remembering about Paracelsus are that he was the first person
    to call zinc zinc--actually he called it zincum--and that he kept a small avian
    devil imprisoned in the pommel of his sword. Samuel Butler noted this in Hudibras,
    where he wrote:

    Bombastus kept a devil''s bird / Shut in the pommel of his sword, / That taught
    him all the cunning pranks / Of past and future mountebanks.
