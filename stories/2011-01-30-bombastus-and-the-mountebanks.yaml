  text: "One has to admire Mr and Mrs von Hohenheim, the parents of Paracelsus (1493\u2013\
    1541), for giving their tot the Christian names Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus\
    \ Bombastus. Two things worth remembering about Paracelsus are that he was the\
    \ first person to call zinc zinc\u2014actually he called it zincum\u2014and that\
    \ he kept a small avian devil imprisoned in the pommel of his sword. Samuel Butler\
    \ noted this in Hudibras, where he wrote:\nBombastus kept a devil's bird / Shut\
    \ in the pommel of his sword, / That taught him all the cunning pranks / Of past\
    \ and future mountebanks.\n"
