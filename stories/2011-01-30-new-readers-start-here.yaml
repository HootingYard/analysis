  text: 'At The Dabbler the other day I answered the question "Where do you get your
    ideas from?"

    The other poser regularly aimed at scribblers--and, indeed, bloggers--is "What
    do you write about? Describe your work to us, in terms a dribbling infant could
    understand!" I have seen no better a potted summary of Hooting Yard than this
    piece at Twisty Turny Lanes. Anybody crashing through the rusty iron gates of
    Hooting Yard for the first time would do well to read it, before devoting the
    rest of their dismal days to exploring the archives.

    Many thanks to that perceptive fellow Johnnynorms.'
