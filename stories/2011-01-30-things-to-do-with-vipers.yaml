  text: 'Theriac was created by the Ancient Greeks and achieved a miraculous reputation
    as a universal panacea. It was believed to be effective against swellings, blemishes,
    fevers, poisons, heart problems, epilepsy, and palsy and it restored lost speech
    after a stroke.

    "Venetian treacle" took forty days to make, twelve years to mature, and contained
    up to sixty-four ingredients including opium, myrrh, frankincense, saffron, gentian,
    liquorice, cinnamon, gum arabic, bitumen, and skinned and roasted vipers.
