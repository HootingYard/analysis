  text: 'And still the onward march of Hooting Yard into every nook and cranny in
    the universe continues, unstoppable! The latest place we have wormed our way into
    is the Public Domain Review, a project of the Open Knowledge Foundation. The Public
    Domain Review is, as it says, "exactly what it says on the tin: a web-based review
    of works which have entered the public domain. Each week an invited contributor
    presents an interesting or curious work with a brief accompanying text giving
    context, commentary and criticism."

    This week''s invited contributor is your very own Mr Key, who was asked to write
    a brief piece introducing that inimitable masterpiece Jubilate Agno. The lovely
    people at the Review have added the audio of the legendary ResonanceFM recording
    (an outtake of which appeared here the other day), so now you know exactly what
    to do with the next three hours of your nasty, brutish and short life.

    ADDENDUM : On the subject of global dominion, WordPress keeps me alerted to mentions
    of Hooting Yard wherever and whenever they occur. And today, I am pleased--albeit
    rather beflummoxed--to learn that Unthinkable Consulting, on its ''delicious''
    feed, recommends the "offbeat brilliance" of Hooting Yard, "an example of a gift-based
    literary business model". Well, at long bloody last. Ever since I started tippy-tapping
    the contents of this website over seven years ago, I have been waiting for somebody
    to acknowledge that, all along, I have been constructing a gift-based literary
    business model, daddy-o.'
