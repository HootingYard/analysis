  text: 'I had intended, today, to give you precise instructions for the wiring up
    of that galvanic battery to the brain inside the graceful head of the swan, but
    do you know what? I had no idea just how fiddly and complicated a process it was
    going to be! I am no butterfingers, but lawks-a-mercy, guvnor!, I botched it up
    good and proper.

    With hindsight, I ought to have spotted the telltale clue that Washington Irving,
    or rather his spirit-form, was talking twaddle all along. It was the ethereal
    shade of Irving, you will recall, who mentioned the galvanic battery in the head
    of the swan in the mystic communication from the Beyond he dictated to Henry J
    Horn in 1871. But read it again, carefully. He writes of "a galvanic battery in
    the graceful swan-head". I missed it on a casual reading, and perhaps you did
    too. It is not the head of a swan that is graceful, but its neck. A certain gracefulness
    is imparted to the swan''s head by dint of it being perched atop the indubitably
    graceful neck, but the head by itself is far from graceful. In fact, it is savage
    and menacing. You can see this for yourself by the simple expedient of looking
    at a swan''s head in isolation from the graceful swan-neck to which it is usually
    attached. I am not of course suggesting for a moment that you hike over to the
    nearest pond or canal armed with a razor-sharp cleaver and start beheading any
    swans you might find gliding gracefully across the water. There are laws against
    such behaviour, and rightly so, or where would we be but in a state of anarchy
    littered with the severed heads of swans, their bloodied corpses staining our
    ponds and canals red with swan-gore? No, all you need do to grasp my point is
    to take a cardboard swan and snip off the head with a hefty pair of scissors.
    Toss the body, and neck, on to a pyre, and make a careful study of the detached
    head. Where, I ask you, where is the grace? I think you will find that what grace
    there was lay in the curvature of the neck, the cardboard neck now turning to
    ashes in the blaze.

    If we assume that Henry J Horn made an accurate transcription of the spirit-witterings
    of Washington Irving, we must conclude that the author of A History of New-York
    from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich Knickerbocker
    (1809) didn''t know his swans from his starlings, at least not after he had passed
    from his earthly domain into the Elysian Fields. Perhaps, in his translucent shimmering
    ghostly form, he forgot what a swan was, exactly? That is possible, for which
    of us can say with certainty that we will retain our ornithological wisdom beyond
    the grave? But before we chuck brickbats at the dead Washington Irving, there
    is another possibility we can consider. Given that he was communicating from what
    he calls "the spirit world", could it be that the swan-head into which the galvanic
    battery was implanted was the head, not of a swan, but of a spirit-swan? It may
    well be that spirit-swans have graceful heads as well as graceful necks. Alas,
    we cannot put this theory to the test, for just as we are in no position to go
    around beheading spirit-swans, nor do we have the means to make one out of cardboard,
    so far as I am aware. If you know any different, please let me know.

    Whether or not we give Washington Irving in spirit form the benefit of the doubt,
    it remains the fact that wiring up the galvanic battery to the swan''s brain proved
    far too complicated for me. In mitigation, remember that I was working against
    the clock. Though the serum with which the swan had been injected was a powerful
    one, it had to wake from its coma at some point, and I did not want to find myself
    rummaging around in its head, tugging at wires and at bits of its brain, when
    it regained consciousness. Do you have any idea how implacable can be the ferocity
    of a swan, even in circumstances less likely to provoke its cygnate wrath?

    So I am afraid it is back to the drawing-board. We have successfully inserted
    a galvanic battery in a swan''s not remotely graceful head, lodged against its
    brain, but a fat lot of good that will do us if we cannot connect them up. I am
    currently investigating possible wireless methods, and will let you know as soon
    as I have something further to report.'
