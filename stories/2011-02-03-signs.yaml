  text: "Outa_Spaceman's cardboard signage initiative continues. Last time I mentioned\
    \ it was to celebrate seven signs in seven days. Now we are in February and the\
    \ Bonkers Man o\u2019 Bognor remains indefatigable. His latest is an interesting\
    \ exercise in samizdat blog advertising, extolling the virtues of the Wartime\
    \ Housewife, a sentiment which I wholeheartedly endorse.\n\nNOTE\_: The title\
    \ of this postage should not be thought to refer to the ridiculous M Night Shamalamawopbopdadoowop\
    \ film of the same name\u2014\_though I am reminded that it contains antisemitic\
    \ Roman Catholic drunkard Melvin Gibson's finest screen moment. His family is\
    \ terrified at the prospect that the appearance of crop circles could be a harbinger\
    \ for the arrival of woefully unconvincing green scaly alien beings, so Mr Gibson\
    \ says: \u201CEverybody needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something\u201D\
    . This has become our watchword at Hooting Yard, so much more resonant than the\
    \ blunt \u201CKeep Calm And Carry On\u201D recently revived by all and sundry."
