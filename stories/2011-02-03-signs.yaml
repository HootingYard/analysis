  text: 'Outa_Spaceman''s cardboard signage initiative continues. Last time I mentioned
    it was to celebrate seven signs in seven days. Now we are in February and the
    Bonkers Man o'' Bognor remains indefatigable. His latest is an interesting exercise
    in samizdat blog advertising, extolling the virtues of the Wartime Housewife,
    a sentiment which I wholeheartedly endorse.


    NOTE : The title of this postage should not be thought to refer to the ridiculous
    M Night Shamalamawopbopdadoowop film of the same name-- though I am reminded that
    it contains antisemitic Roman Catholic drunkard Melvin Gibson''s finest screen
    moment. His family is terrified at the prospect that the appearance of crop circles
    could be a harbinger for the arrival of woefully unconvincing green scaly alien
    beings, so Mr Gibson says: "Everybody needs to calm down and eat some fruit or
    something". This has become our watchword at Hooting Yard, so much more resonant
    than the blunt "Keep Calm And Carry On" recently revived by all and sundry.'
