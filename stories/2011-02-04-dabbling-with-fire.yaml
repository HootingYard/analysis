    In my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, you will be able to discover the causes
    of thousands of mid-nineteenth-century fires in an unnamed bailiwick served by
    "the Brigade". Prometheus was never so busy a bee, nor so inventive. Salutary
    warnings are implicit in this list, and I recommend you keep a watchful eye on
    your monkey, your monkey''s nuts, your cargo of lime, your sewing, your rats and
    your ants.
