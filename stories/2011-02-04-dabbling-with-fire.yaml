  text: "\nIn my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, you will be able to discover the\
    \ causes of thousands of mid-nineteenth-century fires in an unnamed bailiwick\
    \ served by \u201Cthe Brigade\u201D. Prometheus was never so busy a bee, nor so\
    \ inventive. Salutary warnings are implicit in this list, and I recommend you\
    \ keep a watchful eye on your monkey, your monkey's nuts, your cargo of lime,\
    \ your sewing, your rats and your ants.\n"
