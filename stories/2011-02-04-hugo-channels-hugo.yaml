  text: 'Another snippet from Marina Warner''s Phantasmagoria : Spirit Visions, Metaphors,
    And Media Into The Twenty-First Century (2006):

    "After the death of his much loved daughter Leopoldine in a drowning accident,
    Victor Hugo became very involved in table-turning, planchette or Ouija board experiments,
    and other means of contacting spirits. Leopoldine frequently spoke to him. But
    he also began receiving copious messages from all kinds of visitors, including
    Dante, Galileo, and Voltaire, and even ''the Ocean'', who held forth to the company
    in an astonishing outpouring of rhetorical bombast scattered with furious expletives.
    Some of the communications passed straight into print. As someone observed at
    the time, ''Victor Hugo was channelling Victor Hugo''."'
