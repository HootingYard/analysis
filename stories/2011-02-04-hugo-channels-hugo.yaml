  text: "Another snippet from Marina Warner's Phantasmagoria\_: Spirit Visions, Metaphors,\
    \ And Media Into The Twenty-First Century (2006):\n\u201CAfter the death of his\
    \ much loved daughter L\xE9opoldine in a drowning accident, Victor Hugo became\
    \ very involved in table-turning, planchette or Ouija board experiments, and other\
    \ means of contacting spirits. L\xE9opoldine frequently spoke to him. But he also\
    \ began receiving copious messages from all kinds of visitors, including Dante,\
    \ Galileo, and Voltaire, and even \u2018the Ocean\u2019, who held forth to the\
    \ company in an astonishing outpouring of rhetorical bombast scattered with furious\
    \ expletives. Some of the communications passed straight into print. As someone\
    \ observed at the time, \u2018Victor Hugo was channelling Victor Hugo\u2019.\u201D"
