  text: There was a gleam in the eye of the fruiterer. His dog was worrying a toffee
    apple wrapper in the drain. He sold me a Carlsbad plum. He was a travelling fruiterer,
    and he soon went on his way, swinging his basket. The dog did not immediately
    follow. Some yards along the lane, the fruiterer stopped, and turned his head,
    and called out to the dog. The dog's name was Flaps. "Here, Flaps!" cried the
    travelling fruiterer, in a rich baritone that would have done him credit on the
    stage. Flaps relinquished the toffee apple wrapper and scampered towards his master,
    and continued beyond him, along the lane, panting. I have no idea what sort of
    dog it was. It was soon out of sight, but the fruiterer did not appear at all
    worried. He, too, continued on his way, more slowly than his dog. On the spur
    of the moment I decided I wanted to buy a second Carlsbad plum. I got up from
    the laneside bench on which I had been sitting and followed the fruiterer. I did
    not call out to him, for the simple reason that I am mute. When I was but tiny
    I was witness to an abomination. You can draw your own inference from that pair
    of snippets. In any case, I am sure the travelling fruiterer is a more interesting
    "character" than I am. With the gleam in his eye and his theatrical voice and
    his swinging basket and his dog, Flaps, he is the type to gain attention, whether
    he wishes to or no. I, by contrast, could have sat all day upon the bench without
    attracting the attention of passing persons or dogs or, above, birds. The fruiterer
    himself would have strode on past oblivious had I not hailed him and brought him
    to a halt to buy my Carlsbad plum. Voiceless, my hailing method was to flail my
    arms, or to wave a stick. Now, to buy, as an afterthought, a second Carlsbad plum,
    I had to catch up with him further along the lane, so I sprinted. Doing so took
    me back, in reverie, to my youth, when I won many a medal, running round and round
    an athletics track, wearing a singlet to which bold numbers were attached, both
    front and back. I usually wore the number nine. I am older and creakier now and
    I was puffed out by the time I came alongside the travelling fruiterer. Panting,
    like Flaps, I slowed to match the fruiterer's pace. I held aloft the Carlsbad
    plum I had already bought, and with my other hand pointed at the fruiterer's basket,
    and by some other signals made plain to him that I wanted to buy a second Carlsbad
    plum. To effect this transaction, we both stopped dead on the lane. Looking up
    ahead, I saw Flaps micturating against the trunk of a lonely yew. The fruiterer
    handed me a second Carlsbad plum and in turn I gave him some coinage. There was
    still a gleam in his eye, a gleam so resplendent it dazzled me. One is seldom
    dazzled by fruiterers, in this day and age. Lord knows how much water Flaps had
    lapped from his bowl, or from a rill, that morning, for even as I was bedazzled
    by the fruiterer's gleam I saw out of the corner of my eye that his dog continued
    to expel a stream of piss against the yew, in an unstoppable flow. I worried he
    might poison the roots. The yew would wither, and woodsmen with axes would come
    to chop it down, and it would all be the fault of Flaps, and by extension, of
    the fruiterer. Would his eye still gleam, when, in a far town, a year hence, he
    sat at a tavern table drinking his pot, and read in the local paper of the shrivelled
    and felled yew tree, and cast his mind back to that summer's morning, when he
    sold a brace of Carlsbad plums to a mute, and Flaps relieved himself, his jet
    of canine piss powerful and prolonged, drenching the trunk of that very yew, sinking
    and seeping through the soil, withering the roots?
