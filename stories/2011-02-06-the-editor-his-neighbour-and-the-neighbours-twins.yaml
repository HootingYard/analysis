  text: "After reading this post at ZMKC, it seemed like a good idea to familiarise\
    \ myself with the work of Honor Tracy. Here is a quick character sketch (of Desmond\
    \ Marjoribanks, editor of Torch, \u201Csome new dynamic weekly that's going to\
    \ teach us all how to live\u201D) from her novel A Number Of Things (1960):\n\u201C\
    He was a man of about forty with a lofty brow made loftier by hastily retiring\
    \ hair, and the wide thin mouth, the nutcracker nose and chin that often go with\
    \ large progressive views: his light blue eyes positively glared with love of\
    \ humanity, his nostrils expanded and deflated with enthusiasm like those of a\
    \ passionate horse. He dearly loved resolutions, workers\u2019 councils, committees,\
    \ monster rallies, his children and his second wife. His first wife had thrown\
    \ herself under a train.\u201D\nHis downstairs neighbour, Orlando Figgis, has\
    \ twin children named Summerskill and Hallucination. I suspect I am going to enjoy\
    \ this book."
