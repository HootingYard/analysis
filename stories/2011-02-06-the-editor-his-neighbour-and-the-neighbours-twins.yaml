  text: 'After reading this post at ZMKC, it seemed like a good idea to familiarise
    myself with the work of Honor Tracy. Here is a quick character sketch (of Desmond
    Marjoribanks, editor of Torch, "some new dynamic weekly that''s going to teach
    us all how to live") from her novel A Number Of Things (1960):

    "He was a man of about forty with a lofty brow made loftier by hastily retiring
    hair, and the wide thin mouth, the nutcracker nose and chin that often go with
    large progressive views: his light blue eyes positively glared with love of humanity,
    his nostrils expanded and deflated with enthusiasm like those of a passionate
    horse. He dearly loved resolutions, workers'' councils, committees, monster rallies,
    his children and his second wife. His first wife had thrown herself under a train."

    His downstairs neighbour, Orlando Figgis, has twin children named Summerskill
    and Hallucination. I suspect I am going to enjoy this book.'
