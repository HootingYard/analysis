  text: 'Tell me, if you will, for what conceivable reason you would snap off the
    horn of a goat, cram it with exotic fruits and flowers, and present it as a gift
    to the maimed goat? That is one version of the origin of the horn of plenty, or
    cornucopia, and it seems to me an example of where the Greek Gods got things decidedly
    skew-whiff.

    Presenting a goat with a gift, whether in recompense for its injury or out of
    simple generosity, is a perfectly legitimate act, though it would probably be
    content with leaves and nettles. My concern here is not with the goat but with
    the horn of plenty.

    Put yourself, for a moment, in the position of the recipient. (You need not be
    an actual, or mythical, goat in this scenario.) Zeus, or some other donor, hands
    you a cornucopia.

    "Why thank you! That is so kind!" you chirrup, having been well brought up.

    "You are most welcome," says Zeus or the Zeusy figure, who can now vanish, their
    part in this little playlet fulfilled.

    You are left holding a receptacle stuffed with fruits and flowers, but any warm
    feelings of gratitude you may have are immediately overcast by the realisation
    that such is the shape of the container you cannot put it down safely. Unlike
    a vase or a bowl or a jug, wrought by human agency, the horn of a goat is not
    designed to be placed on a flat surface such as a coffee table or sideboard, the
    sorts of places where you are likely to want to put a gift of fruits and flowers.
    It will simply topple over, disgorging its contents, some of which, such as apples
    and Carlsbad plums, will roll off the coffee table or sideboard on to the floor,
    where they are likely to be bruised, crushed underfoot, or worse, gnawed or swallowed
    whole by your domestic pet, depending, that is, on the size and rapacity of said
    pet. Even those fruits and flowers which remain atop the coffee table or sideboard
    will be scattered and possibly damaged by their scatterment, and in any event,
    the charming visual arrangement of the cornucopia will be ruined. So although
    you will be happy to have been given lovely fruits and flowers, and in such abundance!,
    a moment''s reflection will lead you to dark mutterings that the form in which
    they have been given is both unsuitable and inconvenient.

    For unless you are going to spend the whole day cradling the goat''s horn in your
    arms, keeping it upright, thus frittering away the hours when you could be doing
    something useful, you are now forced to find some way of relinquishing the cornucopia
    while keeping it intact. You could try leaning it up against something, but there
    is no guarantee that in doing so it will retain stability. Alternatively, you
    may have a vase or bowl or jug of sufficient size that the horn of the goat can
    be placed within it, snugly enough not to fall over. A third option is to remove
    the fruits and flowers one by one, with care, and to marshal them in attractive
    display at an appropriate place in your hovel. Of course, once that is done you
    are left holding an emptied goat horn, which you may as well toss aside as worthless.

    Whichever of these strategies you employ, my point is that any gratitude you feel
    towards Zeus, or to whomsoever gave you the cornucopia, will not be unalloyed.
    There will be an admixture of irritation or resentment, even of active hostility,
    for the hoops you have been put through. When the time comes to write a thank
    you letter, as your exquisite manners demand, it may be hard to refrain from injecting
    a somewhat jaundiced tone which, if picked up by the cornucopia donor, could lead
    to ill-will between the pair of you, even to the utter sundering of the ties of
    friendship which have bound you so close over many years. And all because the
    fruits and flowers came in a container not fit for purpose.'
