  text: "Tell me, if you will, for what conceivable reason you would snap off the\
    \ horn of a goat, cram it with exotic fruits and flowers, and present it as a\
    \ gift to the maimed goat? That is one version of the origin of the horn of plenty,\
    \ or cornucopia, and it seems to me an example of where the Greek Gods got things\
    \ decidedly skew-whiff.\nPresenting a goat with a gift, whether in recompense\
    \ for its injury or out of simple generosity, is a perfectly legitimate act, though\
    \ it would probably be content with leaves and nettles. My concern here is not\
    \ with the goat but with the horn of plenty.\nPut yourself, for a moment, in the\
    \ position of the recipient. (You need not be an actual, or mythical, goat in\
    \ this scenario.) Zeus, or some other donor, hands you a cornucopia.\n\u201CWhy\
    \ thank you! That is so kind!\u201D you chirrup, having been well brought up.\n\
    \u201CYou are most welcome,\u201D says Zeus or the Zeusy figure, who can now vanish,\
    \ their part in this little playlet fulfilled.\nYou are left holding a receptacle\
    \ stuffed with fruits and flowers, but any warm feelings of gratitude you may\
    \ have are immediately overcast by the realisation that such is the shape of the\
    \ container you cannot put it down safely. Unlike a vase or a bowl or a jug, wrought\
    \ by human agency, the horn of a goat is not designed to be placed on a flat surface\
    \ such as a coffee table or sideboard, the sorts of places where you are likely\
    \ to want to put a gift of fruits and flowers. It will simply topple over, disgorging\
    \ its contents, some of which, such as apples and Carlsbad plums, will roll off\
    \ the coffee table or sideboard on to the floor, where they are likely to be bruised,\
    \ crushed underfoot, or worse, gnawed or swallowed whole by your domestic pet,\
    \ depending, that is, on the size and rapacity of said pet. Even those fruits\
    \ and flowers which remain atop the coffee table or sideboard will be scattered\
    \ and possibly damaged by their scatterment, and in any event, the charming visual\
    \ arrangement of the cornucopia will be ruined. So although you will be happy\
    \ to have been given lovely fruits and flowers, and in such abundance!, a moment's\
    \ reflection will lead you to dark mutterings that the form in which they have\
    \ been given is both unsuitable and inconvenient.\nFor unless you are going to\
    \ spend the whole day cradling the goat's horn in your arms, keeping it upright,\
    \ thus frittering away the hours when you could be doing something useful, you\
    \ are now forced to find some way of relinquishing the cornucopia while keeping\
    \ it intact. You could try leaning it up against something, but there is no guarantee\
    \ that in doing so it will retain stability. Alternatively, you may have a vase\
    \ or bowl or jug of sufficient size that the horn of the goat can be placed within\
    \ it, snugly enough not to fall over. A third option is to remove the fruits and\
    \ flowers one by one, with care, and to marshal them in attractive display at\
    \ an appropriate place in your hovel. Of course, once that is done you are left\
    \ holding an emptied goat horn, which you may as well toss aside as worthless.\n\
    Whichever of these strategies you employ, my point is that any gratitude you feel\
    \ towards Zeus, or to whomsoever gave you the cornucopia, will not be unalloyed.\
    \ There will be an admixture of irritation or resentment, even of active hostility,\
    \ for the hoops you have been put through. When the time comes to write a thank\
    \ you letter, as your exquisite manners demand, it may be hard to refrain from\
    \ injecting a somewhat jaundiced tone which, if picked up by the cornucopia donor,\
    \ could lead to ill-will between the pair of you, even to the utter sundering\
    \ of the ties of friendship which have bound you so close over many years. And\
    \ all because the fruits and flowers came in a container not fit for purpose."
