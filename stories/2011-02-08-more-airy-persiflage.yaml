  text: 'Over at Airy Persiflage, Walter O''Hara--known to his friends as Mister Nizz--gives
    a fine rendition of "I Had A Hammer". I am very fond of the grain of his voice,
    which has the curious quality of making me believe every word of what he tells
    me. There is also a pleasingly ramshackle air to his podcast, as if he has simply
    plopped himself down in front of a microphone for a few minutes in between feeding
    the hens or fixing the roof. (I should make it plain here that I am wholly unacquainted
    with Mr O''Hara and have no idea how he spends his days.)

    Links to his earlier readings from the Hooting Yard Treasury O'' Prose can be
    found here.'
