  text: 'It is quite something to witness tongues of pentecostal fire lapping and
    flickering around the head of a monoglot, quite something indeed. And then to
    hear the monoglot babble in languages previously unknown to him, that is even
    more extraordinary. There has been but one disappointment, thus far, in the course
    of my experiments, and it is that not one of the languages inspired by the flames
    is identifiable as a genuine foreign tongue.

    When I decided to embark upon this important religio-linguistic hoo-hah, a year
    ago, my first step was to have constructed for me, by decent honest tradesmen,
    a chamber, the ceiling of which was so designed that serried ranks of Bunsen burners
    could be installed in it, pointing downwards. It was not enough, you see, that
    the heads of my monoglots be lapped by flames. Being of pentecostal fire, the
    flames must descend from on high, upon the heads below. I next had to make adjustments
    to the burners themselves. Much as I would like to, I cannot divulge the exact
    nature of my tweakings and tinkerings. Suffice to say that my assistants at this
    stage were not the decent honest tradesmen but figures plucked from various ranks
    in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, plus a couple of fire scientists. Well I knew
    that ordinary flames could hardly be expected to prompt a monoglot to speak in
    a foreign language. My burners must blast forth true pentecostal fire.

    Obtaining an old reel-to-reel tape recorder to keep a permanent record of the
    languages uttered by my test subjects was a simple enough matter. There is a boy
    with a barrow in the marketplace from whom such items can be bought. I purchased
    two, just to be on the safe side, and a mountain of reels of magnetic tape.

    The beadle at Pang Hill Orphanage was of immense help to me in procuring volunteers.
    He gave me his personal guarantee that each one of them was a monoglot, and I
    never had reason to doubt his word, especially when I saw the grubby drooling
    halfwit urchins he regularly delivered to me on his cart, drawn by horses as inelegant
    as his cargo. Indeed, it was a wonder to me that some among these tatterdemalion
    hobbledehoys had ever mastered their mother tongue.

    Ushered into the chamber, where the reel-to-reel tape recorders were already whirring
    away, each volunteer was strapped into a chair. Nothing if not rigorous, I had
    each of them utter a few words, to provide recorded evidence of their spoken language
    before the pentecostal fire was unleashed upon them. Some had to be prompted to
    speak by being poked at with sticks. I owe a debt of gratitude to my hunchbacked
    assistant Mungo for expediting this part of the process.

    Mungo and I then left the chamber, locking and bolting the door behind us, and
    fastening it further with a length of heavy iron chain. I took my place in an
    armchair, while Mungo scrambled up on to the roof of the chamber in his spidery
    way and set the Bunsen burners roaring, spitting out pentecostal fire upon the
    heads of my monoglot volunteers.

    On the following day, the beadle came rolling up in his cart to collect the newly-minted
    polyglots, taking some back to Pang Hill Orphanage, some to a clinic discreetly
    hidden in the mountains, and some to the graveyard. With Mungo at my side, I transcribed
    the recorded utterances from the tapes while snacking on loganberries and fried
    dab.

    I have now filled thousands upon thousands of pages with polyglot speech inspired
    by pentecostal fire, and every single word of it is incomprehensible babble and
    raving. But if I have not my faith, I have nothing. I know, deep in my holy bones,
    that sooner or later one of my little orphan volunteers is going to pipe up in
    pure unalloyed Swedish, or Tagalog, or Vlaams. For through the pentecostal flames
    speaks the Spirit. If, thus far, it has not made clear its intentions for the
    people of the earth, prattling gibberish instead of sense, then I must wait, wait
    with inhuman patience, and continue to funnel monoglots into my chamber, and have
    Mungo set the burners in the ceiling belching fire down below.'
