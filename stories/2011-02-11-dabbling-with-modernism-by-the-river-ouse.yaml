  text: '

    This week in The Dabbler I conduct a long-overdue inquiry into the death of Virginia
    Woolf. If everything goes according to plan, this should be the first in a series
    of inquiries into the deaths of the great modernists, a necessary step, surely,
    into any proper understanding of postmodernism. I have convinced myself that,
    once I fully grasp every last little detail of the deaths of the modernists, I
    will be in a much better position to winkle some meaning out of the endless clogged
    blather of standard po-mo prose. Some would say it is not worth the effort, and
    they are probably correct, so perhaps I ought to put the whole project into a
    dustbin or wastepaper basket. What a quandary!'
