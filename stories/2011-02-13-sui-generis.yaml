  text: 'There is a simple explanation for the quietness which has stolen over your
    favourite website in the past few days. I have been immersing myself in the films
    of Guy Maddin, for me the greatest living genius working in cinema. I first enthused
    about him here in the summer of 2008, when I saw Brand Upon The Brain! and I am
    now, through the magic of Het Internet, catching up with as much of his work as
    I can.

    For all the echoes of early cinema, his films are sui generis. His is an absolutely
    individual talent, to the point where one could say a single shot could not be
    mistaken for the work of another director. Melodrama, ice hockey, sexual obsession,
    Winnipeg, dreams, amnesia... just some of the joys of a Guy Maddin film. And let
    us not forget that he can be deliriously funny.

    Here is Odin''s Shield Maiden, a short from 2007.'
