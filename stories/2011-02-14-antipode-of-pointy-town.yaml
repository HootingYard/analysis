  text: "As an adjunct to my Maddinathon, I investigated the work of Guy Maddin's\
    \ old mucker in the Winnipeg Film Group, John Paizs. Paizs directed, among other\
    \ films, Top Of The Food Chain (1999), a highly amusing homage to 1950s alien\
    \ invasion movies.\nI mention it here because it is a film that can be watched\
    \ with real pleasure by those of us bored to tears by those endless examples of\
    \ what one critic has dubbed \u201Cthe cinema of Pointy Town\u201D. Indeed, one\
    \ could get no further from Pointy Town than the setting of a key scene, where\
    \ the atomic scientist Dr Karel Lamonte (who works at the Atomic Academy) reports:\
    \ \u201CWe found the remains of a dead human corpse, deceased, in the hilly, lumpy,\
    \ bumpy part of town outside of town.\u201D\nAs if to drive home the anti-Pointy\
    \ Town point, the \u201Clumpy, bumpy part of town outside of town\u201D is pointedly\
    \ mentioned several times.\nHooting Yard Rating\_: dozens upon dozens of bright\
    \ pointy stars."
