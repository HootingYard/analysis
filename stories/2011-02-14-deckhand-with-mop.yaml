  text: 'Deckhand With Mop is a large nautical portrait, done in emulsion, by the
    Royal Academician Chamfer Ticktape. Apart from the vast swathes of brightly-coloured
    emulsion with which it was executed, the notable feature of the painting is the
    hideous countenance of the deckhand--a countenance so hideous that none can look
    upon it without, in an instant, becoming gibberingly insane. In this respect,
    the painting is akin to some fatuous melodramatic incident in a story by H P Lovecraft.
    Yet the effect of that hideous deckhand''s countenance is, regrettably, all too
    real, as a brief visit to the locked ward of the grim bleak windswept granite
    asylum, perched on the hillside, makes clear. There one will find, gibbering and
    insane, a gaggle of art critics and newspaper hacks who were present at the painting''s
    unveiling.

    But what of Chamfer Ticktape himself? How did he paint, in swathes of brightly-coloured
    emulsion, the hideous countenance of the deckhand, without himself succumbing
    to gibbering, and to insanity? For years, the noted Royal Academician has refused
    to speak of his painting, referring all enquiries to his PR toady, a master of
    obfuscatory fol-de-rol. At various times, this slippery fellow has hinted either
    that the artist was blindfolded as he painted, or that his brain was protected
    by a mysterious carapace, or that he prepared a "painting-by-numbers" grid and
    directed the execution from behind a screen, his assistants then being carted
    off one by one to the very same grim bleak windswept granite asylum, perched on
    the hillside, where they are kept in a separate wing, also locked, in which they
    gibber insanely while sucking on wafers. Not one of these tales is likely to be
    true. Some say the deckhand is a self-portrait of the painter, but how could that
    be? Chamfer Ticktape is a man-about-town, sweeping in and out of fashionable restaurants
    and nightspots, in cape and muffler, pursued by paparazzi, and he does not leave
    in his wake a trail of the gibbering and insane.

    My own theory is that, when viewing this gigantic painting, done in emulsion,
    one must keep one''s eyes fixed steadily on the mop, the mop, the mop!'
