  text: "A highlight of the Hooting Yard year is the annual jamboree jointly organised\
    \ by the Sawdust Bridge Community Pole-Vaulting Collective and the Pointy Town\
    \ Avant-Colliery Marching Band. Sebastian Coe may have described tickets for the\
    \ 2012 Olympics as \u201Cthe greatest tickets on earth\u201D, but clearly he has\
    \ never seen a jamboree ticket, a thing of unsurpassed beauty not just on earth,\
    \ but on any other planet or planetoid or flaming ball of gas in the known or\
    \ unknown universe. Had he done so, he would eat his hat, with knobs on. It may\
    \ look like a mere slip of thin beige cardboard with a few letters and numbers\
    \ printed upon it in bold black ink, but this year, as every year, the jamboree\
    \ ticket was designed by the noted ticketist Rex Tick, a man who knows more than\
    \ Sebastian Coe could ever learn about the design of tickets, had he but world\
    \ enough and time. And he has not, for all those naked wrestling bouts with William\
    \ Hague in a basement gymnasium at the Palace of Westminster have taken their\
    \ toll, and now he is reduced to uttering hyperbolic twaddle whene'er a broadcaster's\
    \ microphone is thrust towards his gob.\nThe gob of noted ticketist Rex Tick,\
    \ however, is taciturn. He is a taciturn fellow. In fact, one wit dubbed Tick\
    \ \u201Cthe taciturn ticketist\u201D on precisely that account. The fruit of his\
    \ taciturnity is the unparalleled beauty of his ticket designs. Every year he\
    \ comes up with something of such blinding glory that some foppish aesthetes have\
    \ been known to buy a ticket without any intention of attending the annual jamboree,\
    \ in that squelchy, squelchy mud-strewn field. No, the dandies put their ticket\
    \ in a frame and hang it on the wall of their boudoir or salon, to impress their\
    \ equally foppish pals with the exquisite delicacy of their sensibilities. So\
    \ I am told, at any rate, by Rex Tick's sister, the vamp Dot Tick, who has been\
    \ seen \u201Cstepping out\u201D with an art critic or two.\nBut the tickets are\
    \ not the only things of eye-popping splendour on show at the jamboree. When they\
    \ come vaulting into view from across Sawdust Bridge, the athletes of the Community\
    \ Pole-Vaulting Collective display, on their jerkins, insignia designed by the\
    \ noted heraldic emblemist Rex Blem. Consisting of three Bobnits rampant engrailed\
    \ azure on a field gules, with boisson gingembre lashant, sewn into place over\
    \ their pounding hearts, the emblem has thrice won the Top Pole-Vaulting Club\
    \ Insignia Cup awarded by the Academy Of Pole-Vaulting And Bird-Spotting And Shilly-Shallying\
    \ (Sawdust Bridge Branch). Rex Blem himself has never turned up to accept the\
    \ cup, for he is a recluse with a fear of cups. According to his sister, the flapper\
    \ Dot Blem, the great insigniaist drinks his tea from a flask, and has his boiled\
    \ eggs balanced in a contraption of wire and rubber bands and balsa wood.\nIt\
    \ comes as something of a surprise to learn that the avant-miners of the Avant-Colliery\
    \ Marching Band from Pointy Town have no insignia of their own. They seem happy\
    \ enough to have co-opted the generic Pointy Town badge, emblazoned on the backs\
    \ of their helmets. What they lack in visual zip, however, is more than made up\
    \ for by their musical prowess. With their tubas and xylophones and oompah-parpers,\
    \ they march across the bridge in the wake of the pole-vaulters, playing a repertoire\
    \ including Scriabin, Arnold Bax, transcriptions from field recordings of howler\
    \ monkeys, and Kinnie The Explorer.\nThe field in which the howler monkeys were\
    \ recorded is, of course, a very different field from the squelchy, squelchy mud-strewn\
    \ one in which the jamboree takes place when the Community Pole-Vaulting Collective\
    \ and the Avant-Colliery Marching Band have crossed the bridge and successfully\
    \ negotiated their way past the heavily-armed sentries. Drawn exclusively from\
    \ the ranks of the most sociopathic cadets, the sentries have their own insignia\
    \ and their own music, buzzed directly into their ears by transmitters which pick\
    \ up signals from the netherworld. Ticketholders have nothing to fear from the\
    \ sentries, but woe betide the fool who tries to skulk past their concrete huts\
    \ ticketless. What do you think is the reason for that line of heads impaled on\
    \ spikes, stretching as far as the eye can see?\nThanks to Roland for the Community\
    \ Pole-Vaulting Collective (and insignia) and to Robin for the Avant-Colliery\
    \ Marching Band."
