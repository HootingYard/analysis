  text: 'When Sebastian Coe spoke of "the greatest tickets on earth", he was talking
    twaddle, but at least it was amusing twaddle. Too often, the twaddle babbled by
    politicians and others is composed of readymade phrases seemingly used to fill
    time--or, in written form, space--without the inconvenience of thought.

    One practice that has become ubiquitous is an inability to say "diverse" without
    immediately adding "vibrant". The most recent culprit I noted was the cabinet
    minister Francis Maude, on last week''s Question Time. Having told us how great
    it was that the country is "diverse", and not really knowing what else he wanted
    to say, after a very brief pause he added "and vibrant", clearly playing for time.

    Similarly, the front page headline on a recent issue of my local council''s Pravda-style
    newspaper was a quote from a resident announcing "I love that the borough is so
    diverse and vibrant".

    Can one be diverse without being vibrant? Or vibrant without being diverse? And,
    if interrogated, chained to a chair in a dank basement, could most of the people
    trotting out this stuff define what they actually mean by "vibrant"?

    Hooting Yard--it''s diverse! It vibrates!'
