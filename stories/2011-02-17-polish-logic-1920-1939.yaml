  text: 'There used to be a library cataloguing methodology called the Dewey Decimal
    System, which could result in books with enormously long references: A.832.102.098/67
    might be an example. Instead, every book fanatic knows that the quaint, humane
    system used in the London Library is much clearer: all the interesting stuff is
    in Science and Miscellaneous and arranged alphabetically. Fruit Farming follows
    Flagellation.

    Thus Stephen Bayley, in the Telegraph, while bemoaning the decimalisation of our
    currency forty years ago. The London Library''s idiosyncratic approach to cataloguing
    is indeed a thing of wonder, as the juxtaposition in this photograph shows.
