  text: My brother has started a blog, and his second postage is an interesting anecdote
    about air raid sirens. I would ask all Hooting Yard readers to go and read it,
    to leave comments, and to bookmark the site or subscribe to it. That way, he may
    be encouraged to post more often than once a month.
