text: My brother has started a blog, and his second postage is an interesting anecdote
  about air raid sirens. I would ask all Hooting Yard readers to go and read it, to
  leave comments, and to bookmark the site or subscribe to it. That way, he may be
  encouraged to post more often than once a month.
