    Where would you like to live? At the top of a lighthouse erected on the grassy
    knoll.

    What would your super power be? The sending forth of lightning bolts from the
    tips of my little fingers.

    If you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose? Feudal
    serfdom.

    Who would play you in the film of your life? The great god Pan.

    Who would you invite to your dream dinner party? Trembling underlings.

    What is your must unappealing habit? Affectionately mussing the hair of trembling
    underlings in moments of weakness.

    What is your favourite book? Popsy The Pig And The Ipsy Dipsy Lobster by Prudence
    Foxglove.

    What would be your fancy dress costume of choice? Tar and feathers. Or just tar.

    What is the worst thing anyone''s said to you? "O maestro, I beg of you, please
    have mercy on my immortal soul!"

    What do you owe your parents? My parents died in an avalanche on the day I was

    Which words or phrases do you most overuse? Look on my works, ye weedy, and despair!

    If you could edit your past, what would you change? My bouffant would be more
    majestic.

    When did you last cry, and why? I weep whenever I hear the innocent laughter of
    children.

    How do you relax? Pulling the legs off flies.

    What song would you like played at your funeral? Something German and argumentative
    and shouty and improvised.

    What is the most important lesson life has taught you? That should be rephrased
    as "what is the most important lesson you have taught life?"

    Tell us a secret. I owe the majesty of my bouffant to L''Oreal''s light reflecting
    booster technology.'
