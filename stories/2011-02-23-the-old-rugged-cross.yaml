  text: 'On top of the hill, hidden behind a line of pines, stands the old rugged
    cross, to the foot of which is tethered a wolf which, when night comes down and
    the stars come out, begins to howl, and howls until the dawn.

    As dawn breaks, up the slope of the hill toils the village wolfman, with his bucket
    of slaughtered squirrels and hamsters and mice, food for the wolf. He empties
    the bucket at the foot of the old rugged cross and while the wolf gobbles down
    its breakfast, he strides in his wolfman''s boots to the rill, and dips the bucket
    in, collecting water for the wolf. When the wolf has eaten its fill and slurped
    up all the water it wants from the bucket, back down the hill goes the wolfman,
    having first given a few tugs to the tether, to test its strength.

    In the village tavern the wolfman reports to the villagers on the strength of
    the tether and the health of the wolf.

    "And the old rugged cross?" asks a villager, "Hangs Christ upon it still?"

    "He does," replies the wolfman, lying through his teeth. And he takes up his pot
    of hooch and drains it, and bangs the empty pot upon the tavern table.

    Up on the hill, the wolf sleeps in the shadow of the old rugged cross, upon which
    hangs not Christ, but the carcass of a demon, beset by midges, bluebottles and
    flies.'
