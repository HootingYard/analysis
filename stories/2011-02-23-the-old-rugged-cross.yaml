  text: "On top of the hill, hidden behind a line of pines, stands the old rugged\
    \ cross, to the foot of which is tethered a wolf which, when night comes down\
    \ and the stars come out, begins to howl, and howls until the dawn.\nAs dawn breaks,\
    \ up the slope of the hill toils the village wolfman, with his bucket of slaughtered\
    \ squirrels and hamsters and mice, food for the wolf. He empties the bucket at\
    \ the foot of the old rugged cross and while the wolf gobbles down its breakfast,\
    \ he strides in his wolfman's boots to the rill, and dips the bucket in, collecting\
    \ water for the wolf. When the wolf has eaten its fill and slurped up all the\
    \ water it wants from the bucket, back down the hill goes the wolfman, having\
    \ first given a few tugs to the tether, to test its strength.\nIn the village\
    \ tavern the wolfman reports to the villagers on the strength of the tether and\
    \ the health of the wolf.\n\u201CAnd the old rugged cross?\u201D asks a villager,\
    \ \u201CHangs Christ upon it still?\u201D\n\u201CHe does,\u201D replies the wolfman,\
    \ lying through his teeth. And he takes up his pot of hooch and drains it, and\
    \ bangs the empty pot upon the tavern table.\nUp on the hill, the wolf sleeps\
    \ in the shadow of the old rugged cross, upon which hangs not Christ, but the\
    \ carcass of a demon, beset by midges, bluebottles and flies."
