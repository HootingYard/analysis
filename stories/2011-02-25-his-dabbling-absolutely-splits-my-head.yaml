  text: "\nYou will need to read Key's Cupboard in The Dabbler with particular care\
    \ this week. I am planning to use each of the phrases listed therein as the punchline\
    \ of a spectacularly well-crafted and hilarious joke, each joke to form one chapter\
    \ of a spectacularly well-crafted and hilarious comic novel. The critics will\
    \ be helpless with laughter, and I shall be awarded laurels.\nThat, at any rate,\
    \ is the plan. If it has a flaw\u2014oh, and it does! it does!\u2014it is that\
    \ I am not much of a gag-writer. So that is where you lot come in. Readers are\
    \ invited to provide me with jokes to which the lines listed in the cupboard are\
    \ the perfect, irresistible punchlines. I will then cobble them all together into\
    \ the funniest novel ever written.\nNaturally, I will take full credit, to make\
    \ certain of getting those laurels wrapped around my head. Your reward, and it\
    \ is a fine one, will rest in the knowledge that your wit and hilarity is represented\
    \ by a laurel leaf touching the bonce of Mr Key. Whingers and ingrates may be\
    \ further placated by having their names scribbled on the leaves with non-permanent\
    \ marker pens. I can't say fairer than that, can I?"
