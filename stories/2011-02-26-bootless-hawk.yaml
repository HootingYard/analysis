  text: "It was raining on the moors. Ted was peering through his binoculars at a\
    \ hawk. Suddenly Sylvia appeared. She nudged the binoculars aside and kissed Ted,\
    \ drawing blood.\n\u201COuch!\u201D said Ted, but in a manly way.\n\u201CTalk\
    \ to me about boots and Fascism, Ted\u201D said Sylvia.\n\u201CThat hawk I were\
    \ watching,\u201D said Ted, \u201CThat's a Fascist.\u201D\n\u201CIt's not wearing\
    \ boots,\u201D said Sylvia.\nShe kissed Ted again, drawing more blood, and walked\
    \ off to the cottage.\nLater, done with hawk-watching through binoculars, Ted\
    \ joined her.\n\u201CWhat's thee doing, lass?\u201D he asked, gruffly.\nSylvia\
    \ looked up at him.\n\u201CI am knitting boots for the hawk,\u201D said Sylvia,\
    \ in domestic bliss.\nTed stared out of the window into the rain."
