  text: 'In November 2000, a crew from ABC television descended upon Winnipeg to film
    a biopic called Inside The Osmonds. Guy Maddin inveigled himself onto the set.
    A climactic scene was planned in which the actors playing the popsters would stand
    aside, to be replaced by the real--now aged--Osmonds themselves.

    O-Day at the Walker Theatre. I''m not even the director and I''m dizzy with fear.
    Since late last night, real Osmonds have been flying in from all parts of Utah,
    one by one: Virl, Merrill, Wayne, Jay, et al.--the first Osmond reunion in seventeen
    years! The Winnipeg that awaits them this morning is locked in a cruel dome of
    permafrost--forty degrees below, and twice as cold with windchill! We Winnipeggers
    pride ourselves on  moments like this. Compulsively, we muse about the impact
    our perfrigid town will have on the unsuspecting who visit us. How will the newly
    arrived celebrities cope with being here? Will they be frightened when their nose
    hairs are twisted out by the invisible pincers that stab into one''s nostrils
    at temperatures this low? What will Donny make of that first biting mouthful of
    air outside the airport when the cold rips into his lungs like a swallowed scissor?
    Will he wonder why his eyelids have frozen shut as he gropes towards his limo?
    And what will happen to the real parents, George and Olive, now elderly? Will
    the cold simply kill them? Will they be borne home in coffins, in the chilled
    cargo hold of the same plane that brought them here as warm and loving parents?
