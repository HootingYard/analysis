  text: "Reading P J O'Rourke's Holidays In Hell (1988), I learned that in Communist\
    \ Poland, during the mid-1980s, there was a postpunk band called Garaz w Leeds,\
    \ or, in English, Garage in Leeds. Had they actually hailed from Leeds, or indeed\
    \ from anywhere in the UK, this would have been a terrible, terrible name. But\
    \ precisely because they were languishing behind the Iron Curtain, playing their\
    \ reportedly very gloomy \u201CCold Wave\u201D music, I think this is one of the\
    \ most fantastic band names ever devised. Where are they now, I wonder?\nUPDATE\_\
    : They're on YouTube!"
