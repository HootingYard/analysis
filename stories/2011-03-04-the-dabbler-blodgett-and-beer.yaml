text: "\nOne for the Blodgettists in my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, wherein\
  \ you may find limned the fate awaiting you in the month o\u2019 March. If things\
  \ do not quite turn out as predicted, please note that no legal system in the world\
  \ will convict Blodgett of chicanery, so do not even try to have him hauled before\
  \ a court.\nSpeaking of The Dabbler, beery readers ought to hie on over to this\
  \ postage, in which you get the opportunity to win a case of Bath Ales. In fact,\
  \ you should take part come what may, simply to support the super soaraway Dabbler\
  \ and thus, by extension, Mr Key himself."
