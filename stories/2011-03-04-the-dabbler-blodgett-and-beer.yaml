    One for the Blodgettists in my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, wherein you
    may find limned the fate awaiting you in the month o'' March. If things do not
    quite turn out as predicted, please note that no legal system in the world will
    convict Blodgett of chicanery, so do not even try to have him hauled before a
    court.

    Speaking of The Dabbler, beery readers ought to hie on over to this postage, in
    which you get the opportunity to win a case of Bath Ales. In fact, you should
    take part come what may, simply to support the super soaraway Dabbler and thus,
    by extension, Mr Key himself.'
