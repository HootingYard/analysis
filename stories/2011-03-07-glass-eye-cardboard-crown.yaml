  text: "Charles Johnson:\nAn austere character\u2014he deemed jam \u201Ceffeminate\u201D\
    \ and replaced his lost eye with a glass one from a stuffed albatross\nHis grandson,\
    \ Anthony Brooke:\n[was] supercilious, reluctant to take advice and had displayed\
    \ a tendency to judge officers according to their horoscopes\u2026 The unreliable\
    \ Ranee later alleged that Anthony had been guilty of folie de grandeur, having\
    \ cardboard crowns pinned to his car and ordering traffic to draw aside as he\
    \ approached. Anthony denied this.\nFrom an obituary in the Telegraph, to which\
    \ I was led by Peter Risdon."
