  text: 'Charles Johnson:

    An austere character--he deemed jam "effeminate" and replaced his lost eye with
    a glass one from a stuffed albatross

    His grandson, Anthony Brooke:

    [was] supercilious, reluctant to take advice and had displayed a tendency to judge
    officers according to their horoscopes... The unreliable Ranee later alleged that
    Anthony had been guilty of folie de grandeur, having cardboard crowns pinned to
    his car and ordering traffic to draw aside as he approached. Anthony denied this.

    From an obituary in the Telegraph, to which I was led by Peter Risdon.'
