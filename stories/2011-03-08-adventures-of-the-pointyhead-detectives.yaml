  text: "The pointyhead detectives had very few adventures. Much of their time was\
    \ spent reclining upon divans, cogitating, an activity not conducive to venturesome\
    \ antics. And when not cogitating, they directed most of their energies towards\
    \ the precise disposition of the divans within their so-called deduction chamber,\
    \ an ill-appointed room off a remote corridor on an otherwise deserted storey\
    \ of the police headquarters annexe on the far side of town. Sometimes they determined\
    \ that the divans were best placed in regular geometric formation, at other times\
    \ that they were best scattered higgledy piggledy in the available space. On Easter\
    \ Sundays and other Christian festivals the pointyhead detectives experimented\
    \ with divan-arrangements somewhere between orderly and chaotic. They had never\
    \ been able to settle upon an optimum disposition, for they were only too aware\
    \ that some crimes were best solved with the divans lined up in a row, or in a\
    \ stellar pattern, while other crimes were cracked when the divans were arranged\
    \ haphazardly. The one thing they all agreed upon was the effectiveness of their\
    \ cerebral approach, as pointyhead detectives, reclining upon divans, smoking\
    \ their pipes, looking to the untrained eye as if they were half-asleep and lost\
    \ in lassitude.\nSo when a cub scribbler from Let's Outwit Brainy Criminals! magazine\
    \ was dispatched to police headquarters to interview the pointyhead detectives\
    \ and to write up their adventures for a feature article, he was rapidly plunged\
    \ into despair. There were only so many ways of describing a pointyhead detective\
    \ reclining upon a divan, cogitating, before repeating oneself. Even discussions\
    \ about the disposition of the divans were carried out quietly and thoughtfully\
    \ and without rancour or fist-fights. The scribbler slumped in a corner of the\
    \ deduction chamber and wept salt tears. He went unnoticed by the pointyhead detectives,\
    \ who were sprawled on their divans cogitating about the latest enormity they\
    \ were set to solve, the case of the poisoned well at Poisonwell.\nThe poor weeping\
    \ scribbler was terrified that, unable to craft an exciting piece of prose from\
    \ such unexciting material, he would be dismissed from his position. In those\
    \ parts, at that time, it was the lot of dismissed scribblers to be sent to the\
    \ frontier to dig drainage ditches. What could save him from such a fate? He had\
    \ but one recourse, and that was to rely on the power of his imagination. The\
    \ scribbler hurried back to his cubby and wrote a wholly fictional account of\
    \ the pointyhead detectives.\nFighter jets screamed across the sky as the pointyhead\
    \ detectives teetered on the edge of the erupting volcano, he scribbled. Boiling\
    \ hot lava lapping at their stylish winklepickers, the doughty threesome foursome\
    \ fivesome did doughty derring doings, with much shouting and screaming and ululating,\
    \ but always with a purpose. Evil wrongdoers trembled in their hideaways as the\
    \ pointyhead detectives came crashing down from the volcano at inhuman speed,\
    \ armed with magnetic ray guns. The wind howled and the sun bashed the earth with\
    \ brilliance as Captainette Cleothgard and the team commandeered a fantastically\
    \ fast sports car and sped across the plains towards the scene of criminality.\
    \ Not even the cataclysms of earthquake, monsoon, and the coming to pass of ancient\
    \ Biblical prophecy could stop them. Swatting aside the locust swarms, the pointyhead\
    \ detectives descended upon Poisonwell and nabbed the perp just as he tried to\
    \ escape in his rocket ship.\n\u201CYou're nicked!\u201D cried Lieutenantette\
    \ Spivack, eschewing the bureaucratically-approved verbal rigmarole of less venturesome\
    \ detectives.\n\u201CFoof-la!\u201D exclaimed the Poisonwell Well-Poisoner, caught\
    \ red-handed, \u201CIt's a fair cop, and no mistake.\u201D\nThere was much more\
    \ in this vein, and the editor of Let's Outwit Brainy Criminals! was delighted.\
    \ Sales of the magazine soared, and in both fashionable salons and sordid middens,\
    \ all anybody could talk about was the brave, charismatic pointyhead detectives.\
    \ There was gossip about a feature film and a television series. The cub scribbler\
    \ was commissioned to write further adventures, and he did not disappoint. Week\
    \ after week, he recounted entirely fictional thrills \u2018n\u2019 spills about\
    \ the fivesome, careful to slip in just enough real-world facts to give his yarns\
    \ an air of verisimilitude. The fervour reached such a pitch that it eventually\
    \ came to the attention of the notoriously dim Chief of Police. This bemedalled\
    \ fellow, built like a walrus with a moustache to match, decided to pay a visit\
    \ to his crack crime-fighting team in their ill-appointed room off a remote corridor\
    \ on an otherwise deserted storey of the police headquarters annexe on the far\
    \ side of town.\nHe was astonished, on that rain-lashed Thursday afternoon, to\
    \ find the supposedly heroic pointyhead detectives reclining on divans, cogitating.\n\
    \u201CWhere is the doughtiness? Where the derring-do?\u201D he wailed.\n\u201C\
    Sssh!\u201D hissed Captainette Cleothgard, \u201CWe are in the middle of solving\
    \ the despicable slaughter of the innocents down by Sawdust Bridge.\u201D\nThe\
    \ Chief of Police flailed his arms to disperse the fug of pipe-smoke and shouted\
    \ his head off.\n\u201CYou ought to be down at Sawdust Bridge then, armed to the\
    \ teeth, sniffing out clues, and ready to snap the cuffs on the perp after a spot\
    \ of sickening violence, preferably at the very same time as a sea-monster emerges\
    \ dripping from the river and wreaks havoc in the vicinity, as would happen in\
    \ those popular magazine reports!\u201D he cried.\nSo cerebral were the pointyhead\
    \ detectives, so removed from the petty concerns of the workaday world, that they\
    \ remained quite ignorant of their new-found fame. They had no idea what their\
    \ Chief was talking about. Furrowing their brows even deeper, they sank further\
    \ into the plush upholstery of the divans and cogitated more furiously.\nNow the\
    \ Chief of Police, like many a dim walrus-moustached official in fact and fiction,\
    \ was not given to considered reflection. He made snap decisions, and blundered\
    \ on regardless. So it was that he set a klaxon roaring, hustled the pointyhead\
    \ detectives out into the rain, set fire to the divans, and had the deduction\
    \ chamber locked and bolted, placing scary Hazchem signage outside it for good\
    \ measure.\n\u201CGet thee hence to Sawdust Bridge!\u201D he screamed, \u201C\
    And solve the crime in an exciting and blood-curdling manner! Or I'll have your\
    \ guts for garters!\u201D\nPerplexed and befuddled, the fivesome trudged away.\
    \ As soon as they were out of sight of the Chief, they lay down on a sopping wet\
    \ lawn, reignited their pipes, and resumed their cogitations. They were still\
    \ cogitating, a few hours later, when the rain ceased and a shaft of brilliant\
    \ sunlight broke through the clouds, illuminating, just behind them, a terrible\
    \ scene. The cub scribbler, now grown rich and preening by dint of his success,\
    \ was strolling across the lawn dressed to the nines in a top hat and a brand\
    \ new silken Boffo Splendido Italianate suit, when he was set upon by a whirling\
    \ tangle of ruffians, who beat him senseless with bludgeons and robbed him and\
    \ stripped him of clothes and cash and chucked him into the swollen roaring river\
    \ and cackled evil cackles as they did so and then went further marauding, attacking\
    \ nearby orphans and puppies and glorying in their criminality.\nCogitating upon\
    \ the wet lawn, the pointyhead detectives remained utterly oblivious to the enormities\
    \ taking place just yards away. The clouds dispersed, and Thursday afternoon was\
    \ sunny, with a light breeze."
