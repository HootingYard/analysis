  text: 'The pointyhead detectives had very few adventures. Much of their time was
    spent reclining upon divans, cogitating, an activity not conducive to venturesome
    antics. And when not cogitating, they directed most of their energies towards
    the precise disposition of the divans within their so-called deduction chamber,
    an ill-appointed room off a remote corridor on an otherwise deserted storey of
    the police headquarters annexe on the far side of town. Sometimes they determined
    that the divans were best placed in regular geometric formation, at other times
    that they were best scattered higgledy piggledy in the available space. On Easter
    Sundays and other Christian festivals the pointyhead detectives experimented with
    divan-arrangements somewhere between orderly and chaotic. They had never been
    able to settle upon an optimum disposition, for they were only too aware that
    some crimes were best solved with the divans lined up in a row, or in a stellar
    pattern, while other crimes were cracked when the divans were arranged haphazardly.
    The one thing they all agreed upon was the effectiveness of their cerebral approach,
    as pointyhead detectives, reclining upon divans, smoking their pipes, looking
    to the untrained eye as if they were half-asleep and lost in lassitude.

    So when a cub scribbler from Let''s Outwit Brainy Criminals! magazine was dispatched
    to police headquarters to interview the pointyhead detectives and to write up
    their adventures for a feature article, he was rapidly plunged into despair. There
    were only so many ways of describing a pointyhead detective reclining upon a divan,
    cogitating, before repeating oneself. Even discussions about the disposition of
    the divans were carried out quietly and thoughtfully and without rancour or fist-fights.
    The scribbler slumped in a corner of the deduction chamber and wept salt tears.
    He went unnoticed by the pointyhead detectives, who were sprawled on their divans
    cogitating about the latest enormity they were set to solve, the case of the poisoned
    well at Poisonwell.

    The poor weeping scribbler was terrified that, unable to craft an exciting piece
    of prose from such unexciting material, he would be dismissed from his position.
    In those parts, at that time, it was the lot of dismissed scribblers to be sent
    to the frontier to dig drainage ditches. What could save him from such a fate?
    He had but one recourse, and that was to rely on the power of his imagination.
    The scribbler hurried back to his cubby and wrote a wholly fictional account of
    the pointyhead detectives.

    Fighter jets screamed across the sky as the pointyhead detectives teetered on
    the edge of the erupting volcano, he scribbled. Boiling hot lava lapping at their
    stylish winklepickers, the doughty threesome foursome fivesome did doughty derring
    doings, with much shouting and screaming and ululating, but always with a purpose.
    Evil wrongdoers trembled in their hideaways as the pointyhead detectives came
    crashing down from the volcano at inhuman speed, armed with magnetic ray guns.
    The wind howled and the sun bashed the earth with brilliance as Captainette Cleothgard
    and the team commandeered a fantastically fast sports car and sped across the
    plains towards the scene of criminality. Not even the cataclysms of earthquake,
    monsoon, and the coming to pass of ancient Biblical prophecy could stop them.
    Swatting aside the locust swarms, the pointyhead detectives descended upon Poisonwell
    and nabbed the perp just as he tried to escape in his rocket ship.

    "You''re nicked!" cried Lieutenantette Spivack, eschewing the bureaucratically-approved
    verbal rigmarole of less venturesome detectives.

    "Foof-la!" exclaimed the Poisonwell Well-Poisoner, caught red-handed, "It''s a
    fair cop, and no mistake."

    There was much more in this vein, and the editor of Let''s Outwit Brainy Criminals!
    was delighted. Sales of the magazine soared, and in both fashionable salons and
    sordid middens, all anybody could talk about was the brave, charismatic pointyhead
    detectives. There was gossip about a feature film and a television series. The
    cub scribbler was commissioned to write further adventures, and he did not disappoint.
    Week after week, he recounted entirely fictional thrills ''n'' spills about the
    fivesome, careful to slip in just enough real-world facts to give his yarns an
    air of verisimilitude. The fervour reached such a pitch that it eventually came
    to the attention of the notoriously dim Chief of Police. This bemedalled fellow,
    built like a walrus with a moustache to match, decided to pay a visit to his crack
    crime-fighting team in their ill-appointed room off a remote corridor on an otherwise
    deserted storey of the police headquarters annexe on the far side of town.

    He was astonished, on that rain-lashed Thursday afternoon, to find the supposedly
    heroic pointyhead detectives reclining on divans, cogitating.

    "Where is the doughtiness? Where the derring-do?" he wailed.

    "Sssh!" hissed Captainette Cleothgard, "We are in the middle of solving the despicable
    slaughter of the innocents down by Sawdust Bridge."

    The Chief of Police flailed his arms to disperse the fug of pipe-smoke and shouted
    his head off.

    "You ought to be down at Sawdust Bridge then, armed to the teeth, sniffing out
    clues, and ready to snap the cuffs on the perp after a spot of sickening violence,
    preferably at the very same time as a sea-monster emerges dripping from the river
    and wreaks havoc in the vicinity, as would happen in those popular magazine reports!"
    he cried.

    So cerebral were the pointyhead detectives, so removed from the petty concerns
    of the workaday world, that they remained quite ignorant of their new-found fame.
    They had no idea what their Chief was talking about. Furrowing their brows even
    deeper, they sank further into the plush upholstery of the divans and cogitated
    more furiously.

    Now the Chief of Police, like many a dim walrus-moustached official in fact and
    fiction, was not given to considered reflection. He made snap decisions, and blundered
    on regardless. So it was that he set a klaxon roaring, hustled the pointyhead
    detectives out into the rain, set fire to the divans, and had the deduction chamber
    locked and bolted, placing scary Hazchem signage outside it for good measure.

    "Get thee hence to Sawdust Bridge!" he screamed, "And solve the crime in an exciting
    and blood-curdling manner! Or I''ll have your guts for garters!"

    Perplexed and befuddled, the fivesome trudged away. As soon as they were out of
    sight of the Chief, they lay down on a sopping wet lawn, reignited their pipes,
    and resumed their cogitations. They were still cogitating, a few hours later,
    when the rain ceased and a shaft of brilliant sunlight broke through the clouds,
    illuminating, just behind them, a terrible scene. The cub scribbler, now grown
    rich and preening by dint of his success, was strolling across the lawn dressed
    to the nines in a top hat and a brand new silken Boffo Splendido Italianate suit,
    when he was set upon by a whirling tangle of ruffians, who beat him senseless
    with bludgeons and robbed him and stripped him of clothes and cash and chucked
    him into the swollen roaring river and cackled evil cackles as they did so and
    then went further marauding, attacking nearby orphans and puppies and glorying
    in their criminality.

    Cogitating upon the wet lawn, the pointyhead detectives remained utterly oblivious
    to the enormities taking place just yards away. The clouds dispersed, and Thursday
    afternoon was sunny, with a light breeze.'
