  text: "A Brechtian sea-shanty, once sung in music halls:\nThere's a blighter eating\
    \ bloaters. He won't have no mayonnaise. He hates Continental sauces and Continental\
    \ ways. He never wears a beret, nor strings onions round his neck. He's a bloater-eating\
    \ blighter dancing a hornpipe on the deck. For he's a sailing blighter on the\
    \ good ship Marmaduke. He eats so many bloaters that soon he starts to puke. He\
    \ vomits on the orlop deck and again upon the poop. The other sailors pick him\
    \ up and chuck him in the soup. By soup of course I mean the sea, the churning\
    \ broiling sea. And the blighter eating bloaters, well in truth that man was me.\
    \ I puked some more and then I swam until I reached the shore. It was a Continental\
    \ shore o lumme guv, o lor\u2019. Now I must eat mayonnaise and Continental sauces.\
    \ But now at last I'm mindful of globalising forces. So give me sauce and condiments\
    \ to accompany my bloaters, and I will explain all about socioeconomic motors,\
    \ the engines of commerce and exchange and of all sorts of trades. Give me my\
    \ breakfast bloaters and don't stint on mayonnaise!"
