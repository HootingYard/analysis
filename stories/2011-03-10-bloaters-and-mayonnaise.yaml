  text: 'A Brechtian sea-shanty, once sung in music halls:

    There''s a blighter eating bloaters. He won''t have no mayonnaise. He hates Continental
    sauces and Continental ways. He never wears a beret, nor strings onions round
    his neck. He''s a bloater-eating blighter dancing a hornpipe on the deck. For
    he''s a sailing blighter on the good ship Marmaduke. He eats so many bloaters
    that soon he starts to puke. He vomits on the orlop deck and again upon the poop.
    The other sailors pick him up and chuck him in the soup. By soup of course I mean
    the sea, the churning broiling sea. And the blighter eating bloaters, well in
    truth that man was me. I puked some more and then I swam until I reached the shore.
    It was a Continental shore o lumme guv, o lor''. Now I must eat mayonnaise and
    Continental sauces. But now at last I''m mindful of globalising forces. So give
    me sauce and condiments to accompany my bloaters, and I will explain all about
    socioeconomic motors, the engines of commerce and exchange and of all sorts of
    trades. Give me my breakfast bloaters and don''t stint on mayonnaise!'
