  text: 'On Thursday last, while trotting through the park, the parson was unhorsed,
    and fell into a ha-ha. Torrential rainfall during the previous week had filled
    the ditch with puddles, and when he clambered out, the parson was sopping wet.
    His horse had galloped away, and was nowhere to be seen, so the parson faced the
    prospect of having to walk the many miles back to his parsonage. The weather remained
    inclement, although it was no longer raining.

    At this juncture, the parson felt the presence of the uncanny, just behind him.
    He span around, and saw an angel. Its wings were furled, its locks were golden.
    In one hand, it held a jar of mayonnaise, in the other a bottle of bleach. The
    parson was surprised to note that it wore black leather gloves.

    "Take this jar and take this bottle," said the angel. So mellifluous was its voice
    that the parson near swooned. He reached out, and took the mayonnaise and the
    bleach, and as soon as he did so, the angel vanished. Where it had stood there
    was a haze of gaseous mist. The parson was sore perplexed.

    Just then, as astronomers had foretold, there was a partial eclipse of the sun
    and, as seismologists had foretold, a minor earthquake shook the ground on which
    the parson stood. He nearly toppled over, and would have fallen back into the
    ha-ha, and possibly smashed the jar and the bottle, both of which were glass,
    but he was a parson  of stupendous balance. All the more surprising that he had
    been unhorsed.

    The partial eclipse made the park dark. But in its jar, the mayonnaise had a creamy
    glow. The parson held it aloft, and it lit him on his way as he began his long
    journey home.


    Having read the piece aloud to your class, posit the following questions. Allow
    the time indicated in each case for the tinies to scratch the answers upon their
    slates.

    Why do you think the parson was unhorsed? (30 seconds)

    What kind of angel would wear gloves? (30 seconds)

    How likely is it that an eclipse and an earthquake would happen at the same time?
    (15 seconds)

    Why did the angel present the parson with a bottle of bleach? (90 seconds)

    Do you think the horse found its own way back to the parsonage? (30 seconds)

    Of which noble gases would the haze of mist be composed? (120 seconds)

    Now get the class to retell the story in such a way that the parson and the angel
    and the horse all swap roles. (6 hours)'
