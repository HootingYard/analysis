  text: 'Astonishingly, today is the fifth anniversary of the publication of Blotzmann''s
    historic bird psychology diagram. Ornithologists throughout the world will be
    celebrating this landmark in a manner only ornithologists can, that is, by gathering
    upon promontories peering at the sky while munching filberts.

    It is hard to put into words the earth-shuddering ramifications occasioned by
    Blotzmann''s diagram. Certainly it has had immeasurable effects upon the way we
    puny humans apprehend our beaked, winged, airborne pals. I for one am reduced
    to dribbling with joy that I no longer languish in bird-ignorance, as I sadly
    did until this day five long years ago.

    UPDATE : Inexplicably, several errors crept into the reproduction of Blotzmann''s
    diagram. The corrected version appears below, and will, again, loom larger should
    you click upon it.
