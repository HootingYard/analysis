  text: "Astonishingly, today is the fifth anniversary of the publication of Bl\xF6\
    tzmann's historic bird psychology diagram. Ornithologists throughout the world\
    \ will be celebrating this landmark in a manner only ornithologists can, that\
    \ is, by gathering upon promontories peering at the sky while munching filberts.\n\
    \n(Click on the diagram for a larger image,)\nIt is hard to put into words the\
    \ earth-shuddering ramifications occasioned by Bl\xF6tzmann's diagram. Certainly\
    \ it has had immeasurable effects upon the way we puny humans apprehend our beak\xE9\
    d, wing\xE9d, airborne pals. I for one am reduced to dribbling with joy that I\
    \ no longer languish in bird-ignorance, as I sadly did until this day five long\
    \ years ago.\nUPDATE\_: Inexplicably, several errors crept into the reproduction\
    \ of Bl\xF6tzmann's diagram. The corrected version appears below, and will, again,\
    \ loom larger should you click upon it.\n"
