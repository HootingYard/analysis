  text: 'A letter to John Waddington Ltd...

    I understand your firm is the leading manufacturer of playing cards and games
    and that you are always on the look-out for novelties in this field.

    Enclosed herewith please find reproductions of two pages from an ancient Aztec
    codex; kindly take a look at them.

    I am a philosopher-psychologist, former lecturer at the University of Budapest.
    For the past few years I have been engaged in some rather abstruse socio-anthropological
    research. In the course of this work, as a sort of ''spin-off'', I happen to have
    cracked the code of the Aztec-Maya-Omec Tonalpouhalli (''ritual year''). This,
    even if I say so myself, is quite an important academic achievement and will undoubtedly
    create quite a stir in the appropriate circles when I publish my findings.

    For your information--in case your acquaintance with the extinct Meso-American
    cultures is no longer up to specialist standard--the Tonalpouhalli was a ''year''
    consisting of 13 20-day ''months''... The Nahuatl word ''Tonalpouhalli'' translates
    as something like ''the arithmetic of destiny'' and it forms the foundation of
    the Tonalamatl (''The Book of Fate'') which consists of pictures only...

    The reason I am telling you this is that, with the riddle solved, the Tonalamatl
    lends itself eminently well to a transformation into a game akin to the phenomenally
    successful Monopoly, as well as to an ordinary card game, as well as to a divinatory
    system similar to the Tarot cards... I feel that this holds considerable commercial
    possibilities.

    A letter from Dr Charlotte Bach to John Waddington Ltd, quoted in Who Was Dr Charlotte
    Bach? by Francis Wheen (2002). Wheen notes "Messrs Waddington felt otherwise".'
