  text: "A letter to John Waddington Ltd\u2026\nI understand your firm is the leading\
    \ manufacturer of playing cards and games and that you are always on the look-out\
    \ for novelties in this field.\nEnclosed herewith please find reproductions of\
    \ two pages from an ancient Aztec codex; kindly take a look at them.\nI am a philosopher-psychologist,\
    \ former lecturer at the University of Budapest. For the past few years I have\
    \ been engaged in some rather abstruse socio-anthropological research. In the\
    \ course of this work, as a sort of \u2018spin-off\u2019, I happen to have cracked\
    \ the code of the Aztec-Maya-Omec Tonalpouhalli (\u2018ritual year\u2019). This,\
    \ even if I say so myself, is quite an important academic achievement and will\
    \ undoubtedly create quite a stir in the appropriate circles when I publish my\
    \ findings.\nFor your information\u2014in case your acquaintance with the extinct\
    \ Meso-American cultures is no longer up to specialist standard\u2014the Tonalpouhalli\
    \ was a \u2018year\u2019 consisting of 13 20-day \u2018months\u2019\u2026 The\
    \ Nahuatl word \u2018Tonalpouhalli\u2019 translates as something like \u2018the\
    \ arithmetic of destiny\u2019 and it forms the foundation of the Tonalamatl (\u2018\
    The Book of Fate\u2019) which consists of pictures only\u2026\nThe reason I am\
    \ telling you this is that, with the riddle solved, the Tonalamatl lends itself\
    \ eminently well to a transformation into a game akin to the phenomenally successful\
    \ Monopoly, as well as to an ordinary card game, as well as to a divinatory system\
    \ similar to the Tarot cards\u2026 I feel that this holds considerable commercial\
    \ possibilities.\nA letter from Dr Charlotte Bach to John Waddington Ltd, quoted\
    \ in Who Was Dr Charlotte Bach? by Francis Wheen (2002). Wheen notes \u201CMessrs\
    \ Waddington felt otherwise\u201D."
