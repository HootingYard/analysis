  text: Mention of Dr Charlotte Bach's tragically unrealised Aztec board game summoned
    to memory a family favourite from my childhood. Overseas Jesuit was a board game
    in which one rolled the dice and moved one's counter across various dark and benighted
    continents, converting the heathen hordes by fire and sword. So simple were the
    rules that the game was suitable for even the tiniest young Catholic.
