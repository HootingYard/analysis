    This is the set of six exceedingly rare out of print pamphlets available to the
    highest bidder in this weekend''s fundraiser auction on ResonanceFM. There are
    many more splendid items for which you can empty your pockets, so go here for
    further details.

    The Ugo books contain heart-wrenching tales of Ugo and his blind Ma and his pal
    Ulf, set in the old town of Plovdiv. They are fully illustrated with black and
    white reproductions of details from some of the masterpieces of Western art. Each
    book, originally published in an edition of, I think, just twelve copies in 2004,
    is signed by the author and a dedication to the successful bidder will be added
    before they''re popped in the post.'
