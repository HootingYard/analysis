  text: 'My sister, a librarian, on old new technology:

    "But papyrus scrolls feel so much better!"

    Such were the cries of lamentation heard across the ancient world as papyrus scrolls
    were replaced by that new-fangled Roman invention the codex, or book.

    "Why do I have to flip these--what are they called? pages? The scrolls ran so
    smoothly under my hand, they signified a seamless flow of knowledge, a noble tradition,
    now it''s all chopped up into scraps signifying nothing ..."

    The Luddites'' fretful complaints drone on down the centuries, ever eloquent in
    bemoaning the end of civilization as we know it, while civilization as we aren''t
    quite used to it yet is busy being born. The invention of the printing press was
    the work of the devil according to these doomsayers, and maybe they were right
    because it did spread those dangerous things called ideas to the previously unlettered
    masses. They began thinking for themselves, founding new churches, having revolutions,
    writing novels that sent Victorian ladies into a swoon, and reading everything
    from the Bible and Shakespeare to tabloid gossip and vampire boyfriend sagas.
    Where will it all end? Not with a bang or a whimper apparently, but with a tweet.'
