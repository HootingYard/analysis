  text: "I have learned to be very picky when it comes to choosing my hiking companions.\
    \ Once, I tramped the moors with a skittish widow-woman. Another time, I tramped\
    \ other moors in the company of a pig-ignorant popinjay. These hikes taught me\
    \ much, and they were hard lessons, from which my immortal soul took weeks to\
    \ recover. Sprawled on a pallet in a post-hiking clinic, I had time to review\
    \ my entire approach to hikes. One thing that became absolutely clear to me is\
    \ that I needs must have a companion of some kind, for I am temperamentally unsuited\
    \ to solo hiking due to the particular admixture of blood, black bile, yellow\
    \ bile and phlegm which makes me what I am.\nI did, once, go on a hike all by\
    \ myself, and it was a disaster. I got hopelessly lost, entangled in a clump of\
    \ bracken, dive-bombed by a flock of angry guillemots, drenched by rain and stung\
    \ by hailstones, apprehended by surly border guards and subjected to interrogation\
    \ in a subterranean interrogation chamber the cold stone walls of which were stained\
    \ with the blood of peasants, entangled in a clump of gorse, waylaid by banditti,\
    \ buffeted by gales, accused of trespass in a top secret military installation,\
    \ deafened by the relentless pounding of voodoo drums, entangled in a clump of\
    \ nettles, haunted by hallucinatory visions of the skittish widow-woman and the\
    \ pig-ignorant popinjay, poisoned by befouled water from a deceptively idyllic\
    \ rill, attacked by tiny flying biting things, strafed by fighter jets, entangled\
    \ in a clump of hawthorn, besmirched by the excreta of starlings, savaged by weasels,\
    \ battered and bruised after toppling into a ha-ha, almost suffocated in a slaapsok\
    \ accident, lacerated by barbed wire, discombobulated by the jumbling of my blood\
    \ and black bile and yellow bile and phlegm, ridiculed by wayfaring minstrels,\
    \ burned by the sun, stung by bees, entangled in a clump of thistles, threatened\
    \ by bellowing cows, and lost, lost, hopelessly lost.\n\u201CNever again must\
    \ you go hiking alone!\u201D shouted Dr Heinrich Weems, my post-hike traumatic\
    \ neurasthenia syndrome counsellor.\nAt my first consultation, he had actually\
    \ forbidden me ever to hike again full stop, but I protested that I would die\
    \ if I did not hike. This was utter twaddle, of course, but I deployed the full\
    \ gamut of my thespian skills, learned at the feet of Sir Donald Sinden and Bruce\
    \ Willis, and Dr Weems was convinced I spoke the truth.\n\u201CAch! You poor fellow!\u201D\
    \ he shouted, \u201CSo if I understand you correctly, you will keel over and die\
    \ in agony unless you regularly embark upon jaunty hiking expeditions, across\
    \ moors and heaths, through woods and forests, up hills and mountains, and down\
    \ vales and dells?\u201D\nTo which flagrant poppycock I responded with a nod,\
    \ adding \u201CYippee-ky-ay, motherfucker\u201D, a Willisism which never fails\
    \ to do the trick.\nIn subsequent meetings with Dr Weems, we moved from his consulting\
    \ room in an agreeable Swiss chalet to his secret underground laboratory. Here,\
    \ in tenebrous gloom, he induced a catatonic trance by babbling Blavatskyan gibberish\
    \ into my ears, and then proceeded, with pincers and slicers and a suction tube\
    \ and a funnel and a Petri dish, to extract samples of my blood and my black bile\
    \ and my yellow bile and my phlegm. When I regained consciousness, he showed me\
    \ the jar in which he had mixed my four humours together.\n\u201CBy means of a\
    \ pipette,\u201D he shouted, \u201CI am going to feed this goo, diluted with duckpond\
    \ water, to my experimental squirrels. Then we shall see what we shall see.\u201D\
    \nI cancelled my next appointment with Dr Weems. I had no doubt he was a very\
    \ sensible therapist, but the lure of the hike grew too strong to resist. Each\
    \ morning I would wake to find that, during the night, I had kitted myself out\
    \ in full hiking gear, the boots, the socks, the etceteras, and I was even clutching\
    \ a sturdy stick in my behikinggloved hand. Clearly my unconscious mind was desperate\
    \ to go a-roaming \u2018cross moors and heaths and through woods and forests and\
    \ up hills and mountains and down vales and dells. Once or twice I was reckless\
    \ enough to start out alone, but I never got further than my garden gate. Somehow\
    \ I heard the guttural shouting of Dr Weems inside my brain, and I knew he was\
    \ right.\nThus did I begin my search for a new hiking companion. I loitered down\
    \ by the docks, and in penny arcades, and on traffic islands, in post offices\
    \ and department stores, near electricity pylons, at fashion shoots, under awnings,\
    \ in railway station canteens and airport chaplaincies, on quaysides and in souks.\
    \ Wherever I loitered, the skittish widow-woman and the pig-ignorant popinjay\
    \ descended upon me, imploring me to take them hiking, but I rebuffed them with\
    \ Sindenisms and Willisisms, or, in extremis, bashed them with a shovel.\nIt was\
    \ around this time, stormy March, that I began to wonder if perhaps Dr Heinrich\
    \ Weems might be the ideal person to accompany me on a hike. It was true that\
    \ he was shouty and guttural, that we had a professional doctor-patient relationship,\
    \ that he lumbered about on crutches, that his table manners were as disgusting\
    \ as Franz Kafka's, that his bouffant was riddled with beetles and other creepy-crawlies,\
    \ and that he had never shown the slightest interest in the great outdoors, indeed\
    \ that his sickly pallor and near-blindness suggested he never ventured outdoors\
    \ at all. Yet weighed against this were many points in his favour. Well, not many,\
    \ but some. Perhaps not some, just one. And if not even one, if in fact he might\
    \ prove to be the most odious companion a hiker could ever hike with, still, I\
    \ was desperate, and surely not even Dr Weems could be as vile a fellow hiker\
    \ as the skittish widow-woman or the pig-ignorant popinjay? When stormy March\
    \ turned to stormy April, I cast aside all doubts and caught a bus to the slope\
    \ on which his agreeable chalet teetered.\nI rapped upon his door with my sturdy\
    \ stick, but answer came there none. Then I noticed that the door was ajar. I\
    \ pushed it open, gingerly, for I find that gingeriness is invariably the best\
    \ approach when pushing open the ajar doors of chalets, no matter how agreeable\
    \ they are. Equally gingerly, I entered the chalet lobby. There was no sign of\
    \ life, unless you count the sudden darting, across the floor, from wainscot to\
    \ wainscot, of one of the doctor's experimental squirrels. The sight of it made\
    \ me shudder, and I was about to turn on my heel and wait at the bus stop for\
    \ the next bus back to town when I spotted something resting on the chalet lobby\
    \ telephone table. It was not a telephone. It was a voodoo ouanga bag, and it\
    \ had been torn open, bitten open, savagely, with dripping fangs, and its contents\
    \ were strewn on the tabletop, luck stones, snake bones, lizard jaws, squirrel\
    \ teeth, bat bones, frog bones, black hen feathers and bones, black lamb wool,\
    \ dove hearts, mole skins, images of wax and clay, candy made of brown sugar mixed\
    \ with liver, mud, sulphur, salt, and alum, and vegetable poisons. I shuddered\
    \ again, and while I was in mid-shudder the trapdoor leading down to the underground\
    \ laboratory creaked open, and from the fumous black depths emerged Dr Heinrich\
    \ Weems.\nIt was he, yet it was not he. For as I discovered, by poking him with\
    \ my stick, he had been transformed into a zombie. But what a zombie! A brainless\
    \ being, bereft of life, the walking dead he might be\u2014but one with a rucksack\
    \ and a woolly sweater and a lanyard around his neck from which dangled a transparent\
    \ plastic pocket crammed with maps. A zombie with stout boots and thick socks\
    \ and a sturdy stick. He was a zombie ready for a long and arduous hike.\nAs we\
    \ strode together out of the chalet into the great outdoors, clouds scudded and\
    \ the sun shone. We set off for the moors and the heaths, for the woods and the\
    \ forests, for the hills and the mountains, for the vales and the dells. Within\
    \ me stirred my blood and black bile and yellow bile and phlegm, in perfect harmony.\
    \ Within my hiking companion, the zombie that once had been Dr Weems, nothing\
    \ stirred, nothing at all, save for a magnificent implacable brainless devotion\
    \ to the hike."
