    Over at The Dabbler this week I recall my favourite pedagogue, a chap with a jarring
    speech impediment. A slightly different version of the piece appeared here some
    years ago. One detail that I certainly had no intention of changing, for obvious
    reasons, was the pedagogue''s use, for pedagogic purposes, of tonybuzanities.
    These awe-inspiring pedagogic aids are named after Tony Buzan, he of the sepulchral
    voice and the flowing black cape--truly a boulevard magnifico, if ever there was
    one, and a magnifico whose brain pulsates at a rate lesser mortals can only dream
    about, while dribbling and grovelling at his feet.
