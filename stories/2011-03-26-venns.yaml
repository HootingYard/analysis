  text: 'I have been thinking of drawing a Venn diagram showing all possible Venns.
    There is John Venn himself, the invenntor of the diagram, also notable for having
    built an automatic cricket-ball-bowling machine which was used to great effect
    in Cambridge in 1909 against a visiting Australian XI. There is red ochre-stained
    Diggory Venn, the reddleman from Hardy''s The Return Of The Native (1878). And
    there is a hamlet in Saskatchewan called Venn which, in its glory days, had a
    wood crib grain elevator.

    There, that is three Venns to be going on with, sufficient for a diagram. Time
    to get the coloured pencils and paper!
