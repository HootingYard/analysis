  text: 'I should perhaps give some explanation of the postages headed The Funnel,
    Volumes One and Two. They comprise the lists of contents of the only two editions
    of a decisively obscure magazine entitled The Funnel, conceived and written by
    Dobson and edited and published by Marigold Chew.

    Dobson was insanely jealous of the success of the Reader''s Digest, every single
    issue of which sold more copies than even his most popular pamphlets. Trudging
    along one morning past the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level
    crossing, it occurred to him that whereas his pamphlets tended, in the main, to
    address one subject at a time, the great attraction of the Reader''s Digest was
    its variety. Each copy came packed with diverting disquisitions on topics as various
    as John''s kidney, escapes from imperilment, Jane''s liver, Aztec antiquities,
    anticommunist hysteria, and astrological flummery.

    "To hell with pamphlets!" shouted the pamphleteer, at a siskin perched upon a
    bough. The siskin is, in the words of one ornithologist, an attractive little
    finch, but it has no understanding of human speech, so Dobson''s words were wasted.
    But when he arrived home, having plodded around the edge of the eerie marsh, he
    repeated his imprecation to Marigold Chew.

    "Gosh," she said, adding "You could just staple four or five pamphlets together,
    and that would provide the variety you seek, Dobson."

    "Have you actually seen the Reader''s Digest?" shouted Dobson, "It covers far
    more than four or five topics. It is so packed with prose that its binding needs
    a spine, unlike virtually ever other magazine available at this point in the twentieth
    century!"

    "So staple ten or a dozen pamphlets together, Dobson," said Marigold Chew.

    "No staple is big or sturdy enough for the popular magazine I envisage!" shouted
    Dobson, and he began pouring milk into a bowl.

    Over the following weeks and months, the pamphleteer and his inamorata thrashed
    out the details of a publication Dobson was convinced would have the editor of
    the Reader''s Digest either grovelling piteously at his feet or banging his head
    repeatedly against the damp stone walls of an oubliette in a secure facility for
    lunatics. Each issue of the as yet untitled magazine would contain not ten, not
    a dozen, but thirteen articles, penned by Dobson but with titles provided by Marigold
    Chew. She would enter into a shamanistic trance-frenzy, cavorting dizzily around
    a bonfire in the back garden, twigs and bones and feathers entwined in her hair,
    and summon from eldritch tonybuzanities a set of two-word titles based on the
    alphabet (issue one) or the qwerty keyboard layout (issue two). Fuelled by plentiful
    tumblers of aerated radishwater, Dobson would write all the articles in one marathon
    scribbleathon, the reams and reams of dazzling prose typeset and Gestetnered by
    Marigold Chew, and untold millions of copies piled high in a convoy of container
    lorries revving their diesel motors outside the house, ready to fan out across
    the land to doctors'' and dentists'' waiting rooms and other carefully selected
    distribution points.

    On a Thursday night in November, Marigold Chew induced a shamanistic trance-frenzy
    and delivered forth twenty-six titles for Dobson to crack on with. At dawn, brandishing
    the flayed skin of a wolf on which the titles were daubed in her own blood, she
    went looking for the pamphleteer, who was nowhere to be found in the house. She
    found him beyond the pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing,
    slumped in the muck, weeping.

    "Here, Dobson," she cried, still in a partial frenzy, "The contents of issues
    one and two of The Funnel are ready for you, wrenched from realms beyond sense!"

    But Dobson continued to weep, clawing at the mud.

    "All is hopeless, hopeless," he whimpered, "I have just been apprised, by Sputnik
    or some such space age contraption, of the latest Reader''s Digest circulation
    figures. I must be mad to think I could ever match them. No, Marigold, I am afraid
    it is back to the drudgery of pamphleteering for me. Tell the convoy of container
    lorries to drive away. I shall weep and claw some more and then I shall come home
    and pour milk into a bowl."

    "Right-o, Dobson," said Marigold Chew, brightly, "And I shall put the kettle on
    and pop the smokers'' poptarts into the toaster."

    And thus dawned a Friday morning in November. Far far away, in Texas, Lee Harvey
    Oswald woke from an uneasy sleep, got ready for work, and before leaving the house,
    plopped his wedding ring into a pale, translucent, blue-green china teacup with
    violets and a golden rim that once belonged to his wife''s grandmother.'
