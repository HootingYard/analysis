  text: "My ascent into heaven was, I am sorry to say, something of a disappointment.\
    \ To begin with, the angels who bore me aloft, away from mortal clay, were a shabby\
    \ bunch. Their wings were threadbare and caked in dust, their golden locks were\
    \ greasy and unwashed, and as for their faces! As pockmarked as Stalin's, and\
    \ as charmless!\nThings got no better when, after much puff, we eventually fetched\
    \ up at the pearly gates. The pearls themselves were tarnished, and I suspected\
    \ they had been eked from infected oysters, ones with the bivalve mollusc equivalent\
    \ of human scrofula. They were stuck to the gates with some kind of heavenly gum\
    \ or paste which had an unbearable stink and further discoloured the pearls. Whatever\
    \ this stuff was\u2014a sort of sticky ectoplasm?\u2014it lacked adhesive heft,\
    \ for quite a few pearls were either loose or had fallen from the gates and were\
    \ scattered in the gutter. I had not expected gutters in heaven, nor drains, nor\
    \ sewers, which is I suppose a mark of my naivet\xE9.\nI cannot bring myself to\
    \ go into detail about St Peter. Suffice to say that his resemblance to Stalin\
    \ was starker than that of the angels. The appraisal interview in which my time\
    \ on earth was picked over in forensic detail was a sore trial unto me, not because\
    \ I had wallowed in moral squalor, but rather because it acted as a reminder of\
    \ the tedium and waste and sheer futility of my life. Also, I was kept standing\
    \ throughout, when all I wanted was to rest my weary bones\u2014my weary dead\
    \ bones, remember\u2014sprawled on a sofa or divan. And not only was I kept standing,\
    \ but kept standing in a puddle, because the nearest drain was blocked, clogged\
    \ up with heavenmuck.\nAt long last Stalin\u2014sorry, St Peter\u2014waved me\
    \ through the gates. I thought I would be escorted by the tatty angels, or at\
    \ least one of them, but they were sent back down to the terrestrial plane to\
    \ gather up another poor dead sod. So, all alone, I stumbled into the light. The\
    \ cloudy clumps beneath my feet were treacherous. It was like walking through\
    \ a marsh where all the water had turned to gas. Here and there I spotted harps,\
    \ abandoned, rust-covered and with broken strings. Clearly they had not been played\
    \ in living memory.\nBut I realised of course there could be no such thing as\
    \ living memory here in heaven, where we were all dead. At least, I was. I couldn't\
    \ see another soul in the entire expanse of misty light which stretched as far\
    \ as I could see. Hey-ho. I picked a cloudy clump at random and lay down upon\
    \ it, and I waited for trumpets and hosannahs. Then it started to rain.\nTwenty-five\
    \ billion years later, fully rested, I sat up and peered into the mist. The torrential\
    \ rain had slowed to a drizzle. Off in the distance, I saw a wall had been erected.\
    \ I heaved myself to my feet and squished through the milky clumps towards it.\
    \ As I approached, an angel of the Lord appeared, carrying a step-ladder and a\
    \ bucket of gum or paste and a brush and a large roll of paper. I watched the\
    \ angel erect the step ladder and clamber up it and spread paste upon the wall\
    \ and unroll the paper and stick it up and brush it smooth and descend the step\
    \ ladder and pick it up and carry it and the bucket and the brush away, vanishing\
    \ into the mist. When I got closer, I saw it was a gigantic poster of Stalin.\
    \ Not St Peter, but Stalin himself. Under his grim yet avuncular countenance,\
    \ there was a slogan. Unfortunately I cannot read Russian. I felt sure the words\
    \ were egging me on in the valiant struggle for a Utopian workers\u2019 future,\
    \ with tractors and electrification and rallies. I struck a determined pose, staring\
    \ forward, pointing at nothing. For there was nothing, just the poster on the\
    \ wall and the endless expanse of white misty milky light, in heaven."
