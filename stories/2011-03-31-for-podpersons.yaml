  text: "In a startling initiative, born of who knows what brain-faff, I have resolved\
    \ to post a direct link here each time a new Hooting Yard On The Air podcast is\
    \ made available by ResonanceFM's podcasting maestro. So here is the latest:\n\
    On Sawdust Bridge, Harangued Click, listen, and learn.\n\nIn a couple of weeks\u2019\
    \ time, the show will celebrate its seventh anniversary. It is a pity, I think,\
    \ that back in 2004 neither I nor anyone else thought to apply Bl\xF6tzmann numbers\
    \ to the episodes. Scholars, researchers, and fools would have a much easier time\
    \ of it if they were able to refer to \u201CEpisode 149\u201D, say, instead of\
    \ having to identify shows by the original broadcast date. Perhaps a sensible\
    \ person could devote a portion of their otherwise worthless life to the creation\
    \ of a numerical index?"
