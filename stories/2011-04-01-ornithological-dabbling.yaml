  text: '

    This week at The Dabbler I''ve devoted some words to the ever-intriguing subject
    of birds. Long-time readers will have read it before. I can always be relied on
    for avian lore. Some say I know not of what I speak, which is a monumental bit
    of cheek. Whether it''s a pratincole, a lark, or a linnet, I know all there is
    to know about birds, innit? Oh for the wings, for the wings of a dove! Or the
    wings of a nuthatch if push comes to shove. When push comes to shove I usually
    fall over. Unlike the corncrake, the wren, or the plover. They just fly away,
    on wings of song. I think that''s correct, but I may be wrong. There is so much
    to learn about birds of the air, more than my pea-sized brain can bear. But rather
    than stumbling through mental fog, I read words of wisdom in The Dabbler blog.'
