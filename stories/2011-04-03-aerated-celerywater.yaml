    Ludicrously obsessed as I am by the Kennedy assassination, my current reading
    is Vincent Bugliosi''s Four Days In November (2007), an extraordinarily detailed
    narrative of the events in Dallas forty-eight years ago. Bugliosi, famed as the
    prosecutor in the Manson murders, has won great respect for his "precise and definitive"
    account, "put[ting] all the pieces together", carefully documenting his tale with
    thousands of footnotes referring to primary sources.

    Yet here I am, on page 310, when we have arrived at 1.50 AM on Saturday 23 November,
    and I am ready to toss the book across the room in exasperation. Why?

    "Most of Dallas is asleep when Ruby finally enters the KLIF building after Russ
    Knight gets back from City Hall and opens the door. Several of the guys on duty
    are glad to see Jack''s big paper sack full of corned-beef sandwiches and soft
    drinks. "I figured you guys would be hungry," Jack tells them, "and I brought
    these up for you." Knight and DJ Danny McCurdy were intrigued by Doctor Black''s
    celery tonic in its peculiarly shaped bottle and expensive-looking gold foil,
    which neither of them had ever seen before. Whoever heard of a soft drink with
    celery in it? Jack explains that it''s something you normally get only in New
    York and is especially pleased when McCurdy thinks it''s the best soft drink he''s
    ever had."

    There is, of course, no such drink as "Doctor Black''s celery tonic". Bugliosi
    is confusing it with Doctor Brown''s celery tonic, also known as Cel-Ray. If he
    cannot get that right, if he muddles Black with Brown, how can we trust anything
    he says in this bulky doorstop of a book? Such inaccurate flimflam is enough to
    have me signing up to the absurd and paranoid Oliver Stone-Jim Garrison theories
    about the case.

    McCurdy may have asked "Whoever heard of a soft drink with celery in it?" but
    a more pertinent question is surely "Whoever would have thought that a soft drink
    with celery in it would prove so crucial a factor in the Kennedy assassination?"'
