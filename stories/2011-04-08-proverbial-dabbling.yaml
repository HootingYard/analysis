    I am pleased to report that Hooting Yard came out on top in a recent poll asking
    punters "Which blog with the word ''Hooting'' in its title do you think keeps
    its finger most firmly on the pulse of the global body politic?" Many thanks to
    the untold billions of readers who voted for us. Commemorative biros will be in
    the post shortly (ink not included).

    Sometimes, however, one has to hike elsewhere to find out what''s really going
    on, as airheads and conspiracy theorists like to put it. So today you had better
    open the door of my cupboard in The Dabbler, where the current unrest in Libya
    is fully and cogently analysed through the prism of some Libyan proverbs.'
