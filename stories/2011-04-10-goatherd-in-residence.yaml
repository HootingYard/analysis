  text: "In the same publication where Dennis Beerpint saw a classified advertisement\
    \ for the post of Poet In Residence at Beppo Lamont's Travelling Big Top Circus,\
    \ there was a similar item inviting applications for a Goatherd In Residence at\
    \ an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. This was the very same evaporated milk\
    \ factory where, many many years ago, Dobson served as a janitor, though during\
    \ the out of print pamphleteer's janitorial tenure the post of Resident Goatherd\
    \ did not exist.\nThe advert has led to conjecture that at least some of the milk\
    \ used for the manufacture of evaporated milk at the factory is goats\u2019 milk\
    \ which, as we know from H S Holmes Pegler's article on goat-keeping in The Listener,\
    \ Vol I No 16, 1st May 1929, has a \u201Cpeculiarly goaty flavour\u201D. In Winnipeg,\
    \ then, we would expect the resultant product to have a peculiarly evaporated,\
    \ goaty flavour. Taste tests are to be carried out, with the participation of\
    \ a volunteer panel, to ascertain if this is indeed the case.\nMeanwhile, a second\
    \ body of opinion has emerged, positing the possibility that it is not the peculiarly\
    \ goaty flavoured milk that is evaporated, but the goats themselves. But is it\
    \ likely, or even feasible, to effect the evaporation of a goat, a creature of\
    \ flesh and muscle and goaty sinew? A goatherd, charged with the care of the goats,\
    \ would hardly stand idly by, chewing a piece of straw, while his goats evaporated\
    \ before his startled eyes, would he? I suppose he might, if he were complicit\
    \ in their evaporation, if indeed he had been employed for the very purpose of\
    \ evaporating them, one by one, by fair means or foul. This might go some way\
    \ to explain the placing of an advertisement for the Goatherd In Residence in\
    \ an obscure and arcane academic journal, almost all the subscribers to which\
    \ are beardy postmodernist fatheads with little grasp of life in the raw, rather\
    \ than, say, in a cheaply photocopied newssheet for rustics, distributed by hand\
    \ at peasant gatherings and barn dances.\nOne way to find out what is really going\
    \ on at that evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg would be to undertake close observation\
    \ and regular, systematic counting of the goats. Thereagain, the goats may be\
    \ corralled at some ancillary goatstead at some distance from the evaporated milk\
    \ factory, on the outskirts of the city, even outwith Winnipeg itself. Such an\
    \ arrangement, of course, would necessitate the transportation of the evaporated\
    \ goats from goatstead to factory. It is difficult to imagine precisely what form\
    \ of transport one would use, to contain securely the evaporated essence of goat\
    \ in transit across the cold wastes of the state of Manitoba, without that peculiarly\
    \ goaty vaporous essence dispersing upon the winds. Are there canisters for the\
    \ purpose, made of mat\xE9riel with properties such as will not contaminate the\
    \ vapours and thus sully the peculiarly goaty flavour of the tinned product eventually\
    \ to find its way on to the shelves of our favourite evaporated milk retail outlets?\
    \ We would need to station observers along all the main freight routes into Winnipeg,\
    \ road, rail, and river, hoping to spot a telltale canister aboard a lorry or\
    \ cart or truck or train or barge, to follow its progress, and then to slink by\
    \ subterfuge into the unloading bay at the evaporated milk factory, to watch events\
    \ unfold. Dobson, during his janitorship, would have made the perfect \u201Cinside\
    \ man\u201D for the job. It is yet another example of an opportunity lost in his\
    \ long and ultimately tragic career.\nI have tried to find out who, if anybody,\
    \ applied for the post of Goatherd In Residence, but the Winnipeg evaporated milk\
    \ factory's Human and Capric Resources Department did not respond to my enquiries.\
    \ I am tempted to drop the matter, and instead embark upon urgent and overdue\
    \ pillow research. Tempted, but not yet decided. First I shall fix a tumbler of\
    \ cocoa, made with evaporated milk. I shall be alert for the peculiar flavour\
    \ of goat, evaporated or otherwise."
