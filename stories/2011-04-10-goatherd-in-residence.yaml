  text: 'In the same publication where Dennis Beerpint saw a classified advertisement
    for the post of Poet In Residence at Beppo Lamont''s Travelling Big Top Circus,
    there was a similar item inviting applications for a Goatherd In Residence at
    an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. This was the very same evaporated milk
    factory where, many many years ago, Dobson served as a janitor, though during
    the out of print pamphleteer''s janitorial tenure the post of Resident Goatherd
    did not exist.

    The advert has led to conjecture that at least some of the milk used for the manufacture
    of evaporated milk at the factory is goats'' milk which, as we know from H S Holmes
    Pegler''s article on goat-keeping in The Listener, Vol I No 16, 1st May 1929,
    has a "peculiarly goaty flavour". In Winnipeg, then, we would expect the resultant
    product to have a peculiarly evaporated, goaty flavour. Taste tests are to be
    carried out, with the participation of a volunteer panel, to ascertain if this
    is indeed the case.

    Meanwhile, a second body of opinion has emerged, positing the possibility that
    it is not the peculiarly goaty flavoured milk that is evaporated, but the goats
    themselves. But is it likely, or even feasible, to effect the evaporation of a
    goat, a creature of flesh and muscle and goaty sinew? A goatherd, charged with
    the care of the goats, would hardly stand idly by, chewing a piece of straw, while
    his goats evaporated before his startled eyes, would he? I suppose he might, if
    he were complicit in their evaporation, if indeed he had been employed for the
    very purpose of evaporating them, one by one, by fair means or foul. This might
    go some way to explain the placing of an advertisement for the Goatherd In Residence
    in an obscure and arcane academic journal, almost all the subscribers to which
    are beardy postmodernist fatheads with little grasp of life in the raw, rather
    than, say, in a cheaply photocopied newssheet for rustics, distributed by hand
    at peasant gatherings and barn dances.

    One way to find out what is really going on at that evaporated milk factory in
    Winnipeg would be to undertake close observation and regular, systematic counting
    of the goats. Thereagain, the goats may be corralled at some ancillary goatstead
    at some distance from the evaporated milk factory, on the outskirts of the city,
    even outwith Winnipeg itself. Such an arrangement, of course, would necessitate
    the transportation of the evaporated goats from goatstead to factory. It is difficult
    to imagine precisely what form of transport one would use, to contain securely
    the evaporated essence of goat in transit across the cold wastes of the state
    of Manitoba, without that peculiarly goaty vaporous essence dispersing upon the
    winds. Are there canisters for the purpose, made of materiel with properties such
    as will not contaminate the vapours and thus sully the peculiarly goaty flavour
    of the tinned product eventually to find its way on to the shelves of our favourite
    evaporated milk retail outlets? We would need to station observers along all the
    main freight routes into Winnipeg, road, rail, and river, hoping to spot a telltale
    canister aboard a lorry or cart or truck or train or barge, to follow its progress,
    and then to slink by subterfuge into the unloading bay at the evaporated milk
    factory, to watch events unfold. Dobson, during his janitorship, would have made
    the perfect "inside man" for the job. It is yet another example of an opportunity
    lost in his long and ultimately tragic career.

    I have tried to find out who, if anybody, applied for the post of Goatherd In
    Residence, but the Winnipeg evaporated milk factory''s Human and Capric Resources
    Department did not respond to my enquiries. I am tempted to drop the matter, and
    instead embark upon urgent and overdue pillow research. Tempted, but not yet decided.
    First I shall fix a tumbler of cocoa, made with evaporated milk. I shall be alert
    for the peculiar flavour of goat, evaporated or otherwise.'
