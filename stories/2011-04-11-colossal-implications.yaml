  text: 'The implications of this would seem to me to be quite colossal. [If a man
    could influence inanimate objects by the power of thought,] then surely it becomes
    more than possible that we all either have within our minds or can be in direct
    touch with powers so massive as to dwarf our mightiest machines and maybe ultimately
    to make our whole materialist technology obsolete? In medieval times, the Establishment,
    faced by such a threat to its orthodox beliefs, would quickly have burnt Uri Geller
    at the stake. In our more sophisticated modern world The Times simply maintains
    a dignified silence.

    Hamish Scott of London SW10, reading perhaps just a teensy bit too much into the
    conjuring tricks of Uri Geller, in a letter to The Times in 1973, quoted in Francis
    Wheen''s Strange Days Indeed : The Golden Age Of Paranoia (2009). A more sensible
    response to Mr Geller was uttered by Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, no less, who secured
    herself a wee corner in history when, on television early in this century, she
    uttered the immortal words "These are Uri''s underpants. Burn them." A contemporaneous
    report can be found here.'
