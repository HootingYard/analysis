  text: 'Bashed On The Bonce With A Sap By A Copper is a fascinating addition to what
    St Clair McKelway (1905-1980) called the "annals of crime and rascality". It is
    subtitled The Collected Arrests Of Detective Captain Cargpan, Volume One, which
    has devotees of the legendary policeman salivating with pleasure at the prospect
    of further bashing collections.

    For the time being, though, even Cargpan''s greatest fans ought to be sated by
    this rip roaring record of thousands of arrests. It includes famous cases such
    as Dinsmore the budgerigar trainer, the weighted jam-jar man, and the spectral
    cardigan-knitter of Cardiganshire, together with a host of the undeservedly obscure
    and neglected, including the beekeeper Plath and the toastrack poisoner of Box.
    The Detective Captain himself emerges as perhaps a more complex figure than hitherto
    acknowledged. I was surprised to learn, for example, that on many occasions he
    had his sidekicks rough up a culprit before bashing them on the bonce with his
    sap. Sometimes he whacked his lead-weighted sap on their bonce and in the kidneys.
    And it comes as a complete revelation to learn that he sometimes lit his pipe,
    crammed with acrid Serbian pipe tobacco, with one hand while simultaneously sapping
    a malefactor with the other. Most pipe smokers need one hand to hold the pipe
    and the other to steady the lit lucifer. It is a measure of Cargpan''s insouciance
    that he was able to deploy his pipe-igniting skills with such aplomb in the face
    of incorrigible villainy.

    Among the incidental pleasures of the book are the glimpses we get of the Detective
    Captain arriving at, and leaving, the scenes of arrest; a virtuoso description,
    covering forty pages, of the glint in his eye; and the lyrical evocation of the
    cellar down at the nick, its appurtenances and decor, the scene of so many vivid
    post-arrest roughings-up. For, in spite of that subtitle, this is not a mere record
    of Cargpan''s arrests alone. We are led from arrest to confession in almost every
    case, whether the miscreant blubs like a baby instantly, or it takes the sidekicks
    as long as ten minutes to extract an admission of their squalid criminality. In
    almost every case, note, because of course now and then one bash from Cargpan''s
    sap was all it took to send a ne''er-do-well spinning into the fiery satanic realm
    of death.

    If I have one criticism of the book, it is the absence of lurid high definition
    colour photographs of hapless villains reaping the grisly deserts of their malfeasance.
    Otherwise, it is a cracking good read, in more ways than one.
