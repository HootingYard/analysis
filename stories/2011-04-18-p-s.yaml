  text: 'Men do not, as a rule, use postscripts, and it is significant that artists
    and persons inclined toward the arts are much more given to postscripts than other
    kinds of men. One might almost say that women correspond by postscript; some of
    them put the subject of the letter in the postscript, as the scorpion keeps his
    poison in his tail. I have before me letters from Case 58, with two postscripts,
    and one extraordinary letter from Case 11, with four postscripts and a sentence
    written outside the envelope. This is the apogee of superficiality.
