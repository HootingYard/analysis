    Now you too can speak and write like Percy Grainger! At Strange Flowers, which
    I am extremely pleased to have discovered, James Conway provides a splendid list
    of Grainger-approved words. He explains:

    ... the older he got the more cantankerous he became. A 1958 piece entitled "The
    Things I Dislike" began "Almost everything. First of all foreigners, which means:
    all Europeans except the British, the Scandinavians & the Dutch."

    Grainger was nothing if not thorough, and his distrust of anything originating
    south of Holland led to him to try and purge his writing of Greco-Latin elements

    There is much more in the piece about the madcap Antipodean composer, but the
    highlight is the glossary itself. Go thou hence and memorise it, and soon you
    will be able to write vast epic poems akin to those of Charles Montague Doughty,
    surely Grainger''s guiding spirit?'
