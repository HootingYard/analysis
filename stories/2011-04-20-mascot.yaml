  text: "\nAt last, a proper job! It is with some pride that I announce my adoption\
    \ by an American baseball team as their mascot. According to the Baltimore Orioles,\
    \ I am \u201Ca family friendly character\u201D, and apparently I was unveiled\
    \ just last week, though I must admit I don't recall the event. Perhaps I was\
    \ taking a nap at the time.\nParticularly exciting is that I have been given my\
    \ own army, known as \u201CFrank Key's Army\u201D. I think I shall lead them on\
    \ manoeuvres in the near future, though rather than deploying them to one of the\
    \ world's trouble spots it might be more satisfying to set them, armed to the\
    \ teeth, upon defenceless persons I abhor. Luckily, I do not detest quite so many\
    \ people as Percy Grainger did, so the world is (relatively) safe in my hands.\n\
    Of course, becoming a deeply adored mascot would cause a swimming in the head\
    \ for an unstable or partly deranged person, so I will be careful to keep a proper\
    \ perspective. Now I must go and drill the troops and issue them with their blunderbusses,\
    \ muskets, and surface-to-air missiles.\n"
