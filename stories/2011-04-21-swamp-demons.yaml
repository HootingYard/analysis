  text: 'The weedy, asthmatic, fey and trembling poet Dennis Beerpint has, I am afraid
    to say, been caught red-handed in an act of blatant plagiarism. The title piece
    in his latest slim volume of twee verse, Swamp Demons, And Other Demons, And Other
    Swamps, has been copied word for word from the August-September 1936 issue of
    Weird Tales magazine, where it was correctly ascribed to the writer C A Butz.
    Reclining on a divan, feeling faintly ill, Beerpint has refused to comment on
    his act of poetic perfidy. Here is Butz''s original verse.

    The lights that wink across the sodden moor

    Like phosphorescent eyes that beckon men

    To risk fell footsteps in the treacherous fen,

    And sink in loathsome muck, without a spoor --

    What ghosts of former days, what dread allure,

    Abides within this subterranean den?

    Or, reaching out, snares victims to its ken,

    With wraith-like fingers, to a peril sure?

    ''Tis told that evil things lurk out of sight

    With human bones that fester in the ooze;

    Belike ''tis true, these bones that once were clothed

    In fleshly form now harbour deadly spite

    Against the living, and this swamp still brews

    Within its bubbling depths the curse men loathed

    Before they turned to leprous Things of Night!'
