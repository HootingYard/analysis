  text: "The weedy, asthmatic, fey and trembling poet Dennis Beerpint has, I am afraid\
    \ to say, been caught red-handed in an act of blatant plagiarism. The title piece\
    \ in his latest slim volume of twee verse, Swamp Demons, And Other Demons, And\
    \ Other Swamps, has been copied word for word from the August-September 1936 issue\
    \ of Weird Tales magazine, where it was correctly ascribed to the writer C A Butz.\
    \ Reclining on a divan, feeling faintly ill, Beerpint has refused to comment on\
    \ his act of poetic perfidy. Here is Butz's original verse.\nThe lights that wink\
    \ across the sodden moor\nLike phosphorescent eyes that beckon men\nTo risk fell\
    \ footsteps in the treacherous fen,\nAnd sink in loathsome muck, without a spoor\
    \ \u2014\nWhat ghosts of former days, what dread allure,\nAbides within this subterranean\
    \ den?\nOr, reaching out, snares victims to its ken,\nWith wraith-like fingers,\
    \ to a peril sure?\n\u2018Tis told that evil things lurk out of sight\nWith human\
    \ bones that fester in the ooze;\nBelike 'tis true, these bones that once were\
    \ clothed\nIn fleshly form now harbour deadly spite\nAgainst the living, and this\
    \ swamp still brews\nWithin its bubbling depths the curse men loathed\nBefore\
    \ they turned to leprous Things of Night!"
