  text: "No luck as yet with the decipherment of the great Steve Bloch's lyrical sally\
    \ in \u201CJane's Gone To France\u201D. But for those of you keen to see the resurrection\
    \ of perhaps the most important beat combo ever to mention Marshal Petain in a\
    \ song, here are some cuttings culled from distant outposts of Interwebshire.\n\
    First, two reviews of the magnum opus itself, from a couple of local rags. Please\
    \ note that a young Mr Key did not write either of them.\n\n\nSecond, unfortunately\
    \ as low in resolution as he was high in importance, Bloch himself, on stage.\n"
