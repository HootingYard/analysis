    In The Dabbler this week I examine in breathtaking detail the parliamentary career
    of a scientist who dabbled in politics. Dabbler he may have been, but Sir Isaac
    Newton''s record as a parliamentarian, albeit brief, was exemplary, and ought
    to serve as a model for some of the more loathsome specimens at large in the Palace
    of Westminster today.'
