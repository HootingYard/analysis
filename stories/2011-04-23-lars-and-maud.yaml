  text: "Lars and Maud went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.\nLars fell down\
    \ and clonked his crown and Maud came tumbling after.\nThey rolled and tumbled\
    \ further down, tumbling pell mell,\n\u2018Til they came bumping to a halt down\
    \ in the dingly dell.\nIn the dell lurked the Grunty Man, who carried them off\
    \ to his cave.\nBut fear not, tinies! For Lars was bold and Maud was very brave.\n\
    They shook their little fists and bawled and rent the sky asunder,\nAnd made the\
    \ Grunty Man commit a very foolish blunder.\nHe dropped them at the cave-mouth\
    \ while he went to have a fight,\nAn illegal boxing match under the cover of the\
    \ night.\nThe Grunty Man was pitted \u2018gainst an awful, dreadful foe \u2013\
    \nNone other than Miss Peep, affectionately known as \u201CLittle Bo\u201D.\n\
    She looked so pale and timorous, yet she packed a hefty punch,\nAnd often bashed\
    \ a dozen ogres before she had her lunch.\nSo when the Grunty Man stalked off\
    \ to meet his Nemesis,\nLars and Maud ran off into the arms of Alger Hiss.\nYes,\
    \ Alger Hiss, the communist spy from Washington DC!\nUrbane and droll and stylish,\
    \ dressed up to a T.\nHe took the tots to a meeting of his fellow-travelling Reds,\n\
    Where Stalinist propaganda turned their pointy little heads.\nThey went back to\
    \ the cave and found the Grunty Man covered in gore.\nLittle Bo Peep had bashed\
    \ him up, then bashed him up some more.\nThey recruited him to their cause, to\
    \ overthrow the state.\nSaid Lars (or Maud) \u201CWe must act before it is too\
    \ late!\u201D\nSo Lars and Maud and the Grunty Man went back to the dingly dell,\n\
    And hid some microfilmed secrets at the bottom of the well.\nBut they were caught\
    \ by Nixon, indefatigable in his zest\nTo place as many Reds as possible under\
    \ house arrest.\nHe confined them to a house atop the hill they climbed for water,\n\
    A solid and a sturdy house well built from bricks and mortar,\nLike the house\
    \ of the three little pigs that withstood lupine huff and puff.\nBut Lars and\
    \ Maud and the Grunty Man were Communists, sure enough.\nSo when the big bad wolf\
    \ hove into view from o'er the hills,\nThey sang in praise of Stalin and then\
    \ swallowed their cyanide pills.\nAnd so the state was safe once more from Communist\
    \ infiltration,\nAnd Nixon was bathed in the praise of a relieved and grateful\
    \ nation.\nThe Grunty Man and Lars and Maud were buried and forgot.\nBut Richard\
    \ Milhous Nixon\u2014he is not."
