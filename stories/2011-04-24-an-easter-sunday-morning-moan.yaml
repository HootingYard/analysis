  text: 'Prompted by his recent piece in The Dabbler, I decided to improve my ornithological
    knowledge by reading Tim Birkhead''s The Wisdom Of Birds. And lo! that is how
    I began my Easter Sunday on this sunny morning, to the sound of cawing crows outside.


    I am afraid to say I am ready to hurl the book across the room in exasperation.
    This is an expensive and lavishly-produced Bloomsbury book, and by page 18 I have
    fought my way past no fewer than three howling typos: a missing indefinite article
    on page 2, "who" for "how" on page 6, and "know" for "known" on page 18. This
    is proofreading-by-spellcheck, and it simply isn''t good enough.

    I shall persevere, for the time being. But this slipshod approach fatally undermines
    the pleasure of reading, for me. Tim Birkhead has been ill-served by his publishers.
    I''d insist on getting the whole print-run pulped and starting again, with a competent
    copy editor.

    UPDATE : Still on page 18, and another one!--"principle" where what is meant is
    "principal".'
