  text: "Prompted by his recent piece in The Dabbler, I decided to improve my ornithological\
    \ knowledge by reading Tim Birkhead's The Wisdom Of Birds. And lo! that is how\
    \ I began my Easter Sunday on this sunny morning, to the sound of cawing crows\
    \ outside.\n\nI am afraid to say I am ready to hurl the book across the room in\
    \ exasperation. This is an expensive and lavishly-produced Bloomsbury book, and\
    \ by page 18 I have fought my way past no fewer than three howling typos: a missing\
    \ indefinite article on page 2, \u201Cwho\u201D for \u201Chow\u201D on page 6,\
    \ and \u201Cknow\u201D for \u201Cknown\u201D on page 18. This is proofreading-by-spellcheck,\
    \ and it simply isn't good enough.\nI shall persevere, for the time being. But\
    \ this slipshod approach fatally undermines the pleasure of reading, for me. Tim\
    \ Birkhead has been ill-served by his publishers. I'd insist on getting the whole\
    \ print-run pulped and starting again, with a competent copy editor.\nUPDATE\_\
    : Still on page 18, and another one!\u2014\u201Cprinciple\u201D where what is\
    \ meant is \u201Cprincipal\u201D."
