  text: 'Earlier today I was rummaging in the ReR Megacorp catalogue when I discovered,
    somewhat to my astonishment, that Mr Cutler''s emporium has "a few copies" of
    House Of Turps for sale.


    He describes it as "classic Oulipoesque Keyiana" which is fairly accurate. It
    is a booklet originally published by the Malice Aforethought Press in 1987, although
    the copies available may be from a second print-run made as the "gift item" appended
    to subscribers'' copies of one of the legendary ReR Quarterlies. (Incidentally,
    besotted devotees may wish to snap up the entire collection of Quarterlies, two
    sets of which also seem to be available.)

    Here, then, is your chance to clasp to your heaving bosom a true rarity, nigh
    on a quarter of a century old. I suggest you hie hence and place your order and
    send Mr Cutler your monies.'
