  text: "He came, clutching an Alpenstock, from the far Tyrol.\nHe joined the Baader-Meinhof\
    \ Gang, along with Astrid Proll.\nHe joined an English folk group, and sang a\
    \ Fol De Rol.\nAnd no one ever realised that he was a wooden doll.\nHis name was\
    \ not Pinocchio, a different wooden boy.\nOur hero's name, quite weirdly, he shared\
    \ with Myrna Loy,\nThat siren of the silver screen who brought filmgoers much\
    \ joy.\nOur Myrna was a terrorist and a folkie, a simple wooden toy.\nPinocchio's\
    \ nose, you will recall, grew longer as he lied.\nBut Myrna Loy's did not, he\
    \ took truth as his guide.\nWell, he only did so after Ulrike Meinhof died.\n\
    For on that day \_his revolutionary fervour was cast aside.\nHe cast aside the\
    \ folk group too, hey nonny nonny no.\nHe met a man in a field, one man who went\
    \ to mow.\nHe lay down on the fresh-mown grass, he had nowhere else to go\nAnd\
    \ Myrna Loy, when winter came, was buried under snow.\nHe lay there until springtime,\
    \ a wooden boy, frozen, dead\nUntil he was found by urchins, who carried him to\
    \ a shed.\nThey dismantled him piece by piece, the urchins Lars and Ned.\nAnd\
    \ then they had a game of football with his wooden head.\nSo when you tour, with\
    \ your Alpenstock, the fabled far Tyrol,\nSay a prayer for Myrna Loy, the dismantled\
    \ wooden doll."
