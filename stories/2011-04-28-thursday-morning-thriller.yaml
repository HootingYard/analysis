  text: Little did Sir Foljambe Junket suspect, as he was poised to dunk a Rich Tea
    biscuit into his piping hot cup of Darjeeling, that he was about to precipitate
    a series of events that would lead to the toppling of one of the great crowned
    heads of Europe, events involving a bewildering cast of Lascars, dacoits, thugs,
    assassins, diplomats, remittance men, bankers, parish constables, distressed gentlewomen,
    flappers, floozies, defrocked Jesuits, pastry chefs, princelings, Savoyards, cutthroats,
    bellringers, sots, wastrels, ragamuffins, street urchins, detectives, privateers,

    movers and shakers and Quakers and bootblacks and boffins and henchmen and murderers
    and tallymen and bus conductors and even the Crown Prince himself. His biscuit
    hovering over the cup, Sir Foljambe paused before dunking. The thing about a Rich
    Tea biscuit, he thought, was that it had the consistency of cardboard and tasted
    of nothing. Dunked, it had the consistency of hot wet cardboard and still tasted
    of nothing. Of a sudden, with uncharacteristic impetuosity, he flung the biscuit
    across the room, where it clattered against the wainscot and broke into smithereens.
    Did he but know it, the aged grandee had, at the eleventh hour, averted a series
    of events that would have led to the toppling of one of the great crowned heads
    of Europe, events involving a bewildering cast of Lascars, dacoits, thugs, assassins,
    diplomats, remittance men, bankers, parish constables, distressed gentlewomen,
