  text: 'Roll up, see this pig in the balloon basket!

    Any question you have, you must ask it.

    Within its brain sparks''ll zag and zig.

    It is the Intelligent Aerial Pig.

    The balloon is up high so you''ll have to shout

    Whatever your query, bawl it out.

    The pig will answer as best it is able

    And send its reply down the tethering cable.

    It taps its trotters on one end of the rope,

    Once for "Yes" and twice for "Nope"

    I feel the vibrations down here on the ground

    And tell you the answer in return for a pound.

    I spend all the profits on pigfeed and swill

    Bought from the farmyard just past yonder hill.

    That''s where the pig has its earthly sty

    When not answering questions from its perch in the sky.

    So put your query, hand over your cash,

    Before the balloon comes down with a crash

    The Intelligent Pig will suffer no harm

    Or, if it does, I shall smear it with balm.

    Balloons tend to plummet if not kept aloft

    But all will be well if the landing is soft

    That''s why I''ve strewn all these cushions and pillows

    Across the fields as far as those willows

    The willows that weep, that sob, that bewail

    When I end up being carted off to gaol

    Accused of being a scoundrel and rotter

    Pretending to count the taps of a trotter

    There''s no pig up there borne by balloon

    It''s as fanciful as the man in the moon

    But when I get out from my durance vile

    You''ll see that my face bears a glittering smile

    I''ve had an idea that''s sure to win big

    An invisible intelligent aerial pig.'
