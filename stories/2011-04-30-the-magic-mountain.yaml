  text: "Fair stood the wind for France\nThe land in which I'll prance\nAlong the\
    \ boulevards and rues\nIn my winklepicker shoes\nThen to Switzerland I'll proceed\n\
    To the Alps! Fear not, I'll heed\nWarnings about the high thin air\nWhich warn\
    \ my brain may need repair\nBut that thin air is just the thing\nFor those of\
    \ us who're suffering\nWho suffer as I do from TB\nLying shattered on a balcony\n\
    High in the Alps\u2019 imperious span\nLike a character from Thomas Mann"
