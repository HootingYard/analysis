  text: 'Fair stood the wind for France

    The land in which I''ll prance

    Along the boulevards and rues

    In my winklepicker shoes

    Then to Switzerland I''ll proceed

    To the Alps! Fear not, I''ll heed

    Warnings about the high thin air

    Which warn my brain may need repair

    But that thin air is just the thing

    For those of us who''re suffering

    Who suffer as I do from TB

    Lying shattered on a balcony

    High in the Alps'' imperious span

    Like a character from Thomas Mann'
