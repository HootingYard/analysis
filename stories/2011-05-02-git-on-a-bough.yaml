  text: 'I am a grandee

    I have a long beard

    And I wear a big hat made of fur

    I sit in a tree

    And things become weird

    When the cogs in my brain start to whirr

    Birds fall from the sky

    Lakes boil to steam

    Hens and chickens come home to roost

    Oh do not ask why

    It is not a dream

    But the tethers of sense are unloos''d

    The tree is a pine

    I perch on a bough

    My grandeur will dazzle your sight

    "O give us a sign!

    And give it us now!"

    You caterwaul with all your might

    But I just sit

    And gesticulate

    And summon up thunder and storm

    ''Cos I am a git

    Deciding your fate

    You''ll wish you had never been born'
