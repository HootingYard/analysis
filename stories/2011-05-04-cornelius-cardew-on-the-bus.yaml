  text: 'On the bus : I have to write to distract me from the woman, the warm pressure
    of the femme de trente ans, her softest arm. Boulez--rescue--your programme note
    must curb my corpuscular eruptions.

    Cornelius Cardew, aged twenty-two, in his journal, quoted in Cornelius Cardew
    : A Life Unfinished by John Tilbury (2008). I have just begun reading this book,
    which--at over a thousand pages--is clearly both a Herculean labour of love (thirty
    years in the writing) and mildly bonkers. In other words, the best kind of biography.
    Expect further reports as I wade through it.
