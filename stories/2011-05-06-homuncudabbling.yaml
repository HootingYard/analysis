    Over at the super soaraway Dabbler this week I provide readers with some tips
    on how to make a homunculus. These miniature persons can be very helpful, if a
    bit eerie. Hooting Yard certainly couldn''t cope unless we had a little band of
    homunculi scurrying about taking care of business and protecting us from harm.
