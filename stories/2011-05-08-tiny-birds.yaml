  text: 'Mr Key is taking a brief break from Hooting Yard duties to attend to a number
    of matters in the mundane world. Rather than wailing and gnashing your teeth and
    rending your garments in the extremity of despair, you should pop round to Diana
    Sudyka''s Tiny Aviary. I am most grateful to reader Richard Carter for telling
    me about it. Don''t miss the plaster monster loon!
