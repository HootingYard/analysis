  text: '

    Hooting Yard remains in what I like to think of, melodramatically, as a security
    lockdown, but my cupboard over at The Dabbler has not been neglected. Yesterday
    it contained some useful tips on dealing with your foes, if you have any. Meanwhile,
    I may be approaching the end of my unplanned yet necessary diversion away from
    the important business of tippy-tapping majestic prose, and should be back soon.'
