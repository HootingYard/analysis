  text: 'I noted below that when my Flemish-speaking mother wanted to improve her
    English, she worked her way through the classics of literature. Nowadays, we just
    slump in front of the television and watch foreign-language thrillers on BBC4.
    Thus I have embarked upon a crash-course in Danish by watching, somewhat belatedly,
    Forbrydelsen, or The Killing, the highly popular murder ''n'' knitwear detective
    series. Apart from being a splendid example of Nick Cohen''s observation that
    ethnic minorities are never the villains in BBC cop shows, the series has done
    wonders for my Danish language skills. I think I could successfully apply for
    an IT post in Copenhagen, armed with these additions to my vocabulary:

    English : computer. Danish : compuder.

    English : password. Danish : password.

    English : fuck-up. Danish : fuck-up.'
