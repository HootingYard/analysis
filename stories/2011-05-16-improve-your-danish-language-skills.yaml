  text: "I noted below that when my Flemish-speaking mother wanted to improve her\
    \ English, she worked her way through the classics of literature. Nowadays, we\
    \ just slump in front of the television and watch foreign-language thrillers on\
    \ BBC4. Thus I have embarked upon a crash-course in Danish by watching, somewhat\
    \ belatedly, Forbrydelsen, or The Killing, the highly popular murder \u2018n\u2019\
    \ knitwear detective series. Apart from being a splendid example of Nick Cohen's\
    \ observation that ethnic minorities are never the villains in BBC cop shows,\
    \ the series has done wonders for my Danish language skills. I think I could successfully\
    \ apply for an IT post in Copenhagen, armed with these additions to my vocabulary:\n\
    English\_: computer. Danish\_: compuder.\nEnglish\_: password. Danish\_: password.\n\
    English\_: fuck-up. Danish\_: fuck-up."
