  text: 'Every so often I find myself devising grand schemes and projects. These rarely
    come to fruition. One that did, probably because it was modest in its ambitions,
    was last year''s set of alphabetic postages here at Hooting Yard, where I adopted
    the constraint of posting twenty-six consecutive entries, entitled A through to
    Z. One that didn''t was the plan that my pre-Wilderness Years pamphlet House Of
    Turps would be the first volume in a series of twenty-six. I think this scheme
    failed primarily because it was never clear in my then-fuddled brain how the succeeding
    twenty-five pamphlets were intended to relate to the first one.

    So the likelihood is that the preposterous plot hatched this morning will remain
    incomplete, if indeed it is ever even begun. It occurred to me that I ought to
    devote my time to tippy-tapping a blog postage for every single word listed in
    the Oxford English Dictionary, in alphabetical order. According to Oxford Dictionaries,
    "the Second Edition of the 20-volume  Oxford English Dictionary contains full
    entries for 171,476 words in current use, and 47,156 obsolete words. To this may
    be added around 9,500 derivative words included as subentries". Since January
    2007 there have been 1,607 Hooting Yard postages (this is the 1,608th) to which
    one can add just short of a thousand entries in the archive for the previous format
    between 2003 and 2006. Clearly I would be taking on a gargantuan task, particularly
    given that I would want each and every postage to be packed with sweeping Dobsonian
    paragraphs of majestic prose. Even if I confine myself to the obsolete words--a
    highly tempting grand plan in itself--it would take years and years of toil, quite
    possibly more years than remain to me on this spinning terrestrial globe.

    I may, however, make a start, in the near future. Foolhardy, I know, but then
    I am living in a fool''s paradise, am I not?'
