  text: "Every so often I find myself devising grand schemes and projects. These rarely\
    \ come to fruition. One that did, probably because it was modest in its ambitions,\
    \ was last year's set of alphabetic postages here at Hooting Yard, where I adopted\
    \ the constraint of posting twenty-six consecutive entries, entitled A through\
    \ to Z. One that didn't was the plan that my pre-Wilderness Years pamphlet House\
    \ Of Turps would be the first volume in a series of twenty-six. I think this scheme\
    \ failed primarily because it was never clear in my then-fuddled brain how the\
    \ succeeding twenty-five pamphlets were intended to relate to the first one.\n\
    So the likelihood is that the preposterous plot hatched this morning will remain\
    \ incomplete, if indeed it is ever even begun. It occurred to me that I ought\
    \ to devote my time to tippy-tapping a blog postage for every single word listed\
    \ in the Oxford English Dictionary, in alphabetical order. According to Oxford\
    \ Dictionaries, \u201Cthe Second Edition of the 20-volume\_ Oxford English Dictionary\
    \ contains full entries for 171,476 words in current use, and 47,156 obsolete\
    \ words. To this may be added around 9,500 derivative words included as subentries\u201D\
    . Since January 2007 there have been 1,607 Hooting Yard postages (this is the\
    \ 1,608th) to which one can add just short of a thousand entries in the archive\
    \ for the previous format between 2003 and 2006. Clearly I would be taking on\
    \ a gargantuan task, particularly given that I would want each and every postage\
    \ to be packed with sweeping Dobsonian paragraphs of majestic prose. Even if I\
    \ confine myself to the obsolete words\u2014a highly tempting grand plan in itself\u2014\
    it would take years and years of toil, quite possibly more years than remain to\
    \ me on this spinning terrestrial globe.\nI may, however, make a start, in the\
    \ near future. Foolhardy, I know, but then I am living in a fool's paradise, am\
    \ I not?"
