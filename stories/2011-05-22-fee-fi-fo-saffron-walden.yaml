  text: 'Recently I posted a piece about a giant who roars "Fee Fi Fo Fum!" and smells
    the blood of an Englishman, and a couple of years ago I became enthusiastic about
    Thomas Nashe (1567-c.1601) among whose works is the splendidly titled Have With
    You To Saffron Walden--which, alas, I never got round to reading. Had I done so,
    I would already have learned what I found out today.

    Father had taken us to see John Gielgud in the title role [of King Lear] at Stratford-upon-Avon,
    and although Gielgud was marvellous, it was the words of Poor Tom, the Bedlam
    beggar on the stormy heath (actually Edgar, in disguise), that still rang in my
    ears:

    Child Rowland to the dark tower came;

    His word was still

    Fie, foh, and fum!

    I smell the blood of a British man!

    "Did Shakespeare steal that from Jack and the Beanstalk?" I had whispered in Daffy''s
    ear. Or had the fairytale borrowed the words from Shakespeare? "Neither," she
    whispered back: both had cribbed them from Thomas Nashe''s Have With You To Saffron
    Walden, which, having been staged in 1596, pre-dated them.

    This is from The Weed That Strings The Hangman''s Bag by Alan Bradley (2010),
    the second of his Flavia de Luce mysteries. These are new to me, but I am pleased
    to tell you that the heroine is an eleven-year-old amateur chemist and sleuth--a
    plucky and resourceful tot who bears a striking resemblance to our very own Tiny
    Enid, without the fascism and the club foot. It is a hugely enjoyable read, as
    one might expect from a book which makes mention of "a pair of gutta-percha motoring
    galoshes (''Ideal for Country Breakdowns'')".'
