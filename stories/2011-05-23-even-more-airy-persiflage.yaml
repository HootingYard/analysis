  text: "At Airy Persiflage, the golden-voiced Mister Nizz recites useful hoofprint\
    \ advice first delivered to readers and listeners here at Hooting Yard. Mr Key\
    \ is apparently the \u201Cfavourite hard-living surrealist\u201D chez Nizz, though\
    \ at least two of those terms are decisively erroneous. Links to earlier splendid\
    \ readings by the Nizzter are here and here. Listen and learn."
