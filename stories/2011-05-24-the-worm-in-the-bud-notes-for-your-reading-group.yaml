    Questions And Guidelines For Discussion

    Why do you think the narrator enters a copse rather than, say, a spinney?

    Make a list of the kinds of plants likely to be found in a copse far from the
    nearest town.

    The narrator tells us his hands are hairy. Are yours?

    Give a detailed character sketch and potted biography of Zoltan.

    Embroider a counterpane similar to the one across which the worm crawls.

    Do you think Babinsky is (a) evil, or (b) sick? If and when he is eventually caught,
    do you think he should be (i) confined to a prison, (ii) confined to a lunatic
    asylum, (iii) hacked to pieces by an angry mob, or (iv) allowed to escape scot
    free to resume his catalogue of enormities?

    Why do you think the narrator drinks Squelcho! rather than a nice piping hot cup
    of tea?

    When he titled one of his angry Scottish novels How Late It Was, How Late, do
    you think angry Scotsman James Kelman was thinking about your own Hooting Yard
    Reading Group and its tendency to continue wittering on and on until the cows
    come home?'
