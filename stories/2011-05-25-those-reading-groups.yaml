  text: 'An inexplicable circumstance has been drawn to my attention.

    Dear Mr Key, writes Dimity Cashew, You seem to think that all your devotees belong
    to Hooting Yard Reading Groups, groups which meet to discuss your works long into
    the night, until one among them remarks how late it is, how late, and the cows
    come home. Well, I for one am a member of no such group, though I am a loyal devotee
    who has been reading your mighty prose since time immemorial, or thereabouts.
    I devour your outpourings daily, reading the postages on my comp-yoo-dah, or via
    the special app on my iHoot, or by poring over your splendid paperback books.
    Sometimes I even listen to the podcasts, where I might be fortunate enough to
    hear some of your stories in between all that coughing and spluttering. The point
    is that, however I choose to ingest your blatherings, I do so alone, and I never
    discuss the experience with another living soul, not even with Little Severin,
    my pet badger. (Actually, I must confess that I did once express an opinion on
    one of your pieces to Little Severin, but being a badger, he neither comprehends
    nor is able to imitate human speech, so that was something of a fool''s errand
    on my part. It is true that he is a mystic badger, but his mysticism is confined
    to prognostications of the future derived from scrubbling about in undergrowth,
    akin to the way a haruspex would read the hot and bloody entrails of a recently
    slaughtered poultry bird.) I cannot begin to imagine what it would be like to
    sit around with a groupuscule of other Hooting Yard readers, babbling about your
    prose off the tops of our heads. The thought had never even occurred to me. Now
    it has, I am quite intrigued. Do you have any tips on how I might set about organising
    such a group, including some guidance on what manner of refreshments I ought to
    make available? Please note that I am currently residing on a remote and barren
    atoll, plopped somewhere in the middle of a wild and wanton sea, with only a ragged
    tarpaulin for shelter, and Little Severin for company.

    I am pleased to inform Ms Cashew that I have made special arrangements for a jet
    aircraft to zoom over her atoll later in the week, spelling out clear and comprehensive
    instructions for the setting up of a Hooting Yard Reading Group by means of ingeniously-patterned
    vapour trails emblazoned across the blue, blue, cloudless sky.'
