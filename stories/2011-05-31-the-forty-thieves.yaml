  text: "I have been wondering about the forty thieves in the tale of Ali Baba. As\
    \ far as I am aware, we do not know their names, as we do the names of the seven\
    \ dwarves in the story of Snow White. Admittedly, I have not done a lot of research.\
    \ Knud Padde\u2014of whom more, much more, later\u2014has done such research,\
    \ however, and in a privately-printed monograph he supplies us with this list:"
