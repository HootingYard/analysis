  text: "Hello there. I am the King. See my crown. See my sceptre. See my baubles\
    \ and my magnificence. I am like unto a god, am I not? When I snap my fingers,\
    \ equerries come sprinting. They fawn and scrape. I demand sausages, and sausages\
    \ are fetched. I demand the sun to be blotted out, and the sun is blotted out.\
    \ I demand the head of my enemy impaled upon an iron spike, and my enemy is tracked\
    \ to his lair and beheaded and his head is impaled upon an iron spike and it is\
    \ brought to me by my equerries. If I should change my mind and wish to unbehead\
    \ my enemy and show him mercy, to have him skip and frolic about the palace for\
    \ my amusement, then his head is plucked from the spike and glued back on to his\
    \ neck and his body is animated by fearsome bolts of electricity and he jerks\
    \ and skips and frolics as is my whim. Should I wish to engage him in conversation\
    \ a ventriloquist is found, in some remote village, and brought to the palace\
    \ to practise his skills. The conversation might go something like this:\nKing\
    \ \u2013 When you have finished skipping and frolicking, would you like a bite\
    \ of my sausage?\nEnemy\u2014Oh yes please Sire!\nKing \u2013 Then a bite of my\
    \ sausage you shall have! Cease your cavortings and chew!\nEnemy\u2014Thank you\
    \ Sire!\nThen one of my equerries will work the jaws of my enemy, by sleight of\
    \ hand, to bite off a portion of sausage. Further bolts of electricity will be\
    \ applied if necessary, when the equerry is standing well back, unless the equerry\
    \ is dispensable. Some equerries are, some aren't. To help me remember which is\
    \ which I have them wear different-coloured caps. I designed the caps myself,\
    \ for I take a great deal of interest in uniforms and insignia. When an equerry\
    \ wears incorrect dress, or is insufficiently spruce, I fly into a rage and order\
    \ the laying waste of that part of my kingdom from whence the offending equerry\
    \ hails. Alas, there are fibbing equerries, and on occasion entirely innocent\
    \ parts of the kingdom have been obliterated by fire and sword. This is how it\
    \ might happen:\nKing\u2014You are wearing the Emblazured Ribbon of Gack on your\
    \ left arm instead of your right, you scruffy ingrate! Tell me from what part\
    \ of my kingdom you hail!\nEquerry (fibbing)\u2014From Sniggleby Marshes, Sire!\n\
    King\u2014Then Sniggleby Marshes shall be laid waste this very hour!\nEquerry\u2014\
    Yes Sire, I shall see to it at once!\nShort of inventing a truth serum it is not\
    \ clear to me how such misobliterations can be avoided. Mind you, I have invented\
    \ many other things. I invented the self-polishing crown, the hovering kingly\
    \ orb, and the regal smokers\u2019 poptart toasting fork, not to mention a special\
    \ cushion upon which to rest my swollen head. It is a speaking cushion. As soon\
    \ as it comes into contact with my head, it tells me, repeatedly, in my own kingly\
    \ voice, what a fantastic and magnificent king I am. The glorious words travel\
    \ through my ears into my brain, just as these glorious words I am speaking now\
    \ travel through your ears, O peasants, into your brains. An equerry wrote the\
    \ speech for me. Which reminds me, I had better check what colour his cap is.\
    \ I shall do so now. You may rise from where you sprawl in the muck and go about\
    \ your business, tilling the fields, bringing in the sheaves. Begone!"
