  text: 'Do I know what my colours are?

    Do I make my vowels sing?

    Am I direct, sincere and simple?

    Do I know the proper way to sit in and rise from a chair?

    Am I lovable?

    Am I original?

    Am I valiant?

    Have I made a legal will?

    Do I know where it is?

    Do I hang up my clothes as soon as I take them off?

    Do I sew a snap-fastener on to each end of a piece of tape about an inch and a
    half long, and sew these tapes in the centre of all shoulder seams?

    Am I so poised, so on my centre, so innately joyous that life cannot sway me this
    way or that?

    Jill Edwards'' Self-Searcher, a series of questions for daily reflection, quoted
    in Against The American Grain : Essays On The Effects Of Mass Culture by Dwight
    Macdonald (1962).'
