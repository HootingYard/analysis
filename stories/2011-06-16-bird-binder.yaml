  text: 'I mentioned the other day that I have mislaid my binder of ornithological
    resources. I have hunted and searched and rummaged and fossicked, high and low,
    in every nook and every cranny, but still have not found it. I would be grateful
    if you would add a plea for its discovery to your daily prayers, for I fear that
    without my bird binder Hooting Yard itself may simply grind to a halt. Without
    it, whole swathes of this website could never have been written.

    It is a chunky ring-binder, somewhat battered with age, into which are crammed
    a lifetime''s accumulation of paper-based bird documentation: notes on nesting
    habits and flight and swoop patterns; profile depictions of beaks and bills; feathery
    prose-poems; transcriptions of song and trill and chirrup and caw and shriek and
    warble and tweet; egg lists; talon imprintings; brain scans; analysis of millet
    and tiny semi-digested mammals and owl pellets; and so on ad avian.

    In the nineteen-seventies, leftist theoreticians coined the phrase "actually existing
    socialism" to account for the fact that Communist regimes such as those in Eastern
    Europe, rather than being the Utopia of their dreams, were drab grey concrete
    hellholes. By the same token, my bird binder represents what I like to think of
    as "actually existing ornithology". It is a field in which my expertise is, or
    at least ought to be, unquestioned.

    Bereft of my binder, I am lost, like a blind man stumbling in fog, in danger of
    plunging down a crevasse, at the bottom of which are piled the bleached and brittle
    bones of long dead Elephant Birds and Upland Moas and Kangaroo Island Emus and
    West Coast Spotted Kiwis and Korean Crested Shelducks and Amsterdam Island Ducks
    and Pink-Headed Ducks and Reunion Pochards and Auckland Island Mergansers and
    Pile-Builder Megapodes and Viti Levu Scrubfowls and Himalayan Quails and Javanese

    New Caledonian and the Wake Island and the Dieffenbach''s and the Vava''u and
    the Chatham and the Hawaiian and the Laysan, among Rails, and Ascension Flightless
    Crakes and Saint Helena Crakes and also from Saint Helena Saint Helena Swamphens
    and then Tristan Moorhens and Mascarene Coots and Colombian Grebes and Bermuda
    Night Herons and New Zealand Little Bitterns and Reunion Sacred Ibises and Spectacled
    Cormorants and both Small and Large Saint Helena Petrels and Guadalupe Storm-Petrels

    and Starlings, so many Starlings!, the Kosrae Island and the Mysterious and the

    Grand Cayman Thrushes and Cozumel Thrashers and Black-Lored Waxbills and Slender-Billed

    Finches and Bonin Grosbeaks and both Lesser and Greater Koa Finches and Kakawahies
    and Black Mamos and Hooded Seedeaters and Arabian Ostriches and Bering Cackling
    Geese, so many dead birds, so many bird bones, piled high and white, it is a wonder
    I could name so many, without the aid of my bird binder. Therein lies the beauty,
    the dazzling beauty, of actually existing ornithology.'
