  text: 'I mentioned the other day that I have mislaid my binder of ornithological
    resources. I have hunted and searched and rummaged and fossicked, high and low,
    in every nook and every cranny, but still have not found it. I would be grateful
    if you would add a plea for its discovery to your daily prayers, for I fear that
    without my bird binder Hooting Yard itself may simply grind to a halt. Without
    it, whole swathes of this website could never have been written.

    It is a chunky ring-binder, somewhat battered with age, into which are crammed
    a lifetime''s accumulation of paper-based bird documentation: notes on nesting
    habits and flight and swoop patterns; profile depictions of beaks and bills; feathery
    prose-poems; transcriptions of song and trill and chirrup and caw and shriek and
    warble and tweet; egg lists; talon imprintings; brain scans; analysis of millet
    and tiny semi-digested mammals and owl pellets; and so on ad avian.

    In the nineteen-seventies, leftist theoreticians coined the phrase "actually existing
    socialism" to account for the fact that Communist regimes such as those in Eastern
    Europe, rather than being the Utopia of their dreams, were drab grey concrete
    hellholes. By the same token, my bird binder represents what I like to think of
    as "actually existing ornithology". It is a field in which my expertise is, or
    at least ought to be, unquestioned.

    Bereft of my binder, I am lost, like a blind man stumbling in fog, in danger of
    plunging down a crevasse, at the bottom of which are piled the bleached and brittle
    bones of long dead Elephant Birds and Upland Moas and Kangaroo Island Emus and
    West Coast Spotted Kiwis and Korean Crested Shelducks and Amsterdam Island Ducks
    and Pink-Headed Ducks and Reunion Pochards and Auckland Island Mergansers and
    Pile-Builder Megapodes and Viti Levu Scrubfowls and Himalayan Quails and Javanese
    Lapwings and Tahitian Sandpipers and North Island Snipes and Eskimo Curlews and
    Great Auks and Canarian Black Oystercatchers and a plethora of Rails, the Antillean
    Cave and the Hawkins and the Red and the Rodrigues and the Bar-Winged and the
    New Caledonian and the Wake Island and the Dieffenbach''s and the Vava''u and
    the Chatham and the Hawaiian and the Laysan, among Rails, and Ascension Flightless
    Crakes and Saint Helena Crakes and also from Saint Helena Saint Helena Swamphens
    and then Tristan Moorhens and Mascarene Coots and Colombian Grebes and Bermuda
    Night Herons and New Zealand Little Bitterns and Reunion Sacred Ibises and Spectacled
    Cormorants and both Small and Large Saint Helena Petrels and Guadalupe Storm-Petrels
    and Chatham Island Penguins and Bonin Woodpigeons and Reunion Pink Pigeons and
    Rodrigues Turtle-Doves and Sulu Bleeding-Hearts and Norfolk Island Ground-Doves
    and Thick-Billed Ground-Doves and Red-Moustached Fruit-Doves and Mauritius Blue
    Pigeons and Dodos and Society Parakeets and Paradise Parrots and Oceanic Eclectus
    Parrots and Newton''s Parakeets and Glaucous Macaws and Martinique Amazons and
    Delalande''s Cuas and Saint Helena Cuckoos and Guadalupe Caracaras and Reunion
    Kestrels and Mauritius Owls and New Caledonian Booboks and Laughing Owls and Puerto
    Rican Barn-Owls and Jamaican Pauraques and Coppery Thorntails and Brace''s Emeralds
    and Bogota Sunangels and Turquoise-Throated Pufflegs and Giant Hoopoes and Imperial
    Woodpeckers and Bush Wrens and Chatham Island Bellbirds and Lord Howe Gerygones
    and Mangarevan Whistlers and Nuku Hiva Monarchs and Guam Flycatchers and Short-Toed
    Nuthatch Vangas and both North Island and South Island Piopios and Huias and White-Eyed
    River Martins and Red Sea Swallows and Moorea Reed-Warblers and Rueck''s Blue
    Flycatchers and Chatham Island Fernbirds and Tana River Cisticolas and Black-Browed
    Babblers and White-Chested White-Eyes and Rodrigues Bulbuls and Aldabra Brush-Warblers
    and Starlings, so many Starlings!, the Kosrae Island and the Mysterious and the
    Tasman and the Pohnpei and the Bay and the Bourbon Crested, among Starlings, and
    Grand Cayman Thrushes and Cozumel Thrashers and Black-Lored Waxbills and Slender-Billed
    Grackles and Bachman''s Warblers and Semper''s Warblers and Tawny-Headed Mountain
    Finches and Bonin Grosbeaks and both Lesser and Greater Koa Finches and Kakawahies
    and Black Mamos and Hooded Seedeaters and Arabian Ostriches and Bering Cackling
    Geese, so many dead birds, so many bird bones, piled high and white, it is a wonder
    I could name so many, without the aid of my bird binder. Therein lies the beauty,
    the dazzling beauty, of actually existing ornithology.'
