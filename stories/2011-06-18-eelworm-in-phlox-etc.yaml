  text: 'The way to deal with eelworm in phlox is to spray with Murphos, a paraltrion
    curb. The way to avoid being slighted by bus drivers, waiters and salesgirls is
    to be unselfish, self-confident, thoughtful, enthusiastic and happy. The way to
    stop a long-winded speaker is for the chairman to rise, thank him for his splendid
    contribution, and lead the audience in thunderous applause. The way to resist
    a male seducer is for the lady to sit in an armless straight chair and pop a piece
    of salt-water taffy into her mouth every time he is about to kiss her... The way
    to keep matches dry in a row-boat is to put them in a fruit jar whose lid has
    been fastened to the underside of the seat; to get at them, unscrew the jar from
    the lid. The way to hem a circular flounce on a slipcover is too complicated to
    go into here. The way to make a "Stradivarius" violin is to do what it tells you
    to do in You Can Make A "Stradivarius" Violin, a publication of Popular Mechanics
    Press. The way to raise the Devil is as follows: draw a circle with consecrated
    coal and chalk and write around it, "I forbid you, Lucifer, on the name of the
    Blessed Trinity, to enter this circle"; then take a stand inside the circle and
    recite: "I conjure thee, Lucifer, by the ineffable names ON, ALPHA, YA, REY, SOL,
    MESSIAS, INGODUM that thou comest to do, without harming me" [you then tell him
    what you want]. Nota bene: this works only on Mondays; on Tuesdays, for instance,
    Lucifer must be addressed as "NAMBROTH", on Saturdays as "NABAM" (Note to printer
    : no typos please, matter of life and death) and on Sundays he will answer only
    to "AQUIEL" and will ask for a hair of your head which on no account should be
    given him--he can be fooled with a hair from a fox.

    The above useful information is a dipperful from the great American reservoir
    of know-how...

    The R R Bowker Company publishes How-To-Do-It Books : A Selected Guide, two hundred
    pages of descriptive bibliography compiled by Robert E Kingery... Mr Kingery has
    cut a few paths through the jungle of howtoism, culling out a mere 3,500 titles,
    which he has arranged under nine hundred heads, from Abacus to Yoghurt, but traversing
    even these well-blazed trails is fatiguing. Alcoholics, Allergy, and Alligators;
    Candle-Making and Candy-Making; Chiggers and Children; Diving Boards and Divorce;
    Embroidery, Emotions, Enamelling, Encyclopaedias, Entertaining, and Etching; Mental
    Illness cheek by jowl with Metalwork; Money (Counterfeiting) cozying up to Money-Making
    Ideas; Survival (Atomic Bombs) modulating into Swans. There are books on how to
    succeed as a motel operator, a woman, a baby sitter, a committee member, a guest,
    a parent, a child, a lover, a Chevrolet owner, and a baton twirler, (The Baton:
    Twirling Made Easy!) There are howtos on encouraging bees and earthworms (Thomas
    J Barrett''s Harnessing The Earthworm) and on discouraging ants, budbugs, cockroaches,
    moths, silverfish, and termites. There are howtos on pigeons and pigs and poker;
    on poultry, pregnancy, printing, and poison ivy; on sleuthing and sleeping (How
    To Sleep Successfully); on standing (Your Carriage Madam!, by Janet Lane) and
    sitting (Sitting Pretty by, needless to say, the same author); on rabbits, rheumatism,
    riddles, rifles, and rugs; on lace and lizards, lacrosse, and lampshades; on wood
    carving, meat carving, soap carving, and ice carving; on how to make mobiles,
    be a widow (three titles, including Donald I Rogers'' Teach Your Wife To Be A
    Widow), and get tall (Paul O''Neill''s Why Be Short?); on how to collect books,
    bottles, buttons, and butterflies; on how to buy things and even one book on how
    to throw things away--Morgan Towne''s Treasures In Truck & Trash, which tells
    "how to pick out the treasures from the junk in the cellar and attic, how much
    they are worth, and where to sell them" and which is by no means the only entry
    in Mr Kingery''s 3,500 that sounds as though it might really be quite useful in
    dealing with one of the many special problems that bother people in this intricate
    age. After all, it is not the fault of the howto author that modern life gets
    more and more complicated, calling on him to settle problems that are more and
    more arcane. One sometimes wonders, however, whether a feedback is not at work
    here and whether a number of these problems would perhaps never have arisen to
    bother us if books had not been written telling us how to solve them.
