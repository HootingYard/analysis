  text: "The way to deal with eelworm in phlox is to spray with Murphos, a paraltrion\
    \ curb. The way to avoid being slighted by bus drivers, waiters and salesgirls\
    \ is to be unselfish, self-confident, thoughtful, enthusiastic and happy. The\
    \ way to stop a long-winded speaker is for the chairman to rise, thank him for\
    \ his splendid contribution, and lead the audience in thunderous applause. The\
    \ way to resist a male seducer is for the lady to sit in an armless straight chair\
    \ and pop a piece of salt-water taffy into her mouth every time he is about to\
    \ kiss her\u2026 The way to keep matches dry in a row-boat is to put them in a\
    \ fruit jar whose lid has been fastened to the underside of the seat; to get at\
    \ them, unscrew the jar from the lid. The way to hem a circular flounce on a slipcover\
    \ is too complicated to go into here. The way to make a \u201CStradivarius\u201D\
    \ violin is to do what it tells you to do in You Can Make A \u201CStradivarius\u201D\
    \ Violin, a publication of Popular Mechanics Press. The way to raise the Devil\
    \ is as follows: draw a circle with consecrated coal and chalk and write around\
    \ it, \u201CI forbid you, Lucifer, on the name of the Blessed Trinity, to enter\
    \ this circle\u201D; then take a stand inside the circle and recite: \u201CI conjure\
    \ thee, Lucifer, by the ineffable names ON, ALPHA, YA, REY, SOL, MESSIAS, INGODUM\
    \ that thou comest to do, without harming me\u201D [you then tell him what you\
    \ want]. Nota bene: this works only on Mondays; on Tuesdays, for instance, Lucifer\
    \ must be addressed as \u201CNAMBROTH\u201D, on Saturdays as \u201CNABAM\u201D\
    \ (Note to printer\_: no typos please, matter of life and death) and on Sundays\
    \ he will answer only to \u201CAQUIEL\u201D and will ask for a hair of your head\
    \ which on no account should be given him\u2014he can be fooled with a hair from\
    \ a fox.\nThe above useful information is a dipperful from the great American\
    \ reservoir of know-how\u2026\nThe R R Bowker Company publishes How-To-Do-It Books\_\
    : A Selected Guide, two hundred pages of descriptive bibliography compiled by\
    \ Robert E Kingery\u2026 Mr Kingery has cut a few paths through the jungle of\
    \ howtoism, culling out a mere 3,500 titles, which he has arranged under nine\
    \ hundred heads, from Abacus to Yoghurt, but traversing even these well-blazed\
    \ trails is fatiguing. Alcoholics, Allergy, and Alligators; Candle-Making and\
    \ Candy-Making; Chiggers and Children; Diving Boards and Divorce; Embroidery,\
    \ Emotions, Enamelling, Encyclopaedias, Entertaining, and Etching; Mental Illness\
    \ cheek by jowl with Metalwork; Money (Counterfeiting) cozying up to Money-Making\
    \ Ideas; Survival (Atomic Bombs) modulating into Swans. There are books on how\
    \ to succeed as a motel operator, a woman, a baby sitter, a committee member,\
    \ a guest, a parent, a child, a lover, a Chevrolet owner, and a baton twirler,\
    \ (The Baton: Twirling Made Easy!) There are howtos on encouraging bees and earthworms\
    \ (Thomas J Barrett's Harnessing The Earthworm) and on discouraging ants, budbugs,\
    \ cockroaches, moths, silverfish, and termites. There are howtos on pigeons and\
    \ pigs and poker; on poultry, pregnancy, printing, and poison ivy; on sleuthing\
    \ and sleeping (How To Sleep Successfully); on standing (Your Carriage Madam!,\
    \ by Janet Lane) and sitting (Sitting Pretty by, needless to say, the same author);\
    \ on rabbits, rheumatism, riddles, rifles, and rugs; on lace and lizards, lacrosse,\
    \ and lampshades; on wood carving, meat carving, soap carving, and ice carving;\
    \ on how to make mobiles, be a widow (three titles, including Donald I Rogers\u2019\
    \ Teach Your Wife To Be A Widow), and get tall (Paul O'Neill's Why Be Short?);\
    \ on how to collect books, bottles, buttons, and butterflies; on how to buy things\
    \ and even one book on how to throw things away\u2014Morgan Towne's Treasures\
    \ In Truck & Trash, which tells \u201Chow to pick out the treasures from the junk\
    \ in the cellar and attic, how much they are worth, and where to sell them\u201D\
    \ and which is by no means the only entry in Mr Kingery's 3,500 that sounds as\
    \ though it might really be quite useful in dealing with one of the many special\
    \ problems that bother people in this intricate age. After all, it is not the\
    \ fault of the howto author that modern life gets more and more complicated, calling\
    \ on him to settle problems that are more and more arcane. One sometimes wonders,\
    \ however, whether a feedback is not at work here and whether a number of these\
    \ problems would perhaps never have arisen to bother us if books had not been\
    \ written telling us how to solve them.\nDwight Macdonald, \u201CHowtoism\u201D\
