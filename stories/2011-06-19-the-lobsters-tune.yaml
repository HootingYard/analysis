  text: 'In Act III, Scene III of Death''s Jest-Book, or The Fool''s Tragedy by Thomas
    Lovell Beddoes (1829), Isbrand asks an important question:

    What is the lobster''s tune when he is boiled?

    Alas, he does not answer it, but goes on to sing a song about an unborn ghost,
    a Nile crocodile, and a "little, gruntless, fairy hog". This is all very well,
    but I still want to know about the lobster''s tune. Can any reader point me in
    the right direction? Are there any contemporary cover versions?'
