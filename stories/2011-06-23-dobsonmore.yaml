  text: 'Frank Key today answered mounting speculation about the nature of his new
    project and announced Dobsonmore, a unique and free-to-use website which builds
    an exciting online experience around the reading of his hugely successful Dobson
    piffle, and is partnered by Blodgett Global Domination Enterprises GmbH.

    The announcement today was heralded by the revealing of the website''s name via
    an online search for its letters, and a ''coming soon'' holding page which received
    over 36 visits within a million hours of launching.

    For this groundbreaking collaborative project, Frank Key has written extensive
    new material about Dobson, his pamphlets, and his boots, which will inform, inspire
    and entertain readers as they journey through the storylines of the piffle. Dobsonmore
    will later incorporate an online shop where people can purchase exclusively the
    long-awaited Dobson ePamphlets (out of e-print), in partnership with Frank Key''s
    publishers worldwide, and is ultimately intended to become an online reading experience,
    extending the relevance of Dobson to new generations of readers, while still appealing
    to existing fans. As the Dobsonmore Shop develops, it is intended that it should
    include further products designed specifically for Dobson fans, offering a potential
    outlet for Blodgett Global Domination Enterprises GmbH products and services related
    to Dobsonmore. In keeping with Dobson''s international appeal, the site will launch
    in English, Afrikaans, Ugric, Ket, Generic BBC Drama Peasant, and Glosa, with
    more languages to follow.

    In the new website, the storyline will be brought to life with sumptuous newly-commissioned
    illustrations and interactive ''Moments'' through which you can navigate, starting
    with the first appearance of Dobson bent over his escritoire, scribbling. On entering,
    you choose a foolish username and begin your experience. As you move through the
    chapters, you can read and share exclusive writing from Frank Key, and, just as
    Dobson barges through the door of his dilapidated hovel, so can you. You visit
    Pointy Town, get sorted into a chalet, write pamphlets and chuck pebbles at swans...

    That''s quite enough of a rewritten press release to be going on with.'
