    This week in The Dabbler I pose a tricky problem one might encounter in the game
    of Spite, or Lantern Jaw as it is known in some circles. Amateurs ought not to
    be intimidated by the seemingly "expert" solutions posited in the Comments, all
    of which so far--to my eye, at least--have the fatal flaw of mistaking Spite for
    a card game. A simple enough error, I suppose, considering that the symbols


    are employed, but any truly experienced Spiteologist will know that these denote
    something wholly different from the hearts and clubs and diamonds and spades of
    the standard card game, so different indeed that to gain a full understanding
    one needs to have one''s brain artificially modified by the Blotzmann Procedure,
    from whence there is no turning back. It is true that everyday life can become
    somewhat problematic after the modification, but the benefits to one''s Spite
    skills are immense and glorious and majestic, so only a pipsqueak would dare to
    complain or, ruinously, to pursue Blotzmann through the courts.'
