    Considerable sensation has been evoked in the towns of Topsham, Lympstone, Exmouth,
    Teignmouth, and Dawlish, in the south of Devon, in consequence of the discovery
    of a vast number of foot-tracks of a most strange and mysterious description.
    The superstitious go so far as to believe they are the marks of Satan himself;
    and that great excitement has been produced among all classes may be judged from
    the fact that the subject has been descanted on from the pulpit.

    It appears that on Thursday night last there was a very heavy fall of snow in
    the neighbourhood of Exeter and the south of Devon. On the following morning,
    the inhabitants of the above towns were surprised at discovering the tracks of
    some strange and mysterious animal, endowed with the power of ubiquity, as the
    foot-prints were to be seen in all kinds of inaccessible places--on the tops of
    houses and narrow walls, in gardens and courtyards enclosed by high walls and
    palings, as well as in open fields. There was hardly a garden in Lympstone where
    the foot-prints were not observed.

    The track appeared more like that of a biped than a quadruped, and the steps were
    generally eight inches in advance of each other. The impressions of the feet closely
    resembled that of a donkey''s shoe, and measured from an inch and a half to (in
    some instances) two and a half inches across. Here and there it appeared as if
    cloven, but in the generality of the steps the shoe was continuous, and, from
    the snow in the centre remaining entire, merely showing the outer crest of the
    foot, it must have been convex*.

    The creature seems to have approached the doors of several houses and then to
    have retreated, but no one has been able to discover the standing or resting point
    of this mysterious visitor. On Sunday last the Rev. Mr. Musgrave alluded to the
    subject in his sermon, and suggested the possibility of the foot-prints being
    those of a kangaroo; but this could scarcely have been the case, as they were
    found on both sides of the estuary of the Exe.

    At present it remains a mystery, and many superstitious people in the above towns
    are actually afraid to go outside their doors after night.
