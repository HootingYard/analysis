  text: 'A further snippet from Sober Truth : A Collection Of Nineteenth-Century Episodes,
    Fantastic, Grotesque And Mysterious compiled and edited by Margaret Barton and
    Osbert Sitwell (1930) reveals that the hunt for Jack the Ripper was a scene from
    Edward Gorey:

    Whitechapel bristled with policemen, whose work was rendered infinitely more difficult
    by the swarms of amateur detectives from the West End. Medical students and newspaper
    reporters paraded the streets unconvincingly disguised as women, and in every
    corner there lurked assassin-hunters in tennis shoes or galoshes.'
