  text: 'I have never been worried with the wish or ambition to be a head hunter in
    the Dyak sense, but on this one occasion I did wish that it had been possible,
    without violating any law, or doing anything to a fellow-creature which I should
    not like done to myself, to have obtained possession of this man''s head, with
    its set of unique and terrible teeth...

    When I coveted possession of that head it was not because I thought that it might
    lead to any fresh discovery. A lower motive inspired the feeling. I wished for
    it only that I might bring it over the sea, to drop it like a new apple of discord...
    inscribed, of course, "to the most learned", but giving no locality and no particulars.
