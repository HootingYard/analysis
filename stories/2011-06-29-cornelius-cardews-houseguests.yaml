  text: 'After a break, I have returned to John Tilbury''s mammoth biography of Cornelius
    Cardew. It is 1966; Cardew is swanning about in Buffalo, New York while back in
    London his wife Stella struggles with four children and virtually no money in
    their top-floor flat off Warwick Road. She writes a stream of letters to Cardew
    complaining bitterly about the couple who have come to stay at the flat. They
    add to both her childcare responsibilities, leaving her to act as nursemaid to
    their pneumonia-wracked child while they go off gallivanting to swish parties,
    and to her financial problems, in that they never contribute a penny towards the
    housekeeping--this in spite (or more likely because) of what Stella describes
    as their exaggerated and unseemly preoccupation with money. She is desperate to
    get rid of them, but all her efforts fail until eventually Cardew writes a letter
    ordering them to leave.

    And the names of these charming guests? The man is Tony Cox, and the woman is
    his then wife, a Japanese artist called Yoko Ono.'
