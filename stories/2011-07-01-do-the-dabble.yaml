  text: "\nIn The Dabbler this week, I reproduce part of an instruction manual from\
    \ the Frank Key Academy of Terpsichorean \xC9lan. I am afraid to say that a pre-publication\
    \ reader for The Dabbler, employed to vet all contributions, contacted me a few\
    \ days ago and had the gall to call into question my qualifications for running\
    \ such an academy.\nDear Mr Key, he wrote, on laughably self-important \u201C\
    Dabbler Pre-Publication Vetting Protocol\u201D headed notepaper, Much as we admire\
    \ your pratings, we must strain every sinew to protect our readers from charlatanry,\
    \ poppycock, and flapdoodle. If, for example, we were to run a piece on the Black\
    \ Bat of Harrenhal, we would entrust the commission to a writer fully conversant\
    \ with the career of Ser Oswell Whent, not to some booby. These are important\
    \ and serious matters, after all. That being so, I cannot help wondering why in\
    \ the name of all that is holy you presume to lecture our readers on the art of\
    \ dance, when it is blindingly obvious that you could not dance your way out of\
    \ a paper bag. Yes, Mr Key! Before I took up my current post with The Dabbler\
    \ I was an official observer at the Pointy Town Paper Bag Danceathon, and well\
    \ do I recall the pitiful figure you cut, for six or seven hours, as you failed\
    \ to make your escape from the paper bag by dint of the twist, the hoo-cha, the\
    \ Watusi, and the peasants\u2019 reel, turn and turn about. I am afraid that wild\
    \ horses would not drag me into the unconscionable position of passing your piece\
    \ for publication.\nAs it happens, that last sentence was an idle boast. Upon\
    \ receipt of this pompous cant, I hi-ho'ed over to Dabbler HQ with a harras of\
    \ wild horses in tow. Wild? They were savage, almost demonic. We soon got the\
    \ matter settled, and I doubt I shall be hearing from that little twerp in future."
