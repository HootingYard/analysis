  text: 'Here is the score of Cornelius Cardew''s 1971 piece 10,000 Nails In The Coffin
    Of Imperialism. (Click on the image for a slightly larger view.) Note particularly
    that "yeah!" at the end.


    Cardew submitted the piece for publication in the magazine Aspen, but it was rejected
    by the editor, American composer Tom Johnson, for being "just too out of keeping
    with the issue as a whole". How different the world might be, forty years later,
    if the piece had been published! All over the world, proletarians would have pored
    over the latest issue of Aspen in their millions, seized on the revolutionary
    implications of Cardew''s score, and begun the inevitable historical process of
    driving those ten thousand nails into the coffin of imperialism, thus ushering
    in a bright new Maoist Utopia of political re-education camps and mass famine,
    where "workers would machine-gun bosses into bloody pits", in the words of a poem
    in praise of Cardew''s political mentor Hardial Bains. Er... yeah!'
