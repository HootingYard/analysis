  text: 'I have received a bat-letter from Miss Dimity Cashew.

    Dear Mr Key, she writes, Like most people, I have always believed that the hideous
    bat god Fatso is the most terrifying of all bat deities. This has been an article
    of faith for as long as I can remember. However, I recently stumbled upon Wayne
    Ferrebee''s blog Ferrebeekeeper, where I discovered some rather alarming details
    about Camazotz, the Death Bat. Now, while I am no expert on bat deities and their
    varying levels of hideousness, violence, and terror, it seems to me that Camazotz
    would prove a formidable opponent were he and the hideous bat god Fatso pitted
    against each other in some kind of apocalyptic clash of bat deities. Your views
    on the likely outcome of such a battle would be much appreciated, also of course
    the betting odds, in case I fancied taking a flutter.

    Yours primly, Dimity Cashew (Miss)

    PS--I enclose a snapshot of Camazotz from Mr Ferrebee''s blog, so you can appreciate
    just how terrifying he is. The bat god I mean, not Mr Ferrebee, obviously.

    Rather than bashing out an impromptu reply, I think I shall need to embark upon
    some serious bat god research before jumping to any conclusions. Watch this space.
