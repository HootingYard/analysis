  text: "Last year, I drew to your attention Brit's capsule history of Britain, 1939\u2013\
    2010, in seventy-seven words. Now another indefatigable blogger, the esteemed\
    \ Wartime Housewife, has managed to sum up the history of England in just seven\
    \ words:\nEngland wasn't built on glamour and competence.\nIf tinies were still\
    \ taught anything approaching history in their Self-Esteem Workshop Community\
    \ Hubs, that would make a perfect essay title. Discuss."
