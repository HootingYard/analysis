    Critically important advice, in my cupboard at The Dabbler, on correct apprehension
    of the dimensions of sea beasties. I claim no credit, as the piece is basically
    a paraphrase of Pebblehead, from one of his innumerable bestselling paperbacks.

    Over the years, many readers have written to ask if there is any truth in the
    rumour that, long before Frost/Nixon, there was a project entitled Frost/Pebblehead,
    or even Pebblehead/Nixon, which had to be abandoned due to pelf and priggishness
    and panic and other things beginning with P. Many readers have asked, and none
    has been answered, for I chuck all such enquiries into a waste chute, down which
    they fall, rolling and tumbling, until they reach the fires of hell, where they
    burn to a crisp. Some things are better left uninvestigated, unresearched, unsaid.'
