  text: 'As witness the performer who, for many years now, has been exhibiting in
    the streets of London, the tools of his craft being a bag of large-sized raw potatoes.
    The man is beyond middle age, and his head is bald, or nearly so; and all over
    his cranium, from the forehead to the base of his skull, are bumps unknown to
    the phrenologist. There are blue bumps, and bumps of a faded greenish hue, and
    bumps red and inflamed, and his bald sconce looks as though it had been out in
    a rain of spent bullets. It is not so, however; it has only been exposed to a
    downpour of raw potatoes.
