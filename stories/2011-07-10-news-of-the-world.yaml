  text: "With the demise of a vile diet of moral squalor and pap their favourite newspaper\
    \ which they bought in their millions, no doubt the British working class are\
    \ at last ready to heed Cornelius Cardew's stirring call-to-arms from 1979...\n\
    All together now...\nBritish ruling class puffed up with arrogance\n    Boasted\
    \ that the sun shone on your vast empire\n    That sun has now eclipsed.\n   \
    \ British ruling class, we have got news for you.\n    Your time has run out;\
    \ You have got to go.\nLight is shining in the sky\n    Heralding the dawn of\
    \ a glorious new day,\n    British working class you're the revolutionary force.\n\
    \    To build our socialist land.\nBritish working class you have a fine history\n\
    \    Fierce battles waged against a vicious enemy\n    With grim determination.\n\
    \    British working class aspires to revolution\n    In the face of attempt to\
    \ crush this aspiration.\n    Of socialism in Britain\nChorus\nIn the 1840s Marx\
    \ and Engels on our shores\n    Organised and hammered out the objective laws\
    \ propelling history\n    Marxist-Leninist science is the guiding star\n    Charting\
    \ the course of the working class:\n    Socialist revolution.\nChorus\nPersisting\
    \ in the face of every difficulty\n    In 1979 was formed our new party, a glorious\
    \ victory.\n    Rallying to this flag is the only way, workers\n    To usher in,\
    \ a bright new day of\n    Socialism in Britain."
