  text: 'It was an overcast morning in July. Pansy Cradledew was up and about at an
    ungodly hour. Some time later, her inamorato woke up, and, glugging his morning
    coffee, asked:

    "So what have you been up to so early in the day, my sweet, my darling dear?"

    "Oh, I pulled the head off a bat," replied Pansy.

    Her inamorato spluttered a mouthful of coffee and almost choked, until it became
    clear that the bat in question was not some flesh and blood and sinew pipistrelle,
    but a model bat made from terracotta-coloured modelling clay. Pansy, it transpired,
    had fashioned a figurine of the hideous bat god Fatso, his "look" based on the
    equally hideous bat god Camazotz, and the removal of the head was a temporary
    measure to expedite the drying and setting process. Nonetheless, her crack o''
    dawn activity led to the conversational exchange reported, causing much merriment
    and the splitting of sides.'
