  text: "It was an overcast morning in July. Pansy Cradledew was up and about at an\
    \ ungodly hour. Some time later, her inamorato woke up, and, glugging his morning\
    \ coffee, asked:\n\u201CSo what have you been up to so early in the day, my sweet,\
    \ my darling dear?\u201D\n\u201COh, I pulled the head off a bat,\u201D replied\
    \ Pansy.\nHer inamorato spluttered a mouthful of coffee and almost choked, until\
    \ it became clear that the bat in question was not some flesh and blood and sinew\
    \ pipistrelle, but a model bat made from terracotta-coloured modelling clay. Pansy,\
    \ it transpired, had fashioned a figurine of the hideous bat god Fatso, his \u201C\
    look\u201D based on the equally hideous bat god Camazotz, and the removal of the\
    \ head was a temporary measure to expedite the drying and setting process. Nonetheless,\
    \ her crack o\u2019 dawn activity led to the conversational exchange reported,\
    \ causing much merriment and the splitting of sides."
