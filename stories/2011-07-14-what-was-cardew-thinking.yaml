  text: "John Tilbury, in his biography Cornelius Cardew\_: \_A Life Unfinished (2008)\
    \ on some of the later songs, when our hero had become a member of the Central\
    \ Committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party Of Britain (Marxist-Leninist):\n\
    Invariably, the songs are extended by virtue of repetition ; in \u201CRevisionist\
    \ Somersaults And The Opportunist Opposition\u201D the brevity and uneventfulness\
    \ of the melody is a blessing, except that there are ten verses; the crude lyric\
    \ is provided with music which is appropriately routine\u2026 How can this be\
    \ explained\u2014by which I mean, what was Cardew thinking at the time? I quote\
    \ just the first verse:\nOne jumps out and one jumps in saying\nCPC(ML) agent\
    \ of the bourgeoisie\nThe Moscow \u2018communists\u2019 really love this country\n\
    And say that CPC(ML) is against democracy\nWith one foot in and the other also\n\
    The revisionists and opportunists defend the status quo\n\u201CAn Opportunist\
    \ Has Come Back Home\u201D is an endless, turgid, sectarian tract attacking a\
    \ \u2018revisionist\u2019 who has betrayed the Party. The text is spoken and sung;\
    \ the music is interspersed with, and accompanies, speech alternating with a sung\
    \ chorus\u2026 the whole text [is] of extraordinary length, doubtless uncut and\
    \ unabridged. Here, towards the beginning, Voice 1 describes the young man:\n\
    Oh beautiful sight! What a striking pose!\nOh look at his Russian greatcoat,\n\
    The Mao badge on his lapel,\nHis Castroite fatigues,\nAnd this is not all! Oh\
    \ yes!\n(Voice II)\nAn opportunist has come back home\nFor me, the wonderful thing\
    \ about these songs is that they are sung in an impeccably upper middle class\
    \ accent, and have a jauntiness redolent of the Bloomsbury set on a picnic outing.\
    \ Not so much jolly hockey sticks as jolly petrol bombs. (I'm also intrigued by\
    \ the way the ideological imperative of the lyrics means that they rarely scan\
    \ comfortably. Well, you try packing\_\u201Cour ideology is Marxism-Leninism,\
    \ we're workers and like workers everywhere our aspiration is for socialism ushered\
    \ in by violent revolution\u201D or \u201Cin utter chaos the old order spews out\
    \ unlimited decadence and parasitism\u201D into a singable song.)"
