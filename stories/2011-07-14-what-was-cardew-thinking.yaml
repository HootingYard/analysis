  text: 'John Tilbury, in his biography Cornelius Cardew :  A Life Unfinished (2008)
    on some of the later songs, when our hero had become a member of the Central Committee
    of the Revolutionary Communist Party Of Britain (Marxist-Leninist):

    Invariably, the songs are extended by virtue of repetition ; in "Revisionist Somersaults
    And The Opportunist Opposition" the brevity and uneventfulness of the melody is
    a blessing, except that there are ten verses; the crude lyric is provided with
    music which is appropriately routine... How can this be explained--by which I
    mean, what was Cardew thinking at the time? I quote just the first verse:

    One jumps out and one jumps in saying

    CPC(ML) agent of the bourgeoisie

    The Moscow ''communists'' really love this country

    And say that CPC(ML) is against democracy

    With one foot in and the other also

    The revisionists and opportunists defend the status quo

    "An Opportunist Has Come Back Home" is an endless, turgid, sectarian tract attacking
    a ''revisionist'' who has betrayed the Party. The text is spoken and sung; the
    music is interspersed with, and accompanies, speech alternating with a sung chorus...
    the whole text [is] of extraordinary length, doubtless uncut and unabridged. Here,
    towards the beginning, Voice 1 describes the young man:

    Oh beautiful sight! What a striking pose!

    Oh look at his Russian greatcoat,

    The Mao badge on his lapel,

    His Castroite fatigues,

    And this is not all! Oh yes!

    (Voice II)

    An opportunist has come back home

    For me, the wonderful thing about these songs is that they are sung in an impeccably
    upper middle class accent, and have a jauntiness redolent of the Bloomsbury set
    on a picnic outing. Not so much jolly hockey sticks as jolly petrol bombs. (I''m
    also intrigued by the way the ideological imperative of the lyrics means that
    they rarely scan comfortably. Well, you try packing "our ideology is Marxism-Leninism,
    we''re workers and like workers everywhere our aspiration is for socialism ushered
    in by violent revolution" or "in utter chaos the old order spews out unlimited
    decadence and parasitism" into a singable song.)'
