  text: 'I snap my fingers and, foof-la!, inaugurate the Hooting Yard Friday Quiz.
    (It is likely, not to say inevitable, that tomorrow I shall snap my fingers again
    and, foof-la!, abolish the Hooting Yard Friday Quiz, so make the most of it while
    you have the chance.)

    This week''s challenge is to identify correctly the forty-seven fictional characters
    listed yesterday in the piece Unhinged By Cream Crackers. You need to provide
    the title of the work, be it a novel or a play or a film or what have you, where
    the character first appeared.

    The first person to post a full and correct list in the Comments will win a modest
    prize. I do not yet know what it will be, but I will think of something, and it
    will not be a world cruise aboard the HMS Corrugated Cardboard.'
