  text: 'On May 13 1988 I was amused to read a report in The Daily Telegraph that
    the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds had erected a mesh fence to keep
    bird-fanciers away from a colony of little terns on Great Yarmouth beach, whose
    numbers had grown from 20 pairs to 70 pairs in three years.

    On August 2 1990 I was interested to read a report in The Daily Telegraph as follows:

    "Britain''s biggest breeding colony of little terns, on Great Yarmouth Beach,
    Norfolk, where 201 pairs were nesting, has been largely wiped out by two hedgehogs
    and a kestrel."

    Kestrels, of course, are fanatically protected by all the high-tech and paramilitary
    resources of the multi-million pound RSPB, which on this occasion seems to have
    been hoist with its own petard, as they say. It is hard to know with whom we should
    sympathise most in this tale: the ordinary bird-fanciers, who were kept away from
    fancying little terns by a mesh fence put up by the superior bird-fanciers of
    the RSPB bureaucracy, or the unfortunate little terns, condemned to twitter away
    unseen.

    My own sympathies are with the hedgehogs. They are delightful, if slightly flea-ridden,
    animals, with whom it is sometimes possible to hold an intelligent conversation.
    Has anybody ever had an intelligent conversation with a little tern? Hedgehogs
    do not demand a whole apparatus of repression to survive. Every time a hedgehog
    wipes out a little tern, it is a blow for freedom.
