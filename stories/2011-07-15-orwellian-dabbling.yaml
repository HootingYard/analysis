  text: "\nDevoted Hooting Yardists will be familiar with the contents of Key's Cupboard\
    \ this week, where I bring to the attention of Dabbler readers the egg-counting\
    \ antics of George Orwell. I often reflect\u2014and by \u201Coften\u201D I mean\
    \ daily, daily\u2014on the fact that two titanic figures in the cultural landscape\
    \ of the twentieth century had such wildly divergent attitudes to eggs. There\
    \ is Orwell, thin and wiry, with his love of eggs, and Alfred Hitchcock, plump\
    \ and bloated, who was terrified of them.\nIt could be argued that Orwell was\
    \ not an egg lover as such, that he merely had a mania for counting them, a mania\
    \ that could have found expression in the counting of other farm (or smallholding)\
    \ produce. Frankly I cannot be bothered to do the biographical research which\
    \ would be necessary to write a monograph entitled George Orwell's Attitude Towards\
    \ Eggs. Perhaps someone else could take on that important task."
