  text: "It may come as a relief to some readers to learn that I am done with Cornelius\
    \ Cardew for the time being. I am now turning my attention to Percy Grainger.\
    \ Thanks to Strange Flowers, we have already learned how to speak like the madcap\
    \ Antipodean, and when I start reading the biography I have borrowed from the\
    \ library I shall regale you with interesting snippets. For now, let us consider\
    \ the title he gave to a pen-portrait of his mother:\n\u201CMother's Wilfulness,\
    \ Recklessness, Fearlessness, Bossiness, Violence If Opposed, Tendency To Burn\
    \ Food When Cooking, Vehemence\u201D\n\nPercy and his Ma"
