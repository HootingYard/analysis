  text: 'It may come as a relief to some readers to learn that I am done with Cornelius
    Cardew for the time being. I am now turning my attention to Percy Grainger. Thanks

    to a pen-portrait of his mother:

    "Mother''s Wilfulness, Recklessness, Fearlessness, Bossiness, Violence If Opposed,
    Tendency To Burn Food When Cooking, Vehemence"
