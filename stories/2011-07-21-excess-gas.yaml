  text: 'Hooting Yard reader Richard Carter has a letter published in the latest edition
    of the London Review Of Books. I take the liberty of reproducing it here for your
    edification and instruction. Our resident anagrammatist R. (who is not Richard,
    by the way) should find it of particular interest:

    Steven Shapin writes that Darwin''s uncontrollable retching and farting seriously
    limited his public life (LRB, 30 June). Some years ago, to my delight, I worked
    out that the great man''s full name, Charles Robert Darwin, is an anagram of ''rectal
    winds abhorrer''. Unfortunately for my anagram, the meanings of words, like species,
    can evolve. On the rare occasions that Darwin mentioned his problems to friends,
    he always used the word ''flatulence''. Nowadays, we think of flatulence as being
    synonymous with farting, but in Darwin''s day it meant (as it technically still
    does) an accumulation of gases in the alimentary canal. While I''m sure that Darwin
    must have vented his excess gas one way or the other, there''s no reason to believe
    that his farts were uncontrollable.'
