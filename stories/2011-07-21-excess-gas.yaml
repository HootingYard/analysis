  text: "Hooting Yard reader Richard Carter has a letter published in the latest edition\
    \ of the\_London Review Of Books. I take the liberty of reproducing it here for\
    \ your edification and instruction. Our resident anagrammatist R. (who is not\
    \ Richard, by the way) should find it of particular interest:\nSteven Shapin writes\
    \ that Darwin's uncontrollable retching and farting seriously limited his public\
    \ life (LRB, 30 June). Some years ago, to my delight, I worked out that the great\
    \ man's full name, Charles Robert Darwin, is an anagram of \u2018rectal winds\
    \ abhorrer\u2019. Unfortunately for my anagram, the meanings of words, like species,\
    \ can evolve. On the rare occasions that Darwin mentioned his problems to friends,\
    \ he always used the word \u2018flatulence\u2019. Nowadays, we think of flatulence\
    \ as being synonymous with farting, but in Darwin's day it meant (as it technically\
    \ still does) an accumulation of gases in the alimentary canal. While I'm sure\
    \ that Darwin must have vented his excess gas one way or the other, there's no\
    \ reason to believe that his farts were uncontrollable."
