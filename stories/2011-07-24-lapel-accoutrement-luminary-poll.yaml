  text: 'Here at Haemoglobin Towers there is much whirring and clanking as the finishing
    touches are put to your favourite book of the year, the annual Hooting Yard paperback.
    The publication of this mighty tome is imminent, imminent I tell you!

    Meanwhile, never resting on our laurels, and determined always to extend our global
    reach, possibly into extraterrestrial zones, the thought occurred to present one
    of the new and gorgeous Hooting Yard lapel accoutrements to a living luminary.
    This lucky luminary could then act as our ambassador when hobnobbing with the
    great and good and with that Fry person. But upon which luminary should we bestow
    this signal honour? Readers, you decide!
