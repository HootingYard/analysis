  text: 'It has become common in recent years for the annual Hooting Yard paperback
    to be published in late autumn. This year, however, Mr Key has decided to tap
    the summer reading market. Now you can sprawl on the beach at a dilapidated and
    unseemly seaside resort clutching this fantastic new anthology to your heaving
    bosom!


    Porpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke contains 250 pages of majestic sweeping paragraphs,
    together with discussion notes for your Book Group and a photograph of the Parp-O-Phone!
    It even has wider margins than earlier books, so you won''t need to crack the
    spine to sup your fill of what one critic (Snigsby) called "Mr Key''s delicious
    prose nectar".

    As ever, these timeless words are ignored by the accountants and airheads of the
    literary establishment, so the only way to get your copy is to hie over to Lulu.
    Do so right away!'
