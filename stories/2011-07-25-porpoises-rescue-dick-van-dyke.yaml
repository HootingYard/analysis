  text: "It has become common in recent years for the annual Hooting Yard paperback\
    \ to be published in late autumn. This year, however, Mr Key has decided to tap\
    \ the summer reading market. Now you can sprawl on the beach at a dilapidated\
    \ and unseemly seaside resort clutching this fantastic new anthology to your heaving\
    \ bosom!\n\nPorpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke contains 250 pages of majestic sweeping\
    \ paragraphs, together with discussion notes for your Book Group and a photograph\
    \ of the Parp-O-Phone! It even has wider margins than earlier books, so you won't\
    \ need to crack the spine to sup your fill of what one critic (Snigsby) called\
    \ \u201CMr Key's delicious prose nectar\u201D.\nAs ever, these timeless words\
    \ are ignored by the accountants and airheads of the literary establishment, so\
    \ the only way to get your copy is to hie over to Lulu. Do so right away!"
