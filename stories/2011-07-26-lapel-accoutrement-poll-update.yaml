  text: 'At time of writing, Krishnan Guru-Murthy has nudged ahead of Yoko Ono in
    our poll to decide on the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting Yard
    lapel accoutrement. Could it be, I wonder, that the email I fired off to him at
    Channel 4 News the other day bore fruit?

    Dear Mr Guru-Murthy

    You are currently in second place (behind Yoko Ono) in a readers'' poll at Hooting
    Yard to choose the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting Yard lapel
    accoutrement. Might I suggest you vote for yourself and encourage others in the
    Channel 4 newsroom to cast their votes in your favour?

    Clearly something is going right, as many of my readers may be under the impression
    you are a fictional character, and they still vote for you!

    Yours sincerely

    Frank Key

    Some readers may be appalled by what they see as a morally reprehensible attempt
    to influence the outcome of the poll. Let me assure these virtuous souls that
    I fully intend to fire off similar letters to De Botton, Huffington, Tempah, and
    Ono. But not Balls, for Christ''s sake, not Balls!'
