  text: "At time of writing, Krishnan Guru-Murthy has nudged ahead of Yoko Ono in\
    \ our poll to decide on the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting\
    \ Yard lapel accoutrement. Could it be, I wonder, that the email I fired off to\
    \ him at Channel 4 News the other day bore fruit?\nDear Mr Guru-Murthy\nYou are\
    \ currently in second place (behind Yoko Ono) in a readers\u2019 poll at Hooting\
    \ Yard to choose the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting Yard lapel\
    \ accoutrement. Might I suggest you vote for yourself and encourage others in\
    \ the Channel 4 newsroom to cast their votes in your favour?\nClearly something\
    \ is going right, as many of my readers may be under the impression you are a\
    \ fictional character, and they still vote for you!\nYours sincerely\nFrank Key\n\
    Some readers may be appalled by what they see as a morally reprehensible attempt\
    \ to influence the outcome of the poll. Let me assure these virtuous souls that\
    \ I fully intend to fire off similar letters to De Botton, Huffington, Tempah,\
    \ and Ono. But not Balls, for Christ's sake, not Balls!"
