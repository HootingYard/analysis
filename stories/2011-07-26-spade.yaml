  text: 'It has been an industrious week at Hooting Yard, what with the publication
    of a brand new paperback and the production of those lovely lapel accoutrements.
    Global domination has never seemed so surely within my grasp. Whatever next?,
    you may ask. Fridge magnets? Monogrammed bomber jackets? Hooting Yard tea-cosies?
    Tee-shirts?

    Mention of tee-shirts is as good a pretext as any to bring to your attention this
    splendid (if unrealised) design by recently-deceased Hooting Yard aficionado Martin
    Clare, recorded by his brother in a funeral tribute.
