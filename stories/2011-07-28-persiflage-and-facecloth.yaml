  text: 'Readers will recall the podcast Airy Persiflage, wherein from time to time
    its onlie begetter, Walter O''Hara, turns his attentions to scribblings by Mr
    Key and the recitation thereof. In his latest outpourings for podpersons, Mr O''Hara
    tackles Ambrose And Signor Ploppo (accompanied by "young Gar") and The Cruel Sea.

    It is perhaps worth giving some background to Mr O''Hara''s choice of the latter
    piece. The other day, he "befriended" me on Facebookcloth. There, I noted that
    he can lay claim to having posted the most sensible status update ever to appear
    on the social networking site, a transcription of The Cruel Sea in its entirety.
    Several of his Facecloth friends wondered what he was wittering on about and made
    various (wrong) guesses before he revealed the sordid truth. At which point I
    stepped in to say how delighted I would be were he to recite the piece on his
    podcast. And lo! it came to pass!

    Complete and (initially) unattributed transcription of Hooting Yard texts as Facecloth
    updates is clearly the way forward. Let us hope it catches on.'
