  text: "Readers will recall the podcast Airy Persiflage, wherein from time to time\
    \ its onlie begetter, Walter O'Hara, turns his attentions to scribblings by Mr\
    \ Key and the recitation thereof. In his latest outpourings for podpersons, Mr\
    \ O'Hara tackles Ambrose And Signor Ploppo (accompanied by \u201Cyoung Gar\u201D\
    ) and The Cruel Sea.\nIt is perhaps worth giving some background to Mr O'Hara's\
    \ choice of the latter piece. The other day, he \u201Cbefriended\u201D me on Facebookcloth.\
    \ There, I noted that he can lay claim to having posted the most sensible status\
    \ update ever to appear on the social networking site, a transcription of The\
    \ Cruel Sea in its entirety. Several of his Facecloth friends wondered what he\
    \ was wittering on about and made various (wrong) guesses before he revealed the\
    \ sordid truth. At which point I stepped in to say how delighted I would be were\
    \ he to recite the piece on his podcast. And lo! it came to pass!\nComplete and\
    \ (initially) unattributed transcription of Hooting Yard texts as Facecloth updates\
    \ is clearly the way forward. Let us hope it catches on."
