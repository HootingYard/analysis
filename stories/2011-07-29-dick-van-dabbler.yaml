  text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I provide a unique insight into my working methods,\
    \ casting a frank and unstinting* gaze upon the creative process involved in the\
    \ writing of the masterpiece that is\_Porpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke.\_\_Mention\
    \ of which reminds me that, several days after publication, there may be one or\
    \ two readers in far-flung corners of the earth who have not yet bought copies.\
    \ You know who you are. Zip thyselves o'er to Lulu and make purchase now, tardy\
    \ ones!\n* NOTE\_: \u201CUnstinting\u201D, in this context, means \u201Cnot involving\
    \ at any stage the participation of a stint\u201D. As any fule kno, a stint is\
    \ a type of bird, specifically a very small wader known in North America as a\
    \ peep. They can be difficult to identify because of the similarity between species,\
    \ and various breeding, non-breeding, juvenile and moulting plumages, but you\
    \ shouldn't let that stop you.\n\n"
