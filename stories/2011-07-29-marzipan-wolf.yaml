  text: "A life-size marzipan wolf makes a splendid teatime treat at gatherings of\
    \ the extended family. For smaller kinship grouplets, it can be portioned up and\
    \ served piecemeal after supper over several days, or even weeks, depending on\
    \ the portion sizes.\nThe first thing to do is to commandeer the kitchen, together\
    \ with any adjacent pantries, larders and icehouses. If you employ skivvies, drive\
    \ them out, with a broom if necessary. They can busy themselves awhile in an outbuilding\
    \ or annexe, or you can just dismiss them, with or without character references.\
    \ Bear in mind, however, that when you have finished making your life-size marzipan\
    \ wolf you will probably want the skivvies back in the kitchen, toiling through\
    \ all the hours God sends, so whatever you decide to do, treat them with kindness,\
    \ or at least what passes for kindness in your bleak forbidding grim authoritarian\
    \ household.\nNext, acquire a large glob of marzipan. It should be at least the\
    \ size, if not the shape, of an average adult wolf. If you are not sure what that\
    \ is, make study of wolves, for example by combing through reference books, preferably\
    \ illustrated, by watching informative documentary films at the local fleapit,\
    \ or by stalking the heaths and moors at dead of night. Remember that in moonlight\
    \ it can be difficult to judge distance, so get as close to any pack of heath\
    \ or moorland wolves as you possibly can. Wear dark clothing and night-vision\
    \ goggles, if they are available in your neck of the woods.\nOnce you are alone\
    \ in your kitchen with a wolf-size glob of marzipan on the countertop, you can\
    \ proceed to mould it into the shape of a wolf. The basic idea is to go for absolute\
    \ verisimilitude, so that the members of your extended family or smaller kinship\
    \ grouplet do a double-take.\n\u201CMy oh my! What on earth is a wolf doing, sitting\
    \ there without a care in the world on an enormous cake-stand in the middle of\
    \ the dining table?\u201D they will exclaim, before blinking a couple of times\
    \ and adding, \u201COh! Silly me! Look, it is all yellow and made out of marzipan!\u201D\
    \nIt can be a very tricky effect to pull off successfully, especially if you are\
    \ cack-handed. Nor should you even begin the project if you are suffering from\
    \ delirium tremens or from any other condition which causes you to shake uncontrollably,\
    \ such as having recently spent five hours atop a vibrating platform or watched\
    \ a terrifying non-documentary film about spooks and ghosties and monsters at\
    \ the local fleapit.\nSteady-handed, then, mould the marzipan accordingly, and\
    \ place it on the aforementioned enormous cake-stand in the middle of your dining\
    \ table. You are now ready to throw open the doors of the dining room and beckon\
    \ your extended family or smaller kinship grouplet, who will be lounging around\
    \ in the parlour glugging sherry and exchanging anecdotes, or, if puritanical,\
    \ as they probably are given the bleak forbidding grim authoritarian nature of\
    \ your household, sipping from tumblers of tap water and frowning in silence.\n\
    Bon appetit!"
