  text: "[Thomas Carlyle's] aversion for the \u2018fixed smile\u2019 of Greek statuary\
    \ was equal to that of Ruskin, and his way of expressing it no less individual.\
    \ Carlyle sat to G F Watts for his portrait, and Watts, as he often did in conversation\
    \ with his sitters, began to talk of Pheidias. Carlyle advanced a criticism which\
    \ no one else seems to have thought of. He contended that among all the sculptured\
    \ beings which the genius of Pheidias had produced there was \u2018not one clever\
    \ man\u2019. With the long upper lip of Ecclefechan obstinately tightened he declared\
    \ that a short upper lip showed an absence of intellect. He stuck to his point\
    \ even when Watts cited Napoleon, Byron, and Goethe as evidence against him. He\
    \ added that the jaw of the Greek was not sufficiently prominent. \u2018Depend\
    \ upon it,\u2019 said Carlyle, \u2018neither God nor man can get on without a\
    \ jaw.\u2019 \u2018There's not a clever man amongst them all,\u2019 he repeated,\
    \ \u2018and I would away with them\u2014into space.\u2019\nfrom William Gaunt,\
    \ Victorian Olympus (1952)\nThanks to Nige for alerting me to this splendid book,\
    \ in this post over at The Dabbler."
