  text: '[Thomas Carlyle''s] aversion for the ''fixed smile'' of Greek statuary was
    equal to that of Ruskin, and his way of expressing it no less individual. Carlyle
    sat to G F Watts for his portrait, and Watts, as he often did in conversation
    with his sitters, began to talk of Pheidias. Carlyle advanced a criticism which
    no one else seems to have thought of. He contended that among all the sculptured
    beings which the genius of Pheidias had produced there was ''not one clever man''.
    With the long upper lip of Ecclefechan obstinately tightened he declared that
    a short upper lip showed an absence of intellect. He stuck to his point even when
    Watts cited Napoleon, Byron, and Goethe as evidence against him. He added that
    the jaw of the Greek was not sufficiently prominent. ''Depend upon it,'' said
    Carlyle, ''neither God nor man can get on without a jaw.'' ''There''s not a clever
    man amongst them all,'' he repeated, ''and I would away with them--into space.''

    from William Gaunt, Victorian Olympus (1952)
