  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tzipi Blankette, again, Thank you very much for the helpful
    information about the little stint. I now wish to raise a completely unrelated
    matter. I read with great interest your piece on the feeding of a pigtape, and
    I find myself in something of a quandary. I would very much like to obtain a pet
    pigtape for my tiny infant, Bathsheba, but I have been told in no uncertain terms
    by a number of religious and spiritual authorities that she does not have a soul.
    One particularly forbidding Jesuit announced, in a booming voice, that little
    Bathsheba is the spawn of the devil. Apparently, it is rare for a baby to be born
    with vivid markings resembling the number 666 emblazoned atop their skull. Now
    she is some six years of age, her hair has grown and the markings are no longer
    visible, but Father Tonguelash S.J. says this makes no difference.

    Spawn of the devil or no, it does seem to be the case that Bathsheba is soulless,
    for her innards have been examined with probes, plungers, x-ray scanners, and
    geothermal imaging systems, and in among all the bones and veins and tissue and
    sinew and liver and lights etcetera there is indeed no sign of anything resembling
    a soul, which as we know is about the size and shape and colour of a plum tomato,
    though intangible and shimmering and glorious and immortal in a way that a plum
    tomato is not. That being so, Bathsheba has no suitable home in which a pigtape
    might nest, but I so want her to have one, especially now she is going to kindergarten.
    You know what children are like, and I fear she will be teased mercilessly.

    Please let me know if there is any advice you can give a poor addled parent at
    this difficult time. Yours even more sincerely than yesterday, Tzipi Blankette.

    Well, Tzipi, I suggest you ignore the Jesuits and just go ahead and buy a pigtape
    for your daughter. Most townlets have a pigtape supplier, usually located down
    one of the less salubrious alleyways near the railway station. Pigtapes may need
    a few days to acclimatise themselves to their new environment. Set aside a small
    nook or cranny in your home to settle the pigtape in, and before bringing it home
    lay out plenty of newspaper and throw the windows open. Place in the nook a small
    box or carton, lined with a scrap of fabric taken from a piece of clothing worn
    by its new owner, in this case Bathsheba. Some wool from one of her bonnets would
    be ideal. To help the pigtape get used to its new surroundings, avoid making loud
    noises or sudden movements in the vicinity of the carton. When it has had a few
    days to adjust, you can introduce it to Bathsheba gently, for two or three minutes
    at a time. If she is clutching in her little fist a leaf of lettuce, a radish,
    or some breadcrumbs, all the better. It is also a good idea to put out a saucer
    in which you can pour the dregs from a can of Squelcho!, but make sure Bathsheba
    doesn''t lap this up herself. After a few days, or weeks, or months, or in some
    cases even years, the pigtape will be thoroughly at home, and will creep, grunting,
    to its permanent nest, or sty, when you are not looking.

    NOTE : Mr Key wishes to thank Miss Dimity Cashew for her help with pigtape advice.'
