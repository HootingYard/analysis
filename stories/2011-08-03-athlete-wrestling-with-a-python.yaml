  text: 'On a frosty winter''s morning in the middle of the twentieth century, legendary
    athletics coach Old Halob stood at the side of a running track, stopwatch in hand,
    Homburg on head, racked with catarrh and puffing a cigarette. He was much perturbed.
    His protege, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, was pounding round and round the
    track at ever higher speeds, but Old Halob''s brain was a whirling chaos. He had
    not slept for weeks, and he was even more bad tempered than usual. The spindly
    fictional sprinter whizzing past him was causing the one-time secret policeman
    much vexation. He was running faster than ever, and when pole-vaulting he was
    pole-vaulting higher than ever. He was winning medals and cups in all sorts of
    fictional athletics meetings, not least the Gloriously Shining Medallion Of Gack,
    awarded to the champ of champs in the Pointy Town Auxiliary Substandard Jumping
    About League Reserve Heats. But for Old Halob, all this was as nought. For what
    he most desired for Bobnit Tivol was fame, and fame eluded him.

    In the narrow, enclosed world of fictional athletics Bobnit Tivol was of course
    a name to be reckoned with. Yet in the wider world he remained unknown. It had
    long been the dream of Old Halob that his protege be the cynosure of all eyes,
    a titan worshipped not just by fictional athletics fans but by all and sundry,
    the great and good and the hoi polloi. It may be, as some cynics liked to snigger,
    that the wily old coach wished to exploit the sprinter for financial gain. Worldwide
    fame would bring the money pouring in, whether it be for hiring out his image
    to be emblazoned on cardboard breakfast cereal packets or for personal appearances
    at the opening of fairgrounds. Nowadays we are used to such commercial shenanigans,
    but half a century ago they were almost unheard of. Old Halob remains an old fashioned
    figure in many ways, but he always saw himself as a man o'' the future, and in
    pursuit of that vision he strained every sinew, sclerotic though his sinews may
    have been, if there is such a thing as a sclerotic sinew.

    So on that frosty, icy morning, Old Halob took one last puff on his acrid Serbian
    cigarette, and, barking a command to the fictional athlete to keep sprinting faster
    and faster round the running track until his return, he trudged away. He headed
    for an insalubrious part of town where he might find solace in rotgut hooch and
    squalor. And it was as he was about to turn down a particularly dismal alleyway
    that he was accosted by an urchin hawking grubby wares.

    "Oi, mister, I''m your urchin if you need some spent matches or tattered bootlaces
    or chewed-up dog biscuits or leaking batteries or contaminated sausages or poisoned
    cans of Squelcho! or regurgitated hairballs or back copies of the Reader''s Digest!
    Everything''s a half-crown!"

    "Your wares are preposterously expensive," said Old Halob, "But here is a half-crown
    for a back copy of the Reader''s Digest. I shall want something to read while
    I benumb my brain with hooch."

    Later, sitting in the dinge of an ill-starred tavern glugging from a bottle of
    90% proof Monsignor''s Spasm, Old Halob flicked through the pages of the magazine
    hoping to find something that might take his mind off his woes. There was an article
    entitled "I Am John''s Head" which diverted him briefly, as did a piece about
    a heroic anti-communist housewife. He made a stab at a quiz based on anagrams
    of "Ayn Rand". Then he came upon a picture spread of artworks by Sir Frederic
    Leighton (1830-1896), and saw something that made fireworks go off in his brain.
    It was a photograph of a sculpture by Leighton entitled Athlete Wrestling With
    A Python (1877). Old Halob was transfixed. He ordered another bottle of hooch,
    and began to formulate a scheme.


    Leighton''s sculpture had been a great popular success in its day. Why, then,
    if Old Halob were to create a modern adaptation, Fictional Athlete Wrestling With
    A Real Python, would that not equally astound the public? What could better propel
    fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol to universal acclaim than the sight of him doing
    battle with an all too real python, and winning?

    Draining his second bottle and reeling out of the tavern into the ghastly streets,
    Old Halob decided to leave his spindly protege haring round the track for the
    time being while he set off to find a python. There was a zoo and a number of
    menageries in the town, but they were all shut, it being a Thursday. Tacked up
    on a lamppost he saw a notice about a newly opened snakepit, and boarded a tram
    to take him there, but the tram crashed into a parade of horses and Old Halob
    was among a number of tram passengers and equestriennes who were ferried to a
    clinic on stretchers. It was nightfall before he was released, bloody and bandaged,
    and he made his way to the running track where, in dusk and drizzle, fictional
    athlete Bobnit Tivol, as close to exhaustion as a fictional athlete can be, was
    still zooming round and round. Old Halob parped his whistle, and young Bobnit
    collapsed in a fictional heap upon the cinders.

    "Great news!" shouted Old Halob, "Tomorrow you shall wrestle a real python, and
    the world will be agog!"

    "Gack," panted Bobnit Tivol, collapsing still further.

    The next day dawned with more frost and ice and drizzle. Old Halob dragged his
    fictional protege to the pole-vaulting practice pit and told him to practise pole-vaulting
    until such time as he returned bearing a python. The catarrh-racked coach then
    trudged off to the zoo, to find that it was shut, being a Friday. He soon discovered
    the menageries were likewise shut, and that following the tram crash of the day
    before, no trams were running. Passing the lamppost where he had seen the sign
    announcing the opening of the snakepit, he saw it had been altered, the opening
    having been cancelled by dint of civic pomposity.

    "Where oh where am I to find a python?" wailed Old Halob.

    At once, from the gloom of a gruesome nook, a figure appeared, like Harry Lime
    in The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949). But he looked nothing like Orson Welles.
    His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his
    hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but
    these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
    seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set,
    his shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips. His voice, when at last
    he spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any
    variation in tone or cadence.

    "You will find no pythons here," he boomed, "But hie thee to the Bottomless Viper
    Pit of Gaar. There you will find vipers."

    And with that, the gruesome nook was again engulfed in gloom, and the figure vanished.

    As he trudged to the railway station to catch the stopping train to Gaar, Old
    Halob wondered if perhaps, from time to time, a python might stray into the bottomless
    viper pit. Failing that, he supposed he could obtain a viper and disguise it as
    a python or, in extremis, rely upon the ophiological stupidity of the great unwashed.
    Spitting into a bramble-bush, Old Halob reflected that the masses, presented with
    the fantastic spectacle of a fictional athlete wrestling with a real snake, would
    be unlikely to worry their pointy little heads about precisely what kind of snake
    it was. He would say it was a python, and lo!, a python it would be.

    It happened that the stopping train to Gaar stopped not only at every single damned
    station along the branch line, but also, repeatedly, in sidings, for hours and
    even days at a time. The delay thus caused was to prove fatal to Old Halob''s
    otherwise flawless plan. And flawless indeed did it seem when, arriving eventually
    at the bottomless viper pit, the man in the Homburg hat was greeted by the Duty
    Viperist, brandishing a net in which writhed a living python.

    "What ho!" said this fellow, who bore a striking resemblance to Orson Welles,
    "I have just ennetted a python that had somehow strayed into the bottomless viper
    pit. Luckily, I spotted it while it was still near the top of the bottomless pit,
    otherwise who knows what manner of slithery hissy funny business might have transpired
    down towards the earth''s molten core. An asp got down there once and caused quite
    a kerfuffle among the vipers. But tsk tsk here''s me carrying on like a garrulous
    bon vivant good and proper! How may I help you on this frosty icy drizzly day
    in Gaar?"

    "Give the python to me," rapped Old Halob.

    "I ought really return it to the Nest o'' Writhing Pythons just downaways past
    the viaduct," said the Viperist, "But I have just had my breakfast and I am mad
    with cornflakes, so here, the python is yours."

    On the way back to Pointy Town, the stopping train stopped even more often than
    it had on the outward journey. But at last, long overdue, it chugged into the
    railway station. Old Halob retrieved the python from where he had stowed it in
    the goods carriage and trudged off in frost and ice and drizzle to the pole-vaulting
    practice pit. He was pleased to see that fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol was still,
    relentlessly, pole-vaulting ever higher and higher. He parped his whistle and
    the spindly youngster collapsed in a heap in the sandpit.

    "Later today," announced Old Halob, "Your name will ring out from sea to shining
    sea, and beyond, possibly even to planets and worldlets yet uncharted in the immensity
    of the boundless universe. Yes, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, you are to wrestle
    this python I have slung around my shoulders. At the moment it is in an induced
    coma. But I shall awaken it as soon as I have rented a large canvas tent and a
    wrestling ring and put up posters and sounded a klaxon to bring the great and
    the good and the hoi polloi in their teeming masses to witness a spectacle unlike
    anything the world has seen since 1877 when Sir Frederic Leighton unveiled his
    sculpture Athlete Wrestling With A Python! Think of the fame that will accrue
    to your spindly frame as you overpower the vicious serpent and crush it beneath
    your fictional running spikes! I feel sure your image will appear on cardboard
    breakfast cereal packets and you will be invited to open fairgrounds before this
    day is done!"

    "Gack," panted Bobnit Tivol, collapsing still further.

    Half a century later, we might still be babbling excitedly about Old Halob''s
    visionary doodah. The tent and ring were rented, the posters put up, the klaxon
    sounded. The python was woken from its coma and placed in a ringside python-holding-unit
    of netting and bamboo. Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol was limbering up in his
    fictional ringside limberarium. Puffing on his high tar cigarette, Old Halob looked
    out from the tent flap, expecting to see the teeming throngs come hurrying across
    the fields, an excited hubbub. Yet the fields were deserted, apart from a few
    dejected and immobile cows.

    Such had been the delays occasioned by the stopping train to Gaar, on its wheezing
    journeys there and back, that frosty icy January had turned to frosty icy February.
    And today it was the sixth of February 1958, and the news had swept across town
    of the Munich Air Disaster, and the deaths of the Busby Babes, and all of Pointy
    Town was in mourning. On such a black day for sport, the last thing anybody wanted
    to see was a fictional athlete wrestling with a real python.'
