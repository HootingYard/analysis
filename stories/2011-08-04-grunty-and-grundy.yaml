  text: "When I was telling you how to make a life-size wolf out of marzipan, I pointed\
    \ out that it made a splendid teatime treat for both one's extended family and\
    \ for smaller kinship grouplets. This prompted a letter from Miss Dimity Cashew,\
    \ who chided me for excluding those poor lonely souls who have neither. Curiously,\
    \ she picked as an example the Grunty Man, that monster of children's nightmares\
    \ who lurks alone in his horrible cave, without a Mrs Grunty or anyone else to\
    \ share his grunty depravities and/or delights. I say \u201Ccuriously\u201D, because\
    \ quite why one would want to present the Grunty Man with a marzipan wolf, or\
    \ with any other kind of gift, unless it be an offering to assuage his grunty\
    \ depredations, is a moot point.\nAnyway, I tossed Miss Cashew's letter into my\
    \ bakelite \u201Cpending\u201D hub and thought no more about it. But now, correspondence\
    \ from a different correspondent raises the issue of whether in fact the Grunty\
    \ Man does have some kind of family ties.\nDear Mr. Key, writes Tabitha Brown,\
    \ I am writing to you concerning two legendary bogeypersons, first the Grunty\
    \ Man, and second Mrs Grundy, about whom Emily Post wrote in her Blue Book of\
    \ Social Usage, at least in the earlier editions (as the more recent incarnations\
    \ of the manual regrettably make no mention of her). Apart from having similar\
    \ names and delighting in the destruction of the young, are these two characters\
    \ related in any way? I eagerly await your response, which I hope will prove to\
    \ be edifying. Thank you for your consideration upon this matter.\nMs Brown helpfully\
    \ enclosed some snapshots, which I reproduce below, and which can be enlarged\
    \ to gigantic proportions by clicking on them.\n\n\nI have not yet been able to\
    \ do all the research necessary to provide a definitive answer to the question.\
    \ However, the fact that Emily Post's Mrs Grundy has a pet magpie and a pet jackal\
    \ is telling. The Grunty Man, too, is known to keep pets, among which may or may\
    \ not be a magpie and a jackal. Nobody has ever dared enter his horrible cave\
    \ to carry out an inventory of such beasts as he keeps as pets, and he rarely\
    \ allows them out of the foetid gloom. Clearly there is more work to be done on\
    \ this important subject. In the meantime, it seems that Miss Dimity Cashew can\
    \ put her mind at rest, albeit tentatively, regarding the Grunty Man's possession\
    \ of kith and kin."
