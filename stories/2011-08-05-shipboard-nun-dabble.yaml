  text: "\nFor my cupboard in The Dabbler this week I have exhumed, dusted down, and\
    \ spruced up a short piece that appeared on Hooting Yard long long ago. It occurs\
    \ to me that it serves as a first variation on a theme by Gerard Manley Hopkins,\
    \ the \u201Ctheme\u201D in this case being the tall nun from The Wreck Of The\
    \ Deutschland. Her name, incidentally, was Henrica Fassbender, her last words\
    \ were reported as \u201COh Christ, Christ, come quickly!\u201D, and her body\
    \ was never found. But she is commemorated on the headstone in St Patrick's Cemetery,\
    \ Leytonstone, where the other four drowned Franciscan nuns were buried. Go here\
    \ for a photograph of the headstone and an amusing anecdote.\nSister Hortense,\
    \ the even taller nun in my little tale, is not actually based on Henrica Fassbender.\
    \ All they have in common is nundom, tallness, and of course a predilection for\
    \ ships, in Hortense's case a barquentine, in Henrica's a German steamship."
