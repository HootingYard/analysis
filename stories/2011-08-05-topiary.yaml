  text: '"The man who sneers at me for admiring, as I do, a well-cut peacock, may
    take my assurance in advance that I will neither kick him nor abuse him; but pity
    him I must."--Shirley Hibberd, the epigraph to The Book Of Topiary, which you
    can, and must, read in its entirety at the excellent Public Domain Review.
