  text: 'In my dream last night, I attended, as an observer, a revolutionary tribunal
    held in a sort of warehouse, where the members of Henry Cow were arraigned before
    a committee of hardline Irish Maoists, charged with imperialist deviation. I am
    afraid to say it was decided that Chris Cutler be taken out and shot.
