  text: 'Dramatis Personae:

    ROBERT FRIPP, modest and bashful egghead electric guitar wizard

    TOYAH WILCOX, pint-sized popstrel, his wife

    PATRICIA FRIPP, executive skills coach and motivational speaker, his sister

    PETE SINFIELD, magician who weaves spells with words, King Crimson lyricist

    Scene One. Toyah''s so-called "Yoko House", a property devoted entirely to storage
    of archives and memorabilia of her glittering career. Toyah is sorting through
    a pile of old videotapes of her appearances on Top Of The Pops, three decades
    ago.

    Enter Robert Fripp, carrying an electric guitar.

    ROBERT FRIPP : Hello, pint-sized popstrel wife!

    TOYAH WILCOX : Hello Robert. Have you invented a new electric guitar technique
    today?

    ROBERT FRIPP : Not yet, my dear, not yet.

    TOYAH WLCOX : You''d better buck your ideath up! The world lookth to you for thintillating
    electric guitar innovationth.

    Robert Fripp passes a hand over his startlingly intelligent forehead, momentarily
    overcome by the weight of his responsibility.

    ROBERT FRIPP : I can''t come up with something as fantastic as Frippertronics
    every day, sweetie.

    TOYAH WILCOX : I don''t thee why not. You jutht took a thimple feedback loop thing
    already practithed by many experimental guitarithtth and called it Frippertronicth
    with your wonderful modethty. I''m thure there are thome other techniqueth lying
    around that you could altho lay claim to.

    ROBERT FRIPP : (sighing) I don''t know. Sometimes I think my gigantic brain has
    taken the electric guitar as far as it can go. Perhaps I need a brand new field
    to which I can devote my pulsating intellect.

    Scene Two. The executive boardroom of Cakes R Us, a major player in the cake manufacturing
    industry. Patricia Fripp is addressing the assembled executives.

    PATRICIA FRIPP : OK, still the hubbub! I know I have been described as "one of
    the ten most electrifying speakers in North America", but right now you have to
    stay calm and concentrate on cake sales figures. Let''s kick some ideas around
    the flagpole and push envelopes into a box. Brainstorm, guys!

    The executives brainstorm in various little grouplets or "idea silos".

    Scene Three. Toyah''s "Yoko House".

    TOYAH WILCOX : Robert, give me a hand with thith pile of coloured vinyl copieth
    of my hit thingle "It''th A Mythtery".

    ROBERT FRIPP : Will do, poppet, just as soon as I have finished cogitating.

    The telephone rings. Toyah picks up the receiver.

    TOYAH WILCOX : Hello?

    She listens for a while and then puts the phone down.

    TOYAH WILCOX ; Well, Robert, that wath very exthiting. It wath your thithter Patrithia,
    calling from a very important conferenthe of cake executiveth in North America.
    They want to expand their cake buthineth to the UK by holding cake thaleth at
    countrythide fairth and bazaarth and jamboreeth. Patrithia thinkth you would be
    the perfect perthon to add gravitath and therebral heft to thuch eventth.

    ROBERT FRIPP : You mean I should cast aside the electric guitar and devote myself
    to innovations in cake-selling?

    TOYAH WILCOX : Yeth.

    ROBERT FRIPP : It would certainly give me a whole new area to which to apply my
    giant egghead brain! I must go and see Pete Sinfield at once!

    Scene Four. The palatial residence of Pete Sinfield, whose lyrics have been intoned
    by top prog artists such as King Crimson, Emerson Lake & Palmer, Leo Sayer and
    Bucks Fizz. Pete is sitting at an escritoire, writing the lyrics for a pop song
    with a quill upon parchment.

    Enter ROBERT FRIPP

    PETE SINFIELD : Hello, Robert. It''s a good job my residence is palatial, with
    huge doorways wide enough for your superb bespectacled egghead to fit through.

    ROBERT FRIPP : I need some lyrics about cake for my new project.

    PETE SINFIELD : Hmm. Let the Muse descend. "The lady in white robes floats o''er
    the mystic lake / And on the wind are borne towards her many sorts of cake".

    ROBERT FRIPP : Brilliant! Thanks, Pete.

    Scene Five. A countryside fete, somewhere in England. Inside a marquee, beside
    a sign bearing his wife''s name, Robert Fripp proffers a tray of cakes to passers-by.

    ROBERT FRIPP : Roll up, roll up. These aren''t just cakes. They are an entirely
    new teatime snack I call Frippocakeys.

    TOYAH WILCOX, PATRICIA FRIPP, & PETE SINFIELD (looking on in awestruck admiration)
    : Truly, Robert Fripp has brought something entirely new and original to the world
    of cakes.

    Curtain.
