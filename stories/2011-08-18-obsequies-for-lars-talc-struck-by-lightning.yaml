  text: '

    This is the cover of Obsequies For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning. It was published
    in an edition of twenty-five copies in 1994, under the Hooting Yard Press imprint
    and--save for a brief, rewritten, extract posted here some years ago--has never
    again seen the light of day. It was the last piece of prose I completed before
    my descent into the maelstrom, or the Wilderness Years, or whatever one wants
    to call that period of ruination from which I eventually emerged with the launch
    of the Hooting Yard website in 2003.

    I am planning to republish Obsequies, with the original text unaltered, as the
    second volume in the Out Of Print Pamphlets Reprinted series, later this year.
    Meanwhile, I have decided to read the whole thing on the radio, starting with
    this evening''s episode of Hooting Yard On The Air on Resonance104.4FM, continuing
    next week, and possibly the week after. (I''m not sure how long it will take.)

    Turn on, tune in, pin back your ears, and listen.'
