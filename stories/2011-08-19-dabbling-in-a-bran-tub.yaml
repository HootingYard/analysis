  text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler, my cupboard contains a bran tub of bittybobs.\
    \ To give you some idea of what I am talking about, here is the Oxford English\
    \ Dictionary definition of bran-tub (with a hyphen) which, as you can see, leads\
    \ directly to its definition of bran-pie (also with a hyphen), a term I confess\
    \ is entirely new to me:\n bran-tub n. = bran-pie n.; also fig.\n1858 C. Parry\_\
    in E. Parry\_Mem. (1870) vii. 173\_\_ It quite reminded me of the bran-tub itself\
    \ as I unpacked each separate article.\n 1909 Westm. Gaz. 22 Apr. 8/2\_\_ Sideshows\
    \ will contain the ever-popular phrenologist's tent and bran-tub.\n 1963 Times\
    \ Lit. Suppl. 26 Apr. 313/3\_\_ This is a mathematical bran-tub.\n bran-pie n.\
    \ a tub full of bran with small gifts hidden in it to be drawn out at random,\
    \ as part of festivities at Christmas, etc.\n1877 Cassell's Family Mag. May 377/1\_\
    \_ In the last division of the tent we had\u2025a bran-pie.\u2025 The bran-pie\
    \ was an oblong washing-tub\u2025filled with bran, in which were hidden\u2025\
    small articles.\n 1889 Peel City Guardian 28 Dec. 7/4\_\_ Sometimes what is termed\
    \ a \u2018bran pie\u2019 is employed\u2025for storing the presents in.\n 1904\
    \ Daily Chron. 27 Feb. 3/2\_\_ The bran-pie\u2025is the receptacle of second-rate\
    \ presents: gifts not quite showy enough to be displayed upon a Christmas tree.\n\
    \ 1916 Daily Colonist (Victoria, Brit. Columbia) 4 July 4/4\_\_ All sorts of seasonable\
    \ refreshments will be served and the blue ribbon girls will have an attraction\
    \ in the form of a bran pie.\n 1931 V. Woolf\_Waves 236,\_\_ I think more disinterestedly\
    \ than I could when I was young and must dig furiously like a child rummaging\
    \ in a bran-pie to discover my self.\nI am disconcerted to learn, however, that\
    \ neither bittybob (without a hyphen) nor bitty-bob (with a hyphen) is defined\
    \ in the OED. Can such things be?, to quote Ambrose Bierce."
