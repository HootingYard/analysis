  text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler, my cupboard contains a bran tub of bittybobs.\
    \ To give you some idea of what I am talking about, here is the Oxford English\
    \ Dictionary definition of bran-tub (with a hyphen) which, as you can see, leads\
    \ directly to its definition of bran-pie (also with a hyphen), a term I confess\
    \ is entirely new to me:\n bran-tub n. = bran-pie n.; also fig.\n1858 C. Parry\
    \ in E. Parry Mem. (1870) vii. 173   It quite reminded me of the bran-tub itself\
    \ as I unpacked each separate article.\n 1909 Westm. Gaz. 22 Apr. 8/2   Sideshows\
    \ will contain the ever-popular phrenologist's tent and bran-tub.\n 1963 Times\
    \ Lit. Suppl. 26 Apr. 313/3   This is a mathematical bran-tub.\n bran-pie n. a\
    \ tub full of bran with small gifts hidden in it to be drawn out at random, as\
    \ part of festivities at Christmas, etc.\n1877 Cassell's Family Mag. May 377/1\
    \   In the last division of the tent we had..a bran-pie... The bran-pie was an\
    \ oblong washing-tub..filled with bran, in which were hidden..small articles.\n\
    \ 1889 Peel City Guardian 28 Dec. 7/4   Sometimes what is termed a 'bran pie'\
    \ is employed..for storing the presents in.\n 1904 Daily Chron. 27 Feb. 3/2  \
    \ The bran-pie..is the receptacle of second-rate presents: gifts not quite showy\
    \ enough to be displayed upon a Christmas tree.\n 1916 Daily Colonist (Victoria,\
    \ Brit. Columbia) 4 July 4/4   All sorts of seasonable refreshments will be served\
    \ and the blue ribbon girls will have an attraction in the form of a bran pie.\n\
    \ 1931 V. Woolf Waves 236,   I think more disinterestedly than I could when I\
    \ was young and must dig furiously like a child rummaging in a bran-pie to discover\
    \ my self.\nI am disconcerted to learn, however, that neither bittybob (without\
    \ a hyphen) nor bitty-bob (with a hyphen) is defined in the OED. Can such things\
    \ be?, to quote Ambrose Bierce."
