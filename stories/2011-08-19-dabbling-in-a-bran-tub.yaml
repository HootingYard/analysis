    This week in The Dabbler, my cupboard contains a bran tub of bittybobs. To give
    you some idea of what I am talking about, here is the Oxford English Dictionary
    definition of bran-tub (with a hyphen) which, as you can see, leads directly to
    its definition of bran-pie (also with a hyphen), a term I confess is entirely
    new to me:

    bran-tub n. = bran-pie n.; also fig.

    1858 C. Parry in E. Parry Mem. (1870) vii. 173   It quite reminded me of the bran-tub
    itself as I unpacked each separate article.

    1909 Westm. Gaz. 22 Apr. 8/2   Sideshows will contain the ever-popular phrenologist''s
    tent and bran-tub.

    1963 Times Lit. Suppl. 26 Apr. 313/3   This is a mathematical bran-tub.

    bran-pie n. a tub full of bran with small gifts hidden in it to be drawn out at
    random, as part of festivities at Christmas, etc.

    1877 Cassell''s Family Mag. May 377/1   In the last division of the tent we had..a
    bran-pie... The bran-pie was an oblong washing-tub..filled with bran, in which
    were hidden..small articles.

    1889 Peel City Guardian 28 Dec. 7/4   Sometimes what is termed a ''bran pie''
    is employed..for storing the presents in.

    1904 Daily Chron. 27 Feb. 3/2   The bran-pie..is the receptacle of second-rate
    presents: gifts not quite showy enough to be displayed upon a Christmas tree.

    1916 Daily Colonist (Victoria, Brit. Columbia) 4 July 4/4   All sorts of seasonable
    refreshments will be served and the blue ribbon girls will have an attraction
    in the form of a bran pie.

    1931 V. Woolf Waves 236,   I think more disinterestedly than I could when I was
    young and must dig furiously like a child rummaging in a bran-pie to discover
    my self.

    I am disconcerted to learn, however, that neither bittybob (without a hyphen)
    nor bitty-bob (with a hyphen) is defined in the OED. Can such things be?, to quote
    Ambrose Bierce.'
