  text: "Seven years ago at Hooting Yard, this\u2026\nPeople often wonder why a bird\
    \ sanctuary was created at Bodger's Spinney, for it is a somewhat gloomy spot.\
    \ The moving spirit behind this avian paradise on earth was one Merrill Stubing,\
    \ a man who, incidentally, was later to share his name with a fictional character.\
    \ Although they had nought else in common, this was the name of the captain of\
    \ The Love Boat, an exciting television series of the 1970s, long after the real\
    \ \u201CBird Man\u201D Stubing was dead.\nBesotted with birds, Stubing lit upon\
    \ Bodger's Spinney as the perfect place for his planned sanctuary after accidentally\
    \ wandering across it when he got lost on a Sunday morning jaunt with his colleagues\
    \ from the Pastry Works. Hurling his considerable energy into the project, Stubing\
    \ called for a meeting of interested parties, where he outlined his vision as\
    \ follows:\nAnd the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof\
    \ into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not\
    \ be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation\
    \ to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.\
    \ But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven\
    \ shall dwell in it; and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and\
    \ the stones of emptiness.\nAnd that, children, is why there is a bird sanctuary\
    \ at Bodger's Spinney."
