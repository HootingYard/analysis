  text: "MR KEY goes to see DR FANG, a wholly imaginary expert in the field of distempers\
    \ and maladies of the cranium.\nDR FANG\u2014Good afternoon, Mr Key, and what\
    \ brings you to my consulting room on this fine day of overcast skies and drizzle?\n\
    MR KEY\u2014I suffer greatly, Dr Fang, greatly!\nDR FANG\u2014Plop yourself onto\
    \ that ergonomic beanbag and unburden yourself of your sorrows, Mr Key. I am all\
    \ ears.\nMR KEY\u2014I am experiencing a debilitating attack of vacancy-between-the-ears,\
    \ Dr Fang. It is as if my brain is empty.\nDR FANG\u2014You have suffered such\
    \ symptoms before, I think, Mr Key, if I am not mistaken.\nMR KEY\u2014Indeed\
    \ I have, Dr Fang. Whereas usually my brain can be relied upon to emit fumous\
    \ babblings which I then, via a keyboard, tippytap on to what our Belgian chums\
    \ call Het Internet, now I find myself staring like a mongoose into a vacuum.\n\
    DR FANG\u2014Hold that thought, Mr Key, hold that thought. I am not sure it means\
    \ anything, which could be a sign of your distemper and malady of the cranium,\
    \ the field in which I am, as you know, an expert, albeit a wholly imaginary one.\n\
    MR KEY\u2014Yes, Dr Fang, that is why I have come to see you.\nDR FANG\u2014A\
    \ sound decision, if I may say so, Mr Key. What you must understand is that even\
    \ an empty cranium can eject or spurt forth mighty prose, or babblings, whichever\
    \ term one prefers.\nMR KEY\u2014But how can that be, Dr Fang?\nDR FANG\u2014\
    Do not forget, Mr Key, that though your head be empty, like the Basket of Saint\
    \ Dymphna, much, oh! much has gushed from it heretofore, if I am using the word\
    \ heretofore correctly. Thus, for example, only recently from within your cranial\
    \ integuments there burst forth a rather amusing bagatelle about Robert Fripp\
    \ and his wife and his sister and the bard Sinfield. You recall it, do you not?\n\
    MR KEY\u2014Yes, yes I do!\nDR FANG\u2014Well then, Mr Key, what could be simpler\
    \ than to let brew in your brain something inspired by another titan of prog?\
    \ To pluck a name at random, how about Ian Anderson? Could you not consider the\
    \ gestation of a piece where the Jethro Tull frontman is, let us say, invited\
    \ to give the keynote speech at the annual convention of the Association Of Flautists\
    \ Who Stand Upon One Leg While Tootling?\nMR KEY\u2014Well\u2026 I suppose I could,\
    \ Dr Fang.\nDR FANG\u2014Do not just suppose, Mr Key, do! Act! As Father Hopkins\
    \ said, Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here Buckle!\n\
    MR KEY\u2014You are right, Dr Fang. I shall indeed Buckle!, as in Buckle down\
    \ to the task.\nDR FANG\u2014That's the spirit! Now haul yourself up from my ergonomic\
    \ beanbag and get ye hence! Ian Anderson won't write that keynote speech himself.\n\
    MR KEY\u2014Thank you so much for your help, Dr Fang.\nOutside, the skies were\
    \ still overcast, and the drizzle still spat. MR KEY made his imaginary way homeward,\
    \ past ditches and puddles and bracken and muck. As Anderson sang, more than forty\
    \ years ago, it was a new day yesterday, but it's an old day now. How true that\
    \ was, in a very real sense, how true\u2026"
