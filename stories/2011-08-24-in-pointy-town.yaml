  text: 'In Pointy Town, when they bury a dead Pointy Towner in the Pointy Town cemetery,
    they dig a pointy grave using a pointy shovel. The gravediggers have pointy spades,
    too, but they are not as pointy as the shovels. The shovels could not be more
    pointy.

    There is a price to be paid for all this pointiness. It is a price paid sometimes
    in blood, sometimes in coinage, and sometimes in toads. Pointy Towners will roam
    the marsh flats outside Pointy Town collecting in baskets the toads that live
    there. Most of the toads have pointy bits, though perhaps they are more knobby
    than pointy. Pointy Town''s genetic engineers are working hard to breed a pointier
    toad. If and when they succeed, the knobby toads will become worthless as currency
    and will be left to go about their toady business in the marsh flats undisturbed.'
