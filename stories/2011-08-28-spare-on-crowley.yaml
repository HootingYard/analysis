  text: "If the press notices [of Austin Osman Spare's first West End gallery show]\
    \ were calculated to put many visitors off, there was something about them that\
    \ would prove positively attractive to a few. Among them was the so-called Wickedest\
    \ Man in the World, the self-styled Beast 666; and so it was that Aleister Crowley\
    \ came striding through the door of number 13 Bruton Street, grandly announcing\
    \ himself to the shy and awkward artist as the \u201CVicegerent of God upon Earth\u201D\
    \u2026 Spare thought he looked more like \u201Can Italian ponce out of work\u201D\
    , or so he told a friend years later. Perhaps with the benefit of four decades\
    \ of hindsight, he said this was what he had told Crowley at the time.\nFrom Austin\
