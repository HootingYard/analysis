  text: 'If the press notices [of Austin Osman Spare''s first West End gallery show]
    were calculated to put many visitors off, there was something about them that
    would prove positively attractive to a few. Among them was the so-called Wickedest
    Man in the World, the self-styled Beast 666; and so it was that Aleister Crowley
    came striding through the door of number 13 Bruton Street, grandly announcing
    himself to the shy and awkward artist as the "Vicegerent of God upon Earth"...
    Spare thought he looked more like "an Italian ponce out of work", or so he told
    a friend years later. Perhaps with the benefit of four decades of hindsight, he
    said this was what he had told Crowley at the time.
