  text: "More from Phil Baker's biography of Austin Osman Spare, one of the chief\
    \ pleasures of which is its plethora of anecdotes and asides. Such as this:\n\
    In the 1960s Ted Hughes and Peter Brook attempted to develop a language called\
    \ Orghast, effectively a magical language where words would have \u201Ca more\
    \ inevitable relationship to reality\u201D. For example, the Orghast for \u201C\
    darkness opens its womb\u201D (\u201Cstaple of any phrasebook\u201D as a cynic\
    \ writes) is BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR.\nI would like to learn and become fluent in\
    \ Orghast. Apparently it has a vocabulary of some two thousand words, but of these\
    \ only about fifty count as \u201Creal Orghast\u201D, according to Ted Hughes,\
    \ and he should know. I wonder what the Orghast is for \u201CBy \u2018eck, Sylvia,\
    \ when you first kissed me you drew blood\u201D.\nI hope, when I have mastered\
    \ the fifty magic words, that I do not have the dismissive attitude of Rayner\
    \ Heppenstall towards another invented language\nI had never thought highly of\
    \ Esperanto (my father had once tried to make me learn it, but when I found the\
    \ word for bird was \u2018birdo\u2019 I could no longer take it seriously)."
