  text: 'More from Phil Baker''s biography of Austin Osman Spare, one of the chief
    pleasures of which is its plethora of anecdotes and asides. Such as this:

    In the 1960s Ted Hughes and Peter Brook attempted to develop a language called
    Orghast, effectively a magical language where words would have "a more inevitable
    relationship to reality". For example, the Orghast for "darkness opens its womb"
    ("staple of any phrasebook" as a cynic writes) is BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR.

    I would like to learn and become fluent in Orghast. Apparently it has a vocabulary
    of some two thousand words, but of these only about fifty count as "real Orghast",
    according to Ted Hughes, and he should know. I wonder what the Orghast is for
    "By ''eck, Sylvia, when you first kissed me you drew blood".

    I hope, when I have mastered the fifty magic words, that I do not have the dismissive
    attitude of Rayner Heppenstall towards another invented language

    I had never thought highly of Esperanto (my father had once tried to make me learn
    it, but when I found the word for bird was ''birdo'' I could no longer take it
    seriously).'
