  text: "There are cream teas, and then there are\u2026 psychic cream teas.\n\nI have\
    \ questions.\n1. Is the cream tea a mere addendum to the psychic reading?\n2.\
    \ Or is the cream tea itself imbued with psychic woohoohoodiwoo?\n3. Does one\
    \ partake of the cream tea and become psychic?\n4. If so, for how long do the\
    \ effects last?\n5. Why is that squiggly graphic shoved so far off-centre?\n6.\
    \ Was this psychic cream tea available at the same countryside fair as Robert\
    \ Fripp's legendary \u201CToyah\u201D cake sale?\nMany thanks to Outa_Spaceman\
    \ for providing me with this important snap."
