  text: "The splendid people at the increasingly essential Public Domain Review asked\
    \ me to write a brief piece on a curious compilation of dog anecdotes published\
    \ in 1895. You will of course drop everything to go and read it, and when you\
    \ do please pay particular attention to the author's apology, which I quote in\
    \ full, and which contains the lovely line \u201Cthe writers may be dead or out\
    \ of England\u201D, which somehow suggests that these are equivalent states. Perhaps\
    \ they are."
