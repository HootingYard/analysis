  text: "In an 1829 [stage] adaptation of Walter Scott's Guy Mannering, a character\
    \ is lost on a storm-racked Scottish heath, when suddenly: \u201CHa! What do I\
    \ see on this lonely heath? A Piano? Who could be lonely with that? The moon will\
    \ shortly rise and light me from this unhallowed place; so, to console myself,\
    \ I will sing one of Julia's favourite melodies.\u201D And he does.\nFrom The\
    \ Invention Of Murder\_: How The Victorians Revelled In Death And Detection And\
    \ Created Modern Crime by Judith Flanders (2011)"
