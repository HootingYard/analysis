  text: 'For some reason, quite possibly ignorance, I have never made it my practice
    to add "tags" to Hooting Yard postages. I shove them into a category, but have
    always neglected the tags. It is not something I have thought about, until today,
    when I have realised that a skilled "tagger" can create something approaching
    poetry.

    The friend who I thumped on the bonce with the Hammer of Thumpiness, until she
    caved in and began blogging, is only six posts in at BlackberryJuniper And Sherbet,
    yet her grasp of tagging is a wonder to behold. Consider this:

    memory

    rain

    Swanage

    wind

    What a corker! Time, surely, to eject Carol Ann Duffy* from the Laureateship and
    appoint my friend in her stead.

    * NOTE : The preposterous Duffy''s latest witterings argue that teenpersons''
    txt-spk has poetic potential. Shouldn''t she be promoting literacy rather than
    garbled barbarism?'
