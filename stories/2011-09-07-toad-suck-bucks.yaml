  text: "\nHooting Yard's global dominion is well-attested, and there are readers\
    \ and listeners all over the world. Some are fortunate enough to live and breathe\
    \ and have their being in places with fantastic names. Consider the reader who\
    \ sent me a snap of his membership card for Toad Suck Buck's, a \u201Crestaurant\
    \ and river vista\u201D in Toad Suck, Arkansas. Toad Suck, I am told, is in a\
    \ \u201Cdry\u201D county, so in order to serve its customers with alcoholic beverages,\
    \ Buck's is a \u201Cprivite\u201D club. I am eager to join, and I bet you are\
    \ too. Meanwhile, I am thrilled to know there is a Toad Suck Branch of the Hooting\
    \ Yard Fan Club.\n"
