    Hooting Yard''s global dominion is well-attested, and there are readers and listeners
    all over the world. Some are fortunate enough to live and breathe and have their
    being in places with fantastic names. Consider the reader who sent me a snap of
    his membership card for Toad Suck Buck''s, a "restaurant and river vista" in Toad
    Suck, Arkansas. Toad Suck, I am told, is in a "dry" county, so in order to serve
    its customers with alcoholic beverages, Buck''s is a "privite" club. I am eager
    to join, and I bet you are too. Meanwhile, I am thrilled to know there is a Toad
    Suck Branch of the Hooting Yard Fan Club.
