  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, Always keen to keep abreast of the latest
    happenstances in popular culture, last evening I sat me down with a mug of cocoa
    and a bag of filberts to watch the Mercury Music Prize awards. I was saddened
    to see that young pop person Tinie Tempah, who was shortlisted, failed to win.
    Anyway, as I dabbed away my tears, it occurred to me to ask you if Master Tempah
    is in any way related to that other excellent tiny, Tiny Enid. Please enlighten
    me.

    Dear Tim, In this bewildering world it is critical that we can distinguish one
    tiny from another. Actually, that isn''t strictly true, now I come to think of
    it. What matters is that we can tell Tiny Enid apart from all other extant tinies.

    Tiny Enid is a heroic clubfooted infant, usually dressed in a polka dot frock,
    much given to brave, even reckless, deeds of derring-do, and of pronounced Fascist
    sympathies.

    I am not entirely sure who Tinie Tempah is, but I suspect he may be some kind
    of homunculus, possibly malevolent.

    I hope this clears the matter up to your satisfaction.'
