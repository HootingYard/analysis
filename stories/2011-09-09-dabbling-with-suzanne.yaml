  text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I pioneer a new form of close textual analysis\
    \ of classic songs, starting with \u201CSuzanne\u201D by Leonard Cohen. And when\
    \ I say \u201Cclose\u201D, I mean close\u2014in my attempt to winkle out the deep\
    \ meaning of the song I concentrate on a single six-word phrase, jettisoning the\
    \ rest of it. And when I say \u201Cwinkle\u201D, well, as you will discover when\
    \ you pore over my piece, winkles and other hardy organic life-forms of the tide\
    \ pool have a crucial part to play in the heretofore hidden deep structure of\
    \ the song.\nOne unexpected advantage of my brain-numbing work was the realisation\
    \ that there is a connection, albeit tentative and tangential, with my concurrent\
    \ lobster research. I make no great claims for what we might call \u201Cthe Suzanne\
    \ lobster\u201D, but it suffices, I think, that the word \u201Clobsters\u201D\
    \ appears, not at all gratuitously, in my analysis.\nThese are hideously complicated\
    \ matters, but I hope I have been able to shed some little light on them."
