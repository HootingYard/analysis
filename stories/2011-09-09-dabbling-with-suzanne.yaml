    This week in The Dabbler I pioneer a new form of close textual analysis of classic
    songs, starting with "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen. And when I say "close", I mean
    close--in my attempt to winkle out the deep meaning of the song I concentrate
    on a single six-word phrase, jettisoning the rest of it. And when I say "winkle",
    well, as you will discover when you pore over my piece, winkles and other hardy
    organic life-forms of the tide pool have a crucial part to play in the heretofore
    hidden deep structure of the song.

    One unexpected advantage of my brain-numbing work was the realisation that there
    is a connection, albeit tentative and tangential, with my concurrent lobster research.
    I make no great claims for what we might call "the Suzanne lobster", but it suffices,
    I think, that the word "lobsters" appears, not at all gratuitously, in my analysis.

    These are hideously complicated matters, but I hope I have been able to shed some
    little light on them.'
