  text: "If a thing is made of chocolate, comes from Switzerland, and is shaped like\
    \ unto a roll, could it reasonably be anything other than a chocolate swiss roll?\n\
    So asks Atahualpa Tompkins in his runaway bestseller Mind-Bending Brain-Teasers\
    \ For The Cranial Integuments, a collection of hundreds of equally diverting thought\
    \ experiments. It's a fat book, as fat as the Bible, but not black like the Bible.\
    \ In fact its cover comes in a variety of hues, shades of Tompkins\u2019 own devising,\
    \ created from pigments unutterable.\nAnother of his food-and-drink-based quizzums\
    \ is:\nIf it looks like an egg, and has its own nog, why is it not an egg nog?\n\
    The best way to read this book is one question at a time. I found, in foolishly\
    \ trying to read a whole page-worth of queries at one sitting, that my brain overheated\
    \ and vapours hissed out of my ears and I had to go and lie flat on my back in\
    \ a pitch black room, pitch black like the Bible, for umpteen hours. \u201CUmpteen\u201D\
    , incidentally, is a number that crops up umpteen times in the book, for example\
    \ in this brain-teaser:\nIf a he-man tosses umpteen medicine balls into a waiting\
    \ bin, how big must the bin be to gather unto itself all those umpteen medicine\
    \ balls tossed into it by the he-man?\nYou can see what I mean about the overheating\
    \ and the vapours and the lying flat on one's back and the pitch black and the\
    \ Bible."
