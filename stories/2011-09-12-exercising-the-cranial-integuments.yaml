  text: 'If a thing is made of chocolate, comes from Switzerland, and is shaped like
    unto a roll, could it reasonably be anything other than a chocolate swiss roll?

    So asks Atahualpa Tompkins in his runaway bestseller Mind-Bending Brain-Teasers
    For The Cranial Integuments, a collection of hundreds of equally diverting thought
    experiments. It''s a fat book, as fat as the Bible, but not black like the Bible.
    In fact its cover comes in a variety of hues, shades of Tompkins'' own devising,
    created from pigments unutterable.

    Another of his food-and-drink-based quizzums is:

    If it looks like an egg, and has its own nog, why is it not an egg nog?

    The best way to read this book is one question at a time. I found, in foolishly
    trying to read a whole page-worth of queries at one sitting, that my brain overheated
    and vapours hissed out of my ears and I had to go and lie flat on my back in a
    pitch black room, pitch black like the Bible, for umpteen hours. "Umpteen", incidentally,
    is a number that crops up umpteen times in the book, for example in this brain-teaser:

    If a he-man tosses umpteen medicine balls into a waiting bin, how big must the
    bin be to gather unto itself all those umpteen medicine balls tossed into it by
    the he-man?

    You can see what I mean about the overheating and the vapours and the lying flat
    on one''s back and the pitch black and the Bible.'
