  text: "There was a delightful juxtaposition of words in the Grauniad cryptic crossword\
    \ a couple of weeks ago, where\u2014when solved\u2014one column down read FAIRY\
    \ STATIONER. This set me to thinking about fairies and their stationery. For one\
    \ wild moment I wondered if the Cottingley fairies had been affixed to their positions\
    \ with staples, given that Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths took their photographs\
    \ in 1917 and the home stapling machine had been patented by Henry Heyl forty\
    \ years before, in 1877. But then I slapped my forehead and remembered that of\
    \ course the girls had used hat-pins.\nWould a fairy have any use for staples\
    \ at all? Or, indeed, for any kind of stationery other than scented notepaper\
    \ and a ballpoint pen with which to write fairy messages to other fairies, and\
    \ to such humans as possess the gift, or curse, whichsoever it may be, of being\
    \ able to communicate with fairy folk? I can imagine these fey flighty bewinged\
    \ sprites perhaps using treasury tags to fasten together into a sprig the stalks\
    \ of daisies or campions or buttercups, but surely more robust stationery items\
    \ such as hole-punches would be too heavy for them to lift? Or is it the case\
    \ that fairies are deceptively strong, and can use their fairy powers to move,\
    \ if not mountains, then entire cartons of thick black heavy duty marker pens?\n\
    It would be intriguing, upon a ramble through a dingly dell, to stumble upon a\
    \ tiny little shop with a sign outside it saying FAIRY STATIONER, just as in the\
    \ crossword. Then one could crouch and poke one's head in the window and make\
    \ a quick visual inventory to ascertain which items of stationery are commonly\
    \ used by fairies, and which are not.\n\nThe Cottingley Fairies\_: hat-pins, not\
    \ staples"
