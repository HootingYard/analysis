  text: "Reading a couple of blog postages today led me to cast my mind back to the\
    \ heyday of nisbet spotting in the early nineteen-seventies. In The Dabbler, ZMKC\
    \ fondly recalls an absurd and pointless exchange of correspondence with a schoolfriend,\
    \ while BlackberryJuniper And Sherbet apologises (unnecessarily) that she is \u201C\
    thinking aloud about nothing in particular\u201D.\nAbsurdity, pointlessness and\
    \ \u201Cnothing in particular\u201D as one's subject matter all dovetail neatly\
    \ into the theory and practice of nisbet spotting. I earlier gave some account\
    \ of this exciting activity here. To recap, aged around ten or eleven, I created\
    \ a newspaper or magazine which purported to be the Official Journal of the Nisbet\
    \ Spotting Society. Written by hand, illustrated with drawings and collages, the\
    \ pages carefully stapled together\u2014though not with fairy staples\u2014the\
    \ contents of the Journal chronicled the failure of the Society's members ever\
    \ to spot a nisbet. Indeed, I made it a conscious point never to explain what\
    \ a nisbet was. I suppose it was my version of the Snark or the Boojum, though\
    \ I don't think I had read Carroll's \u201CAgony In Eight Fits\u201D at the time.\n\
    Did the nisbet even exist, or were those seeking to spot one on a futile quest?\
    \ We shall never know, for before I faced up to deciding one way or another, I\
    \ abandoned the Journal after five or six issues and discovered other enthusiasms.\
    \ I continued to write, though I don't remember what. Then soon enough I entered\
    \ the dread world of teendom, and became very serious and earnest, as teenpersons\
    \ will do, and my writing suffered accordingly. I had an important message for\
    \ the world, if only it would listen. It did not.\nIt took about ten years for\
    \ me to regain my mojo, and to realise that the absurdity and pointlessness and\
    \ \u201Cnothing\u201D of nisbet spotting showed the way forward. To a large extent,\
    \ everything I have written over the past quarter of a century, since the first\
    \ Malice Aforethought Press booklet in 1986, has been a sort of hommage to those\
    \ hapless enthusiasts of the Nisbet Spotting Society."
