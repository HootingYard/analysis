  text: 'I have often asked myself if I was born to boogie. Born to mewl and puke,
    yes. To scratch and gobble and preen, most certainly. And in the end, to kick
    the bucket, and feed the worms, or, wedged in my final box, ignited, to blaze
    in glory. But inbetweentimes, must I, can I, boogie? Was it writ in the stars,
    spread out across the firmament in their particular alignment at the moment of
    my birth, that I should boogie?

    Once, on a Wednesday I recall, I studied and studied a chart of those stars, but
    I learned nothing. Partly that was because I did not really know what I ought
    to be looking for, partly because the chart had been dropped in a puddle and was
    smudged. I gazed at it for hours on that Wednesday, hoping for enlightenment of
    a boogie-related kind, but eventually I gave up and crumpled the chart in my fist
    and tossed it into a dustbin.

    I was told, also on a Wednesday, but a different Wednesday, that to properly boogie
    one had to wear a boogie-hat and a shirt with boogie-cuffs and a pair of boogie
    shoes. But the person who told me this was unreliable, in matters boogie at any
    rate, for he had never, to the best of my knowledge, himself boogied. He just
    spouted off about boogie, one of those boogie-spouters who were so tiresomely
    prevalent at one time. Some people feel nostalgic for that time, of course, even
    weep when they think of it, but not me. I couldn''t give a monkey''s.

    It was another person who told me, and not on a Wednesday this time, but a Sunday,
    that if I wanted to witness proper boogie I should make a beeline for the monkey
    house. Apparently, monkeys boogie better than any other creature on earth. They
    truly were born to boogie. I am not sure this is the truth. I hoped to study a
    chart, not dissimilar to the chart o'' stars, but a chart of monkeys, one that
    had not been dropped into a puddle and smudged, but try as I might I could not
    get my mittens on one. The whole monkey boogie business is still up in the air
    as far as I am concerned. And I cannot quiz the person who told me to get me hence
    to the monkey house, for in a quite unrelated development, he was found hanging
    from a bridge over an important river, his pockets weighted with stones. They
    said he had boogie in his eyes at the last, but what in heaven''s name that might
    mean I have no idea.

    It has been pointed out to me, more than once, that had I been born to boogie
    I would have boogied by now. Well, frustum dustum, as they say, that is a persuasive
    point. If I started to boogie today, or next week, or in whatever years are left
    to me, would there not be something forced and artificial about my boogie, a knowingness
    that would be fatal to the boogie itself? Thereagain, some have posited the idea
    of the past-it boogie, or the creaking wizened boogie, as not uncommon variations
    on the classic boogie, which I suppose might be defined as the boogie practised
    by monkeys, if indeed monkeys do actually boogie, and I was not being lied to,
    yet again.

    I shall retrieve that smudged star-chart from the dustbin, and hop it down to
    the monkey house, and perhaps, perhaps, things will become clear to me, at least
    in terms of boogie.'
