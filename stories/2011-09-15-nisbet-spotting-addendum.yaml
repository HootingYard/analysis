  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, I read yesterday's piece about nisbet\
    \ spotting and put two and two together. I think the \u201Chapless enthusiasts\u201D\
    \ of the Nisbet Spotting Society were seeking high and low for that odd being\
    \ depicted in the Hooting Yard \u201Cimplausible\u201D emblem, as shown in the\
    \ heading of your website and on those fetching lapel accoutrements. My unpaid\
    \ intern research assistants tell me that the emblem first appeared, in black\
    \ and white, on the cover of an edition of the ReR Quarterly magazine in the late\
    \ 1980s, cheek by jowl with several other emblems. If this is the case, then in\
    \ terms of simple chronology it would have been impossible for nisbet spotters\
    \ of the early 1970s to spot it, as it did not yet exist. Had you had a bit of\
    \ stamina and kept up regular production of the Official Journal of the Nisbet\
    \ Spotting Society, those hapless enthusiasts would not, with the passing of time,\
    \ have been quite so hapless. Yours indefatigably, Dr Ruth Pastry.\n\nDr Pastry\
    \ is correct about the provenance of the emblem. If any reader has a copy of the\
    \ magazine in question, perhaps they would be good enough to scan both front and\
    \ back covers and send them to Mr Key. On the question of whether or not the \u201C\
    odd being\u201D is indeed a nisbet, I think it best to reserve judgement until\
    \ a panel of experts has been empanelled to consider the matter with due diligence."
