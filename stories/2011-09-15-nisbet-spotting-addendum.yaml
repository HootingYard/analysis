  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, I read yesterday''s piece about nisbet
    spotting and put two and two together. I think the "hapless enthusiasts" of the
    Nisbet Spotting Society were seeking high and low for that odd being depicted
    in the Hooting Yard "implausible" emblem, as shown in the heading of your website
    and on those fetching lapel accoutrements. My unpaid intern research assistants
    tell me that the emblem first appeared, in black and white, on the cover of an
    edition of the ReR Quarterly magazine in the late 1980s, cheek by jowl with several
    other emblems. If this is the case, then in terms of simple chronology it would
    have been impossible for nisbet spotters of the early 1970s to spot it, as it
    did not yet exist. Had you had a bit of stamina and kept up regular production
    of the Official Journal of the Nisbet Spotting Society, those hapless enthusiasts
    would not, with the passing of time, have been quite so hapless. Yours indefatigably,
    Dr Ruth Pastry.


    Dr Pastry is correct about the provenance of the emblem. If any reader has a copy
    of the magazine in question, perhaps they would be good enough to scan both front
    and back covers and send them to Mr Key. On the question of whether or not the
    "odd being" is indeed a nisbet, I think it best to reserve judgement until a panel
    of experts has been empanelled to consider the matter with due diligence.'
