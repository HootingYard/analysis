    Here are some flappers:


    You can read about one particular flapper, and a criminal flapper at that, in
    my cupboard this week at The Dabbler. The flapper is accompanied in my tale by
    a chump (unillustrated).

    Ray Bradbury wrote a famous collection of short stories called The Illustrated
    Man (1951), made into a film (1969) starring Rod Steiger (1925-2002). Were Mr
    Steiger still with us, I think I would write to him suggesting he play a character
    called The Unillustrated Chump. This would not be an adaptation of The Chump And
    The Flapper, the story in today''s Dabbler, but a wholly different work, based
    on the boiling frustrations of a chump who, try as he might, cannot get his likeness
    depicted by a single illustrator. Mr Steiger did boiling frustration very well,
    and though he may have had difficulty playing a chump--for he was the most unchumpish
    of men--his training in the Method would no doubt have stood him in good stead.
    Alas, it is not to be.'
