  text: 'Madam Galvani observed convulsions in a dead frog, which laid near an electrical
    machine which was in action. Although there is a diversity of information as to
    whether it was she or a student who noticed the incident first. As she is said
    to have been an invalid, and the frogs were for her benefit, it is more than likely
    she had an eye on them, and it would not be strange if they both saw the convulsions
    at the same time. However, the subject was investigated by Dr. Galvani, who was
    a Professor of Anatomy, and they found that. a knife touched the frog, and that
    when a metallic substance in contact with a nerve of the creature, was brought
    within the action of the electrical machine, there followed a twitching of the
    limb. And since that time a great many discoveries have been made about all this,
    and a machine constructed, called the Galvanic Battery; the principle of it, being
    that when two metals are connected by some substance capable of exciting their
    different electricities, similar effects to these described may be observed. Charges
    from the battery will occasion contortions and violent jerkings in dead corpses,
    which are rather horrible to witness. After the skin has been removed from the
    hind legs of frogs and some salt sprinkled over them, (while they are raw of course),
    the legs will quiver and jerk in a curious manner, occasioned by the action of
    the salt upon them. It is likely that Madam Galvani was going to have the frogs
    for her dinner. They have a taste between fish and chicken; you broil them over
    the fire, and then put a little sprinkle of salt, and the least dust of pepper,
    if any at all, then you will have delicious morsels. It is not necessary to cook
    them out of doors; building fires is a dangerous employment for children, and
    if you ever have any, bring them into the kitchen, and do the cooking there, where
    you can get help if you should need it. A word more about that pepper. Pepper,
    spice and other irritants, should be used with caution, if used at all, for the
    effect of them is to excite the coating of the stomach, and lead eventually to
    disease. In concluding about the battery alluded to, it is capable of producing
    great quantities of electricity; there is a positive pole and a negative pole,--the
    positive pole attracts a negative pole, and a negative pole attracts a positive
    pole. These terms, positive and negative, express different quantities of the
    fluid, positive being more, and the negative less. The term pole, in this connection,
    meaning point; point of concentration. Exactly how the metals are arranged in
    a pile, and the vessels with acid and water, and so on, are adjusted, is explained
    in works on the subject. We have learned so much of the ways of electricity, that
    we cannot be surprised as our predecessors were, even if dead bodies jerk and
    thump around. They have, by tracing remarkable phenomena, which astonished them,
    elucidated them and placed them where they belong, under and within this property
    of matter.

    from Properties And Powers In Every-Day Matters by A Corey (1876), as noted in
    Odd Books : A Safe House For Literary Misfits, which is highly recommended.'
