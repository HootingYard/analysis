  text: "In The Invention Of Murder\_: How The Victorians Revelled In Death And Detection\
    \ And Created Modern Crime (2011), Judith Flanders makes a passing reference which,\
    \ though brief, has me eager to read the novel in question:\nIn 1860, in The Trail\
    \ Of The Serpent, Mrs Braddon had advanced her plot through Sloshy, the adopted\
    \ child of a mute policeman\nCome to think of it, I may not bother to read the\
    \ book itself, but simply adopt the characters for my own use. Sloshy! The mute\
    \ policeman! They shall live again at Hooting Yard!"
