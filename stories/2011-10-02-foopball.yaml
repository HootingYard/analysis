  text: 'Twice in the season, incidentally, I saw West Ham (The Hammers) in opposition
    to Sheffield Wednesday (The Owls), a fixture I found too rich in unfortunate imagery.
    I didn''t mind foxes beating magpies, or gunners beating spurs, but the idea of
    owls being beaten by hammers still affects me to this day.
