  text: "\nMethod acting comes under the spotlight in my cupboard at The Dabbler this\
    \ week, and I thought it would be interesting to write the piece using the technique\
    \ of Method writing. The idea is to induce in oneself a state of mind where the\
    \ only \u201Cwriting\u201D which exists is the tracks of birds in snow\u2014marks\
    \ that are at once meaningless yet numinous. In this state, \u201Cliterature\u201D\
    \ has yet to come into being. Prose has to be invented anew. It is as if one were\
    \ Jeanette Winterson!\nTo get the hang of the momentous task before you, it is\
    \ a good idea to make a copy of the bird-tracks in the snow, for they are fugitive,\
    \ and when the snow melts, they will vanish forever. Go to a stationery shop or\
    \ a post office, and buy a pen and paper. When choosing a pen, say of the ballpoint\
    \ variety, make sure the tip is about the size of the primitive ganglia which\
    \ constitute the brain of a lobster.\nOut in the field, learn how to make marks,\
    \ with the pen upon the paper, which match precisely the patterns made by the\
    \ tracks of birds in the snow. This is the beginning of writing! Back at home,\
    \ sat at an escritoire, continue making such marks, but rather than mere copying\
    \ allow yourself free rein. Sooner or later, you will discover that the marks\
    \ you are making will, as if by a miracle, form literate prose!"
