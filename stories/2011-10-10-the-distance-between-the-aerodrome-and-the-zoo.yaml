  text: 'Please note that the distance between the aerodrome and the zoo is very great.
    It is recommended that you wear a pair of stout hiking boots. When disembarking
    from the aeroplane, beware of propellers! Try to remain unruffled when presenting
    your bags for inspection at the customs shed. May the Lord have mercy on your
    soul.

    Oops! I forgot to mention that before landing, be sure to pluck the hairs from
    your chinny chin chin. The regime has grave suspicions about men with beards,
    and not with reason. The King has spoken, and that is enough.

    There are twenty-four points of interest between the aerodrome and the zoo, and
    I wish I could say that they were arranged alphabetically. In a better-ordered
    Kingdom, they would be. Alas, the designation of the points of interest fell to
    a Ministry stuffed with illiterates, rough brutes for the most part, but those
    who found favour with the King through mighty feats of arms. That is why there
    is a martial aspect to over half the points of interest, meaning that they may
    not be everybody''s cup of tea. There will be enforced stops, however, en route.

    At each point of interest along the way you will find a kiosk where refreshments
    may be obtained. Be warned that prices are subject to galloping inflation, so
    anything I told you now would almost certainly be out of date by the time you
    embark upon the holiday of a lifetime.

    It is, sadly, impossible to get from the aerodrome to the zoo without having to
    make a crossing of the harsh and inhospitable glinka. Everything you have heard
    about the glinka is true. You will need some kind of protective clothing against
    the wind. There are creatures in the wind, you will hear the sound of mandolins,
    and you will want to cling to your darling, for wild is the wind. If your darling
    is not accompanying you, more''s the pity.

    You will need a pre-stamped ticket to enter the zoo, if you are not torn apart
    by wolves before you get there. The sentries are chosen for their acuity of vision,
    and can spot a counterfeit ticket at fifty paces, so do not even think of trying
    to bluff your way through the magnificent iron gates with a forgery. To labour
    the point, you will see heads on spikes, their eyes pecked out by birds, all around
    the perimeter.

    No holiday would be complete without a sprint around the perimeter of the zoo,
    incidentally. You may wish to replace your stout hiking boots with a pair of plimsolls.
    The King''s Marshals will be on hand to harry you and hector you, with their pointy
    lances and their guttural shrieks.

    The King''s cartographers are working hard on an approved route back from the
    zoo to the aerodrome. Thus far they have not come up with an officially sanctioned
    itinerary, so there are several holding camps, with rudimentary ersatz-canvas
    tents and barbed wire in place next to the bog on the far side of the zoo.'
