  text: "Max said, \u201CDon't you ever feel inspired to paint the Finnish countryside\
    \ in summer?\u201D\n\u201CIt's all so damned green,\u201D she answered.\nThen\
    \ she told us about the squirrel, the one squirrel which has appeared on the island;\
    \ and it slept under her neck and tried to collect food there. As the relationship\
    \ between artist and squirrel developed, the squirrel came to expect a game at\
    \ four o\u2019 clock in the morning. Tove Jansson had to get out of bed and pretend\
    \ to be a tree. The squirrel would run up and down her frozen limbs.\nOswell Blakeston,\
    \ Sun At Midnight (1958)"
