  text: 'Luna Park, the Linnanmaki [in Helsinki] ... is high above the city on a granite
    outcrop with a water-tower that looks like a stone gasometer with trees growing
    on top, and which is circled with lights... One side-show, to judge by the pictures
    outside, was a house in which people are attacked by bees.

    Oswell Blakeston, Sun At Midnight (1958)'
