    \ on a granite outcrop with a water-tower that looks like a stone gasometer with\
    \ trees growing on top, and which is circled with lights\u2026 One side-show,\
    \ to judge by the pictures outside, was a house in which people are attacked by\
    \ bees.\nOswell Blakeston, Sun At Midnight (1958)"
