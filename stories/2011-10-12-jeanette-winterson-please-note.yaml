  text: 'If you wish to become weak-headed, nervous, and good for nothing, read novels.
    I have seen an account of a young lady, who had become so nervous and excitable,
    in consequence of reading novels, that her head would be turned by the least appearance
    of danger, real or imaginary. As she was riding in a carriage over a bridge, in
    company with her mother and sister, she became frightened at some fancied danger,
    caught hold of the reins, and backed the carriage off the bridge, down a precipice,
    dashing them to pieces.
