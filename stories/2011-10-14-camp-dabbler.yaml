  text: "\nIf, like me, you intend to spend the autumn in the great outdoors, entented\
    \ at Camp Dabbler, be sure to read the by no means exhaustive list of Victorian\
    \ camping gear stowed in my cupboard this week.\nUseful as the list is, it raises\
    \ a number of questions. The following puzzlers spring to mind, though I have\
    \ not yet been able to come up with answers.\nWhich version of the Bible is best\
    \ suited for a camping trip?\nHow many boxes should one pack, and of what kind?\n\
    Which is the most effective oil to apply to one's Brogans?\nWhy is the harness\
    \ the sole item on the list which one should examine, presumably before the start\
    \ of the camping trip? Are we to assume that all the other things can be shoved\
    \ willy nilly into one's camping pantechnicon without them being given the once\
    \ over with a gimlet eye?\n\u201CMeal (in bag). Meal-bag.\u201D Does this mean\
    \ the properly prepared camper should take two meal-bags, one containing meal\
    \ and one empty? Or is the repetition designed to hammer the point home for the\
    \ camping dunderpate, much as one hammers home the pegs of the dunderpate's tent?\n\
    Regarding pens, should one take ballpoints (with tips about the size of a lobster's\
    \ brain) or thick black magic markers, or fountain pens, or indeed swans?\nNo\
    \ particular song-book is recommended, and it would be helpful to have some idea\
    \ of the kind of songs one might be expected to sing while hunched around the\
    \ fire at Camp Dabbler.\nIf any readers can help out with these, or other camping-related\
    \ questions thrown up by the list, please use the Comments facility."
