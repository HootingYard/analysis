  text: "Here at Hooting Yard we are regularly inundated with queries relating to\
    \ eggs. Here, for example, is a plaintive plea from reader Tim Thurn:\nQ\u2014\
    When you are dining with an intimate friend, and an omelette au rhum is served,\
    \ what do you do?\nMy spies tell me that Tim has copied out this question from\
    \ Rambles In Womanland by Max O'Rell (1903), wherein the answer is given thus:\n\
    A\u2014Without any ceremony, you take a spoon, and, taking the burning liquid,\
    \ you pour it over the dish gently and unceasingly. If you are careless, and fail\
    \ to keep the pink and blue flame alive, it goes out at once, and you have to\
    \ eat, instead of a delicacy, a dish fit only for people who like, or are used\
    \ to have, their palates scraped by rough food. If you would be sure to be successful,\
    \ you will ask your friend to help you watch the flame, and you will even ask\
    \ him to lift the omelette gently so that the rhum may be poured all over it until\
    \ the whole of the alcohol contained in the liquor is burned out.\nI might add\
    \ that taking a spoon without any ceremony is easier said than done, but my remarks\
    \ on that will have to wait for our series on spoons and ceremonies, which is\
    \ forthcoming."
