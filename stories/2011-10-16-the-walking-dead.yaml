    Now that the second series of apocalyptic zombie drama The Walking Dead hits the
    TV screens, I consider it my duty to inform Hooting Yard readers of an important
    fact. Lead actor Andrew Lincoln, pictured above in the guise of his character,
    sheriff''s deputy Rick Grimes, is the son-in-law of Jethro Tull luminary Ian Anderson.

    I hope the scriptwriters have taken inspiration from the family connection. In
    a future episode I shall expect to see a flute-playing zombie standing on one
    leg.'
