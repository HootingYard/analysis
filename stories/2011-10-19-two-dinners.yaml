    a list of the grub rustled up by the Merchant Taylors'' Company to welcome Prince
    Henry into their ranks in the summer of 1607:

    Swans, godwit, shovellers, partridges, owls, cuckoos, ringdoves, pullets, ducklings,
    teal, peacocks, rabbits, leverets and a great turkey... along with 1,300 eggs,
    three great lobsters and 200 prawns, salmon, salt fish, plaice, sole, dory, carp
    and tenches, sirloins and ribs of beef, mutton and lambs'' dowsets, neats'' tongues
    and sweet breads, and to conclude the evening, figs, dates, prunes, currants,
    almonds, strawberries, gooseberries, cherries, pears, apples, damsons, oranges
    and quinces. Twenty-eight barrels of beer were provided to slake the diners''
    thirst, together with more than 440 gallons of wine.

    The dinner began with a soup of asps in simmering oil. On each side was a dish
    of vegetables, one containing thistles and burdocks, and the other fuming acid.
    Other side dishes, of turtles, rats, bats and moles, were garnished with live
    coals. For the fish course he ate a dish of snakes in boiling tar and pitch. His
    roast was a screech owl in a sauce of glowing brimstone. The salad proved to be
    spider webs full of small explosive squibs, a plate of butterfly wings and manna
    worms, a dish of toads surrounded with flies, crickets, grasshoppers, church beetles,
    spiders, and caterpillars. He washed all this down with flaming brandy, and for
    dessert ate the four large candles standing on the table, both of the hanging
    side lamps with their contents, and finally the large center lamp, oil, wick and
    all. This leaving the room in darkness, Dufour''s face shone out in a mask of
    living flames.
