    \ tonight and has no idea what records to play, asking for tips on what \u201C\
    the kids\u201D are listening to these days.\nI replied: \u201CIt's not what the\
    \ kids are listening to, it's what they should be made to listen to. I recommend\
    \ Scriabin's \u2018Poem Of Ecstasy\u2019, Op.54.\u201D\n\nScriabin\_: tiny little\
