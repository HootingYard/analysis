  text: 'A friend of mine posted a Facebook Facecloth message, saying she is DJing
    tonight and has no idea what records to play, asking for tips on what "the kids"
    are listening to these days.

    I replied: "It''s not what the kids are listening to, it''s what they should be
    made to listen to. I recommend Scriabin''s ''Poem Of Ecstasy'', Op.54."
