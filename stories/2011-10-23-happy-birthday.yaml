  text: 'This morning, at nine o'' clock, I celebrated Adam''s birthday, for as we
    know

    In the seventeenth century, in his great work, Dr. John Lightfoot, Vice-Chancellor
    of the University of Cambridge, and one of the most eminent Hebrew scholars of
    his time, declared, as the result of his most profound and exhaustive study of
    the Scriptures, that "heaven and earth, centre and circumference, were created
    all together, in the same instant, and clouds full of water," and that "this work
    took place and man was created by the Trinity on October 23, 4004 B.C., at nine
    of the clock in the morning

    or so said Andrew Dickson White in A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology
    in Christendom (1896). It has been suggested that White was rather selectively
    quoting Lightfoot, and there are arguments to be had. But let us not get into
    a kerfuffle about it. Clearly the important thing is that God knew what time it
    was, on what day, in what month, of what year. Being majestic and subtle and ineffable,
    He did not proclaim the beginning of all things as "Year Zero", as the tiresomely
    literal-minded Pol Pot did, in spite of a French university education. I think
    we can all be grateful that the universe, with all its kinks and crooked timbers,
    was created by a mischievous beardy rascal and not by that Cambodian psychopath.'
