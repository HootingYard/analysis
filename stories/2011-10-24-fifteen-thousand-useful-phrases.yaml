  text: 'Let me tell you how Hooting Yard prose comes to be written, and explain how
    this is due to change.

    As some of you will know, because I have bashed on about it before, probably,
    the current practice is, and always has been, for me to enter into a state of
    heightened consciousness and to wrench, manfully, from the very inner core of
    the depths of my immortal soul, majestic sweeping paragraphs of prose. It is tough
    and unrewarding work, and harrowing! harrowing!, but it is both my duty and my
    destiny, as was writ in the stars, those glittering blobs of impossibly distant
    burning rock spread out against the firmament.

    Such spiritual exertions take their toll, so I am pleased that in future the generation
    of Hooting Yard prose will no longer be so harrowing!, harrowing! Why so?, you
    ask. Well, thanks to Glyn Webster, Hooting Yard Research Fellow and janitor of
    The Pavilion of Innocent Pastimes, I have had drawn to my attention the majestic
    Fifteen Thousand Useful Phrases : A Practical Handbook Of Pertinent Expressions,
    Striking Similes, Literary. Commercial, Conversational, And Oratorical Terms,
    For The Embellishment Of Speech And Literature, And The Improvement Of The Vocabulary
    Of Those Persons Who Read, Write. And Speak English by Grenville Kleiser, originally
    published in 1917. Now, all I need do is pluck a selection of phrases, jam them
    together, chuck in the occasional proper name or contextual setting, and foof-la!,
    entire paragraphs of mighty prose are ready for your perusal and brain-numbing
    study.

    You may recall that you have Mr Webster to thank for the conversion of the 2003-2006
    Hooting Yard material into an indexed, fully searchable archive. In keeping with
    his technowhizzery, he has created a machine-readable version of Grenville Kleiser''s
    invaluable resource-the Phraseological Supercollider--so one does not even have
    to pick one''s own crop from those fifteen thousand phrases. His very first experiment
    delivered this passage:

    Happily for us, his face caught the full strength of the rising wind. The pith
    and sinew of mature manhood, the loud and urgent pageantry of the day, impalpable
    nothingness. I have acquired some useful experience. Delude not yourselves with
    the belief, awed devotion, sombre relations. I very rarely allow myself that pleasure.

    Shove in a "Dobson" or a "fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol" or an "in Pointy Town",
    and you''re laughing.

    Further tweaks to what I think we should call the Webster-Kleiser Phraseological
    Supercollider will enable us to, for example, randomly recombine the adjective-noun
    pairs of Kleiser''s "Useful Phrases". Again, the initial test of this module came
    up with extremely helpful "new" useful phrases such as "interpretative farce",
    "noonday plundering" and "restricted cudgelling".

    It occurs to me that, having revealed to you the existence of Fifteen Thousand
    Useful Phrases, I could leave you to get on with it, creating your very own majestic
    sweeping paragraphs, while I retire to a dilapidated seaside resort, there to
    suck on an ice lolly and be buffeted by squalls. We shall see.'
