  text: 'Appended to The Dabbler review of a history of the Ordnance Survey, a comment
    from Jonathon Green to serve as a warning to surveyors, geometers, and cartographers
    everywhere:

    My favourite, if tragic cartographical story is retailed by Graham Robb in The
    Discovery of France (2007). It tells how a young geometer, employed in surveying
    a country that was still highly localised and almost wholly unmapped, arrived
    in the village of Les Estables, some forty miles (and about 400 years) away from
    Lyons. The villagers, simple peasant folk with their simple peasant ways and beliefs,
    assumed that this outsider, never seen in their village, must therefore be a herald
    of Satan. They hacked him to pieces.'
