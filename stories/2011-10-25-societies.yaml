  text: "The Evangelicals\u2019 far-flung humanitarian concerns prompted them to found\
    \ literally hundreds of philanthropic and missionary organisations, some with\
    \ dense networks of local branches and committees reaching across the country.\
    \ The diversity of these causes, as well as their individual limitations, may\
    \ be inferred from this small selection of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century\
    \ societies, some of whose titles are as long as their constitutions:\nThe Ladies\u2019\
    \ Association for the Benefit of Gentlewomen of Good Family, Reduced in Fortune\
    \ Below the State of Comfort To Which They Have Been Accustomed;\nThe Friendly\
    \ Female Society, for the Relief of Poor, Infirm, Aged Widows, and Single Women,\
    \ of Good Character, Who Have Seen Better Days;\nThe Guardian Society, for the\
    \ Preservation of Public Morals by Providing Temporary Asylums for Prostitutes;\n\
    The London Orphan Asylum, for the Reception and Education of Destitute Orphans,\
    \ Particularly Those Descended from Respectable Parents;\nThe National Truss Society\
    \ for the Relief of the Ruptured Poor;\nThe Society for Returning Young Women\
    \ to their Friends in the Country;\nand the Royal Humane Society (to restore \u201C\
    persons in a state of suspended animation\u201D).\nSeemingly, the Evangelicals\
    \ had a society to cover every contingency.\nRichard D Altick, Victorian People\
