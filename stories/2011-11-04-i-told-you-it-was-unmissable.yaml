  text: 'Word reaches me that there may be one or two Hooting Yard readers who may
    not be attending the Evening of Lugubrious Music and Lopsided Prose at Woolfson
    & Tay bookshop in precisely two weeks'' time. I find this hard to believe. However,
    in the unlikely event that there is a grain of truth in it, I suspect these benighted
    souls will realise the error of their ways when they discover just what they will
    be missing. Not just Mr Key babbling while dressed in the kind of jacket worn
    by Christopher Plummer in The Sound Of Music (Robert Wise, 1965), but the encaped
    Outa_Spaceman making the world a better place through the medium of song.

    And what songs! Here, as a spur to persuade anyone foolish enough not to have
    yet bought a ticket, is Outa_Spaceman performing his setting of The Pavilion By
    The Shore. I reproduce the words below, so you can all sing along:

    Pavilion By The Shore

    There is a pavilion by the shore. I do not go there any more. I used to visit
    every day on my clomping horse with its rattling dray, and I''d hammer my fists
    upon the door of the pavilion set beside the shore, but I do not go there any
    more. I cannot go there any more.

    I used to clomp along the lane lined by beech and larch and plane, but something
    went wrong in my brain and now I languish in the drain.

    I languish in a drainage ditch. I''m smeared with grease and tar and pitch. I''ve
    lost the use of my lower limbs and at the mercy of vermin''s whims.

    All sorts of vermin suck my blood as I lie sprawling in the mud, and others gnaw
    my skin and bones while I groan my dramatic groans.

    Above me, a hot air balloon will be arriving very soon. I''ll be winched up by
    a length of rope, and washed with disinfectant soap.

    The balloonist will sing rousing hymns to cure my withered lower limbs, and we''ll
    hover in the boundless sky eating a snack of lemon meringue pie.

    Then I''ll be dumped back on the lane, a few tweaks putting right my brain, and
    then I shall return once more to the bright pavilion by the shore.

    I''m sure there''s something, before I go, that you are very keen to know. The
    balloonist''s name--don''t be a clot! It was Tiny Enid, the heroic tot!'
