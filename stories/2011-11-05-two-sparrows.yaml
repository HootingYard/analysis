  text: 'We take as our text for today''s lesson the Gospel of Matthew, chapter ten,
    verse twenty-nine:

    Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the
    ground without your Father.

    Sometimes it so happens that you will go to a sparrow-seller to make purchase
    of a pair of sparrows, only for him to state an asking price of more than a farthing.
    Or he might charge a farthing for a single sparrow, but throw in a second sparrow
    with a "Buy One, Get One Free" offer, in which case you will pay a farthing for
    two sparrows even if the one sparrow costs a farthing in itself. Thereagain, you
    might find yourself being offered a free sparrow by a seller of, say, partridges
    or linnets, who has an unwanted stock of sparrows and cannot wait to be rid of
    them, for they are greedily eating up his grain and millet that he would rather
    feed to his partridges or linnets.

    So when we ask the question, as we must, are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?,
    the answer is no, not always, not in all circumstances, come what may, for there
    may be times and places where we will be asked to pay more, or less, for a pair
    of sparrows. And from this we can learn much about the ways of God and Man. Yes,
    the honest sparrow-seller will hand us two sparrows upon receipt of a farthing,
    but not all sparrow-sellers are honest, while some sparrow-sellers are too honest
    for their own good. And, as with sparrow-sellers, so too those from whom we buy
    other birds, not just partridges and linnets, but starlings, and kittiwakes, and
    seagulls.

    But what of the second part of the verse from Matthew 10, that one of them--that
    is, the sparrows--that one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father?
    The first part of the verse is a question. The second part is not. It states,
    quite vehemently and unchallengeably, that, without your Father, one of the sparrows
    will not fall on the ground. But which of the sparrows is it that shall not fall?
    One of them will, and one of them will remain in the air, in flight and birdy
    swooping, until your Father appears, at which point, we must assume, it will plunge
    towards the earth, just because your Father has arrived.

    The more one studies this passage, and I have studied it for years and years,
    the more problems it raises. Why does one sparrow fall on the ground without your
    Father? Why does the other sparrow fall on the ground when your Father appears?
    Is your Father armed with a shotgun, or a catapult? Does His mere presence induce
    in the tiny frail sparrow a heart attack? And if He can have that effect on a
    sparrow, what of other birds, partridges, say, or linnets, or starlings or kittiwakes
    or seagulls or robins or wrens, or even hummingbirds?

    These are profound questions, and we must dig deep to answer them, deeper, certainly,
    than a sparrow may need to dig to light upon a fat juicy earthworm for its morning
    snack. My own experience has taught me that all that digging will be as naught
    unless one has first found a sparrow-seller to sell one a pair of sparrows for
    a farthing. Alas, in this day and age, more leaden than golden, such sparrow-sellers
    are rare indeed, rarer even than the proverbial hen''s teeth. But the hen is quite
    another class of bird from a sparrow, as you will know if you have ever kept poultry.
    Thus sayeth the Lord.'
