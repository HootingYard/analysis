  text: "When the nights are drawing in, it is time for parlour games. Whereas in\
    \ the summer you might spend your evenings going for long hikes before or after\
    \ supper, roaming the hills and the moors, as autumn descends you will want to\
    \ close the shutters and gather round a blazing fire, pater and mater familias\
    \ and your bewildering number of tinies. And on such evenings, even reading aloud\
    \ lengthy passages from the Bible can pall, so you will want other resources,\
    \ and what could be better than a diverting parlour game?\nTo play Poop Or Orlop?\
    \ (sometimes known as Orlop Or Poop?) all you need is a supply of cardboard and\
    \ some string and some glue. One member of the family is designated as the \u201C\
    Admiral\u201D (if you are upper class), the \u201CCaptain\u201D (if you are middle\
    \ class) or the \u201CSkipper\u201D (if you are working class). Everyone else\
    \ leaves the parlour and gathers crammed in the pantry for an hour or so. The\
    \ \u201CAdmiral\u201D or \u201CCaptain\u201D or \u201CSkipper\u201D uses this\
    \ time, and the cardboard and the string and the glue, to transform the parlour\
    \ into a nautically-accurate poop or orlop deck.\nWhen the rest of the family\
    \ returns from the pantry, each in turn must use skill, judgement, and knowledge\
    \ of ship construction to declare whether the parlour is now a poop deck or an\
    \ orlop deck. Those who decide correctly are treated to a \u201Cfeast at the captain's\
    \ table\u201D, that is, they are each allowed to go back to the pantry and choose\
    \ a snack from among the snack items on the pantry shelves. Those who decide incorrectly\
    \ are \u201Ctossed into the sea\u201D, that is, they must clamber out of the open\
    \ window and wait shivering in the garden until the next round.\nThe \u201CAdmiral\u201D\
    \ or \u201CCaptain\u201D or \u201CSkipper\u201D then dismantles the cardboard\
    \ and string and glue poop or orlop deck and returns the parlour to its pristine\
    \ condition. The winners come back from the pantry stuffed with sausages or pies\
    \ or fruit, and the losers climb back in through the window, and someone else\
    \ is designated as the \u201CAdmiral\u201D or \u201CCaptain\u201D or \u201CSkipper\u201D\
    \ and the game begins again."
