  text: "The text of today's lesson is taken from Fingers by Oswell Blakeston, Chapter\
    \ 4, Paragraph 16:\nHe glanced at Sir Richard Dickie, in fear that the bird might\
    \ have changed into a charging ostrich of fire.\nHow common is it that, behind\
    \ our backs, when we are not looking, a cage-bird, such as a budgerigar or a canary,\
    \ turns into a charging ostrich of fire?\nIn all honesty, the answer must be \u201C\
    very rarely\u201D or \u201CI have never known such a thing to happen, in all my\
    \ days\u201D. For one thing, those who know their ornithology will know that the\
    \ ostrich is a much larger bird than either the budgerigar or the canary, and\
    \ would not fit into the average domestic birdcage. Thus, if by magic, some comparatively\
    \ tiny cage-bird transformed itself into an ostrich, it would do itself a mischief,\
    \ break some bones, and possibly even be suffocated as it became an ostrich, confined\
    \ within a cage too small to hold it.\nAgainst this, one could argue two things.\
    \ If the cage was constructed from flimsy materials, it might be that the burgeoning\
    \ ostrich would simply cause the birdcage to fall to bits around it as it expanded\
    \ in size from budgerigar or canary to full ostrichdom. Or, bear in mind that\
    \ Blakeston specifically describes an ostrich of fire. Would not the enflamed\
    \ and blazing bird burn the cage to cinders as it underwent its transformation?\n\
    Thus, however unlikely the event, we must concede its possibility. But what would\
    \ cause an ostrich to burst into flame? If anything, such a fate is more likely\
    \ to visit a canary, for once upon a time canaries in their thousands perched\
    \ in cages hung from the rafters of coal mines, to act as detectors of noxious\
    \ fumes and gases. If the miners did not notice that a canary had choked on escaping\
    \ gas and toppled from its perch, or indeed even if they did notice, an explosion\
    \ might occur in the mine and the canary be consumed by fire.\nOstriches, being\
    \ so much bigger than canaries, would prove an impediment to miners down a pit,\
    \ so one cannot imagine them facing the same awful fiery death as the tinier birds.\
    \ But then consider the ostrich's notorious tendency to swallow the most unlikely\
    \ of materials. One twentieth-century ostrich, for example, was found to have\
    \ ingested a lace handkerchief, a buttoned glove, a length of rope, a plain handkerchief\
    \ (probably a man's), assorted copper coins, metal tacks, staples and hooks, and\
    \ a four-inch nail. With that kind of diet, one can well imagine the addition\
    \ of combustible items, and an agency of combustion.\nSo we see, too, that the\
    \ idea of an ostrich of fire is not so far-fetched. As for its charging, that\
    \ would be a perfectly instinctual reaction to a bird finding itself aflame. Whether\
    \ it would find a pond or lake in which to douse and extinguish the flames in\
    \ the kind of domestic parlour in which Oswell Blakeston's cage-bird Sir Richard\
    \ Dickie finds itself is another matter entirely. Though I suppose one can imagine\
    \ it charging out of the parlour and into the kitchen, towards the kitchen sink,\
    \ or up the staircase and into the bathroom, towards the bath. Then it would have\
    \ to hope that the kitchen sink or the bath were full of standing water, for I\
    \ am not sure ostriches, which are reportedly particularly stupid birds, would\
    \ have the wherewithal to insert the plug in the plughole and turn on the taps,\
    \ with their talons.\nThus we can see that having resolved some of the difficulties\
    \ posed by the passage, we are not wholly in the clear. There remain insoluble\
    \ problems. As, perhaps, in life, there ever will be. Let us now sing a hymn."
