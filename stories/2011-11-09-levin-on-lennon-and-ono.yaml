  text: 'Most celebrated of all the experimenters in other-worldly ways of life were
    some of [the] Beatles, one of whom, towards the end of the decade, caused great
    offence to many by going to bed in public with his new bride, a Japanese lady
    who was variously described as a sculptress and a film-maker, though none could
    remember seeing any sculpture by her, and the only film she was known to have
    made consisted entirely of shots of naked buttocks moving, with more or less grace,
    away from the camera. Mr and Mrs John Lennon, then, having been married, elected
    to spend their honeymoon entirely in bed, a custom which was, after all, not entirely
    original. What made their honeymoon different from most is that it was spent in
    conditions of extreme public exposure, in a suite at the Hilton Hotel, Amsterdam,
    to which reporters, interviewers, newspaper and television photographers and other
    interested parties were free to come, and in suitable cases invited to join them
    in the bed, and there celebrate with the loving couple what was supposed to be
    the point of the entire proceedings, to wit a demonstration on behalf of personal
    and international peace. To this end, the walls of the bedroom were decorated
    with signs saying ''Bed Peace'', ''Hair Peace'', ''Stay in Bed'' and ''Grow Your
    Hair'', and the peaceful two argued, reasonably enough, that if everyone stayed
    in bed, occupying themselves in growing their hair, there would be no wars. To
    the question, what would happen if most stayed in bed and grew their hair but
    a few of the more ruthless declined to do so, they had clearly not addressed themselves,
    for the philosophy behind the performance was summed up by Mr Lennon, who said
    that all would be well if the Vietnamese, both North and South, would only take
    their trousers off, followed by the Arabs, the Israelis, the Russians and the
    Americans, while Mrs Lennon unwittingly touched upon the fallacy in the argument
    by proclaiming that their mood could be summed up in the words: ''Remove your
    pants before resorting to violence''. It might, of course, be objected that this
    is the spirit which in practice presumably guides every rapist, but granting that
    Mrs Lennon meant to say that he who removes his pants will be unable to resort
    to violence, it still left unresolved the problem of what to do about those whose
    pants stayed resolutely on, and still more the problem of how to deal with those
    who had learnt to do violence while naked from the waist down, or up, or even
    both.

    Bernard Levin, The Pendulum Years : Britain In The Sixties (1970)

    Elsewhere, in one of his newspaper columns, Levin said memorably of Lennon "there
    is nothing wrong with [him] that could not be cured by standing him upside down
    and shaking him gently until whatever is inside his head falls out."

    I have just started reading The Pendulum Years, and thus far it seems an eerily
    clear-sighted vision of the decade given that it was written at its very tail-end.
    Bernard Levin--who as you will learn we should habitually refer to as Bernard
    ''Massive, unflagging, moral, exquisitely shaped, enormously vital, enormously
    funny, strong, supple, human, ripe, generous and graceful'' Levin--is remembered
    in a recent comment thread over at The Dabbler, well worth reading. But of course
    everything in The Dabbler is well worth reading.'
