  text: 'Compare and contrast these two snaps. One shows a trio of carvings from an
    "Indian cemetery" (reportedly), taken in 1900. The second shows a trio of Channel
    4 newsreaders performing a musical number at a charity event (reportedly), taken
    last week.



    Dullwits and dunderpates would say "Well, Mr Key, so what? The only thing the
    two photographs have in common is that they show three figures. You could find
    thousands, nay, millions of similar snaps. What point are you trying to make?"

    The point I am trying to make is that this is the first, albeit flimsy, evidence
    I have discovered of the cult surrounding bumptious newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy.
    Oh, there are flaws in my reasoning, many, many flaws. But I implore those of
    you who think I am talking twaddle to watch "KrishGM" (as he likes to be known...
    why???) very, very carefully in the coming months. The cult has something planned,
    I am sure of it.
