  text: "\nThis week over at The Dabbler I have shoved into my cupboard a classic\
    \ from the Hooting Yard Treasury of Song. This is of course a plug or puff for\
    \ next week's Evening Of Lugubrious Music And Lopsided Prose, attendance at which\
    \ ought to be compulsory for all devotees of Hooting Yard but is, alas, in these\
    \ namby pamby wishy washy twee days o\u2019 pap merely voluntary. That said, you\
    \ really are urged to strain every sinew to cobble together a fiver, to foregather\
    \ upon Tower Bridge, and then to head more or less in a straight line southwards\
    \ down Tower Bridge Road until you reach Bermondsey Square, wherein you will find\
    \ Woolfson & Tay Bookshop/Gallery/Cafe, wherein, at 7.00 PM on Friday 18 November,\
    \ Mr Key & Mr Spaceman will be providing a woopdy doopdy extravaganza of lugube\
    \ \u2018n\u2019 lop.\n"
