  text: 'Last night I dreamed, not that I went to Manderlay again, yet again, yet
    again, but that I was hanging out with Emerson, Lake, and Lake''s mother, but
    not Palmer, of whom there was no sign. It was uneventful, as dreams go, but when
    I woke I did wonder what it might mean, and I decided to ask that question on
    Facebook Facecloth.

    Answer came from William English, who wrote : "After careful consideration it
    seems obvious that by omitting Carl Palmer, drummer with Atomic Rooster, and substituting
    him with Lake''s mother, you are erasing traumatic childhood memories of a "pram
    cellar" (being an anagram of Carl Palmer). Am I right?"

    Eek! It has all come flooding back. I shall now undergo rigorous recovered memory
    therapy.


    Emerson (present), Lake (present), Palmer (absent), Lake''s mother (not shown)

    ADDENDUM : A particularly bewildering point about this dream is that I was never
    an aficionado of the band John Peel invariably referred to as Emerson, Lake &
    Parker, and have never owned any of their music in LP or CD form, nor indeed in
    cassette or 8-track or mp3, nor in any other format yet dreamed up by sound reproduction
    boffins.'
