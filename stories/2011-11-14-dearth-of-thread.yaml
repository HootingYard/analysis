  text: 'Dan Chambers sent me this snap of a sampler, taken in the Bethnal Green Museum
    of Childhood. The provenance card states that it was made by a girl named Enid,
    aged fourteen, so, as Dan says, "maybe not so tiny". But it may well be that the
    Museum has not done its research thoroughly, and that the sampler was made by
    an anonymous needleworker for Tiny Enid. What with the privations of the times
    (1933) there may have been a dearth of thread, not enough, at any rate, to sew
    both TINY and ENID.
