  text: Many thanks to Salim Fadhley for drawing to my attention this whole flapdoodle
    about magnetically aligned cows. Personally, I have always been convinced of the
    unbreakable link between cows and magnetism, ever since an episode in a field
    during a picnic when I was a child. The memory grows dim, for I was but tiny,
    but magnets and cows were both involved, inextricably, I think. My father, too,
    and one of my sisters, and a priest who had joined us for the picnic, clad in
    his black soutane, but non-magnetic. If I could recall the exact date I could
    check the weather conditions pertaining at the time, if, that is, I could remember
    precisely where we were, at picnic, near cows, and magnets.
