  text: "Further to my report, last Saturday, of a Facebook Facecloth postage and\
    \ subsequent comment, here is another. I will not be making a habit of this, but\
    \ last night's brief exchange of comments with Elberry is, I think, worth noting\
    \ here.\nI chuckled at a comment I read appended to a postage on the Grauniad's\
    \ Comment Is Free site, and so, on Facecloth, noted\nA Comment Is Free comment\
    \ over at The Grauniad\_: \u201CGroan, and so the Guardian descends still further\
    \ into being an upmarket version of Black Flag for the under 16s.\u201D I chuckled.\n\
    The subsequent dialogue with Elberry went as follows\nElberry\_: more on the nature\
    \ of this chuckling please, the sound, duration, effect on passers-by, etc.\n\
    Frank Key : Grating and somehow tragic, forty-nine seconds, solicitude, offers\
    \ of loose change, thumpings.\nElberry\_: does it excite frenzies, sexual or otherwise?\n\
    Frank Key : Only in the raddled hearts of the unseemly\nElberry\_: is it pure\
    \ to the pure, if the pure are privy to these terrible eruptions?\nFrank Key\_\
    : Alas, there are tincts\nElberry\_: would you consider removing these safeguards,\
    \ so the many- headed rabble may hark to your mirth, and take heart therefrom?\n\
    Frank Key\_: I will consider it, while my head is upon the pillow, and I snooze,\
    \ imminently\nAfter tippy-tapping which, I retired to bed, rested my head upon\
    \ the pillow, and snoozed. Alas, I did not after all consider removing any chuckle\
    \ safeguards."
