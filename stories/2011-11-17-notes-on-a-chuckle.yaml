  text: 'Further to my report, last Saturday, of a Facebook Facecloth postage and
    subsequent comment, here is another. I will not be making a habit of this, but
    last night''s brief exchange of comments with Elberry is, I think, worth noting
    here.

    I chuckled at a comment I read appended to a postage on the Grauniad''s Comment
    Is Free site, and so, on Facecloth, noted

    A Comment Is Free comment over at The Grauniad : "Groan, and so the Guardian descends
    still further into being an upmarket version of Black Flag for the under 16s."
    I chuckled.

    The subsequent dialogue with Elberry went as follows

    Elberry : more on the nature of this chuckling please, the sound, duration, effect
    on passers-by, etc.

    Frank Key : Grating and somehow tragic, forty-nine seconds, solicitude, offers
    of loose change, thumpings.

    Elberry : does it excite frenzies, sexual or otherwise?

    Frank Key : Only in the raddled hearts of the unseemly

    Elberry : is it pure to the pure, if the pure are privy to these terrible eruptions?

    Frank Key : Alas, there are tincts

    Elberry : would you consider removing these safeguards, so the many- headed rabble
    may hark to your mirth, and take heart therefrom?

    Frank Key : I will consider it, while my head is upon the pillow, and I snooze,
    imminently

    After tippy-tapping which, I retired to bed, rested my head upon the pillow, and
    snoozed. Alas, I did not after all consider removing any chuckle safeguards.'
