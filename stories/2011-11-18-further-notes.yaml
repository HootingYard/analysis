  text: 'That conversation, continued...

    Elberry : what pillow do you use? is it stuffed with the feathers of birds or
    the skulls of mice?

    Frank Key : An admixture of cotton wool and sand, wrens'' feathers and wolf hair

    Elberry : and the sand, can you expand on its provenance? do you use the sand
    from the Alamogordo Test Range, or common or garden sand? is it related to the
    sand nightly deployed by the Sandman? Is it sand from the sandy road of Eliot''s
    Waste Land?

    Frank Key : It is coarse sand, dredged from the vasty deep, then spread out, by
    much raking, to dry under a Panglossian sun, before being poured into the pillowcase
    through a gorgeous ornate metalwork funnel

    Elberry : How do you do the dredging? Do you have an industrial dredging machine?

    Frank Key : I use a mighty concrete dredger barge, built to Lambot''s original
    design rather than the later Gabellini or Edison models.

    Elberry : i used to teach at Zeppelin, i think they make dredging machines but
    i am unsure if they are suitable for vasty deeps. Could you just use a spade?
    i ask as i thought about doing a bit of light dredging, to keep fit

    Frank Key : Use of a spade beneath the vasty deeps is fraught with risk, but will
    undoubtedly boost your manliness. Or you might drown.

    Elberry : Heroes don''t drown, they dredge.'
