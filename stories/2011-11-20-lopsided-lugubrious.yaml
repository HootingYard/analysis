  text: 'I spent yesterday recovering from the rigours of the Evening Of Lopsided
    Prose & Lugubrious Music at Woolfson & Tay held on Friday. Those of you who were
    unable to attend or who could not be dragged there by wild horses will be pleased
    to know that the whole kit and kaboodle was recorded by ResonanceFM (thanks to
    Chris Weaver and Johnny Seven) for broadcast as a Hooting Yard Special at a date
    to be announced, and thereafter as a pod thing. I shall alert you to these developments
    when I know the details.

    I must also thank Shivaun Woolfson and Frances Tay, whose splendid independent
    bookshop / cafe / gallery hosted the event and who ensured the whole thing ran
    smoothly. I suggest all Hooting Yard devotees make a beeline for the shop whenever
    they are in London. It occurs to me that every now and then you may actually wish
    to read something other than my outpourings, in which case you will find a fine
    selection of books there.

    Thanks too of course to Outa_Spaceman for joining me on singing and ukulele duty.
    I can neither sing nor play the ukulele, so that part of the evening would have
    been an absolute disaster without him. I am grateful too to Pansy Cradledew for
    her assistance during the Poetry Masterclass.

    My only disappointment is that the assembled throng seemed not to understand I
    was delivering a series of serious lectures on topics as diverse as birds, owl
    gods, Virginia Woolf''s sausage and haddock dilemma, and seaweed heroes, and my
    talks were greeted with immoderate laughter and the occasional outbreak of hilarity.
    As I said in the programme notes, "unseemly pangs can be tempered by moral balance".
    Do try to remember that next time, whenever the next time is.
