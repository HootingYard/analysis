  text: 'Given that it was published in 1970, Bernard Levin''s The Pendulum Years
    : Britain In The Sixties is a remarkably clear-sighted view of the decade, and
    most of his observations and conclusions would hold good even with the benefit
    of forty years'' hindsight. But pop music (sorry, make that "pop-music") was not
    exactly Levin''s strong point, though he makes a tremendous effort to address
    the phenomenon...


    The growth of pop-music groups--many, no doubt, inspired by the gigantic commercial
    success of the Beatles to believe that the lightning might strike them too, if
    they only formed fours and began to perform, but many, also, clearly in the business
    of self-expression--was the most extraordinary phenomenon in the world of entertainment
    of the whole decade; long before its end there were literally thousands of them,
    in Britain and America, and though many flourished only briefly, many displayed
    surprising endurance, and in any case there were always ten to take the place
    of one which fell. Some were almost as famous, and successful, as the Beatles;
    some were known only to the most devoted aficionados. But all added to the atmosphere
    of the decade, and the isle was full of noises as never before, coming from, among
    others, the Rolling Stones, the Bee Gees, the Monkees, the Doors, the Cream, the
    Mothers of Invention, the Seekers, the Who, the Small Faces, the Pretty Things,
    the Animals, the Pink Floyd, the Scaffold, the Grateful Dead, the Tremoloes, the
    Family, the Supremes, the Holding Company, the Four Tops, the Led Zeppelin, the
    Shadows, the Exploding Galaxy, the Editors, the Fugs, the Gods, the Kinks, the
    Hermits, the Paper Dolls, the Breakaways, the Greaseband, the Casuals, the Amen
    Corner, the Big Sound, the Flirtations, the Herd, the Marbles, the Status Quo,
    the New York Public Library, the Hollies, the Foundations, the Electric Havens,
    the Four Seasons, the Bachelors, the Seychelles, the Love Affair, the Fifth Dimension,
    the Three Dog Night, the Equals, the Vagabonds, the Marmalade, the Mindbenders,
    the Moody Blues, the Mirettes, the Tuesday''s Children, the Plastic Penny, the
    Procol Harum, the Troggs, the Fruit Machine, the Union Gap, the 1910 Fruitgum
    Co., the Beach Boys, the Fairport Convention, the Vanity Fair, the Harmony Grass,
    the Aces, the Young Tradition, the Nice, the Dubliners, the Tinkers, the Fleetwood
    Mac, the Incredible String Band, the Web, the Little Free Rock, the Blodwyn Pig,
    the Liverpool Scene, the Spooky Tooth, the Third Ear, the High Tide, the Mamas
    and Papas, the Carnations, the Pacemakers, the From Genesis to Revelation, the
    O''Hara Express, the Pentangle, the Chickenshack, the Blind Faith, the Fourmost,
    the Searchers, the Four Pennies, the Bar-Kays, the Unit Four Plus Two, the Hedgehoppers
    Anonymous, the Applejacks, the Box Tops, the Edison Lighthouse, the Blood, Sweat
    and Tears, the Vibrations, and the Rada Krishna Temple.

    The bulk of the output of all these, including that of the Beatles themselves,
    vanished, quite rightly, down the memory-hole of instant oblivion.'
