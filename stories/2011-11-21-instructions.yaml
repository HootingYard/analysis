  text: "I thought it prudent, when making preparations for last Friday's Evening\
    \ Of Lugubrious Music & Lopsided Prose, to provide the audience with a list of\
    \ instructions, to ensure they conducted themselves properly. After all, one does\
    \ not want to have to interrupt one's babbling to have to deal with fits of the\
    \ vapours, noisy potato crisp munching, or other distractions. The printed programme\
    \ for the evening thus included this list, which may be of use to other performers:\n\
    INSTRUCTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE\nI. Please remain seated during the more\
    \ exciting moments.\nII. If for any reason you need to mop your brow, use a dainty\
    \ napkin.\nIII. Spillages must be paid for in coinage of the realm.\nIV. When\
    \ the Darning-Needle of Destiny is unveiled, cower.\nV. Unseemly pangs may be\
    \ tempered by moral balance.\nVI. Applause should be rendered with unbridled fanaticism.\n\
    VII. Drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you\
    \ away (Isaiah, 36\_: 16,17)"
