  text: "The first one ashore was Captain Miles Coverdale, a man all too aware that\
    \ he shared his name with the first translator of the Bible into English.\nThe\
    \ second man ashore was Corporal William Tyndale, who had absolutely no idea that\
    \ he shared his name with the first man to translate the Bible into English from\
    \ the original Greek and Hebrew.\nThe third ashore was Cornet James Version, known\
    \ to all and sundry as\u201CKing\u201D James Version.\nAs dawn broke, the Captain,\
    \ the Corporal and the Cornet stood, panting and brine-drenched, on the glittering\
    \ sands. They took their firearms from the rubber sacks in which they had carried\
    \ them ashore, and cocked them. Yonder, in the trees and bushes, savages could\
    \ be lurking. This was an uncharted land, the first they had spotted from the\
    \ periscope of their submarine in all their months at sea, months that would turn\
    \ to years, for the submarine was on a five-year mission, to explore strange new\
    \ worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no submarine\
    \ manned by a Captain and a Corporal and a Cornet had gone before.\nThere was\
    \ a sudden rustling in the trees and bushes beyond the shoreline sands. Instinctively,\
    \ Captain Miles Coverdale aimed his ray gun and fired. It was his way, to shoot\
    \ at the first sign of movement and worry about the consequences later. That was\
    \ why he was the Captain. As the foliage burst into flames, he pranced forward,\
    \ taking further blasts, signalling for the Corporal and the Cornet to follow\
    \ him.\nAbove, in the sky, birds shrieked.\nJust before they reached the burning\
    \ trees and bushes, a figure stepped out to confront them, a figure unlike any\
    \ they had seen before. It was indubitably a man, but what manner of man? His\
    \ yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair\
    \ was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\
    \ luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed\
    \ almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his\
    \ shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips. The Captain was in no doubt.\n\
    \u201CWatch out, men!\u201D, he cried, \u201CThis is one of those savages I warned\
    \ you about!\u201D\n\u201CShall we kill it immediately, in cold blood?\u201D asked\
    \ the Corporal.\n\u201CWait, I think it is about to grunt some unholy savage babbling,\u201D\
    \ said the Cornet.\nAnd indeed, the strange figure held up a hand as if in greeting,\
    \ and shook charred leaves and twigs from its hair, and its watery eyes fixed\
    \ the trio of submariners in a mesmeric gaze. Its voice, when at last it spoke,\
    \ was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation\
    \ in tone or cadence.\n\u201CBibite unusquisque aquam cisternae suae donec veniam\
    \ et tollam vos,\u201D it said.\n\u201CCrikey! What was all that about?\u201D\
    \ asked the Corporal.\n\u201CIf I am not mistaken,\u201D said the Captain, \u201C\
    It is speaking Latin. It said something along the lines of \u2018Drink ye every\
    \ one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away\u2019\u201D\
    .\n\u201CActually,\u201D said Cornet \u201CKing\u201D James Version, \u201CNow\
    \ you mention it, I am quite thirsty. Permission to glug from my cistern, Captain?\u201D\
    \nCaptain Miles Coverdale assessed the situation in a twinkling, as he had been\
    \ trained to do back at Captaincy Training School. While keeping a beady eye on\
    \ the savage, he commanded his men to take the cisterns from their satchels and\
    \ to glug away. Mid-glug, the Cornet had a sudden thought, and piped up.\n\u201C\
    Captain,\u201D he said, \u201CThe savage said that when we had drunk each from\
    \ his own cistern he was going to take us away. Where do you think he's going\
    \ to take us to?\u201D\nBut even as he spoke, the savage came lumbering forward,\
    \ and it swept the three of them up, and it carried them off into the trees and\
    \ the bushes, they were swept away, they were swept away and gone. Birds continued\
    \ to shriek in the sky, and the glittering sands were again deserted as before,\
    \ and just offshore the submarine lay bobbing on the water, and waves crashed\
    \ over it, and as the years passed it rusted and broke in pieces and one by one\
    \ the pieces sank to the bottom of the sea, and became nooks for crabs and lobsters\
    \ and other beings of the deep, and no trace was ever found of the Captain and\
    \ the Corporal and the Cornet."
