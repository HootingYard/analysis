  text: 'Reader Kimika Ying has unearthed a treasure from the past.


    Dear Mr. Key, she writes, I''ve found a book which put me in mind of Hooting Yard
    which I would like to pass along, "The Infant Moralist" by Lady Helena Carnegie
    and Mrs. Arthur Jacob, published in 1903. Public domain versions of the book,
    with a delightfully illustrated copy of the original, are located here

    It contains some of the usual moral lessons on "The Consequences of Greed", "Profanity",
    "Envy", "Courage", etc. What caught my attention were the less commonly heard
    ones: "Insensate Mischief", "Inevitable Retribution", "Unsuitable Jesting", and
    "Ill-Timed Levity".

    And this:

    THE CHATTERBOX

    I needs must beg you, Caroline,

    To cease your Chatter whilst I dine.

    It deafens every Ear.

    John Footman cannot hear my Words,

    And I have asked him twice for Curds

    And still he cannot hear.

    If Caroline were with us today she would undoubtedly have a cell phone out at
    the dinner table as well. Anyway, all fine moral lessons and a good addition to
    any library. It also occurs to me that this book might be a superior replacement
    for the usual deadly dull workplace employee handbook.'
