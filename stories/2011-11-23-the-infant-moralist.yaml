  text: "Reader Kimika Ying has unearthed a treasure from the past.\n\nDear Mr. Key,\
    \ she writes, I've found a book which put me in mind of Hooting Yard which I would\
    \ like to pass along, \u201CThe Infant Moralist\u201D by Lady Helena Carnegie\
    \ and Mrs. Arthur Jacob, published in 1903. Public domain versions of the book,\
    \ with a delightfully illustrated copy of the original, are located here\nIt contains\
    \ some of the usual moral lessons on \u201CThe Consequences of Greed\u201D, \u201C\
    Profanity\u201D, \u201CEnvy\u201D, \u201CCourage\u201D, etc. What caught my attention\
    \ were the less commonly heard ones: \u201CInsensate Mischief\u201D, \u201CInevitable\
    \ Retribution\u201D, \u201CUnsuitable Jesting\u201D, and \u201CIll-Timed Levity\u201D\
    .\nAnd this:\nTHE CHATTERBOX\nI needs must beg you, Caroline,\nTo cease your Chatter\
    \ whilst I dine.\nIt deafens every Ear.\nJohn Footman cannot hear my Words,\n\
    And I have asked him twice for Curds\nAnd still he cannot hear.\nIf Caroline were\
    \ with us today she would undoubtedly have a cell phone out at the dinner table\
    \ as well. Anyway, all fine moral lessons and a good addition to any library.\
    \ It also occurs to me that this book might be a superior replacement for the\
    \ usual deadly dull workplace employee handbook."
