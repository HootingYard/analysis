    I was so delighted by the quotation from Bernard Levin--oops, I really must remember
    to call him Bernard "Massive, unflagging, moral, exquisitely shaped, enormously
    vital, enormously funny, strong, supple, human, ripe, generous and graceful" Levin
    whenever I mention him--that I posted it again today, at The Dabbler.


    One point that has occurred to me is the seemingly outrageous omission from the
    list of "the Jethro Tull". But I realise that, even in 1970, the great critic
    intuited that the band led by the hairy monopod flautist would never, ever, vanish
    down "the memory hole of instant oblivion".'
