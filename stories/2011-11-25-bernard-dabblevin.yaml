  text: "\nI was so delighted by the quotation from Bernard Levin\u2014oops, I really\
    \ must remember to call him Bernard \u201CMassive, unflagging, moral, exquisitely\
    \ shaped, enormously vital, enormously funny, strong, supple, human, ripe, generous\
    \ and graceful\u201D Levin whenever I mention him\u2014that I posted it again\
    \ today, at The Dabbler.\n\nOne point that has occurred to me is the seemingly\
    \ outrageous omission from the list of \u201Cthe Jethro Tull\u201D. But I realise\
    \ that, even in 1970, the great critic intuited that the band led by the hairy\
    \ monopod flautist would never, ever, vanish down \u201Cthe memory hole of instant\
    \ oblivion\u201D."
