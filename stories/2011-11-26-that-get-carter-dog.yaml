  text: "One of the pieces I read at An Evening Of Lugubrious Music & Lopsided Prose\
    \ last week was Get Carter. It seemed to be greeted with particular enthusiasm\
    \ by the audience, so much so that I have received a number of letters on the\
    \ subject, extracts from which I reproduce below:\nDear Frank, Thank you so much\
    \ for your performance last Friday. After a terribly busy week it was the perfect\
    \ opportunity to relax, and indeed as soon as you started speaking I promptly\
    \ fell into a deep and refreshing snooze. My ears pricked up, and I woke, however,\
    \ when you mentioned the dog in Get Carter. I was utterly enchanted by this pooch,\
    \ and I wonder if perhaps you have a tiny black-and-white illustration of it?\n\
    All Hail, Mr Key! Last Friday I had tickets to two events, one being your \u201C\
    gig\u201D with Outa_Spaceman and the other a concert by that titan of something-or-other,\
    \ Tinie Tempah. As it happened, my ticket for Mr Tempah was engulfed by a fireball,\
    \ leaving me with little choice but to trudge down to Bermondsey Square to see\
    \ you. Gosh, am I glad I did! Though virtually everything in your performance\
    \ went in one ear and out the other\u2014I speak, of course, of my own ears\u2014\
    I marvelled at the portrait of the dog in Get Carter. I wonder if perhaps you\
    \ have a tiny black-and-white illustration of it?\nAhoy Key! Last week I found\
    \ myself trapped under a bookshelf in Woolfson & Tay and was quite unable to extricate\
    \ myself by 7.00 PM when your performance began. I thus had to listen to the whole\
    \ thing, which was a not unmixed blessing. Full marks, however, for the bit about\
    \ the dog near the end of the first half. Though your words were vivid enough\
    \ for me to see the dog clear in my mind's eye, I wonder if perhaps you have a\
    \ tiny black-and-white illustration of it?\nDear Frank, Just print a picture of\
    \ the damned dog and have done with it.\n"
