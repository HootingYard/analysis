  text: 'The Grauniad asks some of those who worked with him to share their memories
    of the late Ken Russell. Among them, Glenda Jackson, who recalls:

    As a director he never said anything very specific. He''d say, "It needs to be
    a bit more ... urrrgh, or a bit less hmmm", and you knew exactly what he meant.

    That''s so true, isn''t it? Paying due attention to the ellipsis, Hooting Yard
    has been on a constant mission to be a bit more ... urrrgh, and a bit less hmmm,
    and we shall redouble our efforts in memory of the great man, until it''s entirely
    ... urrrgh and there is not  a trace of hmmm whatsoever.'
