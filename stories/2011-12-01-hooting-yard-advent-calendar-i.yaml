text: 'I think it is about time I treated you lot to a Hooting Yard Advent Calendar.
  Each day between now and Christmas Day I will post a picture. The idea is that you
  get a big sheet of cardboard and hang it up on an inner wall of your hovel. Then,
  each day, you can print the picture posted here onto a sheet of paper, cut it out,
  and glue it to the sheet of cardboard. Watch in delight as the pictures multiply!

  We start today with a colour photograph of a drainage ditch, courtesy of Five Islands
  Orchard.
