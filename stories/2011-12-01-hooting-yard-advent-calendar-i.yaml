  text: 'I think it is about time I treated you lot to a Hooting Yard Advent Calendar.
    Each day between now and Christmas Day I will post a picture. The idea is that
    you get a big sheet of cardboard and hang it up on an inner wall of your hovel.
    Then, each day, you can print the picture posted here onto a sheet of paper, cut
    it out, and glue it to the sheet of cardboard. Watch in delight as the pictures
    multiply!

    We start today with a colour photograph of a drainage ditch, courtesy of Five
    Islands Orchard.
