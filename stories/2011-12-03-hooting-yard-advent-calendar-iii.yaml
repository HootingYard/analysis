  text: "Today's advent calendar picture may upset those of a nervous disposition\
    \ and those subject to fits of the vapours when confronted by images of lightning-struck\
    \ cows. The picture\u2014of cattle struck by lightning\u2014is a print from 1872.\n\
    Instructions for making your advent calendar can be found here. What I forgot\
    \ to mention is that, having glued the picture to your sheet of cardboard, you\
    \ should use a thick black marker pen to write the appropriate number above, below,\
    \ or to the side of the picture. Deploy Roman numerals, please.\n"
