  text: 'Today''s advent calendar picture may upset those of a nervous disposition
    and those subject to fits of the vapours when confronted by images of lightning-struck
    cows. The picture--of cattle struck by lightning--is a print from 1872.

    Instructions for making your advent calendar can be found here. What I forgot
    to mention is that, having glued the picture to your sheet of cardboard, you should
    use a thick black marker pen to write the appropriate number above, below, or
    to the side of the picture. Deploy Roman numerals, please.
