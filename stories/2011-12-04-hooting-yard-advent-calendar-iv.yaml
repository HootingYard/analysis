  text: 'Today''s advent calendar picture shows a bog, or more precisely a blanket
    bog. (A blanket bog ought not be confused with a Blunkett bog, which is the type
    of bog the blind philandering erstwhile Labour Home Secretary may stumble into
    when attacked by cows.) This particular bog is on Dartmoor, but I suspect it is
    similar to an Isle of Wight bog through which Margo Williams may be dragged by
    her ghostly spirit guides.
