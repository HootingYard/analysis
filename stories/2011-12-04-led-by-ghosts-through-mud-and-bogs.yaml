  text: "In my first book \u201CGHOSTLY GIFTS\u201D I related some of the earlier\
    \ cases where I uncovered physical objects in the presence of witnesses. Since\
    \ then my talent has developed greatly and I travel around the Isle of Wight seeking\
    \ out these unhappy souls whose greed, foolishness, jealousy or other sins have\
    \ held them prisoners without chains waiting for release.\nI may be busy at home\
    \ going about my daily chores, dusting, ironing or one of the many jobs a housewife\
    \ performs when a voice speaks and tells me to go to a certain place where someone\
    \ needs help. The voice I hear is one of my spirit guides. I then have to make\
    \ suitable arrangements with one of my small team of helpers who provide me with\
    \ transport as I have no car to travel to the place I have been told. I may not\
    \ have a hazardous or rich social life but it is certainly never dull as I set\
    \ forth upon these journeys not knowing what story I shall hear and what I may\
    \ be led to find. All I need are willing helpers, a pencil and paper because as\
    \ soon as I hear a ghostly voice speak I write down every word in strange writing\
    \ at great speed, the pencil never leaves the paper so that each word is joined\
    \ to the next. My helpers usually arm themselves with some tool to dig with and\
    \ we all wear old clothes as ghosts seem to have a habit of leading us through\
    \ mud and bogs or making us crawl under barbed wire, through thick brambles, scramble\
    \ down cliffs or push aside a herd of cows!\nfrom Margo Williams, Out Of The Mist\_\
