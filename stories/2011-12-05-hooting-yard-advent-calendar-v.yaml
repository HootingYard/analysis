  text: 'The whole point of this advent calendar hoo-ha is that we are counting towards
    the celebration of the birth of sweet baby Jesus. Later, grown to mangodhood,
    Jesus asserted that "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto
    the Father, but by me", so it may be considered inappropriate to include a picture
    of a rival god in our calendar. But that''s just what we''re going to do here
    at Hooting Yard, inspired by the spirit of diverse vibrancy, or vibrant diversity,
    or whatever it is they inculcate into tinies in their community education hubs
    these days.

    Here, courtesy of Bushwick Policy, is a Mayan bat-god, eerily similar to the hideous
    bat-god Fatso.
