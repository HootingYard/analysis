  text: 'Several years ago, I wrote "Accounts of dreams are rarely of interest to
    anyone other than the dreamer" before going on to describe a dream in which I
    was about to attack the late actor Roy Kinnear with a chair-leg. Since then, I
    have occasionally shared with readers other dreams I have had, when I think they
    may be of interest. What I have not done is to recount somebody else''s slumberland
    visions. I was so delighted, however, by reader Mark Patterson''s dream that I
    felt impelled to post it here:

    Dreamt last night that my only Christmas present was a ''Ginger Complains'' dvd.
    70 minutes of poor quality footage featuring Ginger Baker grumbling about this
    and that in front of a succession of run-down cinemas. 25% of his griping was
    inaudible due to poor sound quality.
