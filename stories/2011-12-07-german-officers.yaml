  text: 'Having much enjoyed Phil Baker''s biography of Austin Osman Spare, I have
    just started reading his earlier life of Dennis Wheatley, The Devil Is A Gentleman
    (2009). It is as informative, entertaining, and amusing as the Spare book. Here
    is Dennis, reminiscing about his visit to Germany in 1913 to learn about the family
    wine trade. He was much impressed by the officer class...

    ... a race apart, immune from arrest by the police, they could be tried only by
    their own courts of honour and, if found guilty of a disgraceful act, they were
    simply given a pistol with which to shoot themselves. The civilian population
    had been conditioned to regard them with abject veneration. Ladies, as well as
    men, when approaching one of them in a street, stepped off the pavement into the
    gutter to give them ample room to pass, which they accepted as their right and
    did not even acknowledge by the flicker of an eyelid. Awed, and admiring, I watched
    them greet one another with a graceful salute, a click of the heels and a sharp
    bow from the waist. It was years later before I realised that very few of them
    had any brains at all ...'
