  text: "Today's advent calendar picture is an old trading card for celery compound.\
    \ Personally, I always thought a celery compound was a fenced-off area where you\
    \ grew celery, much as the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts is\
    \ a sort of fenced-off area for the keeping of Kennedys. But apparently not. You\
    \ live and learn\u2014especially with Hooting Yard as your guide!\n\nFrom Vintage\
    \ Paper Collectables"
