  text: 'Today''s advent calendar picture is an old trading card for celery compound.
    Personally, I always thought a celery compound was a fenced-off area where you
    grew celery, much as the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts is a
    sort of fenced-off area for the keeping of Kennedys. But apparently not. You live
    and learn--especially with Hooting Yard as your guide!
