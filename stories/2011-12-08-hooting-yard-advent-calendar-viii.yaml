  text: 'Your Hooting Yard advent calendar picture today comes with a parental guidance
    warning, as it may frighten the tinies, not to mention the weak-minded and those
    of puny brainpans. It is a terrifying still taken from Quatermass And The Pit
    (Roy Ward Baker, 1967), showing the Hobbs End tube station demon.
