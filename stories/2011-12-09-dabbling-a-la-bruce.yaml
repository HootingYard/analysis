    Earlier this week in The Dabbler, Brit reviewed Sweeper!, a novel by the foopballist
    Steve Bruce. Though I have yet to read the book itself, the review was enough
    for me to recognise genius. I added a comment, saying: "OK, that''s it. I am destroying
    everything I have written to date and starting all over again with Steve Bruce
    as my guide, my teacher, my inspiration." If anybody thought I was joking, think
    again. In my cupboard today, you will find the first fruits of my new approach.
    It''s early doors, and I can''t pretend to have mastered the intricacies of the
    Brucesque method, but I am trying, I am trying.

    Incidentally, astute readers will note a particularly clever metafictional sally
    in my piece. Brit points to Bruce''s repeated use of fundamental spelling inconsistencies
    in proper names, and is dismissive of the idea that these may be due to a lack
    of proofreading or copy editing. I have followed Bruce in giving my hero''s name
    in a number of variations, and I also refer more than once to the actor Bruce
    Willis. Not only is there a pleasing Bruce / Bruce echo, but of course Willis
    once reputedly wrote on an online forum the immortal words "proofreading is for
    pussies". I leave you to untangle that one.'
