  text: "\nEarlier this week in The Dabbler, Brit reviewed Sweeper!, a novel by the\
    \ foopballist Steve Bruce. Though I have yet to read the book itself, the review\
    \ was enough for me to recognise genius. I added a comment, saying: \u201COK,\
    \ that's it. I am destroying everything I have written to date and starting all\
    \ over again with Steve Bruce as my guide, my teacher, my inspiration.\u201D If\
    \ anybody thought I was joking, think again. In my cupboard today, you will find\
    \ the first fruits of my new approach. It's early doors, and I can't pretend to\
    \ have mastered the intricacies of the Brucesque method, but I am trying, I am\
    \ trying.\nIncidentally, astute readers will note a particularly clever metafictional\
    \ sally in my piece. Brit points to Bruce's repeated use of fundamental spelling\
    \ inconsistencies in proper names, and is dismissive of the idea that these may\
    \ be due to a lack of proofreading or copy editing. I have followed Bruce in giving\
    \ my hero's name in a number of variations, and I also refer more than once to\
    \ the actor Bruce Willis. Not only is there a pleasing Bruce / Bruce echo, but\
    \ of course Willis once reputedly wrote on an online forum the immortal words\
    \ \u201Cproofreading is for pussies\u201D. I leave you to untangle that one."
