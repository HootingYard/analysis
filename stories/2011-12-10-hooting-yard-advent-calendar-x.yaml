  text: 'It''s pig time, at last, in the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar. Here is a picture
    of pigs doing what pigs do best. And let us not forget that if you gaze at these
    pigs for an hour or so, any mental or emotional turmoil buffeting your brain will
    be becalmed, for as we know, the contemplation of pigs in a pig sty is greatly
    soothing to the frantic.


    The snap is from the Animal Photos! website. I like the breezy gusto of that exclamation
    mark. Perhaps I should rename this site Hooting Yard!'
