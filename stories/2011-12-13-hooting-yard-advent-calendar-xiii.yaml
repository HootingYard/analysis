  text: 'Those of you who have been following the doings of Mr Key for an improbable
    length of time will know that in the final decade of the twentieth century I produced
    four--or was it five?--Hooting Yard Calendars. Certain persons have tried to cajole
    me into reviving this undoubted boon to the date-befuddled, but for the time being
    you are going to have to make do with the pale shadow of the calendar proper that
    is this year''s Hooting Yard Advent Calendar. Today''s picture, however, is the
    sole remnant of an abortive calendar, from (I think) 1996, which was to be entitled
    something along the lines of Treasures From The Istvan Plunkett Postage Stamp
    Collection. This one shows, according to my notes, "a trio of ne''er-do-wells
    brandishing whisks and celery".
