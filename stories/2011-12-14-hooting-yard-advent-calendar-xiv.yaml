  text: 'It is traditional at Hooting Yard, as Christmas approaches, to wheel out
    Little Severin, the Mystic Badger, and to pay close attention to his prognostications.

    take the form of his scrubbling about with his mighty claws among twigs and roots
    and undergrowth to no apparent purpose. So while we try to work out what on earth
    it may all portend, here is a snap of the Mystic Badger to print and cut out and
    paste with glue to your Hooting Yard Advent Calendar.
