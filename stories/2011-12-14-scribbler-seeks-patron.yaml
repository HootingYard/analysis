  text: This is a foolhardy, if heartfelt, request, and perhaps the season of good
    will is the time to make it. I am seeking a patron--a wealthy person (or indeed
    persons), perhaps an oligarch or a plutocrat, one at least to whom my modest requirements
    seem puny--who could help to place Hooting Yard on a sound financial footing.
    There are readers and listeners who are very generous--you know who you are, and
    I thank you--but in this instance I wonder if there is a devotee of sufficient
    riches who could help not only to keep the wolf from the door, but to keep it
    penned in some distant wolf-prison. If you think you may have sufficient sense,
    and wealth, to support an impoverished scribbler, please drop me a line (address
    here). Or, if you cannot help but count among your friends and acquaintances an
    oligarch or plutocrat or, say, Damien Hirst or Richard Branson, please draw this
    to their attention. And do not forget there is always that Paypal "Donate" button
    to your right.
