  text: "This is a foolhardy, if heartfelt, request, and perhaps the season of good\
    \ will is the time to make it. I am seeking a patron\u2014a wealthy person (or\
    \ indeed persons), perhaps an oligarch or a plutocrat, one at least to whom my\
    \ modest requirements seem puny\u2014who could help to place Hooting Yard on a\
    \ sound financial footing. There are readers and listeners who are very generous\u2014\
    you know who you are, and I thank you\u2014but in this instance I wonder if there\
    \ is a devotee of sufficient riches who could help not only to keep the wolf from\
    \ the door, but to keep it penned in some distant wolf-prison. If you think you\
    \ may have sufficient sense, and wealth, to support an impoverished scribbler,\
    \ please drop me a line (address here). Or, if you cannot help but count among\
    \ your friends and acquaintances an oligarch or plutocrat or, say, Damien Hirst\
    \ or Richard Branson, please draw this to their attention. And do not forget there\
    \ is always that Paypal \u201DDonate\u201D button to your right."
