  text: 'Here is a snippet from Phil Baker''s excellent The Devil Is A Gentleman :
    The Life And Times Of Dennis Wheatley (2009):

    Star Of Ill Omen is an extraordinary performance, with its characteristically
    fraught and tender Wheatley love story (quite unlike James Bond and his girls)
    embedded in a mind-bogglingly improbable Cold War potboiler. Realistic details
    are combined with a larger naivety about space that wouldn''t be out of place
    in Dan Dare, and there are moments whose sheer weirdness compares with the work
    of proto-surrealist Raymond Roussel: when, for example, the insects [a breed of
    hyper-intelligent insects who buzz around like bees and give telepathic orders]
    show them black and white films of great moments in human history, and

    "the bee-beetles who controlled the machine again pressed the lever; again the
    machine whirred and the words came, ''Music while you work'', followed by the
    rumba."

    Wheatley never attempted science fiction again.'
