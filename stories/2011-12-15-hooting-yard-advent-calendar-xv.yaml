  text: 'Today''s thrilling advent calendar picture shows what happened next in the
    as yet unwritten adventures of the men with whisks and celery. As you can see,
    the whisks have been discarded, as has the celery, and our trio of doughty ne''er-do-wells
    are engaged upon a perilous subaquatic mission, pursued by giant jellyfish (actual
    size).
