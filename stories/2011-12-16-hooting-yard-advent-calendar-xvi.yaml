  text: "It is about time we had a hovel in the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, so here\
    \ is one that doubles as a Norbiton allotment shed.\n\nI have taken this snap\
    \ from Anatomy Of Norbiton, an extraordinary website and a thing of strange and\
    \ terrible beauty. If you can bear to tear yourself away from Hooting Yard\u2014\
    never an easy task, I know, but with grit and determination it is occasionally\
    \ possible\u2014I recommend that you immerse yourself in its wonders for several\
    \ hours."
