  text: 'It is about time we had a hovel in the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, so here
    is one that doubles as a Norbiton allotment shed.


    I have taken this snap from Anatomy Of Norbiton, an extraordinary website and
    a thing of strange and terrible beauty. If you can bear to tear yourself away
    from Hooting Yard--never an easy task, I know, but with grit and determination
    it is occasionally possible--I recommend that you immerse yourself in its wonders
    for several hours.'
