text: "It is about time we had a hovel in the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, so here\
  \ is one that doubles as a Norbiton allotment shed.\n\nI have taken this snap from\
  \ Anatomy Of Norbiton, an extraordinary website and a thing of strange and terrible\
  \ beauty. If you can bear to tear yourself away from Hooting Yard\u2014never an\
  \ easy task, I know, but with grit and determination it is occasionally possible\u2014\
  I recommend that you immerse yourself in its wonders for several hours."
