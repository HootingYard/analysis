    This week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I present a caption competition with a
    twist. Those of you who can barely think straight due to your excitement at the
    continuing wonders of the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar will be pleased to learn
    that, having printed and cut out and pasted with glue to a sheet of cardboard
    one of the pictures which appeared earlier in the week, you will have an advantage
    over common or garden Dabbler readers. You will already be familiar with the photograph,
    and indeed with the caption. So get thee hence and devise your entry for a chance
    to win untold riches in gold.'
