  text: 'On Thursday next, 22nd December at 6.00 PM, ResonanceFM will be broadcasting
    the Hooting Yard Christmas Special--an hour-long (slightly edited) recording of
    last month''s Evening Of Lopsided Prose And Lugubrious Music at Woolfson & Tay
    in Bermondsey Square. Those of you who were there will be able to relive those
    golden moments, and those who were unable to attend can hear what you missed,
    and gnash your teeth, and rend your garments in despair, after which you may want
    to cheer yourselves up a little by sending Mr Key his Christmas money, via PayPal.

    A podcast of the complete, unedited recording will be available shortly after
    the broadcast, and I will of course post a link to it here.'
