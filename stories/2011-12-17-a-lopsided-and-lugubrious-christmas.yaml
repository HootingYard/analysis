    \ the Hooting Yard Christmas Special\u2014an hour-long (slightly edited) recording\
    \ of last month's Evening Of Lopsided Prose And Lugubrious Music at Woolfson &\
    \ Tay in Bermondsey Square. Those of you who were there will be able to relive\
    \ those golden moments, and those who were unable to attend can hear what you\
    \ missed, and gnash your teeth, and rend your garments in despair, after which\
    \ you may want to cheer yourselves up a little by sending Mr Key his Christmas\
    \ money, via PayPal.\nA podcast of the complete, unedited recording will be available\
    \ shortly after the broadcast, and I will of course post a link to it here."
