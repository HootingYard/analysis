  text: 'For today''s advent calendar picture I have raided the London Library blog,
    wherein one can find this snap (bigger when clicked upon) of the H. Imaginary
    History shelfmark. One of these days I may write an entire postage about the London
    Library shelfmarks--particularly those within the Science & Miscellaneous category--which
    are wildly idiosyncratic, occasionally baffling, and very, very pleasing.
