  text: 'According to one or two of my correspondents, it is high time I injected
    some explicitly religious content into the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar. We have
    had a Mayan bat god, and Our Lady of the Arctic Wastes, but these are not enough
    for the more devout among my readers. Today, then, a picture which will I hope
    give rise to earnest discussions of faith, fury, and foolishness.
