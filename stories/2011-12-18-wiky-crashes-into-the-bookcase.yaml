  text: "Max uses visualization and mime to inspire Wiky when they dance. \u201CI'll\
    \ think of a sparkling river, and before I've even begun to mime paddling down\
    \ it, Wiky has become a leaping fish. That may make me think of a crocodile eating\
    \ her, but just as I begin jaw snapping, she becomes a fluttering bird trying\
    \ to distract me. It's a very stimulating technique, but you have to be careful.\
    \ Once when we were dancing I visualized a bright red rose and then the fleeting\
    \ image of a speeding red sports car entered my mind. At that very moment Wiky\
    \ leapt sideways and crashed into the bookcase, which completely wrecked the dance\
    \ sequence, not to mention one of my mother's vases. I've spoken to other dance\
    \ visualizers about this and the general consensus is that she responded to the\
    \ flower as a bee and then had no time to change roles when the sports car came\
    \ along. Her only course was to take evasive action.\u201D\nWiky, you will be\
    \ delighted to learn, is a cat. She is among a number of cats\u2014including Nijinskat,\
    \ Fluff, Boots, Zoot, Archie and Toffee\u2014featured in the magisterially twaddle-packed\
    \ book Dancing With Cats (1999) by Burton Silver and Heather Busch, authors of\
    \ Why Cats Paint (1994).\nPansy Cradledew was excited to find this book for just\
    \ 30p in her local library sale, and declares it to be possibly the best book\
    \ bargain she has ever snapped up. You just know you're in for a treat from the\
    \ opening sentence of the Foreword by Swami Shakya Bahrain, Spiritual Healer,\
    \ who declares \u201CFor some years now, a new consciousness has been entering\
    \ our world, a new understanding of the energy fields that tie us and all\u2026\
    \u201D\u2014sorry, I fell into a doze there for a moment. Anyway, what we have\
    \ is over one hundred pages filled with crackpots talking about dancing with their\
    \ cats, accompanied by glorious colour photographs of said dances. For some reason\
    \ an integral part of the pastime appears to be that the human dancer is dressed\
    \ foolishly.\nThose of you keen to pursue the activity\u2014whether or not your\
    \ cat bashes into the bookcase\u2014may wish to visit this somewhat alarming website."
