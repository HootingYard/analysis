  text: 'The other day on Channel 4 News, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott
    was reported as saying that David Cameron had "thrown himself off the negotiating
    horse". I had not previously come across this type of horse, but I am always keen
    to keep abreast of the doings of our dear leaders, so I did what all lazy researchers
    do in the twenty-first century and looked it up on Google. The Brin-Page Engine
    fobbed me off by providing me with endless links to "negotiating house prices",
    and when I insisted that I did indeed mean "horse" and not "house" it seemed to
    think I wanted to negotiate to buy a horse, which was never my intention.

    Now your average clot or fathead would conclude from this that there is no such
    beast as a negotiating horse, and that Lord Oakeshott was either making it up
    or had suffered from some kind of brain spasm leading to delusions. Such is the
    mindset that credits Google, and the interweb, with knowing all there is to know.
    But I still have faith in books, of reference and otherwise, and in order to track
    down the negotiating horse, and to acquit myself of the charge of engaging in
    perpilocution, I set myself the task of reading through a swathe of horse literature.

    I shall not detain you by listing the many many many books, journals, encyclopaedia
    entries, dictionary definitions and other materials I read. Suffice to say that
    I would be well qualified to give the correct answers to hundreds of horsey quiz
    questions, were I to be so quizzed. Yet in my untold hours of study I did not
    come upon a single reference to the so-called negotiating horse. If such a thing
    did exist, it would seem that it only did so within the head of Lord Oakeshott.

    How easy it would have been, then, to dismiss the negotiating horse as a phantasm!
    Particularly, I would aver, given its provenance. After all, when one thinks of
    the members of the British House of Lords, one does not think automatically of
    powerful, erudite minds--quite the contrary. Whereas once the red benches would
    have been crammed with hereditary inbred aristocrats, now one finds a collection
    of time-serving lickspittle has-beens. That, at least, is a popular perception.
    But I harbour a deep respect, unfashionable perhaps, for some of our great institutions,
    and I was prepared to give Lord Oakeshott the benefit of the doubt. That is why,
    having read and read and read, in the field of horses, to no avail, I decided
    to go back to his original, reported, pronouncement, in case I might glean from
    it something I had previously overlooked.

    The Prime Minister, it was suggested, had "thrown himself off the negotiating
    horse". What did this tell us about the horse? If Cameron had thrown himself off
    the horse, he had clearly mounted it in the first place. This fact precluded it
    being, say, a clothes horse or a seahorse, two types of horses I had taken care
    to include in my research. Although it is possible to clamber on to, and to steady
    oneself upon, a clothes horse, it is unlikely one would do so in order to negotiate
    anything with anybody, isn''t it? One would look somewhat foolish, which is never
    a good starting point for even the lowest level negotiations. And of the seahorse,
    nothing further need be said. No, if Cameron had mounted the negotiating horse,
    which needs must he would have done in order to throw himself off it, there were
    only two types of horse it could be--a real, living, snorting horse of bone and
    muscle and sinew, such as those photographed in motion by Eadweard Muybridge in
    the latter part of the nineteenth century, or a gymnasium or pommel horse, of
    wood and metal and leather, as disported upon by gymnasts and, in some cases,
    circus performers.

    In either case, it would need to be a horse big enough for a minimum of two persons
    to be mounted upon, for one does not negotiate solo. Thus, if it were a real horse,
    it is unlikely to have been one of the smaller breeds, such as the Dartmoor pony
    or the falabella. As for pommel horses, they can be manufactured to any size required.
    It is not outwith the bounds of possibility that a special pommel horse, specifically
    designed for negotiating upon, and able to sit comfortably six, or twelve, or
    even more, might have been made, for the purpose.

    There is of course also the possibility that the "negotiating horse" is just what
    it says--a horse that actually carries on the negotiation, in which case Cameron
    may well have sat upon it by himself, in a stable or barn alongside other world
    leaders mounted upon their own negotiating horses, which, depending upon the physical
    size of the world leader, may even have been Dartmoor ponies or falabellas. Quite
    how a horse would negotiate, with its limited repertoire of snorts and whinnies,
    is another matter, and one which will require further study.'
