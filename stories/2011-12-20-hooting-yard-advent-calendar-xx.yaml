  text: 'On the twentieth day of the Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, we show the fair
    city of Plovdiv, home of Ugo and his blind Ma and his pal Ulf, under an eerie
    post-apocalyptic sun, like the sun in a John Martin painting. Put that in your
    pipe and smoke it!, as they used to say, curiously, in British films of the interwar
    years.


    from the Avion Hotel website.'
