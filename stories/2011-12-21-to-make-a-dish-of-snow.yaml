  text: 'Take a pottle of sweet thick Cream, and the white of eyght Egs, and beate
    them into your cream with a dishfull of Rosewater, and a dishfull of Sugar withal,
    then take a sticke and make it clene, and then cut it in the end foursquare, and
    make therewith beat all the aforesaid things together, and ever as it ariseth
    take it off, and put it in to a Cullender, this done, take a platter and sette
    an Apple in the midst of it, stick a thicke bush of Rosemary in the Apple. Then
    cast your Snow upon the Rosemary and fill your platter therewith, and if you have
    wafers cast some withal, and so serve them forthe.
