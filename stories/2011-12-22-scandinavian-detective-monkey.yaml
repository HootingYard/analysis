  text: 'I make it my habit, on the shortest day of the year, to devise a project
    which will keep me gainfully occupied until the longest day of the year. On the
    longest day of the year, by contrast, I resolve to make no effort to do anything
    whatsoever until the shortest day of the year, thus keeping my life in the proper
    equilibrium as recommended by Blotzmann (Second Handbook, Lavender Series).

    Today being the shortest day, I have been exercising the cranial integuments to
    come up with something that will not only keep me busy but, I hope, earn me oodles
    of cash. So I have decided to attempt to write a bestseller. Devoted readers will
    know that on occasion I lament what I think of as the "blinkered airhead" approach
    to publishing in this land, a state of affairs which means that my sweeping paragraphs
    of majestic prose are considered to be "not commercially viable". Like Raymond
    Roussel, I console myself with the thought that my (posthumous) fame will outshine
    that of Napoleon, and, indeed, of such modern luminaries as Vince Cable, Kate
    Winslet, and Tinie Tempah. In the meantime, however, it seems like a good idea
    to bash out the kind of potboiler that will fly off the shelves of airport bookstalls
    across the globe.

    I know that in order to sell by the million, I will need to write something absolutely
    in tune with the zeitgeist. That is why I hit upon the unbeatable idea of a fat
    novel about a Scandinavian detective monkey, to fit in with the current popularity
    of Scandinavian detective fiction and of talking monkeys. I am even thinking of
    doing a crash course in Swedish or Finnish so that I can write my thriller in
    that language and then have it translated back into English for added authenticity.

    My Scandinavian detective monkey will be called Lars Porsena, and it will be a
    somewhat depressive monkey, perhaps with a drink problem and other "issues". It
    will solve a series of crimes which take place in snowbound forests, usually in
    the dark, or at least the twilight. I am not much good at making up such scenarios,
    so what I might do is to read dozens of Scandinavian detective thrillers and cobble
    together some of the crimes, and the forests, and the snowdrifts, and then, in
    sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose, insert Lars Porsena the Scandinavian detective
    monkey into the scenes and have him solve the crimes, and swing from tree to tree,
    and scamper in the snowdrifts, while recovering from a hangover or battling one
    of his other "issues".

    This seems to me a foolproof template for a bestselling potboiler, and I am already
    seeking legal advice about adding a couple of diacritics to my name, so that when
    published, Lars Porsena : Scandinavian Detective Monkey will be attributed to
    Frank Key. Now all I have to do is to learn a Scandinavian language, read shelves''-worth
    of both Scandinavian detective fiction and talking monkey fiction, and write the
    damned thing before the longest day in 2012.'
