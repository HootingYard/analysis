  text: A complete recording of An Evening Of Lugubrious Music & Lopsided Prose, featuring
    Mr Key and Outa_Spaceman and Pansy Cradledew, is now available as a podcast from
    ResonanceFM. Might I suggest that, on Christmas Day, you gather the family around
    the fireside and listen, rapt and awestruck?
