  text: "Once there were two of us little goatherds in the wood, and were talking\
    \ of various childish things: amongst others we wished that we could fly, for\
    \ then we would fly out of the mountain to Germany (for so Switzerland was called\
    \ in St. Gall). On a sudden came a frightfully large bird darting down upon us,\
    \ so that we thought it was going to carry one or both of us away. At this we\
    \ both began to scream, and to defend ourselves with our shepherd's crooks, and\
    \ to cross ourselves, till the bird flew away; then we said to one another, \u201C\
    We have done wrong in wishing to be able to fly; God did not create us for flying,\
    \ but for walking.\u201D Another time I was in a very deep fissure looking for\
    \ crystals, of which many were found in it. All at once I saw a stone as large\
    \ as an oven starting from the side, and as I had no time to get out of the way,\
    \ I stooped down upon my face. The stone fell several fathoms down to a spot above\
    \ me, and from thence it made a spring away over me, so that I escaped with a\
    \ whole skin. I had plenty of such joys and happiness on the mountains among the\
    \ goats, of which I now remember nothing more.\nfrom The Autobiography Of Thomas\
    \ Platter, A Schoolmaster Of The Sixteenth Century, Translated From The German\
    \ By Mrs Finn (1847)"
