  text: 'Once there were two of us little goatherds in the wood, and were talking
    of various childish things: amongst others we wished that we could fly, for then
    we would fly out of the mountain to Germany (for so Switzerland was called in
    St. Gall). On a sudden came a frightfully large bird darting down upon us, so
    that we thought it was going to carry one or both of us away. At this we both
    began to scream, and to defend ourselves with our shepherd''s crooks, and to cross
    ourselves, till the bird flew away; then we said to one another, "We have done
    wrong in wishing to be able to fly; God did not create us for flying, but for
    walking." Another time I was in a very deep fissure looking for crystals, of which
    many were found in it. All at once I saw a stone as large as an oven starting
    from the side, and as I had no time to get out of the way, I stooped down upon
    my face. The stone fell several fathoms down to a spot above me, and from thence
    it made a spring away over me, so that I escaped with a whole skin. I had plenty
    of such joys and happiness on the mountains among the goats, of which I now remember
    nothing more.
