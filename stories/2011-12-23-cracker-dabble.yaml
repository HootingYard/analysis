    Over at the super soaraway Dabbler, my cupboard is snow-capped, and contains a
    seasonal memory of Christmas past--the past in this case being twenty-eight years
    ago, and the memory being a fond one of some particularly exciting Christmas crackers.
    Well, "exciting" is perhaps not the best word to describe them. "Preposterous",
    maybe.'
