  text: 'I remember, as a schoolboy... passing a huge tureen of soup, without first
    serving myself, down the oblong trestle table at which my fellow pupils and I
    were seated. Suddenly, one of the supervising staff, our Latin master, an ex-army
    man, roared from the top table to ask me why I was not having any. "Frankly, sir,"
    I replied in a supercilious voice, the memory of which, to this very day, grates
    on me as much as the voice itself must once have grated on everyone who knew me,
    "I find soup rather a bore." Whereupon, to my horror, he leapt to his feet, marched
    the length of the refectory hall and, now unnervingly puce of feature, stood over
    me. "A bore?" he barked, "You find it a bore, do you? Well, let me tell you, Adair,
    you putrid little twerp, had you been in a Jap prisoner-of-war camp during the
    last war, as I was, you would have been delighted to be bored with some soup!
    Oh yes, you would have got down on your knees and begged to be bored out of your
    gruesome little mind!" Needless to say, I ate the soup--and, from that formative
    moment on, I got, as it were, the hang of the thing.
