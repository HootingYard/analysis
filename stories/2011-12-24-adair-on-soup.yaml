  text: "I remember, as a schoolboy\u2026 passing a huge tureen of soup, without first\
    \ serving myself, down the oblong trestle table at which my fellow pupils and\
    \ I were seated. Suddenly, one of the supervising staff, our Latin master, an\
    \ ex-army man, roared from the top table to ask me why I was not having any. \u201C\
    Frankly, sir,\u201D I replied in a supercilious voice, the memory of which, to\
    \ this very day, grates on me as much as the voice itself must once have grated\
    \ on everyone who knew me, \u201CI find soup rather a bore.\u201D Whereupon, to\
    \ my horror, he leapt to his feet, marched the length of the refectory hall and,\
    \ now unnervingly puce of feature, stood over me. \u201CA bore?\u201D he barked,\
    \ \u201CYou find it a bore, do you? Well, let me tell you, Adair, you putrid little\
    \ twerp, had you been in a Jap prisoner-of-war camp during the last war, as I\
    \ was, you would have been delighted to be bored with some soup! Oh yes, you would\
    \ have got down on your knees and begged to be bored out of your gruesome little\
    \ mind!\u201D Needless to say, I ate the soup\u2014and, from that formative moment\
    \ on, I got, as it were, the hang of the thing.\nGilbert Adair, \u201COn Soup\u201D\
