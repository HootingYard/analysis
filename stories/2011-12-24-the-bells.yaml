  text: 'I greatly admire those who devote time and energy to the study of extremely
    arcane, obscure, or specialised subjects. Such as Robert Killick-Kendrick, whose
    obituary appears in today''s Grauniad. Though he was "a man of many interests,
    which included guitar playing, choral singing, hiking and photographing the numerous
    butterflies that visited his garden"- and possibly sharing his wife''s major preoccupation
    (she is "an expert on sand flies")--our hero is particularly to be acclaimed for
    this:

    He also made a study of domestic animals'' bells, ranging from elephants in India
    to hunting dogs in southern France, which resulted in a scholarly, but sadly uncompleted
    book, illustrated mainly with his own photographs.

    Incidentally, elsewhere in the Grauniad today, in the Weekend magazine, there
    is a photograph of what must surely be the most coveted Christmas gift of the
    year--of any year!--an Alain De Botton action figure. Curiously, there is no trace
    of the photo, nor indeed of the accompanying article, on the website.'
