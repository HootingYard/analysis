  \ papers of Bobnit Tivol recently fossicked from it a listing of the gifts given\
  \ to the fictional athlete by his coach, the all too real Old Halob, during one\
  \ festive season. We will be posting this list\u2014written by fictional athlete\
  \ Bobnit Tivol himself\u2014in instalments over the coming days. It is recommended\
  \ that you commit each part to memory, and then you will be delighted to discover\
  \ that you can sing the complete list to the tune of a well-known Christmas carol.\
  \ So without further ado, let's get cracking:\nOn the first day of Christmas, Old\
  \ Halob gave to me\nA viper, a shrew, and a bee."
