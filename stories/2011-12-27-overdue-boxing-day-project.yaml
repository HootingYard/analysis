  text: 'Astute readers, with their wits about them, will have noticed that the Hooting
    Yard Boxing Day Project failed to appear yesterday. I do apologise. What wit one
    thing and anutter, as my Belgian mother used to say, I simply didn''t get round
    to it. Still, the Yuletide season would be a puny and curdled affair without a
    Hooting Yard project to keep you occupied, so--better late than never--here it
    is.

    You will now have your complete Hooting Yard Advent Calendar, a large sheet of
    cardboard to which you have pasted, with glue, pictures of a drainage ditch and
    a wooden bobsleigh and cows struck by lightning and a blanket bog and a bat god
    and painted wooden decoy buffleheads and celery compound and the Hobbs End tube
    station demon from Quatermass And The Pit and a bowl of pap ''n'' slops and pigs
    in a pig sty and Our Lady Of The Arctic Wastes and Aguirre, The Wrath Of God with
    a Capuchin monkey and a postage stamp depicting a trio of ne''er-do-wells with
    whisks and celery and Little Severin The Mystic Badger and undersea adventurers
    pursued by giant jellyfish and a Norbiton allotment shed and imaginary history
    in the London Library and crackpots brandishing placards and a graveyard of ships
    from The Lost Continent and Plovdiv and ectoplasm and a mandrake-root homunculus
    and statuettes of saints and martyrs and bishops and BVMs and cardboard signage
    and Jesus directing traffic.

    Go and get a second sheet of cardboard of roughly the same size and, using a pair
    of sharp scissors, cut it into twenty-five rectangular bits. If you are doing
    things properly, you should find yourself with twenty-five bits of cardboard each
    of which is a little bigger than its corresponding picture pasted to the original
    sheet of cardboard.

    The next step is to place the bits of cardboard over the pictures, thus blocking
    them from sight. You can now fix the bits of cardboard in place by sticking a
    length of sticky tape--cut from a roll using the sharp pair of scissors--along
    the top edge of each rectangle, so that you create a set of twenty-five cardboard
    flaps on the original sheet of cardboard. With a thick black marker pen, randomly
    number the flaps from one to twenty-five, using Roman numerals. Then shove the
    beflapped sheet of cardboard into a cubby or cupboard or indoor storage facility
    and forget about it.

    And lo! When the first of December 2012 rolls around, eleven months hence, you
    can retrieve it from its hidey-hole and prop it up on your mantelpiece, if you
    have a mantelpiece, and then, day by day, from the first of December until Christmas
    Day, tear the appropriately numbered cardboard flap off the main sheet, carefully
    disposing of it in a wastepaper bin. Each day, therefore, you will reveal one
    of the pictures which, by this time next year, you will have completely forgotten
    about.

    And thus, through craft and cleverness, you are already in possession of your
    Hooting Yard Advent Calendar for 2012!'
