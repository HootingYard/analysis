  text: "It is traditional, at the turning of the year, for reader Mike Jennings to\
    \ update his exhaustive bibliography of out of print pamphlets by Dobson. \u201C\
    It seems that 2011 has been a lean year indeed for Dobsonian scholarship,\u201D\
    \ writes Mr Jennings from the pompous land of his banishment. Nevertheless, he\
    \ has managed to track down eleven, or rather twelve, previously unidentified\
    \ titles, and he is once again to be commended for his thoroughness, not least\
    \ in assigning those pesky, but lovely, Bl\xF6tzmann Numbers to the pamphlets\
    \ he has unearthed. One day we might be able to work out their significance.\n\
    There are earlier listings for pamphlets numbered 1 to 104, and pamphlets numbered\
    \ 105 to 128. Please note that, unless stated otherwise, all titles are out of\
    \ print.\n129. The Dredging Of The Canal At Gaarg On The Eve Of The Batcake-Akido\
    \ Conference.\n130. Ducks And Criminals And Well-Maintained Reservoirs.\n131.\
    \ Eleven Essays On Reservoir Maintenance, By One Who Knows.\n132. Things Beginning\
    \ With B.\n133. On The Inadvisability Of Taking Daytime Naps During The Unfolding\
    \ Of Cataclysmic World Events.\n134. How I Witnessed The Sight Of A Wild And Bearded\
    \ Mobile Librarian In Hand To Hand Combat With A Snarling Gaggle Of Brain-Bejangled\
    \ Peasants.\n135. How Many Cormorants Are There In The Bible?\n136. Omni-Encyclopaedia\
    \ Dobsonia.\n137. How To Fill Your Brain With Arcane Legal Precepts Through Simple\
    \ Will-Power And Osmosis.\n138. The Case Of Prince Fulgencio.\n139, 139a. The\
    \ Funnel, Volumes 1 and 2."
