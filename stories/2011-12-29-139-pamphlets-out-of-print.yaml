  text: 'It is traditional, at the turning of the year, for reader Mike Jennings to
    update his exhaustive bibliography of out of print pamphlets by Dobson. "It seems
    that 2011 has been a lean year indeed for Dobsonian scholarship," writes Mr Jennings
    from the pompous land of his banishment. Nevertheless, he has managed to track
    down eleven, or rather twelve, previously unidentified titles, and he is once
    again to be commended for his thoroughness, not least in assigning those pesky,
    but lovely, Blotzmann Numbers to the pamphlets he has unearthed. One day we might
    be able to work out their significance.

    There are earlier listings for pamphlets numbered 1 to 104, and pamphlets numbered
    105 to 128. Please note that, unless stated otherwise, all titles are out of print.
