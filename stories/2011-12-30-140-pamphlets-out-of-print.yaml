  text: 'It is traditional, at the turning of the year, for reader Mike Jennings to
    update his exhaustive bibliography of out of print pamphlets by Dobson. "It''s
    all a matter of diligent rummaging," writes Mr Jennings from the pompous land
    of his banishment. Since we last heard from him, yesterday, he has managed to
    track down a further title, and he is yet again to be commended for his thoroughness,
    not least in assigning that pesky, but lovely, Blotzmann Number to the pamphlet
    he has unearthed. One day we might be able to work out its significance.

    Please note that the listed title is currently out of print.
