  text: 'It seems to be the done thing on various blogs to mark the end of the year
    by pointing readers to highlights of the twelvemonth we are about to leave behind.
    But quite frankly, I can''t be bothered to trawl back through the 495 postages
    (before this one) which I tippy-tapped out in 2011. Dutiful readers will of course
    spend the final hours of the year as they usually do, rereading the entire Hooting
    Yard archive while making notes with a pencil in a jotter. And then, at the stroke
    of midnight, you can put on your pointy hat and raise a glass of aerated lettucewater
    in celebration, for a minute or two, before returning to your reading.

    I will be setting a series of tests early in 2012, to make sure you have been
    paying attention. Meanwhile, I wish you all a very happy new year, and thank you
    for your enthusiasm and support.'
