  text: 'A couple of weeks ago, I was delighted to learn the word perpilocutionist,
    defined as "one who expounds on a subject of which he has little knowledge". Aha!,
    I thought, with the gleam of recognition, that''s me! Long ago, I jettisoned that
    dull-witted advice to "write what you know about" and took it upon myself to write
    about absolutely anything that occurred to me, including that of which I was profoundly
    ignorant--ornithology, for example. The American economist and social theorist
    Thomas Sowell has written that "it is doubtful whether the most knowledgeable
    person on earth has even one percent of the total knowledge on earth", and, if
    that is indeed the case, I would be hobbling myself horribly before even putting
    pen to paper, were I to confine myself to my own paltry pocketful of knowledge.

    My delight at the discovery of the word was somewhat tempered when I failed to
    track it beyond a few websites. There is no place for it, I am sad to say, in
    the OED, which makes me immediately suspicious. At first glance it seems to have
    a respectable Latin provenance, given its figurative meaning as "one who talks
    through his hat". But while the "per" (for "through") and the "locution" are clear
    enough, the Latin "pil" refers to hair rather than hats, as in words such as depilation
    and caterpillar. Still, I suppose the idea of talking through a full head of hair
    is akin to talking through a hat, if we picture such a pose in our mind''s eye,
    and the word is far too useful to discard now, simply on the basis that some wag
    might have made it up. After all, I have been known to invent words from time
    to time, and I don''t always bother to define them.

    Identifying myself as a perpilocutionist grants me a magnificent opportunity,
    of course. Although I have been blathering on for years about things I know little
    or nothing about, I have done so circumstantially, or accidentally, or unwittingly,
    as it were--that is, in the absence of a conscious, declared aim or intention.
    But what would happen if I devised a project to address at least a percentage
    of the ninety-nine-point-nine percent of knowledge of which I am ignorant?

    Take, as an example, Madagascar. I know that it is a big island off the western
    coast of Africa. I know, because once I looked it up in a reference book for reasons
    I have forgotten, that the capital is Antananarivo. (How excited I was, the other
    day, to shout the word at the television screen while watching an episode of University
    Challenge when Jeremy Paxman sought just that answer from the octet of not-so-tinies!)
    I know, or at least I think I know, that Heinrich Himmler once suggested Madagascar
    as a land of settlement for the Jews of Europe. Other than that, I would be hard-pressed
    to tell you a single thing about the place. Does that mean I am incapable of writing
    an essay entitled "On Madagascar"? Hell, no! As a perpilocutionist, I am in a
    perfect position to cobble together a thousand words on the subject, on any subject.
    And it is important to note that I need not precede my frantic tippy-tapping at
    the keyboard with any research whatsoever, particularly that pathetic excuse for
    "research" that consists, in these benighted times, of a quick browse of the Wikipedia.
    No, the Madagascar of my putative essay would be the Madagascar nestled in my
    ignorant head, brought forth, miraculously, through the spouting of blather.

    It is no doubt foolhardy, but I have conceived the idea of writing, here, a daily
    essay, of which this is the first. The likelihood is that, long before reaching
    number 366 (this being a leap year) I will jack it in, abandon it, slap my forehead
    in astonishment at my own witlessness. But today, at least, it is a plan, and
    we shall see how it progresses. I am going to need 365 further topics, so if any
    of you would like to suggest subjects I ought to address, please use the Comments
    to do so. Please note that each essay''s title will begin with the word "On".'
