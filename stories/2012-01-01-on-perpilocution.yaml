  text: "A couple of weeks ago, I was delighted to learn the word perpilocutionist,\
    \ defined as \u201Cone who expounds on a subject of which he has little knowledge\u201D\
    . Aha!, I thought, with the gleam of recognition, that's me! Long ago, I jettisoned\
    \ that dull-witted advice to \u201Cwrite what you know about\u201D and took it\
    \ upon myself to write about absolutely anything that occurred to me, including\
    \ that of which I was profoundly ignorant\u2014ornithology, for example. The American\
    \ economist and social theorist Thomas Sowell has written that \u201Cit is doubtful\
    \ whether the most knowledgeable person on earth has even one percent of the total\
    \ knowledge on earth\u201D, and, if that is indeed the case, I would be hobbling\
    \ myself horribly before even putting pen to paper, were I to confine myself to\
    \ my own paltry pocketful of knowledge.\nMy delight at the discovery of the word\
    \ was somewhat tempered when I failed to track it beyond a few websites. There\
    \ is no place for it, I am sad to say, in the OED, which makes me immediately\
    \ suspicious. At first glance it seems to have a respectable Latin provenance,\
    \ given its figurative meaning as \u201Cone who talks through his hat\u201D. But\
    \ while the \u201Cper\u201D (for \u201Cthrough\u201D) and the \u201Clocution\u201D\
    \ are clear enough, the Latin \u201Cpil\u201D refers to hair rather than hats,\
    \ as in words such as depilation and caterpillar. Still, I suppose the idea of\
    \ talking through a full head of hair is akin to talking through a hat, if we\
    \ picture such a pose in our mind's eye, and the word is far too useful to discard\
    \ now, simply on the basis that some wag might have made it up. After all, I have\
    \ been known to invent words from time to time, and I don't always bother to define\
    \ them.\nIdentifying myself as a perpilocutionist grants me a magnificent opportunity,\
    \ of course. Although I have been blathering on for years about things I know\
    \ little or nothing about, I have done so circumstantially, or accidentally, or\
    \ unwittingly, as it were\u2014that is, in the absence of a conscious, declared\
    \ aim or intention. But what would happen if I devised a project to address at\
    \ least a percentage of the ninety-nine-point-nine percent of knowledge of which\
    \ I am ignorant?\nTake, as an example, Madagascar. I know that it is a big island\
    \ off the western coast of Africa. I know, because once I looked it up in a reference\
    \ book for reasons I have forgotten, that the capital is Antananarivo. (How excited\
    \ I was, the other day, to shout the word at the television screen while watching\
    \ an episode of University Challenge when Jeremy Paxman sought just that answer\
    \ from the octet of not-so-tinies!) I know, or at least I think I know, that Heinrich\
    \ Himmler once suggested Madagascar as a land of settlement for the Jews of Europe.\
    \ Other than that, I would be hard-pressed to tell you a single thing about the\
    \ place. Does that mean I am incapable of writing an essay entitled \u201COn Madagascar\u201D\
    ? Hell, no! As a perpilocutionist, I am in a perfect position to cobble together\
    \ a thousand words on the subject, on any subject. And it is important to note\
    \ that I need not precede my frantic tippy-tapping at the keyboard with any research\
    \ whatsoever, particularly that pathetic excuse for \u201Cresearch\u201D that\
    \ consists, in these benighted times, of a quick browse of the Wikipedia. No,\
    \ the Madagascar of my putative essay would be the Madagascar nestled in my ignorant\
    \ head, brought forth, miraculously, through the spouting of blather.\nIt is no\
    \ doubt foolhardy, but I have conceived the idea of writing, here, a daily essay,\
    \ of which this is the first. The likelihood is that, long before reaching number\
    \ 366 (this being a leap year) I will jack it in, abandon it, slap my forehead\
    \ in astonishment at my own witlessness. But today, at least, it is a plan, and\
    \ we shall see how it progresses. I am going to need 365 further topics, so if\
    \ any of you would like to suggest subjects I ought to address, please use the\
    \ Comments to do so. Please note that each essay's title will begin with the word\
    \ \u201COn\u201D."
