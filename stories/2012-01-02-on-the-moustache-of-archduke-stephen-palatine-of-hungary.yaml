  text: "There is an argument to be had that the well-groomed moustache is representative\
    \ of all that is best in a certain apprehension of Western civilization, where\
    \ gravitas, punctilio and rectitude are prized as essential qualities. Clearly\
    \ the moustache cannot, in and of itself, guarantee that the pinnacle of social\
    \ conduct has been achieved. We need only think of the luxuriant moustaches of,\
    \ on the one hand, the savage Ancient Gauls and, on the other, the hippies and\
    \ motorbikeists of nineteen-seventies America (think Easy Rider) to recognise\
    \ the absurdity of that conceit.\nAnd yet, within a larger context, one that includes\
    \ manners and customs and dress and even carriage and posture, the moustache is\
    \ incontrovertibly the icing on the cake, as it were. Remove the moustache and\
    \ you remove a crucial\u2014I would go so far as to say a necessary\u2014element\
    \ of civilization at its most civilized.\nConsider for a moment the splendid moustache\
    \ of Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary (1817\u20131867), previously Archduke\
    \ Stephen Francis Victor of Austria, governor of Bohemia from 1843 to 1847.\n\n\
    It is no accident, I think, that in this photograph the gaze of Archduchess Hermine\
    \ of Austria is concentrated fixedly upon that moustache. Dapper as he is in his\
    \ coat and trousers and shiny shoes, insouciant as he leans against a weighty\
    \ carved wooden credenza, an imaginary clean-shaven Palatine would cut far less\
    \ impressive a figure. Indeed, one cannot help thinking that Emperor Ferdinand\
    \ I of Austria would have withheld the governorship of Bohemia from him until\
    \ such time as he sprouted an appropriate moustache.\nThe Archduchess, incidentally,\
    \ was not the wife of the Archduke, for he never married. It is quite possible\
    \ that any prospective brides were intimidated by the moustache, perhaps intuiting\
    \ that the Archduke's mental and emotional energies were devoted to its cultivation\
    \ and care, leaving little to spare for connubial shenanigans. Such a conclusion\
    \ is borne out by careful and painstaking study of the countenance of the Archduchess\
    \ in the photograph. You might want to deploy a magnifying glass, but I think\
    \ you will agree with me.\nThere is a story, which I have just made up, that Archduke\
    \ Stephen, finding the coffers of Bohemia alarmingly depleted, once made use of\
    \ his moustache to raise much-needed funds. He staged a competition, open to all\
    \ the citizens of Bohemia, the challenge being to make an accurate estimation\
    \ of the number of individual hairs in his moustache. Each Bohemian paid a crown\
    \ to enter, and having done so qualified to write down their chosen number on\
    \ a scrap of paper, the gathered scraps being collected by one of the Archduke's\
    \ henchmen, together with the crowns. It is said that a barber from a Bohemian\
    \ village was brought to the palace, armed with a comb and a counting-stick, about\
    \ the size of a modern safety match, and was ordered to count one by one the hairs\
    \ in the Archducal moustache. Before this humble yet numerate artisan could complete\
    \ his task, however, Archduke Stephen's father died, and he inherited the title\
    \ of Count Palatine of Hungary, and left Bohemia for good, taking all the crowns\
    \ with him but leaving the scraps of paper with numbers written upon them, shoved\
    \ all jumbled up in the weighty carved wooden credenza against which he is seen\
    \ leaning in that photograph. The exact number of hairs in his magnificent moustache\
    \ never was calculated, more's the pity."
