  text: 'There is an argument to be had that the well-groomed moustache is representative
    of all that is best in a certain apprehension of Western civilization, where gravitas,
    punctilio and rectitude are prized as essential qualities. Clearly the moustache
    cannot, in and of itself, guarantee that the pinnacle of social conduct has been
    achieved. We need only think of the luxuriant moustaches of, on the one hand,
    the savage Ancient Gauls and, on the other, the hippies and motorbikeists of nineteen-seventies
    America (think Easy Rider) to recognise the absurdity of that conceit.

    And yet, within a larger context, one that includes manners and customs and dress
    and even carriage and posture, the moustache is incontrovertibly the icing on
    the cake, as it were. Remove the moustache and you remove a crucial--I would go
    so far as to say a necessary--element of civilization at its most civilized.

    Consider for a moment the splendid moustache of Archduke Stephen, Palatine of
    Hungary (1817-1867), previously Archduke Stephen Francis Victor of Austria, governor
    of Bohemia from 1843 to 1847.


    It is no accident, I think, that in this photograph the gaze of Archduchess Hermine
    of Austria is concentrated fixedly upon that moustache. Dapper as he is in his
    coat and trousers and shiny shoes, insouciant as he leans against a weighty carved
    wooden credenza, an imaginary clean-shaven Palatine would cut far less impressive
    a figure. Indeed, one cannot help thinking that Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria
    would have withheld the governorship of Bohemia from him until such time as he
    sprouted an appropriate moustache.

    The Archduchess, incidentally, was not the wife of the Archduke, for he never
    married. It is quite possible that any prospective brides were intimidated by
    the moustache, perhaps intuiting that the Archduke''s mental and emotional energies
    were devoted to its cultivation and care, leaving little to spare for connubial
    shenanigans. Such a conclusion is borne out by careful and painstaking study of
    the countenance of the Archduchess in the photograph. You might want to deploy
    a magnifying glass, but I think you will agree with me.

    There is a story, which I have just made up, that Archduke Stephen, finding the
    coffers of Bohemia alarmingly depleted, once made use of his moustache to raise
    much-needed funds. He staged a competition, open to all the citizens of Bohemia,
    the challenge being to make an accurate estimation of the number of individual
    hairs in his moustache. Each Bohemian paid a crown to enter, and having done so
    qualified to write down their chosen number on a scrap of paper, the gathered
    scraps being collected by one of the Archduke''s henchmen, together with the crowns.
    It is said that a barber from a Bohemian village was brought to the palace, armed
    with a comb and a counting-stick, about the size of a modern safety match, and
    was ordered to count one by one the hairs in the Archducal moustache. Before this
    humble yet numerate artisan could complete his task, however, Archduke Stephen''s
    father died, and he inherited the title of Count Palatine of Hungary, and left
    Bohemia for good, taking all the crowns with him but leaving the scraps of paper
    with numbers written upon them, shoved all jumbled up in the weighty carved wooden
    credenza against which he is seen leaning in that photograph. The exact number
    of hairs in his magnificent moustache never was calculated, more''s the pity.'
