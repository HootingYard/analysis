  text: 'On the tenth day of Christmas Old Halob gave to me

    Ten rusty nozzles,

    Nine paper sickbags,

    Eight tufts of bindweed,,

    Seven mordant herons,

    Six hideous bat gods,

    Ecto-oplasm!

    Four dead chaffinches,

    Three poptarts,

    Two cardboard pigs,

    And a viper, a shrew and a bee.'
