  text: '"And what should they know of potatoes, who only potatoes know?" asks Dobson,
    in the title of one of his pamphlets, which is sadly out of print. It is a dazzling
    tour de force, noted for containing an eerily accurate description of crinkle-cut
    oven chips, written before such things existed.

    It is worth noting that the dazzling nature of the pamphlet is less to do with
    the quality of Dobson''s prose, which might better be described, in this instance,
    as hysterical and incoherent, and more to do with the then fashionable far out
    groovy psychedelic typeface employed by Marigold Chew when setting the text. Indeed,
    so dazzling is the appearance of the multicoloured swirly maelstrom of type that
    one is advised to wear sunglasses when reading it, or attempting to read it. Peter
    Hitchens has claimed, not without reason, that Marigold Chew was probably "high
    on pot" when producing the pamphlet, but she also may have thought that its far
    out groovy psychedelic look would increase sales in "head shops" and free festivals
    and other such excresences of the era. If so, she was horribly mistaken, for "That
    Potato Pamphlet", as it is commonly known, sold only half a dozen copies in toto,
    and three of those went to a wandering proto-crusty who pitched his tent in Dobson''s
    back garden for the duration of the summer of love.

    The pamphleteer himself might also have been "high on pot" when he wrote the text,
    for as I said, his prose is hysterical and incoherent. A weedy wannabe Dobsonist
    would have tossed the pamphlet aside, or even set it on fire, but I am adamantine
    in my devotion to the great man, so I enrolled in a special study group. Each
    weekday evening for three whole years, we met in an abandoned pavilion to pore
    over the pamphlet, eight of us, trying as best we could to eke some sense from
    it. What follows, then, owes as much to the contributions of Messrs Clapper, Shrublack,
    Inspip, Squelch, Dalewinton, Boggis and Globb as to my own insights.

    Dobson seems to have conceived of the idea of the crinkle-cut oven chip as the
    ne plus ultra of space age food. This, he says, describing a then imaginary frozen
    sliver of reconstituted potato-based mush shaped with some sort of wiggly-shaped
    jig-slicer, will be the staple foodstuff of space travellers and cosmonauts as
    they venture through galaxies yet unknown. He asks if any alien beings they might
    meet would comprehend that the crinkle-cut oven chip and the ordinary potato,
    a tuberous vegetable buried in soil back on planet Earth, were in any way related
    to each other. And he answers "no" to that question. No matter, he asserts, how
    advanced and superintelligent the beings were, they would never be able to grasp
    the human ingenuity that turned the one into the other.

    Dobson then posits the idea that it is the potato that has evolved from the crinkle-cut
    oven chip, rather than vice versa, and in a prescient passage written some years
    before Stanley Kubrick''s film 2001 : A Space Odyssey (1968), he invents a scene
    where a primitive ape picks up a crinkle-cut oven chip and tosses it into the
    air, where--pfft!--it is suddenly transformed into a potato. Annoyingly, Dobson
    does not specify the variety of potato. Or perhaps he does, and we were simply
    incapable of deciphering a particularly far out groovy psychedelic section of
    the text.

    Quite what point he is trying to make with this topsy turvy twaddle is unclear,
    even when one is "high on pot". I speak not of my own experience but that of Messrs
    Squelch and Globb, who often huddled together in the corner of the abandoned pavilion
    before our study group meetings, indulging in what I think in some circles is
    known as "reefer madness".

    For all that, And what should they know of potatoes, who only potatoes know? is
    a fascinating curio. Dobson does actually answer the question posed in the title,
    but in doing so raises a blizzard of further questions, the answers to which perhaps
    will not become apparent until the true space age is upon us.'
