    On the twelfth day of Christmas Old Halob gave to me

    Twelve gormless orphans,

    Eleven cornflake cartons,

    Ten rusty nozzles,

    Nine paper sickbags,

    Eight tufts of bindweed,

    Seven mordant herons,

    Six hideous bat gods,

    Ecto-oplasm!

    Four dead chaffinches,

    Three poptarts,

    Two cardboard pigs,

    And a viper, a shrew and a bee.'
