  Over at The Dabbler this week, I consider that hallowed realm where poetry and cake
  collide. And that''s not all, for my ruminations lead me from poetry and cake to
  poetry and biscuits, all in just four brief paragraphs. Even the loveable Liverpudlian
  moptops get a mention. It''s all so exciting it''s enough to make an ant keel over
  and die.'
