  text: 'In a comment on my piece in today''s Dabbler, Jonathan Law very helpfully
    tells us that Rudyard Kipling was named after his parents'' favourite reservoir.
    It was on the banks of Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire, says Mr Law, that they met
    and courted and it was here, conceivably, that the poet was conceived. "Clearly,"
    he adds, "this name-your-child-after-a-favourite-reservoir business is an excellent
    custom and one that should be adopted by all who trust that their offspring will
    go on to literary immortality." I would go further, and suggest that it should
    be adopted by all, irrespective of any future literary achievement, or lack thereof.

    I hesitate to say that the government should take a lead on this, but some kind
    of concerted national effort will be needed. The first step will be a voluntary
    agreement among publishers to make bonfires piled high with copies of all their
    existing "baby names" books and restock the shelves of our bookshops and libraries
    with "reservoir names" compendia. It will probably be a good idea, however, to
    retain the current cover designs, usually involving photographs of cute gurgling
    infants, in order to reinforce the message.

    That should be simple enough, but the next stage may prove more difficult. Before
    we can proudly claim to live in a land where all newborn babies are named after
    their parents'' favourite reservoirs, those parents will first of all actually
    have to have a favourite reservoir. It is surprising just how many people do not.

    As you know, I always like to back up my assertions with evidence, even if that
    evidence comes from what our Belgian pals call Het Internet rather than from ancient
    dusty leather-bound books. In this case, I searched Google for "my favourite reservoir",
    eliciting just 675 results, many of which can be discarded because they refer,
    on closer inspection, to "my favourite reservoir dog", which is a different matter
    entirely. Restricting my search to sites based in the UK, which after all is the
    land where I want my programme to be put into effect, yields a mere 44 results,
    though I am pleased to say there do not seem to be any dogs clogging up and thus
    distorting the data. But this hardly bodes well, does it?

    That is why I speak of concerted national effort, and why our community education
    hubs, as I think they are called, have such an important part to play. Before
    prospective parents can choose a favourite reservoir, they will need to familiarise
    themselves with as many reservoirs as possible. And while it is one thing to read
    lists of reservoir names in the new-style baby name books, nothing beats direct
    experience. That is why I recommend compulsory reservoir-bank picnicking opportunities
    for youngsters, even before they are old enough to procreate. It is to be hoped
    that by spending as much leisure time as possible hanging around on the banks
    of reservoirs, when the time comes to go a-wooing and a-courting, no other possible
    location will even enter their little heads.

    Given the vagaries of British weather, it is perhaps too much to hope that all
    babies in future will be conceived upon the banks of reservoirs, as it is rumoured
    was the case with Rudyard Kipling. Nevertheless, a few judicious and sensitively-worded
    guidelines could be incorporated into sex education lessons, and perhaps some
    semi-permanent tents could be erected on the banks of our reservoirs, supplied
    with mattresses and warm blankets. In order that they do not spoil the view, such
    tents should probably be concealed behind clumps of reservoir-bank shrubbery,
    where that is present, or otherwise camouflaged, where it is not.

    This seems to me an eminently practical plan of campaign, and one which will reinvigorate
    the national spirit. In the meantime, any prospective parents reading this can
    make a start by studying this list of reservoirs and making due arrangements to
    visit each of them in turn. That way you can plump for your favourite before your
    squalling infant comes triumphantly into the world.
