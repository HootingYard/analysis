  text: "\nI was dismayed to note that there exists a Wikipedia section entitled \u201C\
    Falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors\u201D. Dammit!, I exclaimed, aloud,\
    \ cursing that someone, somewhere, had preempted precisely the title of the PhD\
    \ thesis on which I have been working for years.\nIt was towards the end of the\
    \ last century, when I was mentally flailing around seeking a suitable topic for\
    \ my doctorate, that I happened one day to wander into a theatre, or rather, a\
    \ \u201Ctheatre space\u201D. There was no stage as such, but rather a \u201Cperformative\
    \ zone\u201D, almost but not quite identical to a dentist's waiting room, which\
    \ is where I thought I was going. In this \u201Czone\u201D, several persons were\
    \ disporting themselves in mysterious ways, some of them physically flailing around\
    \ much as I was flailing mentally. Perhaps it was that sense of connection which\
    \ made me pause, and sit, and watch, intently, a performance I might otherwise\
    \ have dismissed as tomfoolery. The participants cut capers and jumped about and\
    \ shimmied and threw somersaults and adopted ridiculous postures, and I had absolutely\
    \ no idea what was going on, but I was sufficiently intrigued that, when it was\
    \ all over, some hours later, I approached one of the cavorting persons and asked\
    \ him what it was I had been watching.\n\u201CPant pant pant,\u201D he panted,\
    \ then added \u201CWe are in rehearsals for our adaptation of Wolfgang Peterson's\
    \ 1981 epic war film Das Boot, interpreted through the medium of dance.\u201D\n\
    I had not seen this film, so I cannot comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation,\
    \ but I had been struck by the fact that, at certain points, some of the dancers\
    \ had portrayed their characters quite negatively. One of them scowled a lot.\
    \ Another seemed a bit weedy. A third had contrived to move his body in the manner\
    \ of a malevolent beetle. I was sure such behaviour had not been at all common\
    \ on World War Two submarines. There and then I had an epiphany, and I realised\
    \ that the falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors would be the perfect subject\
    \ for my doctoral thesis.\nI hurried home and set to work. Over the following\
    \ decade, I put under intense scrutiny each and every portrayal of U-boat sailors\
    \ I could track down, in films, plays, novels, poems, pop songs, television programmes,\
    \ operas, operettas, opera bouffes, ballets, even in World War Two Battle Re-enactment\
    \ Society weekend workshops.\nItem\_: Submariner Second Class Horst Krumbein in\
    \ The Loathsome U-Boat Sailor, a \u201Cmonologue for voice and improv jazz ensemble\u201D\
    \ by Tadaaki Sirinuntananon (1968). Krumbein is depicted as sweaty, myopic, plagued\
    \ by boils and utterly lacking in social skills.\nItem\_: Submariner First Class\
    \ Viggo Beckenbauer in The U-Boat Sailor With The Shameful Past, an award-winning\
    \ drama by radical playwright Geoff Beard (1973). In the opening minutes of the\
    \ play, we are led to believe that Beckenbauer is a heroic figure. Tall, blond,\
    \ and impossibly handsome, he strides about the stage while his crewmates gasp\
    \ and swoon at just how fantastic he is. But then comes the thunderclap, when\
    \ it is revealed that, back in D\xFCsseldorf before becoming a submariner, he\
    \ had been convicted of bus fare evasion, forging a dog licence, and half a dozen\
    \ axe murders. \u201CI joined the navy to forget\u2026 to forget,\u201D he pleads\
    \ in an emotionally wrenching speech, but his crewmates, who it must be said are\
    \ not subject to falsely negative portrayal by Beard, will have none of it, and\
    \ they await calm seas and the absence of enemy submarines to surface, and build\
    \ a pyre on top of the hull, and bind Beckenbauer to a post atop the pyre, and\
    \ they burn him while dancing in circles, brandishing flaming torches, and chanting.\n\
    Item\_: Captain Hans Gruber in the film Die Hard In A Submarine (2004). To be\
    \ honest, I ought not pick out the captain as the only negatively portrayed U-boat\
    \ sailor in this blockbuster, for the entire crew is made up of black-hearted\
    \ scalliwags and ruffians who take pleasure in stamping their big hefty boots\
    \ on small scurrying mammals, and similar enormities.\nI think that is enough\
    \ items to be going on with. The point is to demonstrate just how thorough my\
    \ research had been, the better so you can grasp the degree of dismay I suffered\
    \ when I thought someone else had not only been ploughing the same academic furrow\
    \ as I was, but had gone ahead and posted their findings on what our Belgian pals\
    \ call Het Internet.\nImagine my relief, then, when I actually looked up the Wikipedia\
    \ entry headed Falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors and found that it\
    \ was merely a 77-word paragraph within the piece about the film U-571 (Jonathan\
    \ Mostow, 2000). As with Das Boot, I have not seen this film either, in spite\
    \ of my indefatigable research. Clearly my work is not yet done."
