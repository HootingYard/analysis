    I was dismayed to note that there exists a Wikipedia section entitled "Falsely
    negative portrayal of U-boat sailors". Dammit!, I exclaimed, aloud, cursing that
    someone, somewhere, had preempted precisely the title of the PhD thesis on which
    I have been working for years.

    It was towards the end of the last century, when I was mentally flailing around
    seeking a suitable topic for my doctorate, that I happened one day to wander into
    a theatre, or rather, a "theatre space". There was no stage as such, but rather
    a "performative zone", almost but not quite identical to a dentist''s waiting
    room, which is where I thought I was going. In this "zone", several persons were
    disporting themselves in mysterious ways, some of them physically flailing around
    much as I was flailing mentally. Perhaps it was that sense of connection which
    made me pause, and sit, and watch, intently, a performance I might otherwise have
    dismissed as tomfoolery. The participants cut capers and jumped about and shimmied
    and threw somersaults and adopted ridiculous postures, and I had absolutely no
    idea what was going on, but I was sufficiently intrigued that, when it was all
    over, some hours later, I approached one of the cavorting persons and asked him
    what it was I had been watching.

    "Pant pant pant," he panted, then added "We are in rehearsals for our adaptation
    of Wolfgang Peterson''s 1981 epic war film Das Boot, interpreted through the medium
    of dance."

    I had not seen this film, so I cannot comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation,
    but I had been struck by the fact that, at certain points, some of the dancers
    had portrayed their characters quite negatively. One of them scowled a lot. Another
    seemed a bit weedy. A third had contrived to move his body in the manner of a
    malevolent beetle. I was sure such behaviour had not been at all common on World
    War Two submarines. There and then I had an epiphany, and I realised that the
    falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors would be the perfect subject for
    my doctoral thesis.

    I hurried home and set to work. Over the following decade, I put under intense
    scrutiny each and every portrayal of U-boat sailors I could track down, in films,
    plays, novels, poems, pop songs, television programmes, operas, operettas, opera
    bouffes, ballets, even in World War Two Battle Re-enactment Society weekend workshops.

    Item : Submariner Second Class Horst Krumbein in The Loathsome U-Boat Sailor,
    a "monologue for voice and improv jazz ensemble" by Tadaaki Sirinuntananon (1968).
    Krumbein is depicted as sweaty, myopic, plagued by boils and utterly lacking in
    social skills.

    Item : Submariner First Class Viggo Beckenbauer in The U-Boat Sailor With The
    Shameful Past, an award-winning drama by radical playwright Geoff Beard (1973).
    In the opening minutes of the play, we are led to believe that Beckenbauer is
    a heroic figure. Tall, blond, and impossibly handsome, he strides about the stage
    while his crewmates gasp and swoon at just how fantastic he is. But then comes
    the thunderclap, when it is revealed that, back in Dusseldorf before becoming
    a submariner, he had been convicted of bus fare evasion, forging a dog licence,
    and half a dozen axe murders. "I joined the navy to forget... to forget," he pleads
    in an emotionally wrenching speech, but his crewmates, who it must be said are
    not subject to falsely negative portrayal by Beard, will have none of it, and
    they await calm seas and the absence of enemy submarines to surface, and build
    a pyre on top of the hull, and bind Beckenbauer to a post atop the pyre, and they
    burn him while dancing in circles, brandishing flaming torches, and chanting.

    Item : Captain Hans Gruber in the film Die Hard In A Submarine (2004). To be honest,
    I ought not pick out the captain as the only negatively portrayed U-boat sailor
    in this blockbuster, for the entire crew is made up of black-hearted scalliwags
    and ruffians who take pleasure in stamping their big hefty boots on small scurrying
    mammals, and similar enormities.

    I think that is enough items to be going on with. The point is to demonstrate
    just how thorough my research had been, the better so you can grasp the degree
    of dismay I suffered when I thought someone else had not only been ploughing the
    same academic furrow as I was, but had gone ahead and posted their findings on
    what our Belgian pals call Het Internet.

    Imagine my relief, then, when I actually looked up the Wikipedia entry headed
    Falsely negative portrayal of U-boat sailors and found that it was merely a 77-word
    paragraph within the piece about the film U-571 (Jonathan Mostow, 2000). As with
    Das Boot, I have not seen this film either, in spite of my indefatigable research.
    Clearly my work is not yet done.'
