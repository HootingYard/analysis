  text: 'Today would have been my father''s 87th birthday. In a change of tone from
    the usual Hooting Yard guff, here is a remembrance of him. Following Georges Perec''s
    Je me souviens (1978) and Gilbert Adair''s Memories (1986), I have written, in
    no particular order, a set of sentences each beginning "I remember..." There are
    fifty-eight in all, one for each year of his life. I wrote them at one sitting,
    as they bubbled to the surface. On another day I might write a different list
    of memories.

    1. I remember he smoked a cheap brand of cigarettes called Carlton Premium.

    2. I remember the Evening Standard ringing him up after he made disparaging remarks
    about Dr Rhodes Boyson, though I don''t remember the context, or how the paper
    knew.

    3. I remember his love of crime fiction.

    4. I remember his love of football, and that--uniquely among aficionados of the
    game?--he did not support any particular team.

    5. I remember his hip-flask of Scotch.

    6. I remember seeing him cry only once, when talking about his father.

    7. I remember him using the nickname "Brucie" for my mother.

    8. I remember when his choice of hat convinced some of our neighbours that he
    was a Russian spy.

    9. I remember he read The Guardian and the Morning Star.

    10. I remember he always called The Guardian The Manchester Guardian

    11. I remember him wandering around the house with a tea-towel over his shoulder
    calling out "Any more pots?"

    12. I remember he called Ready-Brek Fairex.

    13. I remember precisely the style of his spectacle-frames.

    14. I remember the way he referred to Norman St John Stevas as "Ste-VASS".

    15. I remember that he subscribed to a Soviet propaganda magazine called Sputnik.

    16. I remember him dusting individually the books on the bookshelves.

    17. I remember his habit of cutting off the corners of dust-jackets where the
    price was shown.

    18. I remember him saying "The whole point is..."

    19. I remember his afternoon naps on the sofa.

    20. I remember his loud snoring

    21. I remember him saying "It''s like Blackpool Illuminations" when a light was
    left on in an empty room.

    22. I remember his psoriasis.

    23. I remember him telling me that when he played football as a young man he was
    nicknamed "Twinkletoes".

    24. I remember his hatred of Reginald Maudling but also his insistence, when Maudling
    died, that one should never speak ill of the dead.

    25. I remember his sentimentality.

    26. I remember that Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942) was his favourite film.

    27. I remember him taking me to a Manchester United match (at Upton Park?) and
    how his Manchester accent became unconsciously exaggerated when speaking to other
    fans.

    28. I remember him saying "daft as a Toc H Lamp".

    29. I remember his puritanical streak.

    30. I remember his dismissal of anything other than the plainest foods as "foreign
    muck".

    31. I remember him telling me how he had gone to the Chinese embassy to be given
    a free copy of Mao''s Little Red Book (which I still have).

    32. I remember his fierce attachment to his mother.

    33. I remember him polishing his shoes.

    34. I remember that the bottle of Guinness he drank with his evening meal was
    "medicinal".

    35. I remember kicking a football around in the garden with him.

    36. I remember when he wore a shirt with a collar that made him look like a priest.

    37. I remember his collection of cigarette cards.

    38. I remember the time he bought a hideous plastic rose in a glass globe as a
    birthday gift for my mother.

    49. I remember his infuriating habit of tidying that which was already tidy.

    50. I remember his insistence that one should always have an up-to-date atlas.

    51. I remember, when I boasted that I had dodged my bus fare, how he reprimanded
    me for my dishonesty, his clarity about right and wrong.

    52. I remember his supper of boiled egg and bread mashed into a pulp.

    53. I remember how he hated Monty Python but loved Fawlty Towers.

    54. I remember how he loved the Carry On films.

    55.I remember his postcard collection.

    56. I remember his big florid curly handwriting.

    57. I remember that he always wore a vest under his shirt.

    58. I remember clearly the last time I saw him, sitting at his desk, reading the
    paper, drinking whisky, on the morning of Monday 16 May 1983. He died two days
    later.'
