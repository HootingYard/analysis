    Skippy The Bush Kangaroo might so easily have been called Googie. The eponymous
    marsupial heroine of the Australian television series, which ran from 1966 to
    1968 and is still shown regularly on Iranian state television, was the brainchild
    of John McCallum (1918-2010), the husband of the late lamented Googie Withers
    (1917-2011). I am not for a moment suggesting that McCallum compared his wife
    to a kangaroo, but surely, when he was casting around in his mind for a name for
    his bouncy outback heroine, and he was thinking of something ending in an "-ee"
    sound, he must have considered Googie. I don''t know this for sure, but it seems
    at least plausible, doesn''t it?

    It may be that, at breakfast one morning, the successful theatre and film actor
    and television producer, who served in the Australian Imperial Force in New Guinea
    during World War Two, looked over at his wife and said something along the lines
    of "You know, darling, this intelligent kangaroo that will be the heroine of my
    television series for children, how about calling her Googie?"

    Googie, whose birth name was Georgette, may have been amused, and chuckled, or
    alternately irritated, and chucked the peel of her grapefruit across the breakfast
    table at her husband. We do not know, and alas they are both now cold in their
    graves, so we cannot ask them. But a scene like this may well have been played
    out in the breakfast room of their beautifully-appointed Sydney home one morning
    in the nineteen-sixties. I am assuming it was beautifully-appointed. I would like
    to think it was.

    If Googie had been amused, and chuckled, it might be that, later, she had second
    thoughts, and told her husband not to go ahead with "Googie The Bush Kangaroo"
    but to choose a different name. If, on the other hand, she had been irritated
    and chucked the peel of her grapefruit at him, he would probably have said something
    like, "I was only kidding, darling!", and reassured her with a uxorious kiss.
    Depending on the size of the Withers-McCallum breakfast table, he may have been
    able to accomplish this by raising himself slightly from his chair and leaning
    forwards. It is more likely, I think, for a successful couple living in a beautifully-appointed
    home, that their breakfast table would have been a tad too large for such a manoeuvre,
    and John McCallum would have had to stand up and walk a few paces towards where
    Googie Withers sat. But this is mere conjecture.

    As is, I have to say, the possibility that Skippy, the bush kangaroo at the centre
    of this domestic maelstrom, had already been named Skippy by her keepers at the
    Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park where the series was mostly filmed, if that was
    indeed where she lived when not working. Having cast the kangaroo, a wild female
    Eastern Grey, for whatever qualities she had that made her suitable, McCallum,
    or more likely a member of the production team delegated to the task, will have
    asked the keepers the name of the marsupial. "Skippy," they would have said (not,
    of course, "Googie"). Thus the series title may have been a fait accompli. I am
    sure there is documentation in the archives of the Australian Nine Network television
    channel, or indeed among the paperwork of the Withers-McCallum estate, which could
    shed some light on this. "Skippy" does seem to be a fortuitously telegenic name
    for a marsupial heroine, and it is equally likely that the kangaroo was specially
    renamed for the series. Hence the possibility of that breakfast table conversation.

    On a personal note, I should add that, though I have no memory of ever watching
    an episode of Skippy The Bush Kangaroo, I am certain that I must have done so,
    at least once or twice, when it was shown on British television, long long ago.
    The same goes for Flipper, about a dolphin, and Daktari, which I recall featured
    a lion, or lions. Clearly there was a sixties fad for children''s television shows
    about wild animals, of both land and sea. One wonders if anybody--John McCallum?
    Googie Withers?--ever had the idea of bringing Skippy and Flipper and the Daktari
    lion together, in a special show, a triumvirate of beasts setting the world to
    rights, like a trio of superheroes.'
