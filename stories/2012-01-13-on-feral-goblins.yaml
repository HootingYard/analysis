  text: "The other day, as I was wending my way along the city streets, I saw, on\
    \ the back of a passing bus, an advertisement for a product called Feroglobin.\n\
    \nI have since learned that this is an iron supplement for the formation of haemoglobin.\
    \ But it seems to me that a moving vehicle is not an advisable place to advertise\
    \ it, for one glances at the poster, and before one has a chance to read it properly,\
    \ away growls the bus, out of the range of one's vision, or at least of my, myopic,\
    \ vision. I would have liked more time to scrutinise the advertisement, for on\
    \ that first glance I misread it as Ferogoblin. I then spent rather a lot of time\
    \ wondering (a) what in the name of heaven a Ferogoblin might be, and (b) why\
    \ it was advertising itself on the back of a bus. My mind reeled.\nReaders may\
    \ recall that almost exactly a year ago I wrote here about the official colour\
    \ coding system for goblins. To recap briefly, the agreed categories are as follows:\n\
    Red\_: Hobgoblins.\nOrange\_: Fat Goblins.\nYellow\_: Pilfering Goblins.\nGreen\_\
    : Teutonic Forest Goblins.\nBlue\_: Goblins found under sinks.\nIndigo\_: Wet\
    \ Goblins.\nViolet\_: All other goblins not classified above.\nAccording to this\
    \ list, Ferogoblins\u2014which I take to be a contraction of Feral Goblins\u2014\
    must be included in the \u201Call other goblins not classified above\u201D subset,\
    \ unless of course there are goblins which are both feral and hob, or feral and\
    \ fat, or feral and given to pilfering, or feral and dwelling in Teutonic forests,\
    \ or feral and found under sinks, or feral and wet. I suppose such goblins might\
    \ well exist. But for the sake of argument, and because it is tidier, let us assume\
    \ there is a discrete type of goblin known as the feral or fero-goblin. Logically,\
    \ then, it must fall within the \u201Call other goblins\u201D category, which\
    \ would mean code violet. Yet intuition, and indeed common sense, tell us that\
    \ violet is not at all the most suitable colour for a feral goblin. In fact it\
    \ seems utterly inappropriate, the sort of colour one might only apply to a feral\
    \ goblin in a world turned upside down, a topsy turvy world of chaos and confusion.\n\
    This insight leads us to the startling conclusion that feral goblins must therefore\
    \ be somehow outwith the known colour spectrum. Imagine that! I told you my mind\
    \ was already reeling, and now it reeled even more. It perhaps also accounts for\
    \ their feral nature, that they may be untamed and prone to havoc on account of\
    \ being set apart from the normal run of goblins. Such alienation can cause low\
    \ self-esteem, as we have learned from many addle-brained social psychologists\
    \ in recent decades. What could be more damaging to a sense of goblin selfhood\
    \ than to be forever banished, by one's very nature, from the visible colour spectrum?\
    \ It is a harsh fate indeed, so no wonder they turn feral.\nHowever, I was clearly\
    \ thinking along the right tracks, because so terrible a social stigma could well\
    \ account for feral goblins advertising their existence on the backs of buses.\
    \ It is one way to get yourself noticed, as the producers of several dire West\
    \ End musicals have discovered. But an advertisement on the back of a bus does\
    \ not come cheap, and one wonders how the feral goblins raised the necessary cash.\
    \ My guess is that they were in cahoots with the pilfering goblins (code yellow),\
    \ who diverted a proportion of their ill-gotten gains to the feral goblins in\
    \ return for the Lord knows what maleficent favours. Being feral, the feral goblins\
    \ may have agreed to, for example, gnaw and slash at and scratch and screech at\
    \ innocent passers-by, terrorising them into a state of paralysing fear so that\
    \ the pilfering goblins could come leaping down from the rooftops and make away\
    \ with their wallets and purses and cashboxes. No doubt the two groups would then\
    \ meet in a secluded goblins\u2019 nest to divvy up the proceeds.\nThis does raise\
    \ the question of the bus operators\u2019 willingness to accept advertising on\
    \ the backs of its buses from such nefarious clients. Or, let us say, it would\
    \ raise that question were it not the case that I misread the advertisement, which\
    \ turned out to have not a jot to do with goblins whatsoever. You live and learn."
