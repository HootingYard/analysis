  text: 'Sebald''s point, it seemed to me, was simple. That precision in writing fiction--especially
    in writing fiction--is an absolutely fundamental value. He summed up by saying
    that if you look carefully you can find problems in all writers, or almost all
    (Kafka being an exception; especially, he told us, if you look at the reports
    he wrote for the Workers'' Accident Insurance Institute!).

    from Luke Williams'' essay "A Watch on Each Wrist: Twelve Seminars with W.G. Sebald",
    discussed, with excerpts, here.'
