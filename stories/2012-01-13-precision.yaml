  text: "Sebald's point, it seemed to me, was simple. That precision in writing fiction\u2014\
    especially in writing fiction\u2014is an absolutely fundamental value. He summed\
    \ up by saying that if you look carefully you can find problems in all writers,\
    \ or almost all (Kafka being an exception; especially, he told us, if you look\
    \ at the reports he wrote for the Workers\u2019 Accident Insurance Institute!).\n\
    from Luke Williams\u2019 essay \u201CA Watch on Each Wrist: Twelve Seminars with\
    \ W.G. Sebald\u201D, discussed, with excerpts, here."
