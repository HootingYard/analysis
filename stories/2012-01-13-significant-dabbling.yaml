    This week in The Dabbler I get misty-eyed and nostalgic about something or other.
    What I might be misty-eyed and nostalgic about is the fact that the piece was
    written over a quarter of a century ago, which is a somewhat unnerving thought.
    I did not know then what the piece was "about", and in the succeeding twenty-five
    years I have come no closer to grasping the world-shuddering significance lurking
    within its two hundred and twenty-two words. But world-shuddering significance
    there is, of that we can be sure. Do let me know if you can work out what it is,
    because I still haven''t got a clue.

    ADDENDUM : I have changed two of those two hundred and twenty-two words for this
    twenty-first century version, but the meaning, whatever it might be, is not altered
    in any dramatic, or even undramatic, manner.'
