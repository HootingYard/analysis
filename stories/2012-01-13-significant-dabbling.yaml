  text: "\nThis week in The Dabbler I get misty-eyed and nostalgic about something\
    \ or other. What I might be misty-eyed and nostalgic about is the fact that the\
    \ piece was written over a quarter of a century ago, which is a somewhat unnerving\
    \ thought. I did not know then what the piece was \u201Cabout\u201D, and in the\
    \ succeeding twenty-five years I have come no closer to grasping the world-shuddering\
    \ significance lurking within its two hundred and twenty-two words. But world-shuddering\
    \ significance there is, of that we can be sure. Do let me know if you can work\
    \ out what it is, because I still haven't got a clue.\nADDENDUM\_: I have changed\
    \ two of those two hundred and twenty-two words for this twenty-first century\
    \ version, but the meaning, whatever it might be, is not altered in any dramatic,\
    \ or even undramatic, manner."
