  text: "Unaccountably, I missed by two years the centenary of the replacement of\
    \ tin by aluminium in the manufacture of what we still call tin foil. As so often,\
    \ we have boffins in Switzerland to thank for this innovation, namely Dr. Lauber,\
    \ Neher & Cie., who opened the world's first aluminium foil rolling plant in Emmishofen\
    \ in 1910. For those of you, and I know there are many, who like to keep track\
    \ of these things, Emmishofen is in the canton of Thurgau, or Thurgovia, in ancient\
    \ times the home of the people of the Pfyn culture, who apparently kept large\
    \ numbers of pigs.\nAs I say, I neglected to mention the centenary at the time,\
    \ and I know that many readers will have been drumming their fingers impatiently\
    \ for the past two years, wondering when I am going to get round to telling you\
    \ what to do with all that tin foil you have accumulated in your kitchen drawer.\
    \ Well, I am delighted to say that at long last I can turn my attention to this\
    \ splendidly versatile material. Just bear in mind that when I talk about tin\
    \ foil I mean aluminium foil, and I am not expecting you to try to track down\
    \ a stash of the old tin stuff, even if there is any still available, which I\
    \ suspect there is not.\nThe best thing you can do with your tin foil is to fashion\
    \ for yourself a conical tin foil hat. It is important that you make a cone shape,\
    \ rather than trying to mould the tin foil into the approximate shape of, say,\
    \ a Homburg or a trilby or a stovepipe hat. Though the wonder of tin foil is that\
    \ all these hat types could quite easily be made, you must stick to the cone.\
    \ In part, this is in homage to Jimmy Goddard and the copper cone he used for\
    \ daily communication with space people. But do not jump to the conclusion that\
    \ your tin foil cone hat will help you to talk to space people. It won't. Nor\
    \ will it protect you from weird unearthly menacing electromagnetic rays and beams\
    \ and invisible hoo-hah. If such phenomena exist, and can dislodge and jumble\
    \ and even control the innards of your brain, they are hardly likely to be dissuaded\
    \ by a sheet of tin foil, are they? Nonetheless, when forming your surplus tin\
    \ foil into a hat, it is well to pay tribute to Jimmy Goddard and the STAR Fellowship,\
    \ for as Jesus said, \u201CA prophet is not without honour, but in his own country,\
    \ and among his own kin, and in his own house. And he could there do no mighty\
    \ work\u201D (Mark 6\_: 4\u20135).\nBut you can do mighty work, wearing your conical\
    \ tin foil hat. I am thinking specifically of amateur dramatics. Some might call\
    \ that leisure, rather than work, but believe you me, if you put your heart and\
    \ soul into it, amateur dramatics can feel like work, and mighty work at that.\n\
    There are several parts in the repertoire where the wearing of a conical tin foil\
    \ hat is absolutely essential. Consider, for example, Old Nahamkin in The Man\
    \ Who Came To Dinner In A Shiny Pointy Hat by Belper Frisson. It is not, admittedly,\
    \ a very big part, and for most of acts two and three the character lies apparently\
    \ dead on the floor of the parlour while all hell breaks loose around him, but\
    \ just think of the applause that always greets his entrance, and that ringing\
    \ line \u201CHello, I have come to dinner, and I am wearing a shiny pointy conical\
    \ hat\u201D. It is also worth bearing in mind that Old Nahamkin gets to keep the\
    \ hat on, even after he is poisoned and stabbed and shot by the vengeful Cassandra,\
    \ he keeps it on throughout acts two and three, lying motionless on the parlour\
    \ floor, and at no time is the hat snatched by one of the other characters, who\
    \ gets to wear it instead,\nThat does of course happen in one of the other great\
    \ conical tin foil hat parts, the squalid mute in Pepinstow's An Inspector Wearing\
    \ A Shiny Pointy Hat Calls. The squalid mute, of course, turns out to be a police\
    \ inspector, a revelation somewhat less revelatory than Pepinstow intended, given\
    \ his cack-handed way of giving the game away in the play's title. But that need\
    \ not concern you. You will just need to make sure, as the curtain falls at the\
    \ end of each performance, that you retrieve your conical tin foil hat from the\
    \ actor playing Sergeant Piffle, who snatches the hat from atop the inspector's\
    \ head in that riveting scene at the end of act four, and wears it himself in\
    \ a clever ploy to foil Jasper's attempt to gain Nitty's inheritance. It might\
    \ be a creaking plot device, but whenever I have attended an amateur troupe's\
    \ performance of the play it has never failed to bring the house down.\nThere\
    \ are other parts, in some really tiptop dramas, where the wearing of your conical\
    \ tin foil hat is not actually called for in the script, but adds a certain something\
    \ to the character. You might get into arguments, or even fisticuffs, with the\
    \ director, if they are the type of director averse to the disporting of unnecessary\
    \ conical tin foil hats. If this is the case, the best thing to do is to say that\
    \ you are under attack from weird unearthly menacing electromagnetic rays and\
    \ beams and invisible hoo-hah and must wear the conical tin foil hat as protection.\
    \ Most theatre directors, professional or amateur, will succumb to such a protest,\
    \ particularly if it is voiced in a wild and high-pitched screech.\nIf you loathe\
    \ the very idea of amateur dramatics, you can still find advantageous opportunities\
    \ for the wearing of your conical tin foil hat. Promenading, loitering, and hiking\
    \ are all suitable activities, particularly the latter, particularly in the rain,\
    \ particularly if it is torrential. There is nothing quite like the sound of the\
    \ incessant pinging of water on metal, as you hike in your conical tin foil hat\
    \ through a teeming downpour."
