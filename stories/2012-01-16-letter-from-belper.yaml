  text: 'A letter plops on to my desk from Tim Belp.

    Dear Mr Key, I noticed, in yesterday''s essay on tin foil, that you ascribed authorship
    of the play The Man Who Came To Dinner In A Shiny Pointy Hat to a certain Belper
    Frisson. Well, the name means nothing to me, because I am just a simple country
    person and a stranger to the sophisticated delights of theatreland. But I can
    tell you that in my neck of the woods--that is, Belper--what we call a "Belper
    frisson" is that little pang of excitement one gets when, having left our lovely
    Derbyshire town to go elsewhere on an errand, one arrives back, on the train,
    and steps on to the platform of Belper railway station, home at last. If you have
    never been to Belper, may I recommend a visit? Not being a native, you will be
    unlikely to feel a "Belper frisson" upon arrival, but you may nevertheless experience
    a thrill when you learn that you are in the birthplace of swarfega, manufactured
    by Deb Ltd in Belper since its invention by Audley Bowdler Williamson in 1947.
    Passionately yours, Tim Belp.'
