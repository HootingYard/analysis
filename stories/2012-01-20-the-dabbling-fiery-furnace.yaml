    If you find yourself at a loose end, why not gather some pals and reenact an important
    and exciting scene from the Old Testament? Full instructions can be found in my
    cupboard at The Dabbler. Please note that Mr Key takes no responsibility whatsoever
    in the event that you find yourself burned to a crisp and requiring a lengthy
    spell in a clinic.'
