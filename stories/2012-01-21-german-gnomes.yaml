  text: "I am indebted to Mike Jennings for further useful illustrative material from\
    \ The Universe or The Infinitely Great and the Infinitely Little by F A Pouchet\
    \ M.D. (1882). In this picture, we see gnomes of German legend laying bare the\
    \ skeleton of an ichthyosaurus. As Mr Jennings so rightly says, \u201Cthe mind\
    \ boggles\u2026 well, mine doesn't boggle so much these days, but yours might\u201D\
