  text: 'I am indebted to Mike Jennings for further useful illustrative material from
    The Universe or The Infinitely Great and the Infinitely Little by F A Pouchet
    M.D. (1882). In this picture, we see gnomes of German legend laying bare the skeleton
    of an ichthyosaurus. As Mr Jennings so rightly says, "the mind boggles... well,
    mine doesn''t boggle so much these days, but yours might".
