text: "Rummaging around on the BBC iPlayer, I discovered a programme new to me, a\
  \ studio discussion show called The Big Questions. Well, I'm not sure about the\
  \ size of the questions, but some of the answers made me laugh.\nAsked to name a\
  \ single coherent objective of the Occupy movement, one of the guests replied \u201C\
  We're against all the injustice in the world\u201D. He sounded like a plaintive\
  \ seven-year-old whining that life isn't fair. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. For\
  \ some unexplained reason he was wearing one of those silly masks, so for all I\
  \ know perhaps he was an upset seven-year-old.\nA bit later on a woman who appeared\
  \ to be something to do with the Church of England opined that the government should\
  \ be responsible for origami.\nI think this show may be unmissable."
