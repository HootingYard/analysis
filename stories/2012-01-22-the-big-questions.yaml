  text: 'Rummaging around on the BBC iPlayer, I discovered a programme new to me,
    a studio discussion show called The Big Questions. Well, I''m not sure about the
    size of the questions, but some of the answers made me laugh.

    Asked to name a single coherent objective of the Occupy movement, one of the guests
    replied "We''re against all the injustice in the world". He sounded like a plaintive
    seven-year-old whining that life isn''t fair. Perhaps I''m being too harsh. For
    some unexplained reason he was wearing one of those silly masks, so for all I
    know perhaps he was an upset seven-year-old.

    A bit later on a woman who appeared to be something to do with the Church of England
    opined that the government should be responsible for origami.

    I think this show may be unmissable.'
