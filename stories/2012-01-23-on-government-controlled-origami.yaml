  text: 'What on earth was she blathering on about, that vicar in the studio audience
    of The Big Questions who said that the government ought to be responsible for
    origami? At least, I assume she was a vicar. She was dressed like a vicar, with
    a vicar''s dog collar, but it is always possible that she was an impostor vicar,
    deliberately or inadvertently. As I recalled in my fifty-eight memories of my
    father, he was occasionally mistaken for a man of the cloth due to an injudicious
    choice of 1960s shirtwear (memory number thirty-six).

    Vicar or no, origami was one item in a list she recited, the other items on which
    I have forgotten. She topped it off with "the government should be responsible
    for these things!" I have added an exclamation mark there to give some idea of
    the heat of passion in which this declaration was made.

    It''s a moot point whether this is a utopian or dystopian vision. Perhaps she
    was harking back to Gordon Brown''s ill-fated "government of all the talents"--goats--and
    took it too literally. If a government was to contain all the talents, logically
    one such talent would be the ability to fold paper in intricate oriental fashion.
    Thus there ought to be a Ministry of Origami & Associated Paper-Folding, with
    a Secretary of State supported by junior ministers and private secretaries and
    an army of civil servants. Five-year plans for the development of origami on our
    shores would smack too much of Stalinism, but such bonkersness is camouflaged
    nowadays by different jargon. Plans to roll out the origami stakeholder consultancy
    initiative on a region-by-region basis amount to much the same thing as Uncle
    Joe''s madcap schemes, but sound a little less megalomaniac.

    Would origami become compulsory? Would each citizen have to set aside, say, half
    an hour per day to fold a sheet of A4 into the shape of an ostrich? Surely that
    is not what the vicar had in mind. Think of the sheer increase in the amount of
    waste paper, as the more cack-handed among the citizenry faffed about, using up
    sheet after sheet of A4 in abortive and misshapen attempts to make a half-way
    decent, or at least recognisable, origami ostrich.

    If, on the other hand, origami were to remain, as it is now, voluntary, what would
    be the government''s role? We are already cajoled, through advertisements and
    leaflets and publicity campaigns, to make sure we eat five portions of fruit and
    vegetables a day, but as far as I am aware there is not a dedicated band of fruit
    and vegetable police who will place us under arrest if we fail to comply. So maybe
    the Secretary of State at MOAPF would content him- or herself with mere hectoring
    and lecturing, poster campaigns, television adverts, mass mailings and the like.
    Indeed, one advantage of having a leaflet about origami plop through your letterbox
    would be that the leaflet itself could be folded, intricately, orientally, into
    the shape of a sparrow.

    But I don''t know. The problem with such initiatives is that a change in government
    can lead not just to different priorities but to complete U-turns. Imagine that
    you have been persuaded, through relentless harrying, to eat your five fruits
    and vegetables each day while setting aside half an hour to do some intricate
    oriental paper-folding. All is well with the world, and you have slotted happily
    into your routine. Then, inevitably, there is a general election, a new government
    takes the reins of power, and the new Secretary of State for Origami and Associated
    Paper-Folding strides into the ministry on their first morning. Bright-eyed, dedicated,
    and power-crazed, the new bod might decide that, instead of encouraging origami
    among the hoi polloi, it is the sort of activity that needs to be controlled,
    restricted, licensed. "It is time for change!" the minister announces, a week
    into the job, "We have seen this country become the laughing stock of the origami
    and paper-folding world, as our hapless cack-handed scrunched-up excuses for paper
    squirrels and ducks and electricity pylons bear no resemblance whatsoever to the
    fantastically intricate oriental paper squirrels and ducks and electricity pylons
    of our competitors, and even less resemblance to flesh and blood squirrels and
    ducks and electricity pylons in the real world." And so the minister outlaws amateur
    origami of all kinds, and establishes a new national origami and paper-folding
    baccalaureate, without which no one is even allowed to fold a sheet of paper in
    half for any purpose whatsoever, on pain of arrest and a long term of imprisonment.
    Whether that is a good thing or not, I leave the reader to decide.

    It is certainly the kind of issue to sharply divide opinion. Just as, thirty years
    ago, there appeared a book entitled Authors Take Sides On The Falklands, one can
    imagine the bien-pensant intellectuals of Hampstead and Holland Park cobbling
    together a hastily-published Authors Take Sides On Origami. Whichever side one
    is on, it is surely the case that many, if not most, of those who would purchase
    such a book would immediately rip each page out of it and fold the separate leaves,
    either intricately and orientally or with cack-handed butterfingers, into paper
    models of the Secretary of State, adding buttons for eyes. Whether they could
    display the resulting origami on their windowsills, or have to hide it in an unlicensed
    folded-paper den, would depend upon the complexion of the government.

    It is all very bewildering.'
