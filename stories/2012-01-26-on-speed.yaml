  text: 'You will recall the film Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994) in which Sandra Bullock
    and Keanu Reeves are aboard a bus which will explode if it goes below fifty miles
    per hour, having been primed with a bomb by cackling evildoer Dennis "Don''t try
    to grow a brain, Jack!" Hopper. I have been wondering if a similar adrenalin-thumping
    conceit could be applied to the writing of prose.

    I am not suggesting I do anything so foolhardy as to ask a disgruntled and slightly
    maimed ex-police officer to hitch me up to a bomb which will detonate if I stop
    writing... well, I suppose that is what I am suggesting. Cowardice, or sheer common
    sense, persuades me, however, to hit upon a less perilous incentive.

    I have just spent ten minutes staring vacantly at the screen trying to think what
    that incentive might be.

    In Speed, Dennis Hopper is gleeful when a television reporter describes the fiendish
    quandary into which he has placed the bus passengers as "the whim of a madman".
    He repeats the phrase to himself, chuckling. Now I am an almost inhumanly sensible
    chap, and not a madman at all, but perhaps the whim of a madman is precisely what
    I need to give vent to, if I wish to prime my prose with the innards-wrenching
    pell-mell momentum of the film.

    Of course, not everyone would agree that Speed is an appropriate model. Dennis
    Hopper rather overdoes the criminal mania, Keanu Reeves is wooden, and the best
    that can be said of Sandra Bullock is that she is irritating. And even though
    Keanu''s fellow bomb-defusion expert Jeff Daniels is killed off, you know that
    Keanu himself, and Sandra Bullock, will escape unscathed, and Dennis Hopper come
    to a grisly end, because it''s that sort of film. But predictability has its own
    special charms. And predictability plus innards-wrenching pell-mell momentum is
    clearly popular, when we consider that Speed reportedly earned its makers over
    three-hundred-and-fifty million dollars. Now if I could only devise my madman''s
    whim, perhaps I could make a similar sum from a piece of prose.

    The glum bat of misery swoops o''er my bonce as I stare at the screen and, regretfully,
    admit to myself that this present piece of prose is not the one that will earn
    millions. Having said that, should any readers feel impelled to deposit a vast
    sum of money into the Hooting Yard Paypal account, I would be most grateful.

    But, just as Sandra Bullock has to keep her foot on the accelerator of that bus,
    I have to keep tippy-tapping away. It is true that I will not be blown to kingdom
    come if I stop. In fact, nothing at all will happen. I do not need to grow a brain
    to know that. Indeed, I have the freedom to get up and walk away and make a cup
    of tea, so I think that is what I shall do, right now. If I had a University of
    Arizona Wildcats tee-shirt, I would take the opportunity to change into it while
    the kettle is a-boiling.

    You will recall that Sandra Bullock''s wearing of a top with the Arizona Wildcats''
    logo proves to be a pivot on which the plot of Speed hinges. When last I saw the
    film I had not yet learned of that other great mainstay of Arizona life, the regional
    dish greasy doings. It seems to me that either Jan de Bont, or his screenplayperson
    Graham Yost, or indeed Keanu Reeves or Sandra Bullock or Dennis Hopper or even
    poor killed-off Jeff Daniels might, at some point during the production, have
    suggested adding a further layer to the Arizona reference by mentioning, or--better--showing,
    greasy doings. It would probably be stretching credulity to have any of the imperilled
    bus passengers tucking into greasy doings, but Dennis Hopper spends much of his
    screen time gobbling snacks while watching his madman''s whim unfold, so how difficult
    would it have been to make at least one of those snacks greasy doings? Now I come
    to think of it, given that, as I said, the dish was unknown to me when last I
    saw the film, perhaps we are shown Dennis Hopper eating greasy doings! Obviously
    I shall not rest until I have confirmed whether or not this is the case, so I
    shall have to watch Speed again, with an eagle eye on the Dennis Hopper scenes.

    It has just occurred to me that I do not know what greasy doings look like. I
    must embark on further research before my next viewing, or I will not know them
    if and when I see them, and that would be a bloody tragedy.

    I don''t know about you, but my feeling is that, were this present piece of prose
    the bus in Speed, it would be dangerously close to dropping below fifty miles
    per hour, and thus exploding. Innards-wrenching pell-mell momentum is easier to
    blather about than to maintain, in spite of the cup of tea which I was hoping
    would fuel a jamboree of thrills and spills. That may be a lot to ask from a cup
    of tea, but it has been argued that generations of British chaps could not have
    built an empire without their cups of tea, and I am not trying to build an empire,
    merely to write deathless prose, and perhaps earn millions, or thousands, or hundreds,
    or even just a pittance, by so doing.

    Yet all the while the urge to cease and stare, not at the screen but out of the
    window, at trees and crows, grows ever more intense. What would Keanu do?'
