  text: 'Now here''s a quandary. Hooting Yard strains every sinew to pretend that
    certain "celebrities" do not actually exist. We simply ignore them. They are banished
    from our mental purview, dumped into a gigantic imaginary dustbin, the lid of
    which is clanged shut.

    Badgers, on the other hand, we consider splendid creatures, always worthy of a
    few lines here and there. We don''t go overboard, we don''t babble on and on and
    on about badgers, but we take note of their doings, and bring you interesting
    badger news when appropriate.

    What to do then, when a non-existent "celebrity" and badgers collide? It is with
    a heavy sigh that I bring you this four-month old headline which has only just
    been transmitted to the Hooting Yard news hub substation...
