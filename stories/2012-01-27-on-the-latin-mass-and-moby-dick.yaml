  text: 'I remember the Latin Mass. Dimly, dimly, but I do remember it, in all its
    mystery. It was perhaps made all the more unfathomable because, until I was six
    or seven years old, we attended Sunday morning Mass in a pub. Not in a function
    room within a pub, but in the main bar area. Towels were draped over the beer
    pumps, that I remember. These were the only visits to a pub my family made.

    Thinking back, I must have found the world a very confusing place, at least on
    Sunday mornings. All smartly dressed, we would walk together to this big pub on
    a crossroads, wherein a man in a black soutane would intone what must have struck
    me as gibberish, while performing slow ritualistic manoeuvres, against a backdrop
    of a counter lined with a row of unknown objects hidden under towels, behind which
    was a glittering array of bottles and glassware. I remember that when Mass ended,
    many of the parishioners, and the priest, remained behind, eager for the pub to
    open, but we always left to go home.

    There was no Catholic church on the council estate where I grew up, and I assume
    the parish had persuaded the pub landlord to offer his premises to ensure our
    souls were saved. In my memory, I date the change to the vernacular Mass, and
    the longer walk to the parish church proper, as happening at the same time, when
    I was six or seven. Thus passed forever a curious feature of my childhood. I was
    old enough for it to have become a familiar, even reassuring, routine, and I recall
    a vague yet definite sense of disappointment with the new regime. I didn''t mind
    the longer walk--it took us through a park, with a playground and a duckpond and
    immense green well-mown lawns--but instead of the wood-panelled gloom of the pub,
    Mass now took place in a bright, modern church and, worse, I could understand
    the words. All the mystery was leached out of my Sunday mornings.

    It took only a few years of that before, one morning when I was fourteen, I woke
    up with the clear conviction that the whole Catholicism hoo-hah--actually, no,
    the whole religion hoo-hah--was absolute twaddle. I have never seriously diverted
    from this view in the succeeding years, despite a couple of wobbles. My devout
    yet tolerant parents never made an issue of it, never forced me to attend that
    ghastly bright modern church against my will, though I remember my father telling
    me, with a strange admixture of the world-weary and the smug, that the day would
    come when I would return to the bosom of the church and re-embrace the faith of
    my childhood. Who knows?, he may yet be proved right.

    I find myself wondering if my loss of faith, which really did seem to happen overnight,
    would have been quite so decisive had the Mass still been said in Latin, had we
    still celebrated it in the pub. There was something very seductive about those
    incomprehensible words. I would happily have swapped the pub for a church that
    was old and stony and cold and gloomy, but knowing the sense of what the priest
    was saying, and what I was bidden to respond, was fatal.

    The name of the pub was the Moby-Dick. It is still there, on the crossroads. Not
    so long ago, I passed it, on the way to somewhere unconnected with my childhood,
    and I was pleased to note--for the first time, but also for the first time consciously
    checking--that the hyphen in the title of the novel is present and correct in
    the name of the pub. (Just as Orwell''s Nineteen Eighty-Four is often given as
    1984, so Moby-Dick loses its hyphen, to my minor irritation.) When tiny, and attending
    Mass, I was of course wholly ignorant of Melville''s novel. It was not among the
    many many books on the shelves at home--a huge number of books, the possession
    of which I thought was commonplace, until I grew a little older and learned that
    most of our neighbours on the estate had no books at all. But I did know that
    Moby-Dick was a whale, for so it was depicted, white and thrashing about in the
    sea, on the pub sign. I cannot remember how old I was when I learned of the existence
    of the book, though I do recall, as a teenager, buying the copy I still have,
    the Penguin edition bulked out with Harold Beaver''s remarkable critical apparatus.
    Years passed before I actually got round to reading it, and I read more of Melville--Bartleby
    The Scrivener and Typee and The Confidence-Man : His Masquerade--before I read
    Moby-Dick. Which, of course, if I am to insist on the hyphen, I should also take
    care to give its proper title Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. And typing that last word
    reminds me, all of a sudden, that the name of the road on which the pub is situated,
    one of the four meeting at the crossroads, is Whalebone Lane. I have no idea what
    possible connection there is between this road, far from the sea, and whales or
    whaling. No doubt I could find out.

    I do know, incidentally, that close by, for many years, lived Eva Hart (1905-1996),
    one of the longest-living survivors of the sinking of the Titanic. There is a
    local pub named after her too.'
