    I hesitate to provide this link to my cupboard in The Dabbler on this fine Friday,
    for this week I have chosen to besmirch the pages of that splendid blog with a
    stream of pure unbridled filth. Those of you who, in spite of that warning, proceed
    to wallow in a swamp of moral turpitude may be amused to discover that, in the
    Comments, a fellow named George has devised a diverting parlour game which will
    provide much fun and frolic to those who commandeer their parlours for the playing
    of games.'
