  text: 'Items removed from the house included baby carriages, a doll carriage, rusted
    bicycles, old food, potato peelers, a collection of guns, glass chandeliers, bowling
    balls, camera equipment, the folding top of a horse-drawn carriage, a sawhorse,
    three dressmaking dummies, painted portraits, pinup girl photos, plaster busts,
    Mrs Collyer''s hope chests, rusty bed springs, the kerosene stove, a child''s
    chair (the brothers were lifelong bachelors and childless), more than 25,000 books
    (including thousands about medicine and engineering and more than 2,500 on law),
    human organs pickled in jars, eight live cats, the chassis of the old Model T
    with which Langley had been tinkering, tapestries, hundreds of yards of unused
    silks and fabric, clocks, 14 pianos (both grand and upright), a clavichord, two
    organs, banjos, violins, bugles, accordions, a gramophone and records, and countless
    bundles of newspapers and magazines, some of them decades old.

    from the Wikipedia article on the Collyer brothers, brought to my attention by
    R., to whom many thanks.'
