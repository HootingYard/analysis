  text: "I wish I could remember where I saw it. I remember distinctly what it said.\
    \ NOW! GET QUADRUPLE POINTS!!! The writing was in big bold bright block capitals,\
    \ red, I think. There was an accompanying graphic and some smaller print, which\
    \ it might have been a good idea for me to have read. As it is, not only do I\
    \ not remember where I saw it, I have no idea what I need to do to get the quadruple\
    \ points, nor indeed what I might do with them if I got them. I just remember\
    \ the blazoned promise, so urgent, so life-changing.\nIt is not that I am particularly\
    \ seeking to change my life at this moment. I am reasonably content. But there\
    \ was something about the big bold bright block capital words that gave me pause.\
    \ Not sufficient pause, admittedly, to pay attention to the graphic and to read\
    \ the smaller print. What lodged in my head was the thought that, right now, I\
    \ was being offered the chance to quadruple my points. Only a fool would walk\
    \ away. So I suppose I must be a fool, for walk away I did, either literally,\
    \ if I saw it on a hoarding while traipsing the streets, or figuratively, if I\
    \ saw it on one of those advertising leaflets that fall out of magazines and which\
    \ one tosses into the wastepaper bin having barely glanced at. If only I could\
    \ remember, I could retraipse the same streets, or rummage in the bin\u2026 but\
    \ thereagain, perhaps I saw it in another context entirely. I would feel even\
    \ more of a fool fruitlessly traipsing or rummaging, in pursuit of what, after\
    \ all, might be a chimera.\nFor what are the points I can increase fourfold? Do\
    \ I already have some? What would be the implications of having four times more\
    \ than I already have? If the points are redeemable, as I understand some points\
    \ are, then having four times as many is clearly going to be a good thing, for\
    \ the more points I have, the greater their redeemable value, in any coherent\
    \ universe. It hardly matters what they are redeemable against, if \u201Cagainst\u201D\
    \ is the word I am looking for, which I think it is. If it turned out that my\
    \ points were redeemable against something of no worth to me, still, I could barter\
    \ them, with another points-possessing person, who might be overjoyed to be able\
    \ to redeem his points for whatever gewgaw or frippery I had turned my nose up\
    \ at.\nIf only I knew the precise nature of the points I was being offered the\
    \ chance to quadruple. I almost wrote \u201Cthe once in a lifetime chance\u201D\
    , for who knows if I will ever see those words, that promise, ever again, in all\
    \ my days? I rue my ignorance. Rue, rue, rue, that's me. I know so little about\
    \ the points that I don't even know if I already have some. But that is the inference,\
    \ is it not, of the wording GET QUADRUPLE POINTS!!!? Unless one starts with four\
    \ points as the minimum, but that doesn't quite make sense. It is as easy as pie\
    \ to think of situations or circumstances with three, two, or even a single point,\n\
    Consider, for example, a cathedral city with a majestic pointy steeple atop its\
    \ cathedral. That might be the only point in the city, if, say, the remainder\
    \ of its architecture is rounded and blunt and unpointy. Such a city is conceivable,\
    \ though off the top of my head I cannot think of a concrete example. Equally\
    \ conceivable is the idea that, if the burghers of the city took up the opportunity\
    \ to GET QUADRUPLE POINTS!!! they might find themselves commissioning an architect\
    \ to design three more buildings with pointy tops, or, the cheaper option, install\
    \ three pointy lightning rods here and there across the city, thus increasing\
    \ its pointiness fourfold at a swoop. If they then quadrupled their points again,\
    \ they would have sixteen points, and if they quadrupled them again, sixty-four\
    \ points, and if they quadrupled them again, two-hundred-and-fifty-six points,\
    \ at which point the mind, or my mind, begins to boggle. Carry on like that and\
    \ you are in Pointy Town territory.\nPerhaps that is akin to the process by which\
    \ Pointy Town became the pointiest town on earth. It cannot, of course, have begun\
    \ with a pointy-steepled cathedral, for a cathedral would confer city status,\
    \ usually, and for all its unfathomably numerous points, Pointy Town remains\u2014\
    is proud to remain\u2014a town. But by all that is holy is it pointy! There have\
    \ been several surveys of the town in recent decades, and none has been able to\
    \ find even a smidgen of bluntness or roundedness or anything remotely resembling\
    \ unpointiness. Each and every one of the surveyors has been defeated in their\
    \ attempts to come up with a definitive count of the pointy bits in Pointy Town,\
    \ so we cannot say if the total number is a multiple of four. I would like to\
    \ think it is, but alas I am never going to know. I did, off my own bat, try to\
    \ count the pointy bits by studying images of Pointy Town on Google Earth (Pointy\
    \ Version) (Beta), taking the resolution as high as possible, to the point where\
    \ steam was hissing out of my computer, but somewhere around the two and half\
    \ million mark my counting was interrupted by a godawful din outside my window,\
    \ where a cat and a crow and a squirrel were engaged in some kind of bestial contretemps.\
    \ Being a fool, as, reluctantly, I have already admitted to, I had not been keeping\
    \ a tally of the pointy bits of Pointy Town, with a butcher's pencil on graph\
    \ paper, which is what I would have done if I was no fool. So I would have had\
    \ to start counting all over again, and quite frankly, I decided I had better\
    \ things to do with my time. What those things might be, I leave for you to wonder\
    \ about."
