  text: 'Bathsheba Gubbins, thou art so fair!

    With your crochet hooks and your basilisk stare.

    Come away with me to the Land of Trolls

    Where we''ll live underground like a pair of moles.

    Bathsheba Gubbins! I know I''m a chump

    But meet me tonight at the village pump.

    Let the villagers mock, let the villagers gawp.

    I am Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp

    And I shall love you till the cows come home

    They''re coming home now, o''er the rain-soaked loam.

    Which of us has not, when in mawkish or maudlin mood, sung those words, with tears
    rolling down our cheeks? Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp''s song of love to his inamorata
    is both cloyingly sentimental and, in its last line, not sentimental at all. Perhaps
    it is this duality of affect that has made it a verse adored, memorised, and recited--while
    weeping--by the entire nation.

    Curiously, however, the nation in question is neither the country of Ah-Fang nor
    of Mrs Gubbins, but the distant, possibly legendary, land of Tantarabim, in which
    neither of them ever set foot. How The Love Song Of Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp
    became so dementedly popular in that faraway land is an instructive tale, and
    it begins with cows, as so many things do.

    Some years ago, a wandering minstrel of Tantarabim wandered so far, so very far,
    that he found himself in Jaywick, the jewel of the Essex coast. Plopping himself
    on a bench outside the Never Say Die tavern, he took his piccolo from its cotton
    pochette and prepared to play and sing. Before he could begin, however, out of
    the mist emerged several cows. As luck would have it, the minstrel had arrived
    in Jaywick on the Sunday morning of what is still commemorated, at least in Jaywick,
    as "the day the cows came visiting". Entranced--as who would not be?--the minstrel
    slipped his piccolo back in its pochette and followed the cows in their cowy progress
    around the town. Being a minstrel, he composed a ditty about the experience, which
    he added to his repertoire.

    It was some years later, outside another tavern in another town, still far from
    his homeland, that the minstrel was interrupted in a performance of his ditty.

    Oh I have travelled through many lands

    But none so fair as Jaywick Sands

    was as far as he got before an unkempt dishevelled hairy sallow pockmarked greasy
    infected dippy doo-dah person, with a glass eye and a pair of worm-eaten crutches,
    loomed in front of him, blocking out the sun, and boomed "Is this going to be
    a song about cows?"

    "Why yes, it is indeed!" said the minstrel.

    "I know a better one," said the unkempt dishevelled hairy sallow pockmarked greasy
    infected dippy doo-dah person, plucking out his glass eye and polishing it with
    a filthy rag, then leaning his crutches against the tavern wall and slumping to
    the ground. And then, in a baritone so gorgeous it was barely conceivable that
    its possessor was one so unkempt and dishevelled and hairy and sallow and pockmarked
    and greasy and infected and dippy doo-dah, the stranger sang The Love Song Of
    Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp. As he held the final note, protracting the word "loam"
    to wrench from it more heartbreak than is present even in the closing scene of
    Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942), the minstrel burst into tears. He continued
    to weep as he travelled far and wide, was weeping still when eventually he puttered
    into the harbour at Tantarabim aboard a packet steamer, many many moons later.

    Now it must be understood that they are a cold-hearted lot, the indigenous Tantarabimers.
    They snarl and growl and grunt, but rarely sob. At screenings of Random Harvest,
    they are infamous for their mockery and chortling and fruit-chucking. Yet now
    a miracle occurred. The minstrel, returned to his homeland, perched on a harbourside
    crate and slipped his piccolo from its cotton pochette and tootled the yearning
    melody of The Love Song Of Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp. And then, he began to
    sing the words. Frankly, his baritone was weedy and reedy in comparison to that
    of the unkempt dishevelled hairy sallow pockmarked greasy infected dippy doo-dah
    person, but that mattered not a jot here in faraway Tantarabim. Those loitering
    at the harbour were soon weeping, and as he was cajoled to sing the song again
    and again, so Tantarabimers came scurrying from their hovels and caves and country
    estates, thronging the harbour so densely that many were shoved into the sea.
    Those who could, trod water, weeping still. Others drowned. And on and on the
    minstrel sang, until even the thickest and most stupid of Tantarabim fatheads
    could remember the words, and all took up the song, and they sing it still, morning,
    noon, and night, weeping, weeping, in that distant, possibly legendary, land.'
