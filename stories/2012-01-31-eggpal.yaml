  text: "This morning I received an email from PayPal containing\u2014among other\
    \ things\u2014this curious claim:\n\nIt had never before occurred to me that,\
    \ when seeking to identify birds\u2019 eggs, the first port of call should be\
    \ a PayPal customer services person. However, now I know, and I shall be bombarding\
    \ them with all my birds\u2019 egg identification quandaries. You should do likewise.\n\
    ADDENDUM\_: While you're there checking your birds\u2019 eggs, don't forget to\
    \ give alms to the Hooting Yard Fighting Fund. (I'm not sure yet who or what we're\
    \ fighting, but don't you worry about that.)"
