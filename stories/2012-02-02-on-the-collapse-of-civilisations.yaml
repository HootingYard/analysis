  text: 'Every now and then, civilisations collapse. Usually this happens after a
    gradual decline due to an immensely complicated set of factors which future historians
    seek to understand and explain. Sometimes, the collapse is sudden, as when barbarian
    hordes come sweeping o''er the plains on horseback, bringing ruin and desolation
    in their wake. Barbarians have their part to play in gradual collapses too, just
    not so dramatically.

    In understanding why civilisations collapse, then, it would be a great boon to
    historians were they able to sit down on a sofa with a barbarian and have a chinwag.
    What were you thinking, as you swept across the plains on horseback, accompanied
    by your horde?, the historian might ask. Was it your settled intention to cause
    the collapse of any civilisation you happened upon, or was its destruction an
    unforeseen consequence of your penchant for havoc and mayhem? Were you pernickety
    in your choice of civilisations to sweep towards, or was it a more haphazard process?
    Give me some insight into pillage. And so on.

    The benefits of such direct evidence from the mouths of barbarians have not been
    forthcoming, partly because the barbarians involved are long dead, each and every
    man jack of them, and partly because, being barbarians, they are, or were, incapable
    of coherent speech. Barbarians, remember, merely grunt.

    Two recent developments, in different fields, promise to pull the rug from under
    this dispiriting state of affairs. Actually, I am not sure "to pull the rug" is
    the appropriate metaphor, but ipsum dipsum, let it stand. First, separate investigations
    into the reanimation of the dead, mediumistic communication with the ethereal
    realm, shamanism, and seance etiquette have coalesced to the point where it may
    well be feasible to plop a long dead barbarian on to a sofa and actually engage
    him in conversation. However exciting this prospect is--and make no mistake, it
    is!--it is made somewhat less so by the fact that any such conversation is likely
    to be one-sided, consisting on the one hand of searching, piercing questions delivered
    in a series of well-turned phrases in a plummy baritone, and on the other hand,
    of barbaric grunting.

    That is why the second recent development may prove so decisive. Boffins in Switzerland
    (where else?) are putting the finishing touches to some kind of contraption that,
    fitted to the head of a grunting person--whether he be a barbarian or not--and
    with wires and nozzles poking, variously, into the mouth and the brain and certain
    glands, is able to "translate" the grunts into any of a dozen or so modern languages.
    I placed inverted commas around the word "translate" because it is not yet clear
    if the resulting print-outs, created with biro-nib on a gelatine wafer attached
    to a docking hub--are, strictly speaking, what we would understand as translations
    of grunts in the commonly accepted sense. But billions of Swiss currency units
    are being poured into this research, so I expect it will come good in the end.

    The implications dizzy the mind. We will have, at first hand, the accounts of
    individual barbarians as they describe the process of congregating in a horde,
    supplying themselves with arms and victuals, mounting their horses, and sweeping
    o''er the plains to loot and pillage and lay waste to sundry isolated villages
    on their implacable way towards a more advanced civilisation, the collapse of
    which they will then bring about, either deliberately or inadvertently. For the
    first time we will be able to apprehend a grunting enhorsed barbarian raining
    death and terror where''er he roams as a person, a person like you or me, subject
    to the same whims and pangs, jumping through the same hoops, balancing upon the
    same ledge over the awful existential abyss. The only difference between us is
    that we are quick and alive, breathing in the air of the twenty-first century,
    and he is barbaric and dead and can but grunt. But such fripperies ought not divide
    us. Already, even before the reanimation of the dead, and improved mediumistic
    communication with the ethereal realm, shamanism, and seance etiquette, and the
    final tweakings to the contraption with poking wires and nozzles and biro-nib
    and gelatine wafer and docking hub, human rights lawyers and Guardian columnists
    and Occupy protesters are suggesting that it is due time barbarians were allowed
    to play a full part in society, given the vote, and a living wage, and, most importantly,
    legally protected from being offended by the so-called civilised.

    Far too many people dismiss a dead grunting barbarian on a sofa as a "zombie",
    or similar pejorative description. However, those who show such disrespect may
    temper their views when techniques for the reanimation of the dead are perfected.
    For then, just one barbarian, reanimated for the purpose of an historical chinwag,
    might seize control of the machinery and bring back to life his entire horde.
    Then, in their inimitable barbaric fashion, they will exact their own revenge.'
