    Any of you who aspire to thespian magnificence would do well to turn to my cupboard
    in The Dabbler this week, where you get the chance to cut your chops on the famous
    "Blenkinsop!" speech. Not only are you given the full, uncorrupted text, without
    all the usual pigstraw addenda, but there are some questions and exercises included,
    to test your comprehension, your wits, and your thespian magnificence, even if
    that magnificence is still in utero. Hie thee hence, budding "Sir" Ben Kingsleys!'
