  text: "Are bongos inherently groovy? It's a good question. There are countless examples\
    \ of the addition of bongos to a lineup by those desperate to impart grooviness\
    \ to their combos. Sometimes it succeeds incontrovertibly, as in the transformation\
    \ wreaked overnight when Claude Grimes And His Pulsating Rhythm Orchestra became\
    \ Groovy Claude Grimes And His Pulsating Rhythm Orchestra With Bongos. It is important\
    \ to note here, however, that though the pulsating rhythm orchestra itself became\
    \ indubitably groovy, Claude Grimes himself did not. He was a straightlaced and\
    \ somewhat starchy figure upon whom the mantle of grooviness never sat comfortably,\
    \ and it would have been better for all concerned had he dubbed the new lineup\
    \ either Claude Grimes And His Groovy Pulsating Rhythm Orchestra With Bongos or\
    \ Claude Grimes And His Pulsating Rhythm Orchestra With Groovy Bongos. Either\
    \ of those would have been accurate, for they were grooviness incarnate with added\
    \ bongos. Yet for all their grooviness, few could hear it when they were distracted\
    \ by the patent absurdity of stiff, unfashionably-dressed Claude Grimes trying\
    \ to pass himself off as groovy. That is why, shortly after the bongos were added,\
    \ the combo retired from live performances and kept to the recording studio, where\
    \ they could give vent to their newfound grooviness uninterrupted by hepcats hooting\
    \ ridicule at Claude Grimes.\nNo one listening to those scratchy old 78s today\
    \ could dispute just how groovy they are, and how that grooviness reaches its\
    \ apogee in the bongos. But 'twas not ever thus. At around the same time as Claude\
    \ Grimes was haunting the lobbies of talent agencies on the lookout for a bongo\
    \ player, another bandleader, Pook Tuncks, had the same idea. One might think\
    \ that with a name like Pook Tuncks, he had quite enough grooviness to be going\
    \ on with, because it is by any measure a groovy name. It was of course a pseudonym,\
    \ taken from an 1864 entry in the Journal of Gerard Manley Hopkins, where the\
    \ Victorian Jesuit poet wrote \u201CTuncks is a good name. Gerard Manley Tuncks.\
    \ Pook Tuncks\u201D. But Pook Tuncks the bandleader was on a mission to become\
    \ ever groovier. Almost one hundred years after Hopkins, in 1954, he wrote in\
    \ his own Journal:\nI have it in me to become the grooviest person ever to bestride\
    \ the earth. By my own reckoning, I am currently at a high level of grooviness.\
    \ I need to screw my courage to the sticking place and take certain steps to become\
    \ even groovier. My spies tell me that Claude Grimes is planning to add bongos\
    \ to the lineup of his combo. Even though he is laughably ungroovy there is no\
    \ doubt that he will impart grooviness to his pulsating rhythm orchestra by doing\
    \ so. He will be hot on my heels. If I am to propel myself further into the stratosphere\
    \ of grooviness and leave Claude Grimes a barely visible speck in the far distance,\
    \ I too must have bongos in my lineup! Pook Tuncks And His Happening Sounds Of\
    \ Fantasticness must become Groovy Pook Tuncks And His Happening Sounds Of Fantasticness\
    \ With Bongos, or perhaps Pook Tuncks And His Happening Sounds Of Groovy Fantasticness\
    \ With Bongos.\nSo Pook Tuncks too haunted the very same lobbies of the very same\
    \ talent agencies, in the shadow of Claude Grimes, and within days of the latter\
    \ snapping up a groovy bongoist, so too did Pook Tuncks. At least, he thought\
    \ his bongoist was groovy. Most bongoists are. But, fatally, Pook Tuncks plucked\
    \ the wrong bongoist from the pile. Classically trained, with many a certificate\
    \ and diploma hanging in frames on the walls of his bongoing room, the new recruit\
    \ was simply unable to get the hang of the happening sounds of fantasticness so\
    \ dizzyingly played by the combo. A terse entry in Pook Tuncks's Journal is smudged\
    \ by tears:\nHis bongoing is leaden.\nIronically, then, the decidedly ungroovy\
    \ Claude Grimes was celebrated for the grooviness of his combo, at least after\
    \ they retired to the studio, whereas the once impeccably groovy Pook Tuncks lost\
    \ every atom of grooviness he ever had. And the impetus behind these divergent\
    \ trajectories was bongos.\nWhat we can learn from this is that, contrary to received\
    \ wisdom, bongos are not inherently groovy. Other factors have to be taken into\
    \ account. For one thing, the demeanour, attitude, and aptitude of the bongoist\
    \ are critical. No one becomes groovy just by thumping a pair of bongos, even\
    \ though the bongos may be groovy in themselves. Much less does the bandleader\
    \ automatically bask in reflected grooviness simply by dint of adding bongos to\
    \ the lineup. A certain alchemy has to occur, whether the bongos are added to\
    \ pulsating rhythms or to happening sounds of fantasticness.\nA grooveologist\
    \ recently posited the intriguing question of what might have happened had Claude\
    \ Grimes recruited Pook Tuncks's bongoist, and Pook Tuncks Claude Grimes's. A\
    \ rival grooveologist made the compelling point that the pivotal factor may be\
    \ the bongos, not the bongoist. Had Claude Grimes's bongoist swapped his bongos\
    \ with Pook Tuncks's bongoist, could that have made a vital difference? This takes\
    \ us into the treacherous territory of whether the grooviness or otherwise of\
    \ bongos depends upon the bongoist, which in turn forces us to ask if the grooviness\
    \ or otherwise of any individual bongoist is reliant upon their bongos.\nIn an\
    \ ideal world, of course, one could match up groovy bongoists with groovy bongos,\
    \ while they are still loitering full of hopes and dreams in the lobby of a talent\
    \ agency. But even then, can the grooviest of bongoists, armed with the grooviest\
    \ of bongos, necessarily impart grooviness to the combo to which they are recruited?\
    \ The tragic decline of Pook Tuncks And His Happening Sounds Of Fantasticness,\
    \ insert the Groovy where one will, would suggest not. He was last seen in 1962,\
    \ in the gutter outside the Cavern Club in Liverpool, sloshed and stricken and\
    \ holding out a begging bowl to trendy with-it young persons, who passed him by,\
    \ neither knowing nor caring who he was."
