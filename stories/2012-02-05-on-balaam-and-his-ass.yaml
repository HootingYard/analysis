  text: '22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with
    the princes of Moab.

    22:22 And God''s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD
    stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass,
    and his two servants were with him.

    22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword
    drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the
    field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.

    22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being
    on this side, and a wall on that side.

    22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the
    wall, and crushed Balaam''s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.

    22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where
    was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

    22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam:
    and Balaam''s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.

    22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What
    have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?

    22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there
    were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

    22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden
    ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And
    he said, Nay.

    22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD
    standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head,
    and fell flat on his face.

    22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine
    ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is
    perverse before me:

    22:33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had
    turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.

    22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not
    that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee,
    I will get me back again.

    22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the
    word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with
    the princes of Balak.

    There is more to the story of Balaam, but it need not detain us here. The crucial
    point is that we have no evidence the LORD, having opened the mouth of the ass--that
    is, given the gift of human speech to Balaam''s donkey--remembers to close the
    mouth of the ass, or take away the gift of speech, before Balaam and the donkey
    trot away with the princes of Balak. We must therefore assume that it continues
    to speak.

    That, at least was the conclusion of the dipsomaniacal Irish playwright Finbarr
    na [Unpronounceable Thicket of Consonants], who in 1959 produced his most famous
    work, The Donkey Dialogues. When the play begins, Balaam and his ass have taken
    leave of the princes of Balak and gone a-wandering throughout the Middle East
    and beyond, ending up--surprise surprise!--in Dublin. They roam from bar to bar,
    drinking pints of porter, and regaling their fellow-drinkers with what are supposed
    to be comic skits. Much of the so-called humour relies on the idea that Balaam
    is a foolish glutton while the donkey is imbued by the LORD not only with a human
    speaking voice but with His Ineffable Being. The donkey is, in other words, in
    this reading, God.

    Unsurprisingly, the playwright was accused of blasphemy and more than one priest
    personally socked him on the jaw.

    Of more interest perhaps is what has been done with Finbarr''s work in a new adaptation
    for television. Balaam and his ass are no longer relocated to Dublin, they barely
    drink at all, and the comedy dialogues are jettisoned entirely. Speaking in generic
    BBC peasant accents (a la Lark Rise To Candleford) the pair traipse back and forth
    across the sun-bashed verdant fields between Lark Rise and Candleford, exchanging
    observations about the peasantry, the weather, and ancient hostilities between
    the Israelites and the Moabites and the Amorites. Thankfully, there is no attempt
    at humour.

    Whereas in the original, it was difficult for an audience to suspend disbelief
    at the absurd picture of a talking donkey in an Irish bar, it seems perfectly
    plausible, in the rustic setting, to have a man and a donkey trudging across the
    fields chatting to one another. Plausibility alone does not make for good drama,
    however, and there have been mutterings in the production suite. In the planned
    second series, Balaam''s ass will be stricken with a mysterious and seemingly
    incurable donkey disease, allowing for the introduction of a new character, a
    maverick young veterinary surgeon newly arrived in the countryside muck from the
    urban metropolis.

    There is also talk of giving the talking donkey its own Saturday night television
    chat show, in which it will interrogate movers and shakers (Rolf Harris, Benedict
    Cumberbatch, Yoko Ono) on their knowledge of peasants and weather and Israelites
    and Moabites and Amorites and smiting with sticks.'
