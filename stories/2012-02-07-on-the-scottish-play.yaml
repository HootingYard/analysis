  text: "Among thespians, there is a somewhat laughable superstition that one must\
    \ never mention the title of Shakespeare's \u201CScottish play\u201D in a theatre,\
    \ on pain of who knows what catastrophe. Hence the euphemism. I say \u201Claughable\u201D\
    , but you will note I have avoided giving the play's title myself. And I have\
    \ used the euphemism as the title of this piece for a very good reason. Judging\
    \ by the events of recent days, it would seem that the theatrical curse has come\
    \ visiting the decidedly untheatrical world of Hooting Yard.\nLet me explain.\
    \ The other day I was exercising my brainpans thinking up subjects for future\
    \ essays in this series. In a particularly sparky staring-out-of-the-window-at-crows\
    \ interlude, it occurred to me to write about groovy bongos, Balaam and his ass,\
    \ replacement bus services, and that which I am now too fearful and full of collywobbles\
    \ to name. You will, I hope, have read and digested and given much thought to\
    \ three of those topics, which appeared here on Saturday and Sunday and Monday.\
    \ The fourth, which I refrain from typing, is due today.\nAnyway, I was quite\
    \ happy to have decided upon four days\u2019 worth of subject matter in a single\
    \ crow-observance session, so I decided to go out for a walk. I put on a hat with\
    \ earflaps to counter the cold, and a Tyrolean jacket not unlike the one worn\
    \ by Christopher Plummer in The Sound Of Music (Robert Wise, 1965), and I headed\
    \ towards Nameless Pond. On my way there, I met an acquaintance, who joined me\
    \ on my circuit of the pond.\n\u201CSo what have you been up to, Mr Key?\u201D\
    \ asked this person.\n\u201CAs it happens, Mr Spraingue, I have had a very profitable\
    \ morning staring out of the window at crows while thinking of topics for my daily\
    \ essays,\u201D I replied.\n\u201CI would be most interested to hear what those\
    \ topics might be, Mr Key,\u201D he said.\n\u201CThen let me list them for you\
    \ in the order I suspect I shall be writing them, Mr Spraingue,\u201D I replied.\
    \ By this time we had reached Nameless Pond and begun our circuit. \u201CFirst\
    \ I shall tackle groovy bongos, then Balaam and his ass, then replacement bus\
    \ services, and when those three are done I shall turn my attention to -\u201D\
    \ and I mentioned by name the subject which sheer unbridled terror prevents me\
    \ from repeating here. At the time, however, neither I nor Mr Spraingue had any\
    \ inkling that aught was amiss. We continued to walk the well-trodden path around\
    \ the pond, and soon enough we were speaking together of other things, including\
    \ windows and crows and Chris Huhne and his speaking clock mother. Later I returned\
    \ home and took off my Tyrolean jacket and hat with earflaps and sat down at my\
    \ escritoire and began to write about groovy bongos.\nOver the next couple of\
    \ days, though I took my regular walks in the vicinity of Nameless Pond, I saw\
    \ neither hide nor hair of Mr Spraingue. This is not an unusual circumstance,\
    \ for he is not a man of routine habits, and days or weeks can pass without our\
    \ seeing each other. I was unperturbed.\nI was unperturbed, that is, until this\
    \ morning, when I received a message on my metal tapping machine. The message\
    \ came from a mutual acquaintance of myself and Mr Spraingue. I was told that,\
    \ no sooner had we parted, after our circuit of Nameless Pond the other day, than\
    \ Mr Spraingue fell victim to a sequence of calamitous events. He trod in a puddle.\
    \ In shaking the puddlewater from his Chelsea boot, he lost his balance and toppled\
    \ over. In toppling over, he bashed his head on a pondside bench. The bench, placed\
    \ there for wayfarers to rest their weary legs, was made of metal. The trajectory\
    \ of Mr Spraingue's toppling meant that the part of his head which bashed against\
    \ the bench was his ear. Because the bash was not unduly violent, and because\
    \ he is a manly uncomplaining type of fellow, Mr Spraingue got to his feet and\
    \ dusted himself down and went on his way. Fatefully, however, in toppling he\
    \ had thrust out his hands to break his fall and the palm of one hand had landed\
    \ slap in the midst of a patch of reeking pondside muck. Within this muck lurked\
    \ many minuscule creeping and crawling things, blind and writhing and riddled\
    \ with infection. One such tiny, barely visible being attached itself there and\
    \ then to Mr Spraingue's hand. Before brushing the mud from his Italianate topcoat,\
    \ he rubbed his ear, throbbing from the bash anent the metal bench. In so rubbing,\
    \ he dislodged the tiny creeping thing, which scurried into the shelter of his\
    \ ear. The rest of the day, I was told, passed uneventfully for Mr Spraingue.\
    \ He felt none the worse for wear. In the middle of the night, however, he woke\
    \ up screaming. He leaped from his bed and cut mad capers about his bedroom, repeatedly\
    \ bashing his head against the walls. When he could not be becalmed, Mrs Spraingue,\
    \ his inamorata, ferried him to hospital in their gleaming bright red sports car.\
    \ Medicos shot him full of powerful tranquilisers, so at last he stopped screaming.\
    \ Assuring Mrs Spraingue that they would keep Mr Spraingue in an induced coma\
    \ while they worked out what was wrong with him, the medicos insisted she go home\
    \ and get some rest. Meanwhile, inside Mr Spraingue's head, the minuscule blind\
    \ creeping thing had wriggled its way through his ear and burrowed into his cranium,\
    \ where it had now set about munching his brain jelly. Mr Spraingue's brain was\
    \ gigantic in comparison to the tiny being, but its appetite was huge. It will\
    \ not take many days for it to eat his brain entire. In all this horror, it is\
    \ perhaps a small mercy Mr Spraingue will never learn that, driving home in the\
    \ cold misty night, his inamorata stalled the gleaming bright red sports car on\
    \ a level crossing, in the path of a thunderous oncoming express train, its carriages\
    \ packed with hundreds of crippled orphans heading for a better life in an Edenic\
    \ garden city. In the inevitable collision of train and car, all perished, the\
    \ driver, the orphans, their governesses, and Mrs Spraingue.\nIt seems clear to\
    \ me that none of this would have happened had I not been so reckless as to speak\
    \ aloud the title of this present essay which, for your safety and mine, I have\
    \ replaced with the euphemism used by theatrical persons when they speak, in the\
    \ theatre, of The Tragedie Of Macbeth."
