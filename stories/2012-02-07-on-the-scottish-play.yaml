  text: 'Among thespians, there is a somewhat laughable superstition that one must
    never mention the title of Shakespeare''s "Scottish play" in a theatre, on pain
    of who knows what catastrophe. Hence the euphemism. I say "laughable", but you
    will note I have avoided giving the play''s title myself. And I have used the
    euphemism as the title of this piece for a very good reason. Judging by the events
    of recent days, it would seem that the theatrical curse has come visiting the
    decidedly untheatrical world of Hooting Yard.

    Let me explain. The other day I was exercising my brainpans thinking up subjects
    for future essays in this series. In a particularly sparky staring-out-of-the-window-at-crows
    interlude, it occurred to me to write about groovy bongos, Balaam and his ass,
    replacement bus services, and that which I am now too fearful and full of collywobbles
    to name. You will, I hope, have read and digested and given much thought to three
    of those topics, which appeared here on Saturday and Sunday and Monday. The fourth,
    which I refrain from typing, is due today.

    Anyway, I was quite happy to have decided upon four days'' worth of subject matter
    in a single crow-observance session, so I decided to go out for a walk. I put
    on a hat with earflaps to counter the cold, and a Tyrolean jacket not unlike the
    one worn by Christopher Plummer in The Sound Of Music (Robert Wise, 1965), and
    I headed towards Nameless Pond. On my way there, I met an acquaintance, who joined
    me on my circuit of the pond.

    "So what have you been up to, Mr Key?" asked this person.

    "As it happens, Mr Spraingue, I have had a very profitable morning staring out
    of the window at crows while thinking of topics for my daily essays," I replied.

    "I would be most interested to hear what those topics might be, Mr Key," he said.

    "Then let me list them for you in the order I suspect I shall be writing them,
    Mr Spraingue," I replied. By this time we had reached Nameless Pond and begun
    our circuit. "First I shall tackle groovy bongos, then Balaam and his ass, then
    replacement bus services, and when those three are done I shall turn my attention
    to -" and I mentioned by name the subject which sheer unbridled terror prevents
    me from repeating here. At the time, however, neither I nor Mr Spraingue had any
    inkling that aught was amiss. We continued to walk the well-trodden path around
    the pond, and soon enough we were speaking together of other things, including
    windows and crows and Chris Huhne and his speaking clock mother. Later I returned
    home and took off my Tyrolean jacket and hat with earflaps and sat down at my
    escritoire and began to write about groovy bongos.

    Over the next couple of days, though I took my regular walks in the vicinity of
    Nameless Pond, I saw neither hide nor hair of Mr Spraingue. This is not an unusual
    circumstance, for he is not a man of routine habits, and days or weeks can pass
    without our seeing each other. I was unperturbed.

    I was unperturbed, that is, until this morning, when I received a message on my
    metal tapping machine. The message came from a mutual acquaintance of myself and
    Mr Spraingue. I was told that, no sooner had we parted, after our circuit of Nameless
    Pond the other day, than Mr Spraingue fell victim to a sequence of calamitous
    events. He trod in a puddle. In shaking the puddlewater from his Chelsea boot,
    he lost his balance and toppled over. In toppling over, he bashed his head on
    a pondside bench. The bench, placed there for wayfarers to rest their weary legs,
    was made of metal. The trajectory of Mr Spraingue''s toppling meant that the part
    of his head which bashed against the bench was his ear. Because the bash was not
    unduly violent, and because he is a manly uncomplaining type of fellow, Mr Spraingue
    got to his feet and dusted himself down and went on his way. Fatefully, however,
    in toppling he had thrust out his hands to break his fall and the palm of one
    hand had landed slap in the midst of a patch of reeking pondside muck. Within
    this muck lurked many minuscule creeping and crawling things, blind and writhing
    and riddled with infection. One such tiny, barely visible being attached itself
    there and then to Mr Spraingue''s hand. Before brushing the mud from his Italianate
    topcoat, he rubbed his ear, throbbing from the bash anent the metal bench. In
    so rubbing, he dislodged the tiny creeping thing, which scurried into the shelter
    of his ear. The rest of the day, I was told, passed uneventfully for Mr Spraingue.
    He felt none the worse for wear. In the middle of the night, however, he woke
    up screaming. He leaped from his bed and cut mad capers about his bedroom, repeatedly
    bashing his head against the walls. When he could not be becalmed, Mrs Spraingue,
    his inamorata, ferried him to hospital in their gleaming bright red sports car.
    Medicos shot him full of powerful tranquilisers, so at last he stopped screaming.
    Assuring Mrs Spraingue that they would keep Mr Spraingue in an induced coma while
    they worked out what was wrong with him, the medicos insisted she go home and
    get some rest. Meanwhile, inside Mr Spraingue''s head, the minuscule blind creeping
    thing had wriggled its way through his ear and burrowed into his cranium, where
    it had now set about munching his brain jelly. Mr Spraingue''s brain was gigantic
    in comparison to the tiny being, but its appetite was huge. It will not take many
    days for it to eat his brain entire. In all this horror, it is perhaps a small
    mercy Mr Spraingue will never learn that, driving home in the cold misty night,
    his inamorata stalled the gleaming bright red sports car on a level crossing,
    in the path of a thunderous oncoming express train, its carriages packed with
    hundreds of crippled orphans heading for a better life in an Edenic garden city.
    In the inevitable collision of train and car, all perished, the driver, the orphans,
    their governesses, and Mrs Spraingue.

    It seems clear to me that none of this would have happened had I not been so reckless
    as to speak aloud the title of this present essay which, for your safety and mine,
    I have replaced with the euphemism used by theatrical persons when they speak,
    in the theatre, of The Tragedie Of Macbeth.'
