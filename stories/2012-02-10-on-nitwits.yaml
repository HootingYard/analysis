  text: "It was my intention today to use this space to compile a list of nitwits.\
    \ The idea was to save you, gentle readers, from having to work out for yourselves\
    \ who was, and who was not, a nitwit. You could simply memorise my list and then,\
    \ whenever you saw or heard a nitwit, you could cry \u201CNitwit!\u201D, and pay\
    \ the nitwit in question no further regard, thus freeing up your time for more\
    \ salubrious pursuits than being exposed to nitwittery. If your cranial integuments\
    \ were unequal to the task of memorising the list, you could print it out and\
    \ carry it with you at all times, in pocket or reticule, hoisting it out to check\
    \ it when in the presence of a possible or probable nitwit.\nI am not suggesting\
    \ that you do not know a nitwit when you see one, but I thought it would be helpful\
    \ for you to have a ready made list. Ah, but already your eyes are scanning the\
    \ splurge of text below this line, and you see no sign of a list. Did my plan\
    \ gang agley, and if so, why, for heaven's sake?\nWell, jumping out of bed before\
    \ dawn and plunging my head into a pail of ice-cold water, as ever, I began compiling\
    \ the list within that same head, wet and freezing. There would be time enough\
    \ to write down the names of this first flurry of nitwits when I repaired to my\
    \ escritoire after breakfast, breakfast today being eggy, accompanied by a single\
    \ smokers\u2019 poptart, washed down with liquefied vitamin-enriched pap. The\
    \ difference between common or garden pap and liquefied pap is that the latter\
    \ is runnier, and can be poured into a beaker for the swigging therefrom. Common\
    \ or garden pap, while still runny, when compared say to a potato or a block of\
    \ suet, is usually served in a bowl and eaten with a spoon. I know these things.\n\
    But I am leaping ahead of myself. Let us return to where I was doubled over with\
    \ my head plunged into a pail of icy water. The names of seven or eight nitwits\
    \ sprang to mind before I lifted my head, took a gulp of air, and replunged. During\
    \ the second immersion I thought of several more nitwits. One more deep breath,\
    \ and the third and final plunge, and before I was even wrapping a towel around\
    \ my freezing head I had a mental list of at least a score of nitwits.\nI just\
    \ need to clear something up here before we proceed. I may have given the impression\
    \ that I am only capable of thinking of the names of nitwits at such times as\
    \ my head is immersed in ice cold water. Not so! I can as well summon the names\
    \ of a legion of nitwits with my head wrapped in a towel, or indeed not wrapped\
    \ in a towel or any other swaddling, just plonked atop my neck breathing in the\
    \ air, fresh or foetid as may be. Don't get the wrong idea.\nSo, as I prepared\
    \ my breakfast eggs \u2018n\u2019 smokers\u2019 poptart \u2018n\u2019 pap, with\
    \ my habitual ritualistic precision, I congratulated myself on having made a splendid\
    \ start to my nitwit list. And here I must confess that self-congratulation is\
    \ my fatal weakness. I have been known to give myself a thunderous round of applause\
    \ simply for completing a mundane task, for instance making my breakfast, or tying\
    \ my bootlaces. In my defence, I would point out that I only do this because it\
    \ was recommended to me by the author of the only self-help book I have ever read.\
    \ In Clap Yourself Stupid!\u2014Ten Steps To A Dementedly High Level Of Self-Esteem,\
    \ Dr Bruce Terrific\u2014pictured on the back cover wearing splendid moustachios\
    \ and a cravat\u2014suggests not only applauding oneself but also patting oneself\
    \ on the back using a patented arm-extension device, striking one's own medals\
    \ from milk-bottle caps, and playing tape recordings of the cheering of hysterically\
    \ overexcited crowds, cleverly modified so they sound as if they are bawling one's\
    \ own name through tears of happiness and joy. I have found these methods work\
    \ wonders, and it is now at least three weeks since I have compared myself to\
    \ a worm wriggling in the muck.\nMore names of nitwits popped into my head, now\
    \ dry and slightly warmer, as I ate my breakfast. I was impatient to get to the\
    \ escritoire and to start writing them down. At this point, I began to wonder\
    \ whether I ought to simply scribble the names down, one after another, on sheets\
    \ of notepaper, or if it would be better to make use of a stack of index cards.\
    \ If I gave each nitwit their own individual card, I would have space for annotations.\
    \ These could prove invaluable. Already, in my mental list of nitwits, I had two\
    \ nitwits with very similar names, differing in fact by only a single letter.\
    \ Granted, they were both nitwits, through and through, but the nature of their\
    \ nitwittery varied\u2014one was a saintly nitwit, the other a knave and jackass\u2014\
    and it would not do to mix them up. It also occurred to me that, as my list lengthened,\
    \ there may be a similar similarity in the name of a nitwit and the name of one\
    \ who was not a nitwit by any stretch of the imagination. I did not want the users\
    \ of my list to call its reliability into question by making the assumption that\
    \ I had included a non-nitwit on a list of nitwits or, worse, that I had declared\
    \ one who was quite clearly not a nitwit to be a nitwit. Were that to happen,\
    \ I would run the risk of being called a nitwit myself. Perish the thought!\n\
    If only the thought had perished. But it began to gnaw at me, before I had even\
    \ finished my breakfast, before I had even got as far as my escritoire, and my\
    \ notepad, and my stack of index cards, and my pot of propelling pencils. Should\
    \ I be on the nitwit list?, I asked myself, over and over again. Sometimes I answered\
    \ no, sometimes yes, sometimes I left the question hanging, and it hung over me\
    \ like the sword of Damocles, to the point where I got all wibblywobbly and frightened\
    \ and jellylegged and fretful. Hoping for some kind of succour, I reached for\
    \ my self-help book and stared at the photograph of Dr Bruce Terrific. His black\
    \ and white eyes gazed back at me, curiously unreadable, fathomless, cold. It\
    \ was like looking into the unreadable fathomless cold eyes of a swan.\nI received\
    \ no succour, no answer. Mopping up the last bit of egg with the last corner of\
    \ smokers\u2019 poptart, I decided I could not take the risk of being dubbed a\
    \ nitwit. If I were called a nitwit, I might become a nitwit, my name at the top\
    \ of my own list of the names of nitwits. It was a prospect too horrible to contemplate.\
    \ I banged my fork on my plate and stood up, and I walked right past my escritoire,\
    \ out through the door, into the freezing cold, and I gulped the icy air, as dawn\
    \ came crashing across the sky."
