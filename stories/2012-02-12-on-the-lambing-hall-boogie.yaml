  text: '[My thanks to R.]

    The lambing-hall boogie may refer to two distinct, yet allied, phenomena. First
    we need to be clear what we mean by the lambing-hall. Almost invariably, this
    is the farm building wherein newborn lambs are brought fumbling and puling into
    the world. In the specific context of the lambing-hall boogie, however, it refers
    to the site associated with the other extremity of the lamb''s life. Certain evil
    farmers mischievously give the name "lambing hall" to the barn--often cavernous,
    windowless, and grisly--in to which lambs are led to the slaughter. Those of you
    who have bathed in the blood of the lamb, the better to become Christ-like, will
    be familiar with this latter designation, as will those of you who have read Thomas
    Harris''s potboiler The Silence Of The Lambs, or have seen the film adaptation
    starring Jodie Foster as rookie FBI agent Clarice Stalin.

    Incidentally, if I may digress for a moment, the agent''s name is often given,
    erroneously, as Clarice Starling. Even the potboilerist himself refers to her
    as such throughout his text. Yet the parallels between the fictional law enforcement
    officer and the non-fictional pock-marked moustachioed Georgian petty thief who
    rose to become the paranoid and demented tyrant of the Soviet Union are surely
    too obvious to need repetition here. For my part, I have gone carefully through
    each page of my paperback copy of The Silence Of The Lambs, Tippexing out the
    extraneous letters "r" and "g" in each mention of Stalin, and then, using a black
    biro, slightly thickened the "a" and the "l" to close the gap created between
    them. Laborious though the process is, it makes for a much more satisfying read,
    for one is no longer distracted by what seem to be frequent and irrelevant references
    to a starling, the passerine bird known to congregate in vast flocks often numbering
    in the thousands, or even millions. I was once reading the potboiler, as yet unmodified
    with Tippex, when I paused to look out of my window and saw a flock of starlings
    in the sky, blocking out the sun, but that is an anecdote for a later occasion.

    The primary definition of the lambing-hall boogie, then, is that it is the name
    given to a riotous dance which may be organised by the evil farmer after he has
    cut the throats of all the lambs he has corralled into the cavernous grisly barn.
    The sawdust on the floor is awash with the blood of lambs, and into this gruesomeness
    the evil farmer will inveigle his farmhands and their extended families. First
    they roll about in the sawdust until they are smeared and splattered with lambs''
    blood, and then they dance. Perhaps the closest non-rustic equivalent of the dance
    is the pogo once practised enthusiastically by punkists in the latter part of
    the nineteen-seventies. But the music to which the farmpersons leap and hurl themselves
    about the blood-soaked barn could not be more different from punk music as we
    know it. Evil farmers are wont to employ for the evening a so-called chamber farm
    orchestra, which performs a combination of baroque minuets and oompah marches,
    overlaid, or possibly underlaid, I don''t really understand the technicalities,
    with funereal dirges on cello.

    Intriguingly, there is some evidence that Josef Stalin may have taken part in
    several lambing-hall boogies during his youthful years in Georgia. Clarice Stalin,
    however, did not, insofar as we can glean from Harris''s text. Further research
    on this matter is probably pointless, at least in the case of the rookie FBI agent,
    for the simple reason that she is fictional.

    The secondary definition of the lambing-hall boogie is, as I indicated, allied
    to the first. If you have spent any appreciable time in a rustic milieu, you will
    know that you can barely pass ten minutes without being buttonholed by a toothless
    ancient or drooling village idiot eager to regale you with barely comprehensible
    countryside lore and legend. Much of this can be airily dismissed with a wave
    of your elegant hand, swathed in an Italianate silken glove, but occasionally
    it pays to sit with the crone or idiot and to listen carefully. That is how I
    learned of the undoubtedly real terrors of the other lambing-hall boogie, where
    "boogie" refers not to a dance but to a boogie-man or sprite or hobgoblin or wraith
    or phantom or possibly even to the devil himself.

    This figure, with the head of a blood-soaked lamb and the body of either a goat
    or a hedgehog or a starling, is said to appear from within an engulfing mist of
    foul and noisome vapours on the stroke of midnight, when the pogoing farmpersons
    are sprawled, exhausted and nauseous, on the bloody sawdust in the barn. It wreaks
    its terrible vengeance by casting a hypnotic spell over all those gathered, condemning
    them to a calendar year of rustic drudgery, flooded drainage ditches, pricking
    by thorns, torrential rainfall, maddened cows, and other such miseries of countryside
    existence.

    There is some conjecture that the lambing-hall boogie may have somehow entered
    the body of, and commandeered the brain and soul of young Josef Stalin. There
    is further conjecture that there exists a suppressed text by Thomas Harris in
    which Clarice Stalin goes in pursuit of the lambing-hall boogie in an attempt
    to bring him to justice. I have spoken to someone who claims to have seen the
    manuscript, who reports that the potboilerist mires the whole business in unnecessary
    confusion. In his version, the lambing-hall boogie, as it emerges from an engulfing
    mist of foul and noisome vapours on the stroke of midnight, is erroneously given
    both the head and the body of a starling, making it effectively identical to the
    bird itself. My informant tells me that the bulk of the text then has Clarice
    Stalin chasing a starling across the continental United States, armed with a butterfly
    net.'
