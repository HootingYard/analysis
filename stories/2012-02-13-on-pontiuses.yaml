  text: 'Pontiuses is the name given to the healthful and invigorating physical exercise
    system devised by Joseph Pontius in the early twentieth century in Germany. It
    is broadly similar to the rival system known as Pilates. Well, actually, it is
    completely dissimilar, but I am all of a dither what with one thing and another.
    Only a person in the throes of a dither could possibly confuse their Pontiuses
    with their Pilates, for they have nothing whatsoever in common save for being
    physical exercise systems developed in the early twentieth century in Germany
    by men called Joseph whose surnames began with the letter P. I will try to stabilise
    my dither so I can continue this essay in prose of glistening clarity.

    If you were to stumble upon a grouplet of Pontiuses-practising persons in a field,
    or in a municipal leisure facility, the first thing that would strike you would
    be their "gear". Not for the Pontiusesist the leotards favoured by Pilatesists.
    No indeed. Here is a first-hand description of the outfit commonly worn when getting
    into the Pontiuses groove:

    I had my feather in my cap as big as a flag in the fore-top; my French dublet
    gelte in the bellie as though (like a pig readie to be spitted) all my guts had
    bin pluckt out; a paire of side paned hose that hung downe like two scales filled
    with Holland cheeses; my longe stock that sate close to my docke, and smoothered
    not a scab or a leacherous hairie sinew on the calfe of the legge; my rapier pendant
    like a round sticke fastned in the tacklings for skippers the better to climbe
    by; my cape cloake of blacke cloth, overspreading my backe like a thorne-backe,
    or an Elephantes eare, that hanges on his shoulders like a countrie huswives banskin
    which she thirles hir spindle on; & in consummation of my curiositie, my hands
    without glooves, all a more French, and a blacke budge edging of a beard on the
    upper lip, & the like sable auglet of excrements in the rising of the anckle of
    my chin.

    Readers of a Tudor bent may recognise that dandyish apparel as being broadly similar
    to the costume worn by young Jack Wilton, the narrator of Thomas Nashe''s The
    Unfortunate Traveller (1594). What am I saying, "broadly similar"? It is identical.
    Clearly I have yet to subjugate my dither. I must marshal my forces. Perhaps I
    ought to go and do some Pontiuses myself.

    Now you might think it would be difficult, or at least inconvenient, to perform
    invigorating exercises when dressed up to the nines like a foppish Elizabethan
    roister doister. As indeed it is. But therein lies the key to the magnificent
    efficacy of Pontiuses. Or at least, one of the keys. Apparently, there are several,
    if we are to credit the title of the "guidance" published by Joseph Pontius, The
    Several Keys To The Magnificent Efficacy Of The Pontiuses Physical Exercise System
    Devised By Myself On A Thursday Afternoon In Dusseldorf During A Downpour (1929).
    I give it in English, though the book, all nine hundred pages of it, was written
    in Solresol, the artificial language devised by Francois Sudre and expounded in
    Boleslas Gajewski''s Grammaire du Solresol (1902), a signed copy of which Pontius
    had committed to memory. Not being able to speak or read Solresol myself, I have
    no idea what Pontius has to say in his "guidance", but I am not going to let that
    stop me. I am manfully overcoming my dither and shall press on.

    I said that the first thing that would strike you were you to come upon a grouplet
    of Pontiusesists would be their clothing. Hard upon the heels of that sensation
    would come a second, as you were made dizzy by the sight of what at first glance
    would look like people engaged in haphazard jumping about while having spasmodic
    fits. You might even cast your eyes about to spot a rabid dog, foaming at the
    mouth, assuming all the people had been bitten by it. But gradually you would
    begin to discern a pattern, indeed a profound order, in what seemed to be mere
    frantic cavorting. If it turned out there was a rabid dog in the vicinity, that
    would be mere coincidence, though you would be advised to report its presence
    to a public health official on doggy duty in his booth or kiosk, if you could
    find it. Sometimes these officials hide themselves away so they can spend their
    days uninterrupted by hound-troubled citizens. It is quite scandalous.

    Scandal was something that dogged Joseph Pontius too. But then, the Weimar Republic
    was riddled with scandal, from top to bottom, so when the inventor of Pontiuses
    was arrested and charged and convicted and imprisoned in a case of unseemliness,
    it barely made the headlines. He did not waste his time in gaol, however, adapting
    his physical exercise system for the confined space of a cell. Rather than seemingly
    haphazard jumping about, the incarcerated Pontiusesist throws himself repeatedly
    at the walls in a strictly regulated sequence of spasmodic lurching movements.
    Reluctantly, Pontius had to discard the preening Tudor gallant''s apparel and
    approve the practice of Pontiuses while wearing the harsh grey sackcloth of Weimar
    prison uniform.

    What this means is that there is a deal of difference between Pontiuses In Prison
    and plain old Pontiuses. Even I can tell them apart, even when my senses are muffled
    by dither. Which, I am pleased to say, they are not, any more, today, for I have
    smashed the dither to bits, simply through willpower, and I did not even need
    to perform any Pontiuses to get me this far, which makes me wonder if the exercises
    are actually worth doing. Probably not, I would aver. I think I shall put my feet
    up and have a cup of tea instead.'
