  text: 'And lo!, we come to the two thousandth postage at Hooting Yard. (Two thousand,
    that is, in the current format. There are an additional nine-hundred-and-fifty
    or so postages in the 2003 -2006 Archive.) I suggested divers methods of celebration
    when we hit one thousand, so you might want to go and read that.

    Now there are so many posts that, were each one a year, they would stretch back
    as near as dammit to the birth of Christ, I am minded to mark two thousand more
    quietly. Hooting Yard is, I hope, quite clearly a place for those intoxicated
    by love of words. So what better way to celebrate than with a quotation containing
    an extraordinary, and sadly neglected, coinage?

    I retired myselfe among the merrie muses, and by the worke of my pen and inke,
    have dezinkhornifistibulated a fantasticall Rapsody of dialogisme, to the end
    that I would not be found an idle drone among so many famous teachers and professors
    of noble languages.

    That is from the preface to Ortho-epia Gallica by John Eliot (1593). According
    to Charles Nicholl, "the Ortho-epia Gallica is a curious and colourful work :
    ostensibly a language-manual, of the type very popular in cosmopolitan London,
    it turns out on closer inspection to be a lampoon of other language-manuals and
    of the foreigners who wrote them".

    My source is Charles Nicholl''s A Cup Of News : The Life Of Thomas Nashe (1984),
    wherein I also gleaned those other recent bits of Nashery.'
