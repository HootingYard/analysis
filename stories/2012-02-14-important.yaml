  text: "I bring you an important message from Ed Baxter, benign dictator of Resonance104.4fm,\
    \ the home for the past eight years of the world's most Hooting Yardist radio\
    \ programme, Hooting Yard On The Air. Says Dr Baxter:\nResonance 104.4fm's annual\
    \ on-air fund raiser runs all this week till midnight on Sunday the 19th of February.\
    \ If you love Resonance104.4fm and the broadcasts made by our astonishing array\
    \ of presenters, please support us via a donation, pledge, bequest, gift or purchase\
    \ from our shop. The\_alternative\u2014for the station to take regular on-air\
    \ advertising\u2014is something we'd all prefer not to contemplate. But as it\
    \ approaches its tenth anniversary Resonance urgently need funds to continue its\
    \ work. Visit resonancefm.com to make a donation of any size. PLUS as usual we're\
    \ having an auction of unique and wondrous items, with contributions from David\
    \ Shrigley, Bob & Roberta Smith, Glen Baxter and much more (rare records, wine,\
    \ services, etc)\u2014the list will grow as the week progresses.\nVisit resonancefm.com/auction-2012\
    \ and make a bid by emailing auction@resonancefm.com.\nOr why not simply phone\
    \ us with a pledge on 020 7407 1210?\nMany thanks."
