  text: "In Elizabethan England, \u201Cthe verge\u201D was an area of legal jurisdiction,\
    \ defined as the territory within a twelve-mile radius of the body of the Queen,\
    \ wherever she happened to be. Thus, a sort of legal, royal \u201Caura\u201D.\n\
    Does anybody know if the verge still exists in the present day, at least in (legal)\
    \ theory?\n"
