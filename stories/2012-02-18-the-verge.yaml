  text: 'In Elizabethan England, "the verge" was an area of legal jurisdiction, defined
    as the territory within a twelve-mile radius of the body of the Queen, wherever
    she happened to be. Thus, a sort of legal, royal "aura".

    Does anybody know if the verge still exists in the present day, at least in (legal)
    theory?
