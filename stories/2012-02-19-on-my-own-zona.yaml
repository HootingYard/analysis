  text: "I have not read Geoff Dyer's new book Zona\_: A Book About A Film About A\
    \ Journey To A Room. As the title indicates, it is devoted to a film, Andrei Tarkovsky's\
    \ Stalker (1979) and to Dyer's obsession with it. I vaguely recall seeing Stalker,\
    \ probably around the time of its release, and have not seen it since. Clearly\
    \ it did not make a great impression on me, unlike the same director's Andrei\
    \ Rublev (1966), which I saw in the mid-seventies and from which I can still remember\
    \ certain scenes. Reading a couple of reviews of Dyer's book led me to wondering\
    \ which film I would choose to write an obsessional book about.\nIt then struck\
    \ me that, much as I might be given to enthusiastic ravings about, say, Celine\
    \ And Julie Go Boating (Jacques Rivette, 1974) or The Falls (Peter Greenaway,\
    \ 1980), or Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942), or Even Dwarfs Started Small\
    \ (Werner Herzog, 1970), or pretty much anything directed by Guy Maddin, it is\
    \ unlikely I will ever sit down and concentrate and write about them at length.\n\
    Dyer's Zona is, apparently, \u201Cone long movie summary, a shot-by-shot rewrite\u201D\
    \ of Stalker, which I assume indicates that he gives us a detailed account of\
    \ the film and wanders off into discursive byways. (At one point he provides us\
    \ with the useful information that, after the completion of Sympathy For The Devil\
    \ / One Plus One (1968), Mick Jagger said of Jean Luc Godard \u201CHe's such a\
    \ fucking twat\u201D.)\nTaking a similar approach, might it not be interesting\
    \ to consider not just one of my favourite films but, say, three of them, and\
    \ construct a narrative that intermingled them, had elements from each colliding,\
    \ happily or otherwise, stirred them together in a pot and made something new\
    \ and strange? I think this is what young persons call a \u201Cmash up\u201D.\
    \ What would happen were I to sprinkle together, in chronological order, Brief\
    \ Encounter (David Lean, 1945),\_Noro\xEEt (Jacques Rivette, 1976), and Die Hard\
    \ (John McTiernan, 1988)?\nCertain choices, or strategies, seem compellingly obvious.\
    \ Hans Gruber and his criminal gang could invade and hold hostage the occupants,\
    \ not of the Nakatomi building but of the coastal castle which is the setting\
    \ for Noro\xEEt. Ah, but the castle is home to a pirate gang rather than a law-abiding\
    \ Japanese corporation. So Giulia, the pirate leader, could be replaced by Laura\
    \ Jesson's well-meaning but exasperating friend Dolly Messiter. Ruthless German\
    \ criminals pitted against Francophone female pirates, both perhaps to be outwitted\
    \ by New York cop John McClane, who is attempting to rescue Laura, aided by Erika\
    \ and Morag, the avengers. Dr Alec Harvey can sit in a police car with Sergeant\
    \ Al Powell, parked close to the castle, perhaps in the lee of the pollarded willows\
    \ by the canal just before the level crossing.\nNoro\xEEt is partly based on The\
    \ Revenger's Tragedy (1606), long attributed to Cyril Tourneur but now thought\
    \ to be the work of Thomas Middleton. These echoes of dark brooding Jacobean tragedy\
    \ should serve to remind us that in Brief Encounter, the part of Dr Stephen Lynn,\
    \ Alec's colleague from whom he borrows the flat for his unseemly and sordid\u2014\
    and ultimately abortive\u2014assignation with Laura, was played by an uncredited\
    \ Valentine Dyall (1908\u20131985), an actor whose sepulchral tones made him famous\
    \ as the Man In Black, host of the long-running BBC radio series Appointment With\
    \ Fear. I do not know if Valentine Dyall ever acted in any Jacobean tragedies,\
    \ but if he did not, he should have. He did do some Shakespeare.\nWe would have\
    \ to find a role for Dr Stephen Lynn, perhaps applying his professional medical\
    \ knowledge in the closing scenes of Noro\xEEt, where at a torchlit nocturnal\
    \ masked ball Morag and Erika and Giulia, oops, I forgot, Dolly Messiter, get\
    \ a bit carried away with the stabbings. I suppose John McClane should be wandering\
    \ about in the dark somewhere, too, bloodied and in his vest.\nI realise that\
    \ I have not yet managed to insert any steam trains, nor Albert Godby nor Myrtle\
    \ Bagot from the Milford Junction tea room, nor Holly Gennaro-McClane, nor the\
    \ pirate castle musicians. But fear not, space will be found in my narrative for\
    \ all of them.\nI am in something of a quandary about the title, for though one\
    \ can cobble together various combinations of, here given in alphabetical order,\
    \ Brief and Die and Encounter and Hard and Noro\xEEt, no one admixture springs\
    \ out as obviously preferable. For the time being, while I continue to worry away\
    \ at it, like a dog with a bone, I shall refer to it as My Own Zona, echoing Geoff\
    \ Dyer.\nCast, in order of appearance:\nHans Gruber\u2014Alan Rickman (1946- )\n\
