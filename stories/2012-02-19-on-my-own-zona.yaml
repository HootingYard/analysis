  text: 'I have not read Geoff Dyer''s new book Zona : A Book About A Film About A
    Journey To A Room. As the title indicates, it is devoted to a film, Andrei Tarkovsky''s
    Stalker (1979) and to Dyer''s obsession with it. I vaguely recall seeing Stalker,
    probably around the time of its release, and have not seen it since. Clearly it
    did not make a great impression on me, unlike the same director''s Andrei Rublev
    (1966), which I saw in the mid-seventies and from which I can still remember certain
    scenes. Reading a couple of reviews of Dyer''s book led me to wondering which
    film I would choose to write an obsessional book about.

    It then struck me that, much as I might be given to enthusiastic ravings about,
    say, Celine And Julie Go Boating (Jacques Rivette, 1974) or The Falls (Peter Greenaway,
    1980), or Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942), or Even Dwarfs Started Small (Werner
    Herzog, 1970), or pretty much anything directed by Guy Maddin, it is unlikely
    I will ever sit down and concentrate and write about them at length.

    Dyer''s Zona is, apparently, "one long movie summary, a shot-by-shot rewrite"
    of Stalker, which I assume indicates that he gives us a detailed account of the
    film and wanders off into discursive byways. (At one point he provides us with
    the useful information that, after the completion of Sympathy For The Devil /
    One Plus One (1968), Mick Jagger said of Jean Luc Godard "He''s such a fucking
    twat".)

    Taking a similar approach, might it not be interesting to consider not just one
    of my favourite films but, say, three of them, and construct a narrative that
    intermingled them, had elements from each colliding, happily or otherwise, stirred
    them together in a pot and made something new and strange? I think this is what
    young persons call a "mash up". What would happen were I to sprinkle together,
    in chronological order, Brief Encounter (David Lean, 1945), Noroit (Jacques Rivette,
    1976), and Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988)?

    Certain choices, or strategies, seem compellingly obvious. Hans Gruber and his
    criminal gang could invade and hold hostage the occupants, not of the Nakatomi
    building but of the coastal castle which is the setting for Noroit. Ah, but the
    castle is home to a pirate gang rather than a law-abiding Japanese corporation.
    So Giulia, the pirate leader, could be replaced by Laura Jesson''s well-meaning
    but exasperating friend Dolly Messiter. Ruthless German criminals pitted against
    Francophone female pirates, both perhaps to be outwitted by New York cop John
    McClane, who is attempting to rescue Laura, aided by Erika and Morag, the avengers.
    Dr Alec Harvey can sit in a police car with Sergeant Al Powell, parked close to
    the castle, perhaps in the lee of the pollarded willows by the canal just before
    the level crossing.

    Noroit is partly based on The Revenger''s Tragedy (1606), long attributed to Cyril
    Tourneur but now thought to be the work of Thomas Middleton. These echoes of dark
    brooding Jacobean tragedy should serve to remind us that in Brief Encounter, the
    part of Dr Stephen Lynn, Alec''s colleague from whom he borrows the flat for his
    unseemly and sordid--and ultimately abortive--assignation with Laura, was played
    by an uncredited Valentine Dyall (1908-1985), an actor whose sepulchral tones
    made him famous as the Man In Black, host of the long-running BBC radio series
    Appointment With Fear. I do not know if Valentine Dyall ever acted in any Jacobean
    tragedies, but if he did not, he should have. He did do some Shakespeare.

    We would have to find a role for Dr Stephen Lynn, perhaps applying his professional
    medical knowledge in the closing scenes of Noroit, where at a torchlit nocturnal
    masked ball Morag and Erika and Giulia, oops, I forgot, Dolly Messiter, get a
    bit carried away with the stabbings. I suppose John McClane should be wandering
    about in the dark somewhere, too, bloodied and in his vest.

    I realise that I have not yet managed to insert any steam trains, nor Albert Godby
    nor Myrtle Bagot from the Milford Junction tea room, nor Holly Gennaro-McClane,
    nor the pirate castle musicians. But fear not, space will be found in my narrative
    for all of them.

    I am in something of a quandary about the title, for though one can cobble together
    various combinations of, here given in alphabetical order, Brief and Die and Encounter
    and Hard and Noroit, no one admixture springs out as obviously preferable. For
    the time being, while I continue to worry away at it, like a dog with a bone,
    I shall refer to it as My Own Zona, echoing Geoff Dyer.
