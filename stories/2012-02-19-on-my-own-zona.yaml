  text: "I have not read Geoff Dyer's new book Zona : A Book About A Film About A\
    \ Journey To A Room. As the title indicates, it is devoted to a film, Andrei Tarkovsky's\
    \ Stalker (1979) and to Dyer's obsession with it. I vaguely recall seeing Stalker,\
    \ probably around the time of its release, and have not seen it since. Clearly\
    \ it did not make a great impression on me, unlike the same director's Andrei\
    \ Rublev (1966), which I saw in the mid-seventies and from which I can still remember\
    \ certain scenes. Reading a couple of reviews of Dyer's book led me to wondering\
    \ which film I would choose to write an obsessional book about.\nIt then struck\
    \ me that, much as I might be given to enthusiastic ravings about, say, Celine\
    \ And Julie Go Boating (Jacques Rivette, 1974) or The Falls (Peter Greenaway,\
    \ 1980), or Random Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy, 1942), or Even Dwarfs Started Small\
    \ (Werner Herzog, 1970), or pretty much anything directed by Guy Maddin, it is\
    \ unlikely I will ever sit down and concentrate and write about them at length.\n\
    Dyer's Zona is, apparently, \"one long movie summary, a shot-by-shot rewrite\"\
    \ of Stalker, which I assume indicates that he gives us a detailed account of\
    \ the film and wanders off into discursive byways. (At one point he provides us\
    \ with the useful information that, after the completion of Sympathy For The Devil\
    \ / One Plus One (1968), Mick Jagger said of Jean Luc Godard \"He's such a fucking\
    \ twat\".)\nTaking a similar approach, might it not be interesting to consider\
    \ not just one of my favourite films but, say, three of them, and construct a\
    \ narrative that intermingled them, had elements from each colliding, happily\
    \ or otherwise, stirred them together in a pot and made something new and strange?\
    \ I think this is what young persons call a \"mash up\". What would happen were\
    \ I to sprinkle together, in chronological order, Brief Encounter (David Lean,\
    \ 1945), Noroit (Jacques Rivette, 1976), and Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988)?\n\
    Certain choices, or strategies, seem compellingly obvious. Hans Gruber and his\
    \ criminal gang could invade and hold hostage the occupants, not of the Nakatomi\
    \ building but of the coastal castle which is the setting for Noroit. Ah, but\
    \ the castle is home to a pirate gang rather than a law-abiding Japanese corporation.\
    \ So Giulia, the pirate leader, could be replaced by Laura Jesson's well-meaning\
    \ but exasperating friend Dolly Messiter. Ruthless German criminals pitted against\
    \ Francophone female pirates, both perhaps to be outwitted by New York cop John\
    \ McClane, who is attempting to rescue Laura, aided by Erika and Morag, the avengers.\
    \ Dr Alec Harvey can sit in a police car with Sergeant Al Powell, parked close\
    \ to the castle, perhaps in the lee of the pollarded willows by the canal just\
    \ before the level crossing.\nNoroit is partly based on The Revenger's Tragedy\
    \ (1606), long attributed to Cyril Tourneur but now thought to be the work of\
    \ Thomas Middleton. These echoes of dark brooding Jacobean tragedy should serve\
    \ to remind us that in Brief Encounter, the part of Dr Stephen Lynn, Alec's colleague\
    \ from whom he borrows the flat for his unseemly and sordid--and ultimately abortive--assignation\
    \ with Laura, was played by an uncredited Valentine Dyall (1908-1985), an actor\
    \ whose sepulchral tones made him famous as the Man In Black, host of the long-running\
    \ BBC radio series Appointment With Fear. I do not know if Valentine Dyall ever\
    \ acted in any Jacobean tragedies, but if he did not, he should have. He did do\
    \ some Shakespeare.\nWe would have to find a role for Dr Stephen Lynn, perhaps\
    \ applying his professional medical knowledge in the closing scenes of Noroit,\
    \ where at a torchlit nocturnal masked ball Morag and Erika and Giulia, oops,\
    \ I forgot, Dolly Messiter, get a bit carried away with the stabbings. I suppose\
    \ John McClane should be wandering about in the dark somewhere, too, bloodied\
    \ and in his vest.\nI realise that I have not yet managed to insert any steam\
    \ trains, nor Albert Godby nor Myrtle Bagot from the Milford Junction tea room,\
    \ nor Holly Gennaro-McClane, nor the pirate castle musicians. But fear not, space\
    \ will be found in my narrative for all of them.\nI am in something of a quandary\
    \ about the title, for though one can cobble together various combinations of,\
    \ here given in alphabetical order, Brief and Die and Encounter and Hard and Noroit,\
    \ no one admixture springs out as obviously preferable. For the time being, while\
    \ I continue to worry away at it, like a dog with a bone, I shall refer to it\
    \ as My Own Zona, echoing Geoff Dyer.\nCast, in order of appearance:\nHans Gruber--Alan\
