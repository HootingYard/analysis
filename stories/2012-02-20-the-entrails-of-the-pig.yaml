  text: 'Today is Collop Monday, so here is what you ought to be eating (and a tip
    on what to do with the servants):

    PIG-FRY--This is a Collop Monday dish, and is a necessary appendage to "cracklings".
    It consists of the fattest parts of the entrails of the pig, broiled in an oven.
    Numerous herbs, spices, &c. are added to it ; and upon the whole, it is a more
    sightly "course" at table than fat cracklings. Sometimes the good wife indulges
    her house with a pancake, as an assurance that she has not forgotten to provide
    for Shrove Tuesday. The servants are also treated with "a drop of something good"
    on this occasion; and are allowed (if they have nothing of importance to require
    their immediate attention) to spend the afternoon in conviviality.

    from The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction: Containing Original
