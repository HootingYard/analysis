  text: '

    In those dark times, astrologer, mathematician and conjuror were accounted the
    same things, and the vulgar did verily believe [Thomas Allen] to be a conjuror.
    He had a great many mathematical instruments and glasses in his chamber, which
    did also confirm the ignorant in their opinion, and his servitor (to impose on
    freshmen and simple people) would tell them that sometimes he should meet the
    spirits, coming up his stairs like bees.

    from John Aubrey, Brief Lives (1972 edition edited by Oliver Lawson Dick)'
