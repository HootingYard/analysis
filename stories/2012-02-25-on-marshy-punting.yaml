  text: "In the poetry of Tennyson, boating has \u201Ca very marshy and punt-like\
    \ character\u201D. This is the view of John Ruskin, in The Harbours Of England\
    \ (1856), in a passage where he claims all poets \u201Csomehow or other, express\
    \ an honest wish for a Spiritual Boat\u201D.\nNow I have not read enough of Tennyson's\
    \ work to assess whether Ruskin is correct. I have certainly not been through\
    \ it with a fine-toothed comb, noting down all Tennyson's boating references and\
    \ judging the marshiness and punt-like character of each, although it occurs to\
    \ me that such an enquiry would actually be quite easily achieved, armed with\
    \ a twenty-first century digitised e-edition of the complete works of Tennyson.\
    \ Perhaps I will save that study for a rain-soaked winter's day, or an insomniac\
    \ night.\nFor the time being, I am minded to trust Ruskin on the matter. I do\
    \ not think it likely that the greatest of all Victorian writers would have said\
    \ Tennyson's boating was marshy and punt-like if it was not. And, in fairness,\
    \ it should be noted that Ruskin qualifies his remark by saying that the poet's\
    \ boating \u201Cin the ordinary way, has a very marshy and punt-like character\u201D\
    . We might also bear in mind that when Ruskin was writing, in 1856, Tennyson was\
    \ only forty-seven years old, and he lived, and continued to pour out poetry,\
    \ for a further thirty-six years, dying in 1892 at the age of eighty-three. Again,\
    \ I am insufficiently familiar with his work to know whether, in those post-The\
    \ Harbours Of England years, Tennyson's boating may have emerged from the punty\
    \ marshes on to the wide and billowing seas. That is something else I can find\
    \ out on a rain-soaked winter's day or during an insomniac night. It is always\
    \ a good idea to have a number of projects in hand, to keep the brain perky.\n\
    Perkiness is not, however, the usual sensation one experiences when punting through\
    \ marshes, or even when rowing through marshes. There is a sense in which one\
    \ is forced to use one's oar more like a punt in a marsh in any case. Clean, brisk\
    \ rowing becomes, at first difficult, then well nigh impossible, as one creeps\
    \ further into the marsh and one's oars become entangled with weeds. The thicker\
    \ the weed, the greater the entanglement, the more desperate the rower. Sooner\
    \ or later, one has to plunge the oar as near as dammit vertically, like a punt,\
    \ into the marsh water, in hope of gaining sufficient purchase to push oneself\
    \ free of weed-entanglement. It is difficult to think of a waterborne experience\
    \ less like the Spiritual Boat wished for by all poets.\nConsider, for example,\
    \ the boating pickle of Dr Alec Harvey, played by Trevor Howard in Brief Encounter\
    \ (David Lean, 1945). Dr Harvey and his soon-to-be-acknowledged-as-such inamorata\
    \ Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) are not even on a marsh, but on a boating lake\
    \ in a park. They are indeed perky. But by dint of what we might term \u201Cissues\u201D\
    \ with the steering of the boat, Dr Harvey is forced\u2014as if he were stuck\
    \ in a Tennysonian marsh\u2014to stand up and plunge the oar into the water as\
    \ near as dammit vertically in hope of gaining purchase to push. He falls into\
    \ the lake. This is an important episode in the film, in that it immediately precedes\
    \ the scene where Dr Harvey and Mrs Jesson first broach, in repressed and almost\
    \ strangulated conversation, the fact that they are besotted with each other.\
    \ In that sense\u2014and perhaps only in that sense\u2014the boat out of which\
    \ Dr Harvey falls into the lake can be seen as a Spiritual Boat, one worthy of\
    \ attention by a poet. I do not know if any versifier has ever composed a poem\
    \ upon this scene in the film, but I for one would like to have read what, say,\
    \ Sylvia Plath might have made out of it. Unlike Dr Harvey and Mrs Jesson, Sylvia\
    \ Plath and her inamorata Ted Hughes do not seem to have suffered from that tendency\
    \ to be \u201Cwithdrawn and shy and\u2026 difficult\u201D, as Mrs Jesson puts\
    \ it. Indeed, when they first met, and kissed, Sylvia Plath drew blood from Ted\
    \ Hughes's cheek, or it might have been the other way about, I can never quite\
    \ remember. Whichever it was, there is no such savage bloody kiss in Brief Encounter.\
    \ In a rewritten, updated version, perhaps there could be, while the couple are\
    \ in the boat on the lake in the park, before Dr Harvey falls in to the water.\n\
    There is another filmic boat, or rather raft, which becomes hopelessly stuck in\
    \ a marsh, or rather on a river, in Aguirre, The Wrath Of God (Werner Herzog,\
    \ 1972). Here we can well imagine blood being spilled, though not by kisses. And\
    \ though we have a raft on a river rather than a boat on a marsh, few I think\
    \ would argue that the ambience, especially towards the end of the film, is close\
    \ to what Ruskin called Tennyson's \u201Cmarshy and punt-like\u201D boating. Also,\
    \ there are monkeys. Lope de Aguirre's raft is, spectacularly, a Spiritual Boat,\
    \ and would have made an ideal subject for either Sylvia or for Ted, had they\
    \ once decided to turn their poetic brains towards it.\nTennyson, too, might profitably\
    \ have addressed the story. Though he was of course long cold in his grave before\
    \ Werner Herzog made his film, Aguirre is based on real events that took place\
    \ in 1561, events known about by, for example, Sir Walter Ralegh, who read about\
    \ them before swanning off to discover El Dorado in 1595. Intriguingly, at the\
    \ time he was preparing for his expedition, Ralegh was living at Sherborne Lodge\
    \ in Devon. As Charles Nicholl describes it in The Creature In The Map (1995),\
    \ \u201Cthe Lodge stood on rough land above a boggy stretch of the Yeo known as\
    \ Black Marsh\u201D. Did Ralegh go boating on Black Marsh? Did his oar or punt\
    \ become entangled in weed and did he plunge the oar in as near as dammit vertically\
    \ in hope of gaining sufficient purchase to push himself free and, like Dr Harvey,\
    \ topple out of his boat into the water? And were there, as with Aguirre, monkeys?\n\
    There is a poem to be written about such a scene."
