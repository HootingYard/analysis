  text: 'And you may find yourself on a darkling plain. Under a vast purple cloud-bruised
    sky, you smoke your pipe. The air is still. It is cold, but not bitter cold, and
    you have the warmth from the bowl of your pipe. You are wearing a scarf, too,
    silken, and embroidered with scenes of historic military endeavour. The same scenes
    recur on the embroidery of the handkerchief you have stuffed into the breast pocket
    of your stylish Hubert Clompstock dress suit, over which you are wearing a thick
    black overcoat. The soldiery in the military scenes sport moustaches similar to
    your own, which bristles in the cold air out on the darkling plain. You forgot
    to bring with you your shooting stick, so you must stand, as the purple of the
    sky grows deeper, deeper, darkening the plain, almost featureless save for here
    and there a sprig or shrub, a ditch or sump. What in heaven''s name are you doing
    here?

    You were summoned by a mysterious telegram. The mystery of the telegram lay in
    its provenance, not in the message it conveyed, which could not have been more
    explicit. It summoned you to the darkling plain, and specified the date and the
    time, and the exact location, with points of latitude and longitude. The sender
    knew you were an aficionado of maps and, in your younger days, of the sport of
    orienteering, and that you would therefore respond to a summons which spoke to
    your inner pangs, for map reading and past orienteering triumphs. Before leaving
    the house that evening you took a duster to the cups and trophies on your mantelpiece.
    You buffed them till they shone. Then, after a last look at the map of the terrain
    of the darkling plain, you popped in to one of the trouser pockets of your stylish
    Hubert Clompstock dress suit your trusty compass, battered and dented by age,
    and not quite as accurate in its readings as once it was, due to magnetic decay.
    You know its ways so well, however, that you are able to make the mental calculations
    necessary to correct its inaccuracies as easily as falling off a log. On the darkling
    plain, there are no felled or fallen logs for you to fall off, nor even to trip
    over or to bump into, for no trees grow nor have ever grown here on the darkling
    plain. You obeyed the summons but you still do not know why you are here.

    You take from another of the pockets of the trousers of your stylish Hubert Clompstock
    dress suit your pocket watch. It is a reliable timepiece. You wound it up forty
    years ago and it has never needed to be wound up again. It ticks and tocks relentlessly,
    implacably, and almost silently. Somehow it even manages to adjust itself when
    there are sudden shifts in the official calculation of time within your territory.
    What a watch!, you have been known to say to yourself, in wonderment, when prompted.
    This is no time for such wonderment. You take it from your pocket merely to satisfy
    yourself, for the umpteenth time, that you are here present upon the designated
    spot upon the darkling plain at the time required by the summons. You made sure
    you were early, for you have always set great store by punctuality. Now the hours
    and minutes have ticked and tocked away and the moment has come. You have no idea
    what will happen.

    Suddenly, over to your left, to the west, according to your compass, there is
    a terrible sound, a fearsome din as terrible as an army with banners. You turn
    and peer and see, looming into view through the cold darkness, an army with banners.
    Almost at once there is a terrible sound, a fearsome din, over to your right,
    to the east, and you spin around and peer and see, looming into view through the
    cold darkness, equally terrible, another army with banners. The two armies are
    heading directly towards one another, and you are in the middle, at the spot where,
    soon enough, soon enough, they will meet.

    And when they meet, they will clash. They are ignorant armies, destined to clash
    by night upon a darkling plain. At the head of one army, the one to the west,
    is Capitano Alphonso Fathead. He is reputed to be the most ignorant commander
    of an army in the known world. His troops are hand-picked for their fathomless
    stupidity. Most of them display such witlessness that they cannot even tie the
    laces of their military boots, a task which is outsourced to a bootlace-tying
    consultancy at ruinous cost, so ruinous that they can barely afford any weaponry.
    That is why the ignorant army is armed merely with sticks and pebbles, elastic
    bands and bags of icing sugar.

    The other army, the one to the east, marches to the drumbeat pounded by Generalissimo
    Fulgencio Dimwit. If such a thing were possible, he is considered to be as ignorant
    as the Capitano, his foe. The Generalissimo is so dense he looks upon every phenomenon
    presented to his senses as a thing of profound and utter bafflement. He understands
    nothing. He cannot even hand-pick his soldiery, so the ragtag rabble who march
    in his wake have fetched up with him by accident or calamity or mishap. They only
    march in the right direction because each is tied to the Generalissimo by a length
    of string, the knots tied by a knot-tying consultancy retained at ruinous cost,
    so ruinous that they can barely afford any weaponry. That is why this second ignorant
    army is armed merely with twigs and sawdust, pin-cushions and clementine pips.

    And so the ignorant armies approach each other to clash by night upon a darkling
    plain. And you have been summoned there, you realise, to act as referee. You dig
    into yet another pocket of the trousers of your stylish Hubert Clompstock dress
    suit and retrieve your whistle. It is a whistle which has served you well, over
    untold years, in circumstances fair and foul. As the ignorant armies prance and
    mince and lollop ever closer, you hold the whistle to your lips and prepare to
    PARP!!!'
