  text: 'In the annals of light entertainment, few acts have been as universally loved
    as the Screaming Abdabs. It is curious, however, that as much as they were adored,
    they were completely misunderstood. Many, if not most of their fans loved them
    for all the wrong reasons. The misapprehension of what they were about niggled
    certain members of the troupe, though others were content enough with the popular
    adulation, and the rewards it brought in its train.

    They began as circus performers, under the direction of Maud Abdab, usually known
    as Old Ma Abdab. Contemporary reports of their first appearances suggest that
    the act was fully formed from the very beginning. Old Ma and her brood of little
    Abdabs would stand together, in a line, in the middle of the big top, and scream
    their heads off for about a quarter of an hour. It is difficult to give the flavour
    of the act in plain prose without resorting to long strings of capital letters
    and exclamation marks. EEEEKKKK!!!! and AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!! will have to do,
    I''m afraid, though they fail to convey the sheer volume and blood-curdling terror
    of the Abdabs'' screaming.

    Early audiences seem to have believed that the Screaming Abdabs were screaming
    in response to the circus clowns. This may indeed be the origin of the cliche
    that clowns are in some ways disturbing and frightening. They are not. The circus
    clown is simply a man or woman who cuts capers and cavorts and blunders about
    while wearing bright baggy apparel and caked in makeup. Only a milquetoast would
    be scared of them.

    Whether their audiences were composed of milquetoasts and milksops or not, the
    Screaming Abdabs were an immediate hit. They were soon enough too big for even
    the biggest of big tops to contain them, and they progressed to the music hall.
    From the music hall they moved on to variety theatres, and then to radio, television,
    and the big screen. Throughout, the act remained in all essentials exactly the
    same. As Old Ma Abdab got old and doddery, and the little Abdabs grew to adulthood
    and had tinies of their own, so the troupe replenished itself. It remained a family
    affair.

    It was once they were away from the circus, and thus away from the supposedly
    frightening clowns, that the various misunderstandings about their act began to
    proliferate. The point to recall is that Old Ma Abdab made very clear the nature
    of the Screaming Abdabs in her memoir, where she wrote: "We are just simple folk
    who stand in a line and scream our heads off." So straightforward an explanation
    seems not to have satisfied many of their fans, who devised all sorts of theories
    to account for their mass appeal.

    The most notorious was probably that of the French existentialist Jean-Luc Existent,
    who bashed out innumerable essays and colour supplement feature articles and even
    entire books. The gist of his theory is difficult to disentangle from the thicket
    of clogged and unreadable texte in which he expounded it, over and over again.
    At a guess, and with a headache, I would say that he saw, or heard, in the Screaming
    Abdabs something akin to "original man, shouting his consonants... in yells of
    awe and anger at his tragic state, at his own self-awareness and at his own helplessness
    before the void". The quotation is from that terrible old fraud, the American
    painter Barnett Newman, himself a great devotee of the Screaming Abdabs. There
    is a story that a wealthy patron commissioned Newman to paint a group portrait
    of the troupe, unaware that, as the critic Robert Hughes noted, he "had no discernible
    talent as a draftsman" and "a reductive cast of mind". The patron was apparently
    not best pleased to be presented with a large canvas painted a single shade of
    red, with a vertical yellow stripe slightly off-centre.

    The French pseud''s theory, however, led many to take a similar view of the Screaming
    Abdabs, seeing their screaming as somehow representative of something other than
    pure unbridled screaming. What this "other" was varied according to the particular
    hobbyhorse of whoever was chucking their ha''penny''s worth into the critical
    pot. Echoes were found of Franz Kafka, Edvard Munch, Sylvia Plath, E M Cioran,
    Samuel Beckett, Rolf Harris and Harold Pinter. It is telling, I think, that when
    questioned, at length, by Russell Harty, Popsy Abdab, a second generation Screaming
    Abdab, insisted she had never heard of any of these people. While we must acknowledge
    that the purity of their screaming is sui generis, I must reluctantly admit that
    the link with Pinter may carry some weight, if only because the late playwright
    was occasionally mistaken for a member of the Screaming Abdabs, for instance when
    he was thinking about American presidents or having to deal with waiters, taxi
    drivers, and other representatives of the little people.

    The twenty-first century has, alas, not been kind to the Screaming Abdabs. Old
    Ma Abdab is long dead, the most committed members of the troupe are elderly and
    infirm, and the younger Abdabs seem more inclined to post videos on YouTube rather
    than to engage in live performance. We shall not see, nor hear, with our hands
    over our ears, their like again.'
