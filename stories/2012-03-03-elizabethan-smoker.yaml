  text: "The estimable Wartime Housewife has a rant about the latest stupidity regarding\
    \ tobacco sales, so I don't have to. Instead, in a no doubt doomed attempt to\
    \ redress the balance, here is a splendid image of a smoker unburdened by modern\
    \ restrictions. John White's \u201CThe Flyer\u201D (1587) shows an Algonquian\
    \ shaman prancing around, with his tobacco in a pouch slung around his waist and,\
    \ most importantly, a small black bird tied to his head. I think perhaps this\
    \ is the correct attitude to adopt.\n"
