  text: 'The estimable Wartime Housewife has a rant about the latest stupidity regarding
    tobacco sales, so I don''t have to. Instead, in a no doubt doomed attempt to redress
    the balance, here is a splendid image of a smoker unburdened by modern restrictions.
    John White''s "The Flyer" (1587) shows an Algonquian shaman prancing around, with
    his tobacco in a pouch slung around his waist and, most importantly, a small black
    bird tied to his head. I think perhaps this is the correct attitude to adopt.
