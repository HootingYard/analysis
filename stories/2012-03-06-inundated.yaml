  text: 'Over the past week or so, your super soaraway Hooting Yard has been inundated,
    inundated I tell you!, with spam comments. Usually there are three or four a day,
    now there are hundreds. What this means is that I cannot be bothered to skim through
    all the bollocks* to whittle out any genuine comments that are sometimes misdirected
    down the spam chute. So, if you send a comment and it fails to appear in due time,
    please either try again or send me an email to let me know.

    ADDENDUM : * I am reminded that this useful word ought to be spelled in the Beckettian
    manner, i.e. ballocks.'
