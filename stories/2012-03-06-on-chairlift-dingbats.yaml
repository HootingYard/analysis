  text: 'I once had the unnerving experience of meeting, at a cocktail party in an
    Alpine skiing resort, a real, living and breathing chairlift dingbat. To say I
    was flabbergasted is an understatement. Like most people, I believed that the
    Alpine chairlift dingbat was a figure of myth, a boogie man of whom tales were
    told to frighten the tinies. But no. Here he was, leaning against a mantelpiece,
    nursing a glass of sfizziggio, telling amusing anecdotes to a rapt audience.

    I turned to my companion and hissed, "You cannot seriously expect me to believe
    that this charming and insouciant fellow is a chairlift dingbat?"

    My companion, who had steered me through the crowds to this corner of the room
    purposely to introduce me to the chairlift dingbat, put her finger to her lips.

    "Hush," she said, "Just wait and see."

    We waited for a break in the conversation and, when it came, my companion, with
    her effortless social skills, did as she had promised, drew the chairlift dingbat
    away from the mantelpiece, and introduced us. We talked for over an hour that
    evening, and parted, very late, having arranged to meet for het ontbijt in a spectacular
    Flemish cafe in the foothills of an important Alp the next morning. He failed
    to appear. When I returned to my hotel, all waffled up, I bumped into my companion
    in the lobby.

    "No show," I complained, "And I still don''t believe he is a chairlift dingbat.
    We talked for an hour at the cocktail party last night, and he was nothing if
    not sophisticated and amusing and insouciant. He betrayed no sign of being what
    you persist in claiming he is."

    "Did you ask him outright?" asked my companion.

    "Of course not!" I protested, "It would be an unforgiveable social gaffe to ask
    such a question at a sophisticated cocktail party."

    "That is true," she conceded, "And come to think of it, he is unlikely to have
    given an honest answer. Chairlift dingbats are careful to protect their anonymity
    when not actually lolling in the corner of a chairlift."

    "Meaning...?" I asked.

    "Meaning that they carefully cultivate the demeanour of a chairlift dingbat but
    are adept at sloughing it off the moment they step out of the chairlift on to
    terra firma," she said.

    I had no idea what she was talking about, and I was too stodged with waffles to
    care.

    "I am going to lie down in the dark," I said.

    As I lay in the dark, I thought about all I knew--or thought I knew--of chairlift
    dingbats. That they lurked, unseen, in the corners of chairlifts, waiting to accost
    the unsuspecting chairlift passenger on his ride to or from the top of an Alpine
    peak. That they had the appearance of singularly unappealing Swiss yokels and
    gave off an overpowering whiff of goat. That the babbling to which they subjected
    their victim was largely unintelligible. That within the confines of the chairlift,
    creaking on its cables, suspended over the treacherous snow-covered mountain slopes,
    to be trapped with a chairlift dingbat was a fate too horrible to imagine. That
    so repugnant was the mere presence of the chairlift dingbat that many a victim
    felt compelled to throw open the door of the chairlift and hurl themselves to
    certain death on the treacherous snow-covered mountain slopes below. That when
    the Alpine politti came to investigate the suicide, there was never a trace to
    be found of the chairlift dingbat, save for vestigial traces of goaty whiff, soon
    dispersed in the sparkling Alpine chill.

    I sat up in the dark of my hotel room and poured myself a stiffener from the bottle
    of vapido ague on the bedside table. It was simply incomprehensible that the sophisticated
    chap who had amused me with anecdotes at a sophisticated cocktail party the night
    before could possibly be a chairlift dingbat. Dammit, surely such maddening creatures
    did not even exist, were but the invention of Alpine mythmakers and storytellers.
    Obviously the cocktail party guest and my companion were in cahoots, playing a
    trick on me, even now were probably sat together in the spectacular Flemish cafe
    laughing their heads off at my expense. I took another swig, put on my Christopher
    Plummer-style Tyrolean jacket, and headed out into the streets of the skiing resort.
    The air was cold and clear and crisp.

    I had sat in the spectacular Flemish cafe a couple of hours ago. Now it was boarded
    up, and there was a sign in the window. "We have moved", it said, in several different
    languages, in many of which I was fluent. I rummaged in my Tyrolean jacket pocket
    for my gazetteer, to ascertain the location of the new address. The cafe had moved
    to the summit of the important Alp at the foot of which lay the resort. It was
    now accessible only by chairlift.

    I made my way to the chairlift station, and towards the worst horror of all.'
