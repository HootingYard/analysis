  text: 'There is an old joke, a proper chestnut, which begins "A mod and a rocker
    and a widow and an orphan walk into a bar..." The Oxford English Dictionary does
    not tell us why we use the word chestnut in this context. It says that the usage
    "probably" originated in the United States and, curiously, that "the newspapers
    of 1886-7 contain numerous circumstantial explanations palpably invented for the
    purpose". What was in the air in those two years that suddenly made this a debatable
    issue? Perhaps there was a spate of chestnut madness, similar to the carrot madness
    that ran rife in Belgium and northern France in the 1850s. No convincing explanation
    has ever been given for the latter episode, and it happened too late to be addressed
    by Charles Mackay in Extraordinary Popular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds
    (1841).

    The bar into which the mod and the rocker and the widow and the orphan walk in
    the joke is usually specified to be a seafront bar, no doubt on account of the
    infamous seaside resort pitched battles between mods and rockers--though not between
    widows and orphans--in the mid-1960s. Interestingly, however, in one persistently
    popular variant of the gag, the punchline depends heavily on the bar being the
    drinking den known as the Tip Top Annexe, a rather seedy establishment on the
    Crescent in Aden, when it was Prince of Wales Crescent in the British Protectorate
    of Aden. This was close to the Grand Hotel De L''Univers, where Arthur Rimbaud
    fetched up on his arrival in Aden in August 1880. There is an echo of Rimbaud
    in some versions of the joke, when the rocker, or sometimes the widow, is said
    to have "dried [him- or herself] in the air of crime". The joke works well enough
    with or without this observation, as indeed it does when it is not set in the
    Tip Top Annexe, so long as the punchline is modified accordingly.

    In his study Draining The Last Vestiges Of Humour Out Of The Funniest Gags, the
    pop psychologist Dr Desmond Drain frets away, like a dog with a bone, at the idea
    that the mod and the rocker and the widow and the orphan are not, as we would
    assume, four persons, but two. In this reading, the mod is the widow and the rocker
    is the orphan. He goes on to posit, in further garbled analytical posturing, that
    they are a couple in love, smitten with each other, who, before entering the bar--which
    may or may not be the Tip Top Annexe--have had a tiff, because of a crime committed,
    either by the mod/widow or the rocker/orphan, where one sides with, or personifies,
    law and order, and the other represents the forces of crime, disorder, and even,
    at a pinch, existential chaos. Dr Drain''s own preconceptions and prejudices regarding
    the values inherent in the different types of music championed by mods and rockers
    tend to colour his argument, as does the fact that he was orphaned at an early
    age, when his parents died in the riots which occurred during the outbreak of
    citrus fruit madness in south coast seaside resorts in the 1970s. Whether or not
    one gives credence to his interpretation, most people agree that the joke works
    better with four protagonists rather than two.

    Or rather, with five protagonists, for let us not forget that essential addendum,
    the barman who serves their drinks. Tip Top Annexe types like to have him wearing
    either a fez or a pith helmet, but any sort of headgear serves equally well. He
    does have to wear something on his head, however, simply to be able to incorporate
    into the joke the part where he takes it off and places it on the bar counter.
    As an experiment, I once told the joke without including this detail and, as expected,
    it fell completely flat. In fact, some among my audience were so miffed, in spite
    of being fully aware they had been assembled for the specific purpose of experimental
    joke-telling research, that they stooped to pick up pebbles and shingle from the
    beach and pelted me with them, until I had to make a run for it to the safety
    of the railway station. At least it was pebbles rather than shivs, otherwise it
    would have been like a scene from Brighton Rock. It was probably not a good idea
    to conduct my research at the seaside.

    In some variants of the joke, though intriguingly not always those which insist
    upon the Tip Top Annexe setting in Aden, the barman''s appearance is given, and
    he closely resembles Arthur Rimbaud. We are told he has "the perfectly oval face
    of an angel in exile" (Verlaine), and is "sympathique... speaks little, and accompanies
    his brief comments with odd little cutting gestures with his right hand" (Bardey).
    It is with one of these cutting gestures that the barman accidentally knocks over
    the absinthe ordered by the mod--or sometimes by the rocker--leading directly
    to what today''s barbarians might call the "LOL moment, innit" midway through
    the joke, a particularly clever insertion as it is often taken as the punchline.
    That the joke then continues only serves to heighten the uproarious hilarity of
    its side-splitting conclusion. Where the odd little cutting gestures by the barman
    are absent, the glass of absinthe, or lemonade or vapido ague, is knocked over
    by another agency, which might be a gust of wind, a stray dog, or an invisible
    sprite.

    It is the venerability of the joke, its status as an old chestnut--not a carrot
    nor a piece of citrus fruit--which has led, in years of telling and retelling,
    to so many variations. Their profusion has persuaded some that an effort ought
    to be made to recover the Ur-joke, stripped of all inessentials. One such attempt,
    attributed to the japester Fat Billy Cannonball, which has gone down a storm at
    certain northern seaside resorts, dispenses with the mod and the rocker and the
    widow and the orphan, and has Arthur Rimbaud himself, walking into the bar of
    the Grand Hotel De L''Univers on Prince of Wales Crescent in the British Protectorate
    of Aden on a specific day in August 1880, and ordering an absinthe, or "this sage-bush
    of the glaciers", as he puts it. I have yet to hear this version in its entirety,
    but I have already been rendered helpless with mirth, and must roll about on the
    floor, convulsed, as if in the throes of a fit. Excuse me while I do just that.
