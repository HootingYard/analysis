  text: 'And the Lord came unto the plains of Gath. And he was footsore, having walked
    for many days without rest. And he sat him down upon one of the tussocks which
    grow upon the plains of Gath. Then there came a widow woman driving before her
    a goat. And the goat was thin and bony and of Satanic mien. And the Lord said
    unto the widow woman:

    "Woman! I am your Lord and I am footsore having walked for many days without rest.
    I have great thirst. Succour me with milk from your goat. This I command."

    Thereupon the widow woman did stop upon her journey and she tied her goat with
    a halter to a post that was stuck fast in the earth upon the plains of Gath. And
    she sat down upon the tussock next to the Lord and took from her pouch an infusion
    of herbs and roots all rolled in the leaf of a phryxinga shrub and one end of
    this she ignited with fire from heaven and she breathed in the fumes thereof.

    "My goat is old and tired and thin and bony and has no milk to give," said the
    widow woman.

    "Then thou shalt roast in the pits of hell for eternity," said the Lord.

    But before the Lord could make good his threat there came passing upon the plains
    of Gath several more widow women, some with goats and some with widows'' mites.
    And the Lord was sore affrighted. Then the widows all together began a keening
    and a caterwauling and made so mighty a din that the Lord placed his hands over
    his ears. And the goats did join in, braying, and the widows'' mites did join
    in, buzzing. And so great was the racket of the keening and the braying and the
    buzzing that the sun itself trembled and hid and darkness fell upon the plains
    of Gath.

    Then from out of the darkness there came a minstrel toiling across the plains
    of Gath. And when he came upon the Lord and the widow women and the goats and
    the widows'' mites he did stop and he placed his lyre upon the ground and listened.
    And when after many hours passed and the hubbub ceased the minstrel did speak
    unto the widow women.

    "Women! I have come far, for I am of a brutish Germanic tribe, a stranger in the
    plains of Gath. I am a minstrel, but I have put aside my lyre for I am bewitched
    by the din of your keening and caterwauling, and the braying of your goats, and
    the buzzing of your widows'' mites. Come follow me, on the long journey back to
    the tenebrous Teutonic forests from whence I came, that you might keen and caterwaul
    and bray and buzz to my tribespeople, for your racket will be as balm to their
    ears in the land of Improv."

    But before the widow women could follow the minstrel from that place, the Lord
    rose up from his tussock and with great fury he shouted,

    "Is there not one among you who will give succour to your Lord in his grievous
    state upon the plains of Gath in the darkness?"

    And there was silence. And then the sun did reappear, flooding the plains of Gath
    with light, and close by the tussock a fountain burst forth from the soil, shooting
    a jet of pure bubbling water high into the air. And the Lord did stand beneath
    it with his head upturned and his mouth open and he drank of the water. And when
    he was sated he took a rod and a staff and began to smite the widow women and
    the goats and the minstrel in terrible rage. But the widows'' mites were tiny
    and they buzzed away from the scene of the smiting. They buzzed to a cluster of
    huts just beyond the horizon where there lived a satrap and his minions. And hearing
    the buzzing of the widows'' mites the satrap and his minions took up their clubs
    and their staves and their sticks and they did rush like flies across the plains
    of Gath to the tussock where the Lord was in a great frenzy. And the lyre of the
    minstrel lay shattered and broken upon the ground.

    And the satrap and his minions did set upon the Lord with all their might. And
    when he was bashed senseless they carried him away across the plains of Gath to
    their cluster of huts where they locked him up in durance vile. And the widow
    women and their goats did lick their wounds and dust themselves down and they
    were joined by the widows'' mites and they did follow the minstrel on a long journey
    to the tenebrous Teutonic forests where they did keen and caterwaul and bray and
    buzz and bewitch the tribespeople of Improv, yea unto every generation.

    And in his dungeon in a cluster of huts upon the plains of Gath the Lord did bewail
    his fate. And there came unto him an angel, saying:

    "Lord, I am an angel sent by another, greater Lord than thee. I come from haunts
    of coot and hern, I make a sudden sally. And sparkle out among the fern to bicker
    down a valley. It is the valley of the shadow of death and the valley along which
    you must walk unless you buck your ideas up. I shall fling open the doors of your
    prison if you will but pledge to crawl upon your belly across the plains of Gath
    and beyond, all the way to the far remote tenebrous Teutonic forests, there to
    seek forgiveness from the widow women and their goats and their widows'' mites
    and the minstrel. Do as I command, and when again they keen and caterwaul and
    bray and buzz, place not your hands over your ears, but stand upon a podium and
    wave a baton. And your eyes shall glint and your lank and greasy tresses will
    become as a bouffant. And you will be called Maestro."

    And the Lord did as he was bid by the angel, and he betook himself upon his belly
    to Improv in Ulm.

    Here endeth the lesson.'
