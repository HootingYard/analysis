  text: 'An amusing letter in today''s Grauniad:

    Having written a piece of music based on the sinking of the Titanic, I might perhaps
    be lumped with the Titanoraks (Pass notes, G2, 5 March). Inevitably this 1969
    piece is being performed several times this year. Recently a young Belgian composer
    contacted me to ask if his composition on the subject might be performed alongside
    mine in his country. His piece is written from the point of view of the iceberg.
