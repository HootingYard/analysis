  text: 'Apropos of nothing in particular, I thought I would share with you an inexplicable
    ornithological mixup which occurred some twenty years ago. I was constructing
    a set of twenty-six alphabetical drawings, and decided that O would stand for
    Ortolan. How I arrived at this word without knowing what it meant I cannot recall.
    Anyway, I looked it up and learned that Ortolan was a synonym for Bunting. I then
    drew a picture of a string of triangular flags such as one might find at an outdoor
    gala. Only after the picture had been published, along with its twenty-five compadres,
    in the big fat paperback Small Press Yearbook (date forgotten, but circa 1990)
    did I discover that the Bunting in question was not flags but a bird. As readers
    know, since the last century my ornithological erudition has progressed by leaps
    and bounds and little birdy hops a la the robin. I cannot find a copy of my drawing,
    so these snaps, from here and here, must suffice.


    Bunting, but not Ortolan


    Both Bunting and Ortolan'
