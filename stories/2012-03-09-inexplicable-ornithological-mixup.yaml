  text: "Apropos of nothing in particular, I thought I would share with you an inexplicable\
    \ ornithological mixup which occurred some twenty years ago. I was constructing\
    \ a set of twenty-six alphabetical drawings, and decided that O would stand for\
    \ Ortolan. How I arrived at this word without knowing what it meant I cannot recall.\
    \ Anyway, I looked it up and learned that Ortolan was a synonym for Bunting. I\
    \ then drew a picture of a string of triangular flags such as one might find at\
    \ an outdoor gala. Only after the picture had been published, along with its twenty-five\
    \ compadres, in the big fat paperback Small Press Yearbook (date forgotten, but\
    \ circa 1990) did I discover that the Bunting in question was not flags but a\
    \ bird. As readers know, since the last century my ornithological erudition has\
    \ progressed by leaps and bounds and little birdy hops \xE0\_la the robin. I cannot\
    \ find a copy of my drawing, so these snaps, from here and here, must suffice.\n\
    \nBunting, but not Ortolan\n\nBoth Bunting and Ortolan"
