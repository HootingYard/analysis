  text: "There I was, crumpled and decisive, standing between two trees on the edge\
    \ of the Blister Lane Bypass. The trees were both yews, I think. I was looking\
    \ for curlews. The first one I saw was made of plastic, it was a toy or perhaps\
    \ a decorative figurine. It had been abandoned in the gutter. Then I saw a second\
    \ curlew, swooping across the blue, blue sky. I did not know it then, but within\
    \ hours there would be no blue to be seen, for dark and brooding thunderclouds\
    \ would waft in from the east. A third curlew appeared in my mind's eye. It was\
    \ gigantic and ferocious and terrifying. I shuddered. I walked away from the yews,\
    \ in the direction of Bodger's Spinney, pulling my resplendent teal cardigan tight\
    \ about my torso. There was a fourth curlew, an embroidered one, on my necktie.\
    \ Why in the name of heaven was I wearing a necktie? All of a sudden this length\
    \ of fabric wrapped around my neck felt like a hangman's noose. I took it off,\
    \ with violent jerks, and discarded it in a puddle, where it would remain until\
    \ discovered later that day by a scavenging hobbledehoy from The Bashings, that\
    \ gloomy cluster of huts which sane people shirk. Oh, as the tie dropped into\
    \ the puddle I saw a fugitive reflection in the water of the embroidered curlew,\
    \ so that made five. It was still only ten in the morning.\nBy five past ten I\
    \ had seen another dozen curlews, or it may have been a single curlew seen twelve\
    \ times, I cannot be altogether certain. I was standing on Sawdust Bridge at the\
    \ time, feeling hopeless and disgruntled and cantankerous. The tunic I was wearing\
    \ beneath my cardigan, which I had stolen from an ingrate, was playing havoc with\
    \ my [invented skin disease], and rashes were appearing. My doctor had prescribed\
    \ a daily dose of some sort of bean mashed up into a bowl of milk of magnesia,\
    \ and I had forgotten to take my dose that morning, so keen was I to see curlews.\n\
    Later I took a mop and began to clean the floor of one of the corridors in an\
    \ ugly building which shall remain nameless. I was indoors now, so unlikely to\
    \ see any curlews. But lo!, little Maisie\u2014a polka-dot-dressed orphan whose\
    \ parents perished in the Tet Offensive\u2014came rushing up to me clutching her\
    \ stamp album and showed me her latest acquisitions, a set of twenty bird-related\
    \ thematics issued by the Tantarabim Interim Authority. I could not help but note,\
    \ as I shared my Brazil nuts with starving Maisie, that eight of the stamps depicted\
    \ curlews.\nOn my way home, as the evening closed in and dark thoughts of skulduggery\
    \ frolicked in my throbbing skull, I saw a dead curlew on the canal towpath. Bird\
    \ detectives had already thrown a cordon around it, so I was unable to take a\
    \ closer look.\nThat night, by candlelight, I took out my ledger and gave names\
    \ to each of the twenty-six curlews I had seen. Alcibiades, Bim, Chumpot, Dromedary,\
    \ Eidolon, Flaps, Gash, Heliogabalus, Inthod\u2026. That is how I started my list.\
    \ Then I recalled that I had set out to see forty-four curlews. I gnashed my teeth\
    \ in misery and dejection. And I recalled that I had forgotten to wring out the\
    \ mop.\nYou will recognise the above as an extract from Dobson's pamphletto A\
    \ Description Of And Reverie Upon Forty-Four Curlews (out of print). Note that\
    \ I use the word \u201Cpamphletto\u201D to distinguish this work from the general\
    \ run of pamphlets spewed out by Dobson. Note, too, that at this time, and in\
    \ this place, I am not going to explain the difference between the pamphlets and\
    \ the pamphlettos. Let it gnaw away at your mental innards, if you will.\nOur\
    \ purpose today is to subject the text to analysis. I have been asked innumerable\
    \ times\u2014well, numerable, in that I can count the times I have been asked,\
    \ on the fingers of one maimed hand\u2014whether Dobson is telling the truth,\
    \ or making the whole thing up. No matter how rigorous our analysis, irrespective\
    \ of the analytical techniques employed, I am afraid to say this is an unanswerable\
    \ question. One would need to delve deep into the biography of the pamphleteer,\
    \ deeper than anyone with working wits in their head has ever seen fit to delve,\
    \ to pronounce the passage true or false. It may even be a combination of the\
    \ two, partly fact and partly fiction. Or Dobson may have sincerely believed it\
    \ to be true, when it was actually an hallucination, or a series of hallucinations,\
    \ brought on by exhaustion or the jangles or entrancement by a tiny sinister gnome-like\
    \ fellow dressed all in green. It is unlikely we will ever know.\nThis is not\
    \ to say that we cannot analyse the passage, using certain techniques developed\
    \ by Bl\xF6tzmann, to ascertain the more important question of whether Dobson\
    \ would have known a curlew when he saw one. After all, he was a man of boundless\
    \ ornithological ignorance, as is attested not only by his inamorata Marigold\
    \ Chew and by several of his acquaintances, not all of them shady characters,\
    \ but by the pamphleteer himself, in his own words, notably in the pamphlet My\
    \ Boundless Ornithological Ignorance, Together With A Paean Of Praise To Googie\
    \ Withers (out of print). And careful study of the present text reveals that,\
    \ in spite of the promise in the title to describe forty-four curlews, Dobson\
    \ barely has a word to say about their appearance. Let us tabulate, in an objective\
    \ tabulating manner, what he does say.\nCurlew Number One\_: plastic\nCurlew Number\
    \ Two\_: swooping\nCurlew Number Three\_: gigantic, ferocious and terrifying,\
    \ but also imaginary\nCurlew Number Four\_: embroidered\nCurlew Number Five\_\
    : Curlew Number Four reflected in a puddle\nIt is with reluctance that I am going\
    \ to abandon my exciting tabulation, or tabulature, so soon, but quite frankly\
    \ Dobson has nothing whatsoever to say about the other twenty-one curlews he claims\
    \ to have seen that day, at least nothing that persuades us they were actually\
    \ curlews as opposed to, say, godwits or pratincoles or starlings. At no point\
    \ does he describe what he is looking at in the kind of detail we would like if\
    \ we were to be convinced that he knew what he was talking about.\nThis is the\
    \ level of piercing insight one is able to gain by applying Bl\xF6tzmannist analysis\
    \ techniques to a piece of text, although of course it is only piercing when the\
    \ text under scrutiny mentions birds. Absent birds, and you are left rudderless,\
    \ disorientated and whirling ever more rapidly into a maelstrom of mental chaos.\
    \ Or so I am told. By Bl\xF6tzmann himself. Shouting his head off. On the blower.\n\
