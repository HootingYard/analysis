  text: 'There I was, crumpled and decisive, standing between two trees on the edge
    of the Blister Lane Bypass. The trees were both yews, I think. I was looking for
    curlews. The first one I saw was made of plastic, it was a toy or perhaps a decorative
    figurine. It had been abandoned in the gutter. Then I saw a second curlew, swooping
    across the blue, blue sky. I did not know it then, but within hours there would
    be no blue to be seen, for dark and brooding thunderclouds would waft in from
    the east. A third curlew appeared in my mind''s eye. It was gigantic and ferocious
    and terrifying. I shuddered. I walked away from the yews, in the direction of
    Bodger''s Spinney, pulling my resplendent teal cardigan tight about my torso.
    There was a fourth curlew, an embroidered one, on my necktie. Why in the name
    of heaven was I wearing a necktie? All of a sudden this length of fabric wrapped
    around my neck felt like a hangman''s noose. I took it off, with violent jerks,
    and discarded it in a puddle, where it would remain until discovered later that
    day by a scavenging hobbledehoy from The Bashings, that gloomy cluster of huts
    which sane people shirk. Oh, as the tie dropped into the puddle I saw a fugitive
    reflection in the water of the embroidered curlew, so that made five. It was still
    only ten in the morning.

    By five past ten I had seen another dozen curlews, or it may have been a single
    curlew seen twelve times, I cannot be altogether certain. I was standing on Sawdust
    Bridge at the time, feeling hopeless and disgruntled and cantankerous. The tunic
    I was wearing beneath my cardigan, which I had stolen from an ingrate, was playing
    havoc with my [invented skin disease], and rashes were appearing. My doctor had
    prescribed a daily dose of some sort of bean mashed up into a bowl of milk of
    magnesia, and I had forgotten to take my dose that morning, so keen was I to see
    curlews.

    Later I took a mop and began to clean the floor of one of the corridors in an
    ugly building which shall remain nameless. I was indoors now, so unlikely to see
    any curlews. But lo!, little Maisie--a polka-dot-dressed orphan whose parents
    perished in the Tet Offensive--came rushing up to me clutching her stamp album
    and showed me her latest acquisitions, a set of twenty bird-related thematics
    issued by the Tantarabim Interim Authority. I could not help but note, as I shared
    my Brazil nuts with starving Maisie, that eight of the stamps depicted curlews.

    On my way home, as the evening closed in and dark thoughts of skulduggery frolicked
    in my throbbing skull, I saw a dead curlew on the canal towpath. Bird detectives
    had already thrown a cordon around it, so I was unable to take a closer look.

    That night, by candlelight, I took out my ledger and gave names to each of the
    twenty-six curlews I had seen. Alcibiades, Bim, Chumpot, Dromedary, Eidolon, Flaps,
    Gash, Heliogabalus, Inthod... That is how I started my list. Then I recalled that
    I had set out to see forty-four curlews. I gnashed my teeth in misery and dejection.
    And I recalled that I had forgotten to wring out the mop.

    You will recognise the above as an extract from Dobson''s pamphletto A Description
    Of And Reverie Upon Forty-Four Curlews (out of print). Note that I use the word
    "pamphletto" to distinguish this work from the general run of pamphlets spewed
    out by Dobson. Note, too, that at this time, and in this place, I am not going
    to explain the difference between the pamphlets and the pamphlettos. Let it gnaw
    away at your mental innards, if you will.

    Our purpose today is to subject the text to analysis. I have been asked innumerable
    times--well, numerable, in that I can count the times I have been asked, on the
    fingers of one maimed hand--whether Dobson is telling the truth, or making the
    whole thing up. No matter how rigorous our analysis, irrespective of the analytical
    techniques employed, I am afraid to say this is an unanswerable question. One
    would need to delve deep into the biography of the pamphleteer, deeper than anyone
    with working wits in their head has ever seen fit to delve, to pronounce the passage
    true or false. It may even be a combination of the two, partly fact and partly
    fiction. Or Dobson may have sincerely believed it to be true, when it was actually
    an hallucination, or a series of hallucinations, brought on by exhaustion or the
    jangles or entrancement by a tiny sinister gnome-like fellow dressed all in green.
    It is unlikely we will ever know.

    This is not to say that we cannot analyse the passage, using certain techniques
    developed by Blotzmann, to ascertain the more important question of whether Dobson
    would have known a curlew when he saw one. After all, he was a man of boundless
    ornithological ignorance, as is attested not only by his inamorata Marigold Chew
    and by several of his acquaintances, not all of them shady characters, but by
    the pamphleteer himself, in his own words, notably in the pamphlet My Boundless
    Ornithological Ignorance, Together With A Paean Of Praise To Googie Withers (out
    of print). And careful study of the present text reveals that, in spite of the
    promise in the title to describe forty-four curlews, Dobson barely has a word
    to say about their appearance. Let us tabulate, in an objective tabulating manner,
    what he does say.

    Curlew Number One : plastic

    Curlew Number Two : swooping

    Curlew Number Three : gigantic, ferocious and terrifying, but also imaginary

    Curlew Number Four : embroidered

    Curlew Number Five : Curlew Number Four reflected in a puddle

    It is with reluctance that I am going to abandon my exciting tabulation, or tabulature,
    so soon, but quite frankly Dobson has nothing whatsoever to say about the other
    twenty-one curlews he claims to have seen that day, at least nothing that persuades
    us they were actually curlews as opposed to, say, godwits or pratincoles or starlings.
    At no point does he describe what he is looking at in the kind of detail we would
    like if we were to be convinced that he knew what he was talking about.

    This is the level of piercing insight one is able to gain by applying Blotzmannist
    analysis techniques to a piece of text, although of course it is only piercing
    when the text under scrutiny mentions birds. Absent birds, and you are left rudderless,
    disorientated and whirling ever more rapidly into a maelstrom of mental chaos.
    Or so I am told. By Blotzmann himself. Shouting his head off. On the blower.

    NOTE : Many thanks to Vincent Byrne for "pamphletto". (And "booklettes", not yet
    deployed.)'
