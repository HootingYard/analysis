  text: 'We wish to insert, into the subject''s mental and emotional innards, the
    qualities of gumption and pluck. For this purpose we resort to specially prepared
    pickles.

    The first step is the preparation of the subject. A ravening hunger for pickles
    must be created and maintained. There are various methods, most of which involve
    prolonged starvation accompanied by the eventual provision of jars packed with
    pickles, and potable water. There are ethical questions to be dealt with, but
    these can be swept aside, in grand and foppish manner, by appealing to the greater
    good. Note that one must on all accounts avoid a situation where one is asked
    to define the greater good, or to say what it is greater than. If necessary, flee,
    scarper, or assume sudden cretinism.

    Once the subject has been imbued with a desperate pickle craving, the pickles
    can be supplied. As stated, these must be specially prepared pickles, ones which
    impart gumption and pluck. So, actually, the first step is not the starvation
    of the subject but the preparation of the pickles. You have to have the pickles
    ready, for that moment when the subject is hammering their fists upon the skirting
    board or dado rail of the locked rumpus room, screeching for succour. At this
    point you must be ready to skip into the room, beaming and jolly, and bearing
    jars of pickles and a pot of potable water. It helps, too, to have an electrified
    pole, akin to a cattle prod, with which to zap the subject should he or she attempt
    to shove you out of the way and scamper from the room in search of unpickled foodstuffs.
    Usually the subject will be sufficiently weakened to make such shoving and scampering
    unlikely, but some subjects are wilier and more cunning than others. Wiliness
    and cunning are the characteristics we wish to expunge and replace by gumption
    and pluck.

    What, then, must one do to the pickles? What indeed? It is not as if the ordinary
    common or garden pickle is somehow magically engumptioned or implucked, in and
    of itself. It is not. It is just a pickle. For our purposes, we must have recourse,
    as so often, to the wisdom of the ancients. More accurately, we must impart a
    modern twist to the wisdom of the ancients. The ancients, after all, did not have
    a ready supply of pickles in jars. They may have had certain items pickled in
    amphorae, yes, but that pickling process was probably undertaken for reasons other
    than the preparation of tasty and toothsome snacks. Bear in mind that we want
    the subject to shovel the pickles down their gob with unalloyed gusto, not to
    gag and become overwhelmed with nausea, as might happen if the pickles are of
    the kind favoured by the ancients. The ancients were uninterested in gumption
    and pluck, generally speaking, qualities which became valued later in history.

    You will be pleased to learn that you need not remove the pickles from their jars.
    Simply align the jars in a row upon your counter, then cover them with a tablecloth
    or blanket. Do ensure that the tablecloth or blanket is freshly boiled and laundered
    and bears no trace of grime or grease or filth or minuscule creepy crawly life
    form. Then make passing gestures with one''s outstretched arms over the entableclothed
    or enblanketted line of pickle jars, palms downward, while intoning the following
    incantation in a low, ghoulish murmur:

    "Spavin. Gecko. Distemper. Hod. Blackguard. O. O. O. Crusty. Bingle. Poop deck.
    Flan."

    Repeat hundreds of times until you see an eerie, almost invisible vapour--a piquant
    vapour--rising from the tablecloth or blanket. Then remove it, with one deft flick,
    revealing the pickle jars. They will look exactly the same as they did before
    you covered them, but if the wisdom of the ancients is to be trusted, they are
    now jars packed with pickles ready to be modified. It is a sobering thought that
    one could, if one were a malefactor, imbue the pickles with one or more of the
    seven deadly sins. Imagine the havoc one could unleash! But one does not, for
    one is working for the greater good, is one not?

    Injecting, with a syringe, essence of gumption and pluck into the pickle jars
    is a simple enough matter which need not detain us here. Seal the tiny holes made
    in the jar lids by the syringe with special wax. Leave for half an hour, then
    turn all the jars upside down one by one to ensure that the waxen seals hold fast.

    There is one further magick bit of flummery to enact before taking the jars to
    the subject imprisoned and starving in the rumpus room. Obtain an infant and gently
    tap each pickle jar against its fontanelle, while you imitate the song of the
    wheatear.

    When you have taken the jars and the potable water into the rumpus room, make
    a quick exit and lock the door again. If you press your ear against the door you
    should, if all goes well, hear the subject unscrewing the lids from the jars and
    gobbling down the pickles and glugging the potable water. In no circumstances
    should you unlock the door just yet. Go for a stroll in a scented garden for the
    blind, making at least three circuits of the path. When you return, fling open
    the rumpus room door and bid the subject to go forth, with gumption and pluck.

    There have been cases where the subject has failed to respond in the expected
    manner. If this happens, review very carefully your preparations at all stages
    of the process. We all make mistakes.'
