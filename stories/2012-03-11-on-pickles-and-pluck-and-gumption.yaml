  text: "We wish to insert, into the subject's mental and emotional innards, the qualities\
    \ of gumption and pluck. For this purpose we resort to specially prepared pickles.\n\
    The first step is the preparation of the subject. A ravening hunger for pickles\
    \ must be created and maintained. There are various methods, most of which involve\
    \ prolonged starvation accompanied by the eventual provision of jars packed with\
    \ pickles, and potable water. There are ethical questions to be dealt with, but\
    \ these can be swept aside, in grand and foppish manner, by appealing to the greater\
    \ good. Note that one must on all accounts avoid a situation where one is asked\
    \ to define the greater good, or to say what it is greater than. If necessary,\
    \ flee, scarper, or assume sudden cretinism.\nOnce the subject has been imbued\
    \ with a desperate pickle craving, the pickles can be supplied. As stated, these\
    \ must be specially prepared pickles, ones which impart gumption and pluck. So,\
    \ actually, the first step is not the starvation of the subject but the preparation\
    \ of the pickles. You have to have the pickles ready, for that moment when the\
    \ subject is hammering their fists upon the skirting board or dado rail of the\
    \ locked rumpus room, screeching for succour. At this point you must be ready\
    \ to skip into the room, beaming and jolly, and bearing jars of pickles and a\
    \ pot of potable water. It helps, too, to have an electrified pole, akin to a\
    \ cattle prod, with which to zap the subject should he or she attempt to shove\
    \ you out of the way and scamper from the room in search of unpickled foodstuffs.\
    \ Usually the subject will be sufficiently weakened to make such shoving and scampering\
    \ unlikely, but some subjects are wilier and more cunning than others. Wiliness\
    \ and cunning are the characteristics we wish to expunge and replace by gumption\
    \ and pluck.\nWhat, then, must one do to the pickles? What indeed? It is not as\
    \ if the ordinary common or garden pickle is somehow magically engumptioned or\
    \ implucked, in and of itself. It is not. It is just a pickle. For our purposes,\
    \ we must have recourse, as so often, to the wisdom of the ancients. More accurately,\
    \ we must impart a modern twist to the wisdom of the ancients. The ancients, after\
    \ all, did not have a ready supply of pickles in jars. They may have had certain\
    \ items pickled in amphorae, yes, but that pickling process was probably undertaken\
    \ for reasons other than the preparation of tasty and toothsome snacks. Bear in\
    \ mind that we want the subject to shovel the pickles down their gob with unalloyed\
    \ gusto, not to gag and become overwhelmed with nausea, as might happen if the\
    \ pickles are of the kind favoured by the ancients. The ancients were uninterested\
    \ in gumption and pluck, generally speaking, qualities which became valued later\
    \ in history.\nYou will be pleased to learn that you need not remove the pickles\
    \ from their jars. Simply align the jars in a row upon your counter, then cover\
    \ them with a tablecloth or blanket. Do ensure that the tablecloth or blanket\
    \ is freshly boiled and laundered and bears no trace of grime or grease or filth\
    \ or minuscule creepy crawly life form. Then make passing gestures with one's\
    \ outstretched arms over the entableclothed or enblanketted line of pickle jars,\
    \ palms downward, while intoning the following incantation in a low, ghoulish\
    \ murmur:\n\u201CSpavin. Gecko. Distemper. Hod. Blackguard. O. O. O. Crusty. Bingle.\
    \ Poop deck. Flan.\u201D\nRepeat hundreds of times until you see an eerie, almost\
    \ invisible vapour\u2014a piquant vapour\u2014rising from the tablecloth or blanket.\
    \ Then remove it, with one deft flick, revealing the pickle jars. They will look\
    \ exactly the same as they did before you covered them, but if the wisdom of the\
    \ ancients is to be trusted, they are now jars packed with pickles ready to be\
    \ modified. It is a sobering thought that one could, if one were a malefactor,\
    \ imbue the pickles with one or more of the seven deadly sins. Imagine the havoc\
    \ one could unleash! But one does not, for one is working for the greater good,\
    \ is one not?\nInjecting, with a syringe, essence of gumption and pluck into the\
    \ pickle jars is a simple enough matter which need not detain us here. Seal the\
    \ tiny holes made in the jar lids by the syringe with special wax. Leave for half\
    \ an hour, then turn all the jars upside down one by one to ensure that the waxen\
    \ seals hold fast.\nThere is one further magick bit of flummery to enact before\
    \ taking the jars to the subject imprisoned and starving in the rumpus room. Obtain\
    \ an infant and gently tap each pickle jar against its fontanelle, while you imitate\
    \ the song of the wheatear.\nWhen you have taken the jars and the potable water\
    \ into the rumpus room, make a quick exit and lock the door again. If you press\
    \ your ear against the door you should, if all goes well, hear the subject unscrewing\
    \ the lids from the jars and gobbling down the pickles and glugging the potable\
    \ water. In no circumstances should you unlock the door just yet. Go for a stroll\
    \ in a scented garden for the blind, making at least three circuits of the path.\
    \ When you return, fling open the rumpus room door and bid the subject to go forth,\
    \ with gumption and pluck.\nThere have been cases where the subject has failed\
    \ to respond in the expected manner. If this happens, review very carefully your\
    \ preparations at all stages of the process. We all make mistakes."
