  text: "In the bulging sack of letters I received in response to the piece On Pickles\
    \ And Pluck And Gumption, one particular missive struck me. \u201CA lesser man\
    \ would of course plunge the syringe directly into the flesh of the subject,\u201D\
    \ wrote a reader. There is some truth in this, though only a smidgen. Some would\
    \ argue that a smidgen of truth is better than no truth at all, and they may well\
    \ be right, but what my correspondent overlooks is that if one did plunge the\
    \ syringe filled with essence of gumption and pluck directly into the subject,\
    \ thus obviating any need for the pickles in the first place, what on earth would\
    \ one do with all those pickles, and indeed with the jars into which they are\
    \ crammed? The obvious rejoinder to this is \u201COffer them for sale, unmodified,\
    \ at the church bazaar or f\xEAte\u201D. This is a superficially attractive suggestion,\
    \ one that might be leapt upon by the credulous, the dimwitted, or the poor. Those\
    \ of us bounden to the glorious idea of pickles-with-a-purpose will disagree."
