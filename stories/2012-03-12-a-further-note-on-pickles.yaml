  text: In the bulging sack of letters I received in response to the piece On Pickles
    And Pluck And Gumption, one particular missive struck me. "A lesser man would
    of course plunge the syringe directly into the flesh of the subject," wrote a
    reader. There is some truth in this, though only a smidgen. Some would argue that
    a smidgen of truth is better than no truth at all, and they may well be right,
    but what my correspondent overlooks is that if one did plunge the syringe filled
    with essence of gumption and pluck directly into the subject, thus obviating any
    need for the pickles in the first place, what on earth would one do with all those
    pickles, and indeed with the jars into which they are crammed? The obvious rejoinder
    to this is "Offer them for sale, unmodified, at the church bazaar or fete". This
    is a superficially attractive suggestion, one that might be leapt upon by the
    credulous, the dimwitted, or the poor. Those of us bounden to the glorious idea
    of pickles-with-a-purpose will disagree.
