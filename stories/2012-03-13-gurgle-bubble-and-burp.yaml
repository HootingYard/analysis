  text: 'I like words. I like fat buttery words, such as ooze, turpitude, glutinous,
    toady. I like solemn, angular, creaky words, such as straitlaced, cantankerous,
    pecunious, valedictory. I like spurious, black-is-white words, such as mortician,
    liquidate, tonsorial, demi-monde. I like suave "V" words, such as Svengali, svelte,
    bravura, verve. I like crunchy, brittle, crackly words, such as splinter, grapple,
    jostle, crusty. I like sullen, crabbed, scowling words, such as skulk, glower,
    scabby, churl. I like Oh-Heavens, my-gracious, land''s-sake words, such as tricksy,
    tucker, genteel, horrid. I like elegant, flowery words, such as estivate, peregrinate,
    elysium, halcyon. I like wormy, squirmy, mealy words, such as crawl, blubber,
    squeal, drip. I like sniggly, chuckling words, such as cowlick, gurgle, bubble
    and burp.
