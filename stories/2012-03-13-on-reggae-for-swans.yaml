  text: 'Boffins recently conducted a study which showed that, of all aquatic birds,
    the swan was least responsive to reggae music. As so often happens in science,
    the findings were counter-intuitive. We would expect swans to be more susceptible
    to reggae than, say, coots or herons, but it is difficult to argue with the boffins.
    At no fewer than a dozen sites, including ponds, reservoirs, lakes, riversides,
    and meres, they set up scores of loudspeakers pounding out non-stop reggae music,
    from dawn till dusk, and in some cases from dusk till dawn too. Careful observation
    of the behaviour of all forms of bird life in the experimental zones, and analysis
    of electroencephalograms generated by sensors attached to the heads of selected
    birds, were combined with several other avian-reggae methodologies, and the results
    were clear. While some coots, herons, ducks, reed warblers and moorhens showed
    a marked response to roots stylee rhythms, every single monitored swan was utterly
    impervious, and went about its business, by turns gliding with matchless elegance
    through the water or savagely attacking things, as is the swanny way.

    In one phase of the experiment, the non-stop pounding from scores of loudspeakers
    of classic tracks from Peter Tosh, Misty In Roots, King Tubby and others was accompanied
    by the display, on hoardings erected next to the experimental ponds, reservoirs,
    lakes, riversides, and meres, of large portraits of Marcus Garvey, Haile Selassie,
    and Jah Rastafari, the latter two being more or less indistinguishable. Most of
    these portraits were daubed in red and gold and green and black, irrespective
    of the range of the colour spectrum visible to birds, which is a separate area
    of study and one which neither I nor the boffins have pursued. Herons proved to
    be the birds most drawn to Jah, in some cases seemingly almost hypnotised by the
    combination of sound and image, though buffleheads scored highly here too. Once
    again, swans showed no response whatsoever to the visual stimulus, gliding past
    the hoardings with matchless elegance or savagely attacking unrelated things in
    the vicinity, as is the swanny way.

    The study has sent shock waves through both the reggae and the aquatic bird communities,
    one upshot being a particularly vituperative war of words erupting in the correspondence
    columns of the leading academic journal devoted to both fields. It was in a long
    article in Aquatic Birds And Reggae Weekly that the boffins first announced their
    findings, with lots of diagrams and even a photograph or two of a boffin attaching
    a brain sensor to the head of a reed warbler. Now the letters pages have been
    expanded to fill over half of the magazine, as rival boffins contend with each
    other. Perhaps the most constructive reaction has been from Professor Lars Talc
    of the School Of Applied Swan Studies at the University of Qaasuitsup in Northwest
    Greenland. Working with a team of reggae experts and swan lovers, he has posited
    the idea of creating "reggae for swans", a specific sub-genre of the music designed
    to somehow bash into their birdy brains a deep and responsive enthusiasm for the
    music which they seem to shun.

    As part of the project, one group has been assembling as much documentation as
    possible on any pronouncements Jah Rastafari made, or is alleged to have made,
    on the subject of swans. Certain wicked persons in Babylon have been putting it
    about that the material thus far gathered is all forged, counterfeit, or otherwise
    false. Wicked or not, this charge is convincing in the case of a woollen knitted
    baggie beanie hat on to which has been embroidered the phrase "I And I  Swans".
    It is exceedingly unlikely that this hat actually belonged to Jah himself, as
    is claimed.

    Professor Talc has also suggested that the scores of loudspeakers pounding out
    non-stop reggae music erected next to the ponds, reservoirs, lakes, riversides,
    and meres in the experimental zone be made permanent. Indeed, he has gone as far
    as to say, from his quiet retreat in the Arctic wastes of Northwest Greenland,
    that wherever on earth swans are to be found, they should be subjected to constant
    reggae music blasting out of loudspeakers. This has not gone down well with fuddy-duddies
    who wish to preserve the peace and tranquility of many ponds, reservoirs, lakes,
    riversides, and meres. Nor does the idea find favour with wet blanket bird welfare
    types who accuse the Professor of swan cruelty. In response to the latter charge,
    he has issued a long-winded and in places incomprehensible press release, in which
    he states baldly that his eventual aim is to create what he calls "a modified
    swan", genetically programmed not only to enjoy reggae music but actually to require
    it in order to remain alive. No wonder Talc has been compared to a latter-day
    Frankenstein.

    There are no swans in Africa.'
