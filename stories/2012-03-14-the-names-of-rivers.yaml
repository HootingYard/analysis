  text: 'From today''s Grauniad. Well worth memorising (and adding to).

    England''s drought draws attention to the condition of England''s rivers. And
    England''s rivers--with those in Scotland and Wales--have ancient names, often
    conferred before the Roman legions came, and passed down almost unchanged to the
    present. Daily Mail spread on the misery that will last all summer featured the
    Bewl, the Chess and the Pang. But these are just the start. What about the Mease,
    the Tees, the Dee, the Cree, the Nar, the Ter and the Ver? Or the Box, the Yox
    and the Axe? Or the Neet, the Fleet and the Smite? Do not forget, either, the
    Ebble, the Piddle, the Polly, the Nadder or the Wandle. Or the Feshie, the Mashie
    and the Wissey. Then there are the Lugg, the Ugie, the Meggat, the Tud, the Lud
    and the Irt. Like these other rivers, the Wampool, the Snizort, the Skirfare,
    the Deveron, the Cocker and the Stinchar speak of a deep Britain, to which we
    are more connected than we realise. Or would be if it rained.'
