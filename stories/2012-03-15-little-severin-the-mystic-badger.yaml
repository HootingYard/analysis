  text: "Those very sensible people at Unit have released a new double CD entitled\
    \ \u201CCivil Disobedience\u201D, described by the fanzine Fracture as \u201C\
    the most relentlessly depressing pop album ever released\u201D. I am delighted\
    \ to tell you that it includes a three-minute instrumental entitled \u201CLittle\
    \ Severin, The Mystic Badger (For Frank Key)\u201D which you can listen to here:\n\
    \u266A \u266A \u266A Little Severin, The Mystic Badger \u266A \u266A \u266A\n\
    I would urge you to go straight to the Unit website and buy the album, but online\
    \ purchase does not appear to be possible. Perhaps a Unit-person will add a comment\
    \ telling readers how they can obtain this essential recording."
