  text: "Those very sensible people at Unit have released a new double CD entitled\
    \ \"Civil Disobedience\", described by the fanzine Fracture as \"the most relentlessly\
    \ depressing pop album ever released\". I am delighted to tell you that it includes\
    \ a three-minute instrumental entitled \"Little Severin, The Mystic Badger (For\
    \ Frank Key)\" which you can listen to here:\n   Little Severin, The Mystic Badger\
    \   \nI would urge you to go straight to the Unit website and buy the album, but\
    \ online purchase does not appear to be possible. Perhaps a Unit-person will add\
    \ a comment telling readers how they can obtain this essential recording."
