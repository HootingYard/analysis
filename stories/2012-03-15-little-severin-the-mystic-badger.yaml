  text: 'Those very sensible people at Unit have released a new double CD entitled
    "Civil Disobedience", described by the fanzine Fracture as "the most relentlessly
    depressing pop album ever released". I am delighted to tell you that it includes
    a three-minute instrumental entitled "Little Severin, The Mystic Badger (For Frank
    Key)" which you can listen to here:

    Little Severin, The Mystic Badger

    I would urge you to go straight to the Unit website and buy the album, but online
    purchase does not appear to be possible. Perhaps a Unit-person will add a comment
    telling readers how they can obtain this essential recording.'
