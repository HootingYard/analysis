    \ Investigation, but today I learned that the letters actually stand for the Farmland\
    \ Bird Index.\nNow I will be able to make sense of even the most convoluted plot\
    \ in an American crime drama. All those agents are in fact engaged in the counting\
    \ and classification of birds. The veil has been lifted from mine eyes!\n\nFBI\
