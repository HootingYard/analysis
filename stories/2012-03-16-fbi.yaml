  text: 'I always thought that ''FBI'' referred to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation,
    but today I learned that the letters actually stand for the Farmland Bird Index.

    Now I will be able to make sense of even the most convoluted plot in an American
    crime drama. All those agents are in fact engaged in the counting and classification
    of birds. The veil has been lifted from mine eyes!
