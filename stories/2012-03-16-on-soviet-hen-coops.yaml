  text: 'Soviet Hen Coops is the latest bestseller by blockbuster paperbackist Pebblehead,
    a sweeping and magisterial cross-cultural history of poultry under Communism.
    On the face of it, this seems an unlikely subject for a book which has been flying
    off the shelves of airport bookstalls and has, in the past week alone, earned
    Pebblehead more money in royalties than J K Rowling has had hot dinners. But then,
    in the hands of the potboilerist, the most unpromising material is handled with
    such mastery and aplomb that, in places, it reads like the most nerve-wrenching
    and nail-biting and heart attack-inducing of thrillers.

    So I am told, in any case, as I have not yet read it myself. A while ago, I set
    myself the task of reading the entire Pebblehead canon, to date, in chronological
    order, and I do not wish to cheat. Thus far I have reached the autumn of 1972
    (Swarthy Fiends In Dungeons Grim) and have a couple of hundred titles to get through
    before I catch up with the latest tome. Thus I have relied on a specially-empanelled
    panel of readers to report to me their responses to Soviet Hen Coops. In choosing
    the panel, I was careful to exclude those with expert knowledge either of Soviet
    Communism or of hens, for Pebblehead is nothing if not a populist, and it is the
    general reader, and indeed the barely literate halfwit, for whom the bulk of his
    output is intended.

    Initial reactions were overwhelmingly positive, with the panel giving the book
    an overall rating of "Fantastic!". Converted into numerals, this worked out as
    10 out of 10, though a couple of panel members were keen to go up to 11. As a
    sample of a detailed critique, I have plucked this from the pile of written reports:

    Having never read a Pebblehead book before, or indeed any books at all, I was
    absolutely riveted to my armchair. Knowing nothing of Russia and its satellite
    states in the years between 1917 and 1992, the whole Communism thing was new to
    me, as was the stuff about poultry, for I have never been near a hen coop in my
    life, suffering as I do from an allergy to bird feathers. At times it was like
    reading an adventure story, or as I imagine it might be to read an adventure story.
    I had to grip the arms of my armchair and cling on by my fingertips, because I
    got so excited I thought I might topple out of it and fall on the floor. And because  I
    was holding on so tight to the armchair I could not at the same time hold the
    book, so I had to have a sort of makeshift lectern erected in front of me, to
    rest the book upon, and I had to employ an unpaid intern from a nearby orphanage
    to turn the pages for me. And turn the pages they did, for this book is a real
    page turner! If I have one criticism, it is that Pebblehead does not tell us anything
    whatsoever about the state of hens and hen coops in the immediate pre-Soviet era,
    so we cannot place the state and circumstances and milieu of the Communist hen
    in any context.

    I should interrupt the critique here to let slip some inside knowledge. I have
    it on good authority that Pebblehead is currently hard at work, in his so-called
    chalet o'' prose, on a prequel tentatively entitled Tsarist Hen Coops. Clearly,
    he did not wish to duplicate his material.

    One chapter I found particularly thrilling was that which deals, in spellbinding
    detail, with the sudden and complete transformation of Cheka hen coops into OGPU
    hen coops on the sixth of February 1922. The footnote which lists other notable
    events to happen on the sixth of February, including, in 1958, the Munich Air
    Disaster, is the best footnote I have ever read. It is true I have only read half
    a dozen footnotes in toto, the ones in this book, but of those six this one is
    by far the best.

    Another passage which had me gulping for air and requiring urgent medical attention
    was the part about the creation of Potemkin hen coops designed to pull the wool
    over the eyes of useful poultry idiots, the hen equivalents of Sidney and Beatrice
    Webb. Reports went back to West European and American hens about the idyllic lives
    of their Soviet sisters, leading to unrest and kerfuffle in a number of farmyards.
    I would have liked to learn more about Soviet eggs, but

    I am going to interrupt here again, to point out that Pebblehead''s next scheduled
    blockbuster, when he has finished writing Tsarist Hen Coops, will almost certainly
    be a fat doorstopper entitled Eggs In The Soviet Union.

    Actually, I think we have had quite enough of that readers'' report. I think it
    is clear from her enthusiasm that yet again Pebblehead has pulled out all the
    stops and produced a rollicking rollercoaster of a narrative. I just wish I knew
    how he does it. Day in, day out, he sits there in his Alpine fastness, pipe clenched
    between his jaws, pounding the keys of that battered Fabiocapello typewriter,
    which long ago, in 1977, lost its J and K keys and as a result forced on him a
    complete rethink of his prose style.

    Please note that Soviet Hen Coops is entirely devoted to hen coops in the Soviet
    Union, and nowhere concerns itself with the card game Soviet Hen Coop. My spies
    tell me that Pebblehead will turn his attention to this exciting pastime once
    he has bashed out Tsarist Hen Coops and Eggs In The Soviet Union and one or two
    other books he has in the pipeline. It will certainly be a title to look forward
    to, not least because Pebblehead himself has been called the king of Soviet Hen
    Coop players, regularly winning tournaments and having his name engraved over
    and over and over again on several golden and pewter trophies which he keeps lined
    up on the mantelpiece in his chalet o'' prose, and dusts with a rag on the rare
    occasions he can tear himself away from his typewriter.'
