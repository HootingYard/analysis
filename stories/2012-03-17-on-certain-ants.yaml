  text: 'Today is Saint Patrick''s Day. Around the world, persons of Irish heritage--often
    extremely tenuous--will find in the feast day an excuse to get drunk and sing
    mawkish songs, and to generally engage in what they laughably call a craic. I
    am of Irish heritage myself, on my father''s side, but view the sentimental attachment
    to the Emerald Isle with contempt, so instead of glugging Guinness and tunelessly
    wailing "O Danny Boy" with tears coursing down my cheeks, I shall turn my attention
    to ants.

    For today we also celebrate the birthday of Horace St John Kelly Donisthorpe (1870-1951),
    one of the greatest of British ant experts. Independently wealthy, by dint of
    the family textile business in Leicestershire, Donisthorpe went to the University
    of Heidelberg to study medicine, but left before qualifying due to a "too sensitive
    nature". From the age of twenty, he devoted the rest of his life to the study
    of ants and beetles.


    Over the years, he hunted down ants in Aviemore, Chobham Common, Box Hill, Nethy
    Bridge, Parkhurst Forest, Rannoch, the New Forest, Matley Bog, Sandown, and Weybridge
    Heath, but his favourite stamping ground was Windsor Great Park, where he was
    granted special permission to collect as many ants as he liked, and where many
    of his discoveries were made. I ought not, perhaps, use the phrase "stamping ground",
    as that summons a picture of Donisthorpe stamping his big boots upon the ground,
    surely inadvisable in the circumstances. I have never collected an ant in the
    wild myself, but I assume one must tread lightly and oh so carefully.

    Donisthorpe was the author of over eight hundred books and papers, including British
    ants, their life history and classification (1915), Myrmica schencki Emery, an
    ant new to Britain (1915), Some notes on a paper by Dr. Leach on ants and gnats
    in 1825 (1918), A list of ants from Mesopotamia; with a description of a new species
    and a new variety (1918), Guests of British ants (1927), Descriptions of some
    new species of ants (1931), On the identity of some ants from Ceylon described
    by F. Walker (1932), On a small collection of ants made by Dr. F. W. Edwards in
    Argentina (1933), Rhopalomastix janeti, a species of ant new to science (1936),
    Five new species of ant, chiefly from New Guinea (1938), The genus Lioponera Mayr,
    with descriptions of two new species and an ergatandromorph (1939), Descriptions
    of several species of ants taken by Dr. O. W. Richards in British Guiana (1939),
    The ants of Norfolk Island (1941), Descriptions of new ants from various localities
    (1941), Description of a new species of Crematogaster Lund, subgenus Physocrema
    Forel, with a list of, and a key to, the known species of the subgenus (1941),
    Descriptions of a few ants from the Philippine Islands, and a male of Polyrhachis
    bihamata Drury from India (1942), A myrmecophilous woodlouse (1943), Myrmecological
    gleanings (1943), On a small collection of ants from West Africa, associated with
    Coccidae (1945), Ireneopone gibber, a new genus and species of myrmicine ant from
    Mauritius (1946), New species of ants from China and Mauritius (1947), Some new
    ants from New Guinea (1947), A second instalment of the Ross Collection of ants
    from New Guinea (1948), A third instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from
    New Guinea (1948), A fourth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New
    Guinea (1948), A fifth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea
    (1948), A sixth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea (1949),
    A seventh instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea (1949), An
    eighth instalment of the Ross Collection of ants from New Guinea (1950), Two new
    species of ants from Turkey (1950), and Two more new ants from Turkey (1950).
    Rare indeed was the ant which eluded Donisthorpe''s eagle eye.

    One thing that is clear from that (partial) list of his publications is Donisthorpe''s
    enthusiasm for new ants. This was to prove controversial, and he was considered
    to be "overeager" to identify new species of ants. Indeed, of the thirty new species
    he identified, twenty-four were subsequently deemed to be insufficiently distinct
    to be considered separate species or to be synonymous with previous valid species.
    An example of what we might call his pernickety attempts to identify wholly new
    types of ant is his description of Polyrhachis hosei, where Donisthorpe admits
    at the outset that "the general description of P.(M.) byyani would do equally
    well for this species". He then details a small number of very minor differences,
    such as "a larger and more robust insect", "pronotal spines longer", "the scale
    has a somewhat wider arch", and so on.

    Indefatigable ant collector that he was, Donisthorpe was fiercely protective of
    those he gathered up, and would never allow them to mix with ants collected by
    others. The following reminiscence, by R W Lloyd in a letter to the Entomologist''s
    Monthly Magazine in 1951, allows us a glimpse of the man, though unfortunately
    it concerns beetles rather than ants:

    Mr Donisthorpe was a very fine Coleopterist, but he had that curious ''kink''
    shared by one or two other people, that he would only put in his collection beetles
    he had taken with his own hands. Luckily for him he was a man of leisure and he
    was able to go about the country when he heard of any rare beetles being taken.
    It led, however, to some curious results, as on a celebrated occasion when a collector
    in the New Forest got a very rare beetle--Velleius I believe it was--and advised
    Mr Donisthorpe, who telegraphed him to put a tumbler over it on the ground and
    keep it there until he was able to go and collect it himself.

    When he was not collecting, cataloguing, peering at, and writing about ants. Horace
    Donisthorpe liked to throw lavish and rambunctious parties at his home in Kensington
    Mansions, and managed to dissipate much of his fortune in doing so. Just as I
    shall not be celebrating Saint Patrick''s Day in carouse and revelry, nor will
    I paint the town red in memory of Donisthorpe. But we should all remember him
    on this, his 142nd birthday. What better way to mark it than to let him have the
    last word, in the form of one of the many, many notes he contributed over the
    years to The Entomologist''s Record & Journal Of Variation?

    Homoptera devoured by a bird.

    At a recent meeting of the Entomological Society of London, my friend Mr. Eltringham
    gave an account of some attacks by birds on Lepidoptera, and he said that all
    such occurrences should be put on record. This no doubt holds good with other
    insects as well as Lepidoptera, hence the following note.

    On June 20th, 1927, at 6.30 a.m., I was looking out of my bedroom window into
    the garden when I noticed a starling, which settled on a lavender bush, all covered
    with "cuckoo-spits." It proceeded to deliberately pick out from the froth all
    the larval Frog-hoppers, and eat them. I should think this is not a very usual
    proceeding, as otherwise a flock of Starlings would clear a garden in a very short
    time, and none of the insects be left. The late Dr. Sharp did, I believe, say
    that the object of the froth was to attract a wasp, which preyed on the Frog-hoppers!
    This, however, is not the view usually held by scientists.

    Further reading and listening.

    Many of the ant-papers by Donisthorpe listed above can be read online, following
    the links at the Global Ant Project.

    Untold thousands of you may have been particularly eager to read this essay, under
    the misapprehension that it would be devoted to Certain Ants, the legendary quartet
    of improv racket makers of long ago. You will not be disappointed for long, because
    if you click here you can listen to a vintage recording.'
