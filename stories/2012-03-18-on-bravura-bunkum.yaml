  text: 'The speech, it was agreed, was bunkum, but it was bravura bunkum. Certainly,
    to judge by the prolonged clapping of hands at the finish, accompanied by faintly
    hysterical screeches, it had gone down a storm. I wrote in my diary at the time
    that it was my first, and possibly last, experience of bravura bunkum.

    ''Bunkum'' is also spelled ''buncombe''. You can take your pick. The Japanese
    have a word for it, but I do not know what it is. Perhaps they call it bunkum
    too. I could find out, if I were avid to know, but I am not. Why should I waste
    my precious hours on this tingling planet wondering what word they use to describe
    bunkum in faraway Japan? I have better things to do. I made a list of them, in
    my diary, years ago, and am gradually working my way through it. It is good to
    have a plan.

    Mother looked over my list, shortly after I had compiled it, and crossed out a
    number of items, savagely, with her pencil. She wore a blue brooch on her bosom
    and her hair was tangled and as dry as straw. She peered at my list through her
    lorgnette, lips pursed, emitting the odd snort, and now and then something would
    cause her grief and she would stab the pencil on the page and slash it back and
    forth across the words I had written. I cannot for the life of me remember why
    I let her read my diary in the first place, quite apart from then allowing her
    to obliterate certain of the plans I had made for my life. It was surely not filial
    devotion. She was a mad old bat with a fragile grasp on reality. In any case,
    I could have ignored her scratchings, rewritten my list in a separate notebook
    with the deleted items reinstated, but I did not. Nor did I ever ask Mother what
    prompted her disapproval, not that I would have been likely to understand her
    reply, for her babblings were for the most part incoherent. There were moments
    of lucidity, usually after she had eaten an egg, but at such times she used the
    opportunity to give commands to the servants.

    So many years have passed that I barely recall the items on my list which Mother
    scratched out, and so effective was the savagery of the scratchings that they
    are pretty much illegible. For whatever reason, I never did pursue those plans.
    One, that can still be read, was a desire to "Collect even more ants than Horace
    Donisthorpe". In retrospect, I am rather glad Mother crossed that one out. Donisthorpe
    devoted six decades to the collection of ants. Six decades! I am not that interested
    in ants, and I would hardly have had time to do anything else. I might never have
    fulfilled one of my other plans, which was to "Listen to a lot of bunkum".

    Now that one I did pursue, and I pursued it systematically and with great vigour.
    If I heard rumours abroad of the speaking of bunkum, I made sure I was on the
    spot when the time came for it to be spouted. I never made any notes, I had no
    desire to remember any of the bunkum after the speaker was done. I just wanted
    to listen. And listen I did, here and there, over the course of many years. It
    was not beyond my wit nor my means to go to Japan, to hear Japanese bunkum, or
    whatever they call bunkum in Japan, spoken, but I never did. I am sure Mother
    would not have stood in my way, had I brandished a ticket for an ocean voyage
    and a Japanese phrasebook, waved them in front of her, and announced that I was
    setting out at the break of dawn. Had she recently ingested an egg, she might
    have questioned me about the purpose of my trip and its likely duration, but she
    would not have stopped me going. I did not go because, I confess, I was frightened
    of Japan, of faraway Japan.

    No doubt it was an irrational fear. I was not, for example, in the least afraid
    of huge swathes of the globe, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
    I felt almost affectionate towards eastern Europe, and often had pleasant dreams
    of Africa. Not that I ever visited these parts, but I would happily have done
    so had I ever been granted a passport. Sadly, I was not allowed one, by dint of
    some past infraction committed by Mother in the ambassador''s official residence
    in a geopolitical hotspot. I never did find out exactly what she had done, or
    not done, and never asked, in a lucid post-egg moment, when I might have found
    out. I think there is part of me that did not wish to know.

    But I certainly never needed to go to Japan, or to anywhere else, to hear bunkum.
    There was a vast amount of it to be heard close to home, within the distance of
    a short bus ride. Perhaps there is as much bunkum elsewhere in the world, or it
    may be that there is something particular about my little bailiwick that attracts
    bunkumites--a word defined by the OED as "one who talks bunkum". Whatever the
    case, I heard more than enough bunkum over the years, without ever having encountered
    bravura bunkum.

    That was what made Thursday afternoon, in that marquee, on that lawn, in that
    park, so decisive in my life. Having heard bravura bunkum, I had to ask myself
    if I wished or needed to hear any other bunkum ever again. I asked myself because
    I could not ask Mother, who by this time was cold in her grave, in the cemetery
    adjoining the very same park, her grave set upon a little hillock, where stood
    a sycamore on the branches of which birds perched, ravens and crows. When Mother
    first lay there, before the worms got her, I would sometimes go to the hillock
    and ask questions of the birds. The birds always answered me, cawing, cawing,
    but I could never interpret the caws nor wring any sense from them. Eventually
    I ceased to make those visits, and learned to trust to my instincts.

    It was instinct that made me take from the sideboard drawer Mother''s pencil,
    and to cross out the item in my list of plans to "Listen to a lot of bunkum".
    I scratched through it savagely, as Mother might have done, but I was calm, eerily
    calm, as I did so. Now I need never hear any bunkum again. I can move on, at last,
    to the next item on my list of things to do during my lifetime. I closed the diary,
    returned Mother''s pencil to the sideboard drawer, and shuffled into the kitchen
    to boil an egg.'
