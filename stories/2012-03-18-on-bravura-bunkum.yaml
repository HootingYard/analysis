  text: "The speech, it was agreed, was bunkum, but it was bravura bunkum. Certainly,\
    \ to judge by the prolonged clapping of hands at the finish, accompanied by faintly\
    \ hysterical screeches, it had gone down a storm. I wrote in my diary at the time\
    \ that it was my first, and possibly last, experience of bravura bunkum.\n\u2018\
    Bunkum\u2019 is also spelled \u2018buncombe\u2019. You can take your pick. The\
    \ Japanese have a word for it, but I do not know what it is. Perhaps they call\
    \ it bunkum too. I could find out, if I were avid to know, but I am not. Why should\
    \ I waste my precious hours on this tingling planet wondering what word they use\
    \ to describe bunkum in faraway Japan? I have better things to do. I made a list\
    \ of them, in my diary, years ago, and am gradually working my way through it.\
    \ It is good to have a plan.\nMother looked over my list, shortly after I had\
    \ compiled it, and crossed out a number of items, savagely, with her pencil. She\
    \ wore a blue brooch on her bosom and her hair was tangled and as dry as straw.\
    \ She peered at my list through her lorgnette, lips pursed, emitting the odd snort,\
    \ and now and then something would cause her grief and she would stab the pencil\
    \ on the page and slash it back and forth across the words I had written. I cannot\
    \ for the life of me remember why I let her read my diary in the first place,\
    \ quite apart from then allowing her to obliterate certain of the plans I had\
    \ made for my life. It was surely not filial devotion. She was a mad old bat with\
    \ a fragile grasp on reality. In any case, I could have ignored her scratchings,\
    \ rewritten my list in a separate notebook with the deleted items reinstated,\
    \ but I did not. Nor did I ever ask Mother what prompted her disapproval, not\
    \ that I would have been likely to understand her reply, for her babblings were\
    \ for the most part incoherent. There were moments of lucidity, usually after\
    \ she had eaten an egg, but at such times she used the opportunity to give commands\
    \ to the servants.\nSo many years have passed that I barely recall the items on\
    \ my list which Mother scratched out, and so effective was the savagery of the\
    \ scratchings that they are pretty much illegible. For whatever reason, I never\
    \ did pursue those plans. One, that can still be read, was a desire to \u201C\
    Collect even more ants than Horace Donisthorpe\u201D. In retrospect, I am rather\
    \ glad Mother crossed that one out. Donisthorpe devoted six decades to the collection\
    \ of ants. Six decades! I am not that interested in ants, and I would hardly have\
    \ had time to do anything else. I might never have fulfilled one of my other plans,\
    \ which was to \u201CListen to a lot of bunkum\u201D.\nNow that one I did pursue,\
    \ and I pursued it systematically and with great vigour. If I heard rumours abroad\
    \ of the speaking of bunkum, I made sure I was on the spot when the time came\
    \ for it to be spouted. I never made any notes, I had no desire to remember any\
    \ of the bunkum after the speaker was done. I just wanted to listen. And listen\
    \ I did, here and there, over the course of many years. It was not beyond my wit\
    \ nor my means to go to Japan, to hear Japanese bunkum, or whatever they call\
    \ bunkum in Japan, spoken, but I never did. I am sure Mother would not have stood\
    \ in my way, had I brandished a ticket for an ocean voyage and a Japanese phrasebook,\
    \ waved them in front of her, and announced that I was setting out at the break\
    \ of dawn. Had she recently ingested an egg, she might have questioned me about\
    \ the purpose of my trip and its likely duration, but she would not have stopped\
    \ me going. I did not go because, I confess, I was frightened of Japan, of faraway\
    \ Japan.\nNo doubt it was an irrational fear. I was not, for example, in the least\
    \ afraid of huge swathes of the globe, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores\
    \ of Tripoli. I felt almost affectionate towards eastern Europe, and often had\
    \ pleasant dreams of Africa. Not that I ever visited these parts, but I would\
    \ happily have done so had I ever been granted a passport. Sadly, I was not allowed\
    \ one, by dint of some past infraction committed by Mother in the ambassador's\
    \ official residence in a geopolitical hotspot. I never did find out exactly what\
    \ she had done, or not done, and never asked, in a lucid post-egg moment, when\
    \ I might have found out. I think there is part of me that did not wish to know.\n\
    But I certainly never needed to go to Japan, or to anywhere else, to hear bunkum.\
    \ There was a vast amount of it to be heard close to home, within the distance\
    \ of a short bus ride. Perhaps there is as much bunkum elsewhere in the world,\
    \ or it may be that there is something particular about my little bailiwick that\
    \ attracts bunkumites\u2014a word defined by the OED as \u201Cone who talks bunkum\u201D\
    . Whatever the case, I heard more than enough bunkum over the years, without ever\
    \ having encountered bravura bunkum.\nThat was what made Thursday afternoon, in\
    \ that marquee, on that lawn, in that park, so decisive in my life. Having heard\
    \ bravura bunkum, I had to ask myself if I wished or needed to hear any other\
    \ bunkum ever again. I asked myself because I could not ask Mother, who by this\
    \ time was cold in her grave, in the cemetery adjoining the very same park, her\
    \ grave set upon a little hillock, where stood a sycamore on the branches of which\
    \ birds perched, ravens and crows. When Mother first lay there, before the worms\
    \ got her, I would sometimes go to the hillock and ask questions of the birds.\
    \ The birds always answered me, cawing, cawing, but I could never interpret the\
    \ caws nor wring any sense from them. Eventually I ceased to make those visits,\
    \ and learned to trust to my instincts.\nIt was instinct that made me take from\
    \ the sideboard drawer Mother's pencil, and to cross out the item in my list of\
    \ plans to \u201CListen to a lot of bunkum\u201D. I scratched through it savagely,\
    \ as Mother might have done, but I was calm, eerily calm, as I did so. Now I need\
    \ never hear any bunkum again. I can move on, at last, to the next item on my\
    \ list of things to do during my lifetime. I closed the diary, returned Mother's\
    \ pencil to the sideboard drawer, and shuffled into the kitchen to boil an egg."
