  text: 'On Commander John Ross''s 1818 voyage to search for the North-West Passage,

    To justify the expedition''s scientific aims the Admiralty and the Royal Society
    donated chronometers and compasses--the Isabella carried seven different models
    of each--plus a number of other instruments, among them Henry Kater''s Pendulum
    for measuring the ellipticity of the globe, Mr Plentty''s Cork Life Boat, Englefield''s
    Mountain Barometer and Companion, Burt''s Buoy and Knipper, Trengrouse''s Apparatus
    for Saving Lives, and Troughton''s Whirling Horizon. John Ross would later contribute
    to the array with a dredging device of his own invention which he whimsically
    christened ''the Deep Sea Clamm''.
