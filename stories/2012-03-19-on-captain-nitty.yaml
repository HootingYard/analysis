  text: 'It was said of Captain Nitty that he had the gift of the gab. We shall not
    pause here to define the gab, but instead press on, press on, for time is tight.
    Time is as tight as Captain Nitty''s tunic, a size too small, the collar of which
    constricts his throat, thwarting the gab. And without the gab this man is nothing.

    Why, then, does he not tear off his tunic and cast it to the winds, or at least
    loosen his collar, so that he might give vent to the gab? To answer that question,
    or questions, we need to know something of the regulations, and the esteem in
    which they were held, then, there. They were draconian and pitiless and unyielding.
    Yet a man would think no more of bending them than he would of tearing off his
    own head and tossing it into a stream.

    It is in midstream, of a rushing gurgling torrent, that we find Captain Nitty,
    on this nineteenth century day. He is in it up to his eyeballs, breathing through
    a leather and gutta-percha contraption strapped to his head, covering his mouth
    and nostrils, and with a tube, reinforced with the wire from pipe-cleaners, rising
    above the level of the torrent into the mephitic air. No gab from Captain Nitty,
    in the circumstances.

    But gab, or something like it, from the riverbank, where Captain Nitty is closely
    observed by howler monkeys disporting in the trees. Howl, then, rather than gab.
    The monkeys watch his slow progress as he toils along the river, against the current.
    Are their howls howls of encouragement or of mockery? Captain Nitty hears them
    not, for the same contraption that affords him the ability to breathe muffles
    his hearing, its thick woollen earflaps tugged tight against his head by means
    of a strap buckled under his chin, as tight as his tunic.

    It is, perhaps, a mercy he can hardly hear the howler monkeys. Each step is a
    struggle, and now and then he loses his footing and is submerged in the torrent.
    He manages to pull himself upright through pluck and vim. For balance, he has
    a stick. It is not a branch torn from a riverbank tree, but his regulation stick,
    thick, of tropical wood, with a golden knob. He holds it horizontally in front
    of him, just above the surface of the water, for at all costs he must not get
    it wet. Even when he loses his footing he takes care to hoist the stick higher,
    keeping it in the air though the top of his head is briefly below the waterline.

    Here in midstream there is no tree cover to block out the sun. Its burning brilliance
    batters down, reflected in the golden knob on the end of Captain Nitty''s stick,
    the golden knob itself as bright as a miniature sun. Captain Nitty must keep one
    eye closed in consequence, that he is not blinded by it. As he makes his painfully
    slow progress upriver, he now and then switches the position of the stick, so
    the golden knob is on his left or his right, to rest one eye and employ the other.
    It is difficult for him to judge distance with but one working eye. He thought
    he would reach the rapids at least two hours before he does so.

    River rapids! Bane of the unwary! But Captain Nitty is nothing if not wary. He
    has the gift of the gab and he has a nose for danger. He has been called reckless,
    and teased for his excessive gung ho. Just as promised, there is a small wood
    and canvas boat tied to the trunk of a tree at the river''s edge. Captain Nitty
    makes for it, and clambers in. Now at last he can remove the contraption from
    his head. His senses are assailed, by the howling of the howler monkeys, now deafeningly
    loud, and by the stink of rot and foulness and disease and death. He places his
    regulation gold knobbed tropical wood stick carefully in the bottom of the boat,
    and lifts the oars, sliding them through the tholes. One would think, watching
    him, that he has rowed a boat before, but he has not.

    But of course there is nobody watching him, nobody human, only the howler monkeys
    and the billions of tiny buzzing winged things with which the air is riddled.
    Captain Nitty pulls on the oars and heads inexorably for the rapids. Now he has
    his back to the shining golden knob on his stick, laid at his feet, and he can
    keep both eyes open. On the other side of the rapids, if he negotiates them without
    being tossed from his boat, he has been told to find a patch of land by the riverside
    and set up camp. He has, in his haversack, the makings of a tent, a stove, a flag,
    a pack of playing cards, and a Bible. And at nightfall, as the howler monkeys
    howl and nocturnal birds hoot and screech, and the raging torrent roars, Captain
    Nitty will cast off his tunic, and hang it up on a clothes line improvised between
    two trees, and while his sausages cook on the stove he will give vent to his gift
    of the gab. He will plant his flag and name his camp and name all the land around.
    He will sing rousing hymns. He will bless the Lord, O Captain Nitty''s soul: and
    all that is within him, bless his holy name, bless the Lord and forget not all
    his benefits, who forgiveth all Captain Nitty''s iniquities; who healeth all his
    diseases, who redeemeth his life from destruction, who crowneth Captain Nitty
    with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfieth his mouth with good things,
    so that his youth is renewed like the eagle''s. The Lord executeth righteousness
    and judgment for all that are oppressed. He made known his ways unto Moses, his
    acts unto the children of Israel. The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger,
    and plenteous in mercy. He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger
    for ever. He hath not dealt with Captain Nitty after his sins; nor rewarded him
    according to his iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great
    is his mercy toward them that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so
    far hath he removed Captain Nitty''s transgressions from him. Like as a father
    pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth Captain
    Nitty''s frame; he remembereth that he is dust. As for Captain Nitty, his days
    are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth
    over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the
    mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,
    and his righteousness unto children''s children; To such as keep his covenant,
    and to those that remember his commandments to do them. The Lord hath prepared
    his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. Bless the Lord, Captain
    Nitty and his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening
    unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers
    of his, that do his pleasure. Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his
    dominion: bless the Lord, O Captain Nitty.

    He has the gift of the gab, and sausages to eat, and an empire to build.'
