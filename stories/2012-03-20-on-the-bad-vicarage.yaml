  text: "It was late on a winter's evening when I turned on to the lane leading to\
    \ the Bad Vicarage. There was ice in the puddles and the thorn bushes glittered\
    \ in the moonlight. On the other side of a filbert hedge a peasant person was\
    \ worrying the ground with an agricultural tool.\n\u201CGood evening, peasant!\u201D\
    \ I called, \u201CCan you tell me who is vicar nowadays in the Bad Vicarage?\u201D\
    \nIt was twenty years since I had been in these parts. I doubted that the Bad\
    \ Vicar of the olden days was still in residence, but I wanted to make sure.\n\
    \u201CGood evening to you, sir,\u201D said the peasant, resting from his twilight\
    \ labours and leaning on his implement, \u201CThe vicarage is bad indeed, as bad\
    \ as any vicarage in Christendom. But the vicar whose sinecure it is is, shall\
    \ we say, a fair to middling vicar. I would not call him good, but he is by no\
    \ means as bad as the Bad Vicar of old.\u201D\n\u201CThank you,\u201D I said,\
    \ and felt compelled to add \u201CYou are, I may say, very well-spoken for a peasant.\u201D\
    \n\u201CI am a so-called New Peasant,\u201D said the peasant, \u201CMy soul has\
    \ been re-engineered by the Great Helmsman, all praise to him. It was he who ensured\
    \ the destruction of the Bad Vicar, after all.\u201D\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D\
    \ I asked, \u201CThen praise to him indeed, as you say. Yet for all that, the\
    \ Bad Vicarage is still bad, in spite of its fair to middling vicar, and though\
    \ you are a New Peasant, here you are at nightfall, tilling the fields or whatever\
    \ you are doing with that agricultural implement, just as an old peasant would\
    \ do.\u201D\n\u201CThe countryside is the countryside, sir,\u201D he said, gnomically,\
    \ and he went back to work.\nI carried on up the lane, my mind a welter of chaos.\
    \ If the Great Helmsman had wrought the ruination of the Bad Vicar, why had he\
    \ left the Bad Vicarage standing? And why, installed in it now, was a fair to\
    \ middling vicar? Were there no good vicars in these parts? My uncle, for example,\
    \ was a good vicar. Why had he been passed over for the sinecure? But then, was\
    \ he still alive, or had he been one of the many victims of the Bad Vicar, mourned\
    \ and unmourned? These and other questions tugged at the reins of my sanity as\
    \ I approached ever closer the great forbidding gate of the Bad Vicarage.\nAs\
    \ if to signal a shift in the very nature of things, just as I raised my hand\
    \ to grasp the bell-pull dangling from the gate, the bright moon was of a sudden\
    \ blotted out behind a cloud. I shuddered, but yanked the rope, only to hear a\
    \ dull flat clunk rather than a clang. A bad bell for a bad vicarage. What else\
    \ should I have expected?\nBut the clunk had the desired effect, for peering between\
    \ the railings I saw the door of the Bad Vicarage creak open, and emerging from\
    \ it a fellow I took to be the fair to middling vicar. He was young and spry and\
    \ came bounding up the path to open the gate for me.\n\u201CYou are the vicar?\u201D\
    \ I asked.\n\u201CThat I am,\u201D he cried, with unwarranted bonhomie, \u201C\
    Come, visiting stranger, for the night is a chill one, and you must warm your\
    \ collywobbles beside a roaring fire.\u201D\nAnd soon enough the two of us were\
    \ sat in armchairs by the fireside, slurping from beakers of hot and vitamin-enhanced\
    \ goaty milk froth. Clearly, in destroying the Bad Vicar, the Great Helmsman had\
    \ spared his goats. I could hear them, tethered in the back garden, bleating and\
    \ occasionally butting their heads against the wall.\n\u201CExplain to me,\u201D\
    \ I said, coming straight to the point, \u201CHow it can be that this vicarage\
    \ is still a Bad Vicarage, when you yourself, armed with the sinecure, are not\
    \ a Bad Vicar?\u201D\nThe fair to middling vicar laughed, slopping some of his\
    \ milk froth onto the threadbare rug at his feet.\n\u201CThis will always be a\
    \ Bad Vicarage,\u201D he said, \u201CThe rugs are threadbare, the floorboards\
    \ are rotting, the paint is chipping, the roof is falling in, the heating is clapped\
    \ out, the drains are clogged, and the goats are maddened.\u201D\n\u201CCould\
    \ you not see to it that repairs are made and the goats inspected by a veterinary\
    \ surgeon?\u201D I asked.\nHe laughed again, but this time it was a hollow laugh\
    \ of infinite despair.\n\u201CWhat would be the use?\u201D he said.\n\u201CWell,\u201D\
    \ I said, \u201CIf both the repair persons and the veterinary surgeons were unstinting\
    \ in their efforts, it would no longer be a Bad Vicarage. It would become fair\
    \ to middling, and in time, possibly, even good. Imagine that.\u201D\nHe put his\
    \ drained beaker on the rug, stood up, and went to stand by the window, peering\
    \ out, his back turned to me.\n\u201CYou have come here, \u201D he said, after\
    \ some minutes of eerie silence, \u201COn a cold winter's evening, uninvited,\
    \ unannounced. I sense you are no stranger to this place. I can hear in the bleating\
    \ of the goats that they know you, that they have encountered you before. Just\
    \ before you arrived, I received a message on my metal tapping machine from the\
    \ New Peasant stationed behind the filbert hedge at the entrance to the lane.\
    \ He told me you had no need to ask for directions, that you made your way here\
    \ with practised steps, indeed that you minced hither as directly as a crow in\
    \ flight. You nestle in the armchair by the fire and slurp the hot and vitamin-enhanced\
    \ goaty milk froth from the beaker I have given you, and you know damned well\
    \ that the rugs are threadbare, the floorboards are rotting, the paint is chipping,\
    \ the roof is falling in, the heating is clapped out, the drains are clogged,\
    \ and the goats are maddened. You know the Bad Vicarage as well as you know the\
    \ back of your hand. Who the devil are you?\u201D\nAnd he spun around to look\
    \ at me, and I looked back, my red eyes gazing at him like firebolts.\n\u201C\
    I am the Bad Vicar,\u201D I said, \u201CCome to regain my sinecure.\u201D\nAnd,\
    \ at my summons, the maddened goats, their tethers loosed, came crashing through\
    \ the window."
