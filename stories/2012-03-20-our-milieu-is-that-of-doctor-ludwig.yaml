  text: "Last night I dreamed that I was walking in Saint Chad's Park, past a music\
    \ rehearsal studio, within which I could hear a beat combo practising. The song\
    \ I overheard\u2014which, in dreamland, I understood to be a Sleater-Kinney cover\
    \ version\u2014consisted of a single line, repeated over and over again: \u201C\
    Our milieu is that of Doctor Ludwig\u201D. Very melodious."
