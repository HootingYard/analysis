  text: 'Last night I dreamed that I was walking in Saint Chad''s Park, past a music
    rehearsal studio, within which I could hear a beat combo practising. The song
    I overheard--which, in dreamland, I understood to be a Sleater-Kinney cover version--consisted
    of a single line, repeated over and over again: "Our milieu is that of Doctor
    Ludwig". Very melodious.'
