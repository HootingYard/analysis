  text: 'I awoke one morning from uneasy dreams to discover I had been transformed
    into a Beatle. Somehow, uncannily, I was Ringo Starr! So unnerving was this experience
    that I bashed myself repeatedly on the head with a pair of drumsticks I found
    at my bedside and knocked myself out, relapsing mercifully into unconsciousness.

    But again, I had uneasy dreams, and when I awoke I discovered I had been transformed,
    but not this time into a Beatle. Now I had become an entirely new Me. Outwardly--indeed,
    inwardly--I was exactly the same as I had been the previous day. Yet it was clear
    to me, as I leapt out of bed and plunged my head into a bucket of icy water and
    shuffled into my kitchenette for a breakfast of devilled hare and jugged kidneys
    and turned on the radio to listen to an early morning concert of argumentative
    German improvised racket, that something had changed, something decisive and irreversible.
    But what?

    I decided that the simplest way to work out what had happened to me would be to
    go about my usual routine, but to monitor myself. So I spent a profitable three
    or four hours faffing about with the inner workings of my wristwatch. When I was
    done, it would not only tell the time, but it would keep a continuous check on
    the state of my soul. If all my tweakings were correct, then at nightfall, when
    the day was done, my watch would spit out a printed report, with handy bullet
    points. I could pass this to a consultant for analysis.

    The difficulty would be to find a competent analyst. I did not require the services
    of a brain-quack, but of someone learned in such fields as ornithology, geology,
    origami, athletics, trellis work, and rustic wisdom. If necessary, I would have
    to consult separate experts and then correlate their findings. It was going to
    be an uphill struggle.

    Luckily, I am used to uphill struggles, for my chalet is at the foot of an important
    mountain and every day I have to clamber across scree and up treacherous snow-covered
    slopes to get to the newsagent''s. That is the first part of my routine. I buy
    a copy of The Daily Hatchet and a pint of warm untreated goaty milk sloppings,
    and then I climb ever further up the mountainside, panting, until I reach my other
    chalet. I have always thought it best to have two chalets, one in which to sleep
    and ablute and eat breakfast and another in which to while away the day staring
    out of the window at snow and sky and the various types of birds which flit and
    swoop in that sky. There are of course other elements to my daily routine, manifold
    and multiform, but they need not detain us here. Or do they? All of a sudden I
    am assailed by doubts, and I am only part of the way across the scree. My legs
    are like jelly. On impulse, I turn back, back to my morning chalet, and I unlatch
    the door and slam it shut behind me and collapse on the carpet, across which I
    can see a beetle scurry. An insect, that is, not Ringo.

    I lie on the floor wondering if the newsagent will be alarmed by my absence, and
    by his unsold copy of The Daily Hatchet. Will he call the helicopter police? Will
    they come in search of me, swooping across the sky, just like the birds? Unlike
    the birds, will they come scrambling down on rope ladders and kick in my windows
    and Taser me and haul me up into a chopper and ferry me across the mountains to
    their sinister compound? Will I be dragged to a cellar and tied to a chair and
    interrogated under Klieg lights? Will they mistake me for Ringo Starr? Will I
    be forced to sing Octopus''s Garden, or will they demand that I tell them tales
    of Thomas The Tank Engine? All these, and other panicky questions throb in my
    brainpans until I remember that I am not Ringo, I am neither a Beatle nor a beetle.
    But what have I become? I get up and I go to my cupboard and I take out a hammer
    and nails and planks and I barricade myself into the chalet.

    I have blotted out the daylight, so I deploy an array of blubber candles here
    and there, on sideboards and mantelpieces and tabletops and counters. When lit,
    I gaze at the flames, one by one, and I ponder how curious it is that this light
    is brought to me by what was once the innards of that mighty sea beast, the whale.
    Will my own innards, in some future state, shed light upon the world? Is that
    to be my destiny, in my transformed state? Hours pass, with no hint of police
    helicopters, and one by one the blubber candles sputter and gutter out, and I
    am left in darkness. Is this, then, my fate, to become some kind of nocturnal
    being, like an owl or a bat? There are worse fates.

    I rummage through the nooks of memory to try to recall what I have learned of
    the bat and the owl through years upon years of study. I remember little, save
    for sounds of squeak and hoot and that both bat and owl have the gift of flight.
    Can I, now, in my transformation, fly? I flap my arms, testing the air, and discover
    that, yes!, I can fly. I rise so fast that I crash into the chalet ceiling and
    bash my head and knock myself out.

    When I come to, from uneasy dreams, I find I have been transformed yet again,
    this time into my final glorious state. Look upon my works, ye puny, and despair!
    For I am become Yoko, and I shall prevail!'
