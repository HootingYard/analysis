  text: 'In the course of a blog postage recounting "A Day In The Life", Outa_Spaceman
    describes his experience of listening to yesterday''s edition of Hooting Yard
    On The Air on Resonance104.4FM, broadcast, as ever, live:

    Prep and light the fire, hang washing on clothes airer and get comfortable for
    Hooting Yard on the Air.

    Familiar strains of the Caucasian Lullaby fade into horrific coughing and spluttering,
    ''Oh God'' intones the despairing voice of Mr. Key, Caucasian Lullaby cuts back
    in and plays for a distressingly long time. I begin to worry that I might actually
    have heard Mr. Key''s last gasp. Caucasian Lullaby fades again and Mr. Key resumes
    the entertainment that I know and love as Hooting Yard on the Air.

    Write email to congratulate Mr. Key on best start (in hindsight) to Hooting Yard
    on the Air ever.

    I did indeed manage to time a fit of strangulated choking perfectly to coincide
    with the start of the programme. At 6.30 PM, I was fine and chipper. Ten or fifteen
    seconds later I was racked by heaving convulsive coughs and, as I signalled wildly
    for John, the sound engineer, to bring the music back up, I was unable to breathe.
    I then staggered out of the studio to the kitchen to get a beaker of water, where
    I heard, from the office above, the voice of Resonance supremo Ed Baxter calling
    "Terrific beginning to the show, Frank!"

    I gulped down water and gradually regained my composure. Such are the joys of
    live radio.'
