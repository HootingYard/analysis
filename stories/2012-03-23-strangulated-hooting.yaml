  text: "In the course of a blog postage recounting \u201CA Day In The Life\u201D\
    , Outa_Spaceman describes his experience of listening to yesterday's edition of\
    \ Hooting Yard On The Air on Resonance104.4FM, broadcast, as ever, live:\nPrep\
    \ and light the fire, hang washing on clothes airer and get comfortable for Hooting\
    \ Yard on the Air.\nFamiliar strains of the Caucasian Lullaby fade into horrific\
    \ coughing and spluttering, \u2018Oh God\u2019 intones the despairing voice of\
    \ Mr. Key, Caucasian Lullaby cuts back in and plays for a distressingly long time.\
    \ I begin to worry that I might actually have heard Mr. Key's last gasp. Caucasian\
    \ Lullaby fades again and Mr. Key resumes the entertainment that I know and love\
    \ as Hooting Yard on the Air.\nWrite email to congratulate Mr. Key on best start\
    \ (in hindsight) to Hooting Yard on the Air ever.\nI did indeed manage to time\
    \ a fit of strangulated choking perfectly to coincide with the start of the programme.\
    \ At 6.30 PM, I was fine and chipper. Ten or fifteen seconds later I was racked\
    \ by heaving convulsive coughs and, as I signalled wildly for John, the sound\
    \ engineer, to bring the music back up, I was unable to breathe. I then staggered\
    \ out of the studio to the kitchen to get a beaker of water, where I heard, from\
    \ the office above, the voice of Resonance supremo Ed Baxter calling \u201CTerrific\
    \ beginning to the show, Frank!\u201D\nI gulped down water and gradually regained\
    \ my composure. Such are the joys of live radio."
