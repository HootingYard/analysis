  text: '"To begin from the top: I have five sabre cuts on the crown of the head and
    three on the left temple, all fractures from which much bone has come away; one
    on my left cheek which fractured the jaw bone and has divided the ear, forming
    a very unsightly wound; one over the right temple and a dreadful gash on the back
    of the neck, which slightly grazed the windpipe; a musket ball in the hip, which
    made its way through my back, slightly grazing the backbone; five sabre cuts on
    my right arm and hand, three of the fingers broken, the hand cut three-fourths
    across, and the wrist bones cut through; three cuts on the left arm, the bone
    of which has been broken but is again uniting; one slight wound on the right leg
    and two with one dreadful gash on the left, to say nothing of a cut across the
    fingers of my left hand, now healed up."

    Almost as an afterthought he added that on arrival at Sidi el Muktar he had caught
    the plague--"a dreadful malady somewhat similar to yellow fever in its symptoms"--and
    had spent nine days "so ill with fever that it was presumed, expected and hoped
    that I should die". While he was sick most of his possessions, including his gun,
    had been stolen and sent to be sold in the Timbuctoo market. "I am nevertheless
    doing well," he concluded, writing with only the thumb and middle finger of his
    left hand, "and hope yet to return to England with much important geographical
    information."

    ... "My father used often to accuse me of a want of common sense," he once confided
    to his sister, "''Tis true, I never possessed any, nor ever shall."
