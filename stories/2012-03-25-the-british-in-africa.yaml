  text: "\u201CTo begin from the top: I have five sabre cuts on the crown of the head\
    \ and three on the left temple, all fractures from which much bone has come away;\
    \ one on my left cheek which fractured the jaw bone and has divided the ear, forming\
    \ a very unsightly wound; one over the right temple and a dreadful gash on the\
    \ back of the neck, which slightly grazed the windpipe; a musket ball in the hip,\
    \ which made its way through my back, slightly grazing the backbone; five sabre\
    \ cuts on my right arm and hand, three of the fingers broken, the hand cut three-fourths\
    \ across, and the wrist bones cut through; three cuts on the left arm, the bone\
    \ of which has been broken but is again uniting; one slight wound on the right\
    \ leg and two with one dreadful gash on the left, to say nothing of a cut across\
    \ the fingers of my left hand, now healed up.\u201D\nAlmost as an afterthought\
    \ he added that on arrival at Sidi el Muktar he had caught the plague\u2014\u201C\
    a dreadful malady somewhat similar to yellow fever in its symptoms\u201D\u2014\
    and had spent nine days \u201Cso ill with fever that it was presumed, expected\
    \ and hoped that I should die\u201D. While he was sick most of his possessions,\
    \ including his gun, had been stolen and sent to be sold in the Timbuctoo market.\
    \ \u201CI am nevertheless doing well,\u201D he concluded, writing with only the\
    \ thumb and middle finger of his left hand, \u201Cand hope yet to return to England\
    \ with much important geographical information.\u201D\n\u2026 \u201CMy father\
    \ used often to accuse me of a want of common sense,\u201D he once confided to\
    \ his sister, \u201C\u2018Tis true, I never possessed any, nor ever shall.\u201D\
