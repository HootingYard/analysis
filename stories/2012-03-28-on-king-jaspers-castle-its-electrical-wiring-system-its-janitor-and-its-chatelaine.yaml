  text: "If I knew the first thing about the ballet, I would tell you all about Crepingeour's\
    \ ground-breaking work King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring System, Its\
    \ Janitor, And Its Chatelaine. It was literally a ground-breaking ballet, in that\
    \ some of the steps choreographed involved tremendously heavy thumping, in big\
    \ boots, upon caked mud. But alas and alack, I completely lack ballet chops. So\
    \ instead I will turn my attention to King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring\
    \ System, Its Janitor, And Its Chatelaine, the play by Pickles on which the ballet\
    \ is based. My source is Basing Ballets On Pickles Plays\_: A Study Of Crepingeour\
    \ And His Followers In The Crepingeourist School by Biff Blunkett, the noted balletomane\
    \ and Crepingeourist. I had best press on before I get bogged down in further\
    \ folderol.\nThe plot of King Jasper's Castle, Etcetera is so convoluted that\
    \ I am not going to attempt to summarise it here. What you need to know is that\
    \ the setting is a castle, belonging to King Jasper, situated on a bleak promontory\
    \ overlooking a bleaker sea. The castle's electrical wiring system is as complicated\
    \ as the plot of the play, if not more so. Its maintenance and seemingly endless\
    \ tweaking and repair is the responsibility of the janitor, who is employed by\
    \ the castle's chatelaine. Neither the janitor nor the chatelaine has a given\
    \ name, though whether this is an oversight on Pickles\u2019 part, or an oh so\
    \ clever literary device, is moot. Arguments have been thrashed out on both sides.\
    \ There are other Pickles plays with nameless characters, some where characters\
    \ swap their names around between acts, and several where, though every character\
    \ has a name, those names are unpronounceable in any human tongue, or indeed in\
    \ bestial grunts, howls, or birdsong. Not for nothing is Pickles labelled a \u201C\
    difficult\u201D playwright, just as he was called a \u201Cdifficult\u201D child\
    \ by those paid to watch over him in his infancy.\nBut King Jasper's Castle, Etcetera\
    \ is not, in itself, a difficult play, for either actors or audience. Indeed it\
    \ is often the case that the cast, whether professional or amateur, will dispense\
    \ with rehearsals entirely, and simply jump on to a stage impromptu and start\
    \ performing it. The only people who are disconcerted by this are the scene-shifters,\
    \ who become all a-dither. Still, from what I have read, that is only to be expected\
    \ of scene-shifters. See for example Biff Blunkett's magisterial study Dithering\
    \ Scene-Shifters In Theatrical Performances Of Pickles Plays. That said, Pickles\
    \ has to bear some responsibility for the dithering, for his plays have become\
    \ notorious among scene-shifters for their rapid and bewildering shifts of scene.\
    \ In King Jasper's Castle, Etcetera, for example, Act One alone requires twenty-two\
    \ different sets in its seven separate scenes, as can be tabulated by a competent\
    \ tabulator with an eagle on the script, as follows:\nScene One\_: The pantry\
    \ in King Jasper's castle\u2014a greyhound racing stadium\u2014hotel lobby\u2014\
    the castle drawbridge.\nScene Two\_: Electrical wiring cupboard in the castle\u2014\
    plague pit\u2014castle balcony.\nScene Three\_: Hell.\nScene Four\_: Bates Motel\u2014\
    interior of giant Jiffy bag\u2014apple orchard\u2014pear orchard\u2014jetty.\n\
    Scene Five\_: The castle larder\u2014the castle oubliette\u2014the O.K. Corral\u2014\
    persimmon orchard\u2014 chatelaine's boudoir.\nScene Six\_: Uncle Tom's cabin\u2014\
    King Jasper's cabin\u2014janitor's cubby.\nScene Seven\_: The Great Hall of King\
    \ Jasper's castle\nThose of you who have not seen the play might infer from this\
    \ competently tabulated tabulation that it must be hard to follow the action,\
    \ what with so many changes of scene, even, as we can see, within the same scene,\
    \ to the point where one calls into question quite what Pickles meant by the word\
    \ \u201Cscene\u201D in the first place. But that would be to underestimate the\
    \ sheer genius of Pickles\u2019 stagecraft. Also, if you have not actually seen\
    \ the play in performance you would have no appreciation of its exceedingly slow\
    \ pace. Think snails, and lame snails at that. Snails on crutches. Snails on crutches\
    \ battling against a gale force wind. Uphill. At a steep gradient. Think even\
    \ steeper.\nWhy, then, does a critic as acute as Biff Blunkett insist, more than\
    \ once, that the play \u201Cfairly rattles along\u201D? Is he obtuse rather than\
    \ acute? Is he a fool? Has he been watching a completely different play all this\
    \ time? That is a possibility. It is not only scene-shifters who get all a-dither\
    \ in the face of Pickles\u2019 dramaturgy, but the printers of playbills and publicity\
    \ posters too. Blunkett himself has written a magnificent and coruscating study\
    \ of this very issue in his A Magnificent And Coruscating Study Of The Issue Of\
    \ Dithering Playbill And Publicity Poster Printers Of Pickles Plays. If you only\
    \ read one of Biff Blunkett's verbose and prolix spoutings, this is the one worthy\
    \ of your attention. The chapter in which he sounds a warning regarding the tendency\
    \ to confuse King Jasper's Castle, Its Electrical Wiring System, Its Janitor,\
    \ And Its Chatelaine with Pickles\u2019 companion piece King Jasper's Castle,\
    \ Its Gas Mantles, Its Chatelaine, And Its Janitor is particularly magnificent,\
    \ though not quite as coruscating as it might be, all things considered. Among\
    \ the things considered should be the fact that Blunkett was bedridden with double\
    \ pneumonia and a collapsed lung when he wrote it.\nRumours are afoot that a young\
    \ hothead Crepingeourist is at work on a ballet based on King Jasper's Castle,\
    \ Its Gas Mantles, Its Chatelaine, And Its Janitor. If so, that will be something\
    \ to see, at least for balletomanes. The rest of us can spend a profitable evening\
    \ queuing up at a soup kitchen."
