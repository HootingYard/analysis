  text: 'So lost, so hopelessly lost is he in the peasouper of history, that very
    few people today realise King Jasper, of the Pickles play King Jasper''s Castle,
    Its Electrical Wiring System, Its Janitor, And Its Chatelaine, and of its later
    adaptation as a ballet by Crepingeour, was a real person of the past. Whether
    he was a real king is moot, as we shall see. But there is no doubt at all that
    King Jasper existed. His bones rest in a box in my allotment shed.

    I came by the bones through a secret network of kings'' bones collectors. It is
    not so secret now I have told you about it. We do our collecting underground,
    in the shadows, under cover of night, far from places where common folk tramp.
    It is highly unlikely you have ever seen us at work, collecting bones of kings
    and trading them among ourselves. A couple of ribs from King X might be swapped
    for a femur from King Y.

    More often than you might imagine, the bones of a king will be scattered hither
    and yon. If his throne was usurped by a wicked nephew, for example, a toppled
    king when killed might be chopped to bits, and those bits buried in pits at spots
    dispersed across the kingdom. The wicked nephew will arrange this, and pay off
    the gravediggers accordingly, in fear of vengeance from beyond the realm of death.
    He will have been brought up on tales of grisly and ghostly avengers, heard at
    his governess''s knee. He will believe that only by scattering far and wide the
    king''s bones can he avert an awful fate.

    Even when a king dies, at peace, in his bed, or accidentally, after a surfeit
    of lampreys, his bones may still be scattered. Buried with all due pomp, of a
    piece, in one place, the dead king''s corpse will feed the worms and rot, and
    when all that remains is a heap of bones it can happen that the grave will be
    opened, at dead of night, by ignorant peasants. Immured in rustic poverty, the
    peasants will not have been brought up by governesses, but they will have heard
    the weird tales of the village Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, and believe in the talismanic
    properties of kingly bones. So, fighting and squabbling over the opened royal
    grave, each peasant will snatch a bone or two and carry them away, to be hung
    on a nail on the wall of their hovel as a lucky charm. And later, when their villages
    are laid waste by marauding barons or barbarians or both, the bones, along with
    all the other pitiful belongings of the peasants, will be scattered and strewn
    across the burning ruination of the land.

    I would not claim that we kings'' bones collectors act from some mystical belief
    that by uniting the scattered bones of a particular king we are somehow calling
    him back from the dead. Perhaps one or two of my fellow collectors entertain such
    delusions. The rest of us are simply collectors, as we might be of stamps or coins
    or foopball programmes. Nor do we all necessarily seek to gather all the bones
    to complete a king. Some go just for shins, or skulls, or phalanges. But from
    the moment I joined the secret network, I was intent on collecting each and every
    bone of King Jasper I could lay my hands on. Why?

    Why?, indeed. As I said, it is not even clear that King Jasper was a genuine king.
    Doubts were first raised shortly after his death, before even worms and rot had
    reduced him to naught but bones. His head, it was said, was not a kingly head.
    It was large and lopsided and had the pallor of curd. His gait was not a kingly
    gait, for he moved in an ungainly lollop. His crown was unbejewelled, and, on
    close examination, made from pewter and tin. He sat uneasy on the throne, a furtive
    look in his milky half-blind eyes, as if he had no right there to sit. Questions
    were raised and bruited abroad. If King Jasper were truly a king, why was the
    lady of the castle a mere chatelaine, and not a queen? And was it true, as some
    said, that the castle janitor had a large and lopsided head with the pallor of
    curd, that his gait was an ungainly lollop, and that instead of wearing a janitorial
    tatty cap, atop his bonce he sported an odd pointy hat made of pewter and tin?

    I knew of all these doubts and questions. I was, after all, the author of a fat
    and breathtaking biography of King Jasper, albeit unpublished and, according to
    certain sour-faced kingly chroniclers, unpublishable. I keep the manuscript in
    the same box in which I keep the bones, in my allotment shed. The pages I scribbled
    upon over untold years are suffused with the charnel pong of the king. Lately
    it has occurred to me that I might use them to make a papier mache model of King
    Jasper, moulded around his reassembled bones. But first I have to complete my
    collection. There is a knuckle to be tracked down and exhumed, buried in some
    faraway field, dropped a century ago by a baron or a barbarian from a bag of looted
    peasant gewgaws. I must listen to the gossip on the grapevine of the secret network,
    alert for hints and clues. Then one night I shall set out with my spade.

    King or janitor, it makes no difference to me. I have already made his throne,
    from the cobblings of a dozen discarded chairs. It is covered with a shroud in
    the corner of my shed. And when the missing knuckle is at last dug up, and all
    the bones put together and encased in my mashed up manuscript moulded into kingly
    shape, I will have a mannequin to plop on to the throne. I will haul it out of
    the shed and on to my cart, and trundle it along the country lanes for mile after
    mile, reconstructing the legendary journey made by King Jasper as he traversed
    his kingdom. It is said that he stopped off at many villages along the way to
    do a spot of repair work or mopping, just like a janitor. But he never lost sight,
    half-blind as he was, of his eventual destination, the electrified castle perched
    on a bleak promontory overlooking a bleaker sea, wherein awaited the chatelaine
    who had stolen his heart.

    Heart, spleen, liver and lights... all are long rotted away. But I have his bones.
    All but one.'
