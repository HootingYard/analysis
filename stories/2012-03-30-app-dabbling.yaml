    This week in The Dabbler I present a round-up of exciting new apps for those of
    you who carry about hand-held computerised devices. I eschew such newfangled gewgaws
    myself, but that is no reason to miss the opportunity to make my fortune. If millions,
    or indeed billions of fatheads buy one of my apps, I shall not be complaining.

    One app I forgot to mention in the piece is the iPadde, named after Knud Padde,
    a minor character in the Danish television crime drama Forbrydelsen. This handy
    app does instant translations into Danish of common phrases such as "computer
    password fuckup" and "girl power wet tee-shirt competition".'
