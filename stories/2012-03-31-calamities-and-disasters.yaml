  text: 'I noticed that on BBC1 yesterday there was the first in a short series of
    programmes called Titanic With Len Goodman--Mr Goodman being one of the judges
    from Strictly Come Dancing. It is a curious combination of presenter and subject,
    and I wonder if we can look forward to Hindenburg With Alesha Dixon, The Munich
    Air Disaster With Bruno Tonioni, The Tay Bridge Disaster With Craig Revel-Horwood,
    The Lisbon Earthquake With Arlene Phillips, and, perhaps, The Black Death With
    Tess Daly.
