text: "I noticed that on BBC1 yesterday there was the first in a short series of programmes\
  \ called Titanic With Len Goodman\u2014Mr Goodman being one of the judges from Strictly\
  \ Come Dancing. It is a curious combination of presenter and subject, and I wonder\
  \ if we can look forward to Hindenburg With Alesha Dixon, The Munich Air Disaster\
  \ With Bruno Tonioni, The Tay Bridge Disaster With Craig Revel-Horwood, The Lisbon\
  \ Earthquake With Arlene Phillips, and, perhaps, The Black Death With Tess Daly.\n"
