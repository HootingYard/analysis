  text: "The pamphleteer Dobson had an id\xE9e fixe that anyone born on the first\
    \ of April needs must be a fool, and an incorrigible and irredeemable fool at\
    \ that. (It is pertinent to note that Dobson took great pains never to divulge\
    \ his own date of birth and seems to have destroyed all records of it.) Challenged\
    \ to provide evidence for his theory, Dobson embarked on the writing of a pamphlet.\
    \ Putatively entitled A Compendium Of Foolishness, its subtitle gives a succinct\
    \ summary of what we could have read had he ever written it: A Bumper Collection\
    \ Of Anecdotes Regarding Acts Of Foolishness Committed By Fools Born On All Fools\
    \ Day. As far as we know, he got no further than scribbling the title with his\
    \ propelling pencil on a sheet of notepaper, at which point he sat gazing out\
    \ of the window for hours, trying to think of appropriate tales of foolishness.\
    \ Rummaging around in that capacious pamphleteering brain, he drew a blank.\n\
    Dobson was reluctant to abandon the project so soon, but felt unequal to conducting\
    \ any research. He had only recently recovered from an attack of the spraingue,\
    \ had one arm in a sling, was temporarily blind in one eye, and spent the best\
    \ part of his waking hours with his feet submerged in a bowl of jelly water. Such\
    \ was my pitiable condition, he wrote, That the very thought of conducting fool\
    \ research risked a recurrence of the spraingue. I was at my wits\u2019 end, and\
    \ could only gaze out of the window for hours on end in hopeless despair, munching\
    \ cake.\nOne wet Thursday morning during this period, Dobson was disturbed by\
    \ a hammering at his door. He removed his feet from the bowl, slipped on a pair\
    \ of Argentinian Public Baths Attendants\u2019 pantoufles, and went to admit his\
    \ visitor. It turned out to be the radio broadcaster Gilbert Viperhead, the very\
    \ man who had demanded, on air, that Dobson prove his theory about fools. He was\
    \ brandishing a horsewhip.\n\u201CYou, sir, are a scoundrel and a cad!\u201D cried\
    \ the radio host, \u201CAnd unless you provide me with conclusive proof that those\
    \ of us born on All Fools Day are fools, I shall give you a damned good thrashing\
    \ with this horsewhip I am brandishing!\u201D\n\u201CAs you can see,\u201D replied\
    \ Dobson, \u201CI am a sick man. Allow me time to recover from my recent attack\
    \ of the spraingue and I shall furnish you with so much evidence it will be pouring\
    \ out of your ears.\u201D\nIn spite of his florid face and the demeanour of an\
    \ enraged retired colonel, Viperhead was a reasonable man. He unbrandished the\
    \ horsewhip and accepted the cup of tea Dobson offered him. They spent an hour\
    \ in almost pleasant conversation, discoursing on topics such as the spraingue,\
    \ radio broadcasts, fools, jelly water, and horsewhips.\nBut when he had gone,\
    \ Dobson realised his dilemma. Sooner or later, he was going to have to justify\
    \ his fool theory, or remain in permanent convalescence. And then he had what\
    \ was to prove a fateful idea. He scurried back to his escritoire, took off the\
    \ pantoufles, plunged his feet back into the bowl, took his propelling pencil\
    \ and some notepaper, and started scribbling away.\nDear Cicely Courtneidge, he\
    \ wrote, You were born on the first of April and are therefore a fool. Please\
    \ reply by return of post with two or three anecdotes of incidents or episodes\
    \ in your life which demonstrate your utter foolishness. Yours sincerely, Dobson.\n\
    He stuffed this missive into an envelope, scribbled Cicely Courtneidge's name\
    \ and last known address on it, sealed it, and affixed a stamp. He then wrote\
    \ identical letters to Emperor Go-Saga of Japan, William Harvey, John Wilmot,\
    \ Otto von Bismarck, Ferruccio Busoni, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Edgar Wallace, Lon\
    \ Chaney Senior, Wallace Beery, Whittaker Chambers, Lor Tok, Toshiro Mifune, Milan\
    \ Kundera, Debbie Reynolds, Ali McGraw, Samuel R Delany, Annie Nightingale, Ronnie\
    \ Lane, David Gower, Susan Boyle, Philip Schofield, and Dennis Kruppke. He would\
    \ not need to track down anecdotes of foolery\u2014the anecdotes would come to\
    \ him! Dobson was not so foolish as to think that some of his correspondents were\
    \ still alive, but he hoped that, by cleverly pre-dating some of his letters,\
    \ their heirs might feel duty bound to reply. What he did not take into account\
    \ was the fact that some of the living recipients might take exception to being\
    \ called a fool by an obscure and penurious scribbler.\nSo it was that, on a wet\
    \ Wednesday morning shortly after shoving all these letters into the postbox at\
    \ the end of the lane, Dobson was disturbed by a hammering at his door. He removed\
    \ his feet from the bowl of jelly water, slipped on a pair of Peruvian bordello\
    \ keeper's pantoufles, and went to admit his visitor. It turned out to to be Jack\
    \ Hulbert, star of stage and screen and husband of Cicely Courtneidge. He was\
    \ brandishing a horsewhip.\n\u201CYou, sir, are a scoundrel and a cad!\u201D he\
    \ cried, \u201CHow dare you insult my dear wife by calling her a fool? I am going\
    \ to give you a damned good thrashing with this horsewhip I am brandishing!\u201D\
    \n\u201CAs you can see,\u201D said Dobson, but before he could get another word\
    \ out Jack Hulbert began thrashing him with the horsewhip. The pamphleteer learned\
    \ that day that not all outraged gents are as amenable to reason and cups of tea\
    \ as Gilbert Viperhead. It was not the only visit he received that week that left\
    \ him battered and bruised and bewailing his own foolishness.\nHe never did write\
    \ the pamphlet."
