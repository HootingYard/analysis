  text: 'I was on the brink, but there was muffling, so it was not quite clear to
    me what I was on the brink of. Muffles have that effect, they make things uncertain
    and imprecise, it is in their nature. Much of the time muffles are not unwelcome.
    It is a small mercy to be muffled against the sundry horrors with which the world
    is rife. I am tempted to list them, but I will forego the opportunity, partly
    because my horrors are unlikely to coincide with your horrors. We will have differing
    lists. That which I am ecstatic, yes, ecstatic, to be muffled against may be a
    source of thrill and pang for others, and vice versa.

    Not that we should confuse a brink necessarily with a horror. Some brinks border
    horror, but others do not. That is why it was so unhelpful, in the circumstances,
    to be muffled. I did not know what I was on the brink of, so I did not know whether
    to shrink from it, or to embrace it with open arms. Those are two common responses
    to being on the brink. Making a quick about turn or striving desperately forwards
    are two others. In all cases it is obviously a bloody good idea to know the nature
    of the brink before deciding what to do.

    But how to make an informed decision when there is muffling? Therein lies the
    beauty of brinkmanship. This is a much misunderstood term. What it means, in essence,
    is to follow the tenets of Brinkman. Like his near-namesakes Superman and Spiderman,
    Brinkman is a superhero. His adventures have been recorded in comic books, television
    serials, and motion pictures, most recently the blockbuster Brinkman 7 : Back
    From The Brink! which, I am afraid to say, is somewhat less exciting than that
    exclamation mark may lead you to believe. It certainly lacks the punch and sheer
    emotional engagement of my bemufflement on an unidentified brink. As I said in
    my review of the film,

    Brinkman 7 : Back From The Brink! is somewhat less exciting than that exclamation
    mark may lead you to believe. It certainly lacks the punch and sheer emotional
    engagement one might experience if one were on an actual brink, especially with
    attendant muffles.

    The six earlier Brinkman films were not only full of thrills and spills, but contained
    lots of scenes where Brinkman was given the opportunity to expound his tenets
    of brinkmanship. I saw all of the films, several times, and I took notes, because
    I wanted to be prepared, when on a brink, to know just what to do.

    It is in Brinkman 4 : The Brink''s-MAT Robbery that Brinkman comes closest to
    dealing with muffles. This is the film where Brinkman is called in to help solve
    the so-called "crime of the century", when robbers stole twenty-six million pounds''
    worth of gold, diamonds, and cash in a raid on the Brink''s-MAT warehouse at Heathrow
    Airport on 26 November 1983. In this fictionalised version, the befuddled coppers
    think the name of the warehouse is a reference to some sort of mat or rug which
    Brinkman uses to bridge the gap over a brink and what lies beyond the brink, and
    make an urgent call on the Brinkphone. Even though Brinkman has no idea what they
    are talking about--he does not own such a mat or rug--he is a superhero, so he
    changes into his costume of red and green and yellow jumpsuit with an orange winged
    helmet and visor, both of which have a startling and garish letter B emblazoned
    upon them, and he leaps into the Brinkmobile and heads across town to police headquarters.
    On his way there, he drives into an area of mufflement. Though he is not actually
    on any kind of brink at the time, it is instructive to watch as he copes. To a
    soundtrack of pounding music, recorded I think by a group of hairy persons practised
    in the art of the power ballad, Brinkman revs the engine of the Brinkmobile and
    utters one of his exclamatory catchphrases--"Crikey!" or "Crumbs!" as I recall--and
    simply roars through the muffles with recklessness, aplomb, and pluck. I had to
    put down the pad in which I was making notes to clap my hands in spontaneous applause.

    I recalled that lesson when I stood on the brink, muffled. There were two problems.
    First, as I said, Brinkman was not on a brink when he found himself enmuffled.
    It would be too charitable to say that, on the contrary, he was on the brink of
    solving the Brink''s-MAT Robbery, because he wasn''t. He hadn''t even arrived
    at the police station. Second, he was aboard the Brinkmobile, whereas I was on
    foot. I didn''t have a Brinkmobile, or an ordinary car, or even a bicycle. There
    was just me, in my Uggs, on a muffled brink.

    I reflected for a long time. Then I shouted "Crikey!" or "Crumbs!", and I jumped.

    NOTE : In spite of the wealth of evidence to be found in the comic books and television
    serials and motion pictures, there is a persistent misapprehension that Brinkman''s
    Brinkmobile is not a souped-up jalopy but a ship. This clearly stems from the
    widespread misunderstanding of the word "brinkmanship". While it is true that
    in Brinkman 5 : Ahoy There Brinkman!, Shiver-Me-Timbers! Brinkman spends most
    of the film aboard a ship, getting into all sorts of flaps with pirates and ghosts
    of pirates, it is clearly not his own ship. In fact, there are several scenes
    where it is made explicit that it is one of L Ron Hubbard''s Sea Org ships, though
    for legal reasons the specific name of the ship was obscured by filmic muffle.'
