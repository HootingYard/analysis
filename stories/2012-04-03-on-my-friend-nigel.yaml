  text: 'For the best part of twenty years, I worked in an office. I don''t know if
    local government has changed since the turn of the century, but in my time it
    seemed to be a haven for the most bewildering collection of oddballs. There was,
    of course, the expected bevy of middle-class leftie revolutionaries who treated
    working-class people with loathing and contempt and spent their entire time "building
    the struggle" rather than doing any of the actual work they were paid--often handsomely--to
    do. The "struggle" was always taking place in far flung countries of which they
    knew nothing, Nicaragua or Grenada for example, though it necessitated calling
    for strike action every few weeks. At least they had not yet developed a weird
    fixation with Israel and the Palestinians, which I suspect consumes most of them
    nowadays.

    But there were other, far more outre, nutters, slumped over desks or leaping out
    from behind filing cabinets or patrolling the streets of the borough. There was
    a young hothead admin assistant who held the unshakeable conviction that Joseph
    Heller had written a novel entitled Catch-69 and looked with pitying condescension
    on those who tried to correct him. There was an Iranian quantity surveyor, the
    spit and image of Christopher Lee, in the garb of a dapper undertaker, who I swear
    did not cast a shadow. There was a paper pusher, obsessed with Viennese psychoanalysts,
    much given to explaining that he had "done everything", sexually, without ever
    going into any detail of what "everything" might consist, and who was constantly
    on the verge of tears. There was the thespian refuse collector, who worked as
    a dustman between acting jobs, who had not had an acting job for twenty years,
    yet retained the mien and deportment and voice of Albert Finney in The Dresser.
    There was the evangelical Christian architect who would be found kneeling in prayer
    in the middle of the lobby, so visitors had to skirt around him on their way to
    the reception desk. There was the bluestocking temp who smoked a pipe, and there
    was the frazzled touch typist who handed in a forty-page report without noticing
    that it was forty pages of gibberish, having begun her typing session with her
    fingertips one key to the left of where they ought to have been, and who threatened
    to take out a formal grievance if she was asked to retype it, shouting her head
    off with such vituperation that no one dared to give her any more work for a week,
    so she sat happily manicuring her nails and reading magazines. And there was Nigel.

    Back in the early 1980s, before fully fledged IT departments cut their chops,
    the embrace of "new technology" was done on an ad hoc basis. The department for
    which I worked decided to take on "someone who knew about computers", as a permanent
    full-time employee, with a brief to act as a self-motivated technowhizz person.
    Nigel, who had a splendid interview technique, got the job, despite knowing next
    to nothing about computers, and caring even less. All he was really interested
    in was Hegel, the subject of the Ph.D. upon which he had embarked.

    Some three months passed before Nigel''s manager noticed that there was no appreciable
    sign of progress towards his excitable vision of a computerised future. He assumed
    that Nigel, sitting at his (computerless) desk, deep in thought, making very--very--occasional
    notes of a few words on a scrap of paper, was summoning from his powerful brain
    ideas relevant to that future. Nigel was thinking about Hegel, waiting to be given
    a specific task to perform. The manager decided to hold a meeting, to make it
    clear in no uncertain terms that he wanted Nigel to buck his ideas up and zip
    about the office identifying exciting computer possibilities. Before the meeting
    could take place, however, there was one of those addled and ill-thought out reorganisations
    that occurred with bewildering frequency. The manager vanished, was not replaced,
    and Nigel was left to cogitate about Hegel undisturbed.

    He remained undisturbed for some years. Every now and then he would be slotted
    in to a new departmental structure, without his new boss having the time or inclination
    to work out what he actually did. He took to coming in to work very early, sitting
    and thinking, making those very occasional brief notes, and leaving straight after
    lunch. All this time, those of us who were his friends knew that the masterwork,
    the thesis on Hegel, was being written, though he did the writing at home, not
    in the office. And lo!, it came to pass that it was finished. Nigel asked a work
    colleague, who had a degree in political science, to type it up for him. One day,
    she came over to my desk to see me, with a worried look on her face.

    "This thesis of Nigel''s is incomprehensible," she said, "For one thing, it''s
    the only Ph.D. thesis I''ve ever seen that hasn''t got a single reference or footnote,
    or a bibliography. Secondly, I''ve read a good deal of philosophy and political
    science, and I have a horrible feeling this is gibberish."

    It was a view to be shared by Nigel''s doctoral supervisor, who was equally befuddled.
    Nigel, who had spent years on what he considered the definitive work on Hegel,
    and who had a fine temper when roused, dismissed his supervisor as an idiot. "He
    isn''t fit to lick my boots!" he shouted at me, one evening in the pub. Eventually
    they agreed that the thesis be shown to a mutually admired Hegelian, a man whose
    opinion Nigel respected. If he pronounced it twaddle, Nigel would accept the verdict.

    Meanwhile, he had inherited some money from a distant relative he had never met,
    and bought a house. Shortly after moving in, he decided it needed refurbishment,
    including, puzzlingly, shifting one of the doors slightly to one side. (I never
    saw the house, so have no idea whether there was any sense in this, but I suspect
    not.) To carry out the work, Nigel employed some blokes he met one night in his
    local pub. They spent the next few weeks fleecing him. Seemingly every day, they
    demanded more cash for materials which were suddenly essential, while rarely doing
    any work on the house.

    With a bunch of scallywags exploiting him, no doubt until every last penny of
    his inheritance was spent, and the impending thunderbolt of having his thesis
    dismissed as mumbo jumbo, perhaps it was a mercy Nigel didn''t live to see his
    financial and intellectual ruin. His lodger returned from a weekend away to find
    him dead in his bed. He had suffered a massive heart attack. He was forty-four
    years old.'
