  text: 'Dobson was no stranger to controversy, but rarely did he create so tumultuous
    a brouhaha as was caused by his pamphlet Hints And Tips For Intrepid Explorers
    In The Polar Wastes (out of print). Dobson himself had of course never been anywhere
    near either the Arctic or the Antarctic, and one of the many puzzles he left behind
    for the unwary biographer is the question of why he ever thought he was qualified
    to address the subject. He was only too ready to admit to his ignorance of certain
    matters, made plain in pamphlets such as My Blithering Ignorance Of Vast Swathes
    Of Ornithology and When It Comes To Ice Hockey, I Have No Idea What I Am Talking
    About, both of which are tragically out of print.

    Yet he felt able to compile a list of hints and tips for polar exploration, and
    ensured that Marigold Chew ran off more copies on the Gestetner machine in the
    potting shed than she did of almost any other pamphlet he ever wrote. Indeed,
    a number of their breakfasts were ruined during a period in the 1950s when the
    pamphleteer insisted that his inamorata gobble down her kedgeree in double quick
    time so she could hurry off to the shed to crank out another dozen copies. Oddly,
    he does seem to have actually had some success in selling them, though this may
    have been due to the breathtakingly gorgeous mezzotint of a polar bear, by the
    noted mezzotintist Rex Tint, which was used on the cover. There was a sort of
    polar bear fad at the time, occasioned by the popular radio serial The Adventures
    Of Martin The Polar Bear, starring Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert. The historian
    and cultural commentator Bevis Sebag has suggested, compellingly, that most of
    the people who bought Dobson''s pamphlet tore off the cover, placed the mezzotint
    in a frame and hung it on the wall of their parlour, and chucked the pamphlet
    itself into the bin.

    But some people obviously did read it, otherwise there would not have been a tumultuous
    brouhaha. And a tumultuous brouhaha there was, with knobs on! Several very foolish
    explorers went off to the Arctic or the Antarctic clutching copies of Dobson''s
    pamphlet, to the exclusion of any other written guidance whatsoever. It is fair
    to say that their lives were in his hands. Because his "hints and tips" were almost
    entirely spurious, idiotic, irrelevant, wrong-headed, fantastical, and outright
    dangerous, not one of these several fools ever returned alive from the polar wastes.
    Hence the tumultuous brouhaha, when their grieving relicts and orphans blamed
    the pamphleteer and tried to have him prosecuted in a court of law.

    There were a few weeks during which Dobson had to face noisy marches and demonstrations,
    a temporary encampment of earnest young persons in tents outside his house, and
    some unkind newspaper headlines, including OUT OF PRINT PAMPHLETEER SENT EXPLORERS
    TO CERTAIN DEATH, BEREAVED TOT SHAMES PAMPHLETEER WITH HEART-RENDING MESSAGE SCRIBBLED
    WITH CRAYONS ON PLACARD, and ANTARCTIC WIDOWS'' ICE CUBE PROTEST SCUPPERED BY
    UNEXPECTEDLY BALMY WEATHER SPELL. (Note for younger readers : newspapers in those
    days were printed on much bigger sheets of paper, and had more words than pictures.)
    But eventually all the fuss died down, as it usually does. The marches and demonstrations
    were broken up by charging police horses, the futility of their tentage gradually
    dawned on the young persons, and the newspapers moved on to other stories, such
    as VICE PRESIDENT NIXON ATTACKED BY ANGRY MOB IN VENEZUELA and LISTENERS REACT
    WITH FURY AS ''THE ADVENTURES OF MARTIN THE POLAR BEAR'' IS CANCELLED BY OUT OF
    TOUCH RADIO BOSSES--COURTNEIDGE ''LIVID'' SAY PALS.

    Throughout the tumultuous brouhaha, Dobson himself remained silent. Partly, or
    indeed wholly, this may have been because his position was indefensible. This
    was a pamphleteer, remember, whose sole advice, on the subject of unimaginably
    harsh gale-swept subzero temperatures in the frozen hell of the polar wastes was
    "Best pack a woolly".

    In a new monograph, the reputed Dobson scholar and polar explorer Loopy Pangloss
    has been through the pamphlet with a fine toothed comb. In her foreword, she admits
    that it is inconceivable to her that such a titanic figure as Dobson could have
    written a pamphlet entirely devoid of sense. Her task, she says, is to winnow
    from it something, anything, that could in some way restore the pamphleteer''s
    reputation among the polar exploration community. Triumphantly, she alights upon
    Tip Number 12, reproduced here in full:

    You might, in the unimaginably harsh gale-swept subzero temperatures in the frozen
    hell of the polar wastes, become peckish. If so, wrap up warm and plod out into
    the ice and snow until you see a polar bear. These are big fierce creatures, but
    using skill, judgement, and weaponry, you should be able to kill one. That done,
    drag the slaughtered polar bear back to your nice warm hut. Using an axe, chop
    it to pieces, each piece being no bigger than a baby''s clenched fist. Sort the
    chunks out by type, i.e., fur, bone, sinew, fat, flesh, innards, what have you.
    Select the chunks that look toothsome, and place them in a large pot. Fill the
    pot with water, and bring to the boil. Place a lid on the pot and let it simmer
    for hours. Top up the water from time to time. While it is cooking, feed the unselected
    less toothsome chunks of polar bear, raw, to the huskies. Anything they leave
    can be put into a blender and liquidised. Heat this in a pan until it is the consistency
    of mayonnaise. Transfer the decisively-boiled polar bear chunks from the pot to
    a plate, pour over the liquid from the pan as a sauce, and tuck in.

    Important note : however toothsome it appears, on no account should you eat the
    polar bear''s liver. It is highly toxic, containing a terrifyingly high concentration
    of retinol, the form of vitamin A found in members of the animal kingdom. If eaten
    in one meal, 30 to 90 grams of polar bear liver is enough to kill a human being,
    or to make even sled dogs very ill. Believe you me, you will not want to come
    down with a case of acute hypervitaminosis A. The symptoms include drowsiness,
    sluggishness, irritability, severe headache, bone pain, blurred vision, vomiting,
    peeling skin, flaking around the mouth, full-body skin loss, liver damage, haemorrhage,
    coma and death.

    As Ms Pangloss points out, this is true. "For all its faults," she concludes,
    "Dobson''s Hints And Tips For Intrepid Explorers In The Polar Wastes (out of print)
    is not wholly worthless. We should give him credit for that."

    So we do.
