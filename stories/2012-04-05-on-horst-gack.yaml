  text: 'Next month, or the month after, or possibly the month after that, at any
    rate before the year''s end, fingers crossed, there will be a rare chance to see
    the early films of the fanatical Teutonic auteur Horst Gack. The Pointy Town Film
    Festival is devoting a fortnight to little-seen but legendary works including
    Lolloping Around A Pond, Prancing Around A Lake, and Mincing Around A Reservoir.
    With their bright, gaudy colour photography, lurching camera movements, and deafening
    soundtracks of oompah band power ballad cover versions, these are the films that
    put Horst Gack on the map. At the time, he was alone on that map, a tiny, isolated
    speck in a vast wilderness, much of which remained blank. It still does, save
    for a few tentative scratches and blots where previously there was an awful void.

    The critic Gilbert Dot contends that "Horst Gack brought to the filmic circumnavigation
    of inland bodies of water a brutal, even murderous, intensity never before seen
    in the cinema, or indeed in the real world". Certainly there is something hallucinatory
    about these films, which feature some of the great stars of the time dressed in
    costumes designed by some of the great costume designers of the time. The director''s
    use of state of the art night-vision technology, developed by the military, in
    bright and battering sunlight, with vaseline smeared on the camera lens, only
    adds to the unprecedented visual feast.

    The Pointy Town season also allows us to track the development of Horst Gack''s
    aesthetic, with the first ever screening of the previously presumed lost Gadding
    Towards A Bog. Here, he casts aside the motif of circumnavigation and has his
    star approach the inland body of water--but, importantly, it is an adulterated
    body of water, a vile bog, O vile! vile!, the vilest bog his location scouts were
    able to find. We, the audience, are only granted a glimpse of it, after much gadding,
    in the final nanoseconds of the film. It is a revelation, of a peculiarly Gackesque
    kind.

    Gilbert Dot, when asked to define the term Gackesque, burst into tears. Pressed
    for an answer, his sobbing and weeping became more convulsive, his breathing grew
    laboured, he shook, he broke out in a cold sweat, he gnashed his false teeth,
    he rent his garments, he palpitated, there was the appearance of a ball in his
    throat, he gave signs of suffocating, his legs gave way, and he collapsed onto
    the street, from where he was scooped up by a passing film buff who cradled him
    in her arms as he lapsed into a coma. I was reminded, tintum tantum, of Bellini''s
    Pieta (1472).


    I was reminded, too, of Horst Gack''s theoretical essay The Collapsed Film Critic,
    a cri de coeur which galvanised a small and indeed negligible band of artists,
    poets, film makers, and chancers when it appeared in the journal Intemperate Ravings
    By Horst Gack. Early in his career, the director had carved out a niche for himself
    from which he could not be dislodged. Was it a blessing or a curse, that niche,
    that resistance to dislodgement?

    The Pointy Town season will give us an opportunity to judge, if we so wish. But
    there are many cineastes who will stay away, in a huff. For them, Horst Gack can
    never be forgiven for the volte face he performed with the release of his middle
    period extravaganza Can Hieronymus Merkin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe And Find True
    Happiness? Redux, a shot-for-shot remake of Anthony Newley''s 1969 musical starring
    Anthony Newley, Connie Kreski, Joan Collins, Milton Berle, George Jessel, Patricia
    Hayes, Stubby Kaye, Victor Spinetti and Bruce Forsyth. So close is it to the original
    that, when the films were shown back to back, only one critic out of twenty was
    able to say which was which. Gilbert Dot was that critic, and I would dearly like
    to ask him how he perceived what nineteen others could not, but he remains comatose
    and cradled in the street. Apparently, he is contractually bound to remain in
    situ, along with his cradler, until such time as Horst Gack has flown in and set
    up his cameras and filmed the unconscious critic in extremis. Industry gossip
    has it that the director has embarked on a series of film adaptations of his early
    critical essays. Some will denounce this as self-referential navel-gazing of the
    worst kind, but they are unlikely to say so to Horst Gack''s face.

    That face! It was the subject of his next feature after the Newley remake, a four-and-a-half-hour
    musical entitled Horst Gack''s Face : A Hootenanny. Much of the music was recycled
    from Hieronymus Merkin, adapted for frantic and deranged Appalachian barn dance
    arrangements. The camera lingers on Horst Gack''s face, filmed using state of
    the art night-vision technology, developed by the military, in bright and battering
    sunlight, with vaseline smeared on the lens. Several critics, Gilbert Dot among
    them, have called it the most frightening film in the history of cinema. It is
    perhaps pertinent that it was produced by Hammer Studios.

    There are rumours, so far unconfirmed, that Horst Gack himself will attend the
    Festival for a Q and A session after the showing of the final film in the season.
    This is his foray into what he called "cinematic terrorism", the notorious, and
    notoriously lengthy, Hitchcock With Eggs. With not a jot of permission from Alfred
    Hitchcock''s estate, in fact quite the opposite, Horst Gack joined together into
    a single film the director''s entire canon, and inserted an egg into every single
    scene. Technically brilliant and absolutely terrifying, it was condemned, by Gilbert
    Dot among others, as "pointless, tasteless, and a thumping great insult to the
    Master of Suspense". The response of the Hitchcock estate is not suitable for
    family reading.

    Although the precise date of the Pointy Town Film Festival is still up in the
    air, I understand that queues are already forming outside the ticket booth in
    the Pointy Town Zippety Doo Dah Dance Hall, Scout Hut & Cinema. Whether those
    queuing have the faintest idea of what they are letting themselves in for is not
    for me to say.'
