  text: '"Come into the garden, Maud."

    "Not on your nelly. You know only too well that I am a neurasthenic recluse, and
    I prefer to remain in my bungalow with the windows shuttered, sitting at my escritoire
    penning tear-stained verses. When I have finished a particularly mawkish poem,
    I am given to flinging myself onto the floor and having a fit of the vapours,
    screaming and drumming my heels on the linoleum and beating my white fists upon
    the wainscot until they are bloody and bruised and require bandaging by Baines,
    my slovenly yet devoted maidservant. Why on earth should I risk my fragile mental
    equilibrium by coming into the garden?"

    "Oh, come on. The black bat, night, has flown."

    "I am reassured to learn that the garden is innocent of bats which do swoop and
    squeak, but there is much else out there guaranteed to send my weakling constitution
    into panic-stricken trembling. Those plants, for example. I grant you they are
    gorgeous, but their gorgeousness seems fierce, passionate, and even unnatural.
    There is hardly an individual shrub which a wanderer, straying by himself through
    a forest, would not be startled to find growing wild, as if an unearthly face
    had glared at him out of the thicket. Several, also, would shock a delicate instinct,
    such as mine, to pluck a delicate instinct at random, by an appearance of artificialness,
    indicating that there had been such commixture, and, as it were, adultery of various
    vegetable species, that the production was no longer of God''s making, but the
    monstrous offspring of man''s depraved fancy, glowing with only an evil mockery
    of beauty. They are probably the result of experiment, which, in one or two cases,
    has succeeded in mingling plants individually lovely into a compound possessing
    the questionable and ominous character that distinguishes the whole growth of
    the garden. It would not surprise me to learn that every single plant is a poisonous
    plant, as in the garden of Doctor Rappaccini in one of the mosses from an old
    manse by Nathaniel Hawthorne. And it is into the midst of this toxic organic miasma
    that you wish me to come skipping, without a care in the world? You must be insane!"

    "Maud, all I am saying is that the bat has flown away from the garden for the
    time being, and I want you to take advantage of its absence to come for a stroll.
    Come nightfall, it will be back."

    "You wish me to stroll with you in the garden, but you make no provision to protect
    me against being pricked by poisonous nettles or pointy thorns. It seems to me
    I would be far better off slumped on a chaise longue, my limbs hanging limp, keening
    with woe and summoning Baines to fetch me an invigorating tisane."

    "Well, I thought a stroll followed by a chaste yet tingling embrace in a verdant
    arbour might be a welcome diversion from your long silent empty days. I am here
    at the gate alone."

    "It has not escaped my notice that you neglect to address my point about protective
    clothing, a point I feel quite justified in making on account of those monstrous
    experimental plants with which the garden is rife. Prone to hysteria I may be,
    and I do not dispute the fact, but I can still exercise my ladybrain to deduce
    logical conclusions, and in this case I suspect the stroll is less important to
    you than the embrace in the arbour, an embrace for which you are reluctant to
    have me encumbered by, for example, a beekeeper''s suit."

    "There are no bees in the garden, Maud."

    "Perhaps not, but as I have already made crystal clear, the gloves and hooded
    suit and hat and veil of the standard beekeeping suit would afford me protection
    against the perils of poisonous spiny vegetation. It is true that, with me thus
    engarbed, you may find any embrace we recklessly throw ourselves into a measure
    less tingling than you desire, but I would have you recall that Sylvia Plath kept
    bees and I am sure her embraces with Ted Hughes were never less than torrid."

    "It sounds to me as if you might after all be considering coming into the garden,
    Maud, if I make all the necessary preparations."

    "Do not get ahead of yourself. Thus far we have merely addressed the issue of
    appropriate apparel. If I am not to be reduced to a quivering quaking screaming
    doolally flibbertigibbet, there is much else to be discussed, negotiated, and
    decided, and plans set afoot to meet my conditions in full. You tell me that the
    black bat of the garden has flown. But how can I be sure you are not just trying
    to pull the wool over my eyes, in your eagerness to stroll and embrace, albeit
    chastely, but with tingling, in a verdant arbour? The bat may already have come
    back, and be hiding somewhere, concealed behind a frond, ready to flutter forth
    and come swooping and squeaking and get itself entangled in my flowing Pre-Raphaelite
    tresses, a circumstance that would inevitably lead to my being undone by palpitations
    and convulsions, leading to insensibility and possibly coma. Baines would have
    to run, run like the wind, to the grim bleak asylum on the hill to collect the
    necessary paperwork to have me admitted therein, and I fear she is no longer capable
    of running, being aged and infirm herself, as well as slovenly and devoted."

    "Oh, come on, Maud, just come into the garden for Christ''s sake!"

    "Blasphemy will get you nowhere. In fact, now my girly ears have been assailed
    by the sound of the Lord''s name taken in vain, I must retire to my inner sanctum,
    armed with a copy of The Book Of Common Prayer, and I shall do my devotions with
    the last reserves of energy I possess, before crumpling to the floor in a pitiable
    heap of exhaustion and neurasthenia. A pox on your garden, sir!"

    "Well, if that''s your final word, Maud, I think I shall instead go for a spin
    on my penny-farthing, out on the moors, in fog and mist, there to be set upon
    by werewolves."

    "As you wish. Toodle-pip!"'
