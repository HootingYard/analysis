  text: 'And so it happened that Maud, having resisted the blandishments of the cad
    whose dearest wish was to coax her into the garden, repaired, not to her inner
    sanctum to do her devotions, but to her sitting-room, where she collapsed on a
    sofa and rang the bell to summon Baines, her slovenly yet devoted maidservant.
    The bell in the scullery was cracked, and it clunked rather than rang, but it
    had the desired effect, and Baines went staggering along the bungalow corridor
    to her mistress, leaving smudges on the wall where she stopped to lean against
    it, to catch her breath, every few paces.

    "Shall I be getting madam her invigorating tisane?" asked Baines, when eventually
    she toppled into the sitting-room.

    "You may rise, Baines," said Maud, mistaking her maidservant''s sprawling upon
    the carpet as a posture of subservience rather than exhaustion, adding "And no,
    I have decided instead to take a goodly draft of laudanum. Be so good as to fetch
    it."

    Fetched it was, eventually, and Maud knocked it back and fell into a welcome stupor,
    during which she dreamed vivid, unsettling, and visionary dreams, so vivid and
    unsettling and visionary that as soon as she woke from her opium daze, she dragged
    herself to her escritoire to record them for posterity, and literature, and immortality.
    But hardly had she picked up her biro than she was interrupted by an urgent hammering
    at the door.

    Readers alert to anachronism will have spluttered at that mention of a biro. Surely,
    they will ejaculate, a Victorian hysteric could not wield a biro to write down
    her effusions! However, Maud''s biro was not the biro invented by the Hungarian
    ballpoint pen inventor Laszlo Biro, but a writing instrument of her own devising,
    more akin to a steel-nibbed fountain pen, which she dubbed a "biro" on account
    of a suggestive voice in her head which had spoken to her in a vivid and unsettling
    and visionary dream during an earlier opium daze.

    The wondrous sights and sounds vouchsafed to her in the present dream, which she
    was going to write down, were lost forever due to the hammering at her door. When,
    later, she returned to her escritoire, she found, to her no small surprise and
    mortification, that though she still retained some vague and dim recollection
    of the general purport of the vision, yet, with the exception of some eight or
    ten scattered lines and images, all the rest had passed away like the images on
    the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast, but, alas! without the
    after restoration of the latter!

    The slovenly yet devoted Baines, having glugged twice as much laudanum as her
    mistress, was slumped insensible against the wainscot in a corner of the sitting-room,
    so Maud went to answer the hammering at the door herself. She opened it to reveal
    a man. He was of medium height, thin and sallow, with grey whiskers, thick grey
    hair, bushy eyebrows, and small, pointed and inquiring features which gave him
    rather the aspect of a prying bird. His eyes were little and sparkling. His mouth,
    strangely enough, was ecclesiastical. He was clad in very light-coloured clothes,
    yellow-grey tweeds, a yellow silk necktie, and a fawn-coloured Homburg hat. And
    no human being had ever encountered him in a pair of boots unprotected by spats.
    He was strikingly similar to the dweller on the threshold in the story by Robert
    Smythe Hichens.

    "Good day, madam," he said, the more familiar, to us, "hello", having not yet
    been introduced, by Thomas Edison, as a common greeting, "I am a person from Porlock,
    come on business."

    "Where is Porlock, and what is your business?" asked Maud, who did not mince words
    with persons she supposed to be "in trade".

    "Porlock is a coastal village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated
    in a deep hollow below Exmoor, five miles west of Minehead, madam, and my business
    is of a delicate nature the like of which I would beg to suggest is better disposed
    of indoors. May I come in?"

    Maud was rather startled, but she did not forget the social niceties, and instructed
    the person from Porlock to walk through the grounds to the rear of the bungalow
    where he would find the tradesman''s entrance. He was not actually in trade, but
    the very thought of engaging in a discussion, which might become an argument,
    with a Victorian lady on her doorstep caused him such a mortification of the bowels
    that he immediately doffed his Homburg and went off as he was bidden. Maud, meanwhile,
    slammed the door shut and returned in haste to the sitting-room to rouse Baines.
    Baines had the only key to the tradesman''s entrance, and had naturally never
    divulged to Maud where it was kept. It was while she was pouring a bucket of cold
    water over the prostrate form of her maidservant that the last remembered fragments
    of her dream vision fled from Maud''s brain, and her chance of literary immortality
    was forever lost.

    Some hours having passed, the person from Porlock was admitted to the parlour,
    where he laid his cards on the table. They were Tarot cards.

    "What devilry is this, sir?" expostulated Maud, who was a devout Anglican.

    "I did say it was a delicate matter, madam," said her visitor, and he removed
    his Homburg to reveal that his scalp was shaved bare, and upon the flesh, in livid
    colours, was tattooed the number 666. And was there a hint of the horns of a goat?

    To be continued...'
