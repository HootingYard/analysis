  text: 'The title of this piece ought to be For Those In Peril On The Sea, but so
    caught up am I in my series of "On..." essay titles that it seemed a shame to
    muck it up. Hence the somewhat forced rephrasing, which doesn''t even pass muster
    as an entry in an index, where it would be better put as Sea, The, For Those In
    Peril On. I am sure there are other ways to rearrange the words, depending upon
    which term one wished to give due prominence--Those or Peril, for example--but
    I am not going to waste my time and yours by further shilly-shallying. We need
    to get down to business, which today is to respond to the following letter, received
    from reader Tim Thurn:

    Now look here, Mr Key, he hectors, I cannot be alone in wondering why you seem
    never to mention the sinking of the RMS Titanic. You bang on and on, to the point
    of tedium, about the Munich Air Disaster and the Hindenburg and, though they are
    not disasters of the same kidney, notable twentieth century events such as the
    Kennedy assassination and the Tet Offensive. Yet of the Titanic, barely a word,
    though a brief search reveals that you use (or overuse) the word titanic to describe
    the pamphleteer Dobson. This weekend we will mark the one hundredth anniversary
    of the loss of the liner in the icy wastes of the north Atlantic, so I think it
    is about bloody time you turned your attention to it, if you can drag yourself
    away from peering myopically out of the window at crows and at whatever else you
    peer at when you look out of the window. Get a grip. Passionately yours, Tim Thurn.

    Well, that''s me told. It might surprise Mr Thurn to learn that I am something
    of a Titanic scholar, having at one point in my life read many, many books on
    the subject. I think I may acquit myself fairly well were I to take it as a quiz
    subject. To take a snippet at random, I know, for example, that second mate Charles
    Lightoller, who survived the sinking, was later decorated for various heroics
    during the First World War and played his part in the Second by sailing one of
    the "little ships" across the channel in the evacuation of Dunkirk. Also, if he
    had been reading these essays, Mr Thurn would know that I grew up living not far
    away from Eva Hart, one of the longest-lived survivors of the disaster, though
    it is true that I never went calling on her to winkle out her memories, nor did
    I ever go the pub named after her to raise a glass in memory of all those who
    drowned on that dreadful night in what Mr Thurn likes to call "the icy wastes
    of the north Atlantic".

    Of all the books I read, my favourite was Titanic : Psychic Forewarnings Of A
    Tragedy by George Behe (1989), which collects over one hundred accounts of premonitory
    dreams and visions and so on. Amusingly, as far as I recall, every single one
    of these accounts was recorded after the fifteenth of April 1912, so we have someone
    writing in, say, 1920 about a dream they had in 1910. Interestingly, not one of
    the psychic forewarnings features either Kate Winslet or Leonardo Di Caprio, who
    many young persons today believe portrayed real historical characters in the 1997
    James Cameron blockbuster. Given the parlous state of history teaching in our
    self-esteem and diversity hubs, it is a small mercy that I have yet to hear of
    a youngster exclaiming with shock that the ship sinks at the end of the film.

    On Sunday, I shall be marking the anniversary as I always do. I corral a choir
    of tinies and take them to Nameless Pond, my local duckpond. It is not the north
    Atlantic, nor at this time of year is it icy, nor is it indeed the sea, but I
    live far from the sea, and it is, after all, a body of water, and a better site
    for the commemoration than, say, a bathtub or butler sink. We launch a paper boat
    upon the pond, and then the tinies sing the Victorian hymn Eternal Father, Strong
    To Save by William Whiting, which, of course, contains the couplet "Oh, hear us
    when we cry to Thee, / For those in peril on the sea!" The hymn was also used
    by Benjamin Britten in Noye''s Fludde (1957), though not sung by the tinies. It
    was also the final hymn sung at the Sunday service on the Titanic on Sunday the
    fourteenth of April 1912, just hours before the sinking. If our paper boat has
    been folded into shape with sufficient cack-handedness, it usually sinks under
    the weight of its cargo of pebbles while the tinies are singing. If it does not,
    I get them to repeat the hymn from the beginning, while chucking further pebbles
    at the paper boat in hopes of scuppering it. We like to pretend that the various
    ducks disporting themselves upon the pond are the Titanic''s lifeboats. In order
    to compensate for the disparities in scale--some of the ducks are actually bigger
    than our paper boat--we squint or, in my case, remove our spectacles so the whole
    scene is a blur.

    One year, during this mournful little ceremony, a passing duckpond-circumnavigating
    pedestrian buttonholed me to ask what we were doing. When I explained, he pointed
    out that, though we had recreated the ship (a paper boat) and the lifeboats (the
    ducks), there was nothing to represent the iceberg. Without this, he said, our
    memorial singsong was a mere farrago. Sadly, I had to agree. It is thus pleasing
    to note that, as the tone of Nameless Pond and its surroundings are dragged ever
    further into barbarism by the local riffraff, some antisocial scalliwag has tossed
    an abandoned fridge into the water.

    Perhaps Mr Thurn should come and join us on Sunday, and bring his funerary violin.
