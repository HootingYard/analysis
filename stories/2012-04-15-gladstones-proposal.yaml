  text: "After four nervy months, [Gladstone] came close to proposing at the Coliseum\
    \ on a moonlit January evening. A few days later he did it instead by letter.\
    \ It was not a proposal to sweep a young girl off her feet.\n\u201CI seek much\
    \ in a wife in gifts better than those of our human pride, and am also sensible\
    \ that she can find little in me,\u201D he wrote, in a single long-winded sentence,\
    \ \u201Csensible that, were you to treat this note as the offspring of utter presumption,\
    \ I must not be surprised: sensible that the life I invite you to share, even\
    \ if it be not attended, as I trust it is not, with peculiar disadvantages of\
    \ an outward kind, is one, I do not say unequal to your deserts, for that were\
    \ saying little, but liable at best to changes and perplexities and pains which,\
    \ for myself, I contemplate without apprehension, but to which it is perhaps selfishness\
    \ in the main, with the sense of inward dependence counteracting an opposite sense\
    \ of my too real unworthiness, which would make me contribute to expose another\u2014\
    and that other!\u201D\nOn receiving the letter Catherine pleaded for time, no\
    \ doubt hoping it would give her the opportunity to work out exactly what Gladstone\
    \ meant.*\n*\u201DHe really was a frightful old prig,\u201D wrote Clement Attlee\u2026\
    \ on reading this letter in a biography of Gladstone, \u201CFancy writing a letter\
    \ proposing marriage including a sentence of 140 words all about the Almighty.\
    \ He was a dreadful person.\u201D\nfrom The Lion And The Unicorn\_: Gladstone\
    \ vs Disraeli by Richard Aldous (2006)"
