  text: "Here is a spot of small press publishing history, which might be of vague\
    \ interest to a few readers.\n\u2018Twas long, long ago, in the autumn of 1986\
    \ that my pal Max D\xE9charn\xE9 and I conceived the idea of publishing an anthology\
    \ of our various drivellings. A decade earlier, Max had been a great enthusiast\
    \ of punk and the DIY approach to making records\u2014he realised his ambition\
    \ of releasing a single while still in his teens. Why not do the same with the\
    \ printed word? Neither of us, I think, was particularly aware of the thriving\
    \ small press scene then extant, but we were only too conscious that I had a job\
    \ in an office with a big humming photocopier to which I had access at weekends.\
    \ We assembled fifty pages each of material, typed it out on an electronic typewriter,\
    \ worked out the pagination by making a little dummy booklet, and voila!, we had\
    \ an anthology. All we needed now was a title and a name for our imprint. Max\
    \ had a job at the time which he absolutely loathed, and entertained murderous\
    \ fantasies about his boss. Thus Stab Your Employer popped into his head without\
    \ too much struggle. In the course of a phone call during which we discussed what\
    \ to call ourselves, I cast my eyes along the bookshelf and spotted Malice Aforethought\
    \ by Francis Iles. Hence the name of the Press was born. In retrospect, this does\
    \ not seem a fortuitous choice, too redolent of an imprint dedicated to crime\
    \ fiction. But we were young and stupid and impulsive, I suppose.\nOne hefty bout\
    \ of illegal weekend photocopying later, we had fifty fat but spineless one-hundred-page\
    \ booklets for sale. Ah yes, sales. Who on earth we imagined might buy this work\
    \ of matchless genius, other than our friends and acquaintances, I cannot recall.\
    \ Some copies we sent out on spec to persons we admired, to be met, of course,\
    \ with resounding indifference\u2014except in one case. Max had developed a great\
    \ liking for the works issued by Atlas Press, and popped a copy of Stab Your Employer\
    \ in the post to them. I do not think we understood at the time that Atlas was\
    \ a shoestring operation with resources only marginally better than our own. As\
    \ far as I know, what happened next was that Alasdair Brotchie of Atlas passed\
    \ the booklet on to his friend, the artist Jane Colling, and Jane in turn brought\
    \ it to the attention of her friend Chris Cutler, the drummer, one-time member\
    \ of Henry Cow, and onlie begetter of Recommended Records. Chris was then in the\
    \ early years of producing the ReR Quarterly, a printed-magazine-with-LP. Something\
    \ I had written must have appealed to him, for I was then asked to contribute\
    \ a piece for the Quarterly. Chris did not ask me himself, but delegated the request\
    \ to a young man acting as a sort of typist/factotum for Recommended, Ed Baxter\u2014\
    who is today the benevolent dictator at the head of Resonance104.4FM. Thus were\
    \ connections made that in some cases last to this day.\nMax and I rattled off\
    \ a second anthology, Smooching With Istvan, early in 1987. (It is in this booklet\
    \ that \u201CHooting Yard\u201D made its very first appearance, as recalled here.)\
    \ Inspired by the sheer ease of producing works\u2014though we did start paying\
    \ for photocopying\u2014we bashed out lots of pamphlets over the next couple of\
    \ years. (There is a complete list of my own stuff here.) At the same time, Ed\
    \ Baxter was tirelessly bringing into being the Small Press Group, along with\
    \ allies such as Atlas and, from an older generation, the legendary John Nicholson.\
    \ Max and I became keen and, I hope, useful members of the group, which arranged\
    \ book fairs and published three, or possibly four, paperback Small Press Yearbooks.\
    \ These directories, which included how-to-do-it guides and much else, stand as\
    \ a fascinating record of activity in the last years before Het Internet changed\
    \ the landscape.\nThough Max and I never actually collaborated again\u2014and,\
    \ in truth, both Stab Your Employer and Smooching With Istvan simply jammed our\
    \ individual pieces between the same covers\u2014 we issued our own works and\
    \ expanded the press to publish others. These included Ginseng Fuchsia Lefleur,\
    \ a Small Press Group friend from Canada, whose North American Freestyle Playpen\
    \ Zen is possibly the rarest of all Malice Aforethought Press pamphlets\u2014\
    consider yourself very fortunate if you own a copy. I also fell in with Ellis\
    \ Sharp, latterly of Zoilus Press and a great favourite of the Grauniad's Nicholas\
    \ Lezard. Ellis lived near me and my ex-wife used to cut his hair. She introduced\
    \ us, and I think we were both surprised that we liked each other's work. General\
    \ Jaruzelski's Sunglasses was the first Ellis Sharp work we published\u2014the\
    \ first piece credited to \u201CEllis Sharp\u201D ever\u2014and several more followed.\
    \ It is as rare, I suspect, as Ms Lefleur's outpouring. Bear in mind that many\
    \ of these pamphlets came in editions of twenty-five, or even fewer. (I think\
    \ one of my own pamphlets was limited to a dozen copies.)\nThe final Malice Aforethought\
    \ Press publications were \u201Cproper\u201D paperbacks\u2014my own Twitching\
    \ And Shattered, Max's Beat Your Relatives To A Bloody Pulp and The Prisoner Of\
    \ Brenda, and a couple of one-offs. Probably the finest thing we ever published\
    \ was a selection of work by the great John Bently of Liver And Lights, another\
    \ Small Press Group hero. The last book, which Max alone brought into being, was\
    \ a collection by a member of the beat combo Fortran Five. My memory of this last\
    \ is hazy, because I was whirling ever more rapidly towards the Wilderness Years.\
    \ By the time I emerged from them, Het Internet had taken over the world, which\
    \ was now, at last, ready for the true emergence of Hooting Yard.\nI sometimes\
    \ wonder what might have happened\u2014or not happened\u2014had Max not sent a\
    \ copy of Stab Your Employer to Atlas."
