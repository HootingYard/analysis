  text: "Further to yesterday's potted history of the Malice Aforethought Press, I\
    \ rummaged in a paper-midden and found a dog-eared copy of our 1988 mail order\
    \ catalogue. I thought it might be of historical interest to reproduce some of\
    \ the contents, in spite of the sinking feeling I had as I read my blurbs and\
    \ shuddered at the, er, gaudiness of my prose.\nAll of these pamphlets are of\
    \ course out of print, though most of the texts were collected in the 1989 paperback\
    \ Twitching And Shattered. That, too, is out of print, but copies occasionally\
    \ crop up on eBay or in secondhand bookshops or for auction here at Hooting Yard.\n\
    Preface\n  The Malice Aforethought Press was established in 1986 for the express\
    \ purpose of scraping vegetable matter, rinds, and caked grime from the interior\
    \ walls of a large iron bran-tub. However, this dreadful scheme met only with\
    \ ignominy and ruin. Fleeing to a sanatorium in Greenland, the Malice Aforethought\
    \ Press held a number of fruitless meetings with aviators, bonnibels, conspirators,\
    \ dolts, ecclesiastics, fanatics, gaberlunzies, hacks, idiots, joskins, kakas,\
    \ lepers, mahouts, notaries, obfuscators, polatouches, quaestors, revengers, succubae,\
    \ tziganes, uhlans, vipers, wags, xemas, yahoos, and zealots. Halfway through\
    \ this series of conferences, the sanatorium was uprooted from the sod and pitchforked\
    \ into the demented ocean by an inexplicable force. Things looked grim. Saved\
    \ from drowning by the intervention of a crumpled urchin, the Malice Aforethought\
    \ Press returned to England, determined to enwrap the bran-tub in massive, fibrous\
    \ blankets. Thousands upon thousands of eager volunteers had to be turned away,\
    \ ejected into hailstorms through the rotting wooden portal which fronts our monstrous\
    \ office. As a sop to these thousands, the Malice Aforethought Press has arranged\
    \ to publish a selection of documents which lay bare the true history of the rusted\
    \ cooking-pots stacked higgledy-piggledy in the corridors of a smashed-up building\
    \ painted crimson...\nHoots Of Destiny\n  Three graphic stories. Many pictures,\
    \ a few words.\n1. Fun with gravel\n  2. L'Histoire du paving slabs\n  3. Why\
    \ do potatoes exist?\nWhy indeed? An unclassifiable work of shining lucidity and\
    \ brazen incorrigibility. The leitmotifs of this ridiculous publication, the keys\
    \ to its charm, are many and various. One could perhaps single out an eyebrow,\
    \ a hake, an inspirational choir funnel. Each copy is produced by our Frank on\
    \ an individual basis; Hoots Of Destiny is part hand-drawn, part hand-written,\
    \ and hand-coloured throughout. Each copy is dated, numbered, signed, and dedicated.\
    \ So there. The perfect gift for bailiffs, Jesuit fathers, or menacing figures\
    \ draped in grisly shifts.\nForty Visits To The Worm Farm\n  A hectic tale of\
    \ malfeasance and calumny, set in an exciting worm farm. Whisks, turnips, and\
    \ dangerous machinery abound, and the cast of unlikely characters includes Canute\
    \ Hellhound, whose tremendous, ground-breaking lecture on the pith and nubs of\
    \ wormery is reprinted in part. This pure and urgent work brings together the\
    \ Sacred and the Profane, the Dim and the Doomed, and the Patron Saint of Worms\
    \ with his Destiny. Our classic bestseller! The text is accompanied by four illustrations\
    \ in which the author depicts his characters with withering intensity. If you\
    \ buy only one book this year, you would be advised to seek medical help.\nTales\
    \ Of Hoon\n  A magnificent collection of four crumpled yarns set in the dismal,\
    \ sump-strewn land of Hoon, with the odd detour to its hinterland of purple hills\
    \ and bauxite mines. A cast of hundreds, most of whom are called Ned, appears\
    \ in these rum and preposterous stories. As a special treat, the texts are complemented\
    \ by three maps and a really exciting A3 fold-out diagram, hand-coloured and unbelievably\
    \ lavish. Each copy also contains a piece of sandpaper. Truly a labour of love;\
    \ either that or sheer dementia.\nA Zest For Crumpled Things\n  Twenty-six potted\
    \ biographies of characters whose behaviour would be out of place in most of what\
    \ passes for \"fiction\" these days. The texts make use of neologism, poltroonery,\
    \ and reverential plagiarism of M P Shiel (1865-1947). Among those potted by Frank's\
    \ doolally pen are Maud Abdab, Cora Dwabb, Istvan Ick, Ned Lip, and Jodhpur Valentine.\
    \ With twenty-six photographs from the author's collection, rescued from an incinerator\
    \ in the cellar of a ruinous building in the north of England.\nThe Churn In The\
    \ Muck\n  A couple of stories; one about ponds, hotels, and hollyhocks, the other\
    \ about hotels, hollyhocks, and ponds. More alphabetical excursions by Frank,\
    \ who doesn't intend to abandon this compositional device until he has well and\
    \ truly wrung its neck. Biographical notes on the main characters are bunged in\
    \ at the end for no apparent reason, shedding unpitying light on old favourites\
    \ like Lars Talc as well as introducing some brand new gits, including Eileen\
    \ Hollyhock and the Brothers Hellbag. Fully illustrated with four black & white\
    \ plates by the author. A splash of colour is added by the insertion of a sheet\
    \ of wallpaper in all fifty copies of this first edition, numbered and signed\
    \ and all the usual shenanigans...\nHouse Of Turps (in preparation)\n  The first\
    \ volume in a projected series of 26 books in which the full and uproarious history\
    \ of the House of Turps is dissected with a blunt pen-knife. This initial book\
    \ potters about in the pre-history of the House, examining the events leading\
    \ to its foundation, in particular the role played by a large number of inanimate\
    \ objects including hammers, iron pots, wrestling-rings, and bandage paste. Future\
    \ volumes in the series will lay bare the complete history of this remarkable\
    \ institution, the whole adding up to what can only be described as a Bath of\
    \ Learning, a Broth of Truth. Deceptively simple, even rambling, the construction\
    \ of this first book is awesomely complicated, its intricate machinery a triumph\
    \ of meldrum and binge. Illustrated by the author, as usual. Signed & numbered,\
    \ as usual. Silk-screened cover, for once.\nNOTE : That last blurb was written\
    \ before I actually wrote House Of Turps. It remains the only one of the planned\
    \ series of twenty-six ever to see the light of day. The cover was not silk-screened."
