  text: "One would not think an undertaker's mute would attract vilification. That,\
    \ however, was precisely the fate of a blameless little Totnes undertaker's mute\
    \ in the early years of the last century.\nThe typical undertaker's mute\u2014\
    and the Totnes mute was nothing if not typical\u2014was a ragamuffin street urchin,\
    \ plucked from the squalor of the stews and rookeries, dusted down and primped\
    \ up, togged out in black and with a top hat usually too big for his undernourished\
    \ head, and paid a penny or two to march at the head of a funeral procession,\
    \ mawkish, mournful, woebegone and mute. Why on earth would anybody vilify such\
    \ a mite?\nIt is not that the Totnesniks were a peculiarly vindictive lot. As\
    \ everywhere else, they had their good and bad. Most of them, faced with a funeral\
    \ procession making its way slowly through the Totnes streets, would stop, and\
    \ bow their heads, and remain silent and solemn. Some would weep. Yet even the\
    \ weepers, when they spotted the tiny mute, would cry out insults and imprecations,\
    \ and in some cases even death threats. It was fortunate that the undertaker had\
    \ his horses well-trained, or they might have taken fright and bolted, and ruined\
    \ the funeral. Fortunate, too, that the enraged Totnesniks satisfied themselves\
    \ with catcalls and shouting, and did not shower the undertaker's mute with rotting\
    \ fruit and pebbles. As for the little mute himself, he acquitted himself honourably,\
    \ through funeral after funeral, never once breaking step, in spite of his rickets,\
    \ and never once retaliating, in spite of the provocation. Did he break down,\
    \ or complain, or vow revenge, when once more safe inside the undertaker's office?\
    \ Or was he simply happy with his tuppence? It was, after all, a tuppence beyond\
    \ the most vivid dreams of the other Totnes urchins, and would buy him oysters\
    \ or eels for his supper.\nThe most baffling feature of the whole business is\
    \ the absence of any contemporary comment in the local press. I have trawled through\
    \ the archives of the Totnes Bugle & Advertiser and of the Totnes Counter-Bugle\
    \ & Advertiser, and even of the Proceedings Of The Secret Totnes Branch Of The\
    \ Revolutionary Workers\u2019 Anarchist Collective Steering Committee, to no avail.\
    \ It is worth pointing out, however, that some malfeasant scamp has been through\
    \ the papers with a snipping tool, and several articles are missing. Would they\
    \ be revelatory, if ever discovered?\nWhat we do have is a series of memoirs,\
    \ published in the 1920s and 1930s, in which the author claims to be the now adult\
    \ undertaker's mute. I Was The Vilified Totnes Undertaker's Mute (1922), Further\
    \ Reminiscences Of The Totnes Undertaker's Mute (1929), and Now I Can Speak\_\
    : Funeral Processions In Turn Of The Century Totnes, Recollected By One Who Was\
    \ There, But Mute (1933) were the only books ever issued by a mysterious publishing\
    \ house based, not in Totnes, but in its anagrammatic counterpart. The author\
    \ himself remained anonymous. Several critics have been persuaded into vertiginous\
    \ flights of fancy by the fact, surely coincidental, that the first volume appeared\
    \ on the very same day as T S Eliot's The Waste Land. Great play is made of the\
    \ fact that one of the funeral processions the author claims to have mutely marched\
    \ at the head of was that of \u201Cthe famous clairvoyante, Madame Sosostris\u201D\
    . What these fantasists never point out is that this funeral is mentioned only\
    \ in the 1933 volume, which also, notoriously, contains the lines \u201CThat corpse\
    \ you planted last year in your garden, has it begun to sprout?\u201D and \u201C\
    Twit twit twit Jug jug jug jug jug jug So rudely forc'd. Tereu\u201D. If compelling\
    \ evidence that TS Eliot was not the author of the undertaker's mute trilogy is\
    \ still required\u2014and I fear there are nutters abroad who persist in ever\
    \ more fanciful conjectures\u2014there remains the fact that no record exists,\
    \ anywhere, of a Madame Sosostris, famous or not, clairvoyante or not, dying or\
    \ being buried or cremated or in any way commemorated in Totnes in the year given\
    \ in the book, or for a decade on either side. I have myself trawled the parish\
    \ registers, and all sorts of other archives, as assiduously as I pored over the\
    \ local Totnes newspapers and workers\u2019 collective steering committee minutes.\n\
    We then have to ask if there is a word of truth in this trio of curious volumes.\
    \ It is not enough to say, as Dizzleby does, \u201CWell if Eliot didn't write\
    \ them, Ezra Pound probably did, but he was as mad as a hatter\u201D. Dizzleby,\
    \ let us remember, has used exactly the same words when referring to dozens of\
    \ other obscure works of the interwar years, not least one written by his own\
    \ grandfather, who was not, I hasten to add, Ezra Pound. At least, not according\
    \ to the documentation, including birth certificates, measles inoculation records,\
    \ and one width swimming achievement citations, which I have been through with\
    \ a fine-toothed comb, as diligently as I beavered away at the local Totnes newspapers\
    \ and workers\u2019 collective steering committee minutes and parish registers\
    \ and all sorts of other archives.\nMy researches have led me to the conclusion\
    \ that we are unlikely ever to identify the author of the Totnes undertaker's\
    \ mute trilogy. If we cannot say who wrote it, then as sure as eggs is eggs we\
    \ cannot vouch for its historical reliability. It may be the case, as Dizzleby's\
    \ own daughter argued, that the little Totnes undertaker's mute, and the vilification\
    \ to which he was so shamefully subject, never existed at all, and is a mere phantasm,\
    \ a spectre, a ghost. We are then forced to ask, who would make him up?, and why?\n\
    To which the answers are, I would, and for my own amusement."
