  text: 'Often, if you are out of doors and crane your neck at such an angle that
    you are looking up at the sky, you will see a flock of birds. Not always, but
    often, often enough in any case to make my opening sentence credible. I strive,
    as a writer, to be credible. I think all writers do. We want readers to believe
    what we are telling them, if only temporarily, during the act of reading. This
    is the case even with persons who write of outlandish and preposterous things,
    for example those kinds of science fiction stories set in the distant future on
    far-flung planets, where characters with names like Zybog and Kagvond try to prevent
    an explosion at the weapons facility on Planet X-47215, while menaced by intergalactic
    beings with tentacles and metallic parts. This is obviously tosh, but the writer
    will try to make it credible. As soon as you put the potboiler or pulp magazine
    aside, you can dismiss what you have just read as piffle. The important thing
    is that you believe it while you are reading it.

    So I do not think it is outwith the bounds of reason to claim that, in peering
    up at the sky, you will often see a flock of birds. It depends where you are,
    of course. Some areas are more bird-haunted than others. If you are in a desert,
    you might see a flock of vultures, circling over potential carrion, but probably
    not as often as, at the seaside, you might spot a flock of seagulls. In fact at
    some seaside resorts, particularly those with gigantic rubbish tips in the vicinity,
    it is hard to look up at the sky without seeing teeming seagulls. The desert and
    the seaside are extreme cases, geographically, but the fact that in both, or rather
    above both, one might glimpse flocks of birds is telling, I think, in terms of
    my argument.

    Not all birds fly about in flocks. Come to think of it, not all birds fly. The
    ostrich, for example, is a flightless bird, and a remarkably stupid one. That
    being so, you are unlikely to read a sentence such as

    Above, a huge flock of ostriches swooped in the blue sky, silhouetted against
    the blazing sun at noon on Thursday.

    which would probably cause you to fling the book across the room in exasperation.
    On the other hand, you might find it credible if the sentence was

    Above, a huge flock of ostriches swooped in the beige sky, silhouetted against
    the blazing suns at noon on Thursday at the weapons facility on Planet X-47215,
    where Zybog and Kagvond were doing battle with intergalactic beings with tentacles
    and metallic parts while trying to prevent an explosion which would have unforeseeable
    effects on the space-time continuum.

    In this context, flying ostriches might be credible. Much depends on your tolerance
    for science fiction. If it is low, you might still fling the book across the room
    in exasperation, and go to find something else to read.

    If a writer wishes to entertain you, however fleetingly, with a scene in which
    a flock of birds is visible in the sky, they will need to do a spot of ornithological
    research to ensure that the birds they mention are indeed ones that fly about
    in flocks. One of the reasons for this is that no writer is omniscient, and it
    may well be that among their readers are persons who know more than they do about
    particular subjects. The ignorant but wily writer can get around this by being
    non-specific, as in this example:

    "Gosh, Primrose, look! There is a huge flock of birds in the sky!"

    The risk here is that the ornithologically-competent reader could find themselves
    wondering what type of birds, precisely, are being pointed out to international
    woman of mystery Primrose Dent in your exciting espionage thriller. In their wondering,
    they are likely to become distracted and disengaged from the convoluted plot you
    are doing your best to keep moving briskly along, and they might fling the book
    across the room in exasperation. It would be better, then, to write

    "Gosh, Primrose, look! There is a huge flock of starlings in the sky!"

    as starlings do in fact fly in flocks. Your bird-brainy reader will be entertained,
    and may even impute to you more ornithological knowledge than you actually possess.
    This is not without its own risks, but generally speaking the reader will bask
    in their delusion so long as you do not get too carried away. Just because you
    know that starlings fly in flocks does not mean that you can start blathering
    on about their feeding habits, nesting patterns, lore and legend, and what have
    you, unless of course you already know about these things. If you do not, but
    still feel impelled to write about starlings'' feeding habits, nesting patterns,
    lore and legend, etcetera, to add a piquant starlingy quality to your prose, then
    for God''s sake submit your manuscript to a trained ornithologist before unleashing
    it upon the world. This is particularly important if, in devising the character
    of international woman of mystery Primrose Dent, you decide it would be apt to
    make her a starling expert. If you cannot be bothered to do the research, or cannot
    afford the services of an ornithology adviser, your best bet would be to make
    Primrose Dent an intergalactic woman of mystery, and have her scooting about bent
    on espionage at the weapons facility on Planet X-47215. That way, she can be an
    expert on space-starlings rather than real, earthly starlings, and you can write
    whatever you like about their feeding habits, nesting patterns, lore and legend,
    etcetera, because you will be making it all up. Just don''t forget to make it
    credible.

    It may be that you wish to peer at flocks of birds in the sky without ever writing
    a word about them. In that case, take a pair of binoculars and a packed lunch,
    and stride up into the hills, and gaze. Even in areas less bird-haunted, sooner
    or later a flock of birds will appear in the sky, God willing.'
