    Over at The Dabbler today, I examine an episode from the life of the noted simpleton,
    Simple Simon. His adversary, the pieman, also appears in this tale, and not, it
    must be said, in a good light. As in all the best fables, a moral is drawn at
    the end, though not a very enlightening one.'
