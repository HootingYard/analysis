  text: "A further find in the paper-midden: a scrap dated 16th February 1992.\nYesterday\
    \ I considered a string of words to form an alphabet, words beginning and ending\
    \ a-b, b-c, c-d and so on. Let's see if I can remember it. Alb, basic, cod, drone,\
    \ earmuff, flailing, garish, hoi-polloi, [imaj?], jack, kernel, loom, marzipan,\
    \ no, orlop, [p-q], quiver, railings, squirt, tofu, [u-v], vow, wax, xerophilously,\
    \ [y-z], zeugma. The idea is (after finding something for the missing words\u2014\
    invented proper names if necessary) to write a story which mentions all those\
    \ in order.\nThis story was never written, twenty years ago, but perhaps I shall\
    \ apply myself to it now, or in the near future."
