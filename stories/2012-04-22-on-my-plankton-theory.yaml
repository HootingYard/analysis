  text: "Long, long ago, so long ago that the Malice Aforethought Press was not even\
    \ a twinkle in my eye, I wrote a poem entitled My Plankton Theory. Here it is:\n\
    All my life I'd waited\n    To announce my plankton theory\n    The public laughed\n\
    \    Top scientists jeered\n    When they heard my plankton theory\nWhen I was\
    \ a small boy\n    I swam in ponds and lakes\n    Then I grew up\n    Got diving\
    \ gear\n    And I worked out my plankton theory\nNow I'm about to die\n    I won't\
    \ go skindiving again\n    It's in my head\n    On my deathbed\n    But I never,\
    \ ever tested my plankton theory\nAs I remembered, there was another version of\
    \ this in which I had a bauxite theory rather than a plankton theory. That can't\
    \ be right, because the middle verse would make no sense. The flaw in my recollection\
    \ was confirmed when I came upon a big fat book of poems in the same paper-midden\
    \ as I found the old Malice Aforethought Press mail order catalogue. It turned\
    \ out I was confusing My Plankton Theory with a wholly separate piece, a love\
    \ song entitled 40 Years Of Hell In A Bauxite Mine. I shall draw a veil over that\
    \ one.\nThe point is that this book is crammed with over one hundred poems, written\
    \ I would guess between 1980 and 1986, and they are almost uniformly dreadful.\
    \ I can just about tippy-tap out the words of My Plankton Theory without running\
    \ screaming into the hills to throw myself into a tarn, but only just. I find\
    \ myself thanking the Lord and his angels and the hideous bat god Fatso and many\
    \ another deity that Het Internet as we know it did not then exist, for there\
    \ would have been a very real risk that I would have posted my verses for the\
    \ world to read instead of scribbling them in a private notebook. Youth of today,\
    \ be warned! Think before you commit your burblings to the interweb!\nIt is not\
    \ as if I can excuse the drivel as the product of teenage angst, as I was no longer\
    \ a teenager. I do not understand, looking back, why I was writing verse instead\
    \ of prose. But verse it was, page after page of it. It is true that I had a very\
    \ short-lived career as a performance poet, in those heady post-punk days when\
    \ performance poets were all the rage. When I say short-lived, I ought to be clear\
    \ and explain that I did one gig. This was in Norwich, in 1982, where I supported\
    \ the amusing band Serious Drinking. (The amusing thing about them was that they\
    \ pretended to be oiky proles but were of course university graduates, and at\
    \ least two of them were in receipt of healthy trust funds. I suspect genuine\
    \ oiky proles spotted the imposture without too much difficulty.) My approach\
    \ at the gig was that, after shouting--yes, shouting--each poem (examples, Snackbar\
    \ Hooligan and Ten Days In a Shed), I scrunched up the sheet of paper on which\
    \ it was hand-scribbled and threw it into the audience. I think I was generally\
    \ well-received, and I am not entirely sure why this remained my one and only\
    \ appearance before I resurfaced on a stage, twenty years later, shortly before\
    \ the dawn of the Hooting Yard you know and adore. I do recall feeling a tingle\
    \ of pleasure when the Norwich gig was announced by John Peel on his radio show.\
    \ I was billed as \"Frank Key The Poet\".\nPerhaps, in spite of the lack of actual\
    \ performances, it was the thoroughly wrong-headed idea of myself as \"The Poet\"\
    \ that kept me beavering away at verses for the next few years. I moved away from\
    \ Norwich and was no longer in contact with any kind of local music scene where\
    \ I might have been prevailed upon to spout my stuff to crowds of adoring fans.\
    \ The big fat hardback notebook was, then, quite consciously, just for me. I am\
    \ pleased to be able to say that I never badgered family and friends with it.\
    \ Few experiences are as discomfiting as being trapped in a room with someone\
    \ who says \"Let me read you a few of my latest poems\", and I had been at the\
    \ listening end of that particular horror often enough never to inflict it upon\
    \ anyone else. But it does make me wonder why on earth I was writing all this\
    \ stuff, and that it was all verse and no prose.\nAs for My Plankton Theory itself,\
    \ the roots of this towering work lie in the late 1970s, when I recall watching\
    \ a television programme--probably Horizon--in which it was confidently asserted\
    \ that \"krill is the food of the future\". Well, almost forty years on, here\
    \ we are in the future, and I am not eating krill. At least, I don't think I am.\
    \ Maybe I ought to take a closer interest in packaging, and lists of ingredients,\
    \ and modern food production processes. It may be that I am eating a lot more\
    \ krill than I suspect, shredded or pulped and somehow injected into my breakfast\
    \ cereals and snack items and smokers' poptarts and so forth. But I envisaged\
    \ a more explicit krill-centred diet, chains of fast food restaurants called Krill\
    \ R Us or Kentucky Fried Krill, krill-based delicacies for the gourmet, or even\
    \ that staple of science fiction imaginings, the krill-pill, which I would obtain\
    \ from a Krill-O-Mat before zooming off on my jetpack. Alas, the future has not\
    \ turned out quite as forecast. Thereagain, when I was a little boy I swam in\
    \ municipal swimming pools rather than in ponds and lakes, I have never been skindiving,\
    \ and I never, ever really had a plankton theory."
