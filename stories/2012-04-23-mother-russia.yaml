  text: "Her own people were mostly miserable. They wrote long glum books and sang\
    \ glum songs and went on glumly about the extent of winter and the sound of the\
    \ rivers freezing and the shortage of meat\u2014not just the serfs who had had\
    \ every reason to feel thoroughly depressed, but the rich and privileged. They\
    \ worried about their souls and stared deeply and hopelessly into the depths of\
    \ themselves. Well, that was how they had always carried on in the past anyway.\
    \ It might be different since the upheavals, but Aunt Irene doubted it\u2014circumstances\
    \ did little to alter the nature of populations. They were probably worse, if\
    \ the truth were known.\nAlice Thomas Ellis, The 27th Kingdom (1982)"
