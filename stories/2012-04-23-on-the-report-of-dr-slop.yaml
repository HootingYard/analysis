  text: 'For previous episodes of Maud, see here

    Herewith my report of the events of the 14th inst. If I am required at a future
    date to give similar accounts of the 14th ult. and the 14th prox. I will be happy
    to oblige, present circumstances permitting.

    My name is Dr Slop and I am a mesmerist, duly certified as such by the Worthy
    Fellowship of Victorian Mesmerists. On the morning of the 14th inst. I received
    a summons to the bungalow adjoining the bungalow of which I had recently taken
    possession. I was given to understand that the maidservant of the bungalow, one
    Baines, of slovenly yet devoted disposition, had taken leave of her senses and
    was giving vent to her inner life, in spite of being a person of the lower orders.
    In a matter of such urgency I dispense with the social niceties and I swept with
    elan and steely determination out of doors without wearing a hat.

    Upon opening the gate of the adjoining bungalow and proceeding along the garden
    path, I was disconcerted to encounter a cad. The cad began to explain that his
    dearest wish was to entice the lady of the bungalow into the garden, and could
    I assist in persuading her? I cut him short with a clean gentlemanly thrust of
    my fist into his windpipe, a ploy I learned when serving overseas in the tropics,
    where it saved my bacon on more than one occasion. The cad collapsed upon the
    garden path and will not, I warrant, pester the lady for some time to come. My
    ears were offended by his unmanly gasping and gurgling noises, so before continuing
    to the front door I kicked him in the head several times.

    I rapped upon the door of the bungalow with great urgency, whereupon I was ushered
    inside by a sloven I took to be the maidservant, Baines. Before I had the opportunity
    to place her head in a vice and make strangely significant passing movements of
    my hands in order to mesmerise her, her mistress cried weakly to me from the breakfast
    parlour. She insisted that I join her for a breakfast of devilled kidneys before
    dealing with the patient. My own preference has always been for kedgeree, bloaters,
    and raw liver as the first meal of the day, and indeed I had already eaten double
    helpings of all, and had additional portions tucked in my pockets in case of sudden
    peckishness, but one does not refuse a breakfast invitation from a neurasthenic
    lady, so I sat at the table with her and tucked my napkin under my chin.

    While I waited for Baines to pile my plate high, the lady, who I was given to
    understand had already eaten one devilled kidney, began to rock back and forth
    on her chair. Her pallid face blushed crimson, her Pre-Raphaelite tresses stood
    stiffly on end as if she were attached to one of those newfangled electromagnetic
    machines, and she began to declaim incomprehensible gibberish in a grating and
    disturbingly masculine voice. This was no mere attack of the vapours.

    I leapt up from my chair and was about to place the lady''s head in a vice and
    make strangely significant passing movements of my hands over her, when Baines,
    behind me, dropped the plate and clutched at my arm. Before I was able to berate
    her for the unseemly and socially reprehensible nature of her action, she gibbered
    something. Incapable of understanding her strangulated lower class vowels, I slapped
    her several times across the face, then several more times, and demanded that
    she speak slowly and clearly and in the best approximation she could manage of
    civilised human speech.

    I must commend her efforts, for by listening closely I learned that in all likelihood
    the lady''s alarmingly unladylike plight was due to some malign tampering with
    the devilled kidneys, which had been prepared by a person from Porlock who was
    the devil incarnate and who was chained up downstairs in the basement where he
    had been acting as a skivvy but today had been recklessly entrusted with cooking
    the breakfast.

    Apprised of this information, I tossed the maidservant a penny, as one might to
    a performing monkey, and proceeded with elan and steely determination down to
    the basement to confront the fiend. The sloven had spoken the truth, for there
    he was, red and horned and cloven-hooved and goaty. I was about to place his head
    in a vice and make strangely significant passing movements of my hands over him
    when something quite unprecedented happened. Nothing in all my experience, not
    even when I was serving overseas in the tropics and was regularly subject to all
    sorts of weird and mind-numbing doo-dah, was anything like this.

    One moment I was taking a quick bite out of a bloater from my pocket preparatory
    to manoeuvring the vice into position, the next I was chained and red and horned
    and cloven-hooved and goaty and gazing back at... myself. I, or he, had not even
    swallowed the mouthful of bloater. Somehow the person from Porlock, the devil
    incarnate, had exchanged bodies with me, in an instant. I watched in horror as
    he proceeded up the stairs with elan and steely determination, bent on who knows
    what maleficent purpose. I rattled my chains and wept.

    Thus far, I have nothing further to report. So loud does the steam hiss through
    the pipes in this basement kitchen that I cannot hear anything of what is transpiring
    upstairs. I must wait for Baines, I do not know for how long. My only solace is
    that the length of my chain is sufficient to allow me unhindered access to the
    pantry, where there are handsome supplies of kedgeree and bloaters and raw liver.'
