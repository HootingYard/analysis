  text: 'Well, this is exciting! Today I received in the post a personal letter from
    "one of the greatest clairvoyants in France and throughout the world", David Phild!
    You know, David Phild, Clairvoyance, Numerology, Astrology, Medium, Magical Sciences
    and Remedial Magnetism! And he has written to me with the thrilling news that
    all good things will come to me in 2012. Just consider this:

    All January--General improvement

    18 February--Enormous Money Win

    In March--An encounter with love

    All April--Lucky at gambling

    One day in May--Huge success

    In June--Luxury travel

    July--A loved one returns

    19 August--Big secret revealed

    September--Colossal inheritance

    October--Good health confirmed

    November--Your luxury home

    24 December--12 Sumptuous Gifts

    David''s letter was obviously delayed in the post by those scallywags at the Royal
    Mail, which explains why the predictions for the first quarter of the year didn''t
    come to pass. There is a very simple reason, which is, as David says, "Important!
    You will not succeed without your Celestial Owl. Ask for it immediately." I am
    going to ask for my owl as soon as I have finished writing this, so at least the
    rest of the year will go according to plan.

    What I like about David is that he does not raise false hopes. He takes pains
    to point out that by asking for the Owl of Celestial Protection I will not actually
    receive a real bird in the post. No, what I get will be more valuable than that--a
    medallion!

    This Magnificent Golden Talisman of Great Value has Recognised powers of Protection
    from evil spells, from misfortune and from health problems.

    The engraving and the consistency of your medallion make it one of the most powerful
    protection domes. It is recognised as fabulous by the greatest Grand Sages and
    Mediums in the World.

    The catalysis of the golden metal and the structure of your skin will generate
    a variety of beneficial waves that will be your rampart against evil. Some vibrations
    extinguish witches'' spells as well as spite and bad rumours and tittle-tattle
    against you.

    The very composition of the medallion provokes a type of recuperative energy that
    prevents you from wasting money and having to pay out amounts pointlessly that
    gradually plunge you into ruin. Under the protection of the Talisman, you will
    see that a single pound will enable you, under certain conditions, to live for
    as long as if you owned one hundred pounds.

    The Owl can also reactivate your energy and your drive by inundating your cells
    with a redeeming force of renewal. You will be able to feel better, faster, and
    for longer, without any medical treatment.

    Who wouldn''t want an owl like that?

    David''s letter warns me that "what I am doing for you must remain our secret",
    so very cleverly, the owl medallion is designed to look like a piece of cheap
    mass-produced tat., which clearly it is not. I contacted several Grand Sages,
    using ethereal powers not dissimilar to David''s, and they all confirmed that
    the Owl of Celestial Protection is absolutely the bee''s knees in the field of
    talismanic celestial protection through the medium of embossed owl on trinket.
    "There is no more powerful owl," said one of these Grand Sages, whose name I didn''t
    quite catch, though I understand he resides on a mountain peak in a distant eastern
    realm, obscured by clouds.

    I admit to being slightly disappointed that, fantastic as the owl is, David nowhere
    states that it is anything but silent, and emits no hoots. Quite frankly, even
    though my Owl of Celestial Protection is a free gift, I would prefer one that
    hooted. I am sure the construction of a battery-powered hooting medallion cannot
    be beyond David''s wit. If he needs financial help for its development and protection,
    he can use the thirty-two pounds I am sending him, as he requests, though nominally
    this sum is to guarantee my receipt of the Sublime and Detailed Revelation of
    the 12 Major Visionary Phases. As far as I can gather the free owl doesn''t work
    without the paid-for revelation, or vice versa. Perhaps I need to clear this up
    with the Grand Sages before committing myself.

    POSTSCRIPT : I had the devil of a time trying to get in touch with the Grand Sages
    again, what with the weather and the aether and a severe case of the Blavatskys,
    so in desperation I turned to Het Internet. It made for interesting reading, not
    least in demonstrating just how selfless "dear David" is. While he is offering
    me a free owl which will protect me against "spite and bad rumours and tittle-tattle",
    there is little else about him on the interweb except spite and bad rumours and
    tittle-tattle, much of it quite vicious. The man is sorely in need of his own
    owl, with or without battery-driven hooting. Indeed, I am so appalled at the contempt
    in which he is held, I have a good mind, as soon as I receive my owl in the post,
    to send it back to him, that he may be celestially protected from the brickbats
    of the spiteful hordes.

    In the meantime, I have set to work on the design and production of a Hooting
    Yard Owl Medallion. Clutch it to your bosom, and you will be granted the power
    to scamper up mountainsides and shimmy up flagpoles and disport yourself in other
    high places, there to crow your unstinting devotion to Mr Key from dawn till dusk,
    and from dusk till dawn. Await your personalised letter, offering you this fabulous
    owl entirely free of charge except for the charge that has to be levied on the
    advice of Mr Key''s bank manager.'
