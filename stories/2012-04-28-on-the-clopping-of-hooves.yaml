  text: "Ned! Ned! Prick up your ears, for you must listen out for the sound of clopping\
    \ hooves! It is a sound that betokens the coming of the preacher man astride his\
    \ horse. The horse has been shod with iron horseshoes by the fat florid farrier\
    \ at the fearsome fiery forge. While he waited for his horse to be shod the preacher\
    \ man stood by the horse trough in the market square, preaching. He preached of\
    \ a sulphurous vision of times to come, and the villagers trembled. Then the farrier's\
    \ urchin came running to tell him his horse was duly shod, and the preacher man\
    \ stalked off to the farrier and paid him for his labour and mounted his horse\
    \ and came a-clopping along the high ridge, silhouetted against the darkening\
    \ sky. As night fell, he dismounted from his horse and tied it with a halter to\
    \ a sturdy tree trunk by a brook, and he unrolled upon the ground his sleeping\
    \ bag, a secondhand sleeping bag that once had belonged to an Antarctic explorer.\
    \ Then the preacher man dipped his tin cup into the brook and gave water to his\
    \ horse, and dipped the tin cup again and drank it off, and then he made a fire\
    \ using gathered sticks and kindling. The moon looked down upon him, and he looked\
    \ up at the moon. He shook his fist at it, but shouted no imprecations, for he\
    \ did not wish to cause his horse alarm. The horse was timid.\nNed is tucked up\
    \ in a makeshift bed on the balcony. The stillness of the night is punctuated\
    \ by the hacking of his cough. Ned is tubercular, hence the balcony. His parents\
    \ had not the means to send him to a high and healthful Alpine sanitarium, but\
    \ their simple home has a balcony, so that is where they put him. Out there, he\
    \ will be the first to hear the clopping hooves of the preacher man's horse, when\
    \ at last he comes a-calling. In the fug of their parlour below stairs Ned's parents\
    \ huddle around their radio, listening to dance tunes by Xavier Cugat & His Orchestra,\
    \ and to strange buzzes and whistles and hisses and hums and crackles which interrupt\
    \ the broadcast now and then, as if some alien intelligence far away in the boundless\
    \ firmament is trying to communicate with them. There is a fire in the grate,\
    \ made with gathered sticks and kindling, and it crackles like the radio.\nThe\
    \ preacher man tied a nosebag filled with feed to his horse, and then he squatted\
    \ by the fire and plucked from the griddle balanced over it the sausages he had\
    \ cooked for his supper. As he chewed, the stars twinkled in the black sky. He\
    \ could not bear to look up at them. He stared instead into the fire, and saw\
    \ imps and demons dancing, and souls in torment. The horse shuddered, and kicked\
    \ the sturdy tree trunk, but weakly. The preacher man had rescued it from the\
    \ knackers yard, paying a pittance to the knackerman. He had yet to give the horse\
    \ a name. In a pocket of his preacher's black suit, as black as the sky, he had\
    \ a list of the names of racehorses. He would pick one, all in good time, for\
    \ this horse, if it lived. Musing over the names of racehorses was sinful, but\
    \ like all men, he was a sinner. There was gristle in his sausages.\nIn the bed\
    \ upon the balcony, Ned, his ears pricked up to hear the clopping of hooves, should\
    \ they come clopping, cannot stir. He is tied to the bed with bindings. His parents\
    \ had listened to a radio programme in which Bl\xF6tzmann propounded his views\
    \ on the treatment of the tubercular. Several parts of it had been inaudible due\
    \ to buzzes and whistles and hisses and hums and crackles, and they had pieced\
    \ together afterwards what they understood. Balcony air, plenty of milk, and binding\
    \ to the bed. Ned hears nothing but the racking of his cough and the howling of\
    \ distant wolves. He stares up at the stars, and gives them names. In one of his\
    \ pyjama pockets he has a list of the names of racehorses, a list he has committed\
    \ to memory, and he passes his tubercular time allotting the names to the stars\
    \ in the sky.\nMorning came, and the preacher man kicked the embers of the fire\
    \ and smeared his face with the ashes. Birds were twittering in the trees, and\
    \ he cursed them. He had specific sets of curses for different types of birds,\
    \ and he knew all their songs, he had learnt them long ago at his mother's knee.\
    \ He cursed his mother too. He pictured her in her cell at the lunatic asylum,\
    \ perched on an Alpine slope. She would greet the morning with her own demented\
    \ song. He was thankful he no longer had to hear it. The horse was still asleep.\
    \ The preacher man pissed into the brook. He fought a craving to eat an eel for\
    \ breakfast. He awoke his horse and mounted it and set it a-clopping with a kick.\n\
    As dawn comes, Ned falls asleep, bound to his balcony bed. Below, his parents\
    \ tend to their cows and their poultry. They keep their eyes peeled for the postman.\
    \ They are expecting a parcel.\nOutshone by the sun, the stars were no longer\
    \ visible, so the preacher man could gaze up at the heavens without fear. His\
    \ horse clopped along, back on the high ridge, out of the valley.\nNed's head\
    \ is awash with dreams. He dreams of cows and poultry and racehorses, all horribly\
    \ intermingled, cows with chicken heads and racehorses with beaks and feathers\
    \ and chickens that snort like racehorses. Stars burst and explode, birds sing,\
    \ and alien beings from far in the boundless firmament buzz and whistle and hiss\
    \ and hum and crackle. And there comes a sound of the clopping of hooves, at first\
    \ very quiet, as if from afar, but it grows louder and louder, closer and closer,\
    \ and Ned wakes from his dreams, and still he hears the clopping of hooves, and\
    \ he rises as far as he can from his makeshift bed and weakly he calls to his\
    \ parents below, \u201CMa! Pa! I hear the clopping of hooves! The preacher man\
    \ is come!\u201D and the effort of calling makes him cough and cough, and he collapses\
    \ back on the bed on the balcony, thin and frail and tubercular. But his parents\
    \ do not hear him, for they have spotted the postman, in his little red van, chugging\
    \ along the lonely road below, and they run down the hill to wave him to a halt.\n\
    Up on the bridge, the preacher man's horse, exhausted, collapsed beneath him.\n\
    The birds fall silent. The radio crackles. Ned coughs.\nThere is no parcel from\
    \ the postman today."
