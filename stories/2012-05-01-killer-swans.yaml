  text: 'With my ornithologist''s hat on, I keep telling you that swans are savage,
    murderous, semi-aquatic monsters. Now, with thanks to reader Dan Fuchs, unassailable
    evidence that I have been right all along...

    A man whose job was to maintain and care for the swans at a suburban condominium
    complex in Des Plaines, Illinois was killed yesterday in what appears to have
    been a freak attack by one or more of the birds.

    Nothing freakish about it, when, like me, you know what you''re dealing with...
    feathered fiends!
