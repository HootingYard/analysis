  text: "With my ornithologist's hat on, I keep telling you that swans are savage,\
    \ murderous, semi-aquatic monsters. Now, with thanks to reader Dan Fuchs, unassailable\
    \ evidence that I have been right all along\u2026\nA man whose job was to maintain\
    \ and care for the swans at a suburban condominium complex in Des Plaines, Illinois\
    \ was killed yesterday in what appears to have been a freak attack by one or more\
    \ of the birds.\nNothing freakish about it, when, like me, you know what you're\
    \ dealing with\u2026 feathered fiends!\n"
