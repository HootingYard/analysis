  text: 'In a comment on yesterday''s piece of Hoonery, Banished To A Pompous Land
    pleaded for the resurrection of a story which has--unaccountably--never been reissued
    since its original appearance in the Massacre anthology published by Indelible
    Inc twenty years ago. Here, then, in several parts over the next few days, is
    Accidental Deaths Of Twelve Cartographers, No. 8 : Ken Buttercase. Please note
    that Nos. 1-7 and 9-12 were never written. With some misgivings, I have transcribed
    it exactly, resisting the temptation to mop up certain infelicities.

    The parents of the great cartographer Ken Buttercase were employed by a small
    railway in a remote country. They lived in a wooden hut which served as a signal-box.
    A threadbare curtain of rep divided the hut into two halves. In one half, the
    Buttercases ate and slept and baked and washed; the other half contained the signalling
    controls and was also used to store an ever-changing collection of broken locomotive
    machinery. Once a day, at noon or thereabouts, a cart would trundle to the door
    of the hut; two railway workers would deliver some broken bits and pieces and
    take others away. Mr or Mrs Buttercase would sign one chit for the deliveries,
    another chit for the pieces removed, and help the two officials--one of whom was
    tubercular--to load and offload the invariably rusty pieces of metal.

    Their duties left them little time to devote to their only child. Let us examine
    these duties in some detail. The railway itself was not busy--the one train passed
    the hut four times a day; heading north at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m., and heading south
    at 10 a.m. and 10.15 p.m. Before its passing, the signals had to be set; the cranks,
    winches, levers, pulleys, knobs, fulcra, and transistor motors all had to be adjusted
    with frightening precision. In order for this to be done, the broken locomotive-parts
    had to be shoved out of the way, into the other half of the hut. They could not
    be kept outside, exposed to the elements, as the company regulations forbade such
    a practice. Nor could they be stored permanently on the other side of the rep
    curtain, as not only was this--as we have seen--the family''s living quarters,
    it also served as the work-room devoted to carrying out the many other tasks they
    had to perform, which we shall examine in due course. Once all the broken stuff
    had been moved out of the way, the signalling equipment could be set. Readjustment,
    back to the original coordinates, took place once the train had passed, after
    which the day''s conglomeration of broken bits and pieces could be shifted back
    to the other half of the hut.

    There was a great deal of paperwork. Buttercase''s parents carried this out at
    the tiny wooden escritoire next to the oven. Every day an inventory had to be
    taken of the heteroclite jumble of rubbish cluttered on the other side of the
    curtain. The railway provided pre-printed forms to be completed for each item,
    in the form of a questionnaire, detailing such things as time of delivery (to
    the minute), exact dimensions, percentage of surface area covered in rust, visual
    evidence of sabotage, signs of unlawful hammering, pounding, twisting, or breakage,
    and so on. The forms had to be handed over to the officers on their daily visit,
    whether or not they removed the piece in question. Multiple forms were therefore
    necessary if a piece remained in storage for more than twenty-four hours; but
    this was rare. Mrs Buttercase usually wrote the details out in rough, then her
    husband copied the information on to the form in his best handwriting, which was
    rarely neat enough for the officers, particularly the tubercular one, who lambasted
    Mr Buttercase accordingly.

    There were other forms to be completed. It was necessary to count the number of
    passengers aboard the train each time it passed. It trundled along reasonably
    slowly, which helped--but the windows were filthy with grease, which made it imperative
    to peer with great concentration. The accuracy of the figures could always be
    checked by comparing the Buttercases'' calculation with that made at the next
    hut along the line, although this was rarely if ever done, and it could always
    be argued that passengers had leaped or fallen off, or jumped aboard, between
    the signal-box and the next hut, not that this was likely, as hardly any passengers
    ever used the railway anyway. The passenger-count forms were collected on a monthly
    basis by another, more important, railway official, who wore a tall hat like a
    funeral director''s and arrived at the hut astride a gigantic horse. When he called,
    the Buttercases had to feed both the man and his steed with buns and glucose syrup.

    Other duties included buffing up ceremonial shields and brasswork, making flags
    and pennants, procuring rainwater, cooking sausages for the company hound, sharpening
    the pencil-sharpener, cleaning the rails, slaughtering insects which trespassed
    on the railway, keeping the paintwork up to scratch, dismantling the signals on
    public holidays, and carting huge amounts of sand and grit from one side of the
    track to the other.

    Little Ken was bidden to undertake only one task. Every day a small amount of
    paraffin had to be collected from the Paraffin Shed, which was four hours'' walk
    away across the desolate, bandit-strewn moors. He would leave mid-morning, carrying
    a special tub on his back, supporting it with ropes crossed over his shoulders
    and under his arms. His parents gave him a flask of turnip soup for sustenance
    along the way. The bandits of that country were fierce and ruthless, but they
    were unforgiveably careless, and had little idea of how to conduct an ambuscade.
    Buttercase was always able to spot them long before they would have been able
    to waylay him, and he took the necessary precautions. Sometimes he would hide
    behind a stone until they went away. Or he would wait for them to set upon a less
    observant traveller--perhaps a pedlar or minstrel--and then dash swiftly past
    while they were otherwise engaged. His other alternative was to make long detours,
    which he often did, approaching the Paraffin Shed by a bewildering variety of
    different routes. Was it this early familiarity with the highways and by-ways
    of his homeland which stirred his first cartographic impulses?
