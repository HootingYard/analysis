  text: "Part One is here\_: now read on \u2026\nThe Paraffin Shed was the smallest\
    \ of a cluster of buildings, far from the railway itself but owned nevertheless\
    \ by the company, which charged pitiful rents to the tenants. Among the other\
    \ buildings were a tavern, an ink factory, a menagerie, a cork shop, an igloo,\
    \ a massive, empty prison, and a warehouse full of bones. The Paraffin Shed was\
    \ rented by a retired sea-captain, whose name is unfortunately not recorded. In\
    \ later years, Buttercase remembered him as by turns gruff and amiable, languid\
    \ and crusty, corrosive and vibrant, insensible and bereft. Although it may be\
    \ thought that he spent long hours entertaining his small visitor with seafaring\
    \ yarns, tales of exploration and derring-do upon the high seas, rattling narratives\
    \ of piracy and bilgewater, there is no evidence that he ever did so. As far as\
    \ we know, all that ever took place was that, upon Buttercase's arrival, the boy\
    \ unhitched the tub from his back, unscrewed the stopper, the sea-captain poured\
    \ a paltry amount of paraffin into it, demanded his money and held out his vast\
    \ and hairy hand for receipt of the coins, whereupon the lad paid him, replaced\
    \ the stopper, hitched the refilled tub on to his back, bid the old salt farewell\
    \ until the morrow, and began the long trudge back towards his parents\u2019 hut.\n\
    Did he ever visit any of the other buildings? He may have done. What would have\
    \ happened had he encountered, in the warehouse of bones, a slobbering giant wracked\
    \ with the dropsy? Or blundered into the menagerie and come face to face with\
    \ a starving bison? Or been lured into the ink factory and had his tub of paraffin\
    \ stolen from him by the snag-toothed serf detailed to stand guard at the door,\
    \ his mouth forever filled with sticky, raspberry-flavoured confections, the juice\
    \ of which dribbled down his chin and fell in droplets upon his outlandish pantaloons?\
    \ What turn might have been taken in the life of the cartographer-to-be had these\
    \ things happened? There is rich material here, but we must turn our backs upon\
    \ it, and follow the young Buttercase back to the rep-divided hut, to which, daily,\
    \ he returns, as twilight descends upon the land, and howls are heard far off\
    \ in the distance, or perhaps the occasional spurt of gunfire, or a hoot from\
    \ the rickety train, trundling on its way, with or without passengers, with or\
    \ without freight.\nHe was sixteen years old when he was flung into prison, and\
    \ twenty when he was released on a special licence, having been recommended by\
    \ the prison governor to accompany an Antarctic expedition as general factotum,\
    \ accordionist, and toothbrush maker. Up to the very minute the steamship Indescribable\
    \ chugged out of the harbour, Buttercase was handcuffed to a prison guard. The\
    \ two had become fast friends during the seven-week journey from the prison to\
    \ the small seaside town from which the expedition sailed. Clump, the guard, was\
    \ a small, flickering man who drew maps in his spare time. Never having set foot\
    \ outside his homeland, his exquisitely illuminated maps of Far Cathay, Beach,\
    \ Zimpagu, Hoon, and Yssicol were the products of a fevered imagination all too\
    \ rare in men of his profession. Buttercase, of course, was awestruck. He repeatedly\
    \ badgered Clump to make him a gift of one of his maps, but the prison guard refused\
    \ for reasons we can only guess at. Not that we will bother.\nAs they made their\
    \ way on foot across the country for forty-nine days of that abominable winter,\
    \ Clump nevertheless gave Buttercase a far more valuable gift\u2014a pencil. It\
    \ must not be forgotten that in those days, convicted felons\u2014especially those\
    \ released on licence\u2014were routinely deprived of pencils, as they were of\
    \ pencil-sharpeners, pencil-cases, pens, protractors, rulers, compasses, crayons,\
    \ set-squares, and many other items of stationery and graphic equipment. The king\
    \ himself had renewed the ban in the very year of Buttercase's release. Clump\
    \ was taking a terrible risk. Perhaps he was in his cups when he hastily shoved\
    \ the pencil into Buttercase's pocket. The great cartographer later recalled that\
    \ the prison guard had tears in his eyes as he did so.\nOn the deck of the Indescribable,\
    \ Clump removed the handcuffs from his young charge's puny wrist. The two embraced.\
    \ Doughty explorers, some already kitted out in their Antarctic furs, bustled\
    \ Clump off the ship; they were impatient for Buttercase to begin his accordion\
    \ lessons. Prisoner and guard never saw each other again. Clump came to a bad\
    \ end. On his return to the prison, he had his pencils counted, and his furious\
    \ blushes confirmed the governor's suspicions. Dismissed from the service, he\
    \ fell on evil days, and died two years later, drunk out of his brain on the floor\
    \ of a post office in Tantarabim.\nTo be continued \u2026\n[NOTE\_: Clump is the\
    \ first, but by no means the last Hooting Yard character to meet his end drunk\
    \ out of his brain on the floor of a post office. The same fate befalls a music\
    \ critic in The Phlogiston Variations, I think, and quite possibly one or two\
    \ others. This was also the first appearance in my work of that realm of mystery\
    \ known as Tantarabim.]"
