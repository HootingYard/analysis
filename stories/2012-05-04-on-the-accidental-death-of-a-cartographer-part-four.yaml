  text: "Parts One, Two, and Three. And now, Part Four \u2026\nButtercase's map of\
    \ Sumatra was his first and, arguably, finest cartographic achievement. Having\
    \ abandoned his shipmates, his first step was to enter the general store in Blimbing,\
    \ and, using the small sum of cash he had stolen from the purser's hatbox, he\
    \ bought a knapsack, some cakes, a compass, a shirt, a fetching little hat, a\
    \ jar containing a substance no longer obtainable on earth, although it was quite\
    \ common at the time, a guide-book, some clips, a lead-lined smock, and a windjammer,\
    \ among other things. Then he set out on foot to cover the whole island. It took\
    \ him five years. He began by keeping to the coastal routes, tramping from Blimbing\
    \ all the way up to Oleleh, then along the eastern coast, through Edi, Balei,\
    \ and Rupat until, once past Telok Betong, he returned to his starting-point.\
    \ He took the opportunity to call in to the general store and have his clips de-rusted\
    \ and his hat stitched. Then he headed off into the interior, zigzagging his way\
    \ nor'east, nor'west, nor'east, nor'west, until he reached Segli. All this time\
    \ he had been taking copious notes, and he was now ready to begin work on his\
    \ map. He returned to Blimbing on a motorbike and holed up in a shack. Sustained\
    \ by Rumanian beans and hooch, he worked for a further two years, using an enormous\
    \ sheet of Waterbath paper and a collection of coloured pencils. A stupendously\
    \ detailed description of the map appears in Crone's Anthology Of Sumatran Maps\
    \ Concocted By Felons (Hooting Yard Press, 1937), to which the reader is referred.\n\
    But that's quite enough about maps for the time being. Of more interest is the\
    \ fact that at around this time Buttercase fell in with a gang of ne'er-do-wells\
    \ who haunted the more disgusting sinks of vice and iniquity in Blimbing and,\
    \ when it was learned that he was an accomplished accordionist, he was invited\
    \ to join their jazz band. The band was led by the scrofulous but benign cornettist\
    \ Lip Suk Jab, a Korean who had been hounded out of his country following the\
    \ infamous Unserrated Postage Stamp Scandal of 1922. Suk Jab's musical gifts were\
    \ slight, but what he lacked in technique he made up for with what can only be\
    \ described as stage presence. Slightly less than five-feet tall and impossibly\
    \ rotund, he held audiences in thrall. Several critics have attempted to explain\
    \ precisely what it was about the man that was so spellbinding. Was it his occasional\
    \ impersonations of Constantin Brancusi or Cicely Courtneidge? Was it the metal\
    \ harness he strapped to his head which emitted incandescent light? Was it the\
    \ pocketfuls of custard triangles with which he showered the audience at the end\
    \ of each show? Who can say? What we do know is that, when his regular accordionist\
    \ was drowned in a freak dandelion-hammering accident, he cajoled Buttercase into\
    \ joining his band.\nThe next thirty years passed in a whirl. Cartography was\
    \ all but forgotten as Suk Jab's band\u2014known variously as The Crumpled Ships,\
    \ The Amnesiac Lane Octet, Lip Suk Jab And His Big Aluminium Kettle, Shimmying\
    \ In Ponds, The Norwegian Hooters, or Go Wild With Lip Suk Jab And The Mullet\
    \ Babies\u2014toured endlessly through Sumatra, Java, Borneo, New Guinea, Timor,\
    \ and the Yukon. There were shows virtually every night of the week, in hotels,\
    \ dancehalls, casinos, scout-huts, community centres, bingo parlours, caves, factories,\
    \ deserted mineshafts, and temples. Lacquered gits clutching recording contracts\
    \ followed the band everywhere. Broadcasters from the burgeoning Dutch East Indies\
    \ Radio Corporation were forever dragging the band into studios. Buttercase took\
    \ up the bassoon and the ondes martenot in addition to his favoured accordion,\
    \ although he was never able to play either of them with much conviction.\nThis\
    \ idyll ended on 14th January 1959, when disaster struck. The band, billed as\
    \ The Authentic Sound Of Geriatric Slobbering, were booked to play at the Fop\
    \ Palace, a nightclub in Selwyn, hard by the banks of the Macmillan, which had\
    \ become the in place to be for the local population of trappers, Mounties, card-sharps,\
    \ detectives, rustlers, and circus performers. The journey from Borneo had been\
    \ exhausting, and half the band had contracted dengue fever. Lip Suk Jab himself\
    \ was under investigation by the Javan Secret Police following his involvement\
    \ in a stamp collecting scam, and had become convinced\u2014rightly\u2014that\
    \ agents pursued him at every step. Indeed, on the night in question, eleven Javan\
    \ plainclothesmen were loitering in the snug bar at the Fop Palace, ready to make\
    \ an arrest. As if this were not trouble enough, Buttercase's accordion had been\
    \ sabotaged by thugs employed by a rival Sumatran jazz combo; as soon as he played\
    \ an F sharp, explosives secreted within the instrument would detonate, blasting\
    \ the accordion, its player, and anyone and anything else within a five-hundred\
    \ yard radius to smithereens.\nBy quarter to midnight, when the band were due\
    \ to begin their set, the Palace was packed. The Javans, skilfully disguised as\
    \ a group of Lithuanian business executives, had fanned out from the snug and\
    \ taken up strategic positions around the stage and at the exits. Never one to\
    \ tolerate sickness, Lip Suk Jab had summarily dismissed the dengue-stricken members\
    \ of the group and was busy rehearsing four locals in a back room. None of the\
    \ callow Yukon youths had ever played a musical instrument before, but so awe-inspiring\
    \ was Suk Jab's tuition that, by the time the lights went down, Biff, Skip, Chump,\
    \ and Dib felt confident enough to attempt the banjo, tuba, sackbut, and kettledrums\
    \ respectively. The locals gave them a rousing cheer, which was only slightly\
    \ muted when they were followed on stage by Buttercase and the other two long-serving\
    \ band members, whose names we may learn later. The seven of them started to bash\
    \ out a scorching opener designed to set the scene for the arrival of their leader.\
    \ You will be pleased to learn that Buttercase played the bassoon on this number.\
    \ The deadly accordion rested behind him on a rather intriguing stool, carved\
    \ entirely from the tusk of a narwhal and engraved with scenes of piracy and racketeering.\
    \ He had received this piece of scrimshandy from a Bolton mustard merchant after\
    \ a concert in Wetter in 1946.\nTowards the end of the number, Lip Suk Jab made\
    \ his way towards the stage. As he paused to screw the last bolt into his incandescent\
    \ metal head-harness, four of the Javans pounced. Before he knew what had hit\
    \ him, the cornettist was gagged, handcuffed, and frogmarched out by a side exit\
    \ into the wintry Selwyn night. The rest of the Javan detectives joined them,\
    \ and they hurried down to the banks of the Macmillan, which was of course entirely\
    \ frozen over. Hastily lacing up their ice-skates, and muttering incomprehensible\
    \ messages into their walkie-talkies, the agents careered across the river at\
    \ breakneck speed, narrowly avoiding bashing Lip Suk Jab's head into an ice-trapped\
    \ tugboat in midstream. Once they had made it to the other side, they put the\
    \ cornettist back on his feet and, having removed their skates, ordered him to\
    \ march with them four miles to the airfield where their bi-plane was waiting.\
    \ As they set off, midnight struck.\nTo be continued \u2026"
