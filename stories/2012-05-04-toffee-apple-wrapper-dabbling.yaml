  This week in my cupboard at The Dabbler, a memoir of the toffee apple wrappers of
  my childhood. Is it a true memory, or have I just made it up? And will you ever
  know? These are by no means important questions, and yet you may find them niggling
  away at you as the day goes on, and the night, and the following day, and the following
  night, until you are driven to distraction, desperate to know the answers once and
  for all, yet remaining forever in doubt.
