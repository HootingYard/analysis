  text: "Although I have been described as a Diogenesian recluse, I have been out\
    \ and about a few times recently, first to look at tiles, then to perform with\
    \ Lepke B. at the Resonance104.4FM tenth birthday party, and, last night to the\
    \ opening of an exhibition\u2014Jane Colling's A to Z screenprints at Woolfson\
    \ & Tay. I thoroughly recommend this to all London-based Hooting Yardists, and\
    \ indeed non-Londoners, who can fly in from around the globe.\nRepresenting a\
    \ quarter century of work, the twenty-six prints take us through the alphabet\
    \ from \u201CAfter Armageddon Ambivalent Ape Attests Ark's Arrival. Animals Amble\
    \ Ashore, Approaching Apricot Arbour As Arcane Arm Allows Adam An Apple. Archeopteryx\

    \ the captions were recited by Peter Blegvad and Sarah Reilly, standing behind\
    \ alphabetically decorated podia. The exhibition runs until 27 May, so hie thee\
    \ hence!\n"
