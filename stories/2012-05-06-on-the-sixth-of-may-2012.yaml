  text: 'Over the past seven days I have been posting pieces written in the twentieth
    century, so I feel I have had a week off from the Daily Essays project. Time,
    I think, to get back on board, and indeed to remind myself of the perpilocutionary
    impulse that pinged in my head at the start of the year. Then, the idea was very
    much to pluck a topic almost at random from the world''s storehouse of topics,
    and to bash out around a thousand words. As it has worked out, I have been pootling
    off in all sorts of other directions, and all that conceivably holds the year''s
    postages together is that (a) they are all roughly one thousand words in length,
    and (b) their titles all begin with the word "On".

    On Sunday the sixth of May, in the early afternoon, I find myself thinking of
    the following: Nikita Khrushchev, Kew. Rhone., mountaineering, and an ideal world
    where a jazz standard called Chutney On My Spats really does exist. I imagine
    it as an up-tempo Cab Calloway number, later adapted and slowed down and made
    beautiful and strange by Thelonius Monk or Miles Davis, and then, with added words--but
    what words?--being sung in arrangements by Dinah Washington or Sarah Vaughan.
    I don''t know much about jazz, so that last sentence is a pretty good example
    of perpilocution.

    I am keen to stress, though I am not sure why, that those really are the topics
    bustling about in my brain this afternoon. It would have been easy enough for
    me to compile a quite different list, to pretend I was thinking about w and x
    and y and z, and you would never know. But what would be the point? Today, for
    reasons which are fairly clear to me, but which I will not go into here, the four
    topics I have listed are uppermost in my mind. What I suppose I ought to do is
    to pick one and then write about it, for a thousand words or so. But before doing
    that, I am reminded of a passage, somewhere in an essay by Nicholson Baker, where
    he tabulates the subjects he has been thinking about on a particular day. It is
    a long, long time since I read the essay, but if memory serves Mr Baker''s point
    is that his list of thoughts will be arrestingly different from the list of thoughts
    that, on the same day, go through the head of the person closest to him, in all
    ways, his wife--and that their closeness, their attachment to each other, is unaffected
    by the wildly different jumbles of things occupying their respective brains. That,
    at least, is what I remember.

    This afternoon, as I say, I have arrived at having a head full of Nikita Khrushchev
    and Kew. Rhone. and mountaineering and Chutney On My Spats by processes I can
    clearly trace. It is, almost certainly--no, no, certainly, without doubt--the
    first time in my life that those four specific topics have jostled together inside
    my cranium. It may be the last time, too, though probably not, now that I have
    chosen to write them down, together in a list, and given that writing, that list,
    a life beyond the ephemeral, by posting it on Het Internet. Assuming that cataclysm
    does not deprive us of the power of electricity, and that international woman
    of mystery Primrose Dent does not press the big shiny red button that turns off
    Het Internet, then my list will be preserved, in the aether, forever and ever.
    One day in the far future, when we are all dead and gone and our children too
    are all dead and gone and their children too, and their children''s children,
    when untold generations have passed and humankind has evolved to that state familiar
    from any number of black and white science fiction films, where our descendants
    have huge heads and little or no hair, and they all dress in the same space age
    uniform, or in white robes, unless of course by that time they are merely brains
    in jars of bubbling fluid, with wiring attached, in that distant future it should
    still be possible for a person, or an enjarred brain, to access all the billions
    and billions of pages of Het Internet, and, while browsing in an aimless and desultory
    fashion, as I am sure they will, stumble upon Hooting Yard, quite by accident,
    and flick from page to page, from essay to essay, and alight, at last, without
    particular intention, upon this very piece, and read about Nikita Khrushchev and
    Kew. Rhone. and mountaineering and Chutney On My Spats, and thus those four separate,
    unrelated subjects, which just happen to be occupying my mind this afternoon,
    will occupy the huge pulsating advanced mind of the person or brain of the distant
    future, which is, I suppose, a kind of immortality.

    It is an immortality not granted to whatever collection of gubbins bubbled to
    the surface of my conscious mind yesterday afternoon, or in the afternoon of the
    day before, because I did not record it. I did not make such a list. I did not
    tabulate, as Nicholson Baker did, one day late in the twentieth century, or early
    in this, I forget which. He made his list to demonstrate the distance, the distinctness,
    of his thoughts, from the thoughts of his closest companion. I made my list to
    contemplate my closeness to an unimaginable consciousness of an unimaginably distant
    future. My future reader--let''s call him, or her, or, by then quite possibly,
    it, Zagzob, or some such science fiction name--may have absolutely no idea who
    Nikita Khrushchev was, nor what Kew. Rhone. was, nor indeed have any concept of
    "mountaineering" as we do. After all, what with geological time, all the mountains
    might have been flattened, or Zagzob might be living in some kind of clean and
    gleaming artificial subterranean utopia, or, if there are still mountains, nobody
    will bother to climb them any more, having other leisure pursuits and adventuresome
    opportunities, ones we cannot even begin to guess at with our primitive mental
    blinkers. Zagzob will surely be utterly befuddled by Chutney On My Spats which,
    though I might dream, does not exist, and never has.

    Although, of course, between now, the afternoon of the sixth of May 2012, and
    the afternoon in the far distant future when Zagzob reads these words, some jazz
    person of the future might indeed write the piece, and record it, and over the
    years it may be rerecorded untold times, in all sorts of arrangements and adaptations
    and versions, until it is considered a standard. It may even be that, as Zagzob
    scratches his or her or its gigantic pulsating hairless cranium in perplexity,
    wondering what a Nikita Khrushchev was, or who Kew. Rhone. was, or precisely how
    one might go about mountaineering, he or her or it, being a jazz buff, might be
    humming Chutney On My Spats, or indeed playing a version of it on their future
    Windows Vista Cranial Insertion Pod Hub device.

    I find myself wondering if that is an accurate prediction of the far distant future,
    and hoping that it is so. Perhaps a science fiction writer can iron out the finer
    details.'
