  text: 'Sound advice from Richard Carter :

    having a pair of owls in your bathroom could help avoid potential embarrassment
    when you have guests.

    As he says,

    wouldn''t it be utterly awesome to keep a couple of owls in your bathroom, just
    to impress visitors?


    Meanwhile, over at Wonders & Marvels, monkeys at war!

    Who were the first monkeys to see action in war? Before the invention of gun powder
    fire-arms in China (ca 13th century), a 9th century Chinese chronicle ("Yu-yang-tsah-tsu"
    by Twan Ching-Shih) describes annual battles between soldiers of Po-mi-lan and
    300,000 giant rock-throwing apes who came down from the high craggy mountains
    of the west to ravage crops every spring.'
