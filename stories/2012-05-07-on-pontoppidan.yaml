  text: 'Like absolutely everybody else throughout the land--with the sole exception
    of Nige--I have become enamoured of Scandinavian crime fiction. That is why, the
    other day, I picked up a cheap paperback copy of Headhunters by Jo Nesbo and have
    read about half of it at one sitting. It rattles along. I found myself diverted
    by this passage:

    The second [thing that caught my attention] was a quotation from what are known
    informally as "Pontoppidan''s Explanations" in which he declares that a person
    is capable of killing another person''s soul, infecting it, dragging it down into
    sin in such a way that redemption is precluded.

    As soon as I felt able to tear myself away from Headhunters, about ninety pages
    later--I did say it rattles along--I made a cup of tea and devoted myself to discovering
    what I could about Pontoppidan and his Explanations. The first thing I learned
    was that no human being has ever resembled a poodle or a pompom as closely as
    Erik Pontoppidan (1698-1764).


    In the Wikipedia, he is listed in the following categories: Danish theologians,
    Danish bishops, Danish ornithologists, Danish naturalists, Norwegian bishops,
    18th-century Lutheran bishops, People from Aarhus. That gives us a reasonably
    comprehensive picture. As for the Explanations, these appear to be one of his
    most important theological works, a 1737 official state church explanation of
    the Lutheran catechism. One might think that makes for rather dry reading, but
    the part alluded to by Jo Nesbo suggests otherwise. I may have to see if there
    is an English translation available and pore over it for further references to
    murder and infection and sin and eternal damnation.

    As with so many clergymen of the era, Pontoppidan was also an enthusiastic naturalist
    and antiquarian. He compiled, in 1763-64, The Danish Atlas, a detailed and ambitious
    description of Denmark based on information gathered from clergy around the country.
    His Natural History of Norway (1752-1753), was a description not only of the flora
    and fauna of the country, but also of the peasant population, their ways of living
    and thinking, based upon close observation. It is thanks to Pontoppidan that much
    folkloric material has been preserved.

    Among his other works were a standard Danish hymn book, a guide for vicars to
    help eradicate superstition and reduce devotion to Catholic relics among the peasantry,
    a four volume history of the Danish church, and a collection of epitaphs transcribed
    from tombstones.

    Of particular interest, at least to me, is that Pontoppidan is one of the earliest
    sources for our knowledge of that ferocious sea monster, the kraken. In the Natural
    History of Norway he gives an extensive description of the beast and makes a number
    of claims, including that the kraken is so enormous it is sometimes mistaken for
    an island, and that the greatest danger to sailors comes not from the creature
    itself but from the mighty whirlpool it leaves in its wake. Not that the kraken
    does not have great destructive power, as Pontoppidan writes "It is said that
    if [the creature''s arms] were to lay hold of the largest man-of-war, they would
    pull it down to the bottom". The image of the kraken dragging a ship down to the
    bottom of the sea is startlingly similar to the image, in the Explanations, of
    the soul-murderer dragging the infected victim down into sin. One wonders what
    tormented phantasms were going on inside Pontoppidan''s head, surrounded by that
    pompom of snow-white hair and the crisp white ruff.

    [This piece is nowhere near one thousand words in length, but I think it best
    to end there, when I have nothing more to say, than to expand it needlessly by
    chuntering on. I could copy out bits of Pontoppidanery from the Wikipedia and
    from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica and from the 1914 New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopaedia
    Of Religious Knowledge (Third Edition). I could point out that, weirdly, Erik
    Pontoppidan has his own Facecloth page, which is "liked" by a total of six people.
    (I am toying with the idea of becoming the seventh.) But, short of immersing myself
    in certain of the texts, I think I have learned enough, and told you enough, about
    Pontoppidan for the time being. It is interesting to me that, just a few hours
    ago, I had never heard of him, and a stray reference led me to find out that little
    which I have found out. Now, when next I am at an elegant and sophisticated cocktail
    party, leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece in my Tyrolean jacket similar
    to that worn by Christopher Plummer in The Sound Of Music, and the conversation
    turns, as it so often does, to the subject of the kraken, I shall be able to pipe
    up with a learned reference to Erik Pontoppidan. Having grabbed the attention
    of the gathering, I can then dazzle my listeners with abstruse points of Scandinavian
    theology and amusing anecdotes of eighteenth century peasant life in Norway. I
    might even throw in a couple of Danish tombstone epitaphs for added entertainment,
    by which time every single person at the cocktail party will be hanging on my
    every word. There is every possibility that, at this point, the cry will go up,
    from one voice or from many, to "please, please tell us what Erik Pontoppidan
    looked like, Mr Key!" "Well, those of you foregathered and rapt," I will reply,
    "If you have ever seen a poodle, or a white pompom, and imagine either of those
    in human form, then you can summon in your mind''s eye a portrait of our man."
    At which point I might sashay away from the mantelpiece and pay a visit to the
    bathroom, wherein I shall liberally entalc my hair and head and collar, and then
    reappear among the party guests, a striking tableau vivant of Erik Pontoppidan.
    It will then remain for me to select a victim, murder their soul, infect it, and
    drag them down into sin, in such a way that redemption is precluded--if, of course,
    it is that kind of cocktail party.]'
