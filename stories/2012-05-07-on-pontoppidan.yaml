  text: "Like absolutely everybody else throughout the land\u2014with the sole exception\
    \ of Nige\u2014I have become enamoured of Scandinavian crime fiction. That is\
    \ why, the other day, I picked up a cheap paperback copy of Headhunters by Jo\
    \ Nesbo and have read about half of it at one sitting. It rattles along. I found\
    \ myself diverted by this passage:\nThe second [thing that caught my attention]\
    \ was a quotation from what are known informally as \u201CPontoppidan's Explanations\u201D\
    \ in which he declares that a person is capable of killing another person's soul,\
    \ infecting it, dragging it down into sin in such a way that redemption is precluded.\n\
    As soon as I felt able to tear myself away from Headhunters, about ninety pages\
    \ later\u2014I did say it rattles along\u2014I made a cup of tea and devoted myself\
    \ to discovering what I could about Pontoppidan and his Explanations. The first\
    \ thing I learned was that no human being has ever resembled a poodle or a pompom\
    \ as closely as Erik Pontoppidan (1698\u20131764).\n\nIn the Wikipedia, he is\
    \ listed in the following categories: Danish theologians, Danish bishops, Danish\
    \ ornithologists, Danish naturalists, Norwegian bishops, 18th-century Lutheran\
    \ bishops, People from Aarhus. That gives us a reasonably comprehensive picture.\
    \ As for the Explanations, these appear to be one of his most important theological\
    \ works, a 1737 official state church explanation of the Lutheran catechism. One\
    \ might think that makes for rather dry reading, but the part alluded to by Jo\
    \ Nesbo suggests otherwise. I may have to see if there is an English translation\
    \ available and pore over it for further references to murder and infection and\
    \ sin and eternal damnation.\nAs with so many clergymen of the era, Pontoppidan\
    \ was also an enthusiastic naturalist and antiquarian. He compiled, in 1763\u2013\
    64, The Danish Atlas, a detailed and ambitious description of Denmark based on\
    \ information gathered from clergy around the country. His Natural History of\
    \ Norway (1752\u20131753), was a description not only of the flora and fauna of\
    \ the country, but also of the peasant population, their ways of living and thinking,\
    \ based upon close observation. It is thanks to Pontoppidan that much folkloric\
    \ material has been preserved.\nAmong his other works were a standard Danish hymn\
    \ book, a guide for vicars to help eradicate superstition and reduce devotion\
    \ to Catholic relics among the peasantry, a four volume history of the Danish\
    \ church, and a collection of epitaphs transcribed from tombstones.\nOf particular\
    \ interest, at least to me, is that Pontoppidan is one of the earliest sources\
    \ for our knowledge of that ferocious sea monster, the kraken. In the Natural\
    \ History of Norway he gives an extensive description of the beast and makes a\
    \ number of claims, including that the kraken is so enormous it is sometimes mistaken\
    \ for an island, and that the greatest danger to sailors comes not from the creature\
    \ itself but from the mighty whirlpool it leaves in its wake. Not that the kraken\
    \ does not have great destructive power, as Pontoppidan writes \u201CIt is said\
    \ that if [the creature's arms] were to lay hold of the largest man-of-war, they\
    \ would pull it down to the bottom\u201D. The image of the kraken dragging a ship\
    \ down to the bottom of the sea is startlingly similar to the image, in the Explanations,\
    \ of the soul-murderer dragging the infected victim down into sin. One wonders\
    \ what tormented phantasms were going on inside Pontoppidan's head, surrounded\
    \ by that pompom of snow-white hair and the crisp white ruff.\n[This piece is\
    \ nowhere near one thousand words in length, but I think it best to end there,\
    \ when I have nothing more to say, than to expand it needlessly by chuntering\
    \ on. I could copy out bits of Pontoppidanery from the Wikipedia and from the\
    \ 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica and from the 1914 New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopaedia\
    \ Of Religious Knowledge (Third Edition). I could point out that, weirdly, Erik\
    \ Pontoppidan has his own Facecloth page, which is \u201Cliked\u201D by a total\
    \ of six people. (I am toying with the idea of becoming the seventh.) But, short\
    \ of immersing myself in certain of the texts, I think I have learned enough,\
    \ and told you enough, about Pontoppidan for the time being. It is interesting\
    \ to me that, just a few hours ago, I had never heard of him, and a stray reference\
    \ led me to find out that little which I have found out. Now, when next I am at\
    \ an elegant and sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly against a\
    \ mantelpiece in my Tyrolean jacket similar to that worn by Christopher Plummer\
    \ in The Sound Of Music, and the conversation turns, as it so often does, to the\
    \ subject of the kraken, I shall be able to pipe up with a learned reference to\
    \ Erik Pontoppidan. Having grabbed the attention of the gathering, I can then\
    \ dazzle my listeners with abstruse points of Scandinavian theology and amusing\
    \ anecdotes of eighteenth century peasant life in Norway. I might even throw in\
    \ a couple of Danish tombstone epitaphs for added entertainment, by which time\
    \ every single person at the cocktail party will be hanging on my every word.\
    \ There is every possibility that, at this point, the cry will go up, from one\
    \ voice or from many, to \u201Cplease, please tell us what Erik Pontoppidan looked\
    \ like, Mr Key!\u201D \u201CWell, those of you foregathered and rapt,\u201D I\
    \ will reply, \u201CIf you have ever seen a poodle, or a white pompom, and imagine\
    \ either of those in human form, then you can summon in your mind's eye a portrait\
    \ of our man.\u201D At which point I might sashay away from the mantelpiece and\
    \ pay a visit to the bathroom, wherein I shall liberally entalc my hair and head\
    \ and collar, and then reappear among the party guests, a striking tableau vivant\
    \ of Erik Pontoppidan. It will then remain for me to select a victim, murder their\
    \ soul, infect it, and drag them down into sin, in such a way that redemption\
    \ is precluded\u2014if, of course, it is that kind of cocktail party.]"
