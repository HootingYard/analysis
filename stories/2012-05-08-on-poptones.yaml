  text: "Drive to the forest in a Japanese car. When it begins to rain, and it will,\
    \ it will, turn on the windscreen wipers. They will swish swoosh swish back and\
    \ forth across the windscreen of the Japanese car, just like they do across the\
    \ windscreen of Marion Crane's car in Psycho, to ensure that, however heavy and\
    \ pelting the rain becomes, and it will pelt, it will, you will still be able\
    \ to see the road ahead clearly enough to drive, in the dark and the rain, past\
    \ Box Hill, towards the forest, in a Japanese car.\nSometimes the rain pelts down\
    \ so relentlessly that even the swishiest and swooshiest of windscreen wipers,\
    \ set to their most rapid swishing and swooshing, are barely able to wipe the\
    \ raindrops from the windscreen, so hard and fast does the rain pelt down, and\
    \ in the dark of an earthly night it can be the devil of a job to keep a clear\
    \ view of the road ahead. Such were the circumstances that led Marion Crane to\
    \ stop at the Bates Motel. Her car was not a Japanese one. She was not on her\
    \ way to the forest.\nI've got binoculars on top of Box Hill. I am protected from\
    \ the relentless pelting rain by an anorak, a sou'wester, and the roof of a bird-spotter's\
    \ hideyhole. Because my shelter is dry, more or less, and my vision is acute,\
    \ I can see clearly through the lenses of my binoculars. I would not need wipers\
    \ even were the binoculars fitted with them, which of course they are not. I have\
    \ trained my binoculars on the road below, and now you come sweeping into view,\
    \ driving to the forest in a Japanese car. I slowly adjust the angle of the binoculars\
    \ so I can follow your progress.\nIt is not clear whether there was a hill, like\
    \ Box Hill, in the vicinity of the Bates Motel, but had there been, then Arbogast\
    \ might have been stood atop it, with binoculars, watching Marion Crane pull in\
    \ and park. The private detective would have had plenty of time to scamper down\
    \ the hillside and jump into his car and rev the engine and tear across to the\
    \ Bates Motel and forestall the horror. Arbogast was not there, on some putative\
    \ hill, with binoculars. But I am.\nThe windscreen wipers of your Japanese car\
    \ are swishing and swooshing back and forth as rapidly as it is possible for them\
    \ to do, but now the relentlessness of the pelting rain redoubles, and it is almost\
    \ impossible for you to see clearly the road ahead, towards the forest. You are\
    \ driving more and more slowly, and with increasing difficulty, and a voice in\
    \ your head tells you to pull over and stop in a layby. The voice is a sober and\
    \ sensible one and not at all like the voice Norman Bates hears in his head, when\
    \ Marion Crane comes to the Bates Motel.\nThrough my binoculars, on top of Box\
    \ Hill, I can see you have pulled in to a layby and come to a stop in your Japanese\
    \ car. I tuck the binoculars into the pochette on a lanyard around my neck and\
    \ I scamper down Box Hill to where my own car is parked. It is not a Japanese\
    \ car. Its windscreen wipers are no more, nor less, efficient than yours, but\
    \ my vision is acute and I am a fantastic driver, so for me it is child's play\
    \ to rev the engine and tear across to the layby where you are parked.\nI pull\
    \ up behind your Japanese car and stop the engine and get out of my car and slam\
    \ the door shut behind me and splosh through the puddles towards your car. I am\
    \ wearing waterproof boots. I draw level with the window on the driver's side\
    \ of your Japanese car and, peering in, I am disconcerted to see that you are\
    \ not sitting in the driver's seat. Nor have you shifted to the passenger seat,\
    \ nor to either of the back seats. You are not in the car. You must have gone\
    \ somewhere on foot, through the puddles, in the dark, in the pelting rain, while\
    \ I was making my way to the layby from the top of Box Hill.\nI stand next to\
    \ your Japanese car and take the binoculars out of the pochette on a lanyard around\
    \ my neck and peer through them. So relentless is the pelting rain that I wish\
    \ O I wish I had wipers fitted to my binoculars. I cannot see a thing in any direction.\
    \ I can only assume that for some reason you have sploshed through the puddles\
    \ to the forest, the edge of which is about half a mile away. I decide to follow\
    \ you, in my waterproof boots.\nThis is ancient and dense forest and no felling\
    \ has taken place to make a clearing in which a motel might be erected. It would\
    \ not, in any case, make an apt site for a motel. A sinister house like that adjoining\
    \ the Bates Motel might be apt, were there a clearing, but there is not. So to\
    \ find you I have to seek signs, like a tracker. Soon enough, I come upon you,\
    \ squatting by a fallen log, upon which you have set a camping gaz stove. You\
    \ are preparing tea, and sausages. Along the log from the stove you have placed\
    \ a cassette player.\n\u201CHold it right there!\u201D I cry.\nYou spin around,\
    \ astonished.\n\u201CPicnic police!\u201D I cry, \u201CDon't move!\u201D\n\u201C\
    Dammit!\u201D you mutter.\nThere are some people who praise picnicking in the\
    \ British countryside. I do whatever it takes to eradicate it. I place you under\
    \ arrest. The cassette plays poptones."
