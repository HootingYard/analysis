  text: "What is it with these clergymen and their phantasms? The other day we had\
    \ the Bishop of Bergen, Erik Pontoppidan, babbling on about sea monsters, and\
    \ now we find that rustic Victorian, the Reverend Francis Kilvert, writing in\
    \ his diary, on this day in 1872:\nThis morning I conceived the idea of a poem\
    \ in the style of Tam o\u2019 Shanter\u2014the scene to be laid in the ruined\
    \ church of Llanbedr Painscastle. Two lovers who had made an assignation in the\
    \ church-yard to be terrified by seeing through the windows an assembly of devils,\
    \ ghosts, lawless lovers and murdered children.\nUntil I read that, I thought\
    \ Kilvert's Diary was akin to Gilbert White's Natural History Of Selborne, a series\
    \ of observations on rural life and the natural world, gentle and rather winsome.\
    \ I did not expect lawless lovers and murdered children in ruined churches. But\
    \ then, I have never read Kilvert's Diary, and came upon the above entry in The\
    \ Assassin's Cloak\_: An Anthology Of The World's Greatest Diarists, edited by\
    \ Irene and Alan Taylor (2000).\nSince 1977, Peter Blegvad has had an ongoing\
    \ project called \u201CImagined, Observed, Remembered\u201D, best summarised by\
    \ Mr B. himself:\nI began drawing sundry items thrice\u2014first as I imagined\
    \ them to be, then as I actually observed them to be, and lastly, after a suitable\
    \ interval, as I remembered them to have been.\nIt occurred to me that I could\
    \ apply this idea\u2014at least, the Imagined and Observed elements\u2014in prose\
    \ rather than drawings, to the Reverend Kilvert. After all, though I have never\
    \ read the diary, I have heard of it. Where or when it first swam into my ken\
    \ I have no idea, but I would have come upon stray references to it in my reading\
    \ from as long ago as my teenperson years. My Imagined Kilvert, and his diary,\
    \ would be along these lines:\nA nineteenth-century country parson, somewhere\
    \ in England, elderly, with a long white Victorian beard. Daily, he records the\
    \ passing of the seasons in his rural idyll, concentrating his attention on flowers\
    \ and hedgerows and birds. Unlike Pontoppidan, he does not include the peasantry\
    \ in his natural history, though occasionally a peasant might have a walk-on part\
    \ in a diary entry, for example to impart a piece of rustic lore or wisdom to\
    \ the absent-minded vicar. We learn little or nothing of Kilvert's inner life,\
    \ nor much of his everyday clergyman's duties. The diary, which has never been\
    \ out of print since first published, shortly after his death, is still read because\
    \ he is a superb observer and recorder of the natural world, and evokes a vision\
    \ of the quiet English countryside that makes it seem a very paradise.\nHence\
    \ my surprise at the devils and ghosts and lawless lovers and murdered children.\
    \ Time now for a cup of tea, and then I shall find out what I can about the Reverend,\
    \ \u201CObserved\u201D, in Peter Blegvad's sense, by way of reference materials.\n\
    I am delighted to announce that I was right about the beard. Well, sort of. (Has\
    \ anybody ever written a book-length study entitled The Victorian Beard? I would\
    \ read it.) Sadly, Kilvert (1840\u20131879) did not live long enough for it to\
    \ grow white, for he died\u2014of peritonitis\u2014at the age of thirty-eight,\
    \ shortly after returning from his honeymoon. I was correct, too, to imagine him\
    \ as a country vicar. After studying at Oxford, he served a number of parishes\
    \ in Wiltshire and on the Welsh Borders. Other than that, my Imagined Kilvert\
    \ is a partial and inaccurate picture of the real one, particularly where the\
    \ diary is concerned.\nThough there is much observation of nature, the diary is\
    \ far more comprehensive in its concerns\u2014as much social history as natural\
    \ history. It includes comic scenes such as a funeral at Worcester cathedral where\
    \ the pallbearers stagger under the weight of a \u201Ccrushingly heavy\u201D coffin,\
    \ an account of Kilvert bathing naked and disporting himself upon the beach, and\
    \ a lengthy discussion of venereal disease conducted at a ruridecanal conference.\
    \ (Now there's a useful word\u2014ruridecanal: pertaining to a rural dean and\
    \ his jurisdiction.) The rustic rev also devotes over forty-four passages to descriptions\
    \ of women and girls, frankly confessing his \u201Csusceptibility to female beauty\u201D\
    . His writing has been compared to Hardy, Hopkins, and even to Proust. \u201C\
    For some time,\u201D he wrote in 1874, \u201CI have been trying to find the right\
    \ word for the shimmering, glancing, tumbling movement of the poplar leaves in\
    \ the sun and wind. It was \u2018dazzle\u2019. The dazzle of the poplars.\u201D\
    \nFar from being \u201Cnever out of print since first published, shortly after\
    \ his death\u201D, as I imagined, the diary's history is much more chequered.\
    \ For one thing, much of the original manuscript has been lost or (deliberately)\
    \ destroyed. Kilvert's widow, who never remarried, lived until 1911 and seems\
    \ to have removed entire sequences recounting \u201Cwild sad sweet trysts\u201D\
    \ with an earlier paramour. The standard selection we think of as Kilvert's Diary\
    \ was made by William Plomer and first published in three volumes between 1938\
    \ and 1940. Other editions have followed, but as far as I know it has gone in\
    \ and out of print.\nOne thing I could not have imagined was the name of Kilvert's\
    \ mother\u2014Thermuthis Ashe. It's not every day you meet a Thermuthis.\nAs for\
    \ the poem he was planning, one hundred and forty years ago today, about two lovers\
    \ who had made an assignation in the church-yard at Llanbedr Painscastle, I have\
    \ not been able to ascertain if Kilvert ever wrote it. He did write a number of\
    \ poems, but none were published in his lifetime. The ruined church, incidentally,\
    \ was restored in the year of Kilvert's death. I append a photograph of it, no\
    \ longer ruinous, below. If you peer at it very very carefully, you might just\
    \ be able to see an assembly of devils, ghosts, lawless lovers and murdered children.\n"
