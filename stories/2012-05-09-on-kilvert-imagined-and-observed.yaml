  text: 'What is it with these clergymen and their phantasms? The other day we had
    the Bishop of Bergen, Erik Pontoppidan, babbling on about sea monsters, and now
    we find that rustic Victorian, the Reverend Francis Kilvert, writing in his diary,
    on this day in 1872:

    This morning I conceived the idea of a poem in the style of Tam o'' Shanter--the
    scene to be laid in the ruined church of Llanbedr Painscastle. Two lovers who
    had made an assignation in the church-yard to be terrified by seeing through the
    windows an assembly of devils, ghosts, lawless lovers and murdered children.

    Until I read that, I thought Kilvert''s Diary was akin to Gilbert White''s Natural
    History Of Selborne, a series of observations on rural life and the natural world,
    gentle and rather winsome. I did not expect lawless lovers and murdered children
    in ruined churches. But then, I have never read Kilvert''s Diary, and came upon
    the above entry in The Assassin''s Cloak : An Anthology Of The World''s Greatest
    Diarists, edited by Irene and Alan Taylor (2000).

    Since 1977, Peter Blegvad has had an ongoing project called "Imagined, Observed,
    Remembered", best summarised by Mr B. himself:

    I began drawing sundry items thrice--first as I imagined them to be, then as I
    actually observed them to be, and lastly, after a suitable interval, as I remembered
    them to have been.

    It occurred to me that I could apply this idea--at least, the Imagined and Observed
    elements--in prose rather than drawings, to the Reverend Kilvert. After all, though
    I have never read the diary, I have heard of it. Where or when it first swam into
    my ken I have no idea, but I would have come upon stray references to it in my
    reading from as long ago as my teenperson years. My Imagined Kilvert, and his
    diary, would be along these lines:

    A nineteenth-century country parson, somewhere in England, elderly, with a long
    white Victorian beard. Daily, he records the passing of the seasons in his rural
    idyll, concentrating his attention on flowers and hedgerows and birds. Unlike
    Pontoppidan, he does not include the peasantry in his natural history, though
    occasionally a peasant might have a walk-on part in a diary entry, for example
    to impart a piece of rustic lore or wisdom to the absent-minded vicar. We learn
    little or nothing of Kilvert''s inner life, nor much of his everyday clergyman''s
    duties. The diary, which has never been out of print since first published, shortly
    after his death, is still read because he is a superb observer and recorder of
    the natural world, and evokes a vision of the quiet English countryside that makes
    it seem a very paradise.

    Hence my surprise at the devils and ghosts and lawless lovers and murdered children.
    Time now for a cup of tea, and then I shall find out what I can about the Reverend,
    "Observed", in Peter Blegvad''s sense, by way of reference materials.

    I am delighted to announce that I was right about the beard. Well, sort of. (Has
    anybody ever written a book-length study entitled The Victorian Beard? I would
    read it.) Sadly, Kilvert (1840-1879) did not live long enough for it to grow white,
    for he died--of peritonitis--at the age of thirty-eight, shortly after returning
    from his honeymoon. I was correct, too, to imagine him as a country vicar. After
    studying at Oxford, he served a number of parishes in Wiltshire and on the Welsh
    Borders. Other than that, my Imagined Kilvert is a partial and inaccurate picture
    of the real one, particularly where the diary is concerned.

    Though there is much observation of nature, the diary is far more comprehensive
    in its concerns--as much social history as natural history. It includes comic
    scenes such as a funeral at Worcester cathedral where the pallbearers stagger
    under the weight of a "crushingly heavy" coffin, an account of Kilvert bathing
    naked and disporting himself upon the beach, and a lengthy discussion of venereal
    disease conducted at a ruridecanal conference. (Now there''s a useful word--ruridecanal:
    pertaining to a rural dean and his jurisdiction.) The rustic rev also devotes
    over forty-four passages to descriptions of women and girls, frankly confessing
    his "susceptibility to female beauty". His writing has been compared to Hardy,
    Hopkins, and even to Proust. "For some time," he wrote in 1874, "I have been trying
    to find the right word for the shimmering, glancing, tumbling movement of the
    poplar leaves in the sun and wind. It was ''dazzle''. The dazzle of the poplars."

    Far from being "never out of print since first published, shortly after his death",
    as I imagined, the diary''s history is much more chequered. For one thing, much
    of the original manuscript has been lost or (deliberately) destroyed. Kilvert''s
    widow, who never remarried, lived until 1911 and seems to have removed entire
    sequences recounting "wild sad sweet trysts" with an earlier paramour. The standard
    selection we think of as Kilvert''s Diary was made by William Plomer and first
    published in three volumes between 1938 and 1940. Other editions have followed,
    but as far as I know it has gone in and out of print.

    One thing I could not have imagined was the name of Kilvert''s mother--Thermuthis
    Ashe. It''s not every day you meet a Thermuthis.

    As for the poem he was planning, one hundred and forty years ago today, about
    two lovers who had made an assignation in the church-yard at Llanbedr Painscastle,
    I have not been able to ascertain if Kilvert ever wrote it. He did write a number
    of poems, but none were published in his lifetime. The ruined church, incidentally,
    was restored in the year of Kilvert''s death. I append a photograph of it, no
    longer ruinous, below. If you peer at it very very carefully, you might just be
    able to see an assembly of devils, ghosts, lawless lovers and murdered children.
