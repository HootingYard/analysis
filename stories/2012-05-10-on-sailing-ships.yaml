  text: "One day long long ago, in the bloom of youth, I was at the seaside, tarrying\
    \ on a pier, fresh from a game of crazy golf and sucking an ice lolly. The sky\
    \ was overcast and seabirds were screeching. I had decided, when once I was done\
    \ with my lolly, to return to the dilapidated boarding house where I was staying\
    \ with my parents and siblings, to fetch my swimming trunks and a towel, and then\
    \ to go a-splashing in the sea. But as I leaned against the railings on the pier,\
    \ sucking away, I was accosted by an elderly gent. He gave off a stink of kippers\
    \ and brine and his huge hairy beard was riddled with fishbones. He leaned against\
    \ the railings next to me, and pointed out to sea.\n\u201CLook, sonny,\u201D he\
    \ said, \u201CWhat do you see?\u201D\nI looked in the direction of his pointing\
    \ finger and could just make out, in the sea-mist, the shape of a ship, half way\
    \ to the horizon.\n\u201CI see a ship,\u201D I said.\n\u201CAye, 'tis a ship indeed,\u201D\
    \ said the old sea dog, \u201CAnd can you tell me the basic constituent parts\
    \ of, say, a wooden ship?\u201D\n\u201CI'll try my best,\u201D I said, for I was\
    \ biddable and eager to please, \u201CSternpost, keel, false keel or shoe, fore\
    \ foot or gripe, stem, headpiece, garboard strake, bottom planking, side planking,\
    \ wale, sheer strake, covering board, bulwark, rough-tree rail, topgallant bulwark,\
    \ rudder, counter, stern, chain plates, cathead, figurehead, mizzenmast, mainmast,\
    \ foremast, and\u2026 oh\u2026 there's one part on the tip of my tongue.\u201D\
    \nThe old tar stuffed a gobbet of salt taffy into his mouth and chewed on it,\
    \ looking at me with a twinkle in his eye.\n\u201CBowsprit!\u201D, I cried, triumphantly.\n\
    \u201CGood lad,\u201D he said, \u201CBut what if I asked you to name three different\
    \ types of parrel and their constituent parts?\u201D\n\u201CGolly!\u201D, I said,\
    \ and after a moment's thought, babbling, I listed what I could recall. \u201C\
    Well, first, a parrel with cleats on a wooden yard, you'd have topmast, yard,\
    \ wooden cleats, a half-iron hoop served with leather, pins forming hinges to\
    \ open the parrel, an iron band to take the tie, and iron straps and bolts securing\
    \ the parrel to the yard. But if you had a tub parrel for an iron yard, then there\
    \ would be topmast, yard, tub divided in halves, iron binding for same, gooseneck\
    \ bolt, iron bands to take parrel and tie, yoke for the parrel, yoke for the tie,\
    \ and eye bolt for the quarterblock. Thereagain, with a parrel sliding on a T-bar\
    \ in a big ship, I would say topmast, topsail yard, T-bar, slide, two-way coupling,\
    \ tie, connecting chain keeping slide in place, and last but by no means least,\
    \ eye bolts for quarterblocks, captain. Should I call you captain?\u201D\n\u201C\
    It is many a long year since I served as a captain, my boy,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    But tell me, if you cobbled together a topsail yard, parrel, rolling spar, iron\
    \ drum end of the rolling spar, yardarm hoop, arm carrying the reefing halliard\
    \ block, cheek block for topgallant sheet, parrel crutch with lignum vitae rollers,\
    \ lignum vitae rollers, topsail, lead block for reefing halliards, and topsail\
    \ yardarm, what would you have?\u201D\nI rubbed my chin to demonstrate that I\
    \ was thinking carefully, as Darbyshire does, in imitation of Mr Carter, in the\
    \ books by Anthony Buckeridge.\n\u201CI think,\u201D I said, \u201CNo, I know\u2026\
    \ you'd have Colling's and Pinkney's patent self-reefing topsail, would you not?\u201D\
    \n\u201CYou would indeed,\u201D said the ancient mariner, and he spat his salt\
    \ taffy into the sea.\nI waited for his next question.\n\u201CI wonder if you\
    \ can tell me,\u201D he said, \u201CAbout a four-masted barque.\u201D\n\u201C\
    Easy peasy,\u201D I said, but too quickly, because with a glint of impatience,\
    \ he snapped:\n\u201CNot just any four-masted barque, lad, but a particular one!\
    \ Tell me everything you know about the Herzogin Cecilie!\u201D\nI gulped, and\
    \ took a last suck on what was left of my ice lolly.\n\u201CWell,\u201D I began,\
    \ haltingly, \u201CThe Herzogin Cecilie, the Herzogin Cecilie\u2026 Ah, I think\
    \ that was a four-masted barque built in 1902 by Rickmers shipyard at Bremerhaven\
    \ for the Norddeutscher Lloyd at Bremen. It was a big sailing vessel of three\
    \ thousand, two hundred and forty-two gross tons or four thousand, three hundred\
    \ and fifty dw. She was a good sailer and made many excellent voyages. During\
    \ World War One she was interned at Coquimbo in Chile. After the war, she brought\
    \ a cargo of bauxite to Ostend, and\u2026 no, not bauxite, it was a cargo of nitrate.\
    \ At Ostend she was allocated to the French government. In November 1921 she was\
    \ purchased by Gustaf Erikson, Mariehamn, Finland, and under his flag was employed\
    \ chiefly in the Australian grain trade. She foundered on 25 April 1936 off Salcombe\
    \ in Devonshire, after running aground in heavy fog.\u201D\n\u201CTiptop Herzogin\
    \ Cecilie information,\u201D said the sea dog, beaming at me, \u201CNow, just\
    \ one more question. How many jibs did she have?\u201D\n\u201CI would say three,\u201D\
    \ I replied, \u201CAn inner jib, an outer jib, and a flying jib.\u201D\n\u201C\
    And you would be right to say so,\u201D he said, \u201CBut now our conversation\
    \ is at an end.\u201D\n\u201COh,\u201D I said, a little downcast, \u201CI think\
    \ that must be the first time I have had a ship-related conversation with no mention\
    \ at all of poop or orlop decks.\u201D\n\u201CDon't you worry,\u201D he said,\
    \ \u201CYou will be having plenty more ship-related conversations in the decades\
    \ to come, for you have passed my rigorous tests and I am going to press-gang\
    \ you into the service of the king's navy.\u201D\nAnd so saying, he suddenly gave\
    \ me a great shove and pushed me over the railings and I splashed into the sea.\
    \ I was picked up by a rowing boat sent from the wooden ship he had pointed out\
    \ to me, in the distance, now wholly enshrouded in sea-mist. And into that mist\
    \ I was rowed, by a crew of hefty silent rowers, until the ship loomed huge ahead,\
    \ and looking back I could no longer see any trace of the the pier, and the shore,\
    \ and the dilapidated boarding house where my parents and siblings waited for\
    \ me."
