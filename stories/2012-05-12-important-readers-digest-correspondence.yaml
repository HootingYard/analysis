  text: "A letter arrives in the post:\nDear Mr Key\nI was interested to read your\
    \ comments about The Readers' Digest, which was a formative influence when I was\
    \ growing up also. An ancient companion of my late grandmother lived with us,\
    \ and was a subscriber: she would leave copies outside her door when she'd finished\
    \ with them and we all pounced on them with glee. As well as the magazines, she\
    \ received a 78 rpm record every month from some sort of listening-club associated\
    \ with the publisher, and my brother and I were intrigued by these, as she never\
    \ allowed us to hear them (though we endured endless Caruso, Bing Crosby and The\
    \ Spooncat 5 on her wind-up gramophone). She explained that the Readers' Digest\
    \ records always got broken in the post, and we never wondered why she didn't\
    \ simply cancel the subscription.\nShe's been gone for decades; but her wind-up\
    \ gramophone remained, and when we were cleaning it up recently to send it to\
    \ auction we found just one of those white-label Readers' Digest 78s, still extant\
    \ in a thin drawer in the base of the machine. It's lo-fi stuff--and pretty tame\
    \ these days--but I've recorded the 'with vocal refrain' section in hopes that\
    \ it will be of interest to your readers. I used 'declicking' software to remove\
    \ most of the surface hiss but there's no curing the damage at the end. Doubtless\
    \ we have the Royal Mail to thank for that.\nBest wishes\n  Roland Clare\n aunt-maud-78rpm "
