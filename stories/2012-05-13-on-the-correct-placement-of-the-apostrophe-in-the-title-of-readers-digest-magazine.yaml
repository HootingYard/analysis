  text: "Few problems in the history of human activity on earth have proved as intractable\
    \ as the placement of the apostrophe in the title of the Reader's Digest magazine.\
    \ Indeed, running it close as a question which befuddles the heads of the best\
    \ and brightest is whether the title includes the definite article or not. As\
    \ if to demonstrate that I know precisely what I am talking about, we have seen\
    \ two variants, Reader's Digest and The Readers\u2019 Digest, right here at Hooting\
    \ Yard in the past few days.\nHooting Yard itself does not contain an apostrophe,\
    \ thank heavens, but occasionally it has been referred to as The Hooting Yard.\
    \ I have no idea where on earth those who deploy this usage get that The from.\
    \ Mr Key has certainly never used it himself. Let us be clear. There is not now,\
    \ nor has there ever been, nor will there ever be, in any conceivable future,\
    \ a prefixed definite article in Hooting Yard. If any doubt remains, the best\
    \ idea would be for those who cannot grasp this simple fact to have the previous\
    \ sentence tattooed, in mirror writing, upon their foreheads.\nIf only things\
    \ were so plain and straightforward in Reader's Digest land. But they are not.\
    \ Let us get that definite article out of the way to begin with, before we concentrate\
    \ our pulsating brains upon the knotty problem of the apostrophe. The issue is\
    \ clouded by the fact that Reader's Digest (without the The) is published by The\
    \ Reader's Digest Association (with the The). Easy enough, then, for a person\
    \ who is not necessarily a dimwit or a clodpoll to carry over the definite article\
    \ from the name of the publisher to the publication it publishes. There is a certain\
    \ logic to doing so. But therein lie the perils of granting too high a status\
    \ to logic. Yes, human beings have developed the powers of logic over millennia,\
    \ and they have proved a boon in many fields of endeavour, from agriculture to\
    \ zoology. But logic only gets us so far, and ought not be applied in those areas\
    \ where it is a drawback. I am thinking of such areas as politics and magazine\
    \ nomenclature. In politics, logic, or at least the illusion of logic, leads to\
    \ the utopian barbarities of Lenin or Pol Pot. In magazine nomenclature, it leads\
    \ to calling Reader's Digest The Reader's Digest. Granted, in the latter case\
    \ the human consequences are negligible, even nonexistent, but we must always\
    \ beware of slippery slopes. That is the lesson an elderly relative taught me\
    \ after an Alpine to-do. Recounting the details of the to-do might provide this\
    \ piece with some much needed colour and vim and grit, but lord love a duck!,\
    \ another time\u2026 another time\u2026\nLesson One, then. The title of the magazine\
    \ is Reader's Digest, without a The.\nHaving honed our wits on that one, we can\
    \ turn to the infinitely more pernickety problem of the apostrophe. Curiously\
    \ enough, logic, or the absence of logic, will be of no help to us here. One of\
    \ the reasons the placement of the apostrophe in the title has proved so maddening\
    \ for so many for so many decades is that an argument can be made, and a compelling\
    \ argument to boot, for both Reader's and Readers\u2019. Neither is, in and of\
    \ itself, in context, right or wrong. Let us recall what was in the minds of the\
    \ founders, De Witt Wallace (1889\u20131981), and his ever-loving wife Lila Bell\
    \ Wallace n\xE9e Acheson (1889\u20131984). Their bright idea was to gather a sample\
    \ of articles on many subjects from various monthly magazines and journals, sometimes\
    \ condensing and rewriting them, and to combine them into a single publication\u2014\
    a digest. A bit like Hooting Yard, in other words. Well, not really. Not at all\
    \ in fact. I don't know why I wrote that, unless perhaps I was brain-bedizened\
    \ at the thought of the millions of readers the Wallaces attracted, almost from\
    \ the start in 1922. Let me take a deep breath and becalm my pounding brainpans\
    \ and continue.\nHaving concocted the idea of a Digest for Magazine Readers, it\
    \ must have been a simple enough matter for De Witt and Lila Bell to plump for\
    \ Reader's Digest\u2014or Readers\u2019 Digest\u2014as the name of their publication.\
    \ A few months ago, in discussing Skippy The Bush Kangaroo, I imagined its creator\
    \ John McCallum sitting at the breakfast table with his wife Googie Withers, as\
    \ he struggled to come up with the name of the bush kangaroo heroine of his television\
    \ series. We might similarly imagine the Wallaces at breakfast, not of course\
    \ in Sydney, Australia, but in their modest yet beautifully-appointed home in\
    \ Minneapolis St Paul. De Witt, you may recall, was recovering from shrapnel wounds\
    \ received in Flanders fields during the Great War, so in this scene we might\
    \ picture him still enbandaged, whey-faced and peaky.\nLila Bell\_: Given your\
    \ shrapnel wounds, sweet darling, are you sure you are able to spread that Lurpak\
    \ on your toast, or would you like me to help?\nDe Witt\_: I think I can manage,\
    \ oh poppet. I am just thinking how lucky we are to have this Danish proprietary\
    \ brand of butter available, here in Minnesota in the early nineteen-twenties.\n\
    Lila Bell\_: It is undoubtedly one of the benefits of the capitalist system, light\
    \ of my life. But let us try to reach a final decision on the placement of the\
    \ apostrophe in the title of the magazine we hope to publish soon.\nDe Witt\_\
    : [Unintelligible response due to mouth crammed with toast \u2018n\u2019 Lurpak.]\n\
    Lila Bell\_: I did not quite catch that, honeybun. Remember, it pays to refine\
    \ your table manners.\nDe Witt\_: [Swallowing, and wiping his mouth with a napkin.]\
    \ I apologise, dear heart. That was most remiss of me. Let me repeat what I said,\
    \ this time with a mouth free of toast \u2018n\u2019 Lurpak. I think the best\
    \ place for the apostrophe is\u2014\u2013 \u2013\nDe Witt Wallace is interrupted\
    \ by a sudden and insistent hammering at the door. Lila Bell goes to answer it,\
    \ to find a person from Porlock on the doorstep.\nHaving researched the matter\
    \ thoroughly, I am able to reconstruct what De Witt Wallace was about to say,\
    \ to wit:\nDe Witt\_:\u2014\u2013\u2014 between the R and the S rather than after\
    \ the S.\nAnd I like to think that, given the chance, he would have continued\
    \ as follows:\nDe Witt\_: The apostrophe placed after the S suggests our magazine\
    \ is a digest for readers, plural. Which, of course, is what we desire, if we\
    \ are not to be cast into penury, fire of my loins. We will scarcely be able to\
    \ build a global publishing empire without a multitude of readers, whose digest\
    \ we will provide.\nLila Bell\_: Then I fail to see the logic of your pronouncement,\
    \ popsy.\nDe Witt\_: Ah, pumpkin, but by placing the apostrophe to suggest it\
    \ is a digest for just one reader, we cleverly instil in each and every reader's\
    \ mind that the magazine is for them, and them alone. Even though it isn't. We\
    \ are saying, \u201CYou are the reader, and this digest is just for you\u201D\
    .\nLila Bell\_: Gosh!\nThus, Lesson Two\_: The apostrophe in Reader's Digest appears\
    \ between the R and the S, not after the S."
