  text: 'Every now and then I ponder whether it would be a good idea to abandon all
    this Hooting Yardery and instead devote my energies to writing a blockbuster.
    In my mind''s eye I see the shelves of airport bookstalls groaning under the weight
    of sundry copies of a thick paperback with gold-embossed lettering on the cover.
    I further imagine staring at a computer screen on which my earnings from royalties
    and commercial licensing deals are continuously updated, the numbers growing huger
    with every passing second. Meanwhile, the telephone does not stop ringing, as
    calls come in from Hollywood agents desperate to obtain the film rights. And then
    I think, why bother writing the blockbuster? Why not just go straight to the film
    script? I have never actually attempted to write a screenplay, but it can''t be
    that difficult. Well, maybe it is, but needs must when the devil drives.

    The Devil Drives might have been a good title for my film script a few years ago,
    when Hollywood was enamoured of Satan and all his works. But I suspect the time
    for a road movie in which Beelzebub drives across America wreaking fiendishness
    at every turn has passed. Vampires and zombies seem more the thing these days,
    but that is a furrow well-ploughed.

    So I decided to play a game of Protagonist Location Literary Reference, or Prolo
    Litref for short. This is a pastime I devised myself. You get a set of bleached
    blank playing cards, and divide them into three. Readers with their wits about
    them will know what to do next, but for any clots and dullards drooling their
    way through this, the idea is that on one set of cards you write the names of
    various protagonists, on another a variety of settings or locations, and on the
    third some interesting literary bittybobs, be they names of authors, or book titles,
    or anecdotes, or what have you. You then splat the cards face down in three groups
    upon a large flat surface, such as an ice rink, and pick one card from each.

    That is how I arrived at the idea for my screenplay, which involves an underpants
    bomber on a submarine, also aboard which are Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. This
    seems to me to have the potential to be a surefire multiplex hit. I have heard
    that Hollywood producers sometimes like to have a "wild card" element in a plot,
    some little thing to differentiate the film from a thousand others. In this case,
    I think that, having Ted Hughes aboard the sub--actually, it might be a U-Boat--we
    could introduce a stowaway crow. This would add so many frissons I can''t begin
    to count them.

    Already I am carried away with enthusiasm, and imagining scenes which I will somehow
    have to fit in to the script. Ted and Sylvia kissing and drawing blood from each
    other, as they tended to do. The underpants bomber being revealed to have a morbid
    fear of crows. The U-Boat captain, who I suppose will have to be portrayed negatively,
    shouting orders in German, with subtitles, while water from a leaking pipe drips
    from the brim of his captain''s cap.

    Maddened Plathists would no doubt complain, and even picket the cinemas, if Ted
    got to hang out with a U-boat crow without Sylvia''s enthusiasms being equally
    catered for, so perhaps she could have a box full of bees in the cargo hold. I
    realise that we would be skittering a little close to Snakes On A Plane territory--Bees
    In A U-Boat--but that is a risk I am willing to take. It could also provide the
    pretext for a scene in which the bees somehow get into the underpants bomber''s
    underpants, and either trigger or disable the bomb. What the crow might be up
    to at the time I have not yet worked out--probably perching atop Ted''s head,
    cawing.

    Though it would be tempting to portray the underpants bomber as a beardy jihadist
    nutcase, I would like the film to be a little more subtle. I am also bearing in
    mind television showings, where, at least in Europe, the Muslim character always
    turns out to be innocent, even saintly, in spite of being a prime suspect early
    on. Perhaps we would need to cast someone like Tom Hanks as the terrorist. The
    details of why he has a bomb in his underpants can be worked on. Perhaps it was
    placed there against his will? By Sylvia? Or by Ted and Sylvia working in unison?
    There are various possibilities, and the great thing is they are all packed with
    thrills and spills.

    I have mentioned that there has to be a lot of water leaking into the U-Boat,
    which is old and riddled with metal fatigue. Seals and bolts creak and strain
    under the pressure as the sub dives ever deeper. It might even be heading into
    an abyss, a previously unknown trench on the sea bed wherein, billions of years
    ago, superintelligent aliens beings formed a colony... no, no, I am not going
    to go there.

    Actually, why make a one-off film when surely a twelve or twenty-four episode
    television series would prove more lucrative? This would necessitate having all
    the actors speaking Danish and wearing chunky knitwear which might get sodden
    by all that leaking water. But there would be time to insert all sorts of subplots
    and also to explore the complex pasts of, and the relationships between the characters.
    Is the captain an old flame of Sylvia''s? Is the underpants bomber a failed poet
    with a grudge against Ted? Is the captain a secret Muslim? I don''t know if the
    Danes have, or had, U-Boats, but a little tweaking of history is forgiveable.

    Clearly I have a lot of work to do pulling all the strands together, but quite
    frankly I can''t see this failing to be a popular success.'
