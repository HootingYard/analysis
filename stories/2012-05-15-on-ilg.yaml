  text: "\nIn Brain Men, his splendid book about the British obsession with pub quizzes,\
    \ Marcus Berkmann refers to the Gleam of Certainty. If, upon hearing a question,\
    \ one of your team-mates exhibits the Gleam of Certainty, there is no need to\
    \ debate possible alternative answers. Your team-mate knows the correct answer,\
    \ beyond all doubt. Even if you think you know different, you must defer to the\
    \ Gleam of Certainty.\nI don't much go to pub quizzes these days, but when I did,\
    \ I waited in vain for one particular question which, had it been posed, I could\
    \ have met with the Gleam of Certainty. But oddly enough no quizmaster ever asked\
    \ it.\n\"Who,\" I dreamed of hearing, \"designed both the waterworks and the cupola\
    \ of the Observatory in Berne, Switzerland, made a pair of shoes and a rifle for\
    \ Haile Selassie's uncle, sported Ruritanian tinpot attire, and was a pal of Arthur\
    \ Rimbaud?\" While everyone else scratched their heads and dribbled, I would have\
    \ the Gleam of Certainty. For I know that the answer to the question is Alfred\
    \ Ilg.\nIlg (1854-1916)--or rather, his surname--first struck me because I thought\
    \ it sounded just like the kind of surname I would have devised for a Hooting\
    \ Yard character, particularly in stories written in the pre-Wilderness Years\
    \ of the past century. Ilg would have fitted in very well among Bewg and Ack and\
    \ Vug and Fig and Mat and Nat and Bam and Lip and Obb and Pew and all those other\
    \ curt monosyllabic names of which I was so fond. When one considers, too, that\
    \ he created, from scratch, a functioning postal system, including the design\
    \ of the stamps, it becomes apparent that, had Ilg not existed, I might have had\
    \ to invent him.\nThough he was born and died in Switzerland, Ilg spent many years\
    \ in Ethiopia, working directly for King Menelik, the uncle of Ras Tafari, later\
    \ Haile Selassie. It was the Ethiopian postal system he created, as well as its\
    \ unified currency. He is considered to be the most important European in Ethiopian\
    \ history, a sort of right hand man or, we might now say, chief of staff to the\
    \ King. Arriving in what was then Shawa with his alphabetically extreme Swiss\
    \ colleagues Appenzeller and Zimmermann in 1878, the first task he was given by\
    \ Menelik was to make a pair of shoes. So delighted was the King with the result\
    \ that he next asked Ilg to make him a rifle. Ilg protested that he knew not a\
    \ jot about the manufacture of firearms and, perhaps with an eye to his later\
    \ dealings with the gun-runner Rimbaud, suggested that imported weaponry would\
    \ be far more efficient than anything he could cobble together. Menelik, being\
    \ a big tough omnipotent king, swatted these objections aside and insisted that\
    \ the Swiss shoemaker make him a damned rifle, pronto. Ilg, who clearly knew a\
    \ lot more about rifle-making than he let on, duly made what has been described\
    \ as a \"passable rifle\". Perhaps Menelik tested it by taking potshots at passing\
    \ Ethiopian wildlife. What we do know is that the King was so pleased with his\
    \ new, lethal, toy that he gave it pride of place in his armoury and ever after\
    \ considered Ilg indispensable. Indeed, some years later the Swiss with \"the\
    \ cuboid head and the scrubbing-brush hair\" was given the splendidly uncertain\
    \ title of Counsellor In The Range Of An Excellency, before eventually, from 1897\
    \ to 1907, becoming the rather more clear-cut Ethiopian Minister Of Foreign Affairs.\n\
    Though I am fond of his postal system innovations, Ilg was more celebrated in\
    \ his adopted country for his civil engineering projects, including a major railway\
    \ line, the electrification of the royal palace, and the design and construction\
    \ of the piped water supply to the brand new capital of Addis Ababa. The latter\
    \ has been described by Richard Pankhurst (son of Sylvia and great-nephew of Emily)\
    \ as follows:\nIn 1894, Ilg installed the water installations for the Emperor's\
    \ palace at Addis Ababa. This created something of a sensation, as the water,\
    \ obtained from a spring in high Entoto, had to flow down to the Addis Ababa plain\
    \ beneath it, and then make its way up again to the Palace compound, which was\
    \ located on a smallish hill. People in the capital had never seen anything like\
    \ this, and could not believe that water could ever, under any circumstances,\
    \ flow upward. Menelik, however, was a great believer in innovation, and insisted\
    \ that Ilg should proceed with his project, if only to see whether it would work.\
    \ When the great day for inauguration arrived, the tap was turned on--but nothing\
    \ happened. A European \"friend\" had secretly stuffed cotton into the pipe, as\
    \ Ilg later discovered. This obstruction was duly removed, after which Ilg--and\
    \ his project--were widely acclaimed. At least two Amharic poems were composed\
    \ in honour of the event.\nOne declared:\n\"We have seen wonders in Addis Ababa.\n\
    \    Water worships Emperor Menelik.\n    O Danyew [i.e. Menelik] what more wisdom\
    \ will you bring?\n      You already make water soar in the air!\"\nAnd the other\
    \ ran as follows:\n\"King Abba Danyew, how great is he becoming!\n    He makes\
    \ the water rise into the air through a window.\n    While the dirty can be washed,\
    \ and the thirsty drink.\n    See what wonders have already come in our times.\n\
    \    No wonder that some day he will even outdo the Ferenje {i.e. Europeans].\"\
    \nNeither of these poems was the work of Ilg's friend Arthur Rimbaud, who by the\
    \ time of their acquaintanceship had long abandoned poetry and was, in the final\
    \ few years of his life, bitter and disillusioned. In 1888, he wrote:\nI'm always\
    \ very bored, in fact I've never known anyone be more bored than I am. And isn't\
    \ this indeed a miserable existence, without any family, without any intellectual\
    \ activity, lost in the midst of these negroes whose lot one would like to improve,\
    \ and who themselves seek to exploit you and to prevent you from realizing any\
    \ money without long delays? Obliged to speak their gibberish, to eat their dirty\
    \ food, to endure a thousand frustrations on account of their laziness, their\
    \ treachery, and their stupidity. But that's not the saddest thing. What's worse\
    \ is the fear of becoming brutalized oneself, little by little, isolated as one\
    \ is, and so far away from any intelligent society.\nIt was not a view shared\
    \ by Alfred Ilg himself, who thrived in Ethiopian society. As he wrote to Rimbaud\
    \ in 1889:\nIt seems the delights of doing business here have driven away completely\
    \ the little bit of good humour you had left. Look, my dear Monsieur Rimbaud,\
    \ you only live once, so make the most of it and to hell with your heirs.\nIlg\
    \ eventually returned to Switzerland, to Zurich, in 1907. He died there, of a\
    \ heart attack, in 1916, on the seventh of January, which Pankhurst tells us was\
    \ Christmas Day in Ethiopia.\n\nNOTE : The quotations from letters by Rimbaud\
    \ and Ilg are taken from Somebody Else : Arthur Rimbaud In Africa 1880-91 by Charles\
    \ Nicholl (1997)."
