  text: 'For reasons both bewildering and unfathomable, Hooting Yard has occasionally
    ended up in lists of tiptop blogs perused by those of a Liberal Democrat persuasion.
    Partly by way of these perplexing bedfellows, I happened upon a postage called
    Eight years in eight posts--where Jonathan Calder, following the lead of some
    others, took a look back at what he was writing on more or less the same date
    during the past eight years. So I thought it might be instructive and diverting
    to do the same. There was a time, regrettably, when Hooting Yard was not the Indefatigable
    Daily it has become, so where there was no postage for 16 May I have taken something
    from as close to the date as I could.

    Last year, on 16 May 2011, I linked to a piece in The Dabbler about James Joyce''s
    Ulysses. This gave me the excuse to retail for the umpteenth time a couple of
    contemporary reviews of the novel and other Joycean bittybobs.

    On 16 May 2010, The Bats Of Remorse included the phrase "the porale of grief".
    "Porale" is a splendid and too rarely deployed word.

    On 18 May 2009 I revealed the four categories of reader defined by an eighteenth-century
    subscription library.

    16 May 2008 was the occasion for an illustration depicting sphairistike as played
    in the year 2000.

    Another illustration on 16 May 2007, which I like so much I shall reproduce it
    here. We have, of course, seen further references to Chutney On My Spats in recent
    days.


    We now revert to the old Hooting Yard format, where 14 May 2006 included a quotation
    from Bachelor Bluff : His Opinions, Sentiments, And Disputations by Oliver Bell
    Bunce (1881).

    On 24 May 2005, learn why you will be disappointed should you wish to know How
    Cats Spend Their Time.

    And on 17 May 2004, The Life And Loves Of The Immersion Man, one of the first
    pieces I ever read on Resonance104.4FM, on a Clear Spot programme in 2002, before
    the advent of Hooting Yard On The Air.

    NOTE : The links to Old Format Hooting Yard seem to go somewhat astray. You might
    have to scroll up or down a tad to find precisely what I intend you to find.'
