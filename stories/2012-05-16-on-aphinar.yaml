  text: "ONE LOT : A SINGLE TUSK\n    ONE LOT : TWO TUSKS\n    ONE LOT : THREE TUSKS\n\
    \    ONE LOT : FOUR TUSKS\n    ONE LOT : TWO TUSKS\nTo the Director\nDear Sir\n\
    \    I have come to enquire if I have anything left on account with you. I wish\
    \ to change today my booking on this ship whose name I don't even know, but anyway\
    \ it must be the ship from Aphinar. There are shipping lines going all over the\
    \ place, but helpless and unhappy as I am, I can't find a single one--the first\
    \ dog you meet in the street will tell you this. Send me the prices of the ship\
    \ from Aphinar to Suez. I am completely paralysed, so I wish to embark in good\
    \ time. Please let me know when I should be carried aboard...\nThus Arthur Rimbaud's\
    \ last recorded words, dictated in a delirium to his sister Isabelle from his\
    \ Marseille hospital bed on the eve of his death on 10 November 1891. As Charles\
    \ Nicholl notes in Somebody Else : Arthur Rimbaud In Africa 188-1891 (1997),\n\
    Where or what Aphinar is no one is sure. The phrase he uses is le service d'Aphinar,\
    \ which seems to mean 'the ship from Aphinar' but could equally mean 'the Aphinar\
    \ shipping line', so one cannot be quite sure if Aphinar is a place or a company,\
    \ or even a particular captain. One cannot even be sure that 'Aphinar' is what\
    \ Rimbaud said: it is only Isabelle's transcription. Was it rather Al Finar, the\
    \ Arab word for 'lighthouse', and was this phantom ship which he wished to board\
    \ 'in good time' the one that would carry him away from the light and into darkness?\n\
    But we must begin somewhere, so, in the teeth of uncertainty, we dismiss the shipping\
    \ line, the captain, the lighthouse, and we say Aphinar is a place, a city, a\
    \ distant city across the sea, and we set out to find it. We pack twelve tusks,\
    \ divided into five lots, into a pippy bag and we sling it over our shoulder.\
    \ Mindful that Rimbaud had lost his right leg to the surgeon's saw on 27 May,\
    \ we hobble our own right leg by less drastic means--twine and cord, perhaps,\
    \ or a tight burlap sack. And so on crutches we make our way to the docks. It\
    \ may be that we are setting out on a journey from which there will be no return,\
    \ a hopeless and pointless journey, like the one undertaken by the Japanese student\
    \ who left her homeland in search of the fictional loot hidden under snow by the\
    \ criminal robber and kidnapper Carl Showalter in Fargo (Joel & Ethan Coen, 1996).\
    \ The poor girl perished on her quest, and we too may face death before we reach\
    \ Aphinar.\nAt the docks, we lean upon our crutches and we cast an eye over the\
    \ ships. We did not get a chance, on the way here, to ask questions about shipping\
    \ of a dog in the street. The street was empty of dogs, as if Rimbaud had been\
    \ here ahead of us and poisoned all the dogs, just as he poisoned thousands of\
    \ dogs in Harar, after a cur pissed on his animal hides hung out to dry in the\
    \ hot dusty Ethiopian air. The air here is neither hot nor dusty. It is bitter\
    \ cold, even icy, and a glance at the sky reveals the near certainty of snow.\
    \ And so we gaze from ship to ship. Look, there is the Herzogin Cecilie, magically\
    \ restored from its wrecking off the Devonshire coast! It gleams and glistens,\
    \ even shimmers. We haul ourselves on to the gangplank, and it seems scarcely\
    \ solid beneath our foot. A phantom ship, perhaps, for a phantom voyage, to the\
    \ distant city of Aphinar.\nAboard, the captain greets us. What have you in that\
    \ pippy bag?, he asks. We have twelve tusks in five lots, we reply. For like Rimbaud,\
    \ we are honest, capable, and courageous. I have cargo of grain and nitrate in\
    \ the hold, says the captain, Your tusks may be stored there for the duration\
    \ of the voyage. We thank the captain and are glad to relinquish the pippy bag\
    \ of tusks to a sailor, who carries it below. We do not know if ever we will see\
    \ the bag, the tusks, again, but something tells us we will need the tusks to\
    \ parlay our way through the massive wrought iron gates of the city of Aphinar,\
    \ where the sentries must be bribed.\nShown, by another sailor, to our cabin,\
    \ we collapse upon our berth. We wait, with the impatience of Rimbaud, for the\
    \ ship to sail. At rest, flat out on the hard bunk, we are soon asleep, and dreaming.\
    \ And such dreams! Of Appenzeller and Ilg and Zimmermann. Of two thousand poisoned\
    \ dogs. Of a season in hell. Of our right leg, amputated and dumped in a Marseille\
    \ incinerator.\nWe awake and are relieved to see our right leg present and correct,\
    \ though numbed. Would it destroy the purpose of our journey to free it from twine\
    \ and cord, from the tight burlap sack, to shake the life back into it, and go\
    \ walking on the deck of the Herzogin Cecilie, unencrutched? Rimbaud had not that\
    \ option, at the end. But nor, so far as we know, did he ever reach Aphinar. It\
    \ will surely do us no harm to walk on two legs, as Rimbaud did, for untold miles,\
    \ in Europe and Africa, until his final monopod months.\nAnd so we free the numbed\
    \ leg and leap from the bunk and cut two or three brisk capers around the room,\
    \ like Boswell in the morning. But it is not morning. When we leave our cabin,\
    \ and go out on deck, we see it is night, vast, illimitable, and starless. There\
    \ is no sign of the captain nor his crew. There is no sign of a living soul. Yet\
    \ the ship, the ship! It is riding the waves, fast and steady and straight, sails\
    \ billowing. Nothing can stop us. We are on our way to Aphinar!"
