  text: 'If instead of one apple falling on the head of Sir Isaac Newton a heavenly
    orchard had let tumble a rain of fruit, one of the greatest of men would have
    been overwhelmed and then buried. Anyone examining the situation afterwards in
    a properly scientific spirit, clearing the apples layer by layer, would be able
    to deduce certain facts. He would be able to prove that the man was there before
    the apples. Furthermore, that the blushing Beauty of Bath found immediately over
    and round Sir Isaac fell longer ago than the small swarthy russets that lay above
    them. If, on top of all this, snow had fallen, then the observer, even if he came
    from Mars where they are not familiar with these things, would know that apple
    time came before snow time.

    Relative ages are not enough, the observer would want an absolute date, and that
    is where Sir Isaac comes in again. An examination of his clothes, the long-skirted
    coat, the loose breeches and the negligent cut of his linen, the long, square-toed
    shoes pointing so forlornly up to the sky, would date the man to the seventeenth
    century. Here would be a clue to the age of the apples and the snow.
