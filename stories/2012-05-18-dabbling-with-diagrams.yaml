    This week I treat Dabbler readers to the unsurpassable beauty of my bird psychology
    diagrams. It occurs to me that these designs would be perfect if applied to, say,
    tea trays, for the ferrying of cups of tea between counter and table in a small,
    shabby seaside cafeteria. Thus, while slurping their tea in between bouts of chronic
    wheezing, the invalids who have come to the seaside resort in a last ditch attempt
    to relieve their hideous illnesses could gain a useful education in certain abstruse
    strains of ornithology, and much good would it do them.'
