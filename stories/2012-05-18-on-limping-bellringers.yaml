  text: "Look at this parade of off-duty bellringers limping into the seaside cafeteria.\
    \ Or don't look. It might be better to avert your eyes. Look instead at the charabanc\
    \ from which they have been debouched. The charabanc driver is leaning against\
    \ his charabanc puffing on a cigarette. He wears a peaked cap which sits uneasily\
    \ on his big blockish head. There is an emblem, an embroidered badge, stitched\
    \ to the front of the cap, consisting of a generic bird silhouette and a Latin\
    \ tag. Neither you nor the charabanc driver know enough Latin to be able to translate\
    \ it. I do. It says \u201CForward To The Seaside!\u201D There is no exclamation\
    \ mark in the Latin original, but I have added one to indicate the imperative.\
    \ The command or aspiration implicit in the slogan has been met. We are indeed\
    \ at the seaside. If there was any doubt, gulls are screeching and briny water\
    \ is sloshing against the posts that support the pier.\nThe cafeteria is alongside,\
    \ but not on, the pier. There is, between them, an amusement arcade. This is a\
    \ place of sin, so we shall shun it. For a moment, when I saw the parade of limping\
    \ bellringers heading in its direction, I feared they would be tempted to enter,\
    \ placing their immortal souls in peril. With what relief, then, to watch them\
    \ continue past it, and go into the cafeteria, every man jack of them, though\
    \ there are women as well as men, among the bellringing party.\nWhy do they limp,\
    \ the bellringers?\nThe charabanc driver is no limper, but he has other problems,\
    \ not unrelated. He has not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, but six,\
    \ yes six!, phantom limbs. In addition to the two legs God has given him, in his\
    \ mind he has a further six legs, upon which he scuttles. His brain is that of\
    \ a spider. It is, thankfully for the rest of us, a very rare mental delusion.\
    \ To the innocent spectator, his gait is unremarkable. Certainly, at this seaside\
    \ scene, the eye is drawn to the limping of the bellringers, not to the pacing\
    \ across the carpark of the charabanc driver, as he stubs his cigarette out under\
    \ his boot and walks off along the promenade. Only within his fantastical spidery\
    \ brain is he scuttling. Only within his fantastical spidery brain is he spinning\
    \ a silken web as he walks. And only within his fantastical spidery brain will\
    \ he entrap in his web a fly, and gobble it up, still living, still breathing.\
    \ It is a wonder such a man can be entrusted to drive a charabanc.\nIn the cafeteria\
    \ the bellringers have come limping to a table and sat around it. They order tea\
    \ and sausages and eggs and ice cream. When the factotum disappears behind a door\
    \ behind the counter to pass their order to the cook, the bellringers each take,\
    \ from the roomy pockets of their blazers, a handbell. Then it is clang clang\
    \ clang for thirty seconds, until the factotum rushes out and demands to know\
    \ what all the racket is in aid of. The oldest and most wizened of the bellringers,\
    \ the one with the most pronounced limp when in motion, explains that they are\
    \ providing seaside cafeteria bellringing entertainment. The factotum waves her\
    \ arms wide, and looks from right to left and from left to right, as if to say,\
    \ but there are no other cafeteria patrons, it is off season, it is pouring with\
    \ rain, who are you entertaining?, for it is surely not me, I am as deaf as a\
    \ post, as is the cook in the kitchen behind the door behind the counter, look\
    \ at the sign in the window.\nThere is a sign in the window of the cafeteria,\
    \ unnoticed by the bellringers, which announces that it is a seaside cafeteria\
    \ for the hard of hearing and the stone deaf, though patrons with good ears are\
    \ also welcome, if they are sympathetic. The limping bellringers are not sympathetic.\
    \ They are sour and indignant. With exaggerated scraping of their chairs upon\
    \ the linoleum and much huffery, they get up from the table and limp their way\
    \ out of the cafeteria, slamming the door behind them. The deaf cook in the kitchen\
    \ has already begun to prepare their sausages and eggs, which will end up in a\
    \ bin for pigs.\nSeveral hundred yards along the promenade, leaning against the\
    \ railings in the rain, the charabanc driver has stopped to smoke another cigarette.\
    \ He is staring at the sea. He sees the sea as a spider might see it, as a vast\
    \ illimitable drowning pool. If the tide were out, he would like to scuttle across\
    \ the wet sands, spinning his fantastical imagined web, trapping tiny seashore\
    \ creatures for his lunch, but the tide is in, the sea is sloshing against the\
    \ great stone wall atop which are placed the railings. The steps down to the sands\
    \ are submerged and slimy. He chucks his cigarette end into the sea. A gull swoops\
    \ to investigate the fallen floating bobbet, then soars away, dissatisfied.\n\
    Now the limping bellringers approach the charabanc driver. They are wearing rainhats.\
    \ Unlike the driver's cap, their hats do not sport an emblem of a generic bird\
    \ silhouette and a Latin tag. They are plain and beige and shapeless. Their spokesman,\
    \ the ancient one, demands they be taken back aboard the charabanc and driven\
    \ to the next resort along the coast. Having nothing better to do, the driver\
    \ agrees. But might I ask, he adds, what has caused you all to be afflicted with\
    \ a limp? No you may not, comes the reply.\nI watch from my seat in the bus shelter\
    \ across the road. I, too, would like to know why they limp. I would like, too,\
    \ to know more about the charabanc driver and his spidery delusions. There is\
    \ much I would like to know, while I wait for the 49. It is a pity, a very great\
    \ pity, that a vandal in the night time smashed the glass on the bus company display\
    \ board at the bus stop and tore down and tore up and scattered to the four winds\
    \ the notice announcing that the 49 would no longer stop here. Later, much later,\
    \ when the rain has ceased, I will give up the ghost and walk to the cafeteria\
    \ and, unsour, unindignant, order tea and sausages and eggs and ice cream. I will\
    \ clang no handbell. By that time, the limping bellringers will be far away, further\
    \ even than the next resort along the coast, caught in the charabanc driver's\
    \ spidery web, damned to perdition."
