  text: "It must be forty years, I think, since last I saw a duck. It is not that\
    \ I have consciously avoided them, though I am willing to admit that I may have\
    \ done so subconsciously. But nothing is more dull than the subconscious, particularly\
    \ one's own, don't you find? Thus I shall pass on the notion that there may have\
    \ been an element of subconscious duck avoidance. The only thing worth saying\
    \ in this connection is that Vladimir Nabokov liked to call Sigmund Freud a \u201C\
    Viennese quack\u201D, and \u201Cquack\u201D, of course, is the usual way we represent\
    \ the characteristic sound made by ducks, in this language at least.\nWhether\
    \ I have avoided them, or they me, the blunt truth is that I have not seen a duck\
    \ since the last years of the war in Vietnam. I did not fight in Vietnam myself\u2014\
    I was too young\u2014nor was that ill-remembered duck I did see, circa 1972, a\
    \ Vietnamese duck, so far as I know. I mention that war merely to give some idea\
    \ of how much time has passed. I could equally say \u201Csince the middle years\
    \ of the Heath government\u201D or \u201Csince the year Ezra Pound died\u201D\
    . Did Ezra Pound ever write a poem about ducks? I do not know his work well enough\
    \ to be able to say. Certainly it will not be anything said, or unsaid, by Pound\
    \ that propelled me into the duckless years.\nAt the time, of course, when I saw\
    \ that teal plashing in a pond in a park, I could not have foreseen that so many\
    \ years would pass without my seeing another duck. Had I known, I might have remarked\
    \ it better. I would probably have made a note in my log book, perhaps essayed\
    \ a little sketch with my propelling pencil. That said, it is better that I did\
    \ not, as I am a hamfisted sketcher at the best of times. My attempt might have\
    \ looked like something other than a teal. There are innumerable sketches in my\
    \ log books, both child and adult, where the subject would be wholly unidentifiable\
    \ had I not added a written caption. I know this because in a surprising number\
    \ of cases I saw no need, at the time, to add a caption, and now, whenever I pore\
    \ over the log books in a fit of nostalgia, I have no idea what in the names of\
    \ all the saints in heaven I am looking at. The sole certainly I can cling to,\
    \ like a drownee to a raft, is that I was not sketching a teal, nor any kind of\
    \ duck, at any time since 1972. That narrows down the possible subject matter,\
    \ but only slightly.\nIf my sketching is so barbarous and cackhanded, one may\
    \ wonder why I have continued to practise it, in my log books, through all these\
    \ years. I could say that it is simply that I am waiting for the lead in my propelling\
    \ pencil to be exhausted. It shows no sign of ever reaching its end. Either it\
    \ is a magic lead that somehow replenishes itself, or goblins replace it while\
    \ I am asleep. There can be no rational explanation.\nIs there, though, a rational\
    \ explanation for my never seeing a duck for forty long years? As I said, I have\
    \ not consciously avoided them, nor their habitats. In a municipal park I often\
    \ prance through, at least once a week, there is even a duckpond. I grant that,\
    \ for at least the past several years it has been drained, and filled with filth\
    \ and litter, it being that kind of park, but one might have expected perhaps\
    \ to find a stray duck investigating the area on the off-chance that volunteers\
    \ of a conservationist bent could have restored it to watery duckponddom. There\
    \ is always the possibility that there is something about me terrifying to ducks,\
    \ and if indeed a stray merganser or pochard were to come waddling into the park\
    \ in hope of finding the duckpond restored to its former glory, they might scarper\
    \ behind a shrub at the first hint of my approach. But why would I terrify a duck?\n\
    It is true that I do not know enough about the inner workings of a duck's brain,\
    \ its psychology, if a duck could be said to have one, to give a coherent answer\
    \ to that question. All I will say is that it seems unlikely that I have certain\
    \ attributes which would cause mental turmoil to ducks. I have never seen a duck\
    \ flee from my presence, nor indeed any other aquatic creature, nor non-aquatic\
    \ creature come to that, except for such beasts as always flee from humans, the\
    \ nervous ones, such as squirrels and some cats. And there are some beasts which,\
    \ on the contrary, seem to be inexplicably attracted to me. I was once pursued,\
    \ on a country lane, for at least a hundred yards, by a gaggle of honking geese.\
    \ That was in the year of the fall of Saigon, the year Dmitri Shostakovich died.\
    \ Did Shostakovich ever write a divertimento about ducks? I do not know his work\
    \ well enough to be able to say. I wish I did.\nYes, I wish I knew more of Shostakovich,\
    \ but would it be equally true to say that I wish I had seen more\u2014seen any\u2014\
    ducks, in the past four decades? Do I feel a gaping absence in my life because\
    \ of a lack of ducks? That is a hard question to answer. But if I give it due\
    \ thought, I suppose the answer has to be No. After all, if my heart was really\
    \ set on seeing some ducks there is nothing to stop me going out in search of\
    \ them. There must be, somewhere in prancing distance, a park with a duckpond\
    \ still extant, one not drained and rife with filth and litter, a duckpond in\
    \ which ducks happily plash. I should put on my hat and coat and walking boots\
    \ right this minute, and crash out the door, and prance the highways and byways\
    \ until I light upon such a park, with such a duckpond, with such ducks. And taking\
    \ from my pocket my current log book, I should make sketches of them, and append\
    \ captions, so that, forty years hence, when poring over them in a fit of nostalgia,\
    \ I will be able to identify them as the ducks I saw in 2012, after a gap of forty\
    \ duckless years.\nThat is what I should do. But instead, I am tempted to make\
    \ a cup of tea, and listen to Shostakovich, and read Ezra Pound, and imagine myself\
    \ in hand to hand combat with the Vietcong. The ducks can wait."
