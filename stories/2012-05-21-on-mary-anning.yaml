  text: '

    A few days ago, reading A Land by Jacquetta Hawkes, I came upon this;

    During a Lyme horse-show a storm developed, and after a terrific flash of lightning
    three people and a baby were seen lying on the ground under an elm tree. The three
    adults were dead, but the baby, Mary Anning, ''upon being put into warm water,
    revived. She had been a dull child before, but after this accident became lively
    and intelligent and grew up so''. Lyme was already conscious of its proximity
    to the past; a local fishmonger displayed million-year-old fishes on the slab
    among the day''s catch, while Mr Anning himself was an established fossil hunter,
    often no doubt bringing back to his shop the fragments of reptilian spines which
    were familiar enough to have acquired the local name of ''Verterberries''. From
    very early years Mary went with him to the cliffs, and when he died, she carried
    on the trade because she and her family needed the money. In 1811... this twelve-year-old
    girl found the first complete ichthyosaur... in another two years she had uncovered
    the first flying reptile or pterodactyl. Perhaps her own favourite was a baby
    plesiosaur.

    This struck me as a fascinating tale--the baby struck by lightning who thereafter
    transcends her humble background (though she remained poor) by making discoveries
    that fundamentally altered our understanding of prehistory. The first person to
    exhume a pterodactyl! I decided then and there to make Mary Anning--of whom I
    had never heard before--the subject of one of my daily essays. And so, today being
    the day allotted to her, I was somewhat astonished to note that she was also the
    subject of today''s random article on the front page of the Wikipedia.

    "My oh my, what a coincidence!", I said to myself. Actually, I said it aloud,
    to Pansy Cradledew, who agreed that it was a startling example of synchronicity.
    Unfortunately, her use of this term led us to a brief discussion of the works
    of Gordon Sumner, who had something to say about synchronicity in the years before
    he turned his attention to playing the lute and having Tantric sex with Trudie
    Styler. To paraphrase H P Lovecraft, the most merciful thing in the world, I think,
    is the inability of the human mind to contemplate the doings of Gordon Sumner
    for more than twenty seconds. After that, at least within my cranium, there is
    a sort of automatic shutdown.

    When I came to, I pondered whether to calculate the probability of the Mary Anning
    hoo-hah. There must be millions of articles on the Wikipedia, and I assume the
    daily random one is selected by some sort of robotic algorithm. My reading of
    A Land was occasioned by a recent article about it in the Grauniad, allied with
    the fact that I had a copy of it, a 1959 Pelican edition, inherited from my father.
    It is a book I have been familiar with all my life, or rather, I have always been
    familiar with its spine--just as Mary Anning was familiar with her father''s collection
    of reptilian spines--on my father''s bookshelves and then on my own. Until I read
    the Grauniad piece, though, I do not think I had ever opened it. There does appear
    to be something inexplicably woohoohoodiwoo about the coincidence.

    If I had the cast of mind of a primitive savage, or a New Age airhead, I might
    be tempted to delve into the possible significance of l''affaire Mary Anning,
    as I am beginning to think of it. Is her shade attempting to contact me from beyond
    the grave? Am I being coaxed into a study of pterodactyls? Which other neglected
    books from my father''s collection should I at long last take down from the bookshelf
    and actually read? Such questions could keep a fool''s brain occupied for aeons,
    or at least until bedtime.

    Instead, I found myself thinking about the millions of articles on the Wikipedia,
    and how, today at least, Hooting Yard and the Wikipedia are as one. We both train
    our beady eyes on Mary Anning. It is true that the Wikipedia has rather more to
    say about her, and might be the preferred website for spotty urchins who, charged
    with writing a school self-esteem ''n'' diversity hub essay entitled What It Feels
    Like To Be Struck By Lightning And Discover A Fossilised Pterodactyl, hasten to
    copy and paste swathes of text so they need neither think nor work. (That all
    too typical essay title, incidentally, would only encourage them to "feel", rather
    than to think. History teaching nowadays appears to be a branch of the "journey"
    undergone by weeping contestants on lack-of-talent shows. Imagine you are a victim
    of oppression by cold heartless empire-builders wearing pith helmets. How do you
    feel? OMG it''s been an incredible journey, innit.) But while the Wikipedia may
    be more informative than Hooting Yard, strictly speaking, here the reader will
    find a slightly different angle of approach, no less valuable in its way.

    And then the further thought occurs that perhaps I ought to strive to replace,
    or at least complement, the Wikipedia, by writing a matching piece for all its
    millions of articles. Of course I would by no means allow other "users" to edit
    my work. We don''t want the hoi polloi and the ignoramuses to come paddling in
    our pond, do we? But slowly, gradually, Hooting Yard could become the default
    reference source on the interweb. I must draw up a schedule, a plan of campaign.
    I could simply write about whatever subject is the Wikipedia''s random article
    of the day, but it might be better to tackle topics in some order of priority.
    That way, I can safely place until the very last, after I have addressed millions
    of other subjects, "Sumner, Gordon : this page is intentionally blank".'
