  text: 'The best laid plans, blah blah blah. Yesterday''s idea that I might take
    as my daily topic the subject of the Wikipedia''s random featured article has
    hit the buffers even before it has begun. Quite frankly, I cannot be expected
    to spin out a thousand words on Ahalya, the wife of the sage Gautama Maharishi
    in Hindu mythology. I''m afraid I have always found Hindu mythology, and Eastern
    religions in general, unbearably tedious. I suspect I would have had a hard time
    of it in the hippie sixties. George Harrison and I would have had little to talk
    about.

    Instead, let us turn our attention to Mayerling.


    Mayerling is a tiny village in Lower Austria on the Schwechat River in the Wienerwald.
    It was in the hunting lodge at Mayerling, on the evening of 29 January 1889, that
    Crown Prince Rudolf, heir to the throne of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and
    his lover Baroness Mary Vetsera, met their deaths. He was thirty, she just seventeen.
    He shot her, and then, some hours later, shot himself. Or he poisoned her and
    then shot himself. Or she poisoned herself and then he shot himself. Or she died
    accidentally in the course of a botched abortion, and he then shot himself. Or
    they were both killed by three intruders, muffled up to the eyes in greatcoats.
    One bashed the Crown Prince on the head with a full champagne bottle, crushing
    his skull, another shot the Baroness. Among the three may have been the brother
    of the Baroness, though it is unclear whether he wielded the bottle or brandished
    the gun, or did neither, the murders being committed by his companions.

    Indeed, the entire episode is unclear, as is apparent from the various possible
    scenarios outlined, all of which have at one time or another been claimed as the
    truth. All we know for certain is that on the following morning the bodies of
    both Rudolf and Mary were discovered by Loschek and Hoyos, valet and hunting companion
    respectively, who smashed the locked door of the lodge with an axe to gain entrance
    after knocking and knocking and knocking to no avail. We know, too, the seething
    passions bubbling beneath the rigid, stultifying protocol of the imperial court.
    Sex and death.

    Oh, and we know something else. Always, in tales of imperial courts and aristocrats
    and the ruling classes, there lurk in the background the valets and factotums
    and servants. We have met Loschek. But a Crown Prince and a Baroness, in that
    world, would not have swanned off to a hunting lodge with a single valet. There
    would have been a retinue, an entourage. This is where the memoirs of Graves come
    in. Though Graves sounds like the name of a valet or butler, in this case we are
    dealing with a German spy who claimed to report directly to the Kaiser. Writing
    in 1916, Dr Armgaard Karl Graves introduces the brothers Max and Otto, trusted
    attendants of the Crown Prince. Probably a step up from valet status, but not
    by much. It is Max who opens the door to the three intruders, while Otto is down
    in the cellar fetching the champagne. In all the subsequent kerfuffle, not only
    do Rudolf and Mary lie dead, but Max, too, shot with the popular Alpine firearm
    the Stutzer, already used on the Baroness. Otto, meanwhile, gets knifed between
    the shoulders with a Hirsch-fanger. He survives, however, and when the intruders
    have fled into the freezing Austrian night, he scribbles an account of the events
    with pencil and paper and pins it to his brother''s corpse. Then he too flees--though
    Graves does not explain why--and, nearly thirty years later, "old, gray and bent..
    is living the quiet life of a hermit and exile not five hundred miles from New
    York City".

    Well, maybe. Graves sounds like a nutter peddling a conspiracy theory, a Mayerling
    "truther". I like that detail--or lack of detail--in "not five hundred miles from
    New York City". There must have been untold Austrians, many of them old and gray
    and bent, living within such a radius in 1916. "Money would never make Otto talk,"
    adds Graves portentously, "but some day the upheaval in Europe may provide an
    occasion when this old retainer of the House of Habsburg may unseal his lips;
    and then woe to the guilty". Guilty woe was something Graves already knew about
    by the time his memoir came out. In 1912, as the so-called "Glasgow Spy", he was
    convicted under the Official Secrets Act in Scotland, having been caught in possession
    of telegraphic codes relating to the British navy. At his trial, he claimed to
    be a medical doctor who had practised in Australia (not Austria). He was sentenced
    to eighteen months. He later turned up in Washington DC (charged with blackmail,
    1916) and Los Angeles (grand theft, 1929). Who knows, maybe he was Otto? That
    might be a theory worth pursuing.

    Another, more gruesome, Mayerling obsessive was a busy bee in the 1990s, a century
    after the murder-suicide or suicide-suicide or double murder or triple murder.
    This was Helmut Flatzelsteiner, a furniture dealer from Linz. At dead of night--wolves
    may have been howling--he broke into the graveyard at Heiligenkreuz Abbey and
    exhumed from their tomb the bones of the Baroness. Two years later--and one shudders
    to think what he was doing with them in the interval--Flatzelsteiner paid for
    a forensic examination, claiming the bones belonged to a long dead relative. He
    later attempted to sell both the forensic report and the skeleton. The remains
    of Mary Vetsera were reinterred, and the Linz furniture dealer was made to pay
    damages to the Abbey.

    The Mayerling Grave Robber Of Linz has not, so far as I know, been made into a
    film, but it ought to be. It might work well as a comedy. Mayerling itself--the
    hamlet, the hunting lodge, the Mitteleuropean murder suicide sex and death drama--now
    belongs, in perpetuity, to the film director Terence Young, whose 1968 costume
    drama starring Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve as the doomed lovers was for
    some reason billed on its original release as Terence Young''s Mayerling. On that
    basis, perhaps I should lay claim right now to Frank Key''s The Mayerling Grave
    Robber Of Linz, and set to work on the screenplay. I think I''d like it to be
    narrated by the ghost of Otto. Or by the shade of Dr Graves.'
