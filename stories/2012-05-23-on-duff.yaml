  text: "Duff, for those you woefully ignorant of its meaning, is all that stuff on\
    \ the forest floor\u2014dead plant material, leaves and bits of bark and needles\
    \ and twigs, that has fallen to the ground and lies there, rotting, rotting. As\
    \ it rots it is enmingled with the top layer of soil and this is what scientists\
    \ call the O horizon. I am not a scientist, so I stick to duff.\nSome would have\
    \ you believe that the duffle or duffel coat is so called because it is made from\
    \ coarse thick woollen material originally made in the Belgian town of Duffel.\
    \ Likewise the duffle or duffel bag. Although this is almost certainly true, and\
    \ not really open to doubt, we should not overlook the fact that long long long\
    \ ago, primitive shambling savages lumbering about the primeval forests fashioned\
    \ for themselves clothing and bags made from the duff on the forest floor, thus\
    \ duff coats and duff bags, easily tweaked to become duffel or duffle by the vagaries\
    \ of human speech.\nOf course, it was all so long ago that no one living has ever\
    \ seen a primitive shambling savage making a coat or bag out of duff. Intuitively,\
    \ one might think the thing would simply fall apart. Perhaps when first gathered\
    \ up from the forest floor, the duff would be wet and sticky and thus hold together.\
    \ But time, heat, drying out, and certain exertions on the part of the savage\
    \ would surely make a duff coat fall to bits soon enough. And one wonders what\
    \ could possibly be carried in a duff bag without it, too, being rendered useless.\n\
    Clearly, then, our primitive shambling savage forest-dwelling ancestors must have\
    \ devised a method of strengthening the matted duff. They may have used rudimentary\
    \ needlework, or perhaps a type of glue or gum. The best way to find out was to\
    \ conduct an experiment. That is why I had myself parachuted, stark naked, into\
    \ a forest. I should point out that the parachute was made of tough synthetic\
    \ twenty-first century fabric, not from duff. I have never argued that primitive\
    \ shambling savages made duff parachutes, so I was not being inconsistent. Once\
    \ I had landed, high in some tree cover, I unhitched myself from my harness and\
    \ clambered down to ground level. I had made an appointment to meet up with my\
    \ research team in twenty-four hours time, in the Cow & Pins, a somewhat insalubrious\
    \ tavern on the edge of the forest.\nStanding naked and alone in the dark dense\
    \ forest, I found it easy to imagine myself a primitive shambling savage in the\
    \ dim and distant past. I grunted a few times. I spotted a tiny wriggling creepy\
    \ crawly on the trunk of a tree and plucked it off and popped it into my mouth\
    \ and chewed it and swallowed it. It tasted foul. I began to feel like a monkey.\
    \ The strange thing is that within five minutes of landing in the forest I had\
    \ actually become primitive and shambling and savage. I quite forgot about my\
    \ appointment. I forgot about my everyday life. I forgot language. I grunted and\
    \ scratched and ate creepy crawlies.\nI might be there still had I not taken the\
    \ precaution of carrying, on a lanyard around my neck, a pochette containing a\
    \ portable metal tapping machine. It buzzed and beeped and I took it out and held\
    \ it in front of me, wonderingly, as if it were a magic box, which, in some ways,\
    \ it is.\n\u201CCalling Mr Key! Calling Mr Key!\u201D\nIn my primitive shambling\
    \ savage state, I was so surprised at the voice issuing from the magic box that\
    \ I dropped it in the duff. The voice grew more urgent, until I picked it up and\
    \ grunted at it.\n\u201CAh, you're there, safely landed I assume?\u201D\nMy brain\
    \ was a chaos, but suddenly I remembered everything. There was a bitter taste\
    \ in my mouth.\n\u201CAck!\u201D I spat, \u201CI've been eating creepy crawlies\
    \ plucked from tree trunks!\u201D I cried.\n\u201CWell there's no time for that.\
    \ You have twenty-three and a half hours until you are to meet us in the Cow &\
    \ Pins, in your duff coat, with your duff bag. Get cracking! Over and out.\u201D\
    \nNext time I conduct an experiment I must remember to appoint a less peremptory\
    \ research team.\nI do not wish to get bogged down in the detail of how I spent\
    \ the next several hours. Let me confess that more than once I prayed to high\
    \ heaven, wishing I were in a provincial town in Belgium rather than in the dark\
    \ dense forest. It is not being melodramatic to say that I knew, more fully than\
    \ ever before, despair. I wept. I howled. I scrabbled in the duff\u2014duff that,\
    \ far from being wet and sticky and holding together at least for a few minutes,\
    \ as I had imagined, was bone dry and frangible and fell through my fingers even\
    \ as I picked it up from the forest floor.\nDo you have any idea how damnably\
    \ difficult it is to stick one tiny fragment of duff to another tiny fragment\
    \ of duff using only some goo that you find smeared here and there on trees and\
    \ leaves? How tiresome it is when you have used up all the available goo and have\
    \ to go plodding off to find more? How in dragging with you your patiently-stuck-together\
    \ duff-fragments they snag on a stray twig and become unstuck and fall apart so\
    \ you have to begin all over again? How the occasional roar of Sabretooth jet\
    \ fighters screaming across the sky over the forest jangles your nerves and makes\
    \ you a butterfingers?\nWith twenty minutes to spare, I trudged into the saloon\
    \ bar of the Cow & Pins to greet my research team. I was dressed in a fetching\
    \ duff coat and duff pantaloons, with a duff cap on my head and duff socks on\
    \ my feet. I had a duff bag slung over my shoulder, empty, because it was too\
    \ weak to carry any weight.\n\u201CMission accomplished!\u201D I yelled.\nIn the\
    \ corner of the pub, there was a gang of scientists sat around a table.\n\u201C\
    Look!\u201D, one piped up, \u201CThe O horizon!\u201D\nAnd they sprang up from\
    \ their chairs and picked me up and carried me off to their science van and drove\
    \ me to their lab, where I have languished ever since, prodded and probed and\
    \ poked at, and fed, now and then, on bitter, bitter creepy crawlies."
