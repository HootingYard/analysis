  text: 'Duff, for those you woefully ignorant of its meaning, is all that stuff on
    the forest floor--dead plant material, leaves and bits of bark and needles and
    twigs, that has fallen to the ground and lies there, rotting, rotting. As it rots
    it is enmingled with the top layer of soil and this is what scientists call the
    O horizon. I am not a scientist, so I stick to duff.

    Some would have you believe that the duffle or duffel coat is so called because
    it is made from coarse thick woollen material originally made in the Belgian town
    of Duffel. Likewise the duffle or duffel bag. Although this is almost certainly
    true, and not really open to doubt, we should not overlook the fact that long
    long long ago, primitive shambling savages lumbering about the primeval forests
    fashioned for themselves clothing and bags made from the duff on the forest floor,
    thus duff coats and duff bags, easily tweaked to become duffel or duffle by the
    vagaries of human speech.

    Of course, it was all so long ago that no one living has ever seen a primitive
    shambling savage making a coat or bag out of duff. Intuitively, one might think
    the thing would simply fall apart. Perhaps when first gathered up from the forest
    floor, the duff would be wet and sticky and thus hold together. But time, heat,
    drying out, and certain exertions on the part of the savage would surely make
    a duff coat fall to bits soon enough. And one wonders what could possibly be carried
    in a duff bag without it, too, being rendered useless.

    Clearly, then, our primitive shambling savage forest-dwelling ancestors must have
    devised a method of strengthening the matted duff. They may have used rudimentary
    needlework, or perhaps a type of glue or gum. The best way to find out was to
    conduct an experiment. That is why I had myself parachuted, stark naked, into
    a forest. I should point out that the parachute was made of tough synthetic twenty-first
    century fabric, not from duff. I have never argued that primitive shambling savages
    made duff parachutes, so I was not being inconsistent. Once I had landed, high
    in some tree cover, I unhitched myself from my harness and clambered down to ground
    level. I had made an appointment to meet up with my research team in twenty-four
    hours time, in the Cow & Pins, a somewhat insalubrious tavern on the edge of the
    forest.

    Standing naked and alone in the dark dense forest, I found it easy to imagine
    myself a primitive shambling savage in the dim and distant past. I grunted a few
    times. I spotted a tiny wriggling creepy crawly on the trunk of a tree and plucked
    it off and popped it into my mouth and chewed it and swallowed it. It tasted foul.
    I began to feel like a monkey. The strange thing is that within five minutes of
    landing in the forest I had actually become primitive and shambling and savage.
    I quite forgot about my appointment. I forgot about my everyday life. I forgot
    language. I grunted and scratched and ate creepy crawlies.

    I might be there still had I not taken the precaution of carrying, on a lanyard
    around my neck, a pochette containing a portable metal tapping machine. It buzzed
    and beeped and I took it out and held it in front of me, wonderingly, as if it
    were a magic box, which, in some ways, it is.

    "Calling Mr Key! Calling Mr Key!"

    In my primitive shambling savage state, I was so surprised at the voice issuing
    from the magic box that I dropped it in the duff. The voice grew more urgent,
    until I picked it up and grunted at it.

    "Ah, you''re there, safely landed I assume?"

    My brain was a chaos, but suddenly I remembered everything. There was a bitter
    taste in my mouth.

    "Ack!" I spat, "I''ve been eating creepy crawlies plucked from tree trunks!" I
    cried.

    "Well there''s no time for that. You have twenty-three and a half hours until
    you are to meet us in the Cow & Pins, in your duff coat, with your duff bag. Get
    cracking! Over and out."

    Next time I conduct an experiment I must remember to appoint a less peremptory
    research team.

    I do not wish to get bogged down in the detail of how I spent the next several
    hours. Let me confess that more than once I prayed to high heaven, wishing I were
    in a provincial town in Belgium rather than in the dark dense forest. It is not
    being melodramatic to say that I knew, more fully than ever before, despair. I
    wept. I howled. I scrabbled in the duff--duff that, far from being wet and sticky
    and holding together at least for a few minutes, as I had imagined, was bone dry
    and frangible and fell through my fingers even as I picked it up from the forest
    floor.

    Do you have any idea how damnably difficult it is to stick one tiny fragment of
    duff to another tiny fragment of duff using only some goo that you find smeared
    here and there on trees and leaves? How tiresome it is when you have used up all
    the available goo and have to go plodding off to find more? How in dragging with
    you your patiently-stuck-together duff-fragments they snag on a stray twig and
    become unstuck and fall apart so you have to begin all over again? How the occasional
    roar of Sabretooth jet fighters screaming across the sky over the forest jangles
    your nerves and makes you a butterfingers?

    With twenty minutes to spare, I trudged into the saloon bar of the Cow & Pins
    to greet my research team. I was dressed in a fetching duff coat and duff pantaloons,
    with a duff cap on my head and duff socks on my feet. I had a duff bag slung over
    my shoulder, empty, because it was too weak to carry any weight.

    "Mission accomplished!" I yelled.

    In the corner of the pub, there was a gang of scientists sat around a table.

    "Look!", one piped up, "The O horizon!"

    And they sprang up from their chairs and picked me up and carried me off to their
    science van and drove me to their lab, where I have languished ever since, prodded
    and probed and poked at, and fed, now and then, on bitter, bitter creepy crawlies.'
