  text: 'Now here is an intriguing (if ungrammatical) headline:

    Goblins attacks family, burn down homestead

    Readers will be aware that I take a keen interest in goblins of all types. These
    ones are new to me:

    Others went on to claim that snake-like creatures wearing sunglasses, a suit and
    a pair of shoes had been seen at the homestead.

    Truly baffling. What type of snake-like being could wear shoes? Sounds like a
    job for Investigating Officer David Icke.'
