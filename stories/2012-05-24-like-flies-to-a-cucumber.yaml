  text: "To keep flies off your paintings and hangings. An Italian conceipte both\
    \ for the rareness and use thereof doth please me above all other: viz: pricke\
    \ a cowcumber full of barley corns with the small spring ends outwards, make little\
    \ holes in the cowcumber first with a wooden or bone bodkin, and after put in\
    \ the grain, these being thicke placed will in time cover all the cowcumber, so\
    \ as no man can discerne what strange plant the same should be. Such cowcumbers\
    \ to be hung up in the middest of summer rooms to drawe all the flies unto them,\
    \ which otherwise would flie upon the pictures or hangings.\nHugh Plat, Delightes\
    \ For Ladies, c.1602\nHugh Plat\u2026 does not quite make it clear that the wheat\
    \ stuck into the cucumber would quickly sprout and cover the fruit in a coat of\
    \ young shoots. This must have looked like some exotic sea creature hanging from\
    \ a chandelier at the centre of a room. It would, no doubt, have grown increasingly\
    \ strange as the cucumber gradually dried and rotted, and the barley shoots withered.\n\
    from The Curious Cookbook : Viper Soup, Badger Ham, Stewed Sparrows & 100 More\
    \ Historic Recipes by Peter Ross (2012). I thoroughly recommend this splendid\
    \ new book, published by the British Library, not least because Dr Ross is my\
    \ oldest friend\u2014we met when we were eleven years old. Obtain a copy, and\
    \ you too will be able to make what is possibly the world's most complicated recipe\u2014\
    cheese and biscuits (with chutney) \xE0 \_la Jack Warner. Yes, that Jack Warner,\
    \ beloved by all as Dixon of Dock Green."
