  text: 'To keep flies off your paintings and hangings. An Italian conceipte both
    for the rareness and use thereof doth please me above all other: viz: pricke a
    cowcumber full of barley corns with the small spring ends outwards, make little
    holes in the cowcumber first with a wooden or bone bodkin, and after put in the
    grain, these being thicke placed will in time cover all the cowcumber, so as no
    man can discerne what strange plant the same should be. Such cowcumbers to be
    hung up in the middest of summer rooms to drawe all the flies unto them, which
    otherwise would flie upon the pictures or hangings.

    Hugh Plat, Delightes For Ladies, c.1602

    Hugh Plat... does not quite make it clear that the wheat stuck into the cucumber
    would quickly sprout and cover the fruit in a coat of young shoots. This must
    have looked like some exotic sea creature hanging from a chandelier at the centre
    of a room. It would, no doubt, have grown increasingly strange as the cucumber
    gradually dried and rotted, and the barley shoots withered.

    from The Curious Cookbook : Viper Soup, Badger Ham, Stewed Sparrows & 100 More
    Historic Recipes by Peter Ross (2012). I thoroughly recommend this splendid new
    book, published by the British Library, not least because Dr Ross is my oldest
    friend--we met when we were eleven years old. Obtain a copy, and you too will
    be able to make what is possibly the world''s most complicated recipe--cheese
    and biscuits (with chutney) a  la Jack Warner. Yes, that Jack Warner, beloved
    by all as Dixon of Dock Green.'
