  text: 'Tarleton was visited in his consulting rooms one April evening by a padding
    fellow clutching a buff envelope.

    Glossary :

    Tarleton, "the amateur''s amateur".

    Consulting rooms, address unknown but probably in an ill-lit alleyway off the
    main thoroughfare in Pointy Town.

    April, fourth month of the year. Abolished during the French Revolution and replaced
    by Germinal (to 19 April) and Floreal (from 20 April). Tarleton''s internal "clock"
    was regulated accordingly, though not for ideological reasons.

    Evening, latter part of the day, descending into dusk and twilight and, eventually,
    nightfall, wherein terrors are unloosed (see Thomas Nashe, Terrors Of The Night,
    1594).

    Padding, moving like a cat.

    Buff envelope, an item of stationery, not to be confused with the Buff Orpington,
    a type of duck.

    "Why are you padding into my consulting rooms clutching a duck?" asked Tarleton.
    Then, putting on his spectacles, he added, "I beg your pardon, I ought to say
    clutching an envelope."

    "Within this buff envelope," said the visitor, "Are papers which, if revealed
    to the press, could bring about the collapse of several crowned heads, and seething
    unrest throughout the continent!"

    Glossary:

    Then, here indicating the next action or event in a sequence. Can also refer to
    the past, as in the model sentence "I was happy then, in my childhood, before
    the revolution, before the shambles wrought by our new masters".

    Spectacles, eyeglasses, two monocles stuck together with connecting wire. Often
    rose-tinted, though not in Tarleton''s case.

    Papers, top secret quasi-official documents of world-shuddering significance.

    The press, generic term for newspapers, both tabloid and broadsheet, even, great
    heavens to Betsy, Berliner format!, not to be confused with Papers (see above).

    Collapse, can happen to puddings and souffles if cooking times go awry.

    Crowned heads, done away with, violently, during revolutionary upheavals.

    Unrest, second album by Henry Cow, released in 1974. Sock on cover.

    Continent, seven known to exist, in alphabetical order Africa, Antarctica, Asia,
    Australia, Europe, North America, South America. There may be others, hidden or
    occult. Continental location of Tarleton''s consulting rooms not yet identified
    beyond every shadow of a doubt (Alfred Hitchcock, 1943).

    "Good grief!" spluttered Tarleton''s sidekick Not-Tarleton, sprawled on a beanbag
    by the fireplace, "If what you say is true we must act immediately to stop the
    collapse and unrest in their tracks!"

    An enigmatic smile played over Tarleton''s lips.

    "May I have the buff envelope?" he asked the visitor.

    Glossary:

    Grief, Hardship, suffering; a kind, or cause, of hardship or suffering. Hurt,
    harm, mischief or injury done or caused by another; damaged inflicted or suffered;
    molestation, trouble, offence. A wrong or injury which is the subject of formal
    complaint or demand for redress. Gravity, grievousness (of an offence). Feeling
    of offence; displeasure, anger. A bodily injury or ailment; a morbid affection
    of any part of the body; a sore, wound; a blemish of the skin; a disease, sickness.
    The seat of disease; the diseased part; the sore place. Physical pain or discomfort.
    Mental pain, distress, or sorrow. Deep or violent sorrow, caused by loss or trouble;
    a keen or bitter feeling of regret for something lost, remorse for something done,
    or sorrow for mishap to oneself or others. Accidents in steeplechasing or in the
    hunting-field. Also in Golf. (OED). Not-Tarleton''s usage encompasses all these
    meanings, and more, oh! so many more, for he is that kind of chap, sprawled on
    his beanbag, spluttering.

    Sidekick, a companion, colleague, junior partner, straight man.

    Not-Tarleton, specifically in this case, Tarleton''s sidekick. More generally,
    can be applied to any organism, animate or inanimate, other than Tarleton himself.
    Thus, everything in the universe. Space precludes a complete list.

    Beanbag, a large sealed bag containing synthetic beans, upon which to sprawl.
    Similar to the "Protean armchair" in The Confidence-Man : His Masquerade by Herman
    Melville (1857).

    Fireplace, as the name suggests, a place of fire, of licking flames, of heat and
    blaze. Often located within an inglenook. Beanbags (see above) ought only be placed
    near to inglenooks if they are fire-resistant, otherwise a single spark from a
    hissing spitting coal upon the fire and, pfft!, up they go in flames. For fictional
    treatments of the catastrophic effects of fire upon persons, see Dickens, in particular
    Miss Havisham and Krook.

    Tracks, "So take a good look at my face / You''ll see my smile looks out of place
    / If you look closer, it''s easy to trace / The tracks of my tears" (The Tracks
    Of My Tears, Smokey Robinson And The Miracles, 1965). In The Song Of Investment
    Capital Overseas (1981), the Art Bears hint at tracks without quite mentioning
    them : "The roads and rails run like cracks / And carry me upon their backs".

    Enigmatic smile, cliche used to impart spurious depth to a fictional character.

    Lips, important parts of the mouth.

    Buff envelope, remember not to confuse it with a Buff Orpington duck.

    Hesitantly, the visitor handed the buff envelope to Tarleton. Without opening
    it, he in turn passed it to Not-Tarleton, still sprawled on a beanbag by the fireplace.

    "Toss it on to the fire!" he commanded.

    Not-Tarleton did as he was bid, and within seconds the buff envelope, and its
    mysterious world-shuddering contents, were consumed by the awful flames.

    "I think we can say that the world is a safer place," said Tarleton, smugly. "Now,
    shall we toast some crumpets?"

    Glossary:

    It would be a shame to add a further gloss on terms at this point. We would distract
    from the thrilling climax of the tale, and in any case few new words have been
    introduced. Hesitantly, toss, bid, awful, toast and crumpets can be looked up
    in any decent dictionary, and sometimes it is beneficial for readers to take the
    initiative, rather than having everything handed to them on a plate.

    Glossary:

    Plate, or platter, an item of crockery on which toasted crumpets are served in
    the consulting room of Tarleton, the amateur''s amateur, at the conclusion of
    the famous story Tarleton And The Mysterious Affair Of The Buff Orpington Envelope.'
