  text: "Tarleton was visited in his consulting rooms one April evening by a padding\
    \ fellow clutching a buff envelope.\nGlossary :\nTarleton, \"the amateur's amateur\"\
    .\nConsulting rooms, address unknown but probably in an ill-lit alleyway off the\
    \ main thoroughfare in Pointy Town.\nApril, fourth month of the year. Abolished\
    \ during the French Revolution and replaced by Germinal (to 19 April) and Floreal\
    \ (from 20 April). Tarleton's internal \"clock\" was regulated accordingly, though\
    \ not for ideological reasons.\nEvening, latter part of the day, descending into\
    \ dusk and twilight and, eventually, nightfall, wherein terrors are unloosed (see\
    \ Thomas Nashe, Terrors Of The Night, 1594).\nPadding, moving like a cat.\nBuff\
    \ envelope, an item of stationery, not to be confused with the Buff Orpington,\
    \ a type of duck.\n\"Why are you padding into my consulting rooms clutching a\
    \ duck?\" asked Tarleton. Then, putting on his spectacles, he added, \"I beg your\
    \ pardon, I ought to say clutching an envelope.\"\n\"Within this buff envelope,\"\
    \ said the visitor, \"Are papers which, if revealed to the press, could bring\
    \ about the collapse of several crowned heads, and seething unrest throughout\
    \ the continent!\"\nGlossary:\nThen, here indicating the next action or event\
    \ in a sequence. Can also refer to the past, as in the model sentence \"I was\
    \ happy then, in my childhood, before the revolution, before the shambles wrought\
    \ by our new masters\".\nSpectacles, eyeglasses, two monocles stuck together with\
    \ connecting wire. Often rose-tinted, though not in Tarleton's case.\nPapers,\
    \ top secret quasi-official documents of world-shuddering significance.\nThe press,\
    \ generic term for newspapers, both tabloid and broadsheet, even, great heavens\
    \ to Betsy, Berliner format!, not to be confused with Papers (see above).\nCollapse,\
    \ can happen to puddings and souffles if cooking times go awry.\nCrowned heads,\
    \ done away with, violently, during revolutionary upheavals.\nUnrest, second album\
    \ by Henry Cow, released in 1974. Sock on cover.\nContinent, seven known to exist,\
    \ in alphabetical order Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America,\
    \ South America. There may be others, hidden or occult. Continental location of\
    \ Tarleton's consulting rooms not yet identified beyond every shadow of a doubt\
    \ (Alfred Hitchcock, 1943).\n\"Good grief!\" spluttered Tarleton's sidekick Not-Tarleton,\
    \ sprawled on a beanbag by the fireplace, \"If what you say is true we must act\
    \ immediately to stop the collapse and unrest in their tracks!\"\nAn enigmatic\
    \ smile played over Tarleton's lips.\n\"May I have the buff envelope?\" he asked\
    \ the visitor.\nGlossary:\nGrief, Hardship, suffering; a kind, or cause, of hardship\
    \ or suffering. Hurt, harm, mischief or injury done or caused by another; damaged\
    \ inflicted or suffered; molestation, trouble, offence. A wrong or injury which\
    \ is the subject of formal complaint or demand for redress. Gravity, grievousness\
    \ (of an offence). Feeling of offence; displeasure, anger. A bodily injury or\
    \ ailment; a morbid affection of any part of the body; a sore, wound; a blemish\
    \ of the skin; a disease, sickness. The seat of disease; the diseased part; the\
    \ sore place. Physical pain or discomfort. Mental pain, distress, or sorrow. Deep\
    \ or violent sorrow, caused by loss or trouble; a keen or bitter feeling of regret\
    \ for something lost, remorse for something done, or sorrow for mishap to oneself\
    \ or others. Accidents in steeplechasing or in the hunting-field. Also in Golf.\
    \ (OED). Not-Tarleton's usage encompasses all these meanings, and more, oh! so\
    \ many more, for he is that kind of chap, sprawled on his beanbag, spluttering.\n\
    Sidekick, a companion, colleague, junior partner, straight man.\nNot-Tarleton,\
    \ specifically in this case, Tarleton's sidekick. More generally, can be applied\
    \ to any organism, animate or inanimate, other than Tarleton himself. Thus, everything\
    \ in the universe. Space precludes a complete list.\nBeanbag, a large sealed bag\
    \ containing synthetic beans, upon which to sprawl. Similar to the \"Protean armchair\"\
    \ in The Confidence-Man : His Masquerade by Herman Melville (1857).\nFireplace,\
    \ as the name suggests, a place of fire, of licking flames, of heat and blaze.\
    \ Often located within an inglenook. Beanbags (see above) ought only be placed\
    \ near to inglenooks if they are fire-resistant, otherwise a single spark from\
    \ a hissing spitting coal upon the fire and, pfft!, up they go in flames. For\
    \ fictional treatments of the catastrophic effects of fire upon persons, see Dickens,\
    \ in particular Miss Havisham and Krook.\nTracks, \"So take a good look at my\
    \ face / You'll see my smile looks out of place / If you look closer, it's easy\
    \ to trace / The tracks of my tears\" (The Tracks Of My Tears, Smokey Robinson\
    \ And The Miracles, 1965). In The Song Of Investment Capital Overseas (1981),\
    \ the Art Bears hint at tracks without quite mentioning them : \"The roads and\
    \ rails run like cracks / And carry me upon their backs\".\nEnigmatic smile, cliche\
    \ used to impart spurious depth to a fictional character.\nLips, important parts\
    \ of the mouth.\nBuff envelope, remember not to confuse it with a Buff Orpington\
    \ duck.\nHesitantly, the visitor handed the buff envelope to Tarleton. Without\
    \ opening it, he in turn passed it to Not-Tarleton, still sprawled on a beanbag\
    \ by the fireplace.\n\"Toss it on to the fire!\" he commanded.\nNot-Tarleton did\
    \ as he was bid, and within seconds the buff envelope, and its mysterious world-shuddering\
    \ contents, were consumed by the awful flames.\n\"I think we can say that the\
    \ world is a safer place,\" said Tarleton, smugly. \"Now, shall we toast some\
    \ crumpets?\"\nGlossary:\n  It would be a shame to add a further gloss on terms\
    \ at this point. We would distract from the thrilling climax of the tale, and\
    \ in any case few new words have been introduced. Hesitantly, toss, bid, awful,\
    \ toast and crumpets can be looked up in any decent dictionary, and sometimes\
    \ it is beneficial for readers to take the initiative, rather than having everything\
    \ handed to them on a plate.\nGlossary:\nPlate, or platter, an item of crockery\
    \ on which toasted crumpets are served in the consulting room of Tarleton, the\
    \ amateur's amateur, at the conclusion of the famous story Tarleton And The Mysterious\
    \ Affair Of The Buff Orpington Envelope."
