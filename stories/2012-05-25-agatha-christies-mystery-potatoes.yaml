  text: "I mentioned yesterday Jack Warner's fantastic cheese-and-biscuits recipe,\
    \ included in The Curious Cookbook by Peter Ross. The original source is a wartime\
    \ collection entitled A Kitchen Goes To War\_: Famous People Contribute 150 Recipes\
    \ To A Ration-Time Cookery Book (1940). Among the other dishes is the splendidly-named\
    \ Agatha Christie's Mystery Potatoes. I was intending to transcribe the recipe\
    \ here, then realised that in so doing I would shatter the mystery, so instead\
    \ I will urge\u2014or indeed egg you on\u2014to buy the book.\nMeanwhile, you\
    \ might be interested in making imitation bacon out of marzipan. Who wouldn't\
    \ be?\nTake some of your marchpane [marzipan] Paste, and work it in red saunders\
    \ [sandalwood\u2014a red dye] till it be red; then rowl a broad sheet of white\
    \ paste, and a sheet of red paste; three of the white and four of the red, and\
    \ so one upon the other in mingled sorts, every red between, then cut it overthwart,\
    \ till it look like collops [slices] of bacon, then dry it.\nThat is from A Queen's\
    \ Delight of 1671, and given the title I suggest you make some to celebrate the\
    \ Diamond Jubilee.\n\nThe Queen Of Crime, contemplating her mysterious potatoes"
