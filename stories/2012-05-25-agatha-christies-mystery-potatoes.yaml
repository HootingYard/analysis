  text: 'I mentioned yesterday Jack Warner''s fantastic cheese-and-biscuits recipe,
    included in The Curious Cookbook by Peter Ross. The original source is a wartime
    collection entitled A Kitchen Goes To War : Famous People Contribute 150 Recipes
    To A Ration-Time Cookery Book (1940). Among the other dishes is the splendidly-named
    Agatha Christie''s Mystery Potatoes. I was intending to transcribe the recipe
    here, then realised that in so doing I would shatter the mystery, so instead I
    will urge--or indeed egg you on--to buy the book.

    Meanwhile, you might be interested in making imitation bacon out of marzipan.
    Who wouldn''t be?

    Take some of your marchpane [marzipan] Paste, and work it in red saunders [sandalwood--a
    red dye] till it be red; then rowl a broad sheet of white paste, and a sheet of
    red paste; three of the white and four of the red, and so one upon the other in
    mingled sorts, every red between, then cut it overthwart, till it look like collops
    [slices] of bacon, then dry it.

    That is from A Queen''s Delight of 1671, and given the title I suggest you make
    some to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee.
