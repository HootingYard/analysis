  text: 'Imagine for a moment that you have a pet swan. What would you call it? Alan?
    Belinda? Clive? Dot? I could continue through the alphabet, but I won''t, not
    for the time being. If I did, we would soon enough get to J. I like to think that
    I would not, at that juncture, pick the name Jack. Not for a swan. It doesn''t
    seem right. Yet that is the name Anna Pavlova gave to her swan, as can be seen
    in this tremendous photograph, kindly sent to me by David Cranmer. Click for gigantic
    version.
