  text: 'Tarleton, the amateur''s amateur, had been missing for a fortnight when one
    evening he came crashing through the door of his consulting rooms, twitching and
    shattered.

    "Good grief, Tarleton!" cried his sidekick, companion, amanuensis and consulting
    roommate, Not-Tarleton, "Where in blazes have you been?"

    "I have been muffled, wallowing in the sink of vice that is a Limehouse opium
    den, if you must know," said Tarleton, "I was in pursuit of a man with a twisted
    lip."

    "I... I... corwumph!" expostulated Not-Tarleton, who resembled, in both manner
    and appearance, Old Wilkie from Linbury Court, so much so, indeed, that we shall
    hereinafter refer to him as Old Wilkie in order to avoid confusion with his near-namesake
    Tarleton.

    "Corwumph! away to your heart''s content. You know my methods," said Tarleton,
    "The man with the twisted lip was in possession of pelf. I could tell it was pelf
    because he carried it in a sack slung over his shoulder with the word PELF stencilled
    upon it in big black block capitals. I pursued him through the streets and mews
    and boulevards. He was hot under the collar. I dogged his every footstep. The
    sky was overcast. He entered the stews of Limehouse and still I followed him.
    He scuttled down an insalubrious alleyway. It was a nest of opium dens. Mayhew
    surveyed them at one time or another, I am sure."

    "And?" shouted Old Wilkie.

    "And I spent a fortnight in an opium-addled daze, from which I have only recently
    emerged. The man with the twisted lip was nowhere to be seen. But while we were
    both sprawled upon divans in the Oriental hellhole, I affixed to his ankle, unbeknown
    to him, a tracking device, which works with light reflecting booster technology
    developed by L''Oreal. I am going to eat some kippers, and then I shall find out
    where he is, with his sack o'' pelf. Having located him, I will run him to ground.
    If he digs himself into a burrow in the ground, like the narrator of Rogue Male
    by Geoffrey Household, I will entrap him, as did Quive-Smith, but I shall ensure
    I do not meet Quive-Smith''s sticky end."

    "But how, Tarleton? How?" screamed Old Wilkie.

    "By wearing this metal head-harness," said Tarleton, donning a metal head-harness,
    "If the man with the twisted lip tries to kill me by shooting an arrow between
    my eyes from an improvised crossbow, it will ping harmlessly against the metal."

    "I... I... corwumph!" screeched Old Wilkie, "Was the head-harness also developed
    by L''Oreal?"

    But answer came there none, for the amateur''s amateur was already gone.

    He returned some weeks later, twitching and shattered.

    "As soon as I have eaten some kippers, I shall apprise you of my doings," he announced,
    and as soon as he had eaten some kippers, he apprised Old Wilkie of his doings.
    Being, among other things, his amanuensis, Old Wilkie wrote down what he heard,
    and thus it is that we, too, are apprised of Tarleton''s doings, long after he
    ate some kippers.

    It seems that, shortly before seeing the man with the twisted lip hauling his
    sack of pelf along the streets and mews and boulevards, Tarleton had been approached
    by Old Farmer Frack. The mad old farmer was distraught, because his eerie barn
    had been broken into and all his farm implements and equipment, stored therein,
    his clodding mell and two Kentish binding rakes and a disc coulter and a subsoil
    pulveriser plough and a potato grading shovel and five Morris''s turnip fly catchers
    and two hand-cranked threshers and a seed rusky and an automatic sheaf tying mechanism
    and a whin bruiser and Keevil''s cheese-making apparatus and a mouldbaert and
    fan tackle and chogger and a Nellis fork and a plough graip and half a dozen liquid
    manure pumps and a pair of hedger''s gloves and Gilbert''s improved iron sack
    holder and four American butter separators and a cauterising iron and a mouth
    cramp and a charlock slasher and Blurton''s tumbling cheese rack and eight barley
    hummellers and an adze and a curd agitator and grinding stones and Drummond''s
    iron harvest sickle and a dairymaid''s yoke and a clod knocker and Biddell''s
    scarifier and Fowler''s self-adjusting anchor and a bitting iron and fifteen creels
    and two caschroms and a dung hack and a Crees lactator and five horn trainers
    and a fagging stick and a pea hook and two Lipmann glass stoppers and a trenching
    fork and Gilbee''s horse hoe and a drain ladle and hackle prongs and a flax brake
    and Hall''s smut machine and a heckling board and three flauchter spades and a
    hay tedder and an Ivel three-wheeled petrol-powered machine and Finlayson''s grubber
    and a potato riddle and four root pulpers and paring mattocks and Morton''s revolving
    harrow and Samuelson''s cake-breaking machine and a foot pick and sheep netting
    and two oilcake crushers and Reade''s patent syringe and various instruments for
    destroying moles and a barrow turnip slicer and a Paul net and a Sandwich clean-sweep
    hay-loader and probangs and castrating shears and Hannaford''s wet wheat pickling
    machine and a scutching board and a swath turner and a plank-drag harrow, had
    been stolen.

    Tarleton put two and two together. It was blindingly obvious that the man with
    the twisted lip was the thief. He had sold Old Farmer Frack''s barn''s-worth of
    booty to a fence, and put the pelf in his sack. It was, then, a simple matter
    of finding the fence and bludgeoning him to death using one of the instruments
    for destroying moles, and restoring to the mad old farmer his rightful possessions.

    "Just one question, Tarleton," said Old Wilkie, "These various instruments for
    destroying moles. Were any of them developed by L''Oreal?"

    But answer came there none, for the amateur''s amateur, his mouth stuffed with
    some more kippers, had fled to a Limehouse opium den, to wallow in vice, sprawled
    on a divan.'
