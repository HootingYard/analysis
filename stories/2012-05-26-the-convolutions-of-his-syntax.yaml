  text: "His students realised that they had a legend on their hands, and made the\
    \ most of it. Dozens of stories circulated about his rumbustious asides, his impossible\
    \ handwriting, the convolutions of his syntax.*\n* In the Saintsbury Memorial\
    \ Volume a former student recalls learning a specimen sentence by heart: \u2018\
    But while none, save these, of men living, had done, or could have done, such\
    \ things, there was much here which\u2014whether either could have done it or\
    \ not\u2014neither had done.\u2019\nGeorge Saintsbury (1845\u20131933) recalled\
    \ in The Rise And Fall Of The Man Of Letters by John Gross (1969)"
