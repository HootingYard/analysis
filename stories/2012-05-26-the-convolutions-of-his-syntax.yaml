  text: 'His students realised that they had a legend on their hands, and made the
    most of it. Dozens of stories circulated about his rumbustious asides, his impossible
    handwriting, the convolutions of his syntax.*

    * In the Saintsbury Memorial Volume a former student recalls learning a specimen
    sentence by heart: ''But while none, save these, of men living, had done, or could
    have done, such things, there was much here which--whether either could have done
    it or not--neither had done.''

    George Saintsbury (1845-1933) recalled in The Rise And Fall Of The Man Of Letters
    by John Gross (1969)'
