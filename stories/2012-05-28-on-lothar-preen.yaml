  text: "One two three four five six seven. All good children go to heaven.\n  Eight\
    \ nine ten eleven twelve thirteen. That won't be the fate of Lothar Preen.\nThis\
    \ pretty little rhyme was devised by the maestro himself, Lothar Preen, he of\
    \ the majestic bouffant, flailing baton, psychopathic personality disorder, and\
    \ criminal associations in the dockyard taverns of the Marseilles underworld.\
    \ One can see here Preen the self-mythologiser, relishing his seemingly inevitable\
    \ descent into the bowels of hell. There will be no heaven for him.\nWe do not\
    \ of course know what became of Lothar Preen after death, save that his corpse\
    \ was eaten by worms. So great had his legend grown that his grave, in the pretty\
    \ little churchyard at St Bibblybibdib's, was dug up, a few months after he had\
    \ been buried, just to make sure he was actually dead and gone. That is when they\
    \ saw the worms, gobbling up what was left of the maestro, by the light of their\
    \ tarry torches on a foul October night. The churchyard did not look so pretty\
    \ then.\nSome said that is how he would be remembered, as supper for worms--the\
    \ worms that had even gnawed through his conductor's baton, which was buried with\
    \ him, alongside his favourite tea-strainer and oodles upon oodles of unpaid bills.\
    \ But of course that is not why we remember Lothar Preen today. We remember him\
    \ for the magnificent recordings of The Phlogiston Variations, of Clamp's Fifth,\
    \ of The Pretty Little Tea-Strainers song cycle. We remember him, too, for the\
    \ incident in a Marseilles dockyard tavern when he stabbed a rival maestro in\
    \ the eye, as if he were Marlowe, and for the many many wells he poisoned, and\
    \ for feeding that cellist into a sausage mincer. He was never convicted of any\
    \ of these crimes, for it was said he committed them when the balance of his mind\
    \ was disturbed, when he was unhinged. But quite frankly, was he ever hinged,\
    \ from the moment he first became conscious, in the pretty little convent hospital\
    \ of St Spivack's, as his mother lay dying?\nHis childhood alone is a tale of\
    \ unhingements, best avoided by those without strong stomachs. For every example\
    \ of precocious musical genius, there are twenty or thirty murders, stabbings,\
    \ slicings, loppings, poisonings, stranglings, and other gruesome and grisly doings.\
    \ Few people have been able to read his memoir, A Childhood Of Precocious Musical\
    \ Genius And Murderous Psychotic Unhingement, without keeping a bucket beside\
    \ them in which to vomit.\nVomit, indeed, seems to have played an important part\
    \ in the life of the adult Preen, if we are to believe his accounts of riotous\
    \ carousing in the more insalubrious taverns down at the Marseilles docks. It\
    \ was in such squalor the maestro would hold court, his bouffant a thing of blinding\
    \ grandeur. When he was not stabbing rival maestri in the eyes, he was jabbing\
    \ at them verbally, taunting them with his superior baton flailing technique,\
    \ or simply waiting for them to keel over drunk before giving them a good kicking\
    \ in the head. It is part of the legend that at no time did he ever pay for a\
    \ single drink during these nights of high debauch.\nHis finances, or lack of\
    \ them, were always a mystery, and in the years since his death various lawyers\
    \ and accountants have been kept busy untangling the chaos he left behind. There\
    \ are claims that Preen's Byzantine wheeler-dealings are at the root of the world's\
    \ current financial meltdown. That one man could be responsible for the global\
    \ chaos seems on the face of it absurd, until we pause to consider that the man\
    \ was Lothar Preen. Of what was he not capable?\nThis is a man, remember, who\
    \ quite apart from all the murders and stabbings and slicings and loppings and\
    \ poisonings and stranglings and other grim and grisly doings, was capable, in\
    \ what we might call his more humane moments, of gathering together thousands\
    \ of pretty little birds--siskins and linnets and wrens and hummingbirds and jackdaws--and\
    \ training them to sing the long, complex, and breathtakingly beautiful choruses\
    \ from Prog's comic opera based on the life of Charles Hawtrey (1914-1988). That\
    \ the maestro devised his own grand finale, in which the birds are savaged by\
    \ cats and then electrocuted one by one, we may deplore yet recognise as a characteristic\
    \ and ineffable Preenian touch.\n\"Preenian\", \"Preenesque\", \"Preenish\". It\
    \ is a mark of his genius, perhaps, that none of these words has entered the vocabulary.\
    \ In the last analysis--actually, in the first analysis--he was simply unique.\
    \ Did those worms beneath the soil in the pretty little churchyard of St Bibblybibdib's\
    \ know how fortunate they were, to be gnawing and munching the rotting remains\
    \ of the great maestro? One bit of him, of course, they did not get to eat, and\
    \ that was the bouffant, which was removed from his head before burial, and placed\
    \ in a preserving jar. It has had its own adventures. Initially sold at auction\
    \ in order to settle at least one of the debts he left unpaid, the bouffant-in-a-jar\
    \ was stolen from its (anonymous) purchaser, who was found, the morning after\
    \ the sale, chopped into a thousand pieces. It was next seen adorning the beer-stained\
    \ counter of a tavern in a particularly sordid Marseilles tavern, but disappeared\
    \ after a knife-fight among thugs. A year or so later, it turned up next to a\
    \ waste bin on a pretty little towpath next to an unimportant canal. The bouffant,\
    \ in its jar, is currently thought to be under lock and key in a bank vault, though\
    \ by all accounts it is the kind of vault, and the kind of bank, favoured by criminal\
    \ gangs planning heists which can later be immortalised on screen.\nLothar Preen\
    \ himself has never been depicted in a film. No cinema would dare to show it.\n\
    Fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen. I am the maestro Lothar Preen.\n  Eighteen\
    \ nineteen twenty twenty-one. When I am gone they will blot out the sun.\nAnd\
    \ they did. It is still pitch dark."
