  text: 'I was casting around in my head to find a topic for today''s essay, but it
    was difficult to think straight because of that confounded sun. Usually, gazing
    vacantly out of the window works a treat, but how can a man gaze out of the window
    into the awful glare of relentless battering sunlight? I have always been perplexed
    by its popularity. Blindingly bright and ridiculously hot, the sun is better considered
    as John Donne''s busie old fool. It has long been my contention that the reason
    the Middle East is a powder keg of demented Islamist nutcases has more to do with
    climate than religion. They all get so frenzied and bad-tempered and psychotic
    because of the sunlight and the heat. In this weather, I might well be tempted
    to fire round after round from a Kalashnikov into the air, had I a Kalashnikov.

    Normally, at such times, my thoughts turn easily to a different sort of madness
    brought on by the sun. As an Aztec fundamentalist, I mourn the passing of the
    practice of human sacrifice designed to assuage the anger of the Sun God. But
    those were simpler times, I suppose. Nowadays one would probably need to apply
    for a permit from the council just to set up a stone altar upon which to splay
    one''s victims out, preparatory to gouging them open and wrenching out their still-beating
    hearts. There would be paperwork, risk assessments, equalities monitoring forms.
    Who would have the energy to tackle all that bureaucracy while the sun beats down
    so?

    Instead, mopping my brow, I thought instead, as I so rarely do, of Rod McKuen.
    His "Seasons In The Sun", adapted from Jacques Brel, seems to me a very foolish
    response to sunlight. "We had joy, we had fun"? Really? As my friend Robert Matthews
    said so pertinently more than thirty years ago, "You have to define fun, or you
    will have none". Rod McKuen signally fails to define the fun he thinks he was
    having in his seasons in the sun. If he came right out and said he was tearing
    out the hearts of sacrificial victims splayed on a stone altar, and that he had
    fun doing so, then fair play to Rod. But he doesn''t. I think we have to agree
    with Nora Ephron, who said his verse was "superficial and platitudinous and frequently
    silly", and with Karl Shapiro, who pronounced magisterially "it is irrelevant
    to speak of McKuen as a poet".

    Incidentally, and while we are speaking of both risk assessments and Rod McKuen,
    I can reveal that I was taken to see the mawkish troubadour, performing at the
    Royal Albert Hall, when I was but young. I was taken either by my father or by
    one of my older sisters. So far as I know, whichever one took me was never charged
    in a court of law with imperilling the sensibilities of a still formative juvenile
    mind. Had a proper risk assessment been carried out, surely the doors would have
    been barred against me? In the event, we must all count ourselves fortunate that
    I was not permanently scarred by the experience. A Rod McKuenised version of Hooting
    Yard simply doesn''t bear thinking about.

    Back in the present, it was not so much a season in the sun as a morning spent
    avoiding the busie old fool. I pondered the idea of donning a yellow polo neck
    sweater and sculpting my grey mop into a magnificent bouffant, pretending to be
    Christopher Lee and going to find a virgin police officer to set fire to. Not
    quite Aztec sun worship, but it would pass the time. Then I had a stomach-churning
    vision of Nicolas Cage in The Wicker Man remake and had to lie down with a cold
    compress on my forehead. I was only revived when I pondered the idea of Nicolas
    Cage starring as Rod McKuen in a biopic of the latter. If this film is not yet
    in production then it damned well ought to be. It would make a fitting addition
    to the Cage canon. There could even be a scene set in an inaccurately rendered
    mockup of the Royal Albert Hall, where Cage/McKuen croaks his winsome piffle and
    we see, sitting in the audience, Mr Key as a tiny. The youngster chosen to play
    me would have to be able to express a subtle range of reactions, somehow suggesting
    that the titanic grandeur of Hooting Yard is nascent within his cranium, imperilled
    by McKuen yet resisting an awful descent into superficiality, platitudes, and
    silliness. Perhaps I ought to set to work on the screenplay.

    I wrung out the no longer cold compress and decided to go for a walk around Nameless
    Pond. As far as I am aware I do not yet need a council permit to do so, and it
    was simply a matter of preparing myself against the sun''s onslaught. The busie
    old fool was still high in the sky, blistering hot, bright and golden, and deeply
    irritating. I fashioned a protective shroud and stepped out of the door.

    I had not gone ten paces when I was set upon by a whirling gaggle of urchins,
    who pelted me with birds'' eggs and thrashed me with nettles.

    "What what what?" I cried, "Unhand me, teeming urchins!"

    I was tempted to add "Get back to your tenements!", as if I were Keith Pratt,
    but something about my assailants gave me pause. They did not seem like the usual
    rampaging members of what used to be called, in less queasy times, the lower orders.
    My intuitions were confirmed when one of them stood forward from the pack. I could
    not help noticing that he wore atop his bonce a crown of golden cardboard, upon
    which the sunlight was reflected, blindingly.

    "We shall continue to pelt you with birds'' eggs and thrash you with nettles until
    you attach to your frankly weird shroud a sprig of shick-shack," said the urchin.

    "I beg your pardon?", I said, shielding my eyes from the horrid glare of the sunlight.

    "It is Oak Apple Day," he said, When we commemorate the Restoration of 1660. All
    hail Charles II, the true Sun King!"

    And they pelted me with birds'' eggs and thrashed me with nettles until I retreated
    indoors, where I rummaged about in a drawer for a sprig of oak apple. O! how I
    wished I had instead that Kalashnikov.'
