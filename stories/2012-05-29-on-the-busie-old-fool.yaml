  text: "I was casting around in my head to find a topic for today's essay, but it\
    \ was difficult to think straight because of that confounded sun. Usually, gazing\
    \ vacantly out of the window works a treat, but how can a man gaze out of the\
    \ window into the awful glare of relentless battering sunlight? I have always\
    \ been perplexed by its popularity. Blindingly bright and ridiculously hot, the\
    \ sun is better considered as John Donne's busie old fool. It has long been my\
    \ contention that the reason the Middle East is a powder keg of demented Islamist\
    \ nutcases has more to do with climate than religion. They all get so frenzied\
    \ and bad-tempered and psychotic because of the sunlight and the heat. In this\
    \ weather, I might well be tempted to fire round after round from a Kalashnikov\
    \ into the air, had I a Kalashnikov.\nNormally, at such times, my thoughts turn\
    \ easily to a different sort of madness brought on by the sun. As an Aztec fundamentalist,\
    \ I mourn the passing of the practice of human sacrifice designed to assuage the\
    \ anger of the Sun God. But those were simpler times, I suppose. Nowadays one\
    \ would probably need to apply for a permit from the council just to set up a\
    \ stone altar upon which to splay one's victims out, preparatory to gouging them\
    \ open and wrenching out their still-beating hearts. There would be paperwork,\
    \ risk assessments, equalities monitoring forms. Who would have the energy to\
    \ tackle all that bureaucracy while the sun beats down so?\nInstead, mopping my\
    \ brow, I thought instead, as I so rarely do, of Rod McKuen. His \u201CSeasons\
    \ In The Sun\u201D, adapted from Jacques Brel, seems to me a very foolish response\
    \ to sunlight. \u201CWe had joy, we had fun\u201D? Really? As my friend Robert\
    \ Matthews said so pertinently more than thirty years ago, \u201CYou have to define\
    \ fun, or you will have none\u201D. Rod McKuen signally fails to define the fun\
    \ he thinks he was having in his seasons in the sun. If he came right out and\
    \ said he was tearing out the hearts of sacrificial victims splayed on a stone\
    \ altar, and that he had fun doing so, then fair play to Rod. But he doesn't.\
    \ I think we have to agree with Nora Ephron, who said his verse was \u201Csuperficial\
    \ and platitudinous and frequently silly\u201D, and with Karl Shapiro, who pronounced\
    \ magisterially \u201Cit is irrelevant to speak of McKuen as a poet\u201D.\nIncidentally,\
    \ and while we are speaking of both risk assessments and Rod McKuen, I can reveal\
    \ that I was taken to see the mawkish troubadour, performing at the Royal Albert\
    \ Hall, when I was but young. I was taken either by my father or by one of my\
    \ older sisters. So far as I know, whichever one took me was never charged in\
    \ a court of law with imperilling the sensibilities of a still formative juvenile\
    \ mind. Had a proper risk assessment been carried out, surely the doors would\
    \ have been barred against me? In the event, we must all count ourselves fortunate\
    \ that I was not permanently scarred by the experience. A Rod McKuenised version\
    \ of Hooting Yard simply doesn't bear thinking about.\nBack in the present, it\
    \ was not so much a season in the sun as a morning spent avoiding the busie old\
    \ fool. I pondered the idea of donning a yellow polo neck sweater and sculpting\
    \ my grey mop into a magnificent bouffant, pretending to be Christopher Lee and\
    \ going to find a virgin police officer to set fire to. Not quite Aztec sun worship,\
    \ but it would pass the time. Then I had a stomach-churning vision of Nicolas\
    \ Cage in The Wicker Man remake and had to lie down with a cold compress on my\
    \ forehead. I was only revived when I pondered the idea of Nicolas Cage starring\
    \ as Rod McKuen in a biopic of the latter. If this film is not yet in production\
    \ then it damned well ought to be. It would make a fitting addition to the Cage\
    \ canon. There could even be a scene set in an inaccurately rendered mockup of\
    \ the Royal Albert Hall, where Cage/McKuen croaks his winsome piffle and we see,\
    \ sitting in the audience, Mr Key as a tiny. The youngster chosen to play me would\
    \ have to be able to express a subtle range of reactions, somehow suggesting that\
    \ the titanic grandeur of Hooting Yard is nascent within his cranium, imperilled\
    \ by McKuen yet resisting an awful descent into superficiality, platitudes, and\
    \ silliness. Perhaps I ought to set to work on the screenplay.\nI wrung out the\
    \ no longer cold compress and decided to go for a walk around Nameless Pond. As\
    \ far as I am aware I do not yet need a council permit to do so, and it was simply\
    \ a matter of preparing myself against the sun's onslaught. The busie old fool\
    \ was still high in the sky, blistering hot, bright and golden, and deeply irritating.\
    \ I fashioned a protective shroud and stepped out of the door.\nI had not gone\
    \ ten paces when I was set upon by a whirling gaggle of urchins, who pelted me\
    \ with birds\u2019 eggs and thrashed me with nettles.\n\u201CWhat what what?\u201D\
    \ I cried, \u201CUnhand me, teeming urchins!\u201D\nI was tempted to add \u201C\
    Get back to your tenements!\u201D, as if I were Keith Pratt, but something about\
    \ my assailants gave me pause. They did not seem like the usual rampaging members\
    \ of what used to be called, in less queasy times, the lower orders. My intuitions\
    \ were confirmed when one of them stood forward from the pack. I could not help\
    \ noticing that he wore atop his bonce a crown of golden cardboard, upon which\
    \ the sunlight was reflected, blindingly.\n\u201CWe shall continue to pelt you\
    \ with birds\u2019 eggs and thrash you with nettles until you attach to your frankly\
    \ weird shroud a sprig of shick-shack,\u201D said the urchin.\n\u201CI beg your\
    \ pardon?\u201D, I said, shielding my eyes from the horrid glare of the sunlight.\n\
    \u201CIt is Oak Apple Day,\u201D he said, When we commemorate the Restoration\
    \ of 1660. All hail Charles II, the true Sun King!\u201D\nAnd they pelted me with\
    \ birds\u2019 eggs and thrashed me with nettles until I retreated indoors, where\
    \ I rummaged about in a drawer for a sprig of oak apple. O! how I wished I had\
    \ instead that Kalashnikov."
