  text: "As a child, I gained my first understanding of the grand sweep of our national\
    \ story from a book entitled British History In Strip Pictures, undated, but published\
    \ by Odhams Press at some point in the 1950s. I used to pore over this book for\
    \ hours, and was going to pore over it again, preparatory to writing today's essay.\
    \ Alack and alas!, I am mortified that I cannot find it on the tottering teeming\
    \ Hooting Yard bookshelves. Now I am not exactly the most organised of persons,\
    \ but I can usually lay hands on a book I am looking for. The current whereabouts\
    \ of British History In Strip Pictures must, for the time being, remain a mystery.\
    \ I know I have it somewhere.\nNot being able to find it, I was going to postpone\
    \ this essay for another day. But then I determined to soldier on, as my subject\
    \ would have soldiered on, determinedly, and regardless of handicap. My handicap\
    \ is merely that I cannot find the book I was looking for. His handicap was that\
    \ he was blind. For I speak of that titanic figure Blind Jack of Knaresborough.\n\
    \nIn British History In Strip Pictures, Blind Jack was granted a whole page, the\
    \ same amount of space given to, for example, the Magna Carta, Shakespeare, and\
    \ the Civil War, and twice that given to Gladstone and Disraeli, who had to share\
    \ a page, as I recall. I thus grew up with the idea that Blind Jack of Knaresborough\
    \ was a pivotal figure in British history. I fully expected, when I went to school\
    \ and studied these matters in greater depth, that Blind Jack would probably have\
    \ a few lessons devoted solely to his doings, if not an entire term's worth. As\
    \ it turned out, in thirteen years at school, from age five to eighteen, I do\
    \ not think I ever heard his name mentioned.\nAt some point the sheer wrongness\
    \ of this must have occurred to me, along with the thought that perhaps the editors\
    \ at Odhams Press had made him up for a lark. \"Tee hee! Let's insert a page about\
    \ a wholly convincing yet completely fictional character to play a trick on the\
    \ tinies!\", I imagined a couple of them, resembling Gabbitas and Thring from\
    \ the Molesworth books, chuckling to each other over their printers' proofs. Such\
    \ scampishness could be the only explanation for my history teachers' neglect\
    \ of the man I believed had single-handedly brought about the Industrial Revolution.\
    \ I had been led to believe that, were it not for Blind Jack of Knaresborough,\
    \ we might still be living in rustic squalor, a nation of peasants consigned forever\
    \ to remain in Lork Roise because we would never have been able to travel to Candleford.\n\
    Blind Jack, you see, was a road builder. And the way he built roads, British History\
    \ In Strip Pictures told me, was that he walked along tapping his stick in front\
    \ of him to gauge the smoothness and straightness of the road he had just built...\
    \ er... something along those lines, they had but six pictures and captions to\
    \ tell the story, so obviously some of the finer detail was left out. I recall\
    \ being haunted by the picture of Blind Jack out on the road, dressed just like\
    \ the man on the Quaker Oats carton, gazing at nothing. I am sure there were times\
    \ when I dreamed of him, relentlessly approaching me, the tap of his stick, the\
    \ eerie sightlessness of his eyes... I think for a time I even managed to get\
    \ him mixed up, in my fevered mind, with the much more malign figure of Robert\
    \ Mitchum's preacher man in The Night Of The Hunter (Charles Laughton, 1955),\
    \ which I saw when very young and impressionable.\nWithout having the book to\
    \ hand, I am unable to confirm whether it mentioned other titans of the Industrial\
    \ Revolution such as Thomas Telford and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. I am fairly sure\
    \ that neither of them had a whole page to himself. Blind Jack did, and that was\
    \ good enough for me to credit him with creating a world that lifted me out of\
    \ peasantry. And to my relief, I have since learned that he was not an invention\
    \ of a couple of scallywags at Odhams Press, that he really did exist.\nHis name\
    \ was John Metcalf, born 1717 and died in 1810, blind from the age of six.. One\
    \ of the intriguing things about him was that part of his success in building\
    \ roads was a matchless ability to make accurate estimations of costs and materials,\
    \ using a system of his own devising which he was unable (or unwilling?) ever\
    \ to explain to others. He also worked out a method of constructing  roads over\
    \ bogs, using matted rafts of marsh grass and furze. No wonder he is my hero,\
    \ when we consider that that previous sentence alone contains at least three words\
    \ essential to the Hooting Yard lexicon.\nHis gravestone, in the Yorkshire village\
    \ of Spofforth, bears this epitaph:\nHere lies John Metcalf, one whose infant\
    \ sight\n    Felt the dark pressure of an endless night;\n    Yet such the fervour\
    \ of his dauntless mind,\n    His limbs full strung, his spirits unconfined,\n\
    \    That, long ere yet life's bolder years began,\n    The sightless efforts\
    \ mark'd th' aspiring man;\n    Nor mark'd in vain--high deeds his manhood dared,\n\
    \    And commerce, travel, both his ardour shared.\n    'Twas his a guide's unerring\
    \ aid to lend--\n    O'er trackless wastes to bid new roads extend;\n    And,\
    \ when rebellion reared her giant size,\n    'Twas his to burn with patriot enterprise;\n\
    \    For parting wife and babes, a pang to feel,\n    Then welcome danger for\
    \ his country's weal.\n    Reader, like him, exert thy utmost talent given!\n\
    \    Reader, like him, adore the bounteous hand of Heaven\nADDENDUM : I wonder\
    \ if Anna Pavlova named her swan after Blind Jack of Knaresborough? Perhaps a\
    \ balletomane reader might know, and could enlighten me."
