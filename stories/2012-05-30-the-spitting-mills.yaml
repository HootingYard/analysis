  text: 'When they were apart, they questioned and instructed each other minutely
    on the state of their health. "How is it my darling," Mill inquired, "that you
    say you have broken the habit of expectoration? When you cough are you not obliged
    to swallow something if you do not spit it up?" "I cannot but think," replied
    Harriet with her characteristic note of self-righteousness, "that if you tried
    as earnestly as I have done since October to avoid any expectoration that you
    would lose the habit altogether as I have done." It was her idea that Mill was
    bothered by phlegm because he was in the habit of spitting, not that he was forced
    to spit because he was bothered by phlegm. Perhaps she was right.
