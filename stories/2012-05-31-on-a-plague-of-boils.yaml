  text: "When one is covered from head to toe in suppurating boils, one finds that\
    \ invitations to sophisticated cocktail parties, unlike the boils, dry up. I discovered\
    \ this through personal experience. There was a time when, like Job, I was tested\
    \ by the Lord. One such test the Lord devised was to strike me with a plague of\
    \ boils. It could not have come at a worse time, hot on the heels of a plague\
    \ of locusts, an infestation of mice, and a bloody ridiculous gas bill. I wouldn't\
    \ mind, but it's not as if I actually get to see any of the gas unless it is already\
    \ up in flames, burning away. But try telling that to the automaton on the other\
    \ end of the so-called gas helpline. All you get is a flea in your ear. Speaking\
    \ of which, I forgot to mention the plague of fleas. That was another test from\
    \ the Lord, between the locusts and the mice. So I was not best pleased to find\
    \ myself one day completely covered in suppurating boils, particularly when I\
    \ was due to attend a sophisticated cocktail party that very evening.\n\u201C\
    O Lord,\u201D I implored, on my knees, \u201CI understand why thee tormentest\
    \ me so, for I am but a snivelling wretch unworthy to crawl upon my belly like\
    \ a worm or other creeping thing. Having said that, could thee perhaps show mercy\
    \ and remove from my hideous flesh this plague of suppurating boils, given that\
    \ I have received an invitation to attend a sophisticated cocktail party this\
    \ evening and in my present state am barely able to present myself in civilised\
    \ human company?\u201D\nTo which I am afraid the Lord replied in a booming authoritarian\
    \ roar which made the walls tremble. I cannot recall His precise words, but the\
    \ tone was not reassuring. I got the distinct impression that He expected me to\
    \ suffer the boils in silence, with hopeless resignation to his Lordly whims,\
    \ and not to bother Him with pathetic self-pitying supplications. So after a while\
    \ I got to my feet and went out to the chemist's.\nLuckily there were not many\
    \ people about at this early hour. Those few that did see me looked on me with\
    \ horror, or turned their backs, or shielded their eyes. One or two vomited. I\
    \ cannot say I blamed them, as before leaving the house I had checked my appearance\
    \ in the hallway mirror. I was not a pretty sight. I dressed as best as I could,\
    \ in the few pitiful mice-nibbled rags the Lord had seen fit to leave me with,\
    \ and I wafted a sprig of hyacinths in front of me as I walked, to mask as far\
    \ as possible the stink of the suppurations, which was considerable.\nThe chemist\
    \ and I went back a long way, having been childhood tobogganing pals. Indeed,\
    \ we had even tobogganed as adults, when conditions were right on the slopes,\
    \ and he was able to drag himself away from his dispensary. I knew that he, too,\
    \ had been driven crackers by his gas bills. So I expected a degree of sympathy\
    \ as I pushed open the door and the little bell clanged and he hove into view\
    \ behind his counter.\n\u201CBy Saint Spivack and all the holy martyrs of mediaeval\
    \ Ravenna!\u201D he cried, \u201CYou're a sight for sore eyes!\u201D\nI nodded\
    \ in agreement, which was unwise, as a glob of pus was shaken free from one of\
    \ my boils and landed on the clean scrubbed linoleum of the chemist's shop floor.\n\
    \u201CThe least you can do is mop that up,\u201D he said, handing me a mop.\n\
    I did so, while my pal rummaged among his pills and potions for a suitable unguent.\n\
    \u201CI can't promise this will eradicate your suppurating boils,\u201D he said,\
    \ handing me a tube of Dr Baxter's Patent Palliative Cream For Suppurating Boils,\
    \ Sores, And Buboes, \u201CBut it is a cream, and it is a palliative, so in tandem\
    \ with your sprig of hyacinths it might make you a slightly less noisome and offensive\
    \ creature.\u201D\nI thanked him and paid him and edged carefully out of the door,\
    \ hoping not to leave any further deposits of pus on the linoleum.\n\u201CAre\
    \ you up for some tobogganing come Sunday?\u201D he called after me, which was\
    \ thoughtful of him, but we both knew I could hardly enjoy swooping down a snowy\
    \ slope aboard a toboggan while plagued by suppurating boils.\n\u201CThat is in\
    \ the hands of the Lord,\u201D I replied, and hurried off along the lane towards\
    \ the canal. I would find a shrubbery-sheltered bench somewhere on the towpath\
    \ and smear my boils with unguent. That, at least, was the plan. I was not to\
    \ know, nor had my pal the chemist seen fit to warn me, that Dr Baxter, when concocting\
    \ his Patent Palliative Cream For Suppurating Boils, Sores, And Buboes, had used\
    \ several ingredients which, in combination, proved absolutely irresistible to\
    \ swans. Thus it was that, as I hunkered in the shelter of shrubbery, on a bench,\
    \ smearing my boils, a baker's dozen of swans came padding out of the canal and\
    \ surrounded me. It is one of my iron rules never to antagonise a swan, so I tiptoed\
    \ away as quietly as I could, with only a few of my boils smeared. But the swans,\
    \ driven to delirium by the whiff of Dr Baxter's recipe, pursued me. I made it\
    \ home, and they simply waited outside, occasionally thumping their beaks against\
    \ the front door.\nWhen evening came, and it was time for me to leave for the\
    \ sophisticated cocktail party, the swans were still there. I had no choice but\
    \ to let them follow me, along the lane and past the allotments and through the\
    \ tunnel under the bypass and past the industrial estate and the science park\
    \ and the oil refinery and the other allotments, until I reached the gated community\
    \ wherein the sophisticated cocktail party was taking place. I flashed my permit\
    \ at the security guard in the booth, who depressed the knob which opened the\
    \ gate. I hoped he would shut it again quickly, to keep the swans out, but he\
    \ seemed to think they were my pets, so closely did they tail me. Thus it was\
    \ that I arrived at the sophisticated cocktail party wafting my sprig of hyacinths,\
    \ covered from head to toe in suppurating boils made only slightly less noisome\
    \ and offensive by Dr Baxter's Patent Palliative Cream, and accompanied by a gaggle\
    \ of delirious swans.\nI plucked a drink from a tray and leaned as insouciantly\
    \ as I could against a mantelpiece. I was not a social success. In fact, throughout\
    \ the evening, the only person who came within ten feet of me was a blind flapper\
    \ with a streaming cold which had robbed her of her sense of smell. We were getting\
    \ on like a house on fire until she confessed that she was allergic to swans.\
    \ I did the gentlemanly thing and revealed that there were thirteen swans in close\
    \ proximity.\n\u201CAh,\u201D she said, \u201CThat explains why I have developed\
    \ a splitting headache, have a ringing in my ears, and pins and needles in my\
    \ extremities. I had better go out on to the balcony, away from your pet swans,\
    \ or I am liable to break out in suppurating boils all over my body. Toodle-pip!\u201D\
    \n\u201CWait!\u201D, I cried, \u201CThe swans are not my pets and I have a half-full\
    \ tube of Dr Baxter's Patent Palliative Cream For Suppurating Boils, Sores, And\
    \ Buboes!\u201D\nBut she was already gone.\nA social pariah, I at last realised\
    \ I had outstayed my welcome, and I made my way home, swans in tow. The Lord alone\
    \ knew when next I would be invited to a sophisticated cocktail party, so I got\
    \ down on my knees and asked Him. Back came that booming authoritarian roar. Again,\
    \ I could not make out the individual words, but the tone was if anything even\
    \ less reassuring than it had been in the morning. I headed for bed convinced\
    \ that those swans were going to be following me for the rest of my life. When\
    \ I opened the bedroom door, there they were. They had somehow managed to get\
    \ into the house, and now they were lined up, all thirteen of them, at the foot\
    \ of the bed, their black eyes gazing at me, pitiless, savage, and mad."
