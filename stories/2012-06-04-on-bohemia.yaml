  text: "If ever you find yourself in Bohemia, there is every likelihood that you\
    \ will be enmired in a scandal or swept away by a rhapsody. It is even possible\
    \ that both may occur. Fortunately, there are historical precedents to guide your\
    \ conduct. For a rhapsodic episode, one can study the case of Farrokh Bulsara\
    \ and his chums, one of whom, I think not incidentally, was later to become an\
    \ accredited expert on the starry cosmos, and a friend to badgers. Should, on\
    \ the other hands, scandal erupt, there is an account of how to deal with it by\
    \ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, no friend of badgers then or later, but a man who did\
    \ much research into what we might call the psychic and supernatural cosmos.\n\
    It is well worth your time to study the relevant texts, by Bulsara and Conan Doyle,\
    \ before you set out on your journey to Bohemia. By the time you arrive at the\
    \ border, and present your credentials to the border guard in his Bohemian border\
    \ hut, you should be ready for absolutely anything the Bohemians can throw at\
    \ you, be it a rhapsody or a scandal, or\u2014which I have not yet mentioned but\
    \ is equally likely\u2014a doomed love affair with a consumptive seamstress.\n\
    You will be asked to state the purpose of your visit, and to empty out your suitcase\
    \ upon a rickety wooden table inside the hut. On no account should you take the\
    \ Bohemian border guard's grim demeanour as a personal affront. He will have been\
    \ trained in physiognomic grimness from his very first day at the Bohemian Border\
    \ Guards\u2019 Academy, an institution which has known its own share of rhapsodies\
    \ and scandals, both possibly involving consumptive seamstresses. You should remain\
    \ polite and compliant, and pay no attention to the rifles, revolvers, submachine\
    \ guns, truncheons, and lead-weighted saps much in evidence inside the hut. Bear\
    \ in mind that Bohemian border guards have an almost pathological mania for tidiness,\
    \ so when you empty out your suitcase you should align the contents very very\
    \ neatly upon the rickety table. Alignment in alphabetical order is recommended,\
    \ if you can manage it. Do not even think about offering a bribe. Bohemian border\
    \ guards are absolutely incorruptible, and have been to known to take umbrage\
    \ at backhanders, umbrage they give vent to by thwacking their potential corrupter\
    \ on the back of the neck with a sap.\nOnce you have emptied your suitcase you\
    \ may be taken into a small connecting room within the border hut. This is where\
    \ you will be questioned about the purpose of your visit. At this stage, of course,\
    \ before actually making the physical crossing into Bohemia, you will not have\
    \ been swept away by a rhapsody, nor enmired in a scandal, and you can therefore\
    \ deflect any pertinent rhapsody/scandal questions by adopting a gormless facial\
    \ expression. Most Bohemian border guards consider foreigners stupid, so you will\
    \ only be reinforcing their existing prejudices. This will put them at their ease.\
    \ The wilier border guards might slip in a trick question about, say, Irene Adler\
    \ or Scaramouche, or even frozen tiny hands. Do not take the bait. Have recourse\
    \ to a tactic such as biting your tongue so forcefully you draw blood, or carrying\
    \ in your pocket a small device which can deliver an electric shock when squeezed\
    \ in the palm of your hand. Such distraction should rescue you from the risk of\
    \ blurting out more than it is advisable for the border guards to know.\nAt the\
    \ end of the interrogation, if all has gone well, your papers will be stamped\
    \ and you will be led back into the main room of the hut. You will find that your\
    \ suitcase has been repacked with all your belongings, and much more neatly than\
    \ when you originally packed it earlier that morning at the hotel on L\xFCneberg\
    \ Heath. Perhaps if you remain in Bohemia long enough, and can avoid becoming\
    \ embroiled in rhapsodies and scandals and doomed love affairs with consumptive\
    \ seamstresses, you will learn to pack your suitcase with fanatical tidiness.\
    \ This is the kind of thing that can keep you occupied once you have shaken hands\
    \ with the border guard and trudged across the border proper into Bohemia and\
    \ found a cheap hotel at which to rest your weary head.\nAt the hotel, the first\
    \ thing you should do is to unpack your suitcase and rummage in the lining for\
    \ the listening device planted therein by the border guard. It is best disabled\
    \ by being submerged in water. You might want to hurl it into the Vlatava, or\
    \ another major river or watercourse. Be careful not to do this in the evening,\
    \ however, for standing on a bridge over a Bohemian river in the twinkling lights\
    \ of evening has been to known to provoke rhapsodic feelings. It is also a time\
    \ when scandal might be brewing. After chucking the listening device into water,\
    \ go straight back to your hotel to do some practice suitcase packing and unpacking,\
    \ and resist the temptation to visit any garrets where consumptive seamstresses\
    \ may be languishing. Between the hotel lobby and the safety of your room you\
    \ might of course scent a whiff of scandal among the potted plants and in the\
    \ corridors. Wrap your scarf tighter about your neck and pull the brim of your\
    \ Homburg down to shade your eyes.\nAs an extra precaution, find, in an insalubrious\
    \ Bohemian alleyway, a rascal skilled in counterfeiting. Pay this person to provide\
    \ you with forged papers purporting to show that you are a trusted and long-serving\
    \ employee of an important asbestos works. Armed with this documentation, you\
    \ can then guard against any eruption of rhapsody or scandal or doomed love by\
    \ taking out a policy with the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom\
    \ of Bohemia. Make an appointment with Herr Kafka. Be sure to catch him in the\
    \ office at a time when he is not out on the river indulging his love of rowing\
    \ boats. There is a chance he might scoop up, with one of his oars, the listening\
    \ device you chucked into the river earlier, and you will not want him asking\
    \ you any hard questions about it. He can be tenacious. And whatever you do, do\
    \ not accept an invitation to lunch with him. He is a Fletcherist, who chews each\
    \ mouthful of food one hundred times per minute, and his table manners are disgusting.\n\
    Otherwise, enjoy your stay in Bohemia."
