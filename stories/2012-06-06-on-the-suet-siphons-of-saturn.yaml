  text: "Captain's Log, stardate the Ides of March, Year Dot plus [redacted]. I am\
    \ sick of this damned log. Literally sick. Whenever I open it to scribble another\
    \ entry I am overcome by a wave of nausea. I am convinced I have a palsy and an\
    \ ague, even though I would be hard pressed to define exactly what a palsy is\
    \ or an ague is. Were there a medical dictionary aboard the starship I would look\
    \ them up. But if ever there was a medical dictionary it disappeared along with\
    \ the doctor, Von Straubenzee, a year ago today. A year or a space-year, I cannot\
    \ be certain. The Captain and Second Officer Wilmot and that rascal Mister Poxhaven\
    \ vanished too, leaving me to take command, and to scribble in the Captain's Log.\
    \ I was going to cross out the word Captain's, with a big thick bold indelible\
    \ black black black black black marker pen, and insert instead Purser's, me being\
    \ Purser Blot. I don't know what gave me pause, unless it was the terrible shaking\
    \ of my hand occasioned by the palsy. But I could barely lift the pen, so it remains\
    \ the Captain's Log rather than the Palsied Purser's Log. I am using a special\
    \ lightweight space-biro to do my scribbling. It puts no strain on my quivering\
    \ white tiny frozen hand.\nMy hands are as tiny as those of the composer Scriabin.\
    \ I wanted to compose music, delirious and ecstatic music, but instead I was sent\
    \ to starship pursers\u2019 training academy. There was no music there, only bleeping\
    \ and whooshing and buzzing noises. At least it prepared me for the starship itself,\
    \ where there is a constant din of bleeping and whooshing and buzzing, punctuated\
    \ only by the strange gurgling sounds made by the ship's vampire, Bosun Cugat.\
    \ He claims they are involuntary, his gurglings, and apologises, a little too\
    \ fulsomely for my liking. I would have him confined to the brig were it not that\
    \ he would simply melt the metal bars with his basilisk glare and escape. I am\
    \ not clear precisely what kind of vampire he is, just as I am unclear about palsy\
    \ and ague. Ach Gott!, I was not cut out for this life. I ought to be sprawled\
    \ on a divan in a dacha, composing ecstatic music.\nCaptain's Log, stardate Ides\
    \ of March plus one. At the time of his death in stardate 1915, Scriabin was working\
    \ on his Mysterium, of which he wrote: \u201CThere will not be a single spectator.\
    \ All will be participants. The work requires special people, special artists\
    \ and a completely new culture. The cast of performers includes an orchestra,\
    \ a large mixed choir, an instrument with visual effects, dancers, a procession,\
    \ incense, and rhythmic textural articulation. The cathedral in which it will\
    \ take place will not be of one single type of stone but will continually change\
    \ with the atmosphere and motion of the Mysterium. This will be done with the\
    \ aid of mists and lights, which will modify the architectural contours.\u201D\
    \ He intended that the performance of this work, to be given in the foothills\
    \ of the Himalayas, would last seven days and would be followed by the end of\
    \ the world, with the human race replaced by \u201Cnobler beings\u201D.\nCaptain's\
    \ Log, stardate Ides of March plus two. Bosun Cugat confronted me at suppertime\
    \ yesterday and revealed that he had snuck a peek at this Log. He said I ought\
    \ to be using it to note pertinent details of the starship and its space-voyage,\
    \ rather than wittering on about Scriabin. He has whiffy oxters. I threw an aerosol\
    \ can of space-deodorant at him and told him to use it. I am a nobler being than\
    \ Bosun Cugat. I would like to compose my own Mysterium, but there is far too\
    \ much faffing about to do on this damned starship. I think we have entered the\
    \ Belt of Jiffy. I looked out of the starboard window and saw a gas giant.\nCaptain's\
    \ Log, stardate Ides of March plus three. Whether or not we were in the Belt of\
    \ Jiffy yesterday, we are nowhere near it now. Bosun Cugat has seized control\
    \ of the starship and we are hurtling towards Saturn at warp factor God knows\
    \ what. He has locked me in the space-janitor's cupboard, with my biro and the\
    \ captain's log and a flask of dandelion and burdock and a few sticks of celery.\
    \ Every now and then he comes hammering on the door and shouting questions at\
    \ me, but refuses to let me out. His questions are technical ones, to which I\
    \ do not always have ready answers. He wants to know if we should pass through\
    \ the rings of Saturn or try to avoid them. Apparently he is going to land on\
    \ the planet's surface and go in search of the Suet Siphons of Saturn. Being a\
    \ vampire, he will not require a spacesuit. What in heaven's name he wants with\
    \ suet I have no idea.\nRummaging around in the cupboard I found a piccolo and\
    \ a cowbell. I am passing the time composing a piece of delirious and ecstatic\
    \ music for piccolo, cowbell and celery sticks. Scriabin would be proud of me,\
    \ at least I like to think so. Hail to thee, blessed Alexander Nikolayevich!\n\
    Captain's Log, stardate Ides of March plus four. A couple of hours after we landed\
    \ on Saturn, I heard Bosun Cugat's dainty footsteps padding along the corridor.\
    \ He stopped outside the space-janitor's cupboard and the door whooshed open and\
    \ he moaned and fell, crumpled, into my arms. For hours I cradled him, mussing\
    \ his filthy hair and making cooing noises into his pointy ear. I know my duty.\
    \ Eventually he gathered himself, and explained that he had located the suet siphons,\
    \ teeming thousands of them, all lined up in neat rows on some kind of Saturnine\
    \ plain or pampas. And every single one was exhausted. Not a spit of suet could\
    \ be eked from a single siphon.\n\u201CDo you not understand what this means?\u201D\
    \ he shrieked, \u201COthers have been here before us!\u201D\nI had to admit that\
    \ this put something of a damper on our five-year mission to explore strange new\
    \ worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man\
    \ has gone before.\n\u201CShould we go in search of the suet?\u201D I asked.\n\
    But before Bosun Cugat could reply, he was engulfed in mists and lights which\
    \ modified his corporeal contours. In front of my eyes, he was transmogrified\
    \ into a nobler being. I looked out of the starboard window and saw that the universe\
    \ had vanished. Scriabin's Mysterium had come to pass. It was the end of the world.\
    \ I picked up the piccolo and cowbell and celery sticks and played a threnody.\n\
    \nAlexander Nikolayevich Scriabin"
