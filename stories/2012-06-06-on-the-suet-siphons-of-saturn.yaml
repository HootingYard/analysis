  text: 'Captain''s Log, stardate the Ides of March, Year Dot plus [redacted]. I am
    sick of this damned log. Literally sick. Whenever I open it to scribble another
    entry I am overcome by a wave of nausea. I am convinced I have a palsy and an
    ague, even though I would be hard pressed to define exactly what a palsy is or
    an ague is. Were there a medical dictionary aboard the starship I would look them
    up. But if ever there was a medical dictionary it disappeared along with the doctor,
    Von Straubenzee, a year ago today. A year or a space-year, I cannot be certain.
    The Captain and Second Officer Wilmot and that rascal Mister Poxhaven vanished
    too, leaving me to take command, and to scribble in the Captain''s Log. I was
    going to cross out the word Captain''s, with a big thick bold indelible black
    black black black black marker pen, and insert instead Purser''s, me being Purser
    Blot. I don''t know what gave me pause, unless it was the terrible shaking of
    my hand occasioned by the palsy. But I could barely lift the pen, so it remains
    the Captain''s Log rather than the Palsied Purser''s Log. I am using a special
    lightweight space-biro to do my scribbling. It puts no strain on my quivering
    white tiny frozen hand.

    My hands are as tiny as those of the composer Scriabin. I wanted to compose music,
    delirious and ecstatic music, but instead I was sent to starship pursers'' training
    academy. There was no music there, only bleeping and whooshing and buzzing noises.
    At least it prepared me for the starship itself, where there is a constant din
    of bleeping and whooshing and buzzing, punctuated only by the strange gurgling
    sounds made by the ship''s vampire, Bosun Cugat. He claims they are involuntary,
    his gurglings, and apologises, a little too fulsomely for my liking. I would have
    him confined to the brig were it not that he would simply melt the metal bars
    with his basilisk glare and escape. I am not clear precisely what kind of vampire
    he is, just as I am unclear about palsy and ague. Ach Gott!, I was not cut out
    for this life. I ought to be sprawled on a divan in a dacha, composing ecstatic
    music.

    Captain''s Log, stardate Ides of March plus one. At the time of his death in stardate
    1915, Scriabin was working on his Mysterium, of which he wrote: "There will not
    be a single spectator. All will be participants. The work requires special people,
    special artists and a completely new culture. The cast of performers includes
    an orchestra, a large mixed choir, an instrument with visual effects, dancers,
    a procession, incense, and rhythmic textural articulation. The cathedral in which
    it will take place will not be of one single type of stone but will continually
    change with the atmosphere and motion of the Mysterium. This will be done with
    the aid of mists and lights, which will modify the architectural contours." He
    intended that the performance of this work, to be given in the foothills of the
    Himalayas, would last seven days and would be followed by the end of the world,
    with the human race replaced by "nobler beings".

    Captain''s Log, stardate Ides of March plus two. Bosun Cugat confronted me at
    suppertime yesterday and revealed that he had snuck a peek at this Log. He said
    I ought to be using it to note pertinent details of the starship and its space-voyage,
    rather than wittering on about Scriabin. He has whiffy oxters. I threw an aerosol
    can of space-deodorant at him and told him to use it. I am a nobler being than
    Bosun Cugat. I would like to compose my own Mysterium, but there is far too much
    faffing about to do on this damned starship. I think we have entered the Belt
    of Jiffy. I looked out of the starboard window and saw a gas giant.

    Captain''s Log, stardate Ides of March plus three. Whether or not we were in the
    Belt of Jiffy yesterday, we are nowhere near it now. Bosun Cugat has seized control
    of the starship and we are hurtling towards Saturn at warp factor God knows what.
    He has locked me in the space-janitor''s cupboard, with my biro and the captain''s
    log and a flask of dandelion and burdock and a few sticks of celery. Every now
    and then he comes hammering on the door and shouting questions at me, but refuses
    to let me out. His questions are technical ones, to which I do not always have
    ready answers. He wants to know if we should pass through the rings of Saturn
    or try to avoid them. Apparently he is going to land on the planet''s surface
    and go in search of the Suet Siphons of Saturn. Being a vampire, he will not require
    a spacesuit. What in heaven''s name he wants with suet I have no idea.

    Rummaging around in the cupboard I found a piccolo and a cowbell. I am passing
    the time composing a piece of delirious and ecstatic music for piccolo, cowbell
    and celery sticks. Scriabin would be proud of me, at least I like to think so.
    Hail to thee, blessed Alexander Nikolayevich!

    Captain''s Log, stardate Ides of March plus four. A couple of hours after we landed
    on Saturn, I heard Bosun Cugat''s dainty footsteps padding along the corridor.
    He stopped outside the space-janitor''s cupboard and the door whooshed open and
    he moaned and fell, crumpled, into my arms. For hours I cradled him, mussing his
    filthy hair and making cooing noises into his pointy ear. I know my duty. Eventually
    he gathered himself, and explained that he had located the suet siphons, teeming
    thousands of them, all lined up in neat rows on some kind of Saturnine plain or
    pampas. And every single one was exhausted. Not a spit of suet could be eked from
    a single siphon.

    "Do you not understand what this means?" he shrieked, "Others have been here before
    us!"

    I had to admit that this put something of a damper on our five-year mission to
    explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly
    go where no man has gone before.

    "Should we go in search of the suet?" I asked.

    But before Bosun Cugat could reply, he was engulfed in mists and lights which
    modified his corporeal contours. In front of my eyes, he was transmogrified into
    a nobler being. I looked out of the starboard window and saw that the universe
    had vanished. Scriabin''s Mysterium had come to pass. It was the end of the world.
    I picked up the piccolo and cowbell and celery sticks and played a threnody.
