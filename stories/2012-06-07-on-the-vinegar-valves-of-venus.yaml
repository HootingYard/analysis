  text: "Monsignor's Log, stardate the Millennium Feast of Saints Blot & Cugat. It\
    \ was a very special day, so I wore the least tatty of my vestments. The chasuble\
    \ is only slightly frayed, the stains on the cincture have faded, the alb, granted,\
    \ is little better than a rag. I cannot get the grease out of the amice, and the\
    \ stole is in tatters. The less said about the maniple the better. But by adjusting\
    \ the lighting so it played through the cobwebs I think only the sharpest-eyed\
    \ of congregants will have noticed. I did my best to disguise the stink by spraying\
    \ the chapel with an aerosol can of Essence of Blood of the Lamb. It was decocted,\
    \ of course, not from the real blood of a real lamb, but from chemical compounds\
    \ manufactured in the lab by boffins. I have seen pictures of so-called \u201C\
    real\u201D lambs in a codex. They look like tinier versions of sheep, if, that\
    \ is, they were drawn to scale. Who knows?\nIt being such a special day, the service\
    \ went on for much longer than usual. A couple of the faffers keeled over through\
    \ exhaustion. Why they volunteer for faffing duty when they are clearly not up\
    \ to it is a mystery. But it is not an ineffable mystery, not like the mystery\
    \ we were celebrating. Yes, believe it or not it is precisely one thousand years\
    \ since Saint Blot and Saint Cugat wrought the destruction of the old world and\
    \ brought into being the Eternal Kingdom of the Hideous Bat-God Fatso. In another\
    \ codex, I read that neither saint actually realised that that is what they were\
    \ doing. It's a moot point. I like to think that one or both of them at least\
    \ had an inkling. I have seen pictures of so-called \u201Creal\u201D inklings\
    \ on my Windows Vista screen. They look quite shimmery, sort of half way between\
    \ the stains on the cincture and the light playing through the cobwebs in the\
    \ bat-chapel.\nAfter the service I gave the crew special permission to play ping\
    \ pong in the narthex.\nI revived the fainted faffers using the Hot Pincers of\
    \ Saint Wilmot and got them to mop up the spillages from the service. It is, again,\
    \ a mystery, though not an ineffable one, why the prescribed form of worship of\
    \ the Hideous Bat-God Fatso has to be so terribly, terribly messy. But both the\
    \ codices and the Windows Vista screens are in agreement on this point. Fortunately\
    \ we have plenty of mops aboard the starship, enough at least until our next scheduled\
    \ landing, on the planet Willself. Rumours persist that intelligent life is to\
    \ be found there, but I am not convinced.\nMonsignor's Log, stardate the Feast\
    \ of Saint Von Straubenzee. Change of plan. We are now heading for Venus. I received\
    \ emergency orders on my metal tapping machine to go and investigate the Vinegar\
    \ Valves. Fatso has spoken.\nI looked up the Vinegar Valves of Venus in a codex.\
    \ Apparently, there are teeming thousands of them, lined up neatly in rows across\
    \ some kind of Venusian plains or pampas. It will be a risky adventure. In fact\
    \ I have already donned my helmet, and taken some protein pills. We have to check\
    \ all the valves to ensure there is no leakage of Venusian vinegar. It is one\
    \ of several types of Venusian gar, but I cannot find any reliable information\
    \ about the others. At times like this, I ask myself \u201CWhat would Cugat do?\u201D\
    \ Saint Cugat, the one-time Bosun Cugat, was of course a vampire, though the codices\
    \ and Windows Vista screens give varying accounts of exactly what kind of vampire\
    \ he was. He gurgled, we know that much. So, in preparation for the landing, I\
    \ gurgled too, but admittedly without conviction. I am afraid to say I have the\
    \ collywobbles. What terrors await us on Venus? What fierce fanged spittle-flecked\
    \ life-forms will bar our way to the Vinegar Valves?\nMonsignor's Log, same stardate,\
    \ quick update. We have landed on Venus and made our way across an inhospitable\
    \ wasteland, a wasteland unimagined by T S Eliot. It might possibly have been\
    \ imagined by Ezra Pound, but I will have to check that when back aboard the starship.\
    \ As we approached the plains or pampas whereon the teeming thousands of Vinegar\
    \ Valves of Venus are lined up in serried rows, we discovered our way was barred.\
    \ As I feared, fierce fanged spittle-flecked life-forms protect the Valves from\
    \ interplanetary interlopers. Peering at them, from a safe distance, through my\
    \ space-lorgnette, I had the distinct impression that they were akin to the lambs\
    \ I had seen pictures of in the codex. White, woolly, four legs, stupid facial\
    \ expressions\u2014and yet befanged, and fierce, and spittle-flecked. I took a\
    \ few snapshots and have transmitted them to the boffins in the lab. Now we must\
    \ wait, pending their report. I set up an altar and we celebrated Mass to pass\
    \ the time. An indigent faffer keeled over again, but this time it might have\
    \ something to do with the Venusian atmosphere. There is an overpowering stink\
    \ of vinegar in the air. I think the Valves are leaking.\nMonsignor's Log, stardate\
    \ the Feast of Saint Poxhaven. Gosh, what a calamity! Whatever those life-forms\
    \ were, Venusian versions of the baa-lambs that once bestrode the old Earth or\
    \ not, they were savage! Perhaps it was an error of judgement on my part to attempt\
    \ to convert them to Hideous Bat-God Fatsoism. As soon as they saw me mincing\
    \ towards them armed with the Hot Pincers of Saint Wilmot, they let out an awful\
    \ collective keening. I have never heard anything like it, save for one of the\
    \ more alarming passages in Saint Blot's Threnody for Piccolo, Cowbell, and Celery\
    \ Sticks. I dropped the Hot Pincers of Saint Wilmot on to the Venusian dust and\
    \ slammed my hands over my ears, and ran screaming back to the landing module.\
    \ The pilot-faffer had keeled over, so I had to take the controls myself. Not\
    \ having much experience in flying the module, or indeed any experience whatsoever,\
    \ I completely missed the starship. We are now zooming at warp factor unstoppable\
    \ into the empty vastness of space. It is empty, and vast. And all I can do is\
    \ gurgle."
