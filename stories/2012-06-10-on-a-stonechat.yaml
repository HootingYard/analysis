  text: "From within his concrete pillbox, he spotted a stonechat. Never having seen\
    \ a stonechat before, he did not recognise it for what it was. His mind reeled,\
    \ as minds will reel when faced with the unknown. He flapped his arms, and then\
    \ he calmed himself and consulted his field guide. It was dark in the pillbox,\
    \ so he took from his satchel his torch and depressed the knob to switch its light\
    \ on, but the torch was dead. No light shone.\nAre those not terrible words? Consider\
    \ them for a moment. Chew them, as it were, within your mind. No light shone.\
    \ That is what the world must have been like before the formation of the sun.\
    \ But the sun did form, and light did shine, but the roof and walls of the concrete\
    \ pillbox blocked it out and there was only a thin slit through which he was able\
    \ to spot the thing he knew not, which was a stonechat. The stonechat was outside\
    \ the pillbox, on the heath, and they were lit up by the sun, heath and stonechat,\
    \ both of them, but not him, not the interior of the pillbox with its small cement\
    \ bench and shelf. There was nothing on the shelf.\nHe rummaged in his satchel,\
    \ by touch, sure he had some spare batteries for the torch. He did not know that\
    \ they had fallen out, upon the heath, a mile back, though a rent in the lining\
    \ at the base of the satchel, a rent he had not noticed, for when he set out it\
    \ was barely noticeable, but when heading for the heath he passed through a patch\
    \ of thorn bushes, and the satchel was snagged on a mighty thorn, and the rent\
    \ was rent further, enlarged, and shortly thereafter the batteries fell to the\
    \ ground upon the heath, but he did not register the tiny diminution in the weight\
    \ of his satchel occasioned by the loss of these important objects. He had other\
    \ claims on his attention at the time, his plodding, for one, the avoidance of\
    \ puddles in his plodding, for it had rained relentlessly for hour upon hour before\
    \ he set out for the heath through the thorn bushes.\nIt was when the rain ceased\
    \ that he set out. He hoisted his satchel over his shoulder, the satchel with\
    \ the fateful rent already present in embryonic form. He set great store by a\
    \ well-packed satchel. \u201CI set great store by a well-packed satchel\u201D\
    \ was something he had said more than once, much more than once, to members of\
    \ his family and to friends and even to himself, aloud, as was his habit. On this\
    \ day he had packed, during the last of the rainfall, a pair of binoculars and\
    \ a propelling pencil and a notepad and a torch and spare batteries and a field\
    \ guide and sausage sandwiches wrapped in greaseproof paper and a flask of hot\
    \ cocoa. Due to the disposition of the contents within the well-packed satchel\
    \ only the spare batteries fell through the thorn-enlarged rent, on to the heath,\
    \ a mile before he reached the concrete pillbox, the interior of which was dark,\
    \ for the sun could not penetrate its roof and walls. Light cannot penetrate concrete.\
    \ That is a lesson humankind has learned.\nBecause the spare batteries lay, ruined,\
    \ in a puddle on the heath, his rummaging by touch in the dark proved fruitless.\
    \ We knew it would be so, for we have been told about the rent. We are better\
    \ informed than him. It is even possible that we would recognise a stonechat when\
    \ we saw one, were we sat in a concrete pillbox on the heath after the rain, peering\
    \ out, peering out into the light, through binoculars. That is a moot point, and\
    \ can remain so without consequences of any kind. It hardly matters, in the run\
    \ of things. But it does matter to him, because had he recognised the stonechat\
    \ for what it was, a stonechat, he would not have sought recourse to his field\
    \ guide, he would not have tried in vain to switch on his torch, he would not\
    \ have rummaged in the satchel for the spare batteries, and he would not have\
    \ discovered the rent in the lining. At least, not then. He would have discovered\
    \ it sooner or later, but in different circumstances, back at home, for example,\
    \ where he would have needle and thread and thus the means to mend the rent. \u201C\
    Damn damn damn\u201D he said to himself, aloud, and the words were followed by\
    \ the silent thought that he ought to have packed needle and thread in his satchel,\
    \ followed by a further silent thought that, depending on whereabouts within the\
    \ satchel he had packed the needle and thread they too might have fallen out upon\
    \ the heath, into a puddle. There were all sorts of possibilities, the more he\
    \ thought about them, and he did, for a while, think of them, in a rush, as sometimes\
    \ thoughts will come in a rush, tumbling one after another through our heads,\
    \ unstoppable, often irrational, especially in the dark, where there is little\
    \ or no light to distract us, by making visible things to turn our attention from\
    \ the innards of our own brains.\nBut he was mindful of the dangers of the darkness,\
    \ if \u201Cdangers\u201D is not too strong a word, and so he hefted his satchel\
    \ and emerged from the concrete pillbox into the light, on to the heath. His sudden\
    \ bustling alarmed the stonechat, and it flew away. He watched it, silhouetted\
    \ against the sky, growing tinier as it grew more distant, until it was a mere\
    \ speck, until it vanished completely. And it occurred to him to sketch it, the\
    \ memory of the sight of it, while it was fresh in his mind. He placed the satchel\
    \ on the heath and took from it his propelling pencil and notepad and he shut\
    \ his eyes to see the stonechat in his mind, as he had seen it minutes before\
    \ through the slit in the wall of the pillbox, and he drew what he remembered,\
    \ as best he could. But he was at best a cackhanded sketcher.\nHome again, he\
    \ showed his sketch to his dearest, who knew all there is to know about all the\
    \ birds of the air.\n\u201CWhat was it I saw?\u201D he said,\nHis dearest had\
    \ no clue, for his sketch did not resemble a stonechat in the slightest. We might\
    \ ask, then, what, if anything, he had achieved, on that day, after the rain,\
    \ striding out through gorse and thorn bushes to the heath, and the concrete pillbox?\
    \ There are several answers, and we shall leave them hanging in the air. To ask\
    \ them is enough."
