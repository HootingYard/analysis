  text: "Facecloth, which some people continue to insist on calling Facebook in spite\
    \ of my cajoling, grows ever more ubiquitous. At times it really does seem to\
    \ have taken over the world. Efforts by others to supplant it\u2014Google+ for\
    \ example\u2014have only limited success, and I think this may be because the\
    \ alternatives so far are too similar to Facecloth. There is also the fact that\
    \ Zuckerberg and his minions adapt their monolith to ape the best features of\
    \ their competitors. What this suggests to me is that if there is to be a social\
    \ networking site that can consign Facecloth to the dustbin of history, it will\
    \ have to be so far in advance of the original that little Mark will take one\
    \ look at it, burst into tears, dismantle his entire operation, and retire from\
    \ the fray. I think I have now come up with the goods, daddy-o.\nMy insight was\
    \ granted by going back to basics, and considering the original name, Facecloth.\
    \ Sorry, Facebook. As far as I am aware, this refers to the practice of American\
    \ higher education colleges of issuing yearbooks containing snapshots and potted\
    \ biographies of their students. Little Mark took that very simple format as the\
    \ building block for world domination. But therein\u2014I realised\u2014lie the\
    \ seeds of his destruction. Break the word in two. Face. Book. It is all so damned\
    \ two-dimensional. Photographs of faces, gathered in a book of flat pages with\
    \ printed words. It is just not good enough, even when modified and complicated\
    \ and transformed into a global phenomenon on Het Internet. It seems clear to\
    \ me that the whole thing needs to be shifted up into three dimensions. And that\
    \ is the beauty of Headbag!\nJust think. Why be satisfied with the face when you\
    \ could have the whole head? And what kind of nincompoop would be happy with a\
    \ book of flat paper pages when they could have a bag packed with solid objects?\
    \ It is so blindingly obvious I am surprised nobody has thought of it before.\n\
    But perhaps they have, and have raised objections. After all, if you are going\
    \ to stuff a bag full of heads, where are you going to get the heads from? We\
    \ do not want to encourage those Islamist nutcases whose greatest joy in life,\
    \ when not persecuting women, is to chop off the heads of infidels. But, using\
    \ the kind of lateral thinking espoused by geniuses like Edward \u201CSix Hats\u201D\
    \ De Bono, we need not cram our bag with human heads. Instead, we can use cabbages\
    \ as a substitute. Carefully picked, cabbage heads are about the weight, size,\
    \ and shape of human heads, and if you are pernickety you can always draw facial\
    \ features on the cabbage with a magic marker, and apply a variety of superb and\
    \ exciting hairstyles with cotton wool and glue. It is then a simple case of shoving,\
    \ say, half a dozen or even a baker's dozen of cabbages into a burlap sack of\
    \ the appropriate size, and voila!, you have signed up to Headbag. You will receive\
    \ a confirmatory metal tapping machine message, to which you should respond using\
    \ a special code to demonstrate that you are a real person, toting a real bag,\
    \ filled with real cabbages. Once that is received and processed and filed away\
    \ in a filing cabinet drawer at Headbag HQ, you are off and away!\nWhat we found,\
    \ in our preliminary research, was that the best way to network with other Headbag\
    \ users was to find a suitable three-dimensional real-world location and to gather\
    \ there, each of you with your burlap sack of cabbages. Caves, particularly caves\
    \ by the seaside, proved to be the best spots of all. A particular advantage is\
    \ that they tend not to be haunted by anybody else. Vagrants, drunks, and riff-raff\
    \ are all more likely to be found slumped in municipal parks and on the outskirts\
    \ of leisure and retail facilities, whereas the caves we reconnoitred were empty.\
    \ Occasionally there might be a small creeping creature of dubious provenance\
    \ scuttling about, but they can always be stamped on or, if of a somewhat larger\
    \ bulk, sprayed with a canister of some death-delivering chemical compound. When\
    \ the cave is properly vacant, it makes for a splendid meeting-place for Headbag\
    \ users. You might want to take along a torch or a Tilly lamp, and a packed lunch.\n\
    There are all sorts of rewarding ways that a group of persons each with a bag\
    \ full of cabbages can interact. You probably don't need me to tell you what they\
    \ are. In fact, doing so would fatally undermine the sheer beauty of the Headbag\
    \ experience, which is posited on giving users full control. There is none of\
    \ that sneaky shenanigans going on in the background that you get with Facecloth.\
    \ None of your details will be passed to sinister multinational corporations.\
    \ You will not find a data trail linking you to unseemly or criminal activities.\
    \ No, with Headbag, you can be sure your privacy is safe. You sit in a cave, by\
    \ the sea, with other users, clutching your sack of cabbages, and do whatever\
    \ you want to do, without Headbag HQ interfering in any way. All we ask is that\
    \ you be very careful to scarper before the tide comes in, flooding the cave,\
    \ as tides tend to do.\nOne question that often crops up at our marketing seminars\
    \ is how we will make sufficient money from Headbag to reduce little Mark Zuckerberg\
    \ to comparative penury and have him come grovelling to our door with a begging\
    \ bowl. In the interests of robust transparency, I should point out that your\
    \ burlap sack will carry advertising, stencilled on using luminous ink or paint\
    \ which will be visible in the dank darkness of your cave. That is our only concession\
    \ to the commercial realm. Please do not believe any stories you read in the press\
    \ that we have plans to force users to rent their cabbages from us. You are free\
    \ to buy them from your local greengrocer's or hypermarket, or even to grow them\
    \ yourself on your allotment, out beyond the viaduct by the railway tracks. That\
    \ is the Headbag way, like it or lump it.\nOnward to world domination!"
