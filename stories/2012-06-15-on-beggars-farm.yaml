  text: 'I am often accosted in the streets by wild-eyed maniacs who block my path
    and jab me on the shoulder with bony fingers, demanding to be told how I arrive,
    each day, at a topic to write about. As I am reluctant to divulge the true nature
    of the Hooting Yard creative process, I usually babble sufficient nonsense to
    satisfy my assailant, who allows me on my way. This morning, however, on my way
    back from a circuit of Nameless Pond, I felt curiously impelled to tell the truth.
    Let me reproduce the dialogue verbatim, or as verbatim as I can recall it, to
    give you a glimpse into the travails of your favourite penniless scribbler.

    Me--(sashaying along, humming The Final Countdown (Tempest), by the European band
    Sweden... sorry, I mean the Swedish band Europe).

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--Oi! Mr Key!

    Me--Yes, my good fellow, how may I be of assistance on this rain-drenched morn?

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--(blocking my path and jabbing me on the shoulder with bony fingers)
    What are you going to write about today and how did you decide upon the topic?
    Answer me that!

    Me - You mean "answer me those".

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--Quit stalling, buster, and spill the beans!

    Me--Have you been reading decades-old American pulp fiction, perchance?

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--Of course not! Like any sensible wild-eyed maniac, I read only
    the dispatches from Hooting Yard, to the exclusion of all else!

    Me--Very astute, if I may say so.

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--You may. But now answer my question. I mean, questions.

    Me - Although I am usually reluctant to divulge the true nature of the Hooting
    Yard creative process, for some inexplicable reason I feel impelled to tell you
    how I arrived at today''s topic. Be warned, however, that my reply is only applicable
    to this particular day in the middle of June in the year of Our Lord MMXII.

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--Bob''s your uncle.

    Me - In spite of the song I chose to be humming when you accosted me, I am, as
    you are probably well aware, curiously obsessed with Jethro Tull. God knows why.
    That being the case, my very first thought, on waking, before I even plunged my
    head into a pail of icy water, was of the early albums of Jethro Tull, and how
    perhaps Ian Anderson could be said to have lost his mojo circa 1974. Some would
    say even earlier, perhaps in 1972. Whichever date one chooses, I suspect there
    is general agreement that the band''s best work, and the work for which it will
    be remembered, yea unto every generation, appears on those first few releases.
    Of those, however, the debut album This Was (1968) is sometimes overlooked, possibly
    because of the strong blues influence and the presence of Mick Abrahams as a creative
    rival to Anderson--two things which are of course connected. In that sense, it
    is atypical of early Tull. Not having listened to it for a long long time, I tried
    to recall some of the songs, and the one that jumped to the surface of my brain
    was Beggar''s Farm. It was but a short step from there to making the decision
    to write about a beggar''s farm today. Not, I hasten to add, to write about the
    song, but instead to appropriate the title, and write some majestic sweeping paragraphs
    about a farm populated entirely by beggars.

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--Gosh!

    Me--Before I could concentrate on the ineffable glory of my prose, however, I
    found myself fretting away about the apostrophe in Beggar''s.

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--This is absolutely fascinating, and it reminds me why you are
    surely the greatest living writer of English prose apart from Jeanette Winterson.

    Me--You see, Anderson and Abrahams, as co-writers, seem to have had just one beggar
    in mind, placing the apostrophe between the R and the S. But my farm, the one
    gradually taking shape in my head, populated by beggars and indigents and tramps
    and drunks and wretches, would demand the apostrophe after the S, to reflect the
    plurality of beggars. Thus I was in a quandary. Should I entitle the essay On
    Beggar''s Farm, to reflect its fons et origo, or On Beggars'' Farm, to more accurately
    signal to the panting and overexcited reader what to expect?

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--How on earth did you know that we Hooting Yard readers pant
    with overexcitement as our Windows Vista computer screens are lit up each day
    by your latest scribblings?

    Me--I have my spies. But tell me, what would you advise regarding the placement
    of that pesky apostrophe?

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--It''s a tricksy one, make no mistake.

    Me - I think it is important that I give due credit to the monopod flautist and
    the founder of Blodwyn Pig. The idea of the beggar''s farm is theirs, and theirs
    alone, and I am merely plodding in their footsteps--or, in Anderson''s case, footstep.
    I have always assumed he got from place to place by hopping, at least while playing
    the flute.

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--I have heard that is indeed the case.

    Me--At the same time, I do not wish my title to be grammatically incorrect, nor
    to lead the panting and overexcited readers into thinking they will be reading
    about a farm with only a single beggar in situ. I envisage dozens, if not hundreds,
    of beggars, sprawled or lolloping about the farm, surrounded by rusty abandoned
    farm implements and machinery, growing nothing on fields reduced to scrub and
    gorse and bracken, rattling their tin cups at passers-by, moaning and keening
    and displaying a variety of unsightly sores and scars and stumps resulting from
    the amputation of one or more limbs. If the setting is shortly after a war, several
    of the beggars may have been gassed in the trenches.

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--I can''t wait to read it!

    Me--But wait you shall, until I am able to work out where to put the damned apostrophe.

    Wild-Eyed Maniac--(his attention suddenly diverted, pointing at the sky) Oh look,
    a flock of swooping feathered beings with wings!

    Me--They are called birds.

    And so we went our separate ways, I returning to my escritoire to struggle with
    an apostrophe placement crisis.
