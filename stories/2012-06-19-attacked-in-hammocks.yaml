  text: "10/20\_: Attacked in hammocks by tiny gnat not over one tenth of an inch\
    \ in length; mosquito nets no protection; gnats bite all night allowing no sleep.\n\
    10/21\_: Another sleepless night on account of blood-sucking gnats.\n10/22\_:\
    \ My body mass of bumps from insect bites, wrists and hands swollen from bites\
    \ of tiny gnats. 2 nights with almost no sleep\u2014simply terrible. Rain during\
    \ noon, all afternoon and most of night. My shoes have been soaked since starting.\
    \ Worst ticks so far.\n10/23\_: Horrible night with worst biting gnats yet; even\
    \ smoke of no avail.\n10/24: More than half ill from insects. Wrists and hands\
    \ swollen. Paint limbs with iodine.\n10/25\_: Arose to find termites covering\
    \ everything left on the ground. Blood-sucking gnats still with us.\n10/30\_:\
    \ Sweat bees, gnats and \u201Cpolverinahs\u201D (blood-sucking gnats) terrible.\n\
    11/2\_: My right eye is sadly blurred by gnats.\n11/3\_: Bees and gnats worse\
    \ than ever; truly \u201Cthere's no rest for the weary\u201D.\n11/5\_: My first\
    \ experience with flesh- and carrion-eating bees. Biting gnats in clouds\u2014\
    very worst we have encountered\u2014rendering one's food unpalatable by filling\
    \ it with their filthy bodies, their bellies red and disgustingly distended with\
    \ one's own blood.\nfrom the 1920 Amazonian expedition diary of Ernest Holt, quoted\
    \ in The Lost City Of Z by David Grann (2009)"
