  text: 'There are certain beasts and creatures for which the names we use are inaccurate
    and misleading. A seahorse is not a horse, nor is a jellyfish a fish. Doubly erroneous
    is the guinea pig, which does not come from Guinea and is not a pig. It is all
    very perplexing, never more so than in the case of the rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion
    corncrake. Let us take each element of its appellation in turn, and examine just
    how foolish it is of us to name it so.

    Rare. This is not, by a long stretch, a rare beast. There are teeming millions
    of them, if not billions, though naturalists have yet to arrive at a definitive
    number. To list their habitats would take us all day, and probably into tomorrow.
    Suffice to say there is nowhere on earth they will not thrive, from grasslands,
    heaths, and moors to densely forested woodland, polar wasteland, steaming jungles,
    and urban hellholes. You will find them both near and far from any sea. I realise
    I have begun to list their habitats, and will stop now, bearing in mind what I
    just said about how bloody long it would take. The point is made, that the rare
    golden enigmatic tatterdemalion corncrake is not at all rare. You might protest
    that you have never seen one, or at least cannot recall ever seeing one, but that
    is because they are shy and retiring and extremely skilled at hiding from humankind.
    Even if you did see one, there is every likelihood you would not recognise it
    for what it was, as you would be on the lookout for something rare and golden
    and enigmatic and tatterdemalion and corncrakey, and as I shall demonstrate, it
    is none of these things.

    Golden. Pish! There is no way this creature can be described as "golden". Red,
    maybe, or blue, perhaps even orangey-yellowy, but never golden. At blaze of noon,
    perhaps, you might think it golden, or goldenish, but what you would be seeing
    is the mighty burning golden rays of the sunlight, not the actual colour of the
    rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion corncrake.

    Enigmatic. What does that even mean? Let us turn, as always, to the OED, which
    defines "enigmatic" as Pertaining to, or of the nature of, an enigma, containing
    or resembling an enigma: ambiguous, obscure, perplexing. Of persons: Mysterious;
    baffling conjecture as to character, sentiments, identity, or history. An enigma
    itself, we are told, is A short composition in prose or verse, in which something
    is described by intentionally obscure metaphors, in order to afford an exercise
    for the ingenuity of the reader or hearer in guessing what is meant; a riddle.
    How far does that get us, in considering the rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion
    corncrake? If we extend "Of persons" to "Of persons and beasts and creatures and
    all the birds of the air", which I think we are justified in doing at this stage
    of our investigation, then I would aver that the most enigmatic thing about the
    rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion corncrake is that we apply the word "enigmatic"
    to it. That in itself is perplexing and mysterious and baffling, is it not? But
    if we continue down that road we are going to become horribly entangled in a hall
    of mirrors. Oops, I am mixing my metaphors. Let me say instead that we are going
    to become horribly entangled in a thicket of nettles which has unaccountably sprouted
    in a patch of soil within a hall of mirrors. For that image, I can rely on historical
    precedent, as it is said that Prince Fulgencio, that black-hearted monster, had
    such a thicket of nettles within the hall of mirrors within his palace. But that
    is a topic for another time, tomorrow perhaps. For now, I do not wish to become
    disorientated in the hall of mirrors suggested by the idea that the only thing
    remotely enigmatic about the rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion corncrake is
    that the word "enigmatic" appears in its name. See, I am already repeating myself,
    dizzy-brained, my mind in chaos. We had best move on to the next word in the chain.

    Tatterdemalion. A person in tattered clothing; a ragged or beggarly fellow; a
    ragamuffin--the OED again. How indispensable it is! And again we must extend "person"
    to include beasts and creatures and all the birds of the air. Even minimal familiarity
    with the pernickety grooming habits of the rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion
    corncrake shows us that this is a wildly inaccurate description of the beast.
    Several tiptop naturalists have written at length on its neat and tidy appearance,
    achieved through hour upon hour of pernickety grooming. Given the vicissitudes
    of the natural world, however, it is only to be expected that there will be circumstances
    every now and then when even the neatest and tidiest of creatures will appear
    ragged and tattered and bedraggled. In the case of the rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion
    corncrake, these might include exposure to gale-force winds, dunking in storm-tossed
    oceans, and being caught and dragged, by one of its many, many predators, through
    a thicket of nettles on its way to the predator''s lair or nest. At all other
    times the word "tatterdemalion" is completely inappropriate.

    Corncrake. The rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion corncrake bears about as much
    resemblance to a standard corncrake as a seahorse does to a standard horse, a
    jellyfish to a standard fish, or a guinea pig to a standard pig. We can try to
    make more sense of this part of its name if we split the word into two, corn and
    crake. While it is emphatically the case that the creature is to be found in rippling
    cornfields, we have already stated that there is nowhere on earth it is not found.
    Thus it is just as likely to be hiding in a field of rippling corn as it is in
    a field of other rippling crops, or on moorland or heath, or anywhere else you
    might possibly think of. The question of how it hides itself on open land such
    as moor and heath is so complicated that I cannot bear the thought of trying to
    explain it to you in language you would understand. As for the crake, that is
    merely an approximation of the kind of noise it might make, were you to overhear
    it and try to write down in letters of the alphabet what you thought you had heard.
    But please, on no account should you pay any attention to the fathead who claims
    that "crake" is the noise it makes if you cause it alarm and it flees in fear
    and terror. On the contrary, it will softly and suddenly vanish away--for the
    rare golden enigmatic tatterdemalion corncrake is a Boojum, you see.'
