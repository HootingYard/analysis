  text: 'The ventriloquist Claud Plon was out for a spin in his jalopy when he had
    a prang. He hit a lamppost, the collision with which rent and twisted the bonnet
    of the jalopy, exposing part of the engine, which belched forth jets of steam.

    "Oops!" said his dummy, a puppet called Bonko. Bonko was a sock stuffed with kapok
    who had a couple of glass beads sewn on to serve as eyes.

    "Sorry about that, Bonko, I wasn''t looking where I was going," said the ventriloquist,
    "Are you all right?"

    "I think I have suffered a whiplash injury," replied Bonko, who may have been
    lying, as to the untrained eye he looked perfectly okay.

    "Goodness gracious!" said Claud Plon, "We shall have to get you to the doll hospital."

    "Why on earth would we go to a doll hospital?" asked Bonko, "I am not a doll.
    I am a sock stuffed with kapok with a couple of glass beads sewn on to serve as
    eyes."

    "Yes, I see your point," said Plon, "Then what about a puppet clinic?"

    "Is there such a place as a puppet clinic?" asked Bonko.

    "I have heard tell there is one in Pointy Town," said the ventriloquist.

    "But we are miles and miles away," said Bonko, "And I fear my whiplash may be
    fatal, for I can already feel myself succumbing to faintness and a lack of oxygen
    to the brain, pins and needles, darting pains behind my glass beads, and the gradual
    oozing of the very life out of me."

    This time Bonko was definitely lying, or at least embroidering the truth. But
    Claud Plon was both devoted and gullible. It would never occur to him that Bonko
    might be trying to pull the wool over his eyes, which in the ventriloquist''s
    case were real, working eyes, not mere sewn-on glass beads. There had been occasions
    in the past when people suggested that Bonko might be a mendacious fantasist,
    and Plon had been so inflamed with outrage that he had beaten the accusers about
    the head with a shovel. Bonko egged him on, urging him to bash and bash and bash
    until the bashee was dead.

    Plon was now in something of a panic. Bonko, who was a fine judge of distance,
    was absolutely correct that they were very far away from Pointy Town and its puppet
    clinic. Also, the prang had been severe enough to render the jalopy motionless.
    Crank it as frantically as he could, it was not going anywhere. Steam continued
    to hiss from the bonnet.

    "What are we going to do?" wailed Plon.

    "You had better think of something quickly, because I am fading fast," said Bonko,
    "It is as if I am in a long, dark tunnel, and there is an unearthly light towards
    which I feel impelled to go."

    "Don''t go into the light!" screamed Plon, remembering certain supernatural thriller
    films he had seen.

    "But it is such an attractive light," said Bonko, "I feel drawn to it."

    Claud Plon could think of nothing but to repeat his shrieked words. At which point
    the jalopy burst into flames. The ventriloquist and his dummy would surely have
    been engulfed and burned to a crisp had not a big red fire engine screeched to
    a halt beside them, bells clanging, and the fire been doused by untold gallons
    of water spurting from a hose trained upon the jalopy by three heroic firemen.
    Seconds later, there was further clanging, and an ambulance pulled up, out of
    which poured three heroic paramedics. They grabbed the ventriloquist and shoved
    him with skilled gentleness onto a stretcher.

    "Never mind about me," he cried, "Save Bonko!"

    But as he cried out a needle was injected into his arm and a fast-acting narcotic
    coursed through his veins and he lost consciousness.


    Claud Plon awoke next day, flat on his back in a bed in a ward of the Hattie Jacques
    Memorial Hospital. His brain was dizzy, he bore a few singe-marks here and there,
    but was otherwise as fit as a fiddle. He looked wildly around, but there was no
    sign of Bonko. He pressed a buzzer at his bedside, summoning an angel of mercy.
    Plon raved; was not understood; and was drugged back into unconsciousness.


    There is, high on a hill in a rustic backwater some miles from Pointy Town, a
    big grim crenellated smoke-blackened mansion, once the home of robber barons but
    now a home for the bewildered and befuddled and frankly bonkers. Claud Plon, the
    ventriloquist and one-time star of the variety theatre, has lived here for twenty
    years, having been delivered on a stretcher, manacled, at dead of night. In his
    room in one of the towers, he raves and mutters. He goes barefoot, for the staff
    have a standing instruction never to allow him anywhere near socks. His simple
    tunic and trousers are fastened with zips, for it is thought best not to give
    him buttons, so easily mistaken for beads of glass. He has no visitors.


    There is, at the foot of a hill in a rustic backwater some miles from Pointy Town,
    a rubbish dump. Over the years it has grown as it is piled ever higher with waste,
    things discarded, things bent and broken, things forgotten and abandoned, big
    and small, from lollipop sticks to wrecked jalopies. Within this midden, open
    to the elements, frayed around the edges and still bearing the singe-marks from
    a fire twenty years ago, there is a sock. It was once stuffed with kapok, much
    of which has fallen out. It once had two glass beads sewn on, where now there
    is only one. Sometimes urchins and wastrels and beggars will come trudging through
    the waste in search of scraps and scantlings. It is said that, when the air is
    still and the gulls cease shrieking, a voice can be heard, from somewhere in the
    dump, a peevish, rancorous, cursing voice, spitting with vituperation.

    "Let me into the fucking light!" it cries.'
