  text: 'The British explorer Percy Fawcett vanished in the Amazon jungle, along with
    his son Jack and a friend of Jack''s, in 1925. Fawcett was searching for the remains
    of an ancient mythical (and mystical) city he called Z. Over the following years,
    many attempts were made to find him...

    Many Brazilians told us that, over the past few decades, religious cults had spring
    up in the area that worshipped Fawcett as a kind of god. They believed that Fawcett
    had entered a network of underground tunnels and discovered that Z was, of all
    things, a portal to another reality. Even though Brian Fawcett had concealed his
    father''s bizarre writings at the end of his life, these mystics had seized upon
    Fawcett''s few cryptic references, in magazines such as the Occult Review, to
    his search for "the treasures of the invisible World". These writings, coupled
    with Fawcett''s disappearance and the failure of anyone over the years to discover
    his remains, fuelled the notion that he had somehow defied the laws of physics.

    One sect, called the Magical Nucleus, was started, in 1968, by a man named Udo
    Luckner, who referred to himself as the High Priest of the Roncador and wore a
    long white gown and a cylindrical hat with a Star of David. In the 1970s, scores
    of Brazilians and Europeans, including Fawcett''s great-nephew, flocked to join
    the Magical Nucleus, hoping to find this portal. Luckner built a religious compound
    by the Roncador Mountains, where families were forbidden to eat meat or wear jewelry.
    Luckner predicted that the world would end in 1982 and said that his people must
    prepare to descend into the hollow earth. But, when the planet remained in existence,
    the Magical Nucleus gradually disbanded.
