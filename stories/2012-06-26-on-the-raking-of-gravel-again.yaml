  text: "With my rake and my shovel\n  I shift around gravel\n  For I am the handyman-gardener\
    \ of Hoon\n  I am weird and uncanny\n  And I look at you funny\n  And wolves howl\
    \ at the full moon\nThis was, apparently, the song attributed to the handyman-gardener\
    \ of Hoon, a weird and uncanny fellow with a squint in one eye whose chief occupation\
    \ was the raking and shovelling of gravel. The song, thought to be broadly autobiographical,\
    \ was recorded by folk song collector Cecil Flat, to an accompaniment of piccolo,\
    \ accordion and marimbas. More recently, the argumentative German improv group\
    \ Weltschmerz devised an argumentative improv version, in which the words are\
    \ recited in guttural shouts against a backdrop of tuneless tape-recorded shovelling\
    \ and raking of gravel. Inevitably, this shot to the top of the hit parade and\
    \ the band appeared on several overexcitable teenage pop television shows. Eagle-eyed\
    \ viewers noticed, in the heaving throng of the studio mosh pit on one such show,\
    \ an elderly man, weird and uncanny, with a squint in one eye, holding in one\
    \ hand a shovel and in the other a rake. He appeared to have gravel sprinkled\
    \ in his hair. He was only on screen for a few seconds, but those who saw him\
    \ were convinced they had spotted the handyman-gardener of Hoon. Alas, this was\
    \ in the days before Het Internet and YouTube, and no copy of the broadcast is\
    \ known to exist. We have only the letters pages of the following week's teenage\
    \ pop press to turn to.\nDear Teenage Pop Press, reads one typical letter, Yesterday\
    \ evening, as we do every week, my family gathered around the bakelite television\
    \ set in our ill-starred yet snug hovel to watch The Overexcitable Teenage Pop\
    \ Television Show. There were some fantastic beat combos playing, including Agnetha\
    \ and Anni-Frid and Benny and Bjorn, John and Yoko, the Bernard Levin Madrigal\
    \ Singers, Gordon Sumner's Gordon Sumner Tribute Band, Level 42, A Flock Of Seagulls,\
    \ Tony Gubba's Gubtastic Gubba Gubba Hey Group, and a chap standing on one leg\
    \ playing the flute. What we were waiting for, of course, was the smash hit Song\
    \ Of The Handyman-Gardener Of Hoon performed by Weltschmerz. Now here is the intriguing\
    \ thing. When the argumentative German improv group were making a din with their\
    \ shouting and their rakes and their shovels, the camera cut away for a few seconds\
    \ to the studio mosh pit, wherein a teeming throng of overexcited teenage persons\
    \ were cavorting and cutting capers, as is de rigueuer. In among them, I am sure\
    \ I spotted an elderly man, weird and uncanny, with a squint in one eye, holding\
    \ in one hand a shovel and in the other a rake, who appeared to have gravel sprinkled\
    \ in his hair. Could it be that this was the handyman-gardener of Hoon himself?\
    \ And if so, why was he in the mosh pit, rather than up on stage with the band,\
    \ shouting out his own song?\nIn the following week's issue came a response:\n\
    Dear Teenage Pop Press, it read, Further to the letter in last week's issue regarding\
    \ the elderly man, weird and uncanny, with a squint in one eye, holding in one\
    \ hand a shovel and in the other a rake, who appeared to have gravel sprinkled\
    \ in his hair and who appeared for a few seconds on screen during Weltschmerz's\
    \ deafening performance of the Song Of The Handyman-Gardener Of Hoon on television\
    \ recently, I think the person your correspondent spotted was me. I am elderly.\
    \ I have been described, both by strangers and by members of my own family as\
    \ weird. There is certainly something uncanny to be seen whenever I look in the\
    \ mirror. On the evening in question I attended the television studio with both\
    \ a rake and a shovel about my person, for reasons I have been advised by tiptop\
    \ legal advisers not to bruit about in the popular press. The one point on which\
    \ I would take issue is that I did not have gravel sprinkled in my hair. I tend\
    \ my magnificent bouffant with great care, and would never be so neglectful of\
    \ its preening to allow gravel to become sprinkled in it. There is the possibility\
    \ that what your correspondent saw was electrical or electronic interference,\
    \ given the primitive state of transmission on black and white television screens\
    \ at this point in history, when we have not yet progressed to colour, or high\
    \ definition, or whatever further wonders the pipe-smoking boffins have up their\
    \ sleeves. Though it may be thought that I am a tad too elderly to go cavorting\
    \ and cutting capers in a mosh pit, it has long been my habit to go in search\
    \ of the hero inside myself, until I find the key to my life. This has led me\
    \ down some unexpected by-ways. It is not, for example, the only time I have been\
    \ mistaken for the handyman-gardener of Hoon, even by myself. The day after the\
    \ television show I was taking a stroll along the canal towpath near fields and\
    \ a spinney and standing stones and an army firing range surrounded by an electrified\
    \ fence when I came to a rustic cottage. Its grounds were strewn with gravel.\
    \ As I had my shovel and my rake with me, for reasons which again I am not minded\
    \ to divulge, I took it in to my head to do a spot of shovelling and raking of\
    \ the gravel, on the spur of the moment. After all, it occurred to me that this\
    \ might be the key to my life. And so it proved. I have been happily shifting\
    \ about gravel with my rake and my shovel ever since, and I am now waiting for\
    \ the next full moon, to hear if wolves will howl, as was foretold in the song.\n\
    I have studied all available documentation from that time and that place but am\
    \ so far unable to confirm whether or not wolves did indeed howl at the full moon.\
    \ The only hint I found was a report in Recordings Of Wolves Howling magazine,\
    \ in which the member of Weltschmerz with the severest haircut gave an argumentative\
    \ interview in which he revealed that the band had been making tape-recordings\
    \ of the howling of wolves. He did not explain why."
