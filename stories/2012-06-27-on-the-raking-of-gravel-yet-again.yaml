  text: "Have I exhausted the topic of the raking of gravel, specifically the raking\
    \ of gravel by an eerie and enigmatic handyman-gardener? I suspect I probably\
    \ have. It is high time we moved on to other topics, ones of more import, even\
    \ perhaps of lesser import, but irrespective of their relative import at the very\
    \ least different, wildly, vertiginously different, from gravel, and its raking.\
    \ There is only so much to be said. Indeed, one might be better occupied actually,\
    \ physically shifting gravel about with a rake than writing about it. Do not for\
    \ a moment think that that has not occurred to me. Had I a stretch of gravel on\
    \ a pathway outside my domain, I would certainly have raked it by now, several\
    \ times, during the past few days. But the pathway outside my domain is covered\
    \ with flagstones, and I own no rake. Thus I am compelled to write about the raking\
    \ of gravel rather than to do it.\nIt is not beyond me, of course, to go sashaying\
    \ around my bailiwick until I spot a pathway with gravel scattered upon it, and\
    \ to march up the pathway to the door, and to hammer my fist upon the door and,\
    \ when it is opened, to greet the person answering and to offer to rake their\
    \ gravel for them, with the proviso that they would have to supply the rake, a\
    \ rake which I would of course return to them immediately after I had finished\
    \ raking the gravel. I would have to put a stress on this last point to avert\
    \ the possibility that the person might eye me with suspicion as a potential rake-thief,\
    \ my offer to rake their gravel mere subterfuge. I like to think I do not cut\
    \ a thief-like figure, do not carry a fishy stink around with me, but some persons\
    \ are more trusting than others, and if, for example, the person at whose door\
    \ I come calling has suffered recent theft of garden implements, I could not blame\
    \ them for smelling a rat, even if there is no rat to be smelled.\nThat entire\
    \ paragraph, however, hinges on the idea that I might be desperate to rake gravel,\
    \ and I am not. Not really. I do not say that I would not spend a happy five or\
    \ ten minutes raking gravel if the opportunity presented itself. But it is not\
    \ an opportunity I actively seek. I am content, as I am sure you have twigged,\
    \ merely to write about it. I wonder, momentarily, whether one might find an equivalence\
    \ between writing and raking, the writer and the raker, words and gravel, but\
    \ only momentarily. After a moment, I slap my forehead with the palm of my hand,\
    \ with some force, and remind myself that I have all but exhausted the topic,\
    \ and need to move on to fresh pastures, pastures not strewn with gravel.\nBefore\
    \ doing so, however, it will be a good idea to mop up any loose ends. Then we\
    \ can be sure that the raking of gravel has been covered, absolutely, with the\
    \ guarantee that we need never return to it. Otherwise there will always be that\
    \ nagging thought, in the brains of both writer (me) and reader (you), that something\
    \ has been left unsaid, that we will need to return, at some future date not yet\
    \ allotted, to the subject, to wring from it further insights, and this thought\
    \ will necessarily distract us from whatever else it is we ought to be concentrating\
    \ upon. To paraphrase Lord Denning, \u201Cthis is such an appalling vista that\
    \ every sensible person in the land would say that it cannot be right that this\
    \ thought should be allowed to nag at us\u201D. Lord Denning was not talking about\
    \ the raking of gravel, nor of what we might have neglected to say about it, but\
    \ his remarks are apposite, which is why I paraphrased them. I could draw upon\
    \ other paraphrases, and even direct quotations, in my support, were I so minded.\
    \ But I am not. We do not want to string this business out longer than we have\
    \ to.\nHere, it is nevertheless worth asking \u201Chow long might that be?\u201D\
    \ What if I, or indeed somebody else entirely, were to start a blog entitled The\
    \ Raking Of Gravel, of which the only subject under discussion was the raking\
    \ of gravel? Can one imagine daily postages, for years and years, where the topic\
    \ is ever more thoroughly examined and, as beardy postmodernist fatheads would\
    \ put it, interrogated? You would have to be mightily interested in the raking\
    \ of gravel to read such a blog, and to keep reading it, until kingdom come. I\
    \ am sure there are at least one or two people out there who fit the bill. They\
    \ will be the ones becoming somewhat tearful and melancholic as we at Hooting\
    \ Yard now approach the final mopping up.\nThere may be something to be said about\
    \ the relationship between mopping and raking, between the duties of a janitor,\
    \ with a mop, in a corridor, and those of a handyman-gardener, with a rake, on\
    \ a gravel-strewn pathway. Certainly a janitor can be as eerie and enigmatic as\
    \ a handyman-gardener, and as given to gnomic utterances. They are cut from the\
    \ same cloth, generally speaking, though I think it would be a mistake to regard\
    \ them as interchangeable. Not a serious mistake, with world-shuddering consequences,\
    \ but a mistake nonetheless.\nNote to self\_: find out the difference, if any,\
    \ between a janitor and a janissary.\nChrist Almighty! I have had it up to here\
    \ with the raking of gravel by handymen-gardeners! It remains to acknowledge that\
    \ the original eerie and enigmatic handyman-gardener, Huw Halfbacon, mentioned\
    \ here explicitly the other day, is a character from Alan Garner's The Owl Service\
    \ (1967). It was adapted into a television series in 1969, where Huw Halfbacon\
    \ was played by Raymond Llewellyn. Here he is, on the right, in a still from the\
    \ series, many more of which can be seen here.\n"
