  text: 'I am enormously pleased to see that an enterprising publisher has issued
    a collection of Dobson''s so-called nature writings. At some point in the early
    nineteen-fifties the pamphleteer managed to persuade a harassed and overtired
    newspaper editor to let him loose on the paper''s Country Diary column. The regular
    correspondent had been incapacitated in a badger-gassing episode that went spectacularly
    wrong, and Dobson, weirdly alert to such things, immediately presented himself
    at the newspaper offices. It is the columns he wrote, in his temporary incumbency,
    which have now been gathered together and published in a handsome volume. Most
    of this material will be new, even to the most indefatigable Dobsonist.

    Albeit he was only a stand-in, it was a daring appointment, perhaps an act of
    desperation. For all his undoubted talent as a crafter of sweeping paragraphs
    of majestic prose, Dobson was profoundly ignorant of the natural world. He was
    perhaps the least-qualified person ever to write a nature column in a national
    newspaper. Had the editor not been harassed and overtired, he would surely have
    sent the pamphleteer packing with a flea in his ear. Instead, Dobson was given
    a desk and a notepad and a pen and some blotting paper and told to knock together
    a thousand words in time for the next print-run, in a couple of hours'' time.

    Have you ever gassed a badger? he began, and followed it with nine hundred and
    ninety-four words recounting the badger-gassing episode that went spectacularly
    wrong which led to the incapacitation of the regular Country Diary columnist and
    explained why he, Dobson, was sitting at his desk and using his pen and notepad
    and blotting paper. Not that I will need the blotting paper, he wrote, As so surely
    do I craft my sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose that nary a blot of ink e''er
    besmirches them. By the time it was typeset and printed, of course, none among
    his readers could know that, on the contrary, the pamphleteer''s manuscripts were
    hideous to behold, a mass of scratches and scribbles and nib-stabbings liberally
    splattered with blots, of ink and sweat and spit and blood.

    Did you gas a badger yesterday? he wrote the next day, and the day after his column
    began Well, have you gassed any badgers yet? At this point a subeditor stepped
    in and suggested, tentatively, that Dobson might want to broaden the subject matter
    of his column. There was more to nature, this chap suggested, than the gassing
    of badgers, a topic of which, after all, the pamphleteer appeared to know next
    to nothing. Dobson flew into a temper and accused the subeditor of being harassed
    and overtired, which was undoubtedly true. But after calming down and smoking
    a few acrid Serbian cigarettes and doodling a map of Pointy Town on a sheet of
    blotting paper, he relented, and apologised, and promised to extend his range,
    as he put it, for the next day''s Country Diary.

    The beauty of this new collection is that it includes some of the columns Dobson
    wrote which were spiked and never appeared in the paper. Among them are the next
    day''s piece, his fourth, and the first not to fixate upon the gassing of badgers.

    Over the last few days, he wrote, I have had much to say about the gassing of
    badgers. Several letters have landed on my desk from readers, suggesting that
    I have no idea what I am talking about. Be that as it may, it is time to move
    on to pastures new. There is more, much more, to the natural world than badger-gassing,
    or so I have been advised. For instance, have you ever gassed a swan?

    These and the following nine hundred and twenty-five words were spiked, or rather
    set fire to, and their space in the paper taken up instead by a mezzotint of a
    badger by the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint. Dobson was summoned to the editor''s
    office and told to avoid, if possible, any mention of gas in his future columns.
    He asked if the interdiction included marsh gas. Marsh gas, declared the editor,
    after some thought and pencil-chewing, was an acceptable topic, but only after
    a week or two. First Dobson would have to show that he was capable of writing
    a wholly gasless Country Diary column. Seething, Dobson agreed.

    The pamphleteer was now in something of a pickle. What on earth was he going to
    write about? Thanks to this invaluable collection, in hard covers, we know the
    answer to that question. Dobson somehow managed to string together sweeping paragraphs
    of majestic prose about voles, spinneys, farm implements, tractors, riverbanks,
    weasels, owls, canal towpaths, orchards, copses, bogs, ditches, rainfall, slurry,
    pigs, flocks of Stalins, hollyhocks, mud, lupins, nuthatches, wild rampaging boars,
    ungassed badgers, henbane, hen coops, Vanbrugh chickens, puddles, ponds, linnets,
    and a legion of other suitably rustic topics. All of them were addressed in his
    column the next day, Friday.

    Before he sloped off home that evening, Dobson was surprised to learn that in
    the paper''s Saturday edition, the Country Diary was given double the space. Two
    thousand words?, he asked, incredulous. Quite so, said the harassed and overtired
    subeditor. Dobson went away fuming. He decided not to head for home after all,
    but to seek inspiration by spending the night in the open, sprawled in the middle
    of a field, out in the countryside. Ignorant as he was of country ways, he did
    not know that the field in which he chose to sprawl was a haunt of badgers, and
    that at dead of night, farmers bent on badger destruction came stamping through
    the muck armed with gas canisters.

    When dawn broke, Dobson was sprawled, not in an open field, but in a bed in a
    clinic for gas victims. Incapacitated, and unable to file his copy, he was told
    the newspaper no longer required his services. The regular Country Diary correspondent
    had made a full recovery and was back at his desk, or rather, at a desk alongside
    it, his own desk, which Dobson had commandeered, having been taken away by the
    janitor to be scrubbed clean of the stains of ink and sweat and spit and blood
    with which the pamphleteer had besmirched it.

    Several months later, Dobson contacted the editor to suggest he write a daily
    column about gas. The editor dropped his letter into a waste chute.'
