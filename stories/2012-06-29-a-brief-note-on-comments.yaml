  text: Comments at Hooting Yard are moderated--that is, I have to approve them before
    they appear. WordPress cleverly sorts out the spam and deposits it in a separate
    inbox. I used to keep a check on this to ensure no legitimate comments had accidentally
    been dispatched there, but there are currently hundreds of spam comments arriving
    daily. My brain is already puny and curdled enough without reading through all
    that bollocks just in case a witty and learned comment from one of my readers
    has been dumped there by mistake. I mention this in case anybody is sitting there
    fuming and cursing because their comment has not appeared. This will not be because
    I have failed to approve it, rather that it has been erroneously designated as
    spam and I have never even seen it. If your comment does not appear, please either
    resubmit it or alert me to its absence by email.
