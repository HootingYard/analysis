    Over at The Dabbler this week, I am prompted to discuss such non-Hooting Yardy
    topics as dosh, booze, foopball, politics, and seventies rock. All at one fell
    swoop. You will be pleased to note that my piece is illustrated with a not entirely
    gratuitous photograph of monopod Jethro Tull flautist Ian Anderson.'
