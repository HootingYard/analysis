  text: 'In the midst of a storm, [Antonio Pigafetta] writes,

    "The body of St Anselm appeared to us . . . in the form of a fire lighted at the
    summit of the mainmast, and remained there near two hours and a half, which comforted
    us greatly, for we were in tears only expecting the hour of our perishing. And
    when that holy light was going away from us, it gave out such brilliance in our
    eyes that for nearly a quarter of an hour we were like people blinded and calling
    for mercy . . . It is to be noted that whenever that light which represents St
    Anselm shows itself and descends on a vessel in a storm at sea, that vessel is
    never lost. Immediately this light departed, the sea grew calmer, and then we
    saw various kinds of birds among which were some that had no fundament."

    This is not a hallucination--he is describing the electrical phenomenon known
    as St Elmo''s Fire--but the language tends towards the visionary, and ends with
    this decidedly odd seabird that lacks an anus.

    Charles Nicholl, in "Conversing With Giants", collected in Traces Remain : Essays
    And Explorations (2011), quoting Antonio Pigafetta, who met giants in Patagonia.
    Pigafetta was a supernumerary passenger on Magellan''s voyage of circumnavigation
    (1519-1522), one of the few who made it back to Seville.'
