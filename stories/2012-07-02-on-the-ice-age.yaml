  text: "Brrrr! Wrap up warm, because it's cold outside! Well, it would be, wouldn't\
    \ it, this being the Ice Age. There have been other Ages\u2014Stone and Iron,\
    \ for example, and Bronze\u2014but this one we have dubbed the Ice Age, because\
    \ it is so chilly. Sitting here next to my oil stove, wearing various furry animal\
    \ pelts, it is easy to forget just how cold it is outside. I can't see through\
    \ the windows, because they are all frosted up, but I suppose if I turned down\
    \ the volume on the cassette player I would be able to hear the howling winds\
    \ of the blizzard, and they would serve to remind me of the cold. But I would\
    \ rather listen to the cassette playing poptones, quite frankly. I am not in the\
    \ right mood for howling.\nThe wind howls, and so do wolves. Sometimes it is difficult\
    \ to distinguish one kind of howling from another. Wolves seem to thrive in the\
    \ chilly chilly weather of this Ice Age. They have furry coats of course, or at\
    \ least hairy, bristly coats, au naturelle, as it were. To obtain my furry pelt\
    \ I have to slaughter apt creatures, or at least pay someone to do so for me,\
    \ to slaughter and skin and stitch. I am somewhat weedy, and short-sighted, and\
    \ I would much rather huddle by the oil stove listening to poptones than be out\
    \ there in the cold, hunting and stalking. In any case, I do not have a pair of\
    \ snow shoes, so I wouldn't get very far. Within a few feet of my door I expect\
    \ I would be up to my waist in snow, and helpless, and I would have to make puny\
    \ cries, in the hope that a tough wolf-hunter would come to my rescue.\nAt least\
    \ you know where you are with wolves. Those rampaging wild boars are another matter\
    \ entirely. Blimey. I have been woken from a nap by the sound of them battering\
    \ their tusks against the walls of my hut. I am pretty sure it was a wild boar,\
    \ covered in hoar frost, that chewed through the wiring of my radio set. I thought\
    \ the wiring was safe, submerged under snow, stretching out across the tarputa,\
    \ but those boars are relentless. Now I can only get some of the channels, and\
    \ none of the music ones, which is why I rely on the cassette player.\nIce Age\
    \ music is pretty grim, all told, but when the alternative is the howling of wind\
    \ and wolves and the bashing of boar-tusks against the walls, you have to take\
    \ what you can get. And it's not all bad. I grew quite fond of Chepstow's Icicle\
    \ Symphony, for example. But the tape was ruined when I left it too close to the\
    \ oil stove, and it partly melted. So now I make do with poptones, icy poptones,\
    \ with lots of synthesizer. At top volume, it drowns out the howling.\nI used\
    \ to have a pair of snow shoes. Of course I did, for how else would I have been\
    \ able to cross the tarputa and make it to my hut? It took me six weeks to get\
    \ here, plodding slowly. I meant to hang on to them, for emergencies, but the\
    \ fibre they were made from was highly flammable, and one evening the oil stove\
    \ spat out a stray spark which ignited them. I acted quickly, putting on a pair\
    \ of mittens and chucking the burning snow shoes out of the door, into a snowdrift.\
    \ If I hadn't, the whole hut would have burned down and I'd have been a goner.\
    \ But it means that now I have to rely on passing wolf-hunters for certain essentials.\
    \ They can be a difficult lot.\nI got so fed up with the rampaging wild boars\
    \ battering their tusks against the walls that I thought I'd fashion some kind\
    \ of boar-trap. I asked one of the wolf-hunters for help. In return for soup,\
    \ I hoped he would dig a pit outside, a few feet away from the door, into which\
    \ the boars might topple, and having toppled, perish. The rascal ate my soup but\
    \ said he was a wolf-only hunter, and couldn't be distracted in his career by\
    \ digging a pit for boars. He was huge and violent, so I didn't argue.\nI may\
    \ no longer have the Icicle Symphony to listen to, but I have plenty of icicles.\
    \ They hang from the ceiling, in their hundreds, and occasionally I pluck one\
    \ off, to suck, or to use as a little spear. Sometimes I will use the same icicle\
    \ for both spearing and sucking, turn and turn about, until my sucking has made\
    \ it useless for spearing. The icicles are a bit too big to use as pins, and funnily\
    \ enough I have discovered I have absolutely no need of pins, here in my hut.\
    \ I have got along quite well without a single pin. That surprised me, but there\
    \ it is.\nApart from the fiendish cold, the reason I don't go out much is fear.\
    \ Call me namby-pamby, but I am terrified of the twin perils of snow-blindness\
    \ and piblokto. The wolves and the rampaging wild boars I think I could handle,\
    \ using a combination of mesmerism and gibberish, but neither of those is of much\
    \ use where the ruination of one's eyes and one's mind is at stake. I have noticed\
    \ that the wolf-hunters all seem to be equipped with very natty sunglasses, which\
    \ presumably protect them against snow-blindness. Whether they have something\
    \ similar to guard their brains I do not know. They are not a talkative lot. Oh,\
    \ they will gobble down the soup you proffer them, but that's as far as it goes.\n\
    On one of the radio stations I am still able to pick up, I heard the other day\
    \ that the Ice Age might be coming to an end. Some pundit in the studio was wittering\
    \ on about all the snow melting, across the tarputa, for as far as the eye could\
    \ see, revealing a buried landscape, a vista of salt flats. It sounded to me as\
    \ if his vision was little different from the snowbound land of the Ice Age. But\
    \ I suppose if it does get warmer I might go out from time to time, though I am\
    \ not sure to what purpose. I don't put salt in my soup, never have."
