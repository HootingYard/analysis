  text: "The Bisky Bat was first identified by Edward Lear in his poem The Quangle\
    \ Wangle's Hat (1877). It would be more accurate to say that it was only identified\
    \ by Lear, as nobody before or since seems to have had a word to say of its existence.\
    \ Believe me, I have done the research.\nThe initial problem I had to solve was\
    \ whether \u201CBisky\u201D was part of the formal nomenclature of this type of\
    \ bat, or whether Lear was referring to a generic bat, and applying a descriptive\
    \ adjective. The capitalisation of \u201CBisky\u201D would suggest the former,\
    \ though \u201CBat\u201D is also capitalised in the text, so who knows? If \u201C\
    Bisky\u201D is a general adjective, it is one that has been neglected by the OED\
    \ and by all the other standard dictionaries. There is a slim possibility that\
    \ it may have something to do with biscuits, but it is hard to understand what\
    \ might be biscuit-like about a bat. You might bake a biscuit in the shape of\
    \ a bat, but that would be a Batty Biscuit, not a Bisky Bat. I concluded, after\
    \ much furrowing of the brow and smoking quite a few gaspers, that \u201CBisky\u201D\
    \ was indeed the formal name of a type of bat.\nMy knowledge of the world o\u2019\
    \ bats is breathtaking. One of my party pieces, which never fails to enliven even\
    \ the most straitlaced and sober of social gatherings, is to reel off in a dramatic\
    \ tone of voice a list of bats. I rarely need prompting, and I do not need prompting\
    \ now. Some bats then: the Asian False Vampire Bat, the Asian Painted Bat, the\
    \ Big Brown Bat, the Big Free-tailed Bat, the Brandt Bat, the Brazilian Free-tailed\
    \ Bat, the Brown Long-eared Bat, the California Leaf-nosed Bat,\_the Common Yellow-shouldered\
    \ Bat, the Daubenton Bat, the Desert Red Bat, the Eastern Long-eared Bat, the\
    \ Eastern Pipistrelle, the Egyptian Fruit Bat, the Evening Bat, the Florida Mastiff\
    \ Bat, the Fringe-lipped Bat, Geoffroy's Rayed Bat, the Giant Indian Fruit Bat,\
    \ the Golden Horseshoe Bat, the Gray Bat, the Greater Bulldog Bat, the Greater\
    \ Horseshoe Bat, the Greater Long-nosed Bat, the Greater Spear-nosed Bat, the\
    \ Hoary Bat, the Honduran White Bat, the Indiana Bat, the Ipanema Bat,\_Keen's\
    \ Bat or the Northern Bat, the Lappet-browed Bat, Leisler's Bat, the Lesser Horseshoe\
    \ Bat, the Lesser Long-nosed Bat, Linnaeus\u2019 False Vampire Bat, the Little\
    \ Brown Bat, the Long-nosed Bat, the\_Mexican Big-eared Bat, the Mexican Fruit\
    \ Bat, the Nathusius Pipistrelle, Natterer's Bat, the Noctule Bat, the Northern\
    \ Yellow Bat, the Pallid Bat, the Parti-coloured Bat, Peters\u2019 Ghost-faced\
    \ Bat, Peters\u2019 Tent-making Bat, Peters\u2019 Wooly False Vampire Bat, the\
    \ Pipistrelle Bat, the Pocketed Free-tailed Bat, the Pygmy Pipistrelle, Rafinesque's\
    \ Big-eared Bat, the Red Bat, Rodrigues\u2019 Fruit Bat, the\_Seminole Bat, the\
    \ Serotine Bat, the Short-tailed Fruit Bat, the Silver-haired Bat, the Southeastern\
    \ Bat, the Southern Yellow Bat, the Spotted Bat, the Straw-coloured Fruit Bat,\
    \ the Surat Serotine Bat,\_Townsend's Big-eared Bat, Underwood's Long-tongued\
    \ Bat, Underwood's Mastiff Bat, the Vampire Bat, the Western Mastiff Bat, the\
    \ Whiskered Bat, the Wrinkle-faced Bat, and the Yellow Bat. This is by no means\
    \ an exhaustive list. I have not mentioned, for example, the Demonic Tube-nosed\
    \ Fruit Bat, Veldkamp's Dwarf Epauletted Fruit Bat, St. Aignan's Trumpet-Eared\
    \ Bat, the Strange Big-eared Brown Bat, Schlieffen's Twilight Bat, the Tiny Yellow\
    \ Bat, the Robust Yellow Bat, the Equatorial Dog-faced Bat, the Coastal Tomb Bat,\
    \ the Buffy Flower Bat, the Hairy Little Fruit Bat, nor the various Smoky Bats.\
    \ I could prattle on for hours, and perhaps include a diversion where I pointed\
    \ out the amusing fact that an entire genus of fruit bats is known as the Dobsonia.\
    \ But no matter how long my party piece lasts, the one bat you will not hear mentioned\
    \ is the Bisky Bat.\nNow this is very odd. Edward Lear was a formidable naturalist,\
    \ and he would hardly have invented a bat. I can only assume that he spotted one,\
    \ in 1877 or shortly beforehand, named it, wrote of it, and then went on his merry\
    \ way, no doubt assuming other bat-mad persons would subject the bat to further\
    \ study. And yet they did not.\nHaving reached a dead end in my researches, it\
    \ occurred to me that I could make profitable use of my time by attempting to\
    \ draw a Bisky Bat. Now it has to be said that I am a pretty cack-handed draughtsman,\
    \ and not one of the hundreds of bat drawings I have made in the past bears much\
    \ resemblance to a bat. I always have trouble with the wings and those little\
    \ eyes and the complex radar-like navigation system bats rely on to get from A\
    \ to B. But on this occasion it would not be \u201Cme\u201D doing the drawing,\
    \ for I resolved to enter into a trance and, with my arm suspended, from the elbow,\
    \ in a sling, and a pencil glued to my fingers, I would commune with a spirit\
    \ guide. This guide would control the movements of the pencil across the paper.\
    \ Before sinking into the trance, by means of mystic Blavatskyan breathing exercises,\
    \ gibberish, and a Brian Eno record, I went for a stroll and a smoke and I wondered\
    \ if the spirit that communed with me would be Edward Lear himself, or perhaps\
    \ another Victorian naturalist, one who had also spotted the Bisky Bat but had\
    \ failed to recognise it properly, and was now taking the opportunity to make\
    \ amends for his oversight. I would never know, of course, for when I emerge from\
    \ these trances, my brain is as if wiped clean with a particularly effective disinfectant\
    \ preparation.\nThe other thing that happens when I emerge from these trances\
    \ is that I am confronted with a sheet of paper on which I, or the medium, has\
    \ scribbled and scraped a formless mess of squiggly quangle wangle. I always forget\
    \ that, too.\nI have not quite abandoned my Bisky Bat research, however. I am\
    \ now working on the theory that the editors of the OED, and of all other standard\
    \ dictionaries, have somehow overlooked the word, and that it does indeed exist\
    \ as a common adjective. All I need do now is to work out what it means."
