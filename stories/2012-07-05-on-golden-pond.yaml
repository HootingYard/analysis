  text: 'Look! There''s Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn in a rowing boat! They are
    both dead and in their graves, of course, but here on Golden Pond they, or rather
    their shades, drift forever. There is a similar pond in Paris, where you will
    be able to spot Camille and Sophie and Olivier, from Celine et Julie vont en bateau,
    similarly drifting, in their rowing boat, forever and ever. Some ponds attract
    ghosts, in their boats. There is nothing intrinsically eerie about such ponds.
    If you were to go for a walk around one, on a summer''s day, chucking, from a
    scrunched up paper bag, shreds of stale bread to ducks, and you did not spot Henry
    Fonda or Katharine Hepburn or Camille or Sophie or Olivier, or should I say their
    shades, I keep forgetting, then you would not think the pond a haunted pond. Having
    fed the ducks, you would deposit the empty paper bag in a waste bin, and go home,
    all unaware. It might well be that just as you turn your back on the pond, to
    head for home, that is precisely the moment when the rowing boat will appear,
    from behind overhanging foliage perhaps, and in the boat, glassy-eyed and spectral,
    the shades.

    Some ask why it is that the shades stay put in ponds. Freed from mortal moorings,
    why do they not take their rowing boats to a river, and row out to sea? Yes, a
    pond is still and serene whereas the sea can be a wild seething storm-tossed uproarious
    churning maelstrom, but that ought hold no terrors for the shades. Surely Henry
    Fonda and Katharine Hepburn and Camille and Sophie and Olivier are beyond all
    such care? They have faced the greatest of all terrors, and passed beyond, into
    the realm of ghosts. And as ghosts, in their rowing boats, they could row and
    row through even the most violent of seas until they came alongside a ghost ship.
    For we know there are many ghost ships out upon the ocean. They could still row
    in their boat, if they wanted to, but they would also have the larger canvas of
    a sailing ship on which to paint their gaudy pictures of the hereafter.

    The reason the shades stay upon their familiar ponds is for safety. For were they
    to take their boats to a river and drift upstream towards the sea, then, close
    by the sea, they would meet with coastal tomb bats. Terror can still strike the
    shades, and it does so in the form of these bats. Now you understand why Henry
    Fonda and Katharine Hepburn and Camille and Sophie and Olivier, no, their shades,
    their shades!, stay far inland, upon ponds, on Golden Pond and a Parisian pond,
    remote from any sea. As their name implies, the coastal tomb bats can never stray
    far from the coast. They haunt the meetings of land and sea, and when they sense,
    with their exceptionally good eyesight, the approach, on the river, of drifting
    rowing boats freighted with shades, ah . . . then terror is wreaked. A flock of
    coastal tomb bats will descend upon the boat, horrifying bats with grizzled dorsal
    colouration and conical faces, and they will hoist the shades out of the boat,
    and drag them, dozens of bats carrying each shade, to a tomb, a tomb by the coast,
    on a promontory overlooking the sea, as at Whitby. And the shade will be dropped
    in a tomb and the tomb fall shut, forever, and then there will never again be
    any drifting upon placid Golden Pond, for Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, nor
    upon a Parisian pond for Camille and Sophie and Olivier. And if you go to feed
    the ducks from a scrunched up paper bag of shreds of stale bread, you will see
    no shades, but perhaps, if it drifts from behind overhanging foliage, an empty
    rowing boat.


    In the hereafter, as in the here, nothing is ever as straightforward as it might
    be. It is not the case that a rowing boat shade, tired of its pond and hankering
    for the vastness of the open sea, is fated always to fall into the clutches of
    coastal tomb bats. The bats can be outwitted, and the shade, desperate perhaps
    to embark upon a ghost ship, can avoid a terrible entombment in a coastal grave.
    For there are other bats, Peters'' tent-making bats, which will fly to the shade''s
    assistance. Whether the tent-making bats do this knowingly or inadvertently is
    a moot point, but they do what they do, and the shade can find a measure of safety,
    even at the coast. For it is a curious thing that, even with their piercing eyesight,
    the coastal tomb bats cannot pierce the fabric of the tents made by the tent-making
    bats. The brave and fortunate shade, drifting downriver towards the sea, fearful
    of the predations of coastal tomb bats, will keep a sharp if glassy eye out for
    signs of an encampment of Peters'' tent-making bats'' tents. If the shade spots
    one, it can drift to shore and tie its rowing boat to a ghostpost, and shimmer
    quickly to a tent, and so hide. From within the tent the lapping of sea against
    shore can be heard, and the shade is comforted. For some shades, this is enough,
    and they settle in the tent by the shore. Somehow one imagines this might suit
    Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, their shades, but not Camille and Sophie and
    Olivier. The domestic melodrama played out by the trio would be all the more harrowing
    within the confines of a bat tent. They are no doubt happier drifting on their
    Parisian pond.

    Bur if a tent by the sea is not enough, and the desire to board a ghost ship overwhelming,
    how is the shade to make it safely from tent to sea? The coastal tomb bats are
    ever watchful. Alas, there is not a third type of bat which serves as an escort
    to ferry the shade in safety. Nature has not provided one. The shade must risk
    all in a desperate flight, at a time when the coastal tomb bats may be sleeping,
    a flight back to the tied-up rowing boat, and thence, rowing heave-ho, not drifting,
    must make as rapidly as possible for open sea, in hope of a welcoming ship. It
    is easy to see why some shades stay on their ponds.

    Look! Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn are drifting, in their rowing boat, behind
    overhanging foliage on Golden Pond. Did you see them?'
