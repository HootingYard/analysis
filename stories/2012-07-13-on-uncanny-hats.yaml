  text: "Many years ago, Peter Blegvad posed some questions about hats. To the best\
    \ of my knowledge, nearly four decades on he has not answered a single one of\
    \ them. I do not doubt that he has many other calls on his attention, but quite\
    \ frankly my patience is at an end. I have therefore resolved to seek answers\
    \ to the questions off my own bat. Whether my answers be right or wrong, I will\
    \ at least have addressed them, and thus put to bed certain niggling vexations\
    \ which have been bothering me ever since I first heard those questions, sung\
    \ by Dagmar Krause, in 1975. Those of you who have no idea what I am talking about\
    \ should listen to the questions before proceeding:\n Some Questions About Hats\
    \ \nThe first question is \"Can one wear uncanny hats?\" For a long time I sat\
    \ at my escritoire pondering this, smoking the odd gasper and glugging a cup of\
    \ tea. I had a pencil and a blank sheet of paper, just in case. Eventually it\
    \ dawned on me--as I am sure it has already dawned on you, dear reader--that I\
    \ was unlikely to come up with an answer to the question while sitting indoors.\
    \ No, I would have to go out and about, prancing the boulevards, on the lookout\
    \ for hat-wearing persons. What a bother! I went to take a nap instead.\nWhen\
    \ I woke up, I returned to my escritoire, my cigarettes, and a fresh cup of piping\
    \ hot tea, and considered if I might address one of the other questions, one which\
    \ would allow me to stay put. I dismissed the idea, because I tend to take a very\
    \ methodical approach to hat question matters, and it seemed important to answer\
    \ them in the precise order in which they had been posed. Dobson has a pamphlet\
    \ about this kind of thing, the title of which escapes me, but I have read it\
    \ several times, and taken its lessons to heart. There was nothing for it, then,\
    \ but to put on my stylish Italian Hoity Toity Boots, and sally forth into the\
    \ streets. Before doing so, I thought it prudent to look up the dictionary definition\
    \ of \"uncanny\". I told you I was methodical. The OED gives a number of definitions,\
    \ some Obs., but the one I felt sure Peter Blegvad had in mind all those years\
    \ ago was 4.b., that is \"Partaking of a supernatural character; mysterious, weird,\
    \ uncomfortably strange or unfamiliar\". I did not look up the definition of \"\
    hat\", because I am not an idiot. I know a hat when I see one, thank you very\
    \ much.\nAs I strode out, under an overcast sky threatening rain, I chewed over\
    \ that definition in my mind. For a hat to be truly uncanny, I reasoned, it would\
    \ have to meet all the terms given in the OED. It would not be sufficient for\
    \ a hat to be merely \"uncomfortably strange\", for example. As I knew all too\
    \ well, there were parts of town where strange and uncomfortable hats were ten\
    \ a penny. Those parts of town I tended to avoid, in the main. A further requirement\
    \ was that the hat had to be atop somebody's head, being worn, in order to provide\
    \ an answer to the question. Otherwise I could save a lot of time and energy by\
    \ prancing straight to the nearest milliner's and casting my eye over the window\
    \ display. I had my work cut out. I headed for an important boulevard, one with\
    \ plenty of benches upon which pedestrians could rest their weary limbs, chose\
    \ one to sit upon, and sat, and watched the passing throng.\nThe first thing that\
    \ struck me was the extraordinary number of people who wore no hat at all. This\
    \ in itself seemed uncanny. I myself was sporting a little Tyrolean number, with\
    \ a feather in it. It is old and battered and has certain unseemly stains under\
    \ the brim, but it is a good hat, in my opinion. But it is neither mysterious\
    \ nor weird nor uncomfortably strange, and it is most certainly not unfamiliar,\
    \ to me at least. It may possibly partake of a supernatural character, given that\
    \ I acquired it from an unnervingly elvish Tyrolean hatter, with a little pointy\
    \ beard, dressed all in green, like a character from a frightening fairy story.\
    \ He was uncanny, sure enough, but his hats were not.\nI sat on the bench on the\
    \ boulevard for half an hour before spotting my first hat. It was worn by a cadaverous\
    \ lolloping fellow who seemed to have stepped out of an earlier century. He was\
    \ hefting a carrier bag crammed with angular somethings, who knows what?, and\
    \ his boots, or possibly his bones, creaked as he lolloped. His hat, however,\
    \ was disappointingly unremarkable, a Trilby I think, in better condition than\
    \ my own hat. I felt a sudden urge to attack him, to knock the hat flying off\
    \ his head, into the gutter, there to stamp on it, in a rage, but I stopped myself.\
    \ I shut my eyes and counted to two hundred and fifty, which I find is the number\
    \ required to quell my seething. When I opened my eyes the fellow was out of sight\
    \ and it had begun to rain.\nNow I am not a man for umbrellas. I do not own one\
    \ and never have. I have my Tyrolean hat to protect the top of my head, and I\
    \ am insouciant in drizzle. This, however, was a cloudburst, a downpour, and if\
    \ I stayed where I was my clothing would be sopping wet, however dry the top of\
    \ my head might remain. I rushed to find shelter in the doorway of a butcher's.\
    \ From my new vantage point I hoped to spot more hat-wearers, persons perhaps\
    \ who eschewed their hats in rainless weather, but now plopped them atop their\
    \ heads. Where they might be carrying their hats in the meantime was not a matter\
    \ I wished to think about. As it was, the rain brought no noticeable increase\
    \ in the hat-wearing population out and about on the boulevard. Instead there\
    \ appeared a flurry of those cursed umbrellas.\nI was beginning to feel cold and\
    \ miserable and brain-jangled, and I could smell sausages. I turned and went into\
    \ the butcher's and bought a half dozen bangers. Did you know there are as many\
    \ as four hundred and seventy different varieties of sausage available in this\
    \ country? I can't remember what kind I bought from this boulevard butcher, whose\
    \ hat, by the way, was a fairly typical butcher's hat, and thus not in the least\
    \ bit uncanny.\nPeckish, I returned home in the downpour. On the way I passed\
    \ several people wearing hats, more than I could have expected, and though one\
    \ or two were weird--the hats, that is, not the persons wearing them, at least\
    \ as far as I was aware, not knowing them from Adam--and some hats looked uncomfortably\
    \ strange, and they were all, to me, unfamiliar, none were mysterious, and none\
    \ looked, in the time I had to study them, as if they partook of a supernatural\
    \ character. In short, I did not see a single uncanny hat, and I must have been\
    \ out of doors for at least an hour all told.\nLater, slurping tea and munching\
    \ my sausages, I reflected that I would have to go out again the next day, to\
    \ keep my eyes peeled for persons wearing hats, perhaps in a different location.\
    \ And I began to understand why, almost forty years since he had posed some questions\
    \ about hats, Peter Blegvad had failed to answer them. I was trying to answer\
    \ just one, and it was proving no easy matter. How many more days was I going\
    \ to have to spend sprawled on benches or huddled in the doorways of butcher's\
    \ shops, prey to the temptation of sausages? Answering all the questions would\
    \ be a Sisyphean task. It was clearly time for me to take another nap. And so,\
    \ sausages digested, to bed."
