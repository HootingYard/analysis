  text: 'Many years ago, Peter Blegvad posed some questions about hats. To the best
    of my knowledge, nearly four decades on he has not answered a single one of them.
    I do not doubt that he has many other calls on his attention, but quite frankly
    my patience is at an end. I have therefore resolved to seek answers to the questions
    off my own bat. Whether my answers be right or wrong, I will at least have addressed
    them, and thus put to bed certain niggling vexations which have been bothering
    me ever since I first heard those questions, sung by Dagmar Krause, in 1975. Those
    of you who have no idea what I am talking about should listen to the questions
    before proceeding:

    Some Questions About Hats

    The first question is "Can one wear uncanny hats?" For a long time I sat at my
    escritoire pondering this, smoking the odd gasper and glugging a cup of tea. I
    had a pencil and a blank sheet of paper, just in case. Eventually it dawned on
    me--as I am sure it has already dawned on you, dear reader--that I was unlikely
    to come up with an answer to the question while sitting indoors. No, I would have
    to go out and about, prancing the boulevards, on the lookout for hat-wearing persons.
    What a bother! I went to take a nap instead.

    When I woke up, I returned to my escritoire, my cigarettes, and a fresh cup of
    piping hot tea, and considered if I might address one of the other questions,
    one which would allow me to stay put. I dismissed the idea, because I tend to
    take a very methodical approach to hat question matters, and it seemed important
    to answer them in the precise order in which they had been posed. Dobson has a
    pamphlet about this kind of thing, the title of which escapes me, but I have read
    it several times, and taken its lessons to heart. There was nothing for it, then,
    but to put on my stylish Italian Hoity Toity Boots, and sally forth into the streets.
    Before doing so, I thought it prudent to look up the dictionary definition of
    "uncanny". I told you I was methodical. The OED gives a number of definitions,
    some Obs., but the one I felt sure Peter Blegvad had in mind all those years ago
    was 4.b., that is "Partaking of a supernatural character; mysterious, weird, uncomfortably
    strange or unfamiliar". I did not look up the definition of "hat", because I am
    not an idiot. I know a hat when I see one, thank you very much.

    As I strode out, under an overcast sky threatening rain, I chewed over that definition
    in my mind. For a hat to be truly uncanny, I reasoned, it would have to meet all
    the terms given in the OED. It would not be sufficient for a hat to be merely
    "uncomfortably strange", for example. As I knew all too well, there were parts
    of town where strange and uncomfortable hats were ten a penny. Those parts of
    town I tended to avoid, in the main. A further requirement was that the hat had
    to be atop somebody''s head, being worn, in order to provide an answer to the
    question. Otherwise I could save a lot of time and energy by prancing straight
    to the nearest milliner''s and casting my eye over the window display. I had my
    work cut out. I headed for an important boulevard, one with plenty of benches
    upon which pedestrians could rest their weary limbs, chose one to sit upon, and
    sat, and watched the passing throng.

    The first thing that struck me was the extraordinary number of people who wore
    no hat at all. This in itself seemed uncanny. I myself was sporting a little Tyrolean
    number, with a feather in it. It is old and battered and has certain unseemly
    stains under the brim, but it is a good hat, in my opinion. But it is neither
    mysterious nor weird nor uncomfortably strange, and it is most certainly not unfamiliar,
    to me at least. It may possibly partake of a supernatural character, given that
    I acquired it from an unnervingly elvish Tyrolean hatter, with a little pointy
    beard, dressed all in green, like a character from a frightening fairy story.
    He was uncanny, sure enough, but his hats were not.

    I sat on the bench on the boulevard for half an hour before spotting my first
    hat. It was worn by a cadaverous lolloping fellow who seemed to have stepped out
    of an earlier century. He was hefting a carrier bag crammed with angular somethings,
    who knows what?, and his boots, or possibly his bones, creaked as he lolloped.
    His hat, however, was disappointingly unremarkable, a Trilby I think, in better
    condition than my own hat. I felt a sudden urge to attack him, to knock the hat
    flying off his head, into the gutter, there to stamp on it, in a rage, but I stopped
    myself. I shut my eyes and counted to two hundred and fifty, which I find is the
    number required to quell my seething. When I opened my eyes the fellow was out
    of sight and it had begun to rain.

    Now I am not a man for umbrellas. I do not own one and never have. I have my Tyrolean
    hat to protect the top of my head, and I am insouciant in drizzle. This, however,
    was a cloudburst, a downpour, and if I stayed where I was my clothing would be
    sopping wet, however dry the top of my head might remain. I rushed to find shelter
    in the doorway of a butcher''s. From my new vantage point I hoped to spot more
    hat-wearers, persons perhaps who eschewed their hats in rainless weather, but
    now plopped them atop their heads. Where they might be carrying their hats in
    the meantime was not a matter I wished to think about. As it was, the rain brought
    no noticeable increase in the hat-wearing population out and about on the boulevard.
    Instead there appeared a flurry of those cursed umbrellas.

    I was beginning to feel cold and miserable and brain-jangled, and I could smell
    sausages. I turned and went into the butcher''s and bought a half dozen bangers.
    Did you know there are as many as four hundred and seventy different varieties
    of sausage available in this country? I can''t remember what kind I bought from
    this boulevard butcher, whose hat, by the way, was a fairly typical butcher''s
    hat, and thus not in the least bit uncanny.

    Peckish, I returned home in the downpour. On the way I passed several people wearing
    hats, more than I could have expected, and though one or two were weird--the hats,
    that is, not the persons wearing them, at least as far as I was aware, not knowing
    them from Adam--and some hats looked uncomfortably strange, and they were all,
    to me, unfamiliar, none were mysterious, and none looked, in the time I had to
    study them, as if they partook of a supernatural character. In short, I did not
    see a single uncanny hat, and I must have been out of doors for at least an hour
    all told.

    Later, slurping tea and munching my sausages, I reflected that I would have to
    go out again the next day, to keep my eyes peeled for persons wearing hats, perhaps
    in a different location. And I began to understand why, almost forty years since
    he had posed some questions about hats, Peter Blegvad had failed to answer them.
    I was trying to answer just one, and it was proving no easy matter. How many more
    days was I going to have to spend sprawled on benches or huddled in the doorways
    of butcher''s shops, prey to the temptation of sausages? Answering all the questions
    would be a Sisyphean task. It was clearly time for me to take another nap. And
    so, sausages digested, to bed.'
