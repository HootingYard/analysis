  text: "Further to that earwig business, I found this reference to Speke and earwigs\
    \ at snopes.com:\nJohn Hanning Speke, remembered for tracking down the source\
    \ of the Nile River, recorded that the interior of his tent \u201Cbecame covered\
    \ with a host of small black beetles, evidently attracted by the glimmer of the\
    \ candle.\u201D Exhausted, Speke went to sleep with them crawling over his person,\
    \ only to be awakened by one of the \u201Chorrid little insects\u201D struggling\
    \ into his ear. Trying to remove the beetle only pushed it in further. The beetle\
    \ continued into Speke's ear as far as possible, and then \u201Che began with\
    \ exceeding vigour like a rabbit in a hole, to dig violently away at my tympanum.\
    \ The queer sensation this amusing measure excited in me is past description .\
    \ . . What to do I knew not.\u201D After trying to flush the critter out with\
    \ melted butter, Speke tried to dig it out with his penknife, succeeding only\
    \ in killing it and increasing the damage to his ear. Infection followed, distorting\
    \ his face and causing boils. \u201CFor many months the tumour made me almost\
    \ deaf, and ate a hole between the ear and the nose, so that when I blew it, my\
    \ ear whistled so audibly that those who heard it laughed. Six or seven months\
    \ after this accident happened, bits of the beetle\u2014a leg, a wing, or parts\
    \ of the body\u2014came away in the wax.\u201D\n(Quotes are from Speke's journals,\
    \ as referred to in Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton by Edward Rice, 1990, Scribner's,\
    \ New York.)"
