  text: 'Further to that earwig business, I found this reference to Speke and earwigs
    at snopes.com:

    John Hanning Speke, remembered for tracking down the source of the Nile River,
    recorded that the interior of his tent "became covered with a host of small black
    beetles, evidently attracted by the glimmer of the candle." Exhausted, Speke went
    to sleep with them crawling over his person, only to be awakened by one of the
    "horrid little insects" struggling into his ear. Trying to remove the beetle only
    pushed it in further. The beetle continued into Speke''s ear as far as possible,
    and then "he began with exceeding vigour like a rabbit in a hole, to dig violently
    away at my tympanum. The queer sensation this amusing measure excited in me is
    past description . . . What to do I knew not." After trying to flush the critter
    out with melted butter, Speke tried to dig it out with his penknife, succeeding
    only in killing it and increasing the damage to his ear. Infection followed, distorting
    his face and causing boils. "For many months the tumour made me almost deaf, and
    ate a hole between the ear and the nose, so that when I blew it, my ear whistled
    so audibly that those who heard it laughed. Six or seven months after this accident
    happened, bits of the beetle--a leg, a wing, or parts of the body--came away in
    the wax."

    (Quotes are from Speke''s journals, as referred to in Captain Sir Richard Francis
    Burton by Edward Rice, 1990, Scribner''s, New York.)'
