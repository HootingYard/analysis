  text: "There are circumstances in which you may find yourself standing in a field\
    \ alongside a Scandinavian peasant, staring at the sky. The peasant may turn to\
    \ you and say:\nMorgenrode gir dage blode,\n  Kveldsrode gir dage sode.\nWhat\
    \ is an appropriate response? You could, of course, remain silent, while moulding\
    \ your countenance into an expression of sagacity. A slight furrowing of the brow,\
    \ a pursing of the lips, an intense look in the eyes, perhaps an almost imperceptible\
    \ nod of the head. You could even rub your chin thoughtfully, as Mr Carter does\
    \ in the Jennings & Darbyshire books by Anthony Buckeridge. The Scandinavian peasant\
    \ will almost certainly take this as due acknowledgement. This is the safest course\
    \ of action if you have no idea what he is babbling on about.\nBut it may be that\
    \ you have a smattering of some Scandinavian languages, or are wearing a hidden\
    \ earpiece which provides you with a simultaneous translation. Both are possibilities\
    \ if you are, for example, a diplomat, or a special rapporteur of the United Nations.\
    \ There may be other reasons why one or both is the case, such as family background\
    \ or the habit of international jet-setting for either business or leisure purposes.\
    \ Your knowledge, or earpiece, will thus apprise you of the meaning of the peasant's\
    \ utterance, which can be given as:\nMorning red gives wet days,\n  Evening red\
    \ gives sweet days.\nArmed, then, with the knowledge that the peasant is spouting\
    \ rustic wisdom, or weather lore, you may wish to consider a verbal response.\
    \ You can still do the whole business with the brow and the lips and the eyes\
    \ and the head and the chin, but this time as a preliminary gambit. Then you might\
    \ counter with a countryside adage of your own, for example:\nRed sky at night,\
    \ shepherd's delight,\n  Red sky in morning, fisherman's warning.\nor, if the\
    \ field in which you are standing alongside the Scandinavian peasant is within\
    \ the vicinity of the sea, or of a fjord, you might say:\nRed sky at night, sailor's\
    \ delight,\n  Red sky at morning, sailors take warning.\nThe problem with this\
    \ approach is that the Scandinavian peasant may be prompted to bat back a further\
    \ piece of his own rustic wisdom, to which you will feel compelled to supply a\
    \ rejoinder. You will swiftly find yourself embroiled in an escalating exchange\
    \ of countryside proverbs which you cannot win. He is a peasant, and you are not.\
    \ He will always be able to top your saw with something more abstruse, born of\
    \ generations of experience tilling the Scandinavian fields. You should therefore\
    \ deploy a different tactic. Instead of following the brow and the lips and the\
    \ eyes and the head and the chin business with a couplet of weather lore, you\
    \ should allow a significant pause, and then say:\nAnd in the morning, It will\
    \ be foul weather to-day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye\
    \ can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?\n\
    This is a Biblical quotation, from the Gospel of Matthew, 16:3. Assuming for one\
    \ moment that the Scandinavian peasant does not take it personally, it is likely\
    \ that he will be stunned into silence, like a dumb ox. You then have the advantage.\
    \ But bear in mind the possibility that he does take it personally, and thinks\
    \ you are accusing him, wildly, of hypocrisy. He may be a violent peasant, and\
    \ lift up his spade to bash you about the head. If you are wearing a hidden earpiece,\
    \ a bash will dislodge it, and you will no longer have the simultaneous translation\
    \ to let you know what he is saying. To prevent this happening, you should have\
    \ in your pocket some kind of treat with which to placate him. A piece of smoked\
    \ and dried herring will usually suffice. You should keep it wrapped in greaseproof\
    \ paper to avoid sullying the lining of your pocket.\nThere is, however, the possibility\
    \ that he may be a Bible-thumping Scandinavian peasant, as familiar with the Old\
    \ and New Testaments as he is with weather lore. If this is the case, he may respond\
    \ to your Matthew 16:3 with, say, his Isaiah 36:16-17:\nDrick var och en vatten\
    \ i sin brunn, tills jag kommer och tar dig bort.\nThis will put you in something\
    \ of a pickle. Unless you have the measure of his Bible-learning, and how could\
    \ you?, you have no guarantee that you will be able to match him quote for quote.\
    \ Remember he may well be a Lutheran. You will need to be pretty damn confident\
    \ of your own store of memorised Biblical verses to embark upon a tit-for-tat.\
    \ Weighing things in the balance, your best option is to reply:\nDrink ye every\
    \ one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away.\nBy merely\
    \ echoing back at him the Authorised Version version of his own sally, you may\
    \ well succeed in bringing the exchange to a close. Neither of you has outwitted\
    \ the other, neither of you has lost face. He can take up his spade and go off\
    \ to till his fields in a peasanty way, and you can wander off in the opposite\
    \ direction, to your holiday chalet, or special rapporteur's concrete pillbox,\
    \ or wherever it is you are staying. When both of you have walked about twenty\
    \ paces, you might turn and wave to each other, in amicable farewell. The next\
    \ morning, or evening, when you encounter each other again in the field, you will\
    \ both be better prepared, and companionable silence will almost certainly be\
    \ appropriate.\nNext week, in our series on conversational gambits with Scandinavian\
    \ peasants, we will look at the best approach should you find yourself talking\
    \ of the varying merits of agricultural implements. For your homework, make a\
    \ list of farm implements mentioned in the Bible, using as your sources both the\
    \ Authorised Version and a Scandinavian-language Lutheran edition."
