  text: 'Yesterday I had a persistent earworm in the form of the Skye Boat Song. "Speed,
    bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing..." I have to say this was a more welcome
    noise in my head than the usual one, which, as I explained a while ago at The
    Dabbler, tends to be "Happy Christmas (War Is Over)" by John Lennon and the woman
    Cornelius Cardew threw out of his house. With the Skye Boat Song echoing through
    my brain all day, I was able to recall that, when I was an infant, this tune made
    me well up in tears. I thought it was the most gorgeous melody I had heard in
    all my six or seven years.

    But where did I hear it? We were not a musical family. There was an old bakelite
    radio in the house, with frequencies for Hilversum and Luxembourg marked (among
    others), but I don''t have any clear memories of listening to it. We also had
    a Dansette record player, on which my elder sisters span the latest waxing from
    the Liverpudlian moptops. Other than that, I think the music I heard most often
    was the hymns we sang in church every Sunday. Well, some sang, like my father,
    who had a tin ear but belted out the hymns with misplaced enthusiasm. I just opened
    and closed my mouth at what seemed like appropriate times.

    I must have heard the Skye Boat Song at infant school. Whether it was a recording
    or was sung by one of my teachers I cannot remember. What I do remember is that
    it was the first piece of music I had an emotional response to. This was absolutely
    nothing to do with the words, all that guff about Bonnie Prince Charlie escaping
    to Skye after his defeat at Culloden. The travails of Scottish royals had no purchase
    on my heart. And the only words I remember--then as now--are the opening lines
    as quoted above. It was the tune that stirred me, and made me a tearful little
    infant.

    It would have been a couple of years later that, rummaging through my sisters''
    small collection of 45 rpm singles, I came upon a couple of records that I played
    to death. Neither of them made me weep, but I loved them nonetheless. One was
    "Can''t Buy Me Love" by the Liverpudlian moptops, the other "Like A Rolling Stone"
    by Bob Dylan. Given my lifelong obsession with words, it''s interesting that what
    I adored about the latter was less the lyrics tumbling out of the singer in that
    grating whine, but the sound of that band.

    A couple more years passed, and then my elder brother began to bring LPs home.
    His first purchase was Abbey Road. Even at that early age, I loathed "Maxwell''s
    Silver Hammer". I was not entirely convinced by "Octopus''s Garden" either. Sorry,
    Ringo. The rest of it I rather liked, but there was nothing there to make me weep.
    Now, years later, I find I can get quite emotional listening to "Golden Slumbers",
    but not then. My brother''s second LP was Stand Up by Jethro Tull, featuring the
    hairy monopod flautist. Here I found something that almost, but not quite, prompted
    the tears which I was beginning to suspect I sought from music. Clearly I have
    deep reserves of mawkishness. The penultimate song on side two, "Reasons For Waiting",
    tugged at my heartstrings. Listening to it now, I cannot imagine why. I still
    harbour an extraordinary affection for the early Jethro Tull albums, but if there
    is sobbing now it is generally prompted by laughter. As with Leonard Cohen, there
    is a vein of humour in Ian Anderson too readily overlooked. Thick As A Brick is
    one of the funniest records ever made--and deliberately so, I hasten to add.

    One day when I was about fourteen I at last discovered music that brought tears
    to my eyes, just as the Skye Boat Song had done. This was one of the very few
    LPs in my father''s scant collection, a recording of Paul Tortelier and Jean Hubeau
    playing the Elegy and Two Sonatas by Gabriel Faure. I played it over and over
    again for weeks on end, tears streaming down my face. That cello will get you
    every time.

    But then I was beset by teenpersonhood, and I fell hopelessly in love with Henry
    Cow. A love that has survived, of course. But nobody ever accused Tim Hodgkinson
    et al of mawkishness. I was by now at grammar school, where the ungainly youths
    split into two musical camps. There were the spotty bespectacled wannabe intellectuals,
    lapping up prog, and the poptastic kids dazzled by glam. You will not need to
    be told which tribe I belonged to. Though I should say I had a soft spot for Roxy
    Music, at least in the early two-Brians period, which my sniffier pals abhorred.

    A few years later and punk happened. Young Mr Key was a little slow on the uptake,
    it has to be said. Spitting pogoists were not my cup of tea. But the John Peel
    show was, and one night I recall hearing the Desperate Bicycles, and undergoing
    a Damascene conversion. I think I went so far as to ban records made by men with
    beards from my turntable. (Fortunately, there were no beards in Henry Cow. Preposterous
    sideburns, yes. Beards, no.) As punk became post-punk, I became ever more enamoured.
    Younger readers may struggle to believe that Scritti Politti were once the most
    brilliant group in the entire universe, as I insisted at the time. That time was
    lamentably brief, and ended with the release of "The ''Sweetest Girl''" in 1981,
    after which everything recorded by Green (real name Paul Strohmeyer-Gartside)
    can be consigned to a dustbin and buried in a lead-lined vault deep below the
    earth''s surface.

    But time passes, and we grow older, and we sift and sort and filter. And we find
    ourselves once more wishing to hear music that makes us weep. As David Bowie asked
    in "Young Americans", "Ain''t there one damn song that can make me break down
    and cry?" Well, yes, there is, and in my case chief among them would appear to
    be the Skye Boat Song. Make of that what you will.'
