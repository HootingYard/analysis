  text: 'There was a programme on the box last night called Gas Rig Strip-Down. According
    to the listings, "Tom Wrigglesworth and Rob Bell watch as a gas platform is pulled
    from the North Sea and taken to Newcastle to be disassembled". This sounded quite
    exciting, but I didn''t watch it for two reasons. First, because from that description
    I feared that we would learn a lot about the, er, "personalities" of Messrs Wrigglesworth
    and Bell, at the expense of just watching a gas rig being dismantled. Second,
    because I would have preferred a programme in which, without the intercession
    of the presenters, we watch a gas platform being pulled from the North Sea and
    taken to Newcastle to be disassembled by monkeys. Actually, it would be even better
    if the gas rig was left where it was in the middle of the North Sea and monkeys
    ''coptered out to it, to dismantle it in situ.

    Alan Partridge was on to something with his idea for monkey tennis. Monkeys taking
    apart large pieces of infrastructure would make splendid television. I would place
    watching monkeys dismantling a gas rig pretty high on a list of things I''d like
    to see before I die, up there in the dismantling section with seeing a life dismantled
    of muffins.

    Generally speaking, I think any large-scale sea-based construction such as a gas
    rig or an oil rig or even a huge rusting container ship is best taken to bits
    by animals. This is not without precedent. Years ago, at a time when the Chitty
    And Fagg coach company was still plying the coast roads of Kent, from Dover to
    Margate, there was an occasion when hundreds, or possibly thousands, of warthogs
    were let loose on a dilapidated and decommissioned hospital ship. The din of grunting
    was incredible, and drowned out the sound of foghorns. But there wasn''t much
    left of the ship by the time the hogs were ferried back to shore in a flotilla
    of motorboats. Wild animals will just get on with the job, in a frenzied manner.

    Insects, too, can be utilised for dismantling purposes. Ants and beetles and other
    tiny scurrying things can overrun the largest gas rig in a matter of minutes,
    and can destroy it with surprising speed.

    Monkey demolition was pioneered by Chitty And Fagg. When one of their charabancs
    or pantechnicons was ready for the scrap heap, they would drive it out to the
    seaside and park it by the shore, then go and collect some monkeys. They had one
    or two menagerists in their pockets. Left to their own devices, the monkeys made
    short work of the clapped-out coaches. A few elderly people in those parts can
    remember being taken down to the beach to watch monkeys dismantling charabancs,
    and will tell you all about it over a cup of cocoa, but their "carers" always
    think they are raving and delirious. Some of us know better.

    The beach-based dismantlings were Chitty''s idea. Fagg, the visionary, wanted
    to have their redundant vehicles towed out to sea, and deposited on a specially-built
    platform, out of sight of land. Once in place, it was his intention to test out
    various beasts and birds and insects to see which would do the most efficient
    job. He had a curious mania about leafcutter ants, for example, and also otters.
    Chitty, who held the purse strings, vetoed the idea, on grounds both of expense
    and sheer common sense. Fagg went ahead and had the platform built anyway, using
    money provided by one of his uncles, a rascally blackguard with a suspicious moustache
    and a gap in his teeth, the spit and image of Terry-Thomas. But the menagerists
    who provided the animals were loyal to Chitty, who knew how to wrap them round
    his fingers with promises of Chitty And Fagg shares, debentures, and other financial
    inducements. The coach company founders fell out. Chitty had his monkeys and his
    beach dismantlements; Fagg had a useless platform rusting away in the sea, and
    no animals to tow out to it even if he had a means to get one of the old charabancs
    to it, which he did not, for his uncle had fled to Bolivia with the police in
    pursuit. I would like to say "hot pursuit", but quite frankly Fagg''s uncle was
    small fry as far as the coppers were concerned, and they sent only one detective
    to Bolivia to run him to ground, a semi-retired and muddle-headed fellow called
    Simpkins.

    Intriguingly, Simpkins came from a family of monkey trainers on one side and infrastructure
    disassembling experts on the other. I have not been able to find out which side
    was which, whether it was his father''s lot who trained monkeys and his mother''s
    kin who demolished large constructions, or whether it was the other way round.
    Nor do the extant records tell us why Simpkins himself followed neither trade,
    and became a copper instead. He did write his Memoirs, but they are so unutterably
    tedious that nobody has ever managed to get past page ten, by which point the
    future detective has not yet been born.

    In spite of their differences, Chitty and Fagg kept the coach company going. Monkeys
    continued to ravage their unwanted vehicles, to the delight of parties of children
    taken to the beach to watch. As for Fagg''s sea platform, some say it is still
    there, a rusted hulk serving as a rest stop for auks and guillemots and skuas
    and terns and gulls and other seabirds. But no one is quite sure where exactly
    it is. What we do know is that, according to Fagg''s notes, it is as enormous
    as the most enormous of gas rigs, as yet undismantled by monkeys, out in the sea.'
