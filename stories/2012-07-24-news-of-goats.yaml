  text: "Many thanks to Glyn Webster for alerting me to this exciting headline:\n\
    Fears for goat-man in Utah wild herd\nI cannot help wondering if the fellow togged\
    \ up as a goat might be related to the goat-boy in that favourite children's rhyme,\
    \ which I am sure all Hooting Yard readers have by heart:\nIncey-wincey goat-boy,\
    \ creature of two realms.\n  We can see you darting in between the elms.\n  Half\
    \ of you is human, the other half's a goat.\n  Incey-wincey goat-boy, drowning\
    \ in a moat."
