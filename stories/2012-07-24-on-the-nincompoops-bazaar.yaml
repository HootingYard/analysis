  text: "Summer is here, and with it comes the annual Pointy Town Nincompoops\u2019\
    \ Bazaar. This year, as ever, the Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar will be held in a particularly\
    \ pointy part of Pointy Town. Preparations are well in hand, and several nincompoops\
    \ have already laid out their stalls.\nThis year, among the bargains available\
    \ to punters will be antimony, breadcrumbs, curd, digestive biscuits, egg tapestries,\
    \ frozen milk, galoshes, hats, ink, joggers\u2019 funnels, kaolin, lemon meringue\
    \ pie, mother's wreckage, narthex rubbings, obsidian cat helmets, preening equipment,\
    \ quicklime, rusty pins, sausages, talc, urban pointy things, vulgar snoods, wax,\
    \ xylophones, yeast bags, and zookeepers\u2019 cushions.\nIn the Kathy Kirby Memorial\
    \ Tent we are promised Quetzalcoatl puppets, wind chimes, earmuffs, ratcatchers\u2019\
    \ trousers, tin, yoghourt, uncooked pork, instant mashed potato, offal, portable\
    \ anvils, anchors, sock hoists, damp cloth, fierce wild beasts, glue, hornets,\
    \ jam, kevlar dog helmets, limestone, zookeepers\u2019 pin-cushions, x-rayed innards,\
    \ custard, vinkensport scorecards, bait, noodles, and marzipan. There will be\
    \ a flag atop the tent, and a Tannoy belting out nincompoopised versions of the\
    \ instrumental bits from Kathy Kirby's chart-toppers, played on the glockenspiel.\n\
    A map of the site should soon be available, done in crayon and pencil by orphans\
    \ from Pang Hill Orphanage. The light is dim in the Orphanage cellar, and the\
    \ orphans are somewhat cack-handed, so the map may not actually be very helpful.\
    \ As an alternative, visitors can be guided around the bazaar by a goat on the\
    \ end of a chain. There is only one goat, so expect lengthy queues. The goat is\
    \ an authentic nincompoop's Toggenburg, with three natural legs and one made of\
    \ wood. The wooden leg has been given a slap of bright yellow paint to aid visibility\
    \ in the more tenebrous areas of this pointy part of Pointy Town, where the enormous\
    \ pointy bits block out the sunlight with pointy black shadows.\nIn the lee of\
    \ these shadows are several specialist stalls offering mole nets, nasal sprays,\
    \ blood oranges, vapour, Chumpot patent soap, xysters for bone-scraping, zookeepers\u2019\
    \ pin-cushion holders, lettuce, kedgeree, jumping fleas, helicopter pilots\u2019\
    \ insignia, grease, froth, desk tidies, string, asbestos, potato novelties, orpiment,\
    \ isinglass, unhelpful maps, yachting caps, trick propelling pencils, rotogravures,\
    \ embossed badger badges, will-o-the-wisps, and quince jelly.\nFollowing certain\
    \ unspeakable tragedies that occurred at last year's Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar,\
    \ the organisers are at pains to point out that no nincompoops will be armed to\
    \ the teeth this time around. Of course they should not have been allowed to bring\
    \ all those pointy sticks and poison-tipped pointy lances and pointy swords. Signpost\
    \ chaos meant they mistook the Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar for the Nincompoops\u2019\
    \ Jamboree, which was unfortunately scheduled to take place at the same time,\
    \ and not that far away, but in a marginally less pointy part of Pointy Town.\
    \ That both the Bazaar and the Jamboree had a Kathy Kirby Memorial Tent only added\
    \ to the confusion, and the bloodshed.\nJust in case anything untoward does take\
    \ place this year, there will be an ambulance on site, with a crate of bandages\
    \ and various gooey substances. The ambulance will be stationed next to, or near,\
    \ or at least in the general vicinity of the inky-black fathomless pond teeming\
    \ with blind slithering horrors, next to the swings. For the duration of the Nincompoops\u2019\
    \ Bazaar the swings will be chained up and electrified, to discourage tinies from\
    \ frolicking upon them. We do not want any swings-and-pond mishaps, after all.\n\
    If you are crawling towards where you think the ambulance is, pierced with pointy\
    \ arrows like St Sebastian and rapidly losing both blood and the will to live,\
    \ but cannot find the ambulance, listen out for the klaxon. The klaxoneer's podium\
    \ is among the stalls selling zookeepers\u2019 pin-cushion holder's padlocks,\
    \ yapping dogs, x-box wiring, weird coathangers, vouchers for dough, ungodly cravats,\
    \ turps, siphons, rubber Beelzebubs, quartered pigs, pips, orreries, nothing,\
    \ muck, lumps, klaxons, jugs, impenetrabilia, horrid squashed things, glove compartment\
    \ tat, flimflam, earwiggery, dust, creosote, buzzy bees, and aniseed.\nJust a\
    \ reminder that you do not need to be a nincompoop to come to the Nincompoops\u2019\
    \ Bazaar. For a small fee you can be made an honorary nincompoop for the day,\
    \ with a pointy cap and a badge and some embroidered emblems and your arm in a\
    \ plaster cast and a small sluicing procedure to your brain through a trepanned\
    \ vent, the trepanning carried out by a qualified nincompoop with a hand-held\
    \ iron pointy twisty boring and screwing contraption daubed in a gooey substance\
    \ and wiped clean with a rag between screwings. For directions to the Julie Felix\
    \ Folk Singing \u2018n\u2019 Trepanning Tent, follow the pointy arrows in the\
    \ flowerbeds, planted with lupins and phlox and bindweed and buddleia.\nOne small\
    \ note about the werewolves patrolling the site, fangs bared, howling. Remember\
    \ that these are nincompoop werewolves, and are generally harmless. They will\
    \ cease stalking you if you toss them a bucketful of liver and lights and other\
    \ innards from something freshly slaughtered. Even the innards of a goldfish or\
    \ a newt will do. It also helps to pat the werewolves on the head, as if you are\
    \ not terrified of them, and make gurgly cooing noises.\nTickets for the Nincompoops\u2019\
    \ Bazaar are available from a number of pointy kiosks in Pointy Town, and further\
    \ afield, in unpointy places which aspire to pointiness. You will require several\
    \ forms of identification in order to purchase tickets. These include a bus pass,\
    \ a three-dimensional computer-generated hologram of your head, a fistful of your\
    \ hair torn out at the roots, nail clippings, voice-recognition tape-recordings\
    \ made on a clapped-out old cassette player, a letter from your priest, your dental\
    \ records, a recent utility bill, and a replacement bus pass for replacement bus\
    \ services.\nThe Nincompoops\u2019 Bazaar really is a spectacular day out for\
    \ the whole family, including the dribbling and incontinent ones, and those with\
    \ criminal records. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on, and we hope\
    \ to see you there!"
