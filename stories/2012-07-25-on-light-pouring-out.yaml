  text: "Magazine's 1978 song \"The Light Pours Out Of Me\" is a splendid example\
    \ of a lyric in which the singer claims to have light pouring out of him. A couple\
    \ of others that spring to mind are \"See Me Emit A Remarkable Effulgence\" by\
    \ Periodical, and Gazetteer's \"I Bear A Striking Resemblance To A Switched On\
    \ Incandescent Lightbulb\". Neither of these had the success of Magazine's foray\
    \ into the genre, perhaps with good reason.\nBy any measure, Magazine's song is\
    \ both musically and lyrically superior. Those of us who have calculated the Blotzmann\
    \ units (Second Handbook, Lavender Series) arrive at 14.76 for Magazine, 8.35\
    \ for Periodical, and a lamentable 2.06 for Gazetteer. It is important to stress\
    \ that Blotzmann's is an exact science, so there is no room for manoeuvre.\nIn\
    \ interviews, Periodical's singer and lyricist Hereward Scrimgeour has always\
    \ insisted that \"See Me Emit A Remarkable Effulgence\" paints a far more vivid\
    \ picture of light pouring out of himself than Howard Devoto's effort. But the\
    \ Blotzmann units do not lie, and one listen to the song after all these years\
    \ serves to remind us why it was roundly ignored. The music is very plinky-plonky.\
    \ This is not always a bad thing, of course, and some plinky-plonky records have\
    \ been chart hits, or at the very least acceptable filler as album tracks. That\
    \ said, plinky-plonkiness is a difficult art to master, as Dobson proved conclusively\
    \ in his majestic pamphlet The Difficulty Of Mastering The Art Of Plinky-Plonky\
    \ Musical Composition, With A Mezzotint Of Chas 'n' Dave (out of print). Dobson\
    \ argues that the balance of plinks and plonks is critical, and it is this balance,\
    \ I think, or the lack of it, that undermines the Periodical piece. At times it\
    \ is all plinky, at others all plonky, and the plinks and plonks never seem to\
    \ coalesce into plinky-plonkiness proper.\nChallenged on this score in a notorious\
    \ interview by Russell Harty, Hereward Scrimgeour babbled some bollocks about\
    \ Ravel, Buxtehude, and Scriabin before bursting into tears, tearing the microphone\
    \ from his lapel, running out of the studio, and flinging himself into a canal,\
    \ from which he was rescued by screaming teenagers who had been encamped outside\
    \ the television studio, mistaking the Periodical front man for Gilbert O'Sullivan,\
    \ to whom he bore a passing resemblance from a certain angle in a certain light\
    \ on certain days of the week.\nIt is not just the flawed plinky-plonkiness of\
    \ the music, however, but the lyrics too, which fail to match up to Magazine's\
    \ song. Fatally, Scrimgeour seems to have taken as his guide that \"See Me, Feel\
    \ Me, Touch Me\" twaddle from The Who's Tommy. Indeed, when first he caterwauls\
    \ the words \"See me ...\", and pauses, we are startled to think we are listening\
    \ to Roger Daltrey himself. Scrimgeour then tries to jam the words \"emit a remarkable\
    \ effulgence\" into the exact same melody as Daltrey's \"feel me, touch me\".\
    \ Try it yourself and you will appreciate that only a madcap could ever think\
    \ it would be something teenyboppers would want to hear more than once. With the\
    \ plinks and plonks accompanying the words, it really is the most godawful racket.\n\
    Well, perhaps not the most. That accolade, if accolade it is, must be reserved\
    \ for Gazetteer's \"I Bear A Striking Resemblance To A Switched On Incandescent\
    \ Lightbulb\". The title suggests a novelty record, or one of those disarmingly\
    \ naive amateurish postpunk ditties which used to amuse us all those years ago.\
    \ In fact, it is the most godawful racket, and determinedly so, a twenty-minute\
    \ barrage of improvised din produced by amplified cheese-graters, coathangers,\
    \ bags of cement, hammers and nails and screwdrivers and funnels and hooters and\
    \ the Lord knows what else. Accompanying this cacophony, Gazetteer's singer and\
    \ lyricist Harold Stalin alternately shrieks, whispers, declaims and mutters a\
    \ rhyme so foolish it beggars belief. I will not try your patience by reproducing\
    \ the whole thing, but here is a sample:\nI bear a striking resemblance to a switched\
    \ on incandescent lightbulb, yeah?\n  My lightbulb-shaped head is entirely bald\
    \ because this morning I shaved off all my hair.\n  I might do the whole thing\
    \ again later.\n  Take it away, amplified cheese-grater!\n  [Solo]\nHarold Stalin\
    \ took his amplified cheese-grater with him when he made an appearance on Russell\
    \ Harty Plus, a week after Hereward Scrimgeour had fled the studio. A more convincing\
    \ interviewee than the Periodical singer, Stalin charmed Harty with a series of\
    \ verbal sallies that seemed incongruous coming from the mouth of such an idiotic\
    \ lyricist. He demonstrated wit, verve, erudition, and a kind of gumption, all\
    \ in the space of five minutes. Harty was so bowled over he asked if he could\
    \ have a go with the cheese-grater. Fiddling about with the attached wiring just\
    \ before passing it to the chatshow host, Harold Stalin got his sockets mixed\
    \ up and managed to electrocute himself. He survived the accident, but was never\
    \ quite the same. He certainly lost his wit, verve, erudition and kind of gumption.\
    \ He disbanded Gazetteer and formed a new group, adopting a new pseudonym, and\
    \ went on to huge international success followed by lute-playing. As far as I\
    \ am aware he still goes under the same name, which I think is \"String\", or\
    \ something like that.\nThere are several other songs in which the singer claims\
    \ to have light pouring out of him, but they are quite difficult to track down.\
    \ Dobson wrote a pamphlet about his own, tireless, efforts to do so, to which\
    \ he gave the title Lead, Kindly Light, To Bald Men Wearing Specs (out of print).\
    \ If ever you stumble upon a copy in a secondhand pamphlet shop, be very very\
    \ careful. Marigold Chew devised a special cover which, when opened, reveals a\
    \ blinding incandescent light not unlike that which shines forth from the mysterious\
    \ case in Kiss Me Deadly (Robert Aldrich, 1955), starring Ralph Meeker and Cloris\
    \ Leachman.\n"
