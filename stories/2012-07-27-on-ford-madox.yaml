  text: 'Detective Captain Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb was not related either to the
    writer Ford Madox Ford (1873-1939) nor to his grandfather, the painter Ford Madox
    Brown (1821-1893). Ford Madox Ford was born Ford Hermann Hueffer, went by the
    name Ford Madox Hueffer, and in 1919, decided to ditch the Hueffer because, in
    the aftermath of the Great War, it sounded too German. Casting around for a new
    surname, he did not look far, and simply repeated the Ford. Similarly, there came
    a point when Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb decided to get rid of the Unstrebnodtalb,
    allegedly because it sounded too foolish, and in choosing a replacement went for
    Madox, so he became known as Ford Madox Madox.

    I have tried to discover if there are any notable persons named Madox Ford Madox
    or Madox Ford Ford, but so far without success. Nor have I found anybody called
    Ford Madox Green or Ford Madox Black or Ford Madox followed by any other colour
    on the spectrum. One will turn up eventually, of that I am sure.

    As a Detective Captain with a clutch of exciting cases under his belt, Ford Madox
    Unstrebnodtalb had a vast amount of paperwork to do when he changed his name to
    Ford Madox Madox. He had to go back over all his old case files in the basements
    of several different police stations, crossing out Unstrebnodtalb and inserting
    Madox. This was in the days before Liquid Paper correction fluid had been invented
    by the mother of the Monkee Mike Nesmith, so the Detective Captain had to scratch
    out the Unstrebnodtalbs with a sharp pointy blade, without actually gashing a
    hole in the paper, and then gingerly write Madox in the resulting off-white space.
    How much easier the job would have been had Liquid Paper, or its rival, Tipp-Ex
    been invented!

    Incidentally, there are those who claim Mike Nesmith''s mother invented Tipp-Ex,
    but that was a separate innovation devised by Wolfgang Dabisch in Germany. Dabisch
    was not related to any Monkee. Liquid Paper was invented in 1951, and Tipp-Ex
    in 1959. Quite what the difference between these two products is I have no idea,
    save that one is American and the other European. Nor do I know if Bette Nesmith
    Graham and Wolfgang Dabisch ever met, at some kind of correction fluid summit.
    Had they done so, it would certainly have been a clash of the titans. I must do
    further research on this particular point, and if I get nowhere, just make something
    up in lieu of facts.

    Before leaving this absolutely fascinating topic and getting back to our main
    business of the day, which is Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb aka Ford Madox Madox,
    it is worth noting that Dabisch is a splendid surname for an inventor of correction
    fluid, given that you sort of dab the stuff carefully on to the paper, or at least
    you used to, in the days when we used typewriters rather than these newfangled
    space age computers. Of course, some writers stick loyally to their typewriters,
    and some indeed even more loyally to pens and pencils. For all I know there may
    even be writers who still use goose quills. I have been tempted to do so myself,
    were it not that the logistics of creating a daily blog from scratchy goose quill
    manuscripts seems so fearfully complicated.

    I apologise, by the way, for using the word "logistics". It is one of those words
    much favoured by the kinds of people who like nothing more than to obfuscate and
    to make simple tasks sound complex. Coupled with "solutions" it is even more horrifying.
    Though I have to say if I saw a van passing with Ford Madox Logistics Solutions
    emblazoned on its side I would be very tempted to scribble down the telephone
    number or email address for future reference. One final logistics note: I have
    seen an advertising poster repeatedly in recent days inviting me to "Imagine the
    Olympic Games without logistics". I have, and they were remarkably like the Olympic
    Games with logistics, but that is perhaps a failure of my imagination.

    A few paragraphs ago we left Detective Captain Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb, now
    Ford Madox Madox, in the basement of one among any number of police stations altering
    old case files, scratching out Unstrebnodtalb and inserting Madox. Now admittedly,
    this is not the most enticing of scenes. Even tiptop writers like frizzy-haired
    Jeanette Winterson and that equally frizzy-haired chap, what''s his name?, oh
    yes, Sebastian Faulks, would be hard-pressed to make something of it. Grunting
    detective, in basement, armed with sharp pointy thing, scratching away.

    I suppose one could introduce a thrilling time-travel element, where a being from
    the future suddenly materialises behind the Detective Captain. Unstrebnodtalb
    / Madox spins around, a look of astonishment on his chops. The being from the
    future tells him to be not afeared, the way angels do in Bible stories, but then
    assures the Detective Captain he is not an angel.

    "I am merely a being from the future," he says, "1960, to be precise. And in that
    future which you must find as unimaginable as the Olympic Games without logistics,
    do you know what? We no longer need to scratch out writing with sharp pointy blades,
    for we have something called correction fluid! Look!"

    And the being takes from one pocket a bottle of Liquid Paper, and from another
    pocket a bottle of Tipp-Ex, and says:

    "Not only do we have correction fluid, we have two different types. One is American,
    and it is called Liquid Paper, and the other is German, and called Tipp-Ex."

    Ford Madox Unstrebnodtalb aka Madox is goggle-eyed. He reaches out his hands to
    take one, or both, of the bottles. But the being pops them back into his pockets
    and slaps the Detective Captain''s hands away.

    "Sorry, but I cannot let you use them. Were you to do so, an anomaly would be
    created in the space-time continuum that could have cataclysmic world-shuddering
    effects on the very fabric of the universe!"

    And with that, he dematerialises, leaving the Detective Captain once again alone
    in the basement of a shabby provincial police station.

    Beat that, Winterson and Faulks, with your frizzy hair and Oxbridge backgrounds
    and publishing contracts!

    And Mr Key softly and suddenly vanishes away, in search of a bottle of ink and
    a goose quill . . .'
