  text: 'Ever mindful of the need to trim the wicks of his tallow candles, Dobson
    employed for the purpose a tiny pair of shears which he deployed using the so-called
    Blotzmann Manoeuvres.

    I took against electricity from an early age, he wrote, lying shamelessly, and
    often found myself in a quandary because untrimmed wicks set my teeth on edge.
    For a long time I thought the remedy for this was to imbue my teeth with greater
    strength, foolish young pup that I was. I crunched nuts morning, noon, and night,
    nuts of many different kinds. I had no favourites in the nut world, although of
    course the harder the nut, and the greater the effort needed to crunch it into
    a digestible pap, the hardier my teeth became, and the better they could withstand
    being set on edge by the appearance of untrimmed wicks on the tallow candles I
    used to illuminate my habitat.

    By his own account, a temporary nut shortage forced Dobson to readdress the problem,
    but official statistics give the lie to this. Indeed, at the point where the pamphleteer
    adopted the Blotzmann Manoeuvres, there was a nut glut in the land. According
    to Pocock & Gabbitas, the squirrel population had been decimated by unexpected
    lupine savagery, leaving millions of nuts unhidden. If there was no lack of nuts,
    what made Dobson nail his colours to Blotzmann''s mast? It is significant that
    at this time, unlike later, Dobson''s colours were cherry and dun, and that a
    new Blotzmann mast had been erected atop Pilgarlic Hill, not far from the pig
    farmer''s hut where Dobson had regular sunrise gleanings. The siting of the mast,
    illegal then as now, was a stroke of genius by the Blotzmannist Erno Von Straubenzee,
    who had smuggled himself into the country aboard a packet steamer some months
    earlier.

    Intriguingly, no sooner had Von Straubenzee disembarked from the boat, the Googie
    Withers, than its captain scuppered it, set it ablaze, and promptly vanished.
    Some say he still haunts the warehouses down at the harbour, rattling an old tin
    cup and begging for alms from the rough tough sailors thereabouts. Other stories
    have the one time packet steamer captain retired to the countryside keeping bees,
    like Sherlock Holmes. All that is known for certain is that a single charred plank
    dredged from the quayside was all that survived of the Googie Withers, and it
    was incorporated into a wooden altarpiece in St Bibblybibdib''s church, where
    it can be seen today, if you buy a ticket from the sexton, a monkey-faced man
    who sits in a little canvas kiosk in the churchyard each Thursday afternoon, awaiting
    redemption.

    From the lych-gate of St Bibblybibdib''s, looking westward, on a clear day one
    can see the top of the Blotzmann mast, with its cherry and dun pennants. Turning
    to the east, the prospect is of fields rippling with wheat and rhubarb and hollyhocks
    and stinkwort, punctuated by ha-has and the occasional scarecrow. No wild jabbering
    pigs are to be seen, for they were eradicated by the same unexpected lupine savagery
    which did for the squirrels during the nut glut, just at the time Dobson falsely
    claimed a nut shortage led to his adoption of the Blotzmann Manoeuvres as his
    favoured way of trimming the tallow candle wicks the untrimmedness of which set
    his teeth on edge so.

    But why did Dobson forever deny his association with Erno Von Straubenzee? Decades
    later, when it was put to the pamphleteer that he and the untidy Blotzmannite
    had been fast friends, often cooped up together for days on end in the pig farmer''s
    hut on the hill, scheming and plotting and cackling and letting sawdust trail
    through their fingers, reading the runes, Dobson blushed as he protested that
    the name Von Straubenzee meant nothing to him. He came up with improbable tales
    to account for his whereabouts on certain days when it was suspected the Blotzmann
    mast had been activated. And he was never able to explain how he had learned to
    trim his wicks so deftly with the tiny shears essential to the Blotzmann Manoeuvres.
    The one time he mentions the shears in a pamphlet, he is curiously abrupt.

    In Ten Short Essays On Chopping And Cutting And Hacking (out of print), he gives
    full vent to his thoughts on scissors and scimitars and pastry-cutters, for example,
    devoting over twenty pages to the latter alone. There is detail here aplenty for
    the student who wishes to learn from scratch how to cut up bits of pastry in hundreds
    of different ways. Yet not only is there not a separate essay about the tiny shears,
    they are only mentioned in a footnote, and in such small type that only the most
    assiduous of readers is likely to be bothered with it. I freely admit that I have
    not read it myself, and rely entirely upon the account of the footnote given in
    the latest issue of Marginalia Dobsonia, the scholarly journal edited by Aloysius
    Nestingird.

    Now here''s the thing. Parish records seem to show that Nestingbird is directly
    related to Erno Von Straubenzee, may indeed be his grandson. If true, it would
    explain a lot, although I am not entirely sure what precisely is explained, and
    Nestingbird has never replied to any of my letters. Last week I fired off a sort
    of questionnaire to him, demanding what they call full and frank answers to over
    a dozen accusations. I wanted to know if he had copies of the construction plans
    for the Blotzmann mast, or for any similar mast, if he ever worshipped at the
    wooden altar in St Bibblybibdib''s and, if he did, what god he worshipped there,
    and did he worship standing up, sitting, kneeling, or sprawled prostrate on the
    cold stone floor. I pumped him for an answer to the important question of whether
    he knew the name of the captain of the packet steamer Googie Withers, and what
    had become of that mysterious old sea dog. I threw in a sneaky query about the
    accounting procedures of his scholarly journal, convinced as I am that the profits
    are being salted away to fund the salt mines from which far-flung members of the
    Nestingird clan draw their dubious salaries. I asked all this and more, but of
    course got nothing in return, not even the threats I have become used to from
    the badly-dressed buffoon. I know for a fact that it is Nestingbird, or one of
    his cronies, who has sullied my reputation with the electricity people, and with
    the gas people too, and that both utilities have cut off supplies to my seaside
    cabin, and that is why I, like Dobson before me, now rely upon candlelight, and
    well-trimmed wicks. To date, I have not had to resort to the Blotzmann Manoeuvres,
    for wicks not neatly trimmed have yet to set my teeth on edge. If they do, with
    much bluster I shall begin to crunch nuts, and Nestingbird will be laughing on
    the other side of his pasty face. I will crunch nuts, and cackle, and be righteous
    and roopty-toot.
