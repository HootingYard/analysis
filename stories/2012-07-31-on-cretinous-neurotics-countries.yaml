  text: 'In yesterday''s cryptic crossword in the Grauniad, the solution to 10 across
    was CRETINOUS, to 11 across NEUROTICS, and to 27 across COUNTRIES. This was an
    extraordinary coincidence, as earlier in the day I had been thinking, and thinking
    hard, about cretinous neurotics'' countries. I hasten to add that these thoughts
    were not in any way connected to the Olympic Games. No doubt each country has
    both the cretinous and the neurotic among its participants, but that is a matter
    for the sports writers, not for me.

    Though sport is a field in which the cretinous neurotic can, and does, excel,
    in the countries I was thinking about their purview is much wider. These are the
    lands where cretinism and neurosis are extolled as the ne plus ultra, where the
    cretinous neurotic is not merely coddled and pampered but sits at the top table,
    is given the keys to the kingdom, rules the roost. Countries like Tantarabim and
    Gaar.

    Gaar--sometimes spelled Ga''ar or G''aar--is fertile ground for neurotic cretins.
    Once upon a time this land of marshes, moors, and mountains was ruled by a Sheila
    Parslow-like figure, a "nymphomaniacal moron" in Josephine Tey''s memorable phrase
    for La Parslow given in Brat Farrar (1949). But a coup toppled the old regime,
    led by a particularly neurotic cretin, or an especially cretinous neurotic, according
    to which sources you trust. Certainly Fab Slobber, who pronounced himself King,
    was a proper caution. His brain was tiny and curdled and often overheated, and
    the list of his neuroses would fill several thick leather-bound ledgers. A debilitating
    fear of badgers was just one of his derangements. It was the presence of a badger
    motif on the national flag that precipitated the coup. Fab Slobber''s first act
    was to banish the nymphomaniacal moron. His second was to replace the flag with
    one showing a badger trampled underfoot by a neurotic cretin''s boot. Not long
    after, it was redesigned again, and this time the badger was entirely obliterated,
    leaving the boot stamping on nothing.

    The court of King Fab became a playground for cretins and neurotics. Anyone with
    a jot of sense, or an untroubled cast of mind, swiftly fell from favour and went
    into exile. Yet Gaar thrived. Exports of pig iron went through the roof. Nobody
    who remained in the country knew what the hell it was, so when foreign prospectors
    flooded in and offered to dig it up and take it away, they were given the King''s
    blessing. Civil strife became a thing of the past, and the past itself was abolished,
    as if it had never been, save for those whose neurosis compelled them to live
    in it, proffering outdated coinage, wearing strange pointy hats, and babbling
    archaic argot. It was a happy land, perhaps the happiest that ever was. Cretins
    gambolled o''er the marshes and moors and mountains, neurotics gave unbridled
    vent to their neuroses, and the cretinous neurotics were happiest of all, if a
    neurotic can ever be truly happy.

    Several academic studies have been carried out to determine how a country under
    the governance of a neurotic cretin could be so prosperous, so successful. No
    firm conclusions have yet been reached, though it is instructive to compare the
    example of Gaar with that of Tantarabim. In the latter case, there was no coup
    d''etat. There was no nymphomaniacal moron to be deposed. As far as anybody has
    been able to ascertain, Tantarabim has always been ruled by cretinous neurotics,
    in spite of the fact that the vast majority of its populace are neither cretinous
    nor neurotic. Indeed it has been estimated that, by any measure, the typical Tantarabimer
    has greater brain power and a more equable temperament than the average citizen
    of any other realm, on earth as it is in heaven. Yet year after year, when the
    time comes to call on the haruspex to slaughter a chicken and cast its hot steaming
    entrails upon the civic square, and to read therein the name of the Potentate
    who will rule, tyrannically, Tantarabim for the following twelvemonth, the name
    is invariably that of a neurotic cretin, one who until they rule is kept chained
    up in somebody''s cellar or attic, drooling, and batting flies away from their
    misshapen pointy head. It is a unique system of government, so rare it has never
    been given a name. Yet it works perfectly, so much so that Tantarabim exports
    even more pig iron than Gaar, if you can imagine so bewildering a statistic.

    For the term of his or her rule, the Potentate''s word is law. It matters not
    if the word, mumbled from a mouthful of drool, is cretinous or neurotic. It is
    at once transcribed by the Potentate''s amanuensis, the frizzy-haired so-called
    "Winterson" of Tantarabim, and multiple copies made on an old and creaking Gestetner
    machine, and the copies ferried out across the country by eager sprinters, who
    post the word up on every available flat vertical surface, not excluding those
    that are crumbling or due for demolition. And woe betide the Tantarabimer who
    does not follow these cretinous and neurotic edicts! Woe betide them indeed! Woe,
    woe, and thrice woe! And yet further woe, yea, unto every generation!

    Perhaps the secret of Tantarabim''s success is the guarantee, according to the
    constitution, that precisely a year to the day after the Potentate''s accession,
    they will be taken back to their cellar or attic and chained up again. They will
    be given a pewter pot in which to catch their drool. Flies will be reintroduced
    through ducts and vents, so they can be batted away, thus keeping the cretinous
    neurotic fully occupied. And outside, life will go on, under the iron rule of
    a brand new Potentate, whose decrees will bear no relation whatsoever to those
    of the last one, nor indeed to reality, as apprehended by the citizenry. Thus
    is the body politic ever renewed and refreshed, and the pig iron exports increased.

    I am told there are yet other countries where cretinous neurotics hold sway. I
    must get down to some serious research, and discover where they are, and pay them
    a visit, armed with my notepad and a camera and a strange pointy hat.'
