  text: 'Although barely literate, Henri Lacoste seems to have had intellectual pretensions.
    He used to spend hours with an old friend who had two pet projects: designing
    a revolutionary sort of barometer and solving the vexing problem of squaring the
    circle. Lacoste considered himself an expert in several fields . . . friends reported
    that his normal manner of greeting male acquaintances was to leap on them from
    behind with growling noises and mock biting sounds.

    from Victorian Murderesses : A True History Of Thirteen Respectable French And
    English Women Accused Of Unspeakable Crimes by Mary S Hartman (1977)'
