  text: "Here comes the Krummhorn Man.\n  He's had a palaver.\n  He has to solve acrostics\
    \ for his mother.\n  She is blind, and so is her dog.\n  The dog's name is Spinach.\n\
    \  Spinach is a good name for a dog.\n  That's what mother thinks.\n  She is ninety\
    \ now, and every domestic pet she has ever had since she was a tiny tot she has\
    \ called Spinach.\n  The donkey, the hamster, a kitten, several goldfish, certain\
    \ other types of fish, rabbits and budgerigars, all Spinaches.\n  This might be\
    \ called monomania.\n  The Krummhorn Man looks kindly upon his mother.\n  He is\
    \ a good son.\nTake a look at him now, a shopping list scrunched in his fist,\
    \ prancing up the street.\n  He is on his way to the butcher's.\n  The butcher\
    \ is a caution.\n  He's Cyclopean and bears duelling scars.\n  Lit by the moon,\
    \ he howls, a proper butcher's howl.\n  He keeps a vase of peonies on his mantel.\n\
    \  Oh for campions and oxlips!\n  Today it is sausages for the Krummhorn Man.\n\
    \  The sausages have the name of an English county.\n  The butcher, the butcher,\
    \ the butcher with his meat-cleaver.\n  How sharp it is, and fearsome.\n  He whets\
    \ the blade on a whetstone behind his kiosk.\n  You can hear the scree scree scree\
    \ before dawn.\n  He wakes the town.\nSausages bought, on goes the Krummhorn Man,\
    \ past the haberdasher and the aquarium.\n  Past all things.\n  Out into the gorse\
    \ and nettles, followed by geese.\n  Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin.\n  But he\
    \ is not pied and he has no pipe and it is not Hamelin.\n  It is an English county\
    \ with the same name as the sausages.\n  Or it might be, if things fit neatly\
    \ together.\n  He pops a boiled sweet into his mouth.\n  It is a spangle.\n  Invisible\
    \ threads bind him to the past.\n  He smacks his lips.\n  The sound alerts an\
    \ otter.\n  The Krummhorn Man shook off the geese and now he has an otter.\n \
    \ He sits down by the river.\n  He has to solve acrostics for his mother.\nThe\
    \ wind is fair, the wind is foul.\n  The Krummhorn Man throws in the towel.\n\
    \  It is carried downstream towards the sea.\n  The otter follows him back to\
    \ mother.\n  Dog and otter in mother's parlour.\n  The one blind, the other not.\n\
    \  What a palaver.\nUmbilically linked as once he was he makes a pot of tea.\n\
    \  He ties a knot in a dishcloth and chucks it out of the window.\n  And here\
    \ comes Mister Snippage, toiling along the lane.\n  He is lame and pale and valiant.\n\
    \  What ho, what ho.\n  And tally tally ho too.\n  Then the Krummhorn Man makes\
    \ himself scarce.\n  He takes himself to a place of defeat.\n  He leaves the sausages\
    \ on the kitchen counter.\nWhere would he be if he were not here?\n  Over the\
    \ sea and in a capital city loud with life.\n  Churning up the churnable, sparks\
    \ and pangs, wearing a hat at a jaunty angle, getting into tangles, bumping things.\n\
    \  He peers into the distance through the mist.\n  The glue factory has closed\
    \ down.\n  He keeps one arm in a sling for old time's sake.\n  He was once the\
    \ invalids' invalid, just as the butcher is the butchers' butcher.\n  It says\
    \ so on a sign on his wall.\n  There is a red wax seal embossed on it of heraldic\
    \ significance.\n  Red wax too in the Krummhorn Man's hair.\n  A barber put it\
    \ there for a prank.\n  Little gobbets, tiny orbs.\n  He is a very peculiar barber,\
    \ shunned by many, and that is no surprise.\n  The barber is down a way from the\
    \ butcher and the haberdasher and the aquarium, and around a corner, ever in shadow.\n\
    \  It is where they hold table-rapping meetings, with ectoplasm.\n  The Krummhorn\
    \ Man sought his father there.\n  He is a good son.\nHedges flank the abandoned\
    \ glue factory.\n  They have not been snipped for many a spring.\n  It is a place\
    \ to pine.\n  There are still nozzles to be seen among the ruins.\n  The Krummhorn\
    \ Man has his favourites.\n  He has snapped thousands of photographs with a long\
    \ lens.\n  He used to use a Polaroid.\n  Polaroids and polar bears and polar wastes,\
    \ he kept them together in his head.\n  It was a nice head, mother said.\n  It\
    \ was the colour of curd.\n  The otter was gone from the parlour when he went\
    \ back, bent on his sausages.\n  The fat sizzled in the pan.\nJust then Mister\
    \ Snippage came toiling back along the lane and began to pound on the door with\
    \ his great hairy fists.\n  Spinach dragged his ancient canine bones to the doormat\
    \ and dribbled.\n  At the same time the telephone rang and an alarm sounded.\n\
    \  It was pandaemonium.\n  The hospital helicopter was circling overhead.\n  There\
    \ was gunfire coming from the hills.\n  It turned out to be a mock emergency,\
    \ staged by actors.\n  Even Mister Snippage was not really Mister Snippage at\
    \ all.\n  His part was played by an elfin amateur caked in makeup.\n  The sausages\
    \ were burned black.\nSee, see, the Krummhorn Man has set out again, in the rain,\
    \ in the rain.\n  This time he has taken a pipe.\n  Its bowl is in the lee of\
    \ the brim of his hat so the rain does not douse it.\n  But the shutters are down\
    \ at the butcher's shop.\n  The butcher is gone for the day.\n  Where is he gone\
    \ to?\n  That is what everyone is asking, in a huddle at his door.\n  Then the\
    \ band strikes up that old traditional air \"Butcher, Butcher, Where Have You\
    \ Been?\"\n  But until he comes back they will be in the dark.\nButcher, butcher,\
    \ where have you been?\n  Until I come back you will be in the dark.\n  Butcher,\
    \ butcher, what have you seen?\n  I have seen a swan in a pond in the park.\n\
    \  Butcher, butcher, why is it dark?\n  Because the shutters are down on my shop\
    \ on the street.\n  Butcher, butcher, will you ever come back?\n  I shall return\
    \ with contaminated meat.\nThe Krummhorn Man goes home sausageless in the downpour.\n\
    \  He must solve acrostics for his mother.\n  Spinach is asleep in front of the\
    \ fire.\n  He is dreaming a dog dream of triumph and vinegar."
