  text: 'Not being an evildoer myself, I find it hard to believe that one of my fellow
    creatures--what am I saying?--a monster, indeed, could have obliged a woman to
    point a revolver at his head, and I am even less capable of explaining his flight.

    I am no hero of bravado, but I am not afraid; I do not court danger, but I have
    courage, sustained energy, and a will of iron . . . To be killed by a bullet from
    the revolver of a pretty woman, held in an adorable hand, aimed by eyes that could
    make an Andalusian''s pale by comparison . . . Few men can hope to die that way.

    In this life, one is exposed to many things: one can be bitten by a mad dog, stung
    by a fly, run over by an omnibus, or be the victim of a derailing. A termite can
    slyly find its way into your ceiling, you can suddenly receive some bad news,
    you can catch cholera, you can burn your mustache, you can be blinded by a falling
    star, you can have a mother-in-law, you can lose your umbrella . . .

    Hippolyte Bazard, in a letter to Henriette Francey after she had threatened him
    with a pistol. A few days later, she shot him dead. Quoted in Victorian Murderesses
    : A True History Of Thirteen Respectable French And English Women Accused Of Unspeakable
    Crimes by Mary S Hartman (1977)'
