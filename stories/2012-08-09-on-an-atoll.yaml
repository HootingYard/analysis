  text: "Dobson once found himself marooned on a remote atoll. The circumstances were\
    \ inexplicable. He had a vague memory of toppling from the deck of a barquentine,\
    \ but could not recall what he was doing aboard the boat in the first place. Nor\
    \ did he remember how he came to be washed up on a barren sea-girt rock. But there\
    \ he was, and he had to lump it.\nAs a mostly deskbound pamphleteer, Dobson had\
    \ never found cause to undergo rigorous training in basic survival skills, so\
    \ the first few minutes on the atoll were emotionally wrenching, to say the least.\
    \ In fact Dobson could not recall such an emotionally wrenching experience since\
    \ he had attended a performance of Binder's third symphony. The conductor on that\
    \ occasion was the psychotic maestro Lothar Preen, and his approach to that piccolo\
    \ and glockenspiel business in the final movement caused in Dobson the welling\
    \ up of the most wrenching emotional experience he had ever had. He remembered\
    \ the music as he sat slumped on the atoll, staring at the sea, though the sound\
    \ in his head was of an LP recording conducted by Binder himself, where the piccolos\
    \ and glockenspiel were slightly less emotionally wrenching than in Preen's hands.\
    \ Dobson was not overly fond of what he considered Binder's somewhat clinical\
    \ treatment of his own symphony. He once wrote an intemperate letter to the composer,\
    \ insisting that he rerecord all the LPs of his music with more oomph, but tore\
    \ it up before sending it, not from second thoughts but because he did not have\
    \ Binder's postal address and did not at the time have the energy or wherewithal\
    \ to hunt it down.\nEnergy and wherewithal, however, were precisely what he needed\
    \ to call upon if he were to survive his maroonment on a remote atoll, and to\
    \ his credit Dobson did not shilly-shally. His first thought was of food, and\
    \ then of water, and then of shelter. It was almost as if he had undergone rigorous\
    \ training in basic survival skills! He wondered briefly if he had attended a\
    \ course of instruction in a dream. Dobson often had vivid dreams, and wrote down\
    \ the details upon waking. He fossicked in the pockets of his overcoat for his\
    \ notebook, thinking that perhaps he might find a list of hints and tips on basic\
    \ survival skills scribbled down one dawn before the dream faded. As he rummaged,\
    \ his fingers fell upon something unfamiliar, and taking it from his pocket he\
    \ found he was clutching a packet of frozen crinkle-cut oven chips.\nThe food\
    \ problem, then, was solved, at least for the time being. Or so Dobson thought.\
    \ He could either suck the chips as he would ice lollies, or he could lay them\
    \ out on the atoll and let them thaw in the sunlight. Stupidly, he decided on\
    \ the latter. No sooner had he torn open the packet and laid the frozen chips\
    \ out in neat rows upon the barren rock than a formidable flock of seagulls came\
    \ swooping out of the sky and snatched up every single chip in their terrible\
    \ beaks. Thus Dobson experienced a third wrenching of the emotions, perhaps the\
    \ most emotionally wrenching to date. Such was its intensity that Dobson leapt\
    \ to his feet and shook his fist at the sky and screamed his head off at the seagulls.\
    \ But the seagulls had already flown far far away, perhaps to another atoll, where\
    \ they would perch awhile and scoff their crinkle-cut chips. Seagulls will eat\
    \ anything.\nA little sprite within Dobson's head told him that he was wasting\
    \ his energy, so he sat down and gazed about him. This was when he noticed that\
    \ there were various creatures, such as barnacles and limpets and mussels, clinging\
    \ to the rock. They were not frozen and did not need thawing. He wrote the word\
    \ \u201CFood\u201D in his notebook and placed a tick next to it.\nDobson had read\
    \ a number of books about atoll maroonment, and it was the memory of these he\
    \ now drew upon. He could collect rainwater in his upturned hat, for example.\
    \ It was not raining, but Dobson was wearing a yachting cap, so he took this off\
    \ and placed it, upside down, on as level a patch of rock as he could find. As\
    \ he did so, he felt a pang of great perplexity, for he could not remember ever\
    \ seeing the yachting cap before. How had he come to be wearing it? It must be\
    \ connected in some way to the barquentine from which he had a vague recollection\
    \ of having toppled into the sea. It was not the sort of headgear he would normally\
    \ choose to wear. He was a Homburg man through and through, except for those occasions\
    \ when he sported a floppy and shapeless thingummy or a battered leaden crown.\
    \ But stylish or not, the yachting cap would catch rainwater, if and when rain\
    \ fell. Dobson looked up at the sky, and saw a cloud. It was quite white, and\
    \ very high above him. It only bloomed for minutes, and when he looked up again,\
    \ it vanished on the air. He took his notebook, wrote the word \u201CWater\u201D\
    , and placed a question mark next to it.\nThe last item on his agenda was shelter.\
    \ It was a particularly wrenching emotional moment when he admitted to himself\
    \ that there was no sign either of foliage or of a tatty tarpaulin abandoned by\
    \ a previous maroonee. Dobson was at the mercy of the elements. He thought of\
    \ that passage in Binder's tenth symphony when the four elements are evoked by\
    \ mordant bassoon toots, and he began to weep.\nThen he remembered something else\
    \ he had read in one of those books, that always, sooner or later, a ship full\
    \ of Jesuits would appear, and one need only dance and hop like a mad thing, waving\
    \ one's arms, and they would sail in to the rescue. Or perhaps it was the Jesuit\
    \ who was marooned, and the ship's crew were just ordinary sailors. Whichever\
    \ way round it was, the dancing and hopping and waving was the important thing.\
    \ And so he practised those disciplines, with great vim and vigour, while munching\
    \ thirstily on barnacles, until a ship hove into view on the horizon. It was the\
    \ HMS Gerard Manley Hopkins, and it took him home at last."
