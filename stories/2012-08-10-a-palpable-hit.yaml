  text: 'We last heard from the inexplicably obscure band Unit with their splendid
    instrumental entitled Little Severin, The Mystic Badger. Whoever they are, they
    have now excelled themselves and created what, in a sensible world, would be a
    chart-topping hit. 201 Birds marries a recording of Mr Key spouting the names
    of birds from an old Hooting Yard On The Air show with the actual sounds of birds.
    It is a most remarkable work, and I recommend you listen to it, over and over
    again, every day, until the cows come home.
