  text: "We last heard from the inexplicably obscure band Unit with their splendid\
    \ instrumental entitled Little Severin, The Mystic Badger. Whoever they are, they\
    \ have now excelled themselves and created what, in a sensible world, would be\
    \ a chart-topping hit. 201 Birds marries a recording of Mr Key spouting the names\
    \ of birds from an old Hooting Yard On The Air show with the actual sounds of\
    \ birds. It is a most remarkable work, and I recommend you listen to it, over\
    \ and over again, every day, until the cows come home.\n UNIT & Frank Key--201\
    \ Birds "
