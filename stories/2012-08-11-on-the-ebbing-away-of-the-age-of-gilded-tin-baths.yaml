  text: "[The vacancy between my ears shows no sign of being filled, so here is another\
    \ blast from the past (February 2007).]\nThere is no one left alive who witnessed\
    \ the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin baths, nor do we have any written records\
    \ of that time. The pitiful smidgen of information we do have has come down to\
    \ us in the form of incomprehensible pictograms and a pair of 78 rpm shellac discs,\
    \ and these are locked away in a concrete bunker far, far underground, beneath\
    \ the Museum At-Or-Near Ack. The bunker is only accessible through a heavily padlocked\
    \ orrin hatch, one of very few such hatches ever manufactured, based upon a patented\
    \ hatch design which, despite what you may have read in the sorts of magazines\
    \ beloved of the conspiracy-fixated, has absolutely no connection with US Senator\
    \ Orrin Hatch (Rep., Utah).\nThose of you with even a smattering of knowledge\
    \ about hatches and bunkers will understand how hard it is to get anywhere near\
    \ those pictograms, those 78s. When last one of our investigators examined the\
    \ hatch, she reported back that it showed no signs of having been opened since\
    \ the notorious Bl\xF6tzmann\_Incident (1956). The reckless idiocy of Bl\xF6tzmann's\
    \ intervention has been thoroughly dissected in Pebblehead's bestselling paperback\
    \ A Man And His Shovels, so I need not rehearse it here.\nOur investigator\u2014\
    codename Hortense\u2014reported something else. She said that the metal ladder\
    \ which forms the final stage of the approach to the bunker was rife with scratches\
    \ and dents and had buckled in a few places. This is new. The ladder has until\
    \ now been kept in pristine condition by the maintenance team at-or-near Ack,\
    \ whose rigorous training is well-attested. Hortense was unable to posit a convincing\
    \ explanation for the ladder damage, and for the time being the file has been\
    \ put aside. When I say \u2018aside\u2019, I mean literally that, placed on the\
    \ right hand side of my desk, next to the pot with the bonsai pugton and the framed\
    \ photograph of Bing Crosby embracing a howler monkey. Had I classed it as an\
    \ \u2018active\u2019 file, it would be in the wire tray on the left hand side,\
    \ alongside my important stationery, buzzer, message funnel, and metal tapping\
    \ machine. The area of the desk immediately in front of me is kept bare, so I\
    \ can think clearly. I know this sounds as if I have fallen victim to the fad\
    \ for feng shui, but that is not the case. In fact I am minded to say that Mr\
    \ Crosby's howler monkey would benefit more from feng shui than I would. Incidentally,\
    \ you may have been told by some earnest nitwit that the correct pronunciation\
    \ of feng shui is \u2018fung shway\u2019. Not so. It is actually \u2018fong shoo\u2019\
    , or possibly \u2018fing shoy\u2019.\nWhat I was thinking clearly about at the\
    \ moment was not Hortense's report on the damaged metal ladder, but a more urgent\
    \ matter. That very morning the postie had brought me a package containing a miniature\
    \ shellac disc wrapped in greaseproof paper. There was also a letter, obviously\
    \ written by a mad person, claiming that the disc was a copy of one of the two\
    \ discs locked in the bunker, and that if I listened to it with care I would learn\
    \ many, many interesting things about the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin\
    \ baths.\nNow, you must understand that in all my years of service to the Commission\
    \ I have never heard even a whisper that such a copy existed. My first impulse\
    \ was to smash the shellac into smithereens, for I have a short fuse and am not\
    \ to be dallied with by poltroons. Wiser counsel was provided by Hortense, who\
    \ offered to listen to the tiny 78 on her Mikiphone and to appraise its contents\
    \ with her unorthodox yet piercing intellect. I gave her the go-ahead and, as\
    \ I so often do, sat contemplating the blue eyes of Bing Crosby and the black\
    \ eyes of the howler monkey, pondering on the ineffable mysteries of existence.\n\
    I was snapped out of my reverie when Hortense came dashing breathlessly into my\
    \ sanctum, her face twisted into a rictus of Lovecraftian terror. Throughout my\
    \ life I have been plagued by nosebleeds, and the one that began to flow the instant\
    \ Hortense crashed in was the big potato, as they say. I was far too busy flapping\
    \ around trying to find a cloth to staunch the gore pouring out of my nose to\
    \ listen to my investigator's gibbering. By the time I had recovered myself, Hortense\
    \ had swooned, and in so doing, she banged her head, causing\u2014as we later\
    \ discovered\u2014complete memory loss. She never did remember what she heard\
    \ on that shellac disc, and nor was she able to recall at which railway station\
    \ she had rented a luggage locker in which to put the disc for safe keeping. I\
    \ remonstrated with her, of course, but with a faint heart, for despite my ferocious\
    \ temper I am a complete softy in the presence of amnesiacs.\nSo now I sit at\
    \ my desk looking into the eyes of the crooner and the howler, and Hortense reclines\
    \ on a sofa somewhere far away, having her brain massaged by nuns. The truth is,\
    \ she was the only investigator I had, all the others having been taken from me\
    \ by the blithering fatheads upstairs. And now Hortense is gone, and Hortense's\
    \ memory is gone, and I wonder if the ebbing away of the age of gilded tin baths\
    \ is also gone, irretrievably, vanishing into the past, its splendours never to\
    \ be rekindled in the minds of men and women in this baffling age of pap."
