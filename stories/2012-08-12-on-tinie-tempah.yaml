  text: "Long ago, on New Year's Day, I began this series of essays with a piece on\
    \ perpilocution, that is, the art of expounding upon a subject of which one knows\
    \ little or nothing. The original plan was to write, daily, about things of which\
    \ I was wholly ignorant. I have veered away from this intention more often than\
    \ not, but today I wish to return to it by devoting a thousand(ish) words to Tinie\
    \ Tempah.\nLet me begin by stating what I do know about Mr Tempah. (1) He is some\
    \ kind of musical turn, (2) he is apparently due to perform in tonight's Olympic\
    \ Games Closing Ceremony, and (3) he cannot, or chooses not to, spell his name\
    \ correctly.\nIn the latter case it is difficult to know if the misspelling is\
    \ deliberate or not. I assume Mr Tempah is of an age where his teachers\u2019\
    \ best efforts went into bolstering his self-esteem and awareness of diversity\
    \ rather than in inculcating such minor matters as basic literacy.\nMy understanding\
    \ of the Closing Ceremony is that it will feature \u201Ca celebration of British\
    \ music\u201D, which presumably explains Mr Tempah's involvement. I would have\
    \ thought Purcell, Elgar, Delius and the glorious Benjamin Britten would have\
    \ provided the proper content for such a celebration, but what do I know? I am\
    \ just a reactionary old fuddy-duddy. I fear our friend Tinie may be a \u201C\
    rapper\u201D, and my spirits sink, for rap of course is not music, nor poetry,\
    \ but barbarism. You can quote me on that, should you wish to.\nAnd what of Tinie\
    \ Tempah himself? Is he tiny? Does he have a temper? I have no idea of the correct\
    \ answer to either of those questions. I find myself trying to gain an idea of\
    \ him, and turn to The New Republic (1877) by W H Mallock, in which the art critic\
    \ Walter Pater appears in the guise of Mr Rose:\na pale creature, with large moustache,\
    \ looking out of the window at the sunset . . . he always speaks in an undertone,\
    \ and his two topics are self-indulgence and art.\nThis, I suggest, might almost\
    \ be the Anti-Tinie Tempah of my imagination. \u201CAlmost\u201D, because the\
    \ actual Tinie probably does babble on about self-indulgence.\n\nWalter Pater\_\
    : The Anti-Tinie Tempah\nIt is also possible that Tinie Tempah could look out\
    \ of the window at the sunset, but his ability to do so rather depends on just\
    \ how tiny he is. If he is a dwarf or a midget I suppose the aid of a stool or\
    \ some cushions would suffice, but perhaps he is tinier than that. He may be as\
    \ tiny as a homunculus, in which case he would have to be placed on the windowsill,\
    \ or be furnished with a little ladder to enable him to clamber up to the windowsill\
    \ of his own accord.\nI have to say that the idea of an ill-tempered homunculus\
    \ is a rather frightening one, something from a child's nightmare. Have the organisers\
    \ of the Closing Ceremony thought about that? I suppose the sting of terror might\
    \ be drawn by having Tinie perch on the shoulder of an affable buffoon like Boris\
    \ Johnson, who will no doubt also be on the bill. Mr Johnson might drown out the\
    \ high-pitched bad-tempered shrieking of Mr Tempah by intoning some Latin at him,\
    \ which would provide an amusing double act.\nWithout knowing for sure how tiny\
    \ Tinie is, it is hard to envisage him as a child, in other words as tiny Tinie\
    \ Tempah. He must have been a mere speck, almost invisible. Perhaps that is how\
    \ his temper developed. He would be wailing and screeching for his porridge or\
    \ his fluffy toy rabbit, and Mr Tempah senior and Mrs Tempah would be gazing around\
    \ in search for him, wondering where on earth he was. That kind of thing happening\
    \ day after day would curdle even the most equable tot's temperament. I suspect\
    \ eventually his parents resolved to keep him in one particular place, such as\
    \ the windowsill, which is where he would have learned the habit of staring at\
    \ the sunset. But they clearly left it too late to curb his temper.\nThe misspelling\
    \ of his name leads to an alternative possibility. It may be that Tinie does not\
    \ mean tiny at all, but tinny. Perhaps Mr Tempah is a fully-grown average-sized\
    \ person who does not need to be hoisted on to a windowsill in order to stare\
    \ at the sunset. He may give vent to his temper by bashing tins. If so, this might\
    \ be quite a refreshing element of the Closing Ceremony. Much as I am of the view\
    \ that a celebration of British music could happily be confined to Purcell and\
    \ Elgar and Delius and Britten, I am not averse to a bit of improv percussive\
    \ racket. If Tinie Tempah is indeed Tinny Temper, then I shall look forward to\
    \ his tin-bashing, if he promises to keep his gob shut and refrain from the rappy\
    \ stuff.\nThere is always the possibility that there could be a last minute change\
    \ to the Ceremony. The music, whatever music\u2014or barbarity\u2014it is, could\
    \ be ditched altogether. Instead Boris Johnson could stand on a dais, perhaps\
    \ with a glistening wet otter draped around his shoulders, and read passages such\
    \ as this, from G K Chesterton:\nA man loves Nature in the morning for her innocence\
    \ and amiability, and at nightfall, if he is loving her still, it is for her darkness\
    \ and her cruelty. He washes at dawn in clear water as did the Wise Men of the\
    \ Stoics, yet, somehow at the dark end of the day, he is bathing in hot bulls\u2019\
    \ blood, as did Julian the Apostate.\nI suspect Tinie Tempah, too, bathes in hot\
    \ bulls\u2019 blood, though I have no evidence that this is so."
