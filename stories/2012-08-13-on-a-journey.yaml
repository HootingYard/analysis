  text: 'Before we leave the Olympic Games behind, I must get something off my chest.
    I found myself aghast at the number of athletes who, when interviewed after their
    triumph--or failure--spoke of the "journey" they had been on. This journey was
    usually described as either amazing or incredible, or both. It is a similar, or
    identical, journey to the one apparently undertaken by just about anybody who
    appears in any kind of televised contest, be it a "talent" show or one of those
    weird programmes where they lock people up in a house for a few weeks. Somewhat
    terrifyingly, it is also the title of Tony Blair''s memoir.

    What we are supposed to understand from all this guff is that the speaker has
    been on a journey of self-discovery. As John Lydon put it in Public Image, "I''m
    not the same as when I began". No doubt this is true, if not for brain-dead television
    show contestants, certainly for Olympic athletes. What is profoundly depressing
    is that they all reach for precisely the same metaphor, automatically. It is not
    that I expect profundity, exactly, especially when the athlete is quizzed while
    still puffing and panting fresh from the running track or swimming pool. But there
    were times when I thought the BBC might have used a generic puffing-and-panting
    cardboard cutout for all the interviews, because they all said exactly the same
    thing. The questions were pretty witless, but why did they all--unprompted--blather
    about their incredible/amazing "journey"?

    Our medallists would do well to listen, as I have done, to an old tape-recording
    of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. It was made in the days before television,
    of course, and before round-the-clock news and mass media attention. The interviewer
    was a hack from a local newspaper, and the race fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol
    had just won was the second heat of a qualifier for the quarter finals of the
    Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree ten mile dash. You will
    note that nowhere does the fictional champ mention a "journey".

    Hack - Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, you''ve just won the second heat qualifier
    for the quarter finals of the Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree
    ten mile dash. Congratulations!

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol--Puff. Pant.

    Hack--It was a tremendous race. How do you feel, having won it?

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol - Puffed out and faintly nauseous.

    Hack--For a moment there on the sixteenth lap when your laces came undone things
    looked decidedly calamitous.

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol--I would agree. But this was an occurrence I had
    been through with my coach, the all too real Old Halob. He drummed into me the
    need to stop, kneel down, retie my laces, give them a little tug to ensure they
    were sufficiently tight, and then stand up and start running again, but faster
    than I had been running before the calamity.

    Hack--A lesson it seems you learned well.

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol--Indeed so. As I say, we went through it time and
    time again during my rigorous training sprints, usually before dawn, across the
    moors, pursued by packs of wolves and other savage and speedy creatures Old Halob
    keeps caged and half-starved and then releases to chase me across the moors before
    dawn with chunks of raw meat tied to my heels as part of my rigorous training
    sprints in preparation for races such as this one which I have just won.

    Hack--What are the other savage and speedy creatures, other than wolves?

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol - It depends on what Old Halob can procure from
    the local menagerie. Yapping dogs, gazelles, stoats . . .

    Hack--And which cuts of meat are tied to your heels?

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol--That is between Old Halob and his favourite butcher.

    Hack--I am sure the readers of the Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves
    Jamboree Annual Newsletter And Recipe Leaflet would be fascinated to know who
    that butcher is.

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol--Old Halob would probably tell you if you paid
    him a stipend.

    Hack--I might just do that. Where can I find him?

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol--As I crossed the finishing line in front of the
    other runners--sorry, I mean runner--I think I saw him trudging off towards that
    kiosk over there to buy a carton of cigarettes. If you run a bit faster than I
    was running just now you might catch up with him before he heads off to the owl
    sanctuary to indulge in his usual post-race activity of communing with owls while
    smoking heavily.

    Hack--Righty-ho! Well done again, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol!

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol--Thank you, hack. Now I must do several laps of
    honour before sprinting off across the moors pursued by packs of wolves and other
    savage and speedy creatures with chunks of raw meat tied to my heels as part of
    my rigorous training regime.

    What strikes us about this scratchy and hissy old magnetic tape-recording is the
    complete absence of the words amazing and incredible and, indeed, journey. It
    is worth noting, too, that as far as we can tell fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol
    sheds no tears, and indeed does not even seem to be welling up. It is of course
    possible that he began sobbing as soon as the hack set off in pursuit of Old Halob,
    but spectacularly unlikely.

    The tape continues, and we hear the hack hailing Old Halob somewhere between the
    cigarette kiosk and the owl sanctuary. His hailing is followed by a series of
    thumps, which acoustic analysis suggests are the sound of a catarrh-racked irascible
    athletics coach''s fist repeatedly meeting the jaw of a hack employed by the Blister
    Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree Annual Newsletter And Recipe Leaflet.
    There is then the sound of various owls hooting.'
