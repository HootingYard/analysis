  text: "Before we leave the Olympic Games behind, I must get something off my chest.\
    \ I found myself aghast at the number of athletes who, when interviewed after\
    \ their triumph\u2014or failure\u2014spoke of the \u201Cjourney\u201D they had\
    \ been on. This journey was usually described as either amazing or incredible,\
    \ or both. It is a similar, or identical, journey to the one apparently undertaken\
    \ by just about anybody who appears in any kind of televised contest, be it a\
    \ \u201Ctalent\u201D show or one of those weird programmes where they lock people\
    \ up in a house for a few weeks. Somewhat terrifyingly, it is also the title of\
    \ Tony Blair's memoir.\nWhat we are supposed to understand from all this guff\
    \ is that the speaker has been on a journey of self-discovery. As John Lydon put\
    \ it in Public Image, \u201CI'm not the same as when I began\u201D. No doubt this\
    \ is true, if not for brain-dead television show contestants, certainly for Olympic\
    \ athletes. What is profoundly depressing is that they all reach for precisely\
    \ the same metaphor, automatically. It is not that I expect profundity, exactly,\
    \ especially when the athlete is quizzed while still puffing and panting fresh\
    \ from the running track or swimming pool. But there were times when I thought\
    \ the BBC might have used a generic puffing-and-panting cardboard cutout for all\
    \ the interviews, because they all said exactly the same thing. The questions\
    \ were pretty witless, but why did they all\u2014unprompted\u2014blather about\
    \ their incredible/amazing \u201Cjourney\u201D?\nOur medallists would do well\
    \ to listen, as I have done, to an old tape-recording of fictional athlete Bobnit\
    \ Tivol. It was made in the days before television, of course, and before round-the-clock\
    \ news and mass media attention. The interviewer was a hack from a local newspaper,\
    \ and the race fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol had just won was the second heat\
    \ of a qualifier for the quarter finals of the Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics\
    \ Reserves Jamboree ten mile dash. You will note that nowhere does the fictional\
    \ champ mention a \u201Cjourney\u201D.\nHack \u2013 Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol,\
    \ you've just won the second heat qualifier for the quarter finals of the Blister\
    \ Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree ten mile dash. Congratulations!\n\
    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014Puff. Pant.\nHack\u2014It was a tremendous\
    \ race. How do you feel, having won it?\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol \u2013\
    \ Puffed out and faintly nauseous.\nHack\u2014For a moment there on the sixteenth\
    \ lap when your laces came undone things looked decidedly calamitous.\nFictional\
    \ athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014I would agree. But this was an occurrence I had been\
    \ through with my coach, the all too real Old Halob. He drummed into me the need\
    \ to stop, kneel down, retie my laces, give them a little tug to ensure they were\
    \ sufficiently tight, and then stand up and start running again, but faster than\
    \ I had been running before the calamity.\nHack\u2014A lesson it seems you learned\
    \ well.\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014Indeed so. As I say, we went through\
    \ it time and time again during my rigorous training sprints, usually before dawn,\
    \ across the moors, pursued by packs of wolves and other savage and speedy creatures\
    \ Old Halob keeps caged and half-starved and then releases to chase me across\
    \ the moors before dawn with chunks of raw meat tied to my heels as part of my\
    \ rigorous training sprints in preparation for races such as this one which I\
    \ have just won.\nHack\u2014What are the other savage and speedy creatures, other\
    \ than wolves?\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol \u2013 It depends on what Old Halob\
    \ can procure from the local menagerie. Yapping dogs, gazelles, stoats . . .\n\
    Hack\u2014And which cuts of meat are tied to your heels?\nFictional athlete Bobnit\
    \ Tivol\u2014That is between Old Halob and his favourite butcher.\nHack\u2014\
    I am sure the readers of the Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics Reserves Jamboree\
    \ Annual Newsletter And Recipe Leaflet would be fascinated to know who that butcher\
    \ is.\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014Old Halob would probably tell you if\
    \ you paid him a stipend.\nHack\u2014I might just do that. Where can I find him?\n\
    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014As I crossed the finishing line in front of\
    \ the other runners\u2014sorry, I mean runner\u2014I think I saw him trudging\
    \ off towards that kiosk over there to buy a carton of cigarettes. If you run\
    \ a bit faster than I was running just now you might catch up with him before\
    \ he heads off to the owl sanctuary to indulge in his usual post-race activity\
    \ of communing with owls while smoking heavily.\nHack\u2014Righty-ho! Well done\
    \ again, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol!\nFictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\u2014\
    Thank you, hack. Now I must do several laps of honour before sprinting off across\
    \ the moors pursued by packs of wolves and other savage and speedy creatures with\
    \ chunks of raw meat tied to my heels as part of my rigorous training regime.\n\
    What strikes us about this scratchy and hissy old magnetic tape-recording is the\
    \ complete absence of the words amazing and incredible and, indeed, journey. It\
    \ is worth noting, too, that as far as we can tell fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\
    \ sheds no tears, and indeed does not even seem to be welling up. It is of course\
    \ possible that he began sobbing as soon as the hack set off in pursuit of Old\
    \ Halob, but spectacularly unlikely.\nThe tape continues, and we hear the hack\
    \ hailing Old Halob somewhere between the cigarette kiosk and the owl sanctuary.\
    \ His hailing is followed by a series of thumps, which acoustic analysis suggests\
    \ are the sound of a catarrh-racked irascible athletics coach's fist repeatedly\
    \ meeting the jaw of a hack employed by the Blister Lane Bypass Amateur Athletics\
    \ Reserves Jamboree Annual Newsletter And Recipe Leaflet. There is then the sound\
    \ of various owls hooting."
