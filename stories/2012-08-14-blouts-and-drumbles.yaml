  text: 'Having listed some of the "heady confect" of words revived in his poetry
    by Wallace Stevens, Roger Kimball turns to W H Auden and finds

    Auden often remarked on his fondness for the Oxford English Dictionary. In later
    life, it provided some of his favourite reading matter and indeed was the source
    of many of the lexical curiosities that--increasingly--bedizened his poetry .
    . . In a review of Epistle To A Godson (1972), one critic lists "blouts, pirries,
    stolchy, glunch, sloomy, snudge, snoachy, scaddle, cagmag, hoasting, drumbles",
    among others. How many do you know?

    From The Permanent Auden by Roger Kimball, collected in Experiments Against Reality
    (2000).
