  text: "In an appreciative review of the second, expanded edition of Harmonium (1931),\
    \ R P Blackmur remarked that \u201Cthe most striking if not the most important\
    \ thing\u201D about Stevens's verse was its vocabulary, a heady confect including\
    \ such rarities as \u201Cfubbed\u201D, \u201Cgirandoles\u201D, \u201Cdiaphanes\u201D\
    , \u201Cpannicles\u201D, \u201Ccarked\u201D, \u201Cructive\u201D, \u201Ccantilene\u201D\
    , \u201Cfiscs\u201D, and \u201Cprincox\u201D.\nFrom Wallace Stevens\_: Metaphysical\
    \ Claims Adjuster by Roger Kimball, collected in Experiments Against Reality (2000)\n"
