  text: 'In an appreciative review of the second, expanded edition of Harmonium (1931),
    R P Blackmur remarked that "the most striking if not the most important thing"
    about Stevens''s verse was its vocabulary, a heady confect including such rarities
    as "fubbed", "girandoles", "diaphanes", "pannicles", "carked", "ructive", "cantilene",
    "fiscs", and "princox".

    From Wallace Stevens : Metaphysical Claims Adjuster by Roger Kimball, collected
    in Experiments Against Reality (2000)
