  text: "In ages past, God was our help. He was also thought to be our hope for years\
    \ to come, our shelter from the stormy blast, and our eternal home. More recently,\
    \ we were told that He was a concept by which we measure our pain. I'll say that\
    \ again. We were told that God was a concept by which we measure our pain. We\
    \ were told this, however, by a drug-bedizened whiny-voiced Liverpudlian who told\
    \ us many other things, such as that he was a walrus sitting on a cornflake. I\
    \ think we can safely discard his witterings.\nIn Russian, God is known as Bog.\
    \ It is well worth knowing this preparatory to reading any abstruse theological\
    \ texts you may be tempted to tackle. For example, you might pluck from the shelf\
    \ a fat tome the title of which promises to tell you all about God, when in fact\
    \ it is a geographical survey of certain bogs. Conversely, if it so happens that\
    \ you want to read up on bogs, you may become brain-dizzy trying to plough your\
    \ way through the ineffable. Very few, if any, bogs are ineffable. They are, rather,\
    \ a brute reality, an assertion you can easily test by donning a pair of wellington\
    \ boots and trudging into one.\nCan one, similarly, trudge into God? The answer\
    \ to that, surprisingly, is \"Yes!\", at least if we accept the argument of Digby\
    \ Thew's new paperback Trudging Into God. The esteemed geographer claims he did\
    \ just that, a couple of years ago, while out on a hike. Though I have just noticed\
    \ that the copy of the book sent to me for review is a translation from the Russian,\
    \ and it may be one of those slapdash translations we hear so much about in the\
    \ online journal Slapdash Translations & Confusion Regarding Theology And Geography.\
    \ Incidentally, if you have never visited the site, I recommend it highly, though\
    \ I know how difficult it can be to tear yourself away from Hooting Yard. I must\
    \ say I wondered what Digby Thew was doing writing a book about God, when all\
    \ his previously published works have been on the subject of bogs, ditches, puddles,\
    \ marshes, mires, swamps, and other muddy wet places dotted about the earth.\n\
    God is to be found in such places, of course, for He is ubiquitous. Or almost\
    \ ubiquitous. Let us not forget that there are quite a few so-called godforsaken\
    \ places, certain dilapidated and ill-starred seaside resorts, from which God\
    \ has fled. The poet Dennis Beerpint has been called the laureate of godforsaken\
    \ seaside resorts, deservedly so, for penning lines such as:\nI stood, at dawn,\
    \ upon the collapsing pier\n    And I gave Lord God a flea in his ear\n    I shouted\
    \ wild blasphemies at the sky\n    Upon the collapsing pier at Exe-on-Wye\nExe-on-Wye\
    \ is a sort of generic dilapidated and godforsaken seaside resort invented by\
    \ Beerpint, or possibly nicked from Vivian Darkbloom. It is based on the real\
    \ resort of Innsmouth, which, oddly, is a town of no fewer than eleven churches.\
    \ All of them are of course in various states of ruin, populated by bats and owls\
    \ and crows rather than by the pious faithful.\nNeither bats nor owls nor crows\
    \ have need of God, save for their creation, but God Himself often assumes the\
    \ corporeal form of a bat or an owl or a crow. One of my favourite Gods is the\
    \ crow-God Cark! (always spelled with an exclamation mark), worshipped by the\
    \ tinies at Pang Hill Orphanage. Some would hold that Cark! himself is a blasphemy,\
    \ and in no way related to the real God Almighty, Lord of Hosts, but if ever you\
    \ have witnessed the orphanage tinies trembling and bowing down in veneration\
    \ of him you will almost certainly have trembled and bowed down in veneration\
    \ on your own account, for truly he is fearsome and his fury is as the sort of\
    \ stormy blast that God our help in ages past provides shelter from. I am tying\
    \ myself in theological knots.\nThat is the thing with theology, it is so difficult\
    \ to get a proper grasp of it. No doubt Digby Thew considered this when deciding\
    \ whether to devote himself to the study of God or the study of bogs.\n\"What\
    \ is it to be, young Digby?\" asked his pedagogue when Digby Thew was young, \"\
    God or bogs?\"\nLuckily, young Digby did not know Russian, or he might have become\
    \ hopelessly confused. As it was, he was uncertain which choice to make, and so\
    \ he spent forty days and nights in the wilderness wrestling with his soul. It\
    \ was the sort of outdoor activity encouraged by the institution where he received\
    \ his education. Legend has it that God appeared to Digby Thew on his thirty-ninth\
    \ night in the wilderness, though what passed between them is unknown. It is surely\
    \ pertinent that the part of the wilderness where Digby Thew spent his time was\
    \ a bog-riddled wilderness, though it was also rife with bats and owls and crows.\
    \ It was also near the seaside.\nAs John Lydon among others has pointed out, God\
    \ spelled backwards is dog. It is hard to think of a being less like God than\
    \ a dog, especially one of those small yappy ones. Thereagain, we have it on good\
    \ authority that God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform, so who knows\
    \ if that dismal little dog yapping at one's heels as one trudges o'er the moors\
    \ towards the marshes and the bogs is not God Himself? There might be a divine\
    \ message in the yapping, if only one could decipher it. On the other hand, if\
    \ one did devote time and energy and one's very sanity to translating the yaps\
    \ into coherent sentences, and the dog turned out to be just a dog, and no God\
    \ at all, one would be a benighted fool.\nBeing a fool is of course no barrier\
    \ to approaching God. Quite the opposite, if we are to believe some theologians.\
    \ And of course the Holy Fool, the idiot peasant of mysterious sanctity, is a\
    \ staple character of Mother Russia. Which brings us back to Bog, which, spelled\
    \ backwards, is not dog but gob. Do you know what I am going to do now? I am going\
    \ to shut my gob."
