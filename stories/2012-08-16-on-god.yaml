  text: "In ages past, God was our help. He was also thought to be our hope for years\
    \ to come, our shelter from the stormy blast, and our eternal home. More recently,\
    \ we were told that He was a concept by which we measure our pain. I'll say that\
    \ again. We were told that God was a concept by which we measure our pain. We\
    \ were told this, however, by a drug-bedizened whiny-voiced Liverpudlian who told\
    \ us many other things, such as that he was a walrus sitting on a cornflake. I\
    \ think we can safely discard his witterings.\nIn Russian, God is known as Bog.\
    \ It is well worth knowing this preparatory to reading any abstruse theological\
    \ texts you may be tempted to tackle. For example, you might pluck from the shelf\
    \ a fat tome the title of which promises to tell you all about God, when in fact\
    \ it is a geographical survey of certain bogs. Conversely, if it so happens that\
    \ you want to read up on bogs, you may become brain-dizzy trying to plough your\
    \ way through the ineffable. Very few, if any, bogs are ineffable. They are, rather,\
    \ a brute reality, an assertion you can easily test by donning a pair of wellington\
    \ boots and trudging into one.\nCan one, similarly, trudge into God? The answer\
    \ to that, surprisingly, is \u201CYes!\u201D, at least if we accept the argument\
    \ of Digby Thew's new paperback Trudging Into God. The esteemed geographer claims\
    \ he did just that, a couple of years ago, while out on a hike. Though I have\
    \ just noticed that the copy of the book sent to me for review is a translation\
    \ from the Russian, and it may be one of those slapdash translations we hear so\
    \ much about in the online journal Slapdash Translations & Confusion Regarding\
    \ Theology And Geography. Incidentally, if you have never visited the site, I\
    \ recommend it highly, though I know how difficult it can be to tear yourself\
    \ away from Hooting Yard. I must say I wondered what Digby Thew was doing writing\
    \ a book about God, when all his previously published works have been on the subject\
    \ of bogs, ditches, puddles, marshes, mires, swamps, and other muddy wet places\
    \ dotted about the earth.\nGod is to be found in such places, of course, for He\
    \ is ubiquitous. Or almost ubiquitous. Let us not forget that there are quite\
    \ a few so-called godforsaken places, certain dilapidated and ill-starred seaside\
    \ resorts, from which God has fled. The poet Dennis Beerpint has been called the\
    \ laureate of godforsaken seaside resorts, deservedly so, for penning lines such\
    \ as:\nI stood, at dawn, upon the collapsing pier\n    And I gave Lord God a flea\
    \ in his ear\n    I shouted wild blasphemies at the sky\n    Upon the collapsing\
    \ pier at Exe-on-Wye\nExe-on-Wye is a sort of generic dilapidated and godforsaken\
    \ seaside resort invented by Beerpint, or possibly nicked from Vivian Darkbloom.\
    \ It is based on the real resort of Innsmouth, which, oddly, is a town of no fewer\
    \ than eleven churches. All of them are of course in various states of ruin, populated\
    \ by bats and owls and crows rather than by the pious faithful.\nNeither bats\
    \ nor owls nor crows have need of God, save for their creation, but God Himself\
    \ often assumes the corporeal form of a bat or an owl or a crow. One of my favourite\
    \ Gods is the crow-God Cark! (always spelled with an exclamation mark), worshipped\
    \ by the tinies at Pang Hill Orphanage. Some would hold that Cark! himself is\
    \ a blasphemy, and in no way related to the real God Almighty, Lord of Hosts,\
    \ but if ever you have witnessed the orphanage tinies trembling and bowing down\
    \ in veneration of him you will almost certainly have trembled and bowed down\
    \ in veneration on your own account, for truly he is fearsome and his fury is\
    \ as the sort of stormy blast that God our help in ages past provides shelter\
    \ from. I am tying myself in theological knots.\nThat is the thing with theology,\
    \ it is so difficult to get a proper grasp of it. No doubt Digby Thew considered\
    \ this when deciding whether to devote himself to the study of God or the study\
    \ of bogs.\n\u201CWhat is it to be, young Digby?\u201D asked his pedagogue when\
    \ Digby Thew was young, \u201CGod or bogs?\u201D\nLuckily, young Digby did not\
    \ know Russian, or he might have become hopelessly confused. As it was, he was\
    \ uncertain which choice to make, and so he spent forty days and nights in the\
    \ wilderness wrestling with his soul. It was the sort of outdoor activity encouraged\
    \ by the institution where he received his education. Legend has it that God appeared\
    \ to Digby Thew on his thirty-ninth night in the wilderness, though what passed\
    \ between them is unknown. It is surely pertinent that the part of the wilderness\
    \ where Digby Thew spent his time was a bog-riddled wilderness, though it was\
    \ also rife with bats and owls and crows. It was also near the seaside.\nAs John\
    \ Lydon among others has pointed out, God spelled backwards is dog. It is hard\
    \ to think of a being less like God than a dog, especially one of those small\
    \ yappy ones. Thereagain, we have it on good authority that God moves in mysterious\
    \ ways His wonders to perform, so who knows if that dismal little dog yapping\
    \ at one's heels as one trudges o'er the moors towards the marshes and the bogs\
    \ is not God Himself? There might be a divine message in the yapping, if only\
    \ one could decipher it. On the other hand, if one did devote time and energy\
    \ and one's very sanity to translating the yaps into coherent sentences, and the\
    \ dog turned out to be just a dog, and no God at all, one would be a benighted\
    \ fool.\nBeing a fool is of course no barrier to approaching God. Quite the opposite,\
    \ if we are to believe some theologians. And of course the Holy Fool,\_the idiot\
    \ peasant of mysterious sanctity, is a staple character of Mother Russia. Which\
    \ brings us back to Bog, which, spelled backwards, is not dog but gob. Do you\
    \ know what I am going to do now? I am going to shut my gob."
