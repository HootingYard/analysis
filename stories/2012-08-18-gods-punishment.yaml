  text: 'Last night on Channel 4 News, Jon Snow related that the Russian Orthodox
    Church had issued a statement regarding the Pussy Riot trio. "God has already
    punished them by depriving them of their common sense", it said, or words to that
    effect. (I cannot find a written reference.)

    The implications of this are immense, and I find in thinking them through that
    my brain is dizzied, and I too am being deprived of what common sense I might
    possess. Oh Lord, Oh Lord, why hast Thou forsaken me?'
