  text: "Gentlemen, you are now about to embark on a course of studies which will\
    \ occupy you for two years. Together, they form a noble adventure. But I would\
    \ like to remind you of an important point. Some of you, when you go down from\
    \ the University, will go into the Church, or to the Bar, or to the House of Commons,\
    \ or to the Home Civil Service, or to the Indian or Colonial Services, or into\
    \ various professions. Some may go into the Army, some into industry and commerce;\
    \ some may become country gentlemen. A few\u2014I hope a very few\u2014will become\
    \ teachers or dons. Let me make this clear to you. Except for those in the last\
    \ category, nothing that you will learn in the course of your studies will be\
    \ of the slightest possible use to you in after life\u2014save only this\u2014\
    that if you work hard and intelligently you should be able to detect when a man\
    \ is talking rot, and that, in my view, is the main, if not the sole, purpose\
    \ of education.\nJohn Alexander Smith, Waynflete Professor of Moral and Metaphysical\
    \ Philosophy at Oxford, introducing a series of lectures in 1914."
