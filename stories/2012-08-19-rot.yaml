  text: 'Gentlemen, you are now about to embark on a course of studies which will
    occupy you for two years. Together, they form a noble adventure. But I would like
    to remind you of an important point. Some of you, when you go down from the University,
    will go into the Church, or to the Bar, or to the House of Commons, or to the
    Home Civil Service, or to the Indian or Colonial Services, or into various professions.
    Some may go into the Army, some into industry and commerce; some may become country
    gentlemen. A few--I hope a very few--will become teachers or dons. Let me make
    this clear to you. Except for those in the last category, nothing that you will
    learn in the course of your studies will be of the slightest possible use to you
    in after life--save only this--that if you work hard and intelligently you should
    be able to detect when a man is talking rot, and that, in my view, is the main,
    if not the sole, purpose of education.

    John Alexander Smith, Waynflete Professor of Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy
    at Oxford, introducing a series of lectures in 1914.'
