  text: 'It is very close to inevitable, when you are problem-solving, that at some
    point you will hit a snag. Indeed, if you do not hit a snag, that calls into question
    whether what you are doing is actually solving a problem, rather than merely going
    about something you ought to be able to do blindfolded and with your hands tied
    behind your back. I do not mean that literally. I am trying to suggest an activity
    that is so familiar and comes so easily that to call it a problem is to do violence
    to the language. Going out to the newsagent to buy a copy of the Daily Hoo-Hah
    and a pint of milk, for example, ought not be a problem for most of us. So if
    that is your idea of problem-solving I think I would laugh in your face, or shove
    you aside, out of my sight.

    Having said that, I suppose it is true that even so simple and unproblematic an
    activity could be booby-trapped with a snag. You might trip over a clump of tough
    intractable weeds on your way to the newsagent, for example, and sprain your ankle,
    forcing you to hobble. Or you might arrive at the newsagent only to discover a
    hole in your pocket through which your coinage has fallen, and you have no money
    to pay for the newspaper and the milk. Or who knows what else? But these are properly
    accidents rather than snags, the kind of snags we bump up against when solving
    problems.

    The snag is, as it were, inherent in the problem. If there were no snag to negotiate,
    the matter might not be a problem at all, and we could just get on with it, and
    now I am repeating myself so I had better shut up about non-problems and concentrate
    on problems.

    To illustrate what I am talking about, or trying to talk about, let us take two
    different problems and consider what sort of snags might crop up.

    First, we could say that the most basic type of problem is a simple sum, 1 + 1,
    for example. This is the kind of problem with which we might be faced when attending
    infant school. We have to add 1 to 1 and come up with the correct answer. Simple
    as it is, this little sum might be dubbed the fons et origo of every other sum
    we might ever attempt, up to and including stupendously complicated calculations
    in the higher mathematics. It is, in a sense, the ur-sum. Not too many snags there,
    you might think. But hold on! What if, as an infant, sitting on the infant school
    bench with your slate and your pointy scraping tool, it is somehow vouchsafed
    to you that 1 + 1 is indeed the very basis of every other sum you might ever try
    to solve for as long as you live? That is a dizzying mental prospect! It is enough
    to befuddle the head of the more sensitive and imaginative infant. Hence the snag.
    The profound implications of 1 + 1, of all that it might later lead to, could
    provoke a sort of seizing up of the cranial integuments, a gibbering havoc of
    the brain. In other words, a snag.

    For our second example of a problem let us take something more concrete. Let us
    say you have embarked upon a project of building a tiny hydroelectric power station
    using balsa wood and glue and nanotechnology. Everything is going swimmingly,
    until you realise there is a mismatch between the diagrams on your blueprint and
    the amount of balsa wood in your box. You are at a loss to see how you might complete
    the construction until this anomaly is resolved. This, then, is the snag.

    It is clear, I hope, from these examples that neither problem is going to be solved
    successfully until the snags have been addressed. By addressed, I suppose I mean
    solved. So we can consider each snag like a little problem in itself. It is part
    of a bigger, overall problem, but the solution to that uber-problem depends entirely
    on the solution to the mini-problem. How, then, should one go about tackling the
    mini-problem, or snag? Here are some handy tips.

    1. Do not panic. (Actually, there are certain snags where panic is, if not the
    most sensible response, then certainly an understandable one. Imagine you have
    hit a snag in disarming a lethal explosive device, and the timer is ticking down
    to the last few precious seconds. In these circumstances, you might be better
    off panicking and running away as fast as your little legs will carry you.)

    2. Take several deep breaths.

    3. Scratch your head and furrow your brow. (Some people also like to let their
    tongue loll out.)

    4. Try to relax your overheated brain. (There are several ways of doing this.
    President Nixon mashed potatoes. Baruch Spinoza set a pair of spiders to fight
    each other in mortal combat.)

    5. Consider whether you really care enough to solve the problem at all. (This
    might sound defeatist, and it is, but you would be surprised at how often people
    get all hot and bothered about things that, in the long term, do not matter one
    jot.)

    6. Smack your forehead with your open palm and press on regardless. (This is the
    reckless option. Sometimes it works out for the best, sometimes it brings in its
    wake unparalleled disaster.)

    7. Consult an expert. (Somewhere in the world there is an expert in everything.
    The expert is the kind of person who will take one look at your snag, give a wry
    chuckle, and solve it, possibly while blindfolded and with their hands tied behind
    their back. Tracking down the right expert can of course become a problem, or
    snag, in itself, so what you should do as you make your progress through the world
    is to buttonhole every person you meet and interrogate them regarding their field(s)
    of expertise. Keep a note in your jotter, including their contact details. Later,
    at home, transfer the details from your jotter to a magnificent alphabetical and
    cross-referenced card index system.)

    Next week, we will take a look at pitfalls.'
