  text: "In a piece the other day entitled On Snitby, I mentioned in passing the computer\
    \ game Demented Virtual Needlework. Several readers have contacted me to ask for\
    \ further particulars. \u201CFurther particulars\u201D indeed. Well, I mean to\
    \ say! The absolute bloody nerve of some people! Some even demanded that I \u201C\
    furnish further and better particulars\u201D (my italics).\nThe sheer impertinence\
    \ of some of my readers is astonishing to behold. I get the impression that they\
    \ think I sit here, day in day out, tippy-tapping these teeming thousands of words\
    \ because I have nothing better to do, as if it's all the same to me whether I\
    \ prattle on about demented virtual needlework or Snitby or snags or jam tomorrow\
    \ or a thing of beauty or God or an impromptu dinner party recipe or fubbed pannicles\
    \ or Tinie Tempah or tin squirrels or an atoll or whatever else springs to mind,\
    \ so they need merely snap their fingers and say \u201Cdemented virtual needlework\u201D\
    \ and I'll jump to attention and salute and say \u201CRighty ho!\u201D and immediately\
    \ buckle down to bashing out a thousand words just to keep them happy. Well, it\
    \ doesn't quite work like that, buster. There's a method, and I stick to it, and\
    \ I shall not be swayed, so put that in your pipe and smoke it, as my father used\
    \ to say, though he was not a pipe smoker himself. As I recall he favoured Player's\
    \ No, 6, a particularly acrid cigarette to the best of my knowledge.\nBy which\
    \ I do not mean to suggest that all my readers are importunate rascals. Far from\
    \ it. Many of you, I know, would never dream of writing to demand that I provide\
    \ further and better particulars of anything under the sun. Even if you wished\
    \ it so, you would not have the gall to ask. You would rather sit sprawled in\
    \ your hovels patiently waiting to learn what is writ upon the tablets borne down\
    \ from the Hooting Yard mountain, pathetically grateful, like kicked dogs whimpering\
    \ for crumbs from the master's table.\nI need hardly add that there is not actually\
    \ a Hooting Yard mountain. I use the term figuratively. But if there were such\
    \ a mountain, as in an ideal world there would be, then it would be a mighty Alpine\
    \ peak, snow-dazzled, its summit invisible, lost in the clouds. And most importantly,\
    \ I would be the only one ever to set foot on that summit. You lot would be huddled\
    \ in your flimsy tents somewhere on the slopes, cooking sausages over a stove,\
    \ melting handfuls of snow into tin cups, tossing bones to the huskies. It may\
    \ be that I have muddled polar exploration with mountaineering in that happy image,\
    \ but that is my prerogative and you know better than to carp or cavil. At least\
    \ I hope you do. And I do not want to be asked to give further and better particulars\
    \ of that Antarctic or Alpine scene, or my wrath will be as terrible as an army\
    \ with banners. I would be like Benaiah in Samuel II, chapter 23, verse 20: \u201C\
    And Benaiah the son of Jehoidah, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had\
    \ done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab; he went down also and slew\
    \ a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow\u201D. Don't think I wouldn't.\n\
    Having said all that, I am aware that there are among my readers a few poor souls\
    \ who think it perfectly acceptable to spend their leisure time playing so-called\
    \ \u201Ccomputer games\u201D. Personally, I think they would be better off familiarising\
    \ themselves with the Old Testament or, if that is too much to ask, then they\
    \ could at the very least devote themselves to rereading the Hooting Yard Archives,\
    \ over and over and over again, until they can recite my complete works by heart,\
    \ word perfect, with every last nuance given its proper weight. That is a practical\
    \ use of anybody's time.\nBut I am, as you know, nothing if not a realist, so\
    \ I accept that some of you will want to muck about with your bleeping and buzzing\
    \ hand-held digital brain-sapping gewgaws, your iFads and whatnot. If you are\
    \ determined to shrivel your brain in such a fashion, then you might as well do\
    \ so with the absolutely tiptop game Demented Virtual Needlework. The basic idea\
    \ is that you can do frenzied embroidery without any risk whatsoever of pricking\
    \ yourself with small pointy metal things like needles and pins. How great is\
    \ that?\nWhen you start the game, by pressing some sort of knob on your device,\
    \ or tapping the screen, or whatever the latest thing is, you are presented with\
    \ a virtual \u201Cpiece of cloth\u201D, blank and featureless and whatever colour\
    \ you like, though the default setting is beige. Down one side of the screen are\
    \ various virtual metal pointy things, and on the other side various virtual skeins\
    \ of thread. You can mix and match these in numberless combinations, and then\
    \ the fun begins. You can make the most fantastic and insane needlework designs\
    \ and you will never need a thimble to protect your dainty fingertips!\nWe got\
    \ one of our unpaid and half-starved interns to test it out, and within a few\
    \ minutes the little orphan had \u201Cstitched\u201D a design that looked as if\
    \ a dog had been sick in a wind tunnel. We snatched the device away from the intern,\
    \ took a screen-shot, and were then able to use this as a pattern from which real\
    \ needleworkers, unpaid and half-starved and orphaned like the tester, were forced\
    \ to create some real embroidery, down in the dimly-lit and fetid cellar. Naturally\
    \ this was the occasion for much pin-pricking and droplets of blood and weeping,\
    \ but the end results were superb, and we were able to sell them at extortionate\
    \ prices at an unregulated bazaar. I think that is what they call, in the lamentable\
    \ parlance of the day, a \u201Cwin-win situation\u201D."
