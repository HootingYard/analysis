  text: 'We are never averse to a spot of unbridled Roman Catholic Mariolatry here
    at Hooting Yard, so here is a snap of the BVM. The provenance of this statue?
    Throughout my childhood, she stood in our back garden, in the shelter of a grotto,
    what you heathens would probably call a rockery. Truly it was like growing up
    in Lourdes, or the Essex council estate equivalent thereof. She later spent many
    years watching over my father''s grave in Ansdell Cemetery in Lancashire. Weatherbeaten
    and distressed, she returned south late in the last century, and has since resided
    safely indoors with Mr Key.
