  text: "I went for a morning trudge around Nameless Pond and, having completed a\
    \ circumnavigation, I sat on a bench for a breather. I lit a cigarette and contemplated\
    \ the ducks. Foolishly, I had left my iDuck at home, so I had no idea whether\
    \ I was contemplating teal or mergansers, or indeed quite other types of duck.\
    \ After some minutes, I was joined on the bench by an ancient and withered gent\
    \ whose approach I had not been aware of. He had an air of the shabby genteel\
    \ about him, and milky eyes.\n\u201CGood morning,\u201D he said, without looking\
    \ at me.\n\u201CHello,\u201D I replied, hoping that would be the extent of our\
    \ conversation. But no.\n\u201CI see you are contemplating the ducks on the pond,\u201D\
    \ he went on, \u201CAn activity to which I myself have devoted many hours over\
    \ the years. Many, many hours over many, many years, for as you can see I am ancient\
    \ and withered. I am almost as old as Methuselah. That is not a name you come\
    \ across very often nowadays, is it?\u201D He did not pause to allow a response.\
    \ \u201CIn fact I cannot think of a single Methuselah I have ever met, and I have\
    \ met an enormous number of people. I used to be quite a gadabout before the stiffness\
    \ and withering slowed me down. I gadded hither and thither and met people from\
    \ all walks of life, but never a Methuselah. Unless of course that is your name?\u201D\
    \n\u201CI'm afraid not,\u201D I said, \u201CI am Mr Key.\u201D\n\u201CI am very\
    \ pleased to meet you, Mr Key. I am Mr Creeke, C. C. Creeke. The funny thing is,\
    \ my parents never divulged what the Cs stand for, and my birth certificate was\
    \ rendered illegible in one of those overturned bleach bottle mishaps one occasionally\
    \ reads about in the popular press. My father was a musician and my mother was\
    \ a Marxist-Leninist, so I have long suspected that I was named after Cornelius\
    \ Cardew, the composer of 10,000 Nails In The Coffin Of Imperialism, among other\
    \ works, or possibly after Chris Cutler, the drummer and percussionist in Henry\
    \ Cow and roughly six hundred and forty-five other bands and combos and one-off\
    \ projects. Given my ancientness either may be chronologically dubious, as parental\
    \ choices, but the world is a very mysterious place, Mr Key, as I am sure you\
    \ have noticed.\u201D\nAgain he continued to babble on without awaiting any kind\
    \ of reply.\n\u201CIn a world of such mystery and bafflement it is well to have\
    \ at least one fixed point of clarity and order. I found it at Pang Hill Orphanage,\
    \ where for many years I was retained as the Inspector of Nuisances. I see you\
    \ are raising your eyebrows.\u201D\nI was not, and in any case he was still not\
    \ looking at me.\n\u201CIt surprises you to learn that any of the orphans at Pang\
    \ Hill could ever have been deemed nuisances. When would they ever have had the\
    \ time to be mischievous and pesky and scampish?, you wonder. Confined at night\
    \ to their iron cots, and in the daytime huddled in the cellar labouring away\
    \ by the dim light of a single Toc H lamp, betweentimes scoffing their gruel and\
    \ having compulsory singsongs and prostrating themselves before strange voodoo\
    \ idols and all the other activities of the orphanage day, they would surely have\
    \ been too exhausted to be nuisances. So you think. But believe me, Mr Key, when\
    \ I made my weekly visits, clanging my bell, there would be a parade of nuisances\
    \ whom it was my duty to inspect. And inspect them I did, with magnifying lenses\
    \ and calipers and measuring tape, and then I wrote my report for the beadle.\
    \ What became of my reports I never knew, and never asked. I had other things\
    \ on my plate.\n\u201CFor Pang Hill Orphanage and its nuisances demanded my attention\
    \ on only one day of the week. The rest of the time I was engaged on the first\
    \ ever survey of Pointy Town. I surveyed as many of the pointy bits as a man could\
    \ reasonably be expected to survey in one working lifetime. But whereas Pang Hill\
    \ was a fixed point of clarity and order, Pointy Town was quite the opposite.\
    \ Indeed, surveying all those pointy bits drove me crackers. There was no end\
    \ to them, nor any sense to them, and it wore me down, slowly but surely. That\
    \ is why I am now so withered. Oh, look! A pochard!\u201D\nAnd indeed, a pochard\
    \ had come dabbling close to the bank of the pond, so close I could have leaned\
    \ forward and grabbed it and wrung its neck, had I been so minded. But I have\
    \ put my duck-strangling days behind me. It was always a foolish and unpleasant\
    \ hobby.\nWhile my attention was on the pochard, C. C. Creeke vanished. I cannot\
    \ put it more plainly than that. Just as he had appeared on the bench without\
    \ my noticing his advent, so he left it. I looked around, wildly, but there was\
    \ no trace of him. I was baffled, but the world is indeed a very mysterious place.\n\
    It was time to go home. I got up and trudged on my way, and then I spotted, half\
    \ hidden in the sordid undergrowth beside the pond, a plinth. Brushing the nettles\
    \ aside, I read:\n\nThe foliage was too thickly entangled for me to discover what\
    \ was atop the plinth. And when I returned, the next day, armed with a pair of\
    \ secateurs, I was unable to find it again. I searched and searched, but eventually\
    \ I gave up, and sat on the bench, and smoked, and contemplated the ducks.\n[Thanks\
    \ to Outa_Spaceman for the snap,]"
