  text: 'It is increasingly apparent that the so-called "real world" edges closer
    to the even more real world of Hooting Yard with every passing day. On Thursday,
    I wrote about Ned Mossop, Cow Detective. Granted, this news item concerns goats
    rather than cows, but nevertheless it seems spookily like the kind of thing that
    might happen at Hooting Yard . . .


    Thanks to Elberry for drawing the clipping to my attention'
