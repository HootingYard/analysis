  text: "It is increasingly apparent that the so-called \u201Creal world\u201D edges\
    \ closer to the even more real world of Hooting Yard with every passing day. On\
    \ Thursday, I wrote about Ned Mossop, Cow Detective. Granted, this news item concerns\
    \ goats rather than cows, but nevertheless it seems spookily like the kind of\
    \ thing that might happen at Hooting Yard . . .\n\nThanks to Elberry for drawing\
    \ the clipping to my attention"
