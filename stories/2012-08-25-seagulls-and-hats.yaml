  text: "Daily Mail bashers like to trot out the newspaper's sympathetic line towards\
    \ the Nazis in the run-up to the Second World War. It seems to me that this is\
    \ now far too familiar a charge, and that if we are going to delve into history\
    \ to find sticks with which to beat the paper, some fresh snippet is long overdue.\
    \ I was pleased, therefore, to find this anecdote about Lord Northcliffe, the\
    \ founder of the Daily Mail, in Piers Brendon's Eminent Edwardians (1979):\nThe\
    \ campaigner against the use of birds\u2019 feathers to decorate women's hats\
    \ once wantonly struck down a seagull with his stick and beat it to death on the\
    \ sand.\nIncidentally, Northcliffe seems to have had a thing about hats. In 1910,\
    \ he issued a directive to his editorial staff:\nIt is about time men had a new\
    \ hat. Why not offer \xA3100 for the best design for a new hat? There is at present\
    \ only the silk hat, the pot-hat or bowler (what in America is called a Derby),\
    \ the straw hat, the felt hat of various shapes (usually referred to as the Trilby\u2014\
    I do not know why) and the universal cap. A new-hat-for-men competition would\
    \ be most amusing . . . Let reference be made to hat monotony.\nNorthcliffe would\
    \ probably have been able to answer Peter Blegvad's questions about hats."
