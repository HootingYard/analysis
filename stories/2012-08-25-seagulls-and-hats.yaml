  text: 'Daily Mail bashers like to trot out the newspaper''s sympathetic line towards
    the Nazis in the run-up to the Second World War. It seems to me that this is now
    far too familiar a charge, and that if we are going to delve into history to find
    sticks with which to beat the paper, some fresh snippet is long overdue. I was
    pleased, therefore, to find this anecdote about Lord Northcliffe, the founder
    of the Daily Mail, in Piers Brendon''s Eminent Edwardians (1979):

    The campaigner against the use of birds'' feathers to decorate women''s hats once
    wantonly struck down a seagull with his stick and beat it to death on the sand.

    Incidentally, Northcliffe seems to have had a thing about hats. In 1910, he issued
    a directive to his editorial staff:

    It is about time men had a new hat. Why not offer PS100 for the best design for
    a new hat? There is at present only the silk hat, the pot-hat or bowler (what
    in America is called a Derby), the straw hat, the felt hat of various shapes (usually
    referred to as the Trilby--I do not know why) and the universal cap. A new-hat-for-men
    competition would be most amusing . . . Let reference be made to hat monotony.

    Northcliffe would probably have been able to answer Peter Blegvad''s questions
    about hats.'
