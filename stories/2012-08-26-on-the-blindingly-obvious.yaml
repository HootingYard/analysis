  text: 'At an advanced stage, the gunk is scraped off with a tallow-knife, collected
    in a pot, reduced by steaming and fed to seahorses. After several days the seahorses
    begin to display intricate and abnormal behaviour patterns. These patterns can
    be traced on graph paper with propelling-pencils and a ruler. Comparison with
    earlier graphs, done under a double blind test, have proved immensely illuminating.
    So lustrous, indeed, that copied out onto onion-skin paper and crumpled up, they
    can be inserted into glass bulbs and light a long corridor in a large building
    for upwards of four days. By the fourth day, they are dimming, there is a dying
    of the light, and sensitive persons mourn, as mourn they might.

    Having disposed of the gunk as described, the main bulk is best fed through a
    sieve. The most effective sieve to use is one with so-called "Swedenborgian angel"
    holes. These are not generally available in the shops, but can be ordered direct
    by post from the manufacturers, thus keeping costs surprisingly low. You might
    want to purchase two or three at one time. The fragile nature of the sieve means
    that it will not, alas, survive much use. It is easily distressed, especially
    when you try to force stuff through the holes, as certain boisterous and reckless
    persons tend to do. If you have such a person on your team, it is a good idea
    to keep them away from the sieves by telling them to go and keep an eye on the
    seahorses.

    Other pesky or exasperating team members can be usefully employed--and kept out
    of your hair--by laying the plumb line. This should consist of tent-pegs and butcher''s
    string and stretch as far as the eye can see. The line should ideally be at the
    height of an average hollyhock, the calculation being made by consulting the tables
    at the back of the Annual Hollyhock Height Register. A copy of this ought to be
    in your local reference library, but will usually not be available for borrowing,
    so a literate and numerate member of the team, with a valid library ticket, should
    be delegated to copy out the required details. They can use the back of the graph
    paper on which the behaviour patterns of the seahorses have earlier been inscribed
    in majestic sweeping lines and arcs of unsurpassed beauty.

    Meanwhile, having fed the main bulk through the sieve into a bucket, the bucket
    can now be ferried to the platform. This should stand on sturdy props, the sturdier
    the better. Do not on any account use balsa wood. You are probably familiar with
    the case of Tarleton, and what transpired with his balsa wood props. If necessary,
    test the sturdiness using the standard tests of sturdiness which appear as Appendix
    VII in your pamphlet. Otherwise, proceed directly to the siphon and funnel palaver.

    Siphon the stuff out of the bucket, working slowly and methodically and seamlessly.
    As it passes through the funnel, take snapshots at one-minute intervals from the
    designated angles. These need not be full colour snapshots, unless they have been
    explicitly specified in the contract. That is certainly an unusual clause nowadays,
    and if it does appear, it is worth checking. The contract might, after all, have
    been drawn up by a halfwit. Try to ensure that no seahorses are visible in the
    background of the snapshots.

    The whole lot, save for the scraped-off gunk, should now have been transferred
    into beakers, without spillage. Align the beakers along the plumb-line. Once they
    are in place, and only when they are in place, attach the snap-on, snap-off lids.
    Using a thick bold black indelible marker pen, draw identifying symbols on the
    lids. For examples of apt symbols, see Appendix IX. Make sure each one is different.
    There is often a temptation to repeat the seahorse symbol because it is so fetching.
    Fight against this temptation with all your might, like Christ in the wilderness.

    In case of rainfall, it will be necessary to cover both beakers and plumb-line
    with tarpaulin(s). The approved colour is an almost transparent light blue. Any
    other colour is likely to result in fewer points being awarded, without the right
    of appeal. Again, the case of Tarleton should give you pause if you are thinking
    of using black or yellow tarpaulin or, God forbid, a particularly opaque one.
    It was not amusing when Tarleton had to account for himself before the panel.

    The seahorses'' tiny brains will by now be utterly ravaged. Scoop them from the
    tank with a standard angler''s net and deposit them on the slab. One by one, using
    a very sharp kitchen knife, remove the brain from each seahorse. If you feel pangs
    of pity in your soul you are pursuing the wrong hobby and would be better off
    taking up ping pong. Place the brains in a brown paper bag. Twist the top of the
    bag to seal it and then swing it around your head several times while ululating
    an incantation. It is important to note that this step is essentially meaningless,
    so you need not put a great deal of effort into it. But it is always a good idea
    to show willing. You do not know who is watching.

    Holding the bag in your right hand, walk the length of the plumb line, pausing
    at each beaker. At each pause, gaze mournfully into the middle distance, your
    lips trembling. Some of the feathers in your headdress may fall to the ground.
    You should disregard them, while at the same time being very careful not to tread
    on them as you resume your walk towards the next beaker along the line. That is
    unless they are sparrow feathers, in which case you should pick them up and put
    them in your pocket. But that of course should go without saying, as it is blindingly
    obvious, if you have got this far.
