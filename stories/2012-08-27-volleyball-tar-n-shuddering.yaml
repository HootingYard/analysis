  text: 'A couple of snaps of Volleyball, Tar & Shuddering, a 1989 work by Mr Key.
    It consists of a set of fifteen cards each bearing a colour illustration and a
    scribbled text (plus two endpapers, or, I suppose, endcards). I cannot recall
    how many copies were issued, but its rarity value is such that it can fetch as
    much as 35p at today''s prices.
