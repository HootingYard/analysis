  text: 'A further snippet from Piers Brendon''s Eminent Edwardians (1979):

    Elegant and well-born ("All our family go to Heaven"), Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence
    became treasurer of the WPSU. Like other Suffragettes she had previously been
    engaged in a bizarre form of Edwardian philanthropy, the endeavour to restore
    to the brutalized urban masses their lost sense of the pulsating joy of Merrie
    England by means of folk songs and Morris dances.

    Is it too late to try this again?
