  text: 'The first sighting of the Hooting Yard "Implausible" emblem, on the back
    of the cover of the Re Records Quarterly Magazine Volume 2 Number 3. The emblem
    in the bottom left corner tells us that the pictures were drawn by Mr Key on the
    third and fourth of October 1988. Click once (or possibly twice) for enormousness.
