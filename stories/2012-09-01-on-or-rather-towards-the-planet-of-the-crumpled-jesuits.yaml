  text: 'These are the voyages of the Starship Corrugated Cardboard, its five year
    mission to seek out, somewhere in the illimitable vastness of space, the Planet
    of the Crumpled Jesuits. This is needle in a haystack stuff. Unless you have boldly
    gone across the universe yourself, aboard one of the other starships, you really
    can have no idea just what a palaver it is. So, some sympathy please.

    When I was called in to Starship Command, four and a half years ago, all I knew
    was that I was going to be made captain of a mission. What I did not know was
    the nature of that mission. I was excited, for this was to be my first captaincy.
    I had plenty of experience as a bo''sun and a crow''s nester on both ships and
    starships. I had done the so-called "milk round", delivering bottles of milk to
    far-flung space colonies such as New Jaywick and Far Distant New Isle of Muck.
    I had served my time plying between the dismal little planetoids of Galaxy 14,
    eradicating the bindweed and setting up diversity outreach initiatives. I had
    even been to the furthest and most distant planet of all, the one with the weird
    voodoo-rastafarian belief system and giant Cyclopean turtles and sweet-smelling
    marsh gas. But none of these voyages had prepared me for the mission to find,
    somewhere in the illimitable vastness of space, the Planet of the Crumpled Jesuits.

    The story goes that several hundred years ago, on a mere whim, a gang of Jesuits
    grew tired of earthly ways and set out in a secondhand spaceship to find a deserted
    planet. There they would establish a Jesuitical paradise, if one can imagine such
    a thing. They, quite clearly, did. But what they cannot have foreseen was their
    gradual crumpling, which began shortly after they landed on their distant world,
    and proceeded apace, with ghastly consequences. Now every single Jesuit on the
    planet was a picture of almost unimaginable crumplement. Paradise it might have
    been, but a paradise tinged with crumples.

    This much we knew from radio reports picked up by a space scooter. The news caused
    something of a hubbub when it reached Earth. Certain members of the Interplanetary
    Council were livid, others more sanguine. But the livid ones won the day, and
    it was they who insisted on sending a mission to find the planet. Because of the
    space scooter''s on-board radio scrambling system, it was an unfathomable mystery
    from where the stark and crumpled messages had been sent. I did ask Starship Command
    what I was meant to do after I found the planet, and was given an envelope marked
    "Further Instructions To Be Opened Only After The Planet Of The Crumpled Jesuits
    Has Been Located And That Location Confirmed". I kept the envelope tucked into
    a pocket of my Starship Captain''s Smock. It''s a fine smock, modelled on the
    ones worn by nineteenth century peasants in rustic English backwaters.

    "Rustic backwaters" is as good a description as any of the many and various worlds
    we have visited during the last four and a half years. We have seen incredible
    things, most of them involving potatoes, hay and space-straw, but to date we have
    not encountered a crumpled Jesuit. Uncrumpled ones, yes, on certain other planets,
    a list of which I maintain in my log book. Most planets, after all, or at least
    most of the ones that support life, have a Jesuit, as they have an alderman and
    a town crier and a haberdasher and a man whose job it is to club seals. My crew
    and I have gained deep and penetrating insights into the basic patterns of the
    known universe.

    And we have taken tea with the voodoo-rastafarians of that most distant of all
    planets. It was our first port of call. Knowing that some members of my crew would
    suffer from terrible homesickness, I decided to ease their sufferings by the simple
    expedient of so arranging things that for the bulk of our voyage we would be heading
    Earthwards. In a roundabout way, of course, but generally with the starship''s
    nose cone pointing towards home. As a result of my captainy wisdom, morale has
    been high. Where the average starship voyage is a purgatory of lassitude, grumpiness,
    longing, and weeping, the Corrugated Cardboard is a jocund ship, with piccolo
    recitals and flower-arranging contests and jousting tournaments and games of quoits
    and monkey divertissements and all sorts of other recreations. On Sundays I prance
    and skip about with a fairy wand. The only tears are tears of happiness.

    Yet for all that, there is mounting tension. With only six months before our scheduled
    landing at Starship Command HQ at Clacton-on-Sea, we are all too aware that we
    are in danger of failure. There has been so sign of anything even resembling the
    Planet of the Crumpled Jesuits. Our daily prayers are not helping, even though
    we say them in Latin, and wear vestments. The envelope in my pocket remains unopened.
    I know I cannot ask for more time. For one thing, the fuel will run out. Also,
    the emergency boosters packed up after we had to make a quick getaway from a planet
    in sector 9 which turned out to be inhabited entirely by starving, befanged and
    ferocious giant space-donkeys. The chief engineer, a dour Scot like all good starship
    chief engineers, has been faffing about with the boosters day in day out, but
    they still make a horrible creaking noise and sputter out. Or perhaps it is the
    chief engineer who makes the creaking noise? He may be more elderly than I had
    been led to believe. Or the space-time continuum might be playing tricks on us.
    I have heard rumours of such things.

    But we must keep our peckers up. Today is the feast day of St Ignatius Loyola.
    We shall continue on our voyage aboard the starship Corrugated Cardboard with
    hope in our hearts. So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly
    into the gravitational field of the Planet of the Crumpled Jesuits.'
