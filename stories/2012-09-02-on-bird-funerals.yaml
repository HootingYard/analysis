    The BBC reports that birds hold funerals for their dead.

    When western scrub jays encounter a dead bird, they call out to one another and
    stop foraging. The jays then often fly down to the dead body and gather around
    it, scientists have discovered . . .

    The revelation comes from a study by Teresa Iglesias and colleagues at the University
    of California, Davis, US. They conducted experiments, placing a series of objects
    into residential back yards and observing how western scrub jays in the area reacted.
    The objects included different coloured pieces of wood, dead jays, as well as
    mounted, stuffed jays and great horned owls, simulating the presence of live jays
    and predators . . .

    The jays reacted indifferently to the wooden objects. But when they spied a dead
    bird, they started making alarm calls, warning others long distances away. The
    jays then gathered around the dead body, forming large cacophonous aggregations.
    The calls they made, known as "zeeps", "scolds" and "zeep-scolds", encouraged
    new jays to attend to the dead.

    The jays also stopped foraging for food, a change in behaviour that lasted for
    over a day . . . The fact that the jays didn''t react to the wooden objects shows
    that it is not the novelty of a dead bird appearing that triggers the reaction.

    This may be news to the BBC, and to Teresa Iglesias and her colleagues, but it
    would have come as no surprise to Dobson, who considered himself an expert on
    such matters. The twentieth century''s titanic pamphleteer planned to devote a
    series of pamphlets to the funerary customs of different types of birds, although
    only one was ever published. This was Funerary Customs Of Different Types Of Birds,
    No. 1 : The Seagull (out of print). Here is an extract:

    I happened to be present on the occasion when Lord Northcliffe, the founder of
    the Daily Mail, wantonly beat a seagull to death with his stick. My first impulse
    was to rush along the promenade towards him and remonstrate, and to snatch the
    gull-bloodied stick from his grasp and give him a taste of his own medicine. But
    I was stopped in my tracks by what I saw next. As the press baron stalked off,
    no doubt dreaming of fascism, there gathered about the corpse of the seagull several
    boffins in white coats, who deposited around it an array of stuffed or wooden
    seagulls and owls. They then withdrew, as swiftly as they had appeared, and hid
    behind a seaside ice cream kiosk. From this vantage point, they watched carefully,
    taking out notebooks and pencils and scanners and scopes and meters and gauges
    and similar scientific impedimenta.

    Within seconds, dozens of seagulls came swooping down and hovered over their dead
    pal. The air was loud with the cacophany of their cries. They remained thus for
    some time, until a municipal seaside dustbin person came along with a shovel and
    a sack, scooped the bird with the one into the other, and took it away to the
    nearest bird cemetery. I made to follow him, but in order to do so I had to cross
    the road, and I did so in Baden-Powell fashion, looking neither to right nor left,
    not out of blank foolishness but because it is the British way. I thus got it
    in the back from a passing motor car, and spent the next several weeks in a seaside
    clinic. I never did visit the grave of the seagull.

    As so often with Dobson, it is not quite clear whether this is a true account
    of events or the babbling of a nutcase. He may well have made the whole thing
    up for his own private amusement, or to chuckle over with his inamorata Marigold
    Chew. Equally likely, he may have actually believed it to be true, not realising
    it was merely a dream. At certain periods in his life Dobson had immense difficulty
    distinguishing between dreams and reality, never more so than when birdlife was
    concerned. In a hiatus of--comparative--lucidity, the pamphleteer wrote:

    I can never quite convince myself that birds are real, that they actually exist.
    Whether it be a western scrub jay or a seagull or a stalin or a linnet, or any
    of the teeming multitude of birds, they seem to me ethereal creatures from the
    world of dreams. Now, unlike many people, I have never experienced dreams of flight.
    Rather, my dreaming self summons forth wagtails and nuthatches and swifts and
    pratincoles, and others of the teeming multitude of birds, sometimes one at a
    time, sometimes massed in breathtaking flocks. I see the flapping of their wings
    and I hear their songs. Or do I? Are they not, rather, hallucinatory phantasmagoria,
    flying images etched upon my brain representing what I would be were I not bound
    to this too too solid earth by my great clumping feet shod in a pair of Austrian
    postal inspector''s boots?

    That passage is taken from Dobson''s pamphlet Some Unfocussed Thoughts On Birds
    And Boots (out of print). Unfortunately for the ornithologically crazed, that
    is all he has to say about birds on this occasion, the following forty-seven closely-printed
    pages being taken up with a virtually unreadable disquisition upon the Austrian
    postal inspector''s boots, which may themselves have been "hallucinatory phantasmagoria",
    if we are to believe the evidence so diligently collected by Ted Cack in his forthcoming
    monograph on Dobson''s footwear.

    As both the BBC and Teresa Iglesias and her colleagues know very well, birds do
    exist, in at least three distinct forms, (1) real, (2) stuffed, and (3) wooden.
    It would be interesting to know what Dobson would have made of that.'
