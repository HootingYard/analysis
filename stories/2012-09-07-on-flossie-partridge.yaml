  text: 'Though his mighty brain confounded mere mortals, Sherlock Holmes was, of
    course, a dimwit in comparison with his brother Mycroft. Something similar may
    be said about Blossom Partridge and her sister Flossie.

    Blossom is best-known as editrix of Miss Blossom Partridge''s Weekly Digest, quite
    possibly the finest weekly digest on this or any other planet. It remains, defiantly,
    a printed paper publication, though one feels sure that if Blossom ever countenanced
    the idea of going online, she would wipe the floor with the ghastly Arianna Huffington
    or with Tina Brown of the Daily Beast. Not the least of the charms of the Weekly
    Digest is that it is hand-written in Blossom''s immaculate copperplate and the
    copies duplicated on an ancient and creaking Gestetner machine. Blossom also refuses
    to acknowledge the horrors of decimalisation and the cover price has been held
    at 4d. By any measure she is a marvel of marvels among women.

    Yet she would be first to bow to the even greater marvellousness of her sister.
    Flossie Partridge is a balloonist, aviatrix, explorer, inventor, secret agent,
    government spy, and the Lord knows what else besides. She could serve as a role
    model for any aspiring International Woman of Mystery, did she not remain almost
    entirely hidden from the public gaze. What little we know about her is thanks
    to hints dropped by Blossom in her magazine.

    For example, Blossom has written movingly about the rare times the sisters spend
    together, when "we never walk like other people: we skip and gambol to show how
    girlish we are, as if we were Goosie and Piggy Antrobus". She alludes to some
    of Flossie''s more hair-raising adventures in her regular "Glimpses of Flossie''s
    Hair-Raising Adventures" column, without ever going into the sort of detail that
    might compromise her sister''s obsessive, indeed maniacal, desire for secrecy.
    Thus, we might be afforded a "glimpse" of Flossie inventing a new serum, or in
    hand-to-hand combat with a giant anaconda, but we will not be told the purpose
    or recipe of the serum, nor the rationale or location of the death-struggle. Nor,
    incidentally, does Blossom divulge how one might engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with a beast that has no hands, though by omitting an explanation she guarantees
    a bulging postbag of readers'' letters.

    Regular readers of the Weekly Digest will be aware that in virtually every issue,
    the "Dear Miss Partridge" letters page includes a lengthy, demented, and hysterical
    screed from a certain I. Alfred Pigtosser. Occasionally, Mr Pigtosser might address
    a topic raised in an earlier issue; more often, however, his letter will be a
    bitter and venomous harangue, barely coherent, shading at times into outright
    madness. Blossom has stated that it is her policy never to cut or otherwise edit
    her readers'' letters, and so there are times when a Pigtosser letter takes up
    six- or seven-eighths of the entire magazine. Readers complain, but Blossom remains
    unruffled.

    It has not escaped the notice of her more astute readers that "I. Alfred Pigtosser"
    is an anagram of "Flossie Partridge". Could it be, they ask, incredulously, that
    this poisonous invective is the work of the editrix''s marvellous sister? To which
    Blossom has responded by publishing grainy black-and-white photographs purporting
    to show Mr Pigtosser as an infant, on a tricycle, in a sailor''s suit, next to
    a large swan. She does not say how she came by these snaps, nor provide evidence
    of the (blurred) infant''s identity. On the other hand, Blossom is such a marvellous
    woman that she would surely not try to pull the wool over her readers'' eyes.
    It is a conundrum to be sure.

    Speaking of wool, another of the regular features in the Weekly Digest is "Miss
    Blossom Partridge''s Woolly Blather". Here one might find adventurous knitting
    projects, crochet extravaganzas, and disquisitions upon good wool and bad wool.
    Every now and then, the "Woolly Blather" and "Glimpses of Flossie''s Hair-Raising
    Adventures" columns are combined into one, as a surprising number of Flossie''s
    hair-raising adventures have involved wool in some form or other. One thinks of
    the incident when Flossie was engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a giant anaconda
    which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be an extensive draught-excluding
    sausage knitted entirely from the wool of a merino sheep. Blossom, with her typical
    editorial dash, appended a pattern so readers could knit their own. As if to provide
    fuel for the conspiracy theorists, the article prompted a letter from I. Alfred
    Pigtosser so lengthy, and mad, that it completely filled the next three issues
    of the magazine.

    As far as is known, Flossie Partridge has never published a single word under
    her own name. Presumably she is too busy ballooning, flying aeroplanes, exploring,
    inventing, engaged on secret missions, spying for the government, and the Lord
    knows what else besides ever to find time to put pen to paper. Blossom has said,
    however, that once, when she and her sister were skipping and gambolling girlishly
    o''er the green to dance around a maypole, Flossie let slip that she kept a daily
    diary. It is said to run to thousands upon thousands of pages, scribbled in Flossie''s
    mad demented scrawl--so unlike her sister''s elegant copperplate!--and kept in
    an airtight and lead-lined storage facility in a subterranean cavern somewhere
    below the Swiss Alps. Who knows what secrets it contains? Marvellous secrets!


    Blossom, or Flossie, or someone else entirely, as a child.'
