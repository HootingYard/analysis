  text: "I've said it before and I'll say it again : reportage is the lifeblood of\
    \ Hooting Yard. The reason I say it again is to drum it into your heads. There\
    \ is a distressing number of readers who seem to believe that I make all of this\
    \ stuff up. Quite apart from the sheer foolishness of doing so, I am ever mindful\
    \ of B. S. Johnson's dictum \"Telling stories is telling lies\". And, as Lennox\
    \ and Stewart put it so cogently, \"Would I lie to you?\" You need not attempt\
    \ to answer that now, just read on, mes braves!\nTo bolster Hooting Yard's reputation\
    \ as a respectable space age information provider, I have decided to appoint a\
    \ Fact Check Team. They will go about their business independently, without fear\
    \ or favour, digging and rummaging and fossicking where their piercingly-honed\
    \ instincts take them. If it should so happen that they come upon an instance\
    \ of inaccuracy or outright lying, I will accept their ruling and remove the offending\
    \ postage, replacing it with a correction written by the team. I will even so\
    \ arrange things that the correction appears in big bright red bold capital letters,\
    \ accompanied perhaps by a skull-and-crossbones symbol such as one sometimes finds\
    \ on bottles of poison. That should liven things up!\nSo let me introduce you\
    \ to the team. There are three members, each of whom graduated, if that is the\
    \ word I want, from Pang Hill Orphanage. Bim and Bam and Little Nitty each have\
    \ long experience of the kind of painstaking drudgery necessary to hunt down the\
    \ facts, although in their case the painstaking drudgery they experienced was\
    \ sewing mailbags in a dank cellar by the light of a single Toc H lamp. I have\
    \ always been a great believer in transferable skills.\nI am also a great believer\
    \ in the benefits of fresh air and hiking and long jaunts in the open air. That\
    \ is why Bim and Bam and Little Nitty will do their fact-checking in \"the field\"\
    \ or \"on the ground\", out and about. In any case, I do not want them cluttering\
    \ up my chalet o' prose and whimpering and eating me out of house and home. They\
    \ can forage for nuts and berries and fresh puddlewater when they are in the field\
    \ or on the ground.\nIn order to decide what the trio should investigate first,\
    \ I conducted a lightning readers' poll. \"On what topic,\" I asked, \"can Bim\
    \ and Bam and Little Nitty cut their chops as a tiptop fact check team?\" Typical\
    \ of the response I received--sorry, I mean to say \"responses\" plural, because\
    \ I did ask more than one reader, honestly, cross my heart and hope to ascend\
    \ in glory to the ethereal realms--was this, from one T. Thurn:\nDear Mr Key,\n\
    \    Last night I lay awake tossing and turning and biting and pummelling my Plumpo!(tm)\
    \ pillow, bereft of even a second of shut-eye because I am so desperate to know\
    \ if the orchard and hotel and squirrels referred to in Alfred Pigtosser's autobiography\
    \ I, Alfred Pigtosser actually exist. And if they do, I have supplementary questions,\
    \ not so much about the squirrels but regarding the orchard and hotel. They can\
    \ wait, however, until Bim and Bam and Little Nitty have ascertained the brute\
    \ reality or otherwise of the orchard and the hotel and the squirrels and reported\
    \ back, exhausted from their hike or jaunt, having cut their chops.\n    Yours\
    \ with bated but minty breath,\n    T. Thurn\nI think you would have liked the\
    \ next scene. \"Bim! Bam! Little Nitty!\" I called, in my most stentorian boom.\
    \ They shuffled in, spindly and unkempt and dribbling. Terry-Thomas would have\
    \ dismissed them as an absolute shower!, but I had every confidence in my fact\
    \ check team. \"Here,\" I said, \"Take these three partly prepaid bus tickets,\
    \ go to the bus stop, and wait for a bus. When eventually a bus arrives, board\
    \ it and take it as far out into the countryside as it goes. Then ring the bell\
    \ and alight and go in search of the orchard and hotel and squirrels mentioned\
    \ in Alfred Pigtosser's autobiography I, Alfred Pigtosser. And don't get up to\
    \ any mischief or it's back to Pang Hill Orphanage with you!\"\n\"Please Mr Key,\"\
    \ whimpered one of them, Bim or Bam or Little Nitty, in a weak thin quavering\
    \ voice, \"How are we to survive in the countryside when we are used to being\
    \ given a bowl of gruel once a day at grueltime?\"\nI gave each of them a hefty\
    \ slap on the back and boomed \"Fear not! The Lord will provide! And if He does\
    \ not, because your prayers are insufficiently abject, then I am sure you will\
    \ find opportunities to forage for nuts and berries and fresh puddlewater! Now\
    \ off you go, before I summon the beadle to drag you back to the orphanage!\"\n\
    The last I saw of them, they were trudging disconsolately to the bus stop. I have\
    \ no doubt, however, that at this very moment they are far away on some bleak\
    \ blasted heath or moor, their vitals stimulated by all that unaccustomed fresh\
    \ air, diligently seeking signs of an orchard and a hotel and some squirrels.\
    \ As soon as they report back, assuming they can cobble together the bus fares\
    \ for the return journey, I will let you know. And I will publish their report\
    \ in full. It will, I am sure, confirm the existence of that orchard and that\
    \ hotel and those squirrels. Then T. Thurn can fire at me as many supplementary\
    \ questions as he likes."
