  text: 'A letter arrives:

    Dear, beloved Mr Key

    We are lost, hopelessly hopelessly hopelessly lost. We write "hopelessly" thrice
    to indicate that each of us is hopeless. We would not have you think one is hopeless
    while two retain hope, nor that two are hopeless and one still hopeful. We are
    all hopeless and we are all lost.

    How we have come to this pass may take some explaining. We got off the bus, as
    you told us. We were on a lane. There was a hedge. There may have been birds nesting
    in the hedge. There was certainly sign of nest, if not of bird. Had a bird returned
    to the nest while we stood there in the lane as the bus chugged away into the
    distance, there is every chance we might have killed the bird for food. We were
    famished. Lucky bird, then, that it was off and out, somewhere in the sky, in
    flight.

    We peered over the hedge. There was a field. It was an extensive field containing
    several cows. We pondered killing one of the cows for food but could not come
    up with a method. Had there been a bird in the nest in the hedge, we could have
    borne down upon it, the three of us, menacingly, and made short work of it. Two
    could hold it still while the third throttled it. We looked at a cow and tried
    to picture applying that same method. It was not a convincing picture.

    We cast our six eyes around in case there might be a pile of rocks in the field
    or beside the lane. With a rock of sufficient size we thought one of us might
    bash the cow about the head until it dropped dead. But look as we might there
    seemed to be nothing bigger than a stone or a pebble, neither of which we thought
    would prove fatal to a cow no matter how hard we hit it. We had to bear in mind
    the presence of several cows and assume that the ones we did not attack would
    come rushing to the aid of the one we did. A few quick sharp blows with a big
    rock would kill a cow before the other cows came a-charging. But we would have
    no such window of opportunity armed with mere pebbles. We dismissed the cows as
    a possible source of food and turned our attentions back to the lane.

    We were famished, but at this stage we were not yet hopeless, nor indeed lost.
    After all, we had only just alighted from the bus and had not yet had time to
    get our bearings. In our hearts there was a flicker of optimism that within a
    few hundred yards we might come upon the orchard with its squirrels, or the hotel,
    or both. We decided to walk along the lane in the same direction in which the
    bus had travelled. The bus itself had disappeared over the horizon. Ahead of us
    we could see various clumps and slopes and distant buildings. Hence our hope.

    Shortly afterwards, we came upon a puddle of recent rainwater. We fell upon our
    knees and drank our fill. It was a big puddle, so we did not drain it. We spotted
    in it a small pale, almost translucent, writhing wriggling wormy maggoty kind
    of being. Food! We could have compared notes on whose famishment was most debilitating,
    or drawn lots, but instead, and in spite of its tininess, having plucked it from
    the puddle we chopped it into three equal portions. Squatting beside the puddle,
    we then sucked on our helping rather than bolting it down, to eke from it all
    the nourishment we could and to make it last as long as possible. Yum!

    Thus fortified, if only minimally, we toiled on along the lane. Certain clumps
    and slopes and distant buildings grew closer. None was yet close enough to ascertain
    whether an orchard or hotel was among them. Pangs of thirst now beset us, as the
    wormy maggoty thing had proved surprisingly salty. We encountered no further puddles,
    but then the hedge beside the lane came to a sudden stop and in its place was
    a ditch. In the ditch was a great deal of water, an admixture of recent rain and
    some kind of filthy muck-riddled brownish liquid oozing up from below. We judged
    that were we to drink it, we would be at risk of stomach cramps and digestive
    horrors and many another gastric malady. "Gastric" may not be the appropriate
    word, but let it stand. So we trudged on, the watery ditch alongside us like a
    cruel taunt of the devil''s. It may have been about this time we began to lose
    hope. But we were still not lost, because we could see the clumps and slopes and
    distant buildings ahead. We had something to aim towards, be it but a chimera.

    But then a mist descended. It was a thick mist. We could not even see our hands
    in front of our faces, let alone the clumps and slopes and distant buildings.
    There was some relief in the fact that moisture was present in the mist, so if
    we gulped mouthfuls of it and swallowed, our thirst raged a little less, oh a
    little less, but enough, enough. If you can put yourself in the place of a famished
    and thirst-ravaged orphan recently discharged from an orphanage and sent into
    the rustic wastelands on a fact checking mission by a writer of unparalleled genius,
    accompanied by two similarly discharged and famished and thirst-ravaged orphans
    from the same orphanage on the same fact checking mission, you will appreciate
    how greedily we gulped that mist-moisture.

    In fact, we were so revitalised that we said "Pshaw!" to the mist, the three of
    us in unison, and we blundered onwards, even though we could not see where we
    were going. This was our undoing. For when the mist cleared, as suddenly as it
    had descended, there was no sign of the clumps and the slopes and the distant
    buildings. There was merely a bleak expanse of nothingness. We were lost. And
    we were hopelessly hopelessly hopelessly lost.

    We slumped against a blob of the nothingness that might have been a vestige of
    hedge or of the side of a ditch. We sobbed quietly for a while. Then we wrote
    this report. It is an interim report. Hopeless we may be, thrice hopeless, but
    we shall press on with our mission, as if it were a metaphor for man''s life upon
    this mortal coil. If you receive this letter, you will know that at least we stumbled
    upon a postbox. What the postbox is a metaphor for, we leave for you to judge.

    Yours lost and hopeless, your devoted fact checking team.
