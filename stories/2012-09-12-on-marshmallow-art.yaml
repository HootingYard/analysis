  text: 'Startlingly hirsute Italian artist Accurso Git unveiled his latest work at
    the Pointy Town Biennale this week. Egregore is an anatomically accurate facsimile
    of the brain, rendered in Git''s favourite medium, marshmallow. Intriguingly,
    the startlingly untidy artist has chosen to express the concept of the egregore--an
    occult concept representing a "thoughtform" or "collective group mind", an autonomous
    psychic entity--with a marshmallow model not of the human brain, but that of the
    lobster.

    The students of lobsterdom among you will know that the brain of a lobster is
    about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen. They do not possess the keenest
    intellects in the animal kingdom. Asked why his brain was so tiny, Accurso Git
    initially misconstrued the question and set about his interviewer with his fists,
    those startlingly hairy fists, with the result that the interview had to be postponed
    for a month while the interviewer received hospital treatment. During this time,
    the startlingly ill-tempered artist was given several written assurances that
    the tiny brain being referred to was that of the lobster, not the one encased
    in his own startlingly enormous head. When he was eventually placated, and the
    interview resumed, in a clinic annexe where the interviewer was learning to walk
    and talk again, Git gave this reply:

    "Have you seen the cost of marshmallows? Add together the prices of sugar and
    corn syrup and water and gelatin that has been softened in hot water and dextrose
    and vanilla flavourings, take into account the optional use of colouring agents
    and/or eggs, tack on the labour involved in whipping the mixture to a spongy consistency,
    and it will be clear even to a simpleton that a startlingly impoverished artist
    like me, the critically acclaimed Accurso Git, could not afford more than a tiny,
    tiny amount of marshmallow. What little money I have must be kept aside for gourmet
    meals and wine and international jetset travel and floozies and pipe tobacco and
    a place at the table in the tiptop casinos! Yet as I struggled to bring to birth
    my vision, I realised that a tiny lobster-brain-sized marshmallow facsimile brain
    was the perfect realisation of the egregore. Were it the size of a human brain,
    it would be too big. Were it smaller than a lobster brain, it would be as near
    as dammit invisible. By settling upon the size I did I have proved yet again that
    I am the greatest artist of this or any other age."

    This kind of talk is par for the course with the startlingly egotistical artist,
    and is difficult to argue with unless one wishes to end up in hospital alongside
    others who have crossed him. And in truth, he has a point. When one spends many
    hours in contemplation of Egregore, as I have done, the sheer artistic force of
    the piece becomes clear. To a layman it might look like nothing more than a singularly
    tiny marshmallow placed upon a plinth with a glass case surrounding it, the sole
    object in the startlingly vast galeria of the Pointy Town Civic Hall, Scout Hut,
    & Temporary Allotment Rental Office. Yet, as so often, the layman does not see
    what the piercing acuity of the goatee''d, cravat-wearing art critic sees. Admittedly,
    I too was at first deluded into thinking it was a mere miniature marshmallow brain.
    In fact I stomped off to the galeria canteen and unleashed my laptop and, over
    a startlingly ungenerous helping of sausages ''n'' pickle, I tapped out an article
    in which I suggested that Accurso Git had lost his mojo.

    Where, I asked, were the signs of the majestic genius whose rendering in marshmallow
    of the Tet Offensive had been at once so offensive and so thick with sugar and
    corn syrup and water and gelatin that had been softened in hot water and dextrose
    and vanilla flavourings and colouring agents and eggs? And where oh where was
    the startlingly combative artist whose marshmallow Noli me tangere somehow cast
    two millennia of Christian art into the dustbin of history?

    The answer was that he was standing right behind me in the canteen, breathing
    down my neck and with his fists, those startlingly bony fists, raised ready to
    strike. I did what any goatee''d cravat-wearing art critic would have done in
    the circumstances, and offered him a spoonful of pickle. While he was engaged
    in munching it, with his startlingly awful table manners, I had time to reassess
    Egregore. I continued to reassess it until Accurso Git dropped his fists, sat
    down, and called to the waiter for a bottle of wine and an ashtray and a floozie.
    Until, that is, he appeared to be relaxing, and no longer startlingly combative.
    I then gave him what was left of my sausage, for in all honesty I had lost my
    appetite.

    What I have not lost my appetite for is Egregore. To that end, I obtained a special
    permit to set up a camp bed in the galeria, and I now spend all day, every day,
    gazing, with my customary piercing acuity, at a tiny model of a lobster brain
    fashioned from sugar and corn syrup and water and gelatin that has been softened
    in hot water and dextrose and vanilla flavourings and colouring agents and eggs,
    then whipped to a spongy consistency by marshmallow technicians, more than ever
    convinced that what I am gazing at is beyond any doubt the very finest tiny model
    of a lobster brain fashioned from sugar and corn syrup and water and gelatin that
    has been softened in hot water and dextrose and vanilla flavourings and colouring
    agents and eggs, then whipped to a spongy consistency by marshmallow technicians
    in the entire history of Western, or indeed any other, art. And that is my considered
    opinion as a goatee''d, cravat wearing art critic sans pareil.'
