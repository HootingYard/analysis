  text: '

    I was pleased to note, in this week''s newsletter from World Wide Words, that
    Michael Quinion turns his attention to hoity-toity. He tells us that the original
    meaning was "frolicsome, romping, giddy, flighty":

    Hoity-toity derives from the long-obsolete verb hoit, meaning to "indulge in riotous
    and noisy mirth" (have you hoited recently? it''s supposed to be very good for
    you) or to "romp inelegantly" (again from the OED; is it even possible to romp
    elegantly?). Where hoit comes from is uncertain, although an early form suggests
    a link with hoyden, which is now an unfashionable way to describe a noisy or energetic
    girl but which at the time could also mean an ignorant or clownish man. This is
    probably from the Middle Dutch heiden, a heath, hence a yokel; if so, hoyden is
    a close relative of heathen.

    Curiously, the estimable Mr Quinion has nothing to say about Fort Hoity and Fort
    Toity, the favourite forts of Hooting Yard readers. In fact, other than a few
    military history buffs and Uncle Tobys, you lot may be the only persons who actually
    have favourite forts. I conducted a sort of straw poll on this matter by buttonholing
    a random selection of pedestrians between here and Nameless Pond.

    "Excuse me," I said, standing in front of them so they could not pass, "May I
    ask you which is your favourite fort?" I did not get a single coherent or sensible
    answer. Perhaps had I armed myself with a clipboard and a biro and a high visibility
    jacket the results would have been different. But on the evidence of my admittedly
    unscientific survey, I am forced to conclude that one hundred percent of riffraff
    infesting the streets of my bailiwick early on a Saturday morning care not a jot
    for forts of any kind. Some of them seemed not to know what in heaven''s name
    I was talking about. That is the modern education system for you.

    As fanatically devoted Hooting Yard readers, you already knew, or at least suspected,
    that you were members of a select band. Now you have further confirmation, in
    that you can most definitely claim to be among that minuscule portion of the populace
    who have a favourite fort. My research, such as it is, tells me that you are pretty
    evenly divided between Fort Hoity fans and aficionados of Fort Toity. I have not
    analysed the stats in great detail, partly because there aren''t really any reliable
    stats on this matter, and partly because, even if there were, I doubt that I am
    capable of the drudgery necessary to analyse them. I have better things to do
    with my time, such as smoking and staring out of the window at crows while listening
    to Essay On Pigs by Hans Werner Henze. It''s a godawful racket, but it drowns
    out the sound of the neighbouring tinies, whose screeching would otherwise unhinge
    me.

    Over the years, several readers have asked me to give a clear and highly amusing
    account of the differences between Fort Hoity and Fort Toity. I suspect that such
    requests are based not on any genuine keenness to be able to tell the forts apart
    as much as a desire to have some justification for plumping for one fort over
    the other. It is, after all, a mark of the truly ''with-it'' Hooting Yardist that
    they care enough to choose Fort Hoity over Fort Toity, or, of course, Fort Toity
    over Fort Hoity. Nobody wants to admit to not giving a hoot one way or the other,
    as if they were the riffraff in the vicinity of Nameless Pond.

    But while it is easy enough to cry "Fort Hoity!" or "Fort Toity!" when asked which
    is your favourite fort, far more difficult is the supplementary question, "Why?"
    Personally, I never ask that myself. I never wish to entangle my readers in potentially
    brain-numbing mental gorse bushes. As far as I am concerned, it is enough that
    each of you has a favourite fort. But great heavens to Betsy, some of the tales
    I have heard from Hooting Yard picnics and charabanc outings and mass singalongs,
    indeed from any occasion where two or more Hooting Yard readers gather together!
    Here is one such tale, related in a letter received from one T. Thurn:

    Oh wondrous and resplendent Mr Key!

    I wish to tell you about an incident that occurred at a recent Hooting Yard outing.
    A quartet of us had gone on an otter rescue mission, but the circumstances in
    themselves are not important. When we were still some distance from the riverbank,
    one of my companions asked me which was my favourite fort, Fort Hoity or Fort
    Toity? "Fort Toity", I replied. Then she dropped a bombshell. "Why?" she asked.
    I realised I was quite unable to answer the question, as I have no idea of the
    difference between the two forts, other than a vague inkling that Fort Toity is
    a bit smaller then Fort Hoity. I was forced to dissemble. I pointed at the sky
    and yelled "Look!", hoping there would be a flock of some kind of birds visible.
    Alas, it was one of those birdless days, so I had to pretend I had spotted unusual
    patterns of light and shadow presaging the collapse and ruination of the empyrean
    realms. I got away with it this time, but I would be grateful if you could provide
    a clear and highly amusing account of the differences between Fort Hoity and Fort
    Toity so that, next time I am asked, I will be able to justify my plumping.

    Yours frolicsome, romping, giddy, and flighty,

    T. Thurn xxxx

    Must I do all the work? If T. Thurn had any strength of character he would refrain
    from bothering me with his tiresome whinges. I have gaspers to smoke and crows
    to watch and combative Teutonic din to listen to! It would be a simple enough
    matter for any true devotee to read through the collected Fort Hoity and Fort
    Toity references and to compile their own list of plumping reasons. That should
    keep you lot occupied until the morrow.'
