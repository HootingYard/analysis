  text: "\nI was pleased to note, in this week's newsletter from World Wide Words,\
    \ that Michael Quinion turns his attention to hoity-toity. He tells us that the\
    \ original meaning was \u201Cfrolicsome, romping, giddy, flighty\u201D:\nHoity-toity\
    \ derives from the long-obsolete verb hoit, meaning to \u201Cindulge in riotous\
    \ and noisy mirth\u201D (have you hoited recently? it's supposed to be very good\
    \ for you) or to \u201Cromp inelegantly\u201D (again from the OED; is it even\
    \ possible to romp elegantly?). Where hoit comes from is uncertain, although an\
    \ early form suggests a link with hoyden, which is now an unfashionable way to\
    \ describe a noisy or energetic girl but which at the time could also mean an\
    \ ignorant or clownish man. This is probably from the Middle Dutch heiden, a heath,\
    \ hence a yokel; if so, hoyden is a close relative of heathen.\nCuriously, the\
    \ estimable Mr Quinion has nothing to say about Fort Hoity and Fort Toity, the\
    \ favourite forts of Hooting Yard readers. In fact, other than a few military\
    \ history buffs and Uncle Tobys, you lot may be the only persons who actually\
    \ have favourite forts. I conducted a sort of straw poll on this matter by buttonholing\
    \ a random selection of pedestrians between here and Nameless Pond.\n\u201CExcuse\
    \ me,\u201D I said, standing in front of them so they could not pass, \u201CMay\
    \ I ask you which is your favourite fort?\u201D I did not get a single coherent\
    \ or sensible answer. Perhaps had I armed myself with a clipboard and a biro and\
    \ a high visibility jacket the results would have been different. But on the evidence\
    \ of my admittedly unscientific survey, I am forced to conclude that one hundred\
    \ percent of riffraff infesting the streets of my bailiwick early on a Saturday\
    \ morning care not a jot for forts of any kind. Some of them seemed not to know\
    \ what in heaven's name I was talking about. That is the modern education system\
    \ for you.\nAs fanatically devoted Hooting Yard readers, you already knew, or\
    \ at least suspected, that you were members of a select band. Now you have further\
    \ confirmation, in that you can most definitely claim to be among that minuscule\
    \ portion of the populace who have a favourite fort. My research, such as it is,\
    \ tells me that you are pretty evenly divided between Fort Hoity fans and aficionados\
    \ of Fort Toity. I have not analysed the stats in great detail, partly because\
    \ there aren't really any reliable stats on this matter, and partly because, even\
    \ if there were, I doubt that I am capable of the drudgery necessary to analyse\
    \ them. I have better things to do with my time, such as smoking and staring out\
    \ of the window at crows while listening to Essay On Pigs by Hans Werner Henze.\
    \ It's a godawful racket, but it drowns out the sound of the neighbouring tinies,\
    \ whose screeching would otherwise unhinge me.\nOver the years, several readers\
    \ have asked me to give a clear and highly amusing account of the differences\
    \ between Fort Hoity and Fort Toity. I suspect that such requests are based not\
    \ on any genuine keenness to be able to tell the forts apart as much as a desire\
    \ to have some justification for plumping for one fort over the other. It is,\
    \ after all, a mark of the truly \u2018with-it\u2019 Hooting Yardist that they\
    \ care enough to choose Fort Hoity over Fort Toity, or, of course, Fort Toity\
    \ over Fort Hoity. Nobody wants to admit to not giving a hoot one way or the other,\
    \ as if they were the riffraff in the vicinity of Nameless Pond.\nBut while it\
    \ is easy enough to cry \u201CFort Hoity!\u201D or \u201CFort Toity!\u201D when\
    \ asked which is your favourite fort, far more difficult is the supplementary\
    \ question, \u201CWhy?\u201D Personally, I never ask that myself. I never wish\
    \ to entangle my readers in potentially brain-numbing mental gorse bushes. As\
    \ far as I am concerned, it is enough that each of you has a favourite fort. But\
    \ great heavens to Betsy, some of the tales I have heard from Hooting Yard picnics\
    \ and charabanc outings and mass singalongs, indeed from any occasion where two\
    \ or more Hooting Yard readers gather together! Here is one such tale, related\
    \ in a letter received from one T. Thurn:\nOh wondrous and resplendent Mr Key!\n\
    I wish to tell you about an incident that occurred at a recent Hooting Yard outing.\
    \ A quartet of us had gone on an otter rescue mission, but the circumstances in\
    \ themselves are not important. When we were still some distance from the riverbank,\
    \ one of my companions asked me which was my favourite fort, Fort Hoity or Fort\
    \ Toity? \u201CFort Toity\u201D, I replied. Then she dropped a bombshell. \u201C\
    Why?\u201D she asked. I realised I was quite unable to answer the question, as\
    \ I have no idea of the difference between the two forts, other than a vague inkling\
    \ that Fort Toity is a bit smaller then Fort Hoity. I was forced to dissemble.\
    \ I pointed at the sky and yelled \u201CLook!\u201D, hoping there would be a flock\
    \ of some kind of birds visible. Alas, it was one of those birdless days, so I\
    \ had to pretend I had spotted unusual patterns of light and shadow presaging\
    \ the collapse and ruination of the empyrean realms. I got away with it this time,\
    \ but I would be grateful if you could provide a clear and highly amusing account\
    \ of the differences between Fort Hoity and Fort Toity so that, next time I am\
    \ asked, I will be able to justify my plumping.\nYours frolicsome, romping, giddy,\
    \ and flighty,\nT. Thurn xxxx\nMust I do all the work? If T. Thurn had any strength\
    \ of character he would refrain from bothering me with his tiresome whinges. I\
    \ have gaspers to smoke and crows to watch and combative Teutonic din to listen\
    \ to! It would be a simple enough matter for any true devotee to read through\
    \ the collected Fort Hoity and Fort Toity references and to compile their own\
    \ list of plumping reasons. That should keep you lot occupied until the morrow."
