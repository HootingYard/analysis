  text: "The left lung of the tyrant collapsed on the morning of the fourth. At midday,\
    \ a satrap in gorgeous uniform sparkling with embedded gems appeared on the balcony\
    \ to make an announcement. It was imperative, he said, reading from a hastily\
    \ drafted statement, that tyrannical human pneumatics become the proper study\
    \ of every citizen. By the evening, fat textbooks had been printed and bound and\
    \ consignments ferried to every city and town and village and hamlet in the land.\n\
    So rapid was the response of the satraps that the textbooks were not proofread.\
    \ A number of errors, many trivial but some calamitous, were thus allowed to stand.\
    \ But the book bore the tyrant's imprimatur and could not be questioned. As a\
    \ result, every citizen gained a flawed understanding of tyrannical human pneumatics.\n\
    The tyrant, meanwhile, had been placed inside a nylon tent. A wheezing pump imitated\
    \ the action of a working tyrannical human lung. The pump was operated by hand,\
    \ in case of a loss of electrical power caused by the evil machinations of revolutionary\
    \ scum. Pumpers were drawn from lists maintained by one of the satraps. They worked\
    \ one hour shifts, and during their rest periods were penned in an anteroom.\n\
    By the morning of the fifth, embroidered lapel accoutrements bearing a three-coloured\
    \ image of the collapsed tyrannical lung had been issued to all citizens, to be\
    \ displayed on their outer tunics. In certain hotbeds, several persons were shot\
    \ for failure to wear them. After execution, the left lungs were torn out of the\
    \ corpses and hung on gibbets in the town squares. This had a salutary effect\
    \ on the populace, even in the hotbeds.\nThe first public examination on tyrannical\
    \ human pneumatics took place at midday on the fifth in the remote town of Sand.\
    \ It was conducted orally, and tape recorded. Those gaining top marks were taken\
    \ by sealed train to the capital. A gang of revolutionaries attempted a derailment\
    \ of the train on the outskirts of Gorse. Brave conduct by the train conductor,\
    \ and foolish felled log deployment by the scum, brought their nefarious schemes\
    \ to nought. They were hanged in a barn and their left lungs torn from their corpses\
    \ and burned on a bonfire by the loyal peasants of Gorse.\nThe tyrant was told\
    \ of the narrowly averted derailment. He was as yet unable to speak, but he blinked\
    \ significantly. The blinks were interpreted and converted into text by a satrap.\
    \ Plans to have the text declaimed from the balcony were put on hold. It was considered\
    \ best to wait until after the next day, the sixth, which was Flag Day.\nOn arrival\
    \ in the capital, the top scoring tyrannical human pneumatics examinees were taken\
    \ from the sealed train in sealed trams to the National Archives. Here they stood\
    \ behind glass to watch as the tape recordings of the examinations were placed\
    \ on the register and locked in a special bomb-proof cabinet. They were then given\
    \ a snack in the canteen.\nLate in the afternoon of the fifth, Grimes \u201Cthe\
    \ Wolfman\u201D, leader of the revolutionaries, was arrested in a jungle clearing.\
    \ He was spirited to the capital by way of the subterranean pulley-car system.\
    \ Intelligence reports hinted that he had unparalleled expertise in human pneumatics,\
    \ a field closely related to tyrannical human pneumatics. Bound in chains, he\
    \ was taken to a sealed room in the palace, to where the examinees from Sand were\
    \ also brought once they had digested their snacks in the National Archives canteen.\n\
    The sixth was Flag Day. The weather was such that artificial winds were needed\
    \ to make the flags and standards and pennants billow. Further pumpers had to\
    \ be recruited from the satrap's list to ensure sufficient numbers for both the\
    \ tyrant's lung pump and the artificial wind contraptions. For a while it was\
    \ touch and go, until a keen-eyed under-satrap found a supplementary list which\
    \ had been misfiled in a filing cabinet. He was given a medal, a gorgeous disc\
    \ of brass embedded with gems that sparkled in the sunshine.\nGrimes \u201Cthe\
    \ Wolfman\u201D was undergoing a tormented moral struggle between his revolutionary\
    \ principles and his professional pride as an expert in human pneumatics. The\
    \ examinees from Sand stood gazing at him with the imploring moon-eyes of calves.\
    \ Some let tears roll slowly down their cheeks, but did not overdo the sobbing\
    \ lest Grimes thought they were making use of freshly chopped onions behind his\
    \ back. Behind a panel, certain satraps discussed the pros and cons of an amnesty\
    \ for Grimes. It was a heated discussion.\nOn the morning of the seventh a puncture\
    \ in the left lung of the tyrant was repaired and the lung was reinflated. He\
    \ was fed from a bowl of slops. Several satraps were executed and their left lungs\
    \ torn out and kicked through the broad boulevards of the capital by cheering\
    \ citizens. Grimes shaved off his beard and was given a satrapage and a gorgeous\
    \ uniform sparkling with embedded gems. A fleet of aeroplanes sprayed the jungle\
    \ with defoliant. The area was then covered with cement as far as the eye could\
    \ see. The examinees from Sand were appointed as tyrannical human pneumatics emergency\
    \ pumping supervisors and given vouchers and bungalows. A second edition of the\
    \ fat textbook was issued, with corrections. The tyrant appeared on the balcony,\
    \ propped up by a concealed prop, and waved to the teeming masses.\nOn the morning\
    \ of the eighth, the right lung of the tyrant collapsed."
