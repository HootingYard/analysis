  text: "\nBefore reading the following, gaze at the picture above for a goodly amount\
    \ of time. You may wish to enlarge it to poster size, print it out, and pin it\
    \ to your noticeboard or wall.\nThe photograph shows a boffin and a mouse. Also\
    \ shown is certain arcane laboratory equipment, and a stencilled panel marked\
    \ SPEC. NO. 40642. It is not clear whether this designation refers to the equipment,\
    \ the mouse, or the boffin. Let us not bother our little heads about it.\nAt first\
    \ glance, it appears that the boffin is studying the mouse, and making notes in\
    \ a ringbound notepad, presumably appertaining to the mouse. The mouse is encased\
    \ within some kind of lidded laboratory bowl, for which I do not doubt there is\
    \ a specific proprietary name, of which I am tragically ignorant. The bowl is\
    \ attached by a tube to the arcane laboratory equipment and also, by wire, to\
    \ something else, unseen, out of camera shot. We might spend all day lost in conjecture\
    \ about precisely what that might be.\nWe might, but we won't, because we have\
    \ other matters to attend to. Though it is a racing certainty that the above summary\
    \ is correct, and that the boffin is indeed studying the mouse, there is an alternative\
    \ possibility, albeit an unlikely one. Consider again that the boffin is quite\
    \ clearly making notes. It could be that she is not a boffin but an amanuensis,\
    \ and is actually taking dictation from the mouse. Though the general run of mice\
    \ are not gifted with human speech, this mouse might be an exception. Or it may\
    \ be that the boffin-amanuensis is gifted with an understanding of mouse squeaks,\
    \ and is able to transcribe them for the benefit of other humans not so gifted.\
    \ As I say, this is unlikely, even outlandish, but it is not beyond the bounds\
    \ of possibility.\nI would dearly love to see what is written in that notebook.\n\
    On purely pictorial evidence, we would have to swat aside my foolish mouse-dictating-to-amanuensis\
    \ scenario, if only because of the power relations implicit in the photograph.\
    \ The mouse is trapped in the bowl, whereas the boffin can presumably wander off\
    \ and skitter away to do something else, in the laboratory or outside it. Lord\
    \ knows what high jinks she might get up to when not making notes about a mouse\
    \ in a bowl!\nThere is also the indubitable fact that the boffin is much, much\
    \ bigger than the mouse. Humans almost always have the upper hand in any interaction\
    \ with mice, simply on account of the size difference. When they are so tiny and\
    \ we so huge, the matter of intellect doesn't come into it. Even if mice were\
    \ hyperintelligent, and humans dumb as oxen, we could still overpower them physically.\
    \ At least, let us hope so!\nOf course, both the scenarios I have outlined, the\
    \ almost certainly correct one and the harebrained one, may be equally flawed.\
    \ What if\u2014it is always worth asking what if?\u2014the object of study is\
    \ the boffin herself, or her interaction with the mouse? It may be that the wire\
    \ we see trailing out of the picture leads, not to some other piece of arcane\
    \ laboratory equipment, but back, under the work bench, out of our sight, and\
    \ is connected to the boffin. It may be, too, that the lidded bowl in which the\
    \ mouse is trapped is but a miniature mousy model of a much bigger lidded bowl,\
    \ in which both boffin and mouse are trapped. We may imagine similar tubes, similar\
    \ wires, protruding or feeding in to this uberbowl, calibrated and monitored by\
    \ higher boffins, one of whom is making notes in a ringbound notepad. Those notes\
    \ might pertain to the boffin only, or to the boffin and the mouse.\nThere is\
    \ a further possibility which scarcely bears thinking about, for it is all too\
    \ terrifying. What if\u2014again, what if?\u2014the higher boffins are not humans\
    \ but mice? Hyperintelligent mice, either gigantic ones from some far distant\
    \ space age planet of hyperintelligent giant mice set on conquest of the Earth,\
    \ or a teeming throng of thousands upon thousands of mouse-sized mice, whose very\
    \ numbers serve to give them an advantage over puny humankind? The object of their\
    \ study might be to ascertain how well, or ill, the boffin treats the mouse in\
    \ its little lidded bowl. Her treatment of the mouse will determine how the invading\
    \ giant space mice thereafter treat the human inhabitants of the conquered planet.\
    \ Boy o boy, this is world-shuddering stuff! The fate of millions, billions, may\
    \ depend on just what the boffin does next. If, having finished her notes, she\
    \ removes the lid from the bowl and places in it a little excelsior for the mouse\
    \ to snuggle in for a rummage and snooze, humanity may survive until the morrow.\
    \ But if she cackles and pipes into the sealed bowl, through the tube, poison\
    \ gas to fell the mouse, then we are doomed, doomed.\nThere is a personal story\
    \ here, too. Did the boffin realise, when she woke up that morning, that she held\
    \ the fate of humankind in her hands? No doubt such a thought was the furthest\
    \ thing from her mind as she tucked into her breakfast of boffins\u2019 vitamin-enriched\
    \ poptarts. Later, as she took her white lab coat out of its locker and pulled\
    \ it on, was she daydreaming of her boyfriend Dan and their imminent Alpine hiking\
    \ holiday? And then . . . and then she stepped into what she thought was a common\
    \ or garden laboratory but was in fact a giant lidded bowl, watched over and studied\
    \ by hyperintelligent intergalactic space mice, armed with ringbound notepads!\n\
    There may be further interpretations of the picture, convincing or otherwise,\
    \ which readers may wish to add in the comments. Meanwhile, I think it is up to\
    \ every one of us to decode precisely what is meant by that mysterious stencil,\
    \ SPEC. NO. 40642."
