    There are, apparently, half a million ponds in Britain. This is not nearly enough
    for the charity organisation Pond Conservation, which has plans afoot to double
    the number, presumably to the point where the country is more pond than land.
    I turn my attention to the Million Ponds Project over at The Dabbler this week.
    Warning : contains bloodsucking leeches and bloodcurdling screams.'
