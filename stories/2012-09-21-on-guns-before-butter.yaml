  text: 'I have been watching, with something akin to hysterical overexcitement, reruns
    of the long-running television game show Guns Before Butter. It really is the
    most fantastic example of Bismarckian light entertainment ever devised. As is
    often the case with these things, the basic format is very, very simple, one might
    almost say simple-minded. A contestant, plucked from the studio audience, is faced
    with two small tables. On one table is a stack of guns, on the other a packet
    of butter. All they have to do is choose. If they choose correctly, they win a
    souvenir propelling pencil and a spiked helmet. If they choose incorrectly, the
    studio audience hisses and boos, and the shamed contestant is bundled backstage
    to face who knows what godawful fate. The simplicity of the game lies in the fact
    that, of course, the guns are always the correct choice. That much is evident
    from the show''s title.

    One might think that the format drains any possible dramatic tension from the
    show. Nothing could be further from the truth. As each new contestant is hustled
    on to the stage to be embraced in a bear hug by the smarmy host, one never knows
    if they will have sufficient wit to chose guns before butter. I have been unable
    to gain clearance to show a clip here, so I have done the next best thing and
    made a partial transcript of a typical episode.

    Smarmy Host : And let''s have a big and deafening round of applause for our next
    contestant!

    [Big, deafening, round of applause. Hooters, klaxons, screaming.]

    Smarmy Host : And your name is?

    Contestant : Horst.

    Smarmy Host : And where are you from, Horst?

    Contestant : Obergrumpelschwittenzollern, Trevor.

    Smarmy Host : Fantastic! And what do you do for a living in Obergrumpelschwittenzollern,
    Horst?

    Contestant : I have a small business manufacturing cowbells.

    Smarmy Host : Fantastic! And I believe your lovely wife and lovely children are
    with you here tonight, is that right?

    Contestant : That''s right, Brian

    [Camera shot of lovely wife and lovely children in audience.]

    Smarmy Host : Well let''s hope you do them proud, Horst. Are you ready to play
    . . .

    [Dramatic drumroll.]

    Smarmy Host : . . . Guns Before Butter!?

    Contestant : [Swallowing nervously] Yes I am, Alan.

    [Smarmy Host ushers Contestant towards a curtain, which sweeps back to reveal
    two small tables. On one is a stack of guns, on the other a packet of butter.]

    Smarmy Host : Okay, Horst. I''m sure you know the rules, but let''s just run through
    them again for the viewers at home. There are two tables. On one is a stack of
    guns, and on the other is a packet of butter. All you have to do is to choose,
    either the guns or the butter. You''ve got that?

    Contestant : Yes, I think so.

    Smarmy Host : Remember, guns or butter. You can only choose one.

    Contestant : Yes.

    Smarmy Host : Okay. Let''s play . . . Guns Before Butter! Horst, you have one
    minute, starting . . . now!

    [Big clock starts to tock noisily. Contestant looks solemn, gazing from one table
    to another.]

    Smarmy Host : It''s your choice, Horst. Take your time. You still have fifty seconds.

    [Contestant dithers.]

    Smarmy Host : It looks so easy when you''re watching at home, doesn''t it?

    Contestant : Phew! Yes, Ted, that''s right.

    Smarmy Host : Forty seconds, Horst.

    [Contestant looks as if he is about to choose, then dithers a bit more.]

    Contestant : There''s part of me that wants to go for the guns, but . . .

    Smarmy Host : Thirty seconds, Horst. Half way to the bell. It''s louder and more
    resonant than one of your cowbells, I expect.

    Contestant : [Chuckling] I expect so, Dax.

    Smarmy Host : What do you think the good folk of Obergrumpelschwittenzollern are
    yelling at their television screens right now, Horst?

    Contestant : I wish I knew, Graham!

    Smarmy Host : Fifteen seconds.

    Contestant : Okay, okay. I think I''m going to go for . . .[Dithers again]

    Smarmy Host : Ten seconds.

    Contestant : Um . . .

    Smarmy Host : Nine . . . eight . . . seven . . .

    Contestant : Okay! I''m going to choose butter, Bob.

    Smarmy Host : You choose butter? Is that your final decision?

    Contestant : Yes . . . butter!

    [Loud, resonant bell clangs. Audience silent as the grave.]

    Smarmy Host : That''s your time up, Horst. You chose butter. Well I can tell you
    now . . . butter was the . . . [extends pause to wring as much tension from the
    situation as conceivably possible, then pauses a bit more] . . . wrong answer,
    Horst!

    [Audience groans, then starts to hiss and boo.]

    Smarmy Host : I''m sorry, Horst. The correct choice was guns, as it always is
    on Guns Before Butter. But you weren''t to know that. Well, actually, you were,
    so you must just be incredibly, incredibly stupid.

    Contestant : I suppose so, Rolf.

    Smarmy Host : You''ve been a great contestant, Horst. Let''s have a bloodcurdling
    din of hisses and boos for Horst!

    [Brutes appear onstage and bustle Horst away, to face who knows what godawful
    fate.]

    I have written to dozens of television light entertainment commissioning editors
    pleading with them to revive the show, thus far without success.

    STOP PRESS : One of my letters might have paid off! It was apparently retrieved
    from a waste paper bin by Stephen Fry on one of his regular night-time prowls
    around commissioning editors'' offices. He is reportedly planning a dumbed-down
    version of Guns Before Butter for BBC Radio Four. Marcus Brigstocke, David Mitchell,
    and Alan Titchmarsh have already been lined up as contestants.'
