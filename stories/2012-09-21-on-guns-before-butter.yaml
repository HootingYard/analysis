  text: "I have been watching, with something akin to hysterical overexcitement, reruns\
    \ of the long-running television game show Guns Before Butter. It really is the\
    \ most fantastic example of Bismarckian light entertainment ever devised. As is\
    \ often the case with these things, the basic format is very, very simple, one\
    \ might almost say simple-minded. A contestant, plucked from the studio audience,\
    \ is faced with two small tables. On one table is a stack of guns, on the other\
    \ a packet of butter. All they have to do is choose. If they choose correctly,\
    \ they win a souvenir propelling pencil and a spiked helmet. If they choose incorrectly,\
    \ the studio audience hisses and boos, and the shamed contestant is bundled backstage\
    \ to face who knows what godawful fate. The simplicity of the game lies in the\
    \ fact that, of course, the guns are always the correct choice. That much is evident\
    \ from the show's title.\nOne might think that the format drains any possible\
    \ dramatic tension from the show. Nothing could be further from the truth. As\
    \ each new contestant is hustled on to the stage to be embraced in a bear hug\
    \ by the smarmy host, one never knows if they will have sufficient wit to chose\
    \ guns before butter. I have been unable to gain clearance to show a clip here,\
    \ so I have done the next best thing and made a partial transcript of a typical\
    \ episode.\nSmarmy Host : And let's have a big and deafening round of applause\
    \ for our next contestant!\n[Big, deafening, round of applause. Hooters, klaxons,\
    \ screaming.]\nSmarmy Host : And your name is?\nContestant\_: Horst.\nSmarmy Host\_\
    : And where are you from, Horst?\nContestant\_: Obergrumpelschwittenzollern, Trevor.\n\
    Smarmy Host : Fantastic! And what do you do for a living in Obergrumpelschwittenzollern,\
    \ Horst?\nContestant : I have a small business manufacturing cowbells.\nSmarmy\
    \ Host : Fantastic! And I believe your lovely wife and lovely children are with\
    \ you here tonight, is that right?\nContestant : That's right, Brian\n[Camera\
    \ shot of lovely wife and lovely children in audience.]\nSmarmy Host\_: Well let's\
    \ hope you do them proud, Horst. Are you ready to play . . .\n[Dramatic drumroll.]\n\
    Smarmy Host\_: . . . Guns Before Butter!?\nContestant\_: [Swallowing nervously]\
    \ Yes I am, Alan.\n[Smarmy Host ushers Contestant towards a curtain, which sweeps\
    \ back to reveal two small tables. On one is a stack of guns, on the other a packet\
    \ of butter.]\nSmarmy Host\_: Okay, Horst. I'm sure you know the rules, but let's\
    \ just run through them again for the viewers at home. There are two tables. On\
    \ one is a stack of guns, and on the other is a packet of butter. All you have\
    \ to do is to choose, either the guns or the butter. You've got that?\nContestant\
    \ : Yes, I think so.\nSmarmy Host\_: Remember, guns or butter. You can only choose\
    \ one.\nContestant\_: Yes.\nSmarmy Host\_: Okay. Let's play . . . Guns Before\
    \ Butter! Horst, you have one minute, starting . . . now!\n[Big clock starts to\
    \ tock noisily. Contestant looks solemn, gazing from one table to another.]\n\
    Smarmy Host\_: It's your choice, Horst. Take your time. You still have fifty seconds.\n\
    [Contestant dithers.]\nSmarmy Host : It looks so easy when you're watching at\
    \ home, doesn't it?\nContestant\_: Phew! Yes, Ted, that's right.\nSmarmy Host\_\
    : Forty seconds, Horst.\n[Contestant looks as if he is about to choose, then dithers\
    \ a bit more.]\nContestant\_: There's part of me that wants to go for the guns,\
    \ but . . .\nSmarmy Host\_: Thirty seconds, Horst. Half way to the bell. It's\
    \ louder and more resonant than one of your cowbells, I expect.\nContestant\_\
    : [Chuckling] I expect so, Dax.\nSmarmy Host\_: What do you think the good folk\
    \ of Obergrumpelschwittenzollern are yelling at their television screens right\
    \ now, Horst?\nContestant\_: I wish I knew, Graham!\nSmarmy Host : Fifteen seconds.\n\
    Contestant\_: Okay, okay. I think I'm going to go for . . .[Dithers again]\nSmarmy\
    \ Host : Ten seconds.\nContestant : Um . . .\nSmarmy Host\_: Nine . . . eight\
    \ . . . seven . . .\nContestant\_: Okay! I'm going to choose butter, Bob.\nSmarmy\
    \ Host : You choose butter? Is that your final decision?\nContestant\_: Yes .\
    \ . . butter!\n[Loud, resonant bell clangs. Audience silent as the grave.]\nSmarmy\
    \ Host\_: That's your time up, Horst. You chose butter. Well I can tell you now\
    \ . . . butter was the . . . [extends pause to wring as much tension from the\
    \ situation as conceivably possible, then pauses a bit more] . . . wrong answer,\
    \ Horst!\n[Audience groans, then starts to hiss and boo.]\nSmarmy Host\_: I'm\
    \ sorry, Horst. The correct choice was guns, as it always is on Guns Before Butter.\
    \ But you weren't to know that. Well, actually, you were, so you must just be\
    \ incredibly, incredibly stupid.\nContestant\_: I suppose so, Rolf.\nSmarmy Host\_\
    : You've been a great contestant, Horst. Let's have a bloodcurdling din of hisses\
    \ and boos for Horst!\n[Brutes appear onstage and bustle Horst away, to face who\
    \ knows what godawful fate.]\nI have written to dozens of television light entertainment\
    \ commissioning editors pleading with them to revive the show, thus far without\
    \ success.\nSTOP PRESS\_: One of my letters might have paid off! It was apparently\
    \ retrieved from a waste paper bin by Stephen Fry on one of his regular night-time\
    \ prowls around commissioning editors\u2019 offices. He is reportedly planning\
    \ a dumbed-down version of Guns Before Butter for BBC Radio Four. Marcus Brigstocke,\
    \ David Mitchell, and Alan Titchmarsh have already been lined up as contestants."
