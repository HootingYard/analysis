  text: 'Apparently, the Grunty Man, that figure of childhood nightmares, has a song.
    It begins:

    I grunt at the sun, I grunt at the moon, my grunts do not follow a tune.

    I grunt at the stars, I grunt at the sky, my grunting makes household pets die.

    One day in March 1967, the Grunty Man went into a recording studio. He was accompanied
    by a hand-picked gaggle of musicians who later became some of the biggest names
    in prog rock, including future members of Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer, and Spooky
    Tooth. Also present was the youthful Gordon Sumner, now known to the world as
    ''Stig'' [sic], who was drafted in for his ability to whine in a high-pitched
    caterwaul. I say they were hand-picked, but in fact the Grunty Man arranged for
    each muso to be plucked from their mundane doldrums by the Claw of Gack. It was
    an experience none of them ever forgot.

    Eschewing the use of a producer or sound engineer, the Grunty Man barred and bolted
    the studio doors and whirled about in a grunting frenzy until all the musicians
    were suitably cowed. It would be unkind to state which of the ELP trio was so
    frightened that he hid in a cupboard and piddled in his loon pants until coaxed
    out with the promise of Garibaldi biscuits.

    Ten thousand years old and covered in sores, the Grunty Man had recently started
    to use a guide dog. This dog, Alan, was some kind of beagle, and was hopelessly
    inadequate for its task. It was blind itself, in one eye, suffered from muscle
    spasms and liver failure, and harboured a doggy desire to take part in the space
    programme rather than have to drag around with the Grunty Man. It spent most of
    the recording session curled up inside Carl Palmer''s bass drum, dreaming of the
    stars.

    The Grunty Man decided to call his one-off band Ruddiman''s Rudiments, after the
    Latin primer used by generations of schoolchildren. With such a name, he thought,
    he would not be dismissed merely as a grotesque grunting ogre from the earth''s
    primeval past, but as a somewhat more sophisticated being. Having a hit record
    would give him even more charisma, and his long-cherished desire to win social
    acceptance would be fulfilled. Perhaps he wanted too much.

    Certainly the auspices were not good, as the band huddled in a corner of the studio
    quaking with terror, Alan snoozed, and no one bothered to locate the light switches.
    When little Sumner whimpered that they would need at least some light to work
    by, the Grunty Man unleashed great bellows of his sulphurous, phosphorescent breath.
    The studio was lit by a dim green mist which hung in the air, and the band stumbled
    reluctantly to their positions.They ran through the music a few times, but never
    to the Grunty Man''s satisfaction.

    "Less Herman''s Hermits! More Scriabin!" he shouted, and as they could not understand
    his grunts, he clawed the words onto the walls with his talons. But none of the
    band, not even the bombastically-inclined future Emerson Lake & Palmer, were familiar
    with the works of the Russian composer*, and they stuck to a toothsome sort of
    pop pap. The Grunty Man kept bellowing to maintain the phosphorescent light levels.
    Alan woke up briefly and savaged Carl Palmer''s piddle-stained loon pants. And
    then a janitor arrived.

    Old Ted Cargpan''s intention was to throw the intruders out of the studio. In
    the event, he saved the situation. Completely calm in the face of the hideous
    Grunty Man, and contemptuous of the young musicians, he at once sized up the scene,
    set the tapes running, and put the whole lot of them through their paces. Even
    the Grunty Man deferred to the janitor, retreating to a spot up in the rafters
    and allowing the little Sumner boy to take on the lead vocal, while Alan the guide
    dog, refreshed after his nap, howled backing.The instrumentalists, too, seemed
    energised by the crusty old janitor''s presence, Greg Lake in particular demonstrating
    the sort of skills that would, in a few years time, make Brain Salad Surgery such
    a millstone. Sorry, I meant to type ''milestone''.

    The track finished, Old Ted Cargpan sent the musicians packing and brought the
    Grunty Man down from his perch near the ceiling to record the B-side, a duet with
    Alan the guide dog. The Grunty Man grunted, Alan slobbered, and the janitor moulded
    their din into a majestic three minute miniature rock opera, subsequently plagiarised
    by everybody from Ultravox to swan-eating Peter Maxwell Davies.

    So whatever happened to the recordings? Some say that the adult Gordon Sumner,
    wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice but still, as a middle-aged man, calling
    himself ''Stig'', opposed any reissue of the disc and even had the master tapes
    destroyed. Another rumour has it that Alan the guide dog somehow managed, in 1977,
    to get himself blasted towards Saturn on a space rocket, and took the tapes with
    him. The Grunty Man himself remains silent on the subject, merely grunting horribly
    in his cave, or next to his pond, haunting the nightmares of tiny children, tuneless
    once more, and resigned to his immortal fate.

    * NOTE : Much of the work of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915)
    was written for piano. This is surprising when one considers how tiny his hands
    were. Indeed, there were two occasions during his short, fraught life when he
    injured them while relentlessly practising piano pieces which called for hands
    larger than his own.

    Tiny his hands may have been, but this puny neurasthenic Russian cultivated a
    pair of decisive mustachios.


    Among his orchestral works, the Poem of Ecstasy, opus 54, is a supremely bonkers
    piece which, long before Spinal Tap, goes up to eleven. One critic imagined he
    was hearing a graphic portrayal of the players all having sex with each other.
    Another refers to the "malignant sneers from muted trombones... was music ever
    more evil-sounding"?

    Not everyone appreciated Scriabin at the time, of course. The man who was chosen
    to conduct the premiere of his Second Symphony complained "After Scriabin, Wagner
    lisps sweetly like a suckling babe. I think that I will go mad any moment now.
    Where can one hide from such music? Help me!"

    My favourite Scriabin piece is the Mysterium. This was designed as a total art
    work, involving an orchestra, dance, light, and exotic perfumes, to be performed
    in the Himalayas, its playing ushering in Armageddon. Mysterium would be "a grandiose
    religious synthesis of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world" and
    the emergence of a Nietzschean Superman. Whether this Superman would have tiny
    little hands and decisive mustachios we do not know, for Scriabin succumbed to
    septicemia when the composition was barely begun. It thus has a place in the museum
    of lost or non-existent works of art, about which I shall write more soon.
