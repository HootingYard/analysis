  text: "Apparently, the Grunty Man, that figure of childhood nightmares, has a song.\
    \ It begins:\nI grunt at the sun, I grunt at the moon, my grunts do not follow\
    \ a tune.\nI grunt at the stars, I grunt at the sky, my grunting makes household\
    \ pets die.\nOne day in March 1967, the Grunty Man went into a recording studio.\
    \ He was accompanied by a hand-picked gaggle of musicians who later became some\
    \ of the biggest names in prog rock, including future members of Yes, Emerson\
    \ Lake & Palmer, and Spooky Tooth. Also present was the youthful Gordon Sumner,\
    \ now known to the world as \u2018Stig\u2019 [sic], who was drafted in for his\
    \ ability to whine in a high-pitched caterwaul. I say they were hand-picked, but\
    \ in fact the Grunty Man arranged for each muso to be plucked from their mundane\
    \ doldrums by the Claw of Gack. It was an experience none of them ever forgot.\n\
    Eschewing the use of a producer or sound engineer, the Grunty Man barred and bolted\
    \ the studio doors and whirled about in a grunting frenzy until all the musicians\
    \ were suitably cowed. It would be unkind to state which of the ELP trio was so\
    \ frightened that he hid in a cupboard and piddled in his loon pants until coaxed\
    \ out with the promise of Garibaldi biscuits.\nTen thousand years old and covered\
    \ in sores, the Grunty Man had recently started to use a guide dog. This dog,\
    \ Alan, was some kind of beagle, and was hopelessly inadequate for its task. It\
    \ was blind itself, in one eye, suffered from muscle spasms and liver failure,\
    \ and harboured a doggy desire to take part in the space programme rather than\
    \ have to drag around with the Grunty Man. It spent most of the recording session\
    \ curled up inside Carl Palmer's bass drum, dreaming of the stars.\nThe Grunty\
    \ Man decided to call his one-off band Ruddiman's Rudiments, after the Latin primer\
    \ used by generations of schoolchildren. With such a name, he thought, he would\
    \ not be dismissed merely as a grotesque grunting ogre from the earth's primeval\
    \ past, but as a somewhat more sophisticated being. Having a hit record would\
    \ give him even more charisma, and his long-cherished desire to win social acceptance\
    \ would be fulfilled. Perhaps he wanted too much.\nCertainly the auspices were\
    \ not good, as the band huddled in a corner of the studio quaking with terror,\
    \ Alan snoozed, and no one bothered to locate the light switches. When little\
    \ Sumner whimpered that they would need at least some light to work by, the Grunty\
    \ Man unleashed great bellows of his sulphurous, phosphorescent breath. The studio\
    \ was lit by a dim green mist which hung in the air, and the band stumbled reluctantly\
    \ to their positions.They ran through the music a few times, but never to the\
    \ Grunty Man's satisfaction.\n\u201CLess Herman's Hermits! More Scriabin!\u201D\
    \ he shouted, and as they could not understand his grunts, he clawed the words\
    \ onto the walls with his talons. But none of the band, not even the bombastically-inclined\
    \ future Emerson Lake & Palmer, were familiar with the works of the Russian composer*,\
    \ and they stuck to a toothsome sort of pop pap. The Grunty Man kept bellowing\
    \ to maintain the phosphorescent light levels. Alan woke up briefly and savaged\
    \ Carl Palmer's piddle-stained loon pants. And then a janitor arrived.\nOld Ted\
    \ Cargpan's intention was to throw the intruders out of the studio. In the event,\
    \ he saved the situation. Completely calm in the face of the hideous Grunty Man,\
    \ and contemptuous of the young musicians, he at once sized up the scene, set\
    \ the tapes running, and put the whole lot of them through their paces. Even the\
    \ Grunty Man deferred to the janitor, retreating to a spot up in the rafters and\
    \ allowing the little Sumner boy to take on the lead vocal, while Alan the guide\
    \ dog, refreshed after his nap, howled backing.The instrumentalists, too, seemed\
    \ energised by the crusty old janitor's presence, Greg Lake in particular demonstrating\
    \ the sort of skills that would, in a few years time, make Brain Salad Surgery\
    \ such a millstone. Sorry, I meant to type \u2018milestone\u2019.\nThe track finished,\
    \ Old Ted Cargpan sent the musicians packing and brought the Grunty Man down from\
    \ his perch near the ceiling to record the B-side, a duet with Alan the guide\
    \ dog. The Grunty Man grunted, Alan slobbered, and the janitor moulded their din\
    \ into a majestic three minute miniature rock opera, subsequently plagiarised\
    \ by everybody from Ultravox to swan-eating Peter Maxwell Davies.\nSo whatever\
    \ happened to the recordings? Some say that the adult Gordon Sumner, wealthy beyond\
    \ the dreams of avarice but still, as a middle-aged man, calling himself \u2018\
    Stig\u2019, opposed any reissue of the disc and even had the master tapes destroyed.\
    \ Another rumour has it that Alan the guide dog somehow managed, in 1977, to get\
    \ himself blasted towards Saturn on a space rocket, and took the tapes with him.\
    \ The Grunty Man himself remains silent on the subject, merely grunting horribly\
    \ in his cave, or next to his pond, haunting the nightmares of tiny children,\
    \ tuneless once more, and resigned to his immortal fate.\n* NOTE\_: Much of the\
    \ work of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872\u20131915) was written\
    \ for piano. This is surprising when one considers how tiny his hands were. Indeed,\
    \ there were two occasions during his short, fraught life when he injured them\
    \ while relentlessly practising piano pieces which called for hands larger than\
    \ his own.\nTiny his hands may have been, but this puny neurasthenic Russian cultivated\
    \ a pair of decisive mustachios.\n\nAmong his orchestral works, the Poem of Ecstasy,\
    \ opus 54, is a supremely bonkers piece which, long before Spinal Tap, goes up\
    \ to eleven. One critic imagined he was hearing a graphic portrayal of the players\
    \ all having sex with each other. Another refers to the \u201Cmalignant sneers\
    \ from muted trombones\u2026 was music ever more evil-sounding\u201D?\nNot everyone\
    \ appreciated Scriabin at the time, of course. The man who was chosen to conduct\
    \ the premiere of his Second Symphony complained \u201CAfter Scriabin, Wagner\
    \ lisps sweetly like a suckling babe. I think that I will go mad any moment now.\
    \ Where can one hide from such music? Help me!\u201D\nMy favourite Scriabin piece\
    \ is the Mysterium. This was designed as a total art work, involving an orchestra,\
    \ dance, light, and exotic perfumes, to be performed in the Himalayas, its playing\
    \ ushering in Armageddon. Mysterium would be \u201Ca grandiose religious synthesis\
    \ of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world\u201D and the emergence\
    \ of a Nietzschean Superman. Whether this Superman would have tiny little hands\
    \ and decisive mustachios we do not know, for Scriabin succumbed to septicemia\
    \ when the composition was barely begun. It thus has a place in the museum of\
    \ lost or non-existent works of art, about which I shall write more soon.\n[Previously\
    \ posted in 2006.]"
