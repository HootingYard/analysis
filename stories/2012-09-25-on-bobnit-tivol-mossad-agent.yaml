  text: 'Mossad! They''re Israeli, they''re a secret intelligence service, their agents
    fan out across the globe engaging in skulduggery including the targeted assassinaton
    of ne''er-do-wells! What''s not to like? If I had my life over again, I think
    I''d like to have been a Mossad agent. Granted, I am not Jewish, I am a bit weedy
    and very myopic, and when once I attempted to play the online game based on the
    BBC serial Spooks I found it impossible to progress beyond the preliminary screen,
    but a man can dream.


    Confidential papers recently released under the Release Of Confidential Papers
    Pertaining To Fictional Athletes Act reveal the startling information that none
    other than fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol was a Mossad agent. Who would have thought
    it? His all too real coach and mentor Old Halob would have been a more probable
    candidate, what with his murky past and trenchcoat and Homburg hat. Yet now we
    learn that all along it was the spindly fictional sprinter who was the Mossad
    agent. Old Halob had not the merest inkling of his protege''s secret activities.

    The world o'' sport is of course the perfect cover for espionage. A tiptop sprinter
    like Bobnit Tivol will be forever flying around the world from one athletics meet
    to another, an entourage in tow. When he is a pole-vaulter as well as a sprinter,
    he will have a good deal of "kit" to cart about with him. You might be surprised
    at just how many high-velocity sniper rifles, laid end to end, would equal the
    length of the average pole-vaulter''s pole.

    Bobnit Tivol had the added advantage of being fictional, which meant that his
    Mossad "handlers" could easily invent brand new cover stories for him for each
    operation on which he was sent. In those days, athletics was still chiefly the
    realm of amateurs. Bobnit Tivol might fly into Helsinki, say, posing as a dentist
    and amateur sprinter and pole-vaulter, and while there, absent himself for a couple
    of hours from the cinder track to pop across town to a Helsinki hotbed of ne''er-do-wellery
    and, with ruthless Mossad efficiency, use a high-velocity sniper rifle to "take
    out" several Helsinki ne''er-do-wells who were, for whatever reason, on the Mossad
    hit-list. Or he might fly into Hobart, posing as an ornithologist and amateur
    sprinter and pole-vaulter, and while there, absent himself for a couple of hours
    from the cinder track to pop across town to a Hobart hotbed of ne''er-do-wellery
    and, with ruthless Mossad efficiency, use a razor-sharp hatchet to "take out"
    several Hobart ne''er-do-wells who were, for a similar reason, on the Mossad hit-list.
    In Helsinki and Hobart, his cover as an amateur athlete, taking part in a sprint
    and a vault at the same time as he was registered as a participant in a dentistry
    or ornithological conference, would pull the wool over the eyes of local law enforcement,
    who would scratch their heads in dimwitted consternation and be thankful that
    some of their home-grown ne''er-do-wells had been so ruthlessly and efficiently
    despatched. The very last person they would look for would be a spindly fictional
    athlete in baggy shorts.

    Ironically, on several occasions suspicion did fall on Old Halob. With his murky
    past and trenchcoat and Homburg hat, and above all his brute non-fictional reality,
    he was the kind of person dimwitted local law enforcement officials would haul
    in for questioning when, for example, a gaggle of ne''er-do-wells were found garrotted
    in a cellar beneath a hotbed of ne''er-do-wellery in, say, Helsinki or Hobart.
    And wherever fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol went, his coach Old Halob would invariably
    be there too, stop-watch in hand, chain-smoking high-tar Serbian cigarettes. So
    it happened on more than one occasion that, while Bobnit Tivol was pounding round
    and round and round and round the running track, or vaulting over the bar into
    the sandpit, Old Halob would be dragged from the side of the track or the pit
    and bundled into the back of a police van.

    Because he was not himself a Mossad agent, Mossad did not provide Old Halob with
    any kind of cover story. The sole account he was able to give of himself, in various
    Helsinki or Hobart interrogation chambers, was that he was the all too real coach
    and mentor of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. Look, he would splutter, in between
    catarrh-racked coughing fits, here is my stop-watch! Here is my fictional athletics
    meeting accreditation! I may look, sound, and act like a Stalinist secret policeman,
    as indeed I may once have been, possibly, but that does not make me a ruthlessly
    efficient Mossad agent! Unhand me this instant!

    Sooner or later, the dimwitted local law enforcement officials would let him go.
    He usually had to find his own way back to the athletics stadium, and was thus
    in an even fouler temper than usual when he got back just in time to watch his
    protege winning, or failing to win, a sprint race or pole-vault jump.

    The release of these papers will allow diligent researchers to tidy up various
    unsolved killings of ne''er-do-wells around the globe over several decades. By
    matching the killings to fictional athletics meetings in which Bobnit Tivol participated,
    we might see the hand of Mossad where it has been least suspected. New light,
    too, should be cast on Bobnit Tivol''s fictional Memoirs. It goes without saying
    that the spindly fictional athlete never openly acknowledged his role as a Mossad
    agent--he was too ruthless and efficient ever to make such a slip--but a thorough
    rereading, and even more thorough rerereading, may grant us a new perspective
    on the history of the second half of the twentieth century. If nothing else, we
    might be able to cobble together a convincing explanation of the targeted assassination
    of Gliptow and his ne''er-do-well pals in their HQ slap bang next to the athletics
    stadium in Helsinki (or possibly Hobart) in May 1968, when the world''s attention
    was diverted by shouty students throwing pebbles at the gendarmerie.'
