    Digest. This one is from her invaluable series "The Expectorations Of Various
    Quadruped Beasts". Permission to reproduce it here was granted after I made a
    donation to Miss Blossom Partridge''s Lovely Bucolic Donkey Sanctuary. Though
    small, the donation exacted was double the amount paid for permission to post
    Miss Blossom Partridge''s piece on giant albino kangaroos. I have decided to set
    up a fund to meet what I fear may be ever-increasing costs demanded by the mysterious
    Dr Grimes, who claims to be Miss Blossom Partridge''s accountant. If you would
    like to contribute, and so guarantee the opportunity to read more of her excellent
    work, please whack that PayPal button over on the right of the screen and give
    generously.


    Last week in Miss Blossom Partridge''s Weekly Digest we considered the sputum
    of giraffes, so this week, following the extremely complicated scheme devised
    for this series, we turn inevitably to the spittle of donkeys. We looked at giraffe
    sputum in a necessarily abstract, theoretical manner, but when it comes to the
    spittle of donkeys we are going to take a more practical approach, so roll up
    your sleeves, wash your hands with swarfega, and let''s get down to business!

    The first thing you need to do is to find some donkeys. Do not for one minute
    think you can come a-trespassing in my Lovely Bucolic Donkey Sanctuary, however!
    It is surrounded by an electrified fence and every hundred yards or so there is
    a watchtower in which is perched one of my sentries armed with a high-velocity
    sniper''s rifle. Step over the whitewashed line parallel to the fence and you
    will be shot in the centre of your forehead. I do not bandy about the word "sanctuary"
    loosely.

    Far better that you go to the seaside, where donkeys are often to be found giving
    rides along the beach to overexcited tinies. The seaside donkeymaster may not
    take kindly to you collecting spittle from one of his donkeys, so what you will
    need to do is to lure one away from the pack. Pick a donkey that is not, at the
    time, laden with a squealing infant on its back. A small bale of straw ought to
    be sufficient temptation for the donkey, but you will need to ensure the donkeymaster''s
    attention is distracted. This can be accomplished by, for example, setting fire
    to an ice cream kiosk elsewhere on the beach. While the donkeymaster is gazing,
    open-mouthed at the conflagration, wave the small bale of straw in the face of
    your chosen donkey and lure it away until you are concealed by sand dunes or some
    similar seaside beach feature.

    Do not fret your little head about being charged with donkey abduction. Once you
    have collected its spittle, you are going to return the donkey whence you found
    it, no harm done. Before so returning it, you will again need to divert the donkeymaster''s
    attention. For this purpose, it can be useful to have an accomplice, a stooge
    who swims out to sea and then pretends to be drowning, frantically waving their
    arms and shouting. But we are leaping ahead of ourselves.

    Duly hidden behind dunes, or similar, you can begin to feed handfuls of straw
    to the donkey. As it munches, spittle will be produced from various glands in
    its mouth. I will not go into the precise physiological details. Just bear with
    me. Now, while with one hand you tear off portions of straw from the bale and
    stuff them into the donkey''s mouth, with your other hand you should be holding
    a bowl under its chin to collect such spittle as it dribbles and drools. Remember
    that some donkeys slobber while eating more than others, and do not hit any panic
    buttons. Provided the donkey munches straw for about ten minutes, it should almost
    certainly produce sufficient spittle to fill your bowl, if not to the brim then
    as near as dammit.

    When you are happy with the amount of donkey spittle in your bowl, transfer it
    to a flask by means of a siphon and funnel. Pat the donkey on its head to show
    your appreciation. Then use your walkie-talkie to alert your accomplice, who should
    come scampering out of a chalet in his swimming costume and hare across the beach
    and plunge into the sea and swim out and then pretend to be drowning and wave
    and scream. Peering out from behind the dunes, make sure the donkeymaster is distracted,
    and lead the donkey back, inserting it among the other donkeys as if it had never
    been away. If an infant is loitering nearby, pick it up and plop it on to the
    donkey''s back. Thus, when the donkeymaster turns around to scan his donkeys,
    he will be even less likely to think one of them has been lured away behind the
    sand dunes to have its spittle collected. You can now go home.

    In your kitchenette, pour the donkey spittle out of the flask into a container.
    There will almost certainly be a few strands of munched straw intermingled with
    the spittle, so pick them out with a pair of tweezers and discard them in your
    bin. Do the same with any other foreign bodies that have found their way into
    the container until you have one hundred percent pure donkey spittle. This can
    then be used for a vast range of different purposes, most of which hark back centuries
    and have come down to us through rustic lore and wisdom.

    While you ponder to precisely what purpose you intend to put the spittle of the
    donkey, take a moment to thank your lucky stars that you live in an enlightened
    age. Had you been found poring over a container of donkey spittle at virtually
    any time in those past centuries, you would have been burned as a witch.'
