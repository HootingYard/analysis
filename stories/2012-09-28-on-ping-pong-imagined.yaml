  text: 'In his fascinating new book, beardy intellectual gadfly Slobodan Gadfly posits
    a world in which the game of ping pong does not exist. He then proceeds to "invent"
    it through the power of imagination. It would be easy to dismiss the work as pointless
    pseudointellectual twaddle, and many critics have adopted precisely that line.
    Here, for example, is Rolf Gutentag, writing in The Pingpongist:

    Seldom have I read such a blithering farrago of drivel. My cat could write a more
    sensible book than this. In fact, he has done. Meat In Jelly, Daytime Naps, And
    The Torture Of Birds is available now from all good bookshops. But I digress.
    Even if we accept Mr Gadfly''s preposterous premise of a ping pong-less universe,
    must we be subjected to page after page of his strenuous mental groping towards
    some sort of fully-imagined tabletop-based indoor sport played with bats and lightweight
    balls? As if that were not piffling enough, there is further piffle in store,
    in the shape of an entire chapter devoted to a wholly imaginary scoring system
    which turns out, on close inspection, to be identical to the actual scoring system
    used in actual games of ping pong in the actual world.

    Gutentag is positively enthusiastic in comparison to Seebohm "Not Susan" Sontag,
    writing in The New Pingpongist:

    Never, ever, in all my days, have I read such a blithering farrago of drivel.
    As soon as I finished reading it, I burned it. Then I went out to the bookshop
    where I had bought it and burned all the copies they had in stock. Then, for good
    measure, I burned down the bookshop. As the flames licked the sky, I held in one
    hand a ping pong bat and in the other hand a ping pong ball, and when the fire
    brigade arrived, with bells clanging, I challenged every man jack of them to a
    game of ping pong. Look!, I was saying, the game exists! Why pretend it doesn''t
    and then try to imagine it? The fire brigade could only nod in agreement, thus
    proving the utter futility of Gadfly''s thesis.

    I cannot help but think that Messrs Gutentag and Sontag are missing the point
    of the book. Quite what that point is I am not sure myself, but I have neither
    the time nor the inclination to worry my little head about such niceties. And
    it is indeed a little head, not much bigger than a ping pong ball, on account
    of certain mishaps in the maternity ward where I was born. I am often asked if
    life has presented me with insurmountable difficulties due to my tiny, white,
    and almost spherical head, and my invariable answer is "no, it has not", for I
    carry myself with aplomb and meet the astonished gazes of those I encounter with
    a steely gaze of my own. If they continue to gaze, or to prod me with their fingers
    as if I were a circus freak, I take from my pocket the ping pong bat I always
    carry about my person and I thump them smartly on the head with it, several times.

    I do not think it is necessary to understand the point of Mr Gadfly''s book to
    enjoy it. I would go further, and say it is not necessary to understand the point
    of any book to enjoy it. What, after all, is the point of Rolf Gutentag''s cat''s
    book? Does it give us new insights into feline life? It does not. Does it, more
    importantly, tell us of a cat''s approach to the game of ping pong? It does not.
    Indeed, save for one passage in which the cat-narrator chases a ping pong ball
    around a confined space, in a state of frenzy, there is no mention of ping pong
    at all. This absence, or lacuna, makes it a highly unusual book, at least in my
    experience. And that, perhaps, is the point.

    And as much as I enjoyed the cat''s book, so I enjoyed Slobodan Gadfly''s. The
    opening chapter, in which he paints a vivid picture of a universe in which ping
    pong does not exist, and never has existed, is a tour de force. It is a world
    very much like our own, in almost every particular. It even has a few people in
    it like myself, with ping pong ball-size heads, though of course we are not described
    as such, for in this alternative universe without ping pong, there are of necessity
    no ping pong balls. Gadfly has to invent them, just as he has to invent the bat
    and the net and the rules and the scoring system. And invent them he does, each
    in turn.

    He does not spare us the details of his mental agony. There are false starts,
    wrong turnings, red herrings, and mind-bogglingly stupid decisions. In chapter
    four, for example, Gadfly recounts his struggle to imagine a ping pong ball. As
    yet, he has no concept of either the bat or the net or the rules or the scoring
    system. He has not even arrived at the idea that the game might be an indoor one
    played on a tabletop. Indeed, he has not even thought of the game. At this stage,
    his only concern is the ball--in his parallel universe, a wholly new type of ball
    which he challenges himself to bring into existence. Laughably, the first ping
    pong ball he conceives is the size and shape and texture of a medicine ball. It
    is not absolutely identical to a medicine ball, of course, for they already exist
    in his ping pong-less world.

    While I was reading this chapter, with its tragic undertone, I could not help
    but become engulfed by my own imaginings. I wondered what my life would be like
    if, instead of having a ping pong ball head, I had a medicine ball head? It was
    easy enough to posit a slightly different maternity ward mishap that could have
    had such an outcome for my head. But I found it far more difficult to picture
    how different things would have been for me. Would I still go about with a ping
    pong bat in my pocket, ready to strike the impolite? And if I did not, how would
    I deal with such people? Trying to fathom the answers to these questions made
    me all the more admiring of Slobodan Gadfly''s great act of imagination, in inventing,
    from nothing, the game of ping pong.
