  text: '

    Earlier in the week I posted one of my rare snaps, of an urban swan. It is reproduced
    today in my cupboard at The Dabbler, accompanied by a brief explanatory text--a
    text which is basically an excuse to bang on for the umpteenth time about that
    curiously persistent obsession of mine, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and his fondness
    for dining on electrocuted whooper swans.'
