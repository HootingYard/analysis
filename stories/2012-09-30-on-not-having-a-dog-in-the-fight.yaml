  text: "I didn't have a dog in the fight. I didn't have a dog full stop. And there\
    \ wasn't a fight, exactly. It was more of a skirmish. One gang of warriors armed\
    \ with swords charged, screaming, at another gang of warriors, also armed with\
    \ swords. There were one or two clangs of blade against blade, but then the second\
    \ gang ran away, back to their bivouac, and the first gang, still screaming their\
    \ heads off, took possession of the area of land on which the skirmish had taken\
    \ place. It was not quite land, being more accurately described as sodden marsh,\
    \ but the warriors were well pleased with themselves. Their bloodcurdling screams\
    \ turned to chanting, and they chanted their victory song, which went something\
    \ like this:\nWe have vanquished our foes\n  Our swords are caked with their blood\n\
    \  Truly they have been ripped to shreds\n  And the sodden marshland is ours\n\
    That is a translation. In the original, the lines rhyme and have a pleasing rhythmic\
    \ flow. You will note, however, that it is not strictly accurate. The foes ran\
    \ away before they could be ripped to shreds, and not a drop of blood was spilled.\
    \ It remains true, however, that I didn't have a dog in the fight. It doesn't\
    \ matter that I had no dog, that there was no fight as such. The statement has\
    \ its own inner coherence and logic.\nWould things have been any different if\
    \ I did have a dog, and there had been a fight? Let's imagine that, instead of\
    \ running away, the second gang of warriors, sploshing about in the sodden marsh,\
    \ were determined to keep possession of it. When the first gang came charging\
    \ at them, screaming, the second gang were not cowed, and instead started hacking\
    \ wildly at their attackers, who hacked back. Swords clashed, stabbings occurred,\
    \ limbs were lopped. There was much bloodshed. By the time they finished fighting,\
    \ most of the warriors on either side were either dead or splayed upon the sodden\
    \ marsh, groaning. Those who could still walk upright retreated. The sodden marsh\
    \ remained disputed territory. Which gang of warriors took possession of it would\
    \ depend upon further fighting, perhaps tomorrow, after each side had had the\
    \ chance to replenish their numbers.\nMeanwhile, what about me and my putative\
    \ dog? For the purposes of vividness, let us bestow upon it a breed and a name.\
    \ It is a Jack Russell terrier and its name is Skippy. For even more vividness,\
    \ let us posit that Skippy is celebrated in song, by a chorus of tinies. They\
    \ sing:\nSkippy the terrier, o! what a hound!\n  Watch him scamper across the\
    \ ground!\n  Be it sodden marsh or meadow\n  Skippy's a jolly good fellow!\nThat\
    \ is not a translation, as you can probably tell by the rhyme in the first couplet\
    \ and the half-rhyme in the second. By the way, do not fret that the tinies assembled\
    \ to sing Skippy's praises are in any danger from the screaming, sword-wielding\
    \ warriors. We shall place the tinies off to one side, safe behind some kind of\
    \ barricade. In fact, that is where Skippy, my putative dog, is, and I am too.\
    \ That explains why I don't have a dog (Skippy) in the fight. I would not want\
    \ him to come to any harm, if he existed, that is, not out of any overwhelming\
    \ love for dogs, for in actual fact I detest and fear them, but because I like\
    \ to think that if I did have a dog, as a pet, I would do my best to protect it\
    \ from bloodthirsty screaming warriors armed with swords. I would not be much\
    \ of a dog owner, would I, if I picked Skippy up and chucked him over the barricade,\
    \ and commanded him to go and fetch a stick I threw into the clashing melee of\
    \ warriors? Dogs can be very trusting, and the likelihood is that Skippy would\
    \ gaze at me adoringly and scamper unquestioningly into the sodden marsh, there\
    \ to be torn to bits by the razor-sharp blades of the fighting men. They might\
    \ not stab Skippy purposely, but if he were caught up in the violence, by going\
    \ to retrieve the thrown stick, he would almost certainly fall victim to what\
    \ is known as collateral damage. So, if I did have a dog in the fight, even peripherally\
    \ or circumstantially, he would probably come to a bad end.\nI would have to placate\
    \ the grieving tinies, too, whose hearts were filled to bursting with love and\
    \ admiration for Skippy, as attested by their song. Though his violent death was\
    \ caused by the chaotic hacking of swords in a battle which was nothing to do\
    \ with him, nor with me, whose only action was to throw a stick for him to fetch,\
    \ the tinies might well blame me. They would cease singing and turn on me, with\
    \ looks of reproach and accusation. I am not sure how I would go about placating\
    \ them. I suppose I could produce another putative dog, another Jack Russell terrier,\
    \ also called Skippy, and by sleight of hand and misdirection pretend it was the\
    \ same dog, unbloodied and in one piece and alive. But where would I get such\
    \ a dog, quickly enough to convince the tinies?\nAll in all, I am thankful that\
    \ I did not have a dog in the fight. Without the dog, there would be no call for\
    \ a chorus of tinies to sing its praises from behind a barricade, nor for me to\
    \ throw a stick into the midst of a mad tangle of clashing screaming blood-drenched\
    \ warriors for the putative dog to fetch. And with no dead dog, the tinies would\
    \ not turn on me, with a rage and wildness more terrible than an army with banners."
