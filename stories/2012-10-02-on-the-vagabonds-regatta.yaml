  text: "So we have had to put up with Wimbledon and Euro 2012 and the Olympics and\
    \ the Paralympics and the Ryder Cup and the Lord knows what other so called sporting\
    \ events over the past few months, when all along there are those of us who have\
    \ been waiting for the big one. I speak of course of the Vagabonds\u2019 Regatta.\
    \ By tradition, this takes place annually at roughly the same time as the Picnic\
    \ For Detectives. And it really is the most splendid of all vagabonds\u2019 regattas.\
    \ It is not just me who says that. The late Eric Hobsbawm thought so too. In an\
    \ interview some years ago, he is reported to have said:\nI think twenty million\
    \ deaths, give or take the odd million, was a price worth paying to usher in the\
    \ glorious utopia of Soviet communism. But I must dash now, because I have my\
    \ complimentary Hampstead intellectual's ticket for the Vagabonds\u2019 Regatta,\
    \ and I wouldn't miss it for the world! It really is the most splendid of all\
    \ vagabonds\u2019 regattas!\nOf course, Hobsbawm was living in lala land when\
    \ he claimed to be in possession of a complimentary Hampstead intellectual's ticket.\
    \ The organisers of the Vagabonds\u2019 Regatta do not, and I repeat, do not hand\
    \ out free tickets to elderly north London leftie academics living in book-lined\
    \ houses who have never met an actual working class person in their lives. No,\
    \ they have to get their tickets the way everybody else does, by scrabbling in\
    \ a bran tub in an often violent free for all. Indeed, the acquisition of tickets\
    \ can be every bit as exciting as the regatta itself. Up and down the land, farmers\
    \ are paid to throw open their barns, outside which queues form at dawn. Inside\
    \ each barn is a bran tub, filled with bran and straw and slurry and muck, and\
    \ somewhere within the filth, one or two tickets for the Vagabonds\u2019 Regatta.\
    \ Some people pay just to watch the unseemly scramble, the punchings and kickings\
    \ and gougings and stabbings of the desperate aspirant spectators. I think I would\
    \ have paid to see Eric Hobsbawm get a good kicking, had I known which barn to\
    \ attend, though if he did have a ticket it would not surprise me to learn that\
    \ he hired a proxy prole to enter the mel\xE9e\_on his behalf. We know that was\
    \ the ruse employed by that other elderly north London leftie academic living\
    \ in a book-lined house who never met an actual working class person in his life,\
    \ Ralph Miliband. Happily, he was barred from the Vagabonds\u2019 Regatta when\
    \ the ticket his proxy obtained was found to be counterfeit.\nIf you are lucky\
    \ enough to get a non-counterfeit ticket and still be in possession of all your\
    \ limbs, you are certainly in for a treat! Down to the riverside you go, past\
    \ the field where the Picnic For Detectives is in full swing. The spectators\u2019\
    \ area on the riverbank is muddy and sloshy and the stink of unnameable effluence\
    \ wafts through the foul air. There are the rowing boats! They are empty, of course,\
    \ at this stage, just before dawn on the day of the regatta. You tuck in to your\
    \ official regatta snack of compressed reconstituted meat \u2018n\u2019 gristle\
    \ slices on a bed of contaminated lettuce leaves in a basket. Headphones jammed\
    \ into your ears, you listen to your iFry, tuned in to Stephen Fry's pre-regatta\
    \ commentary. In recent years there have been moves to replace Fry with someone\
    \ less ubiquitous, but, as so many others have learned, resistance is futile.\
    \ You slurp your can of Squelcho! You leaf through the official programme, sponsored\
    \ by Dignitas, casting your eye over the beautifully-executed mezzotints of the\
    \ vagabonds, reading up on their form.\n\u201CNed Grimes\u201D, for example, \u201C\
    No fixed address. Toothless, brain-blasted, pronounced limp. Rags and tatters.\
    \ Noxious pong. Vermin in bouffant. Never been anywhere near a boat. Utters shrill\
    \ cries when confronted by stretches of water.\u201D\nThen, when night is almost\
    \ done, and sunrise grows so near that we can touch the spaces, it's time to smooth\
    \ the hair and get the dimples ready, for here come the vagabonds! Driven down\
    \ to the riverbank by the official Regatta Brutes, they are shoved one by one\
    \ through the mud into the water, and must make it as best they can to midstream,\
    \ and clamber each aboard the boat smeared with a decoction of his own particular\
    \ stench. Then the hooter is sounded, and as if by magic the vagabonds grasp the\
    \ oars and begin to row! It is not magic, of course, but the result of long weeks\
    \ of Pavlovian conditioning. And so they row, chaotically, bumping into each other,\
    \ getting their oars entangled in thickets of water weed, going round in circles\
    \ eerily akin to the closing scene of Aguirre, The Wrath Of God, but without the\
    \ monkeys. One or two of the vagabonds might somehow manage to make it as far\
    \ as the lethal high-voltage cable strung across the river upstream, and then\
    \ the sparks fly!\nAfter several hours of this fun and frolic, the hooter sounds\
    \ again. This is the signal for the snipers perched in trees to riddle the rowing\
    \ boats with bullet holes. Yes, it's Sieve Time! It's well worth shoving the earphones\
    \ back into your lugholes to listen to Stephen Fry again, as he keeps a tally\
    \ of which vagabonds go down courageously with their boats and which splosh in\
    \ ungainly fashion back to the riverbank mud.\nAfter that, there is a communal\
    \ singsong, and the surviving vagabonds, if any, are given a penny. By tradition,\
    \ this is an old penny, a 1d. rather than a 1p. coin, and thus not legal tender,\
    \ so utterly worthless. But you should see their shattered faces light up with\
    \ glee! It is a sight that encapsulates all that is glorious about the Vagabonds\u2019\
    \ Regatta, more glorious even than the utopia of Soviet communism."
