  text: 'So we have had to put up with Wimbledon and Euro 2012 and the Olympics and
    the Paralympics and the Ryder Cup and the Lord knows what other so called sporting
    events over the past few months, when all along there are those of us who have
    been waiting for the big one. I speak of course of the Vagabonds'' Regatta. By
    tradition, this takes place annually at roughly the same time as the Picnic For
    Detectives. And it really is the most splendid of all vagabonds'' regattas. It
    is not just me who says that. The late Eric Hobsbawm thought so too. In an interview
    some years ago, he is reported to have said:

    I think twenty million deaths, give or take the odd million, was a price worth
    paying to usher in the glorious utopia of Soviet communism. But I must dash now,
    because I have my complimentary Hampstead intellectual''s ticket for the Vagabonds''
    Regatta, and I wouldn''t miss it for the world! It really is the most splendid
    of all vagabonds'' regattas!

    Of course, Hobsbawm was living in lala land when he claimed to be in possession
    of a complimentary Hampstead intellectual''s ticket. The organisers of the Vagabonds''
    Regatta do not, and I repeat, do not hand out free tickets to elderly north London
    leftie academics living in book-lined houses who have never met an actual working
    class person in their lives. No, they have to get their tickets the way everybody
    else does, by scrabbling in a bran tub in an often violent free for all. Indeed,
    the acquisition of tickets can be every bit as exciting as the regatta itself.
    Up and down the land, farmers are paid to throw open their barns, outside which
    queues form at dawn. Inside each barn is a bran tub, filled with bran and straw
    and slurry and muck, and somewhere within the filth, one or two tickets for the
    Vagabonds'' Regatta. Some people pay just to watch the unseemly scramble, the
    punchings and kickings and gougings and stabbings of the desperate aspirant spectators.
    I think I would have paid to see Eric Hobsbawm get a good kicking, had I known
    which barn to attend, though if he did have a ticket it would not surprise me
    to learn that he hired a proxy prole to enter the melee on his behalf. We know
    that was the ruse employed by that other elderly north London leftie academic
    living in a book-lined house who never met an actual working class person in his
    life, Ralph Miliband. Happily, he was barred from the Vagabonds'' Regatta when
    the ticket his proxy obtained was found to be counterfeit.

    If you are lucky enough to get a non-counterfeit ticket and still be in possession
    of all your limbs, you are certainly in for a treat! Down to the riverside you
    go, past the field where the Picnic For Detectives is in full swing. The spectators''
    area on the riverbank is muddy and sloshy and the stink of unnameable effluence
    wafts through the foul air. There are the rowing boats! They are empty, of course,
    at this stage, just before dawn on the day of the regatta. You tuck in to your
    official regatta snack of compressed reconstituted meat ''n'' gristle slices on
    a bed of contaminated lettuce leaves in a basket. Headphones jammed into your
    ears, you listen to your iFry, tuned in to Stephen Fry''s pre-regatta commentary.
    In recent years there have been moves to replace Fry with someone less ubiquitous,
    but, as so many others have learned, resistance is futile. You slurp your can
    of Squelcho! You leaf through the official programme, sponsored by Dignitas, casting
    your eye over the beautifully-executed mezzotints of the vagabonds, reading up
    on their form.

    "Ned Grimes", for example, "No fixed address. Toothless, brain-blasted, pronounced
    limp. Rags and tatters. Noxious pong. Vermin in bouffant. Never been anywhere
    near a boat. Utters shrill cries when confronted by stretches of water."

    Then, when night is almost done, and sunrise grows so near that we can touch the
    spaces, it''s time to smooth the hair and get the dimples ready, for here come
    the vagabonds! Driven down to the riverbank by the official Regatta Brutes, they
    are shoved one by one through the mud into the water, and must make it as best
    they can to midstream, and clamber each aboard the boat smeared with a decoction
    of his own particular stench. Then the hooter is sounded, and as if by magic the
    vagabonds grasp the oars and begin to row! It is not magic, of course, but the
    result of long weeks of Pavlovian conditioning. And so they row, chaotically,
    bumping into each other, getting their oars entangled in thickets of water weed,
    going round in circles eerily akin to the closing scene of Aguirre, The Wrath
    Of God, but without the monkeys. One or two of the vagabonds might somehow manage
    to make it as far as the lethal high-voltage cable strung across the river upstream,
    and then the sparks fly!

    After several hours of this fun and frolic, the hooter sounds again. This is the
    signal for the snipers perched in trees to riddle the rowing boats with bullet
    holes. Yes, it''s Sieve Time! It''s well worth shoving the earphones back into
    your lugholes to listen to Stephen Fry again, as he keeps a tally of which vagabonds
    go down courageously with their boats and which splosh in ungainly fashion back
    to the riverbank mud.

    After that, there is a communal singsong, and the surviving vagabonds, if any,
    are given a penny. By tradition, this is an old penny, a 1d. rather than a 1p.
    coin, and thus not legal tender, so utterly worthless. But you should see their
    shattered faces light up with glee! It is a sight that encapsulates all that is
    glorious about the Vagabonds'' Regatta, more glorious even than the utopia of
    Soviet communism.'
