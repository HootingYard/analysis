    See Spot. See Spot run. Hear Spot yap. Yap yap yap, says Spot. What a din Spot
    makes! Noisy Spot. See the grump. See the grump throw a pebble at Spot. Hear Spot
    howl. See Spot run.

    See the grump put the kettle on. See the grump look for teabags in the cupboard.
    Hear the grump moan. See the grump don his coat and hat and boots. See the grump
    go to the corner shop.

    See the corner shop. See Spot outside the door. See dozens of other dogs next
    to Spot. See the dogs slaver. See their fangs. See the grump approach. See the
    pack set upon the grump. See blood and sinew.

    Hear the ambulance bell clanging. See Spot preen.

    See Lars. Lars likes tanks. See Lars at the Communist Party meeting. See Lars
    listen to a very very very very very long speech. Rant might be better than speech.
    See Lars clap. See Lars agree with the denunciation of imperialist running dogs.
    See Lars leave the meeting.

    See Spot. See Spot run. See Lars see Spot. See Lars put two and two together.
    See Lars run. See Lars catch up with Spot. See Lars trap Spot in a net. Hear Spot
    yap. Yap yap yap, says Spot. Noisy Spot. See Lars shove Spot into the back of
    a van. See Lars drive off.

    See Spot''s pack of pals. See them slaver. See their fangs. See them run after
    the van. See the van disappear over the horizon. See Spot''s pals pant. See Spot''s
    pals overcome with hopeless canine despair.

    See Lars park the van outside a camp. See the sign on the camp fence. "Political
    Re-education Camp" says the sign. See Lars drag Spot into the camp. See Spot politically
    re-educated.


    That is one of the stories from a compendium of tales for infants published by
    the Unreconstructed Stalinist Press. It is packed with splendid stories, well
    worth reading aloud to your infant, if you have one, or to the wild wind, if not.
    The tale of Spot is at a rather advanced level, but some of the stories in the
    book are aimed at even tinier infants. Among them is a very very very very simple,
    and simple-minded, Life of Eric Hobsbawm. I have not been able to gain permission
    to reprint it here, though numerous extracts have been splattered across the pages
    of the Grauniad over the past week.


    As readers will know, my annual plan is to bash out a Stakhanovite thousand(ish)
    words per day, under a heading beginning with the word "On". One problem with
    this approach is that certain pieces can outstay their welcome, as I pad them
    out with needless extra paragraphs just to meet the word-count. I am not going
    to make that mistake with "On Spot", which, frankly, has made its point.

    Instead, I could witter on about something else, something either significant
    or insignificant, newsworthy or otherwise. Or, of course, I could just shut up.
    That might be a blessing, and not a blessing in disguise, merely a blessing.

    I recently finished reading Francis Spufford''s new book Unapologetic, with its
    somewhat unwieldy subtitle Why, despite everything, Christianity can still make
    surprising emotional sense. In an afterword, Mr Spufford tells us that he wrote
    most of the book while sitting at a corner table in a Cambridge branch of Costa
    Coffee. He tells us this for two reasons, one to acknowledge his thanks to the
    staff, which shows admirable good manners, but also to alert us to the fact that,
    as he goes on to say, his book is not the product of any research or scholarship,
    but more a fairly spontaneous outpouring of the thoughts in his head. I have never
    attempted to write in a public space, in that manner, apart from on very rare
    occasions. Being a Diogenesian recluse, I always write at home, or home from home.
    But with the Spufford example before me, I am beginning to wonder if I ought not
    take my trusty laptop and install myself in a coffee bar or on a park bench, and
    do my tippy-tapping there.

    It further occurs to me that, were I to do so, I could obtain a flat cap as beloved
    by our beggars, and place it upside down next to me, accompanied by a sign saying
    something along the lines of "Impoverished Scribbler. Please Give Generously."
    Though I suppose a truly impoverished scribbler would not come armed with a laptop.
    Perhaps I shall have to revert to my practice of the last century, and write by
    hand, in a mighty ledger. Add a few strands of straw to my hair, and dribble a
    little, and who knows how many bright coins would be tossed into my cap?

    I am still far from my thousand(ish) words goal, but that is quite enough for
    today. I am going to put the kettle on and make a cup of tea, hoping there are
    teabags in the cupboard, and I do not have to don coat and hat and boots and go
    out to the corner shop, there to be set upon by Spot and his slavering pack of
    pals, and left for dead.'
