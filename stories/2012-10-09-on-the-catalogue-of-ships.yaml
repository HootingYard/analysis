  text: 'That unparalleled pamphleteer of the twentieth century, Dobson, was never
    shy about bruiting abroad his talent.

    "It has occurred to me," he said one morning, over breakfast, to his inamorata,
    "That I am probably the greatest writer since Homer. No, strike that ''probably''.
    Really, there is no question about it."

    Marigold Chew dallied with a sausage skewered on her fork, and said, "That may
    be so, Dobson, but where in your accumulated pamphleteering work is there a passage
    to match the catalogue of ships given by Homer in Book Two of the Iliad?"

    "What catalogue of ships would that be?" asked Dobson, who had never actually
    read Homer.

    Marigold Chew leaned over to the bookcase, took from it a copy of the Iliad in
    the translation by Samuel Butler, and tossed it over to Dobson.

    "Read and learn," she said, "Read and learn."

    After breakfast, Dobson did so.

    I will tell the captains of the ships and all the fleet together, he read, Peneleos,
    Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were captains of the Boeotians. These
    were they that dwelt in Hyria and rocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus,
    and the highlands of Eteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of Mycalessus.
    They also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon;
    Ocalea and the strong fortress of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt
    of doves; Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the fortress
    of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove of Neptune; Arne rich
    in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and Anthedon upon the sea. From these there
    came fifty ships, and in each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the
    Boeotians.

    Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt in Aspledon and
    Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble maiden bore them in the house
    of Actor son of Azeus; for she had gone with Mars secretly into an upper chamber,
    and he had lain with her. With these there came thirty ships.

    The Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty Iphitus the
    son of Naubolus. These were they that held Cyparissus, rocky Pytho, holy Crisa,
    Daulis, and Panopeus; they also that dwelt in Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about
    the waters of the river Cephissus, and Lilaea by the springs of the Cephissus;
    with their chieftains came forty ships, and they marshalled the forces of the
    Phoceans, which were stationed next to the Boeotians, on their left.

    Ajax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not so great, nor
    nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was a little man, and his breastplate
    was made of linen, but in use of the spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the
    Achaeans. These dwelt in Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae,
    Tarphe, and Thronium about the river Boagrius. With him there came forty ships
    of the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.

    On and on it went, captain after captain, ship after ship, until Dobson calculated
    he had tallied up almost fifty captains and over a thousand ships. Then he returned
    the book to its place, pulled on his Bavarian Otter Hunter''s boots, and headed
    for the door.

    "Where are you going?" asked Marigold Chew.

    "I intend to take the bus to the ill-starred fishing village of O''Houlihan''s
    Wharf," said Dobson, "Where I shall sit on the jetty armed with propelling pencil
    and paper, making notes."

    "Righty-ho," said Marigold Chew, "What time can I expect you back?"

    "When I have tallied up over fifty captains and at least one and a half thousand
    ships," said Dobson, and he stamped out into the rain, slamming the door behind
    him.

    Later, sitting on the jetty at O''Houlihan''s Wharf armed with propelling pencil
    and paper, the pamphleteer gazed upon the sloshing estuary. He had been here all
    day, and thus far had a tally of three captains, one of whom he suspected was
    a pantry boy in disguise, four fishing smacks, a tugboat, and a couple of rowing
    boats. It was still raining, and he caught the bus home in a foul temper.

    "How did you get on?" asked Marigold Chew brightly.

    "Don''t ask," growled Dobson, "I am repairing to my escritoire and will join you
    later, when I have written up my catalogue of ships."

    I will tell the captains of the ships and all the fleet together, he wrote, as
    spotted from the jetty in the ill-starred fishing village of O''Houlihan''s Wharf
    on a wet Wednesday in October. First let it be said that I do not know how long
    Homer sat in some similar seaside spot counting captains and ships. But my own
    experience leads me to distrust his tally, and I think he was probably cheating,
    making things up, inventing captains and ships out of whole cloth. Well, two can
    play at that game.

    I counted fifty-five captains, Bristow, Snippy, Vile, Glinka, Dipdap, Penge, Crowbar,
    Hoistermann, Buckle, Snedbury, Frowst, Pang, Gleet, Owlhead, the further names
    to be added later.

    And I counted two thousand ships, including fishing smacks and tugboats and rowing
    boats, and I will list all their names after I have had a bite to eat.

    This will become known as Dobson''s Catalogue Of Ships, and with the passage of
    time, several centuries'' worth, nobody will dare to doubt its veracity. Long
    after Homer is forgotten, and his captains and ships all blotted out, the name
    of Dobson will resound down the ages. Wherever two or three nautically-enthusiastic
    persons are gathered together, and feel impelled to recite lengthy lists of captains
    and ships, it is my catalogue they will turn to, and read aloud, declaiming the
    mighty names in mighty voices! But first, on this wet Wednesday evening, I shall
    partake of soup and sausages, and a cup of tea.'
