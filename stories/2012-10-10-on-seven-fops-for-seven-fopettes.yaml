  text: 'Ingmar and Hetty are the first fop and fopette we meet in the smash hit musical
    Seven Fops For Seven Fopettes. Ingmar is standing on a hayrick, whistling, and
    Hetty enters stage left, carrying a lamb. In most productions the lamb is a mere
    bundle of cotton wool. There is nothing remotely foppish about either of them.
    Indeed, they might be mistaken for yokels.

    Then Ingmar sings the smash hit number "On Luneberg Heath Did I Lay Down My Submachine
    Gun", and Hetty replies with "Gut That Herring!". By now the audience is utterly
    confused. Fops, yokels, militia men, fisherfolk? What is going on here?

    The action now turns to the barn, from within which comes a cacophony of different
    noises, including clanking, siphoning, ragtime piano, hooters, the cries of triumphant
    pole-vaulters, oompah oompah music, and the like. Ingmar and Hetty enter the barn
    to investigate, and when they emerge, they have become foppish, indubitably so.
    Hetty sings "I Am A Fopette On Crutches After That Accident In The Barn". They
    then become engaged and a Lutheran pastor beckons them from the wings.

    The second fop and fopette to be introduced are Gladiolus and Gladiola. They are
    already wholly foppish as they descend from a balcony on strings. Yes, they are
    puppets! The orchestra strikes up a puppetty kind of tune, sprightly yet with
    mordant passages. Gladiolus torments a heron--also a puppet--in a languid manner.
    Gladiola rescues the heron from his clutches, and with a startling bit of stage
    trickery it is transformed into a real heron. The fop and the fopette profess
    their undying love for each other, and a Lutheran pastor beckons them from the
    wings.

    Five other fop and fopette couples appear in turn during the next forty minutes.
    There are moments of melodrama and terror, bits of slapstick, a Dadaist interlude,
    and many smash hit songs before the curtain falls.

    Act Two begins with the Lutheran pastor centre stage, alone at a lectern. He recites
    lengthy passages from Pontoppidan''s Explanations, while behind him mute blind
    love monkeys cavort in cardboard trees. The second half of Act Two is the audience
    participation section, always an unnerving experience. Usually, the rifles are
    loaded with blanks, and the piano wire is actually made from thin strands of easily
    breakable dough.

    Act Three, with its famous airship sequence, has always proved a huge challenge
    to directors. While the orchestra plays Metamorphosen by Strauss, in the happy
    up-tempo version by Julius Uptempo, the audience has to be convinced that six
    fops and six fopettes parachute from the airship with seconds to spare before
    it explodes and is engulfed in flames. Ingmar and Hetty remain on board, and are
    assumed to have perished until the exciting finale.

    Act Four has never been performed in public, for reasons given variously as stupidity
    and fire regulations.

    In the exciting finale, the seven fops and fopettes are married in a ceremony
    performed by the Lutheran pastor. Ingmar and Hetty explain their escape from the
    burning airship in mime. Wilted flowers are tossed on to the stage by a stooge
    in the audience, and there is a rousing chorus of the smash hit "Thin Strands
    Of Easily Breakable Dough".

    Critics were unanimous in their praise of the musical from the outset. In Unanimous
    Praise Of Musicals magazine, Volume XVII, No. 7, July 1953, Bengt Bunglawala wrote:

    I have often dreamed of seeing a musical featuring fops and fopettes and puppets
    and a Lutheran pastor and a mysterious barn and a heron and melodrama, terror,
    slapstick and a Dadaist interlude and audience participation and an exploding
    airship and mute blind love monkeys, all accompanied by smash hit songs and a
    happy up-tempo version of something by Strauss. In fact, it has been my recurring
    dream, from which I have awoken, biting my pillow in a frenzy, five or six nights
    a week since I was so high. Now it has become a reality, and it does not disappoint.
    My only cavil is that there was no place for either Jack Hulbert or Cicely Courtneidge
    in this production.

    In Effusive Reviews Of Musicals magazine, the critic Tord Grip (no relation to
    the football coach) was effusive:

    Boy oh boy! What a musical! My critical review of it is particularly effusive
    regarding the audience participation segment, when I contrived to substitute blanks
    for live ammunition and shot my great rival Bengt Bunglawala in the kneecaps.
    That will teach him to question my critical acumen!

    A film adaptation of Seven Fops For Seven Fopettes, featuring Dick Van Dyke and
    Julie Andrews, is still in the throes of production, several decades after shooting
    began. No release date has yet been announced.

    Tinie Tempah''s cover version of the smash hit from Act Three, "A Fopette Dons
    Her Parachute", features on his next album, which may mercifully never be released
    due to a sudden and unexpected upsurge of good taste in the record-buying public.

    Alain de Botton''s squib How I Based My Entire Life On What I Learned From "Seven
    Fops For Seven Fopettes" is available from all good airports.'
