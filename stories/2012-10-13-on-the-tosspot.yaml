  text: 'I have been asked to compile a report on the Tosspot. It is a great honour
    and I hope to acquit myself with really fantastic splendour. That would be a feather
    in my cap. I decided the best way to approach the Tosspot is to tackle him fruit
    by fruit. It is not that fruit looms large in his tosspottery, but dimpus dempus,
    as they say in Latin, they being the Tosspot''s acolytes.

    Before proceeding, with I hope fantastic splendour, it is meet to say a few words
    about those acolytes. Not every (lower case) tosspot has acolytes, but the definitively
    upper case Tosspot does. That goes without saying. So why did I say it? Aha! For
    the same reason that we are going to tackle him fruit by fruit. The Tosspot''s
    acolytes come in a variety of caps and colours, but what they all have in common
    is possession of a key to the hillside sanctum. It is as fine a sanctum as anybody
    in search of a sanctum could wish for. Set halfway up a hillside, concealed by
    serried beds of hollyhocks, it is both stony and capacious. There is a joke going
    the rounds that the Tosspot is himself stony and capacious, and the acolytes guffaw,
    though it is unclear what, if anything, it means. I guffawed myself, when I first
    heard it, to seem one of the in-crowd, but so many and various were my slips and
    fumbles in other respects that I was always marked as an outsider. That is perhaps
    why I have been entrusted to write this report. An acolyte would just witter adoringly,
    like a moonstruck calf.

    With the fruit by fruit approach, it is essential to get the fruits in the correct
    order, otherwise even the most fantastically splendid report writer can get into
    all sorts of pickles. I know that to my cost. A while ago I was asked to write
    a report about bike wankers. You might think that is a topic that does not lend
    itself to the fruit by fruit approach, but you would be wrong, very very wrong.
    But I made the fatal mistake of starting off with plums, then bananas, and quite
    frankly after that I was done for. The report was binned, and justifiably so.

    I am not going to make the same mistake again, which is why for my Tosspot report
    I decided to place the fruits in a very specific order, one derived from a close
    reading of certain obscure texts by Madame Blavatsky. HPB herself does not actually
    refer to any fruits in the passages I consulted, but that is the point of my close
    reading, to eke from her words meanings which may not have been apparent even
    to her. You cannot read just any old writer using this method and expect results.
    I have tried it, for example, with H. Rider Haggard, Marie Corelli, and Dennis
    Wheatley, and in each case I ended up in a perfect flap. Either my fruits were
    in a blithering chaotic order or there was no hint of fruit or, come to that,
    of order. I ended up having to visit a greengrocer and buy one of each fruit and
    align them by hand across the table, which took hours, and even then I had no
    idea if the order was appropriate to my purposes. But I know I can trust Madame
    Blavatsky, at least in this regard.

    The order of fruits is one thing, however, while the broader ramifications of
    a report on the Tosspot are something else again. Quibbles aside, there is the
    question of tone. Though come to think of it, having mentioned quibbles, casting
    them to one side is easier said than done. My bike wankers report suffered from
    a surfeit of quibbles, quite apart from the fruit order debacle. Try as I might
    to shove them out of sight and out of mind, they kept rearing their heads, and
    snorting, sometimes deafeningly. I plugged my ears with cotton wool to no avail.
    Eventually I had to go out to a park bench to write my report, thinking that the
    sight of ducks in a duckpond across a lawn punctuated by beds of lupins would
    help me settle to the right frame of mind. It did, to some extent, but then it
    began to rain, and I do not recommend writing in the rain. Ink gets smudged.

    Tone, though. Tone for the Tosspot. What should it be? Valedictory? Captious?
    Smitten? It would be easy enough to adopt a tosspottish tone, if one had a gift
    for such, but to do so would I think lack a certain dignity. And it would not
    sit well with the fruit by fruit approach which is, if it is anything, the pinnacle
    of dignity. I would defy anyone to write a report, on any subject under the sun,
    adopting a fruit by fruit approach, and not thereby impart to one''s text a measure
    of dignity unsurpassed. And let''s face it, the Tosspot himself presents a pretty
    undignified figure at the best of times. Those trousers alone are enough to turn
    the strongest of stomachs. I will not even begin to describe the socks. In fact,
    I am not going to mention the socks in my report. I shall go straight from undignified
    trousers to undignified boots, and it will be as if the socks never existed. That
    is the best way, believe me. I know whereof I speak.

    Having given the matter much thought, and prodded that thought by gazing for several
    hours at Madame Blavatsky''s milky grey eyes in a photograph, I have concluded
    that the tone of my report ought to be set by what we call the fruit test. The
    idea with this technique is to get "inside" the fruit, as it were, and then to
    allow the fruit to dictate the tone of one''s text. It is absolutely critical,
    of course, that one selects the proper fruit for the task. Putting the fruits
    in the correct order is child''s play by comparison. Somewhat surprisingly, the
    very worst thing one can do is to use real items of fruit, bought from a greengrocer,
    lined up along the table, to make one''s selection. That is what a naive young
    reporter would do. After all, it seems to make sense. But as my mentor said to
    me, from within the dark interior of his booth, in his booming voice, "Beware!
    Beware of real fruit!" The import of what he said was not clear to me then, but
    by heaven it is now, in spades, with brass knobs on.

    And so I don my special gloves, and I cut some capers, and I prepare myself to
    pick the most important fruit I shall ever pick.'
