    This is the appropriate verbal response when you see saints go marching in. It
    is not, admittedly, something you see very often, but it is best to be prepared,
    just in case, and to have the double "glory" and the "hallelujah" ready on your
    lips. You can even practise, in the absence of marching saints, to be on the safe
    side.

    "Does it matter," I have been asked, "into what the saints are marching?" Actually
    it is surprising how often I am asked this question. Only the other day I was
    buttonholed in the boulevard by not one, not two, but by three separate persons--a
    boy scout, a widow-woman, and an art wanker--each asking me, in varying tones
    of urgency and desperation, if they ought to concern themselves with the eventual
    destination of marching saints. In each case my answer was the same. "No," I said,
    plainly and simply, hoping that would put an end to the matter and I could continue
    on my way, sashaying along towards the pie shop, or the pastry kiosk, or wherever
    it was I was going.

    But neither the boy scout, the widow-woman, nor the art wanker was satisfied by
    my reply and they each had a supplementary question. These I felt duty bound to
    deal with. When one is the sort of person whose advice is sought in the matter
    of marching saints, one cannot merely shrug and dismiss those by whom one is importuned.
    To do so would be snippy, and I am not a snippy man.

    Now, I am not going to relate to you precisely what those three supplementary
    questions were. We haven''t got time to get bogged down in minutiae, have we?
    What I will do is try to make some general points about marching saints, or more
    precisely the destinations into which we might find them marching. You will then
    be able to judge if your own questions on the matter have been answered. If not,
    you can either put your question in writing and send it to me c/o the Marching
    Saints Investigation Bureau, or you can smack yourself hard in the centre of your
    forehead and go about some other business, such as garden maintenance or changing
    the fuse in one of your electrical plugs.

    There are innumerable situations into which saints might march. For instance,
    I have seen saints go marching in to mysterious remote storage facilities out
    in arid wastelands. I have seen them go marching in to certain death in the face
    of enemy machine gun fire. And I have seen them go marching in to the pie shop.
    In the latter case, I think they were intent not on buying pies but on making
    a complaint about pies bought the previous day, which turned out to be contaminated
    pies and gave them all a proper bellyache.

    The thing is that saints tend to go marching about, in groups, rather than keeping
    themselves to themselves in isolated hermitages, convents, monasteries, and the
    like. Nobody is quite sure why that is. Obviously there is the issue of strength
    in numbers, but any saint worth their salt is brimful of inner strength. It is
    one of their saintly features. No matter what brickbats are thrown, nor perils
    confronted, a saint will cope with them due to their strength and sanctity. This
    much is true even of weedy or puny saints, of whom there are more than you might
    expect.

    Still, for whatever reason, they like to gather together into a pack, like wolves,
    and go marching, usually with banners and drums and pipes to toot. I suppose it
    beats sitting around in a hermitage gazing at the bracken and gorse growing in
    the doorway. Once they are marching, they like to have somewhere to march to,
    something to march into. Otherwise they would just march and march and march,
    until they dropped from exhaustion or until they reached the limit of the land,
    and arrived at cliffs or a beach, and saw the sea. In a sense, then, it doesn''t
    matter into what they march. What is important is that, as they pass, those who
    see them doff their hats and lift their voices to heaven and cry "Glory glory
    hallelujah!"

    The double "glory" is significant. Where only a single "glory" is cried, I have
    seen marching saints totter and stagger and in some cases fall flat on their faces.
    If the fallen saint is near the front of the pack, those behind can trip over
    them, and come clattering down themselves, dropping their drum or tooting pipe,
    causing a bigger obstacle to those further behind, and resulting in a chaotic
    heap of limb-flailing saints. Though this can be amusing to watch, it would be
    sinful to laugh, as I am sure you know. I once chuckled when I saw a collapsed
    pack of marching saints, and not long afterwards I was visited in the night by
    a horrible black swooping bat of penitence. I did not forget that in a hurry.

    As with the double "glory" so with the "hallelujah". You might want to practise
    your pronunciation of this cry. That ''j'' can be treacherous. Remember that it
    is only Rastafarians who give it the common ''j'' sound, as when they are babbling
    on about Jah and the sufferation in Babylon. As a consequence, "hallelujah" is
    sometimes spelled "halleluiah", for the benefit of dimwits. As you can imagine,
    missing out "hallelujah" after "glory glory" can be even more calamitous than
    a single "glory". As I explained, with inhuman patience, to the boy scout and
    the widow-woman and the art wanker, a night-time visit from a horrible black swooping
    bat of penitence would be the very least of your worries if you omitted the "hallelujah".
    Take my word for it, you don''t want to know the awful details.

    In our next article on marching saints, we will look in some detail at chronology.
    When exactly is the "when" when the saints go marching in? Before then, your homework
    is to list three such occasions, backed up by documentary evidence. To avoid confusion,
    give your times using the twenty-four hour clock.'
