  text: 'There have been many studies of the consequences of the war, so on the face
    of it yet another one would seem unnecessary. I feel compelled to add my own for
    two reasons. First, that the extant studies are uniformly mistaken, foolish, and
    sprawling. Secondly, this one is by me and is therefore fantastic. It is also
    considerably shorter than those sprawling studies, so you will be all clued up
    on the consequences of the war, and able to spout intelligently about them at
    cocktail parties, having spent only a fraction of the time needed to digest the
    mistaken foolish sprawls.

    Well, you will not be able to spout at cocktail parties, of course, because one
    of the consequences of the war is that cocktail parties are a thing of the past.
    It is difficult to host a halfway decent cocktail party in a landscape that had
    been reduced to crumbling ruins. I have no idea what Beamish is going on about
    in his mistaken and foolish and sprawling study, Some Notes On The Consequences
    Of The War Vis A Vis Fashionable Cocktail Parties. He claims to have personally
    attended no fewer than five such elegant social occasions in the six weeks immediately
    after the cessation of hostilities, though I note he is very cagey, very cagey
    indeed, about where these events are supposed to have taken place. He only gives
    one definite postal address--14b Hysteria Mews--and it did not take much research
    for me to discover that this is now the site of a foetid swamp bubbling with hazardous
    chemicals. The only standing structure for miles around is the old coastguard''s
    hut. Thinking that perhaps some brainsick noddies had snuck past the barbed wire
    to hold a cocktail party there, I donned protective clothing and made my way in,
    only to discover that the roof and the ceiling and the floor had all collapsed,
    and that the pit thus formed below ground was home to a family of savage mutant
    otters. By all means go hither and try sipping a cocktail while engaged in elegant
    chitchat if you dare. But don''t blame me if you emerge bitten and clawed and
    bloody and wishing for a quick death.

    Beamish is also the author of Some Notes On The Consequences Of The War Vis A
    Vis The Fixture List For The Domestic Pole-Vaulting League. It astonishes me that
    this book sprawls over nine hundred pages, excluding the index and appendices.
    I would have only one "note" on the subject, and it would read as follows: "In
    the aftermath of the war, there are no fixtures". Yes, one could expand upon that
    by recalling the heady days of the prewar pole-vaulting team meetings, and the
    contrast with the postwar scene, but there is only so much one can say. Beamish,
    poor deluded Beamish, seems to be under the impression that pole-vaulting events
    are still taking place on Saturday afternoons, all across the land. Perhaps he
    is hallucinating. Certainly a population of stunted beggars with withered limbs
    is in no fit state to pole-vault over even a tiny pile of pebbles, if, that is,
    one could find anywhere a pole-vaulting pole that had not been reduced to ashes
    and dust, or been commandeered to prop up something that would otherwise collapse,
    like an old coastguard''s hut.

    But Beamish is hardly the worst offender. More mistaken, more foolish, and more
    sprawling is An A To Z Of The Consequences Of The War by Alonzo Zumbag. This weighs
    in at over two thousand closely-printed pages, with more than six hundred entries
    under the letter A alone. And what a lot of bosh it is! If we are to believe Mr
    Zumbag, the following things have improved considerably since the end of the war:
    apples, apricots, alabaster, amnesiacs, aircraft (both real and model), ants,
    aniseed, aspirin, the month of April (but not, curiously, August), antiques, art,
    aglets, air, and antimony. Not a shred of evidence is offered in support of such
    blithering claptrap as "One of the consequences of the war is that Airfix modelling
    glue for model aeroplanes is now hundreds of times more gluey and sticky than
    it was before the war. Truly it is the king of adhesive pastes!"

    This is patently untrue. Last week, for example, I was foraging around in a waterlogged
    bomb crater hoping to find a sprig of nettles to keep me alive until teatime,
    when I came upon an almost intact Airfix model kit. It was a seventy-six piece
    miniature of a Swordfish 109 Plasmatron Fighter Jet, complete with a tube of modelling
    glue. To pass the time, and to distract myself from the pangs of hunger and thirst
    and from the hideous suppurations of my many and various sores and boils, I squatted
    in a puddle and put the model together. But when it came time to apply the glue,
    the stuff that squirted out of the tube was neither gluey nor sticky. What it
    was was highly acidic, like the blood of the alien in Alien, and it burned holes
    in my arms and legs and torso which ache like billy-o. If that is better than
    prewar Airfix modelling glue, then I am a Swiss cheese. Actually, I am beginning
    to resemble a Swiss cheese, what with all these burning acid holes.

    So if you take my advice you will throw away any of those Consequences Of The
    War studies you have bought, and stick with this one. I will not pretend I have
    been going to elegant cocktail parties. I will not claim to have attended a pole-vaulting
    league match. And I will have nothing good to say about anything beginning with
    A, let alone with B or with the other letters of the alphabet, not all of which
    I can remember. I was such a butterfingers with that tube of so-called "king of
    adhesive pastes" that I managed to squirt a goodly dollop on to my head. It ate
    its way through the flesh and bone right into my brain and out the other side,
    and I must admit to feeling not quite myself ever since. I have even begun wondering
    if there actually was a war, before which this land was a sort of paradise. Maybe
    it is all a phantasm, and I have always, for my entire life, squatted in a puddle
    under a foul black sky, half blind from gas, and starving and withered of limb,
    scrubbling in the muck for a sprig of poisonous nettle, happy as a warlord.'
