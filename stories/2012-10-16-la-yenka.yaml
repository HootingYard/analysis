  text: "I am indebted to Outa_Spaceman for drawing to my attention this paragraph\
    \ of majestic sweeping prose:\nSince the emergence of the twist, inventing new\
    \ dances proliferated: limbo, madison, whiskey, bycicle, Hully Gully, shake and\
    \ an endless etcetera. In Spain also arise about native dances like the twist\
    \ or when they, however, is the Yenka will be victorious in the making. A dance\
    \ based on hopping on one foot to finish jumping with both feet together. The\
    \ musical part of the case is a mere excuse to cause this kind of fun gymnastic\
    \ jumping in guiding their activity. The four tracks on the album are quite similar\
    \ and all are composed Kurt Charley. The instrumentation is a Franciscan poverty\
    \ and is chaired by an instrument, which by the way, it became fashionable: the\
    \ melodic. Was a smash hit and was one of the biggest selling records in 1965\
    \ and compulsory piece around or party shindig worth his salt. It sparked a fever\
    \ Yenka nationwide, because it was an innocuous family dance and athletic. Other\
    \ groups and soloists were ready to record songs to the rhythm of Yenka, so Hispavox\
    \ was careful to place in all partner disks labeled: \u201CThe Yenka by its creators\
    \ Johnny and Charley\u201D\nHie over here to see a snap of Johnny and Charley\
    \ discussing Franciscan poverty."
