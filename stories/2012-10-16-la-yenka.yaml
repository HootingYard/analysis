  text: 'I am indebted to Outa_Spaceman for drawing to my attention this paragraph
    of majestic sweeping prose:

    Since the emergence of the twist, inventing new dances proliferated: limbo, madison,
    whiskey, bycicle, Hully Gully, shake and an endless etcetera. In Spain also arise
    about native dances like the twist or when they, however, is the Yenka will be
    victorious in the making. A dance based on hopping on one foot to finish jumping
    with both feet together. The musical part of the case is a mere excuse to cause
    this kind of fun gymnastic jumping in guiding their activity. The four tracks
    on the album are quite similar and all are composed Kurt Charley. The instrumentation
    is a Franciscan poverty and is chaired by an instrument, which by the way, it
    became fashionable: the melodic. Was a smash hit and was one of the biggest selling
    records in 1965 and compulsory piece around or party shindig worth his salt. It
    sparked a fever Yenka nationwide, because it was an innocuous family dance and
    athletic. Other groups and soloists were ready to record songs to the rhythm of
    Yenka, so Hispavox was careful to place in all partner disks labeled: "The Yenka
    by its creators Johnny and Charley"

    Hie over here to see a snap of Johnny and Charley discussing Franciscan poverty.'
