  text: 'I was interested to note, when solving today''s cryptic crossword in the
    Grauniad, a felicitous conjunction of words. The column containing 7 and 19 down,
    third in from the right, reads INFERNAL GAZEBO. Indeed it was both felicitous
    and a jaw-dropping coincidence, for it had long been my intention to write today
    about the infernal gazebo at Plunkett Hall.

    On our last visit to that grand baronial edifice, we learned how, one afternoon
    in the eighteenth century, Baron Plunkett confronted the Evil Thargon. It was
    several weeks later when the events historians call "the strange events in the
    infernal gazebo at Plunkett Hall" took place. There are a number of books and
    pamphlets and tracts and hysterical blood-stained ravings on the topic, all of
    which are worth reading, if you have the time and inclination. I have neither,
    to be quite honest, what with all the other calls on my attention, birds, ponds,
    smokers'' poptarts and what have you, so what follows is frankly ill-researched
    and possibly wrong, wrong, wrong in all particulars. But bear with me, because
    I think you will find it rewarding, in a Radio 4 Thought For The Dayish kind of
    way.

    The gazebo in the grounds of Plunkett Hall was plonked upon one of the magnificent
    lawns not far from the ha-ha. Architecturally, it was an unremarkable gazebo,
    having been designed by the unremarkable architect Baffles Chippy, and built by
    a gaggle of snaggle-toothed and sullen labourers hired for a pittance from the
    derelict godforsaken villages thereabouts. None of these men of peasant stock
    had an inner life, which was just as well, or they might have been haunted forever
    after by the gazebo they built. Baffles Chippy did have an inner life, and a monstrous
    one, riddled with imps and demons and incubi and succubi and all sorts of other
    awful phantoms of hell that don''t bear thinking about. But think of them the
    architect did, constantly, to the point of phrenzy. And so, whenever he was commissioned
    to design a building, be it a gazebo or a folly or a seaside chalet, he strived
    to make it, in his words, "a home fit for heebie-jeebies", the latter a catch-all
    term he used for the fiends throbbing in his demented brain. Unfortunately--or
    perhaps fortunately--Chippy was a somewhat cackhanded architect, and the buildings
    he designed rarely if ever reflected his intentions. They might be twee, or gingerbread,
    or stumpy, or base and brickish, but seldom did they look like the ghastly horrors
    he had in mind.

    So it was with the Plunkett Hall gazebo, which, when finished, looked pretty much
    like any other eighteenth century gazebo in the grounds of a stately home. In
    spite of this, Chippy insisted it be called the infernal gazebo, and so it was,
    by all and sundry.

    One afternoon in the eighteenth century, the ancient factotum Ned Slop came panting
    and staggering into the library of Plunkett Hall.

    - Lawks-a-mercy!, baron, he croaked, There''s a right to-do over in the infernal
    gazebo by the ha-ha.

    Baron Plunkett looked up from his book.

    - Must you pester me, Slop, when you can see I am making a series of learned annotations
    in my leather-bound Pontoppidan?, snapped the baron.

    - I beg pardon, baron, b-b-but..., said the factotum.

    - Whatever the to-do is, I am sure you, with your untold decades of service and
    drudgery and fawning and drainage ditch draining can cope with it, Slop. Now be
    off with you, before I ring for the pincers-man to come and have at you with his
    terrible pincers!

    And so Ned Slop bowed and staggered out of the library and along the corridors
    and through the great baronial hall and out into the magnificent grounds. He tottered
    slowly across the lawns towards the infernal gazebo. He was shaking more than
    usual, and dribbling with fear. But then he remembered he had seen the baron shake
    a stick at the Evil Thargon, just a few weeks ago, and that had seemed to do the
    trick. So he veered off towards a mighty yew and picked from the ground a fallen
    stick. Waving it in front of him, emboldened, he entered the infernal gazebo.

    It was infested with bats and owls and moles and otters. And there, in their midst,
    stood the unremarkable figure of Baffles Chippy. Only now there was something
    remarkable about him. He was wearing a cape and a pointy hat and had sprouted
    horns and a tail and his feet were naked and cloven as those of a goat and his
    eyes were black black black globules of fathomless doom.

    Poor Ned Slop waved his stick, but Chippy, or the thing Chippy had become, roared.
    It was an awful, deafening roar, and the stick burst into flames in Ned Slop''s
    wrinkled and cadaverous hand.

    - Lawks-a-mercy!, he cried, not for the first time that day.

    In his moth-eaten armchair in the library, Baron Plunkett scrawled a learned annotation
    in the margin of his leather-bound Pontoppidan. Had he not been as deaf as a post,
    he would have heard distant rumbling. A to-do of cosmic proportions was taking
    place at that very moment in the infernal gazebo. When it was over, there would
    be nothing left but a few owl-feathers and an otter''s shrivelled head and the
    charred remains of Ned Slop''s stick and a yawning crater, full of fire and vapours
    and shrieking, black and bottomless, the maw of hell.

    The next day, apprised of the pit, Baron Plunkett ordered that the area be surrounded
    by another ha-ha, and a filbert hedge planted all around it. A gaggle of snaggle-toothed
    and sullen labourers hired for a pittance from the derelict godforsaken villages
    thereabouts toiled and dug, with only a smattering of them toppling into the pit.
    And when they were done, the second of the so-called "strange events in the infernal
    gazebo at Plunkett Hall" occurred. The gazebo, blackened and burned but intact,
    rose up out of the pit, and hovered awhile in the air, and then it shot upwards,
    at inexplicable speed, and vanished in the aether. And ten minutes later, dressed
    in a spacesuit like Felix Baumgartner''s, the ancient factotum Ned Slop fell to
    earth, bumping down in a drainage ditch, quite unharmed, but with a brand new
    and alien brain pulsating inside his skull...'
