  text: 'I had a large shallow pan of "milk cake" on a cooker. The cooker was in the
    form of a basic four-legged table. The pan had overheated, and underneath the
    table ethereal blue flames flickered. Crawling under the table, I extinguished
    the flames by waving a dainty teaspoon.

    What can it all mean?'
