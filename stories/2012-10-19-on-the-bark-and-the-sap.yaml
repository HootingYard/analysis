  text: 'One of the simplest concepts to grasp, when embarking on the study of trees,
    is the difference between the bark and the sap. Indeed it is so simple that I
    am not going to bother explaining it to you. You almost certainly know the difference
    yourself, and have known it for so long that I strongly suspect you cannot remember
    when first you learned it. Cast your mind back. Can you honestly say, with any
    precision, when your conscious mind became aware that bark was bark and sap was
    sap? No, you cannot. I told you so.

    This does leave me with something of a quandary, however. In keeping with the
    abstruse yet brilliant method I have devised to select a daily topic for these
    essays, today, October the nineteenth, was always going to be devoted to the bark
    and the sap of trees. I could have chucked out my scheme, of course, and chosen
    a completely different topic at random, such as the Merovingian kings or the Munich
    Air Disaster or Peter, Paul, and Mary or the Oxford comma. But I was, I am, very
    reluctant to do so, for fear of inviting the blind toads of mental havoc into
    my head. Sticking with the method keeps those fearsome creatures at bay. Through
    the constraint imposed on me by the method, not only do I not have to think for
    a second what I am going to write about, but my brain remains in a state of sweet
    and lovely calm. If once I allow those blind toads in, God and all his angels
    help me, that''s all I can say.

    So first thing this morning I got the bucket and the pliers and the tarpaulin
    and the pebble, and I did the thing with the dainty teaspoon, and then I ran my
    finger along the row and down the column, and scribbled the number in my jotter,
    and checked the number against the print-out, and returned the bucket and the
    pliers and the tarpaulin and the pebble to their respective places, and gazed
    into the frosted glass, and after a few further procedures I arrived at the bark
    and the sap as today''s topic. So far so good.

    But then I thought, everybody knows the difference between the bark and the sap,
    don''t they? I can''t tell them anything they don''t know already. So closely
    interknit are the lives of human beings and trees, at least in this land, green
    and pleasant, that we learn to know bark as bark and sap as sap, and bark from
    sap and sap from bark, very early, so early that we cannot remember when it lodged
    within our brains. I suppose it might well be different for people who grow up
    in treeless landscapes, deserts for example, or ice-girt polar wastelands. They
    might find out about trees at a comparatively later stage in their development,
    late enough to recall. But even those people still know, so me banging on about
    the subject would still be pointless.

    I briefly amused myself by inserting a hidden ''bark'' into my opening sentence,
    within the word ''embarking'', and pondered doing the same with ''sap'' before
    realising that such tomfoolery might open a door or slit or vent or duct through
    which the blind toads of mental havoc could come hopping into my head. That I
    must avoid at all costs.

    The topic determined through the method, though, made no mention of trees. The
    bark and the sap may not be tree bark and tree sap but quite other barks and saps
    entirely. The bark, for instance, might be the barking of a dog, and the sap might
    be the lead-weighted leather thumping instrument with which malefactors fell innocents
    in certain episodes of criminality in alleyways in the night-time. Such saps are
    often deployed in the film noir genre. Thinking of crime, and more precisely of
    crime fiction, we might posit that a malefactor is sapping an innocent in a night-time
    alleyway while, just a few yards away, a dog is not barking. This is of course
    a reference to the Conan Doyle story "Silver Blaze" (1892), in which Sherlock
    Holmes alludes to "the curious incident of the dog in the night-time".

    We might make the malefactor Babinsky, the lumbering, walrus-moustached, psychopathic
    serial killer. He usually goes rampaging about with an axe or a big slicing thing
    rather than a sap, but we can assume on this occasion he is varying his modus
    operandi to throw the coppers off the scent. Who should we choose for our innocent?
    It could be anybody from Ned Slop--newly installed with an alien brain from outer
    space--to Tiny Enid, though it is unlikely that the plucky fascist tot would ever
    allow herself to be outwitted by Babinsky. Still, we are getting somewhere.

    The dog, though, remains something of a problem. It is only here because it is
    a beast that barks, and if it does not bark then, according to the method, we
    have failed to address the topic. One can sense the blind toads gathering at the
    edges of our reason.

    In the circumstances, it might be best to ditch Babinsky and the innocent and
    the silent dog, the dark alleyway in the night-time, and to return to daylight,
    and trees, tree bark and tree sap, a copse, a spinney, a forest, or a lone pine
    or plane tall upon a promontory, silhouetted against a blazing sky, windswept
    and forlorn. We would have to concede the near-impossibility of bashing out a
    thousandish words on the bark and the sap, but we could rest easier knowing that
    the blind toads of mental havoc had been banished from our head, on today of all
    days, Friday the nineteenth of October in the year of Our Lord MMXII.'
