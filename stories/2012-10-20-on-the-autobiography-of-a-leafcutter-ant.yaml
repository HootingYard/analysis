  text: 'Call me Tzipi. I am a leafcutter ant. I was born to a queen in a colony in
    an area of Central America rich in vegetation. I do not know who my father was,
    exactly, because like most winged female ants my mother the queen had hundreds
    of mates to collect the three hundred million or so sperm she needed during her
    revuada.

    When my mother lost her wings she settled on a patch of rich vegetation near a
    citrus plantation to found the colony. She had a little store of mycelium from
    the parental fungus garden in her infrabuccal pocket, and that got us started.

    I am a leafcutter ant of the type known as a media, a general forager. Among my
    siblings are other mediae, and minims, minors and majors. Shortly after I came
    into the world I set about doing my bit for the colony. In a column of other mediae,
    I marched from our little fungus garden towards the citrus plantation. It was
    an arduous journey, as we had to negotiate treacherous terrain and at the same
    time fend off attacks by phorid flies which, given half the chance, would lay
    their parasitic eggs in the crevices of our heads. When we got to the citrus plantation
    we lined up and took it in turns to cut a little section of leaf from the foliage,
    not so small that it was barely worth the bother, but not so big that we would
    become exhausted from carrying it. Then we made our way back the way we had come,
    marching across treacherous terrain and fending off the phorid flies with the
    help of our little minims sitting on our backs. When we got back to the colony
    we deposited our leaf-fragments in the fungus garden, and turned around, and then
    again we marched from our little fungus garden towards the citrus plantation.
    It was an arduous journey, as we had to negotiate treacherous terrain and at the

    to the colony we deposited our leaf-fragments in the fungus garden, and turned
    around, and then again we marched from our little fungus garden towards the citrus
    plantation.

    After about twenty-four hours we had managed to completely defoliate an entire
    citrus tree, so on our next visit to the plantation we veered off from our previous
    course and began cutting bits of leaves from a new tree. Unfortunately, the Central
    American citrus fruit farmer whose plantation we were trespassing upon, and gradually
    destroying, had noticed our depredations. He was livid. He stomped off back to
    his casa, presumably to fetch some form of leafcutter ant slaughtering device.
    We quickly took a bit of leaf each from the new tree and marched back to the colony.

    There we found chaos, in the form of a virulent strain of Escovopsis, a necrotic
    parasite. It threatened our food source and, thus, the colony itself. Luckily,
    just in the nick of time, we were all able to secrete Actinobacteria, genus Pseudonocardia
    from our metapleural glands, and that protected us. Given that this Actinobacteria
    is the source of virtually all antibiotics used by humans, it struck me that the
    citrus fruit farmer was being a bit ungrateful.

    Anyway, after all this marching and carrying and secreting we were quite tired,
    so we sat about munching on stuff from the fungal garden. Mother looked on contentedly.
    It grew dark, and we heard all sorts of nocturnal birds and beasts screeching
    and howling.

    The next morning, we decided to avoid the plantation of the livid citrus fruit
    farmer. The splendid thing about this part of the world is that there is such
    a sheer profusion of vegetation. We headed off to a neighbouring citrus plantation.
    It was an arduous journey, as we had to negotiate treacherous terrain and at the
    same time fend off attacks by phorid flies which, given half the chance, would
    lay their parasitic eggs in the crevices of our heads. When we got to the new
    citrus plantation we lined up and took it in turns to cut a little section of
    leaf from the foliage, not so small that it was barely worth the bother, but not
    so big that we would become exhausted from carrying it. Then we made our way back
    the way we had come, marching across treacherous terrain and fending off the phorid
    flies with the help of our little minims sitting on our backs. When we got back
    to the colony we deposited our leaf-fragments in the fungus garden. Such is life.'
