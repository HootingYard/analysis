  text: "There is a patch of ground I often pass, when I am walking from the chalet\
    \ to the bins, and it is rife with bugloss and vipers. I composed, in my head,\
    \ a little song about it. The lyrics were as follows:\nThere is a patch of ground\
    \ I pass\n  It's rife with bugloss 'n' vipers\n  Bugloss is a rough-haired herb,\
    \ it is akin to borage\n  Just in case you didn't know, the latter rhymes with\
    \ 'courage'\n  The viper, like an asp, crawls the earth upon its belly\n  If you\
    \ have not courage, your legs will turn to jelly\n  Vipers and bugloss in that\
    \ patch\n  Let us sing our jolly catch\n  Bugloss and vipers 'twixt chalet and\
    \ bins\n  Let us confess our several sins\n  Lust! Envy! Pride! Wrath!\n  Gluttony!\
    \ Greed! And! Sloth!\nI devised a simple tune to which the words could be sung,\
    \ but let's face it, I do not have a musical bone in my body. What I heard in\
    \ my head was pleasing enough, and made my little potters between chalet and bins\
    \ a highlight of my otherwise soul-sickening days. But I knew that if my song\
    \ were ever to be professionally recorded, and become a smash hit single, and\
    \ be performed in packed stadia to adoring crowds waving the flames of their lit\
    \ cigarette lighters, it would need a better singer than me, and a better tune\
    \ than the one I had given it. And so I went in search of a collaborator.\nOne\
    \ evening I left the chalet and passed the patch of ground rife with bugloss and\
    \ vipers, but I did not stop when I reached the bins. No! I pressed on, indefatigably,\
    \ until I arrived, about an hour later, at the folk club. Here, I thought, I was\
    \ likely to find a person with musical talent who could set my words to a memorable\
    \ and globally-adored tune. I sat down on a wooden chair near the back and listened\
    \ to various folk sing various folk songs. There was much fol de rol and rusticism,\
    \ repeated references to abstruse agricultural implements, and a smattering of\
    \ disaster in mineshaft and on the sea.\nDuring the interval, I approached one\
    \ or two persons whose songs had brought tears to my eyes. I wanted to ascertain\
    \ that my future collaborator had a \"feel\" for both bugloss and vipers. I cannot\
    \ put it more precisely than that. It was not that they needed to be obsessive,\
    \ maniacal, about the herb and the snake, more that they harboured due appreciation\
    \ of both, knew a sprig of bugloss when they saw it, could tell a viper from an\
    \ asp or a boa constrictor. To winkle out of my putative collaborators whether\
    \ or not they met my requirements, I had prepared a couple of questions.\n\"What\
    \ do you know of bugloss?\" I said to the first folkie I buttonholed. He was an\
    \ hairy man with a lairy eye, who had earlier sung a lengthy dirge about hedging\
    \ and ditching.\n\"The herb related to comfrey and hounds-tongue and borage?\"\
    \ he rapped back. I noted that he pronounced the latter to rhyme with 'porridge',\
    \ and my heart sank.\n\"Yes, that bugloss, none other,\" I said.\n\"Not much,\"\
    \ he said, \"Other than that there is a type of bugloss called viper's bugloss,\
    \ also known as blueweed.\"\nThis was news to me. My jaw dropped and my heart\
    \ began to beat very fast.\n\"What about vipers?\" I babbled, \"What know you\
    \ of vipers?\"\n\"Funny you should ask that,\" he said, \"For when I am not strumming\
    \ my banjo and wailing mournful dirges in folk clubs up and down the land I am\
    \ often to be found haunting the bottomless viper pits of both Gaar and Shoeburyness.\
    \ I have kiosks at both viper pits, selling a variety of souvenirs and knick-knacks.\"\
    \nI fainted.\nWhen I came to, it was to find a jet of ice cold water being sprayed\
    \ into my face. I was lying on the sawdusty floor of the folk club, a gaggle of\
    \ concerned folkies gathered about me. My collar had been loosed, my hair mussed,\
    \ my forehead rubbed. None of the faces gazing at me was that of the hairy man\
    \ with the lairy eye.\n\"That man I was talking to . . .\" I managed to mumble,\
    \ \"Where is he?\"\nBut nobody seemed to know who I was talking about. I began\
    \ to wonder if he had been a figment of my pre-swoon imagination. I staggered\
    \ to my feet and charged about the folk club in search of him, and then outside,\
    \ in the pitch dark, in the middle of nowhere. Not knowing his name, I cried \"\
    Hairy man! Hairy man!\" repeatedly, into the night, in vain.\nAt dawn I returned\
    \ to the chalet. Almost there, I passed by the bins, and then the patch of ground\
    \ rife with bugloss and vipers. In my mind's eye I saw the swaying crowds in the\
    \ stadium, lighters held aloft, hypnotised. And I heard, in my head, a melody\
    \ so beautiful, and one that fit my words so perfectly, that I burst into tears,\
    \ and sank to my knees. Unfortunately I sank slap bang in the middle of the patch,\
    \ and an enraged viper uncoiled itself and stabbed its fangs right through the\
    \ tweed of my trousers and into my soft soft flesh, just above the knee.\n\"Ouch!\"\
    \ I cried.\nAs the venom coursed through my veins, and I began to lose consciousness,\
    \ a vision of an hairy man with a lairy eye swam before my eyes. He had a banjo,\
    \ upon which he began to strum a beauteous melody, and then he began to sing .\
    \ . ."
