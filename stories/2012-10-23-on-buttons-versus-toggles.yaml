  text: 'Oh!, how the past shrivels and vanishes, so we can scarce believe it was
    ever quick and throbbing and so very alive. When we cast back but fifty years,
    how hard it is to understand the passions that impelled our so recent forebears.
    Who, now, would get in a tizz about an issue that divided the nation half a century
    ago? Yet at the time, kin were set against kin, men of the cloth fulminated from
    the pulpit, all was clash and strife. I speak of course of that great controversy,
    button versus toggle.

    We may respond, today, with wry chuckles. Few if any of us would now identify
    ourselves as, exclusively, buttoneers or togglists. But that is how it was, then,
    for a brief but seething period. The method you chose to fasten your coat took
    on fantastical importance. And you did wear a coat, at all times, in all weathers.
    It might have been a raincoat or a duffel coat, but you did not step outdoors
    unclad in it. Many wore their coats indoors too, the more fanatical, those who
    sought to proclaim their buttoneering or togglism the loudest.

    It is instructive, when we consider such historical flaps, to consult the photographic
    evidence, where that is possible. In this case we are fortunate to have at least
    one riveting snap which shows how one family was caught up in the madness.


    These are the four children of Mr and Mrs Turpitude of Shoeburyness. From left
    to right, they are Ulf, Ulg, Clothgard, and Urk. What is immediately apparent
    is that Ulg is a buttoneer and his brother Urk a togglist. Ulf and Clothgard are
    partly hidden behind their siblings, but nevertheless clearly visible are two
    buttons (Ulf) and one button (Clothgard). What we have, then, is the progeny of
    a single family riven by the great controversy of the day.

    Further study of the snap raises all sorts of questions. We note the eerie countenances
    of the four tinies, their blank yet somehow threatening gazes. If we were to put
    them in order of malevolence, from most malevolent to least, we might say Ulg
    then Urk then Clothgard then Ulf. Obviously there is room for manoeuvre and we
    may wish to swap them about. But what is plain is that each of their gazes is
    fixed upon the same target, out of shot, next to or just behind the shoulder of
    the snapper. This is contrary to what we would expect, which would be for Ulf
    and Ulg and Clothgard to be lined up in a terrible row of buttoneers against the
    lone togglist Urk. Internecine conflict was commonplace at the time, and it is
    surely odd to find the Turpitude tinies arrayed together, the three with buttons
    and the one with toggles, seemingly in unison.

    It is of course entirely plausible that within seconds of the snap being taken,
    Ulf and Ulg and Clothgard turned on Urk and beat him to death with a garden spade,
    then using the spade to dig a pit in which to bury his battered corpse. There
    is evidence that such an enormity took place among a group of siblings in a ness
    other than Shoeburyness, possibly Foulness or Dungeness, around this time. (See
    ''Togglist tot beaten to death with spade by siblings'', News o'' the Ness, p.7,
    23 October 1962, available in all good Nessy newspaper archives.) That the same
    thing happened up and down the land is not unlikely, though it was tragic, and
    spawned several novels, plays, ballets, opera bouffes, and art installations.

    We might also pause to study the alignment of buttons on Ulg''s coat and of toggles
    on Urk''s. Let us take them in alphabetical order. I think it is fair to say that
    Ulg must have been a zealot among buttoneers. Not only are his buttons aligned
    with impeccable neatness and regularity but, tellingly, only three of them actually
    serve as buttons. That is, a mere fifty per cent of his buttons are used to fasten
    his coat. The remaining three serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever. We might
    dub them ''redundant'' or ''dummy'' or ''toy'' buttons. It was a mark of the more
    fanatical buttoneers that they would often sport pointless buttons upon their
    coats. This was not always done with the sense of neatness and balance demonstrated
    by Ulg. There were wild stories of buttoneers displaying a chaotic mass of buttons
    higgledy-piggledy upon their coats. We can surmise that Ulg was a buttoneer of
    the kind who wished to disguise his toy buttons as real ones. Certainly if one
    passed him on the pavement as he swept by, without looking too closely, it would
    be possible to "see" buttonholes where in fact there were none.

    The comparison with Urk and his toggles is intriguing. Rather than the regular
    disposition of buttons we see on Ulg, with Urk we have something stranger. There
    is a stray "top" toggle and, further down, there appears to be that most anomalous
    of features, a missing toggle. The untoggled loop of cloth on his coat is clearly
    visible. One explanation for this is that a fight between the siblings had already
    begun before they stopped to pose for the camera. In that fight, Urk''s missing
    toggle could have been ripp''d from his coat by Ulf or Ulg or Clothgard. If so,
    where is it? It may have fallen on the ground, or it may be that Ulf or Ulg or
    Clothgard, at the approach of the snapper, popped it into their mouth. Can we
    see a telltale bulge in the cheek of any of the three? I think we can! Look very
    very closely at Ulf. His right cheek seems decidedly puffier than his left. There,
    I would maintain, is the missing toggle. When the snapper departs, and the buttoneers
    take the spade to set about Urk, Ulf spits the toggle out on to the ground and
    grinds it under his boot.

    Such were the frenzies of that distant time. Weirdly, at the turn of the year,
    in the depth of that frozen winter of 1962-63, when people really did need to
    wrap up warm in their coats, the mania passed as suddenly as it had begun, and
    nobody cared two figs about buttons and toggles ever again. Instead, they got
    all worked up about figs. But that is another tale for another day.'
