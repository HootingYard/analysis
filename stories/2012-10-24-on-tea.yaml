  text: "Thomas de Quincey said that tea was the favoured beverage of intellectuals.\
    \ I have made it my life's work to test every claim ever made by de Quincey, so\
    \ to this end I decided to gather a smattering of intellectuals and plop cups\
    \ of tea in front of them to see what would happen.\nIf de Quincey was right,\
    \ each intellectual would lift the cup to their lips and drink deep and thereafter\
    \ emit an \u201Caah!\u201D of satisfaction. At least one would say something along\
    \ the lines of \u201Cthere is nothing quite like a nice cup of tea\u201D.\nConversely,\
    \ if de Quincey was wrong, then the intellectuals would pick up the cups, pour\
    \ the tea into the gutter, and fill the now empty cups with hooch from a flask\
    \ taken from their pockets. They would then glug the hooch before emitting the\
    \ same \u201Caah!\u201D of satisfaction, this time accompanied by a belch of alcoholic\
    \ fumes strong enough to fell an ox.\nI was interested to see what would happen.\n\
    But before distributing the cups of tea, I realised that I had to make absolutely\
    \ sure the persons I gathered, at the trestle table in the field under the viaduct,\
    \ were indeed intellectuals. My experiment would be hopelessly compromised if\
    \ just one of them was a dimwit or peasant or was otherwise unintellectual. My\
    \ assistant, Mungo, he of the hunchback and twisted face and slobber, had given\
    \ me a very sensible piece of advice.\n\u201CUurggh, Master!\u201D he had slobbered,\
    \ the day before, \u201CJust because someone has a beard and is French and bespectacled\
    \ and gesticulates wildly when speaking of things you do not understand is no\
    \ guarantee that they are an intellectual.\u201D\nI took this to heart. How easily\
    \ the wool could have been pulled over my eyes had I not listened to Mungo!\n\
    Incidentally, in case you were wondering, Mungo himself does not drink tea. His\
    \ favoured beverage is brackish water from a spigot, gulped from a battered tin\
    \ beaker. But he does not claim to be an intellectual. Quite the opposite. Mungo\
    \ has often told me that he has only half a brain, and that half befuddled. He\
    \ is, however, absolutely invaluable as an assistant, when I can persuade him\
    \ to come down from the belfry where he likes to cavort and lollop with his pet\
    \ owls and bats and scorpions.\nMindful of Mungo's advice, I went roaming the\
    \ streets on the lookout for possible intellectuals. At first I buttonholed anybody\
    \ whose head resembled an egg. As I grabbed their collars, I fired at each of\
    \ these persons a question.\n\u201CAre you an intellectual?\u201D I cried.\nIf\
    \ they answered in the affirmative, I asked a supplementary question, to wit;\
    \ \u201CWhat abstruse theorem would you posit to account for the unconscionable\
    \ delay in the completion of the roadworks on the Blister Lane bypass?\u201D\n\
    If the egghead claimed to be above such petty everyday concerns as roadworks,\
    \ and to never have even heard of Blister Lane, I dismissed them. A true intellectual,\
    \ I reasoned, while being above such petty everyday concerns as roadworks, and\
    \ never having even heard of Blister Lane, would nonetheless have an abstruse\
    \ theorem to posit, even though it might be utterly meaningless to a mere mortal\
    \ such as myself who knew the roadworks and the bypass and the delay like the\
    \ back of his hand.\nBy this tactic, I found it devilishly difficult to find a\
    \ single intellectual. My Thomas de Quincey tea experiment was unravelling before\
    \ it had even begun! I decided to broaden the scope of my search and to accost\
    \ those persons whose heads did not look much like eggs, though I stopped short\
    \ of questioning anybody whose head resembled a potato, for obvious reasons.\n\
    This was to be my undoing. Seeing me approach various persons sashaying about\
    \ the streets but pointedly ignoring him, a man with a potato-shaped head lumbered\
    \ towards me and cornered me in the doorway of a butcher's shop.\n\u201COi!\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CYou are stopping all sorts of people to ask if they are intellectuals,\
    \ but you have pointedly ignored me.\u201D\nI blathered some rubbish. He whacked\
    \ me on the windpipe and bundled me into the back of a van. He then drove off\
    \ at speed.\nSome time later, the van screeched to a halt. He dragged me out and,\
    \ threatening me with his fist, commanded me to follow him. He had parked at the\
    \ edge of a forest, and it was into the dense trees we now went. I was terrified,\
    \ and wished Mungo were with me. But I had left him in his belfry, brewing a large\
    \ pot of tea.\nEventually my abductor and I arrived at a clearing. There was a\
    \ bonfire, around which sat a group of men each of whom had a potato-head, some\
    \ even more potatoey than the man who had brought me here. One of these rogues\
    \ looked up at me, and spoke.\n\u201CWelcome,\u201D he said, \u201CWe are the\
    \ woodland chapter of the Potato-Headed League of Acolytes of Alain de Botton.\
    \ A denser concentration of intellectuals you could not hope to find for miles\
    \ and miles hereabouts.\u201D\nAll I could say in reply was \u201CGosh!\u201D\n\
    I noted that they all had well-thumbed and heavily annotated copies of A Week\
    \ At The Airport (2009), the Swiss sage's book based on his stint as writer-in-residence\
    \ at Heathrow Airport and one of the decisive intellectual tours de force of the\
    \ past hundred years. If I needed any proof that these potato-heads were intellectuals,\
    \ here it was!\n\u201CPerhaps you'd care to join us for a nice cup of\u2014\u201D\
    \ said the leader. But I did not hear the last word, because at that moment a\
    \ flock of woodland birds began to shriek, deafeningly, from their perches in\
    \ the trees."
