  text: "\nWho is the third who always walks beside you?\n  When I count, there are\
    \ only you and I together\n  But when I look ahead up the white road\n  There\
    \ is always another one walking beside you.\nT. S. Eliot's note on these lines\
    \ from The Waste Land explains that they \"were stimulated by the account of one\
    \ of the Antarctic expeditions . . . that the party of explorers, at the extremity\
    \ of their strength, had the constant delusion that there was one more member\
    \ than could actually be counted\".\nThe account was by Ernest Shackleton, of\
    \ the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-17. The explorer was reluctant\
    \ to speak of the extra man, who, \"during that long and racking march of thirty-six\
    \ hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, it seemed to\
    \ me\" joined him and his companions. It has long been believed that he--it?--was\
    \ an incorporeal being, a spirit guide, summoned by Shackleton's brain through\
    \ \"monotony, darkness, barren landscapes, isolation, cold, injury, dehydration,\
    \ hunger, fatigue and fear\", as Michael Shermer put it in an article in the Scientific\
    \ American. A similar delusion is said to have affected others, including the\
    \ transatlantic pilot and accidental baby-killer* Charles Lindbergh, who sensed\
    \ the presence of a ghostly co-pilot on his solo flight.\nA recent discovery by\
    \ boffins in Antarctica, however, suggests that there actually was an extra man\
    \ with Shackleton's party. A manuscript, entitled I Was Shackleton's Extra Man,\
    \ was found encased in ice on a stray floe somewhere between South Georgia and\
    \ the Antarctic ice-mass. It was so well preserved that, when thawed out, the\
    \ ink was still not dry. Unfortunately, slapdash handling by an over-eager boffin\
    \ resulted in smudging, rendering parts of the text illegible. What follows are\
    \ passages from this historic document.\nGood evening. My name is [smudged]. You\
    \ do not know me. You have never known me. You will never know me. But if ever\
    \ you trek with sledge and husky across the great ice continent of the south,\
    \ you might see me. There! That is me, up ahead of the rest of the group, trudging\
    \ through the snow. That is me, lolling behind, never quite catching up with the\
    \ main party. That is me, over to the side, left or right, just out of earshot.\
    \ I am always with you but never quite with you. But I am no figment. I am all\
    \ too real.\nI first arrived in Antarctica in [smudged], the first man ever to\
    \ set foot here. I was here before Scott, before Amundsen, before Arthur Gordon\
    \ Pym of Nantucket. I was here when the world was young. I cannot remember quite\
    \ how I found myself here. One minute I was lounging in a hammock in the daffodil-strewn\
    \ garden of [smudged], then I was out at sea on some kind of raft, and it was\
    \ cold, and I shivered, and everything was white, the sky and the sea and the\
    \ ice.\nI made landfall. The raft was crushed by pack ice. I headed for the interior,\
    \ but soon enough I was walking around in circles, my mind both numbed and unhinged\
    \ by monotony, darkness, the barren landscape, isolation, cold, injury, dehydration,\
    \ hunger, fatigue and fear. I would have gone to pieces, but at the end of my\
    \ tether I was befriended by penguins, who took me to their colony and nursed\
    \ me back to health on a diet of fish and algae and a rigorous exercise regime\
    \ of swimming and flapping my arms and legs.\nThe years passed in a white ice\
    \ haze, and I was content. But one day I woke up and I was filled with a hankering\
    \ for home. I longed for the daffodil-strewn garden, the hammock, and suddenly\
    \ memories came flooding back, of [smudged] and Captain Nitty and the betting\
    \ shop and [smudged] and the riotous parties up at the Big House and crates of\
    \ negus and [smudged] and bouquets of enormous genetically modified crocuses.\
    \ I had to return. With tears in my eyes, tears which turned instantly to icicles,\
    \ I bid farewell to my penguin friends and trudged away across the ice and snow.\n\
    It was weeks later when I came across a group of explorers. I was no longer used\
    \ to the company of men, so while I shadowed them I kept my distance, always enough\
    \ distance to avoid having to speak, to explain myself, to tell my story. What\
    \ was there to tell? Nothing of note ever happens here. Time stops. I had no idea\
    \ how many years had passed, seven or seventy or seven hundred.\nWhen the explorers\
    \ were asleep in their tents, I crept closer and went rummaging in the stores\
    \ lashed to their sledges, the cases packed with monogrammed silver cutlery, backgammon\
    \ boards, cigar cases, clothes brushes, tins of button polish, and copies of The\
    \ Vicar Of Wakefield. I confess I helped myself to certain items, but never stole\
    \ anything important.\nAnd then one day I went a bit too far ahead, or fell too\
    \ far behind, I cannot remember which, and the explorers vanished in the mist,\
    \ and I never saw them again.\nBut luckily this was the golden age of polar exploration,\
    \ and soon enough there was another raggle-taggle band of doughty chaps struggling\
    \ with sledges and huskies across the ice. I joined them, too, in my just-out-of-reach\
    \ way, hoping if I followed them we would arrive back at their ship, and I could\
    \ stow away upon it, and return at last to [smudged] and daffodils.\nYet so incompetent\
    \ were all these chaps that I ended up as I had begun, going round and round in\
    \ hopeless circles. I am still here, lost in the ice, hankering for home, salty\
    \ icicles dripping down my cheeks.\nTomorrow I shall get a gun and shoot an albatross.\n\
