  text: "Dear Mr Key\n  Down the pub the other night--the Cow & Pins, if you want\
    \ to know--me and my mates fell to discussing Hooting Yard. Though we broadly\
    \ approve of your work, we all agreed that, going forward, you need to be more\
    \ diverse 'n' vibrant, in keeping with the diversity 'n' vibrancy everybody keeps\
    \ going on about these days. So what are you going to do about it, chummy?\n \
    \ Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Thank you for your measured letter. You may not\
    \ have bothered to measure it before sending, but I took a tape measure to it\
    \ as soon as I opened the envelope. It pains me to say it, but I suspect you are\
    \ correct about the need to be more diverse 'n' vibrant. This is partly out of\
    \ self-interest, as I am sure that if I could prove my diversity 'n' vibrancy\
    \ I might become eligible for lots of grants from the kinds of organisations that\
    \ hand out grants to diverse 'n' vibrant initiatives. Then I would be rolling\
    \ in cash and could put my feet up while the diverse 'n' vibrant elves got on\
    \ with all the hard work and drudgery that makes Hooting Yard such a well-loved\
    \ community resource. I am stymied, however, by not knowing quite how to become\
    \ diverse 'n' vibrant. Perhaps you and your mates could give me some tips?\n \
    \ Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n  We had a good old natter about your letter down at\
    \ the Cow & Pins last night. We all agreed that elves were a good start if you\
    \ intend to be more diverse going forward. A diverse intake of elves would be\
    \ even better, so try to recruit different types. Somewhere there is a list of\
    \ goblin types, and I'm sure you could adapt this for elves. Well done, and keep\
    \ up the good work!\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  I think you have misunderstood,\
    \ perhaps wilfully, my earlier letter. I cannot afford to recruit a single elf\
    \ until I get one of those lavish grants awarded to diverse 'n' vibrant community\
    \ initiatives, but I can't get a lavish grant until I prove how diverse 'n' vibrant\
    \ I am. What a dilemma! Please resolve it.\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n  I feel\
    \ your pain, I really do. We all do, sat here in the snug of the Cow & Pins downing\
    \ our pints. We had a long and detailed discussion about your case, and came to\
    \ the view that you might be able to get a grant if you were vibrant. Then you\
    \ could pay for some elves, and hey presto!, you'd be diverse too! Everybody wins.\n\
    \  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Many thanks for your considered advice. I would\
    \ act on it immediately if I had the merest clue of what 'vibrancy' consists,\
    \ precisely. The word is bandied about willy-nilly, but I confess I have never\
    \ understood what on earth it means. Please explain.\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n\
    \  You don't need to know what it means, you just need to get with the programme,\
    \ buster!\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Point taken. How?\n  Frank Key\nDear\
    \ Mr Key\n  I hope the following information is of help. Costa Coffee planned\
    \ to open a branch in Totnes, home of the vilified undertakers' mute. The company\
    \ has now withdrawn from the fray after meeting objections from middle-class people.\
    \ However, while their plans were still active, they issued a press statement\
    \ saying they aimed \"to add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local\
    \ community ... by adding vibrancy\". That is clear enough, Mr Key, so what's\
    \ stopping you?\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Now I have received your latest\
    \ letter, all that is stopping me from becoming vibrant is my woeful lack of design\
    \ skills. If I had the wit, I would immediately change the logo at the top of\
    \ the page to read \"Hooting Yard : A Website By Frank Key : Now With Added Vibrancy!\"\
    \ (I thought the addition of the exclamation mark would be a particularly vibrant\
    \ masterstroke.) If I understand you correctly, I could then apply for a grant,\
    \ on the basis of my vibrancy, then use that money to employ a gaggle of elves,\
    \ if of course 'gaggle' is the correct collective noun for plural elves. I would\
    \ then be both diverse 'n' vibrant and money would pour in to my coffers. Is that\
    \ right?\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n  Yes.\n  Tim Thurn\nDear Grant-Awarding Body\n\
    \  Hooting Yard is a diverse 'n' vibrant website going forward. Can I have a large\
    \ amount of money please?\n  Frank Key\nDear Mr Key\n  No you may not. In order\
    \ to qualify for a grant, you must not only be diverse 'n' vibrant going forward\
    \ but robust 'n' transparent to boot.\n  A. Git\nDear Mr Thurn\n  Please see the\
    \ enclosed letter from A. Git. I have an intractable problem, in that I am both\
    \ puny and opaque. Do you have any suggestions?\n  Frank Key\nBut answer came\
    \ there none. . ."
