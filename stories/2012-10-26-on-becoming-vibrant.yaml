  text: 'Dear Mr Key

    Down the pub the other night--the Cow & Pins, if you want to know--me and my mates
    fell to discussing Hooting Yard. Though we broadly approve of your work, we all
    agreed that, going forward, you need to be more diverse ''n'' vibrant, in keeping
    with the diversity ''n'' vibrancy everybody keeps going on about these days. So
    what are you going to do about it, chummy?

    Dear Mr Thurn

    Thank you for your measured letter. You may not have bothered to measure it before
    sending, but I took a tape measure to it as soon as I opened the envelope. It
    pains me to say it, but I suspect you are correct about the need to be more diverse
    ''n'' vibrant. This is partly out of self-interest, as I am sure that if I could
    prove my diversity ''n'' vibrancy I might become eligible for lots of grants from
    the kinds of organisations that hand out grants to diverse ''n'' vibrant initiatives.
    Then I would be rolling in cash and could put my feet up while the diverse ''n''
    vibrant elves got on with all the hard work and drudgery that makes Hooting Yard
    such a well-loved community resource. I am stymied, however, by not knowing quite
    how to become diverse ''n'' vibrant. Perhaps you and your mates could give me
    some tips?

    Dear Mr Key

    We had a good old natter about your letter down at the Cow & Pins last night.
    We all agreed that elves were a good start if you intend to be more diverse going
    forward. A diverse intake of elves would be even better, so try to recruit different
    types. Somewhere there is a list of goblin types, and I''m sure you could adapt
    this for elves. Well done, and keep up the good work!

    Tim Thurn

    Dear Mr Thurn

    I think you have misunderstood, perhaps wilfully, my earlier letter. I cannot
    afford to recruit a single elf until I get one of those lavish grants awarded
    to diverse ''n'' vibrant community initiatives, but I can''t get a lavish grant
    until I prove how diverse ''n'' vibrant I am. What a dilemma! Please resolve it.

    Frank Key

    Dear Mr Key

    I feel your pain, I really do. We all do, sat here in the snug of the Cow & Pins
    downing our pints. We had a long and detailed discussion about your case, and
    came to the view that you might be able to get a grant if you were vibrant. Then
    you could pay for some elves, and hey presto!, you''d be diverse too! Everybody
    wins.

    Dear Mr Thurn

    Many thanks for your considered advice. I would act on it immediately if I had
    the merest clue of what ''vibrancy'' consists, precisely. The word is bandied
    about willy-nilly, but I confess I have never understood what on earth it means.
    Please explain.

    Frank Key

    Dear Mr Key

    You don''t need to know what it means, you just need to get with the programme,
    buster!

    Dear Mr Thurn

    Point taken. How?

    Frank Key

    Dear Mr Key

    I hope the following information is of help. Costa Coffee planned to open a branch
    in Totnes, home of the vilified undertakers'' mute. The company has now withdrawn
    from the fray after meeting objections from middle-class people. However, while
    their plans were still active, they issued a press statement saying they aimed
    "to add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local community ... by adding
    vibrancy". That is clear enough, Mr Key, so what''s stopping you?

    Tim Thurn

    Dear Mr Thurn

    Now I have received your latest letter, all that is stopping me from becoming
    vibrant is my woeful lack of design skills. If I had the wit, I would immediately
    change the logo at the top of the page to read "Hooting Yard : A Website By Frank
    Key : Now With Added Vibrancy!" (I thought the addition of the exclamation mark
    would be a particularly vibrant masterstroke.) If I understand you correctly,
    I could then apply for a grant, on the basis of my vibrancy, then use that money
    to employ a gaggle of elves, if of course ''gaggle'' is the correct collective
    noun for plural elves. I would then be both diverse ''n'' vibrant and money would
    pour in to my coffers. Is that right?

    Frank Key

    Dear Mr Key

    Yes.

    Tim Thurn

    Dear Grant-Awarding Body

    Hooting Yard is a diverse ''n'' vibrant website going forward. Can I have a large
    amount of money please?

    Frank Key

    *

    Dear Mr Key

    No you may not. In order to qualify for a grant, you must not only be diverse
    ''n'' vibrant going forward but robust ''n'' transparent to boot.

    A. Git

    Dear Mr Thurn

    Please see the enclosed letter from A. Git. I have an intractable problem, in
    that I am both puny and opaque. Do you have any suggestions?

    Frank Key

    But answer came there none . . .'
