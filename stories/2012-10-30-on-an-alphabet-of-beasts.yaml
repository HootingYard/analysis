  text: "I have been thinking for some time now that it would be a very good idea\
    \ to publish a bestiary. The Hooting Yard Book o\u2019 Beasts would be an ornament\
    \ to any library. Of course, before publishing it I would have to write the thing,\
    \ but it may be that I could compile an anthology based on extant texts. (A similar\
    \ approach, taking selected extracts from my work to illuminate particular subject\
    \ matter, is currently being pursued by the artist James Beckett. His lavish book\
    \ of \u201CWorks\u201D, subtitled \u201CWith constant interjections by Frank Key\u201D\
    , is currently in preparation, due out early next year. I will keep you informed.)\n\
    The best format for my bestiary, I think, would be to follow an alphabetic scheme,\
    \ thus A is for Anaconda, B is for Bird, C is for Cow, etc. Let us consider, for\
    \ a moment, just those three. It strikes me that I may not have mentioned, anywhere\
    \ in my teeming morass of verbiage, the anaconda. So I might have to make up something\
    \ new and snakey. With birds, however, I am on firmer ground. Indeed, I have to\
    \ admit that one of the compelling motives for compiling a bestiary in the first\
    \ place is the opportunity it would give me to show off my quite startling\u2014\
    and starling\u2014ornithological knowledge. I know for a fact that I have several\
    \ readers who only come here, daily, for what they call the \u201Cbirdy stuff\u201D\
    , and who grow quite impatient if I neglect to make mention of birds for any period\
    \ of time. They tend to write intemperate letters, packed with invective, making\
    \ known their disapproval. Often I find, within the envelopes, vestiges of feather,\
    \ and the occasional regurgitated owl pellet.\nSomebody less conscientious would\
    \ crumple these letters and toss them into a wastepaper basket unread. Not me.\
    \ I read and reread them, several times, making annotations in the margins with\
    \ a propelling pencil, and then I file them away in a large and imposing padlocked\
    \ filing cabinet. Let me give you an example of one such letter. I have redacted\
    \ the whingey whiny complaining bit where my correspondent moans that I haven't\
    \ mentioned birds for a few days, leaving the part I wish to advert to, which\
    \ demonstrates how valuable a resource Hooting Yard can prove to be for the otherwise\
    \ bird-ignorant.\nDear Mr Key, [dozens of pages redacted]. Before I read Hooting\
    \ Yard, I used to be mystified by the sight of things with wings and beaks and\
    \ feathers and talons flying around in the air, sometimes swooping, sometimes\
    \ gliding. I had no idea what they were. Occasionally one of these things would\
    \ come to rest on the branch of a tree or on a fencepost, and then I would try\
    \ to take a closer look, but at my approach, panting and snorting and stamping\
    \ towards it in my big heavy boots, it would invariably take to the air again\
    \ and fly away, to the point of invisibility. As the years went by I became increasingly\
    \ fretful and flummoxed, and I consulted both opticians, in case there was something\
    \ wrong with my eyesight, and brain doctors, in case there was something wrong\
    \ with my brain. Then, a couple of weeks ago, I had a curious dream in which the\
    \ words \u201CHooting\u201D and \u201CYard\u201D were repeatedly shouted into\
    \ my ear by a dwarf named Crepusco. I am exceedingly tall, but Crepusco was standing\
    \ on a stool. When I woke up, the words were still echoing inside my head, so\
    \ I looked them up in a large and imposing leather-bound reference book. Individually,\
    \ they did not appear to signal anything significant. I determined to forget about\
    \ the dream and to concern myself with more pressing matters, such as eating my\
    \ breakfast and paying my gas bill. But I could not shake the words out of my\
    \ bonce. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I eventually discovered your website\
    \ and proceeded to read everything you have written over the past nine years.\
    \ Then I read it all again, making annotations in a jotting pad with a propelling\
    \ pencil. I have been amazed to learn so much, so so much!, about those things\
    \ with wings and beaks and feathers and talons flying around in the air, sometimes\
    \ swooping, sometimes gliding, sometimes perched on tree branches or fenceposts,\
    \ which I now realise are birds. For that I am eternally grateful to you, Mr Key,\
    \ and I just wish you would stop wasting your time, and mine, by prattling on\
    \ about other, non-avian, subject matter.\nThat is fairly typical of the sort\
    \ of letters birdy enthusiasts send me, including the reference to dreams of the\
    \ dwarf Crepusco, which turns up with a frequency I am beginning to worry about.\
    \ In spite of these pleas, however, I am not persuaded to ditch all non-avian\
    \ subject matter from the broad magnificent sweep of what we might call Hooting\
    \ Yard praxis. It is tempting to do so, and to become a sort of one stop shop\
    \ for encyclopaedic ornithological wisdom, but it is a temptation I resist.\n\
    Clearly, however, in my planned alphabetic bestiary, B is for Bird is going to\
    \ be a very lengthy section, so lengthy that it might well unbalance the book.\
    \ If I worked on the basis of a volume of 260 pages, it would be sensible, and\
    \ neat and tidy, to allot ten pages to each beast from A to Z. Ten pages might\
    \ well exhaust my ability to say anything enlightening about the anaconda, and\
    \ indeed the cow, but the bird? The bird? How could I hope to cram into a mere\
    \ ten pages the full fruit of my birdy learning? Even if I used so tiny a typeface\
    \ that you would ruin your eyesight trying to read it, still, it is a well nigh\
    \ impossible task, a fool's errand.\nThis present postage is in itself evidence\
    \ of the difficulties I would face. Having set out to consider the anaconda, the\
    \ bird, and the cow, I find I have babbled on about our feathered friends to the\
    \ point where there is no space left to say anything remotely informative about\
    \ the cow. Perhaps the bestiary is not such a good idea after all. The Hooting\
    \ Yard Book o\u2019 Birds, though, now that is a different matter . . ."
