  text: 'I have been thinking for some time now that it would be a very good idea
    to publish a bestiary. The Hooting Yard Book o'' Beasts would be an ornament to
    any library. Of course, before publishing it I would have to write the thing,
    but it may be that I could compile an anthology based on extant texts. (A similar
    approach, taking selected extracts from my work to illuminate particular subject
    matter, is currently being pursued by the artist James Beckett. His lavish book
    of "Works", subtitled "With constant interjections by Frank Key", is currently
    in preparation, due out early next year. I will keep you informed.)

    The best format for my bestiary, I think, would be to follow an alphabetic scheme,
    thus A is for Anaconda, B is for Bird, C is for Cow, etc. Let us consider, for
    a moment, just those three. It strikes me that I may not have mentioned, anywhere
    in my teeming morass of verbiage, the anaconda. So I might have to make up something
    new and snakey. With birds, however, I am on firmer ground. Indeed, I have to
    admit that one of the compelling motives for compiling a bestiary in the first
    place is the opportunity it would give me to show off my quite startling--and
    starling--ornithological knowledge. I know for a fact that I have several readers
    who only come here, daily, for what they call the "birdy stuff", and who grow
    quite impatient if I neglect to make mention of birds for any period of time.
    They tend to write intemperate letters, packed with invective, making known their
    disapproval. Often I find, within the envelopes, vestiges of feather, and the
    occasional regurgitated owl pellet.

    Somebody less conscientious would crumple these letters and toss them into a wastepaper
    basket unread. Not me. I read and reread them, several times, making annotations
    in the margins with a propelling pencil, and then I file them away in a large
    and imposing padlocked filing cabinet. Let me give you an example of one such
    letter. I have redacted the whingey whiny complaining bit where my correspondent
    moans that I haven''t mentioned birds for a few days, leaving the part I wish
    to advert to, which demonstrates how valuable a resource Hooting Yard can prove
    to be for the otherwise bird-ignorant.

    Dear Mr Key, [dozens of pages redacted]. Before I read Hooting Yard, I used to
    be mystified by the sight of things with wings and beaks and feathers and talons
    flying around in the air, sometimes swooping, sometimes gliding. I had no idea
    what they were. Occasionally one of these things would come to rest on the branch
    of a tree or on a fencepost, and then I would try to take a closer look, but at
    my approach, panting and snorting and stamping towards it in my big heavy boots,
    it would invariably take to the air again and fly away, to the point of invisibility.
    As the years went by I became increasingly fretful and flummoxed, and I consulted
    both opticians, in case there was something wrong with my eyesight, and brain
    doctors, in case there was something wrong with my brain. Then, a couple of weeks
    ago, I had a curious dream in which the words "Hooting" and "Yard" were repeatedly
    shouted into my ear by a dwarf named Crepusco. I am exceedingly tall, but Crepusco
    was standing on a stool. When I woke up, the words were still echoing inside my
    head, so I looked them up in a large and imposing leather-bound reference book.
    Individually, they did not appear to signal anything significant. I determined
    to forget about the dream and to concern myself with more pressing matters, such
    as eating my breakfast and paying my gas bill. But I could not shake the words
    out of my bonce. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I eventually discovered your
    website and proceeded to read everything you have written over the past nine years.
    Then I read it all again, making annotations in a jotting pad with a propelling
    pencil. I have been amazed to learn so much, so so much!, about those things with
    wings and beaks and feathers and talons flying around in the air, sometimes swooping,
    sometimes gliding, sometimes perched on tree branches or fenceposts, which I now
    realise are birds. For that I am eternally grateful to you, Mr Key, and I just
    wish you would stop wasting your time, and mine, by prattling on about other,
    non-avian, subject matter.

    That is fairly typical of the sort of letters birdy enthusiasts send me, including
    the reference to dreams of the dwarf Crepusco, which turns up with a frequency
    I am beginning to worry about. In spite of these pleas, however, I am not persuaded
    to ditch all non-avian subject matter from the broad magnificent sweep of what
    we might call Hooting Yard praxis. It is tempting to do so, and to become a sort
    of one stop shop for encyclopaedic ornithological wisdom, but it is a temptation
    I resist.

    Clearly, however, in my planned alphabetic bestiary, B is for Bird is going to
    be a very lengthy section, so lengthy that it might well unbalance the book. If
    I worked on the basis of a volume of 260 pages, it would be sensible, and neat
    and tidy, to allot ten pages to each beast from A to Z. Ten pages might well exhaust
    my ability to say anything enlightening about the anaconda, and indeed the cow,
    but the bird? The bird? How could I hope to cram into a mere ten pages the full
    fruit of my birdy learning? Even if I used so tiny a typeface that you would ruin
    your eyesight trying to read it, still, it is a well nigh impossible task, a fool''s
    errand.

    This present postage is in itself evidence of the difficulties I would face. Having
    set out to consider the anaconda, the bird, and the cow, I find I have babbled
    on about our feathered friends to the point where there is no space left to say
    anything remotely informative about the cow. Perhaps the bestiary is not such
    a good idea after all. The Hooting Yard Book o'' Birds, though, now that is a
    different matter . . .'
