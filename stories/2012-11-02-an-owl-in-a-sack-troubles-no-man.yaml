  text: '

    Over at The Dabbler this week I take Peter Hitchens to task over the important
    subjects of knapsacks and trained owls.

    I am suddenly reminded of the saying An owl in a sack troubles no man, which as
    far as I remember was a winning entry in a long ago New Statesman competition
    to devise plausible-sounding yet wholly spurious proverbs.'
