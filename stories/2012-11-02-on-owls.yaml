  text: 'I Heard The Owl Call My Name was a bestseller in the 1970s, alongside such
    now neglected titles as Jonathan Livingston Seagull and Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle
    Maintenance. What all three had in common was a concern with the ultimate meaning
    of existence, or at least the meaning of existence in the specific context of
    blissed-out self-obsessed post-hippy North America. I actually read the latter
    two titles, in my misguided teendom, though thankfully I seem to have recovered
    from the experience with no ill effects. But I never got round to I Heard The
    Owl Call My Name, and thus it continues to intrigue me. Well, not to a debilitating
    extent. I do not wake up every morning fretting about it, nor have I sought to
    obtain a copy. What intrigues me is the title.

    The book was written by Margaret Craven. Now, over the years I have listened to
    numberless owls, and not one of them has ever uttered the cry "Margaret Craven",
    nor any sound remotely akin to it, no matter how strangulated the voice in which
    we pronounce it in an attempt to mimic an owl. Aha!, I hear you say, but I Heard
    The Owl Call My Name is a novel, is it not?, so perhaps the name the owl calls
    is that of a fictional narrator, rather than of a non-fictional author. This is
    a persuasive argument until one does a spot of research and discovers that the
    book concerns a dying Anglican vicar named Mark Brian. Again, "Mark Brian" is
    not by any stretch of the imagination the sort of sound made by any owl it has
    ever been my pleasure to hear, as I crunch through the duff on the forest floor
    in the dead of night, my lantern occasionally picking out the fugitive sight of
    a small scurrying mammal, its heart pounding in terror. It is in such a place,
    at such a time, that one is likely to hear owls hooting.

    We use the onomatopoeic word "hoot" to represent the call of an owl, or, if we
    are writing a children''s book, we might deploy "too-wit, too-woo". We will not,
    ever, use "Margaret Craven" or "Mark Brian", and if we ever had a dramatic brain-embranglement
    and did so, we would befuddle our readers utterly, to the point where they would
    probably toss our book aside in exasperation, and who would blame them for so
    doing?

    Now as I say, I have not read the book, so there is every possibility that perhaps
    the dying vicar has a parishioner named Biff Hoot or Ted Toowit or Sacheverell
    Toowoo, and it is this person who hears their name called by the owl, while crunching
    through the duff on the forest floor in the dead of night, their lantern occasionally
    picking out the fugitive sight of a small scurrying mammal, its heart pounding
    in terror. Biff, or Ted, or Sacheverell then scampers to the church to tell the
    vicar of this exciting turn of events, and to seek his judicious religious advice
    on what it might portend, in terms of the meaning of existence, only to find the
    vicar sprawled on the floorboards in front of the altar, dying.

    Why is he dying? Has he been attacked by owls, pecking at him with their beaks
    and slashing at him with their talons? Owls are more likely to set upon the small
    scurrying mammals in the nocturnal forest, rather than a human vicar in a candlelit
    church. So what might account for such a palaver? It could be that, rather than
    being a stereotypical beardy Anglican vicar, Mark Brian is an effeminate cross-dressing
    vicar who bears a startling resemblance to Tippi Hedren. In this scenario, the
    owls would simply be attempting to reenact a scene from Alfred Hitchcock''s documentary
    The Birds (1963). Or we might posit that, on the other side of the forest there
    is a sinister military-industrial hazchem facility, leakage from which the owls
    have been exposed to, transforming them from common or garden owls to science
    fiction monster owls of unbridled savagery.

    His life ebbing away, the vicar moans weakly for help, at which point Biff or
    Ted or Sacheverell comes scampering up the nave. He cradles Mark Brian''s torn
    and bloody head in his arms, and whispers, "I heard the owl call my name". The
    vicar''s eyelids flutter and his breath rattles. Does he still have strength enough
    to speak, and to reveal to his needy parishioner the ultimate meaning of existence?
    We would hope so, this being a 1970s bestseller.

    I Heard The Owl Call My Name (1967) predates both Jonathan Livingston Seagull
    (1970) and Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974). Could it be that
    both Richard Bach and Robert M. Pirsig were shameless plagiarists? Is the wisdom
    in their books lifted wholesale from Margaret Craven, who has the dying vicar
    vouchsafe to Biff or Ted or Sacheverell what it all means?

    "You say the owl called your name?", he gasps, "It is a sign. I understand the
    language of owls, and I think I know what it would have said next had you stayed
    to listen, instead of sprinting pell mell out of the forest and through the village
    and into the church and along the nave to come and cradle me in your arms in my
    dying moments."

    Biff or Ted or Sacheverell dabs at the vicar''s brow with a dampened rag, trying
    his best to comfort him, desperate to keep him alive long enough that he might
    impart the wisdom of the owl.

    "You must repair your motorcycle," groans Mark Brian, "And you must zoom upon
    it down to the seaside. There you will find a different form of bird life, seagulls
    rather than owls. The seagull will not call your name. It will swoop and scavenge
    and soar. Watch it carefully, in the dappled sunlight. Then..."

    But before he can complete the sentence--and thus divulge the ultimate meaning
    of 1970s existence--the vicar collapses and dies.

    I hope this is an adequate summary of a book I have never read. If it isn''t,
    it damned well ought to be.'
