  text: 'Cav and Pag went up the hill to sing a gorgeous aria. Cav fell down and broke
    his crown and Pag came tumbling after. Cav and Pag lay in the muck at the foot
    of the hill with dented heads. They sang a siren song, hoping to attract an ambulance
    with a proper blaring siren. This is a technique known as sympathetic singing.
    You sing making the sounds of what you wish for. It doesn''t always work, but
    today it did, and Cav and Pag were halfway through the second verse of their siren
    song when along came an ambulance. Its blaring siren drowned out their singing.

    The paramedics deployed goo and bandages and pills and bundled Cav and Pag into
    the back of the ambulance. For bureaucratic reasons they were taken to two different
    clinics, Cav to a rustic wellbeing centre and Pag to a clown hospital. Lying in
    their beds, many miles apart, Cav and Pag sang a duet. Each could hear the other''s
    part through hidden earpieces. But other patients on their wards, hearing only
    half a song, grew restive, and chucked things at them, hoping thereby to shut
    them up. The rustic patients showered Cav with rotten fruit and vegetables, and
    the clowns chucked pails of water over Pag.

    Both of them stopped singing, and now all they could hear in their hidden earpieces
    was a low electronic hum. Cav and Pag began to hum in unison, but this served
    to exasperate the sick and recuperating rustics and clowns even further. The rustics
    rang their bells and the clowns parped their hooters to summon brutes, who turfed
    Cav out of the rustic wellbeing centre and Pag out of the clown hospital more
    or less instantaneously.

    The singers sat, with bandaged heads, on pathways many miles apart. They struck
    up another duet, a gorgeous one, and began, tentatively, to make their ways towards
    each other. Both had head injuries, and were somewhat disorientated, and discovered,
    as they staggered along their pathways, that their sense of balance had been affected,
    and they kept toppling over. Eventually the strain of singing and moving at the
    same time became too much. Cav lay down to rest in a ditch, and Pag found a park
    bench upon which to sprawl. They fell silent. Their earpieces hummed.

    Unbeknown either to Cav or Pag, the humming of their earpieces was picked up by
    a Blotzmann mast towering over a top secret national security facility, a cluster
    of deceptively ramshackle huts surrounded by a tall wire fence. It took an operative
    sat at his scanner in one of the huts mere seconds to locate, precisely, Cav''s
    ditch and Pag''s park bench. Mere seconds later, a gate in the fence buzzed open
    and a pair of bulky armoured vehicles trundled out, their drivers taking them
    in opposite directions.

    They picked Cav up first. He was asleep, and they injected him with a serum to
    ensure he did not wake. Pag proved less tractable. He had dozed, but was woken
    by birdsong, and when they came to get him he was clowning around, still bandaged,
    still disorientated. He tried to escape their clutches by doing pratfalls on banana
    skins. They had to Taser him.

    Cav and Pag were held in separate but adjoining rooms in a subterranean part of
    the facility. Their hidden earpieces were removed and taken to a lab for analysis.
    Data was extracted and transferred to old fashioned magnetic tape. The resulting
    recordings were then piped in to their separate holding cells through huge loudspeakers.
    Sat on stools, provided with beakers of vitamin-enhanced tap water, Cav was made
    to listen to Pag and Pag to Cav.

    At first, they heard a gorgeous aria. But at the control desk in the Blotzmannite
    nerve centre, a sinister operative began a series of tape manipulations he had
    learned from various argumentative German composers in the 1950s. Cav and Pag
    heard each other backwards, at double speed, with distorted pitch, and with all
    sorts of other modifications. And always, as a running undertone, that electronic
    hum.

    Their brains were already dislodged from their tumblings down the hill, and the
    tape recordings served only to derange them further. On day six, when they were
    taken out of their holding cells, both Cav and Pag, though outwardly right as
    rain, their bandages removed, were inwardly doolally.

    It was at this point they were taken back to the foot of the hill, and injected
    with a serum that put them back to sleep. When they awoke, in the muck, they would
    remember nothing. Their tumblings, their broken crowns, the paramedics, the clinics,
    the rustics and clowns and rotten fruit and vegetables and pails of water and
    the top secret facility, the manipulated tape recordings, all forgotten.

    Cav woke first, and shook Pag to wake him too. They rubbed their heads, in consternation
    and perplexity rather than from any physical cause.

    "I am not sure where we are," sang Cav, gorgeously, "But I feel curiously impelled,
    impelled, oh! impelled, tra-la, tra-lee, to go to Dallas, Texas."

    "Me too, me too, me too!" sang Pag, equally gorgeously.

    "I shall take a Mannlicher-Carcano sniper''s rifle with me, to the Texas Schoolbook
    Depositor-eee!" sang Cav.

    "And I shall keep watch, holding an umbrella, upon the grassy knoll, fol de rol!"
    sang Pag.

    And so the pair set out on their journey, and they climbed every mountain and
    forded every stream, singing their hearts out, oh so gorgeously.'
