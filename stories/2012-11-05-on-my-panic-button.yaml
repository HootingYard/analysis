  text: 'When she observed that I was boggle-eyed and twitching and panting, I explained
    to my lifestyle coach that I suffered from debilitating panic attacks.

    By the way, if you do not have a lifestyle coach, I strongly recommend that you
    acquire one. Mine is peculiarly expensive, but I think some come at a discount.
    I can say without fear of contradiction that since hiring my lifestyle coach I
    have become a butterfly where once I was a caterpillar. I fly where once I crawled.
    Actually, it is not true that I say that without fear of contradiction. Plenty
    of people will line up to contradict me, to charge that I more closely resemble
    a creature crawling upon its belly upon the earth. Hence my panic attacks.

    "What you need," said my lifestyle coach, "is a panic button."

    Happily, she had a box full of such buttons in her desk drawer, and sold one to
    me there and then. It was peculiarly expensive, for a button, and there was no
    discount available.

    When I got home, I sewed the button on to my jacket, roughly in the vicinity of
    my heart. The idea was that, whenever I felt a panic attack coming upon me, I
    should clutch at the button desperately. To avert the risk of ripping the button
    loose, in my desperation, I sewed it on using a good deal of extremely strong
    thread, as my lifestyle coach advised. I need hardly add that the jacket to which
    I chose to affix my panic button was of Tyrolean sports-casual cut, similar to
    that worn by Christopher Plummer in The Sound Of Music (Robert Wise, 1965). It
    is my jacket du jour, every jour.


    Tyrolean sports-casual jacket, prior to affixation of the panic button

    Now it is a curious fact that many people think they know much about buttons without
    really knowing the first thing about them. To the untrained eye, for example,
    my panic button looked like a stray button inexplicably sewn on to my jacket more
    or less over where my heart was pounding like a steam hammer. The button-ignorant
    might posit the slapdash handiwork of a myopic or distracted sempstress. Thus,
    prancing along the boulevard in the autumnal sunshine for the first time since
    affixing my panic button, I was emotionally prepared for the barrage of catcalls
    and brickbats I was sure to receive. If and when an urchin pointed at my heart
    and shouted "Oi, mister! You''ve got a stray button there on your Tyrolean sports-casual
    jacket! Looks like it was sewn on by a half-blind sempstress!", I would not need
    to clutch at my button in desperation to stave off a panic attack. Already it
    seemed to be working its magic, helping to keep a sense of gibbering terror welling
    up and undoing me.

    As it happened, on that first outing with the panic button, I had no cause to
    clutch at it at all. It was if, with the reassurance of its presence, all the
    usual prods to my panic vanished. Louring clouds, misaligned paving slabs, yapping
    puppies, bookshop window displays piled high with Jeanette Winterson paperbacks
    . . . where usually I would shriek and stagger boggle-eyed and twitching and panting
    through the streets, I was a picture of calmness and insouciance. I may even have
    essayed a whistle, a chirpy tune half-remembered from a childhood jamboree.

    On the corner of Ringo Starr Street and Erebus & Terror Mews, I bumped unexpectedly
    into my lifestyle coach. She was sitting on a bench feeding birds with stale bread
    from a greaseproof paper bag.

    "I have to say," I had to say, "This panic button you sold me is worth every penny!
    I have been out and about now for ten minutes and not once have I felt even the
    merest pang of panic. I have not had to clutch at it in desperation once!"

    She turned her head to look at me and there was an eerie cast to her countenance.

    "Feed the birds, tuppence a bag, tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag," she said.

    I looked at her more closely and realised she was not my lifestyle coach after
    all. Or, if she was, she had aged by several decades since I saw her the day before.
    I felt a sudden tremor of fear.

    "Feed the birds, tuppence a bag, tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag," she said
    again, gazing straight into my eyes with a look I could now see was a hideous
    admixture of amusement and fathomless malevolence.

    Birds were swooping around us in teeming profusion, crows and linnets and sparrows
    and starlings and tippihedrens and peewits. Instinctively, I knew the moment had
    come to clutch at my panic button. But as I raised my hand towards my heart, where
    the button glittered on my Tyrolean sports-casual jacket, one of the birds swooped
    in and pecked it clean away. I had used extremely strong thread, but it was no
    match for the sharp savage beak of the crow. The bird flew up and up, carrying
    my panic button away into the sky, the sky where I ought to have been fluttering
    like a butterfly. Instead, in my panic I tottered and fell to the ground, upon
    misaligned paving slabs, down on my belly like a caterpillar. I clutched at the
    strand of broken thread where my button had been. My lifestyle coach, or the aged
    biddy who had taken her place, stood up from the bench, and trod upon the small
    of my back as she shambled away with her now empty greaseproof paper bag. The
    louring clouds broke, and a deluge poured down upon me. I was unbuttoned and undone.'
