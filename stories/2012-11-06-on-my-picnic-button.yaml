  text: 'My panic button was not the only button I lost to the predations of a bird.
    My picnic button, too, was pecked and snatched and carried away by a crow. For
    all I know, it might have been the same crew that took my panic button. Perhaps
    there is a separate piece to be written about lost buttons, for I have lost many
    buttons, so many, I had not thought crows had undone so many.

    My picnic button was an heirloom, as you will probably have guessed. You do not
    see so many of them these days. They were popular in the interwar years. Their
    exact purpose is no longer clear, but at the time there was scarce a picnic embarked
    upon in these isles where a picnic button was not taken along, in the hamper,
    or in the pocket of one of the picnickers. We will investigate further after I
    have told you the story of how I came to be in possession of one, until it was
    cruelly snatched away from me, by a crow.

    My uncle Quentin was a world-famous and bad-tempered yet loveable scientist from
    Kirrin Island. When he died, we found his entire worldly goods stored in four
    supermarket carrier bags. It was a heteroclite jumble, including the skull of
    a hare, an envelope from L. Garvin, Honey Merchants, containing grey mullet scales,
    a cheese box containing a puffin''s beak, together with a Windsor & Newton leaflet
    containing advice on the control of moth damage to paint brushes, an envelope
    containing snow bunting feathers, a list of mills from Merionethshire, an envelope
    containing bits of silver foil (''from Aunt Ethel''), a book of telephone numbers--containing
    none, an exercise book containing a hair prescription from a Dr Ferguson of Bromsgrove,
    a large photo of sheep in a slate pen, various brown envelopes (empty), an envelope
    containing a single dead prawn, and a picnic button. Curiously, the picnic button
    apart, this collection of bits and bobs was identical to the contents of the four
    supermarket carrier bags containing the worldly goods of the late R.S. Thomas
    and his wife, as noted in Byron Rogers'' biography of the poet. [I am indebted
    to Nige for alerting me to this.]

    After my uncle''s funeral--where, according to his wishes, his corpse was encased
    in a gigantic wicker man and set ablaze--my siblings and cousins and I divvied
    up the contents of the carrier bags. We realised, after aligning the items on
    a baize tabletop and counting them, that their number matched exactly those of
    us there gathered. So we decided upon a raffle. It was by this means that I acquired
    the picnic button and bore it away, in a pocket of my Tyrolean sports-casual jacket,
    which I wore to the funeral in defiance of all etiquette. Everybody else was dressed
    in the correct black, from head to toe. I like to think Uncle Quentin would have
    approved of my jacket-decision, for he was a great fan of The Sound Of Music (Robert
    Wise, 1965), and would softly sing "Edelweiss", word-imperfect, on the rare occasions
    when he was not in a bad temper.

    As soon as I got home, I took down from the bookcase The Encyclopaedia Of Buttons
    and read up on my newly acquired picnic button. This is what I discovered:

    During the interwar years, no picnic in these isles was complete without a picnic
    button. One among any complement of picnickers would be designated the buttoneer,
    and be charged with bringing the picnic button to the picnic. It would either
    be carried in the hamper or in the buttoneer''s pocket. Written picnic reminiscences
    are sparse on detail of the button, and today, in the postwar years, there are
    two rival theories regarding the purpose of the picnic button. These may be scientifically
    summarised as follows:

    The picnic button was always a bright and glittery button, and was placed at edge
    of the picnic blanket. Its brightness and glitter were designed to attract the
    attention of, for example, swooping crows or similar picnic predators. It was
    thought that, dazzled by the button, any swooping crow (or similar) would have
    its attention distracted from picnic essentials such as cream crackers, sausages,
    or cans of Squelcho!, which it might otherwise grasp in its savage talons and
    carry away in flight. Thus a picnic button was very rarely among the items needing
    to be packed up and loaded on to the brake at the end of the picnic. Keen picnickers
    of the era kept a huge supply of picnic buttons for this very reason.

    This theory has been comprehensively demolished by Wigmarole et al in A Discursive
    Analysis Of The Picnic Button 1918-1939, wherein it is argued that the picnic
    button was merely a so-called "spare button" taken to the picnic in case one of
    the participating ladies'' or gentlemen''s buttons became snagged on a thorn or
    similar pointy brambly bit of vegetation, and thus loosed, and thus detached,
    and thus lost, upon the ground, or in a puddle.

    Dinsby, the picnic historian, fired back with a broadside arguing that such a
    button would only have ever been called a spare button, and not a picnic button.
    At time of writing [1962] the controversy has yet to be resolved.

    And fifty years later, that remains the case. All I am able to say on the matter
    is based on my own experience. The week after Uncle Quentin''s funeral, I went
    on a picnic in the field where the charred remains of the wicker man still smouldered.
    I placed my heirloom picnic button on the edge of the picnic blanket. Before I
    even had time to remove from the hamper the cream crackers and sausages and cans
    of Squelcho!, down swooped a crow and snatched the button in its beak, and flew
    away into the wild blue yonder. I have not had the heart to have a picnic since
    that terrible day.'
