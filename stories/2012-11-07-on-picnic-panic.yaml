  text: 'Psychiatrists, phrenologists, and other brain doctors have identified a common
    mind-malaise known as picnic panic. This distressing condition afflicts picnickers
    who fly into a panic when picnicking. It can be terribly, terribly debilitating,
    and ruins many an otherwise splendid bucolic picnicking idyll.

    Consider the following case study. Ned B_____, a hale and hearty moustachioed
    jolly type of fellow, fond of rowing boats and bird slaughter, was exactly the
    type of person you might find attending a picnic in the 1930s. And attend several
    picnics he did. At each one, however, he fell victim to picnic panic, the panic
    increasing in severity to the point where, at his final picnic, he ran screaming
    into a nearby forest and was found, weeks later, a gibbering maniac beyond all
    hope of redemption. He was confined to an Asylum for the Hopelessly Bewildered
    until 1963.

    Upon his release, Ned B_____ was found accommodation in a dilapidated seaside
    resort, far from the field where once he had picnicked. A carer was appointed,
    a retired aviatrix named Mavis Handbasin, a very sensible woman with impeccable
    references. Among other responsibilities, she was charged with ensuring that Ned
    B_____ never consumed a single crumb of food nor slurp of drink when out of doors.
    It was thought, with good reason, that if ever he did so traumatic memories of
    picnics past might well up in his brain, and lead to further calamity. For this
    reason, too, he was kept away from all kinds of rugs and blankets, even when indoors.

    For several years, all was well. Ned B______ passed his days happily enough, in
    standard dilapidated seaside resort fashion. He was even known to chuckle occasionally,
    at some amusement or other. He began a stamp collection, and adopted a pudding-basin
    hairstyle. He often dreamed of slaughtering seagulls, but they were only dreams.
    It was not thought advisable to allow him a firearm.

    In the summer of 1968, however, during the third phase of the Tet Offensive, disaster
    struck. That good woman Mavis Handbasin arrived one morning at Ned B______''s
    squalid seafront boarding house to find him gone. On the wall of his kitchenette,
    scrawled in bright red crayon the colour of blood, were the letters PICN, followed
    by a long mad vertical line trailing off, down towards the wainscot. It had almost
    certainly been intended as a second letter I. Mavis Handbasin intuited the ghost
    of a final letter C, and her head began to spin. Somehow, something had inserted
    the idea of picnics into Ned B______''s poor shattered brain. She must find him
    before he did himself a mischief, or caused mayhem and havoc.

    She found him soon enough. There he was, upon the pebbly beach, just yards from
    his door. He was sat upon a raincoat he had spread out upon the pebbles, in imitation
    of a picnic blanket in a field. He was eating a sausage. As she approached, Mavis
    Handbasin saw that his eyes were glazed and his countenance stuck in a rictus
    of terror. His pudding-basin haircut was in a state of the utmost dishevelment.
    His flesh was the colour of curd. Miss Handbasin was neither a psychiatrist nor
    a phrenologist nor any kind of brain doctor, but she had been awarded a certificate
    of attendance at the module of a training course designed to teach amateurs to
    recognise the telltale signs of picnic panic. Looking at Ned B______, on the beach
    with a sausage on that summer''s day, she thought she had never in her life seen
    a more vivid exemplum of the malady.

    And as she looked, the once hale and hearty moustachioed jolly fellow, now reduced
    to a wreck, swallowed the last bit of sausage. He began to flap his arms, desperately,
    his head uptilted, mad eyes gazing at the sky. His carer knew all too well what
    this meant. Panicked by his impromptu picnic, Ned B______''s wild brain told him
    to flee, and he was trying to flee by flying. He was turning into a seagull.

    She took from its sling her Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, cocked it, aimed, and shot
    him dead.

    Such is the instructive case of Ned B______. It is important to note, however,
    that not all authorities agree that death by sniper''s bullet is the inevitable
    outcome in every case of picnic panic. Mistakes were made in this case, not least
    allowing Ned B______ simultaneous access to a beach, a raincoat, and a sausage.
    One, or even two, of those he could have coped with, if carefully monitored. It
    was the combination of all three that proved  fatal.

    Source : "The Terrifically Exciting Doings Of Mavis Handbasin", Episode 43, in
    Miss Blossom Partridge''s Weekly Digest, Vol. XXXIII, No. 7. No author is given,
    and it is thought the "doings" are a thinly-disguised autobiography penned by
    Mavis Handbasin herself, from her attic room in an Asylum for the Hopelessly Bewildered
    perched on a hillside on the outskirts of Pointy Town. Visitors report that Miss
    Handbasin enjoys weekly picnics, in all weathers, and has never shown the slightest
    sign of picnic panic.'
