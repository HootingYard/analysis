    Mr Kearney, firing from both barrels, demolishes pseudonyms like a cowboy smashing
    bottles in a bar-room, and woven into his staid bibliographical canvas is a host
    of colourful figures, shorn of their aliases: authors, publishers, illustrators,
    booksellers, who have had a hand in this bizarre trade almost since the invention
    of moveable types. Perhaps the strangest of these is Alphonse Momas, a hack-pornographer
    or ''pisse-copie''. . . who wrote no fewer than forty-five books in the [Private
    Case] and whose output was so prolific that he had to use nine pseudonyms: Le
    Nismois, Tap-Tap, Cain d''Abel, L''Erotin, Fuckwell, Un journaliste du siecle
    dernier, Mercadette, Pan-Pan, and Trix. Mr Kearney tells us Momas was a civil
    servant attached to the Paris police and that he devoted himself to spiritualism
    in later life. I recall reading, in some attack on spiritualism, perhaps one of
    Fr Raupert''s spirited diatribes, of a clergyman much given to the practice of
    automatic writing who, to his distress, found his hand suddenly impelled by an
    agency capable only of the grossest indecencies. Each day on awakening from the
    trance into which he had thrown himself, pen in hand, in humble expectation of
    exploring life beyond the veil, he discovered he had been delivered of page after
    page of writings of the lowest and most shocking kind. Perhaps it was the spirit
    of Tap-Tap'', ''coming through''.
