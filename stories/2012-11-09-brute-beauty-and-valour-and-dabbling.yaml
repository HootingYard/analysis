    This week my cupboard in The Dabbler contains an exclusive, and scintillating,
    review of my new paperback Brute Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume,
    Here Buckle! I wrote the review myself, so nobody else would have to. The best
    thing to do is to go and read it, and then make purchase of several copies of
    the book, wait for it to plop through your letterbox, then read the book itself,
    from cover to cover, repeatedly, until the unfathomable wisdom contained therein
    is drummed into your brain.'
