  text: '"I am going to Switzerland," announced Dobson at breakfast one morning in
    the 1950s.

    "Oh?" asked Marigold Chew, chewing on a sausage.

    "For some time now I have been keen to wear a Homburg hat on my head," said the
    greatest out of print pamphleteer of the twentieth century, "And I thought there
    would be no better place to obtain the hat than in Homburg itself, which I have
    learned is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. So that is where I shall
    go, as soon as I have managed to complete the extremely intricate lacing up of
    these Guatemalan traffic policeman''s boots."

    "Before you go," said Marigold Chew, "It might be helpful for you to know that
    the Homburg hat originated not in the Swiss Homburg of which you speak, but in
    Bad Homburg vor der Hohe in the Hochtaunuskreis district of Hesse in Germany.
    King Edward VII came back from a jaunt there sporting the hat, and made it popular."

    But Dobson was so intent on the complicated lacing of his boots that he did not
    listen to his inamorata, and before she could stop him he had donned his long
    Tzipi Gulbenkian overcoat and crashed out of the door into the autumnal 1950s
    downpour.

    When, later, much later, he arrived in the Swiss municipality of Homburg, it did
    not take him long to discover he was in the wrong Homburg. The conversation he
    had with the proprietor of a Swiss hat shop has not been recorded, but we do know
    that Dobson blew a gasket and spent several hours in the custody of Homburg law
    enforcement officers. Released after promising that he would leave the town immediately
    and never, ever return, Dobson headed for Bad Homburg vor der Hohe. Having only
    enough cash to buy a hat, he had to walk. It was raining in both Switzerland and
    Germany at that time, and as he trudged north, for two hundred and forty miles,
    his temper grew ever fouler.

    By the time he arrived at the home of the hat he was exhausted and filthy and
    sopping wet. He slumped on a municipal bench and scribbled some notes in his jotter,
    notes which later formed the basis of his magnificent pamphlet Thoughts Upon A
    Rain-soaked Trudge From Homburg To Homburg (out of print). They were not pretty
    thoughts. A gaggle of Bad Homburg tots were out on an instructional walk with
    their governess, and when they stopped to stare at the bedraggled pamphleteer
    he threw pebbles at them. This led to an altercation with the tots and their governess
    and several German law enforcement officers, from which Dobson only managed to
    extricate himself by promising to write a pamphlet in praise of Bad Homburg tots
    and governesses and law enforcement officers. No trace of such a work has ever
    been found among his papers, but diligent Dobsonists continue to rummage. Perhaps
    one day it will be unearthed.

    Quenching his thirst with water from a puddle--into which he had earlier inadvertently
    sploshed up to his ankles--Dobson set off in search of a hat shop. He soon found
    one, and managed to buy a hat without causing a rumpus. He was, for a few moments,
    happy.

    "I cannot wait to get home!" he said to himself, "Marigold Chew will be resmitten,
    all over again, when she sees me sporting my Homburg hat on my head!"

    The idyll did not last. Barely had the pamphleteer set foot outside the hat shop
    than he was accosted by a German person wearing some kind of uniform, who jabbed
    him on the shoulder and shouted.

    "Your trouser cuffs are dirty and your shoes are laced up wrong. You''d better
    take off your Homburg, ''cos your overcoat is too long."

    "I beg your pardon?" spluttered Dobson. The man repeated himself word for word.

    "Now look here," said the pamphleteer, "First, my trouser cuffs are only dirty
    because I have walked two hundred and forty miles to get here, and stepped in
    many a puddle along the way. Second, these are not shoes but boots, specifically
    Guatemalan traffic policeman''s boots. The lacing of them is an extremely intricate
    business, and I would challenge anybody to lace them up correctly at the first
    attempt. Third, this overcoat is not too long. Yes, it is long, for it is of the
    stylish cut designed by tiptop overcoat designer Tzipi Gulbenkian. Ladies have
    been known to swoon at the sight of its decisive and urgent swish as I sashay
    along the boulevards engarbed in it. And no, I will not remove my brand new Homburg
    hat, nor doff it, to you or to any other man."

    "Then I must place you under immediate arrest," said his accoster.

    "And who might you be, and what agency does that uniform signify?" asked Dobson.

    "I am Obergruppengit Von Hohenzollernschweswigstockhausenstimmung of the Bad Homburg
    vor der Hohe Sartorial Standards Enforcement Police," he said, "And if you do
    not come quietly I will thump you several times with unimaginable brutality until
    you sob for your mama."

    Dobson was not a physical coward, but nor was he a fool.

    "What if I take my hat off and put it in a carrier bag until I leave your delightful
    spa town with its delightful tots and delightful governesses and delightful law
    enforcement officers?" he whimpered.

    "That will be acceptable, said the Obergruppengit.

    So Dobson put his Homburg hat in a carrier bag, and the rain poured down upon
    his bare unhatted bonce. As he did so, the town clock in the Bad Homburg market
    square stood waiting for the hour, when its hands they both turned backwards,
    and on meeting they devoured both themselves and also any fool who dared to tell
    the time. As we have learned, Dobson was not a fool. He trudged, in the rain,
    out of Bad Homburg vor der Hohe, headed for home. And the sun and moon shattered,
    and the signposts ceased to sign.'
