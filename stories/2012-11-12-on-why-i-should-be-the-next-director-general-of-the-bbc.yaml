  text: "Having let the Archbishopric of Canterbury slip through my fingers, I am\
    \ not going to make the same mistake with the other big job now unexpectedly on\
    \ offer. George Entwistle's resignation after just fifty-four days at the helm\
    \ means the post of BBC Director General is vacant. As Leonard Cohen put it, \u201C\
    I'm your man\u201D.\nThe present BBC is a huge and bloated organisation, preposterously\
    \ so when we consider what it does. The clue is in the name: British Broadcasting\
    \ Corporation. It broadcasts programmes on the telly and the radio. That's all.\
    \ So let us gain some perspective. It is not governing a country or fighting a\
    \ war or sending a mission to Mars. (Someone on the Today programme this morning\
    \ did refer to the imminent \u201CStar Trek world of the 2020s\u201D, but that\
    \ is a topic for a separate postage.)\nI have no idea what all those hopeless\
    \ hapless BBC-lifer nonentities in the seemingly numberless tiers of management\
    \ actually do, and nor, I suspect, in their heart of hearts, do they. I would\
    \ immediately dispense with the lot of them. Do you know how ResonanceFM is run?\
    \ There is a benevolent dictator, assisted by one person who knows how all the\
    \ technical gubbins works and one person who makes sure they have enough programmes\
    \ to fill the schedule. And that's it. The BBC could easily be run on the same\
    \ lines, perhaps doubling up on the numbers of assistants to reflect that there\
    \ is a TV arm as well as a radio one.\nNow let us look in more detail at each\
    \ of those.\nTelevision. I don't know if you have read a tabloid newspaper recently.\
    \ I have, and I can tell you that a terrifying percentage of the content is related\
    \ directly to television. If you removed the TV-related stuff from the average\
    \ tabloid you would be left with a few flimsy pages. I think what this shows is\
    \ that television has had a lethal and degrading effect on the culture of the\
    \ masses. Truly we live in an age of pap. So my first instinct would be to shut\
    \ down the television service entirely. That, however, is probably an impossible\
    \ dream, even for as dictatorial a Director General as I intend to be. What would\
    \ be feasible, however, is to scrap all the current programming and show only\
    \ Key-approved content. Call it elitism, if you will, but I know I know best,\
    \ and I am sure after a short while everyone else will agree.\nThus, for example,\
    \ if you had a choice between hour upon hour of Celebrity Antique Cookery Car\
    \ Jungle Challenge or a season of classic Googie Withers films, which would you\
    \ prefer? Not that you will be given the choice under my dominion. It will be\
    \ Googie all the way, every day! And when we have exhausted the Googie canon we\
    \ will show all of Jacques Rivette's films, and then Guy Maddin's, on rotation.\
    \ There are of course other approved film persons other than Googie and Jacques\
    \ and Guy, and they will get their slots.\nBut oi!, I hear you cry, that is cinema,\
    \ not television. Television is a separate and distinct medium in its own right.\
    \ To which I reply, maybe so, but there needs to be a moratorium while we bash\
    \ some sense back into the heads of the masses. After, say, ten years of my limited\
    \ schedule, it might be possible to reintroduce certain made-for-television programmes,\
    \ chiefly Scandinavian police dramas and a show dedicated entirely to Dr Alan\
    \ Statham from Green Wing.\nRadio. I mentioned ResonanceFM above, and it seems\
    \ to me the best thing to do is simply to adjust the current BBC wavelengths so\
    \ they broadcast Resonance instead. This would do wonders for the nation's morale.\
    \ As I would be in charge, there would of course be a channel dedicated wholly\
    \ to Hooting Yard On The Air. There are already hundreds of hours\u2019 worth\
    \ of me babbling into a microphone available as podcasts, so these could be put\
    \ on an ever-repeating loop.\nI would, however, retain two programmes from the\
    \ current BBC schedules, the shipping forecast and Farming Today. For the latter,\
    \ the existing roster of presenters would be ditched (ha ha!) and replaced by\
    \ some proper peasants.\nOther Activities. BBC persons witter on at length about\
    \ a multi-platform approach. Basically, all this means is making the TV and radio\
    \ programmes available on computers and laptops and iFaffs and other digital devices.\
    \ All you need is a computer-literate teenperson to sort that out.\nMy finest\
    \ achievement, however, would be to resurrect The Listener. Younger readers may\
    \ be unaware that from 1929 to 1991 the BBC published the best weekly periodical\
    \ I have ever read. It was an intelligent general interest magazine of the kind\
    \ now absent from our newsagents\u2019 shelves. (Both The Spectator and The New\
    \ Statesman have a political axe to grind; The Listener didn't.) As a teenperson,\
    \ I used to read it every week from cover to cover, and learned more from it than\
    \ from any other single source. I knew the rot had set in when it was closed down\
    \ two decades ago, a decision I can still not forgive.\n\nIt is clear from the\
    \ above that I am the best possible Director General the BBC could possibly have.\
    \ I await \u201CLord\u201D Patten's call (assuming he is still in post at the\
    \ BBC Trust when you read this. If not, I'll take his job too, and I won't need\
    \ ennobling.)"
