  text: 'Had she not died ten years ago, yesterday would have been the 105th birthday
    of Louise Brooks. To celebrate, the splendid Bestiary posted a photograph of her
    with an owl on her head.


    At least I think it''s an owl. Outa_Spaceman, to whom I am once again indebted
    for alerting me to the snap, thinks it is either an owl or a hawk of some kind.'
