  text: '"The best-laid schemes o'' mice an'' men / Gang aft agley" wrote Robert Burns.
    How right he was, in a very real sense, as they say on Thought For The Day. Certainly
    here at Hooting Yard a scheme is about to gang very agley indeed.

    As you know, this year I set myself the task of bashing out roughly a thousand
    words a day. Here we are in mid-November and I have astonished myself by very
    nearly succeeding. Quite honestly, I thought the scheme would collapse in ignominy
    some time in January. And while it is true that I have occasionally, on days o''
    emptiness-between-the-ears, posted pieces resurrected from the past, I have done
    so rarely. For the most part, 2012 has seen a teeming cascade of words, every
    single syllable worthy of your rapt attention.

    So many words, indeed, that I was able to compile a fat 444-page paperback of
    pieces selected from the first half of the year. If you have not yet bought a
    copy of Brute Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here Buckle! then
    you bloody well ought to. You will want to have read it from cover to cover, and
    reread it, and made scholarly annotations in the margins, and rereread it, before
    a further volume, selected from the second half of the year, appears in, I hope,
    the spring of 2013.

    What then, you may ask, has gang agley? Well, imminently, Mr Key will be leaving
    his Barrel of Reclusion for a short while to travel in foreign climes. I shall
    be gone for more than a week but less than a fortnight. During this time it will
    be simply impractical to splurge forth daily prose for your edification and moral
    instruction. Thus there will be a hiatus.

    I considered two possible fixes. One was to write sufficient pieces in advance
    and schedule them for posting while I am away. I am afraid the extra effort was
    beyond my wit. The second was to schedule selected repostages from the archive
    to cover the period. But this seemed to me something of a cop-out. Better, I decided,
    to allow the scheme, in all its glory, to contain a fatal flaw.

    So I will be back soon, and in the meantime there may appear bittybobs of bloggy
    blather, albeit of far fewer than a thousand words, so keep your eyes peeled.'
