  text: "\u201CThe best-laid schemes o\u2019 mice an\u2019 men / Gang aft agley\u201D\
    \ wrote Robert Burns. How right he was, in a very real sense, as they say on Thought\
    \ For The Day. Certainly here at Hooting Yard a scheme is about to gang very agley\
    \ indeed.\nAs you know, this year I set myself the task of bashing out roughly\
    \ a thousand words a day. Here we are in mid-November and I have astonished myself\
    \ by very nearly succeeding. Quite honestly, I thought the scheme would collapse\
    \ in ignominy some time in January. And while it is true that I have occasionally,\
    \ on days o\u2019 emptiness-between-the-ears, posted pieces resurrected from the\
    \ past, I have done so rarely. For the most part, 2012 has seen a teeming cascade\
    \ of words, every single syllable worthy of your rapt attention.\nSo many words,\
    \ indeed, that I was able to compile a fat 444-page paperback of pieces selected\
    \ from the first half of the year. If you have not yet bought a copy of Brute\
    \ Beauty And Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here Buckle! then you bloody\
    \ well ought to. You will want to have read it from cover to cover, and reread\
    \ it, and made scholarly annotations in the margins, and rereread it, before a\
    \ further volume, selected from the second half of the year, appears in, I hope,\
    \ the spring of 2013.\nWhat then, you may ask, has gang agley? Well, imminently,\
    \ Mr Key will be leaving his Barrel of Reclusion for a short while to travel in\
    \ foreign climes. I shall be gone for more than a week but less than a fortnight.\
    \ During this time it will be simply impractical to splurge forth daily prose\
    \ for your edification and moral instruction. Thus there will be a hiatus.\nI\
    \ considered two possible fixes. One was to write sufficient pieces in advance\
    \ and schedule them for posting while I am away. I am afraid the extra effort\
    \ was beyond my wit. The second was to schedule selected repostages from the archive\
    \ to cover the period. But this seemed to me something of a cop-out. Better, I\
    \ decided, to allow the scheme, in all its glory, to contain a fatal flaw.\nSo\
    \ I will be back soon, and in the meantime there may appear bittybobs of bloggy\
    \ blather, albeit of far fewer than a thousand words, so keep your eyes peeled."
