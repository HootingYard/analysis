    Mark Steyn summarises fifty years'' of Bond film denouements:

    For half a century, the most boring bit in 007 has always been the final 20 minutes
    when Bond and the girl run around the hollowed-out volcano shooting hundreds of
    tinfoil-suited extras in golf carts while looking for the big red "Off" button
    that disconnects the space laser.'
