  text: 'An eerie silence may have descended upon Hooting Yard itself over the past
    few weeks, but elsewhere our global outreach service has not been wholly idle.

    community hub nomenclature, with particular reference to the example set in South
    Africa, where some lucky tots attend A School Called Monkey.

    Salim Fadhley for arranging these matters.'
