  text: "An eerie silence may have descended upon Hooting Yard itself over the past\
    \ few weeks, but elsewhere our global outreach service has not been wholly idle.\n\
    Over at The Dabbler last Friday I considered self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity\
    \ awareness community hub nomenclature, with particular reference to the example\
    \ set in South Africa, where some lucky tots attend A School Called Monkey.\n\
    Meanwhile, at the Drabblecast, golden-voiced Norm Sherman gives a reading of my\
    \ thrilling space adventure The Nougat Nozzles Of Neptune. Many thanks are due\
    \ to Salim Fadhley for arranging these matters."
