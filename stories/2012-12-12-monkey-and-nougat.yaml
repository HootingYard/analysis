  text: 'An eerie silence may have descended upon Hooting Yard itself over the past
    few weeks, but elsewhere our global outreach service has not been wholly idle.

    Over at The Dabbler last Friday I considered self-esteem ''n'' diversity awareness
    community hub nomenclature, with particular reference to the example set in South
    Africa, where some lucky tots attend A School Called Monkey.

    Meanwhile, at the Drabblecast, golden-voiced Norm Sherman gives a reading of my
    thrilling space adventure The Nougat Nozzles Of Neptune. Many thanks are due to
    Salim Fadhley for arranging these matters.'
