  text: "In my debilitated state, felled by germs and much given to whimpering, writing\
    \ one thousandish words upon any subject at all is quite beyond me. On the other\
    \ hand, if readers are to read then writers must write. It occurred to me that\
    \ I might just manage to bash out a few haiku, distillations in a few words of\
    \ what we could call the Hooting Yardanschauung.\nA bog\n  Beyond the viaduct\n\
    \  In the downpour\nDobson\n  At his escritoire\n  Scribbling twaddle\nA hobgoblin\n\
    \  On Sawdust Bridge\n  Eating a sausage\nTiny Enid\n  Flooring a ne'er-do-well\n\
    \  And kicking his head in\nThere are four for you to pore over. There may be\
    \ more to come. Now for the Lemsip!"
