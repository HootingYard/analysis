  text: "\nWhen I was a tot, one of my treasured books was a Rupert Bear Annual, the\
    \ only one I ever owned. I pored over the stories in this volume again and again,\
    \ looking at the pictures, reading the tales in the rhyming couplet captions,\
    \ and then rereading them in the prose versions printed below. Nutwood seemed\
    \ a mysterious and magical world, where a bear lived with his ursine ma and pa,\
    \ counted an elephant and a badger and a pig among his pals, where the local bobby\
    \ was a dog called Police Constable Growler, and where the cast of human characters\
    \ included an eccentric professor with a dwarvish valet and a mystic Oriental\
    \ Yoko Ono type named Tigerlily, not forgetting Beryl the girl guide and an assortment\
    \ of fisherfolk, tinkers, peasants and explorers.\nI have very few mementoes of\
    \ my childhood, and the Rupert Annual was among those I thought lost. I could\
    \ not, at any rate, recall the last time I had seen it. Occasionally I would rummage\
    \ in secondhand bookshops seeking a copy, though on the rare occasions I found\
    \ one it proved to be ruinously expensive.\nThen, last month, visiting my sister\
    \ in Maryland, I discovered what had become of my annual. In the late 1970s, my\
    \ mother had given it to my niece, and ever since it had been sitting unremarked\
    \ on a bookshelf in my sister's house. I learned this, however, on the way to\
    \ the airport at the end of my stay, when for some reason Rupert Bear cropped\
    \ up in conversation.\nHow thrilled I was this morning to unwrap my sister's Christmas\
    \ gift--the treasured book from my childhood. And how astonished I was, leafing\
    \ through it, to realise how much of Hooting Yard is there in embryo. Weird countryside,\
    \ picnics, entanglement in bracken and thorns, eerie mists, aquatic sea beings.\
    \ . . all this stuff must have entered my head long, long ago, and nestled there.\
    \ I shall examine the book more thoroughly and, perhaps, in due course share with\
    \ you lot the more Hooting Yardy elements I find therein.\nAnd to my sister, much\
    \ thanks! She appended this verse (appropriately in rhyming couplets) to the wrapping:\n\
    A Valediction for Rupert\nOh Rupert! Since we needs must part\n  I wrap you in\
    \ compelling art\nOf books beloved from long ago,\n  Their whereabouts I do not\
    \ know.\nLike you they may have flown away\n  Without permission, I dare say,\n\
    And sit now on some distant shelf\n  Unloved, neglected, by themself.\nDear Rupert\
    \ you were never lost\n  But treasured, read, and tossed\nAbout by little ones\
    \ who loved you too\n  Just as much as Frank must do.\nSafe journey home where\
    \ you belong\n  And think of me, I shall be strong\nAnd shed no tears as you depart\n\
    \    For books still live within the heart.\nNOTE : My sister, by the by, is Rita\
    \ Byrne Tull, whose Dispatches From The Former New World appear in The Dabbler."
