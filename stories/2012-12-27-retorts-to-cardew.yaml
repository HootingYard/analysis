  text: "When Cornelius Cardew went crackers and became, first a Maoist and then a\
    \ devotee of Enver Hoxha of Albania, he repudiated much of his own earlier work\
    \ and the avant garde in general. He turned his fire particularly on Stockhausen,\
    \ with whom he had worked closely as both student and assistant. In The Listener\
    \ (15 June 1972), Cardew published a screed with the self-explanatory title \u201C\
    Stockhausen Serves Imperialism\u201D. Here are two letters which appeared in the\
    \ magazine the following week:\n\nNo doubt Messrs Britton and Pullman went straight\
    \ on to a list of Enemies of the People who would be the first to be executed\
    \ when the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)\u2014\
    described by Richard Gott as among \u201Cthe more perverse and irrelevant political\
    \ groupings\u201D of the time\u2014ushered in the glorious proletarian revolution."
