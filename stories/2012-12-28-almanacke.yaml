    Over at The Dabbler today you will find Old Key''s Almanacke, a list of a dozen
    prognostications of what will befall us in the coming twelvemonth. The spooky
    thing about Old Key is that he has been proved unerringly accurate, time and time
    again. I am not entirely sure who he is, or was, other than that his papers were
    discovered in a shoebox underneath a sink in a cubby in an old manse perched on
    a windswept hillside. The papers, bound into a series of Almanackes, had been
    piddled upon by generations of feral cats. On the rotting linoleum next to the
    shoebox lay a wand and a pointy hat. They too had been piddled upon, by something
    bigger and more terrible than a feral cat.'
