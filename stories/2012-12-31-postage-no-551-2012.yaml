  text: "So that is another year at Hooting Yard done and dusted. Many thanks to my\
    \ readers and listeners, particularly to those who help me keep the wolf from\
    \ the door by sending donations, subscribing, and/or buying my paperbacks from\
    \ Lulu.\nI was going to list here a few personal favourites from the Year of Our\
    \ Lord MMXII, but then it occurred to me that, really, the best thing you can\
    \ do is to reread the entire year's worth of postages, all 550 of them (not including\
    \ this one), at one prolonged sitting, your brow furrowed in concentration, while\
    \ outside the wind howls and the rain pours down. After all, \u201Cthe proper\
    \ study of Mankind is Hooting Yard\u201D, as Alexander Pope said (attrib.). The\
    \ attrib., by the by, was made by me, just a moment ago.\nI began the year with\
    \ the demented plan to write a thousandish-word essay every day, and persisted\
    \ until mid-November, when the scheme ganged agley due to my (alas, temporary)\
    \ membership of the international jetset. For the Year of Our Lord MMXIII, I have\
    \ devised a different project, still somewhat blurry in my bonce, the first fruits\
    \ of which will, I hope, appear here tomorrow.\nMeanwhile, at the turning of the\
    \ year it is time to take stock, so here is a snap of the actor Nigel Stock (1919\u2013\
    1986), who played Dr Watson in the BBC's 1960s Sherlock Holmes adaptations, as\
    \ well as popping up in Brighton Rock (John Boulting, 1947) and The Great Escape\
    \ (John Sturges, 1963), among many other films.\n"
