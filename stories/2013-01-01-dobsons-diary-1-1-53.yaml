  text: 'Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, was an intermittent diarist. At certain
    periods in his life, he maintained a voluminous, almost demented daily journal.
    At other times he made only scattered and vestigial scribblings, and there are
    also whole stretches where he fell completely silent, at least as a diarist. Surprisingly,
    there has been as yet no attempt to marshal all the extant texts into a published
    edition. Here, however, is Dobson''s diary entry written sixty years ago to the
    day, on the first of January 1953:

    Cabbage stalks in swans'' blood for breakfast. Then I went for a trudge along
    the towpath of the filthy old canal. Stopped to gaze at cows--the cows gazed back.
    Spent untold hours slumped at my escritoire struggling with my pamphlet in progress,
    Farming With Gnomes. The problem is I know little about farming and even less
    about gnomes. Why, then, asked my inamorata Marigold Chew, did I choose the topic
    in the first place? She fails to grasp the intricate workings of what I have decided
    to dub "Dobson Praxis", a praxis that itself may be the subject of a future pamphlet.

    When the time came to sharpen my pencil I could not find the pencil sharpener,
    so instead I picked up this week''s copy of The Listener and read a fascinating
    article about a buff-breasted sandpiper. From a careful reading--and rereading--I
    deduced that this is some sort of bird, though what it is doing hanging around
    at a sewage works is beyond me. If I had wings and the power of flight I am by
    no means certain that I would choose to wallow in sewage when I could take wing
    and fly to, oh I don''t know, somewhere less noisome and noxious.

    Actually, I note that the writer calls it a sewage farm rather than a sewage works.
    Perhaps this is a suitable type of farm for gnomes. I shall have to embark upon
    further research.

    Pig innards and peas for supper.
