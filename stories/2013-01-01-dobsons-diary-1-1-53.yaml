  text: "Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, was an intermittent diarist. At certain\
    \ periods in his life, he maintained a voluminous, almost demented daily journal.\
    \ At other times he made only scattered and vestigial scribblings, and there are\
    \ also whole stretches where he fell completely silent, at least as a diarist.\
    \ Surprisingly, there has been as yet no attempt to marshal all the extant texts\
    \ into a published edition. Here, however, is Dobson's diary entry written sixty\
    \ years ago to the day, on the first of January 1953:\nCabbage stalks in swans\u2019\
    \ blood for breakfast. Then I went for a trudge along the towpath of the filthy\
    \ old canal. Stopped to gaze at cows\u2014the cows gazed back. Spent untold hours\
    \ slumped at my escritoire struggling with my pamphlet in progress, Farming With\
    \ Gnomes. The problem is I know little about farming and even less about gnomes.\
    \ Why, then, asked my inamorata Marigold Chew, did I choose the topic in the first\
    \ place? She fails to grasp the intricate workings of what I have decided to dub\
    \ \u201CDobson Praxis\u201D, a praxis that itself may be the subject of a future\
    \ pamphlet.\nWhen the time came to sharpen my pencil I could not find the pencil\
    \ sharpener, so instead I picked up this week's copy of The Listener and read\
    \ a fascinating article about a buff-breasted sandpiper. From a careful reading\u2014\
    and rereading\u2014I deduced that this is some sort of bird, though what it is\
    \ doing hanging around at a sewage works is beyond me. If I had wings and the\
    \ power of flight I am by no means certain that I would choose to wallow in sewage\
    \ when I could take wing and fly to, oh I don't know, somewhere less noisome and\
    \ noxious.\nActually, I note that the writer calls it a sewage farm rather than\
    \ a sewage works. Perhaps this is a suitable type of farm for gnomes. I shall\
    \ have to embark upon further research.\nPig innards and peas for supper.\n"
