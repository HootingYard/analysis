  text: 'Dobson''s diaries contain a huge number of undated entries. Over the past
    several years, a team of indefatigable researchers has been busy attempting to
    pinpoint specific dates where possible, in a project funded by an unfathomably
    secret organisation possibly led by international woman of mystery Primrose Dent.
    The team''s most recent success was to deduce, from internal textual evidence,
    that the following was written on the fifth of January 1958:

    After a breakfast of kippers, hare-brains and jellied celery, I was all set to
    spend the day slumped at my escritoire, scribbling, but my inamorata Marigold
    Chew had other ideas.

    "We must go on an outing!" she cried, frighteningly.

    When I asked why, she replied that we ought to celebrate, by outing and picnic,
    the birthdays of Scarlatti, Zebulon Pike, Frederick Converse, Herbert Bayard Swope,
    Yves Tanguy, Stella Gibbons, Wieland Wagner, Friedrich Durrenmatt, W. D. Snodgrass,
    Walter Mondale, Umberto Eco, Raisa Gorbachova, Jan Leeming, Diane Keaton, Linda
    Clare, and Joan Balawejder, while also commemorating the anniversary of the deaths
    of Edward the Confessor, Catherine de Medici, Karl Alfred von Zittel, Sir Ernest
    Shackleton, Amy Johnson, Charles Slee, and Mistinguett. When I said that I had
    no idea who some of these people were, she announced that today was also the anniversary
    of the Great Fire of Eindhoven, the discovery of X-rays, and the foundation of
    the Nazi Party.

    "So let us pack our picnic hamper and set off on a hike!" she added.

    Which is what we did. After the picnic (cows, rain) we stopped in at the Museum
    of Ack-on-or-near-the-Vug. It was about to close, due to the pomposity of the
    curator, but we had a few minutes in which to look around. My eye was caught by
    an exhibit of indescribable gorgeousness. Well, I say indescribable, but the pompous
    curator made a pretty good fist of describing it on the card placed next to it,
    which I copied out in my jotting pad with my propelling pencil:

    It is 45 cm. in height, has a jewel-encrusted crimplene base, ivory fluting, ruched
    silk underbelts, hectic trimmings, a delightful milky-green ribbed spandole, villainous
    scraping marks, a gutta percha rim, opalescent bison-head motifs, swivelling glutinous
    beads inlaid with serried gems, fleur-de-lys hatching, precise web-and-tuck dufraiment,
    talc stipples, a riband nightside opening on the velveteen casing, some rather
    brusque kaolin relief work, tiny cack-iron clips, berry lagging, a splendid gilt
    Spode handle, and corky frets on the oversling.

    It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Marigold Chew executed a quick
    sketch in her jotting pad with her propelling pencil, but as we left the museum
    a jackdaw swooped out of the sky and snatched that page of the jotter in its beak
    and flew away, away, up into the overcast sky.'
