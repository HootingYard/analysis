  text: "How impossible it is for me to make regular entries in the diary. I suddenly\
    \ remember how I used to puzzle over the word at school. Always wondering why\
    \ diary was so like Dairy and what the connection was. Never found out. Like that\
    \ label on the bottle of Daddies sauce\u2014it never stopped. The man on the label\
    \ was holding a bottle of Daddies sauce and on the label was a man holding a bottle\
    \ of Daddies sauce . . . ad infinitum ad nauseam for me at any rate.\n\nThus Kenneth\
    \ Williams in his diary for this day in 1953. Astute readers will recall that\
    \ Franz Kafka was also subject to diary-dairy befuddlement\u2014or at least the\
    \ manufacturers of postcards in his memory were so befuddled. It is unclear why\
    \ this is connected to the infinite regression of the Daddies Sauce bottle label\
    \ chap, unless Williams is trying to tell us that he has spent his entire life\
    \ to date continuing to fret about the connection between diaries and dairies.\
    \ But then he was a very fretful man, as was Kafka.\n"
