  text: 'The lumbering walrus-moustached psychopathic serial killer Babinsky was a
    conscientious diarist. Here is what he had to say for himself on this day in 1966:

    Woke up feeling murderous. Preened my moustache and sharpened my axe and cleaver
    and slicer. Tossed them into a gunny sack, slung it over my shoulder, and went
    out on a rampage. The sky was blue, birds were singing, and the municipal flowerbeds
    hereabouts were splurged with glory--plastic glory, in the depths of winter, but
    glory nonetheless.

    I am no Panglossian, far from it, but even I was persuaded that this might indeed
    be the best of all possible worlds. In fact, I felt so chipper that when a beggar
    person approached me, his grubby withered paw outstretched for alms, I pressed
    a penny upon him and wished him all the best. His awful gob broke into a toothless
    grin that warmed my cockles. Further down the street, several puppies were frolicking.
    I struck the fear of the dog-God into them and they scampered away.

    Above, in the blue sky, a trio of cranes flew by, and I thought of Sibelius. He
    was a baldy man with a drink problem, but he knew how to write a symphony. I thought
    about popping into a Finnish church to say a prayer for his immortal soul, and
    I stopped a passer-by to ask if there were any Finnish churches in this neighbourhood,
    ones I might have overlooked. I have only been here for a couple of days, after
    fleeing the coppers following that gore-splattered business over by Pointy Town
    Town Hall.

    The coppers here have not noticed my presence yet, except for one particularly
    inquisitive and irritating constable who demanded to see my library ticket. I
    smote him, as if we were living in Old Testament times, and then I smote him again,
    and again, and when he was thrice smitten I slew him with a flaming sword. Setting
    fire to a sword is easier said than done, but I recently came across some kind
    of flammable jelly. Smear that liberally on your sword, and strike a match, and
    hey presto!

    The passer-by was ignorant of any Finnish churches, but he told me where I might
    find a guidebook to the local amenities. He was so helpful that I spared his life,
    just having a few little chops at him with my cleaver, nothing that emergency
    paramedics in a well-equipped air ambulance won''t be able to patch up.

    The guidebook I found as promised in the newsagent''s kiosk did not list a single
    Finnish church. What kind of bailiwick was this? Humming a few snatches from Sibelius''
    majestic sixth symphony I smashed the kiosk to firewood with my axe, and then
    set off in pursuit of the newsagent, who had run off screaming into the hills.
    I soon caught and slaughtered him, and it was such a lovely spot, up there in
    the hills, despite the cold, that I snacked on his brains and liver and lights
    before going back into town for a bit more rampaging.

    But in the meantime, the coppers had arrived, headed by that relentless Detective
    Captain Cargpan, my Nemesis, so I had to go into hiding. I am currently cooped
    up in a hut at the waterworks. Tomorrow I will have to create a diversion and
    make my escape. It''s a pity I have run out of flammable jelly.'
