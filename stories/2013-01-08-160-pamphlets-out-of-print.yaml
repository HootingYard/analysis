  text: 'And lo! a new year dawns, and bang on schedule reader Mike Jennings provides
    us with an update on the Dobson canon, listing all those pamphlets which have
    come to light and been mentioned in dispatches over the past year. As ever, Mr
    Jennings has applied the obscure yet somehow charming Blotzmann Numbering System
    for ease of reference. Unless otherwise stated, all pamphlets are out of print.

    Mr Jennings'' previous listings can be found at these links: numbers 1 to 104,
    105 to 128, 129 to 139, and, all by itself, number 140.'
