  text: 'Three eggs.


    Regular readers will be aware that whenever I quote from George Orwell''s diaries
    I give the full and unabridged entry for the day in question. Tomorrow we will
    have to move on to a different diarist, so it is only fair that I take the opportunity
    to draw your attention to further, ornithologically significant, excitements in
    Orwell''s life which took place on the ninth of January 1939. Not merely

    Two eggs

    but

    Saw large flock of green plover, apparently the same as in England.

    Did he think foreign plovers would somehow differ from clean, decent, English
    plovers?'
