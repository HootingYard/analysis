  text: "The diary of G\xF6sta\_Ekman Senior, on this day in 1938:\n\nWoke up and\
    \ snorted cocaine. Plunged my fabulous head, with its boyish good looks, into\
    \ a pail of ice cold water, then snorted some more cocaine. Sat for a while pondering\
    \ whether to spend the day as a farmer's son, an eighteenth century aristocrat,\
    \ an octogenarian lunatic, or a clown, in all of which roles I am of course equally\
    \ convincing. Busy schedule of acting, directing, rehearsing, filming, recording,\
    \ and administration, all fuelled by more and more cocaine. Felt a bit queasy\
    \ and conked out."
