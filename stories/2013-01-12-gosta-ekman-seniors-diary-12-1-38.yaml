  text: 'The diary of Gosta Ekman Senior, on this day in 1938:


    Woke up and snorted cocaine. Plunged my fabulous head, with its boyish good looks,
    into a pail of ice cold water, then snorted some more cocaine. Sat for a while
    pondering whether to spend the day as a farmer''s son, an eighteenth century aristocrat,
    an octogenarian lunatic, or a clown, in all of which roles I am of course equally
    convincing. Busy schedule of acting, directing, rehearsing, filming, recording,
    and administration, all fuelled by more and more cocaine. Felt a bit queasy and
    conked out.'
