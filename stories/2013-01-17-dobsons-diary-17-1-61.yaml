  text: 'On this day in 1961 we find the out of print pamphleteer Dobson on his travels:

    Woke up without the faintest clue where I was. It rapidly became apparent that
    I was zipped up tight in a sleeping bag. When I struggled out of it, I saw I was
    in a tent. I have absolutely no memory of going camping. In any case, I hate camping.
    In my experience, one finds that wherever one pitches one''s tent soon becomes
    a haven for moles. You fall asleep on a flat patch of ground and when you wake
    up the entire area is riddled with molehills. Usually.

    That was not the case today, as I discovered when, emerging through the canvas
    flaps, I found that the tent had been erected within a hotel room. This was a
    curious occurrence to be sure, and I ransacked my memory to work out why it might
    be so. Was I so bent on travel that I had to double the experience, as it were,
    first booking into a hotel and then pitching a tent within it? It is something
    I have done only once before, when I was young and foolish. Now I am old and wise,
    at least by my own reckoning.

    I abluted in the en suite bathroom and pranced out into the corridor in search
    of breakfast. I noticed something decidedly odd about the sausages and the cornflakes,
    and beckoned a hotel person. Finding myself inexplicably bereft of speech, I pointed
    at the sausages and the cornflakes and raised a quizzical eyebrow.

    The explanation I was given for the oddness of my sausages and cornflakes sent
    my brain reeling. Not only was my tent in a hotel room, but the hotel was on a
    space rocket! I was hurtling at unimaginable speed towards a distant planet. And
    I could not speak because of what the hotel person, who I noticed had special
    breathing apparatus attached to a tinfoil helmet, called "space muffling".

    I had been planning to take a walk in the grounds of the hotel after breakfast
    but clearly this was not feasible, so I returned to my room and, once inside,
    crept back through the flaps into my tent. I set up a portable escritoire, took
    out my jotting pad and propelling pencil, and set about writing a pamphlet. Space
    Age Dobson, I decided to entitle it, immodestly.

    Shortly after I had scribbled my opening sentence, and was chewing the end of
    my propelling pencil trying to think up a second sentence, the captain made an
    announcement over the space tannoy. Due to the wrong sort of particles in the
    galaxy, we would have to turn back and return to Earth. I scribbled out my title
    and my opening sentence and continued to chew the end of the propelling pencil,
    which tasted remarkably similar to both the sausages and the cornflakes.

    We bumped back to earth about half an hour later. I disembarked and made my way
    home by bus. I told my inamorata Marigold Chew all about my excursion.

    "You were never much of a traveller, Dobson," she said, "You always get upset
    about moles."

    That gave me an idea for a pamphlet, and I repaired immediately to my escritoire,
    where I wrote in one sitting my pamphlet Are There Any Moles In Outer Space? No,
    There Are Not!*
