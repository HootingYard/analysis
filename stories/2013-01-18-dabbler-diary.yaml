  text: "\nOver at The Dabbler today, a bonus extra diary entry, for this day nineteen\
    \ years ago, written by a nonagenarian Russian exile in Spain. Anthony Burgess\
    \ is mentioned in the text, which gives me an excuse to remind you lot of his\
    \ biographer Roger Lewis\u2019 matchless description of the Mancunian polymath's\
    \ hair:\nAnd how are we going to describe his hair? The yellowish-white powdery\
    \ strands were coiled on his scalp like Bram Stoker's Dracula's peruke, not maintained\
    \ since Prince Vlad the Impaler fought off the Turks in the Carpathian mountains\
    \ in 1462. What does it say about a man that he could go around like that, as\
    \ Burgess did? Though he was a king of the comb-over (did the clumps and fronds\
    \ emanate from his ear-hole?), no professional barber can be blamed for this.\
    \ I thought to myself, he has no idea how strange he is. What did he think he\
    \ looked like? He evidently operated on his own head with a pair of garden shears.\n"
