  text: "\nOn this day in 1824, Eug\xE8ne\_Delacroix wrote in his diary:\nI have been\
    \ reading about an English judge who desired to live to a great age and accordingly\
    \ proceeded to question every old man he met about his diet and the kind of life\
    \ he led\u2014whether his longevity had any connection with food, alcoholic liquour,\
    \ and so forth. It appears that the only thing they had in common was early rising\
    \ and, above all, not dozing off once they were awake. Most important.\nBefore\
    \ you adopt this practice, it is well to bear in mind that I read somewhere\u2014\
    I wish I could recall where\u2014of another fellow who I think also lived to a\
    \ great age, and who made it his habit frequently to lean against a wall and take\
    \ a nap, sleeping standing up, like a horse."
