text: "\nOn this day in 1824, Eug\xE8ne\_Delacroix wrote in his diary:\nI have been\
  \ reading about an English judge who desired to live to a great age and accordingly\
  \ proceeded to question every old man he met about his diet and the kind of life\
  \ he led\u2014whether his longevity had any connection with food, alcoholic liquour,\
  \ and so forth. It appears that the only thing they had in common was early rising\
  \ and, above all, not dozing off once they were awake. Most important.\nBefore you\
  \ adopt this practice, it is well to bear in mind that I read somewhere\u2014I wish\
  \ I could recall where\u2014of another fellow who I think also lived to a great\
  \ age, and who made it his habit frequently to lean against a wall and take a nap,\
  \ sleeping standing up, like a horse."
