    On this day in 1824, Eugene Delacroix wrote in his diary:

    I have been reading about an English judge who desired to live to a great age
    and accordingly proceeded to question every old man he met about his diet and
    the kind of life he led--whether his longevity had any connection with food, alcoholic
    liquour, and so forth. It appears that the only thing they had in common was early
    rising and, above all, not dozing off once they were awake. Most important.

    Before you adopt this practice, it is well to bear in mind that I read somewhere--I
    wish I could recall where--of another fellow who I think also lived to a great
    age, and who made it his habit frequently to lean against a wall and take a nap,
    sleeping standing up, like a horse.'
