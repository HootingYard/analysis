  text: "The bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead's diary for this day in 1992:\nTo\
    \ the launch party for my new paperback potboiler Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel!\
    \ Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! I took the title from Ronald Firbank's 1916 novel\
    \ Inclinations, and I am pleased to think that this may be the first time in the\
    \ history of fiction that an entire chapter of an existing work has been quoted\
    \ as the title of a new one. (It was Chapter XX, for anybody who wants to check.)\
    \ My Mabel bears scant resemblance to Firbank's. She was young and not a little\
    \ ditzy, while mine is a crone. In fact, for a while I thought of giving the book\
    \ the title Crone With A Sponge! until, about half way through, I encountered\
    \ intractable technical potboiler difficulties and had to ditch the sponge entirely,\
    \ eradicating all mention of it from the opening chapters. It is, I think, a better\
    \ book as a result, certainly a better potboiler.\nI attended the launch party\
    \ incognito, got up as a baffled bus conductor down on his luck. My disguise was\
    \ almost wholly successful, and not even my own mother recognised me. What on\
    \ earth she was doing at the party is a surpassing mystery. I must have words\
    \ with the warden of the Bewilderment Home. Though nobody actually knew me for\
    \ who I am, one fathead mistook me for the lumbering psychopathic walrus-moustached\
    \ serial killer Babinsky, and called the coppers. They arrived just as I was cramming\
    \ cream crackers from the buffet into the pocket of my bus conductor's jacket.\
    \ Never overlook free cream crackers, by the way\u2014follow that advice and you\
    \ can sail through life more or less unhindered.\nNot so this evening, alas, as\
    \ the coppers, led by doughty Detective Captain Cargpan, whacked me on the head\
    \ several times with a lead-weighted sap, removed the cream crackers from my pocket\
    \ and put them back on the buffet table, and bundled me into the back of their\
    \ van. I assumed I would be taken down to the station, but instead we drove out\
    \ into the blasted and inhospitable winter countryside. At a godforsaken spinney,\
    \ the van screeched to a halt and the coppers dragged me out and tied me to the\
    \ trunk of a yew tree. The yew tree pointed up, it had a Gothic shape. My eyes\
    \ lifted after it and found the moon. I noticed that fumy, spiritous mists inhabited\
    \ this place, and there was a row of headstones.\n\u201CI have decided that the\
    \ only way to stop you, Babinsky, is to engage in a spot of extra-judicial killing,\u201D\
    \ said Cargpan. Then, \u201CNed, get the axe and the shovel,\u201D he added, to\
    \ one of his henchmen.\n\u201CBut I am not Babinsky!\u201D I cried, \u201CI am\
    \ the bestselling paperbackist Pebblehead!\u201D\n\u201CProve it,\u201D said Cargpan,\
    \ darkly.\n\u201CMy hands are tied to the trunk of this pointy yew tree so I cannot\
    \ rummage in my pockets, but if you do so, in among the crumbs of cream crackers\
    \ you will find my jotter, in which are jotted down notes for my next half dozen\
    \ bestselling paperback potboilers,\u201D I said.\nCargpan rummaged, and a look\
    \ of wonderment lit up his countenance.\n\u201CBloody hell, boys, this isn't Babinsky,\
    \ it's Pebblehead!\u201D he cried, and he immediately freed me from my bonds and\
    \ sat me down on a camping stool and gave me a cup of tea from a flask.\n\u201C\
    We are all big fans of yours,\u201D he said, as his little band of coppers all\
    \ nodded, \u201CWe've got every single one of your books down at the station.\
    \ If we take you back there, will you sign them for us?\u201D\n\u201COf course\
    \ I will,\u201D I said, \u201CIf, afterwards, you will return me to the launch\
    \ party for Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel!\u201D\n\u201C\
    Better than that,\u201D said Cargpan, \u201CWe will throw a party for you ourselves.\
    \ I don't know if you have ever been to a coppers\u2019 party, Mr P., but we can\
    \ guarantee you a splendid time.\u201D\nAnd so it turned out that I ended the\
    \ evening absolutely stuffed with cream crackers, wearing a paper hat, and regaling\
    \ a basement full of coppers with piquant anecdotes of the literary life. More\
    \ to the point, I gathered invaluable material for my forthcoming bestselling\
    \ paperback potboiler Tied To A Yew Tree By Coppers! (working title), which I\
    \ should have finished by late tomorrow afternoon."
