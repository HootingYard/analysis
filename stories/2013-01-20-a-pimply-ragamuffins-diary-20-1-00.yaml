  text: 'A recently dug-up diary for this day in 1900:

    I am a pimply ragamuffin of no great consequence in this world. But my doings
    will resound down the ages, and be pored over by generations yet unborn, because
    I am keeping this diary and, at intervals, every one hundred pages or so, I put
    the scribbled sheets into a bag and the bag into a sack and the sack into a box
    and the box I bury in a field, in different fields dotted hither and thither,
    where one day in the future a man wielding a spade or shovel will dig up my diary
    and it will be pored over, as I said just now, by generations yet unborn.

    First thing this morning, I gazed into the greasy glass and counted my pimples.
    There is a different number every day, which I jot down in a separate notebook.
    It seems that overnight, while I lie on my straw pallet in the corner of the barn,
    thrashing about, fast asleep yet disturbed by terrible dreams, several pimples
    erupt and several others subside or vanish. Sometimes I trace the patterns they
    form on my whey-coloured face, just in case, like the constellations of stars
    in the sky, there is a message to be read in them. I have buried some of my pimple
    diagrams alongside my diary pages, so perhaps in the future a significance I cannot
    fathom will be apparent to those who come after me, armed as they may be with
    a greater knowledge of patterns and mysteries and pimple distribution.

    Then I took my begging bowl and sat on a clump by a verge and hoped for alms.
    A passing person gave me an old holed woollen sock to serve as a mitten for my
    tiny frozen hand. Oddly, both of my hands are unpimpled. Another passing person
    had no matching sock, alas, but did give me a bar of soap. But today I had chosen
    the wrong clump, or the wrong verge, or both, because nobody else passed all day
    long.

    Towards sunset I trudged off to Brantwood to see my one pal, the mad old gent
    with the Old Testament beard whose demented ravings I keep meaning to transcribe.
    But I will need a different notebook, different from my diary notebooks and my
    pimple count notebook. Perhaps I will be able to get one in exchange for the bar
    of soap from a filthy stationer.

    As I approached Brantwood, skirting the reservoir and passing the waterfall and
    the harbour, where the Jumping Jenny was tied to a painter, and the ice house
    and the slate seat facing the tumbling stream, I sensed something amiss. My pimples
    grew hot, a sure sign of impending calamity. And indeed, as I came to the house,
    out of it emerged a black-clad fellow with a grave look etched upon his countenance,
    who exclaimed:

    "Mistah Ruskin--he dead."
