    \ Hardly, Mary Wilks -\u201D\nSince the turn of the year I have been immersing\
    \ myself in the novels of Ronald Firbank. The quotation above, from Valmouth (1919),\
    \ is a list of the centenarians of the eponymous townlet, where something in the\
    \ air means \u201CValmouth centenarians will be soon as common as peas!\u201D\
    \ This is the only one of Firbank's books I have read previously, and because\
    \ I have a chronological list of every book I have read over the past thirty years,\
    \ I can date that earlier reading to 1989.\nTwo years earlier, in 1987, under\
    \ the Malice Aforethought Press imprint, I published a set of twenty-six alphabetic\
    \ potted biographies entitled A Zest For Crumpled Things. The fifth of these was\
    \ named . . . Violet Ebbing. I still remember the weird tingle of surprise as\
    \ I read Firbank in 1989 and saw that name, which I had plucked out of the aether.\
    \ What spooky forces were at work?, I wondered, and still wonder.\nI don't think\
    \ I have ever put the text of A Zest For Crumpled Things online, so I shall endeavour\
    \ to do so at some point. Meanwhile, it seems you can pick up a copy for the bargain\
    \ price of \xA388.44 here."
