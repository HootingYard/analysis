    Since the turn of the year I have been immersing myself in the novels of Ronald
    Firbank. The quotation above, from Valmouth (1919), is a list of the centenarians
    of the eponymous townlet, where something in the air means "Valmouth centenarians
    will be soon as common as peas!" This is the only one of Firbank''s books I have
    read previously, and because I have a chronological list of every book I have
    read over the past thirty years, I can date that earlier reading to 1989.

    Two years earlier, in 1987, under the Malice Aforethought Press imprint, I published
    a set of twenty-six alphabetic potted biographies entitled A Zest For Crumpled
    Things. The fifth of these was named . . . Violet Ebbing. I still remember the
    weird tingle of surprise as I read Firbank in 1989 and saw that name, which I
    had plucked out of the aether. What spooky forces were at work?, I wondered, and
    still wonder.

    I don''t think I have ever put the text of A Zest For Crumpled Things online,
    so I shall endeavour to do so at some point. Meanwhile, it seems you can pick
    up a copy for the bargain price of PS88.44 here.'
