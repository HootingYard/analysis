  text: "The diary of a crow, on this day in 1970:\nWoke up in a foul temper. I was\
    \ really, really pissed off. Sat atop a tree and shouted my head off. I was still\
    \ pissed off but I went down to the car park to meet my crow pals. We strutted\
    \ about, intimidating smaller birds and indeed anybody else we came upon.\nLater\
    \ I went to sit atop a tree just outside Mytholmroyd in the West Riding of Yorkshire.\
    \ Did a bit of cawing. Spotted a bloke with a notepad and pen, who seemed to be\
    \ jotting down my caws. I wasn't having that, so I swooped down and had a quick\
    \ slash at his face with my talons.\n\u201CBy \u2018eck!\u201D he cried, \u201C\
    'Appen you've drawn blood, crow! Just like the first time I kissed my poor wife\
    \ Sylvia, dead by her own hand these seven years.\u201D\nThen he added \u201C\
    BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR\u201D, in Real Orghast. I didn't realise darkness had opened\
    \ its womb, but looking round I saw night was falling, so I headed for a different\
    \ tree and shouted my head off for a while because I was still in a foul mood.\
    \ Then I fell asleep.\n\nSnap of crow copyright Arlette Berlie"
