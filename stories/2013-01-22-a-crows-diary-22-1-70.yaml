  text: 'The diary of a crow, on this day in 1970:

    Woke up in a foul temper. I was really, really pissed off. Sat atop a tree and
    shouted my head off. I was still pissed off but I went down to the car park to
    meet my crow pals. We strutted about, intimidating smaller birds and indeed anybody
    else we came upon.

    Later I went to sit atop a tree just outside Mytholmroyd in the West Riding of
    Yorkshire. Did a bit of cawing. Spotted a bloke with a notepad and pen, who seemed
    to be jotting down my caws. I wasn''t having that, so I swooped down and had a
    quick slash at his face with my talons.

    "By ''eck!" he cried, "''Appen you''ve drawn blood, crow! Just like the first
    time I kissed my poor wife Sylvia, dead by her own hand these seven years."

    Then he added "BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR", in Real Orghast. I didn''t realise darkness
    had opened its womb, but looking round I saw night was falling, so I headed for
    a different tree and shouted my head off for a while because I was still in a
    foul mood. Then I fell asleep.
