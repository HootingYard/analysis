  text: "Musingly he lit a cigarette. Through the open window a bee droned in on the\
    \ blue air of evening. Closing his eyes he fell to considering whether the bee\
    \ of one country would understand the remarks of that of another. The effect of\
    \ the soil of a nation, had it consequences upon its flora? Were plants influenced\
    \ at their roots? People sometimes spoke (and especially ladies) of the language\
    \ of flowers . . . the pollen therefore of an English rose would probably vary,\
    \ not inconsiderably, from that of a French, and a bee born and bred at home .\
    \ . .would be at a loss to understand (it clearly followed) the conversation of\
    \ one born and bred, here, abroad. A bee's idiom varied then, as did man's! And\
    \ he wondered, this being proved the case, where the best bees\u2019 accents were\
    \ generally acquired.\nRonald Firbank, The Flower Beneath The Foot (1923)"
