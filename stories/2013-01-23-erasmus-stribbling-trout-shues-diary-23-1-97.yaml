text: "A diary from Greenbrier County, West Virginia, this day in 1897:\nToday I murdered\
  \ my wife. I mashed her windpipe and broke her neck, which might seem an overreaction\
  \ to the fact that she had not cooked any meat for my dinner, but then, as my first\
  \ wife would tell you, I am a cruel and horrible and violent man. My second wife\
  \ would probably say the same, had she not died in mysterious circumstances shortly\
  \ after our marriage. Zona, who I killed today, was my third wife. I hope to have\
  \ seven eventually.\nI won't get a chance to marry a further four wives if I am\
  \ hanged or imprisoned for murder. So I took various steps to cover my tracks. I\
  \ laid Zona out on the bed and dressed her in a high-necked dress with a stiff collar,\
  \ and placed a veil over her face. When Dr Knapp arrived to examine the corpse,\
  \ I sobbed and wailed and cradled Zona's head in my hands. That did the trick, and\
  \ he did not inspect her too closely, noting that death was due to \u201Ceverlasting\
  \ faint\u201D.\nSo everything went according to plan and I seem to be in the clear,\
  \ free to find a fourth wife to terrorise and/or kill. The worst that could happen\
  \ is that Zona might appear as a ghost, to her grieving mother, and spill the beans,\
  \ and prove that I broke her neck by rotating her ghostly head in a full circle\
  \ atop her ghostly body. But even if she does, repeatedly, over four nights, and\
  \ Zona's mother goes babbling her tale, an American court of law in the enlightened\
  \ 1890s is not going to accept the testimony of a ghost. Is it?\n\n[It did.]"
