  text: 'A diary from Greenbrier County, West Virginia, this day in 1897:

    Today I murdered my wife. I mashed her windpipe and broke her neck, which might
    seem an overreaction to the fact that she had not cooked any meat for my dinner,
    but then, as my first wife would tell you, I am a cruel and horrible and violent
    man. My second wife would probably say the same, had she not died in mysterious
    circumstances shortly after our marriage. Zona, who I killed today, was my third
    wife. I hope to have seven eventually.

    I won''t get a chance to marry a further four wives if I am hanged or imprisoned
    for murder. So I took various steps to cover my tracks. I laid Zona out on the
    bed and dressed her in a high-necked dress with a stiff collar, and placed a veil
    over her face. When Dr Knapp arrived to examine the corpse, I sobbed and wailed
    and cradled Zona''s head in my hands. That did the trick, and he did not inspect
    her too closely, noting that death was due to "everlasting faint".

    So everything went according to plan and I seem to be in the clear, free to find
    a fourth wife to terrorise and/or kill. The worst that could happen is that Zona
    might appear as a ghost, to her grieving mother, and spill the beans, and prove
    that I broke her neck by rotating her ghostly head in a full circle atop her ghostly
    body. But even if she does, repeatedly, over four nights, and Zona''s mother goes
    babbling her tale, an American court of law in the enlightened 1890s is not going
    to accept the testimony of a ghost. Is it?


    [It did.]'
