  text: "So there I was, standing by a Norwegian roadside as smoke from a blazing\
    \ consignment of Norwegian goat cheese billowed in goaty cheesy gusts. Luckily,\
    \ standing next to me was Kjell Bjoern Vinje of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration.\n\
    \u201CTell me, Kjell Bjoern Vinje,\u201D I shouted, \u201CCan you recall any previous\
    \ occasions when cheese has caught fire on Norwegian roads?\u201D\nI did not catch\
    \ his reply, but a BBC News reporter did.\n[Thanks to Glyn Webster.]"
