  text: 'So there I was, standing by a Norwegian roadside as smoke from a blazing
    consignment of Norwegian goat cheese billowed in goaty cheesy gusts. Luckily,
    standing next to me was Kjell Bjoern Vinje of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration.

    "Tell me, Kjell Bjoern Vinje," I shouted, "Can you recall any previous occasions
    when cheese has caught fire on Norwegian roads?"

    I did not catch his reply, but a BBC News reporter did.

    [Thanks to Glyn Webster.]'
