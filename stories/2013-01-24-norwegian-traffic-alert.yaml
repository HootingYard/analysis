text: "So there I was, standing by a Norwegian roadside as smoke from a blazing consignment\
  \ of Norwegian goat cheese billowed in goaty cheesy gusts. Luckily, standing next\
  \ to me was Kjell Bjoern Vinje of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration.\n\u201C\
  Tell me, Kjell Bjoern Vinje,\u201D I shouted, \u201CCan you recall any previous\
  \ occasions when cheese has caught fire on Norwegian roads?\u201D\nI did not catch\
  \ his reply, but a BBC News reporter did.\n[Thanks to Glyn Webster.]"
