  text: "The diary of an ignorant ornithologist, this day in 1946:\nI had arranged\
    \ to spend the morning birdwatching with Dennis, so shortly after daybreak I met\
    \ him as arranged at his \u201Chide\u201D. This is a small, low, concrete pillbox\
    \ at the edge of the marshes, from within which one has a sweeping view, but cannot\
    \ oneself be seen. I was very impatient to spot some birds, so no sooner had we\
    \ made ourselves comfortable than I snatched Dennis\u2019 binoculars and peered\
    \ through them.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D I cried, \u201CA marsh warbler!\u201D\n\u201C\
    Really?\u201D said Dennis, \u201CLet me take a look.\u201D\nAnd he snatched back\
    \ the binoculars and peered through them. Then he emitted a great sigh, expressing\
    \ all at once pity and exasperation, bafflement and resignation.\n\u201CCleothgard,\u201D\
    \ he said, turning to look at me, \u201CJust because it is at a marsh and is making\
    \ a warbling sound does not make it a marsh warbler. Look again -\u201D and he\
    \ handed back the binoculars, \u201C- and tell me, is it bewinged? Does it have\
    \ a beak and feathers?\u201D\nI peered again, rapt, but had to confess that I\
    \ was unable to see any of these telltale bird features.\n\u201CWhat you can see,\u201D\
    \ said Dennis, \u201Cis not a marsh warbler. Granted, it is a living thing at\
    \ a marsh making little warbling sounds. But what in fact it is, is a little orphan\
    \ child, out roaming the marshes at daybreak, and warbling, or singing tremulously,\
    \ perhaps because it is a naturally cheerful orphan, or more likely from a nerve-racked\
    \ desire to drown out the eerie morning marshland sounds of gust and creak and\
    \ slosh. Hark now to the words of the little orphan's warbled song, and you will\
    \ gather why he is afeared.\u201D\nI pricked up my ears and listened carefully.\n\
    Tra la la, tra la lee, sometimes I warble and sometimes I sulk\n  I hope I'm not\
    \ accosted by an escaped convict from the hulk\nAnd sure enough, as I watched\
    \ I saw the orphan of a sudden accosted by a fierce bedraggled chain-clanking\
    \ convict, newly escaped from a hulk moored out beyond the marshes. He bore a\
    \ distinct resemblance to the Scottish actor Finlay Currie.\n\u201CGosh!\u201D\
    \ I said, \u201CA cassowary!\u201D\nDennis thumped me on the head with a brick.\n\
    \nA cassowary and a marsh warbler"
