  text: "The diary of an ignorant ornithologist, this day in 1946:\nI had arranged\
    \ to spend the morning birdwatching with Dennis, so shortly after daybreak I met\
    \ him as arranged at his \"hide\". This is a small, low, concrete pillbox at the\
    \ edge of the marshes, from within which one has a sweeping view, but cannot oneself\
    \ be seen. I was very impatient to spot some birds, so no sooner had we made ourselves\
    \ comfortable than I snatched Dennis' binoculars and peered through them.\n\"\
    Gosh!\" I cried, \"A marsh warbler!\"\n\"Really?\" said Dennis, \"Let me take\
    \ a look.\"\nAnd he snatched back the binoculars and peered through them. Then\
    \ he emitted a great sigh, expressing all at once pity and exasperation, bafflement\
    \ and resignation.\n\"Cleothgard,\" he said, turning to look at me, \"Just because\
    \ it is at a marsh and is making a warbling sound does not make it a marsh warbler.\
    \ Look again -\" and he handed back the binoculars, \"- and tell me, is it bewinged?\
    \ Does it have a beak and feathers?\"\nI peered again, rapt, but had to confess\
    \ that I was unable to see any of these telltale bird features.\n\"What you can\
    \ see,\" said Dennis, \"is not a marsh warbler. Granted, it is a living thing\
    \ at a marsh making little warbling sounds. But what in fact it is, is a little\
    \ orphan child, out roaming the marshes at daybreak, and warbling, or singing\
    \ tremulously, perhaps because it is a naturally cheerful orphan, or more likely\
    \ from a nerve-racked desire to drown out the eerie morning marshland sounds of\
    \ gust and creak and slosh. Hark now to the words of the little orphan's warbled\
    \ song, and you will gather why he is afeared.\"\nI pricked up my ears and listened\
    \ carefully.\nTra la la, tra la lee, sometimes I warble and sometimes I sulk\n\
    \  I hope I'm not accosted by an escaped convict from the hulk\nAnd sure enough,\
    \ as I watched I saw the orphan of a sudden accosted by a fierce bedraggled chain-clanking\
    \ convict, newly escaped from a hulk moored out beyond the marshes. He bore a\
    \ distinct resemblance to the Scottish actor Finlay Currie.\n\"Gosh!\" I said,\
    \ \"A cassowary!\"\nDennis thumped me on the head with a brick.\n\nA cassowary\
    \ and a marsh warbler"
