  text: "The diary of a hallucinating in-patient at the Hoon Hospital, on this day\
    \ one year ago:\nI woke up this morning with a head full of verse\n  And at once\
    \ I called out to the stationery nurse\n  \"Bring me pencil and paper and pray\
    \ don't delay\n  For I have significant things I must say.\n  In my dreams I've\
    \ had insights both deep and poetic!\"\n  But the nurse dosed me up with a powerful\
    \ emetic\n  And I vomited my breakfast before I'd even eaten\n  A splurge all\
    \ eggy and branny and wheaten.\n  \"Lie back,\" said the nurse, \"Let your ravings\
    \ cease.\n  You are in the throes of a terrible disease.\n  That's why you're\
    \ in hospital, you foolish clot.\"\n  And she felt my forehead and my forehead\
    \ was hot.\n  \"But where is my pencil and where is my jotter?\"\n  I cried as\
    \ my forehead grew hotter and hotter\n  Then doctors swept in and prodded my head\n\
    \  And I let out a groan and sank back on the bed.\n  But inside my brain the\
    \ verses came teeming\n  Of Zeinab Badawi, Anna Ford, and Jan Leeming,\n  Of television\
    \ newsreaders no longer seen\n  Reading the news on the television screen,\n \
    \ Reginald Bosanquet, often drunken and earthy,\n  Where now we have bumptious\
    \ Krishnan Guru-Murthy.\n  Then my head emptied out and I fell into swoon\n  In\
    \ my hospital bed in the clinic at Hoon.\n  So the world must cope somehow without\
    \ my verse\n  Is that a blessing or is it a curse?\n  \"A blessing for sure\"\
    \ said a voice stern and grim.\n  \"You're not Dennis Beerpint, you just think\
    \ you're him.\"\n  I woke. It was true. I'm not Beerpint at all.\n  I turned to\
    \ gaze at the white clinic wall.\n  Then the nurse announced it was time for my\
    \ bath\n  \"By the way.\" she said, \"Nor are you Sylvia Plath.\""
