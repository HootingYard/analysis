  text: "Harold Nicolson's diary, this day in 1932:\nThere is a dead and drowned mouse\
    \ in the lily-pond. I feel like that mouse--static, obese and decaying. Vita is\
    \ calm, comforting and considerate. And yet (for have I not been reading a batch\
    \ of insulting press-cuttings?) life is a drab and dreary thing. I have missed\
    \ it. I have made a fool of myself in every respect.\nSurely there was a time\
    \ I might have trod\n    The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance\n    Struck\
    \ one clear chord to reach the ears of God?\nVery glum. Discuss finance. Vita\
    \ keeps on saying that we have got enough to go on with. But when one goes into\
    \ it, that represents only two months. I must get a job. Yet all the jobs which\
    \ pay humiliate. And the decent jobs do not pay. Come back to Long Barn. Arrange\
    \ my books sadly. Weigh myself sadly. Have put on eight pounds. Feel ashamed of\
    \ myself, of my attainments, and my character. Am I a serious person at all? Vita\
    \ thinks I should make PS2,000 by writing a novel. I don't. The discrepancy between\
    \ these two theories causes me some distress of mind."
