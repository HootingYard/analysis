  text: 'Malcolm Muggeridge describes "fact-finding" tourists to Stalin''s Soviet
    Union in The Thirties (1940):

    Their delight in all they saw and were told, and the expression they gave to this
    delight, constitute unquestionably one of the wonders of our age. There were earnest
    advocates of the humane killing of cattle who looked up at the massive headquarters
    of the Ogpu with tears of gratitude in their eyes, earnest advocates of proportional
    representation who eagerly assented when the necessity for a Dictatorship of the
    Proletariat was explained to them, earnest clergymen who walked reverently through
    anti-God museums and reverently turned the pages of atheistic literature, earnest
    pacifists who watched delightedly tanks rattle across the Red Square and bombing
    planes darken the sky, earnest town-planning specialists who stood outside overcrowded
    ramshackle tenements and muttered: "If only we had something like this in England!"
    The almost unbelievable credulity of these mostly university-educated tourists
    astonished even Soviet officials used to handling foreign visitors.'
