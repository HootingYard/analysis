  text: 'It is exactly sixty years ago today that the lumbering walrus-moustached
    psychopathic serial killer Babinsky made his appearance on the radio programme
    Squalid Criminal Lair Discs. This was a short-lived offshoot of Desert Island
    Discs, the difference being that the guest was invited to choose what music he
    would take to a squalid criminal lair rather than to a desert island. The programme
    proved controversial, not least because Babinsky took the opportunity to hack
    to pieces with his axe and slicer the presenter, one Roy Plum. That is why it
    was a short-lived show. In fact, the Babinsky episode was the only one ever recorded.

    But the on-air slaughter of the presenter, and Babinsky''s daring escape from
    the studio pursued by Detective Captain Cargpan and his coppers, were not the
    only sources of controversy. There was much comment, in The Listener and the Radio
    Times and elsewhere, regarding the fact that Babinsky''s choices were all self-penned
    songs, including titles such as "Homburg", "Conquistador", "Mabel", and "Repent
    Walpurgis". (Many years later, much reworked and faffed with, and with the more
    terrifying passages excised, the songs were rerecorded, and claimed as their own,
    by a popular beat combo.) For Squalid Criminal Lair Discs, however, Babinsky engaged
    his own band to perform the songs, a one-off grouping including the jazz maestro
    Dollar Crane, the mysterious science fiction writer--yachtsman--cult leader L.
    Ron De La Car, the Dancer Lola R., and Errol D. Canal, alter ego of Dr. Leon Clara,
    the so-called "Lala Crone Dr." whose work with various lala crones predated Dr.
    Arthur Janov''s primal scream therapy. It was the bloodcurdling screaming of the
    lala crones that made Babinsky''s songs so puissant.

    In his flight from the studio, Babinsky stuffed into a sack not only Roy Plum''s
    head but the master tape of the programme, which he carried back to his squalid
    criminal lair. Neither head nor tape has been seen since that day, sixty years
    ago. Nor, for that matter, has anybody seen hide nor hair of the lala crones,
    despite searching for them high and low in various Mercy Homes for the Bewildered
    and the Fraught and the Baffled and the Lala.'
