  text: I decided not to extend the daily diary entries theme beyond the end of January,
    for the simple reason that I suspect it might become somewhat restrictive and
    also unforgivably dull. So there will be no overarching theme at Hooting Yard
    this year, just scrapings from the interior bran tub of my brain as and when they
    occur. Such scrapings may include the occasional thousandish-word essay "On..."
    a particular topic, and indeed the occasional diary entry, from the great or the
    not so great or the frankly fictional, but if so they will be slotted in alongside
    general witterings, insights, reportage, sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose,
    and whatnot.
