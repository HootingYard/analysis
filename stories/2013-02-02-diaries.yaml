  text: "I decided not to extend the daily diary entries theme beyond the end of January,\
    \ for the simple reason that I suspect it might become somewhat restrictive and\
    \ also unforgivably dull. So there will be no overarching theme at Hooting Yard\
    \ this year, just scrapings from the interior bran tub of my brain as and when\
    \ they occur. Such scrapings may include the occasional thousandish-word essay\
    \ \u201COn\u2026\u201D a particular topic, and indeed the occasional diary entry,\
    \ from the great or the not so great or the frankly fictional, but if so they\
    \ will be slotted in alongside general witterings, insights, reportage, sweeping\
    \ paragraphs of majestic prose, and whatnot."
