  text: 'The picture of Pebblehead''s typewriter posted yesterday prompted a bulging
    postbag, with numerous readers clamouring for further particulars of the bestselling
    paperbackist''s working practices. Among the commoner questions were: How does
    Pebblehead manage to bash out so many potboilers? How many typewriters does he
    get through in an average week? Is he capable of writing a word without having
    that pipe, crammed with acrid Serbian tobacco, clamped between his teeth? Does
    he employ a team of monkey typists?

    I was about to write, "Alas, we may never know...", when all of a sudden, a moment
    ago, Alan the postal crow flew in through the crow-vent with a press release clutched
    in his beak. I gave him some millet, and he relinquished the paper, upon which
    the following was printed, by the looks of it on a wonky Gestetner machine:

    Raymond Roussel told us How I Wrote Certain Of My Books in 1932. Now, Pebblehead
    promises to tell us How I Wrote Certain Of My Potboilers. This will undoubtedly
    be the publishing sensation of 2013, or 2014, or whenever Pebblehead manages to
    deliver the manuscript, in between bashing out hundreds more potboilers and destroying
    quite a few typewriters in the process, while monkeys cavort around him in his
    chalet o'' prose.

    Sucking on his pipe, its bowl stuffed with acrid Serbian tobacco, the bestselling
    paperbackist said: "Begone, Krishnan Guru-Murthy! I have no idea what you and
    your camera crew from Channel 4 News think you''re doing, camped out in front
    of my chalet o'' prose. You are interrupting the creative process of the most
    tireless potboilerist in the world, and if you do not leave immediately I shall
    have you set upon by Alpine zombies in tattered Nazi uniforms brandishing ray
    guns from outer space!"

    If and when How I Wrote Certain Of My Potboilers is ever actually published, review
    copies will be sent out via Alan the postal crow. Make sure your crow-vent is
    clear and free from sordid and unseemly detritus, bones of voles, etcetera.'
