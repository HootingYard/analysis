    In a comment on yesterday''s postage about Nixonian soup hatred, Salim Fadhley
    asks the intriguing question if the serving of shark''s fin soup at a dinner on
    the President''s state visit to China in 1972 prompted one of his "six crises".
    We shall overlook the fact that Nixon published his book of that title ten years
    earlier, in 1962, and we shall also overlook the fact that Mr Fadhley''s question
    is easily answered, either by reading the book itself or, if the prospect of hundreds
    of pages of Nixonian prose does not appeal, a summary of its contents which can
    be found on the wikipedia. We will soon learn that the shark''s fin soup did not
    pose a crisis for Nixon, or at least not one of the six he wrote about.

    But that is so disappointing, is it not? I would prefer to think that there is
    another book by Nixon, entitled perhaps Soup Crises, in which the thirty-seventh
    Potus describes in dramatic and unflinching detail the various soup crises he
    had to face. If, in the course of his life, there were only four soup crises,
    then an alternative title for the book could be The Four Soups. Happily, this
    is an anagram of House Of Turps, an out of print pamphlet by Mr Key. Could it
    be that I was anagrammatically channelling Nixon in 1989? I must consult a brain
    quack to delve into this important question.'
