  text: "Who was Captain Nitty? Interestingly enough, it is a question that has never\
    \ been asked before. In the long march of humankind, from primeval swamps to space\
    \ age fabness, nobody has ever wanted to know who exactly this Captain Nitty person\
    \ actually was. That should tell us something, but what? It might tell us that\
    \ Captain Nitty was an almost staggeringly insignificant figure. It might tell\
    \ us that he never actually existed and is mere figment.\nNote those figs. Fig-ure,\
    \ and fig-ment. We are all familiar, I think, from our picture books, with \u201C\
    Fig. 1\u201D or \u201CFig. A.\u201D Sometimes, depending on the nature of the\
    \ book, a Fig. might be a Plate. How much easier it would be to answer our question\
    \ if we had a Fig. or a Plate depicting Captain Nitty. If that were the case,\
    \ we could simply point at the picture and say, \u201CThere! That is Captain Nitty,\u201D\
    \ and all curiosity\u2014if indeed there were any\u2014would be satisfied, and\
    \ we could go off and do something else, something perhaps of more import, such\
    \ as circumnavigating a duckpond, or visiting an owl sanctuary.\nBut, just as\
    \ nobody has ever cared to ask who Captain Nitty was, nor has anybody ever bothered\
    \ to depict him, whether in pen and ink or daubs of paint or by mechanical means\
    \ such as a camera or Bl\xF6tzmannscope. Even the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint\
    \ never made a mezzotint of Captain Nitty, possibly because nobody was ever prepared\
    \ to pay the fat fee demanded by Rex Tint for one of his mezzotints.\nIn the absence\
    \ of a Fig. or a Plate, then, how are we to go about answering the question? Is\
    \ there a potted biography to which we might refer? \u201CPotted\u201D, in this\
    \ sense, does not mean literally that the biography is to be found planted in\
    \ a pot, like, say, an aspidistra. We must not get in a muddle about all these\
    \ figs and plates and pots. If we confuse them with actual figs, and actual plates,\
    \ and actual pots, our brains are likely to overheat as we struggle to comprehend\
    \ what we are talking about. If such overheating does occur\u2014and there are\
    \ times when it does, it does\u2014then a circumnavigation of the duckpond, or\
    \ a visit to an owl sanctuary, is a splendid coolant.\nBrain duly cooled, however,\
    \ we are still at something of a loss regarding Captain Nitty, as we have discovered,\
    \ to our horror\u2014and that is not too strong a word\u2014that no potted biography\
    \ of him exists. We ought of course to realise this. For someone to have written\
    \ a biography, potted or otherwise, they would first have had to ask the question\
    \ \u201CWho was Captain Nitty?\u201D, albeit silently, to themselves, and we already\
    \ know that it is an unasked question.\nThere are of course innumerable other\
    \ questions which have never been asked, ever, by anybody. How do you boil an\
    \ ostrich-head?, for example, or Were the tears of Saint Veronica used as a gum\
    \ for postage stamps? We could witter away until the cows come home compiling\
    \ a list of untold thousands of unasked questions, but to do so would bring us\
    \ no closer to knowing who Captain Nitty was, would it?\n\u201CWould\u201D has\
    \ the same pronunciation as \u201Cwood\u201D, but again we must avoid getting\
    \ all befuddled about wood, as with figs and plates and pots. Generally, we should\
    \ always be on our guard against befuddlement. I should cocoa."
