  text: "\n(To the tune of Oh Bring Me Your Winding-Sheet, Mother Of Mine)\nMy name\
    \ is P.V.Glob\n  I wrote a book about a bog\n  \"Bog\" spelled backwards is \"\
    Gob\"\n  And that is the name of my dog\nIn Russian, \"God\" is \"Bog\"\n  And\
    \ my dog Gob's a dog-god\n  He sleeps all day like a log\n  For a dog he's a lazy\
    \ sod\nI walk Gob to the bog\n  To wake him from his snooze\n  I can't see the\
    \ bog for the fog\n  But I hear the cows' plaintive moos\nThere are, you see,\
    \ cows near the bog\n  And one of them is a cow-god\n  A god like Gog and Magog\n\
    \  Gods who are really quite odd\nSo slumped in the muck by the bog\n  Invisible\
    \ because of the fog\n  There's me, the writer P.V.Glob\n  And my little pet doggie,\
    \ Gob\nHe is by no means a fearsome hound\n  Wait! What's that uncanny sound?\n\
    \  It's the sound of the cow-god's bog-side mooing\n  The sound of my and Gob's\
    \ undoing."
