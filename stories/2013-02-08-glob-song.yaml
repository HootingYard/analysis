  text: "\n(To the tune of Oh Bring Me Your Winding-Sheet, Mother Of Mine)\nMy name\
    \ is P.V.Glob\n  I wrote a book about a bog\n  \u201CBog\u201D spelled backwards\
    \ is \u201CGob\u201D\n  And that is the name of my dog\nIn Russian, \u201CGod\u201D\
    \ is \u201CBog\u201D\n  And my dog Gob's a dog-god\n  He sleeps all day like a\
    \ log\n  For a dog he's a lazy sod\nI walk Gob to the bog\n  To wake him from\
    \ his snooze\n  I can't see the bog for the fog\n  But I hear the cows\u2019 plaintive\
    \ moos\nThere are, you see, cows near the bog\n  And one of them is a cow-god\n\
    \  A god like Gog and Magog\n  Gods who are really quite odd\nSo slumped in the\
    \ muck by the bog\n  Invisible because of the fog\n  There's me, the writer P.V.Glob\n\
    \  And my little pet doggie, Gob\nHe is by no means a fearsome hound\n  Wait!\
    \ What's that uncanny sound?\n  It's the sound of the cow-god's bog-side mooing\n\
    \  The sound of my and Gob's undoing."
