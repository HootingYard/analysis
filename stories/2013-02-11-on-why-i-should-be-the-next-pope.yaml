  text: 'So, having previously explained why I should have been the next Archbishop
    of Canterbury and why I was the obvious choice to be the next Director General
    of the BBC, I will no doubt be asked to explain why I should be the next Pope.
    Do I really need to argue my case? Has the world collapsed to the extent that
    it is even necessary for me to stake my claim? I mean, isn''t it blindingly obvious
    that I would be absolutely the finest Pontiff you could imagine? I shall sit by
    my metal tapping machine and await the call from the conclave of cardinals, and
    while I wait I shall give due consideration to the pontifical name I shall adopt.
    Readers may have their own suggestions of course, which you may wish to note in
    the comments.

    Meanwhile, it appears that these very sensible persons of the Islamic persuasion
    were correct after all. . .
