  text: 'From the archives, this postage first appeared seven years ago today, on
    13 February 2006:


    Almost exactly two years ago, on 13 March 2004 to be precise, our quote of the
    day was by William Hope Hodgson, from From The Tideless Sea. To jog your memories,
    he wrote

    I am writing this in the saloon of the sailing ship, Homebird, and writing with
    but little hope of human eye ever seeing that which I write; for we are in the
    heart of the dread Sargasso Sea--the Tideless Sea of the North Atlantic. From
    the stump of our mizzen mast, one may see, spread out to the far horizon, an interminable
    waste of weed--a treacherous, silent vastitude of slime and hideousness!

    When I chose the quotation I was unfamiliar with the work of Hodgson, a state
    of affairs which continued, shamefully, until just a few days ago. I am indebted
    to Tim Gadd for drawing my attention to this superb writer and encouraging me
    to immerse myself in the slimy, weed-choked pages of his books.

    William Hope Hodgson (1877-1918) was an author, photographer, sailor, and body-builder,
    who wrote four novels before concentrating on short fiction. He was killed in
    the First World War. H. P. Lovecraft was an admirer, praising his "serious treatment
    of unreality," and the critic Sam Gafford notes "his apparently inexplicable choice
    of writing styles" in an essay entitled Writing Backwards.

    Reading his first published novel, The Boats Of The ''Glen Carrig'', I was struck
    by something else ''apparently inexplicable''. The story purports to be

    an account of [the boats''] Adventures in the Strange places of the Earth, after
    the foundering of the good ship ''Glen Carrig'' through striking upon a hidden
    rock in the unknown seas to the Southward, As told by John Winterstraw, Gent.,
    to his son James Winterstraw, in the year 1757, and by him committed very properly
    and legibly to manuscript

    so what we get is a thrilling yarn wherein the narrator recounts coming ashore
    in the Land of Lonesomeness. . .

    we found it to be of an abominable flatness, desolate beyond all that I could
    have imagined... in the end, we found... a slimy-banked creek... the banks being
    composed of a vile mud

    . . . before heading off to an island on a weed-choked sea where the bulk of the
    tale takes place. As in From The Tideless Sea, the setting is thus an interminable
    waste of weed--a treacherous, silent vastitude of slime and hideousness!

    Lurking in the weeds are various disgusting creatures which our heroes fight off
    and outwit, in between doing boat repairs. But is there any other writer who would
    take pains to mention every single occasion his characters break off for a meal?
    Until the end, where several weeks'' action is summarised, the narrative takes
    us day by day, and Hodgson regularly reassures us that the castaways are getting
    proper meals.

    I did some basic word-count analysis on the novel, and Hodgson''s focus of attention
    became clear. It is indeed a weed-choked book--weed, and enticing variants such
    as the weed-continent, appear 223 times (in a 60,000-word text). Considering that
    our narrator and his curiously anonymous pals spend much time in terror of the
    various disgusting creatures I mentioned, it is no surprise to find hideous, monsters,
    and tentacles accounting for a total of 51 words. Yet breakfast, dinner, and food
    win the day with 53. And as it seems de rigueur to have a puff after every meal,
    smoke is mentioned 15 times.

    I have just begun reading Hodgson''s second novel, The House On The Borderland,
    and sure enough, by page three,

    Tonnison had got the stove lit now and was busy cutting slices of bacon into the
    frying pan.

    I hope an enterprising publisher reissues Hodgson''s works, if one has not already
    done so, but I would dearly like to see The William Hope Hodgson Recipe Book,
    a boon for any picnic-person in a silent vastitude of slime and hideousness!'
