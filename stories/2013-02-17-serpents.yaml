  text: 'Emmett lived in a trailer park out by the airport. I took a back road and
    ran over a dead snake on the way. Louise turned to me. "You just drove right over
    that snake."

    "That was an old broken fan belt."

    "It was white on the bottom. Do you think I don''t know a snake when I see one?"

    I told her he was already dead and that women were easily taken in by serpents.
