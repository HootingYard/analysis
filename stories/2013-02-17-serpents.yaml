  text: "Emmett lived in a trailer park out by the airport. I took a back road and\
    \ ran over a dead snake on the way. Louise turned to me. \u201CYou just drove\
    \ right over that snake.\u201D\n\u201CThat was an old broken fan belt.\u201D\n\
    \u201CIt was white on the bottom. Do you think I don't know a snake when I see\
    \ one?\u201D\nI told her he was already dead and that women were easily taken\
    \ in by serpents.\nCharles Portis, Gringos (1991)\n"
