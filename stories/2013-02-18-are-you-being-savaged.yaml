  text: "Are You Being Savaged? was a popular television situation comedy in the 1970s.\
    \ It was set in an eerie and mist-enshrouded forest clearing, where a cast of\
    \ regular characters were attacked by a variety of wild beasts. Much of the humour\
    \ derives from the attempts of the cast to fight off savage and blood-crazed panthers,\
    \ lions, bears, etcetera, armed only with a tape measure.\nAmong the show's memorable\
    \ catchphrases were \u201CUnhand me, you brute!\u201D, \u201CEek! My windpipe\
    \ has just been slashed by the razor-sharp claws of a wild hog!\u201D and \u201C\
    Let's put the kettle on for a nice piping hot cup of tea\u201D.\nToday DVD copies\
    \ of the first two series are particularly popular with zoo monkeys."
