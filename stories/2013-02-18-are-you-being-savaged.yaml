text: "Are You Being Savaged? was a popular television situation comedy in the 1970s.\
  \ It was set in an eerie and mist-enshrouded forest clearing, where a cast of regular\
  \ characters were attacked by a variety of wild beasts. Much of the humour derives\
  \ from the attempts of the cast to fight off savage and blood-crazed panthers, lions,\
  \ bears, etcetera, armed only with a tape measure.\nAmong the show's memorable catchphrases\
  \ were \u201CUnhand me, you brute!\u201D, \u201CEek! My windpipe has just been slashed\
  \ by the razor-sharp claws of a wild hog!\u201D and \u201CLet's put the kettle on\
  \ for a nice piping hot cup of tea\u201D.\nToday DVD copies of the first two series\
  \ are particularly popular with zoo monkeys."
