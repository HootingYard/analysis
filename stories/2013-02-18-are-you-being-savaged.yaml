  text: 'Are You Being Savaged? was a popular television situation comedy in the 1970s.
    It was set in an eerie and mist-enshrouded forest clearing, where a cast of regular
    characters were attacked by a variety of wild beasts. Much of the humour derives
    from the attempts of the cast to fight off savage and blood-crazed panthers, lions,
    bears, etcetera, armed only with a tape measure.

    Among the show''s memorable catchphrases were "Unhand me, you brute!", "Eek! My
    windpipe has just been slashed by the razor-sharp claws of a wild hog!" and "Let''s
    put the kettle on for a nice piping hot cup of tea".

    Today DVD copies of the first two series are particularly popular with zoo monkeys.'
