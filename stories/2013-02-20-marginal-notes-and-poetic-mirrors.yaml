  text: 'I mentioned recently that in the first week of March I shall be rejoining
    the international jetset and swooping down upon New York City. This kind of shenanigans
    undermines my reputation as a Diogenesian recluse, but you will be relieved to
    hear that I am bent upon important Hooting Yard business. To wit, the launch of
    this lavish and lovely book:


    Here is part of the official press release from Westreich Wagner:

    "works of James Beckett with constant interjections by Frank Key"

    In a spatially and conceptually complex arrangement of text, image and scale,
    this book is a multi-vocal account of the varied practice of Amsterdam-based artist
    James Beckett. Beckett''s work explores minor histories, many of which are concerned
    with industrial development and demise across Europe, a process of investigation
    which is as much physical as it is biographical. The pages of this new monograph
    are littered with associative interjections from the archive of Frank Key''s radio
    program "Hooting Yard", as an irreverent running commentary. These texts become
    marginal notes to, and poetic mirrors of, the contributions of the book''s eleven
    other authors.

    Contributing Authors:

    Will Bradley, Kari Cwynar, Moosje M. Goosen, Will Holder, Virginija Januskeviciute,
    Kathrin Jentjens, Angela Jerardi, Frank Key, Frances Larson, Catrin Lorch, Brian
    Pugh and Dieter Roelstraete.

    The launch itself, which will feature Mr Key spouting his texts out loud, takes
    place from 6.00-8.00 PM on Monday 4 March at 114 Greene Street, Floor 2, New York,
    NY 10012. Should any fanatically devoted Hooting Yard readers and listeners wish
    to attend, please send a note to the publishers here.'
