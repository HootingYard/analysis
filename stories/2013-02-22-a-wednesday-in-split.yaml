  text: 'One Wednesday afternoon in Split, Ferdy Pogostic was bouncing along the boulevard
    on his pogo-stick when he heard a voice in his head.

    "Ferdinand! You are the living embodiment of the great Gak! Go forth and do the
    doings of the Gak!"

    But Ferdy heeded not the voice, and continued to bounce along. So the voice returned,
    more insistent, deafening, until Ferdy paid attention to it. He stopped bouncing,
    and chucked his pogo-stick into a canal, and went forth as instructed.

    His first stopping point was a Split butcher''s shop. He marched in under the
    awning and announced to the startled butcher that he, Ferdy, was the great Gak,
    and that he must have a blood sausage.

    "For the great Gak has a blood sausage in all the paintings and icons," he added,
    as if in explanation.

    The startled butcher had no idea what this bedraggled fool was talking about,
    and sent him packing with a flea in his ear.

    And so Ferdy Pogostic went a-wandering through the streets of Split, without his
    pogo-stick and without a blood sausage, and nobody recognised him as the living
    embodiment of the great Gak.

    And eventually, on the outskirts of Split, he sat him down anent a well. And then
    came the voice once more within his head.

    "Oops. I mistook you for a different bedgraggled fool. You are not after all the
    living embodiment of the great Gak. My apologies."

    And Ferdy Pogostic sat by the well and wept.

    And there came a terrific thunderstorm and teeming rainfall, so much rain that
    the well filled up with water, until it overflowed. And there, bobbing to the
    surface, was a well-duck, with bright feathers and gleaming beak. It quacked at
    Ferdy in a language he did not comprehend. He chucked a pebble at it.

    By now it was Wednesday evening and time for Ferdy to go home. In spite of the
    unfriendly pebble, the duck splashed out of the well and followed him, waddling
    in his wake. And when he was home and was sitting in his armchair by the fire
    in his chalet in an insalubrious neighbourhood in Split, the well-duck came and
    sat upon his head, and would not budge.

    "Tomorrow," said Ferdy to himself, "I must retrieve my pogo-stick from the canal.
    Perhaps when I am once again bouncing along the boulevard I will be able to dislodge
    this damnable duck."

    But could he?

    Across town, the startled butcher was in the back room of his shop, behind a bead
    curtain, stuffing sausage skins with the blood of ducks. On the wall hung an icon
    of the great Gak. Or was it the butcher''s mirror?'
