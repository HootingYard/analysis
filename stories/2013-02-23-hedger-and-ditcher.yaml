  text: 'One of my uncles was a hedger who had his own ditch, and another uncle was
    a ditcher who laid claim to a hedge. That''s the thing about being a peasant,
    it can be mightily confusing. When I was a tot I always used to get the hedger
    uncle and the ditcher uncle mixed up. Their brother--my father--tried to teach
    me which was which, though his pedagogical methods were rather unusual. He seemed
    to believe I might learn to tell a hedger from a ditcher by penning me in a pig
    sty among the many pigs from dawn till dusk, with slate and chalk, and a sort
    of metal harness on my head, a contraption he had beaten out of a broken churn.

    My father, you see, unlike his brothers, was a peasant with ideas. Few if any
    of them were sensible ideas, nor were any of them the fruits of rustic wisdom,
    handed down through the ages. No, my father''s ideas sprang fully-formed into
    his head. It was an odd head, a bit too large for his body, plum-coloured, and
    topped with an extravagant bouffant that might better have suited a maestro of
    the opera house. Somebody had once told my father that his head had to be a bit
    too big in order to contain comfortably his gigantic brain. That they were joshing
    him never occurred to Papa. He really believed, in the absence of any X-rays or
    probes or scans, that he had an enormous, and concomitantly powerful, brain.

    When he died I took it upon myself to remove the brain from his skull, using a
    saw, and I discovered it to be no bigger than the average adult human brain. If
    anything, it veered towards the smaller size. I put it in a jar filled to the
    brim with brine, screwed the cap on tight, and then released his body to the priest
    for burial, but not before gluing the top of his head back on to conceal evidence
    of my unauthorised sawing.

    He was the first of the brothers to go, so when I held a little wake, after the
    funeral, both my uncles, the hedger with the ditch and the ditcher with the hedge,
    were present. They were leaning against the pig sty fence, glugging grog from
    tin beakers, and muttering to each other in their guttural barbaric peasant argot.
    It made no sense to me, as one of my father''s mad ideas had been to bring me
    up to speak as if I were a person of consequence in the world. Thus my speaking
    voice, in addition to my slate and chalk and my metal head-harness, marked me
    out from my fellows and made of me something of an oddball.

    Now that Papa was dead I felt I should get to know my uncles better, or at least
    well enough to tell the one from the other. I thought they might be interested
    to see the brain in the jar, so I took it from the shelf in the barn where I kept
    it and approached them at the pig sty fence.

    "Hello, uncles," I piped up, in my hi-falutin voice, "Look what I''ve got here!"

    They turned, the hedger and the ditcher, from gazing at the pigs to gazing at
    me. In their eyes I saw thousands of years of stupidity and rustic ignorance,
    and at once I knew I would never be able to make myself understood to them. The
    hedger, or possibly the ditcher, grunted, and the other belched.

    "This is Papa''s brain," I said, waving the jar in front of them, "You see, it
    was not so huge after all."

    Then they both spat into their beakers, and each mussed my hair, or as much of
    it as they could muss through the metal harness, and they trudged away, the one
    to his hedge or ditch and the other to his ditch or hedge.

    Oh, it was all so long ago. I think of them now, my uncles, as I slump at my desk
    in my ivory tower, surrounded by fat dusty books in incomprehensible languages,
    and up there, on a high shelf, sits the jar of brine containing my father''s brain.
    It has shrivelled over the years, until it is a tiny thing, a tiny thing indeed.

    NOTE : I suddenly recall that I wrote an earlier piece with the title Hedger And
    Ditcher, which is also preoccupied with my father. It is worth noting that the
    fathers in both pieces are wholly fictional, and if they bear any resemblance
    to my real father at all, it is a lopsided resemblance born in my brain.'
