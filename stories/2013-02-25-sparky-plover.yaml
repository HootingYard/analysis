  text: "I was out one day observing birds when I saw what I considered to be a particularly\
    \ sparky little plover. I said as much to my walking companion, Dulcie The Bird\
    \ Woman.\n\u201CLook, Dulcie!\u201D I said, pointing, \u201CIs that not a sparky\
    \ plover?\u201D I pronounced plover to rhyme with the plant, clover.\n\u201CI\
    \ think you will find,\u201D hissed Dulcie The Bird Woman, whose every utterance\
    \ was a hiss, \u201CThat it is pronounced plover to rhyme with the trade of glover,\
    \ a man who maketh gloves. But be that as it may, what could possibly lead you\
    \ to dub it sparky? It is not shooting forth sparks, and if it were, I think the\
    \ both of us would be mightily disconcerted.\u201D\n\u201CI was using the word\
    \ sparky as Father Hopkins deployed it in his juvenile verse drama Floris In Italy,\u201D\
    \ I said, \u201CWhere he writes Such spiders web he ties across his sight, insert\
    \ ellipsis, Gilds with some sparky fancies blinding night, where sparky is a synonym\
    \ for lively or vivacious. It is in the same sense it was used as the name of\
    \ a weekly children's comic I used occasionally to read when I was a tot.\u201D\
    \n\u201CA different sense, then, to the spark translated from the Russian Iskra,\
    \ which was no children's comic but an organ of Bolshevik propaganda in pre-revolutionary\
    \ Russia,\u201D hissed Dulcie, who was surprisingly erudite in many matters not\
    \ relating directly to birds.\n\u201CI wouldn't know about that,\u201D I said,\
    \ \u201CI am woefully ignorant of Bolshevism.\u201D\nWe were standing, having\
    \ paused to take in the plover, on a path winding alongside an estuary. Scattered\
    \ here and there beside the path were the stumps of unknown trees. Dulcie The\
    \ Bird Woman sat down on one, and took from her bag a greaseproof paper package\
    \ containing a sandwich.\n\u201COf course,\u201D she hissed, between munches,\
    \ \u201CA robot plover might emit sparks, had something gone awry with its wiring.\
    \ But only a fool would build such a robot.\u201D\nI nodded. I had not brought\
    \ any sandwiches with me, for I was feckless.\n\u201CI have to say,\u201D continued\
    \ Dulcie, \u201CThat your plover seems neither more nor less lively and vivacious\
    \ than any other plover, nor indeed than any other wading bird. It is merely going\
    \ about its business in the shallows at the edge of the estuary.\u201D\n\u201C\
    It is not my plover,\u201D I protested.\nShe fixed me with an odd, somehow menacing,\
    \ look, as she swallowed the last of her sandwich.\n\u201CAre you quite sure of\
    \ that?\u201D she hissed.\n\u201CIt is merely a plover I spotted and described\
    \ as sparky,\u201D I said, \u201CWhy would I lay any further claim to it?\u201D\
    \nDulcie The Bird Woman chuckled to herself, then hissed:\n\u201CIt was said,\
    \ of both Rudolf Steiner and Chou En-lai, that they seemed to emit flashes of\
    \ mysterious light. Perhaps your sparky plover, too, is such a marvel. Look!\u201D\
    \nI was already looking at the plover, and sure enough, it suddenly cast forth\
    \ a flash of glittering effulgence, a brilliant radiance that would have blinded\
    \ me had I not turned my head away and shut my eyes. When I opened them again,\
    \ I saw that Dulcie had put on a pair of sunglasses and was eating a plum.\n\u201C\
    That is a very interesting bird,\u201D she hissed, \u201CYou were right to point\
    \ it out, it alone, among all the other plovers and dotterels and wading birds.\
    \ Here, take this net, and bag your sparky plover, and take it home with you.\
    \ It will not resist. It is your bird-familiar.\u201D\nI had no idea what she\
    \ was talking about, but, as if in a dream, I took the net she had drawn out of\
    \ her pippy bag, and I scampered off toward the shoreline, toward the plover.\
    \ Was it really mine? Was it really my familiar?\nAs I closed upon it, fanning\
    \ out the net, it again shot forth a flash of incandescent light, and in that\
    \ moment it seemed I and the bird and the light were all one. Was it a moment,\
    \ or was it a year, a century, a millennium? I could not tell. But when the light\
    \ faded, I dug my short stubby bill into the sand and pulled out a juicy worm,\
    \ and as I guzzled it down I looked up and saw, sitting on the stump of an unknown\
    \ tree, a woman. She stood up, hoisted a bag over her shoulder, and, before walking\
    \ away, she chucked a plumstone at me. It missed me by a whisker."
