  text: 'The Appointed Pointy Panel of the Pointy Town Institute of Pointiness was
    rocked to its foundations yesterday by explosive revelations of malfeasance, perfidy,
    and pelf. Unnamed sources suggested that the entire edifice could be brought crashing
    to the ground.

    "Let there be no mistake," said the source, "There has been malfeasance at the
    highest levels, as well as perfidy and pelf, and not only at the highest levels
    but at several lower strata. Quite how we go forward following these explosive
    revelations is unclear. But go forward we shall, pointedly."

    The revelations first threatened to become combustible shortly after breakfast
    time, and exploded immediately thereafter. So explosive were the explosions that
    trees, including planes, poplars, pines, larches, sycamores, and yews were flattened,
    and birds dropped dead from the sky. An eerie orangey purply yellowish mist o''erspread
    Pointy Town, rendering most of the pointiest bits barely visible.

    "I have not seen anything like this since that business of the illegal picnicking
    hoo-hah of yore," said one old-timer, a grizzled stoaty fellow leaning against
    a wall in a pointy part of town. So ancient was he that nobody else had a clue
    what he was talking about.

    Other Pointy Towners were more, or less, circumspect. Some were not circumspect
    at all. Several had difficulty grasping the concept of circumspection, and of
    pointiness, and even of malfeasance and perfidy and pelf.

    "Personally I can''t see what all the fuss is about," said a man who gave his
    name as Unanugu, standing hopelessly at a decommissioned bus stop, "I am just
    waiting for the 666, even though the little dwarvish familiar perched on my shoulder,
    invisible to all but me, tells me it will never pass this way again. But if I
    believed everything it told me I would not be a salt of the earth citizen of Pointy
    Town, would I?"

    Markets reacted in juddering fashion to the explosive revelations. The pane dropped
    precipitously, then sprang back up, and kept on springing, until it settled, just
    before dusk, at parity with the grebe.

    Emergency coat hangers and tea strainers have been drafted in. The entrails of
    a slaughtered albino hen will be read today at midday by a haruspex with a klaxon
    on a balcony in a thunderstorm.'
