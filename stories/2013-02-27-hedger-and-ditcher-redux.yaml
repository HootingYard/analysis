  text: "My father's a hedger and ditcher. My mother does nothing but spin. And as\
    \ for me, well, I wallow in sin. At least, I would so wallow, were there any opportunities\
    \ for sin in this godawful rustic backwater. Oh, how I would like to be a lascivious\
    \ urban voluptuary, fat and greasy! Instead, I have to spend my days surrounded\
    \ by straw and hay and pigs\u2014pigs unnumbered!\u2014and my nights tossing and\
    \ turning on a pallet in a hayloft, exhausted yet sleepless, janglebrained and\
    \ hopeless.\nSometimes I pore over maps, searching for a path or lane that might\
    \ lead from this hellhole to a City of Sin. If ever I find one, I shall stuff\
    \ a few sorry provisions into a hanky and tie it to the end of a stick and tote\
    \ the stick over my shoulder and set off, one crack of dawn, to march along that\
    \ path or lane towards my fat and disgusting destiny.\nYesterday the village priest\
    \ came shambling past the pig sty and I hailed him. I asked him to hear my confession.\
    \ We went into a secluded corner of a barn.\n\u201CBless me father,\u201D I said,\
    \ \u201CThough I have not sinned, much as I would wish to.\u201D\n\u201CThen you\
    \ are a pure and holy person, perhaps even a saint!\u201D he replied.\n\u201C\
    But what of my sinful thoughts?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CThoughts?,\u201D he said,\
    \ \u201CYou are a peasant, and the child of peasants. Surely you cannot claim\
    \ to have an inner life? Are you not empty-headed, more akin to a beast of the\
    \ field?\u201D\n\u201CBut I do have thoughts,\u201D I protested.\nAt this the\
    \ priest looked vexed and troubled. He told me that, if I did indeed have thoughts\
    \ within my head, I must be a very peculiar peasant indeed. He posited that I\
    \ might be a changeling.\n\u201CI shall have to question your ma and pa very closely,\
    \ my child,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd get them to recollect the precise circumstances\
    \ of your birth. It may be that they found you, bundled up in swaddling cloth,\
    \ the abandoned babe of a wicked sophisticated urban person.\u201D\n\u201CGosh!\u201D\
    \ I said.\nAnd thus it was that, later, the priest took me by the hand and led\
    \ me away from the straw and the hay and the numerous pigs, away along a lane\
    \ that led to a city. He did not allow me time to gather a few meagre provisions\
    \ and bundle them up in a hanky and tie the hanky to a stick.\nAnd so I was delivered\
    \ to the city with nothing but the peasant rags I was dressed in and a letter\
    \ of introduction to a morally bankrupt urban fop of the priest's acquaintance.\n\
    After I waved goodbye to the priest, I made my way through streets teeming with\
    \ sin to the fop's bijou flatlet in a high-rise apartment. He was leaning against\
    \ a mantelpiece with a glass of brandy in one hand and a book of evil poetry in\
    \ the other. My heart was thumping. I realised this was the life I had been born\
    \ to. The foppery, the bijou high-rise flatlet, the brandy, the evil poetry .\
    \ . .\n\u201CYou smell of pig,\u201D said the fop, \u201CBegone!\u201D\n\u201C\
    B-b-but what of social mobility?\u201D I wailed, \u201CIf I have a bath . . .\u201D\
    \nThe fop held up a dainty hand to hush me.\n\u201CCease your barbaric grunting,\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CYou speak of phantasms.\u201D\nAnd from behind an arras his valet\
    \ appeared and dragged me out of the flatlet into the lift, which sank, oh so\
    \ rapidly!, back down to the street.\nLater, sprawled in the gutter, drenched\
    \ by city rainfall, spat upon by passing urban sophisticates, smelling of pig,\
    \ weeping, when it seemed all hope was lost, I had a brainstorm, such as occurs\
    \ perhaps but once in a lifetime. The idea sparked in my head fully-formed, clear\
    \ in all its details, as sharp and glittering as a diamond. I had discovered the\
    \ Blairite Third Way!"
