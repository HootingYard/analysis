  text: 'As somebody who refuses to carry a mobile phone, I found myself nodding in
    agreement with this passage from Simon Raven''s memoir Boys Will Be Boys. He was
    writing half a century ago, in 1963, about what we now call old-fashioned "landlines",
    but how right--and prescient--he was:

    Cheap and easy systems of communication simply promote cheapness in what is communicated.
    If people have to pay 5/- for a telegram or take the trouble to write and post
    a letter, they think twice before they bother you at all. If they have a telephone,
    however, even the most trivial information takes on urgency. The telephone dispenses
    irrelevance like a tap which won''t turn off; it is also a dangerous instrument
    of interference and even persecution; but like most other so-called amenities
    of modern life, the telephone is essential for dealing with complexities which
    the telephone itself has caused, and it is quick to assert its tyranny at the
    expense of those who, like myself, would ignore it.'
