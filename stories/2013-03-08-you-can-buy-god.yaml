  text: 'In the song "Joe The Lion" on his ''Heroes'' album, David Bowie tells us
    that "You can buy God". I had always thought he was spouting twaddle, and pernicious
    twaddle at that, until I saw, in a New York shop window, the baby Jesus for sale,
    with a price tag tied to his elbow. Alas, the shop was shut, and I was unable
    to make purchase.
