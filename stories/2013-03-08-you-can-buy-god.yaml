  text: "In the song \u201CJoe The Lion\u201D on his \u2018Heroes\u2019 album, David\
    \ Bowie tells us that \u201CYou can buy God\u201D. I had always thought he was\
    \ spouting twaddle, and pernicious twaddle at that, until I saw, in a New York\
    \ shop window, the baby Jesus for sale, with a price tag tied to his elbow. Alas,\
    \ the shop was shut, and I was unable to make purchase.\n"
