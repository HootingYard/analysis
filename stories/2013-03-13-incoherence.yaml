  text: "Damp bag, hot talc. Flimflam of the highest order. Cutthroats aboard ship,\
    \ the ship of state, flying under a false flag, a flag of convenience, registered\
    \ in a distant port. Pettigrew snarled. Melville writes somewhere of \u201Cinhuman\
    \ hooting\u201D. A prize for the first to find out where. I already know, because\
    \ I read the words this morning, by dawn's early light, or by candlelight, or\
    \ both, or neither, squinting at the small print.\nDoes Peter Quint ever squint,\
    \ in The Turn Of The Screw? I don't know. That was Henry James, of course, not\
    \ Herman Melville, both Americans, but only one of them ended his days in the\
    \ grip of mad delusions. Or perhaps they both did.\nBoth did. Both did. If you\
    \ say it aloud, over and over again, its meaning becomes lost, it becomes a kind\
    \ of atavistic chant, to be chanted while leaping and capering around a bonfire\
    \ in a night swarming with demons, in a forest clearing, your body painted with\
    \ woad.\nBoth did, both did. It could be the name of a god, but what sort of god?\
    \ The god of bees, the god of herons. Perhaps, at a pinch, the otter god. I can\
    \ well imagine, if daubed in woad, shrieking a prayer to Both Did the otter god,\
    \ by the light of a bonfire in a forest clearing, waving a tally stick, thousands\
    \ of years ago. Thousands and thousands. Or just last week. But if last week,\
    \ the kind of thing you might get arrested for these days.\nImagine the interrogation,\
    \ in the cold bare room of the police station. You would have to explain yourself\
    \ to win your freedom. Otherwise they might lock you up, judging you as mad as\
    \ the aged Henry James. I think Herman Melville's wife, at some point, was under\
    \ pressure to have her husband declared insane. She refused.\n\u201CHis wife refused\u201D\
    . The title of a piece from David Byrne's score for The Catherine Wheel. Choreographed,\
    \ as I recall, by Twyla Tharp. Now there is a woman who lends herself to anagranmatization.\
    \ Especially in Welsh. And while we are on the subject of Welsh, however fugitively,\
    \ is it not splendid that the Welsh language word for a microwave oven is a popty-ping?\
    \ That, at least, is the claim made by Roger Lewis, in one of his newspaper articles.\n\
    It has ever been a wonder to me that I am not employed by a newspaper to write\
    \ a column. I could bash out a few hundred words on any subject required. Prongs,\
    \ tines, and nozzles would be three examples of topics I could blather about.\
    \ Not to mention damp bags and hot talc, with which we began, if you remember.\
    \ But what of damp talc and hot bags? What then, what then?\nI used to know a\
    \ couple whose idea of sightseeing, when on holiday, was to gaze into the windows\
    \ of butcher's shops, appraising the meat on display. What curious behaviour.\
    \ I recall that I was both amused and a little disgusted, not a common combination\
    \ of emotions. I think there may, too, have been an admixture of contempt.\nContempt.\
    \ Le m\xE9pris, in French, and the title of a 1963 film by Jean-Luc Godard. I\
    \ have seen it twice, both times on television, both times long ago, and all I\
    \ remember of it is a shot\u2014or shots\u2014of an impossibly blue sea, the bluest\
    \ sea I have ever seen in cinema. I think the film is considered a masterpiece.\
    \ But then there is a certain type of film buff who will forever wax preposterous\
    \ about Godard.\nThe auteur Godard and the otter-god. Now there is a pairing,\
    \ almost homonymic, a pairing that lends itself, as Twyla Tharp does to anagrams,\
    \ to the method outlined by Raymond Roussel in How I Wrote Certain Of My Books.\
    \ I could write a piece about a wholly imaginary Godard film, one in which the\
    \ blue, blue sea is reflected, blue-dazzlingly, in the glass window of a butcher's\
    \ shop. The film could begin with a quotation from Herman Melville and end with\
    \ one from Henry James. And in between? In between, for roughly ninety minutes?\
    \ I have no idea, for as I explained to a French art critic in New York only the\
    \ other day, I do not have a visual imagination. That is why I work with words."
