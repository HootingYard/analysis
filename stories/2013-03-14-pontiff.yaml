  \ Mnemonic. Before I wrestle with the most appropriate F word, however, I think\
  \ I am right in saying that there could be no more Hooting Yardy Pontiff than a\
  \ one-lunged Jesuit bus passenger.\n\nUPDATE\_: I managed to pluck from the dictionary\
  \ the definitive F word to add to the Pontiff Mnemonic just in time for today's\
  \ episode of Hooting Yard On The Air on ResonanceFM. You can find out what the word\
  \ is by listening to the show, archived on soundcloud here."
