  text: 'The time has come for me to update the enormously useful Hooting Yard Pontiff
    Mnemonic. Before I wrestle with the most appropriate F word, however, I think
    I am right in saying that there could be no more Hooting Yardy Pontiff than a
    one-lunged Jesuit bus passenger.


    UPDATE : I managed to pluck from the dictionary the definitive F word to add to
    the Pontiff Mnemonic just in time for today''s episode of Hooting Yard On The
    Air on ResonanceFM. You can find out what the word is by listening to the show,
    archived on soundcloud here.'
