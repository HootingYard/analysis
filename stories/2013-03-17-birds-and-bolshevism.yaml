  text: 'I am indebted to Ruth Bosch for drawing to my attention this photograph from
    Paraphilia Magazine, captioned "Russian children taking part in a parade celebrating
    birds helpful to farming, 1934". It is instructive to realise that Soviet Communism
    was not an unalloyed disaster, at least in ornithological terms. Needless to say,
    I am agog to learn precisely which birds were deemed "helpful to farming". Skylarks?
    Peewits? Pratincoles? Any readers equally expert in birds and Bolshevism should
    contact me immediately.
