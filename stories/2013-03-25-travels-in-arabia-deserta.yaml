  text: "One of Dobson's more preposterous follies was his attempt to rewrite Charles\
    \ Montagu Doughty's mad, massive classic Travels In Arabia Deserta (1888).\n\"\
    What do you mean, 'rewrite' it?\" asked Marigold Chew, when the out of print pamphleteer\
    \ announced his plan to his inamorata over breakfast one rainswept March morning.\n\
    \"I mean,\" spluttered Dobson, choking on a mouthful of goosefat toastie, \"That\
    \ I will enter Doughty's head, as it were, see what he saw, hear what he heard,\
    \ smell the very same fumes his nostrils smelled, and from those sensual prods\
    \ I shall weave a spell of words to create a new and improved Travels In Arabia\
    \ Deserta, no less mad, no less massive, but better, grander, more true.\"\n*It\
    \ is an intriguing, if foolish, idea,\" said Marigold Chew, \"But I wonder if\
    \ you have thought it through. You will know, from Doughty's book, if not from\
    \ other sources, that the desert is a vast and pitiless place of burning heat\
    \ upon which the sun beats down relentlessly. You, meanwhile, are a man whose\
    \ hatred of bright sunlight--and hatred is not too strong a word--has often led\
    \ me to think you have the constitution of a vampire. You are a man who thrives\
    \ under overcast skies and in drizzle, Dobson, not a sun-worshipper.\"\n\"Two\
    \ points,\" replied Dobson, swallowing a forkful of shredded radish, \"First,\
    \ I have not actually read Doughty's book. Oh, I have skimmed it here and there,\
    \ gained a feel for its strange and highly-wrought prose, weighed its mad mass\
    \ in my hands, but I could not claim to be familiar with every last nook and cranny\
    \ of the text. Second, I do not intend actually to travel in the burning sands\
    \ of the hellish sun-bashed desert. If you listened carefully, you will have heard\
    \ me say that my plan is to enter into Doughty's head, from the comfort of my\
    \ escritoire, and to summon forth the new Dobsonized Travels In Arabia Deserta\
    \ through the majestic powers of imagination alone!\"\n\"And you will enter his\
    \ head how?\" asked Marigold Chew.\n\"I snipped from a periodical a photograph\
    \ of the Doughty head,\" said Dobson, \"And I have affixed it to the wall by my\
    \ escritoire with a drawing pin. As soon as I am done with breakfast, I shall\
    \ sit and gaze at the picture, in awed concentration, and as I gaze, slowly but\
    \ surely the lineaments and integuments of the Doughty brain will become fused\
    \ with my own brain, and swimming before my eyes shall come wondrous mirages.\
    \ Mirages, after all, are the stuff of travels in Arabia Deserta, are they not?\
    \ And then I will take up my propelling pencil and scribble down, in impassioned\
    \ prose, all I see, all I hear, all I smell, while thus entranced. My plan is\
    \ sound,\" he concluded, \"And I shall give birth to a masterpiece!\"\nMarigold\
    \ Chew drained her beaker of milk slops and turned her head to look out of the\
    \ window at the downpour.\n\n\nIt was still raining later in the afternoon when\
    \ Dobson returned from a trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal. He\
    \ came crashing through the door, sopping wet, leaving a trail of puddles in his\
    \ wake. Marigold Chew eyed him carefully.\n\"Who is this come a-crashing through\
    \ the door?\" she asked, \"Is it Dobson or Doughty, or some zany minglement of\
    \ both Dobson and Doughty?\"\nBy way of reply, the pamphleteer merely grunted.\n\
    \"You are sopping wet and leaving a trail of puddles in your wake,\" said Marigold\
    \ Chew, \"Nobody could look less like they had been travelling in Arabia Deserta.\
    \ I'll put the kettle on.\"\nAs she went to the kitchen sink, Marigold Chew saw,\
    \ in the waste bin, the snipped-out photograph of Charles Montagu Doughty's head,\
    \ torn in half and scrunched up, the hole pierced by Dobson's drawing pin visible\
    \ in the centre of the Doughty forehead.\n\n\"How are you getting on with your\
    \ visionary rewriting?\" asked Marigold Chew that evening, as she and Dobson sprawled\
    \ on the sofa. From the Dansette on the sideboard came the finger-tapping hoo-cha\
    \ of Xavier Cugat and His Orchestra.\n\"I may have to rethink my plan,\" said\
    \ Dobson.\n\"Oh?\"\n\"I gazed and gazed at Doughty's head for hours,\" said the\
    \ pamphleteer, \"But only one mirage, or vision, came swimming into my head. I\
    \ could neither replace it nor dislodge it. There is not enough material there\
    \ for a mad and massive book in two volumes, which was what I hoped to be able\
    \ to wreak from the wild imaginings boiling in my doubled Dobson-Doughty brain.\
    \ Instead, I shall have to make do with a recipe book. Or rather, a recipe pamphlet,\
    \ for I have but the one recipe. That was my mirage.\"\n\"Well, people are always\
    \ on the lookout for an exotic recipe, Dobson,\" said Marigold Chew, \"Get it\
    \ scribbled down and I shall have it typeset in the morning on the Gestetner machine\
    \ in the shed.\"\n\nWhole Stuffed Camel\nIngredients\n  1 whole camel, medium\
    \ size\n  1 whole lamb, large size\n  20 whole chickens, medium size\n  60 eggs\n\
    \  12 kg rice\n  2 kg pine nuts\n  2 kg almonds\n  1 kg pistachio nuts\n  110\
    \ gallons water\n  5 lbs black pepper\n    salt\nMethod\n[My thanks to James Beckett\
    \ for drawing to my attention this splendid--and genuine--recipe.]"
