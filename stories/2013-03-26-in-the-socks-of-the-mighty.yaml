  text: '"Behold the socks of the mighty!"

    These were the words I heard declaimed in my dreams, in the moment before waking
    on a windy winter''s morn. It was later, as I was scoffing breakfast (eggs, plus
    a surfeit of lampreys), that I realised their significance. I slapped my forehead
    and went to retrieve, from the cupboard under the sink, my battered tin crown.
    The time had come to stake my claim to the Iron Throne. I would reign o''er the
    Seven Kingdoms of Westeros!

    First of all, of course, I would have to eliminate all the other pretenders to
    the Throne, of whom there were many. Oh!, many, so many, I had not thought death
    had undone so many. But for all the corpses piled up along the pathway to the
    Throne, there yet remained innumerable claimants who were very much alive, alive
    and in brutish good health, and heavily armed, and of psychotic temperament. If
    I was going to take my rightful place sitting on that Throne, with my bauble and
    sceptre, I was going to have my work cut out.

    What I needed was a troop of minions. The presence of minions lends a kingly air
    even to the weediest of Throne-claimants. Straight after breakfast, then, I popped
    to the newsagent''s to pick up the latest issue of the directory or register or
    whatever it is, that invaluable publication which lists, in alphabetical order,
    with contact details, and accompanied by skilful line-drawings with much cross-hatching
    done in a spidery pen, all minions currently available for hire. Sitting on a
    municipal park bench, buffeted by the wild winds, I leafed through the lists and
    plumped for the Minions Of The Pointy Sticks. Alas, on closer inspection, this
    turned out to be "a knitting group composed of some wild and crazy folks". The
    last thing you want in a minion is wildness or craziness. Rather, what you are
    looking for is slavish devotion, slobbering, and a propensity for violence. Being
    armed with a pointy stick is a definite advantage, which is why I had been initially
    attracted to the knitting group. In the event, I picked some other minions from
    the directory, and gave them, as their first task, the foraging from forests of
    sticks, and the sharpening of those sticks, until they were pointy.

    I accomplished all this while still sitting on the park bench. The wind, as I
    said, was wild. Wild was the wind, and I heard the sound of mandolins. The sound
    grew louder, and I realised that, across the park, on the other side of a swan-mad
    lake, came the approaching forces of a pretender to the Iron Throne. It may have
    been Stannis Baratheon, or possibly Balon Greyjoy. Whichever one it was, his army
    was strumming frantically at mandolins, playing, I think, "Listen, The Snow Is
    Falling" by Yoko Ono, which I recognised as the B-side of "Happy Xmas (War Is
    Over)", recorded with that Beatle she married.

    "Ha!", I thought to myself, or rather spoke aloud, in a kingly way, knowing my
    minions would hang on my every word, whether it made any sense or not, "This puny
    pretender''s army sings of the snow falling. Windy it may be, and wild may be
    that wind, but snowfall there is not, not here. As any fule kno, snow falls far
    north of here, by the Wall. Clearly the army is geographically obtuse and disorientated.
    They will be easy prey, particularly as they are armed only with stringed instruments."

    And then I issued a command to my minions, ordering them to rush at the pretender''s
    nincompoop army, and poke at them with their newly-sharpened pointy sticks. Thus
    was the scene set for what history books would call the Battle of Blister Lane
    Municipal Park. We routed the enemy, and I was one step closer to the Iron Throne.
    It was time for lunch.

    I headed off to a nearby stable, tore the heart out of a living horse, and gobbled
    it down while it was throbbing and hot and bloody. Unfortunately there were no
    barbaric Dothraki present to witness this gustatory feat. We are not all as media-savvy
    as the Khaleesi, who had the cameras present during her own horse-heart-eating
    lunch scene. But I was not troubled by her, far away in the Red Wastes with her
    grunting savages and baby dragons. Other claimants to the Throne had to be dealt
    with first, not least Robb Stark.

    It was at this point I realised the knitting group could be of use to me after
    all. Who would dare to stop me, I reasoned, if I came bashing upon the city gates
    of King''s Landing wearing a pair of socks emblazoned with a knitted motif of
    the Black Bat of Harrenhal? Truly, so attired, would I walk in the socks of the
    mighty!

    So cheered was I by this thought that I took my minions to the tavern for some
    celebratory carousing. It was only mid-afternoon, but they had acquitted themselves
    well, and were deserving of reward. Little did I know that, shortly before we
    fetched up at that snug rustic hostelry, the Unreconstructed Stalinist, creeping
    away from it in his asp-like way was Petyr Baelish, the Lanisters'' Machiavel.
    He had dripped poison into the ear of the taverner, and the taverner in turn dripped
    poison into our flagons of grog!

    By teatime, my minions lay sprawled in the sawdust dead and dying, and I myself
    was so sick I could barely bring myself to scoff a second horse-heart for dinner.
    But I forced it down, and set off alone for the castle wherein the Minions Of
    The Pointy Sticks did their knitting. But in my weakened state, I became hopelessly
    lost. Lost, too, is my memory of what happened. All I can remember (I remember)
    is standing by the Wall. The guns shot above our heads, and we kissed as though
    nothing could fall (nothing could fall). Who was I kissing? Why, a Minion Of The
    Pointy Sticks, a knitwoman who had rescued me from a ditch somewhere along the
    way, and had brought me to the Wall.

    And it is here at the Wall I have stayed. I no longer stake my claim to the Iron
    Throne. I am happy here, fighting off wolves and wildlings, listening to the falling
    snow, while my knitwoman, the Minion Of The Pointy Sticks, knits me sock after
    sock after sock after sock, each emblazoned with a motif of the Black Bat of Harrenhal.
    I am no king, but I trudge through snowdeep in the socks of the mighty!'
