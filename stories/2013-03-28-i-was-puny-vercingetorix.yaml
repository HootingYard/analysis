    thought it would be a good idea to repost this, from 2009:

    I Was Puny Vercingetorix : a novel by Lars Talc (2003) is not a novel and it is
    not by Lars Talc. It is not a book at all. It is an objet d''art.


    In the words of art critic Cosmo Hoxtonwanker, "it is a bold, transgressive, edgy
    work, interrogating notions of authenticity, desire, and jouissance while incorporating
    both dippiness and a Playmobil figure holding a vacuum cleaner under some streamers.
    If it was for sale, I would pay millions for it."


    It is not for sale.
