    \ yet continue\u2014I thought it would be a good idea to repost this, from 2009:\n\
    I Was Puny Vercingetorix\_: a novel by Lars Talc (2003) is not a novel and it\
    \ is not by Lars Talc. It is not a book at all. It is an objet d'art.\n\nIn the\
    \ words of art critic Cosmo Hoxtonwanker, \u201Cit is a bold, transgressive, edgy\
    \ work, interrogating notions of authenticity, desire, and jouissance while incorporating\
    \ both dippiness and a Playmobil figure holding a vacuum cleaner under some streamers.\
    \ If it was for sale, I would pay millions for it.\u201D\n\nIt is not for sale.\n"
