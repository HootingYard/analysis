    Over in my cupboard at The Dabbler today I try, as best I can, to come to terms
    with the most seismic event in our national life for centuries. I am not ashamed
    to admit that I wept, wept I tell you!, and copious were my tears, and salty were
    they too, at the self-willed downfall of perhaps the one true political colossus
    of the past five hundred years.

    On the other hand, it might be that, with The Miliband Resignation, I was trying
    my hand at devising a convincing Robert Ludlum-style title, in preparation for
    a forthcoming cinema franchise. But who would star as David Miliband?'
