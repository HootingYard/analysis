  text: 'I am afraid the Key head is an entirely empty thing at the moment. So here,
    to keep you entertained, is a piece that appeared nine years ago today, on 3 April
    2004, though it was written--and published as a pamphlet--long long ago in the
    last decade of the previous century. It is entitled Sidney The Bat Is Awarded
    The Order Of Lenin.

    Like many bats, Sidney spent much of his time hanging upside down in a dark, damp
    cave. Both of his parents were still alive, and on Saturdays he would visit them.
    They lived in the attic of a museum, and enjoyed swooping, wings aflutter, around
    the heads of any museum employees who came up to the attic, which was used as
    a clutter-strewn storage area. The museum housed collections of electromagnetic
    apparatus, galvanometers, and cast iron mesmeric engines. It was the most renowned
    museum of its kind in the land, numbering among its exhibits not only Von Ick''s
    Patent Trance Mechanism but also an archive of papers from the laboratory of the
    great celery scientist Kapisko.

    Professor Maud Dweb was the chief curator. Her in-tray was piled high with complaints
    about the bats in the attic. One young assistant janitor, on his first ever visit
    up there, had been literally frightened out of his wits. He had been removed to
    a sanatorium in remote mountainous country, and his family, despite most of them
    being brain-addled, had made known their intentions to prosecute the museum. One
    of the land''s most relentless lawyers had been paid a retainer. Professor Dweb
    decided to act.

    One Saturday evening, after the museum had closed, when soon the full moon [would]
    swim up over the edge of the world and hang like a great golden cheese (in the
    words attributed to the shade of Oscar Wilde by the spirit medium Hester Travers
    Smith), the curator ascended the staircase to the gloomy attic. It was the work
    of minutes to set a number of bat-traps in the darkness. As she made to leave,
    Professor Dweb stumbled over a crate containing the world''s only surviving example
    of Bickering''s Superb New Hinge, banged her head on the wall, and dropped to
    the floor, unconscious. Sidney''s parents swooped low, and perched--do bats perch?--on
    her back.

    At that very moment, Sidney flapped in through the skylight. He and his parents
    exchanged greetings, in bat-language. They told him what had happened to Professor
    Dweb, who was sinking into a catatonic stupor. Sidney was most disappointed, for
    he could not see any fun in flapping around someone who was unconscious. She wouldn''t
    be scared at all! He resolved to arouse the curator, and at once began to make
    hideous bat-like squealing noises directly into her ear, flicking his wings against
    her temples. It took some time, but eventually Maud Dweb woke with a start. Then
    she screeched, flailing her arms at the mischievous bat. She fled the attic, slamming
    the trap-door behind her, leaving the fiendish bat-traps to do their work.

    An hour later she was back in the attic, armed with a torch. She found Sidney
    hanging upside down from the rafters. "Well, young bat," she announced, "Inadvertently,
    you have performed a great service to your country! Had you not woken me from
    my stupor, thieves would have made off with the museum''s most prized exhibit!
    I was only just in time to nab them! Fleeing from you, I went downstairs to find
    a pair of counter-revolutionary ne''er-do-wells about to make off with Darjeeling''s
    Anti-Imperialist Galvanising Motor! You are--as a mere bat--probably unaware that
    this machine is a potent symbol of our glorious revolution. I shall recommend
    to the General Secretary of the Party that you are given an award in recognition
    of your deed. Well done!"

    Sidney''s parents patted him proudly on his bat-head. Professor Dweb dismantled
    the bat-traps. The full moon shimmered through the skylight.'
