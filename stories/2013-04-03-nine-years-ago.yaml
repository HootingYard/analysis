  text: "I am afraid the Key head is an entirely empty thing at the moment. So here,\
    \ to keep you entertained, is a piece that appeared nine years ago today, on 3\
    \ April 2004, though it was written\u2014and published as a pamphlet\u2014long\
    \ long ago in the last decade of the previous century. It is entitled Sidney The\
    \ Bat Is Awarded The Order Of Lenin.\nLike many bats, Sidney spent much of his\
    \ time hanging upside down in a dark, damp cave. Both of his parents were still\
    \ alive, and on Saturdays he would visit them. They lived in the attic of a museum,\
    \ and enjoyed swooping, wings aflutter, around the heads of any museum employees\
    \ who came up to the attic, which was used as a clutter-strewn storage area. The\
    \ museum housed collections of electromagnetic apparatus, galvanometers, and cast\
    \ iron mesmeric engines. It was the most renowned museum of its kind in the land,\
    \ numbering among its exhibits not only Von Ick's Patent Trance Mechanism but\
    \ also an archive of papers from the laboratory of the great celery scientist\
    \ Kapisko.\n\nFigure 1\_: One of the museum exhibits\nProfessor Maud Dweb was\
    \ the chief curator. Her in-tray was piled high with complaints about the bats\
    \ in the attic. One young assistant janitor, on his first ever visit up there,\
    \ had been literally frightened out of his wits. He had been removed to a sanatorium\
    \ in remote mountainous country, and his family, despite most of them being brain-addled,\
    \ had made known their intentions to prosecute the museum. One of the land's most\
    \ relentless lawyers had been paid a retainer. Professor Dweb decided to act.\n\
    One Saturday evening, after the museum had closed, when soon the full moon [would]\
    \ swim up over the edge of the world and hang like a great golden cheese (in the\
    \ words attributed to the shade of Oscar Wilde by the spirit medium Hester Travers\
    \ Smith), the curator ascended the staircase to the gloomy attic. It was the work\
    \ of minutes to set a number of bat-traps in the darkness. As she made to leave,\
    \ Professor Dweb stumbled over a crate containing the world's only surviving example\
    \ of Bickering's Superb New Hinge, banged her head on the wall, and dropped to\
    \ the floor, unconscious. Sidney's parents swooped low, and perched\u2014do bats\
    \ perch?\u2014on her back.\n\nFigure 2\_: Diagram of the attic\nAt that very moment,\
    \ Sidney flapped in through the skylight. He and his parents exchanged greetings,\
    \ in bat-language. They told him what had happened to Professor Dweb, who was\
    \ sinking into a catatonic stupor. Sidney was most disappointed, for he could\
    \ not see any fun in flapping around someone who was unconscious. She wouldn't\
    \ be scared at all! He resolved to arouse the curator, and at once began to make\
    \ hideous bat-like squealing noises directly into her ear, flicking his wings\
    \ against her temples. It took some time, but eventually Maud Dweb woke with a\
    \ start. Then she screeched, flailing her arms at the mischievous bat. She fled\
    \ the attic, slamming the trap-door behind her, leaving the fiendish bat-traps\
    \ to do their work.\nAn hour later she was back in the attic, armed with a torch.\
    \ She found Sidney hanging upside down from the rafters. \u201CWell, young bat,\u201D\
    \ she announced, \u201CInadvertently, you have performed a great service to your\
    \ country! Had you not woken me from my stupor, thieves would have made off with\
    \ the museum's most prized exhibit! I was only just in time to nab them! Fleeing\
    \ from you, I went downstairs to find a pair of counter-revolutionary ne'er-do-wells\
    \ about to make off with Darjeeling's Anti-Imperialist Galvanising Motor! You\
    \ are\u2014as a mere bat\u2014probably unaware that this machine is a potent symbol\
    \ of our glorious revolution. I shall recommend to the General Secretary of the\
    \ Party that you are given an award in recognition of your deed. Well done!\u201D\
    \n\nFigure 3\_: Counter-revolutionary ne'er-do-wells\nSidney's parents patted\
    \ him proudly on his bat-head. Professor Dweb dismantled the bat-traps. The full\
    \ moon shimmered through the skylight."
