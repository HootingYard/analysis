  text: "Like so many of Isaac's attempts to apply his imaginative vision to life,\
    \ this orgone box was compromised by his poverty and his many interests. It was\
    \ too obviously a homemade, bargain-basement orgone box. It looked more like a\
    \ cardboard closet or stage telephone booth than it did a scientific apparatus\
    \ by which to recover the sexual energy one had lost to \u201Cculture\u201D. Isaac's\
    \ orgone box stood up in the midst of an enormous confusion of bed clothes, review\
    \ copies, manuscripts, children, and the many people who went in and out of the\
    \ room as if it were the bathroom. Belligerently sitting inside his orgone box,\
    \ daring philistines to laugh, Isaac nevertheless looked lost, as if he were waiting\
    \ in his telephone booth for a call that was not coming through.\nAlfred Kazin\
    \ on Isaac Rosenfeld, quoted in Adventures In The Orgasmatron\_: Wilhelm Reich\
    \ And The Invention Of Sex by Christopher Turner (2011)\n"
