  text: 'Like so many of Isaac''s attempts to apply his imaginative vision to life,
    this orgone box was compromised by his poverty and his many interests. It was
    too obviously a homemade, bargain-basement orgone box. It looked more like a cardboard
    closet or stage telephone booth than it did a scientific apparatus by which to
    recover the sexual energy one had lost to "culture". Isaac''s orgone box stood
    up in the midst of an enormous confusion of bed clothes, review copies, manuscripts,
    children, and the many people who went in and out of the room as if it were the
    bathroom. Belligerently sitting inside his orgone box, daring philistines to laugh,
    Isaac nevertheless looked lost, as if he were waiting in his telephone booth for
    a call that was not coming through.

    Alfred Kazin on Isaac Rosenfeld, quoted in Adventures In The Orgasmatron : Wilhelm
    Reich And The Invention Of Sex by Christopher Turner (2011)
