  text: 'Things have been pretty quiet here at Hooting Yard, and they are going to
    be even quieter over the next few days as I head off for another jaunt in the
    cause of art. This will probably be the last one, at least for the foreseeable
    future, so when I return early next week I shall resume my usual practice of hunkering
    down in my Diogenesian Barrel of Reclusion and sending forth sweeping paragraphs
    of majestic prose to an eager, panting populace..


    Meanwhile, over at The Dabbler, you can read a note on the death of Margaret Thatcher.'
