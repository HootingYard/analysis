  text: 'In spending the weekend just gone in Amsterdam, I was of course following
    in the footsteps of the twentieth century''s most illustrious out of print pamphleteer.
    But whereas I went to the Dutch capital in the cause of art, Dobson''s visit was
    occasioned by a challenge. Let me tell you all about it.

    It so happened that one wet and windy morning in the 1950s the pamphleteer was
    on his usual trudge along the towpath of the old canal, when a man sprang out
    at him from behind a splurge of cuckoopint. The man was rotund and diminutive
    and dressed all in green, with a little green pointy hat. He looked like a figure
    from a fairy tale, and though his name was not Rumpelstiltskin, it was similar,
    with the same number of syllables but a slightly different combination of vowels
    and consonants.

    Such was the suddenness of the strange little man''s springing that Dobson was
    disconcerted, and would have toppled over, sploshing into the canal, had he not
    had the presence of mind to deploy a Goon Fang technique he had recently mastered.
    In this exercise of the ancient mystic art, one is able to fix one''s feet to
    the ground, as if magnetically, for just long enough to avoid topplement. Dobson
    swayed slightly.

    "Drat and heaven''s hounds a-gubbins!" screeched the little fellow dressed in
    green, "You were meant to topple over into the canal with a splosh that would
    cause me much mirth!"

    "Then you are confounded!", shouted Dobson.

    "What I do," said the little man, "Is to present those who confound me with a
    challenge. I challenge you to go to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, a city with
    a magnificent network of seventeenth century canals, and I further challenge you
    to walk alongside each and every canal in Amsterdam, from end to end, on both
    banks, trudging along back and forth, and to complete the task without once toppling
    into one or other of the canals. Do you accept my challenge?"

    "I do," said Dobson immediately, without thinking. But he was not being unduly
    impetuous. He realised that a trip to Amsterdam could provide the opportunity
    for important research,

    "It so happens," he explained, "That I am currently at work on a pamphlet devoted
    to the study of mariners with an exclusively fish-based diet. I have heard that
    in the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet, there''s a sailor who eats
    only fish heads and tails, and he''ll show you his teeth that have rotted too
    soon, that can haul up the sails, that can swallow the moon. And he yells to the
    cook, with his arms open wide ''Hey, bring me more fish, throw it down by my side''
    and he wants so to belch, but he''s too full to try, so he stands up and laughs
    and he zips up his fly, in the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam. I
    would like to meet that sailor, and interrogate him on his diet."

    "I have often wondered," said the little man dressed all in green, "If the port
    of Amsterdam is the port to which Emily Dickinson was referring in that magnificently
    sensual poem ''Wild Nights!'', where she writes Futile--the winds--To a Heart
    in port--Done with the Compass--Done with the Chart!"

    "Perhaps that is something else I can research while I am there," said Dobson.

    The little man chuckled horribly.

    "You will be too busy wringing out your clothing, sopping wet from repeated topplings
    into one canal after another," he said.

    "We shall see," said the pamphleteer.

    "Meet me again by this splurge of cuckoopint in a week''s time," said the little
    man, "While you are in Amsterdam I am going to sit in my Reichian orgone accumulator
    and recite ''Wild Nights!'' over and over again. So impassioned is the poem that
    I hardly dare think to what explosive pitch the orgone energy levels will rise!"

    It was Dobson''s turn to laugh.

    "Reichian methods would not stop me from toppling into the many canals of the
    port of Amsterdam," he said, "But I have mastered the magnetic bootsole technique
    of Goon Fang, and will practise it with great assiduousness!"

    A week later, on a wet and windy morning, Dobson returned to the splurge of cuckoopint
    on the towpath of the old canal. But of the strange little man dressed all in
    green there was no sign. It was not until many weeks had passed that the pamphleteer
    learned, from an article in The Emily Dickinson Orgone Energy Digest (Vol XXI,
    No. 9) that a lethal concentration of what Wilhelm Reich called DOR, or "deadly
    orgone", had caused a massive explosion in the vicinity of the canal, at precisely
    the time Dobson was in Amsterdam.

    Although he never completed his work on mariners with exclusive fish diets, Dobson
    did write a pamphlet entitled On Not Toppling Into Any Of The Many Canals Of Amsterdam
    (out of print).

    In spite of my mastery of Goon Fang, he wrote, I took the extra precaution of
    smearing the soles of my Ruritanian Bellringer''s boots with an extremely viscous
    substance composed of glue and egg yolk and sand and gum and gunk and goo and
    powerful magnets, retailed under the trade name Gosh! It''s Very Sticky! (r).
    This proved a boon, for though no funny little men dressed all in green with green
    pointy hats sprang out at me as I trudged alongside each and every canal in Amsterdam,
    I was not prepared for the dazzling number of Dutch cyclists whizzing at high
    speed along those very same paths. I would certainly have toppled into canal after
    canal after canal had my boots not been riveted to the ground.

    I count myself fortunate that I had read a rare copy of this pamphlet before my
    own weekend in Amsterdam. Had I not, I feel sure I too, surprised by cyclists,
    would have toppled into many canals, and returned home sopping wet. It just goes
    to show how valuable it can be to gain a familiarity with Dobson''s more obscure
    works.

    I did not, incidentally, seek out the sailor who eats only fish heads and tails.
    Perhaps I should have.'
