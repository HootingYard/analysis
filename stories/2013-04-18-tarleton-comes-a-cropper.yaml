  text: 'And then, as we know, there came the time when Tarleton, the amateur''s amateur,
    came a-cropper. He was in pursuit of a shifty pastry hawker, a man with a barrow,
    known to galumph along ill-lit lanes. Tarleton carried a torch, sweeping its bright
    beam ahead of him, both to avoid pits and puddles and in hope that he might catch
    a glimpse of his quarry. But, as the old saying has it, a torch in the hands of
    a nincompoop sheds no light.

    Incidentally, it is well worth your while to jot down old sayings in a notepad
    when you hear them. They can be invaluable in establishing rapport with countryside
    peasants. If you fall into conversation with such a person, you will discover
    that their utterances often consist of little else but old sayings strung together.
    By dropping in your own crumbs of rustic wisdom from time to time, you will be
    able to maintain conversational sparkle in otherwise trying circumstances. The
    beauty of it is, you do not need to grasp the actual meaning of the old sayings
    you deploy.

    Consider, for example, the one we have just encountered, a torch in the hands
    of a nincompoop sheds no light. On the face of it, this would seem to make little
    or no sense, unless we presume the nincompoop has neglected to press the knob
    that lights the bulb of the torch he is carrying. But one must always avoid presumption,
    as we learned from Blotzmann (Third Notebook, Lavender Series). Say that saying
    to, say, a sophisticated urban person at a swish cocktail party, and you face
    a series of brusque questions demanding that you clarify what you are saying.
    Say the same words to a peasant in the countryside and as likely as not he will
    suck thoughtfully on his piece of straw and nod, before parrying with a saying
    of his own, such as You can''t milk a goat with a hammer.

    But wait wait wait! [These are the words erupting inside your head, dear reader.
    You see, I know you only too well.] Grateful as I am to be given tips on talking
    to peasants, tips I will no doubt make use of when next I go trudging through
    an area of rustic squalor, I cannot let pass the clear implication in your opening
    paragraph that Tarleton was a nincompoop. How can such things be? Tarleton, the
    amateur''s amateur. a nincompoop? Surely, sir, you are in jest!

    Let me answer that. It is true enough that few persons have ever trod this earth
    whose brains were as acute as Tarleton''s. Indeed, hold his brain in the palm
    of your hand and you would be astonished at its heft. It is worth noting, in this
    context, that you could, if you wished to, so hold Tarleton''s brain. It is kept
    preserved in jelly in a jar in a display case in the lobby of his alma mater,
    Miss Blossom Partridge''s Institute For The Education Of Frighteningly Adept Tinies.
    Make an appointment with the bursar, don a pair of gloves, and an attendant will
    open the display case and unscrew the lid from the jar and, with special tweezers,
    lift the brain from its protective jelly and allow you to hold it, registering
    its heft, for up to sixty seconds. The jar is clearly labelled with Tarleton''s
    name, so you will not mistake it for the brains of other alumni in other jellies
    in other jars in other display cases in the same lobby.

    Now, as true as it is that Tarleton was no dimwit, it is equally true that nincompoopery
    is to be found in the most unexpected places. Here we might recall another apercu
    of Blotzmann''s, from the Fifth Notebook, Lilac Series. No man is all nincompoop,
    he observed, but all men have an inner nincompoop ever ready to emerge and flourish.
    Blotzmann compares this inner nincompoop to a mayfly, in a passage I recommend
    to your attention. His point is that even the most dazzlingly sensible and spectacular
    minds may, from time to time, and ephemerally, exhibit the sure signs of nincompoopery.
    This is what, I argue, happened with Tarleton as he stumbled down an ill-lit lane
    in pursuit of the shifty pastry hawker.

    It was night, a black night, moonless and starless on account of a great shroud
    of cloud. The first incipient sign of Tarleton''s inner nincompoop was that he
    did not wait until sunrise to go prowling after his quarry. Even the swiftest
    of shifty pastry hawkers cannot cover too much ground, trundling a barrow, in
    the hours between dusk and dawn. And though the lane would still be ill-lit, in
    the daylight, shaded as it was on either side by towering pines and titanic cedars,
    yet there would be light enough for a man of Tarleton''s piercing vision. Not
    so on this night, this black unholy night.

    Unholy, I say, because it was the one night in the calendar year when imps and
    goblins are let loose from their fetters and are free to dash about, all mischief
    and havoc and mayhem. On this night churns are upended, wells poisoned, cows turned
    inside out. That, at least, is what the peasants believe. It is what they will
    tell you, in the form of old sayings, if you are willing to listen. The wise man
    stays abed on St Spivack''s night, they will say, or When Spivack''s Night comes
    round again, burn a dolly and slaughter a hen.

    For all the startling heft of his brain, Tarleton, the amateur''s amateur, did
    not heed such warnings. In fact he dismissed the peasants'' old sayings as nonsensical
    babble. This was his undoing. This was his nincompoopery. And so he went a-stumbling
    along an ill-lit lane in the night, sweeping the beam of his torch ahead of him.
    What was he to do when, of a sudden, a goblin came swooping down and gobbled up
    the light and swallowed it and then belched it out in the form of thick black
    poison fumes?

    Poor Tarleton was terrified, and in his terror he turned on his heel and ran from
    the goblin, but he made only a half turn, so no sooner did he begin to flee than
    he crashed into a towering pine, or a titanic cedar, and came a -cropper, and
    the bash given to his head dislodged his brain within its cranium, and he fell
    to the ground, and knew no more.

    He might have been dead. The peasant who found him, at daybreak, thought him so,
    and being a gravedigging peasant, he hoisted his spade from over his shoulder
    and began to dig a pit in which to chuck the body. He whistled as he dug, an ancient
    rustic tune, and it was the sounds of his whistling and of his digging that woke
    Tarleton from his stupor. He rubbed his bonce, but remembered nothing of what
    had happened during the black unholy night. He did not even remember that he had
    been pursuing a shifty pastry hawker.

    "Where am I?" he asked, in an uncharacteristically weedy and quavering voice,
    "What place is this? What day is it? Why are you digging a pit?"

    The peasant did not reply. He was an obtuse peasant, and a peasant with a stubborn
    sense of purpose. Having begun to dig a grave by the side of the lane in the shade
    of towering pines and titanic cedars, nothing would stop him until he had shoved
    the body six feet under and covered it over with earth. And here was a second
    instance of Tarleton''s nincompoopery. Close observation of the peasant''s countenance,
    of the grim determination of his digging, might have persuaded Tarleton to get
    to his feet and run, run away as fast as he could. But he sat up, and lit his
    pipe, and listened to birdsong, and he was still sitting and smoking and listening
    when the peasant, his digging done, threw down his spade and turned and picked
    up Tarleton in one huge hairy hand by the scruff of his neck and chucked him into
    the pit and retrieved his spade and began to shovel spadeful after spadeful of
    soil and muck, rich with worms, over the amateur''s amateur, sprawled in the pit,
    and soon enough buried, never to be found..

    The peasant stamped his great boots on the grave, to smooth the ground and remove
    all trace of his digging, and then, whistling, he went on his way.

    Just one thing. If Tarleton was buried alive in an unmarked grave in an ill-lit
    lane in an area of rustic squalor, how is it that his brain was retrieved and
    stored in jelly in a jar in a display case in the lobby of Miss Blossom Partridge''s
    Institute For The Education Of Frighteningly Adept Tinies?

    Ah. I could tell you a thing or two about Miss Blossom Partridge, and certain
    members of staff at her Institute, that would curdle the blood in your veins.
    Things innocent ears should never hear. Remember the old saying, Ignorance is
    better by far When you see a brain in jelly in a jar.'
