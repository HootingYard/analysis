  text: "And then, as we know, there came the time when Tarleton, the amateur's amateur,\
    \ came a-cropper. He was in pursuit of a shifty pastry hawker, a man with a barrow,\
    \ known to galumph along ill-lit lanes. Tarleton carried a torch, sweeping its\
    \ bright beam ahead of him, both to avoid pits and puddles and in hope that he\
    \ might catch a glimpse of his quarry. But, as the old saying has it, a torch\
    \ in the hands of a nincompoop sheds no light.\nIncidentally, it is well worth\
    \ your while to jot down old sayings in a notepad when you hear them. They can\
    \ be invaluable in establishing rapport with countryside peasants. If you fall\
    \ into conversation with such a person, you will discover that their utterances\
    \ often consist of little else but old sayings strung together. By dropping in\
    \ your own crumbs of rustic wisdom from time to time, you will be able to maintain\
    \ conversational sparkle in otherwise trying circumstances. The beauty of it is,\
    \ you do not need to grasp the actual meaning of the old sayings you deploy.\n\
    Consider, for example, the one we have just encountered, a torch in the hands\
    \ of a nincompoop sheds no light. On the face of it, this would seem to make little\
    \ or no sense, unless we presume the nincompoop has neglected to press the knob\
    \ that lights the bulb of the torch he is carrying. But one must always avoid\
    \ presumption, as we learned from Bl\xF6tzmann (Third Notebook, Lavender Series).\
    \ Say that saying to, say, a sophisticated urban person at a swish cocktail party,\
    \ and you face a series of brusque questions demanding that you clarify what you\
    \ are saying. Say the same words to a peasant in the countryside and as likely\
    \ as not he will suck thoughtfully on his piece of straw and nod, before parrying\
    \ with a saying of his own, such as You can't milk a goat with a hammer.\nBut\
    \ wait wait wait! [These are the words erupting inside your head, dear reader.\
    \ You see, I know you only too well.] Grateful as I am to be given tips on talking\
    \ to peasants, tips I will no doubt make use of when next I go trudging through\
    \ an area of rustic squalor, I cannot let pass the clear implication in your opening\
    \ paragraph that Tarleton was a nincompoop. How can such things be? Tarleton,\
    \ the amateur's amateur. a nincompoop? Surely, sir, you are in jest!\nLet me answer\
    \ that. It is true enough that few persons have ever trod this earth whose brains\
    \ were as acute as Tarleton's. Indeed, hold his brain in the palm of your hand\
    \ and you would be astonished at its heft. It is worth noting, in this context,\
    \ that you could, if you wished to, so hold Tarleton's brain. It is kept preserved\
    \ in jelly in a jar in a display case in the lobby of his alma mater, Miss Blossom\
    \ Partridge's Institute For The Education Of Frighteningly Adept Tinies. Make\
    \ an appointment with the bursar, don a pair of gloves, and an attendant will\
    \ open the display case and unscrew the lid from the jar and, with special tweezers,\
    \ lift the brain from its protective jelly and allow you to hold it, registering\
    \ its heft, for up to sixty seconds. The jar is clearly labelled with Tarleton's\
    \ name, so you will not mistake it for the brains of other alumni in other jellies\
    \ in other jars in other display cases in the same lobby.\nNow, as true as it\
    \ is that Tarleton was no dimwit, it is equally true that nincompoopery is to\
    \ be found in the most unexpected places. Here we might recall another aper\xE7\
    u of Bl\xF6tzmann's, from the Fifth Notebook, Lilac Series. No man is all nincompoop,\
    \ he observed, but all men have an inner nincompoop ever ready to emerge and flourish.\
    \ Bl\xF6tzmann compares this inner nincompoop to a mayfly, in a passage I recommend\
    \ to your attention. His point is that even the most dazzlingly sensible and spectacular\
    \ minds may, from time to time, and ephemerally, exhibit the sure signs of nincompoopery.\
    \ This is what, I argue, happened with Tarleton as he stumbled down an ill-lit\
    \ lane in pursuit of the shifty pastry hawker.\nIt was night, a black night, moonless\
    \ and starless on account of a great shroud of cloud. The first incipient sign\
    \ of Tarleton's inner nincompoop was that he did not wait until sunrise to go\
    \ prowling after his quarry. Even the swiftest of shifty pastry hawkers cannot\
    \ cover too much ground, trundling a barrow, in the hours between dusk and dawn.\
    \ And though the lane would still be ill-lit, in the daylight, shaded as it was\
    \ on either side by towering pines and titanic cedars, yet there would be light\
    \ enough for a man of Tarleton's piercing vision. Not so on this night, this black\
    \ unholy night.\nUnholy, I say, because it was the one night in the calendar year\
    \ when imps and goblins are let loose from their fetters and are free to dash\
    \ about, all mischief and havoc and mayhem. On this night churns are upended,\
    \ wells poisoned, cows turned inside out. That, at least, is what the peasants\
    \ believe. It is what they will tell you, in the form of old sayings, if you are\
    \ willing to listen. The wise man stays abed on St Spivack's night, they will\
    \ say, or When Spivack's Night comes round again, burn a dolly and slaughter a\
    \ hen.\nFor all the startling heft of his brain, Tarleton, the amateur's amateur,\
    \ did not heed such warnings. In fact he dismissed the peasants\u2019 old sayings\
    \ as nonsensical babble. This was his undoing. This was his nincompoopery. And\
    \ so he went a-stumbling along an ill-lit lane in the night, sweeping the beam\
    \ of his torch ahead of him. What was he to do when, of a sudden, a goblin came\
    \ swooping down and gobbled up the light and swallowed it and then belched it\
    \ out in the form of thick black poison fumes?\nPoor Tarleton was terrified, and\
    \ in his terror he turned on his heel and ran from the goblin, but he made only\
    \ a half turn, so no sooner did he begin to flee than he crashed into a towering\
    \ pine, or a titanic cedar, and came a -cropper, and the bash given to his head\
    \ dislodged his brain within its cranium, and he fell to the ground, and knew\
    \ no more.\nHe might have been dead. The peasant who found him, at daybreak, thought\
    \ him so, and being a gravedigging peasant, he hoisted his spade from over his\
    \ shoulder and began to dig a pit in which to chuck the body. He whistled as he\
    \ dug, an ancient rustic tune, and it was the sounds of his whistling and of his\
    \ digging that woke Tarleton from his stupor. He rubbed his bonce, but remembered\
    \ nothing of what had happened during the black unholy night. He did not even\
    \ remember that he had been pursuing a shifty pastry hawker.\n\u201CWhere am I?\u201D\
    \ he asked, in an uncharacteristically weedy and quavering voice, \u201CWhat place\
    \ is this? What day is it? Why are you digging a pit?\u201D\nThe peasant did not\
    \ reply. He was an obtuse peasant, and a peasant with a stubborn sense of purpose.\
    \ Having begun to dig a grave by the side of the lane in the shade of towering\
    \ pines and titanic cedars, nothing would stop him until he had shoved the body\
    \ six feet under and covered it over with earth. And here was a second instance\
    \ of Tarleton's nincompoopery. Close observation of the peasant's countenance,\
    \ of the grim determination of his digging, might have persuaded Tarleton to get\
    \ to his feet and run, run away as fast as he could. But he sat up, and lit his\
    \ pipe, and listened to birdsong, and he was still sitting and smoking and listening\
    \ when the peasant, his digging done, threw down his spade and turned and picked\
    \ up Tarleton in one huge hairy hand by the scruff of his neck and chucked him\
    \ into the pit and retrieved his spade and began to shovel spadeful after spadeful\
    \ of soil and muck, rich with worms, over the amateur's amateur, sprawled in the\
    \ pit, and soon enough buried, never to be found..\nThe peasant stamped his great\
    \ boots on the grave, to smooth the ground and remove all trace of his digging,\
    \ and then, whistling, he went on his way.\nJust one thing. If Tarleton was buried\
    \ alive in an unmarked grave in an ill-lit lane in an area of rustic squalor,\
    \ how is it that his brain was retrieved and stored in jelly in a jar in a display\
    \ case in the lobby of Miss Blossom Partridge's Institute For The Education Of\
    \ Frighteningly Adept Tinies?\nAh. I could tell you a thing or two about Miss\
    \ Blossom Partridge, and certain members of staff at her Institute, that would\
    \ curdle the blood in your veins. Things innocent ears should never hear. Remember\
    \ the old saying, Ignorance is better by far When you see a brain in jelly in\
    \ a jar."
