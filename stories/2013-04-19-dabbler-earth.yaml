  text: "\nOver in my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, I am thrilled by the announcement\
    \ of \u201CIslamic Google Earth\u201D, and wonder what other parallel worlds may\
    \ be brought into existence. What I do not mention in the piece is Hooting Yard\
    \ Earth, an important new interweb-based initiative over which boffins are currently\
    \ slaving in their remote subterranean Alpine fastness. Details are sketchy, but\
    \ apparently they think they have nearly completed work on an app which will tell\
    \ you how to get from Sawdust Bridge to the Blister Lane Bypass without becoming\
    \ hopelessly entangled in one of those terrible thickets of poisonous nettles."
