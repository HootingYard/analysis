    Over in my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, I am thrilled by the announcement
    of "Islamic Google Earth", and wonder what other parallel worlds may be brought
    into existence. What I do not mention in the piece is Hooting Yard Earth, an important
    new interweb-based initiative over which boffins are currently slaving in their
    remote subterranean Alpine fastness. Details are sketchy, but apparently they
    think they have nearly completed work on an app which will tell you how to get
    from Sawdust Bridge to the Blister Lane Bypass without becoming hopelessly entangled
    in one of those terrible thickets of poisonous nettles.'
