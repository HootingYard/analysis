  text: 'Yesterday''s piece entitled Tungsten Grebe contained an unfortunate error
    which rendered it incomprehensible. As a consequence, the Hooting Yard Incoming
    Postage Logistics Silo was bombarded with untold thousands of letters from readers
    expressing bafflement, befuddlement, or, in some cases, utter indifference.

    I have now taken the opportunity to reread, rereread, and rerereread the text,
    scan it through a Blotzmannscope, subject it to the Pigwell-Faffington Test, and
    carry out several other procedures that you need not bother your ungainly little
    heads about.

    As a result of my labours, which I can assure you were Herculean, I am now able
    to announce that if you replace the words "tungsten grebe" with "zinc egret",
    all becomes clear. Well, if not exactly clear, then let us say less misty.'
