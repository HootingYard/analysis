  text: "Yesterday's piece entitled Tungsten Grebe contained an unfortunate error\
    \ which rendered it incomprehensible. As a consequence, the Hooting Yard Incoming\
    \ Postage Logistics Silo was bombarded with untold thousands of letters from readers\
    \ expressing bafflement, befuddlement, or, in some cases, utter indifference.\n\
    I have now taken the opportunity to reread, rereread, and rerereread the text,\
    \ scan it through a Bl\xF6tzmannscope, subject it to the Pigwell-Faffington Test,\
    \ and carry out several other procedures that you need not bother your ungainly\
    \ little heads about.\nAs a result of my labours, which I can assure you were\
    \ Herculean, I am now able to announce that if you replace the words \u201Ctungsten\
    \ grebe\u201D with \u201Czinc egret\u201D, all becomes clear. Well, if not exactly\
    \ clear, then let us say less misty."
