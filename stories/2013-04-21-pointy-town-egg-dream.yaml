  text: 'Last night I dreamt I went to Pointy Town again. I went by way of the Blister
    Lane Bypass, where important roadworks were taking place. In spite of the fact
    that I have never in my life been within twenty feet of a pneumatic drill, I took
    it into my head that I wished, with all my heart, to take part in the roadworks.
    I hopped off my bus--a number 666--dodged through the many container lorries thundering
    along the road in both directions, and, anent a muddy trench, grabbed hold of
    an unattended machine tool. With sure and steady thumb, I depressed the knob that
    spurred the machine to life, and proceeded to gouge out crumbly slabs of geological
    significance from the bottom of the trench. This being a dream, I was able to
    continue my deft roadworks until I reached the burning core at the centre of the
    earth. I stilled my machine, and dug through the final layers of rock fragments
    with my bare hands, and there I discovered an egg.

    "This is the egg of the world," I said, "I wonder what will hatch from it?"

    With the egg nestled in a pocket of my Tyrolean jacket, I clambered back up to
    the earth''s surface. Oddly, instead of finding myself at the Blister Lane Bypass,
    I was in Pointy Town itself, near the viaduct, outside the Old Collapsing Abandoned
    Swimming Pool. The door was ajar, and I pushed it open without the least trace
    of fear and stepped inside. As I did so, I heard the egg in my pocket crack.

    In the empty pool, with its distorting acoustics, a jug band, as if awaiting my
    arrival, struck up a jug band arrangement of "Mother Goose" by Jethro Tull. Was
    it a goose egg I had in my pocket? I fumbled in my pocket to hoist out the cracking
    egg. Something nipped my fingers, and I quickly pulled out my hand, eggless. Blood
    was flowing, far more copiously than one would expect from the tiny bite I had
    received. I waved my hand and my blood splattered the jug band. They played on,
    undisturbed.

    That is the thing about dreams, they make no sense. They have no significance.
    I am not even sure what a jug band is. I have never engaged in rogue roadworks.
    I have never been to Pointy Town.'
