  text: 'Close to the ruins of Eynsford Castle, Philip [Heseltine / Peter Warlock]
    shared the small main-street cottage with his composer friend, E. J. Moeran, together
    with a collection of cats and a Maori housekeeper-cum-factotum, Hal Collins (Te
    Akau) (d. 1929). Collins had previously been a barman at a London drinking club.
    [Cecil] Gray gave this intriguing description of him:

    "In contra-distinction to this more or less floating population of cats and women,
    a permanent member of the establishment was a strange character called Hal Collins
    . . . whose Maori grandmother had been a cannibal and used, within his memory,
    to lament the passing of the good old days when she could feast upon her kind.
    Besides being a graphic artist of considerable talent, particularly in woodcut,
    he was one of those people who, without ever having learned a note of music or
    received a lesson in piano playing, have an inborn technical dexterity and a quite
    remarkable gift for improvisation. He used to compose systematically, also, but
    without being able to write it down; I remember him once playing to me a whole
    act of an opera he had conceived on the subject of Tristram Shandy . . . He subsisted
    chiefly on stout, of which he consumed gargantuan quantities, and when elated
    would perform Maori war dances with quite terrifying realism. On spirits, however,
    he would run completely amok, in true native fashion, and on one occasion almost
    succeeded in massacring the entire household."
