  text: "Close to the ruins of Eynsford Castle, Philip [Heseltine / Peter Warlock]\
    \ shared the small main-street cottage with his composer friend, E. J. Moeran,\
    \ together with a collection of cats and a Maori housekeeper-cum-factotum, Hal\
    \ Collins (Te Akau) (d. 1929). Collins had previously been a barman at a London\
    \ drinking club. [Cecil] Gray gave this intriguing description of him:\n\u201C\
    In contra-distinction to this more or less floating population of cats and women,\
    \ a permanent member of the establishment was a strange character called Hal Collins\
    \ . . . whose Maori grandmother had been a cannibal and used, within his memory,\
    \ to lament the passing of the good old days when she could feast upon her kind.\
    \ Besides being a graphic artist of considerable talent, particularly in woodcut,\
    \ he was one of those people who, without ever having learned a note of music\
    \ or received a lesson in piano playing, have an inborn technical dexterity and\
    \ a quite remarkable gift for improvisation. He used to compose systematically,\
    \ also, but without being able to write it down; I remember him once playing to\
    \ me a whole act of an opera he had conceived on the subject of Tristram Shandy\
    \ . . . He subsisted chiefly on stout, of which he consumed gargantuan quantities,\
    \ and when elated would perform Maori war dances with quite terrifying realism.\
    \ On spirits, however, he would run completely amok, in true native fashion, and\
    \ on one occasion almost succeeded in massacring the entire household.\u201D\n\
