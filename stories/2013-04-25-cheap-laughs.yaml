    I watched, and much enjoyed, Ben Wheatley''s 2012 film Sightseers. Imagine Keith
    and Candice Marie from Mike Leigh''s Nuts In May as serial killers on the rampage
    and that will give you some idea.

    For all its pleasures, there was, however, one small lapse which I point out because
    I think it is symptomatic of a broader issue. There is a scene in which Chris
    (Steve Oram), the male lead, says "He''s not a human being. He''s a Daily Mail
    reader." The line guarantees a cheap laugh from the audience, but it''s all wrong,
    because the character being referred to fits much more neatly the stereotype of
    a Guardian reader. But it is precisely Guardian readers who are likely to form
    the audience for the film.

    "He''s not a human being. He''s a Guardian reader" is actually funnier, as well
    as being more fitting. But the Guardianistas would then have to laugh at themselves,
    something they''re not very good at. Taking a swipe at the Daily Mail, on the
    other hand, is easy. No thought required. It is similar to the depressing sight
    of Russell Brand assuming he can win an argument with Peter Hitchens merely by
    saying Hitchens writes for the Mail. Cue boos from the herd.

    While we are on the subject of comedy, Douglas Murray has a good point to make
    about The Book Of Mormon. Easy enough to elicit laughs at the expense of a preposterous
    sect, but it is not as if Mormonism is in any way a feature of the cultural landscape
    in this country. As he says,

    One reviewer called The Book of Mormon "decadent" and I know what he meant. It
    does seem the epitome of a corrupted culture that you have to import alien ideas
    to laugh at because you are too terrified to lampoon the alien ideas in your own
    midst. You could get someone to write The Book of Muhammad. I would happily write
    it myself. But we would not find a theatre, and even if we did the theatre would
    not find an insurer, so the show would not go on.

    Oh, incidentally, Sightseers may be the knitting and catastrophe film par excellence.'
