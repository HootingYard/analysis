  text: 'A letter arrives from Kimika Ying:

    Dear Mr. Key : I came across the following picture today which struck me as remarkably
    familiar, and words from one of your earlier writings came to mind:

    "Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle fourteen voots to a
    bucolic hamlet.."

    You may well have seen this photo before, but while it was on my mind I wanted
    to take a moment to thank you for making the world a more surreal place. Listening
    to Hooting Yard is always a pleasure.

    I had not seen the picture before, and nor did I recall the piece Ms Ying quoted--not
    surprisingly, as it is nine years old, appearing here in March 2004. Here are
    both the photograph (from this source) and my elderly tale, What''s On In Mustard
    Parva.


    My diving helmet is made of gleaming brass. I polish it once a week, on Friday
    afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle fourteen
    voots to a bucolic hamlet called Mustard Parva.

    (Curiously, there is no neighbouring village named Mustard Magna, although a rustic
    barnyard person I met while drinking a pot of gaar in the local gaar-pot drinking
    hut told me that there had once been such a place. In the year of his birth, this
    toothless derelict said, the sizeable cluster of wooden buildings known as Mustard
    Magna had been invaded by a sloth of bears, many hundreds of them, driven insane
    by ergot poisoning, each bear capable of destroying a humble peasant dwelling
    with a single thwack from its mighty paw. Two hours after the first bear lumbered
    across Sawdust Bridge, the village was completely obliterated. It is still shown
    on some maps.)

    Jamming my bicycle into a kiosk on Mustard Parva''s Yoko Ono Boulevard, I join
    six or seven other diving helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. Huddled together
    in the upstairs room of a building fast succumbing to dry rot, we discuss our
    diving helmets and take lamentably inaccurate minutes which are published regularly
    through the good offices of the Mustard Parva Thing, whose editor is none other
    than the blind cousin of Marigold Chew.
