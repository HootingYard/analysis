  text: 'Fossicking in the archives to find the text of What''s On In Mustard Parva
    (see below), I noticed that the day before I had posted an extract from the magnificently-titled
    Withered Leaves From Memory''s Garland by Abigail Stanley Hanna (1857):

    Next to Rosa Whittier sat Julia Balcolm, with saddened expression of countenance
    and large deep blue eyes that gazed upon you with a deeper expression of melancholy
    in their glances than is usual to the merry age of childhood, and elicited your
    sympathy ere you knew her history. Julia was a cripple. She was drawn to school
    by an older sister with rosy cheeks, bright flashing black eyes, and a sprightly
    animated countenance, and carried into the school-room in the arms of her teacher,
    or some of the older scholars. And so she came, year after year, mingling with
    the merry group. But where is she now? Yon little mound of heaped up earth covers
    her remains, and a narrow marble slab tells the place of her repose, and we can
    but hope she who was denied the privilege of walking on earth may now soar on
    angel''s wings. This dear child was obliged to crawl from place to place after
    her more favoured companions, dragging her useless perished limbs behind her.
    But He who careth for us knew what was best for her, and we cannot doubt His infinite
    wisdom.

    Would that Edward Gorey were with us still, to illustrate this tear-stained yet
    uplifting tale!'
