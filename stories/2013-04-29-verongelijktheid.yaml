  text: 'There is a Dutch word . . . verongelijktheid, to be wronged, not by an individual
    so much as by the world at large. You often see it in the way the much-heralded
    national team plays soccer.

    Proud of their superior skills, their multicultural makeup, the almost mocking
    manner of their free-flowing play, maddening the players of more prosaic teams,
    like Germany, the stars of Dutch soccer usually start their games with all the
    swagger of swinging Amsterdam. In their playful individualism, their progressive
    daringness, they know they are the best. And sometimes they are. But when things
    go against them and the plodding Germans, or the bloody-minded Italians, or the
    cussed English, go up a goal or two, the heads slump, the bickering starts, and
    the game is lost in a sour mood of verongelijktheid. Why did this have to happen
    to us? What did we do to deserve this? Aren''t we the best? Well, fuck you!
