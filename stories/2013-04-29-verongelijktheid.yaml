  text: "There is a Dutch word . . . verongelijktheid, to be wronged, not by an individual\
    \ so much as by the world at large. You often see it in the way the much-heralded\
    \ national team plays soccer.\nProud of their superior skills, their multicultural\
    \ makeup, the almost mocking manner of their free-flowing play, maddening the\
    \ players of more prosaic teams, like Germany, the stars of Dutch soccer usually\
    \ start their games with all the swagger of swinging Amsterdam. In their playful\
    \ individualism, their progressive daringness, they know they are the best. And\
    \ sometimes they are. But when things go against them and the plodding Germans,\
    \ or the bloody-minded Italians, or the cussed English, go up a goal or two, the\
    \ heads slump, the bickering starts, and the game is lost in a sour mood of verongelijktheid.\
    \ Why did this have to happen to us? What did we do to deserve this? Aren't we\
    \ the best? Well, fuck you!\nIan Buruma, Murder In Amsterdam\_: The Death Of Theo\
    \ Van Gogh And The Limits Of Tolerance (2006)"
