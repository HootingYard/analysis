  text: 'In a comment on Knitting & Catastrophe, someone calling themselves "Who are
    you?" gets very prickly and accuses me of all sorts of perfidy. I am assuming
    this must be Dr Jonathan Faiers himself, familiar as he is with the contents of
    Dr Faiers'' email inbox.

    I wrote to him, you see, to alert him to the fact that the film Sightseers is
    a splendid example of knitting and catastrophe in the cinema. And I wrote because
    I think "knitting and catastrophe in the cinema" is a brilliant, brilliant theme,
    for which Dr Faiers should be applauded. Alas, he ignored that praise, preferring
    to become enraged by my comments about the deadly horror of academic prose--all
    those "interrogations"--and heaped insult and invective upon me. Which rather
    goes to prove my point--he is clearly capable of writing vivid prose, so why must
    he couch his lecture in such clogged-up blather?

    Anyway, I mention this as an excuse to direct your attention to a comment by David
    Thompson, which neatly summarises everything that is wrong with academic art talk,
    specifically "interrogations" (and "explorations"):

    A while ago, I suggested a drinking game involving random art press releases.
    Every time you spot the word ''explores'' or ''interrogates'' you take a swig
    of tequila. Oblivion would beckon very quickly indeed. These words are all but
    obligatory--it''s a way to signal phony intellectual heft--and given the context,
    they''re usually meaningless. The particulars of this alleged mental activity--all
    this exploring and interrogating--never seem to be stated clearly, and no conclusions
    ever seem to be reached or announced to the public. But that''s because these
    words aren''t meant to refer to reality. You''ll see they''re used pretty much
    randomly. They''re just there to let the credulous punter know that the artist
    is supposed to be clever and therefore deserving of attention and taxpayer subsidy.'
