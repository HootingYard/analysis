  text: 'He was out by the tar pits, as usual, thinking hard about tar, as usual.
    Tar occupied his thoughts when he went to the tar pits, but the rest of the time
    he could dismiss it, tar, from his head. He was a carrot-top, and he smelled of
    fresh-mown grass.

    Tar is a product of the destructive distillation of organic substances. It is
    a highly complex material, varying in its composition according to the nature
    of the body from which it is distilled, different products, moreover, being obtained
    according to the temperature at which the process of distillation is carried on.
    As commercial products there are two principal classes of tar in use--wood tar,
    the product of the special distillation of several varieties of wood, and coal
    tar, which is primarily a by-product of the distillation of coal during the manufacture
    of gas for illuminating purposes.. These tars are intimately related to bitumen,
    asphalt, mineral pitch and petroleum.

    He knew all this, and the more he thought about it, the more his head became tar-filled,
    almost up to the brim. It was a relief to lollop over to the pier and to board
    the waiting paddle-steamer, and to chug along the wide important river, all the
    way home. For a paddle-steamer snack, he had a blood orange in a paper bag.

    He leaned on the rail, eating his snack and keeping an eye on the riverbank in
    hope of spotting an otter. When he was not at the tar pits, thinking about tar,
    much of his time was spent trying to devise a working otter-scanner. He envisioned
    some sort of contraption to be worn on his head, with a visor that could be lowered,
    with viewfinders attached, and a hand-held control panel, with lights and buzzers.
    Was there a riverbank creature more glorious than the otter? He thought not.

    Yet the pull of the tar pits was irresistible. Sometimes, as soon as he disembarked
    at the pier close to home, he turned tail and reboarded the paddle-steamer and
    went straight back. Then he thought hard about wood tar. Wood tar, known also
    as Stockholm and as Archangel tar, is principally prepared in the great pine forests
    of central and northern Russia, Finland and Sweden. The material chiefly employed
    is the resinous stools and roots of the Scotch fir and the Siberian larch, with
    other less common fir-tree roots. A large amount of tar is also prepared from
    the roots of the swamp pine in North and South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama,
    in the United States. In the distillation of wood a series of products, including
    gas, tar, pyroligneous acid, acetone, wood spirit and charcoal may be obtained,
    and any of these may be the primary object of the operation.

    He had never been to any of those places, to Russia or Finland or Sweden, to North
    or South Carolina or Georgia or Alabama in the United States. He had never been
    anywhere really, save for along the wide important river from his home to the
    tar pits and back. But he had no Wanderlust. And he was a moral cretin.

    A portion of fruit in a paper bag was his favourite snack. He did not care much
    which fruit. He used the same paper bag day in day out until it was tattered and
    torn and fell to bits. Then he asked the greengrocer for a fresh paper bag. The
    greengrocer was a huge beast of a man with a florid face and one withered arm,
    and he did not give out paper bags willy nilly. But he liked to hear tales of
    tar.

    Wood tar is used in medicine under the name of Fix liquida. Its preparation unguentum
    picis liquidae is composed of wood tar and yellow beeswax. Externally tar is a
    valuable stimulating dressing in scaly skin diseases, such as psoriasis and chronic
    eczema. Internally wood tar is a popular remedy as an expectorant in subacute
    and chronic bronchitis. It is usually given as tar water, one part of wood tar
    being stirred into four parts of water and filtered. Given internally tar is likely
    to upset the digestion; taken in large quantities it causes pain and vomiting
    and dark urine, symptoms similar to carbolic acid poisoning.

    That is what he told the greengrocer when applying for his most recent new paper
    bag. It was a hot Thursday in August and he had some bright ideas in his head
    about the otter-scanner. He bought a Carlsbad plum to go in his new paper bag
    and headed towards the pier. Ah! Sweet mystery of life! At last I''ve found thee.
    Ah! I know at last the secret of it all! All the longing, seeking, striving, waiting,
    yearning, the burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall. Tar and otters!
    Otters and tar!

    The "tar" found in tar pits is not actually tar.'
