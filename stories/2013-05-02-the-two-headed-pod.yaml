  text: "Those of you who have heard the inimitable Norm Sherman read my work will\
    \ be happy to learn that the latest episode of the Drabblecast is a \u201Cdouble-header\u201D\
    \ featuring two tales from Hooting Yard. The show includes Pabstus Tack and The\
    \ Breadcrumbs Man. It is worth pointing out that, when it came to recording a\
    \ muffled ghostly contribution at the end of a telephone line, I was under the\
    \ impression that Norm would be reading The Return Of Pabstus Tack, so that is\
    \ the story I was talking about. Apparently that piece will now appear in a future\
    \ edition.\nHie thee yon to go and listen, after which you may wish to add your\
    \ observations to the Drabblecast Forum.\n"
