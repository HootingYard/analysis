  text: 'Those of you who have heard the inimitable Norm Sherman read my work will
    be happy to learn that the latest episode of the Drabblecast is a "double-header"
    featuring two tales from Hooting Yard. The show includes Pabstus Tack and The
    Breadcrumbs Man. It is worth pointing out that, when it came to recording a muffled
    ghostly contribution at the end of a telephone line, I was under the impression
    that Norm would be reading The Return Of Pabstus Tack, so that is the story I
    was talking about. Apparently that piece will now appear in a future edition.

    Hie thee yon to go and listen, after which you may wish to add your observations
    to the Drabblecast Forum.
