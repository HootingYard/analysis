  text: "\nGenerations of tinies have grown up learning the nursery rhyme with the\
    \ Roud Folk Song Index number 21143, to wit:\nRide a cock-horse to Banbury Cross,\n\
    \  To see a fine lady upon a white horse;\n  Rings on her fingers and bells on\
    \ her toes,\n  And she shall have music wherever she goes.\nIn a recent earth-shattering\
    \ research paper, published in The Weekly Earth-Shattering Research Papers Digest,\
    \ boffins at the Centre For Banbury Cross Studies make a convincing argument that\
    \ the third line of the rhyme is wrong. Using state of the art techniques involving\
    \ a big magnetic robot, they claim that it ought to read\nWrinkles on her fingers\
    \ and boils on her toes.\nThe lady may indeed be fine, but she is also a crone,\
    \ or a hag. It is thought that she is related by sisterhood to both the Woohoohoodiwoo\
    \ Woman and the Woman of Twigs, and Shakespeare probably had the trio in mind\
    \ when he was writing The Tragedie Of Macbeth.\nIn a related development, other\
    \ boffins at a different Centre, for other Studies, have been using state of the\
    \ art techniques involving a tiny rubber nozzle to identify the music that the\
    \ lady with wrinkles on her fingers and boils on her toes was listening to wherever\
    \ she went. Their unarguable case is that the music was some particularly argumentative\
    \ German improv racket, made with dustbin lids and hammers and hideous electronic\
    \ buzzing noises.\nTogether, these two studies shed an entirely new light on the\
    \ nursery rhyme. It is a light that the present day inhabitants of Banbury Cross\
    \ find unwelcome, and there have been mutterings in the streets, and dark deeds\
    \ plotted in the taverns, and pebbles thrown at boffins. Excitingly, the latter\
    \ hoo-hah has given rise to the creation of a brand new nursery rhyme:\nRide a\
    \ cock-horse to Banbury Cross\n  To see all the citizens get very cross\n  Let's\
    \ all throw pebbles at the boffins\n  Until they end up in their coffins."
