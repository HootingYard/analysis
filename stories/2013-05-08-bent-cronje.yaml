  text: "Hooba Nooba Hoo! Bent Cronje!\n  He forded the Ack and he slew our foes!\n\
    \  He lopped off their heads and stuck them on spikes!\n  With his bevelled sword\
    \ he slew and slew!\n  Now we carry his bones to their resting-place\n  In the\
    \ palace on the hill under a cloud of crows!\n  But the mighty Bent Cronje will\
    \ never die!\n  He is reborn daily as a bird!\nThis is a translation--and not\
    \ a very good one--of the so-called Bent Cronje Song, commemorating Bent Cronje,\
    \ the ancient hero who saved the town of Scroonhoonpooge from attack by the forces\
    \ of Git, the \"King-across-the-Ack\". Its chief interest, for historians, is\
    \ the mention of the palace on the hill. Where in the name of heaven was this\
    \ palace? There are no hills anywhere near Scroonhoonpooge. The land thereabouts\
    \ is flat for as far as the eye can see, and indeed much of it is boggy and marshy\
    \ and empuddled.\nIf the site could be located, it would be possible to have a\
    \ dig, with spades, to see if there are any bones buried there. The presence of\
    \ bones would not necessarily prove the historical existence of Bent Cronje himself,\
    \ of course, but it would give scholars something to mull over. As things stand,\
    \ all we know of Bent Cronje is his song and a shield--much battered and dented\
    \ and rusty--kept in a glass case in the vestibule of Scroonhoonpooge Almshouse.\
    \ It is said, according to the hand-written card stuck next to it, to be Bent\
    \ Cronje's shield, which he carried with him as he forded the Ack and lopped the\
    \ heads off Git's army. The provenance of the adjacent piece of cardboard is dubious,\
    \ with some claiming it only appeared in the glass case last Thursday. If that\
    \ is true, Bent Cronje's shield might be any old scrap of battered and dented\
    \ and rusty metal dug out of a pit somewhere in the vicinity. It might not even\
    \ be a shield.\nWhereas the historians are stymied until such time as they can\
    \ find the location of the palace, not so the ornithologists. Unsurprisingly,\
    \ quite a number of bird experts get in a flap about the idea that Bent Cronje\
    \ is \"reborn daily\" as a bird. There are competing theories. One strand of thought\
    \ is that the soul or essence of Bent Cronje is present in a new hatchling every\
    \ day, implying that over the centuries untold thousands of birds have actually\
    \ been Bent Cronje simultaneously. Against this, some argue that there is but\
    \ a single soul or essence which somehow flits from bird to bird by a process\
    \ we puny humans cannot hope to comprehend.\nThere was a fad, a few years ago,\
    \ for Bent Cronje bird seances. A bird would be trapped and encaged and brought\
    \ to a darkened room and the cage placed in the centre of a round table, Various\
    \ spiritually-minded ornithologists would be seated around the table, and they\
    \ would attempt to elicit from the bird some indication that it was the living\
    \ embodiment, for that day at least, of the legendary hero. The process usually\
    \ involved rapping noises, sudden chills in the room temperature, and the spewing\
    \ of ectoplasm. No definitive Bent Cronje bird was ever identified, which is hardly\
    \ surprising when one considers the foolishness of such behaviour.\nMy own view\
    \ is that someone ought to study very carefully that translation of the song.\
    \ I suspect it is woefully inaccurate, and that the words Bent and Cronje and\
    \ Ack and foes and lopped and heads and stuck and spikes and bevelled and sword\
    \ and slew and bones and resting-place and palace and hill and crows and reborn\
    \ and daily and bird are all wrong. It would be immeasurably helpful if we knew\
    \ from what language it has been translated."
