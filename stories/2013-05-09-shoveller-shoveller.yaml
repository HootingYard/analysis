  text: "\"Shoveller, shoveller, what do you shovel?\"\n\"I'm shovelling the muck\
    \ outside your hovel.\"\n\"Shoveller, shoveller, please desist!\n  I love my muck,\
    \ it will be much missed!\"\n\"Peasant, oh peasant, the muck is not yours.\n \
    \ I'm shovelling it off for a greater cause.\n  The cause of the princeling who\
    \ owns your muck,\n  As he owns you, your hovel and your duck\n  And your pot\
    \ and your pan and your hay and your straw.\n  The princeling needs your muck\
    \ for the war.\"\n\"Shoveller, shoveller, what war is that?\"\n\"It is the war\
    \ of the princeling's hat.\"\nFragment from an old folk song called \"The War\
    \ Of The Princeling's Hat\"."
