    \ the muck outside your hovel.\u201D\n\u201CShoveller, shoveller, please desist!\n\
    \  I love my muck, it will be much missed!\u201D\n\u201CPeasant, oh peasant, the\
    \ muck is not yours.\n  I'm shovelling it off for a greater cause.\n  The cause\
    \ of the princeling who owns your muck,\n  As he owns you, your hovel and your\
    \ duck\n  And your pot and your pan and your hay and your straw.\n  The princeling\
    \ needs your muck for the war.\u201D\n\u201CShoveller, shoveller, what war is\
    \ that?\u201D\n\u201CIt is the war of the princeling's hat.\u201D\nFragment from\
    \ an old folk song called \u201CThe War Of The Princeling's Hat\u201D."
