  text: "When I saw advertisements for the imminent cinema release of Mud, I was bitterly\
    \ disappointed to learn that this is a brand new film. I had hoped it was a revival\
    \ of the original Mud, that classic film dun directed by wild-eyed auteur Horst\
    \ Gack.\n\nThe wrong Mud\nGack, of course, invented film dun, and was its greatest\
    \ practitioner. Unlike film noir, the archetypal film dun is shot entirely in\
    \ shades of dun. It was Horst Gack's peculiar genius to recognise that there could\
    \ be no better subject matter for a film in dun than mud. Thus, in Mud (1937),\
    \ and its sequel, Further Mud (1957), the camera gazes unflinchingly at patches\
    \ of mud, wholly dun in colour, without distracting the viewer with poltrooneries\
    \ such as characters and plot and car chases and big loud fiery explosions.\n\u201C\
    Mud is a gripping experience,\u201D wrote the film critic Gervase Cravat in the\
    \ October 1937 issue of Cravat's Film Digest magazine, \u201CI, for one, will\
    \ never look at mud in the same way, ever again.\u201D\nHe returned to the subject\
    \ in the following month's issue.\nLast month I wrote that, having seen Horst\
    \ Gack's Mud, I would never look at mud in the same way, ever again. It is with\
    \ a certain humility, then, if not utter self-abasement, that I must admit I have\
    \ indeed been looking at mud in the same old way as I always did. The very next\
    \ day after watching Mud, I was taking a stroll in a sordid rustic backwater when\
    \ I came upon an extensive stretch of mud, dun in hue, and the thought popped\
    \ into my head \u201CGosh, what a lot of mud, just like all the other mud I have\
    \ ever seen in my three score years on earth\u201D, and I pranced on, towards\
    \ the viaduct and the otter sanctuary, dismissing the mud from my mind. Only when\
    \ I got home several hours later, and was making a cup of tea, preparatory to\
    \ putting my feet up and whistling some dance band tunes, did I realise that I\
    \ had looked at the mud in the old way, as if had never seen Horst Gack's film.\
    \ This was highly disconcerting, so much so that I tightened the cravat around\
    \ my neck, forgot about the cup of tea, and immediately wrote a mea culpa to Gack,\
    \ confessing that his film had not, after all, had the effect on me I thought\
    \ it had had, but this was almost certainly my fault rather than his. Knowing\
    \ that unquestioning worship is the only proper approach to the great auteur,\
    \ I added that I would atone for my philistinism by returning to the extensive\
    \ stretch of mud, dun in hue, in the sordid rustic backwater, and mould from it\
    \ a dun-hued mud effigy of Horst Gack himself, double life-size, before which\
    \ I would prostrate myself several times a day, in between watching repeat screenings\
    \ of Mud. This I have done, every day since, and boy oh boy, let me tell you,\
    \ filmgoers, I am like unto a man transformed."
