  text: 'Cheese was rarely consumed on an allegorical level in the seventeenth century.

    E. de Jongh, cited in The Embarrassment Of Riches : An Interpretation Of Dutch
    Culture In The Golden Age (1987) by Simon Schama. Lucky for me that I did not
    live in that place at that time, as my own consumption of cheese is pursued almost
    exclusively on an allegorical level. I shall have more to say on this matter shortly.'
