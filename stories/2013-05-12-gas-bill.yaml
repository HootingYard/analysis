  text: 'I do not use the word "naff", because I think the word "naff" is in itself
    naff. When I wish to describe something as naff, I employ a less naff euphemism,
    with which those who know me are familiar. By the same token, I object to the
    phrase "dumbing down", which in itself seems to me an instance of dumbing down.
    "Infantilisation" is a possible substitute, though it does not quite capture the
    full meaning of "dumbing down".

    The process, whatever we choose to call it, is all around us, of course. The latest
    incidence occurred when I opened my gas bill. Instead of hoicking from the envelope
    a bald bureaucratic statement, I was horrified to find myself looking at what
    I mistook for a teaching aid from an infant school self esteem ''n'' diversity
    awareness hub. It was all blocks of glaring primary colours and word balloons,
    complete with a sinister little photo-cartoon of a homunculus, the head out of
    proportion to the body. I begin to wonder if British Gas will accept payment in
    play money.

    On an entirely different matter, I noted on a side panel on the front page of
    yesterday''s Grauniad the line: Lionel Shriver : Who cares about what I eat?,
    to which my immediate response, spoken aloud as I chucked the paper across the
    room in exasperation, was Nobody cares, Lionel Shriver, nobody cares at all!'
