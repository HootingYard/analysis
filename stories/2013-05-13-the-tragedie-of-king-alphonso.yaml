  text: 'Scene One : The King''s Chamber. The King is seated in effulgent glory on
    his throne. The light pours out of him. Enter Sir Cleothgard, the King''s Chamberlain.

    Chamberlain : May I be ushered into your dazzling presence, O mighty King?

    King : Yes, yes, come in, Sir Cleothgard. Execute the necessary fawning and scraping,
    prostrate yourself in the muck, then hoist yourself to your feet and come clanking
    for''ard, but not too close.

    Sir Cleothgard does as he is commanded.

    Chamberlain : I bring grave news from the frontier, Sire.

    King : Really? What have you been doing, galumphing around the frontier, when
    your duties lie here in the chamber?

    Chamberlain : I thought I would get a bit of fresh air, O lord of light.

    King : Did you indeed? Are you suggesting that the chamber is a fug of stale air
    enmixed with noisome pongs?

    Chamberlain : Not for a moment, Sire. Truly, it is bliss to breathe the merest
    atom of air in the vicinity of your regal presence. And rest assured that all
    the while I was gallivanting I was in constant contact with the underchamberlain
    via my cordless metal tapping machine, ready to rush! rush! rush! to your side
    should my services be required.

    King : And now you have come rush! rush! rushing!, so what is afoot?

    Chamberlain : As I said, Sire, grave news, grave news indeed. You know that those
    who dwell beyond the frontier are, by definition, strangers? But of course you
    do! You are the King, and therefore omniscient. Be that as it may, while I was
    out and about, mincing around the frontier lands, I had the opportunity to study
    the eyes of the strangers. I carried with me, as I always do, an oculoscope, crafted
    for me by the court wizardy man, Ulg.

    King : Ulg is indeed a great servant of the crown, and the maker of many a bewildering
    instrument. Go on.

    Chamberlain : It pains me to say it, Sire, but when I peered through Ulg''s oculoscope
    into the eyes of the strangers, I was begraunt a vision, reflected back at me,
    of your puissance.

    King : Ah! My puissance! How I treasure it! You know, Sir Cleothgard, that few
    kings in all history have had puissance as puissant as mine?

    Chamberlain : Indeed, Your Magnificence. But the puissance I saw in the eyes of
    those strangers was ruin''d, quite, quite ruin''d!

    King : Bloody hell! Really?

    Chamberlain : I am afraid so, Sire.

    King : You realise what this means, Sir Cleothgard? War! It means war!

    Chamberlain : I am well aware of that, Sire.

    King : You must immediately prepare my army and my navy and my air force and my
    special forces and my black ops unit for battle.

    Chamberlain : I have already taken the liberty of doing just that, Sire. They
    are fully provisioned and victualled and marching or sailing or ballooning off
    to the frontier to do battle with your foes.

    King : Excellent, Sir Cleothgard. I will pin a medal on your chest in recognition
    of your brio. But not before you have flown to the United Nations headquarters
    to present our case to the Security Council. I wish to get their blessing that
    this is a just war, in the terms laid down by the great French writer Racine.

    Chamberlain : If I might be so bold, O majestic one, why bother with those jumped-up
    bureaucrats and paper-pushers?

    King : For the very simple reason that once I have prosecuted this war, and defeated
    the enemy, and my puissance is once again restored to fantasticness, I do not
    wish to be haunted, where''er I go, by gaggles of unruly placard-waving wankers
    protesting that it was an unjust or illegal war, as happened with Tony Blair.

    Chamberlain : Of course, Sire, I ought to have thought of that and got Security
    Council clearance already.

    King : Yes, Sir Cleothgard, you should. Perhaps I may not give you a medal after
    all, but instead have your head lopped off and stuck upon a spike.

    Chamberlain : Oo-er!

    King : Ho ho ho. I was only joking. Now, off you go to the United Nations.

    Chamberlain : At once, Sire!

    Exit Chamberlain.

    Scene Two : The King''s Chamber. The King is seated in effulgent glory on his
    throne. The light pours out of him. Enter Sir Potipharge, the King''s Underchamberlain.

    Underchamberlain : May I be ushered into your dazzling presence, O mighty King?

    King : Yes, yes, come in, Sir Potipharge. Execute the necessary fawning and scraping,
    prostrate yourself in the muck, then hoist yourself to your feet and come clanking
    for''ard, but not too close.

    Sir Potipharge does as he is commanded.

    Underchamberlain : I bring grave news from the United Nations, Sire.

    King : What now?

    Underchamberlain : Your Chamberlain, Sir Cleothgard, was mistaken for the diplomat
    Lester Townsend and stabbed in the back by a knife hurled with expert dexterity
    by a dour grim agent in the pay of Phillip Vandamm, Sire.

    King : Crikey! What does this mean for my puissance?

    Underchamberlain : I fear it is ruin''d, Your Effulgence, quite, quite ruin''d.

    They sob. Bats swoop from down from the rafters and darkness falls.
