  text: "[With thanks to Banished To A Pompous Land.]\nIt was a stark and doomy night;\
    \ the rain fell in torrents\u2014except at occasional intervals, when it was checked\
    \ by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in Pointy Town\
    \ that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the\
    \ scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.\nBy the light\
    \ of one such scanty flame, had we a view of the scene, we might have spotted,\
    \ prancing along the windswept street, muffled in a stylish Piet Van Der Groot\
    \ greatcoat, that titan among cultural theorists, Jean-Luc Git. Slung around his\
    \ shoulder was a satchel, and in the satchel was a copy, hot off the press, of\
    \ his latest book. Did I say book? It was not a word Git used. He called it a\
    \ texte or a (dis)course, of course. On this stark and doomy night he was on his\
    \ way through the gusty streets of Pointy Town to read selections from his texte\
    \ or (dis)course to a tavern full of intoxicated intellectuals.\nThey were intoxicated\
    \ both by booze and by ideas, and nobody had better ideas than Jean-Luc Git. So\
    \ the tavern's hubbub was stilled, and there was an expectant hush, as the cultural\
    \ theorist came crashing through the door. Without removing his stylish greatcoat,\
    \ he crossed to the low stage where a lectern had been placed. Next to the lectern\
    \ was a table on which stood a small glass containing a spiritous liquor of vivid\
    \ hue. Git swigged it, took his texte or (dis)course out of the satchel, opened\
    \ it on the lectern, and began to declaim.\nFor half an hour or so, everything\
    \ went tickety-boo. Git recited his clogged impenetrable prose and the intellectuals\
    \ furrowed their brows, nodded sagely, and tugged at their goatees. But then the\
    \ cultural theorist said:\n\u201C\u2026 and so, in what we might call the helix\
    \ of disengagement, we interrogate notions of structure, unstructure, dis-structure,\
    \ mis-structure, and ur-structure by way of an investigation, doubly incoherent,\
    \ both formal and informal, of the punctum of jouissance \u2026\u201D\nFrom somewhere\
    \ in the audience, there was a titter, which turned to a chortle, and very soon\
    \ became a guffaw. It was followed by a heckle, couched in language so unseemly\
    \ it is not fit for family reading. Git was stopped in his tracks.\n\u201CI beg\
    \ your pardon?\u201D he shouted.\n\u201CYou heard what I said,\u201D replied the\
    \ heckler.\n\u201CHow dare you impugn my jouissance!\u201D cried Git.\nBut it\
    \ was as if the occasional violent gusts of winds which swept up the streets of\
    \ Pointy Town had come blowing into the tavern, as if the torrents of rain on\
    \ this stark and doomy night had come flooding in. In the tumult, the cultural\
    \ theorist's jouissance proved no defence. He was undone.\nDiscussion points for\
    \ your reading group.\nWhat is a just course of action if as a cultural theoretician\
    \ one's jouissance is impugned?.\nList the personality defects of the kind of\
    \ barbarian who would impugn the jouissance of a figure as titanic as Jean-Luc\
    \ Git.\nUsing scissors and cardboard, make a paper dolly dressed in a Piet Van\
    \ Der Groot greatcoat.\nWhich tavern in Pointy Town do you think would be so irresponsible\
    \ as to allow entry to a barbarian so culturally depraved that they would heckle\
    \ Jean-Luc Git?\nDo you think the \u201Cscanty flame\u201D from the lamps that\
    \ struggle against the darkness is symbolic of Jean-Luc Git's jouissance?\nSag\u2019\
    \ mir, wo die Blumen sind?"
