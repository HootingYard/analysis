  text: '[With thanks to Banished To A Pompous Land.]

    It was a stark and doomy night; the rain fell in torrents--except at occasional
    intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets
    (for it is in Pointy Town that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops,
    and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the
    darkness.

    By the light of one such scanty flame, had we a view of the scene, we might have
    spotted, prancing along the windswept street, muffled in a stylish Piet Van Der
    Groot greatcoat, that titan among cultural theorists, Jean-Luc Git. Slung around
    his shoulder was a satchel, and in the satchel was a copy, hot off the press,
    of his latest book. Did I say book? It was not a word Git used. He called it a
    texte or a (dis)course, of course. On this stark and doomy night he was on his
    way through the gusty streets of Pointy Town to read selections from his texte
    or (dis)course to a tavern full of intoxicated intellectuals.

    They were intoxicated both by booze and by ideas, and nobody had better ideas
    than Jean-Luc Git. So the tavern''s hubbub was stilled, and there was an expectant
    hush, as the cultural theorist came crashing through the door. Without removing
    his stylish greatcoat, he crossed to the low stage where a lectern had been placed.
    Next to the lectern was a table on which stood a small glass containing a spiritous
    liquor of vivid hue. Git swigged it, took his texte or (dis)course out of the
    satchel, opened it on the lectern, and began to declaim.

    For half an hour or so, everything went tickety-boo. Git recited his clogged impenetrable
    prose and the intellectuals furrowed their brows, nodded sagely, and tugged at
    their goatees. But then the cultural theorist said:

    "... and so, in what we might call the helix of disengagement, we interrogate
    notions of structure, unstructure, dis-structure, mis-structure, and ur-structure
    by way of an investigation, doubly incoherent, both formal and informal, of the
    punctum of jouissance ..."

    From somewhere in the audience, there was a titter, which turned to a chortle,
    and very soon became a guffaw. It was followed by a heckle, couched in language
    so unseemly it is not fit for family reading. Git was stopped in his tracks.

    "I beg your pardon?" he shouted.

    "You heard what I said," replied the heckler.

    "How dare you impugn my jouissance!" cried Git.

    But it was as if the occasional violent gusts of winds which swept up the streets
    of Pointy Town had come blowing into the tavern, as if the torrents of rain on
    this stark and doomy night had come flooding in. In the tumult, the cultural theorist''s
    jouissance proved no defence. He was undone.

    Discussion points for your reading group.

    What is a just course of action if as a cultural theoretician one''s jouissance
    is impugned?.

    List the personality defects of the kind of barbarian who would impugn the jouissance
    of a figure as titanic as Jean-Luc Git.

    Using scissors and cardboard, make a paper dolly dressed in a Piet Van Der Groot
    greatcoat.

    Which tavern in Pointy Town do you think would be so irresponsible as to allow
    entry to a barbarian so culturally depraved that they would heckle Jean-Luc Git?

    Do you think the "scanty flame" from the lamps that struggle against the darkness
    is symbolic of Jean-Luc Git''s jouissance?
