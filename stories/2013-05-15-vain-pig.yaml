  text: "\"Vain pig, vain pig\n  How did your ego grow so big?\"\n\"I am the pig of\
    \ whom it's said\n  'That pig has an enormous head'\nI am the central being of\
    \ the universe\n  Which is both a blessing and a curse\nMy vanity I need not justify\n\
    \  I reign supreme within my sty\nI reign supreme over beasts and men\n  I bow\
    \ to no one save that hen\"\n\"What hen? I see no God-like hen.\"\n  \"It is invisible,\
    \ beyond man's ken\""
