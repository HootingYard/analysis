  text: "\u201CVain pig, vain pig\n  How did your ego grow so big?\u201D\n\u201CI\
    \ am the pig of whom it's said\n  \u2018That pig has an enormous head\u2019\n\
    I am the central being of the universe\n  Which is both a blessing and a curse\n\
    My vanity I need not justify\n  I reign supreme within my sty\nI reign supreme\
    \ over beasts and men\n  I bow to no one save that hen\u201D\n\u201CWhat hen?\
    \ I see no God-like hen.\u201D\n  \u201CIt is invisible, beyond man's ken\u201D"
