  text: 'I am currently reading blockbusting paperback bestseller Gone Girl by Gillian
    Flynn. It''s a page-turning thriller which I am much enjoying, in a blockbusting
    paperback bestseller page-turning thriller kind of way. But I reach page 260,
    and lo! there is a sudden and awful clunk! Until now, all the dialogue has been
    believable--you can imagine the characters speaking the words Ms Flynn puts in
    their mouths. But would anyone, in any circumstances, ever, say:

    "I think that''s it. Yes, Amy is using a Madness song to give me a clue to my
    own freedom, if only I can decipher their wily, ska-infused codes."

    I shall be looking for opportunities to say this as often as possible in future.'
