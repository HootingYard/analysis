  text: "The pounding of those infernal drums began shortly before dawn. I could hear\
    \ them, in the distance, from far across the wild and desolate tarputa. It was\
    \ not a regular, rhythmic pounding, but a drum din more disturbing, a clattering\
    \ cacophony of bangs and rattles and thumps and booms, as if a thousand Chris\
    \ Cutlers were improvising simultaneously. In the folding camp-cot next to mine,\
    \ Carruthers stirred.\n\u201CMy God!\u201D he said, \u201CWhat is it? Your countenance\
    \ is ghastly, and the blood has drained from your face, which is twitching horribly,\
    \ like Herbert Lom in the Clouseau films.\u201D\n\u201CIt's the pounding of those\
    \ infernal drums, Carruthers,\u201D I replied, \u201CCan you not hear them?\u201D\
    \n\u201CBit of a problem with the old hearing, actually,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    Since that savage aimed his blowpipe directly at my eardrum the other day.\u201D\
    \nI had forgotten the incident. I had forgotten much of what occurred on our journey\
    \ to the edge of the tarputa. Sometimes it is easier to forget.\nI stepped out\
    \ of the tent, lit my pipe, and took a deep draw on the filthy Kirghiz scrag tobacco.\
    \ The sun was rising now, over the tarputa, and the din of the drums grew louder\
    \ and more ominous. Carruthers joined me, lit his own pipe, and muttered something\
    \ about eggs.\nAfter breakfast, sitting in our folding camp-chairs, smoking our\
    \ pipes, we gazed dully across the wild and desolate tarputa. Every so often the\
    \ bleak expanse of nothingness was broken by a swooping bird or a distant, scurrying\
    \ gazelle. The drumming continued without cease, still increasing in volume, though\
    \ not yet within our sight.\n\u201CCan you hear it yet, that infernal pounding?\u201D\
    \ I asked.\n\u201CYes, faintly, in my good ear,\u201D said Carruthers. His face\
    \ too was now twitching horribly.\n\u201CSoon enough whoever is making that godawful\
    \ racket will appear on the horizon,\u201D I said, \u201CWe must devise a plan.\u201D\
    \nCarruthers spread our map out on the folding camp-table. We pondered our position,\
    \ on the edge of the tarputa, with the Big Frightening River behind us. To hide\
    \ in our tent would be unmanly. But our folding camp-rocket launcher was out of\
    \ commission, having been gnawed to ruin by an army of ferocious biting ants.\n\
    \u201CWhat if we covered ourselves in vividly coloured dyes and posed as savage\
    \ gods?\u201D suggested Carruthers, \u201CWe might strike terror into them, and\
    \ they would turn tail and scamper back to wherever they came from.\u201D\n\u201C\
    But who are they?\u201D I said, \u201CWe do not yet know with whom we are dealing.\u201D\
    \n\u201CFair point,\u201D said Carruthers, relighting his pipe, which had gone\
    \ out.\nI set up the folding camp-sundial to ascertain the time. It was nearly\
    \ midday. There was still no sign of the infernal drummers, yet the noise they\
    \ were making was now deafening.\n\u201CMore eggs?\u201D said Carruthers. We wolfed\
    \ down our lunch.\nSuddenly, on the far horizon, we could see them. Far from being\
    \ a thousand, they were just three in number. How in the name of all that is holy\
    \ did they create such a tremendous and terrifying din?\nTwo against three. Carruthers\
    \ and I looked at each other, jutted our jaws, and, in unspoken compact, agreed\
    \ that our chances were better than good.\n\u201CLet us wait until we see the\
    \ whites of their eyes,\u201D I said.\nAnd so we sat awaiting the drummers as\
    \ they slowly approached across the wild and desolate tarputa. To muffle the din,\
    \ I stuffed cotton wool into my ears, and Carruthers plugged his good ear with\
    \ a half-sucked boiled sweet. We smoked our pipes.\nAt last, shortly before dusk\
    \ descended upon the tarputa, we saw the whites of six eyes. I stood up, and shouted.\n\
    \u201CHalt!\u201D I cried, \u201CStep no further, or you will have to answer to\
    \ the might of the Empire and the fury of the Queen! Now cease your infernal drumming\
    \ and tell me who you are and what is your business!\u201D\nAnd then I learned,\
    \ and Carruthers learned, that we had found the Urbane Blodgett Electronic Percussion\
    \ Trio, long thought lost, having vanished somewhere in the vast and desolate\
    \ tarputa twenty years before."
