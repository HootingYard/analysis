    I am delighted to announce a fantastic innovation here at Hooting Yard, the Hooting
    Yard Red Button. It has been developed by a dotcom startup run by twelve-year-olds.
    Here''s how it works:

    While reading the latest effusion pouring out of Mr Key''s head, press the Hooting
    Yard Red Button to reveal a selection of options to enrich your Hooting Yard experience.
    Among them:

    * Automatic translation into Dothraki.

    * Exciting new colour schemes.

    * Background music by Scriabin, Cornelius Cardew, or Xavier Cugat.

    * A virtual fug of fumes from virtual acrid Serbian pipe tobacco.

    * Water on the knee.

    * Invasion of big lumbering magnetic robots from outer space.

    NOTE : This is the "omega" version of the technology, and may not work properly
    on your computer, handheld device, iMonkey, or pneumatic parpophone.'
