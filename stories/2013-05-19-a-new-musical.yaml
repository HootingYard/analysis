  text: "\nYou can learn many things by watching the Eurovision Song Contest. I noted\
    \ some of them the other day at The Dabbler, but here I wish to confess that it\
    \ was only when watching Eurovision that I learned to pronounce Malm\xF6 correctly.\
    \ I had always thought that the final \xF6 rhymed with dough. Now I know that\
    \ it is more accurately a sort of er or uh sound.\nThis new knowledge led me,\
    \ by ways I will not bother to explain, to devise a plan for an exciting piece\
    \ of musical theatre. Now, I have not studied the life and times of Colonel Muammar\
    \ Gaddafi with any great diligence, nor indeed with any diligence at all. What\
    \ I know of the late tyrant was picked up from news reports\u2014print and broadcast\u2014\
    over the years. So I have no idea whether he ever paid a visit to Sweden. If he\
    \ did not, it does not matter, for my musical can be wholly fictional.\nThe basic\
    \ premise of my all-singing all-dancing show is that Gaddafi, on a visit to Sweden's\
    \ southern capital, is presented by the good burghers of Malm\xF6 with an offering\
    \ of myrrh. I realise this has connotations of the baby Jesus being presented\
    \ with myrrh\u2014plus gold and frankincense\u2014by the three Kings of Orion-Tar,\
    \ and that as a result my show might be accused of blasphemy. Well, bring it on!,\
    \ as they say. We are all aware that blasphemy is a splendid way to drum up publicity.\
    \ And Christian blasphemy is nice and safe, and wins plaudits for being \u201C\
    edgy\u201D from the Guardian, unlike blasphemy against Islam, which gets you blown\
    \ up or beheaded and accused of being racist by the Guardian.\nThe main\u2014\
    the only\u2014reason I have devised this show, however, is as a pretext for the\
    \ title Muammar's Malm\xF6 Myrrh. That has a pleasing ring, does it not? The great\
    \ thing about it is that, however clearly and resoundingly you try to enunciate\
    \ the words, you still sound like a toothless inarticulate wretch."
