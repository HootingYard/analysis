  text: "I used to know a man whose name, unusually, was Hot Zinc. His character was\
    \ equally rum. He muttered much in Dutch, while twisting twigs into dollies. Angular\
    \ and emaciated, they were frightening dollies, quite unsuitable for the tiny\
    \ tots who form the standard dolly demographic.\nThe airbag in his car was of\
    \ a wholly new type. It was devised by his cousin. He had dozens of cousins, and\
    \ the name of the airbag designer was Ulf Drib, which is an anagram of bird flu.\
    \ Ulf was a fat fellow who looked as if several of his airbags had exploded within\
    \ him. In May 1968 he threw a pebble at a policeman in Paris. Youthful folly!\
    \ Now he was fat and comfortable and bourgeois and able to manipulate air in wondrous\
    \ ways.\nIt was good thing he did, for Hot Zinc was a terrible driver. He ploughed\
    \ into a gaggle of swans beside a canal. The prototype new airbag saved his life.\
    \ The swans\u2019, not."
