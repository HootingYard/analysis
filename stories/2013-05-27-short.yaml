  text: "I was interested to note that the 2013 Man Booker International Prize was\
    \ awarded to Lydia Davis. She is a writer who specialises in very, very short\
    \ stories\u2014so short they make Mr Key's own effusions seem like mighty epics.\
    \ Could it be that the hermetic and blinkered literary world is at last opening\
    \ up to the odd and the unfamiliar?\nI don't know Lydia Davis's work, other than\
    \ a small selection of stories which appeared in the print edition of the Guardian\
    \ at the weekend. But I am heartened by her success. It may prompt publishers\
    \ to be just a tad more adventurous and\u2014who knows?\u2014I might not be told\
    \ (as I have been, more than once) that I have \u201Cabsolutely no commercial\
    \ potential whatsoever\u201D.\nTo that end, and also as a way of emerging from\
    \ the influenza-racked hiatus that I know has had you lot mired in Hooting Yard-less\
    \ misery for the past week or so, I thought I might have a bash at a few shorter-than-usual\
    \ stories over the next few days. Clearly last year's thousand-words-per-day scheme,\
    \ interesting as it was (at least for me), did not quite capture the zeitgeist.\
    \ All those hundreds of essays were far too long. Cut!"
