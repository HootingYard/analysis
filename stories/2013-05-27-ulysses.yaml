  text: 'Clench your fist in such a way that, when held up against a beam of light
    and casting its shadow upon the wall, it resembles, in silhouette, a stately,
    plump person. Why, as I live and breathe, ''tis Buck Mulligan!

    This is the first step to master should you be determined to interpret James Joyce''s
    Ulysses through the medium of shadow puppetry. Further instructions to follow.

    ADDENDUM : You hardly need reminding that Joyce himself always pronounced the
    title of his book Oo-liss-iss.'
