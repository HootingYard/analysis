  text: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The fox is being pursued by
    tally-ho-ing hunters on horseback. It is so quick a fox that it is soon out of
    sight, having scurried under a hedge and leaped over a ditch and away, away! But
    the lazy dog is now sure to be crushed under the hooves of galloping horses unless
    it moves out of their path. It is a dog equivalent of Pearl White, star of the
    silver screen, who sometimes found herself tied to railway lines as huge locomotives
    thundered implacably towards her. Except that no ropes tie the dog down, merely
    its own lassitude.

    The awful sound of the approaching hooves wakes the lazy dog. It has been asleep,
    dreaming about whatever dogs dream about. It was quite oblivious to the quick
    brown fox which jumped over it at the beginning of our story. Now it opens one
    doggy eye and peers towards the source of the din which has awoken it. Shifting
    its fat bulk oh so slightly on the grass, it lifts one diffident paw in a gesture
    designed to halt the horses in their gallop. Think of a station master holding
    up a flag to halt a train.

    If this were a transcript of an episode of a Pearl White serial, we would end
    here, leaving you in suspense. But, just as the cinematheque audience knows, deep
    down, that Pearl White will not actually be killed under the wheels of the thundering
    locomotive, so you know, deep down, don''t you?, that Mr Key would never gratuitously
    kill a dog. Even a lazy fictional dog.

    So what happens is that, astonishingly, each individual horse spots the raised
    paw of the lazy dog on the lawn, and comes to a jarring stop, in spite of the
    tally-ho-ing promptings of its rider. Indeed, so sudden is the horses'' halting
    that some of the hunters are pitched forward and thrown from their mounts.

    The lazy dog goes back to sleep. The toppled hunters rub their sprains and bruises.
    The horses make standard horsey noises and pad about, as horses do, when left
    to their own devices. Far, far away, the quick brown fox is still going like the
    clappers. It is heading towards a railway line.'
