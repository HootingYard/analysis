  text: 'Curiosity killed the cat. But a cat has nine lives, so one, two, three, four,
    five, six, seven, or even eight instances of overweening and perilous curiosity
    will not prove ultimately fatal. It is the ninth instance that a cat has to worry
    about. But it will not worry, because it is ineradicably stupid. And thus, when
    its curiosity is piqued, for the ninth time, by a stray strand of string or a
    minuscule insect creeping along the wainscot, the cat will not pause to consider
    that this time, ah!, this time, there will be no coming back from the death it
    dallies with. It is not that the cat is brave, reckless, valiant. It is stupid,
    and it cannot count.

    You would do well, then, if you care for a cat, and wish to protect it from harm,
    to teach it elementary arithmetic. Place the cat on a stool, and arm yourself
    with a series of flashcards on which the digits from 1 to 9 are written in clear
    big bold black sanserif. You need not bother with zero. No cat''s brain could
    ever cope with that concept.

    The instruction of cats can prove highly exasperating, so you are advised to take
    some sort of bottled calmative elixir before starting. Drum the digits, and their
    significance, into the cat''s bonce. Check its progress with regular tests. If
    it leaves the stool, for example to pursue a stray strand of wool or a minuscule
    insect on the wainscot or, worse, a birdie in the garden, haul it back, replace
    it on the stool, and give it a ticking off.

    Be warned that there is every possibility you will die before the cat has grasped
    the essentials. But you will die happy in the knowledge that you preserved the
    cat from harm for as long as you could, and left your considerable fortune to
    it in your last will and testament, to ensure it wants for nothing in this mortal
    world.'
