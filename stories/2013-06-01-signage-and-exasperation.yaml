  text: "Here is a piece of signage at the entrance to a school self-esteem \u2018\
    n\u2019 diversity awareness hub in Bermondsey. (Click to enlarge.)\n\nYou will\
    \ note that, upper right, the academy is proud that \u201CStudents [are] able\
    \ to show case their talent in a professional setting\u201D. Walking past the\
    \ sign fairly often, I grew increasingly exasperated, and eventually fired off\
    \ an email:\nIt is really quite appalling, as Prince Charles might say, that your\
    \ sign at the top of Dunton Road is illiterate. \u201CShowcase\u201D is one word,\
    \ not two. Having such an elementary error on what I would suppose to be a \u201C\
    showcase\u201D for your academy is like those shopfronts that boast of a \u201C\
    proffesional\u201D service.\nAre you going to correct it?\nI received the following\
    \ reply:\nDear Mr Key,\nMany thanks for taking the time to email the Academy regarding\
    \ the mistake on our sign at the top of Dunton Road.\nI will raise your concern\
    \ with the company who design and manufacture our signs so that it does not happen\
    \ again.\nWith all good wishes,\nAlan Dane\n    Vice Principal\nYou will not be\
    \ surprised to learn that this only served to increase my exasperation. I wrote\
    \ back:\nIt's not really a case of it being my concern, as if I had sent a complaint\
    \ about an incident. It's a basic error on a public sign on an educational institution.\
    \ Did nobody at the Academy raise \u201Ctheir concern\u201D when the sign was\
    \ delivered?\nYou also seem to be suggesting that it is the fault of some arm's-length\
    \ supplier, though I suppose that evasion of responsibility is all too common\
    \ these days.\nMarvellous news that \u201Cit will not happen again\u201D, but\
    \ the question I asked was whether you were going to correct the existing sign.\n\
    Mr Dane's response?\nDear Mr Key,\nI have asked the design and manufacturing company\
    \ to explain the cause of the error. The matter will then be dealt with by the\
    \ Academy internally.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Dane\nTempting as it was to stride\
    \ into the school, locate Mr Dane's office, and sluice out his brain with some\
    \ kind of cleansing fluid, I contented myself with the following riposte:\nDear\
    \ Mr Dane\nWhat an extraordinary reply. Do you ever engage your brain rather than\
    \ write boilerplate sentences?\nWhy do you need to have the company explain the\
    \ error to you? And what precisely do you mean by \u201Cdealt with\u201D?\nHere\
    \ is the reply I would have thought fitting from an educational establishment.\n\
    \u201CWe now realise that one of our public signs is illiterate and gives a thoroughly\
    \ bad impression of the school. This ought to have been picked up, at least by\
    \ the English-teaching staff, but nobody noticed. Now you have brought it to our\
    \ attention we will tear the sign down and replace it with one that is written\
    \ in correct English.\u201D\nReply came there none. Six months on, the signage\
    \ is still there. It really is appalling."
