  text: "Here is a piece of signage at the entrance to a school self-esteem 'n' diversity\
    \ awareness hub in Bermondsey. (Click to enlarge.)\n\nYou will note that, upper\
    \ right, the academy is proud that \"Students [are] able to show case their talent\
    \ in a professional setting\". Walking past the sign fairly often, I grew increasingly\
    \ exasperated, and eventually fired off an email:\nIt is really quite appalling,\
    \ as Prince Charles might say, that your sign at the top of Dunton Road is illiterate.\
    \ \"Showcase\" is one word, not two. Having such an elementary error on what I\
    \ would suppose to be a \"showcase\" for your academy is like those shopfronts\
    \ that boast of a \"proffesional\" service.\nAre you going to correct it?\nI received\
    \ the following reply:\nDear Mr Key,\nMany thanks for taking the time to email\
    \ the Academy regarding the mistake on our sign at the top of Dunton Road.\nI\
    \ will raise your concern with the company who design and manufacture our signs\
    \ so that it does not happen again.\nWith all good wishes,\nAlan Dane\n      \
    \    Vice Principal\nYou will not be surprised to learn that this only served\
    \ to increase my exasperation. I wrote back:\nIt's not really a case of it being\
    \ my concern, as if I had sent a complaint about an incident. It's a basic error\
    \ on a public sign on an educational institution. Did nobody at the Academy raise\
    \ \"their concern\" when the sign was delivered?\nYou also seem to be suggesting\
    \ that it is the fault of some arm's-length supplier, though I suppose that evasion\
    \ of responsibility is all too common these days.\nMarvellous news that \"it will\
    \ not happen again\", but the question I asked was whether you were going to correct\
    \ the existing sign.\nMr Dane's response?\nDear Mr Key,\nI have asked the design\
    \ and manufacturing company to explain the cause of the error. The matter will\
    \ then be dealt with by the Academy internally.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Dane\n\
    Tempting as it was to stride into the school, locate Mr Dane's office, and sluice\
    \ out his brain with some kind of cleansing fluid, I contented myself with the\
    \ following riposte:\nDear Mr Dane\nWhat an extraordinary reply. Do you ever engage\
    \ your brain rather than write boilerplate sentences?\nWhy do you need to have\
    \ the company explain the error to you? And what precisely do you mean by \"dealt\
    \ with\"?\nHere is the reply I would have thought fitting from an educational\
    \ establishment.\n\"We now realise that one of our public signs is illiterate\
    \ and gives a thoroughly bad impression of the school. This ought to have been\
    \ picked up, at least by the English-teaching staff, but nobody noticed. Now you\
    \ have brought it to our attention we will tear the sign down and replace it with\
    \ one that is written in correct English.\"\nReply came there none. Six months\
    \ on, the signage is still there. It really is appalling."
