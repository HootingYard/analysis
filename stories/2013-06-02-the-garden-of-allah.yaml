  text: "\u201CAllahu Akbar!\u201D I shout, as I deadhead the roses. I am an Islamic\
    \ gardener. The gardens I tend are based upon Islamic principles, and contain\
    \ not a whiff of kaffir filth. No woman shall ever besmirch the gravel paths between\
    \ the flower beds. And whenever a bloom sprouts atop a green stalk, I take my\
    \ combination scimitar-and-secateurs and lop it off, in praise of Allah.\nThe\
    \ only plants I allow to flourish are varieties of Old Man's Beard, including\
    \ Chionanthus virginicus, a tree both medicinal and ornamental, Clematis aristata,\
    \ an Australian climbing plant, Clematis vitalba, another climbing plant, Tillandsia\
    \ usneoides, or Spanish moss, a bromeliad, and Usnea, a type of lichen. Because\
    \ they vaguely resemble an old man's beard, they are suitably Islamic.\nOccasionally\
    \ I am mistaken for a hippy gardener, Steve Hillage of Gong with a spade in place\
    \ of a guitar. I have been told we are like two peas in a pod. But there are no\
    \ peas in my gardens, because peapods do not have beards.\n\nSteve Hillage\_:\
    \ not an Islamic fundamentalist"
