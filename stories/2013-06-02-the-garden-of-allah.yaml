  text: '"Allahu Akbar!" I shout, as I deadhead the roses. I am an Islamic gardener.
    The gardens I tend are based upon Islamic principles, and contain not a whiff
    of kaffir filth. No woman shall ever besmirch the gravel paths between the flower
    beds. And whenever a bloom sprouts atop a green stalk, I take my combination scimitar-and-secateurs
    and lop it off, in praise of Allah.

    The only plants I allow to flourish are varieties of Old Man''s Beard, including
    Chionanthus virginicus, a tree both medicinal and ornamental, Clematis aristata,
    an Australian climbing plant, Clematis vitalba, another climbing plant, Tillandsia
    usneoides, or Spanish moss, a bromeliad, and Usnea, a type of lichen. Because
    they vaguely resemble an old man''s beard, they are suitably Islamic.

    Occasionally I am mistaken for a hippy gardener, Steve Hillage of Gong with a
    spade in place of a guitar. I have been told we are like two peas in a pod. But
    there are no peas in my gardens, because peapods do not have beards.
