  text: 'Our survey of artworks continues with Plenipotentiary With Cornflakes Carton
    And Nightjar. This is a large painting, though I have not measured it, showing,
    as its title indicates, a plenipotentiary with the traditional attributes of his
    office, a cornflakes carton and a nightjar. Executed in scumbled daubs of emulsion
    on a sheet of corrugated cardboard, the plenipotentiary is shown leaning insouciantly
    against a mantelpiece, holding in his right hand a cornflakes carton while a nightjar
    perches atop his head. Stipples of what looks like gouache have been stippled
    hither and thither about the composition to add elan. There is an unseemly smudge
    at the bottom left, above which the painter''s signature has been scribbled with
    a biro, seemingly so hurriedly that it is illegible. The overall style is a combination
    of primitivist, classical, Rococo, expressionist, winsome, cack-handed, and gorgeous.

    This is probably the most important painting in the collection of the toffee apple
    entrepreneur Argvis Bonescrape, who refuses all permission to reproduce it in
    any form.

    You may also enjoy : Biro Scribble With Unseemly Smudge, Nightjar With Plenipotentiary
    And Gouache Stipples, and Cornflakes Carton No. 17. The latter is a conceptual
    artwork and does not actually consist of a cornflakes carton in any form whatsoever,
    other than as an idea nestling in the artist''s brain. We have no current information
    regarding cornflakes cartons numbers one to sixteen, which may not even exist.

    If you would like further information on nightjars, please consult an authoritative
    reference work on ornithology.'
