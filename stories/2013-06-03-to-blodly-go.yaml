  text: 'Our series on the origins of common phrases continues with a look at "to
    blodly go . . ".

    What do we mean when we say "to blodly go . . ."? It is superficially similar
    to "to boldly go", a phrase commonly used when describing the forward motion of
    the USS Enterprise, a spaceship on a five-year mission to explore strange new
    worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, far in the future and, I have
    to tell you, wholly fictional in nature. By contrast, "to blodly go" is a way
    of describing the forward motion of one whose progress is accompanied by a soundtrack
    of tunes by the beat group Blodwyn Pig.

    Unlike boldly going, there are various circumstances in which one may be blodly
    going, and these can be both fictional and non-fictional, that is, real, dammit,
    as real as the large stone kicked by Dr Johnson in order to refute Bishop Berkeley.
    But to consider fictional blodly going first, we might imagine a cinematheque
    film or television programme in which a character is seen in forward motion, from
    point A to point B, while on the soundtrack we hear, say, "The Modern Alchemist"
    or "Backwash" from Blodwyn Pig''s debut album Ahead Rings Out (1969).

    In terms of all-too-real blodly going, this would be seen when a person is lolloping
    along the street with, inserted into their lugholes, the pods attached to a digital
    musical reproduction device such as an mp3 player. Unless they have the volume
    turned up to a barbarous pitch, we would not necessarily know they were listening
    to, for example, "The Squirrelling Must Go On" from Blodwyn Pig''s second album
    Getting To This (1970). We may therefore not know blodly going when we see it.

    Similarly, a person may be driving a car or coach and be listening to a Blodwyn
    Pig recording on their on-board sound system. If the volume is not too loud, and
    they whizz past us as we stand at a bus stop awaiting hopelessly the 666, then
    we will be all unawares that such whizzing is blodly. But it is, it is.

    One of the main differences between boldly going and blodly going is, of course,
    that in the former case Captain Kirk and his crew are zipping across galaxies
    with an attitude of boldness. These people are not shrinking violets who would
    hardly dare say "Boo!" to a goose, or indeed a space-goose. Wherever they go,
    at whatever warp factor, they go there boldly. But with blodly going, the goer
    has much more latitude. Going blodly might mean creeping, gadding, prancing, zooming,
    limping, skulking, zipping, careering, stalking, plodding, staggering or any number
    of other forms of locomotion. The blodliness of the act lies in the accompanying
    soundtrack.
