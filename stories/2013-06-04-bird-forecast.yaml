  text: 'Here is the official Hooting Yard bird forecast for south-east England. Today''s
    guest forecaster is Dame Vera Lynn.

    There''ll be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover tomorrow.

    NOTE : Hooting Yard is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the bird forecasts
    provided by our guests. And quite frankly, Dame Vera has been trotting out precisely
    the same forecast at regular intervals for the past seven decades. As far as we
    are aware, nobody has ever thought to carry out a statistical analysis of the
    accuracy, or otherwise, of her claims. Nor is her methodology at all clear. Certainly
    it is grotesque to think that she makes her pronouncements after "reading" the
    still-throbbing hot entrails of freshly-slaughtered bluebirds, a theory propounded
    by some irresponsible scalliwags in the Dover-based organisation Cliffwatch. Those
    people wouldn''t know a haruspex if one came up and biffed them in the chops.

    Tomorrow''s bird forecast will be presented by special guest Dame Vera Lynn.'
