  text: "I am reading A Double Life, Sarah Burton's 2003 biography of Charles and\
    \ Mary Lamb, and have been delighted by a couple of names mentioned therein.\n\
    One of the Lamb's relatives lived in a Hertfordshire cottage called, splendidly,\
    \ Button Snap. It is still there, a listed building, so I may have to go and violently\
    \ drive out the current tenants or owners and move in myself.\nGone, however,\
    \ is a pub at 17 Newgate Street in the City of London called The Salutation And\
    \ Cat, where Charles Lamb used to get squiffy with his pal Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\
    \ According to Walter Thornbury in Old And New London (1878), the pub was named\
    \ after an \u201Codd combination of two incongruous signs\u201D. Over the road\
    \ was another pub with the equally intriguing name of The Magpie And Stump.\n\
    Both Sarah Burton and Walter Thornbury remind us of Coleridge's youthful folly\
    \ in enlisting in the army. He did so under the pseudonym Silas Tompkin Comberbache.\
    \ Some years ago I linked to a site (now vanished*) which contained this brief\
    \ reference to his military service:\nAs a rider, his attempts ended frequently\
    \ in disaster: \u201CWithin this week I have been thrown three times from my Horse,\
    \ and run away with to no small perturbation of my nervous system.\u201D He developed\
    \ saddle sores, \u201Cdreadfully troublesome eruptions, which so grimly constellated\
    \ my Posteriors.\u201D\n\nButton Snap\n*ADDENDUM : Not so. There is a (revised)\
    \ link to the site in the comments. Thanks to Dave Lull and others who pointed\
    \ out my error."
