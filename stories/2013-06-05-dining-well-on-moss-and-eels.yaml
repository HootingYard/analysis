  text: "I put some sphagnum in a pot.\n  I boiled it 'til it was hot.\n  I spooned\
    \ it out onto a plate.\n  And then I sat me down to wait.\nI waited 'til the moss\
    \ was cold.\n  I did precisely as I'd been told\n  In a book of recipes for sphagnum\
    \ meals,\nDining Well On Moss And Eels.\nRather, a pamphlet, not a book.\n  By\
    \ Dobson, who claimed to be a cook\n  In the prefatory piece\n    He'd written\
    \ to these recipes.\nThis poem, by F X Urg, is the sole reference in all world\
    \ literature to Dobson's semi-mythical recipe book. The titanic pamphleteer of\
    \ the twentieth century always denied having written it, and not even the most\
    \ indefatigable of Dobsonists has been able to find any trace of it, in either\
    \ printed or manuscript form.\nIt would thus be simple to dismiss the poem as\
    \ one of F X Urg's lurid phantasies, were it not that Dobson is on the record\
    \ as having eaten both sphagnum moss and eels for breakfast on innumerable occasions.\
    \ In his pamphlet A Tally Of All The Breakfasts I Have Tucked Into Over The Past\
    \ Sixteen Years (out of print), Dobson regularly mentions sphagnum and eels, sometimes\
    \ in combination, as in this extract:\n15 June 1954. Breakfast today was eels\
    \ stuffed with boiled and shredded sphagnum, washed down with dandelion and burdock\
    \ spiked with runny egg.\nIt is quite plausible, then, that the out of print pamphleteer\
    \ might at some point have turned his hand to such a recipe book. But if he did,\
    \ why did he so vehemently deny it? And his denials were certainly vehement. A\
    \ hot empurpled face, spitting, screeching, and the jabbing of his fists at his\
    \ interlocutor were common responses whenever Dobson was asked about the existence\
    \ of the book. Russell Hartyplus, for one, wisely steered clear of the topic when\
    \ he interviewed Dobson for an episode of his TV series Interviews With Pamphleteers,\
    \ contenting himself with questions about hot air balloons, moles, and gas giants,\
    \ the subjects of Dobson's three most recent pamphlets, all now out of print.\n\
    An answer to the puzzle possibly lies in ferreting out further information about\
    \ the lurid phantasist F X Urg. This could prove problematic, however, as the\
    \ poem reproduced above is the only known trace of him in all world literature."
