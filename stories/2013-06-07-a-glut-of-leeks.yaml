  text: "Looking back on my life, I believe one of the greatest challenges I ever\
    \ had to face was when I found myself in possession of a glut of leeks. It was\
    \ the first\u2014so far the only\u2014time fate brought me to such a pass, so\
    \ it is no wonder that I was at sixes and sevens. And let me assure you that I\
    \ had many, many more leeks than six or seven. I had a glut of them, and I did\
    \ not know what to do.\nWith hindsight, I can see clearly that I was wholly unprepared.\
    \ But that was not something I wished to admit to myself, in my vigorous youth.\
    \ Living as I did in a fool's paradise, I thought there was nothing I could not\
    \ achieve. In spite of my perplexity, I was confident I could find some use for\
    \ a glut of leeks before they began, as cruel nature demanded, to rot.\nI tried\
    \ out various schemes, some seemingly sensible, others wild and unhinged. No matter\
    \ what I did, I was making no serious depredations to the glut. The leeks I had\
    \ were countless, so I did not attempt to count them. The glut remained a glut.\n\
    Then, one day, I received news of an impending visit from my spiritual adviser,\
    \ lifestyle coach, and tobogganing partner, the dwarf Crepusco. Heaven forfend,\
    \ I thought, that he should have to fight his way through a glut of leeks simply\
    \ to reach the armchair I reserved for him anent the radiator. (Crepusco suffered\
    \ dreadfully from the cold.) Thus it was that I cobbled together a sort of pulley\
    \ system and hoisted each and every leek in the glut up from the floor so it dangled\
    \ from the ceiling.\nUnfortunately, so low was my ceiling in that place at that\
    \ time, that I, being taller than a dwarf, found myself, when standing, in the\
    \ midst of dangling vertical leeks. My vision was occluded, and I had to jostle\
    \ my way through them blindly. No such terrors for the dwarf Crepusco, who sailed\
    \ past me, sat himself in the armchair, and, as I had hoped he would, dispensed\
    \ advice.\n\u201CAs your spiritual adviser,\u201D he said, \u201CI have nothing\
    \ to say. As your tobogganing partner, I note we are due to make a run down a\
    \ mighty crevasse next Thursday. And as your lifestyle coach, let me just say\
    \ that I am deeply impressed by your innovative interior design initiative. A\
    \ room with hanging leeks in profusion is both piquant and leeky, and is that\
    \ not a combination anyone sensitive to interior design would kill for?\u201D\n\
    I blundered against the dado rail, doing myself a mischief, but I had to acknowledge\
    \ his wisdom.\nSome while later, of course, the leeks did rot, but by then I had\
    \ made a name for myself as a piquant and leeky interior designer, and I never\
    \ looked back.\n"
