  text: "\nOver in my cupboard at The Dabbler today, I sing the praises of Matzo the\
    \ Bookshop Dog. This is a fairly blatant piece of advertising for Woolfson & Tay,\
    \ the independent bookshop\u2014now moved from Bermondsey Square to Bankside\u2014\
    which, in 2011, hosted that memorable, indeed imperishable, Evening Of Lugubrious\
    \ Music & Lopsided Prose. I urge those of you who live within a thousand-mile\
    \ radius to visit the shop regularly, and buy books, and drink tea, and eat cake."
