    Over in my cupboard at The Dabbler today, I sing the praises of Matzo the Bookshop
    Dog. This is a fairly blatant piece of advertising for Woolfson & Tay, the independent
    bookshop--now moved from Bermondsey Square to Bankside--which, in 2011, hosted
    that memorable, indeed imperishable, Evening Of Lugubrious Music & Lopsided Prose.
    I urge those of you who live within a thousand-mile radius to visit the shop regularly,
    and buy books, and drink tea, and eat cake.'
