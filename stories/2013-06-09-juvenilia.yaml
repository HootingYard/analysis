  text: 'My sister recently unearthed a trunk crammed with stuff from forty years
    ago, when she moved to the United States. It had remained unopened since she moved
    to her present address some thirty years ago. Within, among other things, she
    found a notebook containing some early writings by Mr Key.

    Here is the beginning of a piece called "-En". I should point out that I have
    absolutely no memory of it at all. The notebook is undated, but I would guess
    it to be from the mid-1970s. That being so, it is no surprise to find it imbued
    with the earnest seriousness of teenpersonhood, though I am pleased to note that
    it includes a hint of the love of words for their own sake. Make of it what you
    will.
