  text: 'It was a dark and stormy night. I wrapped myself in my cloak and took my
    dagger, and I crept through the dark insalubrious alleyways until I came to a
    doorway. I pushed it open and entered a room full of smoke and mirrors. Through
    a glass darkly, I hatched a plot.

    It was a complicated, secret, and fiendish plot, and if it succeeded, crowned
    heads would topple. If, on the other hand, it did not succeed, and I was caught
    in flagrante, then the only head likely to topple would be my own. I was fond
    of my head. Like Neville Chamberlain''s, it was oddly-shaped, but it was my head,
    the only head I would ever have. I was keen for it not to be toppled, and so I
    went over and over and over the details of my plot with my co-conspirators, in
    the room full of smoke and mirrors.

    We tested the plot for flaws. Whichever way we looked at it, it seemed sound.
    It could perhaps have been slightly more dastardly than was the case, and that
    would have been a boon, but we did not wish to unleash the hounds of uncertainty.
    I had been pursued and attacked by these hounds in the past, and had been lucky
    to escape with my head. It was Lloyd George, I think, who said Chamberlain''s
    head was odd, though now I check my sources I see he said it was a "wrong-shaped
    head". Mine, I would say, is odd, but not wrong. It is of standard human head
    shape, more or less.

    Seen through a glass darkly, however, my head becomes distorted, as things will
    do when seen through dark glass in a room full of smoke and mirrors. I try not
    to let this upset me, reminding myself that it is merely a visual trick, and the
    real head, the solid one perched on my neck, is not so distorted, albeit it is
    a trifle odd. And I have to say that, in comparison to the heads of some of my
    co-conspirators, my head is well-proportioned and nearly flawless.

    The plot, though, now that is absolutely flawless. We have plotted and plotted
    and plotted and we cannot spot a single flaw in it. At dawn, we will lie in wait
    for the prince behind a splurge of shrubbery. As his carriage passes, we will
    leap out, in our cloaks, and plunge our daggers into him. Those are the bare bones
    of the plot. From what I can gather from its depiction on postage stamps, the
    prince''s head is neither odd nor wrong-shaped. It is a pretty average princely
    type of head, though wet behind the ears.

    Dawn, then, will bring not just a new day, but a new era of world-shuddering revolution!

    NOTE : The narrator of the above piece failed to spot the obvious flaw in his
    plot. The prince had an extensive network of spies, ever on the lookout for bands
    of ne''er-do-wells wrapped in cloaks and wielding daggers, meeting in rooms full
    of smoke and mirrors in dark insalubrious alleyways. That the ne''er-do-wells
    all had odd and wrong-shaped heads made them all the more conspicuous. They were
    arrested shortly before dawn, and hurled into oubliettes, where they languish
    still, forced to lick postage stamps showing the beauteous head of the prince.'
