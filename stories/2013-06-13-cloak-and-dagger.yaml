  text: "It was a dark and stormy night. I wrapped myself in my cloak and took my\
    \ dagger, and I crept through the dark insalubrious alleyways until I came to\
    \ a doorway. I pushed it open and entered a room full of smoke and mirrors. Through\
    \ a glass darkly, I hatched a plot.\nIt was a complicated, secret, and fiendish\
    \ plot, and if it succeeded, crowned heads would topple. If, on the other hand,\
    \ it did not succeed, and I was caught in flagrante, then the only head likely\
    \ to topple would be my own. I was fond of my head. Like Neville Chamberlain's,\
    \ it was oddly-shaped, but it was my head, the only head I would ever have. I\
    \ was keen for it not to be toppled, and so I went over and over and over the\
    \ details of my plot with my co-conspirators, in the room full of smoke and mirrors.\n\
    We tested the plot for flaws. Whichever way we looked at it, it seemed sound.\
    \ It could perhaps have been slightly more dastardly than was the case, and that\
    \ would have been a boon, but we did not wish to unleash the hounds of uncertainty.\
    \ I had been pursued and attacked by these hounds in the past, and had been lucky\
    \ to escape with my head. It was Lloyd George, I think, who said Chamberlain's\
    \ head was odd, though now I check my sources I see he said it was a \u201Cwrong-shaped\
    \ head\u201D. Mine, I would say, is odd, but not wrong. It is of standard human\
    \ head shape, more or less.\nSeen through a glass darkly, however, my head becomes\
    \ distorted, as things will do when seen through dark glass in a room full of\
    \ smoke and mirrors. I try not to let this upset me, reminding myself that it\
    \ is merely a visual trick, and the real head, the solid one perched on my neck,\
    \ is not so distorted, albeit it is a trifle odd. And I have to say that, in comparison\
    \ to the heads of some of my co-conspirators, my head is well-proportioned and\
    \ nearly flawless.\nThe plot, though, now that is absolutely flawless. We have\
    \ plotted and plotted and plotted and we cannot spot a single flaw in it. At dawn,\
    \ we will lie in wait for the prince behind a splurge of shrubbery. As his carriage\
    \ passes, we will leap out, in our cloaks, and plunge our daggers into him. Those\
    \ are the bare bones of the plot. From what I can gather from its depiction on\
    \ postage stamps, the prince's head is neither odd nor wrong-shaped. It is a pretty\
    \ average princely type of head, though wet behind the ears.\nDawn, then, will\
    \ bring not just a new day, but a new era of world-shuddering revolution!\nNOTE\_\
    : The narrator of the above piece failed to spot the obvious flaw in his plot.\
    \ The prince had an extensive network of spies, ever on the lookout for bands\
    \ of ne'er-do-wells wrapped in cloaks and wielding daggers, meeting in rooms full\
    \ of smoke and mirrors in dark insalubrious alleyways. That the ne'er-do-wells\
    \ all had odd and wrong-shaped heads made them all the more conspicuous. They\
    \ were arrested shortly before dawn, and hurled into oubliettes, where they languish\
    \ still, forced to lick postage stamps showing the beauteous head of the prince."
