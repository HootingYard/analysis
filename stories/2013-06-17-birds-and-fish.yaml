  text: "A letter plops on to the mat from Tim Thurn:\nOi, Mr Key! You seem to know\
    \ an immense amount about birds, yet virtually nothing about fish. Is there any\
    \ reason for this disparity? If so, I am agog to know, agog I tell you!\n  Passionately\
    \ yours,\n  Tim Thurn\nOften with Tim's letters, I find the best thing to do is\
    \ to ball them up in my fist, scrunch them a few times, and then deposit them\
    \ in the waste paper basket. Occasionally, after the scrunching, I drop them directly\
    \ down a waste chute, if, for example, the waste paper basket is overflowing,\
    \ as it sometimes is, or, even if space remains in the waste paper basket, I feel\
    \ impelled to cast the letter as far from me as possible, to obliterate it from\
    \ my sight.\nThere is always the possibility, you see, that if I put the scrunched\
    \ letter into the waste paper basket, I might, while it languishes there, hoick\
    \ it out and unscrunch it, and unball it up, if that is a phrase, and reread it.\
    \ Once it has plunged down a waste chute, it is gone forever, of course, or at\
    \ least its retrieval is made a matter of great complexity, necessitating the\
    \ involvement of various municipal waste management personnel, who may or may\
    \ not demand bribes or other favours in order to send one of their number, or\
    \ some kind of scuttling robot, down into the midden to rummage for Tim's scrunched\
    \ letter.\nUsually when I discard Tim's letters so promptly it is because they\
    \ are annoying. He can be a very exasperating correspondent, and I think he takes\
    \ a curious pride in being so. I may be wrong on that point, but I don't think\
    \ I am. Some people gain a great deal of pleasure from being annoying, and Tim\
    \ is one of them. I believe he sits there, wherever it is he lives, picturing\
    \ in his mind's eye me, huffing and puffing, balling up and then scrunching his\
    \ latest letter, tossing it into a waste paper basket or down a waste chute, and\
    \ then going to have a lie down in a darkened room to recover from the mental\
    \ disturbance he has caused me. I, in my turn, lie there in the dark picturing\
    \ in my mind's eye Tim Thurn, chuckling, or chortling, or even guffawing, fatuously,\
    \ as he imagines my irritation. I impute fatuity to his laughter because this\
    \ makes it more vivid, and hateful.\nHaving no idea what Tim looks like, I have\
    \ to rely on my imagination. Sometimes he is as thin as a rake, angular, and seedy,\
    \ with unseemly stains on his clothing. At other times he is a tubby kind of fellow,\
    \ smug and goofy, and seedy, with unseemly stains on his clothing. Once I was\
    \ so damned livid after reading one of his letters that I decided to consult a\
    \ graphologist who could, from Tim's handwriting, fashion a convincing portrait\
    \ of him, the possession of which would help me visualise his despicable chuckling\
    \ chortling guffawing fatuity all the more vividly. Unfortunately, Tim confounded\
    \ me by typing his letters, which rather put paid to my plan.\nIt would be wrong,\
    \ however, to think that all of Tim's missives are equally annoying. Some of them\
    \ are not annoying at all. Those ones I do not ball up and scrunch and dispose\
    \ of, but instead lay out flat upon the blotting pad upon my desk, and I reread\
    \ them, carefully, while composing, in my head, a reply. Such was the case with\
    \ the one cited above, regarding birds and fish. It was an unexceptionable, vaguely\
    \ polite, query, and I thought it deserving of a civil response. Of course, I\
    \ did not want to give anything away. I do not want Tim Thurn, or anybody else\
    \ for that matter, peering into the innards of my head to see what lurks within.\
    \ Whether or not I know the first thing about birds or fish is my business, and\
    \ nobody else's.\nSo, though it called for a polite response, I could not answer\
    \ Tim's question directly. I would have to craft my reply as carefully as I read\
    \ and reread the letter--that is, very carefully indeed. Eventually, fuelled by\
    \ a slurp of Dr Baxter's Invigorating Brain Syrup, I worked out precisely what\
    \ to write. First, though, I called on my priest to ascertain how many years I\
    \ would have to languish in purgatory were I to be less than truthful, or, to\
    \ put it bluntly, to tell a barefaced lie. Apprised of this information, which\
    \ seemed not too onerous, I wrote:\nDear Mr Thurn\n    Thank you for your delightful\
    \ and not at all annoying letter. I am afraid that, somewhere on its journey between\
    \ your postbox and my doormat, it was gnawed and nibbled by squirrels or some\
    \ such small skittering mammals, and much of the content destroyed or rendered\
    \ illegible. The only surviving text is \"an immense amount about birds\" and\
    \ \"I am agog to know\". Might I suggest that, grammatically, it would be better\
    \ to place those phrases in reverse order? That being so, I would happily bombard\
    \ you with whatever it is you wish to learn about, for example, swifts and swallows\
    \ and geese and starlings and linnets and partridges and quail and woodpeckers\
    \ and teal and pratincoles and thrushes and warblers and auks and guillemots and\
    \ shearwaters and spoonbills and skuas and albatrosses and swans and pigeons and\
    \ owls and penguins and rooks and crows and dunnocks and pipits and ostriches\
    \ and cassowaries and grebes and divers and cranes and egrets and sandpipers and\
    \ cuckoos and parrots and waders and gulls and nightjars and cockatoos and budgerigars\
    \ and petrels and fulmars and bitterns and herons and moorhens and pelicans and\
    \ kestrels and cormorants, especially cormorants, and hobbies and kites and rails\
    \ and eagles and bustards and corncrakes and peahens and plovers and lapwings\
    \ and wrynecks and curlews and terns and doves and grouse and razorbills and parakeets\
    \ and hummingbirds and wrens and magpies and jackdaws and, at a push, chickens.\
    \ Let me know in a bit more detail which birds are of particular interest to you.\n\
    \    Yours carefully,\n    Mr Key"
