  text: "Last time I bumped into a ragged-trousered philanthropist in the street,\
    \ I berated him for his dishevelment. Would it not be meet, I suggested, were\
    \ he to pay more attention to his toilet? I held before his eyes the image of\
    \ Beau Brummell, as an exemplar of attention to detail in masculine dress. Do\
    \ you think for one minute, I keened, that Brummell would ever have stepped out\
    \ of doors wearing ragged trousers?\nBut Brummell was not a philanthropist, countered\
    \ the ragged-trousered philanthropist, and he pressed a coin into my palm. I realised\
    \ he had mistaken me for a mendicant. It is true that my own apparel was somewhat\
    \ raggedy, but I can admire Beau Brummell without attempting to emulate him.\n\
    Here, have your coinage back, I said, I have no need of it.\nUngrateful swine!,\
    \ shouted the philanthropist, and he slapped my face. The slap was done with his\
    \ bare hand. Had it been a glove, I would have taken it as a challenge to engage\
    \ in a duel. As he refused to take back his coin, I tossed it into the gutter.\n\
    Let a guttersnipe profit from your philanthropy, I said, rubbing my cheek, and\
    \ away I pranced, in the bitter sunshine.\nAt the corner, I paused, and turned,\
    \ and waited until the ragged-trousered philanthropist was out of sight. Then\
    \ I hastened back to retrieve the coin from the gutter. Before I could do so,\
    \ however, an eagle-eyed guttersnipe, attracted by its silvery glint, appeared\
    \ from nowhere and scooped it up.\nI brandished my stick and beat the urchin insensible.\
    \ I prised the coin from his grasp and then rifled through his filthy pockets\
    \ to find what treasures lay therein. String, elastic bands, paper clips, a boiled\
    \ sweet, but no more coinage. I left the guttersnipe, battered and bloody, in\
    \ the gutter, and went on my way, in the bitter sunshine.\nExercise\_: The narrator\
    \ is clearly wallowing in a moral sewer. Describe this sewer, as vividly as you\
    \ are able, and populate it with other figures, both historical and fictional,\
    \ who you think are likely to be found there."
