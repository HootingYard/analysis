  text: "The organic things\u2014Italo-Semitico-Mongoloid\u2014inhabiting that awful\
    \ cesspool could not by any stretch of the imagination be call'd human. They were\
    \ monstrous and nebulous adumbrations of the pithecanthropoid and amoebal; vaguely\
    \ moulded from some stinking viscous slime of earth's corruption, and slithering\
    \ and oozing in and on the filthy streets or in and out of windows and doorways\
    \ in a fashion suggestive of nothing but infesting worms or deep-sea unnamabilities.\
    \ They\u2014or the degenerate gelatinous fermentation of which they were composed\u2014\
    seem'd to ooze, seep and trickle thro\u2019 the gaping cracks in the horrible\
    \ houses . . and I thought of some avenue of Cyclopean and unwholesome vats, crammed\
    \ to the vomiting-point with gangrenous vileness, and about to burst and inundate\
    \ the world in one leprous cataclysm of semi-fluid rottenness.\nFrom that nightmare\
    \ of perverse infection I could not carry away the memory of any living face.\
    \ The individually grotesque was lost in the collectively devastating; which left\
    \ on the eye only the broad, phantasmal lineaments of the morbid mould of disintegration\
    \ and decay . . a yellow and leering mask with sour, sticky, acid ichors oozing\
    \ at eyes, ears, nose and mouth, and abnormally bubbling from monstrous and unbelievable\
    \ sores at every point . . .\nH. P. Lovecraft describes Manhattan's Lower East\
    \ Side in a letter to Frank Belknap Long, cited in H. P. Lovecraft\_: Against\
    \ The World, Against Life by Michel Houellebecq (1991, 2005)"
