  text: 'The organic things--Italo-Semitico-Mongoloid--inhabiting that awful cesspool
    could not by any stretch of the imagination be call''d human. They were monstrous
    and nebulous adumbrations of the pithecanthropoid and amoebal; vaguely moulded
    from some stinking viscous slime of earth''s corruption, and slithering and oozing
    in and on the filthy streets or in and out of windows and doorways in a fashion
    suggestive of nothing but infesting worms or deep-sea unnamabilities. They--or
    the degenerate gelatinous fermentation of which they were composed--seem''d to
    ooze, seep and trickle thro'' the gaping cracks in the horrible houses . . and
    I thought of some avenue of Cyclopean and unwholesome vats, crammed to the vomiting-point
    with gangrenous vileness, and about to burst and inundate the world in one leprous
    cataclysm of semi-fluid rottenness.

    From that nightmare of perverse infection I could not carry away the memory of
    any living face. The individually grotesque was lost in the collectively devastating;
    which left on the eye only the broad, phantasmal lineaments of the morbid mould
    of disintegration and decay . . a yellow and leering mask with sour, sticky, acid
    ichors oozing at eyes, ears, nose and mouth, and abnormally bubbling from monstrous
    and unbelievable sores at every point . . .
