  text: 'It is high time I wrote something profound. To do so has always been within
    my gift, of course, it is just that I have neglected it. Oh, every single day
    I am beset by thoughts of great profundity, though admittedly these may oft be
    mistaken for platitudes, truisms, or mad ravings.

    This morning, for example, as I awoke with the sunrise, at approximately half
    past four, the first thing that came into my head was the phrase "All roads lead
    to Rome". How profound that is. We could, if we wished, worry away at it for hours
    and hours, like a cat with a strand of wool, and, unlike the cat, we would forever
    find new insights, new angles, unfathomable depths of wisdom and, yes, profundity.
    The cat, by contrast, being ineradicably stupid, would forget whatever it had
    learned about the strand of wool thirty seconds ago. I am sometimes envious of
    cats. Imagine how exciting life must be, to be so stupid!

    Unfortunately, with my pea-sized yet pulsating brain, I am able to fret and fiddick
    about the five words "All roads lead to Rome" for hour after hour. I can draw
    from them profound insights about history and geography and the nature of what
    it means to be human, and much else besides. I can become lost in profundity.

    By the way, I made up that word "fiddick". Or at least, I commandeered the surname
    of the last editor of the much-lamented The Listener, Peter Fiddick, to serve
    as a verb meaning something along the lines of fretting at and worrying at something,
    as a cat might fret and worry at a strand of wool, as a fool might fret at an
    old adage. But you knew what I meant, didn''t you?'
