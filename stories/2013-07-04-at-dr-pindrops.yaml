  text: "So hushed was the consulting room of Dr Pindrop that you could hear a pin\
    \ drop. Thus, at the moment I dropped a pin, I coughed loudly, to camouflage the\
    \ ping! of its landing on the linoleum. Now all I had to do was to wait for Dr\
    \ Pindrop to come in. I whistled an approximation of the song of the masked shrike,\
    \ Lanius nubicus, getting into character as Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe RAF,\
    \ portrayed by Donald Pleasence in The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963). When\
    \ Dr Pindrop entered, he would be in the role of Flight Lieutenant Robert Hendley\
    \ DFC RAF, played in the film by James Garner. We would enact, albeit imperfectly,\
    \ the poignant scene where it becomes apparent that Blythe is virtually blind,\
    \ what with the eye-strain brought on by all that diligent counterfeiting of papers\
    \ and passports and what have you.\nBut when Dr Pindrop pushed open the door and\
    \ entered his consulting room, I saw something was up. Unlike Blythe, my vision\
    \ was not occluded. Indeed, it was so piercing that I could count each individual\
    \ furrow on the troubled brow of Dr Pindrop, though I was waiting at the far end\
    \ of the room.\n\u201CI am so sorry, Blodweg,\u201D said Dr Pindrop, \u201CSomething\
    \ has come up and I have no time to take part in our reenactment of a classic\
    \ film scene.\u201D\n\u201CWhat is the matter?\u201D I asked.\n\u201COh, you need\
    \ not worry your odd-shaped little head about the titanic responsibilities of\
    \ an important physician,\u201D he said, \u201CSuffice to say I shall be spending\
    \ the rest of the day applying probes to the brains of guinea pigs.\u201D\nI complained\
    \ that this left me at something of a loose end, just when I had entered what\
    \ I think of as \u201Cthe zone\u201D. In that zone, I was Donald Pleasence, or\
    \ Colin Blythe, or some exquisite amalgam of the two.\n\u201CI understand your\
    \ concern,\u201D said Dr Pindrop, in that mollifying tone he usually employs at\
    \ the bedsides of the stricken, \u201CBut listen, out there in the waiting room\
    \ are all my guinea pigs, sitting quietly. You could deliver Blythe's ornithology\
    \ lecture, from earlier in the film, and whistle the song of the masked shrike,\
    \ Lanius nubicus.\u201D\n\u201CTo guinea pigs?\u201D I asked, aghast.\n\u201C\
    They are human guinea pigs,\u201D said Dr Pindrop.\nI had to admit that this was\
    \ a splendid idea, and meant that my intellectual and emotional straining to become\
    \ Donald Pleasence / Colin Blythe would not go to waste.\n\n\u201CBefore you go,\u201D\
    \ said Dr Pindrop, \u201CPick up that pin you dropped earlier, would you?\u201D\
    \nAs I went to retrieve it, he stuck out his leg and tripped me over. We had enacted\
    \ the classic film scene, albeit imperfectly, after all!\nThrilled with my performance,\
    \ and still in character, I went out into the waiting room to tell the human guinea\
    \ pigs about birds. But they were no longer sitting quietly. They had been corralled\
    \ into a corner of the waiting room by Dr Pindrop's receptionist, Mrs Creasefrock,\
    \ who was toting a submachine gun. It took me a matter of moments to realise that\
    \ she was in \u201Cthe zone\u201D as Hans Gruber, the criminal mastermind from\
    \ Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988) played by Alan Rickman.\n\u201CMrs Creasefrock!\u201D\
    \ I cried, \u201CI had no idea you too were a member of the Classic Action Film\
    \ Scene Reenactment Society!\u201D\nShe fired a burst of ammo into the ceiling\
    \ and looked me over.\n\u201CNice suit,\u201D she said, \u201CJohn Phillips, London.\
    \ I have two myself. Rumour has it Arafat buys his there.\u201D\nGosh, she really\
    \ was in the zone! I had to think fast. This was no scene for Donald Pleasence.\
    \ On the spur of the moment, I decided to shift character to one of Hans Gruber's\
    \ team of ruthless criminals, and I ran and crashed through the plate-glass window\
    \ of Dr Pindrop's waiting room, plummeting several storeys before landing with\
    \ a terrific thump on a police car parked below, shattering the windscreen\n\u201C\
    Hello!\u201D, I said to the startled driver, \u201CYou must be Sergeant Al Powell,\
    \ played by Reginald VelJohnson.\u201D\nI rubbed at my eyes to dislodge a fragment\
    \ of the shattered windscreen.\n\u201CCan I help you?\u201D said the driver.\n\
    \u201COh no, please, it's only something in my eye,\u201D I said.\n\u201CPlease\
    \ let me look. I happen to be a doctor,\u201D he said, and I realised he was the\
    \ general secretary of the Classic Romantic Film Scene Reenactment Society. He\
    \ was not Sergeant Al Powell. He was in the zone as Dr Alec Harvey, played by\
    \ Trevor Howard in Brief Encounter (David Lean, 1945)!\nIt took all my thespian\
    \ skills to slough off, in an instant, both Colin Blythe and a member of a German\
    \ criminal gang.\n\u201COh, why must we be so withdrawn and shy and . . . difficult?\u201D\
    \ I said. The sun was shining on the nothing new."
