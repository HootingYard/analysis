  text: "Mary Bousted, leader of one of the teachers\u2019 unions, was on the radio\
    \ the other day giving her views on the planned new national curriculum. Obviously\
    \ she disapproved of it, because the teachers\u2019 unions automatically disapprove\
    \ of any and all revisions suggested by the government, whichever government is\
    \ in power. What was striking, however, was one of her principal objections. The\
    \ new curriculum, she warned darkly, is \u201Criddled with knowledge\u201D.\n\
    Heaven forfend that the teachers in our schools self-esteem \u2018n\u2019 diversity\
    \ awareness hubs should be expected to impart knowledge to the tinies!\nI am left\
    \ speechless, but will merely note that Mary Bousted attended a grammar school\
    \ and bears the title of \u201CDoctor\u201D. I think she must have been taught\
    \ some \u201Cknowledge\u201D somewhere along the line."
