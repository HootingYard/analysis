  text: 'Mary Bousted, leader of one of the teachers'' unions, was on the radio the
    other day giving her views on the planned new national curriculum. Obviously she
    disapproved of it, because the teachers'' unions automatically disapprove of any
    and all revisions suggested by the government, whichever government is in power.
    What was striking, however, was one of her principal objections. The new curriculum,
    she warned darkly, is "riddled with knowledge".

    Heaven forfend that the teachers in our schools self-esteem ''n'' diversity awareness
    hubs should be expected to impart knowledge to the tinies!

    I am left speechless, but will merely note that Mary Bousted attended a grammar
    school and bears the title of "Doctor". I think she must have been taught some
    "knowledge" somewhere along the line.'
