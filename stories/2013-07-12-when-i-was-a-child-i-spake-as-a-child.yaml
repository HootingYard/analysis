  text: "A. N. Wilson begins a book review in The Spectator with this splendid anecdote:\n\
    Ronald Knox, found awake aged four by a nanny, was asked what he was thinking\
    \ about, and he replied \u201Cthe past\u201D.\nA remark with a similar weight\
    \ of world-weariness was made by my eldest son, when he was but a tot. Having\
    \ contracted some sort of stomach bug, he vomited. As we mopped his fevered brow,\
    \ he wailed \u201COh, why can't I have a happy life?\u201D"
