  text: 'A. N. Wilson begins a book review in The Spectator with this splendid anecdote:

    Ronald Knox, found awake aged four by a nanny, was asked what he was thinking
    about, and he replied "the past".

    A remark with a similar weight of world-weariness was made by my eldest son, when
    he was but a tot. Having contracted some sort of stomach bug, he vomited. As we
    mopped his fevered brow, he wailed "Oh, why can''t I have a happy life?"'
