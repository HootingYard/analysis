  text: 'I think I have written before about my dislike of the busie old foole, unruly
    sun, and its pitiless battering heat. Proper Hooting Yard weather is an overcast
    sky with a hint of drizzle. It may well be that this current mini-heatwave is
    what has caused the lack of sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose at your favourite
    website. I am listless and enervated, possibly even neurasthenic.

    Anyway, at times like this, I find it can be useful to spur myself back into action
    by reading the titanic prose of past masters. Here is Thomas Nashe, from his final--and
    fabulous--work, Nashe''s Lenten Stuff (1599):

    That good old blind bibber of Helicon, I wot well, came a-begging to one of the
    chief cities of Greece, & promised them vast corpulent volumes of immortality
    if they would bestow upon him but a slender out-brother''s annuity of mutton &
    broth, and a pallet to sleep on, and with derision they rejected him, whereupon
    he went to their enemies with the like proffer, who used him honourably, and whom
    he used so honourably that to this day, though it be three thousand year since,
    their name and glory flourish green in men''s memory through his industry. I trust
    you make no question that those dull-pated pennyfathers, that in such dudgeon
    scorn rejected him, drunk deep of the sour cup of repentance for it when the high
    flight of his lines in common bruit was oyezed. Yea, in the word of one no more
    wealthy than he was (wealthy, said I? nay, I''ll be sworn he was a grand-juryman
    in respect of me) those greybeard huddle-duddles and crusty cumtwangs were struck
    with such stinging remorse of their miserable Euclionism and snudgery, that he
    was not yet cold in his grave but they challenged him to be born amongst them,
    and they and six cities more entered a sharp war about it, every one of them laying
    claim to him as their own'
