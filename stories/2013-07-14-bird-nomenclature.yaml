  text: 'From Greg Ross at Futility Closet, I learn that an eriff is a two-year-old
    canary. Why there should be a specific word for a two-year-old canary is a deep
    and abiding mystery, at least to me.

    And Thomas Nashe, in his Lenten Stuff, suggests that another name for a kestrel
    is a windfucker.'
