  text: 'So eminently quotable is Thomas Nashe that I have decided to post a passage
    from his Lenten Stuff every day while I am reading it--The Daily Nashe, if you
    will. The Stuff is, among other things, a paean of praise to Great Yarmouth--though
    it appears he was sorely tempted to go further afield:

    I had a crotchet in my head here to have given the reins to my pen, and run astray
    throughout all the coast towns of England, digging up their dilapidations and
    raking out of the dust-heap or charnel-house of tenebrous eld the rottenest relic
    of their monuments, and bright scoured the canker-eaten brass of their first bricklayers
    and founders, & commented and paralogized on their condition in the present, &
    in the preter tense, not for any love or hatred I bear them, but that I would
    not be snibbed, or have it cast in my dish that therefore I praise Yarmouth so
    rantantingly because I never elsewhere baited my horse, or took my bow and arrows
    and went to bed.
