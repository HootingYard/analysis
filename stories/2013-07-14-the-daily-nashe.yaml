  text: "So eminently quotable is Thomas Nashe that I have decided to post a passage\
    \ from his Lenten Stuff every day while I am reading it\u2014The Daily Nashe,\
    \ if you will. The Stuff is, among other things, a paean of praise to Great Yarmouth\u2014\
    though it appears he was sorely tempted to go further afield:\nI had a crotchet\
    \ in my head here to have given the reins to my pen, and run astray throughout\
    \ all the coast towns of England, digging up their dilapidations and raking out\
    \ of the dust-heap or charnel-house of tenebrous eld the rottenest relic of their\
    \ monuments, and bright scoured the canker-eaten brass of their first bricklayers\
    \ and founders, & commented and paralogized on their condition in the present,\
    \ & in the preter tense, not for any love or hatred I bear them, but that I would\
    \ not be snibbed, or have it cast in my dish that therefore I praise Yarmouth\
    \ so rantantingly because I never elsewhere baited my horse, or took my bow and\
    \ arrows and went to bed.\n"
