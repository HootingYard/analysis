  text: "Here at Hooting Yard we are, as you know, ever vigilant for news of lethal\
    \ or otherwise miscreant cows. We could not fail to take note of the alarming\
    \ tale of the Brazilian man killed by a cow falling through his roof.\nElsewhere,\
    \ though it is hardly \u201Cnews\u201D, we learn from a list of children detained\
    \ in a Worcestershire insane asylum between 1854 and 1900 that one poor little\
    \ tot was there because he or she was \u201Cfrightened by a cow\u201D. Whatever\
    \ terrors the cow may have provoked pale beside an entry further down the list,\
    \ which tells us that another mite was placed in the asylum after \u201Cbeing\
    \ put inside a recently killed pig\u201D. To which one can only respond with a\
    \ blood-curdling \u201Ceek!\u201D."
