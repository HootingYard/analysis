  text: And did those feet? Well, did they? I don't give two pins about the time,
    whether it was in ancient time or modern time or some other time, I just want
    to know if those feet did, and if they did, what it was, exactly, that they did.
    I suppose you will tell me that they walked. Lawks-a-mercy!, I'd never have guessed.
    Those feet walked, did they? Take me to the foot of our stairs! And don't get
    me started on that holy lamb of God. If I catch sight of it I'll have it sheared
    and its fleece spun and knitted into a pair of woolly socks before you can say
    Jack Spraggins. And I will put those socks on my feet and I will walk, yes, I
    will walk upon England's mountains green. Just try to stop me, buster.
