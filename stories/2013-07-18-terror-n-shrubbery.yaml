  text: "I have just started reading a collection of stories by Marcel Schwob (translated\
    \ by Iain White) and was pleasantly startled by the opening sentence of \u201C\
    Train 081\u201D:\nThe great terror of my life seems far distant from the shrubbery\
    \ in which I am writing.\nMarcel Schwob (1867\u20131905) was a friend of Alfred\
    \ Jarry, and the dedicatee of Ubu Roi. I may have more to say as I read the book,\
    \ The King In The Golden Mask & Other Writings (1982).\n"
