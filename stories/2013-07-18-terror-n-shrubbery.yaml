  text: 'I have just started reading a collection of stories by Marcel Schwob (translated
    by Iain White) and was pleasantly startled by the opening sentence of "Train 081":

    The great terror of my life seems far distant from the shrubbery in which I am
    writing.

    Marcel Schwob (1867-1905) was a friend of Alfred Jarry, and the dedicatee of Ubu
    Roi. I may have more to say as I read the book, The King In The Golden Mask &
    Other Writings (1982).
