text: "I have just started reading a collection of stories by Marcel Schwob (translated\
  \ by Iain White) and was pleasantly startled by the opening sentence of \u201CTrain\
  \ 081\u201D:\nThe great terror of my life seems far distant from the shrubbery in\
  \ which I am writing.\nMarcel Schwob (1867\u20131905) was a friend of Alfred Jarry,\
  \ and the dedicatee of Ubu Roi. I may have more to say as I read the book, The King\
  \ In The Golden Mask & Other Writings (1982).\n"
