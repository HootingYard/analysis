  text: 'Newspaper reports of the annual swan upping on the Thames reminded me of
    an amusing swan-related matter which I had unaccountably forgotten to mention.
    During the Wimbledon tennis championships, I forget which game exactly though
    it may have been one of the men''s semi-finals, during one of the breaks between
    sets, the BBC cameras drifted off to the surrounding scene, and showed a jetty
    by the river around which sunbathers sprawled. Also present was a swan, approached
    by a tiny tot who looked as if she was wanting to feed it a sandwich. The proximity
    of tot to swan led one of the commentary team to observe that, belying their elegance
    and grace, swans are of course savage and aggressive creatures. Whereupon fellow-commentator
    Tim Henman--whose surname suggests he knows a thing or two about birds, or at
    least about poultry--said (and I paraphrase from memory):

    Whenever you see a swan, someone always points out that they are capable of breaking
    your arm. Have you ever met anybody who''s had their arm broken by a swan? I haven''t.

    Sadly, the cameras then returned to the tennis, and we were not treated to any
    further swan-talk from Hen-man.
