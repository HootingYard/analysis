  text: "In the introduction to his Les Vies Imaginaires (1896)\u2014a profound influence\
    \ upon Borges\u2014Marcel Schwob writes:\nIf Boswell's book took up ten pages\
    \ it would be the book we were looking for. Doctor Johnson's common sense comprises\
    \ the vulgarest of commonplaces: expressed with the bizarre violence that Boswell\
    \ has the art to depict, it has a quality unique in this world. Only this ponderous\
    \ catalogue resembles the doctor's dictionary; from it one could extract a Scientia\
    \ Johnsoniana with an index. Boswell has not had the aesthetic courage to select.\n\
    (Translation by Iain White.)\nI was delighted to note, elsewhere in the introduction,\
    \ that Schwob makes mention of \u201Cthe conjectures to which Boswell abandons\
    \ us concerning the use Johnson made of the dried orange-peel he liked to keep\
    \ in his pockets\u201D\u2014as noted recently here.\nNB\_: Hooting Yard's in-house\
    \ anagrammatist R. will, I hope, get to work on the title of this postage."
