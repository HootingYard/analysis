  text: 'In the introduction to his Les Vies Imaginaires (1896)--a profound influence
    upon Borges--Marcel Schwob writes:

    If Boswell''s book took up ten pages it would be the book we were looking for.
    Doctor Johnson''s common sense comprises the vulgarest of commonplaces: expressed
    with the bizarre violence that Boswell has the art to depict, it has a quality
    unique in this world. Only this ponderous catalogue resembles the doctor''s dictionary;
    from it one could extract a Scientia Johnsoniana with an index. Boswell has not
    had the aesthetic courage to select.

    (Translation by Iain White.)

    I was delighted to note, elsewhere in the introduction, that Schwob makes mention
    of "the conjectures to which Boswell abandons us concerning the use Johnson made
    of the dried orange-peel he liked to keep in his pockets"--as noted recently here.

    NB : Hooting Yard''s in-house anagrammatist R. will, I hope, get to work on the
    title of this postage.'
