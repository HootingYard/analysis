  text: "\nI have never watched a single episode of the BBC soap opera EastEnders,\
    \ so I had no idea who Cockney matriarch Lou Beale was. I do, however, read obituaries\
    \ with great interest, including those of people of whom I have never heard. And\
    \ when reading the Guardian obituary of Anna Wing, the actress who played Lou\
    \ Beale, I learned that \u201Cbetween 1953 and 1960, she was the partner of the\
    \ surrealist poet Philip O'Connor\u201D and \u201Cshe encouraged [him] to write\
    \ his first book, the extraordinary Memoirs of a Public Baby (1958)\u201D.\nI\
    \ had never heard of O'Connor either, and my interest was piqued\u2014rightly\
    \ so, I realised, when I read his 1998 obituary in The Independent. Here I learned,\
    \ among other things, that his mother abandoned him twice during his childhood,\
    \ and the second time\nhe was again adopted, this time by a one-legged bachelor\
    \ civil servant who wore size 13 boots and owned a small wooden hut on Box Hill\
    \ near Dorking\nand that\nThe impression that he created as a young man in wartime\
    \ Fitzrovia was of utter precariousness. As thin as a skeleton, his face already\
    \ eroded, his smile never calm, he lived off doughnuts and Woodbines, ogled at\
    \ women and spoke in cryptograms, spoonerisms and jingles, delivering sentences\
    \ backwards and falling about in drunken exhilaration\nand\nMany people knew him\
    \ simply as The Man Who Stood Behind The Door And Said \u201CBoo!\u201D To T.S.\
    \ Eliot\nWho could read those snippets and not want to read the Memoirs? So I\
    \ borrowed a copy from the library, and am already delighted, by page 35, to learn\
    \ that Philip O'Connor had \u201Ca lasting fear of monkeys . . . feeling horribly\
    \ near to them and that I have a secret they might discover which would involve\
    \ me in some unconscious activity consequent upon the discovery of a bond between\
    \ us.\u201D\nSelf-consciously \u201Cbohemian\u201D drunkard poets are tiresome,\
    \ particularly when convinced of their own genius, and no doubt in person O'Connor\
    \ was\u2014as Stephen Spender says in his introduction to the Memoirs\u2014\u201C\
    a menace\u201D. But they can also, sometimes, write wonderful books, and Memoirs\
    \ Of A Public Baby\u2014what I have read of it so far\u2014is one. Bear in mind,\
    \ too, that the Independent obituary notes that O'Connor \u201Cdabbled interestingly\
    \ with chickens\u201D."
