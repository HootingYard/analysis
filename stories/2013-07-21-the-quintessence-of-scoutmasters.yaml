  text: "A snippet from Memoirs Of A Public Baby by Philip O'Connor:\nThe hut on the\
    \ hill was in a fairly detached part of a holiday camp, the most \u201Cselect\u201D\
    \ of several on this hill in Surrey. The signs of this selectiveness were the\
    \ wide spaces between the huts; their decorum in colour and lack of fantasy in\
    \ architecture; and the absence of radios (though the loudspeaker was still young),\
    \ and the quality and size of the cars arriving at week-ends; and the good-quality\
    \ plus-fours of the younger set. They were, in fact, of the class most disliked\
    \ by my guardian, mostly prosperous shopkeepers, with a sprinkling of teachers,\
    \ whom he also didn't like. It fairly pleased him not to like anyone in the camp\
    \ except a certain scoutmaster. This was the quintessence of scoutmasters, and\
    \ I feel certain he came from Roehampton, because of a particular greenhouse wildness\
    \ in his appearance (I caught him acquiring a tropical tan artfully behind a bush\
    \ once). He liked to stand most erect on the brow of the plateau and scan the\
    \ horizon, eyes narrowed, ready, I believe, for eventualities."
