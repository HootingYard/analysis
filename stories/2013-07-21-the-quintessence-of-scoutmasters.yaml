  text: 'A snippet from Memoirs Of A Public Baby by Philip O''Connor:

    The hut on the hill was in a fairly detached part of a holiday camp, the most
    "select" of several on this hill in Surrey. The signs of this selectiveness were
    the wide spaces between the huts; their decorum in colour and lack of fantasy
    in architecture; and the absence of radios (though the loudspeaker was still young),
    and the quality and size of the cars arriving at week-ends; and the good-quality
    plus-fours of the younger set. They were, in fact, of the class most disliked
    by my guardian, mostly prosperous shopkeepers, with a sprinkling of teachers,
    whom he also didn''t like. It fairly pleased him not to like anyone in the camp
    except a certain scoutmaster. This was the quintessence of scoutmasters, and I
    feel certain he came from Roehampton, because of a particular greenhouse wildness
    in his appearance (I caught him acquiring a tropical tan artfully behind a bush
    once). He liked to stand most erect on the brow of the plateau and scan the horizon,
    eyes narrowed, ready, I believe, for eventualities.'
