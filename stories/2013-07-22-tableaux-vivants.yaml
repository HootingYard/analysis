  text: 'My latest project is to stage a series of tableaux vivants. These will take
    place daily over the coming week. Each one will last for a duration of no more
    than one minute, at a push, at various locations in the hustle and bustle of the
    London streets, what Keith Pratt termed "the hurly-burly of the urban conurbation",
    and each one will be a vivid, static, solo re-enactment of a significant historical
    event. I have thus far chosen six subjects:
