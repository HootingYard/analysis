  text: 'On Farming Today on BBC Radio 4 this morning, I heard the following piece
    of rustic wisdom, or perhaps it was a spell or incantation:

    I see the chicken--good thing happens.

    I have decided to test this by taking the first opportunity that presents itself
    to look at a chicken. I will then wait for something good to happen, and--whatever
    the eventuality--will report back, in vivid detail.
