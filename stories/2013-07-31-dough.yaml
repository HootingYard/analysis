  text: "Dough, a dear, a female dear, a dear one, made out of dough. This was the\
    \ bold conception of Istvan, the eerie Mitteleuropean baker whose pastry shop\
    \ was hidden down an insalubrious alleyway in an insalubrious provincial town\
    \ at the foot of a huge important mountain range. You will find it on most maps.\n\
    Lugubrious, insanitary, and topped by a pudding basin haircut, Istvan was beset\
    \ by constant pangs. He longed for companionship. Alas, he was a stranger to that\
    \ paradise of which the Brothers Johnson sang, the Land of Ladies. Though there\
    \ were many women among his customers, they all hurried away as soon as they had\
    \ bought their baked goods, alarmed and distressed by Istvan's unbecoming personal\
    \ appearance, his filthy manners, and his lack of charm.\nSo it was that he decided\
    \ to make his longed-for dearest out of dough. Ignorant of women, he chose as\
    \ his model a nun, specifically Maria in The Sound Of Music, played by Julie Andrews.\
    \ Having prepared sufficient dough for a life-size nun, he kneaded and kneaded\
    \ and moulded it into shape. When he was done, he placed it in a reclining position\
    \ on the sofa in the back room of his pastry shop.\nAnd so, for a while, his evenings\
    \ were happy, happier than they had ever been. He would sit at one end of the\
    \ sofa, his hand patting his dough companion gently, and he would talk to it,\
    \ or sit in contented silence. He no longer felt alone. And \u201CMaria\u201D\
    \ was unabashed by his lugubrious and insanitary person, did not look askance\
    \ at his pudding basin haircut, and tolerated his filthy manners.\nBut Istvan\
    \ grew dissatisfied. His pangs returned, more intense than ever, for he wished\
    \ that his dough dear would do more than merely sprawl on the sofa. How much dearer\
    \ she would be if she were a true companion, one who laughed and sang and helped\
    \ out with the baking of pastries! If only she could be imbued, Frankenstein-fashion,\
    \ with the spark of life!\nAnd then one day into the pastry shop came a mysterious\
    \ wizardy type of fellow, swathed in a black cape and wearing a pointy hat. He\
    \ made purchase of some Mitteleuropean pastry delicacies, but before he swished\
    \ his cape and strode away, Istvan dared to ask him if by any chance he knew of\
    \ spells to bring to life a nun made out of dough. I do indeed, said the wizard.\n\
    A bargain was struck, and Istvan ushered the mysterious fellow into the back room.\
    \ He stood over the dough nun on the sofa, slowly waving his arms in strangely\
    \ significant passing movements, and babbling gibberish. Istvan looked on, goggle-eyed,\
    \ which made his appearance even more unbecoming than usual. When he was finished,\
    \ the wizardy man turned to Istvan and told him that the final stage of the spell,\
    \ the part that would bring his dough dear to life, was to bake the dough in a\
    \ pre-heated oven on 220\xBAC, 200\xBAC\_for fan-assisted ovens, or Gas Mark 7,\
    \ for 40 minutes. And then he swept out of the back room, swishing his black cape,\
    \ out of the front door and into the insalubrious alleyway in the insalubrious\
    \ provincial town, in the shadow of an important mountain range, and Istvan never\
    \ saw him again.\nBarely able to contain his excitement, the eerie baker picked\
    \ up his dough dear from the sofa and cradled her in his arms, then shoved her\
    \ into the oven, which was already preheated, what with all the baking the baker\
    \ did. For the next forty minutes, Istvan sat gazing at the hands of his Mitteleuropean\
    \ cuckoo clock, ticktocking through the time with agonising slowness. At last\
    \ the baking time elapsed. But just as Istvan was about to open the oven, the\
    \ door swung open from inside. Of course! His dough dear was alive! Out she would\
    \ step, into his arms!\nBut in the baking, the transformation was greater than\
    \ Istvan could have imagined. It was not a living dough Julie Andrews that emerged\
    \ from the oven. It was a living pastry Christopher Plummer! As it lumbered towards\
    \ Istvan, it plucked from nowhere a guitar, and began to sing \u201CEdelweiss\u201D\
    . The baker fell back upon his sofa, stricken with horror.\nThey found him there\
    \ the next morning, his unbecoming features twisted in an awful rictus. Of the\
    \ pastry Christopher Plummer, there was no sign, though some say that, on clear\
    \ bright days when the air is still, he can be heard singing in the mountains\
    \ that loom over the insalubrious provincial Mitteleuropean town.\n\nDon't forget\
    \ you can donate to keep the wolf from Mr Key's door."
