  text: 'As you know, I am currently keeping my eye out for chickens. Thanks, then,
    to Ruthie Bosch for sending me this snap of a chicken alongside a smoking child,
    from a century or so ago. I will probably receive a stern directive from some
    governmental agency insisting that I airbrush the gasper out of the photograph,
    but history is history. Weirdly, it seems that in the early twentieth century
    not everyone was in thrall to some kind of Blairite-Cameronian-Third-Way-Consensus,
    in spite of what the BBC tells us. (See Lark Rise To Candleford, and any other
    period drama.)
