  text: "Yet again, Hooting Yard demonstrates that it has its finger on the pulse,\
    \ is tapping into the zeitgeist, setting the agenda, and alighting upon what are\
    \ unfortunately called the \u201Ctrending\u201D topics before they are trendy.\
    \ No sooner does Mr Key turn his gimlet (if myopic) eye to the subject of chickens,\
    \ when suddenly everyone is at it.\nIn his Dabbler Diary on Monday, Brit wrote\
    \ about the unimaginable number of chickens slaughtered daily worldwide. Nige\
    \ addressed the important topic of chicken sexing. And in the paper the other\
    \ day I learned of a play entitled, brilliantly, Knives In Hens. I am not a theatre-going\
    \ person, so I had never heard of this \u201Cbrutal fable set in a timeless spartan\
    \ rural community\u201D, but apparently it is a \u201Cmodern Scottish classic\u201D\
    .\nWhat next in the world o\u2019 poultry? We wait with bated breath . . ."
