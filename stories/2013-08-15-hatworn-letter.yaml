  text: "Kenya correspondent Bill Hatworn was one of the very greatest letter-writers\
    \ of the twentieth century. Although most of his correspondence has already been\
    \ gathered in the forthcoming Collected Letters Of Bill Hatworn, new items continue\
    \ to come to light, including this unsigned and undated example, sent to an unknown\
    \ recipient:\nMeet me at the fireworks factory. I'll be wearing red. You in your\
    \ shoes, and me at the end of my tether. Speak to me\u2014fourteen words. You\
    \ can make them up. I will listen, but I won't swim in your muddy waters. Truth,\
    \ or grit, or something foreign to my senses\u2014you had better see me right\
    \ re: my expenses. I paid through the nose and it hurt me much, but where I goes\
    \ is such and such."
