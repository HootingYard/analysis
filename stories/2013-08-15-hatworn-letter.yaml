  text: 'Kenya correspondent Bill Hatworn was one of the very greatest letter-writers
    of the twentieth century. Although most of his correspondence has already been
    gathered in the forthcoming Collected Letters Of Bill Hatworn, new items continue
    to come to light, including this unsigned and undated example, sent to an unknown
    recipient:

    Meet me at the fireworks factory. I''ll be wearing red. You in your shoes, and
    me at the end of my tether. Speak to me--fourteen words. You can make them up.
    I will listen, but I won''t swim in your muddy waters. Truth, or grit, or something
    foreign to my senses--you had better see me right re: my expenses. I paid through
    the nose and it hurt me much, but where I goes is such and such.'
