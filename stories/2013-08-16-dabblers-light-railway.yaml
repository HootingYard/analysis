    In my Dabbler cupboard this week I make a convincing argument that the names of
    the stations on the Docklands Light Railway are as worthy of having their own
    dedicated forecast on the radio as those oh so evocative shipping areas.

    And while we are on the subject of BBC Radio 4, I should note that I learned something
    very fascinating on Farming Today this morning. Apparently, on no account whatsoever
    should you ever tell anybody how many sheep you have, even if they have the gall
    to come out and ask you directly. Remember that.'
