  text: 'A second, previously undiscovered, letter by Kenya correspondent Bill Hatworn
    has surfaced. It was found in a junk shop in Junkshop.

    I want my art to be in cars, or somewhere lacking proper food. You know the sort
    of place I mean. One book contains my art and crap. I sit and sweat in sordid
    bars, or on a stack of broken wood. I''m dumb. Barbaric. I am keen. My art''s
    my life. My life''s my trap. You''ll always make me very sick. It''s not your
    lips, it''s not your hair. I spat out the cake you bought for me. These are the
    boys. These are the girls. This is the torch. This is the stick. This is the foliage
    and this is the chair. This is the lumberjack hacking a tree. This is the worst
    of all possible worlds. My rake, your spade, here''s our vegetations. We hop and
    stammer by ourselves. I want to share the flu I''ve caught. Your raincoat''s the
    colour of the windowsill. I''m cross, or am I doing the stations? All I hear is
    the clank of bells. I''m so tall and you''re horribly short. You''re unspeakable.
    My name''s Bill.'
