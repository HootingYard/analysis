  text: 'My recent lassitude--which I think is now behind me--was occasioned in part
    by ResonanceFM''s August break. I realise that having to babble into a microphone
    for half an hour every week is an effective spur to composition, and without that
    deadline I can happily gaze out of the window at crows and Not Get Anything Done.

    (Oh, by the way, throughout the month ResonanceFM is broadcasting old episodes
    of Hooting Yard daily at 12.30 PM, so that should help to keep you lot from chewing
    your pillows in anguish.)

    Anyway, just as I was sloughing off my indolence and clambering back into my toboggan
    o'' prose, I was further inspired by being asked to write a piece for another
    blog. Meeting someone else''s deadline always concentrates the mind.

    So over at BlackberryJuniper & Sherbet you can read a brand new piece--written
    yesterday--together with a little introduction explaining why I was asked, and
    one reader''s understanding of the Glory That Is Hooting Yard. Off you go!'
