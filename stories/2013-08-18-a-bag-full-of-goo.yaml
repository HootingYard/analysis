    In her mad poem Daddy, Sylvia Plath makes mention of "a bag full of God". I have
    always taken this to be a misprint. If we consider that God is inexplicable and
    ineffable, outwith the scope of our puny human comprehension, then the idea that
    we could get hold of Him and stuff Him into a bag is plainly laughable. We can
    apply David Hume''s argument against miracles, where he writes "When anyone tells
    me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself,
    whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived,
    or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened". Similarly, we
    may ask which is more probable, that somebody has managed to cram God into a bag,
    or that a typesetting error has occurred? I am as sure as eggs is eggs that what
    Plath originally wrote was "a bag full of Goo". A slapdash printer made "Goo"
    into "God", and the error has persisted for half a century.

    Now it is true that goo is more often found in bottles and jars and squeezy tubes
    than in bags. But there are so many different types of goo, for so many different
    purposes, that a bag full of goo is still a far more likely proposition than a
    bag full of God. Just wander along the aisles of your nearest supermarket and
    you will see goos for cleaning, for cooking, for cosmetic purposes, and for all
    sorts of other uses. Too, goo can vary from thick pastes to semi-liquid gloop,
    and no matter what its consistency, any goo can be transferred from its original
    container into a bag, be it a plastic bag, a paper bag, a greaseproof paper bag,
    a satchel, a haversack, a pippy bag, or any sort of bag you care to mention.

    While we can only guess at the type of bag Sylvia Plath has in mind--and I strongly
    favour the duffel bag theory--we are on firmer ground when it comes to the goo.
    For, later in the mad poem, the mad poet specifically refers to "gobbledygoo".
    Quite what the nature of this goo is must remain a matter of conjecture. In the
    context of the poem, it has some connection to the Luftwaffe, the German word
    for national military aviation services. Might gobbledygoo, then, be some kind
    of lubricant goo for aeroplane engines? If so, that would explain why, when I
    went to my local supermarket and asked at the customer services counter if they
    stocked gobbledygoo, I was met with blank looks of incomprehension. Aeroplane
    engine lubricant goo is not the kind of goo you will find in even the best-appointed
    supermarket or general goods store.

    Such fearless textual analysis casts Daddy in a new light, and will necessitate
    the urgent revision of the thousands of scholarly books and articles about poor
    mad Sylvia--so get to work, litcrit persons!

    One final note : goo must not be confused with goop, which is a digital media
    and e-commerce company founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, who is inexplicable and ineffable
    and outwith the scope of our puny human comprehension.'
