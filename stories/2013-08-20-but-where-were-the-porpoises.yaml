  text: 'a man named Jason Pennington . . . [spotted] a car full of smoke on the side
    of the 101 freeway where he saw an elderly man hunched over at the wheel of his
    Jaguar

    It would be interesting to know if Mr Pennington is, in fact, half-man, half-porpoise.

    Thanks to Sharon Smith for alerting me to this eerily familiar headline.'
