  text: 'I could speak to you today about pine and plane and sycamore and larch, but
    instead I wish to focus your attention upon ash and box and elm and yew. Ash.
    Box. Elm. Yew. Four trees in alphabetical order. It is not necessarily the best
    order in which to arrange trees, certainly not if one were planting an orchard,
    but for our present purposes it will do, it will do. Each is a three-letter word
    for a tree, each has a trunk and leafage and, of course, roots. These are not
    the roots of which Alex Haley wrote, but gnarled and twisting roots which anchor
    the ash or the box or the elm or the yew in place, wherever that place may be.
    It is the presence of roots, under the tree, submerged in the muck, that account
    for your inability to push the tree over with one mighty heave.

    So when we consider the ash and the box and the elm and the yew we must keep in
    the forefront of our minds that they are rooted, anchored, not easily toppled.
    This helps us to tell them apart from toppleable things, which are countless.
    There are more things in the world that topple over than do not. I would have
    you take a few moments to think about that.

    You, for example, are the sort of thing that could be toppled, while standing
    there lost in thought. You might be knocked over by a ferociously high wind, shoved
    by a shover, or suffer from a sudden and catastrophic weakness at the knees. In
    certain circumstances, the same is indeed true of ash and box and elm and yew.
    High winds have toppled trees, shovers armed with chainsaws have toppled them,
    even weakness in a tree-trunk, caused by blight or disease, can topple a tree.
    The point I am making is that it is much easier to topple you than it is to topple
    a tree. Unlike a tree, you are not rooted to the ground, at least not in your
    natural state.

    Do not confuse the homophones you and yew, by the way.

    It is not just trees with three-letter names that require might and main to topple
    them. The aforementioned pine and plane and sycamore and larch are also firmly
    rooted. The reason they do not concern us today is that their names contain more
    than three letters. When dealing with a subject as wide-ranging and breathtaking
    and complicated as trees, we have to focus our attentions more narrowly if we
    are to get anywhere, at least in the short term. Only those with the most fanatical
    interest will go the whole hog and devote the best part of their lives to the
    study of trees. The rest of us must make do with partial, limited knowledge. We
    will wish to be sufficiently familiar with certain types of tree so that we can
    hold our own in a tree-based conversation.

    For example, we might be at a swish and sophisticated cocktail party and be buttonholed
    by a person who, to break the ice, says something regarding trees.

    "It is interesting you should say that," we can reply, winningly, "For just the
    other day I read a piece about the ash and the box and the elm and the yew."

    "Oh really?" says our interlocutor, and before we know it the two of us are babbling
    away nineteen to the dozen and getting on like a house on fire. Such social success
    is always rewarding. Had we not had a ready reply, we might have been left flailing
    and dimwitted, clutching our cocktail glass and flushing with discomfort.

    It is not overwhelmingly important to be able to tell an ash from a box or an
    elm from a yew or a box from an elm or a yew from an ash or a box from a yew or
    an ash from an elm. If you can do so, all well and good, but depending on the
    company at the cocktail party you are attending you might want to keep that knowledge
    under your hat. If you begin to prattle on in detail about the trees and their
    characteristics you might be taken for a fanatic with no interest in, or knowledge
    of, any other topic. Nobody wants to get stuck next to a monomaniac at a cocktail
    party.

    Conversely, if you are the one who finds yourself trapped with a tree-fanatical
    nutcase, intent on describing to you in brain-numbing detail the ash and the box
    and the elm and the yew, you can always topple over. They will interpret this
    as a swoon, and call for smelling salts and perhaps a snifter of brandy. You can
    then sit up and rub your head and look disconcerted. You might be ushered outside
    for a spot of fresh air, and if the party is taking place in a rustic location,
    there could be a coppice or spinney nearby. But in your fragile state, or let
    us say your pretence of a fragile state, nobody, not even the nutcase, will call
    on you to identify the trees, which may or may not include the ash, the box, the
    elm, the yew.'
