    My cupboard at The Dabbler this week includes a seagull, a squirrel, and a refrigerator--each
    of them pertinent to the lives of twentieth-century noteworthies. There are noteworthies
    from past centuries, too, in extracts from my forthcoming magnum opus Brief Lives.
    I suspect it will be a long, long time forthcoming. I need to build up a card
    index.'
