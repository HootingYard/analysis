  text: "In Victoria Of England (1936), Edith Sitwell tells us\nthe Queen's sympathies\
    \ were aroused when, towards the end of August 1892, Mr Gladstone had a miraculous\
    \ escape from the sinister attentions of a cow. It appears from a letter written\
    \ to the Queen by Mrs Gladstone that this highly reprehensible animal rushed at\
    \ Mr Gladstone and threw him upon his back, after which she stood over him, glaring\
    \ in a most threatening manner. Mr Gladstone glared back, and some moments had\
    \ been spent in this mutual pursuit before the statesman, who, according to his\
    \ wife, had never lost his presence of mind for a moment, was able to rise to\
    \ his feet and dart behind a tree\u2014whereupon the cow forgot him immediately\
    \ and strolled away. The cow was shot.\nIn this respect, if no other, David Blunkett\
    \ is the Gladstone de nos jours."
