  text: "I have paid little attention to the current kerfuffle at the BBC. As stated\
    \ previously, I am intensely relaxed about the fact that some people have far\
    \ more money than I will ever have, and I cannot bestir myself to get in a flap\
    \ about it. It is of course preposterous that the ex-Deputy Director General was\
    \ given a million pound payoff in order to keep him focussed on his decisively\
    \ important work (or words to that affect) but, heigh ho, that is the way of the\
    \ world and to expect any better is to live in a fool's paradise.\nAt the same\
    \ time, I can be roused to a sort of impotent armchair-based fury when these ridiculously\
    \ overpaid persons make public display of their own witlessness and stupidity.\
    \ Consider Ian Katz, lately the deputy editor of the Guardian and now installed\
    \ as the editor of BBC's Newsnight. I do not know how much he is paid but it is\
    \ no doubt a sum beyond my wildest dreams.\nKatz is the latest in a long line\
    \ of supposedly intelligent persons who is unable to master the difference between\
    \ sending a private message and broadcasting it to the entire world. In his editorial\
    \ role, he apparently sent a \u201Ctweet\u201D in which he said a Labour shadow\
    \ minister was boring\u2014for which he later apologised. Frankly, I couldn't\
    \ care less. It is the sentence that followed the accusation that bothers me.\
    \ Katz wrote:\nplayout was fun tho, wasn't it? telly MUCH better than snooooozepapers\
    \ innit\nLet me remind you. This man was deputy editor of a serious newspaper\
    \ and is now editor of a flagship current affairs programme. No doubt he would\
    \ say he is being playful and \u201Cironic\u201D. But for him to even think of\
    \ writing\u2014and then actually to write\u2014such infantile twaddle is profoundly\
    \ depressing.\nKatz should be locked in a cupboard with a copy of The Anatomy\
    \ Of Melancholy, and taken out at intervals to have his brain sluiced. Then he\
    \ might begin to earn a tiny fraction of what he is paid."
