  text: 'I have paid little attention to the current kerfuffle at the BBC. As stated
    previously, I am intensely relaxed about the fact that some people have far more
    money than I will ever have, and I cannot bestir myself to get in a flap about
    it. It is of course preposterous that the ex-Deputy Director General was given
    a million pound payoff in order to keep him focussed on his decisively important
    work (or words to that affect) but, heigh ho, that is the way of the world and
    to expect any better is to live in a fool''s paradise.

    At the same time, I can be roused to a sort of impotent armchair-based fury when
    these ridiculously overpaid persons make public display of their own witlessness
    and stupidity. Consider Ian Katz, lately the deputy editor of the Guardian and
    now installed as the editor of BBC''s Newsnight. I do not know how much he is
    paid but it is no doubt a sum beyond my wildest dreams.

    Katz is the latest in a long line of supposedly intelligent persons who is unable
    to master the difference between sending a private message and broadcasting it
    to the entire world. In his editorial role, he apparently sent a "tweet" in which
    he said a Labour shadow minister was boring--for which he later apologised. Frankly,
    I couldn''t care less. It is the sentence that followed the accusation that bothers
    me. Katz wrote:

    playout was fun tho, wasn''t it? telly MUCH better than snooooozepapers innit

    Let me remind you. This man was deputy editor of a serious newspaper and is now
    editor of a flagship current affairs programme. No doubt he would say he is being
    playful and "ironic". But for him to even think of writing--and then actually
    to write--such infantile twaddle is profoundly depressing.

    Katz should be locked in a cupboard with a copy of The Anatomy Of Melancholy,
    and taken out at intervals to have his brain sluiced. Then he might begin to earn
    a tiny fraction of what he is paid.'
