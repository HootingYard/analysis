  text: 'This is a brief housekeeping post which will be of interest only to those
    who follow Hooting Yard on Twitter. I should first of all explain that I never
    go anywhere near that site, all the Hooting Yard updates--2.084 to date--being
    automatically generated every time I update the blog.

    That said, after blowing my raspberry of contempt at Ian Katz it occurred to me
    that it would be a splendid idea if someone tweeted that particular postage at
    him. I would do so myself if I knew how. But in investigating the matter, and
    thus--for once--going to my Twitter page, I discovered, lawks amercy!, that various
    people who have been "following" me have sent me messages, asked me questions,
    or generally attempted to engage in conversation. All of these have of course
    been ignored because I have never seen them.

    I do not wish these clearly very perspicacious folk to think ill of me for not
    responding to them. So, my apologies, but in future I would recommend adding comments
    here on the blog to those of you who wish to communicate. I am not sure I can
    face the Twitter experience on a regular basis.'
