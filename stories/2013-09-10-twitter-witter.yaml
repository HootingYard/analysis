  text: "This is a brief housekeeping post which will be of interest only to those\
    \ who follow Hooting Yard on Twitter. I should first of all explain that I never\
    \ go anywhere near that site, all the Hooting Yard updates\u20142.084 to date\u2014\
    being automatically generated every time I update the blog.\nThat said, after\
    \ blowing my raspberry of contempt at Ian Katz it occurred to me that it would\
    \ be a splendid idea if someone tweeted that particular postage at him. I would\
    \ do so myself if I knew how. But in investigating the matter, and thus\u2014\
    for once\u2014going to my Twitter page, I discovered, lawks amercy!, that various\
    \ people who have been \u201Cfollowing\u201D me have sent me messages, asked me\
    \ questions, or generally attempted to engage in conversation. All of these have\
    \ of course been ignored because I have never seen them.\nI do not wish these\
    \ clearly very perspicacious folk to think ill of me for not responding to them.\
    \ So, my apologies, but in future I would recommend adding comments here on the\
    \ blog to those of you who wish to communicate. I am not sure I can face the Twitter\
    \ experience on a regular basis."
