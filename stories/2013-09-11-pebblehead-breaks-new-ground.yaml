  text: 'The latest issue of the weekly magazine Doings Of Pebblehead--The Weekly
    Magazine Devoted To The Doings Of The Paperback Potboilerist Pebblehead contains
    a fascinating interview with the paperback potboilerist Pebblehead. In it, he
    announces a brand new work in progress, which he is currently bashing out on his
    typewriter in his so-called chalet o'' prose, pipe clenched between his jaws.

    "As you know," he says, "I have written a tremendous number of police procedurals,
    many of them featuring maverick detective Detective Captain Cargpan. The other
    day, I was about to embark on another one when the thought occurred to me that
    perhaps it was time I wrote a different type of procedural. After all, why should
    the police be the only public servants whose procedures are examined in forensic
    and, let us not forget, thrilling detail by fiction writers? God knows how many
    paperbacks and television shows have been devoted to following police procedures.
    Well, I decided to break with convention and write a paperback potboiling blockbuster
    which, while decisively procedural, focusses on different procedures. As yet untitled,
    it will be a lollipop lady procedural, the first, I hope, of many."

    Outside of Britain and Australia, readers may not know what a lollipop lady is.
    Helpfully, then, the editors of Doings Of Pebblehead--The Weekly Magazine Devoted
    To The Doings Of The Paperback Potboilerist Pebblehead provide a footnote explaining
    that a lollipop lady is a lady armed with a circular placard, resembling a gigantic
    lollipop, who strides into the road and causes traffic to halt so that gaggles
    of tinies on their way to their schools self esteem ''n'' diversity awareness
    hubs can cross the road without being squashed to death under the wheels of cars,
    vans, trucks, lorries, buses, coaches, and huge sinister smoke-belching tankers
    such as the one featured in Steven Spielberg''s second film, Duel (1971), starring
    Dennis Weaver.

    The magazine also includes a picture of a lollipop lady, similar to the one below,
    so the more dimwitted among the readers can grasp what Pebblehead is talking about.

    "It seems to me," continues Pebblehead in this fascinating interview, "That there
    is a great deal of thrilling fictional potential in a lollipop lady procedural
    following the procedures of a lollipop lady. She is a lone figure, striding out
    into the menace of the open road, into the path of cars, vans, trucks, lorries,
    buses, coaches, and huge sinister smoke-belching tankers such as the one featured
    in Steven Spielberg''s second film, Duel (1971), starring Dennis Weaver, and causing
    them to put on their brakes and slow to a halt through the sheer force of her
    personality, not forgetting her circular placard resembling a giant lollipop,
    so that tinies, who without her would almost certainly be squashed to death under
    the wheels of the speeding cars, vans, trucks, lorries, buses, coaches, and huge
    sinister smoke-belching tankers such as the one featured in Steven Spielberg''s
    second film, Duel (1971), starring Dennis Weaver, can safely reach their schools
    self esteem ''n'' diversity awareness hubs. At the moment I am tussling with the
    name to give my heroine. I think I might call her Mrs Cargpan. Then readers will
    have the added frisson of wondering if she is the wife of the hero of many of
    my police procedurals, maverick detective Detective Captain Cargpan."

    So saying, the indefatigable paperback potboilerist clenched his pipe between
    his jaws and dismissed the callow cub reporter from Doings Of Pebblehead--The
    Weekly Magazine Devoted To The Doings Of The Paperback Potboilerist Pebblehead
    with a lordly wave of his surprisingly dainty hand.'
