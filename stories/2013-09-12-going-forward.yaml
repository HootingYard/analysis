  text: 'As far as I am aware, we have not yet mastered the art of travelling backwards
    in time. That being so, why is it that no politician, of whatever stripe, can
    open their mouth without uttering the redundant phrase "going forward", often
    repeatedly? Listen to any current affairs programme for a few minutes and you
    will hear it.

    The only solution is for the whole sorry lot of them to have some kind of contraption
    fitted to their heads which delivers a high-voltage electro-convulsive shock each
    and every time they use the phrase. Perhaps--in the future--this will happen.
    ("In the future" is an archaic term. It used to be what people said where they
    now say "going forward".)'
