  text: "As far as I am aware, we have not yet mastered the art of travelling backwards\
    \ in time. That being so, why is it that no politician, of whatever stripe, can\
    \ open their mouth without uttering the redundant phrase \u201Cgoing forward\u201D\
    , often repeatedly? Listen to any current affairs programme for a few minutes\
    \ and you will hear it.\nThe only solution is for the whole sorry lot of them\
    \ to have some kind of contraption fitted to their heads which delivers a high-voltage\
    \ electro-convulsive shock each and every time they use the phrase. Perhaps\u2014\
    in the future\u2014this will happen. (\u201CIn the future\u201D is an archaic\
    \ term. It used to be what people said where they now say \u201Cgoing forward\u201D\
