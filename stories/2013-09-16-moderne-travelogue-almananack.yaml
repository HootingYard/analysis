  text: 'I was overcome with a sudden panic; to have come so far only to have to turn
    around and go back, unable to keep up with the local dialect, a distinct and lilting
    mixture of my own native tongue and a leprechaun''s mystical chatter.

    Thus my nephew Vinnie Byrne, a native of Pining And Pothorst Land, currently making
    a grand tour of Old Europe. Wisely, he has decided to write a blog about his travels,
    and very good it is too. I urge you lot to go and read it.'
