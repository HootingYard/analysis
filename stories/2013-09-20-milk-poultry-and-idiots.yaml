    In this week''s Dabbler there is a third set of Brief Lives (or Brief, Brief Lives),
    involving, inter alia, milk, poultry, and idiots.

    In connection with which, Mr Key is about to embark upon a thrilling project which
    will have the unfortunate effect of becalming Hooting Yard for some while. I will
    still of course be pouring out sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose, but for
    a few months there may be fewer postages here than is usual. So if two or three
    days go by without word, do not fret and imagine I have fallen down a mineshaft
    or met with some other calamity.

    News of Project Thrilling will be announced in due time.'
