  text: "Pebblehead's Book Of British Pebbles is something of a departure for the\
    \ bestselling paperback potboilerist. Best known for his fat airport-bookstall\
    \ blockbusters with one-word titles ending in an exclamation mark, his latest\
    \ tome is a picture book featuring hundreds of snaps of pebbles accompanied by\
    \ sprightly and vivid explanatory texts.\n\u201CFor many years I have been collecting\
    \ pebbles,\u201D said Pebblehead, sheltering from the rain under an umbrella outside\
    \ a sordid backstreet bordello where he was buttonholed by an eager young cub\
    \ reporter from a regional newspaper, \u201CAnd it occurred to me to exploit my\
    \ success as a writer of potboilers to bring the joy of pebbles to a wider audience.\
    \ Pebbles are too often ignored and neglected in this day and age. I want people\
    \ to notice them, admire them, pick them up and plop them in their pockets and\
    \ take them home, then place them on their mantelpiece or windowsill and give\
    \ them a good polish with a rag and a spraycan of Mr Brightly Dazzling propietary\
    \ pebble polish from time to time. They are also very useful for chucking at swans\
    \ if you have a fit of pique when taking a turn around your local duckpond.\u201D\
    \nAnd with that, the indefatigable paperbackist clamped his pipe tighter between\
    \ his jaws and flounced off in the rain towards some fresh hell."
