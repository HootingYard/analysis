  text: 'Pebblehead''s Book Of British Pebbles is something of a departure for the
    bestselling paperback potboilerist. Best known for his fat airport-bookstall blockbusters
    with one-word titles ending in an exclamation mark, his latest tome is a picture
    book featuring hundreds of snaps of pebbles accompanied by sprightly and vivid
    explanatory texts.

    "For many years I have been collecting pebbles," said Pebblehead, sheltering from
    the rain under an umbrella outside a sordid backstreet bordello where he was buttonholed
    by an eager young cub reporter from a regional newspaper, "And it occurred to
    me to exploit my success as a writer of potboilers to bring the joy of pebbles
    to a wider audience. Pebbles are too often ignored and neglected in this day and
    age. I want people to notice them, admire them, pick them up and plop them in
    their pockets and take them home, then place them on their mantelpiece or windowsill
    and give them a good polish with a rag and a spraycan of Mr Brightly Dazzling
    propietary pebble polish from time to time. They are also very useful for chucking
    at swans if you have a fit of pique when taking a turn around your local duckpond."

    And with that, the indefatigable paperbackist clamped his pipe tighter between
    his jaws and flounced off in the rain towards some fresh hell.'
