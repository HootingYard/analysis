  text: "Weeks after posting a link to my first set of Brief Lives over at The Dabbler,\
    \ a comment arrives. Rahul tells us that he (she?) is \u201Cusing one of the best\
    \ refrigerators in India\u201D. Apparently it is fitted with the \u201Clatest\
    \ sensation technology\u201D. It is not clear if this is related to L'Oreal's\
    \ light-reflecting booster technology, but I am sure it must be so.\nThe refrigerator\
    \ alluded to in my postage was the one in Michael Tippett's kitchen which he called\
    \ \u201CBernard Levin\u201D. I cannot help wondering if that model, too, had the\
    \ most up to date sensation technology of its era. Again, I would like to think\
    \ that was the case.\nI do not know what Tippett's fellow composer Peter Maxwell\
    \ Davies calls his refrigerator, but no doubt it, too, is a state of the art model,\
    \ crammed with electrocuted swans."
