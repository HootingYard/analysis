  text: 'Once upon a time there was a clucking thing. It was made of wire and wax
    and string and it made a clucking noise when you pressed a knob. The knob was
    located on what might have been its head. I say "might have been" because the
    thing didn''t really have a head, not a proper head, like my head or your head.
    It was a sort of boxy shape, this thing. The knob was set over to one side on
    the very upper part of it, which tapered slightly. That is why I said "head",
    because the knob was on the upper part, to give you some idea. Were the knob set
    lower, as low as could be, I could have said it was located on the thing''s foot,
    even though it did not have a foot, or feet, not as such.

    It was not a mobile thing. If you wanted to move it, you had to pick it up and
    put it where you wanted it to be and it would stay there until you picked it up
    again and moved it somewhere else. It did not make a clucking sound unless you
    pressed the knob.

    It was yellow.

    It was yellow except for the knob, which was red, or perhaps orange. Also, its
    underside was beige. But its underside was almost always resting on the floor,
    and so was not visible. If you picked it up and rested it on its side, or--in
    a moment of hysteria--upside down, it did not cluck when you pressed the knob,
    no matter how hard and insistently and repeatedly you pressed the knob. It had
    to be placed upright, with the beige part on the floor.

    It was roughly the same size as a big duck.

    If you placed a microphone next to it, to amplify the clucking sound when you
    pressed the knob, the proximity of the microphone created some sort of feedback.
    Then the thing howled, a terrifying ear-splitting howl, whether or not you were
    pressing the knob. It would continue howling until you moved the microphone somewhere
    else, further away, preferably into a different room, or even into a different
    building. After howling, the thing would take some time to settle itself before
    pressing its knob would make it cluck. Immediately after howling, when you pressed
    the knob the thing would wheeze. You would probably have to wait about five minutes
    before it would cluck again properly,

    The thing did not do anything else except cluck, howl, or wheeze. It fulfilled
    no higher purpose. Unless you were particularly fond of boxy yellow immobile things,
    it did not really prettify a room, like a vase of brilliant flowers, or a framed
    picture of a parson skating on a frozen pond.

    It was not the only thing of its kind in the world. At the last count there were
    something like twenty million of them. Most of them, the things that cluck when
    you press the knob, were buried in landfill sites. Human ingenuity can be immensely
    befuddling.'
