  text: 'Here is another potsage [sic] exhumed from the archive. It is from July 2005
    and marks the very first appearance on these pages of fictional athlete Bobnit
    Tivol who, I am somewhat alarmed to note, I claimed was my father. What this might
    mean is for a quack brain doctor to unravel.

    When I turn my mind to the great sprint champions of the past, I often think of
    Bobnit Tivol. He came from the Tyrol, and he was such a fast runner that it was
    said he could outrun an express train, which was a strange thing to say, for at
    that time there were no trains, express or otherwise, in the Tyrol. But of course
    Bobnit Tivol was famous throughout the world, and he often raced in foreign countries,
    so it is conceivable that he was tempted on one of his travels to compete against
    a railway train. His trainer was cranky old Halob, who himself had been a very
    great sprinter. Making his champion run in front of, rather than alongside, a
    speeding train is exactly the kind of technique Halob would have used. Once, it
    is said, he made Bobnit Tivol run an uphill double marathon wearing an iron vest,
    twice in one day.

    One has only to consider the records broken by Bobnit Tivol to recognise him for
    the superb sprinter he was. Leafing through old athletics almanacks, his name
    appears again and again and again, invariably in capital letters, annotated by
    one, two, or even three stars, at the top of every list. They say he had to rent
    a warehouse to store all his cups and shields and trophies. To think that he had
    won all the major Tyrolean sprinting events before he was twenty years old is
    to gasp in wonder.

    Could he have succeeded without old Halob? They made a striking pair, the whippet-like
    runner with his mop of golden hair and the wheezing, elderly man, who smoked four
    packets of Black Ague rolling tobacco every day, dressed always in his Stalinist
    cardigan, a stopwatch in each pocket, leaning on a stick he claimed to have broken
    off the Tree of Heaven.

    If I shut my eyes I see them still, my father and his mentor, Bobnit Tivol and
    old Halob, heroic figures from a past I have had to invent anew, for none of it
    is true.'
