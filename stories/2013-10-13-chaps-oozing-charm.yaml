  text: "Further archival witterings, again from long ago in 2004. This was said to\
    \ come from a collection called The Vitamin B Pirate Gang & Other Maritime Doggerel\
    \ by Gervase Beerpint, presumably some relation to your favourite poet and mine,\
    \ Dennis Beerpint.\nChaps oozing charm wedged in a chest.\n  There's no knowing\
    \ who'll come out best.\n  One is called Billy, head made of cork,\n  Shoulders\
    \ cast iron, arms and legs chalk.\n  Mythology enwraps him like a shroud.\n  His\
    \ voice is grating and horribly loud.\n  And then there is Cedric, aquatic, with\
    \ fins.\n  He likes to muck about with a box of pins.\n  He has no ears but his\
    \ feet are huge.\n  His entire head is covered in rouge.\n  Hummingbirds pain\
    \ him, as do owls.\n  He's always had trouble pronouncing vowels.\n  The third\
    \ of our trio is Swivel-Eyed Dan.\n  His head is the shape of a frying pan.\n\
    \  He once went south, looking for bees,\n  But all his dreams blew away on a\
    \ breeze.\n  You have to give credit where it's due -\n  But not to Dan when he's\
    \ dribbling goo.\n  Three of them, then, wedged in a chest,\n  Each one wearing\
    \ a red satin vest,\n  Oozing insouciance, polish, and charm.\n  Let us hope they\
    \ come to no harm.\n  But the chest has been stowed in the hold of a ship\n  Whose\
    \ captain is moody and curls his lip.\n  As they sail out from port, the captain\
    \ growls:\n  \"Damn the beakers! Damm the owls!\n  Damn the crackers! Damn the\
    \ flaps!\n  Damn the chest of charming chaps!\"\n  Two hours later, the ship just\
    \ sank,\n  And all that remained was a single plank.\n  It floated for weeks and\
    \ was then washed ashore.\n  I found it on the beach and used it for a door.\n\
    \  So when you come to my stinking hut,\n  Bringing some food for my stinking\
    \ mutt,\n  Go careful by the door and remember your prayers:\n  \"Get wedged in\
    \ a chest, he who dares\"."
