  text: 'I noted the other day that potsages [sic] would be sparse for a while, but
    I do not want you lot to think I am staring vacantly out of the window with nothing
    going on in my noggin. If anything, the Key Cranium--soon to be declared a national
    monument, or possibly even an international monument--is fizzing and bubbling
    like unto a potion in a test tube on a bench in a laboratory wherein Dr Fang and
    his grotesque assistant Mungo do whatever it is they do in old crackly black and
    white films.

    So there is much tippy-tapping taking place at Haemoglobin Towers, but none of
    it is being posted here, or indeed anywhere. The reason for this is that I have
    somehow found myself having hit upon a scheme deemed to be "commercially viable",
    and I am preparing a book to be brought mewling into the light by a reputable
    publisher next year. For that reason, too, there will not be a Hooting Yard paperback
    from Lulu this year, although there will be something for you to get your grubby
    mitts on in time for Christmas--more news of that soon.'
