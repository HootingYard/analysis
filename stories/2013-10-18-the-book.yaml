  text: "So \u2026 this book I am working on, due out next year. It will be a whole\
    \ volume of Brief Lives, as posted recently in The Dabbler. As I explained there,\
    \ the entries are not really \u201Clives\u201D, in the sense of potted biographies,\
    \ but a single snippet about each subject, which could be an amusing or bemusing\
    \ fact, an anecdote, a quotation by or about the person, or in some cases simply\
    \ the preposterously lengthy title of a book they have written, as in this case:\n\
    Mowbray, Jay Henry (American writer, 20th century). Mowbray was the author of\
    \ the 1912 book Sinking Of The \u201CTitanic\u201D, Most Appalling Ocean Horror\
    \ With Graphic Descriptions Of Hundreds Swept To Eternity Beneath The Waves; Panic\
    \ Stricken Multitude Facing Sure Death, And Thrilling Stories Of This Most Overwhelming\
    \ Catastrophe To Which Is Added Vivid Accounts Of Heart-Rending Scenes, When Hundreds\
    \ Were Doomed To Watery Graves, Compiled From Soul Stirring Stories Told By Eye\
    \ Witnesses Of This Terrible Horror Of The Briny Deep.\nMuch of the material I\
    \ have gathered thus far (including Mowbray) lies buried deep within the Hooting\
    \ Yard archives, but of course my research is taking me further afield, to dusty\
    \ tomes on library shelves. And you lot can be of assistance, by bringing to my\
    \ attention bits and bobs of information that deserve a place in the book.\nThe\
    \ criteria for entries are that they are\_: amusing or bemusing (or both) ; true,\
    \ or at least attested as true by a reliable source ; not widely known (though\
    \ I realise that is a subjective judgement) ; and, oh, there was a fourth, but\
    \ I cannot recall what it was.\nI know all of you will be panting with eagerness\
    \ to assist Mr Key in his endeavours, and all assistants will be thanked by name\
    \ in the book. Please send your suggestions to hooting [dot] yard [at] gmail [dot]\
    \ com. As this will be a scholarly work of reference, please give details of your\
    \ sources.\nMeanwhile, here, for your amusement, is another brief life lugged\
    \ out of the archives:\nNaz\xE1rio de Lima, Ronaldo Lu\xEDs (Brazilian footballer,\
    \ b. 1976). During a football match in 2009, referring to a footballer named Rolando,\
    \ a television commentator wondered \u201Chow long is it since Ronaldo was marked\
    \ by an anagram of himself?\u201D"
