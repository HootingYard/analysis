  text: 'So ... this book I am working on, due out next year. It will be a whole volume
    of Brief Lives, as posted recently in The Dabbler. As I explained there, the entries
    are not really "lives", in the sense of potted biographies, but a single snippet
    about each subject, which could be an amusing or bemusing fact, an anecdote, a
    quotation by or about the person, or in some cases simply the preposterously lengthy
    title of a book they have written, as in this case:

    Mowbray, Jay Henry (American writer, 20th century). Mowbray was the author of
    the 1912 book Sinking Of The "Titanic", Most Appalling Ocean Horror With Graphic
    Descriptions Of Hundreds Swept To Eternity Beneath The Waves; Panic Stricken Multitude
    Facing Sure Death, And Thrilling Stories Of This Most Overwhelming Catastrophe
    To Which Is Added Vivid Accounts Of Heart-Rending Scenes, When Hundreds Were Doomed
    To Watery Graves, Compiled From Soul Stirring Stories Told By Eye Witnesses Of
    This Terrible Horror Of The Briny Deep.

    Much of the material I have gathered thus far (including Mowbray) lies buried
    deep within the Hooting Yard archives, but of course my research is taking me
    further afield, to dusty tomes on library shelves. And you lot can be of assistance,
    by bringing to my attention bits and bobs of information that deserve a place
    in the book.

    The criteria for entries are that they are : amusing or bemusing (or both) ; true,
    or at least attested as true by a reliable source ; not widely known (though I
    realise that is a subjective judgement) ; and, oh, there was a fourth, but I cannot
    recall what it was.

    I know all of you will be panting with eagerness to assist Mr Key in his endeavours,
    and all assistants will be thanked by name in the book. Please send your suggestions
    to hooting [dot] yard [at] gmail [dot] com. As this will be a scholarly work of
    reference, please give details of your sources.

    Meanwhile, here, for your amusement, is another brief life lugged out of the archives:

    Nazario de Lima, Ronaldo Luis (Brazilian footballer, b. 1976). During a football
    match in 2009, referring to a footballer named Rolando, a television commentator
    wondered "how long is it since Ronaldo was marked by an anagram of himself?"'
