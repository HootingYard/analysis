  text: 'So witless are the worlds of television and pop music that when, from time
    to time, a figure emerges in their midst who is capable of stringing a few coherent
    sentences together, they are held up as intellectual titans of our age. One thinks
    of Stephen Fry, regularly--if inexplicably--acclaimed as the possessor of the
    largest and most pulsating brain on this or any other planet. It is a case of
    Triton among the minnows, the majority of television persons being so vacuous
    and stupid that someone like Fry can dazzle simply by using words of three or
    more syllables.

    The delusion is even more pronounced in pop music, and nowhere more preposterously
    than in the adulation of the lead singer of The Smiths, a band that split up a
    quarter of a century ago. His autobiography has now been published as a Penguin
    Classic. Reread and digest that sentence, please, for it tells us much about the
    pitiable state of our culture, if indeed we could still be said to have one.

    What we have here is a combination of overweening vanity (on the part of the pop
    singer) and the sacrifice of any literary credibility to hard-headed marketing
    (on the part of the publisher). It would be bad enough had Penguin issued it as
    a Modern Classic, the usual imprint for suitably recognised works written after
    1918. But no, this solipsistic screed is deemed worthy for inclusion in what the
    Penguin website still maintains is an imprint devoted to "the best literature
    of several thousand years and countless cultures".

    When the pop singer said "I''d like my book to be published as a Penguin Classic",
    the correct response would have been "You are ridiculous. Go away."

    My thoughts are with E. V. Rieu, a proper scholar, the original editor of the
    Penguin Classics list, who died in 1972. The poor man will be turning in his grave.'
