  text: "\nOver at The Dabbler, my cupboard contains a selection of newspaper headlines\
    \ which appeared in The Times in 1789 and 1790. Was it really true that the Irish\
    \ were not refined enough for opera? Did the paper have a regular \u201CElopements\u201D\
    \ column? Is it seemly for a clergyman to eat filberts while conducting a burial\
    \ service? You will not get answers to these important questions, but they are\
    \ well worth thinking about, are they not?"
