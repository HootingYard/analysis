    Over at The Dabbler, my cupboard contains a selection of newspaper headlines which
    appeared in The Times in 1789 and 1790. Was it really true that the Irish were
    not refined enough for opera? Did the paper have a regular "Elopements" column?
    Is it seemly for a clergyman to eat filberts while conducting a burial service?
    You will not get answers to these important questions, but they are well worth
    thinking about, are they not?'
