  text: "It is a rule of thumb that in any egg-based pudding discussion, at some point\
    \ the phrase \u201Cover-egging the pudding\u201D will be deployed, whether or\
    \ not it is pertinent.\nIt is entirely conceivable that you have absolutely no\
    \ idea what I am talking about, so to clarify matters for the dull-witted I shall\
    \ give an example of a snatch of dialogue from a fairly routine egg-based pudding\
    \ discussion. This is not something I have made up, woven out of whole cloth from\
    \ the fuming phantasms of my inner head, but a genuine extract from an egg-based\
    \ pudding discussion I tape-recorded especially that I might transcribe it for\
    \ an eventuality such as the present one. I hope all this is crystal clear.\n\
    Snippy \u2013 I must say for as long as I can remember I have been fond of egg-based\
    \ puddings.\nCleothgard\u2014Some might say \u201Coverfond\u201D, ha ha ha.\n\
    Snippy\u2014No, I don't think I could be accused of being overfond of egg-based\
    \ puddings. It is not as if I am forever guzzling them. Perhaps once or twice\
    \ a month I might treat myself to an egg-based pudding, which seems a reasonably\
    \ moderate rate to me.\nCleothgard\u2014Now you are adopting a very defensive\
    \ posture.\nSnippy\u2014I am not. I am merely saying that by calling me overfond\
    \ of egg-based puddings you were, let us say, ha ha, over-egging the pudding yourself.\n\
    That should make clear to you the point I was making, which\u2014to repeat\u2014\
    is that the phrase \u201Cover-egging the pudding\u201D will make an appearance,\
    \ usually fairly early on, in any egg-based pudding discussion. I hasten to add\
    \ that the extract from the conversation between Snippy and Cleothgard is absolutely\
    \ genuine, a transcription of a tape-recorded egg-based pudding discussion held\
    \ at the edge of a field, next to a filbert-hedge, on a somewhat damp Thursday\
    \ afternoon in the latter years of the last century. The exchange was recorded\
    \ on a cassette tape and that cassette tape has been kept, securely, in the locked\
    \ drawer of a desk, the desk being in the private cabin of a trusted sea-captain,\
    \ trusted by me, at any rate. This sea-captain is captain of a ship which has\
    \ been roving the high seas almost continuously since the cassette tape was entrusted\
    \ to the captain and he locked it in the drawer of the desk in his private cabin.\
    \ Interestingly, the captain's name is Captain Pudding and his head resembles\
    \ an egg.\nIf you have been affected by this discussion of over-egging the pudding,\
    \ please call our helpline."
