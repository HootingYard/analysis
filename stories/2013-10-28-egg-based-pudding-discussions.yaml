  text: 'It is a rule of thumb that in any egg-based pudding discussion, at some point
    the phrase "over-egging the pudding" will be deployed, whether or not it is pertinent.

    It is entirely conceivable that you have absolutely no idea what I am talking
    about, so to clarify matters for the dull-witted I shall give an example of a
    snatch of dialogue from a fairly routine egg-based pudding discussion. This is
    not something I have made up, woven out of whole cloth from the fuming phantasms
    of my inner head, but a genuine extract from an egg-based pudding discussion I
    tape-recorded especially that I might transcribe it for an eventuality such as
    the present one. I hope all this is crystal clear.

    Snippy - I must say for as long as I can remember I have been fond of egg-based
    puddings.

    Cleothgard--Some might say "overfond", ha ha ha.

    Snippy--No, I don''t think I could be accused of being overfond of egg-based puddings.
    It is not as if I am forever guzzling them. Perhaps once or twice a month I might
    treat myself to an egg-based pudding, which seems a reasonably moderate rate to
    me.

    Cleothgard--Now you are adopting a very defensive posture.

    Snippy--I am not. I am merely saying that by calling me overfond of egg-based
    puddings you were, let us say, ha ha, over-egging the pudding yourself.

    That should make clear to you the point I was making, which--to repeat--is that
    the phrase "over-egging the pudding" will make an appearance, usually fairly early
    on, in any egg-based pudding discussion. I hasten to add that the extract from
    the conversation between Snippy and Cleothgard is absolutely genuine, a transcription
    of a tape-recorded egg-based pudding discussion held at the edge of a field, next
    to a filbert-hedge, on a somewhat damp Thursday afternoon in the latter years
    of the last century. The exchange was recorded on a cassette tape and that cassette
    tape has been kept, securely, in the locked drawer of a desk, the desk being in
    the private cabin of a trusted sea-captain, trusted by me, at any rate. This sea-captain
    is captain of a ship which has been roving the high seas almost continuously since
    the cassette tape was entrusted to the captain and he locked it in the drawer
    of the desk in his private cabin. Interestingly, the captain''s name is Captain
    Pudding and his head resembles an egg.
