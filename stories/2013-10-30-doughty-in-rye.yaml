  text: "Over at the indispensable Nigeness, Nige occasionally writes a postage about\
    \ a fortuitous find in a secondhand bookshop. I thought I would follow his example,\
    \ for yesterday I was in Rye, and in a tiny bookshop called the Tiny Bookshop\
    \ I was happy to come upon a 1956 Penguin copy of Passages From Arabia Deserta\
    \ by Charles Montagu Doughty, for a mere three pounds.\n\nThis is an abridged\
    \ version of Doughty's best-known work, Travels In Arabia Deserta, which was extolled\
    \ by The Observer thus: \u201CCharles Montagu Doughty was one of the great men\
    \ of our day, the author of a unique prose masterpiece. For many readers it is\
    \ a book so majestic, so vital, of such incomparable beauty of thought, of observation,\
    \ and of diction as to occupy a place apart among their most cherished literary\
    \ possessions\u201D.\nI have written about Doughty before, with particular reference\
    \ to his strangely hypnotic prose. Never having had the courage to tackle the\
    \ Travels in their vast entirety, I shall look forward to reading this abridgement\u2014\
    still over 300 pages."
