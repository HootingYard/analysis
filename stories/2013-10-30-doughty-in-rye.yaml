  text: 'Over at the indispensable Nigeness, Nige occasionally writes a postage about
    a fortuitous find in a secondhand bookshop. I thought I would follow his example,
    for yesterday I was in Rye, and in a tiny bookshop called the Tiny Bookshop I
    was happy to come upon a 1956 Penguin copy of Passages From Arabia Deserta by
    Charles Montagu Doughty, for a mere three pounds.


    This is an abridged version of Doughty''s best-known work, Travels In Arabia Deserta,
    which was extolled by The Observer thus: "Charles Montagu Doughty was one of the
    great men of our day, the author of a unique prose masterpiece. For many readers
    it is a book so majestic, so vital, of such incomparable beauty of thought, of
    observation, and of diction as to occupy a place apart among their most cherished
    literary possessions".

    I have written about Doughty before, with particular reference to his strangely
    hypnotic prose. Never having had the courage to tackle the Travels in their vast
    entirety, I shall look forward to reading this abridgement--still over 300 pages.'
