  text: "The following is a comparative estimate of the dimensions of the Head of\
    \ the inhabitants in several counties of England.\nThe male Head in England, at\
    \ maturity, averages from 6 and a half to 7 and five-eighths inches in diameter;\
    \ the medium and most general size being 7 inches. The female head is smaller,\
    \ varying from 6 and three-eighths to 7 or 7 and a half inches, the medium male\
    \ size. Fixing the medium of the English head at 7 inches, there can be no difficulty\
    \ in distinguishing the portions of society above from those below that measurement.\n\
    London \u2013 The majority of the higher classes are above the medium, while among\
    \ the lower it is very rare to find a large head.\nSpitalfields Weavers have extremely\
    \ small heads, 6 and a half, 6 and five-eighths, 6 and three-quarter inches being\
    \ the prevailing admeasurements.\nCoventry\u2014Almost exclusively peopled by\
    \ weavers; the same facts are peculiarly observed.\nHertfordshire, Essex, Suffolk,\
    \ and Norfolk contain a larger proportion of small heads than any part of the\
    \ empire; Essex and Hertfordshire particularly. 7 inches in diameter is here,\
    \ as in Spitalfields and Coventry, quite unusual. 6 and five-eighths or 6 and\
    \ a half are more general; and 6 and three-eighths, the usual size for a boy of\
    \ six years of age, is frequently to be met with here in the full maturity of\
    \ manhood.\nKent, Surrey, and Sussex\u2014An increase of size of the usual average\
    \ is observed; and the inland counties, in general, are nearly upon the same scale.\n\
    Devonshire and Cornwall \u2013 The heads of full sizes.\nHerefordshire\u2014Superior\
    \ to the London average.\nLancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland, and Northumberland\
    \ have more large heads, in proportion, than any part of the country.\nScotland\u2014\
    The full-sized head is known to be possessed by the inhabitants; their measurement\
    \ ranging between 7 and three-quarters and 7 and seven-eighths even to 8 inches.\
    \ This extreme size, however, is rare.\nJohn Timbs, Things Not Generally Known\
    \ (1860)"
