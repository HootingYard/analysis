  text: 'The following is a comparative estimate of the dimensions of the Head of
    the inhabitants in several counties of England.

    The male Head in England, at maturity, averages from 6 and a half to 7 and five-eighths
    inches in diameter; the medium and most general size being 7 inches. The female
    head is smaller, varying from 6 and three-eighths to 7 or 7 and a half inches,
    the medium male size. Fixing the medium of the English head at 7 inches, there
    can be no difficulty in distinguishing the portions of society above from those
    below that measurement.

    London - The majority of the higher classes are above the medium, while among
    the lower it is very rare to find a large head.

    Spitalfields Weavers have extremely small heads, 6 and a half, 6 and five-eighths,
    6 and three-quarter inches being the prevailing admeasurements.

    Coventry--Almost exclusively peopled by weavers; the same facts are peculiarly
    observed.

    Hertfordshire, Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk contain a larger proportion of small
    heads than any part of the empire; Essex and Hertfordshire particularly. 7 inches
    in diameter is here, as in Spitalfields and Coventry, quite unusual. 6 and five-eighths
    or 6 and a half are more general; and 6 and three-eighths, the usual size for
    a boy of six years of age, is frequently to be met with here in the full maturity
    of manhood.

    Kent, Surrey, and Sussex--An increase of size of the usual average is observed;
    and the inland counties, in general, are nearly upon the same scale.

    Devonshire and Cornwall - The heads of full sizes.

    Herefordshire--Superior to the London average.

    Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cumberland, and Northumberland have more large heads, in
    proportion, than any part of the country.

    Scotland--The full-sized head is known to be possessed by the inhabitants; their
    measurement ranging between 7 and three-quarters and 7 and seven-eighths even
    to 8 inches. This extreme size, however, is rare.
