  text: "'Twas brillig, and I babbled guff\n  Until my listeners cried \"Enough!\"\
    \n  And stopped my gob with a plug of dough\n  And then it was that I knew woe.\n\
    A woe such as I'd never known\n  Not e'en when I was skin and bone\n  In starveling\
    \ days of pimply youth\n  Before I grew so fat forsooth\nFat and loud and babbling\
    \ guff\n  All roister doister swagger and puff\n  Puffed up like one of those\
    \ eerie toads\n  That leap at you from beside the roads\nWell, at least, they\
    \ leap at moi\n  I wrote of them in my memoir\n  The text of which is what I brayed\n\
    \  Hoping to make my listeners afraid\nInstead they plugged my gob with dough\n\
    \  And brought me down so very low\n  That now my life is full of woe\n  And it\
    \ is time for me to go\nGo where? To the seaside I suppose\n  To my seaside chalet\
    \ o' prose\n  To thump my typewriter's leaden keys\n  And write of hornets, wasps,\
    \ and bees"
