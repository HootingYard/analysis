  text: 'In the reign of William III, there resided at Ipswich a family which, from
    the number of peculiarities belonging to it, was distinguished by the name of
    ''the Odd Family''. Every event remarkably good or bad happened to this family
    on an odd day of the month, and every member had something odd in his or her person,
    manner, or behaviour. The very letters in their Christian names always happened
    to be an odd number; the husband''s name was Peter, and the wife''s name Raboh:
    they had seven children, all boys, viz, Solomon, Roger, James, Matthew, Jonas,
    David, and Ezekiel. The husband had but one leg, his wife but one arm. Solomon
    was born blind of one eye, and Roger lost his sight by accident. James had his
    left ear bit off by a boy in a quarrel, and Matthew was born with only three fingers
    on his right hand. Jonas had a stump foot and David was hump-backed. All these,
    except the latter, were remarkably short, while Ezekiel was six foot one inch
    high at the age of nineteen The stump-footed Jonas and the hump-backed David got
    wives of fortune, but no girls in the borough would listen to the addresses of
    their brothers. The husband''s hair was as black as jet, and the wife''s remarkably
    white; yet every one of the children''s hair was red. The husband was killed by
    accidentally falling into a deep pit in the year 1701; and his wife, refusing
    all kinds of sustenance, died five days after him, and they were buried in one
    grave. In 1703, Ezekiel enlisted as a grenadier; and although he was afterwards
    wounded in twenty-three places, he recovered. Roger, James, Matthew, Jonas, and
    David, it appears by the church registers, died in different places and were buried
    on the same day, in 1713; and Solomon and Ezekiel were drowned together in crossing
    the Thames in the year 1723. Such a collection of odd circumstances never occurred
    before in one family.
