  text: 'Reviewing The Elements Of Eloquence by Mark Forsythe in The Spectator, Christopher
    Howse notes:

    The shiniest piece of information I picked up is that, in English, adjectives
    go in this order:

    Opinion--size--age--shape--colour--origin--material--purpose--noun. So you can
    have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But
    if you mess with that word order in the slightest you''ll sound like a maniac.

    This knowledge is implicitly mastered by all native speakers; to see it made explicit
    is an enjoyable revelation, like learning to carry a tray on the flat of your
    hand.'
