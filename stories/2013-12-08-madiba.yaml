    thought of him. Turns out he approved..

    Tom Holland reacts to the news. As does Rod Liddle:

    for Christ''s sake BBC, give it a bloody break for five minutes, will you? It''s
    as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial
    bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let''s re-run the entire
    history of South Africa. That''s better than watching the country we''re in being
    flattened by a storm.'
