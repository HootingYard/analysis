  text: "Gosh! On this day, ten long years ago, on Sunday 14 December 2003, the Hooting\
    \ Yard blog came mewling into the world! Strange to think, is it not?, there was\
    \ once a time that this website did not exist, to give pleasure to teeming millions\
    \ dozens.\nIn order to celebrate a decade of Hooting Yard, I think I will post\
    \ each day between now and Christmas an item from each calendar year. Not a \u201C\
    best of \u2026\u201D, nor even particularly my own favourites, but a fair jumble\
    \ of potsages [sic] designed to instruct, enlighten, and entertain.\nReaders may\
    \ wish to join in the celebrations by making a donation to ensure Hooting Yard\
    \ continues to flourish for the next ten glorious years.\nThis splendid quotation\
    \ first appeared on Friday 19 December 2003.\nIn my own case I have imputed my\
    \ early baldness to growth in intellectuality and spirituality induced by my fondness\
    \ for and devotion to books. Miss Susan, my sister, lays it to other causes, first\
    \ among which she declares to be my unnatural practice of reading in bed, and\
    \ the second my habit of eating welsh-rarebits late of nights. Over my bed I have\
    \ a gas-jet so properly shaded that the rays of light are concentrated and reflected\
    \ downward upon the volume which I am reading. Miss Susan insists that much of\
    \ this light and its attendant heat falls upon my head, compelling there a dryness\
    \ of the scalp whereby the follicles have been deprived of their natural nourishment\
    \ and have consequently died. She furthermore maintains that the welsh-rarebits\
    \ of which I partake invariably at the eleventh hour every night breed poisonous\
    \ vapors and subtle megrims within my stomach, which humors, rising by their natural\
    \ courses to my brain, do therein produce a fever that from within burneth up\
    \ the fluids necessary to a healthy condition of the capillary growth upon the\
    \ super-adjacent and exterior cranial integument.\nEugene Field, The Love Affairs\
    \ of a Bibliomaniac.\nEugene Field also wrote, among many other works, the children's\
    \ rhyme Wynken, Blynken & Nod. He had a childhood sweetheart with the marvellous\
    \ name Captivity Waite. I wonder if she was any relation to the splendid Asenath\
    \ Waite in H P Lovecraft's The Thing On The Doorstep? Glubb\u2026 glubb\u2026\
    \ glubb."
