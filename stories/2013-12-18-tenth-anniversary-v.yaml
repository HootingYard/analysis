  text: 'For day five of our tenth anniversary celebrations, here is a repost of an
    item that first appeared on 21 February 2007. You would do well to memorise it,
    and to chuck it into a lull during the conversation at one of those swish sophisticated
    cocktail parties you are forever going to (and I am not).


    I have been accused of relentlessly alluding to a single extract from the Journals
    of Gerard Manley Hopkins--the entry where he describes mesmerising a duck--so
    here is another, equally fascinating, quote:

    Tuncks is a good name. Gerard Manley Tuncks. Pook Tuncks.'
