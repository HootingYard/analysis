  text: "For day five of our tenth anniversary celebrations, here is a repost of an\
    \ item that first appeared on 21 February 2007. You would do well to memorise\
    \ it, and to chuck it into a lull during the conversation at one of those swish\
    \ sophisticated cocktail parties you are forever going to (and I am not).\n\n\
    I have been accused of relentlessly alluding to a single extract from the Journals\
    \ of Gerard Manley Hopkins\u2014the entry where he describes mesmerising a duck\u2014\
    so here is another, equally fascinating, quote:\nTuncks is a good name. Gerard\
    \ Manley Tuncks. Pook Tuncks."
