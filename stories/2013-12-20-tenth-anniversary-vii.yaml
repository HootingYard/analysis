  text: "Today's tenth anniversary piece is from Tuesday 24 March 2009, and is entitled\
    \ The Pavilion By The Shore.\nThere is a pavilion by the shore. I do not go there\
    \ any more. I used to visit every day on my clomping horse with its rattling dray,\
    \ and I'd hammer my fists upon the door of the pavilion set beside the shore,\
    \ but I do not go there any more. I cannot go there any more.\nI used to clomp\
    \ along the lane lined by beech and larch and plane, but something went wrong\
    \ in my brain and now I languish in the drain.\nI languish in a drainage ditch.\
    \ I'm smeared with grease and tar and pitch. I've lost the use of my lower limbs\
    \ and at the mercy of vermin's whims.\nAll sorts of vermin suck my blood as I\
    \ lie sprawling in the mud, and others gnaw my skin and bones while I groan my\
    \ dramatic groans.\nAbove me, a hot air balloon will be arriving very soon. I'll\
    \ be winched up by a length of rope, and washed with disinfectant soap.\nThe balloonist\
    \ will sing rousing hymns to cure my withered lower limbs, and we'll hover in\
    \ the boundless sky eating a snack of lemon meringue pie.\nThen I'll be dumped\
    \ back on the lane, a few tweaks putting right my brain, and then I shall return\
    \ once more to the bright pavilion by the shore.\nI'm sure there's something,\
    \ before I go, that you are very keen to know. The balloonist's name\u2014don't\
    \ be a clot! It was Tiny Enid, the heroic tot!"
