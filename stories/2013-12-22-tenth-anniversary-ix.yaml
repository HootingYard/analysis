  text: 'We do not always pay proper attention to the wider world here at Hooting
    Yard, but on 29 April 2011 we marked the occasion of the royal wedding with a
    piece about the regal woading. It is reposted here as part of our year-by-year
    tenth anniversary celebrations.

    By rights, several dimblebys should be on hand to guide you through the events
    of today''s regal woading, but they have been ripp''d untimely from their anchorage,
    so I am stepping into the breach. Let us be joyful.

    Before entering into the state of woaded bliss, the darlings are pulled by elegant
    horses in procession through the streets of the capital. These streets are lined
    by flag-waving peasants and other savages, watched over by coppers with clubs
    "on the ground", as they say, and, from high buildings, by snipers armed with
    high-velocity rifles and walkie-talkies. But the mood is rightly joyous. The peasants
    wave their flags and, as the carriages progress, the darlings, yet unwoaded, wave
    back, though flagless. The horses have been equipped with tackle that occludes
    their peripheral vision, to prevent them seeing anything that might make them
    panic and, in panic, go galloping pell mell, crushing peasants beneath their hooves.
    Were that to happen, to continue with the woading would be unseemly, and there
    must be not a smidgen of unseemliness on this day of all days. Hence the horses''
    blinkers-tackle.

    Within the huge ensteepled and consecrated edifice await the guests and the shamen.
    None has need of blinkers. The arch-shaman is a fellow with a ragged grey-white
    beard, as is considered proper for his office. He will perform the rite of regal
    woading when the darlings are ushered, separately, into the cavernous interior
    of the edifice. See, there, the trough of woad, and the siphon and funnel and
    besplattering implement which will be used to woad-besplatter the darlings at
    the most significant moment of the ceremony.

    But first there is much rigmarole, of a kind that cries out for interpretation-by-dimbleby.
    The arch-shaman, or one of his acolytes, will ascertain that the woading is pure,
    unalloyed and sullied not by any hint of bewolfenbuttlement. In a modern woading
    such as this, those watching electrical transmissions may be able to see each
    individual grey-white hair in the arch-shaman''s beard trembling faintly in the
    cool air. It is a sight to behold. The horses remain outwith the edifice, stamping
    their hooves, being fed from nosebags. The peasants and savages too, stay in their
    pens beside the streets, feeding from crisp-packets. The coppers and snipers stay
    alert.

    Inside there is solemn blathering and the woading itself, and the darlings buss
    their lips, and a great hosannah of voices is raised in song. Here even a dimbleby
    might pause, to let it sink in, sound and spectacle without comment. Then, blue
    with woad, the darlings emerge, upon the steps, to much cheering and clanging
    of bells, before climbing together into a carriage to be pulled by snack-refreshed
    horses for the return procession. Somewhere in the teeming masses, a "student"
    raises a placard of contempt. Before he can be clubbed by a copper or shot by
    a sniper, he is torn limb from limb by a gaggle of peasants, unnoticed by the
    larger throng. It is meet that it should be so.

    Across the land, jelly and ice cream are gobbled. Huzzah!'
