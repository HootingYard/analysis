  text: "Our year-by-year tenth anniversary celebration arrives at 2012. This, you\
    \ will recall, is the year Mr Key attempted to bash out a thousandish words every\
    \ day, and very nearly succeeded. Come mid-November, however, a spot of internationl\
    \ jet-setting threw a spanner in the works. Never mind. Many of the pieces from\
    \ the first half of the year were collected in the paperback Brute Beauty And\
    \ Valour And Act, Oh, Air, Pride, Plume, Here Buckle! If you are looking desperately\
    \ for a last-minute instantly downloadable Christmas gift, do bear in mind that\
    \ this splendid volume is now available as an ebook from the Amazon Kindle store.\
    \ Meanwhile, here is a piece from the second half of the year, On Snitby, from\
    \ Sunday 19 August 2012.\nSnitby blubbing on the causeway. A death in the family.\
    \ The priest is on his way, astride his elegant horse, along the clifftop path.\
    \ Candles lit in the cottage, and blood on the pillow. The dog is being sick in\
    \ the gutter. Snitby's dog, with its corkscrew tail like a pig's. Call My Bluff\
    \ on the wireless. Nobody wants to turn it off. Robert Robinson says: cagmag.\
    \ Nobody is listening. Birds are shrieking in the sky, an impossible blue, not\
    \ a hint of cloud. Snitby's tears extinguish his gasper. It is too wet to be relit\
    \ so he tosses it into the sea. A gull swoops to examine it. The sound of hooves,\
    \ but it is not the priest, not yet. It will not be the priest at all, today,\
    \ for the telegram was mistranscribed and he has set off in entirely the wrong\
    \ direction. He will arrive at Taddy at nightfall and have to be put up at an\
    \ inn. Here comes the crone with the winding sheet. She has a goitre and clogs.\
    \ The winding sheet is filthy. Snitby stares at the sea. The gull has flown away\
    \ into the far distance. It is now a speck. In the cottage, Robert Robinson says:\
    \ pannicles. There is nobody to hear him, for they have all come out to greet\
    \ the crone, to kick the dog, to rub its snout in its vomit. It whimpers and scampers\
    \ to the causeway. Snitby pats its head. A tiny white cloud appears in the sky.\
    \ A police car screeches to a halt outside the cottage. Snitby scarpers.\nSnitby\
    \ listening to Plastic Ono Band on his iPod.\nSnitby sobbing on the jetty. Undone\
    \ by art. A seaside exhibition of oils by Tarleton. Oil paintings of oily subjects,\
    \ rigs and slicks and sumps. A terrible beauty. His dog tied to a post outside\
    \ the galeria. Really an underused seaside civic hall. Snitby overcome with emotion.\
    \ Here in Taddy where the priest is still holed up in the inn, one or more limbs\
    \ paralysed. He fell from his elegant horse as it cantered to a halt. A hopeful\
    \ crone came clutching a winding sheet but he let out a groan and she was sent\
    \ away. Salt stains on the jetty. Salt in Snitby's tears. He holds his gasper\
    \ at arm's length. Sea sloshes against the wooden posts. Onions on Snitby's breath.\
    \ Tarleton dead these many years but still remembered and beloved in Taddy. He\
    \ was a local boy. Blond and breathless. One leg shorter than the other. Collector\
    \ of cakestands. Auctioned off. Snitby wanted one but had no cash to speak of.\
    \ In exile here now and for the future, where the police have no remit. Ancient\
    \ laws, woolly and medieval, like Snitby himself, after a fashion. In his attic\
    \ room, the priest's shutters are shut.\nSnitby reading Ruskin's numbered paragraphs\
    \ on his Kobo.\nSnitby bawling on the pier. The handcuffs chafe. The sergeant\
    \ has a florid face and a massive moustache. His socks are unwashed and give off\
    \ a whiff. Klaxons blaring. A pier ventriloquist stuffing his gob with steak and\
    \ kidney pie while his dummy prates. It is reciting a list of over six hundred\
    \ birds. Snitby's face in the sawdust. A couple of teeth loose. Police brutality,\
    \ but then the sergeant does not suffer fools gladly. Kicks Snitby as an afterthought.\
    \ Fills out a form with the stub of a pencil. Ten miles along the coast from Taddy,\
    \ twenty from the causeway. Geographical precision. Pins on a map. The priest\
    \ an invaluable source of intelligence. One arm now working perfectly, or as near\
    \ as dammit. Grace abounding. Gruel for his breakfast during Lent. Fish abounding\
    \ in this resort, but he pushes his plate away with his good hand. The diocese\
    \ is paying his bill at the inn. Totted up in the innkeeper's head and nowhere\
    \ else. Snitby turning to prayer. Mouth full of blood and sawdust. O Lord O Lord\
    \ why hast Thou forsaken me?\nSnitby playing Demented Virtual Needlework on his\
    \ iPad.\nSnitby weeping on the quayside. Tears blurring his vision. He cannot\
    \ make out the horizon, simply a blank grey blue expanse. Fussing with rosary\
    \ beads in his pocket. Given up the gaspers for now. Cries of gulls and clanks\
    \ of tugboats. Foghorns on a clear day. A marching Salvation Army band. Catholicism\
    \ versus muscular Christianity. It's an endless battle with no winners. Snitby\
    \ asked for a nun. He was sure this seaside resort had a convent, right on the\
    \ harbour. He had his resorts all mixed up. Fifty miles from the causeway on the\
    \ other side from Taddy. At high speed in a Japanese car with blinking lights\
    \ and a siren. And motorbike outriders. And two helicopters. Promised a nun on\
    \ arrival. Not in writing. Snitby's dog still tied to its post in Taddy. Fawned\
    \ over by passing widow-women. One will untie it and take it home to a cottage\
    \ in the woods. It will run away and perish on a railway line beneath a thundering\
    \ locomotive. The nun will hear about the accident on a nun's grapevine but decide\
    \ not to tell Snitby, Snitby in extremis.\nSnitby scraping his serial number on\
    \ his iSlate.\nTransportation to shores afar\n  But the gates of heaven are left\
    \ ajar\n  Repent while you can\n  Repent while you can\n  O you base and wretched\
    \ man\nO'er the sea to a distant shore\n  To see your homeland nevermore\n  Repent\
    \ while you can\n  Repent while you can\n  O you base and wretched man\nSnitby\
    \ jumping overboard."
