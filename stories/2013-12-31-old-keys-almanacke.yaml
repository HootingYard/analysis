  text: "For several centuries, Old Key's Almanacke has proved an eerily and unerringly\
    \ accurate prognostication of significant events due to occur in the next twelvemonth.\
    \ Here is what lies in store in the Year of Our Lord MMXIV, as predicted by Old\
    \ Key himself.\nJanuary\_: \u201CCones\u201D appear at the site of a road closure.\n\
    February\_: Scientists discover a new anagram of Pol Pot.\nMarch\_: A scribbler\
    \ publishes a fatuity in The Guardian.\nApril\_: Down at the docks, noisome ooze\
    \ and bilgewater.\nMay\_: The De Botton Conundrum is solved, to universal rejoicing.\n\
    June : In a hotel, a doctor demands his sausages.\nJuly\_: Vince Cable stands\
    \ windswept upon Westminster Bridge.\nAugust\_: The mighty look on the works of\
    \ Ozymandias and despair!\nSeptember\_: The crystal ball is cloudy, but we descry\
    \ something about a footballer and his hamstring.\nOctober\_: Eggs hatch on a\
    \ farm.\nNovember : The iFry is launched, a simulacrum of Stephen Fry that witters\
    \ incessantly and is small enough to be tossed into a wastepaper basket.\nDecember\_\
    : Jesus Christ returns, his image appearing on a slice of toast."
