    On New Year''s Eve, you will recall, we published Old Key''s Almanacke, a set
    of eerily unerring prognostications for the coming twelvemonth plucked from the
    aether by Old Key. Now, in today''s Dabbler, Old Key''s Almanacke reappears ...
    yet each and every prognostication is different! What in the name of heaven can
    this mean?

    The best way to find out, of course, would be to question Old Key himself. But
    where to find this eldritch figure, shrouded in a moth-eaten black cape besplattered
    with stars, a pointy hat atop his potato-shaped head? Old Key is famously elusive,
    and indeed some say he does not actually exist.

    Even if he does exist, I have to say that the appearance of two entirely different
    sets of prognostications casts doubt on the worth of Old Key''s scrying skills.
    It may be that, slumped over his fiendish diagrams in his mountaintop redoubt,
    he simply makes it all up.

    ADDENDUM : Dear Mr Key, writes Poppy Nisbet, I confess myself befuddled. One minute
    you say you do not know where to find Old Key, and indeed question his very existence,
    and then in almost the same breath you describe his appearance and pinpoint his
    location to a mountaintop redoubt. If anybody is unreliable here, it is you! Please
    explain what is going on.

    I would happily respond in excruciating detail to Ms Nisbet, but unfortunately
    I have been issued with a notice to cease and desist by Old Key''s legal representatives.
    They have not specified from what, precisely, I should cease and desist, and I
    am not taking any chances. Nor would you, if you saw the huge malevolent snorting
    and stamping trio of horses, Freeman Hardy & Willis, astride which the lawyers
    came thundering to my door.'
