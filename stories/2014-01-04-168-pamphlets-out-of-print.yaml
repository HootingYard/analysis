  text: 'For the past several years, reader Mike Jennings has spent his time very
    usefully compiling a reliable list of the works of Dobson. Once a year, at around
    this time, he updates the list to include those pamphlets to which reference has
    been made in these pages during the previous twelvemonth. And bang on time, here
    he is with an additional eight titles. Each has appended to it one of those damnably
    clever Blotzmann numbers. Please note that, unless otherwise stated, these titles
    are out of print.
