  text: 'Oi, you lot. This is a plea for money, and for once it is not an unseemly
    begging letter asking you to plop a few groats into the coffers of Mr Key''s Fund
    For Distressed Out Of Print Pamphleteers, though of course you can do that too.
    On this occasion, however, honour, duty, and sheer common sense calls you to send
    money, or indeed monies, to the world''s finest radio station. Here is what the
    powers that be at ResonanceFM have to say:

    Dear Friends of Hooting Yard,

    Resonance is currently trying to raise money to bolster its imminent application
    to Arts Council England. To this end, the radio station wants to build reserves--savings
    which indicate its financial resilience and which it can draw upon in exceptional
    circumstances.

    If you enjoy Hooting Yard On The Air, please help us by donating to Resonance
    today. You can do this here on our website, or here via JustGiving.

    And if you are a UK tax payer you can add value to your donation to our registered
    charity (number 290236) through GiftAid. All it takes is fifty listeners of Hooting
    Yard donating PS10 each for us to reach this year''s target. Please mention Hooting
    Yard in your communication.

    Resonance does not own a building, so has few material assets; nor does it charge
    for its service, so it very much relies on the generosity of you, its listeners.
    Please take a moment to show your appreciation of our broadcasts and secure the
    station''s future. Thank you!'
