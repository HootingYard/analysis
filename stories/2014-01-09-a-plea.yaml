  text: "Oi, you lot. This is a plea for money, and for once it is not an unseemly\
    \ begging letter asking you to plop a few groats into the coffers of Mr Key's\
    \ Fund For Distressed Out Of Print Pamphleteers, though of course you can do that\
    \ too. On this occasion, however, honour, duty, and sheer common sense calls you\
    \ to send money, or indeed monies, to the world's finest radio station. Here is\
    \ what the powers that be at ResonanceFM have to say:\nDear Friends of Hooting\
    \ Yard,\nResonance is currently trying to raise money to bolster its imminent\
    \ application to Arts Council England. To this end, the radio station wants to\
    \ build reserves\u2014savings which indicate its financial resilience and which\
    \ it can draw upon in exceptional circumstances.\nIf you enjoy Hooting Yard On\
    \ The Air, please help us by donating to Resonance today. You can do this here\
    \ on our website, or here via JustGiving.\nAnd if you are a UK tax payer you can\
    \ add value to your donation to our registered charity (number 290236) through\
    \ GiftAid. All it takes is fifty listeners of Hooting Yard donating \xA310 each\
    \ for us to reach this year's target. Please mention Hooting Yard in your communication.\n\
    Resonance does not own a building, so has few material assets; nor does it charge\
    \ for its service, so it very much relies on the generosity of you, its listeners.\
    \ Please take a moment to show your appreciation of our broadcasts and secure\
    \ the station's future. Thank you!"
