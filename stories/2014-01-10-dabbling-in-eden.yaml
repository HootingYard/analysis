  text: "\nThe monopod flautist Ian Anderson once sang about the time \u201Cwhen the\
    \ Eve-bitten apple returned to destroy the tree\u201D. I have no idea what he\
    \ was going on about, and I suspect Mr Anderson may just have wanted something\
    \ to rhyme with the \u201Csea\u201D and \u201Cto be\u201D endings of the preceding\
    \ lines in his song.\nIn any case, it is the time before the apple returned to\
    \ the Garden of Eden that concerns me today, over in my cupboard at The Dabbler,\
    \ the editor of which found this splendidly apt picture with which to illustrate\
    \ the piece.\n"
