  text: 'If you wish to listen to Mr Key reading out the titles of all 168 out of
    print pamphlets by Dobson--and you do!, you do!--then all you have to do is point
    the pointy thing on your computer screen here, sit back, wring out your ears,
    and wallow for half an hour in the sheer glorious foolishness of it all.
