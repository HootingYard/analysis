  text: 'I tripped and toppled and tumbled down and down and came to land flat on
    my back in Dingly Dell. A bump or two to the head during my tumble conked me out,
    and by the time I awoke, flat on my back in Dingly Dell, the sky was growing dark.
    Up above, I saw the first flickers of stars. Closer to the ground, too, I saw
    two small points of light. I reasoned they must be the glittering eyes of a nameless
    dell-dwelling beast, and I sat up.

    Was it a wolf? Was it a badger? It has been said of me that I am insanely courageous
    when confronted by unknown quadrupeds. I picked up a pebble and chucked it, aiming
    at a point directly between the two lights.

    "Ouch!" I heard.

    It was a human ouch, an all too human ouch. I felt immediately mortified. I concur
    with Terence, who said "humani nihil a me alienum puto", or "nothing that is human
    is alien to me". I was ashamed that I had so thoughtlessly pelted one of my own
    fellows with a pebble.

    "Forgive me!" I cried, before the figure had even emerged from the dusk-struck
    Dingly Dell duff. When it did so emerge, I saw that it was a man oh! very much
    like me, but of considerably smaller stature. That explained why the points of
    light were nearer to the ground, why I had mistaken them for the eyes of something
    inhuman that crawls upon the earth on all fours.

    "Forgiveness is not in my nature," said the little man who now stood before me,
    "I am vengeful, and when panic-stricken, irrationally so. Watch!"

    And then he performed what I can only describe as a dazzling if incomprehensible
    fanfaronade of acrobatic imbecility.

    "Allow me to introduce myself," he said when he was done, as if nothing dazzling
    and incomprehensible and acrobatic and imbecilic had happened, "I am the dwarf
    Crepusco, helpmeet and factotum to Prince Fulgencio, who lives up yonder far from
    Dingly Dell in a benighted and crumbling castle swarming with mice and bats. The
    word most often applied to me, apart from dwarvish and Machiavellian and too clever
    by half, is indispensable. And it is my very indispensability which caused the
    green entwining tendrils of envy to form in the heads of Prince Fulgencio''s more
    dimwitted and brutish henchmen, tendrils that grew so rapidly they choked off
    what little sense was lodged in those henchmen heads, until come last Thursday
    several of them lay in wait for me behind an arras anent a balustrade hard by
    the castle crenellations, and when I passed by with my nosegay and the Pin-Cushion
    of Gaar, they waylaid me and stuffed me into a sack and carried me off I knew
    not where. I screeched and struggled to no avail, for I am of diminutive frame
    and the henchmen are huge great brutes, like giant oxen.

    "It is worth noting that just before they tied the sack shut, I saw them trample
    my nosegay underfoot and toss the Pin-Cushion of Gaar over the castle crenellations,
    so I can only assume it fell into the moat and is now sopping wet if it has not
    been devoured by one of Prince Fulgencio''s snapping scavenger fish. The Prince
    regularly checks their stomach innards with a fiendishly intricate X-ray scoping
    contraption I devised for him, and Lord knows what will happen when he discovers
    whatever remains of the Pin-Cushion of Gaar. If he puts two and two together--and
    I have to say that is a big if, for Prince Fulgencio has a tiny brain like all
    his forebears--he will learn of his henchmen''s perfidy. His wrath will be apocalyptic.
    But without me by his side to direct his actions, he will no doubt muck everything
    up, blaming the alignment of stars in the heavens, hanging the wrong henchmen,
    and splattering his morning porridge on the castle walls.

    "What he will not do is think to send out a search-and-rescue helicopter to search
    for and rescue me. I am going to have to take care of that myself, though it is
    beyond even my wit to know how to expedite such a mission. I was thinking hard
    on that very matter, hidden in the duff, when you pelted me with a pebble, jolting
    my cranium and thus wreaking havoc with the fine tuning of my elegant cogitations.
    Now I shall have to begin again.

    "You are probably wondering how I know I am in the Dingly Dell, given that I was
    delivered here while tied up and muffled in a sack. Yes, those traitorous henchmen
    carried me here all the way from the castle, before depositing me in that dell-ditch
    over there. By the time I managed to make my escape from the sack and clamber
    up and out of the ditch, the henchmen were gone. But being ineradicably stupid,
    they had left behind the steam-powered satnav that had guided them hither. It
    was almost exhausted of power, and was about to hiss and splutter to a halt, but
    I just about had time to read the co-ordinates on its display. All I need do now
    is recover from the effects of that pebble-blow, then work out how to contact
    the search-and-rescue helicopter control tower. An ordinary, dense person would
    be helpless, but I am the dwarf Crepusco, and nothing, nothing!, is beyond me!"

    I must admit that while the little man was telling me all this, I dozed off. I
    have only been able to transcribe the entirety of his speech because he left behind
    him a Dictabelt recording, similar to the Dictabelt recordings made by the police
    motorcyclists accompanying the presidential motorcade in Dallas on 22 November
    1963, that is, acoustically bewildering and fuzzy. But I managed to make out Crepusco''s
    words after having the recording enhanced using the most up to date new techniques.

    I was awakened from my doze by the whirring of helicopter blades. By the time
    I sat up and rubbed my head and took a sip of Squelcho! from my canteen, the helicopter
    was gone, taking the dwarf Crepusco with it. I wished the little man well, stood
    up, placed my empty Squelcho! can in the Dingly Dell Municipal Waste Chute which,
    as I learned in a lantern lecture I once attended, terminates at the earth''s
    core, pounded my chest with my fists like a large and energetic monkey, and wended
    my way, up and out of Dingly Dell, towards the worst horror of all.'
