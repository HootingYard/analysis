    Over at The Dabbler today, the tale of Little Dagobert, The Strongest Boy In The
    Universe. This acts as a preview for the imminent Kindle anthology By Aerostat
    To Hooting Yard : A Frank Key Reader, published next week by Dabbler Editions.
    I shall have more to say about this definitive collection next Tuesday, when it
    will become available. In the meantime, please bear in mind that you lot will
    be harried and hectored relentlessly until you have (a) bought a copy, and (b)
    harried and hectored, in your turn, every single person you know to buy a copy,
    and (c) propelled it, if not to the very top of the e-bestseller lists, at least
    to the point where I am in with a chance of winning the mrs joyful prize for rafia
    work.'
