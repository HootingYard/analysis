  text: "My grassy knoll potsage the other day prompted a keen-eyed reader to bring\
    \ to my attention something called Project Unspeakable. According to its Facecloth\
    \ page, this \u201Cproject\u201D aims to \u201Cchallenge the silence surrounding\
    \ the assassination\u201D of President Kennedy and three other \u201Cleaders for\
    \ peace\u201D (Robert Kennedy, Dr King (as we must always call him), and Malcolm\
    \ X).\nEr \u2026 what silence is that, precisely? There are so many books about\
    \ the JFK assassination that even Vincent Bugliosi hasn't had time\u2014in the\
    \ twenty-plus years he worked on his book\u2014to read all of them. Not to mention\
    \ the magazine articles, television documentaries, and feature films. The deaths\
    \ of the other three have not attracted quite that level of attention, but they\
    \ have hardly been ignored and cast into the dustbin of history (\xA9\_Leon Trotsky,\
    \ another murderee who surely ought to be on Project Unspeakable's list. Oh, hang\
    \ on, he wasn't American, and he was ice-picked by a Stalinist agent, so in Unspeakable\
    \ circles that's probably all above board.)\nThe \u201Cconspiracy of silence\u201D\
    \ is about as silent as Hooting Yard, which as you know hardly ever shuts up."
