    Now here is a treat for you lot. The splendid persons at Dabbler Editions, purveyors
    of e-books to the e-literate, have launched upon the world an e-anthology of Mr
    Key''s outpourings. By Aerostat To Hooting Yard : A Frank Key Reader contains
    147 stories selected by the estimable Roland Clare, who has also written a scholarly
    introduction. Truly it may be said he has pored over numberless sweeping paragraphs
    of majestic prose and has actually managed to work out some of the things going
    on inside Mr Key''s brainpans.

    According to the Dabbler, the anthology is "baffling, brilliant, brutal, and hysterically
    funny". It is also dirt cheap, well within the means of even the most impecunious
    reader (few, if any, of whom are as impecunious as Mr Key himself). And remember,
    you do not need a Kindle to read a Kindle e-book. There are plenty of ways to
    read this earth-shattering and heart-rending tome on any of the electronic contraptions
    you might have lying about in your hovel. Just ask your nearest computer whizz
    person.

    So the basic idea is that you go and buy the book from amazon.co.uk or amazon.com
    or amazon.wherever-you-are. You then award it five stars and post a review explaining
    that it is the most noble effusion of the human spirit since [insert previous
    noble effusion of your choice]. You then harry and hector everybody you know,
    and buttonhole strangers in the street, also to buy the book. And on the seventh
    day you may put your feet up and actually read it.

    Come on, readers. If you cannot make this the bestselling e-book of all time,
    you can at least ensure that Mr Key is in with a chance of winning the mrs joyful
    prize for rafia work.

    N.B. Those of you active on Facecloth and Twitter should strain every sinew to
    splurge news of the book all over the place. Remember, you will get your reward
    in heaven.'
