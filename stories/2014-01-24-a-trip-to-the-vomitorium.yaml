  text: 'Following the unseemly decision of Penguin Books to publish the maunderings
    of a has-been pop singer as a "Classic", we now have the equally risible sight
    of the British Library paying PS100,000 for the collected scribblings and jottings
    of the hugely untalented writer Hanif Kureishi.

    "Kureishi said it was important that it was the British Library that looked after
    the archive", apparently--my italics--thus winning this week''s Self-Regarding
    Wanker Award.
