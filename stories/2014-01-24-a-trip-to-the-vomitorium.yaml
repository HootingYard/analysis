  text: 'Following the unseemly decision of Penguin Books to publish the maunderings
    of a has-been pop singer as a "Classic", we now have the equally risible sight
    of the British Library paying PS100,000 for the collected scribblings and jottings
    of the hugely untalented writer Hanif Kureishi.

    the archive", apparently--my italics--thus winning this week''s Self-Regarding
    Wanker Award.
