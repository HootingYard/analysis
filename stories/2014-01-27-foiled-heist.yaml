  text: "Earlier today I had an errand to do which involved taking a rather large\
    \ sum of cash to the bank. (My idea of what constitutes a \u201Clarge sum\u201D\
    \ may not be yours.) Pansy Cradledew fretted that I might be waylaid by malefactors\
    \ and ne'er-do-wells, so when I got back\u2014safe and sound\u2014I sent her a\
    \ reassuring message. I swear on my mother's life* that every word of this is\
    \ true.\nJust a note to let you know that as I was leaving the bank, several chaps\
    \ in stocking masks burst in waving firearms and shouting at everyone to get on\
    \ the floor. I executed a quick tableau vivant of a scene from Die Hard (John\
    \ McTiernan, 1988), and the villains were so awestruck by the verisimilitude of\
    \ my pose that they were stunned, staring goggle-eyed and dropping their guns.\
    \ After that it was a simple enough matter to summon Detective Captain Cargpan\
    \ and his rufty tufty henchmen, who placed them under arrest while I sashayed\
    \ off to catch the bus.\n*NOTA BENE\_: Ms Cradledew has asked me to point out\
    \ that my mother died twenty years ago, a fact which she says utterly invalidates\
    \ my swearage. That may well be so, but I know my onions."
