  text: 'Earlier today I had an errand to do which involved taking a rather large
    sum of cash to the bank. (My idea of what constitutes a "large sum" may not be
    yours.) Pansy Cradledew fretted that I might be waylaid by malefactors and ne''er-do-wells,
    so when I got back--safe and sound--I sent her a reassuring message. I swear on
    my mother''s life* that every word of this is true.

    Just a note to let you know that as I was leaving the bank, several chaps in stocking
    masks burst in waving firearms and shouting at everyone to get on the floor. I
    executed a quick tableau vivant of a scene from Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988),
    and the villains were so awestruck by the verisimilitude of my pose that they
    were stunned, staring goggle-eyed and dropping their guns. After that it was a
    simple enough matter to summon Detective Captain Cargpan and his rufty tufty henchmen,
    who placed them under arrest while I sashayed off to catch the bus.

    *NOTA BENE : Ms Cradledew has asked me to point out that my mother died twenty
    years ago, a fact which she says utterly invalidates my swearage. That may well
    be so, but I know my onions.'
