    A number of readers and listeners have written to me on the subject of Hooting
    Yard podcasts, generally along the lines of "Oi, Mr Key! My life has become barren
    and empty and devoid of purpose and it is all your fault. Where once I could rely
    on weekly, or even twice-weekly, new Hooting Yard podcasts, nowadays they only
    turn up once in a blue moon. What in the name of heaven is going on?"

    I ought to explain that I am as bewildered as my correspondents. Once a week,
    more or less, I go to the Resonance studio and babble into a microphone for half
    an hour, live on air. How any of what I say eventually finds its way onto the
    ethereal mews and boulevards of Interwebshire has always been a profound mystery
    to me.

    However, I have good news for all those of you biting your pillows in despair.
    All episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air are now uploaded, regularly and promptly,
    to the ResonanceFM Hooting Yard Soundcloud Archive. As I write, there are twenty-eight
    shows online, with which to siphon out your ears. Turn on, tune in, yelp with
    glee!'
