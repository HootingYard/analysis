  text: "\nA number of readers and listeners have written to me on the subject of\
    \ Hooting Yard podcasts, generally along the lines of \u201COi, Mr Key! My life\
    \ has become barren and empty and devoid of purpose and it is all your fault.\
    \ Where once I could rely on weekly, or even twice-weekly, new Hooting Yard podcasts,\
    \ nowadays they only turn up once in a blue moon. What in the name of heaven is\
    \ going on?\u201D\nI ought to explain that I am as bewildered as my correspondents.\
    \ Once a week, more or less, I go to the Resonance studio and babble into a microphone\
    \ for half an hour, live on air. How any of what I say eventually finds its way\
    \ onto the ethereal mews and boulevards of Interwebshire has always been a profound\
    \ mystery to me.\nHowever, I have good news for all those of you biting your pillows\
    \ in despair. All episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air are now uploaded, regularly\
    \ and promptly, to the ResonanceFM Hooting Yard Soundcloud Archive. As I write,\
    \ there are twenty-eight shows online, with which to siphon out your ears. Turn\
    \ on, tune in, yelp with glee!"
