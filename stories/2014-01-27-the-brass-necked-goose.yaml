  text: 'There is a story I remember from my childhood called "The Brass-Necked Goose".
    Or rather, I remember the title, but not much of the story itself. As far as I
    recall it involved a goose that was ordinary in all particulars except that its
    neck was made of brass. One accepts such improbabilities as a child, as indeed
    one continues to accept them, when grown, if the spinner of improbable tales is
    a skilled one.

    If, for instance, a Latin American magical realist with a clutch of literary awards
    under his or her belt introduces into a fat novel a goose with a neck of brass,
    we might have a moment where we say "pish!" or "pshaw!", we might even chuck the
    book across the room into the fireplace, but more likely, given the laurels with
    which the writer is garlanded, we will accept the goose and read on, dazzled by
    the author''s inventiveness.

    On the other hand, if we are reading a book by some lesser-known writer, and one,
    say, whose infelicities of style and bone-headed stupidity have already tempted
    us to chuck the book into the fireplace, and then, as we are growing increasingly
    exasperated, a goose with a brass neck is introduced for no compelling reason
    on page 114, then "pish!" or "pshaw!" are going to be the mildest expletives with
    which we will erupt, accompanied no doubt by curses unsuitable for delicate ears.
    We will also be likely not only to give in to the temptation and to chuck the
    book into the fireplace after all, but to ensure that a roaring fire is blazing
    therein, the better to obliterate this farrago of printed nonsense from our memories.

    But as children, we do not care two pins for the literary reputation of the writer,
    and we are immune to infelicities of style and even to bone-headed stupidity.
    As children, we are caught up in the story, however improbable, however ill-written.
    For one thing, we are probably not reading but being read to, by Mama, as we lie
    tucked snug in bed, our bellies warm with milk, our eyes fixed on the paper stars
    glued to our bedroom ceiling. When we are told that Ipsy Dipsy, limping along
    the lane, meets a goose with a brass neck, we simply accept that this is the kind
    of thing that happens to Ipsy Dipsy, and might even happen to us, if ever we find
    ourselves walking along a country lane, unlikely as that may be given that we
    live in a hideous urban sprawl with barely a sprig of greenery to be seen.

    I said I could not recall the story, but see! see!, I have remembered Ipsy Dipsy
    and the lane. Little details reappear in my mind''s eye. I remember Ipsy Dipsy''s
    pointy red hat, and the callipers on his legs, for Ipsy Dipsy was a cripple, at
    least at the beginning of the story. I remember the lane, it was a lane like the
    avenue at Middelharnis painted by Hobbema. Was Ipsy Dipsy Dutch, or Flemish? Was
    he still wearing the callipers at the story''s end, or had he been able to cast
    them aside, to throw them happily into a ditch, on account of some magical cure
    effected by the goose? Did the goose''s magic powers inhere in his brass neck?

    As quickly as the memories come shimmering, like the paper stars on the ceiling
    long ago, so, equally quickly, they fade, like the stars will fade in the heavens.
    The night sky will be black, and vast, and pitiless. And I will totter about,
    fumbling in the darkness, aged and exhausted, knowing that there will be no brass-necked
    goose to save me from extinction.'
