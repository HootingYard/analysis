  text: 'Sag'' mir, wo die Blumen sind? I can scarcely credit that over a quarter
    of a century has passed since I wrote, illustrated, photocopied, folded, collated,
    stapled, signed and numbered fifty copies of The Churn In The Muck. Now, this
    spineless out of print pamphlet will set you back PS93. That''s how much a copy
    is selling for on eBay.


    What do you get for your cash? "Vintage Frank Key surrealist writing, in a booklet
    that contains 4 pages of wallpaper sample and 4 pages of tracing paper. There
    is a murderous rivalry over an Icelandic fontoon buried at the bottom of a lake.
    Indefatigable Hungarian detective Bulent Hellbag arrives on the scene to solve
    the case", according to Serendipity Bookstore in the far Antipodes. I should point
    out that, in addition to the wallpaper and tracing paper, there are actually pages
    of text, too. (I am not sure the blurb makes that quite clear.)'
