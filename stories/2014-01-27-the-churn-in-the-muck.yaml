  text: "Sag\u2019 mir, wo die Blumen sind? I can scarcely credit that over a quarter\
    \ of a century has passed since I wrote, illustrated, photocopied, folded, collated,\
    \ stapled, signed and numbered fifty copies of The Churn In The Muck. Now, this\
    \ spineless out of print pamphlet will set you back \xA393. That's how much a\
    \ copy is selling for on eBay.\n\nWhat do you get for your cash? \u201CVintage\
    \ Frank Key surrealist writing, in a booklet that contains 4 pages of wallpaper\
    \ sample and 4 pages of tracing paper. There is a murderous rivalry over an Icelandic\
    \ fontoon buried at the bottom of a lake. Indefatigable Hungarian detective Bulent\
    \ Hellbag arrives on the scene to solve the case\u201D, according to Serendipity\
    \ Bookstore in the far Antipodes. I should point out that, in addition to the\
    \ wallpaper and tracing paper, there are actually pages of text, too. (I am not\
    \ sure the blurb makes that quite clear.)"
