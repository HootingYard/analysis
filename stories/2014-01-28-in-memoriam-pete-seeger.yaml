  text: 'News reaches Mr Key''s waxy ears of the death of Pete Seeger (1919--2014),
    so it seems appropriate to repost this piece from five years ago.

    I had a hammer. I hammered in the morning. I hammered in the evening all over
    this land. I hammered out danger. I hammered out a warning. I hammered out love
    between my brothers and my sisters all over this land. They should have seen that
    coming. As I said, before I hammered the love out of them, I hammered out a warning.
    It was hardly my fault if they thought I was just larking about. Personally, if
    I had seen one of my siblings roaring towards me at dusk, armed with a hammer,
    I''d have made a run for it, particularly when it was clear I had been hammering
    things all day all over this land.

    Anyway, I had a good night''s sleep, and the next day I continued hammering. There
    was not much left to hammer in this land, so I crossed the border. I hammered
    the fence and the border guards, and then I had a happy day hammering everything
    that lay in my path in this new country. Bang bang bang, that was me, with the
    occasional dull thump if I hammered something soft and squishy. I didn''t discriminate.
    If I saw it, I hammered it, it really was as simple as that.

    But then I was fortunate to have such a good hammer. When my hammering was still
    in the planning stages, it was suggested to me that I should obtain a silver hammer
    from Maxwell''s. "Pshaw!" I said. I actually said "Pshaw!", like a character in
    a bad play from the interwar years. But I was right to do so. Maxwell''s silver
    hammer was fashionable enough, in its time, but the kind of hammering I intended
    to do required something sturdier, a real thumper. So I got my hammer from Hubermann''s.
    I was so pleased with it that I hammered my way out of the shop, and didn''t stop
    hammering until I got home.

    It was the following day that I started to hammer all over this land. Then, the
    day after that, I hammered my way half way across the neighbouring land. It was
    much bigger, and much more densely packed with people and things, so I had a lot
    more hammering to do than in my own land. But eventually I got to the frontier,
    having hammered pretty much everything in sight. As I nestled down for the night
    in a border chalet, I inspected my hammer, and was pleased to see that it was
    almost as good as new. There were a couple of scuff-marks, and quite a lot of
    blood, but otherwise it looked as if it would serve me well for as long as I continued
    hammering, all over as many lands as I descended upon, like an angel of death,
    with my hammer.'
