  text: "One la-la-la morning, Tiny Enid was limping along the cliffs at the edge\
    \ of the Big Frightening Sea when, across the sky, zooming directly at her, came\
    \ a gigantic colourful bewinged flying insect of unknown provenance. Most infants\
    \ would have screeched in terror and cried for Ma or Pa to rescue them, but of\
    \ course the plucky fascist tot was not most infants. She raised her arms, as\
    \ if in terror, to pull the wool over the huge airborne being's eyes, if it actually\
    \ had any, and screech she did, but it was a screech not of fright but of blood-curdling\
    \ menace. It was so terrific a screech that the enormous brightly-coloured mothish\
    \ type of thing was immediately deafened, playing havoc with its complicated navigational\
    \ head integuments, and it plummeted forthwith into the broiling waters where,\
    \ unable to swim, it drowned.\nTiny Enid let fall her arms and patted the pocket\
    \ wherein she carried her tiny toy Mannlicher-Carcano sniper's rifle which, in\
    \ spite of being tiny, and a toy, was a devastatingly effective firearm.\n\u201C\
    I am glad I did not have to use my trusty sniper's rifle to slaughter that curious\
    \ wing-flapping monster,\u201D she thought, \u201CFor it remains fully loaded\
    \ and I can put the bullets to better use, should I happen later this morning\
    \ to come upon malefactors and ne'er-do-wells roaming the cliffs.\u201D\nAs indeed\
    \ she did, but that is another story for another, more gruesome, time.\n\nIllustration\
