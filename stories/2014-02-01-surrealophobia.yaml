  text: 'I make no apology for the fact that I have become a rabid surrealophobe.
    We need to be careful with our terminology, however. Time was when a phobia meant
    an irrational fear--as in triskaidekaphobia, fear of the number 13. Nowadays,
    in our debased world, the -phobia suffix has come to denote little more than hatred,
    irrational because it is not shared by right-on Guardian reading types. Thus homophobia
    and Islamophobia, for instance. This is not the place to take a forensic fork
    to the weird interior world of Guardian readers, who are generally tolerant of
    absolutely everything except everything with which they disagree, which is verboten,
    forever and ever.

    It must be understood, then, that I have neither an irrational fear nor hatred
    of surrealists. Quite the contrary. What I hate, with a loathing that seems to
    me entirely reasonable, is the bandying about of the word "surreal" to refer to
    the mildly out of the ordinary, or at times even the wholly ordinary.

    "Oh wow it was surreal", a halfwit will announce, panting with stupidity, at something
    or other. I have heard such exclamations yelped at sight of, for example, a minor
    traffic accident, a malfunctioning self-service till in a supermarket, and a cat
    behaving like a cat. There is not a jot of surrealism in any of these things.
    Anybody who thinks--let alone jabbers aloud--that there is needs the innards of
    their head sluiced out with a powerful antistupidity solvent.

    It may be time to begin a campaign to Bring Back Real Surrealism, with badges
    and banners and marches and petitions and chance encounters of sewing machines
    and umbrellas on operating tables.

    NOTA BENE : Mr Key is not a surrealist. His work is not surrealism.
