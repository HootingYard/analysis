  text: "The other day, I was walking up and down the City Road when my weasel popped.\
    \ I ought to explain that I take Alan, my pet weasel, with me whenever I go trudging\
    \ through the city streets. He is a well-behaved weasel and does not need to be\
    \ kept on a leash. Usually, Alan will scurry just ahead of me, acting in some\
    \ sorts like a seeing-eye weasel. I am myopic rather than blind, and wear spectacles\
    \ with corrective lenses, so I do not actually need Alan to guide me, but I think\
    \ it makes him feel useful and important to do so. Studies have shown that weasels\
    \ do not generally suffer from low self-esteem--heaven forfend that they should!--and\
    \ perhaps I am being indulgent in allowing Alan to think I depend on him. But\
    \ that is my way.\nAnyway, there we were, somewhere up or down the City Road,\
    \ more or less within spitting distance of Moorfields Eye Hospital, when Alan\
    \ suddenly popped, as if he were a balloon. It was a most extraordinary sight,\
    \ one I won't forget in a hurry. One minute I was sashaying along with Alan scurrying\
    \ just ahead of me, on the lookout for something smaller than himself which he\
    \ could rip to bloody pieces with his claws and fangs, and then pop! there was\
    \ a popping sound, and all that remained of my pet weasel were a few shreds of\
    \ fur and skin and bits of bone on the pavement.\nNot knowing quite what to do,\
    \ I spat in the direction of Moorfields Eye Hospital. I do not as a rule condone\
    \ spitting in the street. It is a filthy habit practised by the lower orders and\
    \ certain foreigners, one which I abhor, but the popping of Alan had left my brainpans\
    \ ajangle. I had read somewhere, probably in an out of print pamphlet by Dobson,\
    \ that to spit at a large and important medical institution could, in some circumstances,\
    \ clear the head and help to determine a sensible course of action. How the pamphleteer\
    \ dreamed up such halfwittery is beyond me. The sole result of my spitting was\
    \ that I was Tasered by a passing copper.\nAs I sprawled, twitching and breathless,\
    \ on the pavement, there came a great thunderclap. And then it began to rain,\
    \ great drenching sheets pouring down from the heavens, washing away every trace\
    \ of Alan that remained.\nAbove me, the copper was explaining that I was under\
    \ arrest for antisocial behaviour (the spitting), resisting arrest (lying sprawled\
    \ instead of accompanying him to the station) , and what he termed \"sundry other\
    \ offences\" (undefined). I reflected bitterly that Alan, had he not popped, would\
    \ have slashed at the copper and disfigured him, allowing me to make my getaway.\
    \ But then I further reflected that I would have been a fugitive from justice,\
    \ me and my weasel, forced into hiding, holed up in some weasel-friendly hotel,\
    \ never more than one step ahead of the law. That was no life for a boulevardier\
    \ and his pet weasel.\nAnd then it hit me that Alan was gone, gone forever, popped!,\
    \ in an instant, and I was alone. I held up my arms so the copper could cuff my\
    \ wrists, and went quietly..\nOn City Road, in the pouring rain\n  Sprawled upon\
    \ a paving stone\n  This man is solitary, all alone\n  And there are jangles in\
    \ his brain\n  His weasel popped, and it was gone.\n  Da doo ron ron ron da doo\
    \ ron ron."
