  text: "I am a Bible-basher. I bash my Bible. Usually, I bash it with my fists, bare-knuckled.\
    \ Sometimes I wear boxing gloves. Occasionally I will give it a few hefty thumps\
    \ with a rubber sap weighted with lead, more commonly deployed down dark alleyways\
    \ by miscreants wearing trenchcoats in films noir. Or, if I am having one of my\
    \ fits of hysteria, I will bash my Bible with whatever comes to hand, such as\
    \ a plank of wood, a hammer, or a police truncheon. I am retired from the force\
    \ now, but I still have a few truncheons lying around the flat here and there.\n\
    It happens from time to time that the din I create when bashing my Bible disturbs\
    \ my downstairs neighbours. I am not sure if the ground floor flat is some kind\
    \ of suburban seminary, but it is riddled with priests. Every so often one of\
    \ them will come upstairs and reproach me. They let themselves in, being in possession\
    \ of a set of keys to both my flat and my soul. It pains me that they think there\
    \ is something sacrilegious in my bashing.\nLetting fall my truncheon, or taking\
    \ off my boxing gloves, or one of the other alternatives, as it may be, I try\
    \ to explain to the priest what I am about. This bashing, I say, is done in a\
    \ spirit of piety and devotion to Our Lady of the Crumpled Vestments. Invariably,\
    \ no matter which of the priests has come up, there follows a theological debate\
    \ so abstruse and hermetic and pernickety that you would not have a clue what\
    \ I was talking about if I tried to summarise it in words of one syllable.\nWhat\
    \ I find most mysterious is that these debates are repeated every few days, with\
    \ one or another of the downstairs priests, whenever I get a bit carried away\
    \ bashing my Bible and make my floor, their ceiling, shake. Do they not talk to\
    \ each other, down in their ground floor flat full of crucifixes and prayer books\
    \ and censers? Do they never compare notes regarding the pious retired police\
    \ officer upstairs whose devotion to Our Lady of the Crumpled Vestments is, at\
    \ times, as I freely admit, maniacal? Do they not run through the theological\
    \ debates and try to work out, among themselves, a method of defeating my compelling\
    \ if abstruse logic? It seems they do not.\nThings go a little differently with\
    \ my upstairs neighbour, a voodoo worshipper whose terrifying devotions make an\
    \ even greater racket than my bashing. But I do not reproach her. In fact, I have\
    \ even offered to do her ironing for her. I am keen for her to take up my offer,\
    \ one day, for then I will iron her voodoo robes and gowns in such a way as to\
    \ reproduce precisely the creases and crumplings of Our Lady of the Crumpled Vestments\u2019\
    \ vestments. And one more soul may be saved for Christ."
