  text: "The word \u201CMedium\u201D to me suggests a Victorian charlatan in a darkened\
    \ room, summoning the spirits of the dead and spewing forth ectoplasm. \u201C\
    Medium\u201D is also, I learn, the name of a new(ish?) bit of interwebbery, a\
    \ repository for prose, a sort of amalgam of bloggery and twittering. Those more\
    \ familiar with these matters could no doubt explain it better. But Hooting Yard\
    \ is always bang up to the minute with the latest developments in technology,\
    \ and not just L'Oreal's light-reflecting booster technology. That is why Mr Key\
    \ has taken a tentative step into Medium, by reposting that recent spot of wittering\
    \ about surrealism.\nI may add further pieces to the site, and you lot can all\
    \ hie over there with your knapsacks and a packed lunch, and \u201Crecommend\u201D\
    \ me. Who knows if conquering Medium will be a profitable step on the path to\
    \ our ultimate goal of Hooting Yard Global Dominion?"
