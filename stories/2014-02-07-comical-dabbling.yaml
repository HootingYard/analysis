    Today the Guardian yet again employs the preposterous Russell Brand as a commentator.
    This time his overwritten wittering is about the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman,
    which gives the "alleged comedian" ((c) Peter Hitchens) another opportunity to
    tell us that he is a recovering addict. Well, who knew? He may indeed be recovering
    from drink and drugs, but I think it''s time he sought help for his pitiable addiction
    to babbling on and on about himself. Several decades in a Trappist monastery would
    be ideal.

    Which brings us to the more important topic of Mr Key, or rather to his cupboard
    in The Dabbler, which today contains a piece about the role played by comedians
    in the governance of Britain. Warning: I am afraid Brand is mentioned there again--I
    really must get a grip!--though only in passing, and you lot will be able to sluice
    him out of your brains by contemplating, instead, such stars of yesteryear as
    Wilson, Keppel, and Betty.
