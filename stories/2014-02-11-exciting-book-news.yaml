  text: 'You lot are already aware, I think, that Mr Key is a jolly, fun-crazed fellow,
    ever prepared to sprinkle a little happiness into your godawful lives. Indeed,
    I am often mistaken for Santa Claus, or at least a rakishly thin version of him
    dressed in drab rather than red, without a bulging sack of gift-wrapped treats
    for well-behaved tinies, and unaccompanied by reindeer. But those caveats aside,
    it can be hard to tell the difference, so lavishly do I spread joy and hysteria
    where''er I trudge.

    So it should come as no surprise that already, in mid-February, I have solved
    all your Christmas present purchasing worries for 2014. For on 6 November this
    year, the splendid publishing house of Constable will unleash upon a panting world
    Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives. You can already go and pre-order
    your copy.


    Now I had better finish writing the damned thing.'
