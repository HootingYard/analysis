  text: "Sinbad Hoonjaw ran amok. He fried some bean sprouts in a wok. And then he\
    \ stuffed them in a sock, for he is quite the nutter.\nSinbad Hoonjaw went astray.\
    \ He lay down on a bale of hay. He ate a bowl of Special K, then threw up in the\
    \ gutter.\nOh dearest Sinbad, take this clump, a clump of posies for your sprains,\
    \ I plucked it at the council dump, oh dear dear Sinbad rattle your chains.\n\
    The finest fellow that ever there was, I sing for Sinbad today because Sinbad\
    \ Hoonjaw's eyes are blue, and the number of eyes is thirty-two.\nThirty-two eyes?\
    \ Can that be so? And twenty feet from top to toe? A giant Sinbad with too many\
    \ eyes? Or is it just a clever disguise?\nIs he a dwarf in a paper suit? Does\
    \ anybody give a hoot? You say he's twee, you say he's cute. For he is Sinbad\
    \ Hoonjaw.\nBut I have news you'll hate to hear. He is about to disappear. Oh\
    \ do not sob a salty tear. Weep not for Sinbad Hoonjaw.\nHe was only ever a clutch\
    \ of syllables, jaw and bad and hoon and sin.\n  Now spit them out and into the\
    \ bin.\n  The dustbin of words, where you forage for meaning,\n  Like George Formby,\
    \ while window-cleaning.\n  You're up so high where the air is thin\n  Now spit\
    \ the words out into the bin."
