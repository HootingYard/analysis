  text: "\u201CHand me that chaffinch,\u201D said the ornithologist to his helpmeet.\n\
    Now it so happened that the helpmeet was a dimwit who could not tell one bird\
    \ from another. They all had beaks and feathers, so far as he was aware, but beyond\
    \ that he wallowed in a seething maelstrom of bird-ignorance. How then, we might\
    \ wonder, did he get the plum job of ornithologist's helpmeet? And be assured\
    \ it was a plum job indeed, as both plums and jobs go. It had been advertised\
    \ as such, in the \u201CPlums\u201D section of the Daily Ornithological Helpmeets\u2019\
    \ Situations Vacant listings magazine, price fourpence, available from several\
    \ tobacconists\u2019 kiosks in Pointy Town and environs.\nOn the night before\
    \ he saw the advertisement, the dimwit slept in the open air, under a viaduct.\
    \ This was not because he had no home to go to, for a home he had, and what a\
    \ home!, a manse, with serried belvederes, and too many servants to count. But\
    \ the dimwit, the day before, had foolishly gone a-wandering, and become hopelessly\
    \ lost. This was what usually happened when he strayed from the grounds of the\
    \ manse. Not only was he ignorant of birds, but he had absolutely no sense of\
    \ direction. His Papa had tried to teach him to orient his position on our spinning\
    \ globe by studying the sun in the day and the stars in the night, but such matters\
    \ were not within his grasp. He had difficulty craning his neck at the correct\
    \ angle so that his head, and eyes, were pointing at the sky. This was not on\
    \ account of any malformation of his neck. It was more a case of absent-mindedness.\
    \ He would begin to adjust his head to the correct angle and then be distracted\
    \ by, say, the ground-level sight of a heron eating a mole, and forget what he\
    \ was doing. He could not, of course, have identified the heron as a heron\u2014\
    nor the mole as a mole, he was such a dimwit!\u2014but he would be transfixed\
    \ by the spectacle, and gape, tongue lolling from his mouth, drool dribbling down\
    \ his chin, until one of the servants was dispatched to come and collect him,\
    \ tie him to the end of a tethering rope, and pull him gently back into the manse,\
    \ where Papa, despairing, stood hunched between a globe and an orrery, spinning\
    \ them turn and turn about, his eyes wet with tears.\nWaking under the viaduct\
    \ at dawn that day, the dimwit dithered and dawdled and found himself, some hours\
    \ later, at a tobacconist's kiosk hard by Sawdust Bridge. Anent the kiosk, in\
    \ a puddle, sat a pile of unsold copies of the previous day's edition of the Daily\
    \ Ornithological Helpmeets\u2019 Situations Vacant, tied up with string. What\
    \ prompted the dimwit to undo the bundle and take a copy of the magazine and repair\
    \ to a verdant arbour where courting couples had long ago scratched their initials\
    \ and cackhanded hearts entwined on the now rotting wood of the ruined bench and\
    \ sat upon the bench and leafed through the puddle-wet magazine and read and read\
    \ again and read a third time the advertisement for a plum job as helpmeet to\
    \ tiptop ornithologist Bruno La Poubelle we shall never know. What we do know\
    \ is that, as chance would have it\u2014or was it written in the stars?\u2014\
    Bruno La Poubelle himself came clattering into the arbour for a shifty fag break.\n\
    Clattering, because he was wearing his scarecrow suit, hung with myriad scraps\
    \ of tin. Shifty, because his ornithological research station hut had been declared\
    \ a No Smoking Zone by ornithologists even more tiptop than he.\nThe ornithologist\
    \ and the dimwit fell into conversation on the shattered bench. At this date we\
    \ cannot piece together what they spoke of, but far far away the Gulf of Tonkin\
    \ Incident had recently occurred, so it may be that it acted as an ice-breaker.\
    \ However it was, Bruno La Poubelle was persuaded, within fifteen minutes, that\
    \ the dimwit would make a splendid and devoted helpmeet. He tied a tethering rope\
    \ to his new employee and pulled him gently back to the hut.\nAfter a cup of tea\
    \ and a guided tour of the hut and another shifty fag break, the ornithologist\
    \ uttered the fateful words.\n\u201CHand me that chaffinch,\u201D he said, only\
    \ to be met with a look of staggeringly fathomless incomprehension. Shortly afterwards,\
    \ one of the servants from the manse appeared, having tracked down the dimwit\
    \ with bloodhounds. He found Bruno La Poubelle slumped in his chair with his head\
    \ in his hands, and the dimwit standing beside him, clutching a marsh warbler."
