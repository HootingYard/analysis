  text: 'Those of you who hold Gerard Manley Hopkins in awe--which I assume is every
    last one of you--should turn today to The Dabbler, where my sister Rita Byrne
    Tull explains how the great Victorian Jesuit priest was instrumental in setting
    the course of her life.


    This sketch of Father Hopkins was drawn by my son Edwood Burn. A finished version
    of it will appear in Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives, alongside a
    score of other portraits.'
