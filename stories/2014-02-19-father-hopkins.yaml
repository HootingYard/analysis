  text: "Those of you who hold Gerard Manley Hopkins in awe\u2014which I assume is\
    \ every last one of you\u2014should turn today to The Dabbler, where my sister\
    \ Rita Byrne Tull explains how the great Victorian Jesuit priest was instrumental\
    \ in setting the course of her life.\n\nThis sketch of Father Hopkins was drawn\
    \ by my son Edwood Burn. A finished version of it will appear in Mr Key's Shorter\
    \ Potted Brief, Brief Lives, alongside a score of other portraits."
