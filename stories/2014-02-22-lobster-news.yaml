  text: "Nappa Gisburn brought to my attention a television programme entitled Lobstermen\_\
    : Jeopardy At Sea, screened on something called the Quest Channel. I did not see\
    \ it, but then, as Mr Gisburn himself noted, it was probably less exciting than\
    \ its title promised.\nIt served to remind me, however, that some years ago I\
    \ encouraged readers to join the Adopt A Lobster scheme. Some of you in fact did\
    \ so, and have the certificates to prove it. What I find both worrying and perplexing\
    \ is that nobody seems ever to have received any news of their lobster. Much as\
    \ I would like to think that Babinsky and Bobnit Tivol and Tiny Enid are scuttling\
    \ happily across the ocean floor, snapping their claws at minnows, I just don't\
    \ know, and it's the not knowing that leads me to lie awake at night, thrashing\
    \ around on my pallet, biting my pillow, and generally making a sorry spectacle\
    \ of myself.\nReaders will recall that I undertook a special study of lobsters\
    \ and consider myself, if not an expert, than certainly as someone qualified to\
    \ embark on a worldwide lecture tour, all expenses paid. Should you, or anybody\
    \ you know, wish to invite me to some far-flung yet luxurious corner of the globe,\
    \ and to put me up in an exquisite hotel for a week, I will be happy to deliver\
    \ a five- or ten-minute unillustrated lecture on lobsters while waving my arms\
    \ about in a foolish, hysterical manner."
