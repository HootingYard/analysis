  text: "When I have finished writing my book of Brief, Brief Lives, I am going to\
    \ embark on a long-cherished project. This is Mr Key's Catalogue Of Everything\
    \ In The Known Universe, Arranged According To An Abstruse Taxonomic System Partly,\
    \ But Not Wholly, Related To The Standard Alphabet, Together With Fantastic And\
    \ Occasionally Hysterical Supplementary Passages Of Piercingly Acute Flimflam,\
    \ And Several Diagrams With Pointy Arrows, Wavy Lines, And Unseemly Smudges, The\
    \ Whole Printed In Tiny Type And With A Magnifying Glass Included For Ease Of\
    \ Perusal.\nThough I have not yet written a word of the text, I have made several\
    \ smudges, with soot on blotting paper, and while doing so have given much\u2014\
    well, no, not much\u2014thought to the abstruse taxonomic system. At the moment\
    \ I am minded to begin the book with geese, fireworks, and the Tet Offensive,\
    \ though that may change as I delve deeper into everything in the known universe.\n\
    Prospective publishers are not beating a path to my door. I suspect they are intimidated,\
    \ not so much by the sheer bulk of the book\u2014it will be hefty!, hefty!\u2014\
    but by the fact that nobody is ever going to need to read anything else, ever,\
    \ and book sales will slump accordingly.\nBut first I must crack on with the Lives..."
