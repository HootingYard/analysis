  text: 'When I have finished writing my book of Brief, Brief Lives, I am going to
    embark on a long-cherished project. This is Mr Key''s Catalogue Of Everything
    In The Known Universe, Arranged According To An Abstruse Taxonomic System Partly,
    But Not Wholly, Related To The Standard Alphabet, Together With Fantastic And
    Occasionally Hysterical Supplementary Passages Of Piercingly Acute Flimflam, And
    Several Diagrams With Pointy Arrows, Wavy Lines, And Unseemly Smudges, The Whole
    Printed In Tiny Type And With A Magnifying Glass Included For Ease Of Perusal.

    Though I have not yet written a word of the text, I have made several smudges,
    with soot on blotting paper, and while doing so have given much--well, no, not
    much--thought to the abstruse taxonomic system. At the moment I am minded to begin
    the book with geese, fireworks, and the Tet Offensive, though that may change
    as I delve deeper into everything in the known universe.

    Prospective publishers are not beating a path to my door. I suspect they are intimidated,
    not so much by the sheer bulk of the book--it will be hefty!, hefty!--but by the
    fact that nobody is ever going to need to read anything else, ever, and book sales
    will slump accordingly.

    But first I must crack on with the Lives...'
