text: Well, not the state of the nation, really, but the state of that godforsaken
  blot that is Mr Key's mental bailiwick. This weekend I have mostly been poking about
  in the flues of Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives, doing a final bit of
  dusting before I tie the manuscript to the leg of a postal pigeon and wave it away,
  into the blue beyond, to be deposited on the desk of my editor at Constable. With
  the book done, at last, I shall be able to return to full-time active service duty
  at Hooting Yard. Watch this space.
