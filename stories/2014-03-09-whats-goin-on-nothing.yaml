  text: "A Quaker once said to me \"I haven't had a single thought in my head for\
    \ about three months. It's wonderful!\" Give or take two and seven-eighths months,\
    \ that is pretty much the state of Mr Key's inner bonce. Since I finished the\
    \ bibliography and notes earlier in the week I have been lolloping around with\
    \ an utterly empty head. Hence the eerie silence here.\nThe only problem with\
    \ having an empty head is that sooner or later one begins to come over all John\
    \ Lennon circa 1967, and that will never do. So, following tomorrow's jaunt to\
    \ Bristol to recite sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose at An Event, I am going\
    \ to start cramming stuff into my head again, sloshing it about in the manner\
    \ of a sort of cranial tumble-drier, and decanting it here, for your edification\
    \ and instruction.\nHark! Hark! The dogs do bark.\n  There's two of them on Noah's\
    \ ark.\n  One is light, the other's dark.\n  But we decide which is right, and\
    \ which is an illusion....\n[Portentous music, with strings.]"
