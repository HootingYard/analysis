  text: "For a study of Binder's forty-nine symphonies, see here.\nBinder wrote two\
    \ piano concertos. The first, Piano Concerto In B Flat On A Theme Of Glinka, was\
    \ for many years, too many to count, thought to be based on a theme by the Russian\
    \ composer Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka (1804\u20131857). Scholars pored over his\
    \ scores, trying to find the theme which had inspired Binder, in vain.\nThe mystery\
    \ was solved when a researcher found a scribbled note in the margin of a newspaper\
    \ cutting at the bottom of a box of Binder's miscellaneous papers. The discovery,\
    \ incidentally, happened on the very day of a different discovery, when Pickles,\
    \ a black and white Collie, rooting about in a suburban hedge in Beulah Hill,\
    \ South Norwood, found the Jules Rimet trophy which had been stolen four months\
    \ before the start of the 1966 World Cup foopball tournament. Pickles\u2019 owner\
    \ received a financial reward; the only reward gained by the finder of the marginal\
    \ scribble was the undying gratitude of Binder enthusiasts.\nWhat the note revealed\
    \ was the true identity of Glinka. This was not the Russian composer, but an affectionate\
    \ nickname given to the landlady of the dilapidated seaside boarding house where\
    \ Binder lived during a particularly wretched decade. Glinka was rakishly thin\
    \ and angular and had a certain corvine air, and she whistled while she worked.\
    \ One of her whistlings enchanted the impecunious composer. He may even have intended\
    \ the tribute of a piano concerto to mollify Glinka and stop her bashing relentlessly\
    \ on his door every day demanding the rent, which Binder always had great difficulty\
    \ cobbling together. He was making a living at the time as a seaside resort piano\
    \ tuner, in a seaside resort with few pianos.\nGlinka's whistle must have been\
    \ something to hear. The Piano Concerto certainly is, though you will probably\
    \ want to wear ear-muffs. It's that kind of concerto.\nBinder's second piano concerto,\
    \ the Piano Concerto In B Flat On A Theme Of Glinka Again, is a very different\
    \ work. One critic, whose ears were pretty fantastic as critical ears go, said\
    \ that it was hard to believe it was the work of the same composer. Where the\
    \ first concerto is redolent of marshland and biscuits, the second has a sort\
    \ of guttersnipe snippiness. Where the first is piquant, the second chunters.\
    \ The theme itself is rendered by the sizzling of sausages in a frying pan, which\
    \ was possibly an allusion by the composer to Glinka's impossibly greasy breakfasts.\
    \ At the premi\xE8re of the work, in Pointy Town's pointy town hall, the overenthusiastic\
    \ sausage sizzler allowed spitting fat to set fire to the trousers of the brass\
    \ section, next to which he was stationed with his Calor Gaz picnic hob. The performance\
    \ ended in disarray and the insistent ringing of alarms and the arrival of fire\
    \ engines, elements which Binder planned to incorporate into a third piano concerto.\
    \ He never completed this work. Actually, he never even started it. He fell hopelessly\
    \ in love with the flapper Poopsie Clutterbuck who was allergic to pianos, and\
    \ who convinced Binder to concentrate on his symphonies, bagatelles, and threnodies.\n\
    Glinka's dilapidated seaside boarding house fell into further dilapidation. The\
    \ landlady sold it to a simple-minded fool, and retired to a different seaside\
    \ resort, further along the coast, where she was often to be seen tottering along\
    \ the pier, supported on sticks, her whistling drowned out by the ferocious shrieking\
    \ of gulls and gales."
