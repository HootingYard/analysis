  text: "\u201CThe Theobald case . . . is of importance because it demonstrates how\
    \ blind, unquestioning belief in the occult powers thought to be about them could\
    \ reduce the attitude of a private educated family of the England of the 1880's\
    \ towards their own lives to a condition where it becomes difficult to believe\
    \ that they were of sane mind. Morell Theobald was a well-known chartered accountant,\
    \ a member of the first Council of the Society for Psychical Research and its\
    \ first Hon. Treasurer. Over a period of some years the most extraordinary phenomena\
    \ were alleged to have occurred in Mr Theobald's house, in which the whole family\
    \ ultimately became involved. Dr Dingwall wrote:\nIn 1882 Mr Theobald had engaged\
    \ a new cook who turned out to be a very powerful physical medium. Since she found\
    \ it very difficult to get up in the morning and to get breakfast at 8 a.m. so\
    \ that Mr Theobald could catch his train, the spirits intervened. Fires were lit\
    \ in the kitchen: the table laid: kettles put on to boil: the tea made, and occasionally\
    \ the boiling water transported at a distance from one kettle to another. Hundreds\
    \ of spirit-writings were found on ceilings and walls and other astonishing phenomena\
    \ went on from year to year. Not only did the spirits help in the domestic work\
    \ of the house: they helped to move the baggage when the family was away: and\
    \ on one occasion the cook and Miss Theobald passed a bath, laden with various\
    \ objects, going down the stairs by itself just as they were going up.\n\u201C\
    Theobald described these wonders in a series of letters to the spiritualist magazine\
    \ Light in 1884, and in his book Spirit Workers in the Home Circle published in\
    \ 1887. Other incredible events included the unpacking of a picnic hamper by the\
    \ spirits, and the supernatural cooking of puddings for the Sunday evening meal\
    \ whilst the family were holding s\xE9ances. Whether the spirits assisted Theobald\
    \ in his auditing of the accounts of the S.P.R., a duty which he carried out for\
    \ ten years, I do not know.\u201D\nTrevor H. Hall, The Strange Case of Edmund\
