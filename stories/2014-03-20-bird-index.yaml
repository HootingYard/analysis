  text: Keen Hooting Yardist Ruthie Bosch drew to my attention the Stith Thompson
    Motif Index of Folk Literature, or more precisely the index to that Index. That
    was a week ago, and I am still trying to reorient my brain to take account of
    its existence. The world has changed for me, irrevocably. To give some idea of
    what I am babbling on about, you lot should listen, immediately, with lugholes
    alert, to today's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air, in which I took the opportunity
    to read (most of) the Stith Thompson Index index for Bird.
