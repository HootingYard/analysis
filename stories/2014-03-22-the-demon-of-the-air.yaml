  text: "On 24 December 1892 \u2026 [George Albert] Smith announced in the Brighton\
    \ and Hove Herald that he had taken a lease of the St Ann's Well pleasure gardens\
    \ \u2026 By April 1893 Smith had been able to \u201Csupplement the many natural\
    \ attractions\u201D of St Ann's Well by the addition, among other things, of a\
    \ monkey house, a gypsy fortune teller, swings and see-saws for the children,\
    \ and by popular lectures and demonstrations by himself.\nIn May 1894 Smith announced\
    \ that St Ann's Well had become one of the most popular amusement resorts in Britain.\
    \ He claimed that \u201Cclose to 3,000 visitors\u201D had paid 3d. for admission\
    \ on Whit Monday. The attractions now included captive baboons, an exhibition\
    \ of dissolving views \u201Cby means of long-range limelight apparatus\u201D,\
    \ and juggling and trapeze artists.\nSmith's advertisements in the Brighton and\
    \ Hove Herald and the Brighton Gazette on 7 and 9 June 1894 announced a \u201C\
    BALLOON ASCENT AND THRILLING PARACHUTE DESCENT by Neil Campbell, Australia's \u2018\
    Demon of the Air\u2019\u201D, on the following Saturday, augmented by trapeze,\
    \ juggling, and balancing acts. \u201CThe Demon of the Sky\u201D, it was said,\
    \ \u201Cwill perform his wonderful leap from the sky from a height of one mile\
    \ by means of a parachute.\u201D We may perhaps think that a mile was an exaggeration.\
    \ However, in the event, Smith created more of a sensation with his \u201CDemon\
    \ of the Air\u201D than he could have anticipated. \u201CHalf of Brighton\u201D\
    , apparently, \u201Cwas wild with excitement\u201D, because during the ascent\
    \ of the hot-air balloon the Demon had been unable to free himself to make his\
    \ spectacular parachute descent. After drifting over the town the balloon, with\
    \ the Demon still attached, crashed into Brighton cemetery. The Demon, it was\
    \ stated, broke a tombstone by the force of his descent, but was miraculously\
    \ uninjured.\n[Let us leap forward sixty years\u2026]\nWhen the National Film\
    \ Theatre was opened on London's South Bank in 1957, the [British Film] Academy\
    \ invited the now ninety-three-year-old Smith as a guest. He was presented to\
    \ Princess Margaret, met Gina Lollobrigida and other stars of the film world,\
    \ and was given a picture of the theatre by Lord Hailsham.\nTrevor H. Hall, The\
    \ Strange Case of Edmund Gurney (Duckworth 1964)"
