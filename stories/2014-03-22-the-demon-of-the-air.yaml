  text: 'On 24 December 1892 ... [George Albert] Smith announced in the Brighton and
    Hove Herald that he had taken a lease of the St Ann''s Well pleasure gardens ...
    By April 1893 Smith had been able to "supplement the many natural attractions"
    of St Ann''s Well by the addition, among other things, of a monkey house, a gypsy
    fortune teller, swings and see-saws for the children, and by popular lectures
    and demonstrations by himself.

    In May 1894 Smith announced that St Ann''s Well had become one of the most popular
    amusement resorts in Britain. He claimed that "close to 3,000 visitors" had paid
    3d. for admission on Whit Monday. The attractions now included captive baboons,
    an exhibition of dissolving views "by means of long-range limelight apparatus",
    and juggling and trapeze artists.

    Smith''s advertisements in the Brighton and Hove Herald and the Brighton Gazette
    on 7 and 9 June 1894 announced a "BALLOON ASCENT AND THRILLING PARACHUTE DESCENT
    by Neil Campbell, Australia''s ''Demon of the Air''", on the following Saturday,
    augmented by trapeze, juggling, and balancing acts. "The Demon of the Sky", it
    was said, "will perform his wonderful leap from the sky from a height of one mile
    by means of a parachute." We may perhaps think that a mile was an exaggeration.
    However, in the event, Smith created more of a sensation with his "Demon of the
    Air" than he could have anticipated. "Half of Brighton", apparently, "was wild
    with excitement", because during the ascent of the hot-air balloon the Demon had
    been unable to free himself to make his spectacular parachute descent. After drifting
    over the town the balloon, with the Demon still attached, crashed into Brighton
    cemetery. The Demon, it was stated, broke a tombstone by the force of his descent,
    but was miraculously uninjured.

    [Let us leap forward sixty years...]

    When the National Film Theatre was opened on London''s South Bank in 1957, the
    [British Film] Academy invited the now ninety-three-year-old Smith as a guest.
    He was presented to Princess Margaret, met Gina Lollobrigida and other stars of
    the film world, and was given a picture of the theatre by Lord Hailsham.
