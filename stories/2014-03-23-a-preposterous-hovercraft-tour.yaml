  text: 'Jeremy Thorpe spent the early weeks of the [October 1974 general election]
    campaign on a preposterous hovercraft tour of English seaside resorts, providing
    broadcasters with plenty of pictures of himself "struggling ashore in bedraggled
    oilskins" while aides toiled miserably to restart his unreliable vehicle.
