  text: 'Reading about yet another teenage shooting murder in east London in yesterday''s
    paper, I could not help but burst into inappropriate laughter at the name of the
    victim. Her name, apparently, was Shereka Fab-Ann Marsh. "Shereka" is bad enough,
    eliding easily into "Shrieker", but "Fab-Ann"? What on earth were her parents
    thinking?

    I am not sure if it is possible for me to re-register the births of my own (now
    adult) sons, but I am tempted to rechristen them Fab-Sam and Fab-Ed. And while
    we are about it, could I become Fab-Frank? Or perhaps With-It-Mr-Key?

    Perhaps the tragic Miss Marsh''s parents were fans of Thunderbirds.'
