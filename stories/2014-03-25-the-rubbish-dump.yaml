  text: "Note well the co-ordinates of the rubbish dump. Lit lantern, hand-held, visibility\
    \ Stygian. Pebbles underfoot. Buck collar snug at the neck. Distant incomprehensible\
    \ keening. The mighty pyramids of Ancient Egypt. Satyrs cavort in the forest.\
    \ A galumphing peasant with a pail. The rubbish dump would appear to be not far\
    \ from the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Crows fly there, on the hour, timetabled.\
    \ Clack clack clack, rapid clacks. That kind of timetable. Rain on the pebbles.\
    \ An orphan choir sings a song.\nBob Crow, Bob Crow\n  Made out of dough\n  Eat\
    \ him up with salt and herring\nA biff in the chops from an unknown assailant.\
    \ Fleeing in the gutter. On All Hallows Eve, pictures of Jap girls in synthesis.\
    \ The seven wonders of another world. Resurrectionists scurry in the night. Spades\
    \ at the ready. Bob Crow, Bob Crow.\nSibelius was a terrible drunkard. A dog sniffing\
    \ a ditch. Frisky terrier, lumbering hound. Two dogs then. The Colossus of Rhodes.\
    \ Young marble giants. Wind in the rigging. A frump with a towel in a doorway,\
    \ like Harry Lime in postwar Vienna. Wheels within wheels. The windmills of someone\
    \ else's mind. Mind how you go, sir. There's room for one more inside.\nThere's\
    \ room for one more skip at the rubbish dump. Babylon or Chartres. Sing, sing,\
    \ in a cathedral choir. Nunc dimittis. And he had received an answer from the\
    \ Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the\
    \ Lord. Bob Sparrow, Bob Lark.\nRain in the gutters and filth on the stairs. I\
    \ hear the sound of mandolins. Now the orphans sing.\nBob Crow, Bob Lark, Bob\
    \ Bobolink\n  Call for another round of drinks\n  We are teetering on the brink\n\
    \  Let's fall into the abyss.\nVisibility nil, in the abyss. Can I get a witness?\
    \ Is there honey? Is there tea? No. You have drained your cup. You could not make\
    \ it up.\nA new ghost."
