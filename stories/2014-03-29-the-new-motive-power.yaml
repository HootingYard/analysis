  text: "The New Motive Power was constructed of copper, zinc and magnets, all carefully\
    \ machined, as well as a dining room table. At the end of nine months, Spear and\
    \ an unnamed woman, also referred to as \u201CMary of the New Dispensation\u201D\
    \ ritualistically birthed the contraption in an attempt to give it life. Unfortunately\
    \ for Spear, this failed to have the desired effect, and the machine was later\
    \ dismantled.\nThe sort of paragraph that compels me to do further research. From\
    \ John Murray Spear & The Electric Messiah in today's Dabbler."
