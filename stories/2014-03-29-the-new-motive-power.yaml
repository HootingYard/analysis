  text: 'The New Motive Power was constructed of copper, zinc and magnets, all carefully
    machined, as well as a dining room table. At the end of nine months, Spear and
    an unnamed woman, also referred to as "Mary of the New Dispensation" ritualistically
    birthed the contraption in an attempt to give it life. Unfortunately for Spear,
    this failed to have the desired effect, and the machine was later dismantled.

    The sort of paragraph that compels me to do further research. From John Murray
    Spear & The Electric Messiah in today''s Dabbler.'
