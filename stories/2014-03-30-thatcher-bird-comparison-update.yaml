  text: "When Margaret Thatcher died last year, I devoted one of my potsages [sic]\
    \ for The Dabbler to the unresolved question of which bird she most closely resembled.\
    \ I noted that Matthew Parris claimed \u201Cshe walked like a partridge\u201D\
    , while Jon Snow asserted \u201Cshe scuttled about like a hen\u201D. Now things\
    \ have become more complicated. Reading Dominic Sandbrook's Seasons In The Sun\_\
    : The Battle For Britain 1974\u20131979, I learn that the Daily Express compared\
    \ the then-future Prime Minister to \u201Can angry woodpecker\u201D."
