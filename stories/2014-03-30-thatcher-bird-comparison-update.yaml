  text: 'When Margaret Thatcher died last year, I devoted one of my potsages [sic]
    for The Dabbler to the unresolved question of which bird she most closely resembled.
    I noted that Matthew Parris claimed "she walked like a partridge", while Jon Snow
    asserted "she scuttled about like a hen". Now things have become more complicated.
    Reading Dominic Sandbrook''s Seasons In The Sun : The Battle For Britain 1974-1979,
    I learn that the Daily Express compared the then-future Prime Minister to "an
    angry woodpecker".'
