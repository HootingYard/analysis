  text: 'It was one of those Octobers of relentless thudding and hammering, when the
    throwback was on the throne. The throneback, some called him, behind his back,
    but of course nobody had ever seen the back of the throne, not even the carpenter
    who made it, who was blind. As soon as it was finished, the throne was installed,
    its back rammed fast against the chamber wall, and there it had remained. When
    renovations and redecoration were undertaken, the work had to be arranged in such
    a way that the throne itself was never moved. And sat on it now, this October,
    with his oxygenator and his paper bag of salt water taffy, was the throwback king.

    The drains were blocked. There were a couple of chickens roasting on a spit. A
    peasant was being tortured in an alcove. And still, the constant din of thudding
    and hammering, drowning out the squeaking of bats, countless bats, up in the rafters.

    We know the bats were countless because the king had tried to have them counted.
    It was one of his first acts, after taking his place upon the throne. First he
    called for his oxygenator, then for his taffy, and then he summoned a calculator
    pursuivant and told him to count the bats. He was a bat-minded king, he liked
    to say. His uncle had advised him to speak very rarely. The fewer words he pronounced,
    said this uncle, the greater the force he would lend them. But the throwback king
    took no notice of this sage counsel, and he babbled, and had his uncle tortured
    in the alcove, like the peasant.

    There was a staircase leading from the chamber, obviously, at the foot of which
    was a brick-kiln, Each brick baked here was stamped with an image of the king''s
    heraldic beast, a fish with the head of an owl, the thorax and abdomen of a snapping
    beetle, and the trailing appendages of a jellyfish. It was called Desmond. The
    king''s greatest amusement, chewing taffy apart, was to watch his weediest fool
    try to juggle hot bricks while standing in a puddle.

    Milk played an important part in the life of the court that October. The throwback
    king, with his faux-Flemish affectations, pronounced it melk. He said coo instead
    of cow. Over and over again, he liked to watch the scene from Alfred Hitchcock''s
    Suspicion (1941) where Cary Grant carries a glass of milk upstairs to Joan Fontaine.
    Hitchcock placed a small light in the glass to make the milk glow. The king made
    his cows glow, by training Klieg lights upon their byre,

    It was only a short walk from the chamber to the cow byre, but one the king never
    made, for he was stuck to his throne. As with his forebears, so with the throwback.
    Once settled upon the throne, its seat coated with powerful adhesive gum, he would
    never rise from it again. Would he live beyond October? Towards the end of the
    month the thuddings and hammerings grew ever more clamorous. The king''s oxygenator
    gave out, the salt water taffy was as dust in his mouth. His minions circled,
    their faces expressionless, unreadable.

    Come Hallowe''en, when they prodded the king with a stick, he did not cry out.'
