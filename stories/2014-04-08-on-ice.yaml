  text: 'I learned today that the spooky Scandinavian vampire novel Let The Right
    One In, first adapted--very successfully--for the screen, has now been turned
    into a theatrical production. But not just any old production. No, this is Let
    The Right One In--On Ice!

    Perhaps it is just me whose brain turns to putty when I hear those dread words--On
    Ice!--appended to a title. I can think of few less edifying experiences than watching
    a drama--any drama--given the skating-rink treatment.

    But audiences do seem to lap them up, so it strikes me that it might be financially
    profitable to turn my hand to such an adaptation. What would be even more unlikely
    than a moody vampire yarn? My initial thoughts turn to The Anatomy Of Melancholy
    On Ice!, or The Strange Death Of Liberal England On Ice! But I am drawn irresistibly
    to the titanic challenge that would be Christopher Smart''s Jubilate Agno On Ice!

    First I must contact Andrew Lloyd Webber to do the music. If he insists on roller
    skates rather than ice skates, I might be open to persuasion.'
