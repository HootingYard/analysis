  text: "I learned today that the spooky Scandinavian vampire novel Let The Right\
    \ One In, first adapted\u2014very successfully\u2014for the screen, has now been\
    \ turned into a theatrical production. But not just any old production. No, this\
    \ is Let The Right One In\u2014On Ice!\nPerhaps it is just me whose brain turns\
    \ to putty when I hear those dread words\u2014On Ice!\u2014appended to a title.\
    \ I can think of few less edifying experiences than watching a drama\u2014any\
    \ drama\u2014given the skating-rink treatment.\nBut audiences do seem to lap them\
    \ up, so it strikes me that it might be financially profitable to turn my hand\
    \ to such an adaptation. What would be even more unlikely than a moody vampire\
    \ yarn? My initial thoughts turn to The Anatomy Of Melancholy On Ice!, or The\
    \ Strange Death Of Liberal England On Ice! But I am drawn irresistibly to the\
    \ titanic challenge that would be Christopher Smart's Jubilate Agno On Ice!\n\
    First I must contact Andrew Lloyd Webber to do the music. If he insists on roller\
    \ skates rather than ice skates, I might be open to persuasion."
