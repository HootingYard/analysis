    Chapter Three of Mr Key''s Book Of Birds, a work in progress.

    The corncrake is a type of bird. Its call is raucous and alarming. To gain an
    idea of how raucous, how alarming, imagine you are fast asleep in bed. Because
    you are obsessed with the rigours of polar exploration, you sleep, like Roald
    Amundsen, with your bedroom window wide open in all seasons of the year. Through
    this open window flies a corncrake, and it comes into land upon your head. Ordinarily,
    the sensation of its talons digging into your bouffant to steady its perching
    would awaken you. But you are wearing your thickly-woven woolly swaddling sleep
    helmet, as recommended by Von Straubenzee. Having suffered from debilitating insomnia
    for many years, you studied Von Straubenzee''s exciting new discipline of snoozetics.
    Now, before retiring, you drink a pint of lukewarm milk of magnesia, picture yourself
    tossing the contents of your brain into a wooden crate and hammering shut the
    lid of the crate with ten thousand nails, the same number of nails Cornelius Cardew
    thought sufficient to seal the coffin of imperialism, and you don the sleep helmet
    before hopping--never climbing, but hopping--into bed. You have found that ever
    since following Von Straubenzee''s procedures religiously, your sleep is deep
    and untroubled and not unlike a coma. Thus when the corncrake alights upon your
    head, and digs its talons into the thick wool of your sleep helmet to steady itself
    in its perching, you do not feel a thing. You remain fast asleep, content and
    snug in la-la land.

    From its perch, the corncrake surveys its surroundings. If you asked it why it
    had flown in through the window, and if it was somehow capable of responding in
    an approximation of human speech so that you understood its reply, it is likely
    that the corncrake would have absolutely no idea what impelled it. Who knows why
    birds do what they do? Not even the birds themselves know, for their brains are
    tiny. Rather than using reason, birds follow the dictates of instinct, what you
    or I would call "gut feelings". All we are able to say is that, on this occasion,
    the corncrake saw the open window and took the opportunity to fly into your bedroom,
    probably in the hope of finding something to eat. Fortunately, densely-woven wool
    does not feature as part of a corncrake''s regular diet.

    So while the bird rests from the exertions of its flight, perched on your head,
    it trains its two black fathomless savage inhuman eyes upon your bedroom. It takes
    in the frieze of martyred saints above the dado rail, the wainscot, the wardrobe,
    the chest of drawers, the rug and the unseemly stains. It takes in the clutter
    atop the bedside cabinet, the glass of water, the folded spectacles, the scrunched
    tissue, the anglepoise lamp, the stray button, the biro, the pins, the bowl, the
    dust, the cardboard carton of pills, the alarm clock, the other button, the little
    jars, the littler bottles, the nameless thingummy, the biscuit crumbs, the snuffbox,
    the coinage, the pipe-cleaners, the mud idol, the cotton wool, the toffee apple
    wrapper, the handkerchief, the string, the puppet, the putty, the duster, the
    rag, the bus ticket, the scrap of paper, the pocket Bible, the rosary beads, the
    taffy tin, the bonbon, the monkey snapshot in its frame, the atomiser, the shopping
    list, the rubber band, the drawing pin, the plaster Madonna and Child statuette,
    the sophisticated cocktail party invitation, the chewing gum, the gloves, the
    telephone. Were it a magpie or a jackdaw, rather than a corncrake, it might swoop
    and snatch up in its beak one of the smaller items on the top of the cabinet and
    fly out through the window and away, to deposit the stolen gewgaw in its nest.
    In folk tales and legends, magpies and jackdaws often appear as thieves, the bird
    equivalents of opportunistic pickpockets, and this characterisation has some basis
    in brute avian fact. Not so the corncrake, which is not thought of as a pillaging
    bird. So while it gazes upon the clutter, it remains still, perched upon your
    sleeping head, and swoops not to snatch booty in its beak.

    Stille Nacht. It would be hard to imagine a night more still, more silent than
    this one. The Von Straubenzee method ensures you make no stentorian snoring noise.
    The sound of your breathing is almost imperceptible, muffled by the sleep helmet.
    The corncrake''s breathing is equally quiet. Nothing stirs in your bedroom, and
    from outside, through the open window, there is not even a breath of wind. It
    is as if the planet has fallen asleep with you.

    I have said that we can have no idea what prompts a bird to do what it does. So
    I can offer no logical, reasoned explanation for the sudden loud jarring raucous
    cry of the corncrake on your head. It makes its harsh caw twice, then lifts off,
    and flies away out of the window. The effect on you is instantaneous and awful.
    You waken, alarmed, indeed panic-stricken, as if prodded with a burning hot pointy
    stick. You do not see the corncrake fly away, so you cannot account for the horror
    by which you are convulsed. Trembling, you clamber out of bed and shuffle to your
    toilet to piddle, a piddle occasioned by fear. Such is the raucous and alarming
    call of the corncrake.'
