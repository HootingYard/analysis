  text: "Roger Lewis, in his Spectator review of a new biography of Charlie Chaplin\
    \ by Peter Ackroyd, notes:\nChaplin died on Christmas Day 1977. Ackroyd doesn't\
    \ mention this, but the comedian's coffin was stolen by grave robbers, who phoned\
    \ Paulette Goddard, one of his wives and the co-star of The Gold Rush, hoping\
    \ they could make a ransom demand. \u201CWe've got Chaplin,\u201D they announced.\
    \ \u201CSo what?\u201D she said, slamming down the phone."
