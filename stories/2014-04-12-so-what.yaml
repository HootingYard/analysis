  text: 'Roger Lewis, in his Spectator review of a new biography of Charlie Chaplin
    by Peter Ackroyd, notes:

    Chaplin died on Christmas Day 1977. Ackroyd doesn''t mention this, but the comedian''s
    coffin was stolen by grave robbers, who phoned Paulette Goddard, one of his wives
    and the co-star of The Gold Rush, hoping they could make a ransom demand. "We''ve
    got Chaplin," they announced. "So what?" she said, slamming down the phone.'
