  text: 'In 1653, the dying Backhouse had whispered to Ashmole, syllable by syllable,
    the true and innermost secret of the Philosopher''s Stone ; this would have been
    a more impressive event, if Backhouse had not come to life again for nine more
    years, and if Ashmole had not meanwhile forgotten the formula.
