  text: "In his scholarly introduction to By Aerostat To Hooting Yard, Roland Clare\
    \ writes: \u201CThe Bad Vicarage is a very funny piece that epitomises not only\
    \ the moral instability of Hooting Yard but also Key's desire to puncture the\
    \ very illusion of reality that naturalistic authors are at pains to sustain.\
    \ Even if the rest of the story were sensible\u2014rest assured, it is not\u2014\
    there is no easy way we can come to terms with the unreliability of a narrator\
    \ who first wonders what has become of the \u2018Bad Vicar\u2019, then reveals\
    \ himself to be the incumbent in question.\u201D\nThe estimable Walt O'Hara of\
    \ Airy Persiflage says: \u201CNot for the faint of heart, Mr. Key's spine tingling\
    \ tale of a monstrous vicar of old and the evil that he wrought!\u201D You can\
    \ enjoy the pleasurably disconcerting experience of listening to the tale read\
    \ by Mr O'Hara here."
