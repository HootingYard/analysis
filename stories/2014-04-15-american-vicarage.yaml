  text: 'In his scholarly introduction to By Aerostat To Hooting Yard, Roland Clare
    writes: "The Bad Vicarage is a very funny piece that epitomises not only the moral
    instability of Hooting Yard but also Key''s desire to puncture the very illusion
    of reality that naturalistic authors are at pains to sustain. Even if the rest
    of the story were sensible--rest assured, it is not--there is no easy way we can
    come to terms with the unreliability of a narrator who first wonders what has
    become of the ''Bad Vicar'', then reveals himself to be the incumbent in question."

    The estimable Walt O''Hara of Airy Persiflage says: "Not for the faint of heart,
    Mr. Key''s spine tingling tale of a monstrous vicar of old and the evil that he
    wrought!" You can enjoy the pleasurably disconcerting experience of listening
    to the tale read by Mr O''Hara here.'
