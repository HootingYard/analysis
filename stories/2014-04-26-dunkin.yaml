  text: 'It is rare for me to feel imbued with the entrepreneurial spirit, but that
    is what happened this morning. I had a bright idea and envisioned myself as the
    onlie begetter of a vast multinational chain of snackbar franchises. All I need
    do now is draw up a business plan and make an appointment to see a friendly bank
    manager, who will be awed by my business nous and give me a start-up loan.

    For some reason I was mulling over the success of Dunkin'' Donuts--a success to
    which I have not myself contributed, never having entered one of these establishments.
    It suddenly occurred to me that a more civilised, more seemly version would be
    Dunkin'' Rich Tea Biscuits. Customers would enter, sit down, and order a cup of
    tea and one, or perhaps two, of these plain and virtually flavourless biscuits.
    Who could resist?
