  text: 'The marital life of the Grahames became uncosier by the year. "Elspeth seldom
    got up before eleven, often went to bed in her clothes ... Much of the time she
    spent on her divan, sipping hot water. She ate practically nothing and mouse-nests
    proliferated in the larder ; she put Kenneth into special underwear which was
    only changed once a year. It is perhaps not surprising that he took a long solitary
    walk every day."

    John Sutherland, The Lives Of The Novelists (Profile Books, 2011), quoting from
    (I think) a 1959 biography of Kenneth Grahame by Peter Green.'
