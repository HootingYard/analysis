  \ on AS, or Artificial Stupidity.\nI can imagine a big lumbering clanking robot\
  \ which, when hidden behind a screen, would engage in a \u201Cconversation\u201D\
  \ which experts would be hard put to tell from the barbaric grunting of the average\
  \ person in the street\u2014at least the streets around where I live.\n"
