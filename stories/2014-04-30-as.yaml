  text: 'There was a story in the paper the other day about a new breakthrough in
    the development of AI, or Artificial Intelligence. My own view is that if boffins
    want to create a machine that convincingly apes a human being, they ought to concentrate
    on AS, or Artificial Stupidity.

    I can imagine a big lumbering clanking robot which, when hidden behind a screen,
    would engage in a "conversation" which experts would be hard put to tell from
    the barbaric grunting of the average person in the street--at least the streets
    around where I live.
