  text: 'Last night I dreamed of Sir Maurice Bowra (1898--1971). When I awoke, this
    morning, I had to look him up to find out who he was. When I went to sleep last
    night, his was a name I knew, that I had come across here and there over the years,
    but I could not have said I knew anything about him.

    I learn, today, among other things, that he wrote : "I expect to pass through
    this world but once and therefore if there is anybody that I want to kick in the
    crutch I had better kick them in the crutch now, for I do not expect to pass this
    way again."

    In my dream Bowra was hanging about on the street wit a man named Henderson and
    a third party whose name was not divulged. Bowra had lank sandy hair and looked
    not unlike the actor David Warner. But in reality, he was "built like a sandbag,
    ... short and square with no neck and possessed a huge bittern booming voice".
    This is what he really looked like.
