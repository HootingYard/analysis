  text: "Last night I dreamed of Sir Maurice Bowra (1898\u20141971). When I awoke,\
    \ this morning, I had to look him up to find out who he was. When I went to sleep\
    \ last night, his was a name I knew, that I had come across here and there over\
    \ the years, but I could not have said I knew anything about him.\nI learn, today,\
    \ among other things, that he wrote\_: \u201CI expect to pass through this world\
    \ but once and therefore if there is anybody that I want to kick in the crutch\
    \ I had better kick them in the crutch now, for I do not expect to pass this way\
    \ again.\u201D\nIn my dream Bowra was hanging about on the street wit a man named\
    \ Henderson and a third party whose name was not divulged. Bowra had lank sandy\
    \ hair and looked not unlike the actor David Warner. But in reality, he was \u201C\
    built like a sandbag, \u2026 short and square with no neck and possessed a huge\
    \ bittern booming voice\u201D. This is what he really looked like.\n"
