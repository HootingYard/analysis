  text: 'The recent death of Gabriel Garcia Marquez reminded me of the circumstances
    that led me to read One Hundred Years Of Solitude, thirty-odd years ago--so long
    ago that, with my puny memory, I have forgotten the book entirely.

    I was at university at the time. I had a friend, a fellow student, Stephen, who
    lived in a house bought for him by his wealthy parents, and I rented a room in
    it one summer. Stephen, being a good leftie, was somewhat ashamed of his economic
    privilege and always referred to the "landlord", without divulging that this was
    his father.

    One day he found me reading a J. P. Donleavy novel, I can''t recall which one,
    and hectored me for wasting my time on trash. I should read, he said, only great
    works of literature, such as, to pluck a title at random, One Hundred Years Of
    Solitude. I was touched that he had my intellectual improvement at heart and,
    shortly afterwards, I did indeed read Marquez''s novel. I have to admit that,
    all these years later, I have fonder memories of Donleavy.

    Stephen and I lost touch after university, but it has always amused me that this
    keen upholder of cultural standards went on to become the television producer
    who created such intellectually stimulating fare as Wife Swap. Stephen Lambert--for
    it is he--may have cared deeply that I did not waste my time on trash, but it
    seems not to have bothered him that he besmirched the cultural life of the entire
    nation.'
