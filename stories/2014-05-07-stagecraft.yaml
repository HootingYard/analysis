  text: 'You lot do not visit Hooting Yard for news of the latest doings in the world
    of pop culture, but this, I think, is worth noting:

    The ballads are seldom the high point of a huge pop show, but in [Miley] Cyrus''s
    case, a degree of interest is added by the fact that she sings one of them while
    being pursued around the stage, for reasons that aren''t entirely clear, by a
    giant fluorescent orange fluffy bird.

    Alexis Petridis in The Guardian.'
