  text: "Another item that appeared on Hooting Yard ten years ago today was this:\n\
    Colossal, crude, terrible and sublime, Brann opened the ears of the people by\
    \ the mighty power of his untamed language, by the smashing fury of his wrath\
    \ of words\u2026 Waste, futile and planless, mere howling, empty, chaotic waste,\
    \ for no purpose under heaven but to serve as food for idle fancies as to what\
    \ might have been\u2014such to me is the death of Brann, and my throat chokes\
    \ with sorrow and my soul is sick with vain despair.\nThat is a quotation from\
    \ Milo Hastings\u2019 preface to Brann The Iconoclast, a collection of pieces\
    \ by William Cowper Brann (1855\u20141898). You can read the whole thing here,\
    \ or you might prefer, as I do, to repair to a deserted windswept promontory and\
    \ shout those colossal, crude, terrible and sublime words at the sky, and watch\
    \ birds drop down dead.\n"
