  text: 'Another item that appeared on Hooting Yard ten years ago today was this:

    Colossal, crude, terrible and sublime, Brann opened the ears of the people by
    the mighty power of his untamed language, by the smashing fury of his wrath of
    words... Waste, futile and planless, mere howling, empty, chaotic waste, for no
    purpose under heaven but to serve as food for idle fancies as to what might have
    been--such to me is the death of Brann, and my throat chokes with sorrow and my
    soul is sick with vain despair.

    That is a quotation from Milo Hastings'' preface to Brann The Iconoclast, a collection
    of pieces by William Cowper Brann (1855--1898). You can read the whole thing here,
    or you might prefer, as I do, to repair to a deserted windswept promontory and
    shout those colossal, crude, terrible and sublime words at the sky, and watch
    birds drop down dead.
