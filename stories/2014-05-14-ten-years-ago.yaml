  text: "On this day, exactly ten years ago, on 14 May 2004, I posted this on Hooting\
    \ Yard:\nBASHFUL COCTLOSH TRAUMA SURGEON\nBeing the title of a novel by Maisie\
    \ Pew, due to be published in September. It is a book of ten chapters, their titles\
    \ being:\nI. The Gelignite Zombie Person From Didcot\nII. Pudding Time\nIII. Paste,\
    \ Then Gruel\nIV. Our Hero, Dr Slab, Goes Haywire\nV. Being A Chapter In Which\
    \ Lovecraftian Shudders Are Experienced By A Barnyard Person And A Ferocious Bat-Being\n\
    VI. Tord Grip\nVII. The Other Gelignite Zombie Person From Didcot\nVIII. That\
    \ Sinuous L'Oreal Toss Of The Hair Performed By A Pirate Gang\nIX. Shoes? Boots?\
    \ String?\nXII. Mild Peril Fop Dilemma\nLong-term readers, and those with their\
    \ wits about them, will know that, contrary to my claim, no such book was ever\
    \ published. This is because (a) I made it up, and (b) \u201CMaisie Pew\u201D\
    \ did not then, and does not now, exist. I made her up too. Of course, I could\
    \ have written Bashful Coctlosh Trauma Surgeon myself, and I may even have planned\
    \ to, but I never did. I still could. I rather fancy it would be a pulpy potboiler.\
    \ If I followed the practice of certain eminent pulp writers, I might be able\
    \ to bash it out in a week or so. The thing to do would be to start typing and\
    \ not fret too much about felicities of style and wotnot.\nIncidentally, for those\
    \ who care about such matters, \u201CCoctlosh\u201D was a sort of proto-Hooting\
    \ Yard, or proto-Pointy Town. It was a fictional location which was the setting\
    \ for a few stories I wrote as long ago as the late 1970s, each of which featured\
    \ Josef Bong. Mr Bong was stolen from The Good Soldier \u0160vejk by Jaroslav\
    \ Ha\u0161ek, where he is mentioned, just once, in passing, in\u2014I recall\u2014\
    a newspaper cutting, where he is described as a \u201CBrave Driver\u201D (of a\
    \ train). My Josef Bong rode a horse, mounted upon which he arrived in Coctlosh\
    \ in the first of the stories, on a blistering hot day. I do not remember much\
    \ else about these ancient texts, which are\u2014alas\u2014lost. Burned, I think,\
    \ in a frenzy, long ago."
