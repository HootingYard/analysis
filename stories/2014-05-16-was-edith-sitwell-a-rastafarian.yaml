  text: "In 1927 Sylvia Townsend Warner attended a party at Edith Sitwell's house.\
    \ She did not enjoy it. \u201CThe room [was] full of young male poets and old\
    \ female rastas\u201D, she noted. I suppose rasta must have had a different meaning\
    \ for Sylvia, and she was not surrounded by elderly female rastafarians, though\
    \ I prefer to think this is what she did mean. The vision of Sylvia Townsend Warner,\
    \ Edith Sitwell, and several aged dreadlocked rastafarian women calling on Jah\
    \ to deliver them from their sufferation in Babylon is too splendid to be scuppered\
    \ by foolish matters such as historical truth.\n"
