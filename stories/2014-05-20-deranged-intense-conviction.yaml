  text: 'James Delingpole in The Spectator suggests why Game Of Thrones is so unutterably
    fabulous:

    I think the bottom line is if your film or TV series is to become one of the truly
    greats then the key is to throw conventional wisdom out of the window and pursue
    your deranged idea with the intensity and conviction of Fitzcarraldo up the Amazon
    or General Giap at Dien Bien Phu. It can''t be done, they''ll say. And maybe they''re
    right. But oh, the satisfaction in proving them wrong.

    In my more light-headed moments I would like to think that Hooting Yard is precisely
    that kind of deranged idea pursued with intensity and conviction. Though, I must
    admit, not in recent days, when the Key Cranium seems like a vast and sleepy hollow.
    I shall try to channel the Lannisters. They know how to get things done.'
