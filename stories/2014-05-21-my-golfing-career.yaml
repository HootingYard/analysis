  text: "In correspondence with one of my correspondents the other day, the subject\
    \ of golf was raised. (There was a Herman Melville connection, with which I will\
    \ not tax you.) This led me to recall a childhood memory, and I fired off an email\
    \ as follows:\nThe only time in my life I ever played a round of golf was when\
    \ I was eight years old. I was with a friend and his Scottish grandfather. My\
    \ abiding memory of the adventure is that the grandfather whacked me on the elbow\u2014\
    hard\u2014with his golf club. He insisted it was an accident. Hmm.\nTo which my\
    \ correspondent replied:\nThanks for that piece of information\u2014I am wondering\
    \ whether the disclosure of the grandfather's nationality is a mere embellishment,\
    \ or actually a key detail of the tale.\nWithout giving the matter much, or indeed\
    \ any, thought, I replied immediately to say that I thought the detail highly\
    \ significant. I have never played golf again."
