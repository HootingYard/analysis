  text: 'In correspondence with one of my correspondents the other day, the subject
    of golf was raised. (There was a Herman Melville connection, with which I will
    not tax you.) This led me to recall a childhood memory, and I fired off an email
    as follows:

    The only time in my life I ever played a round of golf was when I was eight years
    old. I was with a friend and his Scottish grandfather. My abiding memory of the
    adventure is that the grandfather whacked me on the elbow--hard--with his golf
    club. He insisted it was an accident. Hmm.

    To which my correspondent replied:

    Thanks for that piece of information--I am wondering whether the disclosure of
    the grandfather''s nationality is a mere embellishment, or actually a key detail
    of the tale.

    Without giving the matter much, or indeed any, thought, I replied immediately
    to say that I thought the detail highly significant. I have never played golf
    again.'
