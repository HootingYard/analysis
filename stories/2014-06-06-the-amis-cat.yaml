  text: "This is probably the most accurate observation of a cat in world literature:\n\
    Victor was a blue-point Siamese, a neutered tom-cat now in the third year of his\
    \ age. He entered, as usual, in vague semi-flight, as from something that was\
    \ probably not a menace, but which it was as well to be on the safe side about.\
    \ Becoming aware of me, he approached, again as usual, with an air of uncertainty\
    \ not so much about who I was as about what I was, and of keeping a very open\
    \ mind on the range of possible answers. Was I potassium nitrate, or next October\
    \ twelvemonth, or Christianity, or a chess problem\u2014perhaps involving a variation\
    \ on the Falkbeer counter-gambit? When he reached me, he gave up the problem and\
    \ toppled on to my feet like an elephant pierced by a bullet in some vital spot.\
    \ Victor was, among other things, the reason why no dogs were allowed at the Green\
    \ Man. The effort of categorizing them might have proved too much for him.\nfrom\
    \ The Green Man by Kingsley Amis (1969)"
