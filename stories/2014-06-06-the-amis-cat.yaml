  text: 'This is probably the most accurate observation of a cat in world literature:

    Victor was a blue-point Siamese, a neutered tom-cat now in the third year of his
    age. He entered, as usual, in vague semi-flight, as from something that was probably
    not a menace, but which it was as well to be on the safe side about. Becoming
    aware of me, he approached, again as usual, with an air of uncertainty not so
    much about who I was as about what I was, and of keeping a very open mind on the
    range of possible answers. Was I potassium nitrate, or next October twelvemonth,
    or Christianity, or a chess problem--perhaps involving a variation on the Falkbeer
    counter-gambit? When he reached me, he gave up the problem and toppled on to my
    feet like an elephant pierced by a bullet in some vital spot. Victor was, among
    other things, the reason why no dogs were allowed at the Green Man. The effort
    of categorizing them might have proved too much for him.

    from The Green Man by Kingsley Amis (1969)'
