  text: The importance of Scroggins lies in its custody. Not one cupboard, but two,
    are necessary, each fitted with a heavy padlock. The keys should differ from each
    other in minute yet decisive particulars and be kept secreted at the bottom of
    the garden, hanging from the branches of a pugton tree, disguised with tinsel
    or birdlime so that they appear to be organic growths upon the tree. The tree
    itself ought to be fenced off with railings, railings with spikes, spikes!, sharpened
    spikes. Only then can Scroggins be said to be held securely. If you wish to allow
    visiting times, make them at dead of night, in mist or fog, with full documentation.
    Have a dog, too, one that howls. Ignore the distant beating of drums. Drums are
    the playthings of toddlers.
