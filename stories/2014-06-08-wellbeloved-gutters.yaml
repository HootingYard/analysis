  text: "Meet me at midday at Wellbeloved Gutters, and we can swap dogs and consider\
    \ the drainage.\nDid I want to exchange Rags for Scamp? It did not seem as if\
    \ I had a choice in the matter. It was not that I had any affection for Rags,\
    \ he was flea-ridden and sick and dishevelled, but he was my Rags. Lord knows\
    \ I had little else to call my own, certainly nothing else living and wheezing.\n\
    I used to have my own cart, on wheels, but it toppled down a slope and fell to\
    \ bits at the bottom. I was distracted for a mere moment, by a bittern, or was\
    \ it a plover?, but a mere moment was enough for me to let go of the handle of\
    \ the cart and for its subsequent ruination. Then I was a man without a cart.\
    \ Shortly afterwards, I obtained Rags, by accident, outside a milk bar. The dog\
    \ attached itself to me. It followed me home, if you can call the wooden pallet\
    \ in the shelter of the viaduct home.\nI called it home, for a month or two, before\
    \ fate swept me up and plopped me in a hotel. Rags had to stay outside, on a patch\
    \ of ground near the car park. I fashioned a kennel for him out of bits of hardboard\
    \ and nails. The patch was in the lee of one of the hotel's huge forbidding windowless\
    \ back walls. I know nothing of architecture, but it struck me as an unusually\
    \ designed building. The innards were somewhere between palatial and gaudy. What\
    \ a trick fate played to plop me there!\nI tried to imagine Scamp\u2014big, bounding,\
    \ brisk, panting Scamp\u2014sitting half-in, half-out of the kennel, eating from\
    \ Rags's bowl, in the shadow of the hotel. I tried and failed. So I went down\
    \ to the lobby and asked for some notepaper and scribbled a reply.\nI will meet\
    \ you at midday at Wellbeloved Gutters. I am happy to consider the drainage. But\
    \ a dog-swap is out of the question, for the time being.\nI pressed a coin into\
    \ the mitt of an urchin and sent him off to deliver my message. Then I obtained\
    \ some bones and jelly and went out the back to feed Rags. His chain had been\
    \ smashed to pieces, as if by a maniac's axe. Untethered, Rags had fled. I returned\
    \ to the lobby, slumped in an armchair next to a palm tree, and bunched my fists.\n\
    Later, torrential rain fell on Wellbeloved Gutters. The rain drained away as rapidly\
    \ as it fell, for they are highly efficient gutters, probably the most efficient\
    \ gutters in Pointy Town."
