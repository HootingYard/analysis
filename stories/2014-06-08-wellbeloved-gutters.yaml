  text: 'Meet me at midday at Wellbeloved Gutters, and we can swap dogs and consider
    the drainage.

    Did I want to exchange Rags for Scamp? It did not seem as if I had a choice in
    the matter. It was not that I had any affection for Rags, he was flea-ridden and
    sick and dishevelled, but he was my Rags. Lord knows I had little else to call
    my own, certainly nothing else living and wheezing.

    I used to have my own cart, on wheels, but it toppled down a slope and fell to
    bits at the bottom. I was distracted for a mere moment, by a bittern, or was it
    a plover?, but a mere moment was enough for me to let go of the handle of the
    cart and for its subsequent ruination. Then I was a man without a cart. Shortly
    afterwards, I obtained Rags, by accident, outside a milk bar. The dog attached
    itself to me. It followed me home, if you can call the wooden pallet in the shelter
    of the viaduct home.

    I called it home, for a month or two, before fate swept me up and plopped me in
    a hotel. Rags had to stay outside, on a patch of ground near the car park. I fashioned
    a kennel for him out of bits of hardboard and nails. The patch was in the lee
    of one of the hotel''s huge forbidding windowless back walls. I know nothing of
    architecture, but it struck me as an unusually designed building. The innards
    were somewhere between palatial and gaudy. What a trick fate played to plop me
    there!

    I tried to imagine Scamp--big, bounding, brisk, panting Scamp--sitting half-in,
    half-out of the kennel, eating from Rags''s bowl, in the shadow of the hotel.
    I tried and failed. So I went down to the lobby and asked for some notepaper and
    scribbled a reply.

    I will meet you at midday at Wellbeloved Gutters. I am happy to consider the drainage.
    But a dog-swap is out of the question, for the time being.

    I pressed a coin into the mitt of an urchin and sent him off to deliver my message.
    Then I obtained some bones and jelly and went out the back to feed Rags. His chain
    had been smashed to pieces, as if by a maniac''s axe. Untethered, Rags had fled.
    I returned to the lobby, slumped in an armchair next to a palm tree, and bunched
    my fists.

    Later, torrential rain fell on Wellbeloved Gutters. The rain drained away as rapidly
    as it fell, for they are highly efficient gutters, probably the most efficient
    gutters in Pointy Town.'
