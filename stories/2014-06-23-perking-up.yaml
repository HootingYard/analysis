  text: 'It is rare for an entire fortnight to pass in complete silence here at Hooting
    Yard, but that is what has happened. It is a sorry state of affairs and I cannot
    blame it entirely on the aforementioned loss of my mojo. Clearly what is needed
    is for me to PERK UP. To this end, I have been working my way through a self-help
    regime entitled PERKING UP. I will not go into the details of what this consists
    of, as I do not want you lot to be overcome with waves of nausea, spiritual despair,
    and the withers. Suffice to say that I went to the nearest grocery kiosk and obtained
    a supply of plums, and on my way home I walked widdershins around the kirk several
    times. More than that I had best not say, for the time being.

    While my PERKING UP begins to take hold, there are a couple of small matters to
    bring to your attention. First is the dearth of memorable utterances thus far
    from the commentators at the foopball World Cup. I had hoped to bring you a torrent
    of inanities, but alas there is little to report. Perhaps worth noting was one
    pundit''s observation that "He''s a very talented foopballer--he knows where the
    goal is". But really the tournament has been something of a disappointed to date,
    with nothing to match such past gems as "For a moment there, he looked like a
    baby gazelle who''d just plopped out of the womb".

    Second, I am delighted to draw to your attention this newly-released podcast from
    Resonance104.4FM. Originally broadcast over two years ago, but none the worse
    for that.
