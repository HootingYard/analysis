  text: 'In correspondence received the other day, one of my readers described the
    eerie Hooting Yard silence as a "summer recess". This is a splendid way to think
    about what otherwise might be considered the alarming emptiness in my bonce. So
    a quasi-official summer recess it is, punctuated by the occasional brief spot
    of blather.

    Meanwhile, you can go and read about Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich & Wynken,
    Blynken & Nod in The Dabbler, and you can hear the great Norm Sherman reading
    A Weekend With An Owl God on the latest Drabblecast. As Norm says, if you don''t
    love Frank Key, you don''t know what love is ...'
