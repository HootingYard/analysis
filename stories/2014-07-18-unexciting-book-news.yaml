  text: 'Back in February I announced the forthcoming book Mr Key''s Shorter Potted
    Brief, Brief Lives. You lot have no doubt been panting with spittle-flecked anticipation
    ever since, impatiently awaiting the day when you can sashay into your nearest
    bookshop and buy dozens of copies for family, friends, and semiliterate hobbledehoys
    you encounter in the queue at the soup kitchen.

    Alas! What with one thing and another, unbeknown to me, Constable have decided
    to postpone publication until September 2015. To ensure that your Christmas is
    not thereby ruined, I will try my best to issue a brand new Lulu paperback for
    the festive season. Watch this space.'
