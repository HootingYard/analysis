  text: "My old man's a dustman. He wears a dustman's hat. Unless you are a dustman\
    \ yourself\u2014or a milliner\u2014you may be unfamiliar with the dustman's hat.\
    \ I am neither a dustman nor a milliner, but I am wearing my old man's hat as\
    \ I write, so I know exactly what I am talking about.\nJosef Vissarionovich Djugashvili,\
    \ the pockmarled, moustachioed Georgian, famously renamed himself Stalin, the\
    \ Man of Steel. At the height of the Solidarity protests in Poland in the early\
    \ 1980s, Lech Walesa was conflated with the Man of Iron of Andrej Wajda's film\
    \ of that title. Neither steel nor iron, my old man is a Man of Dust.\nI said\
    \ that he wears a dustman's hat, but then contradicted myself by saying that I\
    \ am wearing it. I ought to have said he wore a dustman's hat, before I stole\
    \ it from him and plopped it, at a decidedly non-rakish angle, on my own head.\
    \ Just as I stole from him his cardigan and his tobacco pouch and his Italian-made\
    \ and unexpectedly stylish Armando Del Foppo boots.\nI hasten to add that the\
    \ old man is not my father. I call him \u201Cmy\u201D old man because he is the\
    \ latest in a series of old men I have abducted off the streets and chained up\
    \ in my attic. I help myself to whatever they have about their person that takes\
    \ my fancy, be it hat, cardigan, pouch and boots or, say, wig, dentures, walking\
    \ stick and ear trumpet, and I commission Old Ma Popsicle to take up to them a\
    \ bowl of gruel or milk slops once a day. But being old, my old men invariably\
    \ die within a few days. I haul the corpses downstairs and into the garden and\
    \ bury them in the flowerbeds under the Pointy Town moonlight. Old Ma Popsicle\
    \ is sworn to silence. I know far too much about her past for her to blab to the\
    \ coppers."
