  text: 'Word of the day : Parp.

    Parp is a verb, pretty much identical to toot. Here is an illustrative sentence:
    In an apoplexy of rage, he parped his hooter. To act out this sentence, for example
    in a classroom full of tots, you will need a hooter. You should also smear your
    face with beetroot juice to give it that "purple with rage" look, and be able
    to boggle your eyes convincingly. Tomorrow we will consider the word Boggle.'
