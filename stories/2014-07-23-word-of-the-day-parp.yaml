  text: "Word of the day\_: Parp.\nParp is a verb, pretty much identical to toot.\
    \ Here is an illustrative sentence: In an apoplexy of rage, he parped his hooter.\
    \ To act out this sentence, for example in a classroom full of tots, you will\
    \ need a hooter. You should also smear your face with beetroot juice to give it\
    \ that \u201Cpurple with rage\u201D look, and be able to boggle your eyes convincingly.\
    \ Tomorrow we will consider the word Boggle."
