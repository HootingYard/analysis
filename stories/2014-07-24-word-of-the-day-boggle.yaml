  text: "Word of the day\_: Boggle.\nI am afraid that before we move on to boggle,\
    \ we have unfinished business with yesterday's word of the day, parp. Reader Wlad\
    \ Onanugu writes\_:\nDear Wordmaestro, I am confused by your maunderings on the\
    \ word parp. You say it is pretty much identical to toot, but then proceed, in\
    \ your illustrative sentence, to refer to a hooter, rather than, as I might have\
    \ expected, a tooter or parper. My mental chaos is compounded by the fact that\
    \ you also make mention of tots, virtually the same word as toots, though entirely\
    \ different in meaning. I looked forward to improving my word power with your\
    \ new series. Instead I find myself quite dreadfully unhinged.\nMr Onanugu will\
    \ find it helpful to consult Dobson's pamphlet Parp. Toot, Hooter, Tooters, Parpers\
    \ And Tots\_: A Complete Guide For The Bewildered (out of print). I have not read\
    \ it myself, but am told it is almost, but not quite, \u201Cthe greatest pamphlet\
    \ ever written\u201D."
