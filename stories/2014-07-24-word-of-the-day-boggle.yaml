    I am afraid that before we move on to boggle, we have unfinished business with
    yesterday''s word of the day, parp. Reader Wlad Onanugu writes :

    Dear Wordmaestro, I am confused by your maunderings on the word parp. You say
    it is pretty much identical to toot, but then proceed, in your illustrative sentence,
    to refer to a hooter, rather than, as I might have expected, a tooter or parper.
    My mental chaos is compounded by the fact that you also make mention of tots,
    virtually the same word as toots, though entirely different in meaning. I looked
    forward to improving my word power with your new series. Instead I find myself
    quite dreadfully unhinged.

    Mr Onanugu will find it helpful to consult Dobson''s pamphlet Parp. Toot, Hooter,
    Tooters, Parpers And Tots : A Complete Guide For The Bewildered (out of print).
    I have not read it myself, but am told it is almost, but not quite, "the greatest
    pamphlet ever written".'
