  text: 'I was intrigued by this snippet in the diary column of the Guardian. Yesterday,
    we were told, was

    the feast day of Christina the Astonishing, a 12th century Belgian saint who could
    fly and occasionally lived in holes, ovens, and ponds while preaching.

    Clearly I am going to have to do further research, and when I have, I will let
    you lot know what I have discovered.'
