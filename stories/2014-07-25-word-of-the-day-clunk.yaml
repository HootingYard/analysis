  text: 'Word of the day : Clunk.

    I had hoped, today, to deal with the word clunk, as well as catching up with yesterday''s
    word, boggle, which as you recall had to be postponed while I addressed further
    matters regarding parp. Alas, I am diverted from my proper course by another letter
    from Wlad Onanugu. This time he writes:

    Dear Mr Key, I was touched by your thoughtfulness in recommending to me further
    reading on the knotty problem of parp and toot and hooter and tots, et cetera.
    Indeed, I was so touched that I am afraid to say I let a few tears run down my
    cheeks. My weeping and snuffling soon ceased, however, when the significance of
    those parenthetical words "(out of print)" appended to the recommended title sank
    in. Sure enough, as I trudged around the bookselling kiosks of the dilapidated
    seaside resort where I live, I discovered that this Dobson pamphlet was completely
    unavailable. I was met with blank stares, looks of incredulity, a pitying pat
    on the head, and, by one particularly apoplectic bookseller, the threat of his
    slavering, sharp-fanged guard dog.

    Eventually, at a jumble sale at the local self-esteem ''n'' diversity awareness
    hub, my rummaging did unearth a pamphlet by Dobson. A glance at the Gestetnered
    cover, however, revealed that it was devoted to a wholly different topic. The
    title was Several Potentates Of The Ancient World With Collapsed Lungs & Their
    Concubines (out of print). I bought it anyway, for tuppence, and took it home
    hoping that perhaps the pamphleteer might have a passing word to say somewhere
    about the whole parp toot hooter tots business.

    Arriving home, I snapped open a refreshing can of Squelcho!, plopped myself down
    in my armchair, and began to read. Shortly thereafter, I was weeping again, but
    this time from brain-jangling frustration. The pamphlet seemed to me the most
    utter poppycock, and try as I might I could wring no sense from it whatsoever.
    If this is a typical example of Dobson''s work, I am feeling quite relieved that
    I did not continue my search for the pamphlet you recommended. Please send me
    a postal order for tuppence as compensation.

    I am sorry that Mr Onanugu found Dobson''s prose intractable. There is a possibility,
    however, that he may well have stumbled upon a copy of the notorious "rogue" edition
    of Several Potentates Of The Ancient World With Collapsed Lungs & Their Concubines.
    This was the one where the original text--a model of shining clarity and Dobsonian
    oomph--was translated into Hungarian, and from Hungarian into Tagalog, and from
    Tagalog into Dog Latin, before being translated back into English. It was the
    work of the mischievous literary prankster Hector Nuisance.

    Tomorrow I hope to crack on with boggle, and clunk, and tomorrow''s word of the
    day, glue.'
