  text: 'In my post yesterday on Christina the Astonishing, I said that I would be
    doing further research. In the Comments, Mary O''Grady helpfully led me to the
    entry on this orphaned Belgian peasant in Butler''s Lives Of The Saints, and I
    have also been consulting any number of Catholic websites. Those of you who do
    not have time to devote to such devotional devotion, and would prefer the simpler
    option of watching a brief video, are referred to Busted Halo ("an online magazine
    for spiritual seekers") where you can watch an episode of my new favourite show,
    Father Steve''s Spooky Saints. Dig that crazy Catholic animation, daddy-o!
