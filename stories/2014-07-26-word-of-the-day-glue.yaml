  text: 'Word of the day : Glue.

    Today I want to look at the word glue. I also want to take the opportunity to
    mop up the two earlier words of the day I have not yet had a chance to examine,
    boggle and clunk. Mop, incidentally, is a fine word in itself, so let us pencil
    that in for tomorrow. And while we are about it, let us pencil in pencil for the
    day after tomorrow.

    In the meantime, I have received yet another letter from Wlad Onanugu. I presume
    it is another bit of wittering about parp. I cannot say for sure, because--with
    iron in my soul--I have thus far made a titanic effort not to open it, and thus
    have not yet read it. Perhaps I never will. I might shove it, unopened, into my
    wastepaper basket, from whence it will be tipped along with all sorts of other
    papery detritus, into a great roaring furnace, when I have located such a furnace.

    I ought to make it clear that it is not my habit to treat all correspondence from
    readers so shamefully. Usually, I pore over your letters, rereading them a couple
    of times, until I have winkled from them every last drop of whatever it is they
    contain--wisdom, wit, top tips, a scattering of breadcrumbs--and then I chew the
    end of my pencil before scribbling a response. If you take the trouble to write,
    I ought to take the trouble to reply. So I have terrible misgivings about Mr Onanugu''s
    latest missive. But quite honestly, if I have to bang on about parp yet again,
    this series is never going to get anywhere.

    After I wrote that paragraph, my terrible misgivings got the better of me, and
    I decided after all to open, and read, Mr Onanugu''s letter. If it turned out
    to be all about parp again--and toot and hooter and tots--then so be it. I would
    frame a response which, I hoped, would dissuade my pesky correspondent from ever
    putting pencil to paper again for so long as he lived.

    As I reached across my desk for the letter, however, I knocked over an opened
    can of Squelcho!, from which I had taken only a single dainty glug, with the result
    that I ended up with a puddle of fizzy luminous highly-coloured chemically-enhanced
    liquid on the floor. I was not entirely sure how high its acidic content was,
    but I feared it might start eating through the floorboards, like the blood of
    the alien in Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979). So at once I fetched a mop to mop it
    up. See what a great word mop is? It is both a noun and a verb. One mops with
    a mop. And I won''t even begin to talk about Beatle-hair!

    Anyway, I was so exhausted after my mopping (with a mop!) that I had to go and
    take a nap. Which means that I will have to set aside boggle and clunk and glue
    for another day. On a more positive note, it could be argued that I have already
    composed an illustrative sentence for tomorrow''s word of the day, mop. Perhaps
    I can substitute nap for mop, tomorrow. Wait and see.'
