  text: 'Like the leaf clings to the tree, oh! my darling cling to me, for we are
    like creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind! Wild is the wind! Wild it is!
    As wild as the wind in The Wind starring Lillian Gish. This wild wind howls across
    the desolate tarputa, so you must cling to me, my darling, and I must cling to
    these railings, and our clingings, yours to me and mine to the railings, will
    prevent us being blown away, like specks of dust in the wild wind.

    I cling to the railings surrounding the huge cement hollyhock that is the only
    landmark for miles and miles across the desolate tarputa. It is the work of the
    noted cement hollyhockist Sidney Hock, though the railings are municipal. When
    unveiled, so many moons ago, it was painted, all green and pink and crimson, with
    emulsion, but the relentless wild wind has stripped it of its paint and now it
    is a bare cement hollyhock towering on the tarputa, a handy landmark where such
    as we can arrange our assignations. For we are like creatures of the wind.

    Sidney Hock placed other cement hollyhocks in other locations, but this one is
    his masterpiece. That is why it is protected by railings. They are stout and strong,
    the railings, the better to withstand the wild wind. I cling to them now, as you
    cling to me, as the wind roars. We cannot hear each other speak, but what use
    is speech?

    The cement hollyhockist was himself a mute, by dint of some unfathomable hysteric
    blot upon his brain. From the age of ten, after a picnic, not a word was heard
    from his mouth. He had a great feeling for the tarputa, for its desolation, for
    the wild wind that roars across it, flattening everything except the enormous
    cement hollyhock which looms above us as we cling. Here we can conduct our assignations
    safe from the prim and priggish villagers in their broad-brimmed hats and black
    frock-coats. We shall not skulk in alleyways and shadow. Out here on the tarputa,
    in the howling wind, we cling, me to the railings and you to me, like the leaf
    clings to the tree.'
