    Mop is the technical term for the stuff that grows on top of a Beatle, hence moptop,
    as in the illustrative phrase "four loveable moptops who conquered the world".
    There are other meanings of mop, both as noun and verb, but you know what?, I
    think I have already told you about them, out of turn, when I was meant to be
    telling you about the word glue, as well as boggle and clunk, none of which words
    I was able to give proper attention to because of a flurry of correspondence from
    pesky reader Wlad Onanugu. See previous Word Of The Day entries to relive the
    full horror.

    Speaking of Mr Onanugu, he has sent me yet another letter. It arrived while I
    was writing the above paragraph. Here is what he has to say for himself:

    Dear Mr Key : Why are you telling us about mop when you said you were going to
    tell us instead about nap? Also, if I am keeping proper track of things, were
    you not meant to be telling us about pencil? I have a few further questions for
    you regarding parp--as well as toot and hooter and tots--but I need to marshal
    my thoughts very carefully before putting pencil to cardboard torn from a packet
    of breakfast cereal.

    I confess myself utterly befuddled by Mr Onanugu''s ability to know what I am
    writing about before I have posted it here at Hooting Yard. The awful, terrifying
    thought occurs to me that he might be some sort of phantasmal being whose only
    existence is inside my skull, an emanation of the brain brought on by god knows
    what.

    At times like these it can be helpful to slosh out the ears by listening to a
    few Beatles hits. By the way, if you are not clear what a Beatle is, you will
    find several references to them elsewhere on Het Internet. One word of warning
    : if your source of Beatle lore is the pronouncements on the subject by the late
    Kenneth Williams, please note that "that Beatle who married an Asiatic woman"
    was not, as Williams has it, Ringo Starr.'
