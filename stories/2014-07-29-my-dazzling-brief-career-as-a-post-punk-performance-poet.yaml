  text: "The year is 1982, the scene is the Jacquard Club in Norwich. On the bill\
    \ for the evening's entertainment are Serious Drinking, a band composed of middle\
    \ class university graduates who do a reasonably convincing job of pretending\
    \ to be working class oiks. Their songs are mostly about beer and foopball. Their\
    \ EP Love On The Terraces is a collector's item these days. Also taking to the\
    \ stage is a post-punk performance poet. Incapable of memorising his verses, he\
    \ has them scribbled on pieces of paper which, as he finishes reading each one,\
    \ he scrunches up in his fist and chucks into the audience. Nobody knows\u2014\
    indeed nobody cares\u2014that this will be his one and only performance as a poet,\
    \ and he will not reappear on stage until the new century has dawned. He shouts\
    \ (among other things):\nI spent ten days in a shed\n  The shed was made of wood\n\
    \  I smoked a pack of Number 6\n  And drank a bottle of stout\n  I didn't eat\
    \ a fucking crumb\n  After a while my legs went numb\n  Then I went and had my\
    \ bath\n  Now I'm so clean it almost hurts\nThat youthful performer was Frank\
    \ Key The Poet. I am not sure what brought that memory flooding back.\nADDENDUM\_\
    : I recall only one other piece I shouted at the crowd that night, and only the\
    \ opening three lines come back to me:\nHe pushed a boy scout into a lake\n  Went\
    \ to a snackbar and stole some cake\n  He's a snackbar hooligan!\nAll the verses\
    \ followed the same pattern, a rhyming couplet followed by the one-line \u201C\
    chorus\u201D, after each bellowing of which I urged the audience to shout \u201C\
    Yeah!\u201D or \u201COi!\u201D, which I am pleased to say they did, with a certain\
    \ mocking enthusiasm."
