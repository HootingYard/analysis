  text: "The year is 1982, the scene is the Jacquard Club in Norwich. On the bill\
    \ for the evening's entertainment are Serious Drinking, a band composed of middle\
    \ class university graduates who do a reasonably convincing job of pretending\
    \ to be working class oiks. Their songs are mostly about beer and foopball. Their\
    \ EP Love On The Terraces is a collector's item these days. Also taking to the\
    \ stage is a post-punk performance poet. Incapable of memorising his verses, he\
    \ has them scribbled on pieces of paper which, as he finishes reading each one,\
    \ he scrunches up in his fist and chucks into the audience. Nobody knows--indeed\
    \ nobody cares--that this will be his one and only performance as a poet, and\
    \ he will not reappear on stage until the new century has dawned. He shouts (among\
    \ other things):\nI spent ten days in a shed\n  The shed was made of wood\n  I\
    \ smoked a pack of Number 6\n  And drank a bottle of stout\n  I didn't eat a fucking\
    \ crumb\n  After a while my legs went numb\n  Then I went and had my bath\n  Now\
    \ I'm so clean it almost hurts\nThat youthful performer was Frank Key The Poet.\
    \ I am not sure what brought that memory flooding back.\nADDENDUM : I recall only\
    \ one other piece I shouted at the crowd that night, and only the opening three\
    \ lines come back to me:\nHe pushed a boy scout into a lake\n  Went to a snackbar\
    \ and stole some cake\n  He's a snackbar hooligan!\nAll the verses followed the\
    \ same pattern, a rhyming couplet followed by the one-line \"chorus\", after each\
    \ bellowing of which I urged the audience to shout \"Yeah!\" or \"Oi!\", which\
    \ I am pleased to say they did, with a certain mocking enthusiasm."
