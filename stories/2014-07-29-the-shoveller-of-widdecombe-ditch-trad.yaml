  text: "Shoveller, shoveller, what do you shovel?\nI shovel the muck outside my hovel.\n\
    \  Shoveller, shoveller, lay down your spade,\n  Let us go tiptoe thro' a verdant\
    \ glade.\nNot on your nelly, for shovel I must\n  The muck and the filth and the\
    \ pebbles and dust,\n  I must shovel it all into Widdecombe Ditch\n  And cover\
    \ it o'er with tar and pitch.\n  Shoveller, shoveller, come skip with me\n  Round\
    \ about the linden tree\n  We'll skip in circles 'til we drop\n  Then go to the\
    \ kiosk for a drink of pop.\nAway with you, temptress! Siren! Witch!\n  I only\
    \ drink water from Widdecombe Ditch.\n  It's black and brackish and tastes quite\
    \ foul.\n  Damn you, shoveller! [She turns into an owl.]"
