  text: "Shoveller, shoveller, what do you shovel?\nI shovel the muck outside my hovel.\n\
    \  Shoveller, shoveller, lay down your spade,\n  Let us go tiptoe thro\u2019 a\
    \ verdant glade.\nNot on your nelly, for shovel I must\n  The muck and the filth\
    \ and the pebbles and dust,\n  I must shovel it all into Widdecombe Ditch\n  And\
    \ cover it o'er with tar and pitch.\n  Shoveller, shoveller, come skip with me\n\
    \  Round about the linden tree\n  We'll skip in circles 'til we drop\n  Then go\
    \ to the kiosk for a drink of pop.\nAway with you, temptress! Siren! Witch!\n\
    \  I only drink water from Widdecombe Ditch.\n  It's black and brackish and tastes\
    \ quite foul.\n  Damn you, shoveller! [She turns into an owl.]"
