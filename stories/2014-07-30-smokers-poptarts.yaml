  text: "A letter arrives from Tim Thurn:\nHey there, Mr Key!\_: Every so often over\
    \ the years you have made mention of a snack or breakfast item called \u201Csmokers\u2019\
    \ poptarts\u201D. I don't smoke myself\u2014it's a filthy habit and you ought\
    \ to be roundly ashamed of yourself\u2014but I must confess that whenever I read\
    \ about what I assume to be poptarts specifically designed for smokers I find\
    \ myself salivating. It can be quite embarrassing, for I usually read Hooting\
    \ Yard when travelling on public transport, and on more than one occasion I have\
    \ been found drooling spittle over a fellow-passenger. I have been mistaken for\
    \ an indigent, and beaten about the head with a rolled-up copy of The Daily Incandescent\
    \ Bus Passenger.\nObviously my response to the words \u201Csmokers\u2019 poptarts\u201D\
    \ is irrational, as if I were a Pavlovian dog. I have been led to delve into my\
    \ family history to discover whether there is something nameless and awful lurking\
    \ in my genetic heritage. Thus far I have gone back as far as the sixteenth century\
    \ without finding anything pertinent, though obviously there were numerous smokers\
    \ among my ancestors, for time was when seemingly everybody smoked, all the time.\
    \ What a disgusting world it was!\nAnyway, back to the present day, or to be more\
    \ precise the recent past, the very recent past, actually the Thursday just gone.\
    \ Although you have not mentioned smokers\u2019 poptarts for quite a while, I\
    \ have\u2014as you may have guessed\u2014become obsessed with them. Standing at\
    \ the bus stop on Thursday morning, wobbling my head gently from side to side\
    \ and up and down in a futile attempt to empty it of thoughts of you know what,\
    \ I suddenly felt impelled, as if by some eldritch force, to cave into my longings\
    \ and to damn well go and buy a packet of smokers\u2019 poptarts and wolf them\
    \ down, there and then.\nDo you know what? I could not find a single shop, in\
    \ the great metropolis of Pointy Town, that sold them! I tried bakeries, pastry\
    \ shops, general grocers, supermarkets, hypermarkets, corner shops, charity shops,\
    \ snackbars, picnic shops, and many another type of shop, and from each one I\
    \ tottered out empty-handed and increasingly desperate. Also, I missed my bus.\n\
    I realise I am on the verge of doolallydom, if not already there, and that the\
    \ proper response to that terrible morning would have been to plunge my head repeatedly\
    \ into a bucket of icy water and then have a lie down in a darkened room for several\
    \ days. A sensible man would have done that, but I am no longer a sensible man.\
    \ That is why I am writing to you, imploring you, beseeching you, like a grubby\
    \ mendicant sprawled at the feet of a potentate, to provide me with the recipe,\
    \ so I can make my own smokers\u2019 poptarts, in my own kitchen, and stuff them\
    \ down my gob until I am sick. That, I think, Mr Key, is my one remaining hope\
    \ on this earth.\nYours in extremis, Tim Thurn\nTim might find it helpful to track\
    \ down a copy of Dobson's pamphlet How To Make Your Own Packet Of Half A Dozen\
    \ Smokers\u2019 Poptarts For Tuppence-Ha'penny (out of print). It is many years\
    \ now since I have seen a copy, but as I recall the pamphleteer gives a jaunty\
    \ account of his own muckings about in the kitchen with stuff like flour and suet\
    \ and duckpond water and rolling pins and greaseproof paper and the Lord knows\
    \ what else."
