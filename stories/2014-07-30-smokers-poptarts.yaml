  text: 'A letter arrives from Tim Thurn:

    Hey there, Mr Key! : Every so often over the years you have made mention of a
    snack or breakfast item called "smokers'' poptarts". I don''t smoke myself--it''s
    a filthy habit and you ought to be roundly ashamed of yourself--but I must confess
    that whenever I read about what I assume to be poptarts specifically designed
    for smokers I find myself salivating. It can be quite embarrassing, for I usually
    read Hooting Yard when travelling on public transport, and on more than one occasion
    I have been found drooling spittle over a fellow-passenger. I have been mistaken
    for an indigent, and beaten about the head with a rolled-up copy of The Daily
    Incandescent Bus Passenger.

    Obviously my response to the words "smokers'' poptarts" is irrational, as if I
    were a Pavlovian dog. I have been led to delve into my family history to discover
    whether there is something nameless and awful lurking in my genetic heritage.
    Thus far I have gone back as far as the sixteenth century without finding anything
    pertinent, though obviously there were numerous smokers among my ancestors, for
    time was when seemingly everybody smoked, all the time. What a disgusting world
    it was!

    Anyway, back to the present day, or to be more precise the recent past, the very
    recent past, actually the Thursday just gone. Although you have not mentioned
    smokers'' poptarts for quite a while, I have--as you may have guessed--become
    obsessed with them. Standing at the bus stop on Thursday morning, wobbling my
    head gently from side to side and up and down in a futile attempt to empty it
    of thoughts of you know what, I suddenly felt impelled, as if by some eldritch
    force, to cave into my longings and to damn well go and buy a packet of smokers''
    poptarts and wolf them down, there and then.

    Do you know what? I could not find a single shop, in the great metropolis of Pointy
    Town, that sold them! I tried bakeries, pastry shops, general grocers, supermarkets,
    hypermarkets, corner shops, charity shops, snackbars, picnic shops, and many another
    type of shop, and from each one I tottered out empty-handed and increasingly desperate.
    Also, I missed my bus.

    I realise I am on the verge of doolallydom, if not already there, and that the
    proper response to that terrible morning would have been to plunge my head repeatedly
    into a bucket of icy water and then have a lie down in a darkened room for several
    days. A sensible man would have done that, but I am no longer a sensible man.
    That is why I am writing to you, imploring you, beseeching you, like a grubby
    mendicant sprawled at the feet of a potentate, to provide me with the recipe,
    so I can make my own smokers'' poptarts, in my own kitchen, and stuff them down
    my gob until I am sick. That, I think, Mr Key, is my one remaining hope on this
    earth.

    Yours in extremis, Tim Thurn

    Tim might find it helpful to track down a copy of Dobson''s pamphlet How To Make
    Your Own Packet Of Half A Dozen Smokers'' Poptarts For Tuppence-Ha''penny (out
    of print). It is many years now since I have seen a copy, but as I recall the
    pamphleteer gives a jaunty account of his own muckings about in the kitchen with
    stuff like flour and suet and duckpond water and rolling pins and greaseproof
    paper and the Lord knows what else.'
