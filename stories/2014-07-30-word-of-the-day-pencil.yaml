  text: 'Word of the day : Pencil.

    Today we are going to consider, in all its ramifications and from every conceivable
    angle, the word pencil. Before we do so, however, imagine yourself steaming open
    my correspondence and, with the aid of a flaming torch in the darkness, reading
    the latest missive to plop onto the Key mat:

    Dear Mr Key : Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Poppy Nisbet and I am the
    downstairs neighbour of your pesky serial Word of the Day correspondent Wlad Onanugu.
    Or, should I say, I was his downstairs neighbour. I am pleased to say that the
    upstairs flat is now empty, Mr Onanugu having been dragged away, very early this
    morning, by a whirling tangle of ruffians dressed in police uniforms. Next stop
    : Durance Vile, a barren rock far out at sea, from which no convict has ever escaped,
    and where there are no stationery supplies. You will not be hearing from Mr O.
    again. That will teach him to spit at one of my kittens in the hallway.

    I have innumerable kittens, and I also have a great love of words, which is why
    your Word of the Day series has proved such a tonic. At one point I was so damnably
    cheerful that I even considered letting Mr Onanugu off the hook, and not making
    that call to my pals on the Legally Questionable Abduction Team. The spat-upon
    kitten gazed at me plaintively, however, and wiser counsels prevailed.

    Anyway, to business! I am a very busy woman, so it is only today that I have found
    the time to enact the illustrative sentence you gave for the word parp. I clattered
    into a room full of tots, having first smeared my face with beetroot juice and
    boggled my eyes. I then parped my hooter. I am pleased to say it was a roaring
    (or should I say parping?) success.

    When I can find time within my schedule I intend to act out all the words in your
    Word of the Day feature, whether or not you provide an illustrative sentence.
    For verbs this should pose no serious challenge. As for nouns, I have already
    resolved to make purchase of a mop and some glue and a pencil, and will take it
    from there.

    I will not, however, be pestering you with daily letters keeping you abreast of
    my doings, as I am mindful that you only have limited space available for the
    Word of the Day, and I appreciate that you must become exasperated when that space
    is taken up, as it is today, by foolish wittering letters from your readers. I
    fear I have already prevented you from paying due attention to pencil, thus increasing
    the backlog of words which you still need to get to grips with if you are to maintain
    your dignity as a Word of the Dayist. By my reckoning, that includes toot, hooter,
    tots, boggle, clunk, glue, and nap..

    Perhaps I can be of assistance by performing some sort of stage flummery utilising
    all those words at one fell swoop, and writing an account of it for you. Then
    you would be able to put each and every one of them behind you and "move on",
    as the airheads say nowadays. First of all, though, I must feed my kittens, and
    wipe them free of any neighbours'' spittle.

    Yours terrifically, Poppy Nisbet

    I am most grateful to Ms Nisbet, and shall await her report. In recognition of
    her efforts, I have decided that tomorrow''s Word of the Day will be nisbet.'
