  text: 'One grim bright morning, Captain Nitty was walking along an imposing and
    expansive boulevard when one of his lungs collapsed.

    "Oof!" he gasped, before crumpling in an untidy angular heap upon the paving slabs.
    As he fell, his captainy cap fell off his head, and, landing on its brim, rolled
    into the gutter, where it was worried by a stray dog.

    The dog had strayed from its owner, who was known to Captain Nitty, though the
    dog was not. Captain Nitty had what is known as dog-blindness, in that he could
    never perceive any dog with any of his five senses. So, even had he had his wits
    about him, rather than being sprawled gasping on the pavement, he would not have
    been aware of the dog gnawing and pawing his cap.

    Later, in a bed on a ward in the clinic to where he had been ferried by a rickety
    and inefficient ambulance, Captain Nitty asked the clinic chaplain, who was sitting
    at his bedside telling the seven last words from the cross on his rosary beads,
    where his cap was. The chaplain replied in Latin, a language with which Captain
    Nitty was unfamiliar. What he said was, "Do not interrupt me with questions about
    your cap when I am praying for the salvation of your immortal soul through the
    words of Christ in his last extremity".

    Meanwhile, the dog had carried the cap, in its mouth, away from the boulevard
    to a patch of gorse and scrub over by the viaduct. Here, it lost interest in the
    cap and deposited it in a puddle. Then it scampered off to frighten some tiny
    tots gathered around a spooky fathomless inky-black pond.

    Captain Nitty made a miraculous recovery and that very same day, at around teatime,
    was back on his feet. He discharged himself from the clinic and went in search
    of his cap. Does it bring tears to your eyes, the thought of him, bare-headed
    and desperate, looking in all the wrong places, plagued by invisible dogs, day
    after grim bright day, fruitlessly, fruitlessly, fruitlessly? It should.'
