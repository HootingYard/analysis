  text: 'Like a saint in a medieval painting, Captain Nitty bore an attribute. Saint
    Clement, for example, is usually shown with an anchor, Saint John Chrysostom with
    bees, Saint Dunstan with a hammer and tongs, and Saint Vedast with a wolf carrying
    a goose in its mouth. Captain Nitty was often to be seen with a handful of breadcrumbs.

    There are several photographs of Captain Nitty, taken by the Pointy Town High
    Street snapper F X Duggleby, in all but one of which his attribute or emblem is
    present and correct. Captain Nitty holds out his open palm, piled with breadcrumbs,
    as if proffering them to the viewer. (The exception is the picture of Captain
    Nitty pretending to fly. He is wearing a pair of wings made out of corrugated
    cardboard, satin and tat, and gazing into the middle distance with a look of startling
    stupidity. The chains with which he is attached to the ceiling of Duggleby''s
    studio are clearly visible, despite the photographer''s efforts to bleach them
    out with bleach.)

    There are two different stories given as the origin of Captain Nitty''s traditional
    association with a handful of breadcrumbs. The first is that our hero was regularly
    sent on manoeuvres to a municipal park where insurgents, bent on toppling the
    regime, were said to use the flowerbeds, with their dazzling splurges of lupins
    and hollyhocks, as places of concealment. Anent the flowerbeds was a pond in which
    teal, mergansers, pintails and swans were rife. Soft-hearted--and, by some accounts,
    soft-brained--Captain Nitty liked to feed the ducks and swans by scattering breadcrumbs
    upon the surface of the waters. After the regime was toppled, he took much of
    the blame, "distracted by ducks" in the words of the official charge sheet. Unlike
    a saint in a medieval painting, Captain Nitty was not martyred, unless one considers
    a sentence of several months potato-peeling duty a martyrdom.

    The other story is vastly more complicated and impossible to summarise. Readers
    would do better to study the seven-volume novel sequence Game Of Breadcrumbs,
    making notes all the while in the margins. Those of you without the patience or
    ability to read can instead watch the television adaptation, which has won a mantelpiece''s
    worth of awards, including the Silver Bauble for Best Swan and the F X Duggleby
    Memorial Pot for Most Innovative Use Of Bleach.'
