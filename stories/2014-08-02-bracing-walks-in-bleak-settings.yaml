  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes a correspondent I have just made up, I know you are a\
    \ constant reader who always has \u201Ca book on the go\u201D, as they say. It\
    \ would interest me to know how you go about choosing which book you are going\
    \ to read next.\nIn the normal course of things, I would be hard put to give a\
    \ straightforward answer to that question. Like most of us, I suspect, I alight\
    \ upon books for all manner of different reasons, not always rational. Today,\
    \ however, I can say definitively that I decided on my current reading simply\
    \ because I saw a photograph in the newspaper of Michael Gove reading it.\nWhen\
    \ he was sacked as Education Secretary the other week, the Grauniad had a double-page\
    \ spread on Gove, much of which was of course devoted to attacking him. Among\
    \ the accompanying photos was one of Gove \u201Cat a literary festival\u201D,\
    \ where he was shown reading from\u2014the title was clearly visible\u2014The\
    \ Lost World of British Communism by Raphael Samuel, essays written in the 1980s\
    \ but published in book form (by Verso) in 2006.\nI immediately wanted to read\
    \ this book, and eventually got round to borrowing it from the library. Just a\
    \ few pages in, and it looks very promising. In the preface by Samuel's widow\
    \ Alison Light, I learn that among the treats in store are such details as\nwhat\
    \ Communists sang or watched at the cinema; what they wore, (open-necked shirts,\
    \ if they were men, with a pen or pencil prominently displayed in the breast pocket;\
    \ jumper, slacks and \u2018sensible shoes\u2019 if they were women); how Party\
    \ members comported themselves in public (they were urged to be neat and clean);\
    \ where they went on holiday\u2014if indeed they took holidays\u2014preferring\
    \ \u2018bracing walks\u2019 in bleak settings; the content and feel of their homes,\
    \ which were usually uncomfortable, with a small shrine of books and the garden\
    \ left a wilderness, the author tells us, for want of \u2018personal time\u2019\
    .\nI shall report further snippets of interest as I read on. Meanwhile, if any\
    \ readers are able to provide further photographs of Michael Gove reading particular\
    \ books, I will be very grateful."
