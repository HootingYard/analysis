  text: 'I went to the greengrocer''s and bought a bag of weird oranges. I say bag,
    but it was really a net, spun from some kind of red synthetic fibre, fastened
    with a dinky metal clasp. The net contained, by my reckoning, half a dozen oranges.
    And weird they were, though my intention had been to buy blood oranges. I was
    persuaded by the patter of the greengrocer to take the weird ones instead. The
    curious thing about his patter was that, by the time I was a few yards along the
    street, clutching my net, on my way to the park, I was unable to recall a single
    word of it. Why was I carrying weird oranges instead of the blood oranges I had
    wanted? I had no idea, but nor did I seem able to retrace my steps. I hurried
    on towards the gates of the park as if impelled by a force outwith my perception.

    Arriving at the park, I made my way to my usual bench anent the duckpond. The
    ducks looked forlorn and ill-tempered. I discovered that it was impossible to
    unfasten the clasp on the net with my bare hands. It was, as I said, dinky, about
    the size of say eight standard stationery staples impacted together laterally.
    I picked at it with my fingernails but could get no purchase. I then tried to
    tear a slit in the net itself. God knows what the fibres were made of. Whatever
    it was resisted my increasingly energetic attempts to rend it. I gave up when
    my fingers were red with bloody stripes and my hands were shaking.

    My plan had been--oh, it hardly matters, does it?, now it was so plainly abortive.
    In any case, I reflected, as I sat on the bench panting from my exertions, my
    plan probably would not have succeeded anyway, since I had been coaxed into buying
    weird oranges instead of blood oranges, the latter being a crucial element in
    the plan. A teal--or it might have been a merganser--paddled to the edge of the
    duckpond and fixed me with a look of reproach. I spat on the ground, and kept
    on spitting, until I had exhausted my phlegm.

    Then I went a-trudging, without aim or purpose, through the park and along the
    lane past the railway sidings, up into the hills, those damnable pointy hills.
    I left the net of weird oranges on the park bench, from which they were snaffled,
    before the day''s end, by a wolf. It was a weird wolf, so at least there was some
    kind of neatness to what was otherwise a most jambly-jumbly day.'
