  text: "Two of the answers in today's Guardian crossword were SPECKLE and SPLODGE.\
    \ This put me in mind of Dobson's pamphlet A Comparative Study Of Speckles And\
    \ Splodges And Smudges (out of print). It is one of his most exasperating works.\
    \ The exasperation lies, in the words of the critic Rappa Kohoutek, in the fact\
    \ that\nDobson opens with the grand statement that \u201Cthe speckle, the splodge,\
    \ and the smudge are each of them wholly discrete and different phenomena, and\
    \ to muddle them up is not merely ignorance, but dangerous ignorance. Wars have\
    \ been fought, and men have died, for failure to distinguish between the three\u201D\
    . This is exasperating on two counts. First, in the eighty pages of microscopically\
    \ tiny print that follow, the pamphleteer himself neglects to explain the difference\
    \ between speckles and splodges and smudges. Second, nor does he provide a single\
    \ example of the war and death he so melodramatically warns the reader of and\
    \ I am going to let this sentence run on because I hate to end with a preposition\
    \ even though to do so is completely defensible unless one is up against the most\
    \ rigorous of pedants armed, as certain pedants are, with a hammer of correction.\n\
    It is perhaps worth noting here that Rappa Kohoutek bore several dents in his\
    \ head, made by one such \u201Chammer of correction\u201D wielded by a particularly\
    \ rigorous pedant whose path he used to cross occasionally. The critic liked to\
    \ spend his mornings at a sophisticated pavement caf\xE9 sipping from a glass\
    \ of bengkht. Along the pavement would come the pedant with his hammer, lashing\
    \ out with what used to be called \u201Cgay abandon\u201D.\nThe dents in his head\
    \ did not effect Rappa Kohoutek's critical acumen, however, and we must agree\
    \ with his judgement about this particular Dobson pamphlet. In a sense, we have\
    \ no option but to agree with him, and trust him, because we are never likely\
    \ to read the work itself. As he points out, the text of the pamphlet is microscopically\
    \ tiny, and he is not exaggerating. It is so tiny that the average reader would\
    \ ruin their eyesight before getting to the end of the preface and acknowledgements.\
    \ Rappa Kohoutek explains in an afterword to his own essay that he was able to\
    \ read all eighty pages of text because his sense of vision was inexplicably enhanced\
    \ by one of the blows to the head he received from the pedant's hammer of correction.\
    \ In a further afterword to a second printing of his essay, the critic relates\
    \ how a subsequent blow from the same hammer restored his sight to its previous\
    \ mild myopia:\nAnd so I shall never again be able to read Dobson's pamphlet on\
    \ speckles and splodges and smudges. But quite frankly, why on earth would I want\
    \ to? It is absolute drivel.\nA hugely magnified copy of Dobson's pamphlet has\
    \ been made available by the Dobson Pamphlet Magnification Commission, but so\
    \ tiny is the text that in spite of the hugeness of the magnification it is still\
    \ pretty much illegible to any human eye."
