    This put me in mind of Dobson''s pamphlet A Comparative Study Of Speckles And
    Splodges And Smudges (out of print). It is one of his most exasperating works.
    The exasperation lies, in the words of the critic Rappa Kohoutek, in the fact
    that

    Dobson opens with the grand statement that "the speckle, the splodge, and the
    smudge are each of them wholly discrete and different phenomena, and to muddle
    them up is not merely ignorance, but dangerous ignorance. Wars have been fought,
    and men have died, for failure to distinguish between the three". This is exasperating
    on two counts. First, in the eighty pages of microscopically tiny print that follow,
    the pamphleteer himself neglects to explain the difference between speckles and
    splodges and smudges. Second, nor does he provide a single example of the war
    and death he so melodramatically warns the reader of and I am going to let this
    sentence run on because I hate to end with a preposition even though to do so
    is completely defensible unless one is up against the most rigorous of pedants
    armed, as certain pedants are, with a hammer of correction.

    It is perhaps worth noting here that Rappa Kohoutek bore several dents in his
    head, made by one such "hammer of correction" wielded by a particularly rigorous
    pedant whose path he used to cross occasionally. The critic liked to spend his
    mornings at a sophisticated pavement cafe sipping from a glass of bengkht. Along
    the pavement would come the pedant with his hammer, lashing out with what used
    to be called "gay abandon".

    The dents in his head did not effect Rappa Kohoutek''s critical acumen, however,
    and we must agree with his judgement about this particular Dobson pamphlet. In
    a sense, we have no option but to agree with him, and trust him, because we are
    never likely to read the work itself. As he points out, the text of the pamphlet
    is microscopically tiny, and he is not exaggerating. It is so tiny that the average
    reader would ruin their eyesight before getting to the end of the preface and
    acknowledgements. Rappa Kohoutek explains in an afterword to his own essay that
    he was able to read all eighty pages of text because his sense of vision was inexplicably
    enhanced by one of the blows to the head he received from the pedant''s hammer
    of correction. In a further afterword to a second printing of his essay, the critic
    relates how a subsequent blow from the same hammer restored his sight to its previous
    mild myopia:

    And so I shall never again be able to read Dobson''s pamphlet on speckles and
    splodges and smudges. But quite frankly, why on earth would I want to? It is absolute
    drivel.

    A hugely magnified copy of Dobson''s pamphlet has been made available by the Dobson
    Pamphlet Magnification Commission, but so tiny is the text that in spite of the
    hugeness of the magnification it is still pretty much illegible to any human eye.'
