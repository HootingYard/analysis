  text: 'Our man in Ulm has sent this report from the Festival of Argumentative Music
    in Ulm:

    The annual Festival of Argumentative Music in Ulm has become a highlight on the
    calendar for lovers of grumpy German improv jazz, and this year they received
    a special treat with a performance by grumpy German improv jazz titan Horst Blot.
    With his usual septet augmented by glockenspiel, steam hammers, Japanese cardboard
    trombone, and an electronically-enhanced janitor''s mop, Blot devoted his entire
    four-hour set to a startling reinvention of the old jazz standard Chutney On My
    Spats.

    Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the concert. I had a very trying day.
    In the morning I had an ague and the quinsy, and then shortly after lunch I was
    stricken by jellybrain and cork-in-the-ears. In addition, I had to deal with a
    gas leak and a letter demanding the return of an overdue library book. The final
    straw was the discovery that my press pass had expired, meaning I would have to
    pay out of my own pocket for a ticket to the Festival. Horst Blot may well be
    a grumpy German improv jazz titan, but I am not going to open my wallet for him.

    Instead, I waited until the next day to read the review in Godawful Racket magazine.
    What a load of codswallop! It was written by Primrose Dent, who opined that the
    music was, among other things, searing, bippety-boppety, tough, chewy, Machiavellian,
    plinky-plonky, mordant, splenetic, sunlit, dappled, goosebumpy, tenebrous, and
    "a bit like a choc ice". In other words, she simply pulled a load of adjectives
    out of a bag and strung them together.

    Now I have done exactly the same thing, in some of my reports from Ulm, in the
    days when I used to have a valid press pass. I wrote out hundreds of adjectives
    on hundreds of scraps of paper, stuffed them into a pippy bag and then plucked
    out a few dozen each time I had to write an article on, say, the bus stops of
    Ulm, or the gazebos of beekeepers in Ulm, or indeed an earlier Horst Blot concert
    at the Festival of Argumentative Music in Ulm, where he played a shorter, three-and-a-half-hour
    version of Chutney On My Spats, without the glockenspiel, steam hammers, Japanese
    cardboard trombone, and electronically-enhanced janitor''s mop, but with a steam
    glockenspiel, a Japanese cardboard mop, and a bowl of rice pudding. My articles
    may have been codswallop too, but they were emotionally-wrenching codswallop which
    elicited great heaving sobs from my readers. I know this because they used to
    write to me, although I was never able to read their letters, smudged as they
    were with salty tears.

    When I have recovered my wits I shall write a letter to Godawful Racket magazine
    pointing out that Primrose Dent has been deaf as a post since that episode in
    the wind tunnel at the aerodrome. She also puts her adjectives in the wrong sort
    of bag.

    Over and out, Your Man In Ulm.'
