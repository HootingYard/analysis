  text: 'Another dispatch from our man in Ulm:

    I am still in Ulm. I may be here for the foreseeable future. Yesterday I told
    you that I was stricken, after lunch, by jellybrain and cork-in-the-ears. My symptoms
    have abated not one whit. I am not entirely sure what a whit is. Perhaps it is
    related to a squib which, you might have noticed, in your reading over the years,
    is invariably described as damp. I have never come across a squib that was moist,
    or wet, or soaking wet, or drenched, let alone one that was dry, or bone dry.
    No, a squib is always damp. Can the same be said for the whit?

    You might be waiting for me to apologise for digressing, impatient as you must
    be to hear of the latest doings in Ulm. But apologise I will not. I have much
    else to contend with, such as my medical condition(s) and that gas leak (still
    not fixed). Added to which, there has been a bittern storm over the city, the
    sky is almost black with bitterns, and I have had to light a candle to see by.
    Then there is the question of whits and squibs, and the revelation that not a
    single gazebo in Ulm is owned by a beekeeper, at least not legally. There may
    be squatters, off the grid.

    So I think it is plain that being your man in Ulm is no picnic. I cannot remember
    when last I went on a picnic. This is made all the more galling when one thinks
    how easily available are sausages so suitable for picnics. Instead I must eat
    these sausages indoors, or at best at a table on a pavement outside a cafe. Would
    it count as a picnic, I wonder, if I spread a blanket on the pavement, a few feet
    away from the table, and sprawled there, eating my sausages? I think I would be
    liable to arrest, as a pavement nuisance.

    That is all I have time to babble on about today, from Ulm. Some might describe
    this dispatch as a damp squib. If so, don''t blame me. Blame the bitterns, whose
    stormy appearance in the sky over Ulm has blotted out the sun, and made us all
    a little more prone to gloomy thoughts. The pig in his sty is a happier fellow.

    Over and out, your man in Ulm.'
