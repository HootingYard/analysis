  text: 'The willow warbler is a type of bird which warbles in willows. I am not a
    bird--obviously!--but I, too, have warbled in willows. It is a simple enough matter.
    What you do is locate a clump of willows, then wander into the midst of them,
    and start warbling. You can then describe yourself as a willow warbler, perhaps
    when, at a sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece,
    you are approached by a fellow guest who asks you what you do. "I am a willow
    warbler", you can say, truthfully.

    Among the various definitions given for warble in the OED, the one I find particularly
    helpful is "To twitter, as a young bird; to make uncertain attempts at singing".
    This is my kind of warbling, because, frankly, I cannot sing for toffee. But there
    is nothing to stop me making "uncertain attempts" at singing, in the midst of
    a clump of willows, whenever the mood takes me. And take me it often does!, to
    the point of mania.

    I have a varied repertoire of songs which I warble--or sing uncertainly--on my
    willowy jaunts. Land Of Ladies by the Brothers Johnson, Vienna by Ultravox, Boom
    Bang-A-Bang by Lulu, and Nunc dimittis servum tuum by The Toofles are among my
    favourites. I struggle with the words--and tunes--of all of them, but that is
    par for the course with warbling. Occasionally I am shot at by farmers.
