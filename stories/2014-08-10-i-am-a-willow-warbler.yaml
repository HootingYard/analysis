  text: "The willow warbler is a type of bird which warbles in willows. I am not a\
    \ bird\u2014obviously!\u2014but I, too, have warbled in willows. It is a simple\
    \ enough matter. What you do is locate a clump of willows, then wander into the\
    \ midst of them, and start warbling. You can then describe yourself as a willow\
    \ warbler, perhaps when, at a sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly\
    \ against a mantelpiece, you are approached by a fellow guest who asks you what\
    \ you do. \u201CI am a willow warbler\u201D, you can say, truthfully.\nAmong the\
    \ various definitions given for warble in the OED, the one I find particularly\
    \ helpful is \u201CTo twitter, as a young bird; to make uncertain attempts at\
    \ singing\u201D. This is my kind of warbling, because, frankly, I cannot sing\
    \ for toffee. But there is nothing to stop me making \u201Cuncertain attempts\u201D\
    \ at singing, in the midst of a clump of willows, whenever the mood takes me.\
    \ And take me it often does!, to the point of mania.\nI have a varied repertoire\
    \ of songs which I warble\u2014or sing uncertainly\u2014on my willowy jaunts.\
    \ Land Of Ladies by the Brothers Johnson, Vienna by Ultravox, Boom Bang-A-Bang\
    \ by Lulu, and Nunc dimittis servum tuum by The Toofles are among my favourites.\
    \ I struggle with the words\u2014and tunes\u2014of all of them, but that is par\
    \ for the course with warbling. Occasionally I am shot at by farmers.\n"
