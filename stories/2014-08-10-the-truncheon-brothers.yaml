  text: "The Truncheon Brothers, Tad and Tod, were an unacclaimed act from the golden\
    \ age of variety theatre. Both dressed as middle-ranking police officers, they\
    \ would bound creakily on to the stage\u2014they were of advancing years\u2014\
    Tad from the right and Tod from the left or, as it might be, Tod from the right\
    \ and Tad from the left, and proceed to bludgeon each other about the head with\
    \ their truncheons. These were lead-weighted heavy rubber truncheons as deployed\
    \ by real coppers. One or other of them, Tad or Tod, would collapse unconscious\
    \ to the floor first, at which point the still-conscious-but-decidedly-woozy one,\
    \ Tod or Tad, would break into song, usually slurring the words due to the disorientation\
    \ occasioned by the several blows to the head received. The song itself never\
    \ varied. A third, non-performing brother, Gilliblat, wrote both the words and\
    \ the music. The lyrics were as follows:\nI bashed my brother on the head\n  But\
    \ don't you worry, he's not dead\n  We will be back tomorrow night\n  For another\
    \ truncheon fight\n  We're the Truncheon Brothers, Tad and Tod\n  And we bathe\
    \ in the blood of the Lamb of God\n  We take our baths offstage of course\n  Now\
    \ please cheer us until you are hoarse\n  We'll pass a cap round for your cash\n\
    \  Then I'll give Tod [or it might be Tad] a final bash\nThe cap, passed around\
    \ the audience by Gilliblat, rarely had any cash in it by the time it came back\
    \ to him, though the Truncheon Brothers never wanted for buttons and corks and\
    \ scrunched-up bits of paper.\nSource : Some Truly Awful Acts Who Appeared At\
    \ Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre, 1880\u20131910 by Dobson (out of print)."
