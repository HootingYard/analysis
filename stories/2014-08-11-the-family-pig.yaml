  text: 'The Phosphorescent Family had a pet pig. Its name was Baptiste, and it lived
    in a sty in the family compound. This compound was similar to the Kennedy Compound
    at Hyannisport, home of the Irish-American political dynasty, but in the case
    of the Phosphorescent compound it should be noted that the tall wire fence surrounding
    the property was, like the family, phosphorescent. The pig, by the way, was not.

    Leafing through some old back numbers of The Hammer Of Christ the other day, I
    came upon an article recounting the tale of how the Phosphorescent Family obtained
    their pig. It was not a very interesting story, and I suspect it found its way
    into the magazine because the author was in possession of potentially explosive
    information about the editor. Never underestimate the amount of squalor, unseemliness,
    blackmail, and extortion in which even the most well-regarded periodicals wallow.

    Anyway, the article has it that one day the patriarch of the Phosphorescent Family,
    Old Pappy Phosph, was leaning on a clump of gack in the compound, staring at the
    sky, lost in wonder, when he heard distant grunting. He rushed indoors to fetch
    his reel-to-reel tape recorder, for like everyone else in the family he was a
    keen tape-recordist of distant sounds, whether they were grunts or howls or gunfire
    or squelching. The Phosphorescent Family liked nothing better of an evening than
    to sit around splicing together tape-loops of various distant sounds and then
    playing them in unison. Over the years representatives from record companies and
    avant garde music festivals in Ulm had come bashing at the gates of the compound
    offering huge sums of money for these recordings, but they were always sent away
    empty-handed and with phosphorus burns in the very centre of their foreheads.
    The family had no interest in the stardom that would inevitably have swept them
    up had their tape-loops gone to the top of the hit parade.

    On the evening that they listened to Old Pappy Phosph''s recording of distant
    pig grunting, it so happened that one of the tinier members of the family piped
    up with a query about the source of the sounds. Told it was a pig, she begged
    for a pig of her own. It was gently explained to her that a pig needs a sty to
    live in and there was no such sty in the compound.

    "Then I thall build one mythelf, and thpread it with phothphorethent muck!" she
    keened, before bursting into tears.

    And the very next day, she did, and so impressed was the family by her initiative
    and energy that Old Pappy Phosph strode out across the fields and abducted the
    very same pig whose gruntings now played on a continuous loop on the tape-recorder
    next to the tiny girl''s bed.

    It was her cousin, Armand Phosph, a Francophile, who named the pig Baptiste.

    As I said, it is not a particularly interesting tale, but I thought it worth sharing
    with you, if only because it gives us a first dim insight into the lives of the
    Phosphorescent Family. From a selfish point of view, it allowed me to make use--tangentially,
    but to my satisfaction--of the words "Readings have been taken from the soil.
    The pig has been chosen" which came to me in my dreams just before waking this
    morning. We have phosphorescent muck rather than soil, and the pig was abducted
    rather than chosen, but I have kept faith with my not yet quite awake brain, and
    that''s good enough for me, so it ought to be good enough for you.'
