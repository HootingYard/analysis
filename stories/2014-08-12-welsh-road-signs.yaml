  text: "According to a story in the \u201CFunny Old World\u201D column in the current\
    \ issue of Private Eye, road signs in Wales are \u201Cmistranslated into Welsh\
    \ on an enormously regular basis\u201D. The example given is of a sign at a roundabout\
    \ between Penarth and Cardiff. The English Cyclists dismount is given in Welsh\
    \ as Llid y bledren dymchwelyd, or Bladder disease has returned."
