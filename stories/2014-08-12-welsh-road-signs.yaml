  text: According to a story in the "Funny Old World" column in the current issue
    of Private Eye, road signs in Wales are "mistranslated into Welsh on an enormously
    regular basis". The example given is of a sign at a roundabout between Penarth
    and Cardiff. The English Cyclists dismount is given in Welsh as Llid y bledren
    dymchwelyd, or Bladder disease has returned.
