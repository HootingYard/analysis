text: "According to a story in the \u201CFunny Old World\u201D column in the current\
  \ issue of Private Eye, road signs in Wales are \u201Cmistranslated into Welsh on\
  \ an enormously regular basis\u201D. The example given is of a sign at a roundabout\
  \ between Penarth and Cardiff. The English Cyclists dismount is given in Welsh as\
  \ Llid y bledren dymchwelyd, or Bladder disease has returned."
