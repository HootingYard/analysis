  text: 'One of the BBC''s regular weather forecasters is Stav Danaos. This always
    sounds to me like a name from Game Of Thrones. One imagines Stav hanging out with,
    say, Stannis Baratheon or Daenerys Targaryen. That being so, it is somewhat puzzling
    that his weather forecasts do not consist simply of the words "winter is coming",
    every day.
