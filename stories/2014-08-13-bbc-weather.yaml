  text: "One of the BBC's regular weather forecasters is Stav Danaos. This always\
    \ sounds to me like a name from Game Of Thrones. One imagines Stav hanging out\
    \ with, say, Stannis Baratheon or Daenerys Targaryen. That being so, it is somewhat\
    \ puzzling that his weather forecasts do not consist simply of the words \u201C\
    winter is coming\u201D, every day.\n"
