  text: '[Thanks again to R.]

    There is a song on Hex Enduction Hour, the 1982 album by The Fall, entitled "Hip
    Priest". It was a great favourite of the Phosphorescent Family, particularly of
    Old Pappy Phosph, who, in a certain light, from a certain angle, on certain days
    of the week, at certain times of day, bore a passing resemblance to Mark E. Smith,
    through a glass darkly.

    One evening at a family singsong around the phosphorescent fireplace, Old Pappy
    struck up an a capella version of "Hip Priest". Now it had not escaped the notice
    of tiny Mopsa Phosph that, when listening to a tape loop of distant pig gruntings,
    one of her sisters had keened and wailed that she wanted a pig of her own, and
    the very next day Old Pappy abducted one for her. (See The Family Pig for further
    details.) So Mopsa in turn keened and wailed that she wanted a hip priest, then
    burst into tears.

    But as Old Pappy began to make reassuring cooing noises, and seemed on the verge
    of promising that he would abduct a hip priest for her, Old Ma Phosph put her
    foot down.

    "We will have no Papists in this family compound!" she cried. In common with about
    two thirds of the Phosphorescent Family, Old Ma was a devout Zoroastrian. But
    Mopsa had a cunning beyond her years, and immediately revised her keening.

    "I want a hip magus! I want a hip magus!" she screeched, until Old Pappy becalmed
    her by promising to stride out across the fields first thing in the morning and
    abduct one for her.

    Then two of tiny Mopsa''s tiny sisters piped up, demanding that they be given
    hip magi too. Old Pappy, who remembered his Bible stories, thought it reasonable
    that magi should come in threes.

    "Don''t you worry, girlies," he said soothingly, "Tomorrow morning I will abduct
    three hip magi and bring them back to the compound. We can keep them in one of
    the outbuildings next to the phosphorescent fence."

    And Old Pappy was as good as his word.

    Unfortunately, within a few days the Phosphorescent Family were much disconcerted
    by the activities of their hip magi, who did a lot of shouting and waving of banners
    and placards outwith the outbuilding. It soon became apparent that they were lefty
    hip magi, forever banging on about the iniquities of the Americans and the Zionists
    and prescribing infantile and witless solutions to social and economic issues.
    Old Ma Phosph, in particular, was none too pleased. She was, after all, a Fascist
    as well as a Zoroastrian.

    "The hip magi will have to go," she announced, "If they are not shouting and protesting
    they sit around in their armchairs reading Chomsky and John Pilge. Old Grampy
    Phosph must be turning in his grave to see such things happening within the family
    compound he built with his bare phosphorescent hands!"

    So Old Pappy and Old Ma took Mopsa and her sisters aside, and explained to them,
    very patiently and tenderly, that the hip magi would have to go. There were tears,
    of course, and keening and wailing, but then Old Pappy had a brainwave.

    "I tell you what, girlies! We can have a great deal of fun running the hip magi
    off our property, pursuing them across the fields with pitchforks and blazing
    torches and trapping them in Loopy Copse, where I have already dug a pit to chuck
    them into. And then, as a special treat, I will go and abduct Mark E. Smith of
    The Fall, and we will keep him in the outbuilding! You can feed him on the scraps
    left over by Baptiste the Family Pig. What do you think of that?"

    And the tiny Phosphorescent girls whooped cries of delight and skipped and gambolled
    off across the lawn. Peace settled once more upon the Phosphorescent family compound,
    and the filthy magpie swooped down to perch on Old Ma Phosph''s pippybonnet.'
