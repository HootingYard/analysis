  text: 'It was time, I decided, for a brisk splosh, so I went to find a puddle. The
    deeper the puddle, the sploshier the splosh, as Curbingham reminds us. What you
    do not want to do, however, is to mistake, for a deep puddle, an unusually small
    yet unexpectedly deep pond, or mere, or cwm, or, great heavens to Betsy!, a waterlogged
    bottomless viper pit. For that reason it is wise to arm yourself, before setting
    out, or somewhere along the way, with a stick. The stick ought to be stout and
    of a certain length, such that, when one end of the stick is placed on the ground,
    and the stick held vertically, the other end is no higher than the top of your
    head. Then, when you probe the puddle with the stick, you will be able to judge
    its depth in relation to your own height. The basic idea is that you do not find
    yourself making a brisk splosh in a body of water so deep that the top of your
    head will vanish below the surface, till human voices wake you, and you drown.
    That is not a splosh--it is tomfoolery, and perilously so.

    On the day I am telling you about, I neglected to heed my own advice, and I did
    not have a stick about my person when I arrived at what I took to be an apt puddle.
    It was in the middle of a bosky lane stretching from Loopy Copse to the godforsaken
    piggery at Mustard Parva. I judged it to be a recent puddle, taking into account
    the meteorological conditions and the time of day, which, looking at my wristwatch,
    I had as 7.45 a.m.. This was erroneous. Unbeknown to me, my watch was running
    fast, and the true time was more likely somewhere between twenty to thirty minutes
    earlier.

    Taken all in all, my having the wrong time was of no relevance vis-a-vis the depth
    of the puddle, but it was, I think, symptomatic of my jumbleheadedness that morning.
    There was also my failure to obtain a stick, as noted, and the fact that I had
    had only one sausage rather than the usual two for my breakfast, which played
    havoc with my innards, including the brain. I am a creature of habit.

    This is not the place to indulge in a rant about the cafe, which had so mismanaged
    its affairs that it was exhausted of sausages at 7.00 a.m. by my watch, or roughly
    6.35 a.m. in brute reality. Or, contrarily, perhaps this is the very place to
    cast anathemas upon Mr Boggis and his helpmeets at the cafe Where else am I to
    give vent to my exasperation? When I was told there was only a single sausage
    left on the premises, so early in the day, I suggested to Mr Boggis that he might
    send one of the helpmeets to replenish the supplies. Where, he asked me, did I
    think it possible to get hold of dozens of sausages at such an early hour? This
    had me stumped, for I know nothing of the wholesale sausage business, as why should
    I? Unable to frame a coherent response, I babbled invective and tore my paper
    napkin to shreds. Mr Boggis disappeared into the kitchen. When, shortly afterwards,
    he returned with the last sausage on a plate, I announced that "going forward",
    as is the phrase nowadays, I would be taking my breakfast elsewhere. He reminded
    me that Tuck In With Mr Boggis was the only cafe for miles upon miles in any direction,
    and certainly the only one within walking distance of my hovel. I think, he said
    provocatively, you will find a rather gruesome cafeteria at Sawdust Bridge station,
    far far away at the other end of the branch line, should you wish to make a lengthy
    and expensive railway journey before breakfast every morning. For the second time
    in as many minutes I was stumped. I decided to eat my sausage in silence, and
    it was while doing so that it occurred to me the best way to shake off my feelings
    of distress, dejection, and incandescent rage was to go for a brisk splosh.

    Which brings us neatly back to the scene on the bosky lane. There I was, stickless,
    anent a puddle. I was confident it was a suitable sploshing puddle, and not something
    in which I might drown. Burned into my brain is a map of the several bottomless
    viper pits dotted hither and thither between Loopy Copse and the godforsaken piggery
    at Mustard Parva, and by getting my bearings from a study of the time and the
    sun and the trees and the compass stored in the heel of my boot I was able to
    ascertain that the puddle could not possibly be one of the bottomless viper pits,
    filled to the brim with rainwater. It was safe to splosh.

    Curbingham has given us the most comprehensive list of the benefits of a brisk
    splosh in a puddle. I long ago committed his list to memory, and I rehearsed it
    now, as a chaffinch or something similar started chirruping in a nearby tree.
    When, eventually, I was completely "in the zone", I leapt into the puddle. But
    it was not a puddle! I landed on something solid, with a clang, and sprained my
    ankle. Sprawled in the lane, weeping with the sudden spasm of pain, I noticed,
    for the first time, a small metal plaque embedded in the earth a few inches away.
    Engraved upon it were the words Transgressive Rustic Fixture : Trompe L''oeil
    Puddle VII by Cosmo Hoxtonwanker. I had been undone by art!

    What I had thought to be a puddle was in fact a construction of glass and metal
    and light-reflecting booster technology, commissioned by the municipality, for
    which they had paid a preposterous amount of money. I learned as much from Mr
    Boggis, to whose cafe I limped back after binding my ankle with a filthy rag I
    found discarded in a real puddle a few yards down the lane. Mr Boggis, it turned
    out, was not only the proprietor of a newly sausageless cafe, but an alderman
    on the parish council and an aficionado of transgressive rustic fixture artworks.
    It was he who had hoo ha hee hop hig hub haw hee hoo ha . . . dammit. This is
    what art does to me. It sprains my ankle and turns my brain to jelly. What I need
    is a brisk splosh in a puddle. And a second sausage.'
