    This week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I revisit my explanation of the true meaning
    of the words ACRONYM and ACROSTIC. There has been a very slight bit of rewriting,
    the sort of thing that, in years to come, when I am long dead and gone, may keep
    scholars occupied, or indeed fighting with one another, as they fret and worry
    and chew their pencils over the difference between the original and the revised
    versions. To lay a trap for those future scholars, let me just note here that
    the Dabbler text includes the word filthy, which is absent from the original Hooting
    Yard text. This might be connected to the recent appearance on these pages of
    the filthy magpie. Or it might not. Of such arcana, pamphlets can be written--and
    will be!--by scribblers with nothing better to do.'
