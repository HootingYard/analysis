  text: "\nThis week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I revisit my explanation of the\
    \ true meaning of the words ACRONYM and ACROSTIC. There has been a very slight\
    \ bit of rewriting, the sort of thing that, in years to come, when I am long dead\
    \ and gone, may keep scholars occupied, or indeed fighting with one another, as\
    \ they fret and worry and chew their pencils over the difference between the original\
    \ and the revised versions. To lay a trap for those future scholars, let me just\
    \ note here that the Dabbler text includes the word filthy, which is absent from\
    \ the original Hooting Yard text. This might be connected to the recent appearance\
    \ on these pages of the filthy magpie. Or it might not. Of such arcana, pamphlets\
    \ can be written\u2014and will be!\u2014by scribblers with nothing better to do."
