  text: 'Here at Hooting Yard we hate and despise A. A. Milne and all his works. Dorothy
    Parker had it right when, in her "Constant Reader" column in the New Yorker, she
    wrote,

    And it is that word ''hummy,'' my darlings, that marks the first place in The
    House at Pooh Corner at which Tonstant Weader fwowed up.

    Nevertheless, I am delighted to learn that the "Pooh" part of the name Winnie-the-Pooh
    was originally attached to a swan, Pooh being the name Milne''s son Christopher
    Robin gave to a swan he befriended in Angmering in Suffolk. If I did not have
    more important things to do with my time, I might go through the entire awful
    canon and rewrite the stories, making Winnie-the-Pooh a savage and violent swan
    instead of an allegedly cute bear. Volume I : Winnie-the-Pooh Attacks Tim Henman
    And Breaks His Arm.'
