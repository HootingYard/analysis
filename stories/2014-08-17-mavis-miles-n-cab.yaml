  text: "Miles Davis dials Mavis\n  To blow his trumpet in her ear\n  Mavis slams\
    \ the phone down\n  And sheds a bitter tear\n  She's a little old woman who lives\
    \ in a shoe\n  And she's feeling kind of blue.\nCab Calloway calls a cab for her\n\
    \  And drives her to the future\n  Now she's no longer Mavis\n  Instead she's\
    \ Minnie the Moocher\nShe mooches and she smooches\n  Does fandangos in the aisles\n\
    \  Goodbye to that confounded shoe\n  {And thank the Lord!)\n  She didn't take\
    \ that call from Miles"
