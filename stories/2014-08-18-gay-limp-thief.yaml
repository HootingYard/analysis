  text: "[Thanks once again to R. Previous episodes in this exciting series are gathered\
    \ here.]\nSo this tangle of thieves broke into the Phosphorescent Family Compound\
    \ one night. They stole, from one larder, a bag of phosphorus, and, from another\
    \ larder another, bigger, bag of phosphorus. Then they softly and suddenly vanished\
    \ away, like Snarks.\nIn the morning, upon discovering the robbery, Old Pappy\
    \ Phosph called the coppers. With inhuman speed, Detective Captain Cargpan was\
    \ on the scene, sniffing about and writing things with a pencil in his notepad.\n\
    \u201CDon't you worry, Old Pappy,\u201D he said, \u201CI'll have these ne'er-do-wells\
    \ bang to rights and being roughed up in the police station basement by my boys\
    \ by midnight, or my name isn't Detective Captain Cargpan and I'm not sniffing\
    \ about and writing things with a pencil in my notepad.\u201D\nOld Pappy Phosph\
    \ put the kettle on for a cup of phosphorescent tea.\nThe telephone rang at one\
    \ minute past midnight.\n\u201CDetective Captain Cargpan here. That noise you\
    \ can hear in the background is my boys roughing up the thieves who stole your\
    \ bags of phosphorus last night. I'm pleased to report we've caught them. Well,\
    \ all but one of them, and he happens to be the one who knows where they stashed\
    \ their loot. So the case is not yet closed. But don't you worry, Old Pappy, with\
    \ a bit more roughing up and some bone-breaking and skull-bashing and pincers\
    \ and hammers and electric drills I think we'll find our man, and, more importantly,\
    \ your bags of phosphorus, possibly before I've finished speaking.\n\u201CThe\
    \ interesting thing about this tangle of thieves is that they might have been\
    \ cobbled together by the casting director of a BBC drama production. They are\
    \ achingly diverse in terms of ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, even social class.\
    \ It's quite an eye-opener, and has certainly raised my consciousness and \_my\
    \ inclusivity awareness.\n\u201CMore unusually, perhaps, the thieves run a gamut\
    \ of body types, not from fat to thin or tall to short, as you might expect, but\
    \ in terms of skeletal rigidity. At one end there is a bloke whose bones\u2014\
    the ones not yet broken by my boys\u2014are almost fused together, so he is completely\
    \ stiff from head to toe, while at the other end is a fellow with bones like jelly,\
    \ he is absolutely floppy.\n\u201CIn case you were wondering, the one who got\
    \ away when we raided their den under the viaduct near the wasp sanctuary is gay\
    \ and limp, so keep your eyes peeled in case you see somebody of that description.\u201D\
    \nAs he spoke, Old Pappy Phosph saw, climbing up the perimeter fence of the compound,\
    \ the gay limp thief, come to return the stolen bags of phosphorus.\nTen minutes\
    \ later, pinned to the wall of the kitchen, pierced like St Sebastian, so held\
    \ in place awaiting the arrival of Detective Captain Cargpan, the gay limp thief\
    \ confessed all to Old Pappy Phosph. He explained that his conscience was stricken\
    \ and he regretted what he had done, and so he intended to return the stolen bags\
    \ of phosphorus to their larders in hope of forgiveness.\n\u201CI don't believe\
    \ in forgiveness,\u201D said Old Pappy Phosph, driving home another phosphorescent\
    \ pin to more securely affix the thief to the wall.\n\u201COuch!\u201D said the\
    \ thief, not for the first time that night.\nThere is a moral to this story, and\
    \ it is plain and simple. Don't mess with Detective Captain Cargpan or with Old\
    \ Pappy Phosph. Both of them will have your guts for garters."
