  text: 'Hail to thee, O mighty Mr Key!, writes Tim Thurn, sarcastically, before lapsing
    into his usual embittered petulance, I''ve got a bone to pick with you. It is
    a good few years now since you revealed, without warning, the existence of the
    hideous bat-god Fatso, a god so hideous and batty and fat that I suffered from
    awful nightmares for weeks, nay, months. Eventually, with the help of several
    psychiatrists and a larder''s-worth of bottles of Dr Baxter''s Brain-Calming Syrup,
    I managed to get a grip on my life. Nowadays my sleep is relatively untroubled,
    except for those nights when I wake with a start and seem to see the hideous bat-god
    Fatso looming malevolently at the foot of my bed.

    Imagine my horror, then, to read your postage the other day entitled The Smashed
    God and to learn that there is another bat-god, called Slosher. I don''t know
    what the opposite of blessing my little cotton socks is--I leave that for your
    readers to ponder--but that is what you have done, Mr Key. Maddeningly, you provided
    no description of the bat-god Slosher, save for telling us that he is a bat-god
    and his name is Slosher. In the absence of any other detail, my mind has been
    running riot, picturing a god even more hideous, more batty, and fatter than Fatso.
    Now they visit me nightly, Fatso and Slosher, or their ghostly apparitions, one
    on either side of the bed. I swear I can hear them squeaking. I have emptied the
    chemist''s shop of bottles of Dr Baxter''s Brain-Calming Syrup, and glugged the
    lot, but my brain is by no means calm.

    What rankles is that you make passing mention of Slosher, in among all sorts of
    other, non-terrifying, gods, for all the world as if you were innocently listing
    the contents of your picnic hamper. I presume you have a picnic hamper. If not,
    I have a couple of spares, for I am--or was--a very keen picnickist. In a fit
    of wild generosity, I would almost be prepared to send you one of my extra hampers,
    empty of course, in spite of the chaos you have wrought in my brain. That is the
    kind of decent picnickist I am. Unlike you, I issue warnings. When I plan to enter
    a field to lay out my picnic blanket, I first alert any cows, sheep, grasshoppers,
    etcetera of my intentions by hoisting a placard and sounding a picnic-klaxon.
    That is what you ought to do, or the prose equivalent thereof, when you are about
    to tell us about yet another hideous bat-god, be it Fatso or Slosher or, Christ
    have mercy upon us, any others you have up your sleeve that you have not yet divulged
    to your fanatically devoted readers who treat every syllable scribbled by your
    pen as holy writ.

    There. I have said my piece for the time being. Now I am going to go and stand,
    windswept, embittered, and petulant, upon a suspension bridge, gazing into the
    distance, into a sky I hope will be innocent of bats and bat-gods.

    Yours ever, Tim Thurn

    I would like to reassure Tim that the bat-god Slosher is only ever to be spotted
    in the vicinity of the drearier and more squelchy marshes, places where he is
    unlikely to practise his picnicking.'
