  text: 'Oi!, writes Tim Thurn again, this time without even the small courtesy of
    addressing me by name, Not only do you neglect to issue warnings about bat-gods,
    but now you are making wild and unhinged assumptions about your readers, or at
    least about me. The other day you had the gall to "reassure" me regarding the
    bat-god Slosher by pointing out that he is only ever seen in the vicinity of marshes,
    "where he--[i.e., me]-- is unlikely to practise his picnicking". And what do you
    know of my picnicking proclivities, eh?

    As it happens I often go a-picnicking at a particularly dreadful and eerie marsh,
    out beyond the Blister Lane Bypass and the Grimpen Mire mosh pit. Incidentally,
    if you ever feel compelled to disport and cavort with spastic exuberance, in mud,
    I wholeheartedly recommend this mosh pit. I am told by the OED that spastic may
    cause offence, but that is not my intention. I am using the word merely to indicate
    the kind of uncoordinated flailing about with which persons commonly comport themselves
    in mosh pits--at least, the persons and mosh pits of my acquaintance, of which
    there are oodles.

    Just because I mentioned my picnic praxis of hoisting a placard and sounding a
    picnic-klaxon upon entering a field upon a picnic bent, that is not to say that
    a field is my exclusive choice of picnic spot. Far from it. There is an old "pop"
    number called something like Wherever I Lay My Hat, That''s My Home. Some years
    ago I wrote a frankly autobiographical version, retitled Wherever I Lay My Picnic
    Blanket, That''s My Picnic Spot. Over several verses I described some memorable
    past picnics in a variety of settings, including a field, the aforementioned dreadful
    and eerie marsh, a buttercup-splattered meadow, bosky hillsides, mountaintops,
    shores of lake and sea, haunts of coot and hern, multi-storey carparks, aerodrome
    hangars, the Blister Lane Bypass, the mosh pit at Grimpen Mire, Loopy Copse, the
    occasional pier and jetty, a bus shelter in Plovdiv, and the inside of my own
    head. That last one was a dream-picnic, ruined by a swarm of hornets.

    I was so pleased with my song that I cobbled together a band to perform it and
    booked time in a recording studio. Interestingly, this was the first time my glockenspielist,
    Midge Ure, had ever set foot in a studio. At least I think he said his name was
    Midge Ure, though I may have misheard him. We pressed several hundred copies of
    the "waxing", in coloured vinyl, and I still have most of them in a cardboard
    box under a spare picnic blanket in a cupboard.

    Please let me know if you would like me to write a series of lengthy guest postages
    for you. I could cover all aspects of the infinitely intriguing world o'' picnics,
    in exhaustive detail. And I can promise you now there would be no mention of Slosher!
    (fingers crossed).

    Yours picnicly, Tim Thurn'
