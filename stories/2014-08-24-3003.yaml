  text: 'It escaped my attention the other day, but the piece Fatso And Slosher was
    the three-thousandth potsage [sic] at Hooting Yard. Or rather, it was the three-thousandth
    potsage in what I still think of as "new format" Hooting Yard, beginning in January
    2007 and replacing the old format used from 2003 to 2006. This, then, is potsage
    3003.

    John Ruskin liked to number the paragraphs in some of his books--notably the mad
    autobiography Praeterita--and I ache, slightly, that I did not take the decision
    to number the potsages here way back when. (The same can be said of the Resonance104.4FM
    radio shows, of which there are now untold oodles.) Of course, I could delve into
    the innards of the archive and edit each and every potsage to give it its assigned
    Blotzmann Number, but I do not have the patience to do so, and the benefits would
    be negligible, other than to satisfy a numerical fancy.

    Q--Should numerical fancies be satisfied, all else being equal?

    A--There is no definitive answer to this question. On the one hand, Blotzmann
    applied numbers to absolutely everything, fanatically, even when there was only
    one of them, like some of the exhibits in Sir Thomas Browne''s Museum Clausum.
    On the other hand, Dobson never numbered anything, allegedly because he never
    learned to count. It was said of the out of print pamphleteer that "[he] did not
    even know how many feet he had, which is why so many spare boots were found in
    his closet".

    Had I bothered to number the potsages, an exciting activity might have been devised,
    let us call it Hooting Yard Sortilege. By plucking a tile from a pippy bag containing
    three thousand tiny bakelite tiles numbered from one to three thousand, the plucker
    would be led to a specific potsage, contemplation of which would provide guidance
    to the supplicant. What I would suggest is that those of you who wish their lives
    to be directed and governed by Hooting Yard--which I imagine is every single one
    of you--should print a paper copy of the entire archive, carry out snippage with
    scissors to separate the potsages, and number them accordingly. Then make a pile
    of them and do the pippy bag / bakelite tile business.

    While you lot are doing that, I shall proceed onwards towards the four-thousandth
    potsage, with the wind at my heels, and a look of beatific stupidity on my face.'
