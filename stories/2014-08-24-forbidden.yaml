  text: The Yazidi, a primarily Kurdish religious minority, have been much in the
    news recently, threatened with death by the rampaging nutcases of IS, or Isis.
    You can read about their current travails elsewhere. I want here simply to mention
    the somehow endearing fact--reported by the BBC's Paul Wood--that in the Yazidi
    faith it is forbidden to eat lettuce.
