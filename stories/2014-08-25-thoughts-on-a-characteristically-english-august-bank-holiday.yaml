  text: "The rain it raineth in my brain\n  And outside too, upon the mud\n  I wonder\
    \ will it ever drain\n  Or drown all life in a great flood\n  My sons are Japheth,\
    \ Ham, and Shem\n  They've not one brolly between them\n  Before nightfall, when\
    \ it grows dark\n  We had better board my ark\n  And take the animals two by two\n\
    \  We'll have ourselves a floating zoo\n  Oh look! There is an aerostat\n  Hovering\
    \ o'er Mount Ararat\n  Time's out of joint, I got befuddled\n  I'm not Noah, I'm\
    \ Key, empuddled\n  The rain it raineth in my brain\n  The rain it raineth, come\
    \ rain or rain"
