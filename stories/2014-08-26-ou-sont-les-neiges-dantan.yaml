  text: "Where are the snows of yesteryear?\n  They have been shovelled into a refrigerated\
    \ container and ferried to a remote storage facility, also refrigerated, where\
    \ they are kept in specially-designed \"snow bins\".\nHow can I gain access to\
    \ the storage facility?\n  With difficulty. As stated, it is remote.\nAssuming\
    \ for the moment that I have at my disposal a tremendous form of transport that\
    \ could zoom me to the remotest parts of the earth in a matter of minutes, in\
    \ which direction should I point it before depressing the big knob with \"Go!\"\
    \ etched upon it?\n  You do not actually have such a form of transport, do you?\n\
    Well, no, but let's just say that I did.\n  Your direction of travel would depend\
    \ upon where you are starting from.\nI am in Pointy Town.\n  There is plenty of\
    \ snow in Pointy Town. Each winter it settles on the pointiest bits of town and\
    \ remains there, cold and white and frozen, until the chirruping of little birdies\
    \ in the springtime. Why in heaven's name would you need access to the snow bins\
    \ in the remote storage facility?\nWhim.\n  Whim?\nIf whim is not a good enough\
    \ reason, then let us say I have been appointed by the burghers of Pointy Town\
    \ to compare our own snow with the snows of yesteryear, and to make my report\
    \ accordingly.\n  These burghers, are they in their right minds?\nThat is a moot\
    \ point. I know one of them suffered a bash on the bonce with a snow-shovel last\
    \ winter and has not been quite the same since. He jabbers and drools and drools\
    \ and jabbers, turn and turn about.\n  And was it this particular burgher who\
    \ commissioned you to examine the snows of yesteryear?\nYes, it was.\n  Did you\
    \ not stop to consider that any comparison you made between the snow currently\
    \ enveloping Pointy Town and the snows of yesteryear would be futile?\nThey josh\
    \ that my middle name is Futility.\n  So you are the go-to guy for fool's errands?\n\
    I live in a Paradise of Fools.\n  I thought you said you lived in Pointy Town?\
    \ Are you trying to pull the wool over my eye?\nDo you mean eyes?\n  No, eye.\
    \ I am Cyclopean.\nA Cyclopean janitor of snow bins?\n  Yes.\nAh, I read about\
    \ you in The Cyclopean Janitor of Snow Bins, a bestselling blockbuster paperback\
    \ by Pebblehead!\n  In which, I have to say, I was wholly misrepresented, so much\
    \ so that I have taken legal action with a view to having the entire run of several\
    \ million copies pulped.\nIf you succeed, what will you do with all that pulp?\n\
    \  I will shovel it into an unrefrigerated container and ferry it to a remote\
    \ storage facility, also unrefrigerated, and keep it in specially-designed \"\
    pulp bins\".\nWould that be the same remote storage facility where you keep the\
    \ snows of yesteryear?\n  No, the one is refrigerated and the other not.\nSo you\
    \ would need to be in two places at once to perform your janitorial duties?\n\
    \  No, I would employ a Cyclopean pulp bin janitor.\nIf I pluck out one of mine\
    \ eyes, could I have the job?\n  There is a waiting list of applicants.\nHow could\
    \ I shove myself to the front of that list?\n  With sharp elbows.\nConsider them\
    \ sharpened!\n  Welcome aboard."
