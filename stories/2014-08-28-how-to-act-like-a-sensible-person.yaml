  text: 'Over in the right-hand column, below the pictures of the Hooting Yard book
    covers, there languishes a little orange button inscribed with the words "Make
    a donation". Below this is another little chunk of text inviting you to subscribe,
    which basically means you automatically make a donation every month. Over the
    years, both the button and the text have tempted the occasional reader, and I
    am very grateful for their support. (They know who they are.)

    Today I was reading David Thompson''s excellent blog and I felt impelled, after
    a smidgeon of judicious editing, to copy and paste a passage from a recent postage:

    Patrons are reminded that this rickety barge is kept afloat, just about, by the
    kindness of strangers. If you''ve been remotely entertained over the years and
    would like to help this dubious endeavour remain buoyant a while longer, there''s
    an orange button below with which to monetise any love. Debit and credit cards
    are of course accepted. Think of it as a magazine subscription.

    This is a very sensible piece of prose, and I urge you to act on it. Make a one-off
    donation by clicking the button below, or a regular monthly donation by heading
    over to that paragraph on the right.


    NOTA BENE : For the avoidance of any doubt, following the guidance above will
    of course result in donations to Hooting Yard. If, in addition, or instead, you
    wish to donate to David Thompson, go here.'
