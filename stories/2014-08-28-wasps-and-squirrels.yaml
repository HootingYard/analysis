  text: 'Hooting Yard''s anagrammatist-in-residence, R., has alerted me to a non-anagrammatical
    matter of some importance. Winchester woman finds 3ft wasp nest on bed, says a
    report on the BBC news page. As R. remarks, it is "disappointing that it''s the
    extent of the nest, rather than the magnitude of a particular wasp, to which this
    headline refers". I have read and reread the story, in the faint hope that R.
    misunderstood it and that there really is--or was--a 3ft wasp at large in Hampshire.
    It would make a terrific short story, wouldn''t it? As Mrs Gubbins awoke one morning
    from uneasy dreams she found herself transformed in her bed into a gigantic wasp.
    Or has somebody already written something similar?

    Elsewhere at the BBC, I heard--in the woozy world between sleep and wakefulness--something
    about squirrels with leprosy. This was a report on Farming Today on Radio 4, a
    show I have come to think of as Girly Farming Club. The BBC seems forever to be
    wringing its hands at the under-representation of women, but Farming Today is
    produced and presented by an exclusively female team. Regrettably, however, not
    one of them sounds remotely like a proper peasant.'
