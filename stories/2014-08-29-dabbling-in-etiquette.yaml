    This week in my cupboard at The Dabbler I offer some handy tips on etiquette.
    Those of you likely to encounter, over the weekend, black-hearted Prince Fulgencio
    and/or grunting farmyard pigs will find this advice particularly helpful. As far
    as I know I do not have an appointment with the prince, nor with any pigs, but
    I ought to check my day-book to make absolutely sure.

    My day-book, by the way, has a yellow cover, like a fin de siecle symbolist publication,
    whereas the cover of my night-book is as black as the black, black heart of Prince
    Fulgencio. Indeed, the precise shade of black was created by replicating, to the
    nth degree, the blackness at the heart of the prince''s black heart, as depicted
    in the official mezzotints.

    A dumb bear loomed over the shoulder of the mezzotintist as he worked, as dumb
    bears do in certain tales, ones you have probably forgotten, for you did not pay
    proper attention when sat at your mother''s knee as she read to you, about dumb
    bears and mezzotintists and the black, black heart of Prince Fulgencio, from those
    dog-eared storybooks, so many years ago. All the illustrations in the book had
    been torn out and used as makeshift wallpaper for the bomb shelter.

    Oh! it was the loveliest of bomb shelters, lovely and subterranean, and before
    the wallpaper was pasted up the walls clanged when you rapped them with your tiny
    fists. Since then, worms have eaten their way through the walls, huge wriggling
    toxic albino worms like something from a nightmare. It is said by some that such
    worms gnawed their way into Prince Fulgencio''s black heart, while he yet lived,
    and that was what made him so terrible and terrifying a prince. But that did not
    stand up in court, nor in the star chamber.

    I keep my night-book in my star chamber, and my day-book in the pantry. Oh! It
    is the loveliest of pantries, lovely and subterranean and filled with jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after jar after
    jar after jar after jar after jar after jar and a jelly jug for jugged jelly.
