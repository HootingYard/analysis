  text: 'Slaloming from my chalet down to the post office, I stopped short when I
    saw, at the edge of a crevasse, a monkey encased in a block of ice. I am no expert
    on monkeys, and I was not sure what kind of monkey it was. It was between a quarter
    and a third of the size of an average human, if such a thing exists. I made a
    note with a propelling pencil in my jotting pad to remind me of the precise location,
    then carried on down to the post office at the foot of the mountain. I transacted
    my business--at this distance in time I cannot remember what it was--and made
    my way to the funicular railway station, stopping off to buy a pastry snack and
    a bag of plums.

    I told the conductor that I wanted to alight before my usual, chalet level, stop.
    He raised one eyebrow and gave me a quizzical look, but dinted my ticket with
    his metal ticket dinter without further comment. The windows of the carriage were
    steamed up, so I could not see a thing outside. I lit my pipe, and we began to
    creak slowly upwards.

    I got off when the conductor gave me the nod, and trudged over to the crevasse.
    In my absence, the block of ice had not thawed one iota. If anything it had frozen
    to even more adamantine solidity, not surprising given the foul weather. The sun
    had been obscured by clouds and mist and bad air for three or four days on the
    trot. I tapped my bemittened knuckle on the ice, but of course the monkey inside
    did not stir. How could it? It too was frozen solid.

    My first thought had been to melt the ice in situ, releasing the monkey dangerously
    close to the crevasse. If, upon regaining consciousness, it bounded off in the
    direction of the gaping chasm and looked as if it might plunge to its death, I
    hoped to forestall such a calamity by tempting it with plums, or pastry. But while
    aboard the funicular railway, I had become peckish, extinguished my pipe, and
    eaten half the plums and the entire pastry. I had to rethink my plans. It would
    make far more sense to haul the block of ice up to my chalet, and to melt it there.
    This would have the advantage that I could immediately put the frozen monkey in
    a place of comfort--my sofa or my bed--so that when it eventually awoke it would
    be less likely to panic and plunge down a crevasse.

    The problem now was how to transport the block of ice up the unforgiving mountainside.
    Monkeys, I knew, were banned from the funicular railway, and with good reason.
    I was barely strong enough to clamber uphill unencumbered, let alone shoving,
    Sisyphean fashion, a block of ice containing a monkey ahead of me. For one wild
    moment I envisioned a helicopter swooping down, rope dangling, to ferry my cargo
    to the chalet. But of course the mountain, and its hinterland for miles in every
    direction, were a no fly zone according to Directive No. 17. What I had always
    found puzzling, incidentally, was the impossibility of finding out what on earth
    Directives Nos. 1 to 16 were. Nobody seemed to know, or at least nobody was willing
    to tell.

    Then I remembered that I had, in my cupboard in the chalet, a very lengthy length
    of sturdy chain. It should be possible to affix one end of this to the block of
    ice, and to devise a contraption which, with minimal effort from me, for example
    dainty movements of my little fingers, would drag the block of ice up to my chalet.
    Satisfied, I lit my pipe and waited for the funicular railway to resume my journey
    up and home.

    While I waited I peered at the monkey inside the ice, or as much of it as I could
    see, which in truth was very little. Sometimes ice is crystal clear, but this
    block was somewhat more opaque. It gave the monkey a blurred quality, as if viewed
    by a catastrophically myopic person, or seen in a dream. I had often dreamed of
    such monkeys, blurry, ill-defined, and ominously still. It had never occurred
    to me to wonder what these dreams might "mean", as if they could possibly mean
    anything! Stalin has always seemed to me a far better guide than Freud. That is
    why I have a hammer-and-sickle emblem nailed to the door of my chalet, to announce
    my stance to any visitors, thus averting the risk of futile conversations.

    And the funicular railway carriage arrived on schedule and I clambered aboard
    and I smoked my pipe and ate the remainder of the plums and I alighted at my usual
    stop and I went home and I devised a contraption to drag the block of ice up the
    mountain slope and I fetched the chain from the cupboard and I fixed one end of
    it to the bracket on the contraption and gave it a hefty tug to ensure it was
    secure and I started to make my way slaloming back down the mountain paying out
    the chain behind me until I came to the block of ice with the monkey inside it
    and I wrapped the chain round and round the ice and gave it a hefty tug to ensure
    it was secure and I returned to the funicular railway stop to wait for the carriage
    to take me back uphill and then I began to feel peckish again and instead of going
    home I slalomed down to the village and bought another pastry and another bag
    of plums and I sat on a stone bench next to a statue of Stalin and scoffed the
    pastry and the plums and when I was replete I fell into a doze right there on
    the bench and I dreamed of a monkey, blurry, ill-defined, and ominously still.

    I can hardly believe that fifty years have passed since that day.
