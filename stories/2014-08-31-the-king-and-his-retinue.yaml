  text: "Here comes the King, clopping along on his horse. His retinue, today, includes\
    \ an Elk, Peacock, Shark, Butterfly, Lion, Tiger, Rabbit, Book, Coat, Boot, Hare,\
    \ Rake, Barrel, Caterpillar, Pigeon, Yard Stick, Snail, Match, Turtle, Owl, Rhinoceros,\
    \ Antelope, Watch, Skull, Cat, Cow, Giraffe, Priest, Mummy, Humpty Dumpty, Squirrel,\
    \ 5 Fishes, 2 Indians, 12 Faces, 3 Mice, 11 Dogs, 3 Eagles, 5 Letters, 5 Ducks,\
    \ 2 Camels, 3 Elephants, 7 Men, 2 Monkeys, 2 Cymbals, 4 Birds, 4 Bears, 4 Goats,\
    \ 8 Frogs, 2 Seals, 3 Beavers, 9 Sheep, 3 Ladies, 5 Horses, 5 Pigs, 2 Chickens,\
    \ 4 Alligators, 2 Boys, 2 Babies, 2 Combs. It is a curious retinue, but then he\
    \ is a curious King. His father said as much, when the King was yet a Prince.\n\
    \u201CThe Prince,\u201D said the old King to his wife, the Queen, languishing\
    \ at death's door as usual, \u201CIs a very curious young man. There is for one\
    \ thing the business with the buttons. There is for another thing the shape of\
    \ the head. I fear he will become a curious King when his time comes.\u201D\n\
    The Queen groaned and asked the King to summon the nurse to replace her mustard\
    \ plaster.\nThe King, then Prince, was six when these words were spoken. Now he\
    \ is sixty-six. He has been the King for over half a century. It is almost as\
    \ long ago that he put the business with the buttons behind him. The shape of\
    \ the head, being physiological rather than whimsy, was not so easily discarded.\
    \ And yet, over the long years, the shape of the head had changed, slowly gradually\
    \ glacially, as it moulded itself better to fit the crown atop it. The crown had\
    \ been struck for and first worn by the King's great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather,\
    \ though we ought not try to be too precise about the number of greats. History\
    \ can be treacherous the farther back we delve.\nAhead of the King now, as he\
    \ clops on his horse, are the motorcycle outriders. There is a significant number\
    \ of them also at the rear of the retinue, just behind the 2 Babies and 2 Combs.\
    \ The motorcycle engines purr, their purr a constant below the rhythmic clopping.\
    \ The King's tape-recordist skitters now ahead, now behind, now in the midst of\
    \ the retinue, never satisfied that he has found quite the perfect spot to immortalise\
    \ the sound of the King's progress through his island. Today's recording, however\
    \ imperfect, will fill the airwaves of the radio station for the next week or\
    \ more. The King's subjects will listen, rapt, as they go about their grind.\n\
    Today's sniper is stationed, foolishly and predictably, at the sixth-floor window\
    \ of one of the replicas of the Texas Schoolbook Depository building in Dallas.\
    \ These clapboard but highly accurate constructions have been placed at intervals\
    \ along the King's route, specifically to lure and entrap foolish and predictable\
    \ would-be assassins. Sure enough, with minutes to spare before the King and his\
    \ retinue hove into the sniper's sights, a SWAT team takes him out with extreme\
    \ prejudice. The SWAT team have been awaiting the signal from their base in a\
    \ replica LZ 129 Hindenburg airship hovering high in the clouds above the replica\
    \ Schoolbook Depository.\nThere is always the possibility that the King may be\
    \ threatened by a sniper who is both intelligent and unpredictable, and there\
    \ is a Plan B to deal with such a situation. I hope I am not giving too much away\
    \ by revealing that the 2 Monkeys, 4 Bears, and six of the 9 Sheep in the retinue\
    \ are not quite what they seem.\nThe King himself is not even aware of Plan B.\
    \ It was thought best not to tell him. He has never really regained his wits since\
    \ a sniper's bullet felled his father, the old King, over half a century ago.\
    \ Hence his relentless criss-crossing of his island kingdom, astride his clopping\
    \ horse, with his curious retinue, to no apparent purpose, and with no apparent\
    \ end."
