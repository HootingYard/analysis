  text: "I am sniffy about science fiction. The genre does not appeal to me. Over\
    \ the years I have read several sci-fi books\u2014or SF, or speculative fiction,\
    \ or whatever the preferred term is these days\u2014and though I have enjoyed\
    \ some of them, mildly, I feel no great urge to read more widely in the field.\
    \ Similarly with the cinema\u2014there are a few sci-fi films I like, but in general\
    \ I will actively avoid them. I have never, for example, seen Star Wars, nor any\
    \ of its seemingly inordinate sequels and prequels. Despite not having seen it,\
    \ I tend to agree with the critic who suggested that its success destroyed American\
    \ cinema. The vast majority of films churned out by Hollywood are pap, and pap\
    \ of a certain kind, for which George Lucas is to be held personally responsible.\n\
    In addition to being sniffy about sci-fi, I am also diabetic. Until recently,\
    \ these two parts of my life could coexist without hoo-hah. I have to jab myself\
    \ with insulin daily, as a direct result of the debaucheries of my Wilderness\
    \ Years. I do not find this particularly onerous, and if anything it acts as a\
    \ useful reminder not to revisit those chaotic stupidities.\nBut a few weeks ago,\
    \ after seeing a consultant whose resemblance to Brian Eno is so eerily close\
    \ that I would swear Brain One is moonlighting as an NHS doctor, my regimen was\
    \ changed. Instead of injecting one type of insulin (Novomix), Brian recommended\
    \ my diabetes would be better managed by using two different preparations. It\
    \ is the names of these that make me feel, daily, like a collaborator in some\
    \ awful sci-fi adventure.\nI do not know who is responsible for the nomenclature\
    \ of insulin solutions. Whomsoever it is clearly gave no thought to the psychic\
    \ damage wrought upon my tattered nerves by forcing me to inject Humalog and the\
    \ even more sci-fi-sounding Lantus Solostar.\nIn hindsight, Novomix itself sounds\
    \ like the name of a distant star in a galaxy far far away. One imagines it as\
    \ the setting where dashing space hero Lantus Solostar does battle with the bumbling\
    \ robots known as Humalogs.\nGod give me strength.\n\nLantus Solostar"
