  text: 'The other day I met a man who has devoted the past several years to a singular
    literary project. His aim is to produce a bowdlerised version of the complete
    works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which all reference to the spine-tingling and the
    spooky, the eldritch and the uncanny, is expunged. I was able immediately to grasp
    the value of this scheme. Lovecraft is a fascinating writer, but there must be
    many potential readers who are deterred from his work because, quite frankly,
    they do not wish to get the collywobbles. Excise the spine-tingling and the spooky,
    the eldritch and the uncanny, and an entire new constituency of fans will be created.

    I asked my new friend how he went about the creation of an expurgated Lovecraft.
    He explained that he began by simply deleting all the terrifying adjectives, adverbs,
    verbs and nouns. This had the unintended consequence of rendering much of Lovecraft''s
    prose "bitty and near-incomprehensible", as he put it. Whole passages were reduced
    to strings of prepositions. Though commendably brief, the resulting text lacked
    heft. So then, he said proudly, his real work began. He realised that he could
    reinstate a certain amount of readability, and up the word-count, by replacing,
    for example, Shoggoth with a pretty vase of flowers, or hideous tentacles with
    gambolling bunny rabbits. I pointed out to him that some people--not least myself--found
    rabbits utterly frightening, and he promised to look again at his revisions.

    Then he bid me farewell, and I sat alone at the cafe table, mercilessly correlating
    all the contents of my mind.'
