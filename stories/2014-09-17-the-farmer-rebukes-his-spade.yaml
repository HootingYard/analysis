  text: 'The Farmer Rebukes His Spade is the title of a painting by Cedric Farmpainter,
    RA. It has been described as his first great daub and as the jewel of the Pointy
    Town Municipal Galeria. The work itself was destroyed in an inexplicable bird-related
    cataclysm, and today exists only in the form of a mezzotint copy by the noted
    mezzotintist Rex Tint. Tint always claimed that he made his print by sitting in
    front of the original painting, gazing at it for hours, working steadily, but
    his account has been called into question by his own sister, Dot Tint. In her
    memoir of her brother, she wrote that he cannot have sat where he said he sat,
    having been barred from entering the Galeria or its grounds or appurtenances by
    dint of "insufferable pomposity".

    At this distance in time, we can never know which Tint, Rex or Dot, is telling
    the truth. All we have is the mezzotint itself, several thousand copies of which
    were printed and distributed by Rex Tint''s devoted and possibly insane patron,
    Walter Mad.

    The Farmer Rebukes His Spade is a rustic scene. It shows a dreary and rainsoaked
    field, pitted with many a puddle. To the left, there is a tree, which may be a
    larch or box or plane or sycamore, against the trunk of which is leaning a spade,
    at an angle of forty-two degrees (it has been measured, precisely, by swivel-eyed
    enthusiasts). Next to the tree and the spade, in side profile, is the figure of
    a farmer, florid of face and fat of belly. One arm is raised, and one finger of
    one puffy hand is in mid-wag. The farmer appears to be shouting his head off in
    what one critic has described as "an unbridled and unhinged spewing forth of rancour
    and remonstrance". In the top left corner, silhouetted against the bleak sky,
    there is a bird, almost certainly a small bittern which, as other sources confirm,
    was the favourite bird of both Rex Tint and Cedric Farmpainter. (See "Painters
    and mezzotintists wax elegiac about their favourite birds", The Journal Of Mezzotint-
    And Painting-Related Ornithology, Vol XXVII, No. 8, August 1909.)

    My own copy of the mezzotint was unfortunately destroyed in the course of a sophisticated
    cocktail party which got out of hand and swiftly descended into an unsophisticated
    cocktail party and pitched battle.'
