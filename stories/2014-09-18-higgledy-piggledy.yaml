  text: "The OED defines higgledy-piggledy as \u201Cwithout any order of position\
    \ or direction; in huddled or jumbled confusion and disorder; with heads and tails\
    \ in any or every direction. Usually contemptuous.\u201D An early citation, from\
    \ A new dictionary of the terms ancient and modern of the canting crew (1699)\
    \ makes explicit the reference to \u201Cheads and tails\u201D, defining the word\
    \ as \u201Call together, as Hoggs and Pigges lie\u201D. This pig-based etymology\
    \ seems to me to be thoroughly erroneous.\nMy own exhaustive and exhausting research\
    \ has exhumed from historical obscurity, you know what?, it has been so damnably\
    \ exhausting that I am going to have to break off here to take a nap. Assume several\
    \ paragraphs of zzzzzzzzzzs.\nThat's better. I am refreshed, and as if the nap\
    \ were not enough I have also glugged a teaspoon's-worth of Dr Baxter's Frenetic\
    \ Brain Activity Enhancement Cordial. So let us resume. My own exhaustive and\
    \ exhausting research has exhumed from historical obscurity Monsignor Higledi\
    \ and Doctor Pigledie, the one a priest and the other a physician. The spellings\
    \ of their names are in accord with the OED's earliest citation, from John Florio's\
    \ A worlde of wordes, or most copious, and exact dictionarie in Italian and English\
    \ of 1598.\nIn 1492, or thereabouts, the monsignor and the doctor were commissioned,\
    \ by Bruno La Poubelle, to take charge of the Keep Pointy Town Neat And Tidy campaign.\
    \ This may seem anachronistically modern, in both its intention and its phraseology,\
    \ but Bruno La Poubelle was ever a figure who transcended the petty bonds of time.\
    \ Witness, for example, the well-known portrait of him, etched by noted etcher\
    \ Rex Van Etch, in which he is clearly depicted wearing flying goggles and a Spandau\
    \ Ballet tee-shirt.\nA visionary he may have been, but Bruno La Poubelle made\
    \ a terrible error of judgement in picking Higledi and Pigledie. The one was a\
    \ butterfingers and the other was passing strange in a way we would today probably\
    \ diagnose as clinical insanity. Which was which, monsignor or physician, I have\
    \ not yet been able to ascertain from the documents. What they do make horribly\
    \ vivid, however, is that no pair of fifteenth-century Pointy Towners could have\
    \ been less able to make, let alone keep, things neat and tidy. Wherever they\
    \ went, in those ancient boulevards, attempting to align things neatly and clear\
    \ away clutter and chaos, they only made things worse. By the time Bruno La Poubelle\
    \ put a stop to their activities, all of Pointy Town was a jumble of confusion,\
    \ with even well-defined pathways crumbled and leading in jagged zigzags towards\
    \ nothingness, or haystacks from the hinterland to be found plopped upside down\
    \ in the middle of the town square, or horses behind the counters of pickle shops.\
    \ There is a measure of truth in the observation that, more than five hundred\
    \ years later, Pointy Town has never quite recovered. That is why, as soon as\
    \ you enter the town, even today, you become lost, lost, oh hopelessly lost.\n\
    Pigs have nothing to do with it.\n\nIf you have enjoyed this folderol, please\
    \ consider making a donation to the Hooting Yard Fund for Distressed Out-of-Print\
    \ Pamphleteers.\n"
