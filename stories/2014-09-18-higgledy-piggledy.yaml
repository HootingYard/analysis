  text: 'The OED defines higgledy-piggledy as "without any order of position or direction;
    in huddled or jumbled confusion and disorder; with heads and tails in any or every
    direction. Usually contemptuous." An early citation, from A new dictionary of
    the terms ancient and modern of the canting crew (1699) makes explicit the reference
    to "heads and tails", defining the word as "all together, as Hoggs and Pigges
    lie". This pig-based etymology seems to me to be thoroughly erroneous.

    My own exhaustive and exhausting research has exhumed from historical obscurity,
    you know what?, it has been so damnably exhausting that I am going to have to
    break off here to take a nap. Assume several paragraphs of zzzzzzzzzzs.

    That''s better. I am refreshed, and as if the nap were not enough I have also
    glugged a teaspoon''s-worth of Dr Baxter''s Frenetic Brain Activity Enhancement
    Cordial. So let us resume. My own exhaustive and exhausting research has exhumed
    from historical obscurity Monsignor Higledi and Doctor Pigledie, the one a priest
    and the other a physician. The spellings of their names are in accord with the
    OED''s earliest citation, from John Florio''s A worlde of wordes, or most copious,
    and exact dictionarie in Italian and English of 1598.

    In 1492, or thereabouts, the monsignor and the doctor were commissioned, by Bruno
    La Poubelle, to take charge of the Keep Pointy Town Neat And Tidy campaign. This
    may seem anachronistically modern, in both its intention and its phraseology,
    but Bruno La Poubelle was ever a figure who transcended the petty bonds of time.
    Witness, for example, the well-known portrait of him, etched by noted etcher Rex
    Van Etch, in which he is clearly depicted wearing flying goggles and a Spandau
    Ballet tee-shirt.

    A visionary he may have been, but Bruno La Poubelle made a terrible error of judgement
    in picking Higledi and Pigledie. The one was a butterfingers and the other was
    passing strange in a way we would today probably diagnose as clinical insanity.
    Which was which, monsignor or physician, I have not yet been able to ascertain
    from the documents. What they do make horribly vivid, however, is that no pair
    of fifteenth-century Pointy Towners could have been less able to make, let alone
    keep, things neat and tidy. Wherever they went, in those ancient boulevards, attempting
    to align things neatly and clear away clutter and chaos, they only made things
    worse. By the time Bruno La Poubelle put a stop to their activities, all of Pointy
    Town was a jumble of confusion, with even well-defined pathways crumbled and leading
    in jagged zigzags towards nothingness, or haystacks from the hinterland to be
    found plopped upside down in the middle of the town square, or horses behind the
    counters of pickle shops. There is a measure of truth in the observation that,
    more than five hundred years later, Pointy Town has never quite recovered. That
    is why, as soon as you enter the town, even today, you become lost, lost, oh hopelessly
    lost.

    Pigs have nothing to do with it.
