  text: 'The Guardian today published a short story by Hilary Mantel entitled The
    Assassination Of Margaret Thatcher. This piece apparently took Ms Mantel thirty
    years to write, for "technical reasons"--"I just couldn''t see how to get [the
    characters] to work together". The inference is that she has at last solved the
    problem, but it seems to me that the characters--an assassin and the woman whose
    flat he uses to set up his sniper''s nest--neither work together nor individually.

    I have always found Mantel a curiously lifeless writer. The popularity of her
    prize-winning Thomas Cromwell books is a profound mystery, and Beyond Black was
    spectacularly turgid. In the present story she makes full use of her gift for
    clunking, tin-eared dialogue.

    Most amusing is the revelation that the original title of the forthcoming collection
    of stories for which The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher acts as a trailer
    was Ten Transgressive Tales. Ooh! Transgressive! What could be less transgressive
    than an infantile fantasy about murdering a Tory prime minister published in the
    pages of the Guardian?

    For the next thirty years I intend to work on a story entitled The Assassination
    of Hilary Mantel. The technical challenge, to drain all life from my prose, will
    be huge, but hey!, think how transgressive and shocking it will be.

    NOTA BENE : For something genuinely transgressive, see my forthcoming book Tony
    Benn Was A Complete Wanker.'
