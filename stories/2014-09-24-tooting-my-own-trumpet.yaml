  text: "This is the Age of Unbridled Narcissism, but Mr Key is of course a diffident\
    \ and unassuming fellow. However, I would like to draw to your attention the programme\
    \ for Devour! The Food Film Fest, to be held in Wolfville, Nova Scotia in November.\
    \ Among the films to be shown is Sharon Smith's splendid adaptation of A Recipe\
    \ For Gruel, described thus:\nAnimated and described cleverly by the best British\
    \ voice you have ever heard, A Recipe for Gruel will charm and inform, but mostly\
    \ charm.\nEr \u2026 to be precise, it was animated by Sharon (aka Miss HatHorn)\
    \ and narrated by Mr Key, but I am flattered by such praise. In case you have\
    \ no idea what the Nova Scotians are talking about, you can listen to untold hours\
    \ of that voice babbling away at the Hooting Yard On The Air archives at Resonance104.4FM.\n\
    When it has done the rounds of the film festivals, food-related and otherwise,\
    \ A Recipe For Gruel will be available to watch online. I shall keep you informed."
