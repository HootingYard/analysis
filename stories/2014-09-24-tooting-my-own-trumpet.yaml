  text: 'This is the Age of Unbridled Narcissism, but Mr Key is of course a diffident
    and unassuming fellow. However, I would like to draw to your attention the programme
    for Devour! The Food Film Fest, to be held in Wolfville, Nova Scotia in November.
    Among the films to be shown is Sharon Smith''s splendid adaptation of A Recipe
    For Gruel, described thus:

    Animated and described cleverly by the best British voice you have ever heard,
    A Recipe for Gruel will charm and inform, but mostly charm.

    Er ... to be precise, it was animated by Sharon (aka Miss HatHorn) and narrated
    by Mr Key, but I am flattered by such praise. In case you have no idea what the
    Nova Scotians are talking about, you can listen to untold hours of that voice
    babbling away at the Hooting Yard On The Air archives at Resonance104.4FM.

    When it has done the rounds of the film festivals, food-related and otherwise,
    A Recipe For Gruel will be available to watch online. I shall keep you informed.'
