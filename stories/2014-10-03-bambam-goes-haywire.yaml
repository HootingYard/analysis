  text: 'On Thursday morning, BamBam went haywire. That is all I am prepared to say
    on the subject. You may have questions, such as who or what is BamBam?, what is
    the etymology of the word haywire?, and so on, but quite frankly it is not up
    to me to spoonfeed you. I fail to see why you should not do your own research
    into these matters, thus freeing me for more important tasks, such as taking a
    well-earned nap, smoking a gasper while gazing out of the window, or stuffing
    my gob with a pile of Smokers'' Poptarts. Any of those choices would be a better
    use of my time than telling you about BamBam going haywire.

    Oh please please Mr Key!, I hear you wail, Do tell us more! To which I reply,
    certainly not. At most, I might give you some pointers to help you conduct your
    own research. For the etymology of the word haywire, I can think of no better
    reference source than the Oxford English Dictionary. Oh, wait, I can think of
    a better source--Dobson''s pamphlet Everything You Ought To Know About Hay, And
    Words Beginning With Hay- (out of print). In fact I am surprised not to have recommended
    this pamphlet to you before. It is the most haycentric of all Dobson''s works,
    and its first edition, of ten Gestetnered copies, actually had a cover to which
    strands of real hay were affixed, with glue. This had the unfortunate effect of
    partly obscuring the title, with the result that the pamphlet sold even fewer
    copies than was usually the case.

    If you do your research thoroughly, you will probably be exhausted by the time
    you are fully conversant with the word haywire. Your head will be so crammed with
    new and exciting information that there will be no room left to add anything at
    all. That being so, it seems rather pointless for me to tell you where you could
    discover further information about BamBam. Nevertheless, there will always be
    two or three scallywags who don''t know when to stop, who will plough on regardless.
    Such persons are very exasperating, like hyperactive tots, and should not be encouraged.
    I find the best way to deal with them is to administer a dose of Ox-Stun, a proprietary
    tranquiliser more commonly used to stun oxen, at such times as one needs to stun
    oxen, which, depending on circumstances, can be every Thursday morning or once
    in a blue moon.

    Now, everybody sing along : Blue moon, You saw me standing alone Without a dream
    in my heart Without a love of my own...'
