  text: "On Thursday morning, BamBam went haywire. That is all I am prepared to say\
    \ on the subject. You may have questions, such as who or what is BamBam?, what\
    \ is the etymology of the word haywire?, and so on, but quite frankly it is not\
    \ up to me to spoonfeed you. I fail to see why you should not do your own research\
    \ into these matters, thus freeing me for more important tasks, such as taking\
    \ a well-earned nap, smoking a gasper while gazing out of the window, or stuffing\
    \ my gob with a pile of Smokers\u2019 Poptarts. Any of those choices would be\
    \ a better use of my time than telling you about BamBam going haywire.\nOh please\
    \ please Mr Key!, I hear you wail, Do tell us more! To which I reply, certainly\
    \ not. At most, I might give you some pointers to help you conduct your own research.\
    \ For the etymology of the word haywire, I can think of no better reference source\
    \ than the Oxford English Dictionary. Oh, wait, I can think of a better source\u2014\
    Dobson's pamphlet Everything You Ought To Know About Hay, And Words Beginning\
    \ With Hay- (out of print). In fact I am surprised not to have recommended this\
    \ pamphlet to you before. It is the most haycentric of all Dobson's works, and\
    \ its first edition, of ten Gestetnered copies, actually had a cover to which\
    \ strands of real hay were affixed, with glue. This had the unfortunate effect\
    \ of partly obscuring the title, with the result that the pamphlet sold even fewer\
    \ copies than was usually the case.\nIf you do your research thoroughly, you will\
    \ probably be exhausted by the time you are fully conversant with the word haywire.\
    \ Your head will be so crammed with new and exciting information that there will\
    \ be no room left to add anything at all. That being so, it seems rather pointless\
    \ for me to tell you where you could discover further information about BamBam.\
    \ Nevertheless, there will always be two or three scallywags who don't know when\
    \ to stop, who will plough on regardless. Such persons are very exasperating,\
    \ like hyperactive tots, and should not be encouraged. I find the best way to\
    \ deal with them is to administer a dose of Ox-Stun, a proprietary tranquiliser\
    \ more commonly used to stun oxen, at such times as one needs to stun oxen, which,\
    \ depending on circumstances, can be every Thursday morning or once in a blue\
    \ moon.\nNow, everybody sing along\_: Blue moon, You saw me standing alone Without\
    \ a dream in my heart Without a love of my own\u2026"
