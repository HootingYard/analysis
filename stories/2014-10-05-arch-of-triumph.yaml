  text: 'During my long life, one thing I have learned is that whenever one experiences
    a triumph, it is a capital idea to erect an arch in commemoration. Thus, to give
    but one example, when I had a playground spat with a ruffian child, as a mere
    child myself, and I came out on top by bashing the little git on the head with
    a shovel, I proceeded to build an arch, out of cement and straw and pipe-cleaners,
    which I put up in a corner of the playground, so that none would ever forget that
    on that spot, on a hot May morn, I triumphed over Perkins, or whatever his name
    was.

    Well, I am being disingenuous. Of course his name was Perkins, I remember it well,
    for I built the arch of triumph specifically to commemorate my victory. It was
    to be the first of many arches of triumph in my life. As it happened, Perkins
    prompted a second arch, many years later, when the pair of us, long estranged,
    met up by chance one winter''s day. I had no idea who he was, but he recognised
    me, probably because I was wearing the insignia of Goosehaven. He began to berate
    me with words, and then with fists, until I grabbed hold of a nearby shovel and
    bashed him on the head with it, again, and he crumpled. The second Perkinsesque
    Arch of Triumph was constructed from concrete and brick and pebbles and the saliva
    of otters. It stands next to a river, in the vicinity of Goosehaven itself.

    I am often asked whether I like to pass underneath my arches of triumph, either
    on foot or borne by a suitably resplendent carriage. My answer, invariably, is
    long-winded and pompous and orotund, and I leave my listeners in some doubt as
    to whether I was saying, in essence, "yes" or "no". This is a quite deliberate
    ruse on my part. I do not wish to be tied down to certainties. They are such a
    bore.

    The one certainty I will avow is that I am a man of Goosehaven, born and bred.
    A surprising number of people find this either exasperating or objectionable,
    or both, and do not stint in letting me know their feelings. My usual response
    is to bash such persons on the head with a shovel and then to erect upon the spot
    an arch of triumph. It keeps me busy, which is a boon, for we all know that the
    devil finds work for idle hands to do, or at least so I was told, at my mother''s
    knee, when I was a tot, in the Goosehaven of yore, long ago buried under car parks
    and supermarkets and so-called retail ''n'' leisure complexes. There are ghosts
    there now, parading in their thousands, borne on resplendent phantom carriages,
    passing under my arches of triumph.'
