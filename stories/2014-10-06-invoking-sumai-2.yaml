  text: "Here is an example of the way in which invoking Sumai can liven up the most\
    \ tedious of evenings.\nA country road. A tree. Evening.\nEstragon, sitting on\
    \ a low mound, is trying to take off his boot. He pulls at it with both hands,\
    \ panting. He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again.\nAs before.\nEnter Vladimir.\n\
    ESTRAGON: (giving up again) Nothing to be done.\nVLADIMIR: (advancing with short,\
    \ stiff strides, legs wide apart) I'm beginning to come round to that opinion.\
    \ All my life I've tried to put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you\
    \ haven't yet tried everything.\nESTRAGON\_: (interrupting) I invoke Sumai!\n\
    Enter a big band orchestra, crooners, chorus girls, dancers, acrobats, jugglers,\
    \ clowns, etc, who proceed to put on some tiptop variety entertainment for the\
    \ next two hours.\nCurtain"
