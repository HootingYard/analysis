text: "Here is an example of the way in which invoking Sumai can liven up the most\
  \ tedious of evenings.\nA country road. A tree. Evening.\nEstragon, sitting on a\
  \ low mound, is trying to take off his boot. He pulls at it with both hands, panting.\
  \ He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again.\nAs before.\nEnter Vladimir.\nESTRAGON:\
  \ (giving up again) Nothing to be done.\nVLADIMIR: (advancing with short, stiff\
  \ strides, legs wide apart) I'm beginning to come round to that opinion. All my\
  \ life I've tried to put it from me, saying Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't\
  \ yet tried everything.\nESTRAGON\_: (interrupting) I invoke Sumai!\nEnter a big\
  \ band orchestra, crooners, chorus girls, dancers, acrobats, jugglers, clowns, etc,\
  \ who proceed to put on some tiptop variety entertainment for the next two hours.\n\
