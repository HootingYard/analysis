  text: 'Here is an example of the way in which invoking Sumai can liven up the most
    tedious of evenings.

    A country road. A tree. Evening.

    Estragon, sitting on a low mound, is trying to take off his boot. He pulls at
    it with both hands, panting. He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again.

    As before.

    Enter Vladimir.

    ESTRAGON: (giving up again) Nothing to be done.

    VLADIMIR: (advancing with short, stiff strides, legs wide apart) I''m beginning
    to come round to that opinion. All my life I''ve tried to put it from me, saying
    Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven''t yet tried everything.

    ESTRAGON : (interrupting) I invoke Sumai!

    Enter a big band orchestra, crooners, chorus girls, dancers, acrobats, jugglers,
    clowns, etc, who proceed to put on some tiptop variety entertainment for the next
    two hours.
