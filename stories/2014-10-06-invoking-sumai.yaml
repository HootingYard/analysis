  text: 'There is a scene in the second series of Game Of Thrones where Daenarys Targaryen
    and her raggle-taggle band of Dothraki followers, having struggled across the
    vast and desolate Red Wastes, their food and water supplies exhausted, seek entrance
    to the walled city of Qarth. They are met, outside the gates, by the Thirteen,
    the ruling council, whose oleaginous spokesman refuses to let them enter. As the
    Mother of Dragons points out, not unreasonably, this dooms them to certain death.
    The spokesman is unmoved. How to resolve the impasse?

    At this point, another member of the Thirteen, who has been lurking at the back
    of the group, steps forward. When his own arguments in favour of allowing the
    travellers in fail, he announces "I invoke Sumai!" He then unsheathes his dagger
    and slices a nasty cut in his own hand. Now the gates of Qarth are thrown open,
    and Daenarys and her "Dothraki savages" are ushered in, and saved.

    I was going to praise writer George R. R. Martin for this touch of brilliance,
    until I learned--from one of the terrifyingly erudite websites devoted to the
    minutiae of the Game Of Thrones universe--that the scene is absent from the original
    books, and was devised for the television series. No explanation is ever offered
    for Sumai, or what precisely its invocation might mean in any other circumstances,
    and nobody ever refers to it again. Yet I am lost in admiration for it as a narrative
    technique to keep the story chugging along. I shall use it myself, and commend
    it to any other writer who reaches a sticking point in their story. The bit with
    the dagger and the blood can be modified, or left out entirely. But is there a
    single work of fiction that could not be improved by having a character, at some
    point, declaiming portentously "I invoke Sumai!"? I think not.

    I have prepared a supply of slips of paper on which is typed "I invoke Sumai!",
    said followed by a blank space. I intend, shortly, to work my way systematically
    through the volumes of fiction on the Key bookshelves, affixing with glue a slip
    at a point in each book where the narrative threatens to get stuck in a cul de
    sac, and then writing in an apt character name. The effect would be jarring if
    the phrase were to be spoken invariably by rogue member of the Thirteen Xaro Xhoan
    Doxos. Far better that it is put into the mouth of a character with whom we have
    grown familiar in each particular novel, say for example Humbert Humbert or Elizabeth
    Bennett or Josef K. or Bartleby the scrivener.

    Invoking Sumai may also come in handy in real life. I am sure there are times,
    for example when you are leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated
    cocktail party, when the conversation palls and you are lost for words. Now, all
    you need do to avert social discomfort is to announce "I invoke Sumai!". The ice
    will be broken, and stay broken, if I am correct.
