  text: "I recall reading somewhere or other that, when asked to describe his ideal\
    \ reader, James Joyce said he envisaged somebody spending the best part of their\
    \ life devoted to the diligent study of his work, to the exclusion of all other\
    \ concerns. Without for a moment comparing myself to Joyce, I must admit that\
    \ his is an attitude of which I wholly approve. After all, why do we write at\
    \ all, if we do not take our own work with the utmost seriousness, and expect\
    \ readers\u2014or at least some readers\u2014to do likewise?\nLaughable and hopeless\
    \ it may be, but I like to think that, long after my mortal remains have been\
    \ devoured by worms, there will be a small body of beetle-browed scholars poring\
    \ over every word I have ever written, trying to wring from it everything that\
    \ can be wrung. It is for them, as yet unborn, that I offer this tiny contribution\
    \ to their important research.\nIn the mid-1980s I worked as a drudge and minion\
    \ in a local authority office in London. One day I was given the task, who knows\
    \ for what purpose?, of sorting through the personnel files of past employees\u2014\
    those who had left, or retired, or died. There were hundreds of these files, beige\
    \ cardboard folders containing the dim dull records of long-forgotten members\
    \ of staff. As I worked my way through them, two names grabbed my attention and\
    \ lodged in my brain, where they have remained ever since.\nShortly afterwards,\
    \ in the latter half of the decade, I had my epiphany upon reading Dallas Wiebe's\
    \ line \u201CWhen you have nothing to say, you write prose\u201D, and began to\
    \ write prose. And in writing prose fiction, I learned that one of the things\
    \ you have to do is to give your characters names. How to choose those names?\
    \ Over the years, I have used a number of different methods. But back then, I\
    \ realised I had a couple of excellent names stuck in my head. Yes, they were\
    \ the identifiable names of real people, but \u201Cno resemblance to anyone living\
    \ or dead blah blah blah\u201D should cover it.\nThe first ex-employee of the\
    \ council whose name I appropriated was B. Bewg. He became the \u201Chero\u201D\
    \ of Mr Bewg's Reference, a tale the register of which is clearly also indebted\
    \ to my rummaging through those personnel files.\nThe other name that sang to\
    \ me, and still does, was Nuttawood Sirinuntananon. The more diligent scholars\
    \ will, I hope, work out that that must be a real name\u2014after all, who would,\
    \ could, make it up? I can't actually recall, today, where I first deployed Mr.\
    \ S., but it will have been in one of the early out of print pamphlets. He reappeared\
    \ very briefly at Hooting Yard in 2004 and, with a different forename, in 2012\u2014\
    where, I am pleased to note, you will also encounter a certain Krumbein, who was\
    \ also a council employee, though one I actually met, as he had not yet been consigned\
    \ to the beige cardboard graveyard.\nGosh, this is the kind of stuff that will\
    \ have future scholars in ecstasy. I try to be helpful."
