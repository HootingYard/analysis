  text: "In \u201CDer Liedler\u201D (1815), a minstrel saves a maiden from a werewolf\
    \ by smashing his harp against him and then hurling him over a cliff.\nAs noted\
    \ in The Spectator by Damian Thompson, who adds \u201CEven Schubert couldn't polish\
    \ this particular turd. Long, corny, cod-mediaeval ballads never showed him at\
    \ his best.\u201D"
