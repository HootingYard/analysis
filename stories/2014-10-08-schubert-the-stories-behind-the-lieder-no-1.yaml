  text: 'In "Der Liedler" (1815), a minstrel saves a maiden from a werewolf by smashing
    his harp against him and then hurling him over a cliff.

    As noted in The Spectator by Damian Thompson, who adds "Even Schubert couldn''t
    polish this particular turd. Long, corny, cod-mediaeval ballads never showed him
    at his best."'
