  text: "In 1871, T. H. Huxley was invited to join a committee for the investigation\
    \ of Spiritualist phenomena. He declined, writing:\nsupposing the phenomena to\
    \ be genuine\u2014they do not interest me. If anybody would endow me with the\
    \ faculty of listening to the chatter of old women and curates in the nearest\
    \ cathedral town, I should decline the privilege, having better things to do.\n\
    And if the folk in the spiritual world do not talk more wisely and sensibly than\
    \ their friends report them to do, I put them in the same category.\nThe only\
    \ good that I can see in a demonstration of the truth of \u2018Spiritualism\u2019\
    \ is to furnish an additional argument against suicide. Better live a crossing-sweeper\
    \ than die and be made to talk twaddle by a \u2018medium\u2019 hired at a guinea\
    \ a s\xE9ance.\nQuoted in The Founders Of Psychical Research by Alan Gauld (Routledge\
    \ & Kegan Paul, 1968)\n\nT. H. Huxley\_: Victorian with beard"
