  text: "To a man of [Frederic] Myers\u2019 eager temperament restrained indifference\
    \ was not possible; his pent-up enthusiasm was sooner or later sure to find some\
    \ line of discharge. And it so happened that a ready line of discharge was at\
    \ that point presented to him by the crusading Christianity of Mrs. Josephine\
    \ Butler, the still young and beautiful wife of George Butler, Vice-Principal\
    \ of Cheltenham College, and later Principal of Liverpool College. Mrs. Butler\
    \ later, of course, became famous for her work among prostitutes and her campaign\
    \ against the Contagious Diseases Acts. At this time however she was chiefly engaged\
    \ in what might be described as the spiritual seduction of promising young men.\
    \ Her religion was emotional rather than dogmatic, and her methods of conversion\
    \ were simple. Having aroused her quarry by her exciting concern for his welfare,\
    \ she would flatter him with an earnest account of her own inner trials and victories\u2014\
    an account delivered perhaps at twilight while she lay with her slim form stretched\
    \ out upon a sofa\u2014and at last capture him by a well-staged d\xE9nouement.\
    \ She might, for instance, call him into her room to find her kneeling in pale\
    \ beauty before her mirror, devoutly praying for his salvation. Only men with\
    \ the coolest heads could resist such an appeal; and Myers was not one of them.\
    \ During the next few years he met or visited Mrs. Butler repeatedly, and his\
    \ way of life changed so much that his friends hardly knew him. One of them, Richard\
    \ Jebb, noted in his Journal for 26 February 1866: \u201CMyers devotes himself\
    \ to self-discipline. He never goes anywhere. He gets up at 6.30 and goes to bed\
    \ at 10.00. His days are spent in reading Ecce Homo and in thinking.\u201D\nAlan\
