  text: "Sometimes I find myself fretting about things which common sense tells me\
    \ are absolutely not worth fretting about. Yet still I fret. Think of it as idiotic\
    \ fretting.\nThe latest matter to consume my stupid attention is as follows. I\
    \ was struck, when watching Danish television dramas such as Borgen and The Killing,\
    \ by the immense politeness of the Danes. In both shows, the characters are forever\
    \ saying \u201CTakk\u201D (\u201CThank you\u201D), certainly more so than the\
    \ average Brit or American would do. I am not familiar with real life in Denmark,\
    \ but I assume that the writers of these series are making every effort to reproduce\
    \ the actual speech of contemporary Danes.\nIn Game Of Thrones, by contrast, we\
    \ are told by Ser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) that \u201Cthere is no word for \u2018\
    thank you\u2019 in Dothraki\u201D. Given that the Dothraki are a savage and barbaric\
    \ race whose idea of a square meal is to consume a whole horse-heart, raw, the\
    \ absence of an expression of gratitude is not surprising.\nBut what is bothering\
    \ me is this\_: when Danish dramas are shown on Dothraki television, how in heaven's\
    \ name will the subtitle-writers cope with all those \u201CTakk\u201Ds?\nIt is,\
    \ to be sure, a proper quandary, if an idiotic one.\n\nThe Khaleesi eating a raw\
    \ horse-heart for breakfast"
