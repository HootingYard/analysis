  text: "\u201CThe dictionary ends sooner than the soul.\u201D\u2014Frederic Myers,\
    \ letter to Arthur Sidgwick, 14 July 1867.\nWhen we reach the end of the dictionary,\
    \ there are no more words. We have exhausted them. We are left, then, with three\
    \ choices.\nWe may lapse into silence. This is a strategy much favoured by anchorites\
    \ and hermits and some saints and saintly persons. I have, myself, been described\
    \ as a Diogenesian recluse, and not without good reason.\nWe may resort to barbaric\
    \ grunting. This seems to be a popular choice among many of the shuffling scowling\
    \ denizens of my bailiwick. Whenever I go sashaying forth\u2014for even a recluse\
    \ must sashay forth from time to time\u2014I hear more grunts than words. But\
    \ where once I thumbed my nose in patrician contempt at those grunters, now I\
    \ understand that they have been reduced to their barbarism because they have\
    \ used up all the words in the dictionary, from A to Z. They reached the end.\n\
    We may invent new words. We may coin new sounds. Glogscheen, snup, parapapahooft,\
    \ swarfoogie. Some might say we are thus babbling nonsense. Others would counter\
    \ that our nonce-words are divinely inspired, that we are \u201Cspeaking in tongues\u201D\
    . Once towards the end of the last century, I sat in a hall in a meeting of the\
    \ religiously devout, several of whose members loomed over me and so spoke in\
    \ tongues, to cure me of my woes. Those woes are past, and I may doubt that incoherent\
    \ babbling was the cause of their passing, but can I ever be sure?\nThere is a\
    \ fourth choice. When we reach the end of the dictionary, we turn back to the\
    \ beginning, where each and every word awaits us anew."
