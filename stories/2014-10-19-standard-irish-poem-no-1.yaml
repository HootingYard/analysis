  text: "I can see my father now\n  With his spade\n  Digging up potatoes\n  In a\
    \ field\n  As rain pours down\n  Then trudging back\n  His boots in the muck\n\
    \  To the filthy cottage\n  Where my mother clutches her rosary beads\n  And prays\
    \ to the Blessed Virgin\n  For more rain\n  And more potatoes\n  To feed the visiting\
    \ priest"
