  text: "\nTwenty-six years ago, the Malice Aforethought Press published Penitence\
    \ And Farm Implements in an edition of twenty-six copies. Each copy was individually\
    \ lettered from A to Z. The front and back covers contained twenty-six photographs,\
    \ snipped out of (I think) old copies of National Geographic magazine. One of\
    \ the original snippages was pasted in on the inside title page of each copy.\n\
    The preface\u2014or \u201CA Few Words Before The Drivel\u201D\u2014ran as follows:\n\
    The seventy-five pieces in this book were written between 1981 and 1987; they\
    \ are arranged here in no particular order. Readers whose brains become frazzled\
    \ by the often turgid nature of these poems may prefer to muck about with the\
    \ illustrative matter; this consists of sheets of sticky labels inserted here\
    \ and there within the book. Indeed, it is possible to ignore the texts completely\
    \ and to spend hours of idle amusement rearranging the pictures in jigsaw-like\
    \ fashion, or to remove the labels from the book entirely and use them as charming\
    \ decorative accessories, guaranteed to brighten up the home, office, or slaughterhouse.\n\
    To which was appended a line from John Aubrey's Brief Lives:\n\u201Cafter his\
    \ Booke came out, he fell mightily in his Practize, and 'twas beleeved by the\
    \ vulgar that he was crack-brained\u201D.\nThe \u201Cillustrative matter\u201D\
    \ consisted of further snippages from National Geographic, printed\u2014in black\
    \ and white\u2014on to sheets of Gestetner sticky labels. Of the written content,\
    \ the less said the better.\nPenitence And Farm Implements is possibly the rarest\
    \ of rare out of print pamphlets published by the Malice Aforethought Press during\
    \ the last quarter of the last century. I would be interested to hear from any\
    \ long-time Hooting Yard fanatics who actually own a copy. There can only be twenty-five\
    \ of you in total.\n"
