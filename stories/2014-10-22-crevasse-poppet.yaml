  text: "A couple of years ago I had reason to mention a crevasse wanker. Today, while\
    \ solving the Guardian crossword, I was reminded of that rather more charming\
    \ figure of the mountaineering world, Gertrude Chumpot, known as the crevasse\
    \ poppet (16 down, 3 down). Gertrude earned this soubriquet because she was a\
    \ sort of one-woman mountain rescue service, adept at saving the lives and limbs\
    \ of hapless mountaineers who, not looking where they were going, plummeted down\
    \ crevasses to what would otherwise have been certain death.\nOne of the great\
    \ mysteries of the crevasse poppet was the manner in which she effected her rescues.\
    \ Eschewing the usual kit of ropes and pitons and whatever else is used by standard\
    \ mountain rescue teams, she employed a form of inexplicable mesmerism. Standing\
    \ at the edge of a crevasse wherein languished a moaning ninny who had fallen\
    \ in some minutes earlier, Gertrude would make enigmatic sweeping movements of\
    \ her arms while babbling gibberish and gazing at the sky. By this means, she\
    \ somehow levitated the nitwit out of the crevasse. At least, that is what she\
    \ told the Commission of Inquiry when it was considering whether to prosecute\
    \ her for witchcraft. She was such a charming poppet that the case was dropped.\n\
    The crossword is particularly ingenious because it is littered with references\
    \ to her story. The chairman of the Commission, for example, was an unromantic\
    \ taciturn Lett (23 across, 1 down, 24 across), named Arpad Klingklang. Arriving\
    \ for the first session on his horse (9 across), he gave a press conference where\
    \ he stated that he was ready to burn Gertrude Chumpot immediately, given that\
    \ in his view it was a clear case of possession (11 across) by Old Nick (10 across).\
    \ The crevasse poppet had only been on the witness stand for a few minutes, however,\
    \ before the Lett was like a moonstruck calf, hopelessly in love. Soon enough,\
    \ he called proceedings to a halt, put all the paperwork through a shredder (5\
    \ down), and was persuaded to take a rest cure (26 across) at a seaside resort\
    \ (7 down), where he spent his time drinking caf\xE9 noir (8 across), dancing\
    \ the habanera (20 across) with various ladies (22 across), and poring over erotica\
    \ (17 across). In an attempt to rid him of his Gertrude-mania, the staff fed him\
    \ a diet of gruel containing bits of leek (2 down) and locust (22 down).\nThere\
    \ are several Alpine folk songs about the crevasse poppet, usually yodelled to\
    \ the accompaniment of an alpenhorn. If you listen to them you will probably need\
    \ to take a rest cure yourself."
