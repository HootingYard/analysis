  text: "Madge Strudwick, Madge Strudwick, where goest thou?\nI'm going to the barn\
    \ for to milk me a cow.\n  Madge Strudwick, Madge Strudwick, what will you do\
    \ then?\nI'll read the hot entrails of a fresh-slaughtered hen.\nAfter studying\
    \ this verse for several hours, pupils are required to write a potted biography\
    \ of Madge Strudwick, of no fewer than twenty thousand words, following her progress\
    \ from the iron cot in the orphanage to a pauper's grave, and taking in significant\
    \ events in her life, including the appearance of milk teeth, theft of her breakfast\
    \ porridge by bears, pole-vaulting competitions, airship disasters, the darning\
    \ of a rent in her polka dot dress, ignominy and pelf, later further pelf, deployment\
    \ of the Snodgrass implement, pantry etiquette, on her first looking into Chapman's\
    \ Homer, dreary rainy autumnal afternoons, the thing with the spatchcock, the\
    \ encounter with a spider while sat on a tuffet eating curds and whey, what she\
    \ really thought about curds, the pricking of her thumbs, dust in her boudoir,\
    \ the agony in the garden, gardening tips, her reputation as a chatterbox, clown\
    \ murder, shortcake recipes, planetary influences, chocolate swiss roll, gladioli,\
    \ Choctaw lineage, speech impediment, holiday snapshots, filbert hedges, the pounding\
    \ of those infernal drums, pictures of Jap girls in synthesis, collusion with\
    \ vampires, baffling reappearance of milk teeth, sun worship, pet budgerigar,\
    \ possible sighting on the grassy knoll on 22 November 1963, ribbons, melodrama,\
    \ shoes, bus pass, library ticket, pippy bag, anaconda, hoop, shutters, antimacassar,\
    \ nunnery, pincers, peg, tap, bedevilment, soot, soap, soup. Extra points will\
    \ be given for pointy bits."
