  text: 'I was excited to note in the television listings that there is a showing
    this afternoon of a remake of the 1977 film Raid on Entebbe, entitled Raid on
    N. Tebbit, in which a crack team of Mossad agents attempts to rescue hostages
    from the home of a deranged octogenarian ex-cabinet minister.


    Readers may recall that the very same N. Tebbit was in the news a few years ago
    for attacking a child dressed in a dragon outfit.'
