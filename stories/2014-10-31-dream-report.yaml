  text: 'Last night I had a dream in which I met a young idiot savant who had committed
    to memory the entire contents of every single issue of Reader''s Digest magazine.

    "Recite the story about the blue caravan that appeared in 1965 or thereabouts,"
    I said.

    Before he was able to do so, the dream veered off in another direction, alas.

    NOTA BENE : For the correct placement of the apostrophe in the title of Reader''s
    Digest magazine, see this potsage [sic].'
