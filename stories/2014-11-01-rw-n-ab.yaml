  text: "Approaching his seventieth birthday, Robert Wyatt has reportedly decided\
    \ to \u201Cstop making music\u201D. The writer Richard Williams rang him up to\
    \ confirm if this was true. Wyatt responded with an anecdote\nabout the novelist\
    \ Jean Rhys, who, after a long period of inactivity, responded to her publisher's\
    \ gentle suggestion that she might like to write another book by asking him if\
    \ he'd enjoyed her last one. \u201CYes, of course,\u201D he answered. \u201CWell,\
    \ read it again,\u201D Rhys said.\nIndeed. I will be taking up the invitation\
    \ (the command?) to listen again to Wyatt's extensive back catalogue. He was one\
    \ of my earliest musical uberenthusiasms, from the day in the very early 1970s\
    \ when my older brother came home clutching a double-album reissue of Soft Machine\
    \ Volumes One and Two. (Side one of the latter remains one of my putative Desert\
    \ Island Discs.)\nJust as the career of the out of print pamphleteer Dobson is\
    \ intertwined with his inamorata and Muse, Marigold Chew, so we must never overlook\
    \ the contribution of Alfreda Benge to Wyatt's work. I was once asked to name\
    \ my favourite painting. It wasn't an Old Master or modernist masterpiece from\
    \ one of the great galleries. It was\u2014still is\u2014Benge's cover for Ruth\
    \ Is Stranger Than Richard (1975). (Click for huge version.)\n"
