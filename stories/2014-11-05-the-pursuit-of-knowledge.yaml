    I was not surprised, when I set out to reacquaint myself with Robert Wyatt''s
    complete back catalogue, that memories came flooding back. The earlier part of
    his career coincided with my adolescence, that time when some of our enduring
    enthusiasms lodge themselves in our souls. Wyatt was my great musical hero when
    I was fourteen, and he remains an abiding figure, even if I no longer worship
    him, as I did then, as a god. But listening to the very first records, with Soft
    Machine, prompted memories of another of my teenage talismans, and more particularly
    of something irrevocably lost, and lost not just to me but to everyone.

    At the beginning of Soft Machine Volume Two, Wyatt announces that what we are
    about to hear is "a choice selection of rivmic melodies from the official orchestra
    of the College of ''Pataphysics". Like many another spotty youth with intellectual
    yearnings, I pored over the lyrics of my favourite albums, and in this case I
    wondered: was there really such a college?, were Soft Machine really its official
    orchestra?, and, er, what the hell was ''pataphysics anyway? That word rang a
    faint bell, and it was not long before I recalled where I had heard it before.
    "Maxwell''s Silver Hammer" from Abbey Road--arguably the most irritating song
    in the Beatles'' canon--opens with Joan studying "''pataphysical science in the
    home".

    Because it was Wyatt, because it was intriguing, because it was obscure, I wanted
    to find out more about this ''pataphysics business. But where to start? And that,
    precisely, is what we have lost, that question of where to start. If I were a
    teenager today, the question would not even occur to me. I would head straight
    for the wikipedia. From the comfort of my smelly sock-strewn bedroom, and pausing
    only for the occasional pot noodle, within a few hours I could find out all I
    wished to know about ''pataphysics, familiarise myself with the life of Alfred
    Jarry, download the texts of his plays and prose, and veer off in other promising
    directions, towards Dada and surrealism. By the time I tumbled into bed my head
    would be crammed with the knowledge that, four decades ago, took me years to acquire.

    And this, I think, is a great loss. Complete access to everything all the time
    seems--and sometimes is--wondrous, even miraculous. But what is lost is the pleasure
    of pursuit, following a trail, serendipitous discoveries, unexpected byways, and--most
    importantly--the time taken. The instant availability of all that information
    to me, aged fourteen, could never be as valuable as the process of its gradual
    acquisition over months and years.

    Where I did begin was with my parents'' bookshelves. I have written before about
    the experience of growing up on a bleak council estate, but of course I was never
    culturally impoverished. Quite apart from the teeming bookshelves, I was a bus-
    and Tube-ride away from London. Also, back then, my local library was still a
    building filled with books, and not the "chat-''n''-snack zone" (in the approving
    words of Labour''s last "culture" secretary) it, and so many others, have become.

    Unfortunately, eclectic though my parents'' tastes were, they did not run to a
    love of screechy-voiced madcap alcoholic visionary French writers of the fin de
    siecle. I was able to dig out stray references in some of their many art books.
    Further mentions popped up from time to time in the pages of the dear old NME
    in its halcyon days, usually in interviews with some of my other favourites like
    Slapp Happy or Henry Cow. In the library I found a copy of Ubu Roi. I somehow
    discovered the existence of a book called The Banquet Years by Roger Shattuck,
    a quarter of which was devoted to a biography of and critical essay on Jarry.
    I remember asking my father to buy it for me the next time he popped into Foyle''s
    (which was pretty much every week.) On one of my own forays into town, at a time
    when Charing Cross Road was packed with bookshops, I found a Jonathan Cape anthology
    of Jarry''s Selected Writings. And one day I was unreasonably overexcited to receive
    in the post, as a gift from my sister in America, a copy of the Evergreen Review
    (Volume 4, Number 13, May-June 1960), a 190-page paperback special issue entitled
    What Is ''Pataphysics? It remains one of my most treasured possessions.

    The point is that this was all very piecemeal and gradual, and therein lay the
    pleasure--of pursuit and discovery, stretching over time. It is a pleasure to
    a large extent lost. Had I not sworn off the booze, I would celebrate it, mournfully,
    in the spirit of Alfred Jarry, with a couple of bottles of wine and a pint of
    absinthe before breakfast. No wonder he was dead at thirty-four.'
