  text: 'Few relationships are as close, and as intense, as that between a janitor
    and his mop. He may sense an attachment to his bunch of keys and his pail and
    his dog, but he cherishes his mop more than anything.

    I have spent several years interviewing janitors, and invariably they volunteer
    the information that their mop is their most treasured possession. They will say
    this, loudly and with vehemence, even when their dog is sitting obediently at
    their feet, gazing up at them in adoration. I am sure there is a monograph to
    be written, one day, upon janitors and their dogs, but I shall leave that joy
    to another scribbler. It is not that I am averse to dogs, well, I am, but it is
    not my aversion that dissuades me from writing about them. Were a janitor to spout
    effusive folderol on the subject of his dog, during one of my interviews, I would
    note it down accordingly and include it in my finished piece. I do not provide
    verbatim transcripts, preferring instead to give the reader an impressionistic
    or expressionistic or borderline hysterical portrait of the janitor through gorgeous
    words. Not all of these words will have been spoken by the janitor, nor by me,
    but they seem to hover in the aether in the janitor''s vicinity. That is what
    I try, as best I am able, to communicate.

    It remains a remarkable fact that the thousands of janitors I have interviewed
    over the years have expressed boundless love for their mops. Often they are moved
    to tears, or, contrarily, to gales of unbridled glee, or sometimes both, turn
    and turn about. It is an emotionally wrenching experience, for them to be interviewed,
    and also for me, as the interviewer, broaching the topic of the mop and not knowing
    whether I will need to provide a napkin for them to dab at their tear-stained
    cheeks, or a similar napkin for myself to wipe off the flecks of spittle sprayed
    over me by janitors in the extremes of happiness. It occasionally happens that
    the dog, if it is frisky, will try to catch the napkin, either of the napkins,
    in its jaws, and scamper away with it, as if it were a bone. They are mysterious
    creatures, dogs, and often quite stupid. The mop, being inanimate, is much more
    predictable, and much less bother.

    For reasons I have not yet been able to fathom, no publisher has expressed an
    interest in my book of janitorial interviews. It thus remains in manuscript, hand-written,
    with a butcher''s pencil, in a series of exercise books, some lined, some unlined.
    For the past several months I have had these books stored in a cupboard on the
    ground floor of a large building in a central location, near a bank, into the
    vaults of which I wish to transfer them for greater security, when I can afford
    the fee to do so. In the meantime, the cupboard is kept locked and watched over
    by a janitor, one of the few I have not taken time to interview. He prowls the
    corridors, rattling his bunch of keys, deploying his beloved mop, and followed
    everywhere by his dog. Insert apt Latin phrase to conclude this piece with a freight
    of significance.'
