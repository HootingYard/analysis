  text: 'The relationship between a janitor and his pail is a matter well worth our
    attention. Some janitors will call their pail a bucket, but it is much of a muchness.
    It may well be that, for the pernickety, a pail and a bucket are not quite the
    same thing, but we are not pernickety, at least not today. Today we are having
    one of our non-pernickety days. Good heavens, we did not even time the boiling
    of our breakfast egg to the second, as we do on our pernickety days. No, today,
    we plopped the egg into the pan and set the burners roaring beneath it and we
    wandered away, picked up the post from the doormat, kicked the wainscot, kicked
    it again, God knows why, chucked the post into the wastepaper basket--it was all
    flyers, flyers--put the kettle on, extracted from our majestic bouffant a small
    beetle which had taken up residence, Peason-like, and placed it on the windowsill,
    opened the window, adjusted the position of the vase of hollyhock cuttings, turning
    them towards the light, though Lord knows there was little enough light, so early
    was the hour, and pottered and puttered in other dithery ways before returning
    to the kitchen to set the burners unroaring beneath the pan, without checking
    the time on our wristwatch, rather judging that a sufficiency had passed for the
    egg in the pan to be toothsome when shelled. On a pernickety day, on the other
    hand, we would not leave our post, by the cooker, but count the minutes and the
    seconds, gazing from wristwatch to pan and back again, and as the second hand
    on the watch tocked to its appointed spot we would immediately lift the pan from
    the roaring burners, extinguish them, hoist the egg from the seething waters and
    transfer it to its egg-cup--a souvenir egg-cup from an ill-starred seaside resort--sure
    in the knowledge that it had been boiled for a very specific and particular length
    of time as recommended in Blotzmann''s Manual of Egg-Boiling (second edition,
    lilac series). Thus the variation between our pernickety and our non-pernickety
    days, a variation designed to crack us from the bonds of rut.

    What does all that have to do with janitors and pails or, if you prefer, janitors
    and buckets? Little or nothing, like the littleness of the light as we tuck into
    our early morning boiled egg, like the nothingness at the core of our all too
    mortal soul.'
