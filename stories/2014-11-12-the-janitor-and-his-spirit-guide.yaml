  text: 'Few subjects have received as little attention as the relationship between
    a janitor and his spirit guide. All janitors have one, though many janitors do
    not acknowledge its existence, while others, both janitors and observers of janitors,
    confuse the spirit guide with the janitor''s dog. Of course, not all janitors
    have dogs, which rather proves the point and should serve to clarify the matter.
    We shall examine the janitor-dog nexus in a future essay, if nexus is the word
    I am looking for.

    The spirit guides of janitors are clad, invariably, in raincoats, though being
    as ethereal as the guides themselves the raincoats are not visible to the mundane
    eye. This makes them no less effective as raincoats. Janitors'' spirit guides
    do not get wet in rainstorms. Were they so to do, in all likelihood they would
    dissolve and form a puddle of ectoplasmic sludge, a puddle which the janitor would
    be duty bound to mop up with his decidedly unethereal mop, a duty made all the
    more onerous because he would no longer have his spirit guide to guide the mopping,
    a sure recipe for janitorial catastrophe. Let me repeat that. Were they [the spirit
    guides] so to do [become rain-soaked], in all likelihood they would dissolve and
    form a puddle of ectoplasmic sludge, a puddle which the janitor would be duty
    bound to mop up with his decidedly unethereal mop, a duty made all the more onerous
    because he would no longer have his spirit guide to guide the mopping, a sure
    recipe for janitorial catastrophe. There is more wisdom packed into that single
    sentence than in anything else I have ever written.

    The averting of catastrophe is the most important contribution his spirit guide
    makes to any janitor''s day. But it is not the only one. In the course of my interviews
    with thousands of janitors, those who were prepared to admit the existence of
    their spirit guides mentioned a huge variety of ways in which these spectral raincoated
    beings from realms unseen give a helping hand to their allotted janitor. Many
    of the testimonies I heard were incomprehensible, if not exactly gibberish. My
    lack of comprehension was due to the fact that, not being a janitor myself, and
    thus not in possession of a spirit guide, my puny brain could not make any sense
    of what I was being told. An example will give you some idea of my difficulty.
    This is from Interview Transcript No. 849:

    Me : Can you tell me something of earth-shattering excitement about your spirit
    guide and the way it aids you in the course of a typical janitorial day? Speak
    clearly into the microphone.

    Janitor No. 849 : Hectic donkeys and the clicking of panic buttons or picnic buttons
    with unalloyed gusto pop ix pop vug then squelchy invasions usually hence hinged.

    It is possible, if one studied that reply for several years, with the aid of glossaries
    and reference books and an atlas of the Other Side, that some sense could be wrung
    from it. But even in the absence of understanding it demonstrates, I think, that
    the ways of spirit guides are not our ways, and we can form only a partial, blurred,
    and vague conception of those ways. Is the same true of the janitors themselves?
    Do they have a clearer understanding of their spirit guides?

    It is instructive, in this connection, to do as I have done, and to observe a
    janitor in the throes of his janitordom, all the while making notes in a notebook
    with a propelling pencil. When reviewed at leisure, at the end of the day, sitting
    in an armchair and sipping an egg nog, such notes can reveal startling insights.
    Of course one has to ensure that one notes what is noteworthy and not what is
    not noteworthy. I confess that on my first few exercises in this regard I made
    a complete ballocks of the whole business. I did not know what I ought to be looking
    for. I would, for example, scribble down my observations of a janitor''s mopping
    demeanour, while failing to make a single note about his pail (or bucket) frenzy.
    Such frenzies, I learned, are, or can be, the key to the janitor-spirit guide
    nexus. I am still not sure if that is the word I want.

    Of course not all janitorial frenzies are related to their spirit guides. Let
    us not be silly. Let us, instead, sink deeper into our armchair, drain our cup
    of egg nog, and drift into a doze, in the hope that we may be granted a visit
    from a shimmering benevolent being from worlds beyond sense, clad in a raincoat,
    a raincoat, a rainc....'
