  text: "\nMrs Catherine Crowe, who wrote the best-selling Night Side Of Nature [1848],\
    \ an enormous compilation of ghost stories, was found \u2018in the street, clothed\
    \ only in her chastity, a pocket-handkerchief, and a visiting-card. She had been\
    \ informed, it appeared, by the spirits, that if she went in that trim she would\
    \ be invisible\u2019,\nfrom The Spiritualists\_: The Passion For The Occult In\
    \ The Nineteenth And Twentieth Centuries by Ruth Brandon (Weidenfeld & Nicolson,\
