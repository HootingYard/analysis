    Mrs Catherine Crowe, who wrote the best-selling Night Side Of Nature [1848], an
    enormous compilation of ghost stories, was found ''in the street, clothed only
    in her chastity, a pocket-handkerchief, and a visiting-card. She had been informed,
    it appeared, by the spirits, that if she went in that trim she would be invisible'',

    from The Spiritualists : The Passion For The Occult In The Nineteenth And Twentieth
    Centuries by Ruth Brandon (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1983)'
