  text: I was delighted to learn that the Governor of Idaho is named Butch Otter.
    Mr Otter is not to be confused with his namesake, the character who made occasional
    appearances in the Unconscious Squirrel cartoon strip, along with his anthropomorphic
    pals Milksop Weasel, Mordant Heron, Smarmy Badger, and Rancorous Peewit.
