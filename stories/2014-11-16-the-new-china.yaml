  text: "Browsing in a bookshop the other day, I noticed among the new titles a considerable\
    \ number of books about \u201CThe New China\u201D. I have not read any of them,\
    \ and did not buy any of them, but I have nevertheless been thinking about The\
    \ New China and how it might differ from The Old China.\nI began by wondering\
    \ if I could gain a grasp of the matter by comparing New Labour with Old Labour.\
    \ A moment's reflection, however, dissuaded me from going down that path. First,\
    \ The New China clearly has a definite article, whereas my researches have shown\
    \ that nowhere was New Labour ever referred to as The New Labour. Second, while\
    \ New Labour supplanted Old Labour, it has in itself now been replaced by, variously,\
    \ Blue Labour, New Old Labour, or simply Labour. As far as I have been able to\
    \ ascertain, this has not yet happened to The New China, which remains The New\
    \ China in opposition to The Old China.\nThere is one remarkable similarity, and\
    \ one glaring difference, between The New China and The Old China. (I am sure\
    \ there are more, of each, but these two instances will suffice to get us to the\
    \ nub. The nub, after all, is where we want to be, whether it be The New Nub or\
    \ The Old Nub, or just The Nub,)\nThe similarity is this. To a large extent, one\
    \ will find that the rivers and the mountains of The New China are almost exactly\
    \ the same as those of The Old China. There may be the occasional small variation,\
    \ but nothing a geographer of any stripe would deem significant. (I will be writing\
    \ about the stripes of geographers, in another context, shortly.)\nOn the other\
    \ hand, the people of The Old China have been completely replaced by new people\
    \ in The New China. If we pluck a year of The Old China at random\u2014say 1736\u2014\
    we find that every single one of those Old Chinese people is gone, and also that\
    \ not one of the New Chinese people has yet arrived on the scene.\nIt is of course\
    \ possible to posit a very different kind of The New China, where all the mountains\
    \ and rivers have been replaced by new ones, whereas the people are the same.\
    \ They would be staggering about, withered and wizened and toothless and doolally,\
    \ without a clue where they were, their familiar landmarks, the rivers and mountains,\
    \ changed, and changed utterly, in The New China."
