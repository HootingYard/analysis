  text: 'Browsing in a bookshop the other day, I noticed among the new titles a considerable
    number of books about "The New China". I have not read any of them, and did not
    buy any of them, but I have nevertheless been thinking about The New China and
    how it might differ from The Old China.

    I began by wondering if I could gain a grasp of the matter by comparing New Labour
    with Old Labour. A moment''s reflection, however, dissuaded me from going down
    that path. First, The New China clearly has a definite article, whereas my researches
    have shown that nowhere was New Labour ever referred to as The New Labour. Second,
    while New Labour supplanted Old Labour, it has in itself now been replaced by,
    variously, Blue Labour, New Old Labour, or simply Labour. As far as I have been
    able to ascertain, this has not yet happened to The New China, which remains The
    New China in opposition to The Old China.

    There is one remarkable similarity, and one glaring difference, between The New
    China and The Old China. (I am sure there are more, of each, but these two instances
    will suffice to get us to the nub. The nub, after all, is where we want to be,
    whether it be The New Nub or The Old Nub, or just The Nub,)

    The similarity is this. To a large extent, one will find that the rivers and the
    mountains of The New China are almost exactly the same as those of The Old China.
    There may be the occasional small variation, but nothing a geographer of any stripe
    would deem significant. (I will be writing about the stripes of geographers, in
    another context, shortly.)

    On the other hand, the people of The Old China have been completely replaced by
    new people in The New China. If we pluck a year of The Old China at random--say
    1736--we find that every single one of those Old Chinese people is gone, and also
    that not one of the New Chinese people has yet arrived on the scene.

    It is of course possible to posit a very different kind of The New China, where
    all the mountains and rivers have been replaced by new ones, whereas the people
    are the same. They would be staggering about, withered and wizened and toothless
    and doolally, without a clue where they were, their familiar landmarks, the rivers
    and mountains, changed, and changed utterly, in The New China.'
