  text: 'It has come to my attention that some among you lot are not spending your
    appointed three hours per day listening to Jubilate Agno, Christopher Smart''s
    lengthy and demented poem, recited in full by Mr Key and Germander Speedwell.
    Happily, there is a link to the recording at the Public Domain Review. Backsliders
    take note!

    Which prompts me to bring to your attention the newly-published Public Domain
    Review : Selected Essays 2011-2013, a book which you ought to buy immediately.
    Go here for further details and ordering information. Mr Key''s piece on Kit Smart
    is included in the book, so it is a necessary purchase (along with Kew. Rhone.)
    for all fanatically devoted Hooting Yard completists, which of course is every
    last one of you.
