  text: "Greetings, Ephesians! How are things in Ephesus? Better, I hope, than they\
    \ are here at Haemoglobin Towers, where we are having terrible troubles, including\
    \ an infestation of pipistrelle bats, a plague of locusts, a dog in a manger,\
    \ mange on our turnips, an outbreak of scrofula, gluten intolerance, incursions\
    \ by barbarians, hot flushes, cold sores, ungainly hat angles, foopball hooliganism,\
    \ unearthly manifestations of the ghost of Googie Withers, and more general withers\
    \ of our googie and our boogie and our jazz-funk groove. We have all that to contend\
    \ with, Ephesians, while you lot are no doubt sprawled on your Ephesian divans\
    \ in Ephesus, gobbling grapes and swigging tumblers of intoxicant fluids and having\
    \ a debauched time of it.\nAnyway, the reason I am writing is that I hope to escape\
    \ from the several horrors swirling about Haemoglobin Towers and have booked a\
    \ charabanc to Ephesus, leaving from the bus station at Sawdust Bridge next Tuesday\
    \ at noon, or nearish to noon. But I do not have anywhere to stay when eventually\
    \ I arrive in Ephesus, assuming I do arrive and do not perish from poisoning by\
    \ the fumes of the charabanc, which is old and clackety and has not, so far as\
    \ I know, passed any of the rigorous vehicle safety tests one might hope it had.\n\
    Still, I must keep my pecker up and stride boldly into the future without worrying\
    \ my little head too much about expiring from noxious vapours. So if we assume\
    \ I will turn up at the bus station in Ephesus at some point, is there anybody\
    \ among you Ephesians who could put me up in a chalet, or a room, or a tent, or\
    \ even on a picnic blanket open to the elements? I am afraid I am penniless, and\
    \ cannot pay a sou by way of rent, but I will happily entertain my hosts by singing\
    \ lustily to the accompaniment of a piccolo. I have a repertoire of several pieces,\
    \ cover versions mostly, including my own \u201Cinterpretations\u201D (for want\
    \ of a better word) of Vienna by Ultravox, Dr Bogenbroom by Jethro Tull, and The\
    \ Poem of Ecstasy by Alexander Scriabin, whose hands, incidentally, were as tiny\
    \ as my head is tiny, proportionately speaking, if that means anything concrete,\
    \ which upon examination it probably does not, but then I am having difficulty\
    \ concentrating as in addition to all the other troubles listed above there is\
    \ now a swarm of wasps outside my window, desperately trying to find its way in\
    \ to my ill-appointed boudoir.\nOh, and one more thing, Ephesians. The charabanc\
    \ driver has just informed me that he has absolutely no idea how to get to Ephesus,\
    \ so if one among you could provide simple directions, so simple that even a dimwit\
    \ could understand them, that would be dandy! Grace be with all them that love\
    \ our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen."
