  text: "The Public Domain Review Book Of Essays 2011\u20132013, which I told you\
    \ lot about yesterday, is reviewed on the Paris Review website. Well, sort of\
    \ reviewed. The author confesses he had never heard of Christopher Smart before,\
    \ and devotes the bulk of his piece to a summary of Mr Key's essay on Jubilate\
    \ Agno. I added a comment directing readers to the audio recording at the Internet\
    \ Archive. Sooner or later, Germander Speedwell and I are going to \u201Cgo viral\u201D\
    , I am sure of it."
