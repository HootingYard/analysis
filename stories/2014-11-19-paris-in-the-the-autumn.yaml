  text: The Public Domain Review Book Of Essays 2011-2013, which I told you lot about
    yesterday, is reviewed on the Paris Review website. Well, sort of reviewed. The
    author confesses he had never heard of Christopher Smart before, and devotes the
    bulk of his piece to a summary of Mr Key's essay on Jubilate Agno. I added a comment
    directing readers to the audio recording at the Internet Archive. Sooner or later,
    Germander Speedwell and I are going to "go viral", I am sure of it.
