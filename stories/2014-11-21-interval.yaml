  text: There may be a short interval of unearthly silence at Hooting Yard, during
    which time Mr Key is engaged in the important business of concocting, for your
    delight, a paperback book. If all goes well, this will be available from Lulu
    in time for you to purchase multiple copies as Christmas gifts for your nearest
    and dearest and for anybody else you feel compelled to present with a Christmas
    gift, whomsoever they may be. Personally, I always feel the need to give a gift
    to the newsagent's cat. I never do, because it is a very stupid cat and would
    neither understand nor appreciate any gift I might give it, but every year I feel
    I ought to. Thus are my Christmases ruined, as I toss and turn and bite my pillow,
    racked with catguilt. Your Christmas, on the other hand, will be one of unsurpassed
    joy, as you clutch the latest Hooting Yard paperback to your bosom, weeping with
    gratitude.
