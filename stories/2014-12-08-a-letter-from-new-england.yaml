  text: 'A letter arrives from Christopher Lamere in New England. (I note, incidentally,
    that Mr Lamere''s name is an anagram of H[is] R[oyal] H[ighness] Elastic Emperor,
    though this may not be significant.)

    Dear Mr. Key

    I want you to know that you are my favorite writer. This may seem like a vast
    honor for a no-name, penniless, friendless failure of a 25 year old to bestow,
    but it is God''s truth. The imagery which you conjure gives me chills. The truths
    you tell with your stories fascinate and disturb me, especially because I often
    initially read your tales as flights of fancy instead of actual true events. As
    a resident of New England, your descriptions of far away ye Olde England are unnerving
    portraits of a distant land which my home tries to imitate.

    Imagine my surprise then, while wandering through some not very dense woods which
    as an American I would never call a spinney, I found myself at the edge of a wooden
    lake. At first, I was convinced that the plank upon plank of maple wood was merely
    the foundation for some as yet unconstructed building, but when I pressed my ear
    to the varnished surface, I heard that interminable sloshing of some hidden beast.
    I was shocked to find that your story of the wooden lake was not a mere fantasy,
    but an ominous story of hidden portent.

    It''s the most frustrating thing in the world, since it seems like a conspiracy
    which I was excluded from. Even with words whispered between my close friends,
    when I broach the subject of vast lake monsters, or even the mere idea of lakes
    hidden by wood, their whole demeanor changes. It''s as if they''ve never heard
    of a lake, or monsters, or wood, or even nails. While I have not been ejected
    from my town as of yet, people tend to narrow their eyes and hiss "outsider" when
    I come around. What should I do? I don''t own a hammer, and there is no duckpond
    in my town.

    Yours in fear,

    Christopher Lamere

    Have no fear, Mr Lamere! I have given much thought to what you should do in order
    to avoid otherwise inevitable gruesome consequences. First, make a magnetic tape-recording
    of the hissing sounds made by your townsfolk. Under cover of darkness, subject
    the tape to certain blasphemous manipulations, then use rusty blood-caked garden
    shears to cut it and form it into a loop, such that, when played, it will repeat
    after approximately thirteen seconds. Take it to the precise centre of the wooden
    lake and play it through an enormous loudspeaker or electric hooter at deafening
    volume. Have to hand a supply of pebbles which you can hurl at any townsfolk who
    approach, intent on silencing you. As the godawful hiss resounds across the wooden
    lake and into the dense woods, execute a tableau vivant of a historical or mythological
    theme--Judith with the head of Holofernes would be apt, or perhaps President Nixon
    holding his arms aloft just before boarding the helicopter on the White House
    lawn that ferried him to retirement. From time to time, increase the volume of
    the hissing tape loop. Before several days have passed, your lack of a hammer
    and a duckpond will count for nothing. And, as I so often say when dispensing
    advice, irrespective of the nature of that advice, remember to wear gloves.'
