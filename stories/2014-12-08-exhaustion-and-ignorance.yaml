  text: Cracks began to appear in his story immediately. So rapid was their onset
    that the story itself had not even started, as I have just demonstrated. Not only
    that, but the story was full of holes. There were more holes than there was story,
    at this stage. If one examined it, the story did not hang together. But it was
    exceedingly difficult to examine it in any detail, because of the cracks and the
    holes. These were now so legion that the story itself was barely perceptible.
    It would be more accurate to say that it was not perceptible at all, by any of
    the senses, even if all five were in working order. It is, I suppose, vaguely
    possible, but only vaguely, that someone blessed with a sixth sense might be able
    to perceive the story, but oh, dimly, dimly. There were just far too many cracks,
    and far too many holes, and it simply did not hang together. How could you hang
    a hole, after all, or a crack, even separately, one by one, discrete, let alone
    all together? It would be a very peculiar nail from which you might hang such
    a vacancy, or multiplicity of vacancies, if you were minded to try a nail, rather
    than a hook or a paperclip. But let us assume, for the sake of argument, and for
    the sake of his immortal soul, that such a nail or hook or paperclip existed,
    and from it you were able to hang, after much effort and sweat and elbow grease,
    numberless holes and cracks uncountable. Would you then be any closer to an appreciation
    of his story? I would aver that you would not, You would be exhausted and still
    wallowing in ignorance. As it happens, Exhaustion and Ignorance are my middle
    names. So I need not bother my little head about his stupid story. I can merely
    collapse, panting, upon my pallet, in a state of bliss.
