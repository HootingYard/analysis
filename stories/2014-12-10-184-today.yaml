text: "\nOn the occasion of her 184th birthday, I am reminded of my long-abandoned\
  \ project of concocting an entirely new corpus of works by Emily Dickinson, through\
  \ the simple procedure of jumbling up lines from her poems more or less at random.\
  \ Perhaps reviving this scheme will keep me occupied during my (imminent) dotage.\
  \ Here is a sample:\nBecause I could not stop for Death\n  Its little Ether Hood\n\
  \  Between my Curtain and the Wall\n  Had power to mangle me"
