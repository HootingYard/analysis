  text: 'Over the past few weeks I have been following an intriguing flurry of correspondence
    in the readers'' letters section of Bestial Grunting magazine. It began back in
    October--the "yellow month"--with a query from a certain Mr. P. X. Pyx, who wrote
    "I have been trying to obtain a map of Pointy Town, without success. Can any of
    your readers point me in the right direction?"

    In the next issue there were several replies, but most of them were facetious.
    They suggested plenty of directions in which Mr. Pyx might point himself, but
    the respondents were just having a spot of fun. The only sensible letter came
    from someone who described themselves (in an unpublished addendum) as an Official
    Pointy Town Tour Guide. It is worth mentioning here that such a position does
    not exist, as the only known tour guides in Pointy Town are resolutely unofficial,
    and proud of being so. But let that pass. This (unnamed) correspondent made the
    not unreasonable point that Mr. Pyx needed to divulge his own location before
    anybody could hope to have a clue in which direction he should be pointed in order
    to face either Pointy Town itself or a kiosk where he might make purchase of a
    map thereof. The editrix of Bestial Grunting awarded this letter five stars, and
    rightly so.

    The following week, a letter appeared undersigned "Mrs. P. X. Pyx, grieving relict
    of Mr. P. X. Pyx". Alongside the printed, typeset version of the letter, a photograph
    of the original was reproduced, showing the smudges occasioned during its composition
    by Mrs. Pyx''s fallen tears, the better for readers to appreciate her grief. The
    widow explained that her late husband had dutifully followed the sundry pieces
    of advice given by the facetious letter-writers in the previous issue, but that
    in pointing himself in dozens of different directions at great speed, he had become
    dizzy in the head, and toppled over, and fallen into a pit of vipers he happened
    to be standing next to at the time. Mrs. Pyx added the plea that she herself now
    sought advice on obtaining a map of Pointy Town, as it was her dearest wish that
    her husband be buried clutching said map in his cold dead white hands, as soon
    as the authorities had devised a method of safely extricating his corpse from
    the viper pit. She did not divulge her location. Her letter was not awarded any
    stars by the editrix.

    By the time the next issue of the magazine appeared, it was November, the "month
    of chrysanthemums". Much of the letters page was taken up with protests that Mrs.
    Pyx had not been given any stars. Several readers threatened to cancel their subscriptions
    unless this injustice was corrected. The editrix devoted a full page elsewhere
    in the issue to a carefully-argued piece explaining her decision. Stars, she wrote,
    were not awarded lightly, and she was damned if she was going to cave in to the
    demands of her more petulant readers who misunderstood the protocols. The article
    was accompanied by a photograph of the letters editor plucking a star from the
    night sky, preliminary to affixing it to the print-ready page.

    Eagle-eyed readers would have noticed, buried beneath all the letters of protest,
    a further letter from the soi-disant Official Pointy Town Tour Guide. He wrote
    that he was due to meet a mysterious "contact", at a crossroads at midnight, who
    dangled before him the possibility that he--the "contact"--might identify a kiosk
    where a map of Pointy Town could be obtained, though only for rental, rather than
    purchase outright.

    I missed the next issue of Bestial Grunting by dint of [illegible].

    God alone knows what happened, but in the fortnight since I''d bought a copy,
    the magazine had changed utterly. It was now called New Bestial Grunting, the
    editrix had become the editrix-in-chief, the letters editor had been demoted to
    office janitor, and the readers'' letters page had vanished. In its place was
    a sheet of burnt and blackened paper giving off a distinct whiff of sulphur. When
    I tried to return the magazine to the newsagent, thinking it might just be a faulty
    copy, I found his kiosk shuttered and boarded up, and daubed with the sign of
    the cross.

    Could all this be connected in some way to the dead Mr. Pyx and the quick Mrs.
    Pyx and their desire to obtain a map of Pointy Town? I had to concede the possibility.
    I determined, at once, standing in a puddle next to the abandoned kiosk, to pay
    Mrs. Pyx a visit and interrogate her, under Klieg lights if necessary. But then
    I realised that neither she nor her late husband had ever revealed their whereabouts.
    Like Pointy Town itself, she was unmapp''d, and I was lost.
