  text: 'Lomg-term Hooting Yard aficionados may recall that in the closing years of
    the last century I produced four or five calendars. Each of these had a specific
    theme, thus the 1992 Hooting Yard Calendar was entitled Accidental Deaths Of Twelve
    Cartographers, while its 1993 successor commemorated The Golden Days of the Bodger''s
    Spinney Variety Theatre. In 1994 I thought to illustrate a fictional work of fiction
    (Fangs In The Mist--a phrase stolen from J. P. Donleavy) and, in casting about
    within my bonce for a suitable name for the fictional author, I lit upon Chlorine
    Winslow. "Chlorine", it seemed to me, sounded like it might well have been a popular
    girl''s name in Victorian times, and I recall that I chuckled immoderately to
    myself having decided upon it.

    Now, years later, I discover this:

    Mrs [Leonora] Piper had become a medium in 1883. The thing had happened in the
    usual way--by contagion. She had been suffering from a tumour and had gone to
    visit a medium who gave medical consultations, but who also specialized in developing
    latent mediumship in others. At her first sitting Mrs Piper felt very agitated
    and thought she was going to faint. On the next occasion, the medium put his hands
    on her forehead. Once more she was on the point of losing consciousness. She saw
    a flood of light, unrecognisable faces, and a hand which fluttered before her
    own face. She then passed out. When she came to, although she could remember nothing,
    she was told that a young Indian girl named.,incredibly, Chlorine, had manifested
    through her and had given a remarkable proof of survival after death.

    Centuries by Ruth Brandon (Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1983).'
