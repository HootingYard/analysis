  text: 'Puny, neurasthenic Cadet Vig was on sentry duty outside Fort Hoity (4 points)
    when an angel of the Lord appeared unto him (12 points). Cadet Vig trembled in
    terror (2 points).

    The angel of the Lord appeared to be perplexed. It opened its ring-binder, and
    looked carefully at the weedy cadet, and then at its paperwork, and then at Cadet
    Vig again, and then back to its paperwork, and its brow furrowed. For the purposes
    of its earthly visitation, the angel had made use of a hole-punch and inserted
    all its papers into the ring-binder. Normally, when shimmering in its celestial
    halls, the angel had each individual sheet affixed to a wall with drawing-pins,
    the mass of papers spread out for visual oomph, as is the practice with serial
    killers in television dramas (6 points).

    "You are puny, neurasthenic, and outside a fort," said the angel, "It says here
    you should be stately, plump, and inside a martello tower."

    Cadet Vig did not know what to say in response, so he merely quaked (2 points).

    "Well, never mind." said the angel, slamming shut the ring-binder, "What fort
    is this?"

    "Fort Hoity," said Cadet Vig, truthfully.

    The angel reopened its ring-binder (1 point), rummaged through the papers, found
    the entry for Cadet Vig, and said, "According to my records you are meant on this
    day at this hour to be on sentry duty at Fort Toity" (8 points).

    Cadet Vig was on the point of swooning. His legs turned to jelly as he realised
    that, yet again, he had misread the duty roster. Captain Nitty would be furious
    (10 points)! The milksop cadet had an awful vision of months stretching ahead
    doing potato-peeling punishment. How long, he wondered, would it take him to cross
    the eerie marshes to Fort Toity? Could he get there before Captain Nitty discovered
    his mistake? He had a sudden bright idea.

    "Is it in your power," he asked the angel of the Lord, "To transport me instantaneously
    to the sentry post outside Fort Toity, far away across the eerie marshes, so I
    will not get into one of my pickles with Captain Nitty?"

    The angel once again consulted the contents of its ring-binder (6 points).

    "Yes," it said, eventually, "That is well within my power. But I am minded, instead,
    on this starry starry night, to shower you, Cadet Vig, with teeming thousands,
    nay millions, of points, more points than any cadet under Captain Nitty''s command
    has ever been awarded."

    Now Cadet Vig did swoon, He crumpled to the ground, next to the sentry box outside
    Fort Hoity. As he lay there, robbed of consciousness, innumerable golden shining
    points rained down upon him. And when he woke, the angel of the Lord had vanished,
    and stars glittered across the boundless firmament, and here, clanking towards
    him in full armour, came Captain Nitty, his face purple with rage, his eyes like
    burning coals (2 points), and Cadet Vig, for the first time in his puny life,
    was not afraid. He cocked his blunderbuss and took aim at Captain Nitty. He had
    millions of points!

    This story has accumulated a total of 53 points, if I have tallied them correctly.'
