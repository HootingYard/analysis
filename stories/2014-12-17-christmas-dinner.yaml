  text: 'Brit (of The Dabbler) wrote to ask me if, as one of the world''s leading
    ornithologists, I would be tucking into a bird-packed Christmas dinner next week.
    Specifically, he wondered if I might be tempted by Grimod de La Reyniere''s 1807
    concoction, the roti sans pareil. This is a bustard stuffed with a turkey stuffed
    with a goose stuffed with a pheasant stuffed with a chicken stuffed with a duck
    stuffed with a guinea fowl stuffed with a teal stuffed with a woodcock stuffed
    with a partridge stuffed with a plover stuffed with a lapwing stuffed with a quail
    stuffed with a thrush stuffed with a lark stuffed with an ortolan bunting stuffed
    with a garden warbler stuffed with an olive. The puckish gastronome did not actually
    recommend washing this down with a brimming tumbler of fresh warm starling''s
    blood, but that would be appropriate.

    This year, however, in an act of right-on cultural outreach to our non-Christian
    Middle Eastern chums, I think I will go for whole stuffed camel--the recipe for
    which you can see here (scroll down to the end if you wish to avoid some blather
    about Dobson and Marigold Chew and Charles Montagu Doughty).'
