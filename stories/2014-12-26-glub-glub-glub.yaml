  text: "I was exceedingly pleased to receive as a Christmas gift The New Annotated\
    \ H. P. Lovecraft, a splendid scholarly edition of selected works by the troubled\
    \ genius of Providence, Rhode Island. It is packed with informative footnotes,\
    \ but one was missing, so I am taking the opportunity to provide it here as an\
    \ addendum.\nAmong my favourite snippets of Lovecraft is this passage from The\
    \ Thing On The Doorstep. My footnote is appended.\nIt began with a telephone call\
    \ just before midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took down the receiver\
    \ in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up\
    \ and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other\
    \ end. Was someone trying under great difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought\
    \ I heard a sort of half-liquid bubbling noise\u2014\u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026\
    \ glub\u201D\u2014which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible\
    \ word and syllable divisions. I called \u201CWho is it?\u201D But the only answer\
    \ was \u201Cglub\u2026 glub\u2026 glub-glub.\u201D\nNOTE\_: In the early 1990s,\
    \ \u201CGlub \u2026 glub \u2026 glub\u201D was the recorded answerphone message\
    \ of Ed Baxter, benevolent despot of ResonanceFM."
