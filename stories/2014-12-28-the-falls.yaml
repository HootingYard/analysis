    of beef, birds, bitumen, blood, brick, and butter;

    of carbonate of soda, charcoal, cinders, coal, coffee beans, and coke;

    of fibres, fish, flesh, and flints;

    of hay;

    of ice, insects, and iron;

    of larvae, leaves, and lizards;

    of sands, seeds, silk, snakes, soot, spiderwebs, stones, and sulphur;
