  text: 'Hooting Yard devotee Alasdair Dickson saw a ghost. Fortunately, in spite
    of his terror, he had the presence of mind to take a snap, and he has donated
    the exposure to the Hooting Yard Spirit Photography Bank. Here it is. The spectral
    presence of a ghoulish phantom is clearly visible executing a woohoodiwoodiwoo
    manoeuvre behind an Edinburgh municipal bench.


    Speaking of ghosts, over the past few years I have read quite a few books on spiritualism
    and the paranormal in the Victorian era and the first half of the twentieth century.
    A striking feature of the material is that, almost invariably, mention is made
    of Harry Price. Wishing to discover more about the "veteran ghost-hunter" than
    was divulged in scattered references, I obtained a copy of Search For Harry Price
    by Trevor H. Hall (Duckworth, 1978). What a hoot! The book proves to be a sustained
    character assassination, demonstrating in forensic detail that Price was a liar
    and a fraud and a charlatan, not only in the field of ghost-hunting, but, earlier
    in his life, as a numismatist, archaeologist, and book-collector. It is a highly
    entertaining read, and I have not yet arrived at the part, promised in the preface,
    where Hall examines "the ridiculous Brocken affair ... the ''magical experiment''
    in the Harz Mountains in which a goat was supposed to change into a beautiful
    youth (which attracted some 800 press reports in over a dozen countries)". I will
    tell you all about that in due course.

    Hooting Yard Encyclopaedia topics addressed : ghosts, phantoms, spectres, wraiths,
    ghouls, woohoodiwoodiwoo manoeuvres, goat transformations, municipal benches.'
