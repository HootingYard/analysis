  text: 'On Thursday I remarked that it was hard to imagine a window made out of crows.
    Not for the first time, I was wrong--astonishingly so, given that ornithology
    is involved. But wrong nonetheless, as this letter from Poppy Nisbet makes clear.
    It plopped through the post all the way from the eastern United States:

    In the long ago I occasionally worked on local theatrical extravaganzas, my favorite
    being "Zeitgeist", an excruciating interpretation of Human Life from beginning
    to end. We, the perpetrators of this cultural maelstrom, took over the very small
    town hall in a very small town nearby. The building had a central front door and
    hallway flanked by two minuscule offices and leading to a large open room with
    a stage at the far end. As a preface to the main event onstage we made the offices
    into a birth room and a death room. It is the death room that requires description.

    The house I now live in had belonged to artists for a long time and the higgledy-piggledy
    remains of their art lives were still in the barn studio when I moved here. One
    of the artists was a portrait painter of subjects who all looked like characters
    from Agatha Christie. The studio was overflowing with petrified tubes of oil paint,
    bristle-free brushes, canvas stretchers, human bones, broken glass and empty frames,
    my favorite relics being paintings with the faces cut out and the rest of the
    image left intact. As a backdrop for the death room these edited portraits were
    hung on the walls above dead leaves piled high, so deep that people could only
    wade through them with difficulty. The resultant noise was full of memories.

    The room had a dilemma that demanded solving, a large window facing the parking
    lot. We felt that the evening trajectories of headlights would spoil the mood
    on the night of the performance so we cut silhouettes of flying crows out of a
    piece of black foam-core board and fitted it over the glass. A sheer curtain was
    hung over this on the inside, making the window amendments invisible in the general
    murk.

    The headlights swept through the birds like a fog beacon, flaring up for a moment
    and projecting distorted avian outlines onto the folds of the curtain and the
    floating dust of the leaves. It left a surging impression of flight that was surprisingly
    spooky. Even now, whenever I see crows I remember the motion of light in black
    bird shapes filling up a window.'
