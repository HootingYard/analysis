  text: "On Thursday I remarked that it was hard to imagine a window made out of crows.\
    \ Not for the first time, I was wrong\u2014astonishingly so, given that ornithology\
    \ is involved. But wrong nonetheless, as this letter from Poppy Nisbet makes clear.\
    \ It plopped through the post all the way from the eastern United States:\nIn\
    \ the long ago I occasionally worked on local theatrical extravaganzas, my favorite\
    \ being \u201CZeitgeist\u201D, an excruciating interpretation of Human Life from\
    \ beginning to end. We, the perpetrators of this cultural maelstrom, took over\
    \ the very small town hall in a very small town nearby. The building had a central\
    \ front door and hallway flanked by two minuscule offices and leading to a large\
    \ open room with a stage at the far end. As a preface to the main event onstage\
    \ we made the offices into a birth room and a death room. It is the death room\
    \ that requires description.\nThe house I now live in had belonged to artists\
    \ for a long time and the higgledy-piggledy remains of their art lives were still\
    \ in the barn studio when I moved here. One of the artists was a portrait painter\
    \ of subjects who all looked like characters from Agatha Christie. The studio\
    \ was overflowing with petrified tubes of oil paint, bristle-free brushes, canvas\
    \ stretchers, human bones, broken glass and empty frames, my favorite relics being\
    \ paintings with the faces cut out and the rest of the image left intact. As a\
    \ backdrop for the death room these edited portraits were hung on the walls above\
    \ dead leaves piled high, so deep that people could only wade through them with\
    \ difficulty. The resultant noise was full of memories.\nThe room had a dilemma\
    \ that demanded solving, a large window facing the parking lot. We felt that the\
    \ evening trajectories of headlights would spoil the mood on the night of the\
    \ performance so we cut silhouettes of flying crows out of a piece of black foam-core\
    \ board and fitted it over the glass. A sheer curtain was hung over this on the\
    \ inside, making the window amendments invisible in the general murk.\nThe headlights\
    \ swept through the birds like a fog beacon, flaring up for a moment and projecting\
    \ distorted avian outlines onto the folds of the curtain and the floating dust\
    \ of the leaves. It left a surging impression of flight that was surprisingly\
    \ spooky. Even now, whenever I see crows I remember the motion of light in black\
    \ bird shapes filling up a window."
