  text: "In her letter yesterday, Poppy Nisbet mentioned the decoration of the \u201C\
    Zeitgeist\u201D Death Room, consisting in part of portrait paintings (by Marjorie\
    \ Monroe) \u201Cof subjects who all looked like characters from Agatha Christie\u201D\
    \ from which \u201Cthe faces [were] cut out and the rest of the image left intact\u201D\
    . Ms Nisbet has now provided photographic evidence of what she is talking about,\
    \ so you lot can better appreciate the spookiness.\nLeft\_: intact portrait, Right\_\
    : wrecked portrait.\n"
