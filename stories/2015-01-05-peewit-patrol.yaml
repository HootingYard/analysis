  text: 'In spite of the example set by my older siblings, I was, as a child, reluctant
    to join an organised group such as the Boy Scouts or the Woodcraft Folk or the
    Young Pioneers or the Kibbo Kift. I kept myself to myself, content to lollop about
    in self-imposed solitude. All that changed, however, on the day when I was eight
    years old and I received an invitation to join Peewit Patrol.

    I had never heard of this little fraternity, so I was intrigued. Intriguing, too,
    was the invitation itself, which was delivered to my bedroom windowsill in the
    beak of a bird I supposed was a peewit. It took the form of a folded sheet of
    paper which, when extracted from the bird''s beak and unfolded, revealed a message
    which looked as if it had been scribbled in blood. "Come to the spinney at midnight,"
    it read, "Where you will be initiated into Peewit Patrol". It was unsigned.

    That night, I went up to bed at my usual time and pretended to be asleep. Excited
    and alert, I listened out for the sounds of my siblings and parents retiring for
    the night. When all was still, I crept out of bed, fashioned a rope ladder from
    my bedsheets, and let myself out through the window. The spinney was out on the
    edge of our bucolic--our idyllic--village, and I ran like the clappers to get
    there before midnight struck.

    I was puffed out when I arrived, and for a moment I thought someone had played
    a trick on me, as the spinney seemed to be deserted. But then, one by one, from
    behind clumps of trees, appeared several children, a dozen or so. At least, I
    thought they were children, they were all about my size, but I did not recognise
    any of them because their faces were concealed. Each wore a painted papier-mache
    helmet in the shape of a peewit''s head, roughly double the size of their own
    heads. From the neck down, they were dressed conventionally, save for a tabard
    and a sash. I gawped.

    One now stepped forward and greeted me. He explained that I was to be initiated
    into Peewit Patrol, a great honour, but one which I must keep secret. A bonfire
    was lit, and the children began to prance and caper in a circle around it, uttering
    shrill cries which may have been imitative of a peewit''s call. I was taken by
    the hand and pulled into the ring and did my best to prance and caper and shriek
    like the others. When we were all at the point of exhaustion, at a signal we stopped
    still. The circle regrouped, with me now at the centre.

    The child--if it was a child--who had first greeted me now made a long and frankly
    incoherent announcement. The gist of it, I was able to gather, was that I was
    to be welcomed into the fraternity of Peewit Patrol and I must swear to serve
    it with all my gumption. A bumper bottle of Squelcho!--a sort of fizzy pop--was
    opened and passed around, and each one took a swig before it was passed to me.
    I swigged, and swore. And then the tabard and the sash were draped over me, and
    the painted papier-mache peewit helmet was placed upon my head. I was a member
    of Peewit Patrol!

    And there and then I set off on my first patrol of the village perimeter, in the
    moonlight, sworn to protect the village from harm. We were each armed with a stick
    gathered from the spinney floor, and we marched slowly, keeping a watchful lookout
    through the apertures in our helmets. Occasionally one or other of my companions
    would make the shrill peewit cry.

    It was an exquisite thrill for me, who had been so solitary, to feel a sense of
    belonging--belonging to a secret, illicit band, but one which acted for the good
    of the village, unknown to the adult villagers. And the thrill was never more
    exquisite than on those nights when we came upon a vagrant or a beggar or somebody
    who looked a bit funny, and we swooped down upon them in a terrible flock, beating
    them savagely with our sticks, and, when they were crumpled and helpless on the
    ground, we fell upon them, pecking at them in a frenzy with the razorblades embedded
    in our papier-mache beaks, saving the village from outsiders who would do us harm.
    Happy days!'
