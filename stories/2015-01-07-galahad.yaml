  text: 'In the long ago, I was a quiet and well-behaved child, and I rarely got into
    trouble. There was one occasion, however, when I caused something of a hoo-hah
    at my primary school. I did not think then, nor do I think now, that I did anything
    wrong. But I was reprimanded, and my mother was called to take me home, and for
    the remainder of my time at the school I was considered a "bad egg". The burning
    sense of injustice I felt half a century ago has stayed with me, and it is fair
    to say it has cast a pall over my life.

    It so happened that one wet afternoon our teacher Mrs Screech--I think she was
    related to M. A. Screech, the editor of many Penguin Classics and author of Laughter
    At The Foot Of The Cross--asked the class to talk about our pets. One by one my
    little schoolmates stood up and said things like "I have a cat named Tiddles"
    or "I have a dog called Scamp. He is a collie".

    When it was my turn, I stood up, took a matchbox out of my pocket, and said, "I
    have brought my pet with me. He is a pismire and his name is Galahad," and I opened
    the matchbox and let Galahad skitter about on my desk. For this innocent act,
    I was reprimanded and taken home and ever after seen as a bad egg and a troublemaker
    and a wretched, wretched boy. I was told that the word "pismire" was unseemly
    and that I was frightening the other children by letting a creepy-crawly loose
    in the classroom. There were other offences, apparently, a long list of them,
    all bound up in that single incident.

    But Galahad was my pet, and he was a pismire. I cannot recall when I discovered
    that "pismire" was an archaic term for "ant", but as soon as I heard it I knew
    it was suitable for Galahad. He was fully deserving of two syllables. He was a
    valiant little ant, and a loyal one. Every night, before I went to bed, I would
    take him out of the matchbox and put him in the garden so he could run about with
    all the other ants, and when I went to collect him in the morning he was always
    there, with his teeming hundreds or even thousands of fellows, and I would pick
    him up and put him in his matchbox and plop it into my pocket. It may be that
    Galahad was not precisely the same ant every day, though it was hard to tell,
    and I tried not to bother my little head about it. If he was the same ant, as
    I like to think, then he is extraordinarily long-lived, for an ant, as I still
    have him in a matchbox in my pocket as I write these words, fifty years after
    the burning injustice which has cast a pall over my life. It is a pall only lifted
    by Galahad himself. During our long and intense conversations, conducted in the
    language of ants, punctuated by screeching, he offers me solace and consolation.
    He is my pismire pal.'
