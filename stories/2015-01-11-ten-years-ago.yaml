  text: 'Hooting Yard has now been a presence on what Tony Blair and I like to call
    the Information Superhighway for more than a decade. It is an arresting thought
    that the site has existed for a longer period of time than that required by a
    Jesuit to completely brainwash a child. This startling fact prompts two further
    thoughts, today. First, I am minded to add a slogan to that red rectangle at the
    top, saying "Dispensing prose to hoi polloi since 2003". Second, that on a day
    such as this, when my brain is empty, I can hark back ten years and repost something
    from so long ago that it is unlikely any of you lot will remember it. I certainly
    don''t. Exactly ten years ago, on 11 January 2005, this piece appeared under the
    unwieldy title First Spruce, Now Rusty And Squalid. For this reappearance I have
    taken the opportunity to insert a few paragraph breaks to make for easier reading.
    I am sure you can think of a way to show your gratitude for such thoughtfulness.

    Consider that fall. One day, you are spry, preening and spruce. Then, knocked
    sideways, cast down, become rusty and squalid. How does it happen? Is there a
    moment, a split second, when jauntiness turns to sackcloth and ashes? What would
    your journal read?

    Eleven a.m. : o! such bliss and splendour! How blessed am I to be among the animate
    and quick.

    Eleven o one a.m.: Ach! Does earth harbour a wretch as miserable as I, one who
    crumbles in despair and is fit only to slither in the muck with the worms?

    How are we to make sense of such a catastrophic change? Crystal balls may help
    seers and soothsayers see into the future, but is it true, as some say, that we
    can make sense of the present by staring long and intently with our eyes wide
    open at the surface of a muddy pond over by Bodger''s Spinney? And not any of
    the ponds there, just one, the most brackish of the ponds, the one which is inky
    black and fathomless. What will we see on the surface of that pond if we stare
    at it long enough?

    I will tell you. Ignore the flies and mosquitoes and the mutant tadpoles that
    occasionally disturb the water, and sooner or later, you will be able to discern,
    dimly at first, but with increasing clarity, the incredible face of the Psychopond
    Dweller, shimmering, gaunt, bewitched and bewitching, and its expression will
    reveal to you the meaning of neither past nor future but of the present moment,
    radical, decisive and, like the cockles and mussels in the old song, alive, alive-oh.'
