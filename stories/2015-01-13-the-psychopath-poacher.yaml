  text: 'A letter plops onto the mat from Tim Thurn:

    Ahoy there, Mr Key! I could not help noticing, in your piece yesterday about Satan
    the little bunny rabbit, that you clearly were at a loss how to bring your trifling
    bagatelle to a close, hence the introduction, at the close, of a psychopath-poacher
    who was able to wrap things up in short order. It is not, however, this rather
    desperate bit of fol-de-rol that bothers me. Of more concern is that nowhere do
    you acknowledge that you have stolen this character from the much-loved writer
    of pulp fiction Ned Peasant. In the 1920s and 30s, his tales of rustic violence
    featuring the psychopath-poacher appeared in dozens of cheap sensational magazines,
    among them Tales Of Rustic Violence. Thrilling Yarns Of Deranged Peasantry, and
    Countryside Psychosis Weekly, to name but three. It pains me to accuse you of
    brazen plagiarism, Mr Key, but sadly that is what I must do. I will be pinning
    up an accusatory notice to that effect in my local community hub later today.
    You will not be welcome in my village, should it ever enter your head to pay us
    a visit. Yours more in sorrow than in anger, for once, Tim Thurn.

    Now, Tim will find this hard to believe, but I insist that I have never, ever
    heard of Ned Peasant nor his pulp writings. I somehow arrived at the figure of
    the psychopath-poacher independently. Perhaps it was one of those weird and curious
    happenstances that have no rational explanation, like psychic forewarnings of
    calamity, or showers of toads, or the existence of Russell Brand.

    However, taking my cue from Tim, I did some research, and was delighted to stumble
    upon a crate full of yellowing dog-eared copies of pulp magazines in one of my
    cupboards. Sure enough, I found that Ned Peasant had contributed to most if not
    all of the titles. I read through his stories avidly, in one sitting. They included
    "The Psychopath-Poacher Slaughters A Badger" (Violent Rustic Antics, Vol. XX,
    No. 7. July 1922), "The Psychopath-Poacher Slaughters Several Badgers And A Duck"
    (Bucolic Mayhem, Vol. CXIV, No. 2, February 1928), and "The Psychopath-Poacher
    Goes Haywire Near A Haystack And Slaughters Hundreds Of Badgers, Several Ducks,
    And A Vanbrugh Chicken " (Tales Of Blood-Drenched Enormities In The Countryside,
    Vol. MMCXVIII, No, 12, Christmas 1934), to name but three.

    In my defence, I have to say that my own psychopath-poacher bears scant resemblance
    to the vivid and timeless fictional character created by Ned Peasant. Nowhere,
    for example, does Ned''s original gather a sprig of buttercups for his lady-love.
    Indeed, he does not seem to have a lady-love at all. There is, it is true, a recurring
    character called Bonkers Maisie, who appears to do various bits of drudgery in
    a farmyard, but it is never suggested that there is anything between her and the
    psychopath-poacher save for a shared joy in drinking the still-warm blood of freshly
    decapitated poultry--see for example "The Psychopath-Poacher And Bonkers Maisie
    Tamper With The Farmyard Spigot So That From It Spurts The Still-Warm Blood Of
    Freshly Decapitated Poultry" (The Weekly Digest Of Fictional Farmyard Spigot Tamperings,
    Vol. MMDCCCXIX, No. 4, Easter 1937).

    I have been trying to discover biographical details of Ned Peasant, with little
    success. One rumour, which must surely be spurious, is that late in life he was
    engulfed in a miasmic cloud of mysterious gas, shrunk to microscopic size, and
    after wafting about in the wind for some years was eventually pocketed by Walter
    Mad, the mad scientist, who injected him into the brain of a mewling infant in
    a Barking maternity ward at the tail end of the 1950s. Poppycock, no doubt.'
