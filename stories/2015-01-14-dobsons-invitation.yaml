  text: 'In the autumn of his years, Dobson received a letter asking him to contribute
    to a symposium. Such invitations were rare for the out of print pamphleteer, and
    he became unreasonably overexcited. Unable to think clearly, he wolfed down his
    breakfast and went for a brisk walk along the towpath of the old canal, shouting
    and chucking pebbles at swans. When he arrived home, sopping wet from the torrential
    downpour, he reread the letter. Apparently, what the sender called his "unique
    insight" would be welcomed for a symposium on The Importance Of The Cummerbund
    As A New Romantic Signifier, With Particular Reference To Spandau Ballet.

    Dobson had questions, but unfortunately his inamorata Marigold Chew, who he felt
    sure would know about these things, was off on a week-long gallivant. The pamphleteer
    had a vague idea what a cummerbund was, but that was about all of the symposium
    title he understood. He knew a bit about the Romantics, but what was a "New Romantic"?
    What exactly was meant by a "signifier"? And, most befuddling of all, was there
    really a ballet troupe resident at Spandau prison in Berlin, and if not, what
    on earth did the two words, thus conjoined, refer to? These were his questions.

    As he pored over the invitation, Dobson felt his excitement bubbling up again.
    He could barely recall when last he had been invited to anything, let alone an
    important symposium. Leaving the unanswered questions to waft in the mists of
    fuddle, he dashed off a letter of acceptance, not forgetting to ask that his bus
    fare be paid and a cup of tea provided. Then he crashed back out into the rain
    to buy a stamp at the post office and to plop his reply into a letterbox.

    On his way home along one of the less salubrious boulevards of Pointy Town, it
    occurred to Dobson that the answers to his questions could conceivably be common
    knowledge among the riffraff. It would not be the first time he discovered that
    things of which he was wholly ignorant were known by the most wretched and unsightly
    specimens of the lower orders. A gruesome little twerp, for example, had once
    vouchsafed to the pamphleteer not only the names of the four Liverpudlian moptops,
    but also told him which one wore spectacles and was married to an avant-garde
    Japanese performance artist. This information had proved invaluable when Dobson
    came to write his pamphlet Several Anagrams Of OO NOOKY, Informed By My Unique
    Insight Into Popular Culture (out of print).

    So it was that the pamphleteer buttonholed a number of hoi polloi in the street,
    shouting at them about romanticism and signifiers and ballet in German prisons.
    But by now the torrential rain had grown rainier and more torrential, and all
    those whose help Dobson sought swept past him, pausing only to curse or spit or
    kick. When eventually he made it home he was none the wiser.

    Dobson sat at his escritoire for hours, pencil poised over a blank sheet of paper.
    He was at a loss. Then he had a brainwave. He would go to the symposium and extemporize!
    So long as he included the key words, repeatedly, in whatever he said, he felt
    sure he could carry it off. Had not Laurence Olivier done the same when performing
    Shakespeare, babbling nonsense occasionally just to amuse himself and to disconcert
    the rest of the cast? And after all, this was an academic symposium, when nothing
    anybody said would make the slightest bit of sense anyway. Dobson tossed his pencil
    aside and went to slump in an armchair, gazing out of the window at crows in the
    rain.

    The day before the symposium, a further letter arrived from the organisers.

    Dear Dobson, it read, I am afraid we are unable to pay your bus fare and cannot
    provide you with a cup of tea. We are therefore withdrawing your invitation. Toodle
    pip.

    In the spring and summer of his years, a younger Dobson would have parlayed this
    crushing disappointment into a pamphlet of sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose.
    Now, he merely slumped at his escritoire, moaning and weeping, for days on end,
    until Marigold Chew came home.
