  text: 'Next time you go for a stroll along the Appian Way, take a pair of shears
    with you. Then, if you happen to encounter a hairy slave hurrying along, you can
    seize him and chop off his hair with the shears. When his bare scalp is revealed
    you will be able to read the secret message tattooed upon his bonce, previously
    hidden by his luxuriant bouffant. The message will be intended for a distant military
    general or potentate. Commit it to memory. You are now in possession of important
    and privileged information, and knowledge is power.

    Continue along the Appian Way until you reach the the encampment of the general
    or the palace of the potentate. Being neither hairy, nor a slave, nobody will
    suspect you of being the carrier of the secret information. You can use this to
    your advantage in all sorts of ways.

    Next week, in Hints And Tips For Ancient Romans, we will look at how you can influence
    the prognostications of a haruspex by tampering with the hot entrails of a freshly-slaughtered
    chicken.'
