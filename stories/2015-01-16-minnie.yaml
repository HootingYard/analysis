  text: 'The writing was on the wall for Minnie Menetekelupharsin.

    This is the opening line of a piece called Belshazzar''s Feast. So far it is the
    only line I have written, as I am not sure it has anywhere to go. I am posting
    it here in case anybody wishes to use it as a gag at an Old Testament standup
    comedy night.'
