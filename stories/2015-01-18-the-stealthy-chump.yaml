  text: "I am very much looking forward to the new 26-part television drama The Stealthy\
    \ Chump, which begins next week. Previews have not been available, but a few details\
    \ have been leaked to the press. Very few, actually\u2014the title, the number\
    \ of episodes, and the basic premise. I have told you the first two, so let me\
    \ now move on, wings unfurled, to the third.\nThe Stealthy Chump centres around\
    \ a chump who is stealthy. Each week, the chump tries to use his talent for stealthiness\
    \ in some way, for example creeping unseen through a cemetery after dark, or lurking\
    \ next to a pillar box on an important thoroughfare, or taking part in a jewel\
    \ heist. But, as the series title indicates, while he is indubitably stealthy,\
    \ he is also a chump. Being a chump, each week he manages to sabotage his own\
    \ stealthiness by making the sort of idiotic decision only a dyed in the wool\
    \ chump would make. So, when creeping unseen through a cemetery after dark he\
    \ carries with him a box of fireworks which, through cackhandedness with a box\
    \ of matches, he manages to ignite all at once, thus drawing attention to himself\
    \ with lots of sparkly whizzes and bangs. When lurking next to a pillar box on\
    \ an important thoroughfare, he wears a hat with a giant propeller on it, and\
    \ the wind picks up and spins the propeller blades around and the stealthy chump\
    \ finds himself hovering a few feet off the ground, making passers-by gawp. When\
    \ taking part in a jewel heist, he carries a box of fireworks and wears his propeller-hat\
    \ at the same time, with predictable results.\nI hope I have not given the impression\
    \ that The Stealthy Chump is a comedy. On the contrary, by all accounts it is\
    \ the sort of drama invariably described as \u201Cgritty\u201D. What this means\
    \ is that it is set in the north of England where the rainfall is incessant, several\
    \ characters scowl and swear a lot, and nobody ever smiles\u2014not even the stealthy\
    \ chump himself.\nI suggested above that the title character was dyed in the wool,\
    \ and this is literally the case. Each week, the stealthy chump wears an item\
    \ of knitwear, and the dye that has been used to colour the wool has also coloured\
    \ the stealthy chump from head to toe. As all his knitwear is dyed in brash and\
    \ gaudy blues and pinks and yellows, the fact that his head is the same colour\
    \ means he finds it even more difficult to be inconspicuous and stealthy, and\
    \ is thus even more of a chump.\nThe Stealthy Chump was filmed entirely on location\
    \ in a municipal car park. No animals were harmed in the making of the series,\
    \ except for some ants and beetles and other creepy-crawlies, and an unfortunate\
    \ trumpeter swan that was in the wrong place at the wrong time."
