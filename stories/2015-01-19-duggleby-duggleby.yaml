  text: "Duggleby, Duggleby, scrim and scraw,\nFait accompli, monkey's paw.\n  Wicker\
    \ basket, cloister, hearth,\n  The benefits of an electric bath.\n  Duggleby's\
    \ lantern, Duggleby's tent,\n  Who knows where Van Hooften went?\n  Lumbar puncture,\
    \ lumber yard,\n  Janissary, janitor, sentry, guard,\n  Cuxhaven diphthongs and\
    \ candy floss,\n  This paint's matt, that paint's gloss.\n  One must not forget\
    \ emulsion\n  Nor attraction and repulsion.\n  Magnets! Magnets! Hopes and fears\n\
    \  And a pair of gardening shears.\n  He is still wet behind the ears\n  This\
    \ rag will mop up all his tears.\n  Duggleby went to Banbury Cross\n  But he didn't\
    \ give a toss.\n  Crocus, marigold, fuchsia, egg.\n  Two-nil down in the second\
    \ leg.\n  This paint's blue, that paint's pink.\n  Duggleby collapsed on the skating\
    \ rink.\n  Van Hooften planned an imperial spree,\n  Mumbled threats, scrim and\
    \ scree.\n  Is there a doctor in the house?\n  The grunt, the groan, the pang,\
    \ the grouse,\n  The mordant herons on the bank\n  Oh the chains, the chains they\
    \ clank.\n  Liposuction, fol de rol,\n  Cutting capers, eyeless doll.\n  Creeping\
    \ past the graveyard tombs,\n  Distant gunfire, distant booms.\n  Squelchy pig\
    \ boy, guttersnipe,\n  Linctus, soup, Gepetto's pipe.\n  He has a jug but I have\
    \ none.\n  Ah--he flew too near the sun.\n  That is why his jug is cracked.\n\
    \  Now we are ready for the final act.\n  Duggleby darned the curtains well.\n\
    \  Lilac scattered on tortoiseshell.\n  Notwithstanding Cav and Pag\n  He kept\
    \ them in his pippy bag.\n  Duggleby, Duggleby, move along,\n  That's the end\
    \ of the Duggleby song."
