  text: 'A letter arrives from Sophonisba Gullsbeak:

    Dear Mr Key, I am writing to ask for your help. I have been commissioned by an
    important publishing house to compile A Dictionary Of Fruit-Related Popular Music
    Nomenclature. It has all been going swimmingly, but at the letter P I have reached
    an impasse. It has proved beyond my considerable wit to discover from what type
    of fruit the legendary Pips who accompanied soul singer Gladys Knight were eked.
    It goes without saying that readers of my dictionary will expect chapter and verse
    on this one, and the book would prove a sorry specimen indeed if it did not include
    this crucially important information. Given the astounding depth and breadth of
    your erudition in oh! so many spheres, it occurred to me that you could well be
    in possession of the pip-facts, daddy-o, as the young persons might say. I would
    be immensely grateful if you could tell me, by return of post, the answer to my
    query, with references if possible. Yours pleadingly, Sophonisba Gullsbeak (Miss).

    I am afraid to say that I haven''t got a clue. Dobson, the titanic pamphleteer
    of the twentieth century, compiled a similar Dictionary Of Fruit- And Nut-Related
    Jazz And Blues Nomenclature (out of print), but the soul music of Gladys Knight
    And The Pips fell outwith his frame of reference. All I can suggest is that perhaps
    you obtain high-definition photographic enlargements of the pips of every fruit-with-pips
    you can think of, and then compare these with photographs of the Pips. It is possible
    you might be able to note certain striking resemblances. Of course, it is equally
    possible you might not.

    By the way, I cannot help wondering if you, like your namesake Sophonisba Peale,
    daughter of the American painter, soldier, scientist, inventor, politician, and
    naturalist Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827) have three brothers named Raphael,
    Rembrandt, and Rubens. Do let me know.'
