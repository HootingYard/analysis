  text: "A letter arrives from Sophonisba Gullsbeak:\nDear Mr Key, I am writing to\
    \ ask for your help. I have been commissioned by an important publishing house\
    \ to compile A Dictionary Of Fruit-Related Popular Music Nomenclature. It has\
    \ all been going swimmingly, but at the letter P I have reached an impasse. It\
    \ has proved beyond my considerable wit to discover from what type of fruit the\
    \ legendary Pips who accompanied soul singer Gladys Knight were eked. It goes\
    \ without saying that readers of my dictionary will expect chapter and verse on\
    \ this one, and the book would prove a sorry specimen indeed if it did not include\
    \ this crucially important information. Given the astounding depth and breadth\
    \ of your erudition in oh! so many spheres, it occurred to me that you could well\
    \ be in possession of the pip-facts, daddy-o, as the young persons might say.\
    \ I would be immensely grateful if you could tell me, by return of post, the answer\
    \ to my query, with references if possible. Yours pleadingly, Sophonisba Gullsbeak\
    \ (Miss).\nI am afraid to say that I haven't got a clue. Dobson, the titanic pamphleteer\
    \ of the twentieth century, compiled a similar Dictionary Of Fruit- And Nut-Related\
    \ Jazz And Blues Nomenclature (out of print), but the soul music of Gladys Knight\
    \ And The Pips fell outwith his frame of reference. All I can suggest is that\
    \ perhaps you obtain high-definition photographic enlargements of the pips of\
    \ every fruit-with-pips you can think of, and then compare these with photographs\
    \ of the Pips. It is possible you might be able to note certain striking resemblances.\
    \ Of course, it is equally possible you might not.\nBy the way, I cannot help\
    \ wondering if you, like your namesake Sophonisba Peale, daughter of the American\
    \ painter, soldier, scientist, inventor, politician, and naturalist Charles Willson\
    \ Peale (1741\u20131827) have three brothers named Raphael, Rembrandt, and Rubens.\
    \ Do let me know."
