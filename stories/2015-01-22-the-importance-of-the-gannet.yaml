  text: 'According to a six-DVD set on the subject of British Birds made by the ornithologist
    Paul Doherty, the gannet is "the most pointy bird to be found in Britain".

    I am indebted to Andy Martin for bringing this critically important information
    to my attention. Mr Martin adds: "I wish to pass a motion that the gannet be adopted
    as the official emblem of Pointy Town, to appear on any heraldic designs, flags,
    and stationery". I think we can consider that carried, nem. con.
