  text: "According to a six-DVD set on the subject of British Birds made by the ornithologist\
    \ Paul Doherty, the gannet is \u201Cthe most pointy bird to be found in Britain\u201D\
    .\nI am indebted to Andy Martin for bringing this critically important information\
    \ to my attention. Mr Martin adds: \u201CI wish to pass a motion that the gannet\
    \ be adopted as the official emblem of Pointy Town, to appear on any heraldic\
    \ designs, flags, and stationery\u201D. I think we can consider that carried,\
    \ nem. con.\n\nThe gannet\_: exceedingly pointy"
