  text: "Last night I dreamed I was a passenger in a minibus. I was accompanied by\
    \ several old friends from years ago and by Quakers. For reasons never explicit,\
    \ everybody in the minibus thoroughly disapproved of me. My sense of this was\
    \ vivid and distressing, and I was very glad to wake from it.\nI told Pansy Cradledew\
    \ I had had a bad dream. \u201CI was the subject of disapproval,\u201D I said.\
    \ She laughed. \u201CWhen people say they have bad dreams you expect them to say\
    \ \u2018I was terrified\u2019 or something similar. But no, you were merely subject\
    \ to disapproval.\u201D She found this highly amusing.\nLater I was able to reflect\
    \ that things could be much worse. I learned that Auberon Waugh's maternal grandfather\
    \ was told by a foolish friend that a guaranteed cure for blindness was to have\
    \ all of one's teeth removed. He arranged for this to be done, contracted blood\
    \ poisoning as a result, and died at the age of 43."
