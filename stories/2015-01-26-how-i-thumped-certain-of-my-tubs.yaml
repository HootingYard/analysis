  text: 'In his posthumously published essay How I Wrote Certain Of My Books, Raymond
    Roussel explained the methods he used to compose the works which, he was confident,
    would guarantee him immortality, such that "my fame will outshine that of Victor
    Hugo or Napoleon". It was perhaps with the same ambition in mind that the itinerant
    Bible-bashing tub-thumping fire-and- brimstone preacherman Napkin Linseed paraphrased
    the title for his memoir How I Thumped Certain Of My Tubs. Happily, it was published
    while he was still alive.

    Linseed is an attractive figure, if one is attracted to rakishly thin black-clad
    figures of decidedly corvine countenance who discern the foul besmirchment of
    mortal sin everywhere they look. His personality comes across with striking force
    in his memoir, a book as fat as he was lean. In it, he describes in fascinating
    detail how he devised his tub-thumping method, though he has less to say about
    the bashing of Bibles. The book is highly recommended to any reader who wishes
    to embark upon their own tub-thumping practice, as Linseed gives chapter and verse
    on the procurement and preparation of tubs, the most effective ways to transport
    them--one slung on either side of a horse''s shanks--and, of course, various approaches
    to thumping guaranteed to both deafen and terrify one''s audience, if, of course,
    one manages to attract an audience. Often enough, this was the missing element
    in Linseed''s preaching tours. The memoir contains innumerable descriptions of
    the author standing in a rainswept field, thumping his tubs and bashing his Bibles
    and hurling damnable imprecations at nobody save for the occasional passing cow
    or goat. It is perhaps his most attractive feature that Linseed never allowed
    himself to be discouraged by the widespread lack of interest shown in his preaching.
    He simply kept on going, like a swordfish spearing the briny deep.

    I use that somewhat ungainly analogy in homage to Napkin Linseed himself, who
    deploys it repeatedly in his memoir. In some instances it appears several times
    in a single paragraph, and in general the paragraphs themselves are fairly short
    and snappy--certainly shorter and snappier than in his only other published work,
    How I Bashed Certain Of My Bibles.

    At time of writing, Napoleon''s fame probably outshines Victor Hugo''s, Hugo''s
    outshines Raymond Roussel''s, and Roussel''s outshines Napkin Linseed''s. But
    who is to say that, in a thousand years'' time, the order may not be reversed?'
