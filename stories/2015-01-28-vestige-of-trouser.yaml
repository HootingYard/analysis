  text: I once drew a picture of a vestige of trouser. As I recall, it was intended
    as one of a series of clues in a detective story which, I also recall, was never
    actually written. The plotting of a proper detective story always seemed to me
    outwith the range of whatever talents I possess. This is a pity, as I would like
    few things better than to write a cracking whodunnit, one that leaves the reader
    guessing until the very final paragraph, and, thereafter, gawping open-mouthed,
    with perhaps a trail of drool slowly descending from their lower lip, maintaining
    that stunned stillness for several minutes before regaining their wits. I can
    think of several books I have read, over the years, which have left me in such
    a state, and not all of them were whodunnits. Nor, if I tally them up in my poor
    memory, did any of them contain, anywhere within them, a vestige of trouser. After
    all, in fiction as in life, we usually encounter trousers whole, do we not? So
    I am sure I would remember a book with a vestige of trouser in it, just as I remember
    a pen-and-ink drawing I made, about thirty years ago, of such a thing. What I
    do not know is why that drawing has come bubbling to the surface of my brain today
    of all days. Perhaps, in some world or universe running parallel with this one,
    today is Vestige of Trouser Day, and faint signals from that world or universe
    have unaccountably pierced the fabric of my own world. But that smacks of science
    fiction, not detective fiction, and I always think it best to draw a veil over
    the conjectures of science fiction. When I say "draw a veil", I do not mean draw
    a picture of a veil, as I once drew a picture of a vestige of trouser. I am using
    a different sense of the word "draw". But you knew that, and did not need me to
    tell you, which makes me wonder why I am still prattling on, pointlessly, when
    I might be better occupied gawping, open-mouthed, stunned and still, with drool
    falling from my lips.
