  text: "Peter Blegvad, from \u201CThe Unborn Byron\u201D:\nSpread the word, tomorrow\
    \ morn\n  A future poet shall be born.\n  From my mother I shall fall\n  Into\
    \ the womb that holds us all.\n  My life shall be a meteor\n  Which generations\
    \ shall adore.\n  For my unbuttoned liberty\n  The unborn will remember me.\n\
    Mr Key, from \u201CThe Tiny Newborn Mr Key\u201D:\n1959, this very morn\n  The\
    \ tiny Mr Key was born\n  He was a full month premature\n  When he knocked his\
    \ fist upon the door\n  Of the world beyond his mother's womb\n  A tiny bright\
    \ spark in the gloom\n  And soon the words poured out of him\n  They pour out\
    \ still, with ceaseless vim."
