  text: "Peter Blegvad, from \"The Unborn Byron\":\nSpread the word, tomorrow morn\n\
    \  A future poet shall be born.\n  From my mother I shall fall\n  Into the womb\
    \ that holds us all.\n  My life shall be a meteor\n  Which generations shall adore.\n\
    \  For my unbuttoned liberty\n    The unborn will remember me.\nMr Key, from \"\
    The Tiny Newborn Mr Key\":\n1959, this very morn\n  The tiny Mr Key was born\n\
    \  He was a full month premature\n  When he knocked his fist upon the door\n \
    \ Of the world beyond his mother's womb\n  A tiny bright spark in the gloom\n\
    \  And soon the words poured out of him\n  They pour out still, with ceaseless\
    \ vim."
