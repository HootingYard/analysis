  text: "Clint Eastwood's new film American Snipe has broken box-office records in\
    \ its first week on release. It is quite an achievement for the octogenarian director,\
    \ the more so, perhaps, given its ornithological theme. American Snipe tells the\
    \ true story of a snipe with a record number of kills. The film follows the bird\
    \ as it flies around, swooping down to catch and gobble up crane flies, horse\
    \ flies, deer flies, beetles, dragonflies, crickets, grasshoppers, ants, mayflies,\
    \ butterflies, caddis flies and moths. No explicit moral judgements are made,\
    \ though at one point an ornithologist, observing the slaughter, remarks \u201C\
    They're just insects\u201D.\nThe film has provoked controversy in the United States,\
    \ winning plaudits from right-wingers while those on the liberal left have condemned\
    \ it for painting a picture of unalloyed avian savagery, instead of showing nature\
    \ as twee and cuddly.\nThe role of the American snipe is played by an award-winning\
    \ snipe with a particularly long slender pointy bill.\n"
