  text: 'When I was first invited to present a show on ResonanceFM, way back in 2004,
    my immediate enthusiasm was tempered by a certain anxiety. I was fretful that
    perhaps I did not have a "radio voice", and that, as soon as I was stuck in front
    of a microphone, I would screech like a screech-owl. Listeners would lunge towards
    the off-button, desperate to stop the hideous caterwauling and lapse into blessed
    silence. So before accepting the offer, I took myself off to an elocutionist.

    Miss Blossom Christsblood''s establishment was on the top floor of a tall and
    ramshackle and quite possibly condemned building in an insalubrious part of town.
    It did not enjoy a lift, and by the time I had lugged myself up the stairs I was
    breathless and panting. Before she even said hello, Miss Blossom was intent on
    exacting payment from me, in cash, for my first lesson. I emptied my pockets of
    coinage, which she immediately squirrelled away in what looked like a battered
    tobacco tin.

    I was given to understand that my lesson would begin when I stopped panting, which
    I duly did several minutes later. During this time, Miss Blossom paid no attention
    to me whatsoever, but busied herself with her birds, innumerable birds housed
    in innumerable birdcages hanging from innumerable rafters. I am no ornithologist,
    but I think at least one of them was a screech-owl.

    Eventually my lesson began.

    "When speaking aloud," announced Miss Blossom, in a screech, "The most important
    thing is the formation of the vole sounds."

    It was at this point I decided to cut my losses and leave. Over a decade has passed
    since that unfortunate episode. In that time, I have continued to present Hooting
    Yard On The Air every week, with the occasional lacuna, and I do not think that
    at any time I have found it necessary to imitate the sound of a vole, nor a beaver,
    nor a shrew, nor even an otter.'
