  text: "Dear Bonkers Maisie, thou art so fair.\n  Blind beetles scuttle through your\
    \ hair,\n  That unwashed tangle atop your head\n  Wherein's your brain, poisoned\
    \ by lead.\nYou breathed in oh so many fumes\n  And now the gleam of madness looms\n\
    \  Behind your eyes, or rather eye,\n  As you muck out the filthy pig sty.\n'Twas\
    \ a pig took out the eye that's missing\n  When we were in the pig sty kissing\n\
    \  An idyll I shall ne'er forget.\n  The day was windy, cold, and wet.\nBut all\
    \ days are, in this rustic hell.\n  Oh Bonkers Maisie, my countryside belle!\n\
    \  They locked you up in the potting shed.\n  Poisoned by lead, poisoned by lead."
