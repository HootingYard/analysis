  text: "When James Newell Osterberg Jr was a tiny infant, he was fed on a diet of\
    \ mashed up pap made from eggs. It was the piquant memory of these slops that\
    \ informed his later decision, when embarking upon a career as a musical performer,\
    \ to adopt the pseudonym Eggy Pap. A typographic error\u2014or rather two typographic\
    \ errors\u2014rendered the name differently on the label of his first vinyl waxing.\
    \ Deploying one of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies avant la lettre, Osterberg determined\
    \ to \u201Chonour [his] error as a hidden intention\u201D, and retained the inaccurate\
    \ pseudonym throughout his subsequent career."
