  text: When James Newell Osterberg Jr was a tiny infant, he was fed on a diet of
    mashed up pap made from eggs. It was the piquant memory of these slops that informed
    his later decision, when embarking upon a career as a musical performer, to adopt
    the pseudonym Eggy Pap. A typographic error--or rather two typographic errors--rendered
    the name differently on the label of his first vinyl waxing. Deploying one of
    Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies avant la lettre, Osterberg determined to "honour
    [his] error as a hidden intention", and retained the inaccurate pseudonym throughout
    his subsequent career.
