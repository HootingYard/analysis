  text: "Long, long ago, my friend Phil and I decided to make our fortunes in the\
    \ music business. Lacking the ability to sing or to play an instrument, we determined\
    \ to be managers. We envisaged ourselves as a pair of Svengalis, with a stable\
    \ of artists who would conquer the charts, allowing us to retire to Bransonian\
    \ tropical islands before our thirtieth birthdays.\nHow could things possibly\
    \ go wrong?, we thought, considering the first bands on our roster. There was\
    \ Snakewizard, a generic heavy metal band of no great originality\u2014but then,\
    \ originality is the last thing the punters want in a heavy metal group. We would\
    \ help them along with song lyrics, but otherwise leave them to practise their\
    \ deafening din and grow their hair.\nThe important thing was to have a broad\
    \ range of artists, covering different markets. Snakewizard took care of the heavy\
    \ metal fans, and our second group\u2014The Toofles\u2014appealed to a wholly\
    \ different audience. The Toofles were essentially a novelty band for pre-teens,\
    \ not unlike The Wombles. Their songs had no artistic merit whatsoever but, we\
    \ thought, would be wildly popular with the tinies.\nThe fatal flaw in our scheme,\
    \ and the reason that the Bransonian islands remained forever out of reach, was\
    \ that neither Snakewizard nor The Toofles ever existed outside our pulsating\
    \ greedy brains. They were only ever figments of our imagination \u2026 where\
    \ they remain lodged, now grown old and grey, and without a back catalogue\u2014\
    or indeed any catalogue at all\u2014to fall back on.\nThey are still two of my\
    \ favourite groups."
