  text: 'I am seriously concerned at the stupidity of so-called "scientists", joined
    by a writer on philosophy, going to the Harz Miountains to make a goat stand in
    a ring at midnight to see if, when a Latin incantation was recited, the animal
    would turn into a young man.--Hannen Swaffer, 1932


    Back in January, I promised to tell you more about "the ridiculous Brocken affair"
    involving ghost-hunter Harry Price, a goat, a maiden "pure in heart", and The
    Bloksberg Tryst. If you hie over to The Dabbler, you will find a full account.'
