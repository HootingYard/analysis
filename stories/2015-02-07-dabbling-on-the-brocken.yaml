  , joined by a writer on philosophy, going to the Harz Miountains to make a goat\
  \ stand in a ring at midnight to see if, when a Latin incantation was recited, the\
  \ animal would turn into a young man.\u2014Hannen Swaffer, 1932\n\nBack in January,\
  \ I promised to tell you more about \u201Cthe ridiculous Brocken affair\u201D involving\
  \ ghost-hunter Harry Price, a goat, a maiden \u201Cpure in heart\u201D, and The\
  \ Bloksberg Tryst. If you hie over to The Dabbler, you will find a full account."
