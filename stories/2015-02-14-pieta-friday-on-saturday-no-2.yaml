  text: "\nI ought to have posted a Piet\xE0 yesterday, but events of the past few\
    \ days have led me to leave Hooting Yard untended. First there was an eye test\
    \ involving blurring-effect droppages, then a three-hour marathon radio broadcast\
    \ as part of the ResonanceFM fundraiser week, and certain other matters which\
    \ I may go into at a later date. Onwards and upwards!"
