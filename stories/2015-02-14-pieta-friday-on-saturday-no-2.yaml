    I ought to have posted a Pieta yesterday, but events of the past few days have
    led me to leave Hooting Yard untended. First there was an eye test involving blurring-effect
    droppages, then a three-hour marathon radio broadcast as part of the ResonanceFM
    fundraiser week, and certain other matters which I may go into at a later date.
    Onwards and upwards!'
