  text: 'When I posted Bonkers Maisie here a couple of weeks ago, Pansy Cradledew
    said "I''d like to hear that set to music by Outa_Spaceman". And lo! it has now
    been set to music and performed by Mr Spaceman. You can listen to his fine rendition
    here.

    Next up, I would like to hear a large-scale Orchestral Variations On A Theme Of
    Bonkers Maisie By Outa_Spaceman, and perhaps an ear-splitting choral version,
    but I suppose that is too much to ask.'
