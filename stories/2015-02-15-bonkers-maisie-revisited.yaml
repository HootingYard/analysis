  text: "When I posted Bonkers Maisie here a couple of weeks ago, Pansy Cradledew\
    \ said \u201CI'd like to hear that set to music by Outa_Spaceman\u201D. And lo!\
    \ it has now been set to music and performed by Mr Spaceman. You can listen to\
    \ his fine rendition here.\nNext up, I would like to hear a large-scale Orchestral\
    \ Variations On A Theme Of Bonkers Maisie By Outa_Spaceman, and perhaps an ear-splitting\
    \ choral version, but I suppose that is too much to ask."
