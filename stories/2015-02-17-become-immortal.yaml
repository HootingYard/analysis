  text: 'With two days remaining before bidding closes, I must remind you of this
    year''s Hooting Yard auction item for the Resonance104.4FM fundraiser. The highest
    bidder will be immortalised forever by having their name (or that of a loved one)
    incorporated into the title of an out of print pamphlet by Dobson. And not only
    that! They will also be invited to attend the Resonance studio for the live broadcast
    of the show when Mr Key reads the as yet unwritten story on air, and to go and
    have a cup of tea with him afterwards.

    As I write, the top bid is PS50, a paltry sum when you consider the prize on offer.
    And do remember that every penny raised goes straight into the pockets of ResonanceFM,
    from where it will be disbursed in manifold ways to ensure the continued existence,
    and improvement, of the world''s finest radio station.

    There are many other items still to bid for, so do please check on all of them
    here.'
