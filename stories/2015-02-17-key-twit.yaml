  text: 'As most of you lot know, I do not engage with Twitter. (The Hooting Yard
    Twitfeed is an automated bit of gubbins that updates whenever I post something
    here.). It has been brought to my attention, however, that last week I was all
    over Twitter like a rash--if being retwitted over fifty times is, as I am assured,
    a rash. The cause of the hoo-hah was the attention given to a letter I had published
    in The Spectator which is, I hope, self-explanatory.
