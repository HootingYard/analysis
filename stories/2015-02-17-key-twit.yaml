  text: "As most of you lot know, I do not engage with Twitter. (The Hooting Yard\
    \ Twitfeed is an automated bit of gubbins that updates whenever I post something\
    \ here.). It has been brought to my attention, however, that last week I was all\
    \ over Twitter like a rash\u2014if being retwitted over fifty times is, as I am\
    \ assured, a rash. The cause of the hoo-hah was the attention given to a letter\
    \ I had published in The Spectator which is, I hope, self-explanatory.\n"
