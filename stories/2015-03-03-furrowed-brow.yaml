  text: 'Yes, yes, I know there has been an unseemly silence at Hooting Yard for a
    while. There are a number of reasons for this, the only one of interest to you
    lot being that I have received the page proofs for Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief,
    Brief Lives, to be published (at last!) by Constable in September. This is my
    final opportunity to proofread the text of this classic reference work, so you
    can imagine your beloved Mr Key peering myopically at the pages, brow furrowed
    in concentration, trying not to dribble, and having to go and have a lie down
    in a darkened room every once in a while.

    Meanwhile, for those of you suffering from Too Few Postages At Hooting Yard Mental
    Imbalance Syndrome, I ought, belatedly, to let you know that ResonanceFM is now
    uploading editions of the radio show on to its Mixcloud page almost as soon as
    they are broadcast. That link takes you to all the Resonance programs--this link
    is to the Hooting Yard shows currently online. (If it doesn''t work, just search
    for Hooting Yard from the main page.) That should keep you occupied for the time
    being.

    Back soon, with unfurrowed brow.'
