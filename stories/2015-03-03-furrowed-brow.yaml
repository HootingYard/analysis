  text: "Yes, yes, I know there has been an unseemly silence at Hooting Yard for a\
    \ while. There are a number of reasons for this, the only one of interest to you\
    \ lot being that I have received the page proofs for Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief,\
    \ Brief Lives, to be published (at last!) by Constable in September. This is my\
    \ final opportunity to proofread the text of this classic reference work, so you\
    \ can imagine your beloved Mr Key peering myopically at the pages, brow furrowed\
    \ in concentration, trying not to dribble, and having to go and have a lie down\
    \ in a darkened room every once in a while.\nMeanwhile, for those of you suffering\
    \ from Too Few Postages At Hooting Yard Mental Imbalance Syndrome, I ought, belatedly,\
    \ to let you know that ResonanceFM is now uploading editions of the radio show\
    \ on to its Mixcloud page almost as soon as they are broadcast. That link takes\
    \ you to all the Resonance programs\u2014this link is to the Hooting Yard shows\
    \ currently online. (If it doesn't work, just search for Hooting Yard from the\
    \ main page.) That should keep you occupied for the time being.\nBack soon, with\
    \ unfurrowed brow."
