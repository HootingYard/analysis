  text: "He went to an orchard with his chums\n  And they stole a punnet's worth of\
    \ plums\n  Then they scampered off to their hideaway\n  As the last light faded\
    \ from the day\n  The sky grew dark, then darker, black\n  They transferred the\
    \ plums into a sack\n  Then they tumbled out of their hideaway tent\n  And round\
    \ the town in the night they went\n  Depositing plums from door to door\n  Mischief\
    \ that was against the law\n  For in that town plums had been banned\n  As elsewhere\
    \ in that plumless land\n  According to the king's decree\n  Chim-chim-cheroo,\
    \ chim-chim-cheree\n  (The king looked just like Dick Van Dyke)\n  Plums were\
    \ a fruit he did not like\n  Why then, you ask, did he allow\n  The orchard's\
    \ trees, bough upon bough\n  To sprout so many Carlsbad plums?\n  Let us ask the\
    \ little chums.\n  But oh! They've vanished in the night\n  Now they're completely\
    \ out of sight\n  O'er the hills and far away\n  As dawn breaks on a brand new\
    \ day\n  And townsfolk find plums on their stoeps\n  They greet them with shrill\
    \ cries and whoops\n  And hide them quick before King Claus\n  Comes on his rounds\
    \ from house to house\n  If he finds a plum his wrath will wax\n  And cause umpteen\
    \ heart attacks\n  So hide your plums well, folks of the town\n  Till human voices\
    \ wake you, and you drown."
