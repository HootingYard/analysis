  text: 'There was an item on the Today programme on BBC Radio Four this morning about
    a new scientific study of penguins. I am afraid I was not paying due attention
    so cannot enlighten you. However, it did serve to remind me that, in the long
    ago, when I used to draw pictures, I once depicted, in the medium of pen and ink,
    a scientific experiment upon a penguin.
