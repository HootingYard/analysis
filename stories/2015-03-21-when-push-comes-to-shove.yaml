  text: 'From the archives:

    When push comes to shove, I invariably topple over. If I am standing on a precipice,
    or at the edge of a gaping pit, this can be life-threatening. Thus, whenever my
    plans for the day include roaming in the vicinity of a yawning chasm, I take precautions
    by wearing a sort of winch-and-pulley affair, one end of which is wound around
    my torso, under my vest, and the other end of which I hammer into a patch of firm
    ground using a great big iron mallet. I am careful to ensure that this end of
    my winch-and-pulley is stuck fast in the earth, for if there is any chance of
    it working itself loose, the entire activity would be pointless, for if, heaven
    forbid, I were to topple when shoved, my efforts would have been in vain, for
    the crumbling or squelchy soil would yield up my winch-and-pulley and I would
    surely topple as if I had never been attached to anything in the first place.
    That is such a terrible prospect that I make efforts to map out in advance the
    terrain in which I plan to wander, perhaps a week or so ahead. Of course, fugitive
    weather conditions can alter the state of the ground as shown on my charts, but
    risk and chance play a role in all human affairs, and there is no reason why my
    roamings should be exempt. When setting out on my map-making expeditions, I usually
    attach one end of the winch-and-pulley to some stable object like a horse-trough
    or a concrete sundial.

    My benefactors have long sought to deter me from straying near pits, chasms and
    abandoned mineshafts, so I am afraid I have had to use subterfuge. As I wave to
    them from the garden gate, with the winch-and-pulley concealed behind a muffler,
    I say something like, "I am just going out to check the concrete sundial" or "My
    my, the day is so clement that I think I will stroll along a flat and featureless
    plain like the big field where Farmer Buzan used to grow his potatoes all those
    years ago". Sometimes such announcements will be met with questions, which I am
    usually able to anticipate by peering at the furrowedness of my benefactors''
    brows. At other times I may have to improvise a convincing response or deflect
    the queries by pointing at a starling, for example, or forcing a sudden spray
    of projectile vomiting. When push comes to shove, pointing at a starling is my
    preferred option.

    It is twenty years now since I bashed in Farmer Buzan''s head with his own spade.
    I like to think that my benefactors trust me these days, but it seems not. Oh
    look, there''s a starling in that sycamore tree!'
