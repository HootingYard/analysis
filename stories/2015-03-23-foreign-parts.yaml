  text: "Mr Key is off gallivanting in foreign parts, so there will be no postages\
    \ here for a week or so. You may wish to fill the Hooting Yard-shaped hole in\
    \ your noggin by traipsing through the archives, or perhaps by just gazing into\
    \ the middle distance with a look of longing and desolation ravaging your countenance.\
    \ Either way, I shall be back before you can say\nZozozozozozozozozozozozozo zirrharding\n\
    \  Hezezezezezezezezezezezezezezeze cowar ho dze hoi\n  Higaigaigaigaigaigaigaigaigaigai,\
    \ guaiagai coricor dzio dzio pi\nwhich, according to the German naturalist Bechstein,\
    \ is an accurate transcription of the song of the nightingale."
