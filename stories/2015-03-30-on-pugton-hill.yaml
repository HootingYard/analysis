  text: While shepherds watched their flocks at night on Pugton Hill the wind blew
    wild and there were shimmerings or ghostly gleams. One shepherd had a wristwatch
    and told the time to the other two. Down below Pugton Hill on the main arterial
    road huge container lorries thundered past on their way to the ferry. The shepherds
    smoked their pipes. The lorries too belched smoke for there were no laws in place
    to stop them so doing. Nor were there speed limits. Crashes and pile-ups and terrible
    accidents were common at that time in that place below Pugton Hill. When they
    heard or saw dimly in the black night a grievous traffic incident the shepherds
    laughed for their hearts were cold and void of human sympathy. They preferred
    the company of nocturnal sheep wide awake and terrified as sheep are for most
    of their time on earth and on Pugton Hill. So slowly the hands of the wristwatch
    tock off the minutes and the hours. The shepherds are waiting for a sign. There
    is no signage on the main arterial road save for an occasional arrow pointing
    towards the ferry. No sign points the way back for none of the huge speeding lorries
    ever comes back. They carry the contents of the country load by load to the ferry
    and never return past Pugton Hill atop which the shepherds smoke and laugh and
    are fiercely protective of their terrified sheep. Glory be for yes it is a kind
    of glory up there above the road as the wind blows wild in the night on Pugton
    Hill.
