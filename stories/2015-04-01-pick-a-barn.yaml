  text: 'Pick a barn, suggested Gertrude Stein in Tender Buttons (1914), so that is
    exactly what I did, I picked a barn. The barn I picked was the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge
    Farmyard. It was an appropriate choice. Just as Tender Buttons has been hailed
    as a masterpiece of cubist prose, so there is something decidedly cubist about
    the eerie barn, which reveals, if not its secrets, then to some extent its eeriness,
    when viewed simultaneously from different angles. How one might go about viewing
    an indubiitably solid three-dimensional barn from different angles simultaneously
    is The Point That Is Moot. It is well to bear this mootage in mind.

    The eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard has been the scene of many many enormities,
    some involving the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopath Babinsky, some involving
    buttons, and some both Babinsky and buttons. The barn has also witnessed, day
    in day out, the slaughter of an unconscionable number of farmyard animals, not
    least chickens. One of the buttons on Babinsky''s overcoat, incidentally, had
    a decorative bit of folderol depicting a Vanburgh chicken, but only one of the
    buttons. Why the overcoat bore an odd button is, again, The Point That Is Moot.
    That makes two points of mootage.

    Having picked my barn, I was not sure what to do next, so I further consulted
    Gertrude Stein, who clearly knew about such matters. "Pick a barn, a whole barn,"
    she wrote, "and bend more slender accents than have ever been necessary, shine
    in the darkness necessarily." So I did that, bend and shine, bend and shine, turn
    and turn about, in the whole eerie barn. It was cavernous. When I felt I had bent
    and shone sufficient unto the day, or rather the evening, for it was evening,
    I had an overwhelming sense of mootage. Did I sense, too, the phantom presence
    of Babinsky, his great hairy hands drenched with blood, his one odd chicken button
    gleaming in the necessary darkness? I did not, and that was a small mercy.

    Having picked and bent and shone, and reassured myself that Babinsky was nowhere
    in the vicinity, I was at something of a loose end. Then I remembered that Gertrude
    Stein liked to write while out in the countryside, sitting on a camping-stool,
    looking at cows. I reasoned, rightly I think, that where there is a barn there
    will be cows, or at least one cow. All I need do was to arm myself with a notepad
    and pencil and camping-stool, then find a cow. My various mootages began to dissolve,
    like liver salts in cold water.

    Gertrude Stein was driven to her countryside cow-observation-and-writing spots
    by Alice B. Toklas, but without car or driver I had to trudge through farmyard
    and fields, and puddle after puddle after puddle, in search of my wantings. Do
    you have any idea how difficult it can be to find a notepad and a pencil and a
    camping-stool in a rustic backwater? These things are not just lying about waiting
    to be gathered gratefully to the bosom of the scavenger. As night fell, black
    and inhuman, I was still wandering about like a nincompoop, without pencil or
    notepad or camping-stool. Nor did I encounter a single cow in my roamings. Perhaps
    they had all been done to death in the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard.

    Before I tumbled into a ditch to spend a night of unrest and terror, I found,
    floating in a puddle, a button. I clutched it tenderly. But then I noticed that
    it bore a decorative bit of folderol depicting a Vanburgh chicken. Was it the
    button of Babinsky? That the fiend might be close at hand, hunting desperately
    for his odd button, made me sick with fear. I flung the button away from me, as
    far as it could be flung, and toppled into my ditch. Tomorrow I would pick a different
    barn, less eerie, less cubist, and far, far from this accursed spot.'
