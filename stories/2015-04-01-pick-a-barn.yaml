  text: "Pick a barn, suggested Gertrude Stein in Tender Buttons (1914), so that is\
    \ exactly what I did, I picked a barn. The barn I picked was the eerie barn at\
    \ Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard. It was an appropriate choice. Just as Tender Buttons\
    \ has been hailed as a masterpiece of cubist prose, so there is something decidedly\
    \ cubist about the eerie barn, which reveals, if not its secrets, then to some\
    \ extent its eeriness, when viewed simultaneously from different angles. How one\
    \ might go about viewing an indubiitably solid three-dimensional barn from different\
    \ angles simultaneously is The Point That Is Moot. It is well to bear this mootage\
    \ in mind.\nThe eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard has been the scene of many\
    \ many enormities, some involving the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopath Babinsky,\
    \ some involving buttons, and some both Babinsky and buttons. The barn has also\
    \ witnessed, day in day out, the slaughter of an unconscionable number of farmyard\
    \ animals, not least chickens. One of the buttons on Babinsky's overcoat, incidentally,\
    \ had a decorative bit of folderol depicting a Vanburgh chicken, but only one\
    \ of the buttons. Why the overcoat bore an odd button is, again, The Point That\
    \ Is Moot. That makes two points of mootage.\nHaving picked my barn, I was not\
    \ sure what to do next, so I further consulted Gertrude Stein, who clearly knew\
    \ about such matters. \u201CPick a barn, a whole barn,\u201D she wrote, \u201C\
    and bend more slender accents than have ever been necessary, shine in the darkness\
    \ necessarily.\u201D So I did that, bend and shine, bend and shine, turn and turn\
    \ about, in the whole eerie barn. It was cavernous. When I felt I had bent and\
    \ shone sufficient unto the day, or rather the evening, for it was evening, I\
    \ had an overwhelming sense of mootage. Did I sense, too, the phantom presence\
    \ of Babinsky, his great hairy hands drenched with blood, his one odd chicken\
    \ button gleaming in the necessary darkness? I did not, and that was a small mercy.\n\
    Having picked and bent and shone, and reassured myself that Babinsky was nowhere\
    \ in the vicinity, I was at something of a loose end. Then I remembered that Gertrude\
    \ Stein liked to write while out in the countryside, sitting on a camping-stool,\
    \ looking at cows. I reasoned, rightly I think, that where there is a barn there\
    \ will be cows, or at least one cow. All I need do was to arm myself with a notepad\
    \ and pencil and camping-stool, then find a cow. My various mootages began to\
    \ dissolve, like liver salts in cold water.\nGertrude Stein was driven to her\
    \ countryside cow-observation-and-writing spots by Alice B. Toklas, but without\
    \ car or driver I had to trudge through farmyard and fields, and puddle after\
    \ puddle after puddle, in search of my wantings. Do you have any idea how difficult\
    \ it can be to find a notepad and a pencil and a camping-stool in a rustic backwater?\
    \ These things are not just lying about waiting to be gathered gratefully to the\
    \ bosom of the scavenger. As night fell, black and inhuman, I was still wandering\
    \ about like a nincompoop, without pencil or notepad or camping-stool. Nor did\
    \ I encounter a single cow in my roamings. Perhaps they had all been done to death\
    \ in the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard.\nBefore I tumbled into a ditch\
    \ to spend a night of unrest and terror, I found, floating in a puddle, a button.\
    \ I clutched it tenderly. But then I noticed that it bore a decorative bit of\
    \ folderol depicting a Vanburgh chicken. Was it the button of Babinsky? That the\
    \ fiend might be close at hand, hunting desperately for his odd button, made me\
    \ sick with fear. I flung the button away from me, as far as it could be flung,\
    \ and toppled into my ditch. Tomorrow I would pick a different barn, less eerie,\
    \ less cubist, and far, far from this accursed spot."
