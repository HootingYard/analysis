  text: 'The other day I mentioned Gertrude Stein''s Tender Buttons. I feel it only
    right that you should be told Tender Buttons is also the name of a magnificent
    button shop in New York City. Last year it celebrated its fiftieth anniversary.
    Should you find yourself in that fair city I wholeheartedly recommend you pay
    it a visit and buy some buttons. I did.
