  text: 'The other day I met a man who claimed he could eat his own head. I considered
    this preposterous, and said so. We were at a sophisticated cocktail party and
    he was leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece.

    "I can prove it to you," he said, "As a demonstration, I will eat your head, and
    that will show that I could eat my own."

    I thought about this for perhaps three seconds before responding.

    "Your so-called proof has several distinct flaws," I said, "First, that if you
    eat my head, I will be in no position to form a judgement on the success or otherwise
    of your antics, as I presume I will lose consciousness and die as you gnaw through
    my neck, thus severing those all-important nerves and arteries and whatnot that
    enable my brain to function. Second, your ability to eat my head has no bearing
    whatsoever on your claim to be able to eat your own head. It is an entirely different
    head."

    He took a sip of his cocktail before conceding.

    "Those are both valid points. But there were but two, and you said you had several."

    "Let those two suffice for the time being," I said.

    "Very well," he replied, "I can see that I am up against a sceptic of formidable
    mental acuity. You are not by any chance a Jesuit, are you?"

    I assured him I was not, despite it having been a childhood ambition to be ordained
    into the order.

    "I, too, once dreamed of becoming a Jesuit," he said, "But alas, I lost my faith.
    Still, that was a long time ago, since when I suppose I learned to replace it
    with the more fervent belief that I can eat my own head. You will not be satisfied
    until you actually witness me in the act of doing so, will you?"

    I nodded my agreement. He looked at me in silence, and after a pause, said "There".

    "There what?" I asked.

    "I just ate my own head and regurgitated it, as a bird does with food for its
    young." he said, "You must excuse my manners, for I am a terribly fast eater and
    tend to gobble my food. I can be quite a cause of social discomfiture in the better
    restaurants."

    "I witnessed neither eating nor regurgitation," I said, "You just stood there
    looking at me."

    He sighed with a measure of impatience.

    "I have just explained to you that I eat with regrettable speed," he said, "And
    this habit has a deleterious effect on my digestive system, one consequence of
    which is that I cannot tolerate certain foodstuffs, including human flesh and
    bone and brain matter, etcetera, so I spew them up immediately."

    "You are a very foolish man. Good evening to you, sir," I said, and I turned on
    my heel and wandered off across the room, away from the mantelpiece, in search
    of somebody else to talk to.

    Later that evening, passing near the mantelpiece again, I saw the man biting the
    head off another party guest, a person who, I reasoned, had not had the benefits
    of a Jesuitical education, and thus could not counter the arguments of this foolish
    but persuasive fellow. There was blood on the carpet, as there so often is, even
    at the most sophisticated cocktail parties.'
