  text: "The other day I met a man who claimed he could eat his own head. I considered\
    \ this preposterous, and said so. We were at a sophisticated cocktail party and\
    \ he was leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece.\n\u201CI can prove it to\
    \ you,\u201D he said, \u201CAs a demonstration, I will eat your head, and that\
    \ will show that I could eat my own.\u201D\nI thought about this for perhaps three\
    \ seconds before responding.\n\u201CYour so-called proof has several distinct\
    \ flaws,\u201D I said, \u201CFirst, that if you eat my head, I will be in no position\
    \ to form a judgement on the success or otherwise of your antics, as I presume\
    \ I will lose consciousness and die as you gnaw through my neck, thus severing\
    \ those all-important nerves and arteries and whatnot that enable my brain to\
    \ function. Second, your ability to eat my head has no bearing whatsoever on your\
    \ claim to be able to eat your own head. It is an entirely different head.\u201D\
    \nHe took a sip of his cocktail before conceding.\n\u201CThose are both valid\
    \ points. But there were but two, and you said you had several.\u201D\n\u201C\
    Let those two suffice for the time being,\u201D I said.\n\u201CVery well,\u201D\
    \ he replied, \u201CI can see that I am up against a sceptic of formidable mental\
    \ acuity. You are not by any chance a Jesuit, are you?\u201D\nI assured him I\
    \ was not, despite it having been a childhood ambition to be ordained into the\
    \ order.\n\u201CI, too, once dreamed of becoming a Jesuit,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    But alas, I lost my faith. Still, that was a long time ago, since when I suppose\
    \ I learned to replace it with the more fervent belief that I can eat my own head.\
    \ You will not be satisfied until you actually witness me in the act of doing\
    \ so, will you?\u201D\nI nodded my agreement. He looked at me in silence, and\
    \ after a pause, said \u201CThere\u201D.\n\u201CThere what?\u201D I asked.\n\u201C\
    I just ate my own head and regurgitated it, as a bird does with food for its young.\u201D\
    \ he said, \u201CYou must excuse my manners, for I am a terribly fast eater and\
    \ tend to gobble my food. I can be quite a cause of social discomfiture in the\
    \ better restaurants.\u201D\n\u201CI witnessed neither eating nor regurgitation,\u201D\
    \ I said, \u201CYou just stood there looking at me.\u201D\nHe sighed with a measure\
    \ of impatience.\n\u201CI have just explained to you that I eat with regrettable\
    \ speed,\u201D he said, \u201CAnd this habit has a deleterious effect on my digestive\
    \ system, one consequence of which is that I cannot tolerate certain foodstuffs,\
    \ including human flesh and bone and brain matter, etcetera, so I spew them up\
    \ immediately.\u201D\n\u201CYou are a very foolish man. Good evening to you, sir,\u201D\
    \ I said, and I turned on my heel and wandered off across the room, away from\
    \ the mantelpiece, in search of somebody else to talk to.\nLater that evening,\
    \ passing near the mantelpiece again, I saw the man biting the head off another\
    \ party guest, a person who, I reasoned, had not had the benefits of a Jesuitical\
    \ education, and thus could not counter the arguments of this foolish but persuasive\
    \ fellow. There was blood on the carpet, as there so often is, even at the most\
    \ sophisticated cocktail parties."
