  text: "Speaking of fishmongers, as we were (sort of) yesterday, this piece first\
    \ appeared in 2008. It was prompted by Rayner Heppenstall's observation that in\
    \ one of his poems, \u201CMr [T. S.] Eliot so oddly bids us to pray for fishmongers\u201D\
    .\n\u201COh Lord, through Thy infinite grace, shower my counter with bream and\
    \ plaice\u201D is the opening couplet of the Fishmongers\u2019 Prayer. This has\
    \ the distinction of being the longest prayer in the English language, which is\
    \ why you will rarely hear it recited in full. Its length is due to the fact that,\
    \ within the rolling cadences of its many, many verses, all known types of fish,\
    \ both edible and inedible, are mentioned at least once. It was the work of a\
    \ piscatorial monomaniac named Egbert Bock. He was not himself a practising fishmonger,\
    \ nor indeed did he live in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy\
    \ little man whose ears were perplexingly shaped, inasmuch as they looked as if\
    \ they had been stuck to his head upside down. His obsession with fish is thought\
    \ to have been caused by a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders.\
    \ Nine times out of ten such happenstance will lead to a phobia, but in Bock's\
    \ case it had precisely the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were\
    \ made upon his brain after his death, it was discovered that the areas devoted\
    \ to fish and the mongering of fish were terrifically shrivelled. Some seaside\
    \ vicars still include an abridged version of the Fishmongers\u2019 Prayer in\
    \ their services. But not many."
