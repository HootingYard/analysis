  text: "\nIn The Dabbler this week I have a good moan about a couple of current exasperations,\
    \ the phrase \u201Cour NHS\u201D and the word \u201Cmum\u201D. The piece ought\
    \ to have been far more vituperative and indeed unsuitable for family reading,\
    \ but the editor chose to illustrate it with a photograph of that lovely cuddly\
    \ character John Lydon, so I suppose it's fortuitous that I toned down my invective."
