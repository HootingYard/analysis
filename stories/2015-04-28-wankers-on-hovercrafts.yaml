  text: I have had a fabtastic idea for a TV show. It's called Wankers On Hovercrafts.
    Each episode would follow a channel crossing, there and back, by a group of objectionable
    people aboard an outmoded form of sea transport. The idea ticks all the boxes--well,
    three of them--and would be relatively cheap to produce. I shall set up a meeting
    with a BBC commissioning editor at the first opportunity, and I have every confidence
    that it will get the go-ahead. I mean, it's the perfect TV show, surely? When
    you see me collecting my gong at a future awards ceremony, remember where you
    first read those magic words--Wankers On Hovercrafts!
