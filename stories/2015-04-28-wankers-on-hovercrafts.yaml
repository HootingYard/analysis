  text: "I have had a fabtastic idea for a TV show. It's called Wankers On Hovercrafts.\
    \ Each episode would follow a channel crossing, there and back, by a group of\
    \ objectionable people aboard an outmoded form of sea transport. The idea ticks\
    \ all the boxes\u2014well, three of them\u2014and would be relatively cheap to\
    \ produce. I shall set up a meeting with a BBC commissioning editor at the first\
    \ opportunity, and I have every confidence that it will get the go-ahead. I mean,\
    \ it's the perfect TV show, surely? When you see me collecting my gong at a future\
    \ awards ceremony, remember where you first read those magic words\u2014Wankers\
    \ On Hovercrafts!"
