  text: 'Readers will know that from time to time I find inspiration from cryptic
    crosswords. For decades, it has been my daily habit to tackle the Guardian crossword,
    with occasional forays into those of other newspapers. Today I have been particularly
    impressed by 4 Across in the Guardian. The clue reads:

    Incidents where git punches crusty things behind back of cafe (8)

    I have not yet solved this, but while it is fresh in my mind I thought it useful
    to transcribe it here, mostly as an aide memoire to myself. You lot can look forward
    to an examination of such incidents in a forthcoming sweeping paragraph of majestic
    prose.'
