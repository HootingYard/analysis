  text: 'Dear Mr. Key,, writes Poppy Nisbet from her fastness in North America, There
    was an offer on Freecycle this morning for a "disabled rooster". I haven''t been
    able to get it out of my mind. It read: "Offer: disabled rooster".

    Likewise, on the bird front, I found a wonderful 17th century engraving of two
    standing desert ostriches blowing on their eggs. After dogged persistence Google
    finally produced a translation of the accompanying Latin text and I learned that
    ostriches were believed to leave their eggs to hatch in the care of the sun and
    the sand. The parent birds blew "nourishing breathe" onto their offspring before,
    er, deserting them.

    The translation given for ostrich was "Sparrow-camel".'
