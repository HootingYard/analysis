  text: 'I was reading the other day about closed-down shipyards and came upon a reference
    to Swan Hunter. This served to remind me of a fellow I met recently whose business
    card--which he handed to me--announced his business as a swan hunter. We were
    guests at a swish sophisticated cocktail party and he was leaning insouciantly
    against a mantelpiece. He apologised that the card was smeared with blood, explaining
    that it was the blood of a swan and that such smearage was an occupational hazard.

    "Surely," I said, "There is not much hunting to do to find swans? Do you not just
    head for the nearest body of water, such as a pond or a canal, which swans are
    known to frequent?"

    "There is a measure of truth in what you say," he replied, bringing up an unseemly
    gobbet of catarrh and spitting it into a napkin, "But first one must find the
    pond or canal. Though swans are almost invariably found on ponds and canals, it
    does not follow that all ponds and canals have their resident swans, as a moment''s
    thought will confirm."

    "Fair enough," I said, "But identifying those ponds and canals where you might
    find a swan hardly counts as hunting. You just need to obtain a map and mark with
    a pencilled X those ponds and canals shown on it which are known to be populated
    by swans. You can do that while sitting in an armchair."

    He spat into his napkin again.

    "I could indeed," he said, "But that would take all the thrill out of the hunt.
    I prefer to go a-roaming through the countryside, or through a large municipal
    park, sniffing the air and studying the terrain until I track down a pond or a
    canal. And even then," he continued before I had a chance to interrupt, "There
    can be no guarantee that the pond or canal I come upon will be swanful. The uncertainty
    adds to the excitement."

    "It might be more accurate to say, then, that you are a pond and canal hunter,
    rather than a swan hunter," I said.

    "Bosh!" he shouted, slopping some of his cocktail onto the hearth-rug, "Where
    no swans are in evidence upon the pond or canal I have stalked, I press on, indefatigably,
    come rain or shine."

    "So let us assume," I said, "That you have arrived at a pond or canal teeming
    with swans, whether in the countryside or in parkland. Do you then take potshots
    at them with a Mannlicher-Carcano sniper''s rifle?"

    "Heaven forfend!" he cried, slopping more cocktail onto the rug, "Where would
    be the sport in that? No, I go unarmed. Swan hunting, when executed properly,
    is the pitting of man against swan in a primal struggle. Having selected an individual
    swan, I engage it in combat. That is why I have had my arms broken several times
    in several places."

    "Ah," I said, "I was wondering why you held your cocktail glass at a rather curious
    angle."

    Actually, I ws not wondering this at all. I was just making conversation. It has
    never been my habit to examine in any detail the angles at which swish sophisticated
    cocktail party guests hold their cocktail glasses, nor, for that matter, am I
    much exercised when in their excitement they slop some of the contents of said
    glasses on to the hearth rug, unless of course it is my own hearth rug. But it
    never is, for I do not host my own cocktail parties. I am temperamentally incapable
    of organising sufficient sausages on sticks due to my cackhandedness, which invariably
    means I prick my fingers and thumbs repeatedly with the sharp wooden cocktail
    sticks, drawing blood. No one in their right minds wants to attend a party, however
    sumptuous the cocktails, if the plates are littered with sausages lying unpunctured
    beside piles of bloodied wooden sticks. A business card smeared with the blood
    of a swan seemed to me a far less gruesome sight. In fact, the more I thought
    about it, my own reservations about hosting a cocktail party seemed immeasurably
    more interesting than listening to a man wittering on about his experiences of
    unarmed combat with swans, fighting to the death. Only my impeccable manners prevented
    me from saying so, in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone else in the
    room.

    It was only then, looking around, that I noticed the swan hunter and I were the
    only guests still present. Everyone else had tiptoed out, through the open French
    windows. Peering out into the dusk, I saw approaching, marching relentlessly across
    the lawn, a gaggle of savage and vengeful swans.'
