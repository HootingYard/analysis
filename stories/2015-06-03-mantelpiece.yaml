  text: "A letter plops onto the mat from Tord Grip. I wondered if this was the same\
    \ Tord Grip who is something of a luminary in the world of foopball coaching,\
    \ but apparently it is a different Tord Grip altogether. Anyway, here is what\
    \ he has to say for himself:\nDear Mr Key, I have been a devoted reader of yours\
    \ for many years. Something that has particularly struck me is your fondness for\
    \ the motif of a character \u201Cat a swish sophisticated cocktail party, leaning\
    \ insouciantly against a mantelpiece\u201D. You return to this again and again.\
    \ Sometimes the person so leaning is a fictional character and sometimes, in first\
    \ person narratives, it is you. I am not so na\xEFve as to think that the \u201C\
    I\u201D figure in such tales is actually you, and that the pieces are wholly autobiographical.\
    \ I realise that the first person narrator may be a fictional or semi-fictional\
    \ version of yourself. This interpretation is not simply common sense, but is\
    \ borne out by Roland Clare in his introduction to the anthology By Aerostat To\
    \ Hooting Yard, where he makes the point that \u201CWhen Key \u2026 conducts occasional\
    \ epistolary dialogues with correspondents \u2026 \u2014almost certainly not real\
    \ people\u2014his engagement with them shades his own status with a fictional\
    \ quality. His uncertain standing is compounded by the \u2026 pieces written in\
    \ the first person\u201D, and he posits a distinction between \u201CFrank Key,\
    \ author of the blog vs Mr Key, the quasi-fictional entity\u201D. So, when you\
    \ report that you were \u201Cat a swish sophisticated cocktail party, leaning\
    \ insouciantly against a mantelpiece\u201D, are we to infer that this statement\
    \ is factual or fictional? Or are we deliberately left on shaky ground, uncertain,\
    \ bewitched, bothered, and bewildered?\nIncidentally, the quotation above from\
    \ Mr Clare also calls into question my own existence, as one of your correspondents.\
    \ While I know in the very core of my being that I am a real person of flesh and\
    \ blood\u2014I need only bash my head against my writing-desk to confirm as much\u2014\
    ouch!\u2014your readers may, like Mr Clare, think I am \u201Calmost certainly\
    \ not real\u201D. Whether or not their suspicions will be heightened or dampened\
    \ by the coincidence that I share my name with one of the tiptop figures in the\
    \ world of foopball coaching, I cannot say. In my part of the world, Tord Grip\
    \ is not so outlandish a name that one can jump to any conclusion in the matter.\
    \ I think it best to pass over my further ruminations on the question of reality,\
    \ otherwise we would be here all day and in all likelihood end up with what my\
    \ clinician has dubbed \u201Ccrumbling of the brainpans\u201D.\nInstead, I should\
    \ like to turn to the reason I am writing to you in the first place. It so happens\
    \ that one of my hobbies\u2014alongside knitting, sandpapering rough surfaces,\
    \ and bird observation\u2014is enacting short extracts from my favourite writers.\
    \ To this end I have, in recent weeks, gone about wearing a little Ether Hood\
    \ (Emily Dickinson), taken pictures of Jap girls in synthesis (David Bowie), sucked\
    \ innumerable pebbles (Samuel Beckett), and run screaming from a Paris hotel room\
    \ after casting a spell to summon the great god Pan (Aleister Crowley). Having\
    \ ticked these off in my ledger, next on my list was to go to a swish sophisticated\
    \ cocktail party and lean insouciantly against a mantelpiece (Frank Key).\nFirst\
    \ of all, of course, I had to obtain an invitation to such a soir\xE9e. The difficulty\
    \ with this was that, like you, I have been described as a Diogenesian recluse,\
    \ and I don't get out much\u2014oh, wait a minute. That reminds me. If you are\
    \ as reclusive as Mr Cutler asserts, how is it that you are forever attending\
    \ swish sophisticated cocktail parties? I have spent an inordinate amount of time\
    \ pondering this conundrum. Even if we take into account that many of the insouciant\
    \ leaners are explicitly fictional characters, and concede that, pace Roland Clare,\
    \ you yourself are quasi-fictional, there remains the fact that there is something\
    \ compelling in these scenes that convinces the reader they must, at the very\
    \ least, be the result of particularly acute authorial observation. Consider the\
    \ swish and sophisticated nature of the cocktail parties, the insouciance of the\
    \ person leaning, the brute solidity of the mantelpiece itself. It seems unlikely\
    \ that such details could be fomented entirely within your head, absent of direct\
    \ and emotionally shattering experience.\nI am pleased to say that the result\
    \ of my agonised mulling over the matter was ultimately beneficial. If Mr Key,\
    \ as a recluse, can yet summon the nerve to accept invitations to swish sophisticated\
    \ cocktail parties, I said to myself, then I too can screw my courage to the sticking\
    \ place and do likewise. I said this to myself repeatedly, gazing into a mirror\
    \ at my strange unnatural beauty. Eventually I was ready. But still I had not\
    \ received any invitations.\nI dabbled with the idea of skipping to the next item\
    \ on my list, to ring upon the rein of a wimpling wing in my ecstasy (Gerard Manley\
    \ Hopkins), but I am a methodical sort of person and I knew I would lie awake\
    \ at night remonstrating with myself until I had completed the Frank Key element\
    \ of my project. I had been very careful, when drawing up my roster, to place\
    \ my proposed enactments in a very specific order, based upon the Bl\xF6tzmann\_\
    system (Yellow Notebook, Fifth Series). Though I was keenly aware of the possibility\
    \ that Bl\xF6tzmann, and his system, and his notebooks, in their series, were\
    \ all fictional, having been made up by you, Mr Key, I have found his guidance\
    \ invaluable in several different areas of my life, not least the careful compiling\
    \ of lists in very specific orders.\nI thus found myself at an impasse. I could\
    \ not move on until I had leaned insouciantly against a mantelpiece at a swish\
    \ sophisticated cocktail party, and I could not attend a swish sophisticated cocktail\
    \ party without an invitation. Or could I? Was it not possible for me simply to\
    \ gatecrash such a do? Hell, yes!, as Ed Miliband would say. But first I had to\
    \ find a party to gatecrash.\nMuch as it went against my reclusive nature, I took\
    \ to stalking the streets of an evening, stopping when I came upon a building\
    \ with a window alive with lights, and peering in to see if a swish sophisticated\
    \ cocktail party was in progress. I had already planned how I would gain entry.\
    \ Knocking at the door, I would pretend to be an emergency postman with an urgent\
    \ delivery for\u2014at which point I would counterfeit a violent coughing fit\
    \ and bite on a capsule of blood tucked in my cheek. Spraying what was in reality\
    \ a small amount of duck's blood all over the hallway carpet, I would stagger\
    \ into the house and collapse. While the host ran for help, I would stand up,\
    \ dab at my mouth with a napkin to erase any traces of gore, comb my hair, take\
    \ off my emergency postman's jacket and stuff it behind the umbrella stand, then\
    \ sashay into the main room where the party was in full swing, grab a cocktail\
    \ from a tray, and make for the mantelpiece, against which I would lean insouciantly.\
    \ Job done.\nI don't know if you have ever stalked the evening streets in search\
    \ of a swish sophisticated cocktail party to inveigle your way into by dint of\
    \ a foolproof scheme, but believe you me it is not as easy as it sounds. Perhaps\
    \ I was stalking through the wrong part of town, down by the docks where the sailors\
    \ all meet, eating fish heads and tails, splitting the night with the roar of\
    \ their jokes, laughing and lusting till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts.\
    \ The lit windows I peered into framed scenes of unimaginable depravity and debauch.\
    \ Nor did I spot a mantelpiece clean enough to lean upon in my specially-hired\
    \ Ferdinando Boffo dinner-suit, worn beneath the emergency postman's jacket.\n\
    I turned down an alley towards what I hoped would be a more salubrious part of\
    \ town when I became aware of footsteps following me. There was something inexplicably\
    \ menacing about them (M. R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu, E. F. Benson\u2014names\
    \ absent, alas, from my list). I quickened my pace, and so did the footsteps.\
    \ Determined to confront whoever\u2014whatever\u2014was following me, I turned\
    \ around. To my horror I saw, silhouetted against the sickly moon, the lumbering\
    \ walrus-moustached psychopathic serial killer Babinsky! My mind was a chaos.\
    \ I had always believed him to be a purely fictional maniac dreamed up by you,\
    \ Mr Key, to trouble my dreams. Yet here he was, all too real, lumbering relentlessly\
    \ towards me. As he raised his blood-drenched axe above his head, preparing to\
    \ strike, intermingled with my terror I felt a small measure of solace that, though\
    \ it was not the enactment of a Hooting Yard scene I had planned, when I drew\
    \ my last breath having been felled by Babinsky, I would, inadvertently, be recreating\
    \ a common motif from the works of Mr Key. There can be no more piquant farewell\
    \ to this life, be it a real life or, perhaps, perhaps, an entirely fictional\
    \ one."
