  text: 'Dear Mr Key, writes Olivia Funnel, who may or may not be fictitious--I wouldn''t
    presume to know--I confess I am a little puzzled by something. Yesterday you reproduced
    a letter received from Tord Grip, which, you say, plopped onto the mat, suggesting
    that it was an old-fashioned letter written on paper and inserted into an envelope
    with a postage stamp affixed. Surely, in our brave new e-world of digital fantasticness
    your correspondents communicate with you by email? Perplexedly yours, Olivia Funnel.

    Well, Ms Funnel, it is true that almost all of my correspondence these days arrives
    in the form of electronic communications. However, as you will learn when next
    you check your in-box, all emails I receive generate an automated reply, which
    reads as follows:

    Thank you for writing to Mr Key. Please note that your inscriptio cursus electronici
    will be ignored unless you rewrite it by hand, with a propelling pencil upon a
    sheet of creamy paper, which you should then insert into an envelope to which
    you should affix a postage stamp. The envelope should then be rolled into a cylinder
    and fastened around the leg of a crow. Whisper "To Mr Key! To Mr Key!" into the
    crow''s ear and watch it fly away. If you are not sure where the crow''s ear is,
    study ornithology.

    The fact that I am replying to Olivia Funnel is evidence that she did indeed follow
    these instructions. I ought to point out that I do not eschew modern electronic
    communication methods due to some ill-tempered Luddite animus against the modern
    world--though I do--but rather because it pleases me to have crows flying in through
    my window on a regular basis. Once I have detached the rolled-up envelope from
    the crow''s leg, I inject it with a serum which renders it unconscious, and add
    it to my collection of unconscious crows. I have not yet worked out what to do
    with them all, and for the moment I am content enough to see their number growing
    by the day.

    One of my correspondents has suggested attaching a brain scanner to each crow,
    and deducing from the resulting print-outs the nature of crows'' dreams (and nightmares).
    This would seem to me a very worthy enterprise, and I will consider giving it
    a go.

    Dear Mr Key, writes Olivia Funnel, again, Thank you for your reply to my query.
    Unfortunately it raises further questions which leave me even more perplexed than
    heretofore. If you receive your letters through the agency of a crow flying in
    through your window with an envelope furled around its leg, how then did Tord
    Grip''s letter plop onto the mat? The only explanation that makes sense is that
    you dropped the envelope onto the mat yourself, once you had detached it from
    the crow, and before or after injecting the crow with a serum. But what possible
    rationale could you have for so dropping the envelope? That seems to me to be
    the utmost foolery. Yours more in sorrow than in anger, Olivia Funnel.

    I said, after receiving Ms Funnel''s earlier missive, that I was unsure whether
    she was real or fictional. Evidence has now come to light that she is, decisively,
    the latter. This leads me to conclude that, contrary to her assertion, the utmost
    foolery would be to indulge a letter from a wholly fictitious person with a reply.
    I have, instead, torn both her letters to shreds with my bare hands. I intend
    to stuff the shreds into an envelope of cloth, thus forming a little cushion,
    which will serve as a splendid resting-place for one of my unconscious crows.'
