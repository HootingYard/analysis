  text: 'Pansy Cradledew recently spent three days in rural Denmark. Upon her return,
    she presented me with some small gifts of Danish stationery. Among these was a
    pencil, along the barrel of which the following phrases are stamped:

    GRAKS AGANAK PIKIPOF

    AUTOMOLOK TITA TITO

    PLOKS GUGANAGA PLIP

    I suspect this is probably gobbledegook rather than Danish, although there is
    a distinct possibility it might be Real Orghast. If any reader can tell me what
    it means, please do so in the Comments.'
