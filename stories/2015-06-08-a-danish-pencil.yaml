text: 'Pansy Cradledew recently spent three days in rural Denmark. Upon her return,
  she presented me with some small gifts of Danish stationery. Among these was a pencil,
  along the barrel of which the following phrases are stamped:

  GRAKS AGANAK PIKIPOF

  AUTOMOLOK TITA TITO

  PLOKS GUGANAGA PLIP

  I suspect this is probably gobbledegook rather than Danish, although there is a
  distinct possibility it might be Real Orghast. If any reader can tell me what it
  means, please do so in the Comments.'
