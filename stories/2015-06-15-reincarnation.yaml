  text: 'I have never given serious thought to the idea of reincarnation, and it is
    about time I did so. After all, we are serious people, are we not?, and we should
    think seriously about everything, absolutely everything, as it falls within our
    purview. There will be many subjects deserving of only our fleeting attention,
    but even those we should consider with all due seriousness. In that spirit, and
    in the full knowledge that the concept of reincarnation, or the transmigration
    of souls, is almost certainly arrant poppycock, let us see if we can winkle from
    it anything of significance.

    In some versions of the theory, the transmigrating soul flits from species to
    species. This would suggest that, immediately before the glorious event that was
    the arrival upon earth of Mr Key, I might have been, say, a bat or a prawn or
    a tulip. This is a perfect example of something so foolish that our fleeting attention
    can fly away from it tout suite, with nary a backward glance. Like the collected
    written outpourings of Will Self, it can be safely tucked away and forgotten about.
    We gave it our serious attention, for a moment or two, and then moved on, sensibly,
    as sensible and serious persons do.

    Of more interest is the idea that, as the spark of life is extinguished in one
    human corporeal being, at the very moment when life passes it makes a leap into
    a brand new host. Though as preposterous as the idea that I was once a tulip,
    this at least has a certain tidiness about it. If, for a while, we entertain the
    possibility of it being true, the urgent question then thumps inside our heads--who
    were you, Mr Key, before you were Mr Key?

    I am minded to date the dawn of my existence not to the date of birth, but to
    the moment of conception in my mother''s womb. Unless one''s father is a precise
    and punctilious Walter Shandy figure, that moment is well nigh impossible to pinpoint,
    so the best we can do is to use informed guesswork. Counting backwards from the
    date of my (premature) birth, it is likely that I was conceived in the dying days
    of May in the Year of Our Lord MCMLVIII, or, as modern barbarians would prefer,
    1958. So who shuffled off this mortal coil around that time, apart from several
    bats or prawns or tulips?

    Three candidates present themselves--the Romanian aviator Constantin Cantacuzino,
    the Spanish writer Juan Ramon Jimenez, and--skipping forward slightly to the beginning
    of June--the American oceanographer Townsend Cromwell. The next stage of my serious
    research will be to immerse myself in the lives of this trio, finding out all
    I can, perhaps entering a fugue state. Without leaping ahead of myself, I have
    to say that my favourite of the three, at this stage, is the Spaniard, not so
    much on account of his Nobel Prize for Literature (1956), but because, judging
    by this photograph, his wife is wearing exactly the sort of hat I can imagine
    Pansy Cradledew sporting atop her lovely head.

    I will keep you informed of my findings.
