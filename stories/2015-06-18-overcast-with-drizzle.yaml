  text: 'It was a gorgeous day of overcast skies and drizzle and a keen wind, and
    I set out early, in stout boots, with a pippy bag over my shoulder, whistling
    a tune remembered from childhood, such as it was, learned, I think, from the orphanage''s
    brutish overseer, who liked to sing the song as he made us dip into puddles and
    fossick for squelchy writhing horrors, vile water-worms and other beings which
    we collected in our pails for him, and the orphan with the highest tally was rewarded
    with an extra helping of gruel. Oh happy days! We never found out what the brute
    did with all those aquatic creepy-crawlies, but, at night, as we tossed and turned
    in our iron cots in the attic, we whispered stories to each other, making up tales
    about the brute and his pails full of the worms we caught for him. It was only
    later, when I was grown and had long left the orphanage, that I learned he sold
    them to a scientist at the sinister secret laboratory along the lane on the other
    side of the viaduct, as he sold an orphan or two from time to time, when funds
    were low or he lost his temper.

    It was on that gorgeous day that I retraced my steps, past the shuttered and abandoned
    orphanage and along the lane and through the wicket gate we had been forbidden
    to cross in the old days, and I carried on under the viaduct and past the shuttered
    and abandoned laboratory, past the ice cream kiosk and the duckpond, on past the
    gasworks and the aerodrome and the cement statue of Condoleezza Rice With A Thousand
    Nightingales, until at last, the sky more overcast, the drizzle heavier, the wind
    keener, I came to the big stone gates of the Mercy Home.

    I rang the bell, it clanked, and a nun came to let me in. Her wimple was filthy.
    I stated my business, and she led me across the gravel and around the main building
    and past the vegetable patches and the gazebo to a hut almost hidden in vegetation
    and awe. I tipped the nun a coin from my pocket and she gambolled away, singing,
    I noted, the very same song I had been whistling all the long day.

    I stood outside the hut and eased my pippy bag from my shoulder, then took from
    it a sealed jar. Inside the jar, squirming in a quantity of puddlewater, were
    dozens of squelchy writhing horrors, vile water-worms and other beings which I
    had collected for the retired brute. I ceased to whistle, and pushed open the
    door of the hut. I had come to make my weekly offering.'
