  text: '

    In my cupboard in yesterday''s Dabbler I resurrected some prose from the last
    century. The twelve potted biographies you will find there served originally as
    the texts accompanying illustrations for the 1993 Hooting Yard Calendar, entitled
    The Golden Age Of Bodger''s Spinney Variety Theatre. (One of the illustrations
    is reproduced for The Dabbler.)

    I revisited some even earlier prose in a dream last night. When I was about fifteen
    years old I wrote a dreadful surrealist(ish) play-of-sorts called The Shepherd
    Of Amsterdam. The text no longer survives, long ago consumed by fire or eaten
    by worms. Last night it returned to haunt me in my sleep. I was in charge of putting
    on a stage production of the work, due to begin in fifteen minutes in spite of
    the fact that no rehearsals had taken place and the actors were wholly unfamiliar
    with the play. Indeed, there was only the single copy of the text in my possession,
    which I belatedly thought to photocopy. I was heading to the library for that
    purpose when I was told that the soundtrack CD of the play--produced by a walrus-moustachioed
    impresario who, I was assured, was "a big fan of Hooting Yard"--featuring music
    by Verdi and Monteverdi, was ready, awaiting only the addition of the actors performing
    the words.

    Then I woke up.'
