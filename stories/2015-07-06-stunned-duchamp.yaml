  text: 'I am much looking forward to the Joseph Cornell exhibition which opened at
    the Royal Academy at the weekend. Meanwhile, reviewing the show in The Spectator,
    Martin Gayford tells us:

    Cornell ... was one of the few ever to ruffle [Marcel] Duchamp''s philosophical
    cool. At their first meeting, or so the story goes, they discussed the topography
    of central Paris in enormous detail, building by building--and in French--Cornell
    mentioning casually only afterwards that he had never visited the city. Duchamp
    was lost for words.

    Cornell spent his entire life on Utopia Parkway in New York, and never travelled
    further than Maine.'
