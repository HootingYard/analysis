    Dear Mr Key, Are you still alive?

    Dear Mr Key, Has your pea-sized yet pulsating brain finally given up the ghost?

    Ahoy there Key!, Is there a terrible vacancy between your ears we devoted readers
    ought to know about?

    These are just some of the letters I have received in response to the eerie silence
    which has fallen over Hooting Yard like a leaden pall. The awful truth is revealed
    in today''s Dabbler, and it is all about bees!'
