  text: "As Hooting Yard is the home of The Grunty Man, I thought I should draw to\
    \ your attention the latest \u201CAncient and Modern\u201D column by Peter Jones\
    \ in The Spectator:\nWhat a pleasure it was to watch the men's final at Wimbledon\
    \ contested with a minimum of grunting, exclaiming and gesticulation. Romans would\
    \ have approved.\nIt was well known that athletes and those taking exercise had\
    \ a tendency to grunt. Seneca the Younger (c. 4 bc\u2013ad 65), multi-millionaire\
    \ Stoic philosopher and adviser to Nero, described his unfortunate lodgings over\
    \ the baths, which made him abhor his ears: quite apart from people hawking their\
    \ wares, depilators making their victims shriek, bathers singing out loud and\
    \ splashing about, \u2018those working out with weights \u2014 whether actually\
    \ working out or just faking it \u2014 grunt away; when they let out their breath,\
    \ they emit shrill wheezes\u2019. The satirist Juvenal mocks the way female gladiators,\
    \ taught by their trainers to prepare for the real thing, \u2018grunt while they\
    \ practise thrusts at a tree-stump (and then reach for the potty)\u2019.The assumption\
    \ is that the grunting associated with exercise was largely a matter of showing-off:\
    \ it sent out the message \u2018look what a heroic effort we are putting into\
    \ all this\u2019. In a philosophical dialogue, Cicero shines a different light\
    \ on the matter. Discussing mastery of pain, he sees an analogy between bracing\
    \ the soul in order to keep a stiff upper lip and bracing the body to sustain\
    \ a supreme physical effort. In both cases, a groan or grunt may help. He cites\
    \ athletes in training, especially \u2018boxers who, unleashing a blow on their\
    \ opponent, emit a grunt\u2026 in order to tense up the body and so increase the\
    \ force of the hit\u2019. To that extent, Cicero goes on, a man in pain may release\
    \ a groan \u2014 but nothing feeble or piteous \u2014 if by bringing a degree\
    \ of relief it will strengthen his will for the battle against it.\nThe two Wimbledon\
    \ finalists provided an admirable example of skill, determination, self-control\
    \ and minimal, functional grunting. Perhaps the professional grunters and ranters\
    \ might mend their ways if crowds grunted and ranted back at them in mocking unison.\n\
    I feel inspired by this to write a fat and comprehensive World History Of Grunts\
    \ And Grunting. Watch this space."
