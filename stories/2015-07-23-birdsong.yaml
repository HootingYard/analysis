  text: "I have decided to devote my life to birdsong. No, not that kind of birdsong,\
    \ all those trills and squawks and cooing noises that birds make. I mean songs\
    \ about birds. I have not quite worked everything out in my head, but the general\
    \ idea is to take familiar songs, not originally about birds, and to amend the\
    \ lyrics to make them more bird-focussed. I feel this would provide an invaluable\
    \ musical service for both humans and birds. As an example, here is the first\
    \ fruit of my project, a rewrite of David Bowie's 1979 hit Boys Keep Swinging.\
    \ I hope you will agree that this revised version is superior in every way, particularly\
    \ from an ornithological point of view.\nHeaven loves ya\n  The clouds part for\
    \ ya\n  Nothing stands in your way\n  When you're a grebe\nPlumage regales ya\n\
    \  Life is a pop of the cherry\n  When you're a grebe\nWhen you're a grebe\n \
    \ You can soar through the air\n  When you're a grebe\n  Other grebes check you\
    \ out\n  You get a fish\n  These are your favourite things\n  When you're a grebe\n\
    Grebes\n  Grebes\n  Grebes keep swinging\n  Grebes always work it out\nUncage\
    \ the colours\n  Unfurl the flag\n  Luck just kissed you hello\n  When you're\
    \ a grebe\nThey'll never clone ya\n  You're always first on the line\n  When you're\
    \ a grebe\nWhen you're a grebe\n  You can dabble about on a pond\n  When you're\
    \ a grebe\n  Learn to dive and everything\n  You'll get your share\n  When you're\
    \ a grebe\nGrebes\n  Grebes\n  Grebes keep swinging\n  Grebes always work it out"
