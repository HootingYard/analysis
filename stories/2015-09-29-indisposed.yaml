  text: 'Since returning from my jaunt to Belgium I am afraid I have been somewhat
    indisposed. I shall spare you the details. Suffice to say that my brainpans remain
    in full (if uninspired) working order. Fine fettle? I would need to consult a
    qualified fettlist to be sure on that score.

    But things are gradually getting back to normal. There was a new piece in The
    Dabbler on Friday, and after the Resonance summer break Hooting Yard On The Air
    is back on the air. Last week''s show is available here, and I ought to remind
    you that each show now appears on Mixcloud almost as soon as it has been broadcast.

    Added to which, my book Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives is--at long
    last--published the day after tomorrow. Of which more later.

    In theory I will be back here tomorrow. Fingers crossed.'
