  text: "Since returning from my jaunt to Belgium I am afraid I have been somewhat\
    \ indisposed. I shall spare you the details. Suffice to say that my brainpans\
    \ remain in full (if uninspired) working order. Fine fettle? I would need to consult\
    \ a qualified fettlist to be sure on that score.\nBut things are gradually getting\
    \ back to normal. There was a new piece in The Dabbler on Friday, and after the\
    \ Resonance summer break Hooting Yard On The Air is back on the air. Last week's\
    \ show is available here, and I ought to remind you that each show now appears\
    \ on Mixcloud almost as soon as it has been broadcast.\nAdded to which, my book\
    \ Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives is\u2014at long last\u2014published\
    \ the day after tomorrow. Of which more later.\nIn theory I will be back here\
    \ tomorrow. Fingers crossed."
