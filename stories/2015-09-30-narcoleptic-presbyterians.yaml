  text: Tomorrow sees, at long last, the publication of my important reference book
    Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives. Within its pages you will learn, among
    much else, that Eric Clapton is an anagram of Narcoleptic, that Britney Spears
    is an anagram of Presbyterians, and that, during a foopball match in which the
    Brazilian Ronaldo faced an opposing defender named Rolando, a commentator asked
    "how long is it since Ronaldo was marked by an anagram of himself?". There is
    much more in the book other than anagrams, so go and queue up at your nearest
    bookshop for opening time tomorrow morning ...
