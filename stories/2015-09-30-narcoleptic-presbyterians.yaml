text: "Tomorrow sees, at long last, the publication of my important reference book\
  \ Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives. Within its pages you will learn, among\
  \ much else, that Eric Clapton is an anagram of Narcoleptic, that Britney Spears\
  \ is an anagram of Presbyterians, and that, during a foopball match in which the\
  \ Brazilian Ronaldo faced an opposing defender named Rolando, a commentator asked\
  \ \u201Chow long is it since Ronaldo was marked by an anagram of himself?\u201D\
  . There is much more in the book other than anagrams, so go and queue up at your\
  \ nearest bookshop for opening time tomorrow morning \u2026"
