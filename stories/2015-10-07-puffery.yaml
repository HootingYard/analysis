  text: 'Here is an (anonymous) review on Amazon of Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief,
    Brief Lives:

    This is a near-perfect example of a gift book that keeps on giving. Small and
    appealing, with a well-organised, encyclopaedia-style layout and charming portrait
    illustrations. The text is a delight--easy to dip in and out of, and full of facts
    that are perplexing, bizarre, amusing and sometimes poignant. What really sets
    it apart, however, is Frank Key''s unerring eye for the deliciously obscure and
    his unique sense of humour, which runs like a seam of precious metal through the
    book. An unexpected treasure.

    I need hardly remind you lot that you are under instructions to buy copies of
    the book for everybody you know. While you''re about it, you should add your ha''ppenyworth
    to the online reviews at Amazon. You know it makes sense.'
