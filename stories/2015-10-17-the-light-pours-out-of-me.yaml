  text: "\nHere is a snap taken at Yada's restaurant in Peckham last night, where\
    \ I did a reading as part of the LitCrawl festival. The photo was taken by one\
    \ of my fellow-readers, Tony White, and also on the bill was Audrey Reynolds.\
    \ I read a couple of stories and also took the opportunity to extol the many and\
    \ various virtues of Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives, waving a copy\
    \ of the book at the audience and reading a couple of extracts. This, for example,\
    \ provoked pleasingly immoderate laughter:\nScott, George R. (British poultry\
    \ expert, 20th century). Scott was the author of the 1934 book The Art Of Faking\
    \ Exhibition Poultry. In the introduction, Socrates, Galileo, Voltaire, Nietzsche\
    \ and D. H. Lawrence are each called to support his attack on the despicable practice,\
    \ nowhere more vile than in \u201Cthe pseudo-scientific Hogan cult, with all its\
    \ blowsy jargon; its crapulous fundament of snide anatomy; its noisy and prolific\
    \ drool of whim-wham\u201D."
