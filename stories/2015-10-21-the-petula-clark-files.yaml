    I keep my Petula Clark files in a remote secure storage facility. The perimeter
    fence is electrified, and patrolled by wolves. The wolves are not electrified,
    but I am working on it, in partnership with the animal behaviourist and amateur
    electrician Walter Mad. The wolves have been trained to become docile at my approach,
    but to attack savagely anybody else, including Walter Mad. The combination of
    fence and wolves and some fairly stout padlocks ensures that my Petula Clark files
    remain safe and secure.

    It is fifty years since I began my collection. There was a brief report in the
    local newspaper of the seaside town in which I then lived, announcing a forthcoming
    concert by Petula Clark. I snipped it out of the paper with a pair of scissors
    and put it on my desk, under a seaside pebble. Over the following few months I
    snipped out of various papers several reports in which Petula Clark was mentioned.
    Some of these were illustrated with photographs of the chanteuse, though the photographs
    themselves were of low quality, as were most newspaper photographs in those days.

    By the time I had accumulated five or six such snippages I lost all interest in
    Petula Clark. Looking back, it is fair to say that I was never particularly interested
    in her in the first place. I spent far more of my time, for example, thinking
    about and studying and even attempting to imitate the behaviour of wolves. Eventually,
    one blazing summer morn, I looked at the seaside pebble on my desk, and the five
    or six press clippings related to Petula Clark underneath it, and I resolved--with
    a sort of manly Jack Hawkins stern-jawed resolve--to find a more efficient storage
    method for them. After all, it had occurred to me more than once that, were I
    to move the seaside pebble for any reason, and my window was open, and a gust
    of wind blew in, billowing the curtains, the cuttings, all five or six of them,
    could be scattered, untidily, and--perhaps, perhaps--be lost forever.

    Hence the files, by which I refer to buff cardboard folders. I bought a packet
    of these at a stationer''s. I distinctly recall that on my walk to and from the
    shop, which took about fifteen minutes each way, I did not see a single wolf.
    This saddened me, but I was consoled, on the way back, that I had acquired a suitable
    means of storage for my collection of five or six Petula Clark press clippings.
    I was so eager to return home and set to work that I did not, as I usually did,
    stop off at the ice cream kiosk to buy a choc ice, which I would then eat while
    sitting on a seaside bench and staring out to sea. Walter Mad has hatched a scheme
    to use half-eaten choc ices as bait in the process of electrifying wolves. I must
    admit I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I feel sure it is sound.

    Once home, and having unwrapped from their cellophane the buff cardboard folders,
    I took five or six of them and placed a Petula Clark snippage into each one, having
    first, of course, moved the seaside pebble to one side on my desk. I considered
    marking the folders, for example by writing "Petula Clark Press Clipping No. 1"
    (and so on, up to No. 5 or No. 6) on the front of each one, but I decided against
    this. My decision was made the easier because, at the time, I recall I had mislaid
    my pencil, and I only discovered it some days later, tucked against the wainscot
    on the opposite side of the room. How it came to rest there I shall never know.

    I placed the folders in one of the desk drawers, made a cup of tea, and settled
    back to gaze at a picture book of wolves I had borrowed from the seaside library.
    It was long overdue, but I was young and feckless and reckless, and I did not
    give a hoot.

    Despite the fact that I no longer had any interest in Petula Clark, my collection
    was not yet complete. About three years later, riffling through a colour supplement,
    I came upon a quarter-page colour photograph of the star, and in a sudden frenzy,
    as if gripped by demons, I reached for my scissors and snipped it out. Fortunately,
    in spite of the passing of the years, I had the remainder of the buff cardboard
    folders close to hand. I took one, placed the colour photograph of Petula Clark
    inside it, and added it to the collection in the desk drawer. Outside, the sky
    had darkened, and I swore I could hear the distant howling of a wolf. At that
    time, I had not yet gained the acquaintance of Walter Mad, so I was not in a position
    to telephone him to confirm whether that was indeed what I heard.

    Many more years passed before I decided to transfer the Petula Clark files from
    my desk drawer to a remote secure storage facility. The process was surprisingly
    straightforward, and was accomplished in a single afternoon, with the assistance
    of Walter Mad, who by this time had become my boon companion. In addition to being
    an animal behaviourist and an amateur electrician, he also owned a van, which
    he drove at terrifying speed while wearing a pair of goggles and some sort of
    home-made cobbled-together gutta percha breathing apparatus. Having secured the
    Petula Clark files deep in the bowels of the facility, we drove back via an ice
    cream kiosk and stopped to eat celebratory choc ices while staring out to sea.

    I broke our contented silence by asking Walter Mad if wolves are able to swim.

    "That very much depends on the wolf and the conditions in the sea," he said.

    "And Petula Clark," I continued, "Can she swim?"

    "I am no expert in Petula Clark matters," he said, "But I expect she can, yes."

    That was precisely the answer I wanted to hear, though I could not think for the
    life of me why, as I had no great interest in Petula Clark, then or now.

    We digested our choc ices--Walter Mad saving half of his, uneaten, for baiting
    experiments with wolves--and drove away from the kiosk, as the sun sank in the
    west, and waves crashed relentlessly against the pointy rocks.'
