    For more years than I could count, my Petula Clark files had lain undisturbed
    in a remote secure storage facility guarded by wolves. It would be a platitude
    to say that the files were "gathering dust". It would also be untrue, for the
    storage facility was a dust-free one. The precise details of how this dustless
    state was achieved elude me, though no doubt it had something to do with the janitor''s
    proud boast that he kept a trained swarm of dust-gobbling bluebottles.

    It was this very same janitor who came hammering at my door one morning, waking
    me from uneasy dreams. I cannot recall precisely what figments in my sleeping
    brain so unnerved me, though bluebottles and Tony Blair and a bag of frozen crinkle-cut
    oven chips were all involved. I doused these phantoms by plunging my head into
    a pail of ice-cold water, then pranced like a ninny downstairs to answer the hammering.

    The janitor was gaunt and had the appearance of a wistful stickleback. If you
    find that a difficult image to visualise, fetch a pencil and a piece of paper
    and execute a sketch. Now do you see?

    The ostensible purpose of the janitor''s visit was to canvass for the Communist
    Party. I was not aware that there was an election in the offing, and told him
    so. He gave me that wistful stickleback gaze (see sketch) and muttered inanities.
    Nevertheless, I invited him in for a cup of boiling hot tap water and a biscuit.
    I do not receive many visitors, so when I do I like to lavish them with such hospitality
    as I can muster. I also considered that an early morning conversation with a Communist
    might help to dispel the last few vestiges of my uneasy dreams still swirling
    in my head.

    It was during the course of our discussion, when the janitor had exhausted the
    topics of imperialist lackeys and tractor production and ballet in the evenings,
    that he made mention of my Petula Clark files. What, he wanted to know, was my
    purpose in keeping them for so long, neglected and unattended? I have to admit
    that I had no ready answer to this question. I had no idea why I clung on to these
    six or seven Petula Clark files, each one a buff cardboard folder containing a
    single press clipping about Petula Clark, the original five or six files augmented
    at a slightly later date by the sixth or seventh which held a colour photograph
    of the chanteuse snipped from a colour supplement.

    I have been asked, from time to time, or, as per another singer, Cyndi Lauper,
    time after time, why I cannot be specific about the precise number of Petula Clark
    files, given they are so few. The truth of the matter is that I have so little
    interest in Petula Clark that I have never bothered to make a tally of the items
    in my collection. It is for the same reason that, having placed the Petula Clark
    files in storage, I very seldom trekked out to that remote facility to consult
    them. Indeed, I could not remember the last time I had visited, and nor could
    the janitor. It may be pertinent that I have yellow jaundice, as has the janitor.
    He is also green about the gills, but I am not.

    The janitor lost patience awaiting from me a reply which did not come, and he
    got up to leave. He excused himself by saying he had to attend the public humiliation
    of a bourgeois lickspittle. I think he was telling the truth, for I had noticed
    he was carrying a hooter in his knapsack, of the sort used to amplify imprecations
    and insults at deafening volume at close range to the ears of bourgeois lickspittles.
    I had once been accused of being such a lickspittle myself, and it was only by
    dint of pomposity and bribery by pastry delicacies that I escaped censure.

    Alone again, I fell to thinking. Usually, of course, in these circumstances I
    would think about wolves and their ways, but the janitor''s query had turned my
    mind to Petula Clark, or rather to the files I kept on her, and had kept, through
    thick and thin, over many decades. Would I not be better off removing the files
    from the remote secure storage facility and consigning them to a rubbish tip?
    Or, if I did not want them to go to waste, could I not burn them in my grate,
    and at least profit from a short period of welcome heat on one of the long winter
    nights when I shivered in my armchair, wrapped in several cardigans and two different
    woolly hats?

    Yet to discard or to destroy the Petula Clark files seemed to me both, somehow,
    to be unconscionable acts. I did not care very much for Petula Clark, and it was
    exceedingly unlikely she would ever learn of the files I kept on her, but what
    if she did?, what if she did? I think it is fair to say she would be distraught,
    albeit only mildly--though who can say?--and I had no wish to cause Petula Clark
    distress. I wish no pain upon anybody, unless it be a thief bent on breaking into
    the remote secure storage facility to pilfer my Petula Clark files, who will be
    savagely attacked at the perimeter fence by my trained, if not yet electrified
    wolves, and richly deserve to be torn to bits by their sharp and merciless fangs.

    No, it seemed to me that what I ought to do, what I ought to have done years ago,
    was to make good use of the Petula Clark files. But what use? In a flash of inspiration,
    I realised what I needed to do. I would devise a Petula Clark project, an activity
    which would not only keep me occupied in the twilight of my years but would also
    make full, novel, and innovative use of the materials in the Petula Clark files.
    I sprang up from my chair and cut three or four brisk capers around the room,
    as if I was James Boswell getting up in the morning. And then, panting with exertion,
    I resolved to embark upon the Petula Clark project without delay.

    But the years have taken their toll, and my resolve was no longer the manly Jack
    Hawkins stern-jawed resolve of my more youthful days, when I had resolved, successfully,
    to find an efficient storage method for the Petula Clark files. I was winded from
    my capers, and I slumped back in my armchair, panting like a wolf. Shortly thereafter,
    I fell asleep.

    I am happy to say I did not dream of bluebottles and Tony Blair and a bag of frozen
    crinkle-cut oven chips. I dreamed, instead, of Petula Clark, and the files, and
    the project I would devise once I awoke. At the time of writing, I am still asleep,
    effectively, if we consider that anything other than full bright brilliant bedazzling
    enlightened clarity of all five senses in a blaze of utter receptivity to the
    gorgeous world is a form of sleep. But when I do wake up, fully, ah, then ...'
