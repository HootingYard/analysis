  text: "Following the success of his box-office hit American Snipe, about a killer\
    \ bird, Clint Eastwood has announced his next project. Rather excitingly for all\
    \ of us here at Hooting Yard, the octogenarian titan of cinema has bought the\
    \ rights to the Petula Clark Trilogy. My understanding is that, rather than making\
    \ a series of three films, Bourne-style, Mr Eastwood intends to compact the narrative\
    \ into a single movie, entitled American Snipper. As this title indicates, the\
    \ film will be a character study of the collector who originally snipped out of\
    \ newspapers the Petula Clark cuttings. Thanks to Max D\xE9charn\xE9, I am able\
    \ to reproduce one such cutting here. (Click to enlarge.)\n"
