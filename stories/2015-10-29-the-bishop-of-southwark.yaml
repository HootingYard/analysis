    An unseemly number of enquiries arrive at Hooting Yard HQ asking why yesterday''s
    postage In Ponga makes reference to the Bishop of Southwark. The answer is simple,
    and is given in the form of an exclusive extract from Mr Key''s Shorter Potted
    Brief, Brief Lives, available now from all good bookshops, both actual and virtual.

    Butler, Tom (English bishop, b. 1940). In December 2006, Paul and Nicola Sumpter
    were sitting in a bar near Southwark Cathedral when they heard their car alarm
    go off. Rushing outside, they found a grey-haired man in the back seat of the
    car, throwing the toys of their infant son out of the window. When challenged,
    the man said "I''m the bishop of Southwark. It''s what I do". He then got out
    of the car and disappeared into the night, leaving behind a bag containing, among
    other things, his crucifix.'
