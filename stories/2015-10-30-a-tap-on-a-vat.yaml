  text: Let us imagine you install a tap on the side of a vat. You will then be able
    to transfer the contents of the vat, bit by bit, into a pail, a pail which you
    can then lug, panting and perspiring, for many many miles o'er the fields. What
    better way to spend a Tuesday afternoon as winter approaches?
