  text: "Given the seeming ubiquity of vampires in contemporary popular culture, I\
    \ am surprised that nobody has thought to produce an ornithologically-themed vampire\
    \ TV series\u2014especially when I learn, from this morning's Tweet of the Day\
    \ on BBC Radio Four, that there is, in the Galapagos Islands, a vampire finch\
    \ which sucks the blood of blue-footed boobies. I am always looking for an excuse\
    \ to show a picture of the latter bird, so here are a couple of them.\n"
