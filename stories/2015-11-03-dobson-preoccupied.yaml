  text: "\u201CYou seem preoccupied, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew to the out of\
    \ print pamphleteer one morning over breakfast. It was a thunderous day of thunder\
    \ and thunderclaps and the couple were tucking into boiled suet \u2018n\u2019\
    \ marzipan \xE0\_la Metternich, a dish extolled in a footnote in Dobson's pamphlet\
    \ Breakfast Favourites Of The Austrian Empire Foreign Ministry 1809\u20131821\
    \ (out of print).\nDobson did not reply, for he was preoccupied.\nThe following\
    \ morning, over breakfast, Marigold Chew became so perturbed at Dobson's seeming\
    \ residence in la-la land that she resorted to the Dusty Springfield method to\
    \ snap him out of it. Named after the 1960s popstrel's hobby, this involved the\
    \ systematic smashing of crockery by throwing plates and dishes one by one with\
    \ great, indeed hysterical, force against the wall. Several smithereens lay scattered\
    \ on the floor before Dobson was of a sudden unpreoccupied.\n\u201CAh, good morning,\
    \ my buttercup of unparalleled gorgeousness,\u201D said Dobson, through a mouthful\
    \ of steamed shredded hyacinth stalks in syrup.\n\u201CYou have been terribly\
    \ preoccupied, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CWhatever is going on in\
    \ that brain of yours?\u201D\n\u201CI am inwardly tussling,\u201D said Dobson,\
    \ \u201CWith my latest pamphlet, to which I have given the working title Andy\
    \ Martin, The Tyrannical Leader Of UNIT, And Why He Is The Most Fantastic Person\
    \ In The Visible Universe\u201D.\n\u201CI have no doubt your inner tussle will\
    \ prove as productive as ever,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CBut may I make\
    \ one small point, a point which I suggest is germane to your tussle and preoccupation?\u201D\
    \n\u201CAnd what would that be, oh daffodil of my dreams?\u201D said Dobson.\n\
    \u201CWell, as you and I and your optometrist know only too well, Dobson, you\
    \ are severely myopic. Thus, for you, the visible universe does not stretch very\
    \ far. Indeed, it stops just a few inches away from the front of your head. I\
    \ do not see Andy Martin, tyrannical leader of UNIT, in the vicinity, and I feel\
    \ sure I would spot him were he within a few inches of, or indeed sitting at,\
    \ my breakfast table.\u201D\n\u201CI am going to go and chuck pebbles at swans,\u201D\
    \ said Dobson, getting up from his chair and putting on his Swabian Bus Ticket\
    \ Collector's boots and crashing out of the door into the downpour which, as on\
    \ the day before, was accompanied by thunderous thunder and thunderclaps. Marigold\
    \ Chew had raised a sticky problem about his pamphlet, one he did not wish to\
    \ discuss, indeed could not discuss. Hence his sudden departure, leaving his breakfast\
    \ unfinished.\nUnfortunately, so sudden was his departure that Dobson neglected\
    \ to put on his specs. Unable to see more than a few inches ahead, he blundered\
    \ towards where he thought the duckpond was, only to take a wrong turn and find\
    \ himself hopelessly lost in a patch of bracken and rustic filth. He found himself,\
    \ too, once more preoccupied, but this time on a wholly different subject. Why,\
    \ he wondered, was the duckpond, populated as it was mostly by swans, called the\
    \ duckpond rather than the swanpond? It was true that ducks were occasionally\
    \ to be found dabbling upon it, but any such ducks tended to scarper pretty quickly\
    \ when ganged up on by the savage and violent, yet indubitably elegant, swans.\n\
    \u201CI wonder,\u201D said Dobson to himself, aloud, in the mist of his own myopia,\
    \ \u201CWhether I ought to abandon the Andy Martin, tyrannical leader of UNIT,\
    \ business for the time being and instead turn my propelling pencil to the question\
    \ of duckpond nomenclature?\u201D\nAnd there was then a terrifically thunderous\
    \ and thundery thunderclap, which Dobson chose to interpret as the Gods replying\
    \ to his question in the affirmative. Turning in the direction he thought would\
    \ take him home, he wrapped his Stalinist scarf tighter round his neck and squelched\
    \ through the muck. But alas!, the pamphleteer's sense of direction was as pitiful\
    \ as his eyesight, and several weeks passed before he found his way home, by which\
    \ time he had completely forgotten about duckponds and swanponds.\n\u201CWhat\
    \ is the subject of the pamphlet you are working on?\u201D asked Marigold Chew\
    \ over breakfast on the morning after Dobson's return.\n\u201CIt is called Fortune-Telling\
    \ By Interpreting The Patterns Created By Crockery Smithereens Smashed According\
    \ To The Dusty Springfield Method,\u201D said Dobson, \u201CAnd I expect to be\
    \ able to dot the final i and cross the final t this very afternoon.\u201D\nAnd\
    \ he did, though the pamphlet itself is currently out of print."
