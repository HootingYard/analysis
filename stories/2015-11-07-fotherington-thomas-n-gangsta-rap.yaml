  text: '

    My more astute readers will be aware that I have, for many years, immersed myself
    in the world of gangsta rap. Indeed, only the other day Ice-T popped round for
    a cup of (non-iced) tea and we had a long and frank discussion about all sorts
    of gangsta rappy topics. I am of course completely au fait with the argot, so
    much so that even Ice himself had difficulty understanding me.

    I mention this as a preamble to my news that I have been commissioned by an academic
    press to edit a book of essays exploring the crucial influence, in the development
    of gangsta rap, of fotherington-tomas. I think we all know that the St Custard''s
    pupil who is uterly wet and a sissy is the presiding spirit of gangsta rap, the
    role model whose example Ice-T and all the other rappers, whose names escape me
    for the moment, strive to emulate.

    Submissions for the book are welcome, and please bear in mind that you will be
    forgiven if your essay contains any uncouth words.'
