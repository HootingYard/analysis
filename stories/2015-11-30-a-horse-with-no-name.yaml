  text: 'I was riding through the desert on a horse with no name. This was asking
    for trouble, and sure enough, after passing plants and birds and rocks and things
    and sand and hills and rings we arrived at a Horse Registration Station. A cowpoke
    in a poncho bid us to stop, so I pulled on the reins and patted my horse on its
    horsey head.

    "Before you go any further I must register your horse," said the cowpoke.

    "Register away!" I said, blithely I hoped. I had practised blitheness of speech
    at drama school, but only now did I understand the yawning gulf between strutting
    upon the stage and negotiating the real world of deserts and Horse Registration
    Stations manned by enponchoed cowpokes.

    "First I will need the name of your horse," he said.

    "And what will you need second?" I asked, playing for time.

    "Second I will need any aliases or pseudonyms by which your horse is known."

    I wondered what would happen if I cried "Yippee-ky-oh-ky-ay!" and dug my spurs
    into the horse''s horsey flanks and galloped away, leaving the cowpoke in a trail
    of dust.

    "Don''t get any funny ideas about galloping off on an unregistered horse," said
    the cowpoke, adding "You won''t get far" with an air of menace. I am unusually
    alert to threats of menace, by dint of hard experience, and I do not mean merely
    stage menace as met with in certain plays by certain dramatists. No. I mean real
    menace in the real world of plants and birds and rocks and things and sand and
    hills and rings.

    For one wild moment I considered lying, plucking a name for my nameless horse
    from within the dark ignorant recesses of my cranial integuments. But the cowpoke
    again forestalled me. Was he a clairvoyant cowpoke?

    "And don''t just make up a name," he warned, "I will know if you are lying, and
    by the martyred sinews of Saint Blodwyst, you will not want to suffer the consequences
    of trying to pull the wool over my eyes."

    I did not doubt him. He spoke with the kind of effortless authority of a character
    I had once played, to no little acclaim, in a stage production of something or
    other by one of the Norwegian playwrights.

    I had little option but to blurt out the truth.

    "My horse has no name," I blurted.

    The cowpoke did not react immediately. Then he fixed me with a gaze that would
    have chilled the blood were we not broiling in the heat of the desert. He looked
    at me, and then he looked at the horse. He rummaged in his poncho. He hummed a
    snatch of light opera, Il Ingrazziatiniatoni-apoppiapippi, I think. Then he took
    from within his poncho a pebble, and with sudden and devastating accuracy threw
    it up into the sky and clonked a bird, which plummeted to earth stone dead at
    his feet.

    "Each time a nameless horse tries to pass this Station," he said, "A bird must
    die. So it is written. Learn that lesson well, stranger. Now turn around and do
    not return."

    "Where is it written?" I asked.

    But the cowpoke had taken from within his poncho a shovel, and was busy burying
    the bird in the desert sand.

    I turned my horse about, dug in my spurs, and we galloped away, back whence we
    had come, all the way across the desert, all the way back to the eastern seaboard
    and the theatre on the pier at Point Punctilio, where the tattered posters were
    still just about legible, the posters that advertised our critically-panned performance
    of The Tragedy of Trubshaw, about a lone rider, and his horse, a horse with no
    name.'
