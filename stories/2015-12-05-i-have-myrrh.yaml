  text: "I have an acquaintance whose infant son has landed his first dramatic role.\
    \ He is two and a half, and will be playing one of the Three Wise Men in his nursery\
    \ nativity play. The part calls for him to deliver the line \u201CI have myrrh\u201D\
    .\nHe has been rehearsing with admirable diligence. It is, I think, a credit to\
    \ his acting skills that, while one rarely, if ever, encounters myrrh in 21st\
    \ century Britain, he gives a compelling performance and one truly believes that,\
    \ yes, this small child does indeed have myrrh. And he has been able to inhabit\
    \ fully the character of the Wise Man without having to ask the director \u201C\
    what's my motivation?\u201D. He comes to it naturally.\nAs Sir Laurence Olivier\
    \ said to Dustin Hoffman on the set of Marathon Man, when the latter expressed\
    \ surprise that Olivier did not employ \u201Cthe Method\u201D, \u201CIt's called\
    \ acting, dear boy\u201D."
