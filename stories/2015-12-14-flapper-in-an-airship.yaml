  text: 'Some writers are so damned original that they create their own genre. This
    is true even of certain pulp writers, such as the American scribbler Brent Crude,
    who was born on this day in 1882. After knocking out short stories at a prodigious
    rate for magazines such as Amazing Yarns, Astonishing Yarns, and Breathtaking
    Yarns, in 1922 Crude published his first full-length novel. Flapper In An Airship
    introduced readers to his heroine the flapper in an airship, and thus was born
    the entire flapper-in-an-airship genre.

    Over the following two decades, dozens of hacks bashed out novels about flappers
    in airships, but none could match Brent Crude''s industry, nor indeed his ability
    to devise page-turning pot-boilers about flappers in airships. By the time of
    his death in 1941, it is thought he had written over fifty novels featuring the
    flapper in an airship.

    Interestingly, Brent Crude was an exact contemporary, 1882 to 1941, of both James
    Joyce and Virginia Woolf. If he is little read today, it is probably because both
    flappers and airships have fallen out of fashion. I think, however, he is due
    for a revival. This is not a view shared by the literary critic Prig Blot, one
    of the few people who has read all of Crude''s work (or at least claims to have
    done so).

    "These so-called flapper in an airship novels," he contends, "are all much of
    a muchness, Careful analysis of the texts, as carried out by me in my Scandinavian
    ivory tower overlooking the fjords and glaciers of my homeland, demonstrates conclusively
    that Brent Crude simply shuffled about the same sentences and paragraphs of his
    first novel, over and over again, occasionally inserting a different adjective
    here and there. I have wasted ten years of my life reading and rereading and rerereading
    these foolish books, years I can never regain, and my soul is corroded, and all
    I am good for now is to eke out what time is left to me chewing salted fish and
    sobbing into my Scandinavian napkin."

    All of Brent Crude''s books are currently out of print.'
