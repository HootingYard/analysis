  text: 'Chocks away! Yes, in a spasm of insane generosity, I have decided to give
    away all my chocks for Christmas. I shall be distributing them among the poor,
    the indigent, the feckless, and the riff-raff--that is, pretty much the entire
    population of my particularly insalubrious bailiwick. I am going to give away
    every last chock--the one under the draining board, the one beside the bathroom
    radiator, the many and various chocks scattered higgledy-piggledy wherever I cast
    my myopic gaze. Do bear in mind that I am not talking about chocs, as in chocolates.
    I mean chocks. If you are not sure what I am talking about, go and siphon out
    your ears.

    Hooting Yard''s Christmas Chocks Away! Initiative is sponsored by evil plutocrats.'
