  text: "Chocks away! Yes, in a spasm of insane generosity, I have decided to give\
    \ away all my chocks for Christmas. I shall be distributing them among the poor,\
    \ the indigent, the feckless, and the riff-raff\u2014that is, pretty much the\
    \ entire population of my particularly insalubrious bailiwick. I am going to give\
    \ away every last chock\u2014the one under the draining board, the one beside\
    \ the bathroom radiator, the many and various chocks scattered higgledy-piggledy\
    \ wherever I cast my myopic gaze. Do bear in mind that I am not talking about\
    \ chocs, as in chocolates. I mean chocks. If you are not sure what I am talking\
    \ about, go and siphon out your ears.\nHooting Yard's Christmas Chocks Away! Initiative\
    \ is sponsored by evil plutocrats."
