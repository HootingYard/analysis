  text: '

    It has become the tradition here at Hooting Yard to herald the new year with a
    2010 quotation from Peter Hitchens. This year, his magnificent words appear over
    at The Dabbler, which has kindly added a puff for my book Mr Key''s Shorter Potted
    Brief, Brief Lives. Alas, this important work of reference did not, as I hoped,
    become a hugely successful pre-Christmas bestseller, so I shall probably be reduced
    to buttonholing strangers in the streets and imploring them to buy a copy, as
    I weep and dribble.'
