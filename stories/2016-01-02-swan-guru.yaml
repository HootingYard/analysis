  text: 'The new year got off to an auspicious start yesterday morning. Almost the
    first words I heard, after tuning in to Farming Today on BBC Radio Four, were
    "swan guru". Outside, it was still the dark before dawn, but I resolved, with
    new year vim, to go in search of my very own swan guru.

    I was not listening to the radio with sufficient attention to learn whether a
    swan guru was, on the one hand, a human being possessed of breathtaking insight
    into swans or, on the other, a swan possessed of breathtaking spiritual insight
    which could act as my teacher and guide. But I knew which one I preferred, and
    it wasn''t the human being. And so, as the first light of the new year spread
    across the sky, like a patient etherised upon a table, I set out for Nameless
    Pond, in search of a swan.

    As I lolloped towards the pond, I recalled the popular Hooting Yard series Notable
    Authors Sitting On Swans, which featured photographs of notable authors sitting
    on swans. The swan upon which the infant Raymond Roussel sat, for example--was
    it a mere swan, or was it the writer''s swan guru? I did not suppose I would ever
    know the answer to that question, but just posing it made me all the keener to
    lay claim to my own swan guru.


    Standing at the edge of Nameless Pond, on which several sprightly and savage new
    year swans were scudding, I tried to determine which one would be the perfect
    spiritual teacher. But then I was struck by two thoughts. One, I am extremely
    myopic. Two, I am ornithologically ignorant. If I were to pick a particular swan,
    here and now, as my guru, would I be able to recognise that swan on subsequent
    visits to Nameless Pond? I had to concede that this seemed unlikely. In my world,
    a swan is a swan is a swan. Well then, that being so, why not choose the swan
    nearest at hand as my guru? Next time I came here, the nearest swan might well
    be an entirely different swan, but did that really matter, so long as I received
    from it the spiritual succour I sought?

    Convinced that I had hit upon an effective method of mitigating my myopia and
    ornithological ignorance, I fixed my gaze upon the nearest swan. The next couple
    of minutes would prove critical. I had to lay myself open, fully receptive to
    whatever spiritual wisdom the swan saw fit to impart to me. The better to accomplish
    this, I gawped, open-mouthed, dribbling slightly, like a dim-witted child. I tried
    to empty my brain of all conscious thought, and I succeeded so well that I toppled
    over, having forgotten how to stand upright. Sprawled in the pondside mud, I sensed
    a terrifying inrush of what I can only describe as swanness or swanosity. It surged
    through me, magnificently.

    I stood up, dusted myself down, bid adieu to my swan guru with a wave of my hand,
    and set off for home. Woe betide anybody I met along the way. With one thwack
    of my wing, I would break their arm.'
