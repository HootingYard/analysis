  text: "Spigot Boy was the eponymous hero of a cartoon strip that ran in the children's\
    \ comic The Ipsy Dipsy Doo during the early 1950s. Each week, Spigot Boy's adventures\
    \ stuck to a rigid formula. The strip consisted of just four panels, in the course\
    \ of which the tousle-haired nipper would happen upon an imminent act of civic\
    \ malfeasance which he would then foil by disguising himself as a spigot. Given\
    \ these limitations, there was, in each episode, a bewildering fecundity of invention.\n\
    Though it no doubt went over the heads of the infant readership, one of the great\
    \ pleasures of the Spigot Boy strip was that in each episode, at least one of\
    \ the speech bubbles would contain a direct quotation from the works of Gerard\
    \ Manley Hopkins. Almost always, the words chosen seemed to fit seamlessly, with\
    \ no sense that they had been shoehorned in. Occasionally, of course, adherence\
    \ to the formula meant there was a rather forced, gratuitous quality to the Hopkins\
    \ quotation, but even when that did happen the strip was saved by, for example,\
    \ the inclusion of a startlingly-executed picture of a wheatear or a nuthatch\
    \ in the sky just above and to the left of Spigot Boy's head in the moments before\
    \ he adopted his spigot disguise and foiled the schemes of that week's civic malefactor.\n\
    The strip was discontinued after the editrix of The Ipsy Dipsy Doo realised that\
    \ the villains in each episode were in fact crude caricatures of some of the leading\
    \ professional foopballers of the day, many of whom were called either Wally or\
    \ Nat. One seldom meets with top flight professionals named Wally or Nat in the\
    \ game nowadays, which is a great pity.\nBut thereagain, one seldom meets with\
    \ a tousle-haired nipper, fictional or otherwise, who can expertly disguise himself\
    \ as a fully-functioning spigot at the drop of a hat. That, I think, is a greater\
    \ pity. And I should know, because I know more about pity than anybody. Pity,\
    \ putty, and putti\u2014those are my areas of expertise, and you would do well\
    \ to remember that, for when I am crossed my rages are terrible, not unlike those\
    \ of a 1950s infant whose copy of The Ipsy Dipsy Doo has been snatched from his\
    \ tiny little hands and cast into the fire, where it is consumed by flames more\
    \ terrible than the flames of the deepest pit of hell."
