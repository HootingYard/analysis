  text: This is a brief reminder that each week's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air
    is now posted on Mixcloud almost as soon as it has been broadcast. Delve through
    the archives and you can listen to Mr Key babbling into your eardrums until the
    cows come home. Yesterday's show includes a sort of homage to David Bowie on his
    69th birthday, and the text appears in today's Dabbler, so if you wish you can
    read and listen at the same time.
