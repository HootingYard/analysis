    under the title Ten Amazing Facts About Maison Crimplene That Will Make You Dribble
    Into A Tin Bowl.

    The ceilings of Maison Crimplene are painted blue, with scattered spots of brilliant
    gold, to resemble a mediaeval painted sky. The floors are uniformly filthy. They
    have never seen a mop.

    On one wall of the tea ceremony parlour in Maison Crimplene hangs a hyperrealist
    portrait of John Prescott, painted by the noted hyperrealist Rex Hyper. On the
    opposite wall hangs a similar painting of Prescott''s wife Pauline. They are gazing
    at each other, forever.

    The major domo of Maison Crimplene is Pottymouth Peabrain of Plovdiv. Each time
    he opens his mouth it pours forth a tirade of disgusting abuse. But he speaks
    in Bulgarian, which few visitors to Maison Crimplene understand.

    The bomb that tore through the cellars of Maison Crimplene but somehow left the
    building standing was planted by a gormless idiot boy from the nearest village,
    across the lake. He drowned in the lake shortly afterwards, when he toppled from
    his dinghy, surprised by a tern.

    A black and white photograph of Maison Crimplene, taken at long distance from
    a mountain peak, appears on the cover of the September 1956 issue of Maisons Snapped
    From Mountains magazine. Its editrix at the time was noted hyperrealist painter
    Rex Hyper''s sister, Dot Photog.

    The extensive gardens of Maison Crimplene are littered with discarded bubblegum
    wrappers. Brutes with tails disport themselves in the trees and bushes, grunting
    in the daylight hours and howling in the night.

    In one room of Maison Crimplene, off the main passageway and down a short flight
    of slippery steps, are stacked hundreds and hundreds of gunny sacks crammed with
    gutta-percha. Ticks creep up and down the walls of this room.

    During the Second World War, troops from several combatant nations were billeted
    in Maison Crimplene, sometimes at the same time. Fighting,, brawling, and stabbings
    were averted through an unspoken code of bonhomie, exquisite manners, and pipe-smoking.

    Oh! the chandeliers in Maison Crimplene, the chandeliers!

    The most expensive room at Maison Crimplene is the one where Perry Como once stayed,
    accompanied by a pair of puppets made by the noted Swiss puppeteer Rolf Swisspupp.
    Como''s bill was settled by the priest from the nearest village, across the lake,
    in which the gormless idiot boy drowned when he toppled from his dinghy, surprised
    by a tern.'
