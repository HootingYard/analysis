  text: 'O let us now sing the praises of noted Swiss puppeteer Rolf Swisspupp! Preferably
    to a free jazz accompaniment, with bongos! Or, on second thoughts, let us not,
    for when we sing it is a godawful caterwauling that sets the teeth on edge and
    makes birds plummet from the sky, stone dead. Instead, let us list some of the
    books which, over the past forty years, the noted Swiss puppeteer has interpreted,
    in dramatic form, in eighteen-hour puppet shows, to adoring audiences in every
    canton of Switzerland.

    The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann

    One Lonely Night by Mickey Spillane

    Me And My Ectoplasm by Algernon Spooky

    The Decline Of The West by Oswald Spengler

    Chappaquiddick : The Real Story by James Lange and K DeWitt Jr

    Verbose Twaddle by Will Self

    The Loch Ness Mystery Solved by Ronald Binns

    The Thing On The Doorstep by H P Lovecraft

    The Prisoner Of Zenda by Anthony Hope

    The Prisoner Of Brenda by Max Decharne

    Rolf Swisspupp''s puppets are made from his own secret, patented substance known
    as Swiss Puppetene(tm), and this gives them an eerily lifelike appearance. In
    the words of the puppeteering critic Horst Puppcrit, "these puppets are eerily
    lifelike, if a few conjoined and twisted pipe-cleaners and a knob of putty can
    be imbued with life".

    The puppets are mute, chiefly because Rolf Swisspupp''s voicebox was surgically
    removed following a traumatic childhood ice-skating accident. The sheer dramatic
    intensity of his productions is made all the more sheer and dramatic and intense
    by the resounding silence in which they are performed. Dropped pins, etcetera.

    In person, Rolf Swisspupp has a haunted and ravaged appearance, which has led
    to rumours that, when he is alone with his puppets, they come to life and torment
    him, as Michael Redgrave was tormented by his ventriloquist''s dummy in the film
    Dead Of Night (1945). Certainly it is true that the Swiss puppeteer has been found
    on occasion staggering through the streets of Zurich and Lucerne and Winterthur
    and Geneva, drink-sodden and incontinent.

    But if he is a tragic figure, he is also enormously popular with Swiss tinies,
    who clap their little hands and screech with joy at the mere mention of his name.
    So if, today, we do not sing his praises, we can screech them, like a small overtired
    Swiss child, screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech
    and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech
    and screech until we are carted off and confined to a remote Swiss facility, high
    in the Alps, where brutish orderlies will torment us with pipe-cleaners and knobs
    of putty.'
