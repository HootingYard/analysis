  text: "O let us now sing the praises of noted Swiss puppeteer Rolf Swisspupp! Preferably\
    \ to a free jazz accompaniment, with bongos! Or, on second thoughts, let us not,\
    \ for when we sing it is a godawful caterwauling that sets the teeth on edge and\
    \ makes birds plummet from the sky, stone dead. Instead, let us list some of the\
    \ books which, over the past forty years, the noted Swiss puppeteer has interpreted,\
    \ in dramatic form, in eighteen-hour puppet shows, to adoring audiences in every\
    \ canton of Switzerland.\nThe Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann\nOne Lonely Night\
    \ by Mickey Spillane\nMe And My Ectoplasm by Algernon Spooky\nThe Decline Of The\
    \ West by Oswald Spengler\nChappaquiddick\_: The Real Story by James Lange and\
    \ K DeWitt Jr\nVerbose Twaddle by Will Self\nThe Loch Ness Mystery Solved by Ronald\
    \ Binns\nThe Thing On The Doorstep by H P Lovecraft\nThe Prisoner Of Zenda by\
    \ Anthony Hope\nThe Prisoner Of Brenda by Max D\xE9charn\xE9\nRolf Swisspupp's\
    \ puppets are made from his own secret, patented substance known as Swiss Puppetene\u2122\
    , and this gives them an eerily lifelike appearance. In the words of the puppeteering\
    \ critic Horst Puppcrit, \u201Cthese puppets are eerily lifelike, if a few conjoined\
    \ and twisted pipe-cleaners and a knob of putty can be imbued with life\u201D\
    .\nThe puppets are mute, chiefly because Rolf Swisspupp's voicebox was surgically\
    \ removed following a traumatic childhood ice-skating accident. The sheer dramatic\
    \ intensity of his productions is made all the more sheer and dramatic and intense\
    \ by the resounding silence in which they are performed. Dropped pins, etcetera.\n\
    In person, Rolf Swisspupp has a haunted and ravaged appearance, which has led\
    \ to rumours that, when he is alone with his puppets, they come to life and torment\
    \ him, as Michael Redgrave was tormented by his ventriloquist's dummy in the film\
    \ Dead Of Night (1945). Certainly it is true that the Swiss puppeteer has been\
    \ found on occasion staggering through the streets of Zurich and Lucerne and Winterthur\
    \ and Geneva, drink-sodden and incontinent.\nBut if he is a tragic figure, he\
    \ is also enormously popular with Swiss tinies, who clap their little hands and\
    \ screech with joy at the mere mention of his name. So if, today, we do not sing\
    \ his praises, we can screech them, like a small overtired Swiss child, screech\
    \ and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and\
    \ screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech and screech\
    \ until we are carted off and confined to a remote Swiss facility, high in the\
    \ Alps, where brutish orderlies will torment us with pipe-cleaners and knobs of\
    \ putty."
