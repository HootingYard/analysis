    Have you noticed, when handling your Android device, that if you try to turn the
    screen round to view it upside down, it immediately flips to restore the default
    view? This was trumpeted as an exciting and "user-friendly" feature of tablet
    computers from the very first. It is of course nothing of the sort. It is, rather,
    a blatant example of the capitalist military industrial complex, probably abetted
    by the Freemasons and the Zionists and the lizard people from outer space, preventing
    you from realising that the Android is, in reality, a Clotcud--as revealed below.
