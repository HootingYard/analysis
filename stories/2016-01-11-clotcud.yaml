    \ They Don't Want You To Know.\nHave you noticed, when handling your Android device,\
    \ that if you try to turn the screen round to view it upside down, it immediately\
    \ flips to restore the default view? This was trumpeted as an exciting and \u201C\
    user-friendly\u201D feature of tablet computers from the very first. It is of\
    \ course nothing of the sort. It is, rather, a blatant example of the capitalist\
    \ military industrial complex, probably abetted by the Freemasons and the Zionists\
    \ and the lizard people from outer space, preventing you from realising that the\
    \ Android is, in reality, a Clotcud\u2014as revealed below.\n"
