  text: 'Between the years 1787 and 1804, in the ethereal realms, the dead Gluck and
    the unborn Glinka became friends and allies. They were drawn together by mutual
    puzzlement at the absence, from those very realms, of Buxtehude, who had been
    dead since 1707 and ought, therefore, to have put in an appearance in the mystic
    aether. Gluck and Glinka, or their spirit-essences, set out to track down Buxtehude,
    or his immortal soul, a quest which only came to an end when Glinka was transformed
    into a material mewling infant in 1804. Gluck had to drum his heels and await
    Glinka''s return to the ethereal realms in 1857. By this time, of course, Buxtehude''s
    immortal soul had been missing for a full one hundred and fifty years, which is
    as close as dammit to a cut-off point in the world of spirits.

    This is the conceit of an unfinished novel by Algernon Spooky, the so-called "psychic
    windowcleaner" who has a walk-on part in virtually every single biography and
    memoir of the first half of the twentieth century. Spooky seems to have known
    everybody, and frequently got into fist-fights with them. He was a commanding
    figure, described by Pipton as resembling a cross between a Roman emperor and
    a harrier hawk, with a bit of the temple of Angkor Wat thrown in. Unfortunately
    for the fate of his novel, Algernon Spooky had a tin ear and knew nothing of music,
    so his attempts to bring the souls of Gluck and Glinka and Buxtehude to fictional
    life are, in the words of Pipton again, "like watching an idiot child drool into
    a tin cup".

    After scribbling thousands and thousands of words, Spooky realised he was making
    a fool of himself--not for the first time--and tried to rework the material into
    a detective thriller. Here, Gluck, Glinka, and Buxtehude became a trio of malefactors
    plotting dark and dismal deeds. They hid in plain sight, operating from a high-street
    shoe shop clearly modelled on Freeman, Hardy and Willis. Only when Freeman, or
    Hardy, or Willis, or Freeman and Hardy, or Hardy and Willis, or Freeman and Willis,
    or for Christ''s sake let us have done with it, all three of them, got wind of
    Spooky''s tale and threatened him with a libel suit did that manuscript, too,
    end up in the dustbin.

    But being Algernon Spooky, it was no ordinary dustbin. He styled it his Magical
    Ancient Egyptian Dustbin From The Realm Of Thoth, and scratched various arcane
    symbols upon it. He then tried to sell the dustbin to a credulous follower, the
    Dowager Duchess Dipsy of Poxhaven, warning her that she must never, ever remove
    the lid from the dustbin for fear of unleashing several malign demons from the
    ancient mystic city of Gaar. Even poor dim-witted Dipsy saw this for the poppycock
    it was, and she had Algernon Spooky dragged out of her drawing-room and beaten
    to within an inch of his life, with cudgels, by her valet, the one time champion
    wrestler Dinsmore. What happened to the dustbin thereafter is not known.

    Algernon Spooky''s illegitimate daughter Poubelle, who acted as his literary executrix,
    consistently denied the existence of the two Gluck, Glinka, and Buxtehude manuscripts.
    It was only when Pipton bashed her repeatedly on the head with an electric toaster
    that she finally spilled the beans.'
