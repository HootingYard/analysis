  text: "Between the years 1787 and 1804, in the ethereal realms, the dead Gluck and\
    \ the unborn Glinka became friends and allies. They were drawn together by mutual\
    \ puzzlement at the absence, from those very realms, of Buxtehude, who had been\
    \ dead since 1707 and ought, therefore, to have put in an appearance in the mystic\
    \ aether. Gluck and Glinka, or their spirit-essences, set out to track down Buxtehude,\
    \ or his immortal soul, a quest which only came to an end when Glinka was transformed\
    \ into a material mewling infant in 1804. Gluck had to drum his heels and await\
    \ Glinka's return to the ethereal realms in 1857. By this time, of course, Buxtehude's\
    \ immortal soul had been missing for a full one hundred and fifty years, which\
    \ is as close as dammit to a cut-off point in the world of spirits.\nThis is the\
    \ conceit of an unfinished novel by Algernon Spooky, the so-called \u201Cpsychic\
    \ windowcleaner\u201D who has a walk-on part in virtually every single biography\
    \ and memoir of the first half of the twentieth century. Spooky seems to have\
    \ known everybody, and frequently got into fist-fights with them. He was a commanding\
    \ figure, described by Pipton as resembling a cross between a Roman emperor and\
    \ a harrier hawk, with a bit of the temple of Angkor Wat thrown in. Unfortunately\
    \ for the fate of his novel, Algernon Spooky had a tin ear and knew nothing of\
    \ music, so his attempts to bring the souls of Gluck and Glinka and Buxtehude\
    \ to fictional life are, in the words of Pipton again, \u201Clike watching an\
    \ idiot child drool into a tin cup\u201D.\nAfter scribbling thousands and thousands\
    \ of words, Spooky realised he was making a fool of himself\u2014not for the first\
    \ time\u2014and tried to rework the material into a detective thriller. Here,\
    \ Gluck, Glinka, and Buxtehude became a trio of malefactors plotting dark and\
    \ dismal deeds. They hid in plain sight, operating from a high-street shoe shop\
    \ clearly modelled on Freeman, Hardy and Willis. Only when Freeman, or Hardy,\
    \ or Willis, or Freeman and Hardy, or Hardy and Willis, or Freeman and Willis,\
    \ or for Christ's sake let us have done with it, all three of them, got wind of\
    \ Spooky's tale and threatened him with a libel suit did that manuscript, too,\
    \ end up in the dustbin.\nBut being Algernon Spooky, it was no ordinary dustbin.\
    \ He styled it his Magical Ancient Egyptian Dustbin From The Realm Of Thoth, and\
    \ scratched various arcane symbols upon it. He then tried to sell the dustbin\
    \ to a credulous follower, the Dowager Duchess Dipsy of Poxhaven, warning her\
    \ that she must never, ever remove the lid from the dustbin for fear of unleashing\
    \ several malign demons from the ancient mystic city of Gaar. Even poor dim-witted\
    \ Dipsy saw this for the poppycock it was, and she had Algernon Spooky dragged\
    \ out of her drawing-room and beaten to within an inch of his life, with cudgels,\
    \ by her valet, the one time champion wrestler Dinsmore. What happened to the\
    \ dustbin thereafter is not known.\nAlgernon Spooky's illegitimate daughter Poubelle,\
    \ who acted as his literary executrix, consistently denied the existence of the\
    \ two Gluck, Glinka, and Buxtehude manuscripts. It was only when Pipton bashed\
    \ her repeatedly on the head with an electric toaster that she finally spilled\
    \ the beans."
