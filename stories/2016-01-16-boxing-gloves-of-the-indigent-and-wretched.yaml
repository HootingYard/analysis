  text: 'Having dismissed the idea of running a series examining the gloveboxes of
    the rich and famous, I wondered if instead it might be interesting to run a series
    on the boxing gloves of the indigent and wretched. That''s right, I had finally
    taken leave of my senses, again. What was I thinking? For one thing, I know precious
    little about boxing, or its gloves. Second, I would rather know much less than
    I do about the indigent and wretched, otherwise known as riff-raff. Much, much
    less. If I never came upon another member of the riff-raff I would die a happy
    man. Unfortunately, on the rare occasions when I emerge from my barrel of reclusion
    and venture into the outside world, I can barely move for the teeming throngs
    of riff-raff.

    Incidentally, if you followed the link above, do take the opportunity to buy the
    record. It is very good indeed.

    I am always amused by the fact that the Corbynistas and their like claim to be
    devoted to the needs of the riff-raff. They hate and despise the riff-raff even
    more than I do. It is a mutual loathing, which the Corbynistas explain by saying
    the riff-raff are bedevilled by "false consciousness". Frankly I would be surprised
    if the riff-raff I encounter have any consciousness whatsoever, unless it be a
    malign intention to exasperate me. That is something in which they demonstrate
    an almost enviable skill.

    Clearly, given the above, I am not best placed to write about the boxing gloves
    of the indigent and wretched. Could I, then, turn my attention to the boxing gloves
    of the rich and famous? I suppose I could, but for the full run of a series? That
    seems dubious, to say the least. Once I had dealt with Ernest Hemingway''s many
    and various punch-ups, with a nod to Joan Miro and Arthur Cravan, I would pretty
    much have exhausted my knowledge. Add to which Hemingway''s fist-fights were usually
    boxing gloveless--as when he knocked Wallace Stevens into a puddle (1936)--and
    Arthur Cravan was neither rich nor famous in his time, and the paucity of material
    I have to draw on becomes horribly apparent.

    So, to face brute facts, that is another projected series I shall have to dismiss
    as a hopeless dream. Oh, that gives me an idea! Hopeless Dreams of the Riff-Raff!
    Now there is a topic I could get my teeth into. And, being based on dreams, I
    could just make it all up. No pesky research required. I shall start work on it
    immediately.'
