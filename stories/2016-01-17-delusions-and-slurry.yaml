text: "Just a couple of things to attend to today. First, over at Gruts, Richard Carter\
  \ quotes some amusing snippets about O. Henry and Osbert Lancaster. One wants to\
  \ learn much more about the latter's father-in-law. Were the rest of his \u201C\
  numerous\u201D delusions as delightfully specific as the belief that he \u201Chad\
  \ crossed the Channel with Bl\xE9riot\u201D?\nSecond, it has occurred to me that\
  \ one thing I would really, really like to do is to write a smash hit million-selling\
  \ pop song about a farmyard mishap, entitled 16 Tons Of Slurry."
