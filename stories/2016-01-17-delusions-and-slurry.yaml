  text: 'Just a couple of things to attend to today. First, over at Gruts, Richard
    Carter quotes some amusing snippets about O. Henry and Osbert Lancaster. One wants
    to learn much more about the latter''s father-in-law. Were the rest of his "numerous"
    delusions as delightfully specific as the belief that he "had crossed the Channel
    with Bleriot"?

    Second, it has occurred to me that one thing I would really, really like to do
    is to write a smash hit million-selling pop song about a farmyard mishap, entitled
    16 Tons Of Slurry.'
