  text: 'I went to the shops and bought a foghorn. I thought it would come in handy
    if I were to find myself embroiled in the fog of war. I could toot my foghorn,
    and then ... well, to be honest I hadn''t really thought beyond that. But they
    make foghorns for a purpose, and a benign one, so I felt sure that, in the fog
    of war, my foghorn would prove invaluable. It might even save my life.

    At time of writing, I am, or was, fortunate to live in a peaceable kingdom. King
    Gobbo is a peaceable man, and though he has been provoked by certain of our neighbours,
    over matters such as cow pastures and slurry pits and thermonuclear devices, he
    has thus far managed to maintain the peace, either by capitulating to the aggressor''s
    demands in a fawning manner, or by laying waste to their territories by deploying
    his fiercely loyal army of psychotic blood-drenched nutcases. Within our borders--and
    they are very pretty borders--we remain at peace. That being the case, I have
    not yet needed to toot my foghorn.

    I have not needed to, but I tooted it anyway, to test it out. There was no fog.
    It was a clear day. You could see forever. I tooted my foghorn. It sounded rather
    as I imagine a combination of bassoon and piccolo would sound, playing a single
    protracted note, amplified to deafening volume. The particular make of foghorn
    I had bought worked by a simple mechanism. You depressed a knob to turn it on,
    and depressed the knob again to turn it off. Unfortunately I can be a bit of a
    butterfingers, and when I depressed the knob to turn it on, I somehow managed
    to jam it, so that when I tried to depress it again to turn it off, my efforts
    were in vain. As I said, it was bloody loud, and after trying to depress the knob
    a couple more times, I had to put my hands over my ears.

    I stood there, like a fool, at the junction of Ritually Slaughtered Poultry Street
    and Ringo Starr Boulevard, on a clear day when you could see forever. And of course,
    if I could see forever, then so could everybody else, or most of them. I wondered
    if I could pretend that the foghorn was nothing to do with me, that I just happened
    to be passing by when some unseen miscreant depressed its knob. But I had the
    receipt from the foghorn shop in my pocket, and it would certainly be found when
    King Gobbo''s secret police bundled me into a van and took me to one of their
    damp dank subterranean interrogation chambers.

    I looked wildly around to see if there was a municipal waste bin into which I
    could chuck the receipt. Doing so would involve having to uncover one of my ears
    for the time it took to remove the receipt from my pocket and discard it in the
    bin, and I might well be deaf in that ear forever after, but that seemed my best
    option if I could accomplish it before the arrival of the secret police. But there
    were no bins to be seen, even though it was a clear day and I could see forever.

    Then I remembered King Gobbo''s latest ukase, proclaimed from his balcony just
    the other day. Bins were banned throughout the land. Bins were only necessary
    where there was waste, the King declared, and in his kingdom nothing went to waste.
    We were, he said, a frugal and ingenious people, who would eke everything, everything!,
    until it was beyond further ekeing, and could be eked no more. Or at least, we
    had better shape up and become that frugal and ingenious people, or else.

    With my hands over my ears, and thinking about that "else", and the secret police,
    and the damp dank subterranean interrogation chambers, I decided to make a run
    for it. I ran and ran, until the din of the foghorn was slighly less deafening,
    I ran and ran until I reached the border. It was a very pretty border. I handed
    myself over to the enemy border guards, and begged for mercy. I would think twice
    before buying another foghorn.'
