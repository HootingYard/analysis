  text: "\nIt has become something of a clich\xE9 for people to say they are frightened\
    \ of clowns. Far more terrifying, to my mind, are putti. You know where you are\
    \ with a clown\u2014in the Big Top, where he galumphs across the sawdust with\
    \ a bucket and a hooter. But those damnable putti!\nLet's be honest, if you were\
    \ out and about, sashaying along the street, taking the air, and you saw, swooping\
    \ through that air and coming to rest, hovering just above your head, a chubby\
    \ baby with a full head of curly hair, and wings, and possibly armed with a bow\
    \ and arrow, I think you would shriek in terror and run screaming for the hills.\
    \ This would be a mistake. The wiser thing to do, in the circumstances, would\
    \ be to run screaming for shelter, inside an enclosed building, where you could\
    \ barricade yourself in. Putti can fly, but they cannot fly through brick walls.\n\
    If you run for the hills, the putti will follow you, calling out to their putti\
    \ pals to join them. And that call! These are babies, remember, so their call\
    \ is a godawful infant squeal, accompanied by gurgling. By the time you get to\
    \ the hills, bedraggled and panting, there might be dozens or hundreds of putti\
    \ hovering around you, like drones. If, in your terror, you piddle in your pants,\
    \ as you are likely to do, the putti will giggle, in that horrible babyish way\
    \ that is more like hiccups. Do you really want to find yourself alone in the\
    \ hills beset by a swarm of hiccuping flying babies, some of whom have bows and\
    \ arrows?\nThe wards of our lunatic asylums are crammed with poor souls who made\
    \ the mistake of trying to flee from putti in the open air. The other mistake\
    \ people sometimes make is to think they can turn the tables on the armed putti\
    \ by shooting arrows at them so they drop, fatally wounded, from the sky. This\
    \ doesn't work. You cannot kill a putto. Unlike Ploppo the Clown, they are immortal.\n\
    Thankfully, since Renaissance times, we have seen rather less of the putti than\
    \ we used to. Scientists are not sure what has caused the drop in numbers. It\
    \ could be something to do with smog. But they are still out there, cherubic and\
    \ terrifying and swooping through the air\u2014flying babies!\u2014and you would\
    \ do well to be on your guard."
