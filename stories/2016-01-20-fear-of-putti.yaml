    It has become something of a cliche for people to say they are frightened of clowns.
    Far more terrifying, to my mind, are putti. You know where you are with a clown--in
    the Big Top, where he galumphs across the sawdust with a bucket and a hooter.
    But those damnable putti!

    Let''s be honest, if you were out and about, sashaying along the street, taking
    the air, and you saw, swooping through that air and coming to rest, hovering just
    above your head, a chubby baby with a full head of curly hair, and wings, and
    possibly armed with a bow and arrow, I think you would shriek in terror and run
    screaming for the hills. This would be a mistake. The wiser thing to do, in the
    circumstances, would be to run screaming for shelter, inside an enclosed building,
    where you could barricade yourself in. Putti can fly, but they cannot fly through
    brick walls.

    If you run for the hills, the putti will follow you, calling out to their putti
    pals to join them. And that call! These are babies, remember, so their call is
    a godawful infant squeal, accompanied by gurgling. By the time you get to the
    hills, bedraggled and panting, there might be dozens or hundreds of putti hovering
    around you, like drones. If, in your terror, you piddle in your pants, as you
    are likely to do, the putti will giggle, in that horrible babyish way that is
    more like hiccups. Do you really want to find yourself alone in the hills beset
    by a swarm of hiccuping flying babies, some of whom have bows and arrows?

    The wards of our lunatic asylums are crammed with poor souls who made the mistake
    of trying to flee from putti in the open air. The other mistake people sometimes
    make is to think they can turn the tables on the armed putti by shooting arrows
    at them so they drop, fatally wounded, from the sky. This doesn''t work. You cannot
    kill a putto. Unlike Ploppo the Clown, they are immortal.

    Thankfully, since Renaissance times, we have seen rather less of the putti than
    we used to. Scientists are not sure what has caused the drop in numbers. It could
    be something to do with smog. But they are still out there, cherubic and terrifying
    and swooping through the air--flying babies!--and you would do well to be on your
    guard.'
