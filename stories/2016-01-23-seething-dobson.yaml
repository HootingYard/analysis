  text: "Dobson was seething. The twentieth century's great out of print pamphleteer\
    \ was sitting at his breakfast table absolutely seething. Pausing before spooning\
    \ a dollop of marmalade-style pipless jellied-eel goo into her mouth, Dobson's\
    \ inamorata Marigold Chew observed \u201CYou appear to be seething, Dobson\u201D\
    .\n\u201CIndeed I am, oh light of my life,\u201D said the pamphleteer, \u201C\
    I have a lengthy list of exasperations which I would happily recite to you, the\
    \ better that you may understand the multifarious sources of my seething.\u201D\
    \n\u201CPerhaps not, Dobson,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CInstead, I would\
    \ rather that you seethe elsewhere than at the breakfast table. Have you considered\
    \ going to Seething to seethe?\u201D\n\u201CI have not,\u201D said Dobson, \u201C\
    And where in the name of high heaven is Seething?\u201D\n\u201CSeething is a tiny\
    \ village in the county of Norfolk,\u201D said Marigold Chew, \u201CAbout nine\
    \ miles south-east of Norwich. Its church, St Margaret's, has a round tower, though\
    \ that is not strictly relevant. I am told that the villagers of Seething often\
    \ seethe, about all sorts of exasperations, and I feel sure you would find a welcome\
    \ there.\u201D\n\u201CThen seethe in Seething I shall!\u201D shouted Dobson, and\
    \ he rose from the table, pulled on his Ivory Coast crop-dusting co-pilot's boots,\
    \ and crashed out of the door into the teeming downpour. So heavy was the rain,\
    \ so thick the mist, so broken his pocket compass, that the pamphleteer became\
    \ almost immediately lost. When, eventually, he came to a halt, he was not in\
    \ Seething at all. Dobson had wandered as far as the county of Cornwall, and found\
    \ himself in the tiny village of Splat.\nDobson was splatting.\n"
