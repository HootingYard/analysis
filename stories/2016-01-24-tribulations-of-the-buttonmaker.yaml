  text: "Tribulations Of The Buttonmaker is an opera by the French-Aboriginal Australian\
    \ composer Di G\xE9ridu. It has not been performed since the early 19th century,\
    \ possibly because of its vast cast, loopy libretto, and/or musical pomposity.\n\
    In Act One, Fulgencio the buttonmaker is beset by tribulations. He is attacked\
    \ by an angry spider. His hat is blown off in a high wind. He chokes on a gobstopper.\
    \ One of his buttons falls down a drain. He is excommunicated by the Pope. Brutes\
    \ break both his arms. The weft of his tunic is in disarray. His villa is infested\
    \ by peewits. He contracts a dangerous ague. Mice nibble his bootlaces. Another\
    \ of his buttons falls down a different drain. His bowl of plums is poisoned.\
    \ Malign sprites with pitchforks torment him in his sleep. The rent on his palazzo\
    \ is increased. He is hoist by his own petard. Then he is hoist by several other\
    \ people's petards. He is followed everywhere he goes by a rancorous chicken.\
    \ He develops an allergy to spinach. He accidentally drops another button down\
    \ another drain. The earth trembles. The stars are blotted out. The sky falls\
    \ down\nAct One closes with Fulgencio singing the monotonous dirge \u201CO! Woe\
    \ unto me for I have been attacked by an angry spider and my hat was blown off\
    \ in a high wind and I choked on a gobstopper and one of my buttons fell down\
    \ a drain and I was excommunicated by the Pope and brutes broke both my arms and\
    \ the weft of my tunic was in disarray and my villa was infested by peewits and\
    \ I contracted a dangerous ague and mice nibbled my bootlaces and another of my\
    \ buttons fell down a different drain and my bowl of plums was poisoned and malign\
    \ sprites with pitchforks tormented me in my sleep and the rent on my palazzo\
    \ was increased and I was hoist by my own petard and then I was hoist by several\
    \ other people's petards and I was followed everywhere I went by a rancorous chicken\
    \ and I developed an allergy to spinach and I accidentally dropped another button\
    \ down another drain and the earth trembled and the stars were blotted out and\
    \ the sky fell down and I'm feeling so lonesome I could die\u201D.\nIn Acts Two,\
    \ Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen and\
    \ Fourteen Fulgencio the buttonmaker suffers further tribulations, until, as the\
    \ curtain falls, the stage is littered with corpses and the angry spider scuttles\
    \ off, stage right."
