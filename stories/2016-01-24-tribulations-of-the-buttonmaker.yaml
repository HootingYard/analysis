  text: 'Tribulations Of The Buttonmaker is an opera by the French-Aboriginal Australian
    composer Di Geridu. It has not been performed since the early 19th century, possibly
    because of its vast cast, loopy libretto, and/or musical pomposity.

    In Act One, Fulgencio the buttonmaker is beset by tribulations. He is attacked
    by an angry spider. His hat is blown off in a high wind. He chokes on a gobstopper.
    One of his buttons falls down a drain. He is excommunicated by the Pope. Brutes
    break both his arms. The weft of his tunic is in disarray. His villa is infested
    by peewits. He contracts a dangerous ague. Mice nibble his bootlaces. Another
    of his buttons falls down a different drain. His bowl of plums is poisoned. Malign
    sprites with pitchforks torment him in his sleep. The rent on his palazzo is increased.
    He is hoist by his own petard. Then he is hoist by several other people''s petards.
    He is followed everywhere he goes by a rancorous chicken. He develops an allergy
    to spinach. He accidentally drops another button down another drain. The earth
    trembles. The stars are blotted out. The sky falls down

    Act One closes with Fulgencio singing the monotonous dirge "O! Woe unto me for
    I have been attacked by an angry spider and my hat was blown off in a high wind
    and I choked on a gobstopper and one of my buttons fell down a drain and I was
    excommunicated by the Pope and brutes broke both my arms and the weft of my tunic
    was in disarray and my villa was infested by peewits and I contracted a dangerous
    ague and mice nibbled my bootlaces and another of my buttons fell down a different
    drain and my bowl of plums was poisoned and malign sprites with pitchforks tormented
    me in my sleep and the rent on my palazzo was increased and I was hoist by my
    own petard and then I was hoist by several other people''s petards and I was followed
    everywhere I went by a rancorous chicken and I developed an allergy to spinach
    and I accidentally dropped another button down another drain and the earth trembled
    and the stars were blotted out and the sky fell down and I''m feeling so lonesome
    I could die".

    In Acts Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve,
    Thirteen and Fourteen Fulgencio the buttonmaker suffers further tribulations,
    until, as the curtain falls, the stage is littered with corpses and the angry
    spider scuttles off, stage right.'
