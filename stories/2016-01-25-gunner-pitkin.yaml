  text: "Gunner Pitkin found himself stranded behind enemy lines.\n  He hid in a barn.\n\
    \  There was a cow in the barn.\n  It was an enemy cow.\n  Back in the field tent,\
    \ Gunner Pitkin had had dinned into his head, by the captain, where his duty lay.\n\
    \  It was an enemy cow, so he had to kill it.\n  Gunner Pitkin was not the brightest\
    \ of men, but he realised that if he used his gun to shoot the cow, the noise\
    \ of the report could alert the enemy to his presence in the barn.\n  Back in\
    \ the field tent, Gunner Pitkin had had dinned into his head, by the captain,\
    \ that part of his duty was to avoid capture at all costs.\n  Gunner Pitkin looked\
    \ wildly around the barn, seeking an instrument by which he might bring about\
    \ the death of the enemy cow, but silently.\n  He saw a churn and a hoe and a\
    \ spade.\n  Gunner Pitkin put down his gun and picked up the spade.\n  He approached\
    \ the cow.\n  Gunner Pitkin hoisted the spade high, ready to bring it bashing\
    \ down repeatedly and relentlessly upon the cow's head.\n  Then it occurred to\
    \ him that there lives the dearest freshness deep down things, even cows, even\
    \ enemy cows.\n  He put the spade down.\n  Gunner Pitkin lay upon a bale of straw\
    \ and fell asleep.\n  Several hours later he was captured by the enemy.\n  In\
    \ the prisoner of war camp, Gunner Pitkin occupied his time making toy cows out\
    \ of balsa wood and dough.\n  By the time the peace was signed on Luneburg Heath,\
    \ he had made hundreds of toy cows.\n  They can now be found in a museum, a converted\
    \ barn in a daffodil-splattered field that used to be behind enemy lines."
