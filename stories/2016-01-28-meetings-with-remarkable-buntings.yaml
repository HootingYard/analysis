  text: 'I was commissioned to write a fat book entitled Meetings With Remarkable
    Buntings. Biro poised, I was about to set to work when it occurred to me that
    I did not know whether I was meant to be writing about birds or those decorative
    strings of triangular flags festooned at festive occasions such as gala days.
    I rang the publishers to find out.

    The person I spoke to sounded about twelve years old and was brimming with confidence,
    in spite of being clueless. As soon as I uttered the word "bird" she started to
    babble excitedly about something called Twitter. I slammed the phone down. I was
    able to do this because I was using a proper telephone, one with a receiver resting
    on a cradle. With these new-fangled mobile horrors, one cannot slam them down
    in a satisfying spat of ill temper without risking breakage.

    I decided my best bet was to write about both types of bunting and, with the twittery
    inanities of the publisher sloshing in my ears, took up my biro to write about
    the bird. But then I paused. The title of the book spoke of Meetings With buntings.
    I would have to go and find a bunting and commune with it. Now, my ornithological
    ignorance is staggering, and frankly I wouldn''t know a bunting from a nuthatch
    or a pipit or a starling or a wagtail. So I rang the Emergency Bird Information
    Hotline.

    The person who answered the phone sounded about twelve years old and was brimming
    with avian confidence. I told her I wanted to know all there was to know about
    buntings.

    "Do you mean the bird or the decorative strings of triangular flags festooned
    at festive occasions such as gala days?" she asked.

    "Well, you''re the Emergency Bird Information Hotline," I said, "So I mean the
    bird, obviously."

    "It might seem obvious to you," she said, "But you would be surprised how many
    enquiries we receive about the decorative strings of triangular flags. We are
    a very festive organisation, forever holding fetes and galas, and so we have bunting
    hanging permanently outside our headquarters. I think that is why people call
    us when they want to know about non-bird bunting as well as bunting the bird."

    "Well I want to know about the bird," I said, but she was prattling on regardless.

    "Actually we are having a little garden party this afternoon in celebration of
    the common chaffinch. Would you like to come? You''ll be able to see our display
    of bunting--the decorative strings of triangular flags, that is, rather than the
    birds. But there will be a couple of stuffed chaffinches for you to look at if
    you want to know more about them."

    "I want to know about the bunting, not the chaffinch!" I shouted, and slammed
    down the phone, again.

    In my rather satisfying spat of ill temper, I went for a walk by the pond and
    chucked pebbles at swans. Then it occurred to me that I ought to attend the garden
    party so I could commune with the non-bird bunting. Then at least I would have
    something to write about. I pranced home and rang the Emergency Bird Information
    Hotline again. A robotic voice informed me that the line had been disconnected.
    I repaired to my escritoire and picked up my biro.

    Over the course of my life I have met many remarkable buntings, I wrote, lying
    shamelessly, but who would know?, None more so, perhaps, than Bunting, the Swedish
    halfbreed skimmel horse which became a film star. Bunting played Pippi Longstocking''s
    horse Lilla Gubben in a series of films directed by Olle Hellbom.

    Of course I had never actually met Bunting, and my knowledge of horses is as patchy
    as my knowledge of birds, but I felt I was getting to grips with my material.
    Birds and those decorative strings of triangular flags festooned at festive occasions
    such as gala days and Emergency Bird Information Hotline garden parties in celebration
    of the common chaffinch could take a back seat for the time being. By the time
    I''d finished with Bunting the film star horse, we would be firm friends and boon
    companions, at least within my head.

    I made a mental note to ring the publisher and suggest we amend the title of my
    book to Meetings With Remarkable Buntings Inside My Head. Then I carried on writing,
    daddy-o, like a man possessed of unfathomable horse-based inventive genius.'
