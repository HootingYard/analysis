  text: 'Today is the Day of Grunting, when all around the world, from Aargau to Zug,
    people join together as one in celebration of that terrifying figure of children''s
    most awful nightmares, the Grunty Man.

    When you have stopped trembling, you may wish to consult this collection of pieces
    in which mention is made of our dear grunting pal. Think of him, lurking in his
    filthy cave, grunting and grunting and grunting until the cows come home*.

    * NOTA BENE : I have been asked to point out that no cows actually live in the
    Grunty Man''s cave, so they are never going to "come home" to it. This suggests
    that the grunting of the Grunty Man will continue for all eternity, just as it
    has been going on since long, long before the dawn of time.'
