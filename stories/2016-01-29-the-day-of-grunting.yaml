text: "Today is the Day of Grunting, when all around the world, from Aargau to Zug,\
  \ people join together as one in celebration of that terrifying figure of children's\
  \ most awful nightmares, the Grunty Man.\nWhen you have stopped trembling, you may\
  \ wish to consult this collection of pieces in which mention is made of our dear\
  \ grunting pal. Think of him, lurking in his filthy cave, grunting and grunting\
  \ and grunting until the cows come home*.\n* NOTA BENE\_: I have been asked to point\
  \ out that no cows actually live in the Grunty Man's cave, so they are never going\
  \ to \u201Ccome home\u201D to it. This suggests that the grunting of the Grunty\
  \ Man will continue for all eternity, just as it has been going on since long, long\
  \ before the dawn of time."
