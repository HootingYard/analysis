  text: 'Plan B for 2016 is to post a potsage [sic] here every day, except on those
    days when Mr Key is beset by uurrgghh. So far the plan is succeeding beyond all
    expectations.

    Meanwhile, when not whimpering softly, I have tried to cheer myself up by watching
    Die Hard : The Director''s Cat, two hours of footage of John McTiernan''s pet
    moggy, Tiddles, graceful yet unfathomably stupid, prowling around the upper floors
    of the Nakatomi Building, lapping milk from a saucer, fixing its gaze on things
    invisible to the human eye, and taking long naps. Yippee-ky-oh, motherfucker!'
