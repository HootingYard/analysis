  text: 'Soup-in-the-beard was a condition which affected many Victorian gentlemen
    possessed of disgusting table manners. It commonly took the form of patches of
    beard hair becoming soaked in spilled soup, which then dried out, causing the
    hairs to become matted and malodorous. The spillage would usually occur at the
    point where the Victorian gentleman, wielding a spoonful of soup and aiming to
    transfer the full amount into his mouth, would fall at the last hurdle, and send
    some or all of the spoonful dribbling down his beard. If the bowl of soup was
    a generous one, as it often was at Victorian banquets, repetitions of this manoeuvre
    could result in the beard being absolutely drenched, with droplets of the spilled
    soup dripping on to the elegantly embroidered tablecloth.

    Although we do not have precise figures, it is believed that a significant proportion
    of cases of soup-in-the-beard were caused by uncontrollable tremors of the hand,
    symptoms of withdrawal from the gargantuan doses of opium favoured by almost all
    Victorian gentlemen. This does not, of course, excuse their disgusting table manners,
    which were disgusting, almost as disgusting as--at another time, in another place--those
    of Franz Kafka.

    Contemporary written accounts of soup-in-the-beard are surprisingly few, possibly
    because it was so prevalent, so much a commonplace, that chroniclers of the time
    did not consider it worthy of remark. A vivid exception is contained in a letter
    written by the Dowager Duchess Dipsy of Poxhaven, dated 14 January 1868:

    Last night I attended a dinner to raise funds for the Society for the Promotion
    of Sending Working Class Orphans Down Mineshafts, held at Soot-Blackened House.
    I was seated next to Walter Mad, whose beard is prodigious. The poor man''s hands
    were shaking badly, and he confessed to me that he had not had a dose of opium
    for a full half hour. During the soup course--mulligatawny, to my horror--Walter
    Mad had a great deal of difficulty transferring the soup from bowl to mouth by
    means of a spoon, and after a minute or two his beard was sopping wet, almost
    more soup than hair. I was amused to note that he summoned his valet, who proceeded
    to wring out the beard, much like a janitor with a mop. Cleverly, Walter Mad commanded
    him to do this directly over the bowl, so that the soup in the beard replenished
    the soup in the bowl. By this means, and by several further wringings-out, Walter
    Mad was still busy with his soup while the rest of us had moved on to the jugged
    hare and the strangled weasel. His table manners are disgusting, but he gave ten
    shillings to send urchins from the lower orders down the mines, so his cold black
    heart is in the right place.
