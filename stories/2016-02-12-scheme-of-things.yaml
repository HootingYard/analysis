  text: "Once upon a time there was a little Italian boy made out of wood. He wore\
    \ a pointy hat, also wooden. In this age of grand illusion, he walked into my\
    \ life out of my dreams, and forced his way into my scheme of things. This was\
    \ somewhat unnerving, for it is not an everyday occurrence to find oneself in\
    \ thrall to a wooden boy. But enthralled I was, to the point where the tables\
    \ were turned and I tried to fit in with his scheme of things.\nIn order to do\
    \ so, I felt I needed to gain a better understanding of what it was like to be\
    \ made of wood. So I drove to the forest in a Japanese car. I parked at the edge,\
    \ by a pond, and then I walked deep into the forest and stood there, pretending\
    \ to be a tree, a pine or an elm. At first I was fidgety, but as the hours passed\
    \ I found it easier to stand perfectly still, as if I were wooden. I swayed slightly\
    \ in the breeze.\nThe little Italian boy made of wood had not followed me to the\
    \ forest, for he could not drive. I wondered what he was up to, back in my chalet,\
    \ perched on the edge of a glacier. It was a wooden chalet, so it suited him well,\
    \ better, in fact, than it suited me. I felt so at home in the forest. Oh I so\
    \ wanted to sprout leaves and buds!\nSeveral months passed before I was forced\
    \ to admit that I could not fit in to his scheme of things and that I was not,\
    \ nor ever would be. made out of wood. I trudged back through the forest towards\
    \ the pond where I had parked the Japanese car. It had been stolen. I sat on a\
    \ tuffet next to the pond and I pondered. Pondering by a pond, not made of wood.\
    \ The sky was immense and immensely blue.\nIt was a small mercy that I did not\
    \ know the little wooden Italian boy was a delinquent rascal, and had burned down\
    \ my chalet the instant I screeched away in my Japanese car. And yet the world\
    \ keeps turning. That, after all, is in the scheme of things, whether one is wooden\
    \ or\u2014let us be plain\u2014not wooden, not wooden at all, neither pine nor\
    \ elm nor any of the other types of wood. They all burn."
