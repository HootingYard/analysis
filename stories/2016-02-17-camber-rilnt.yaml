  text: 'Who now remembers Camber Rilnt?

    In the long ago, when I was a teenperson, Camber Rilnt was, if not quite my hero,
    certainly a totemic figure, one I held in awe. I pored over his name with something
    akin to reverence. Today, on a whim, I tapped "Camber Rilnt" into Google, and
    it yielded absolutely no results whatsoever. There are millions, probably billions
    of pages on the world wide interweb, but if Google is to be believed, Camber Rilnt
    appears on none of them. He has vanished down the plughole of history.

    Ah! But I did find him, not once but twice, hiding in plain sight, in a manner
    not traceable by Google''s algorithms, but present nevertheless. Camber Rilnt
    lives on!

    As for you lot, devoted Hooting Yardists all, do you remember Camber Rilnt? Can
    you track him down on the web, perhaps in places I missed? Feel free to plunge
    into the Comments Bath to let me know.'
