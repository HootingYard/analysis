    Sad news. The Dabbler has been mothballed for an indefinite period--as explained
    here. I have been contributing to it pretty much every week for five and a half
    years. Those of you with more leisure time than sense may wish to consult the
    full archive of Key''s Cupboard. It merely remains for me to thank the redoubtable
    Brit and the other Dabblers for their support over half a decade. And do not forget
    that Dabbler Editions published the comprehensive e-anthology By Aerostat To Hooting
    Yard, edited and introduced by Roland Clare. If you do not yet have a copy, go
    and buy one immediately, or you will be set upon in awful nightmares by the Grunty
    Man.'
