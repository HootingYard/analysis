  text: 'John Hargrave, founder of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, wrote an article
    in 1925 entitled "A Short Exposition of the Philosophical Basis of the Kibbo Kift".
    It includes a passage where Hargrave insists on the "unity of the unique units
    of the Universe":

    teapots, chairs, mud, electric light bulbs, fingernails, hammers, steam engines,
    mountains, hats, shoes, needles, tram tickets, lilies, telephones, tents, dynamos,
    walking sticks, cow dung, churches, iron foundries, neckties, cats, human beings,
    steel plates, bricks and mortar, glass, sealing-wax, trees, thoughts, tables,
    music, flowers and flower-pots, clouds, gutter-gratings, books, food, buttons,
    machine guns, beads, rain, clocks, boots, ferro-concrete, eggs, sunlight, coal,
    stars, solar systems, slugs, pictures, maggots, wheel bolts, smells, darkness
    and light, collar-studs, speech, seeds, birds, bootlaces, insects, skeletons,
    pepper-corns, babies, Space, Time, Matter, all religions, all Spirits, all Matter(s)
    ... all, all, are actually the ONE GREAT POWER.

    This is quoted in Annebella Pollen''s book The Kindred Of The Kibbo Kift, which
    you will recall I recommended during the run of the 2015 Hooting Yard Advent Calendar.
    If you need any further persuasion to obtain a copy, please note that it has recently
    been acclaimed as "the most beautiful book in Switzerland".'
