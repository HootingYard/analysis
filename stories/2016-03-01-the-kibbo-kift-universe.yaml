  text: "John Hargrave, founder of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, wrote an article\
    \ in 1925 entitled \u201CA Short Exposition of the Philosophical Basis of the\
    \ Kibbo Kift\u201D. It includes a passage where Hargrave insists on the \u201C\
    unity of the unique units of the Universe\u201D:\nteapots, chairs, mud, electric\
    \ light bulbs, fingernails, hammers, steam engines, mountains, hats, shoes, needles,\
    \ tram tickets, lilies, telephones, tents, dynamos, walking sticks, cow dung,\
    \ churches, iron foundries, neckties, cats, human beings, steel plates, bricks\
    \ and mortar, glass, sealing-wax, trees, thoughts, tables, music, flowers and\
    \ flower-pots, clouds, gutter-gratings, books, food, buttons, machine guns, beads,\
    \ rain, clocks, boots, ferro-concrete, eggs, sunlight, coal, stars, solar systems,\
    \ slugs, pictures, maggots, wheel bolts, smells, darkness and light, collar-studs,\
    \ speech, seeds, birds, bootlaces, insects, skeletons, pepper-corns, babies, Space,\
    \ Time, Matter, all religions, all Spirits, all Matter(s) \u2026 all, all, are\
    \ actually the ONE GREAT POWER.\nThis is quoted in Annebella Pollen's book The\
    \ Kindred Of The Kibbo Kift, which you will recall I recommended during the run\
    \ of the 2015 Hooting Yard Advent Calendar. If you need any further persuasion\
    \ to obtain a copy, please note that it has recently been acclaimed as \u201C\
    the most beautiful book in Switzerland\u201D."
