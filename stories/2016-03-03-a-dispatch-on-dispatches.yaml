  text: Following the mothballing of The Dabbler, my sister Rita has launched a new
    home for her Dispatches From The Former New World. Make sure you keep a close
    eye on it. Bear in mind that Mr Key would not be the scribbler you know and adore
    were it not for the influence, from a very early age, of this woman--last spotted
    here wearing a mortar board outside Brighton Pavilion.
