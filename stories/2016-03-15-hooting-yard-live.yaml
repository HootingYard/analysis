  text: An exciting new podcast is now available for your listening pleasure. Hooting
    Yard Live At Brewer's Bar (Part One) documents the occasion, last week, when Mr
    Key spouted sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose at a live audience in a small
    watering-hole in Shacklewell Lane. A plaque may appear on the building some centuries
    hence. Part Two will follow shortly.
