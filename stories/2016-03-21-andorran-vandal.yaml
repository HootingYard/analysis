  text: 'There was a happy conjunction of words in the Guardian crossword the other
    day. When solved, the leftmost column on the grid read ANDORRAN VANDAL. Remarkably,
    these were precisely the words which appeared, in the form of punched-out holes,
    on the small piece of dun cardboard spat out by the Hooting Yard Analogue Topic
    Generating Machine, a piece of gubbins I had knocked up for me by a boffin.

    Most writers will tell you that the question they are most often asked is "where
    do you get your ideas from?"Most writers will also tell you that it is a brain-numbingly
    stupid question to which there is no pat answer. But I have no difficulty answering
    it. For many years now, I have not had to summon a single idea in my head. Instead,
    what happens is that a variety of arcane and abstruse data is fed into the Hooting
    Yard Analogue Topic Generating Machine and, after humming and buzzing for a while,
    it spits out a small piece of dun cardboard on which is punched out a word or,
    more often, a few words, thus providing me with my topic and freeing me from the
    tedium of having to think of anything myself.

    So remarkable was the coincidence of my given topic being replicated, exactly,
    in the Guardian crossword, that I fell out of my chair. How often does that actually
    happen in real life? But I did, I toppled from my chair and lay sprawled on the
    carpet, dribbling. After some minutes, I realised that this was a far more comfortable
    position than sitting in the chair, so I stayed put. The only drawback was that
    my pencil and paper were up on the desk, and I could not reach them. Still, it
    was very restful on the floor, so I dozed off. That is why nothing appeared here,
    on that day, about the ANDORRAN VANDAL, nor indeed has anything appeared here
    for several days in a row. I have become regrettably enamoured of lying on the
    floor, dribbling and dozing.

    Had I the pep to tell you about the ANDORRAN VANDAL, you would learn that this
    was a sobriquet once given to Babinsky 2, the idiot half-brother of the lumbering
    walrus-moustached serial killer Babinsky. Babinsky 2 earned the name during a
    period in which he went rampaging around Andorra smashing up telephone kiosks
    and daubing ruderies upon road signs. He dressed in full Andorran national costume
    while so engaged, and was thus mistaken for a native of that mountainous land.

    Further details can be found in a footnote on page 841 of A Thick, Chunky History
    of Vandalism in Andorra, From 1554 Up To Last Thursday (Spurious Tomes, 2016).'
