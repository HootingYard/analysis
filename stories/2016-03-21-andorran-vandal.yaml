  text: "There was a happy conjunction of words in the Guardian crossword the other\
    \ day. When solved, the leftmost column on the grid read ANDORRAN VANDAL. Remarkably,\
    \ these were precisely the words which appeared, in the form of punched-out holes,\
    \ on the small piece of dun cardboard spat out by the Hooting Yard Analogue Topic\
    \ Generating Machine, a piece of gubbins I had knocked up for me by a boffin.\n\
    Most writers will tell you that the question they are most often asked is \u201C\
    where do you get your ideas from?\u201DMost writers will also tell you that it\
    \ is a brain-numbingly stupid question to which there is no pat answer. But I\
    \ have no difficulty answering it. For many years now, I have not had to summon\
    \ a single idea in my head. Instead, what happens is that a variety of arcane\
    \ and abstruse data is fed into the Hooting Yard Analogue Topic Generating Machine\
    \ and, after humming and buzzing for a while, it spits out a small piece of dun\
    \ cardboard on which is punched out a word or, more often, a few words, thus providing\
    \ me with my topic and freeing me from the tedium of having to think of anything\
    \ myself.\nSo remarkable was the coincidence of my given topic being replicated,\
    \ exactly, in the Guardian crossword, that I fell out of my chair. How often does\
    \ that actually happen in real life? But I did, I toppled from my chair and lay\
    \ sprawled on the carpet, dribbling. After some minutes, I realised that this\
    \ was a far more comfortable position than sitting in the chair, so I stayed put.\
    \ The only drawback was that my pencil and paper were up on the desk, and I could\
    \ not reach them. Still, it was very restful on the floor, so I dozed off. That\
    \ is why nothing appeared here, on that day, about the ANDORRAN VANDAL, nor indeed\
    \ has anything appeared here for several days in a row. I have become regrettably\
    \ enamoured of lying on the floor, dribbling and dozing.\nHad I the pep to tell\
    \ you about the ANDORRAN VANDAL, you would learn that this was a sobriquet once\
    \ given to Babinsky 2, the idiot half-brother of the lumbering walrus-moustached\
    \ serial killer Babinsky. Babinsky 2 earned the name during a period in which\
    \ he went rampaging around Andorra smashing up telephone kiosks and daubing ruderies\
    \ upon road signs. He dressed in full Andorran national costume while so engaged,\
    \ and was thus mistaken for a native of that mountainous land.\nFurther details\
    \ can be found in a footnote on page 841 of A Thick, Chunky History of Vandalism\
    \ in Andorra, From 1554 Up To Last Thursday (Spurious Tomes, 2016)."
