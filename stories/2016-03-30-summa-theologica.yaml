  text: "Things have been quiet here for a while. That is because I have been concentrating\
    \ on completing my masterwork, the Summa Theologica. As its title indicates, this\
    \ is a theological summary which attempts to explain the ways of God to Man\u2014\
    or at least to my readership. It has involved untold research, over many years,\
    \ the collection of thousands, if not millions, of notes, all written painstakingly\
    \ in pencil on Nabokovian index cards. Now at last I have set about the task of\
    \ marshalling all this into a coherent narrative that is at once jaw-droppingly\
    \ erudite and also as readable as any airport bookstall blockbuster.\nThe opening\
    \ sentence is, in a sense, the summa theologica of the Summa Theologica. Having\
    \ consulted my notes, I wrote:\nIt is blindingly obvious, to even the most dim-witted\
    \ and wet-behind-the-ears six-year-old, that there is only one god, all-powerful\
    \ and all-knowing, and that is the hideous bat-god Fatso.\nUnfortunately, after\
    \ writing this, I reached an impasse. It is, indeed, blindingly obvious, so what\
    \ else is there to say? The simple truth is that we must all bow down or, better,\
    \ prostrate ourselves upon our bellies, like the creatures that creep upon the\
    \ earth, before the terrible countenance of the hideous bat-god Fatso, for ever\
    \ and ever Amen. If you do not grasp that fact, then you are doomed, yea unto\
    \ the umpteenth generation, and you will eat nought but nettles and drink nothing\
    \ but evaporated milk flavoured with the bitter tears of grumpy German film directors,\
    \ and you will be dressed in rags, and the rags will be besmirched with the blood\
    \ of slaughtered innocents, and your limbs will flail helplessly, and your brain\
    \ will boil.\nIf you require further evidence of the unflinchingly brutal reality\
    \ of the hideous bat-god Fatso, see here."
