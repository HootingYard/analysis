  text: 'Things have been quiet here for a while. That is because I have been concentrating
    on completing my masterwork, the Summa Theologica. As its title indicates, this
    is a theological summary which attempts to explain the ways of God to Man--or
    at least to my readership. It has involved untold research, over many years, the
    collection of thousands, if not millions, of notes, all written painstakingly
    in pencil on Nabokovian index cards. Now at last I have set about the task of
    marshalling all this into a coherent narrative that is at once jaw-droppingly
    erudite and also as readable as any airport bookstall blockbuster.

    The opening sentence is, in a sense, the summa theologica of the Summa Theologica.
    Having consulted my notes, I wrote:

    It is blindingly obvious, to even the most dim-witted and wet-behind-the-ears
    six-year-old, that there is only one god, all-powerful and all-knowing, and that
    is the hideous bat-god Fatso.

    Unfortunately, after writing this, I reached an impasse. It is, indeed, blindingly
    obvious, so what else is there to say? The simple truth is that we must all bow
    down or, better, prostrate ourselves upon our bellies, like the creatures that
    creep upon the earth, before the terrible countenance of the hideous bat-god Fatso,
    for ever and ever Amen. If you do not grasp that fact, then you are doomed, yea
    unto the umpteenth generation, and you will eat nought but nettles and drink nothing
    but evaporated milk flavoured with the bitter tears of grumpy German film directors,
    and you will be dressed in rags, and the rags will be besmirched with the blood
    of slaughtered innocents, and your limbs will flail helplessly, and your brain
    will boil.

    If you require further evidence of the unflinchingly brutal reality of the hideous
    bat-god Fatso, see here.'
