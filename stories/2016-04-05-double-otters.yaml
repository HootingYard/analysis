text: "If you are in the vicinity of a riverbank, and you see two otters, this is\
  \ known as Double Otters. Mark your little dun cardboard slip accordingly, in pencil,\
  \ and take it to the kiosk. The man at the kiosk\u2014argumentative, boisterous,\
  \ catarrh-riddled, dismal, eggy (as in the Beatles\u2019 song), flip, gaunt, horrible,\
  \ ill, jaded, knock-knee'd, lascivious, mordant\u2014will exchange your slip for\
  \ a prize, usually a biro or a balloon.\nHe is a fallen man. When you are not looking,\
  \ he will blub into a napkin."
