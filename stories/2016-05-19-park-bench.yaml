  text: 'This confounded Hooting Yard hiatus has gone on long enough. My apologies
    for the silence. I am hoping to give my brain a good kicking to get it back on
    track.

    Regular readers will know that the municipal park bench is a recurring motif in
    my prose. Imagine my unalloyed glee, then, to discover the existence of an actor
    and director named Park Bench. One of his films is called The Secret of Goat.
    These things make me extremely happy.'
