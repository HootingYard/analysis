  text: 'And the Lord said "Gather ye wool, and using needles thou shalt knit the
    wool into the form of a chicken. And thou shalt stuff the chicken with kapok and
    place it upon thy mantel. But the chicken shall lay no eggs, nor shall it cluck,
    for it is a false chicken, of kapok and wool, and an abomination unto the eyes
    of the Lord. And it shall be cast down from thy mantel, and unravelled, and the
    kapok stuffing scattered, yea, upon the four winds, and the wool strewn across
    many fields on thy father''s land. Thus sayeth the Lord, regarding false chickens,
    and other counterfeit poultry."
