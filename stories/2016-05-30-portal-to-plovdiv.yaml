  text: "It is far too long since we turned our attention to the fair city of Plovdiv.\
    \ Word reaches me, however, of the intriguing appearance of a supposed watering-hole\
    \ in north London, pictured below. I say \u201Csupposed\u201D because, reportedly,\
    \ nobody has ever been seen either entering or leaving this mysterious establishment.\
    \ My hunch is that it is some kind of portal to Plovdiv. Boffins are probably\
    \ hard at work tweaking the complicated gubbins designed to rend asunder the laws\
    \ of physics so that, on stepping through the door, one is instantly transported\u2014\
    teleported?\u2014to Plovdiv itself.\n\nMany thanks to Max D\xE9charn\xE9\_for\
    \ the snap."
