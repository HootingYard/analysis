  text: 'It is far too long since we turned our attention to the fair city of Plovdiv.
    Word reaches me, however, of the intriguing appearance of a supposed watering-hole
    in north London, pictured below. I say "supposed" because, reportedly, nobody
    has ever been seen either entering or leaving this mysterious establishment. My
    hunch is that it is some kind of portal to Plovdiv. Boffins are probably hard
    at work tweaking the complicated gubbins designed to rend asunder the laws of
    physics so that, on stepping through the door, one is instantly transported--teleported?--to
    Plovdiv itself.


    Many thanks to Max Decharne for the snap.'
