  text: Last night I was invited to Buckingham Palace to visit the pangolin. It was
    kept in a grand state room along with two rather sleepy full-grown tigers and
    a governess. The governess spoke to the pangolin--which was wearing a little red
    pill-box hat--in French. After observing these arrangements, I was escorted from
    the Palace down a tree-lined pathway by the royal zookeeper, a grey-haired man
    who expressed an interest in travelling to New York.
