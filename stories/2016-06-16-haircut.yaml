  text: 'In terms of personal grooming, I have always set great store by the pudding
    basin haircut. It is an effortlessly stylish look, achieved by having a pudding
    basin upended over one''s bonce, while one''s barber snips away any hair protruding
    below the rim. Obviously, before putting the pudding basin in place, the hair
    is combed, in a uniformly downward direction, from a central point at the apex
    of the head.

    If you wish to avail yourself of a pudding basin haircut--and I would strongly
    advise you to do so--there are a few things to bear in mind. Before donning your
    boots and windcheater and heading out to the barber''s, you should ascertain whether
    he supplies his own pudding basin. This is particularly the case if the size of
    your head strays from the human norm. If you have an unusually large head, or
    an abnormally tiny one, a standard size pudding basin will result in a very stupid
    haircut. In these circumstances, or if your barber does not supply his own pudding
    basin, be sure to take one with you.

    But before leaving the house, check that your pudding basin has been thoroughly
    cleaned since last you used it for making a pudding. Failing to do so might find
    you leaving the barber''s, later, with your new haircut splattered with bits of,
    say, sago pudding. You will be extremely fortunate to make it home without being
    beset by birds, swooping down upon your head and pecking at your hair with their
    sharp fearsome beaks, intent on gobbling up every last scrap of sago pudding,
    which most birds find irresistible. This savage pecking is also likely to cause
    catastrophic damage to your brand new haircut, and you will probably have to turn
    around and go straight back to the barber''s so he can snip snip snip it into
    some semblance of tidiness and style. He may not, however, be able to achieve
    that enviable pudding basin look you left with a few minutes earlier. Also, unless
    he is a particularly generous barber, you will have to pay him twice--and all
    because you neglected to scrub every last smidgen of sago pudding from your pudding
    basin.

    By the same token, make sure you wash the pudding basin when you get home, or
    at least before you next use it for pudding preparation. A stray hair or two may
    adhere to the inside of the basin, and thus find its way into your pudding. This
    could result in dinner party calamity, and you will become an object of disgust
    to your guests. Not even that effortlessly stylish pudding basin baircut will
    save you from consequent social disgrace and possible criminal prosecution.'
