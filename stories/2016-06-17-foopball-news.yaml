  text: "I must say that thus far the Euro2016 foopball tournament has proved somewhat\
    \ disappointing. No commentator has yet matched the majestic observation, at the\
    \ 2010 World Cup, \u201Cfor a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who'd\
    \ just plopped out of the womb\u201D. But perhaps things are looking up. Today\
    \ I have learned that the Italian defenders \u201Care like tawny owls\u201D."
