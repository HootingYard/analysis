  text: I must say that thus far the Euro2016 foopball tournament has proved somewhat
    disappointing. No commentator has yet matched the majestic observation, at the
    2010 World Cup, "for a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who'd just
    plopped out of the womb". But perhaps things are looking up. Today I have learned
    that the Italian defenders "are like tawny owls".
