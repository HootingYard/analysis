text: "From the \u201CWhat are you reading?\u201D column in this week's Times Higher\
  \ Education:\nTony Mann, director of the Maths Centre, University of Greenwich,\
  \ is reading Frank Key's Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives (Constable,\
  \ 2015) and By Aerostat to Hooting Yard: A Frank Key Reader (Dabbler, 2014, Kindle\
  \ edition). \u201CThanks to a reading at the excellent Greenwich Book Festival I\
  \ have discovered the work of Frank Key, whose humour is reminiscent of both Wodehouse\
  \ and Beckett. His stories of his imagined world, with evocative place-names and\
  \ regularly recurring characters like the out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson and the\
  \ \u2018fictional athlete\u2019 Bobnit Tivol, are unsettling, vaguely sinister and\
  \ very funny.\u201D\nClearly a very sensible Mann."
