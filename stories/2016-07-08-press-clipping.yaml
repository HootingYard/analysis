  text: 'From the "What are you reading?" column in this week''s Times Higher Education:

    Tony Mann, director of the Maths Centre, University of Greenwich, is reading Frank
    Key''s Mr Key''s Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives (Constable, 2015) and By Aerostat
    to Hooting Yard: A Frank Key Reader (Dabbler, 2014, Kindle edition). "Thanks to
    a reading at the excellent Greenwich Book Festival I have discovered the work
    of Frank Key, whose humour is reminiscent of both Wodehouse and Beckett. His stories
    of his imagined world, with evocative place-names and regularly recurring characters
    like the out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson and the ''fictional athlete'' Bobnit
    Tivol, are unsettling, vaguely sinister and very funny."

    Clearly a very sensible Mann.'
