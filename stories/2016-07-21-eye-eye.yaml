  text: "I ought to explain why things have been so quiet at Hooting Yard of late.\
    \ I am beset by a case of diabetic retinopathy\u2014plus a Roth spot\u2014and\
    \ my eyesight is, quite frankly, pitiable. Typing and peering at a computer screen\
    \ are rendered somewhat laborious, and the effort required often results in general\
    \ exhaustion and debility. Hence the lack of sweeping paragraphs of majestic etc\
    \ etc.\nBut all is not lost! I shall shortly be commencing a series of monthly\
    \ appointments at the exciting-sounding Tuesday Injection Clinic in the ophthalmic\
    \ department of my local hospital. The Key eyes will be jabbed with needles each\
    \ month until such time as my sight returns to normal\u2014normal, for me of course,\
    \ meaning myopic, akin to a mole, but much better than it is now.\nIn the meantime\
    \ I will try to post here when able, and I look forward to resuming normal service\
    \ before too long."
