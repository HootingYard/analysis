  text: "Oh look, a puffin has collapsed on that floe.\n  Wipe the steam from your\
    \ goggles and you will see it too.\n  We should airlift it to the puffin hospital\
    \ yonder in our chopper.\n  Take those corks out of your ears so you can hear\
    \ me speak.\n  Love is a mighty power, and I love puffins, as I love guillemots\
    \ and auks and bonxies.\n  Snap those icicles dangling from your nose and you\
    \ will breathe easier.\n  Here comes a blizzard. Oh, puffin, don't die.\n  Stamp\
    \ your feet in your furry boots, my companion.\n  Two men and a collapsed puffin\
    \ in a white wasteland.\n  Allegory of something or other.\n  The chopper blades\
    \ are frozen, and we are stranded, or marooned.\n  Come, Squiffy, plod with me\
    \ towards the puffin, that we may give it succour.\n  Love conquers all, if you\
    \ will wipe those damned goggles!"
