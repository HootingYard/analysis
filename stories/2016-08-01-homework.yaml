  text: 'Read and digest the piece Collapsed Puffin, below. Then reread it and redigest
    it. If necessary, rereread it and reredigest it. Now, using a sharpened pencil
    and a sheet of foolscap paper, write a variation of the piece from the point of
    view of the companion, Squiffy. You should aim to address the following matters:

    1. Why do you think the narrator keeps nagging Squiffy regarding his goggles,
    ear-corks, nasal icicles, and furry boots?

    2. Which of the pair do you think is the pilot of the chopper?

    3. Does the collapsed puffin actually exist or is it an hallucination borne of
    cold, exhaustion, or even piblokto?

    4. Do you think the narrator''s love of puffins, guillemots, auks, and bonxies
    is sincere and unreserved, or is it an affectation?

    5. Can you recall any nursery rhymes in which bonxies appear?

    When you have finished, turn over the piece of foolscap paper and, on the reverse,
    write an even more compelling variation from the point of view of the collapsed
    puffin.'
