  text: 'Back in 2007, and then again in 2010, I wrote about Kaka. Although I did
    not mention it specifically, I was at the time under the impression that Kaka
    was a foopballer. I have now learned that Kaka is, in fact, a bird. This sheds
    an entirely new light on things, and I fear I must go back to the drawing-board.
