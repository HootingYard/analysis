  text: I have just discovered this rave review of Hooting Yard by Madeleine Swann--what
    an excellent surname!--who is a British "bizarro, horror, surreal, and weird fiction
    writer". I do not know if she writes about swans, but I hope she does. Anyway,
    she has nothing but kind words to say about Mr Key and his prose, and she includes
    some links to stories featured on the Drabblecast. They include Norm Sherman;s
    matchless reading of "Far, Far Away", which Ms Swann describes as "[not] so much
    science fiction as a bowl of madness". If you have not heard Norm intone the words
    "magnetic mute blind love monkeys", then do so right now. You will not regret
    it. And many thanks to Ms Swann.
