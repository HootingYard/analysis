  text: 'Scenes From The Life Of Pansy Cradledew is our popular series in which, Boswell-like,
    we document exciting scenes from the life of Pansy Cradledew. Today, we turn our
    attention to Wednesday the third of August 2016.

    Wednesday, 3 August 2016 [aetat. 51]. It so happened that on the morning of this
    day, Ms Cradledew found herself sitting next to the head of a horse enshrouded
    in cellophane. The horse-head remained in situ for the entire morning, though
    shortly after the clock struck noon it was removed, and taken away, she knew not
    where.
