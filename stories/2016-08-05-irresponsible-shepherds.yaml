  text: '"The problem is not the sheep. The problem is irresponsible shepherds." Thus
    spake--on the radio this morning--a spokesman for the majestically-named Irresponsible
    Shepherding Task Force in the Forest of Dean. Apparently, that rustic paradise
    is riddled with irresponsible shepherds who, among sundry enormities, allow their
    sheep to bleat in the middle of the night.

    Personally, I am not surprised to learn about outbreaks of nocturnal bleating.
    Sheep are highly neurasthenic creatures who spend their entire lives in a state
    of fretfulness and nervous tension, and as a result they rarely sleep. This is
    probably one reason why, as has been observed by several country persons, a sheep''s
    ambition in life is to die.'
