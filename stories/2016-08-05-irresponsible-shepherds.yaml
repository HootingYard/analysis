  text: "\u201CThe problem is not the sheep. The problem is irresponsible shepherds.\u201D\
    \ Thus spake\u2014on the radio this morning\u2014a spokesman for the majestically-named\
    \ Irresponsible Shepherding Task Force in the Forest of Dean. Apparently, that\
    \ rustic paradise is riddled with irresponsible shepherds who, among sundry enormities,\
    \ allow their sheep to bleat in the middle of the night.\nPersonally, I am not\
    \ surprised to learn about outbreaks of nocturnal bleating. Sheep are highly neurasthenic\
    \ creatures who spend their entire lives in a state of fretfulness and nervous\
    \ tension, and as a result they rarely sleep. This is probably one reason why,\
    \ as has been observed by several country persons, a sheep's ambition in life\
    \ is to die."
