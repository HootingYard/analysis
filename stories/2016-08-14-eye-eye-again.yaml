  text: 'Last week I went for my first appointment at the Tuesday Injection Clinic
    (which I think of as the Tuesday Injection Club). I learned a number of things.
    One, that I would be attending every fortnight, rather than every month, until
    at least the end of the year. Two, that the entire procedure passes off efficiently
    and painlessly.

    But the most important lesson I have learned is that I am now armed with a stupendously
    effective conversational gambit. Let us imagine, just for one wild moment, that
    one of these days I actually get invited to a swish sophisticated cocktail party
    where I can lean insouciantly against a mantelpiece. Now picture various other
    guests approaching me to engage in conversation with what they fondly imagine
    will be impressive anecdotes.

    "Let me tell you about the time I met John F Kennedy", would say my ex-employer
    Elkan Allan (were he not late and lamented). Or, "One of my blog posts was picked
    up by the Huffington Post", would say my sister Rita Byrne Tull. Or it might be
    someone telling me they had climbed Everest, or swum the Channel, or discovered
    the Fab Four, or any number of thrilling facts.

    And now imagine a moment of silence, while I pause and play that pause for all
    it''s worth, and I then say, "Well, that''s very interesting", and then I declare,
    in resounding tones, "But every two weeks I have needles injected directly into
    my eyeballs!"

    I can assure you that the effect is electrifying. I have already tried it out
    a few times--though sadly not in the context of a swish sophisticated cocktail
    party--and I can report that jaws drop, eyes boggle, and questions are fired at
    me. I, of course, retain an air of insouciant calm.

    I tell you what, as medical issues go, this one certainly beats water-on-the-knee
    or mad cow disease when it comes to mopping the floor with rival anecdotists.'
