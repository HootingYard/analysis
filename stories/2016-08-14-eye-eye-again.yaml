  text: "Last week I went for my first appointment at the Tuesday Injection Clinic\
    \ (which I think of as the Tuesday Injection Club). I learned a number of things.\
    \ One, that I would be attending every fortnight, rather than every month, until\
    \ at least the end of the year. Two, that the entire procedure passes off efficiently\
    \ and painlessly.\nBut the most important lesson I have learned is that I am now\
    \ armed with a stupendously effective conversational gambit. Let us imagine, just\
    \ for one wild moment, that one of these days I actually get invited to a swish\
    \ sophisticated cocktail party where I can lean insouciantly against a mantelpiece.\
    \ Now picture various other guests approaching me to engage in conversation with\
    \ what they fondly imagine will be impressive anecdotes.\n\u201CLet me tell you\
    \ about the time I met John F Kennedy\u201D, would say my ex-employer Elkan Allan\
    \ (were he not late and lamented). Or, \u201COne of my blog posts was picked up\
    \ by the Huffington Post\u201D, would say my sister Rita Byrne Tull. Or it might\
    \ be someone telling me they had climbed Everest, or swum the Channel, or discovered\
    \ the Fab Four, or any number of thrilling facts.\nAnd now imagine a moment of\
    \ silence, while I pause and play that pause for all it's worth, and I then say,\
    \ \u201CWell, that's very interesting\u201D, and then I declare, in resounding\
    \ tones, \u201CBut every two weeks I have needles injected directly into my eyeballs!\u201D\
    \nI can assure you that the effect is electrifying. I have already tried it out\
    \ a few times\u2014though sadly not in the context of a swish sophisticated cocktail\
    \ party\u2014and I can report that jaws drop, eyes boggle, and questions are fired\
    \ at me. I, of course, retain an air of insouciant calm.\nI tell you what, as\
    \ medical issues go, this one certainly beats water-on-the-knee or mad cow disease\
    \ when it comes to mopping the floor with rival anecdotists."
