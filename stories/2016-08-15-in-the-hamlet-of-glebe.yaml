  text: In the hamlet of Glebe there is a blind brute, the village wrestler, a man
    with the mien of a squirrel, or perhaps of a distressed mole, and they coax him,
    this brute, with fronds, for he is fond of fronds, they coax him out of his cubby
    and drive him out of the hamlet and up into the hills, poking at him with their
    pitchforks and making awful guttural yelps to affright him, and when he is up
    in the hills, they scamper back, the villagers, and hold a picnic upon the green,
    munching their sausages and plums and swigging their cans of Squelcho!, singing
    roundelays and setting fire to ladybirds, they are oh! a vicious lot, each and
    every one, and the blind village wrestler dares not return until nightfall, from
    up in the hills, he senses the twinkling stars by sniffing and by running his
    fat fingers through the air, and when he is sure it is night he comes clumping
    down from the hills, pausing to slurp water from rills, and he enters the hamlet
    of Glebe in the darkness and crosses the green, and he stumbles upon the picnic
    remnants, discarded sausages and plums, the sausages of contaminated meat and
    the plums half-rotten and sour, and he gobbles them down his squirrely, moley
    gullet, and then, by touch, he gathers up the crumpled and empty Squelcho! cans
    and carries them to his cubby and falls into a dreamless snooze, from which he
    wakes, in the morning, when he hears the clink and clank of the milk cart, and
    the horrible "halloo!"s of the villagers, and he takes his hammer and beats flat
    the Squelcho! cans and adds the flattened tin to his store of flattened tin and
    he knows that soon, oh!, soon, perhaps in three or four picnics' time, he will
    have enough tin to fashion for himself a suit of tin armour, fitting him from
    squirrely head to moley toes, and then he will no longer fear the poking of pitchforks,
    and he will come clattering out from his cubby and roar and bash and bash and
    bash and bash until each and every one of the horrible wankers of the hamlet of
    Glebe is lying sprawled upon the green, groaning for mercy, and it will be a fine
    day, and he will set them on fire, each and every one, just as they set on fire
    the ladybirds, at every damnable picnic, and then the blind brute village wrestler
    will cast off his Squelcho! can tin armour and he will stride up into the hills
    where, over many moons, he has built a shrine, and he will slump on to his knees
    before the shrine and pound his fists upon the earth and declaim, in awestruck
    tones, his eternal devotion to the Ladybird God.
