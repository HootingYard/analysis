  text: "The third and final part of an old, old story.\nIII. October 1928\nWe docked\
    \ at 0800 hours. Bingle, Carg, Linnet, Frack and Pinmouth were detailed to search\
    \ the northern half of the island, while Bewg, Shimm, Jabber, Thurp and myself\
    \ took the south. I left Wicket and Birdhole aboard the ship, with strict instructions.\
    \ I cannot remember what the instructions were, but they were strict, make no\
    \ mistake about that.\nThe five of us who comprised the southern party set out.\
    \ It rapidly became apparent that the boulders and rocks on the island were giving\
    \ off violent magnetic discharges. The tension was oppressive. We saw what looked\
    \ like ball lightning far in the distance. I instructed Bewg to make sketches\
    \ in his little pad, but he complained that his pencil was blunt. Between us we\
    \ could not muster a pencil sharpener. I was loth to have Bewg return to the ship\
    \ alone to fetch the required implement, so I instructed Jabber to accompany him.\
    \ I pressed on with Shimm and Thurp, the latter carefully scraping rock and mud\
    \ samples into our canister. The path ahead was burned and scorched\u2014by what\
    \ agency was not clear to us.\nAt 0950 hours Birdhole joined our party. She brought\
    \ with her the ship's pencil sharpener. Apparently Bewg had suffered an attack\
    \ of the seeds, and was having a lie down in his cabin. I made a mental note to\
    \ tick him off later. I remember that clearly, because at the very moment I thought\
    \ it a mighty crevasse opened in the ground directly in front of us. Thurp was\
    \ swallowed up, as the earth cracked apart. The rest of us staggered backwards.\
    \ I am glad that I had the presence of mind to tell Birdhole to execute a quick\
    \ sketch in Bewg's pad. She complained that she had not yet had a chance to sharpen\
    \ the pencil, but I cut her short with a screech of blood-curdling ferocity. One\
    \ is taught to do that sort of thing at officer school.\nShimm put down her accordion\
    \ and made an impromptu bridge across the crevasse using all our footwear tied\
    \ together. We clambered across, and pressed on, although not before Birdhole\
    \ had insisted upon holding a commemorative service for the sadly departed Thurp.\
    \ Why I allowed it I do not know. I can be a sentimental old buzzard. While Birdhole\
    \ was ululating, we were joined by the northern party, who had completed their\
    \ investigations. Other than some extremely fascinating magnetic readings, ornithological\
    \ discoveries, amateur geological observations, a net full of moths and a worm\
    \ count, they had nothing to report. I commanded Frack or Pinmouth\u2014I never\
    \ could tell them apart\u2014to return to the ship, but I cannot remember why.\
    \ Whichever one it was sent Jabber back to us. I had suspected her of idling around\
    \ like Bewg, but she made haste to tell me that she had cast a Mackenzie Beam\
    \ from the ship. I patted her on the head, not without some misgivings, as I do\
    \ not think she had ever washed her hair. At last Birdhole stopped howling, and\
    \ we pressed on. We passed an enormous heap of skeletons\u2014bat and human, according\
    \ to Bingle's eagle-eyed diagnosis\u2014and various other manifestations of what\
    \ Lamouche calls la flaque de la mort. I have Jabber to thank for that quotation.\
    \ Birdhole wanted to delay further to give the two human skeletons a decent Christian\
    \ burial, but I cuffed her on the temples and snarled at her.\nThe ground over\
    \ which we passed became rough and spiky, and we had to tread carefully in our\
    \ socks. We would retrieve our tough adventurer's boots on our return trip, when\
    \ we would be able to dismantle Shimm's bridge. Frack or Pinmouth handed around\
    \ some custard-balls for sustenance. Then, as we hacked our way through some overhanging\
    \ foliage, we suddenly came face to face with the building. It was smaller than\
    \ we expected, like a scale model of a typical nineteenth century Bolivian civic\
    \ hall, and it had all the hallmarks of having been constructed out of bat droppings.\
    \ I removed my hat in awe. The others did likewise, except for Shimm, who was\
    \ not wearing a hat, Linnet, whose hat had snagged on the branch of a dunstable\
    \ tree a few hundred yards back, and Birdhole, whose hat had been glued to her\
    \ head for the duration of the expedition for some obscure religious purpose.\
    \ I had interrogated her on this point back at Tantarabim, and will publish the\
    \ documents separately.\nOf course, we could not stand around like a bunch of\
    \ clots all day. I jammed my hat back on my head and commanded my team to get\
    \ to work. I was heartened to see that they set to it with such gusto. Within\
    \ minutes, the instruments had been unpacked, the music stands set up, sheet music\
    \ distributed, and everyone was at their post ready to tune up. The band was as\
    \ follows: Bingle on bugle, Carg on bassoon, Shimm on accordion, Jabber on sackbut,\
    \ Linnet on harmonium, Frack or Pinmouth on castanets, and Birdhole on handbells.\
    \ I myself conducted and played the cornet. We ran through a few bars of Bring\
    \ Me Your Winding-Sheet, Oh Mother Of Mine before settling down to the concert\
    \ proper. Macaws shrieked but we drowned them out. We played my arrangements of\
    \ Die sieben letzten Worte des Erl\xF6sers am Kreuze (Haydn), Sonatine Bureaucratique\
    \ (Satie) and The Anti-Abolitionist Riots (Ives). For an encore, we performed\
    \ a rousing version of The Consumptive's Vest (Jabber, arr. Birdhole). Then we\
    \ packed up. I ordered Birdhole to make some detailed sketches of the building\
    \ in Bewg's little pad, and we also took measurements and poked about the place\
    \ a bit. But night would soon be falling, and there was no let up in the magnetic\
    \ activity of this accursed island. The sooner we returned to the ship the better.\
    \ The journey back passed without incident. We collected our boots after re-crossing\
    \ Shimm's bridge over the chasm. Thurp's body had fallen so far it was not visible.\
    \ We did not tarry. Wicket and Pinmouth or Frack were on duty on the bridge. They\
    \ had received warnings of volcanic activity over the radio. Before we set sail,\
    \ I went into Bewg's cabin and told him I would brook no further nonsense from\
    \ him. I presented him with a rag and told him to go and polish everything on\
    \ the ship. Back on deck, I found Linnet mucking about with the Mackenzie Beam.\
    \ I let it pass; I was a tired woman. We weighed anchor, and headed home at last.\
    \ Only later did I discover I had left my cornet on the island. I cannot bear\
    \ to go back there to retrieve it."
