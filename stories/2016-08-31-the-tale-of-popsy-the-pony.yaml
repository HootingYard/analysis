  text: "Before reading, see here and here.\nHullo tinies! Are you sitting comfortably?\
    \ Then I shall begin.\nOnce upon a time there was a lovely little pony named Popsy.\
    \ Popsy the Pony lived in a meadow splattered with buttercups. It was a lovely\
    \ meadow. The sun was always shining, the weather was always balmy, and the other\
    \ animals in the meadow\u2014birds and insects and burrowing moles\u2014were happy\
    \ and contented. Of course it was a completely artificial and unnatural meadow,\
    \ quite unlike real nature, which is bloody and gruesome and utterly horrifying,\
    \ full of violence and pain and death. Just ask a sheep. Sheep know. That is why\
    \ they barely get a wink of sleep, they are so frightened and fretful.\nAnyway,\
    \ tinies, one day Popsy the Pony was having a lovely time in the lovely meadow\
    \ when, all of a sudden, this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion of\
    \ reality \u2026 no, let me rephrase that \u2026 this pastoral idyll was shattered\
    \ by the intrusion of the hidden, Lovecraftian, true reality beyond our puny human\
    \ comprehension, and Popsy the Pony was slobberingly devoured by an enormous squid\
    \ from the Black Pit of Hellish Nothingness. Slobber slobber slobber! Eek eek\
    \ eek!\nThe end. Now, tinies, you may run away screaming and blubbing like fotherington-tomas."
