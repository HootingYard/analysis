    Hullo tinies! Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin.

    Once upon a time there was a lovely little pony named Popsy. Popsy the Pony lived
    in a meadow splattered with buttercups. It was a lovely meadow. The sun was always
    shining, the weather was always balmy, and the other animals in the meadow--birds
    and insects and burrowing moles--were happy and contented. Of course it was a
    completely artificial and unnatural meadow, quite unlike real nature, which is
    bloody and gruesome and utterly horrifying, full of violence and pain and death.
    Just ask a sheep. Sheep know. That is why they barely get a wink of sleep, they
    are so frightened and fretful.

    Anyway, tinies, one day Popsy the Pony was having a lovely time in the lovely
    meadow when, all of a sudden, this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion
    of reality ... no, let me rephrase that ... this pastoral idyll was shattered
    by the intrusion of the hidden, Lovecraftian, true reality beyond our puny human
    comprehension, and Popsy the Pony was slobberingly devoured by an enormous squid
    from the Black Pit of Hellish Nothingness. Slobber slobber slobber! Eek eek eek!

    The end. Now, tinies, you may run away screaming and blubbing like fotherington-tomas.'
