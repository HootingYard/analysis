  text: 'A letter plops on to the mat:

    Dear Mr Key, My name is Neville Mossop. The latest outpouring on your foolish
    website was brought to my attention by my dentist. I have to say that I do not
    take kindly to having my name bandied about by the likes of you, purely for the
    purpose of amusing your readers (if there are any, apart from my dentist). You
    did not even bother to seek my permission. If you knew anything about me, I doubt
    you would be so cavalier. I have had a very difficult life. As a child I was teased
    incessantly by my playmates on account of my inability to punctuate sentences
    after my opening sallies they treated me cruelly oh so cruelly in fact one day
    when I went to have a go on the swings a boy whose name coincidentally was also
    Neville Mossop took a bowl of milk slops and upended it over my head then poked
    at me with a twig while reciting in a singsong voice some ditty he had learned
    from a book of insulting ditties I cannot recall the exact words but they pierced
    me like spikes and I began to blub like a ninny which only made things worse particularly
    when I arrived home and saw that my ma was cooking swordfish for supper again
    even though she knew quite well that swordfish played havoc with my innards I
    will spare you the details because they are too monstrous to repeat suffice to
    say I had to be carted off to a clinic and missed a whole term of school I think
    the one where they taught punctuation of sentences after the first few so you
    can appreciate that I have had a terrible time and have become a self-pitying
    whiner rather than the international man of mystery with a Peter Wyngarde style
    moustache I always yearned to be and still do but I fear it is too late as I am
    now ninety two years of age and very few if any agencies employ international
    men of mystery of such advanced years and I would say I live in hope but I do
    not I am thoroughly pessimistic to the point where I wake up every morning groaning
    and cursing the memory of Neville Mossop my childhood acquaintance who caused
    me such grief and now I have to put up with you causing me grief too as well as
    my dentist who told me not to waste his time making an appointment to see him
    when I have not got any teeth left in my gob being so old and withered unlike
    the young scamp with the same name as me who chases swans in parks I never chased
    a swan but you should know that the only reason I left the clinic after that bout
    of swordfish poisoning was because I was chased out of it by swans a whole gaggle
    of them honking horribly they chased me out of my bed and out of the ward and
    along the corridor and down the stairs and out of the door and into the grounds
    and out of the gate and I was still in my hospital gown and still the swans came
    after me savage and relentless and then I developed a massive nosebleed which
    was the last thing I needed well I suppose not the last thing because the last
    thing would be death and it is rare to die from a nosebleed but I expect you would
    die from one if the flow was not staunched I staunched mine that day with some
    rags I found in a bin you can find all sorts of things in bins if you rummage
    for example just the other day I found some pages torn out of a book by Dennis
    Beerpint that someone had obviously found so stupid that they ripped them out
    and threw them away well I kept them and took them home and read them very carefully
    again and again over the next few days until I realised they were utter twaddle
    at which point I crumpled them up and took them back to the same bin to throw
    them away like the other person had done but the bin was gone it had been removed
    by municipal bin removers one of whom I later learned was also called Neville
    Mossop as were two of his colleagues which is quite a series of coincidences or
    maybe not perhaps it was a deliberate recruitment policy pursued by a madcap town
    hall bureaucrat whose name might also have been Neville Mossop for all I know
    and I suppose I could find out by going to the town hall and banging my fist on
    the reception desk until someone gave me a list of all the bureaucrats in the
    town hall but when you get to the age of ninety two the prospect of making the
    bus journey to the town hall is a bit too much to cope with and it seems far more
    enticing to stay sprawled in your bed cursing the young scamp Neville Mossop and
    swans and swordfish and people like you Mr Key who think it is amusing to write
    poppycock about someone you have never met and who might take umbrage at having
    his name besmirched. Yours sincerely, Neville Mossop.'
