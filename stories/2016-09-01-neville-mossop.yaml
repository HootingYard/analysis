  text: "In her comment on yesterday's Tale of Popsy the Pony, Pansy Cradledew berates\
    \ me for failing to give the name of the squid. I accept that this was an unforgivable\
    \ omission and fatally undermines what might otherwise have been a classic text\
    \ destined to be read and reread and rereread throughout the ages. Thus I am more\
    \ than happy to inform Ms Cradledew, and other readers--if there are any--that\
    \ the slobbering squid is named Neville Mossop. Neville is quite a common name\
    \ in the squid population, Mossop less so.\nNeville Mossop also happens to be\
    \ the name of the young scamp seen chasing a swan on a new piece of signage in\
    \ St James's Park. He was chosen from a pool of over a thousand applicants to\
    \ appear on the sign. There is some evidence that the pool was the very same pool\
    \ into which Neville Mossop (the squid) slithered, after devouring Popsy the Pony,\
    \ but this has yet to be confirmed.\n\nIncidentally, Neville Mossop also turns\
    \ up in a new collection by twee poet Dennis Beerpint:\nThere was a young fellow\
    \ from Glossop\n  Whose name was Neville Mossop\n  He frightened swans\nThis is\
    \ one of the so-called \"truncated limericks\" in the Beerpint book, entitled\
    \ Truncated Limericks By Dennis Beerpint, Daddy-o! Towards the end of the book,\
    \ there are a number of what the winsome versifier calls \"severely truncated\
    \ limericks\", such as:\nThere\nIn a review of this slim volume, critic Stockard\
    \ Owlhead writes: \"Dennis Beerpint is an utter nitwit\".\nDo you have any exciting\
    \ Neville Mossop information? Do not on any account share it. Just keep it to\
    \ yourself, you pimpled popinjay!"
