  text: 'Some years ago, Outa_Spaceman described Hooting Yard thus: "a world of heroic
    infants rubbing shoulders with tugboat captains, extravagantly bouffanted composers
    drinking and fighting in seedy dockside taverns, Jesuit priests lurking in kiosks
    on abandoned seaside piers, bat gods haunting abandoned potato research stations,
    huge grunting ogres drinking from cisterns in horrible caves, and where diktats
    are being issued to Community Learning Hubs by suburban shamans". Rereading this,
    recently, I thought to myself, "How right he is!". But then I thought, "Hmm. We
    have not seen many tugboat captains hereabouts of late!". My thoughts are not
    always followed by exclamation marks, but those two were.

    Casting around in my mind for a tugboat captain I could tell you about, I recalled
    the skipper of the tugboat Blavatsky. This fellow was neurasthenic and highly-strung,
    character traits which are quite undesirable in a tugboat captain, and led to
    several unfortunate episodes. Big majestic ships being tugged by the Blavatsky
    suffered a series of minor and major calamities, from dents below the plimsoll
    line to scuppering upon sandbanks to attacks by enormous flocks of deranged guillemots.
    These incidents were not always the result of the tugboat skipper''s mental weakness,
    but whether he was responsible or no, when the big ships'' captains gathered in
    conclave they laid the blame firmly at his door.

    "He is neurasthenic and highly-strung," they said, "He cannot be allowed to tug
    our ships."

    With no big majestic ships to tug, the Blavatsky lost its purpose, and so too
    did its skipper. He took to traipsing the deck of the tugboat wailing and keening,
    driving the rest of the crew crackers. Eventually his second-in-command, the science
    officer, took him aside, bundled him into a cabin, and gave him a talking-to.
    Like several seconds-in-command, he was half-Vulcan, with pointy ears, and he
    spoke with compelling logic.

    "The Blavatsky is a tugboat, Captain," he said, "And therefore it must tug something.
    If we cannot tug big majestic ships we will have to find something else to tug."

    "But what?, dammit, what?" yelled the skipper, who was clearly close to the end
    of his already frayed tether.

    "Well, Captain," replied his pointy-eared science officer, "It so happens I have
    been reading some back numbers of the Daily Pony Predations Digest. It seems there
    is, loose in the land, but happily close to the coast, an enormous squid named
    Neville Mossop. It is already responsible for slobberingly devouring one twee
    little pony, and logically one must assume it will go on to consume others in
    its awful hideous Lovecraftian manner. We can stop it, Captain. I suggest we send
    a landing party, capture the squid, drag it to shore, then attach it to our tugboat
    with chains, and tug it far out to sea so it can no longer prey upon ponies."

    "That''s a fantastic idea!" cried the skipper, and at once his mood lifted and
    he ceased keening.

    Without further ado, he sent a landing party which captured the squid, dragged
    it to shore, attached it to the tugboat with chains, and tugged it far out to
    sea.

    "This is terrific!" said the skipper, "We are tugging something, just as a tugboat
    must, if it is fit to be called a tugboat!"

    But his joy was short-lived. For unbeknown to the skipper, far out at sea the
    enormous squid''s distressed mother was searching for her son. Mrs Chlorine Winslow
    Mossop was so gigantic a giant squid that she made Neville look like a mere minnow.
    And when she found him, she reared up from beneath the waves, towering over the
    tugboat, her tentacles thrashing violently, and from suckers on those tentacles
    she emitted an eldritch viscous goo that burned through the iron chains tugging
    her son as if they were wisps of straw, and she freed him. And then, with a horrible
    gurgling noise so loud it made the sun shake in the heavens, she slobberingly
    devoured the tugboat Blavatsky and its crew, in a single awful gulp.

    It happened that at the very last second, just as he was about to be swallowed
    up, the skipper managed somehow to kick himself clear. He swam away, as the gigantic
    squid and her almost as gigantic son disappeared into the chthonic depths of the
    broiling sea. He swam and swam, until he reached a remote atoll. Exhausted, he
    clung to the rock and slowly, agonisingly, pulled himself up out of the sloshing
    sea. He was marooned, but no longer imperilled.

    In spite of his highly-strung neurasthenia, the skipper was a resourceful fellow,
    and he kept himself alive by drinking rainwater and eating barnacles and the occasional
    guillemot which plummeted unaccountably from the sky. And he kept his mind busy
    by studying, from memory, Catholic theology, to the point where one day, several
    years after his maroonment, he felt able to ordain himself as a Jesuit priest.

    And that, children, is the story of how the legendary Atoll Jesuit came to hold
    sway over a remote stretch of the vast and merciless sea. Amen.'
