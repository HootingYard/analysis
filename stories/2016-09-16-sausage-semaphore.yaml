  text: 'It is sometimes appropriate to signal a want of sausages in semaphore. For
    example, you might find yourself sausageless in the middle of a desolate plain,
    some sort of Biblical wilderness, ravenous for sausages but, happily, in possession
    of two brightly-coloured flags. If you have a smattering of semaphore, and a broad
    knowledge of sausage types, it should not be beyond your wit to signal your want
    of sausages, using the flags, to a distant passer-by. Whether this passer-by will
    be able to satisfy your sausagelust is, of course, quite another matter.

    We should also take into account the very distinct possibility that such a signalling
    is beyond your wit--in short, that you are witless, or, if not entirely witless,
    then a halfwit. Standing about in the middle of a plain with a couple of flags
    yet bereft of sausages is the sort of behaviour we might expect from a halfwit.

    Halfwits and dunderpates are not the best people when it comes to accurate and
    reliable semaphore signals. Indeed, they can become so muddle-headed in their
    attempts to deploy a pair of flags according to a well-established code that their
    message is likely to be gibberish. This will leave the distant passer-by scratching
    their head in confusion and deciding to continue on their stroll, along the edge
    of the plain, perhaps Luneburg Heath, with their dog in tow.

    Most dogs can sniff out sausages with bewildering acuity. There are even some
    dogs known as "sausage dogs". It can all become very complicated, especially if
    you are a halfwit.'
