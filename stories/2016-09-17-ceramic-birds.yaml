  text: 'You can count on the fingers of one, deformed, hand the number of ornithologists
    who have paid serious attention to the clay pigeon. This is rather surprising,
    as it is a highly unusual bird. Unlike most birds, the clay pigeon has neither
    feathers, nor talons, nor a beak. It is flightless, and inanimate. Uniquely in
    the avian kingdom, it is disc-shaped, and made of clay.

    In view of this neglect, the reissue of a classic text is most welcome. All due
    praise, then, to the Circular Ceramic Bird Press for its recent publication of
    The Clay Pigeon : Its Migration Patterns, Nesting Habits, And Terrible Attrition
    Rate Caused By Shooting, written by the wild man of ornithology, Walter Mad, originally
    issued in 1926, on the eve of the General Strike.

    The new edition is a facsimile, down to the last detail, including those endpapers
    which caused such a fuss and were eventually to lead, by all sorts of weird and
    eerie twists and turns, to the Hindenburg disaster on 6 May 1937. Let it be clear,
    once and for all, that Walter Mad played no part in that dreadful event, and was
    nowhere near Naval Air Station Lakehurst in New Jersey at the time. Yes, yes,
    his brother Wilfred was there, and they were identical twins, and there is certain
    photographic evidence, and one or two sworn affidavits, and the compelling testimony
    of Flossie Pilbrow, the noted spirit medium who perished aboard the flame-engulfed
    airship and later sent telepathic messages from the beyond, but even when you
    add all these things up, and take into account eye-witness statements and the
    so-called "peevish bus conductor''s bombshell", there remains scarcely a shred
    of evidence to connect Walter Mad with the disaster.

    Better that we remember him for his excellent book on the clay pigeon, even if
    much of it is ludicrous twaddle that no proper ornithologist has ever taken seriously.
    But what do proper ornithologists know, eh? Most of them cannot tell a nightjar
    from a stonechat, especially in cases where both the nightjar and the stonechat
    have been modelled in clay by tiptop bird ceramicists.

    God give me strength.'
