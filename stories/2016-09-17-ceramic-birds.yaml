  text: "You can count on the fingers of one, deformed, hand the number of ornithologists\
    \ who have paid serious attention to the clay pigeon. This is rather surprising,\
    \ as it is a highly unusual bird. Unlike most birds, the clay pigeon has neither\
    \ feathers, nor talons, nor a beak. It is flightless, and inanimate. Uniquely\
    \ in the avian kingdom, it is disc-shaped, and made of clay.\nIn view of this\
    \ neglect, the reissue of a classic text is most welcome. All due praise, then,\
    \ to the Circular Ceramic Bird Press for its recent publication of The Clay Pigeon\_\
    : Its Migration Patterns, Nesting Habits, And Terrible Attrition Rate Caused By\
    \ Shooting, written by the wild man of ornithology, Walter Mad, originally issued\
    \ in 1926, on the eve of the General Strike.\nThe new edition is a facsimile,\
    \ down to the last detail, including those endpapers which caused such a fuss\
    \ and were eventually to lead, by all sorts of weird and eerie twists and turns,\
    \ to the Hindenburg disaster on 6 May 1937. Let it be clear, once and for all,\
    \ that Walter Mad played no part in that dreadful event, and was nowhere near\
    \ Naval Air Station Lakehurst in New Jersey at the time. Yes, yes, his brother\
    \ Wilfred was there, and they were identical twins, and there is certain photographic\
    \ evidence, and one or two sworn affidavits, and the compelling testimony of Flossie\
    \ Pilbrow, the noted spirit medium who perished aboard the flame-engulfed airship\
    \ and later sent telepathic messages from the beyond, but even when you add all\
    \ these things up, and take into account eye-witness statements and the so-called\
    \ \u201Cpeevish bus conductor's bombshell\u201D, there remains scarcely a shred\
    \ of evidence to connect Walter Mad with the disaster.\nBetter that we remember\
    \ him for his excellent book on the clay pigeon, even if much of it is ludicrous\
    \ twaddle that no proper ornithologist has ever taken seriously. But what do proper\
    \ ornithologists know, eh? Most of them cannot tell a nightjar from a stonechat,\
    \ especially in cases where both the nightjar and the stonechat have been modelled\
    \ in clay by tiptop bird ceramicists.\nGod give me strength."
