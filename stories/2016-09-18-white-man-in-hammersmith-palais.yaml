  text: 'In order to fully appreciate (White Man) In Hammersmith Palais, a song written
    and recorded by The Clash in 1978, we must get a firm grasp upon the words in
    the title. Before we do so, let me be quite clear that I am going to pay no attention
    whatsoever to the parentheses. In my view--and I grant that I may be in error
    here--placing "White Man" in parentheses is a mere affectation, and has no significance
    whatsoever. The truth of this can be underlined by removing the parentheses and
    judging if it makes any difference. Thus, (White Man) In Hammersmith Palais, or--pfft!,
    there!, gone!--White Man In Hammersmith Palais. I challenge anybody to insert
    a very very thin thing, like a cigarette paper, between the two. We may now press
    on, indomitably.

    White. What do we mean by white? Is it a colour or, as some would have it, the
    absence of colour? The white of an egg--the albumen--is more translucent than
    white, in its raw state. But fry the egg, in a pan, and voila!, it is indeed white.
    By the way, it would be a mistake to infer from this that all fried things are
    white. Most are not.

    To gain a sense of overwhelming whiteness, it is well worth reading the closing
    passages of The Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym Of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe.
    If you read it while drinking a glass of milk, the effect of whiteness will be
    redoubled. If, in addition, you tip the entire contents of a tub of talcum powder
    over your head and look up from your book, from time to time, into a mirror, you
    will be left in no doubt about what white means.

    Next, Man. Man is the male of the species homo sapiens. In most cases, he is a
    biped, but not invariably. For example, Ian Anderson, the front man--man!--of
    the band Jethro Tull, prefers to stand on one leg when playing his flute. He is
    thus, at least temporarily, a monopod.

    What else can we say, usefully, about a man? Well, for one thing, we can differentiate
    between types of men (plural) by placing a qualifying adjective before "man".
    This might be in the form of prefix jammed up against "man", with no space between,
    as for example "Frenchman" or "postman", or it might be a discrete, separate,
    interchangeable word, as in "grunty man" or "stricken man".

    Off the coast of England there is a place called the Isle of Man, but we had better
    avoid that, particularly as its flag is a triskelion of three armoured legs. That
    is one and a half standard issue bipedal men, or three Jethro Tull flautists,
    the thought of which begins to dizzy the brain.

    In we can dispatch fairly rapidly. It is a short word indicating that something
    is contained within something else, for example the talcum powder was in the tub
    before we upended it over our head. Now, the talcum powder is no longer in the
    tub. It really is as simple as that. Just be careful not to confuse in with inn.
    The latter is a tavern or hostelry. If a man enters one, parched and thirsty and
    covered in talcum powder, he is said to be in an inn. Conversely, if he engages
    in fisticuffs with another customer, because he is teased for being covered in
    talcum powder, he risks being thrown out of the inn. The chances of this happening
    are more likely if, in the inn, he drinks a sufficient quantity of beer to be
    in his cups. This does not mean he is literally inside a cup, or several cups,
    as the plural suggests. It is a figure of speech.

    We are not going to go further down the road of figures of speech, because quite
    frankly it is exasperating enough having to explain all this stuff to you, just
    so you can grasp fully the title of a punk single from almost forty years ago.
    I have better things to do with my time. So let us wrap this up as soon as we
    can.

    Hammersmith. This is a proper name, referring to an area of London. London is
    usually pronounced Lund''n, but for amusement''s sake it is better pronounced
    as it looks, with the two "on"s equally stressed as if one were saying the word
    on. This is particularly the case when responding to queries from tourists vacantly
    wandering the streets of London. Now, natives of London may well pronounce Hammersmith
    as Ammersmiff, depending on their social class. As the son of a globe-trotting
    Foreign Office diplomat, Joe Strummer, the front man of The Clash, would have
    been brought up to say Hammersmith rather than Ammersmiff.

    Incidentally, I hope I did not give the impression, earlier, that all front men
    in bands stand on one leg while playing the flute. That is true of Ian Anderson
    of Jethro Tull. So far as I know, it is not true of Joe Strummer of The Clash.
    But again, I grant that I may be wrong, and if any readers can provide photographic
    evidence to the contrary I will be happy to issue a correction.

    You will note that Hammersmith is a conjunction of two words, hammer and smith.
    A smith might use a hammer when beating, say, a horseshoe into the required shape
    at his anvil. Once upon a time this was so widely practised a trade that Smith
    is a common surname, Hammer less so. Instances of the former are too numerous
    to mention, though we can give one-time Wimbledon champion Stan Smith as an example.
    As for the latter, we might note the American hip hoppist M C Hammer, a man who
    has reportedly confessed to a fear of hammers. As with Strummer, Hammer is not
    known for monopodal flute-playing.

    At last, and not before time, we come to Palais. You will recall, in our discussion
    of Man, above, that we mentioned a Frenchman. It so happens that a Frenchman says
    palais where his English equivalent would say palace. Usually, a palace or palais
    is the sort of building inhabited by the likes of Prince Fulgencio. Hammersmith
    Palais, or Ammersmiff Palace, is, or was, not that kind of palace. Rather, it
    was a place where young persons would gather en masse in a sort of mosh pit and
    disport themselves in an often ungainly manner while listening to loud music or,
    as some might have it, a godawful racket. There was at least one occasion when
    Prince Fulgencio himself left his palace, or palais, to enter a mosh pit, where
    he galumphed about in the presence of a band of troubadours led by a man standing
    on one leg playing a flute. But that is a tale for another time.

    It is to be hoped that you now have a greater understanding of (White Man) In
    Hammersmith Palais by The Clash. Next week, we shall examine I Close My Eyes And
    Count To Ten by Dusty Springfield. For your preparatory homework, please read
    Dobson''s pamphlet Arithmetic For The Blind (out of print).'
