  text: 'Apologies for the lengthy silence. I''ll tell you all about it at another
    time. For now, in light of the passing of Leonard Cohen, here is a piece I wrote
    for The Dabbler five years ago.

    Cohen tells us, in his song Suzanne, that "there are heroes in the seaweed". Oh
    really?, I asked myself, not without a dash of skepticism, And what precisely
    would heroes be doing, disporting themselves in the sargassum and the kelp? Still,
    one does not wish to dismiss out of hand the words of a figure of such stature,
    so I summoned my sidekick and went to investigate.

    Out by the aerodrome, we boarded a charabanc heading for the seashore, but not
    before arming ourselves each with a long and pointy stick. These, I explained
    to my somewhat dim sidekick, we would use to poke about the seaweed in search
    of heroes. He seemed satisfied with this intelligence, but as the charabanc gathered
    speed crossing the wild and windy moors, he babbled questions at me.

    Which particular heroes were they, that were to be found in the seaweed? Heroes
    of Ancient Greece, such as Heracles and Theseus and Jason and Bellerophon? Tragic
    heroes such as Orestes and Oedipus and Hamlet? Byronic heroes? Guitar heroes?
    Boys'' Own Paper heroes? Or modern-day superheroes such as Batman and Spiderman
    and Unconscious Squirrel!, The Unconscious Squirrel? Or would we find, entangled
    in the seaweed, representatives of all these types of hero, and more? And were
    they trapped in the seaweed, struggling heroically to escape from it, or had they
    made it their natural habitat, nesting in it, as it were, even perhaps feeding
    off it?

    I was fairly sure Cohen had not addressed these questions in his song, but to
    be on the safe side I decided to listen to it again. Pointing out of the charabanc
    window at a flock of starlings to distract my sidekick''s attention and shut him
    up, I jammed into my ears the tiny headphones of my iLeonard and pressed "play".
    Precisely three minutes and forty-nine seconds later, I removed the headphones
    and turned to my sidekick, who was still staring out of the window, mouth open,
    dribbling, though the starlings had long vanished, and the only bird visible in
    the sky was a lone lark, or it might have been a swift or even an avocet. I know
    nothing of ornithology.

    "Cohen does not expand upon his assertion," I said, "So we shall have to poke
    about with our long pointy sticks and see what we shall see. First, though, I
    think we are both in need of refreshments, so we shall stop at the seaside kiosk
    for some tea and oranges that come all the way from China."

    My sidekick was happy with this suggestion, and he grinned. It is never a pretty
    sight, so I closed my eyes. Earlier that day I had climbed a whole mountainside
    to wash my eyelids in the rain, which had puffed me out something awful, and no
    sooner were my eyes shut than I fell into a snooze.

    When I woke the charabanc was parked in a lay-by at the seashore. I was the only
    passenger still aboard. Even my sidekick had gone. I disembarked and made my way
    to the kiosk, where I was sure I would find him stuffing his gob with Chinese
    oranges. The kiosk was bolted and shuttered, but by following a trail of spilt
    tea and strips of Chinese orange peel I soon tracked down my sidekick. He was
    squelching about in a tide pool, poking his long pointy stick into it.

    "Have you speared any heroes?" I called.

    "Nope," he replied, "Just sculpins and killifish and blennies and yellow spongefish
    and sea stars and sea cucumbers and sea urchins and sand shrimps and lobsters
    and crabs and hermit crabs and green-lined shore crabs and barnacles and nudibranchs
    and chitons and mussels and scallops and abalones and limpets and snails. Oh,
    and a sea anemone."

    "No sign at all of Orde Wingate or Captain James T Kirk, to pluck but two heroes
    at random?"

    "Nope."

    I went to sit on a slimy boulder. It occurred to me that heroes might be more
    likely to swim about in the open sea, festooned with seaweed like mermaids. We
    would have to hire a rowing-boat to extend our quest. It also occurred to me that
    it would be cheaper, and far less tiresome, to conclude that Cohen had no idea
    what he was talking about.

    "Come, sidekick," I called, "Throw away your long pointy stick and let us catch
    the charabanc home before darkness falls."

    And so we did, but we never made it home. For long before we reached the bus stop
    by the aerodrome, the charabanc driver killed the lights in a lonely lane and
    an ape with angel glands erased the final wisps of pain with the music of rubber
    bands.'
