  text: 'One consequence of my recent problems with my eyes is that I am less inclined
    to visit art galleries and exhibitions. Peering myopically at blurred canvases
    is not entirely rewarding. Spending a few days in Amsterdam, however, I felt impelled
    to visit the Rijksmuseum, and I am very pleased that I did. For it was in the
    "Golden Age" galleries that I encountered the most magnificent painting of a swan
    that I have ever seen.


    This is The Threatened Swan by Jan Asselijn, painted in 1650. As so often, the
    reproduction barely does justice to the original, which has a gleaming, translucent
    whiteness even my poor eyes found spellbinding.

    I saw many actual swans swanning around on the canals of Amsterdam, but none was
    quite as magnificent as this one.'
