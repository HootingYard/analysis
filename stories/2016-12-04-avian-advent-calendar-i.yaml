  text: 'Yes, yes, I realise I am blundering into the World o'' Advent Calendars four
    days late. Just bear in mind that my health is pitiful and I have the eyesight
    of a mole, and bear with me. What we are going to do is to jump-start the calendar
    with four postages today, and you can pretend they have appeared with rigorous
    regularity since the beginning of the month. I shall endeavour to post the rest
    of them daily until Christmas or, as John and Yoko would have it, until war is
    over.

    All these birds come from the collection of Andy Martin, tyrannical leader of
    UNIT, to whom many many thanks.
