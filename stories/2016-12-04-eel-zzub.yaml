  text: 'An occasional feature of my dreamworld is the appearance of a nonsensical
    word or phrase which--within the dream--takes on huge, if intangible, significance.
    Previous dreams have revealed to me the crucial importance of Bomba, the Glove
    of Ib, and the startling yet compelling realisation that my milieu is that of
    Dr Ludwig. All these things are of great import until I awake, at which point
    their utter stupidity becomes apparent.

    The latest manifestation occurred a few nights ago, when I was made aware of the
    ancient chivalric code of Eel Zzub. By following the precepts of Eel Zzub, I would
    become a person of great honour and probity. The fact that such precepts were
    not in any way made clear in the dream was irrelevant. Eel Zzub was the way to
    go--at least until I woke up.

    I would add two points, which may or may not be pertinent. First, it was resoundingly
    clear, in the dream, that the Eel of Eel Zzub was nothing whatsoever to do with
    eels. Second, in my waking state I could not help but recall that Zzub Books was
    a wholly fictitious publisher of slim volumes of twee verse, invented by Ed Baxter
    and listed in one of the Small Press Yearbooks circa 1990.'
