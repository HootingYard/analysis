  text: 'I am a janitor at an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. I have a bucket
    and a mop and a bunch of keys. Sometimes I carry a screwdriver or a wrench or
    a hammer. My soul glows with a tremendous, overwhelming love of Christ.

    As I patrol the corridors with my bucket and mop and keys, I often find myself
    importuned by wannabe janitors. They dart from nooks and buttonhole me, jabbering
    questions about janitordom. I display excessive, some might say inhuman, patience
    with these intemperate pleading nitwits. Only very rarely do I smite one with
    my hammer.

    It is often cold, cold, oh! bitterly cold in Winnipeg. In the factory, the radiators
    need regular bleeding. When I carry out this duty, I try to concentrate my mind
    on the blood of Christ, which was shed for me, and for all sinners, even for the
    wannabe janitors, though they know it not.

    Sometimes I have to wipe the blood of a wannabe janitor from my hammer. I use
    an old frayed much-stained rag, which I then rinse out under a spigot and peg
    up to dry. I have seen the face of Christ in this rag, many times.

    Though I have been the janitor for untold years, I have never actually tasted
    the evaporated milk made in the factory. I have a horror of semi-sweetened evaporated
    dairy products, by dint of a childhood trauma. There was a picnic in the Blue
    Forgotten Hills, and a swarm of wasps, but more than that I cannot bring myself
    to say.

    Every now and then I might come upon a wasp when patrolling the corridors. I sink
    to my knees and take out my pocket catechism and I comfort myself with the sacred
    words. Sometimes, in spite of my prayers, I am so fearful of the wasp that I piddle
    in my pants. I rinse them under the spigot and peg them up alongside the blood-soaked
    rag. I hide in a broom cupboard to conceal my semi-nakedness until my pants are
    dry. On these occasions, I usually take off the rest of my clothing, so I can
    more readily imagine myself Adam in Eden. There is a painting of a serpent on
    the wall of the broom cupboard.

    Nunc dimittis.'
