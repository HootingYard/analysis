  text: "I learn from the BBC that chickens are to be kept indoors to create a Bird-Flu-Free-Zone.\
    \ This prompts a little song we can all sing as we round up our chickens (if we\
    \ have any):\nBring in your chickens!\n  It's Indoor Poultry Week.\n  Pop your\
    \ chicken on the couch\n  And pat its little beak.\nApparently we should also\
    \ be on the lookout for dead or debilitated swans, and report any sightings to\
    \ the police."
