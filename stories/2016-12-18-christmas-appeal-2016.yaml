  text: 'This year''s Hooting Yard Christmas Appeal is for the Relief of Distressed
    Half-Blind Out Of Print Pamphleteers. We are hoping to raise about 47 New Pence,
    but more--indeed, considerably more--would aid the Relief Committee in their important
    work of keeping that confounded wolf away from Mr Key''s door.

    If you have been entertained, diverted, instructed, or otherwise had the cockles
    of your heart warmed by Hooting Yard this year, or over the past god knows how
    many years, please give generously. The "Donate" or "Subscribe" bits over to your
    right, beneath all the books, will lead you to Paypal. Feel free to empty your
    bank account should you feel strangely compelled to do so.

    All donations will be received with genuine gratitude.'
