  text: "This year's Hooting Yard Christmas Appeal is for the Relief of Distressed\
    \ Half-Blind Out Of Print Pamphleteers. We are hoping to raise about 47 New Pence,\
    \ but more\u2014indeed, considerably more\u2014would aid the Relief Committee\
    \ in their important work of keeping that confounded wolf away from Mr Key's door.\n\
    If you have been entertained, diverted, instructed, or otherwise had the cockles\
    \ of your heart warmed by Hooting Yard this year, or over the past god knows how\
    \ many years, please give generously. The \u201CDonate\u201D or \u201CSubscribe\u201D\
    \ bits over to your right, beneath all the books, will lead you to Paypal. Feel\
    \ free to empty your bank account should you feel strangely compelled to do so.\n\
    All donations will be received with genuine gratitude."
