  text: 'There are startling similarities to be found in the film characters John
    McClane in Die Hard and Ellen Ripley in Alien. In particular,

    both have formative traumatic experiences in air ducts: arguably, both heroines
    are born within the air ducts.

    Just one of many nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout "Making fists with your
    toes: Towards a feminist analysis of Die Hard", an essay by Zoe Stavri, aka Another
    Angry Woman. Make sure you read it before watching that magnificent film for the
    umpteenth time.

    Thanks to Roberta Mock for drawing this to my attention.'
