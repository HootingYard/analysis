  text: 'I am grateful to reader Theo Gott, who reminded me of this seasonal squib
    which originally appeared here six long years ago.


    The television presenter Adrian Chiles read the newspaper headline Porpoises rescue
    Dick Van Dyke and was consumed by jealousy. Ever since he was tiny, Chiles had
    hankered to feature in an exciting news story alongside sea creatures, and now
    his thunder had been stolen by the octogenarian pretend chimney-sweep! It was
    too much to bear.

    Yet, rather than turning his twisted mental havoc upon Dick Van Dyke, the West
    Bromwich Albion-supporting anchorman began to plot vengeance against the very
    sea creatures which until now had fascinated him. In his mania, he decided to
    obliterate the largest sea creature he could obtain, to obliterate it in the most
    disgusting way, by eating it. And he decided to make of his revenge a festive
    occasion, by arranging his foul dinner to take place on the day when we celebrate
    the birth of Jesus Christ.

    What demons swept through his maddened mind, to so finesse his unutterable act?
    Alas, no hint was given of his motives in the newspaper report which followed,
    in the cheaply-photocopied Weekly Cetacean News Roundup, under the headline A
    Whale''s Christmas In Chiles.'
