  text: 'One of the most fab of Boxing Day traditions is the annual gathering around
    the bottomless viper-pit at Shoeburyness. Forming a circle around the pit, and
    holding hands, the participants come dressed in motley, with trimmings of gimp
    passementerie. Eyes fixed steadily upon the viper-pit, they then recite passages
    from various works by Alain de Botton, before singing, to the accompaniment of
    bassoon and piccolo, "More Than A Feeling" by Boston. They then remain in silent
    contemplation until sunset, at which point they disperse, all except one, bent
    on self-obliteration, who is taken by the wrists and ankles and flung, voluntarily,
    into the pit.

    I attended today, as I have done for countless years past, and I am pleased to
    report that a fine time was had by all. The sole disappointment was that, as usual,
    not a single viper slithered out of the bottomless pit to grace us with its vipery
    Boxing Day presence, dammit!'
