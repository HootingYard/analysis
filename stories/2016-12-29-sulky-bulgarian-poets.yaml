  text: "Along with the Undimmed by Death postcard, I unearthed another set of six\
    \ cards from the same era. These are hand-drawn and hand-written, and collectively\
    \ titled Sulky Bulgarian Poets. Unfortunately, the drawings are cack-handed and\
    \ the \"poems\" are atrocious--with one exception. Number 5, \"In Fish And Shipping\"\
    , is attributed to sulky Bulgarian poet Elvis Targnegescubit, and, though it pre-dates\
    \ Hooting Yard, I think it is a worthy addition to the canon.\nIn despicable visions\
    \ of\n  An unholy refrigerator,\n  Another refrigerator,\n  In implacable discussions\
    \ of\n  A swordfish,\n  A carp,\n  An enormous schooner,\n  A small schooner,\n\
    \  A tiny ship, ship-ette,\n  In all these I have said,\n  Irrefutably, not once,\n\
    \  But with venom,\n  I am a very fat man."
