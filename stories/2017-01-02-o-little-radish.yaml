  text: "By popular demand, here is another verse by a sulky Bulgarian poet, written\
    \ circa 1982. This one is entitled O, Little Radish and purports to be by Fratsin\
    \ K Yecebit. (My poets\u2019 names sound Turkish rather than Bulgarian, but I\
    \ was young, so young \u2026)\nTomorrow morning we will\n  Drink vinegar\n  Here\
    \ in this trench.\n  I haven't paid\n  Any of my debts\n  And I don't intend to.\n\
    \  They can brandish guns at me\n  Or twigs.\n  I'll make my peace\n  And whip\
    \ it up with a whisk.\n  Send me your cash now.\n  Send me the lot.\n  I'm the\
    \ man you ought to\n  Shove in the vat."
