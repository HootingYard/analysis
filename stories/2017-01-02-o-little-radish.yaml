  text: "By popular demand, here is another verse by a sulky Bulgarian poet, written\
    \ circa 1982. This one is entitled O, Little Radish and purports to be by Fratsin\
    \ K Yecebit. (My poets' names sound Turkish rather than Bulgarian, but I was young,\
    \ so young ...)\nTomorrow morning we will\n  Drink vinegar\n  Here in this trench.\n\
    \  I haven't paid\n  Any of my debts\n  And I don't intend to.\n  They can brandish\
    \ guns at me\n  Or twigs.\n  I'll make my peace\n  And whip it up with a whisk.\n\
    \  Send me your cash now.\n  Send me the lot.\n  I'm the man you ought to\n  Shove\
    \ in the vat."
