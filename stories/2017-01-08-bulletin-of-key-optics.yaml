  text: "Potsages [sic] are likely to remain criminally sparse for the time being.\
    \ This is due to the state of my eyes, which make it something of a strain to\
    \ peer at a screen and attempt to tippy-tap keys with reasonable accuracy.\nFollowing\
    \ a series of fortnightly injections of a needle directly into my eyeballs, the\
    \ other day I had an assessment by the consultant, who recommended \u2026 further\
    \ injections of a needle directly into my eyeballs! So that will keep me occupied\
    \ in the coming weeks.\nI do have some ideas skittering around in my bonce, which\
    \ I shall do my best to post here if and when I am able. One such scheme is A\
    \ New Life Of Christ. I intend to remain faithful to Biblical sources, while mucking\
    \ about with nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and, why not?, plot, characters,\
    \ and setting. When Galilee moved to Shoeburyness \u2026 and lo!, the Lord did\
    \ topple into the bottomless viper-pit of that seaside place."
