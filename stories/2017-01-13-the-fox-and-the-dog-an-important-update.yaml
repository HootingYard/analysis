  text: 'Several years ago we took a long hard look at the well-known story in which
    the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. So compelling was our analysis that
    there was general agreement, in both vulpine and canine circles, and more broadly,
    that no further light could possibly be shed on the matter, at least not in our
    lifetimes.

    But lo! What is this? Writing from the fair land of Denmark, Jacob Thoegersen
    has added a comment to the original potsage [sic] which, frankly, blows the whole
    thing up a fresh spout. (I don''t think that is a common phrase, or even means
    anything, but it damned well ought to become part and parcel of our parlance,
    daddy-o.) To ensure Mr Thoegersen''s contribution does not lie neglected in the
    archives, here is his comment in full:

    I thank you for your review, my dearest Mr. Key, which I think--in broad strokes--sums
    up the most pertinent questions to students of the story, the ''pillars'' of our
    discipline.

    I think you will agree with me also that many of the factual questions you raise
    will in time be answered upon careful scrutiny of video documentation now published
    (or is that ''leaked'' one might speculate) about the incident:

    https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/C16czVIWEAADzgj.mp4.

    I advise all people to see the video and form their own opinions, but in my eyes,
    the dog appears to be standing, it is of a light brown (cappuccino?) colour, and
    the fox does indeed appear to be in a somewhat playful mood--if ''playful'' and
    ''mood'' can be properly applied to canines.

    Of more interest, perhaps, to students of the story is the new insights the video
    give about the performance of the actual jump. How many of us, for instance, had
    in our mental reproduction of the scene envisioned the fox *landing* on the dog.
    If I am not much mistaken, the photographic evidence of this occurring will spawn
    much renewed interest, will force us to rethink many interpretation we had come
    to accept as self-evident, and, we may hope, open up entirely new avenues of research
    into the psychological implications of the story.

    My personal analysis on the history of studies in the dog-and-fox story is that
    the community can be roughly divided between parabelists, historist and omenists--of
    course proposing this meta-theory will infuriate many if not all scholars in the
    field, but alas, so is my burden...:

    Parableists see the story as a parable, to be read for its symbolic and moral
    implications (far too many and multiform to mention here--not least because the
    emergence of the video, I think we all must now agree, renders the entire avenue
    of thought untenable). To parableists (or the agniostics if you prefer) it is
    irrelevant whether the event actually occurred or not; the story has very real
    social and human significance today irrespectably. Historists see the incident
    as an actual occurrence of the past; omenists, on the other hand, see it as prophetic
    vision of a future, possibly, messianic event (not unlike the less well researched
    story of the lamb lying down with the lion published in a much inferior literary
    piece of drivel whose name momentarily slips my mind but which may be familiar
    to your readers).

    The new video evidence should feed much renewed interest in the two latter schools
    of thought: Is this the final proof that the quick brown fox did indeed jump over
    the lazy dog--and when and where did this then happen..? Or is this the sign that
    Armageddon is upon us? I think we all agree that we are living in intensely interesting--what
    could be traumatizing--times. I for one shall sleep little while this new evidence
    is being scrutinized in labs and offices around the world.

    As to the implications for our field as such, I believe this could be the time
    that lay people, average Janes and average Joes around the world, realize that
    we are not, emphatically not, crackpots and monomaniacs. Our studies have very
    serious and very real implications for the future of mankind. I foresee a future
    of even more specialized journals and conferences, and perhaps even an international
    newspaper dedicated to fox-and-dog''ology. I foresee a future where any serious
    national newspaper worthy of its name will have a daily section or a weekly supplement
    on current trends and new findings on a par with their treatment of business,
    culture, weather, TV and politics. I foresee in other words, brothers and sisters,
    a future where we will receive the same media coverage as our colleagues and rivals
    in dogs-on-skateboard''ology. I have always held that an important component in
    their media flair was the constant outpouring of new photographic evidence which
    is only too eagerly lapped up (if you will excuse the pun) by newsrooms.

    These are exciting times, Mr. Key, and I trust you will follow the development
    closely in your show. You have always been a leading light in independent coverage
    of the news the people really want to know about.

    UPDATE TO THE UPDATE : Mr Thoegersen has now added a further, perhaps even more
    compelling, comment.'
