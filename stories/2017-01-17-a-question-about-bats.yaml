    me if the answer is blindingly obvious.

    What, I would like to know, is the quality inherent in the excrement expelled
    by bats that is related to human madness? I am thinking of the phrase batshit
    crazy. We do not commonly say, for example, catshit crazy or giraffeshit crazy
    or puff-addershit crazy, or at least I have not heard these phrases used at the
    sort of swish sophisticated cocktail parties I try to barge my way into. But reference
    to the droppings of bats is made frequently.

    Answers in the Comments please, unless you are batshit crazy yourself, in which
    case you would be more appropriately occupied reading something by Will Self.'
