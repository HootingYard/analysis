  text: 'Yesterday I mentioned, in passing, Will Self. This is never a good idea.
    I am reminded, however, that I really need to stamp my big black boot down and
    make something very clear. First, back in 2009, we had the question posed "Is
    Frank Key Will Self?" And now, just the other day, this:


    While I am flattered by Mr Bugs'' complimentary remarks, I am equally appalled
    to find myself compared in any way with the preposterous figure of Self. Perhaps
    the most laughable thing is the idea that he is some kind of edgy intellectual
    maverick. From his many appearances in the Grauniad and on the BBC, I think it
    is clear that he is in possession of the Middle-Class Student Wanker''s starter
    pack marked ''This is what you think''. All his opinions are predictable and orthodox.
    If there is such a thing as the "metropolitan liberal elite", he is a card-carrying
    member. For example, he believes that everyone who voted for Brexit is probably
    a racist. Such simplistic twaddle will always get you applause and whooping from
    a Question Time audience, a fairly reliable indicator of vacuous dimwittery.

    I fear, however, that I will forever be linked with the wretched Self, given that
    his one useful contribution to the world was giving Mr Key a light for his cigarette
    in the midst of a downpour in south London.'
