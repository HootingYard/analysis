  text: 'Once upon a time there was a groovy janitor. That is about all there is to
    say about him. He was groovy, and he was a janitor. Or, he was a janitor, and
    he was groovy. These two statements are not identical. We must be alert to nuance.
    Do we give more or less weight to his janitordom or to his grooviness? Much as
    we might wish to grant them equal importance, we know in our heart of hearts that
    to do so is blind idiocy. Oh come on, admit it. You are leaning, even if only
    slightly, in terms of your level of interest in this majestic piece of prose,
    towards the janitoriness or the groove.

    As a janitor, the groovy janitor was often to be found in a corridor, with a mop
    and a pail, rattling a bunch of keys, or perhaps bearing down upon a fixture or
    fitting armed with a hammer or a screwdriver or a wrench. As a person of groove,
    the groovy janitor, while so engaged, would often be snapping his fingers to the
    latest sounds from some of our top beat groups, a long but not exhaustive list
    of which has been compiled by Bernard Levin. Shall we refamiliarise ourselves
    with the roll call?

    Some [beat groups] were almost as famous, and successful, as the Beatles; some
    were known only to the most devoted aficionados. But all added to the atmosphere
    of the decade, and the isle was full of noises as never before, coming from, among
    others, the Rolling Stones, the Bee Gees, the Monkees, the Doors, the Cream, the
    Mothers of Invention, the Seekers, the Who, the Small Faces, the Pretty Things,
    the Animals, the Pink Floyd, the Scaffold, the Grateful Dead, the Tremoloes, the
    Family, the Supremes, the Holding Company, the Four Tops, the Led Zeppelin, the
    Shadows, the Exploding Galaxy, the Editors, the Fugs, the Gods, the Kinks, the
    Hermits, the Paper Dolls, the Breakaways, the Greaseband, the Casuals, the Amen
    Corner, the Big Sound, the Flirtations, the Herd, the Marbles, the Status Quo,
    the New York Public Library, the Hollies, the Foundations, the Electric Havens,
    the Four Seasons, the Bachelors, the Seychelles, the Love Affair, the Fifth Dimension,
    the Three Dog Night, the Equals, the Vagabonds, the Marmalade, the Mindbenders,
    the Moody Blues, the Mirettes, the Tuesday''s Children, the Plastic Penny, the
    Procol Harum, the Troggs, the Fruit Machine, the Union Gap, the 1910 Fruitgum
    Co., the Beach Boys, the Fairport Convention, the Vanity Fair, the Harmony Grass,
    the Aces, the Young Tradition, the Nice, the Dubliners, the Tinkers, the Fleetwood
    Mac, the Incredible String Band, the Web, the Little Free Rock, the Blodwyn Pig,
    the Liverpool Scene, the Spooky Tooth, the Third Ear, the High Tide, the Mamas
    and Papas, the Carnations, the Pacemakers, the From Genesis to Revelation, the
    O''Hara Express, the Pentangle, the Chickenshack, the Blind Faith, the Fourmost,
    the Searchers, the Four Pennies, the Bar-Kays, the Unit Four Plus Two, the Hedgehoppers
    Anonymous, the Applejacks, the Box Tops, the Edison Lighthouse, the Blood, Sweat
    and Tears, the Vibrations, and the Rada Krishna Temple.

    From this we can adduce that our groovy janitor was being groovy, and a janitor,
    in the 1960s. But that was half a century ago! He is fifty years older now, creaking,
    wrinkle-rutted, near bald and toothless, gasping weakly from a bed in a Mercy
    Home. It is no longer accurate to describe him as a janitor, for he has carried
    out no janitorial duties for twenty years at least. We can call him an ex-janitor,
    or a retired janitor. And what of his grooviness? Is he still groovy? Let us ask
    the superintendent of the Mercy Home, Mrs Pantoofle.

    "The retired janitor lying sprawled in his iron cot in Hopeless Ward? You are
    asking me if he is groovy? Define your terms, please."

    We set out for her the chief characteristics of grooviness, in alphabetical order,
    supported by illustrative diagrams we have tucked in our pocket for just such
    an eventuality.

    "I see," says Mrs Pantoofle, though as she is wearing a pair of very stylish mirror
    sunglasses we cannot be sure of the truth of this remark.

    "I would say," she continues, "Taking everything into account, that the ex-janitor
    has indeed retained his grooviness. Only the other morning, as one of the skivvies
    attended to his bedpan, she noted that he was babbling incoherently in his weak
    and reedy voice. With great presence of mind, she made a tape of his gibbering
    on the Mercy Home cassette recorder. We played it back during the staff meeting
    at lunchtime, while eating fruit. At first the tape yielded nothing intelligible,
    but when we pricked up our ears and concentrated very hard, we realised the retired
    janitor was reciting "Howl" by Allen Ginsberg. What could be groovier than that?
    It fried my wig, daddy-o!"

    The moral of this story is that, while janitordom may fade away and vanish, grooviness
    prevails. Let that be a lesson to you.'
