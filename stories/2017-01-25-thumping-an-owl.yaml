  text: "The other day I was woken from a much-needed nap by a screech. I identified\
    \ it, instantly, as the screech of a screech owl, for I am ever alert to occurrences\
    \ of an ornithological kidney. I peered out of the window and spotted the owl,\
    \ perched on a picket fence. I pranced outside, went straight towards the owl,\
    \ bunched my fist, and thumped it in what I supposed was its solar plexus. The\
    \ owl toppled from the fence, looking mightily disconcerted. As soon as it hit\
    \ the ground, it righted itself, unfurled its wings, and flew away. I watched\
    \ until it had vanished in the blue empyrean, which in truth was grey and overcast\
    \ rather than blue, but empyrean nonetheless, and then I returned indoors to resume\
    \ my nap.\nThe next day I answered a knock at the door to be confronted by a gangly\
    \ beanpole wearing some sort of peaked cap with glittering metal insignia pinned\
    \ to it.\n\u201CInterrogative\_: would you be Mr Key?\u201D he said.\n\u201CC'est\
    \ moi!\u201D I replied, foolishly, for I was in foolish spirits.\n\u201CInterrogative,\u201D\
    \ he said, again, \u201CYesterday, did you thump an owl, knocking it from its\
    \ perch?\u201D\n\u201CI did,\u201D I said, \u201CIt was a screech owl and its\
    \ screech woke me from a much-needed nap.\u201D\n\u201CInterrogative,\u201D he\
    \ said yet again, and this time I interrupted him.\n\u201CWhy do you keep saying\
    \ \u2018interrogative\u2019?\u201D\n\u201CDon't get snippy with me, Mr Key, just\
    \ answer my questions. Interrogative\_: are you aware that the thumping of owls\
    \ is in contravention of the municipal bye-laws regarding conduct towards and/or\
    \ in the presence of owls?\u201D\n\u201CWhat?\u201D I said, so he repeated himself,\
    \ so I did too, and he was about to rerepeat himself when I flicked at his face\
    \ a morsel of smokers\u2019 poptart I happened to be holding and told him to go\
    \ away. This was a mistake. He bunched his fist and thumped me in the solar plexus.\n\
    When I was able to breathe again, he helped me inside, and we sat facing each\
    \ other at the breakfast table.\n\u201CA word of advice,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    It is never a good idea to try to stymie the activities of a senior officer of\
    \ the Civic Owl Squad going about his lawful business. As you have learned. Now\
    \ let there be no more nonsense from you. I am invested with powers more draconian,\
    \ more merciless, than you could imagine in your wildest and most sweat-drenched,\
    \ pillow-gnawing nightmares.\u201D\n\u201CErk-gah\u201D was all I could say, for\
    \ I was still winded.\n\u201CNow. You have admitted to thumping an owl. I have\
    \ it down on my pocket cassette recorder. Your nap is of no concern to us, by\
    \ the way. By \u2018us\u2019 I mean myself and the screech owl you thumped. Though\
    \ not present, I can assure you that it can hear every word you say, for screech\
    \ owls are blessed with a tremendously good sense of hearing. I offer that tip\
    \ in case you were minded to say something disobliging about the owl when you\
    \ recover the power of speech. It will be listening carefully to everything you\
    \ say for several months, until, that is, you have made complete restitution for\
    \ your thumping.\u201D\n\u201CReugh?\u201D I gasped.\n\u201CPrecisely,\u201D he\
    \ said, \u201CRestitution. Every day, for the next several months, you will fill\
    \ this sack\u201D\u2014at which he whacked a large burlap sack upon the table\u2014\
    \u201Cwith insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice and small birds\
    \ such as wrens and hummingbirds. You will deliver the sack, filled to the brim\u2014\
    to the brim!\u2014every morning at six a.m. on the dot to your neighbourhood Civic\
    \ Owl Squad drop-in centre. Woe betide you if you fail to comply.\u201D\nI wondered\
    \ for a moment of what that woe might consist, but decided it was better for my\
    \ nervous equilibrium not to ask.\n\u201CThank you for your cooperation,\u201D\
    \ said the gangly beanpole, \u201CI will see myself out. And I am sure you don't\
    \ mind me helping myself to one of your smokers\u2019 poptarts.\u201D\nI did mind\u2014\
    but what could I do?\nThe next day, after filling the sack to the brim with insects,\
    \ reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice and small birds such as wrens\
    \ and hummingbirds, and delivering it to the drop-in centre, I returned home exhausted\
    \ and took a much-needed nap. I was woken by a howl. I identified it, instantly,\
    \ as the howl of a howler monkey, for I am ever alert to occurrences of a simian\
    \ kidney."
