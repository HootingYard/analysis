  text: 'The other day I was woken from a much-needed nap by a screech. I identified
    it, instantly, as the screech of a screech owl, for I am ever alert to occurrences
    of an ornithological kidney. I peered out of the window and spotted the owl, perched
    on a picket fence. I pranced outside, went straight towards the owl, bunched my
    fist, and thumped it in what I supposed was its solar plexus. The owl toppled
    from the fence, looking mightily disconcerted. As soon as it hit the ground, it
    righted itself, unfurled its wings, and flew away. I watched until it had vanished
    in the blue empyrean, which in truth was grey and overcast rather than blue, but
    empyrean nonetheless, and then I returned indoors to resume my nap.

    The next day I answered a knock at the door to be confronted by a gangly beanpole
    wearing some sort of peaked cap with glittering metal insignia pinned to it.

    "Interrogative : would you be Mr Key?" he said.

    "C''est moi!" I replied, foolishly, for I was in foolish spirits.

    "Interrogative," he said, again, "Yesterday, did you thump an owl, knocking it
    from its perch?"

    "I did," I said, "It was a screech owl and its screech woke me from a much-needed
    nap."

    "Interrogative," he said yet again, and this time I interrupted him.

    "Why do you keep saying ''interrogative''?"

    "Don''t get snippy with me, Mr Key, just answer my questions. Interrogative :
    are you aware that the thumping of owls is in contravention of the municipal bye-laws
    regarding conduct towards and/or in the presence of owls?"

    "What?" I said, so he repeated himself, so I did too, and he was about to rerepeat
    himself when I flicked at his face a morsel of smokers'' poptart I happened to
    be holding and told him to go away. This was a mistake. He bunched his fist and
    thumped me in the solar plexus.

    When I was able to breathe again, he helped me inside, and we sat facing each
    other at the breakfast table.

    "A word of advice," he said, "It is never a good idea to try to stymie the activities
    of a senior officer of the Civic Owl Squad going about his lawful business. As
    you have learned. Now let there be no more nonsense from you. I am invested with
    powers more draconian, more merciless, than you could imagine in your wildest
    and most sweat-drenched, pillow-gnawing nightmares."

    "Erk-gah" was all I could say, for I was still winded.

    "Now. You have admitted to thumping an owl. I have it down on my pocket cassette
    recorder. Your nap is of no concern to us, by the way. By ''us'' I mean myself
    and the screech owl you thumped. Though not present, I can assure you that it
    can hear every word you say, for screech owls are blessed with a tremendously
    good sense of hearing. I offer that tip in case you were minded to say something
    disobliging about the owl when you recover the power of speech. It will be listening
    carefully to everything you say for several months, until, that is, you have made
    complete restitution for your thumping."

    "Reugh?" I gasped.

    "Precisely," he said, "Restitution. Every day, for the next several months, you
    will fill this sack"--at which he whacked a large burlap sack upon the table--"with
    insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice and small birds such as
    wrens and hummingbirds. You will deliver the sack, filled to the brim--to the
    brim!--every morning at six a.m. on the dot to your neighbourhood Civic Owl Squad
    drop-in centre. Woe betide you if you fail to comply."

    I wondered for a moment of what that woe might consist, but decided it was better
    for my nervous equilibrium not to ask.

    "Thank you for your cooperation," said the gangly beanpole, "I will see myself
    out. And I am sure you don''t mind me helping myself to one of your smokers''
    poptarts."

    I did mind--but what could I do?

    The next day, after filling the sack to the brim with insects, reptiles, small
    mammals such as bats and mice and small birds such as wrens and hummingbirds,
    and delivering it to the drop-in centre, I returned home exhausted and took a
    much-needed nap. I was woken by a howl. I identified it, instantly, as the howl
    of a howler monkey, for I am ever alert to occurrences of a simian kidney.'
