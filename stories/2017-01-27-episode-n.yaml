  text: Here is yesterday's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air, which features Mr
    Key reading sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. The show is approaching its
    thirteenth anniversary, in April, and I rather regret that it never occurred to
    me (nor to anybody at Resonance) to give each episode a number. It would be pleasant
    to be able to say "This is Hooting Yard On The Air, Episode 666", or whatever
    number we have reached. I suppose there might be a frighteningly fanatical listener
    out there somewhere who has kept such a tally--if so, I hope they would get in
    touch and enlighten us all.
