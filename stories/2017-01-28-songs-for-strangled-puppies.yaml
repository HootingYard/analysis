  text: 'Songs For Strangled Puppies is a new album of sentimental ballads by tear-stained
    balladeer Biff Chomsky, a follow-up to his smash hit bestseller Songs For Drowned
    Kittens.

    "I am particularly proud of this new waxing" said Biff in an interview with top
    dead-puppy-and-kitten magazine The Daily Small Slaughtered Animals Digest, "Because
    the body count is slightly higher than on my previous album. That had only one
    or two kittens drowned per song, whereas on the new one, I sing several schmaltzy
    ballads in which upwards of a dozen puppies have the life squeezed out of them,
    in one case by the lumbering walrus-moustached serial killer Babinsky, turning
    his attention for once to the canine world."

    This is not the first time Babinsky has been celebrated in song, though earlier
    numbers have eschewed the tear-stained ballad approach. More often they have been
    hideous screechings and howlings composed by bearded grumpy avant garde German
    nitwits such as Horst Gack and Horst Gack''s familiar, a weird homunculus which
    perches on his shoulder and hisses at passers-by.

    "I was hoping to get Horst Gack''s homunculus to join me on a duet," said Biff
    Chomsky, "But when I approached him, he bit me. I immediately had a tetanus jab,
    but it didn''t do much good. Ever since I have had a fever and an ague and fits
    and convulsions and to be honest I''m not sure when I''ll be able to get back
    in the studio to record my next album, Songs For Garrotted Baby Koala Bears."

    Each copy of the new album comes with a free tin pail in which weeping listeners
    can collect their tears.'
