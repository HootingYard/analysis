  text: "Songs For Strangled Puppies is a new album of sentimental ballads by tear-stained\
    \ balladeer Biff Chomsky, a follow-up to his smash hit bestseller Songs For Drowned\
    \ Kittens.\n\u201CI am particularly proud of this new waxing\u201D said Biff in\
    \ an interview with top dead-puppy-and-kitten magazine The Daily Small Slaughtered\
    \ Animals Digest, \u201CBecause the body count is slightly higher than on my previous\
    \ album. That had only one or two kittens drowned per song, whereas on the new\
    \ one, I sing several schmaltzy ballads in which upwards of a dozen puppies have\
    \ the life squeezed out of them, in one case by the lumbering walrus-moustached\
    \ serial killer Babinsky, turning his attention for once to the canine world.\u201D\
    \nThis is not the first time Babinsky has been celebrated in song, though earlier\
    \ numbers have eschewed the tear-stained ballad approach. More often they have\
    \ been hideous screechings and howlings composed by bearded grumpy avant garde\
    \ German nitwits such as Horst Gack and Horst Gack's familiar, a weird homunculus\
    \ which perches on his shoulder and hisses at passers-by.\n\u201CI was hoping\
    \ to get Horst Gack's homunculus to join me on a duet,\u201D said Biff Chomsky,\
    \ \u201CBut when I approached him, he bit me. I immediately had a tetanus jab,\
    \ but it didn't do much good. Ever since I have had a fever and an ague and fits\
    \ and convulsions and to be honest I'm not sure when I'll be able to get back\
    \ in the studio to record my next album, Songs For Garrotted Baby Koala Bears.\u201D\
    \nEach copy of the new album comes with a free tin pail in which weeping listeners\
    \ can collect their tears."
