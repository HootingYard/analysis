  text: 'In my experience, it is not often you get a crow for Christmas. Indeed, until
    last month, I don''t think I had been given a crow on any festive occasion. Naturally,
    I was duly awestruck when, on Christmas Day just past, I unwrapped from its packaging
    a splendid crow. I named it Tippi (of course) and, rather belatedly, here is a
    snap:


    I am hoping that in future Tippi will be making corvine contributions to Hooting
    Yard. However, given that it is a mute, plastic crow, these may be few and far
    between.'
