  text: 'Horst Gack''s eerie familiar, a homunculus perched on his shoulder which
    hissed at passers-by and bit those who came too close, has long been a source
    of fascination for a handful of nitwits with nothing better to fill their time.
    It is now the subject of a magisterial new biography, Die Homunculus-vertraut
    von Gack, the result of several hours of slapdash research by Teutonic potboilerist
    Shaka Kieselkopf, a second or possibly third cousin of our own dear Pebblehead.

    From the book, we learn some startling facts--if, of course, we can read German.
    If we cannot, and absent a translation, we would be better advised to use it as
    a door-stop, or to hold down the corner of a tarpaulin in a gale.

    One of the less startling things we learn is that the familiar was created using
    the standard Paracelsian recipe. Paracelsus (1493-1541), real name Philippus Aureolus
    Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, made the first known homunculus from a bag
    of bones, skin fragments, sperm, and animal hair. He placed these ingredients
    in the ground, surrounded by horse manure, for forty days, after which the embryo
    sprang into being. Horst Gack would appear to have followed this precisely, with
    the addition of some lupins and half a choc-ice.

    Interestingly, we discover that the homunculus was absolutely identical to its
    maker in all respects save its size. It was a miniature Horst Gack, down to its
    stylish Louis Brilliantine suit, trendy winkle-pickers, and fantastic bouffant,
    based, as was Horst Gack''s, on The Great Wave at Kanagawa by Hokusai. Its temperament,
    mien, and behaviour were also of a piece with Gack''s, particularly the hissing
    and biting.

    The only thing the homunculus seemed unable to do was to conduct huge ensembles
    in recitals of godawful semi-improvised avant-garde racket, though not for want
    of trying. Kieselkopf tells an enchanting anecdote of the homunculus trying to
    teach various flies, midges, gnats, and bluebottles to play the theremin, piccolo,
    xylophone, and tuba, without success. The sessions were recorded, however, and
    I think the publishers ought to have included a CD of the surviving tape. It would
    have made for a more rounded portrait of Horst Gack''s familiar.

    One question which the biography does not address is why the homunculus was forever
    perched on Horst Gack''s shoulder. It was a fully functioning tiny creature, and
    could quite easily have scampered off and made its own way in the world. Yet it
    preferred always to remain as if glued to its maker, hissing at him and biting
    him when there was nobody else in the vicinity to torment.

    The missing voice in all this, of course, is that of Horst Gack himself, who apparently
    tried to block the book''s publication. The grounds cited in his legal case included
    a claim that the biography "lacked Gack" and was thus "dippy, ploppy, and poopy".
    The finest legal minds in Germany are still considering the matter, which experts
    say may not be resolved until some time in the next century. In the meantime,
    an illegal pirated edition of the book is in circulation, and has sold upwards
    of eight copies.

    It should be noted that I do not read German, and there may be wild and unforgivable
    inaccuracies in the foregoing.'
