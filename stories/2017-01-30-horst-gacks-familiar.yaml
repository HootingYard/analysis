  text: "Horst Gack's eerie familiar, a homunculus perched on his shoulder which hissed\
    \ at passers-by and bit those who came too close, has long been a source of fascination\
    \ for a handful of nitwits with nothing better to fill their time. It is now the\
    \ subject of a magisterial new biography, Die Homunculus-vertraut von Gack, the\
    \ result of several hours of slapdash research by Teutonic potboilerist Shaka\
    \ Kieselkopf, a second or possibly third cousin of our own dear Pebblehead.\n\
    From the book, we learn some startling facts\u2014if, of course, we can read German.\
    \ If we cannot, and absent a translation, we would be better advised to use it\
    \ as a door-stop, or to hold down the corner of a tarpaulin in a gale.\nOne of\
    \ the less startling things we learn is that the familiar was created using the\
    \ standard Paracelsian recipe. Paracelsus (1493\u20131541), real name Philippus\
    \ Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, made the first known homunculus\
    \ from a bag of bones, skin fragments, sperm, and animal hair. He placed these\
    \ ingredients in the ground, surrounded by horse manure, for forty days, after\
    \ which the embryo sprang into being. Horst Gack would appear to have followed\
    \ this precisely, with the addition of some lupins and half a choc-ice.\nInterestingly,\
    \ we discover that the homunculus was absolutely identical to its maker in all\
    \ respects save its size. It was a miniature Horst Gack, down to its stylish Louis\
    \ Brilliantine suit, trendy winkle-pickers, and fantastic bouffant, based, as\
    \ was Horst Gack's, on The Great Wave at Kanagawa by Hokusai. Its temperament,\
    \ mien, and behaviour were also of a piece with Gack's, particularly the hissing\
    \ and biting.\nThe only thing the homunculus seemed unable to do was to conduct\
    \ huge ensembles in recitals of godawful semi-improvised avant-garde racket, though\
    \ not for want of trying. Kieselkopf tells an enchanting anecdote of the homunculus\
    \ trying to teach various flies, midges, gnats, and bluebottles to play the theremin,\
    \ piccolo, xylophone, and tuba, without success. The sessions were recorded, however,\
    \ and I think the publishers ought to have included a CD of the surviving tape.\
    \ It would have made for a more rounded portrait of Horst Gack's familiar.\nOne\
    \ question which the biography does not address is why the homunculus was forever\
    \ perched on Horst Gack's shoulder. It was a fully functioning tiny creature,\
    \ and could quite easily have scampered off and made its own way in the world.\
    \ Yet it preferred always to remain as if glued to its maker, hissing at him and\
    \ biting him when there was nobody else in the vicinity to torment.\nThe missing\
    \ voice in all this, of course, is that of Horst Gack himself, who apparently\
    \ tried to block the book's publication. The grounds cited in his legal case included\
    \ a claim that the biography \u201Clacked Gack\u201D and was thus \u201Cdippy,\
    \ ploppy, and poopy\u201D. The finest legal minds in Germany are still considering\
    \ the matter, which experts say may not be resolved until some time in the next\
    \ century. In the meantime, an illegal pirated edition of the book is in circulation,\
    \ and has sold upwards of eight copies.\nIt should be noted that I do not read\
    \ German, and there may be wild and unforgivable inaccuracies in the foregoing."
