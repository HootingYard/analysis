  text: 'Occasionally I like to make note here of mentions of Hooting Yard from elsewhere
    in Interwebshire. I see this as a boon to scholars in years to come, who will
    not have to look quite so hard for references when compiling the fat magnificent
    doorstoppers devoted to Mr Key with which bookshelves of the future will surely
    teem.

    Anyway, here is the view of Rachael K. Jones:

    Frank Key is an odd, odd author.'
