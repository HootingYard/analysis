  text: 'The other day I mentioned Biff Chomsky''s chart-topping album of sentimental
    ballads entitled Songs For Drowned Kittens.

    By curious coincidence, yesterday I listened, for the first time in God knows
    how many years, to One Lonely Night. This is a "Cold War operetta" by The Massed
    Ranks Of The Proletariat, adapted from the novel by Mickey Spillane. The lyrics
    are by Ed Baxter. It was released as a severely-limited edition cassette tape
    in (I think) 1990.

    Anyway, have a listen to Mike''s death-wish songand you will understand why I
    was struck by a spooky sense of connection to the past.'
