  text: "The other day I mentioned Biff Chomsky's chart-topping album of sentimental\
    \ ballads entitled Songs For Drowned Kittens.\nBy curious coincidence, yesterday\
    \ I listened, for the first time in God knows how many years, to One Lonely Night.\
    \ This is a \u201CCold War operetta\u201D by The Massed Ranks Of The Proletariat,\
    \ adapted from the novel by Mickey Spillane. The lyrics are by Ed Baxter. It was\
    \ released as a severely-limited edition cassette tape in (I think) 1990.\nAnyway,\
    \ have a listen to Mike's death-wish songand you will understand why I was struck\
    \ by a spooky sense of connection to the past."
