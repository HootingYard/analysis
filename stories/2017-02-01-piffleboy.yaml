  text: 'Modern cinema is in a sorry state. Increasingly, it seems Hollywood is only
    interested in witless superhero franchises, so the same film is recycled time
    and time again, with ever diminishing returns. These are films for adolescents,
    not adults, and such basic elements as plot, character, and genuine drama are
    sacrificed in the interests of mere spectacle. Why bother with, say, snappy dialogue
    when the audience will be happy with an endless series of big noisy explosions?

    Which makes it all the more puzzling that Hollywood has thus far neglected the
    one superhero who I would love to see depicted on the big screen. I am talking,
    of course, of Piffleboy. Piffleboy was the creation of maverick comic-book genius
    Lars Talc, and his adventures were recounted, between March and July 1974, in
    the pages of the now extremely rare Piffleboy! comic.

    Set in a generic American metropolis, the stories tell of a young mild-mannered
    milksop who is passionately devoted to his button collection. Yet he has a secret
    life as a crime-fighter, righting wrongs, taking out the hoodlums, and keeping
    the city streets safe. He does this by using his superpower, with which he was
    imbued following a bizarre chemical reaction caused by some of the buttons in
    his collection being dropped in a puddle.

    Piffleboy''s superpower is an ability to spout absolute piffle, extempore and
    at length, which drives those listening crackers, leaving them confused and befuddled,
    like decapitated chickens. In a typical adventure, Piffleboy will be sitting at
    home with his buttons when he receives an alert on his Pifflephone, telling him
    that ne''er-do-wells are bent on villainy somewhere in the city. Immediately,
    Piffleboy minces to the scene, and starts babbling utter piffle. The evil miscreants
    are soon reduced to a state of discombobulation, whereupon the coppers arrive
    and drag them, unprotesting, off to prison.

    Each episode ends with the captain of detectives saying "Gee, thanks Piffleboy!
    If it weren''t for you we''d never have rounded up these hoods and made the city
    safe again!" to which Piffleboy replies "Glad to be of service, captain. Now I
    must get back to my buttons".

    Devoted fans of Piffleboy memorise long passages of his most piffling piffle and
    meet at conventions where they recite it to each other in loud yet curiously weedy
    voices.

    Lars Talc was taught by the noted hyperrealist artist Rex Hyper, and not the least
    of the charms of the Piffleboy! comics are his hyperrealist illustrations, one
    of which is reproduced below. This shows Piffleboy in the immediate aftermath
    of the famous episode in which he foils the criminal schemes of bootlegger Slugger
    McGrew and his gang by wittering piffle at them for several hours until the tardy
    cops eventually show up.
