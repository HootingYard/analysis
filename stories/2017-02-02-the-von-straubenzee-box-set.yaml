  text: 'Lost trinket in ditch. Sky the colour of blubber. Elves darting from elm
    to elm. Time for pancakes. First, obtain a pan. Not the Great God Pan. He has
    other fish to fry. There are no fish in the ditch. It is a dry ditch, not a drainage
    ditch. Ah, drainage! The Great God Pan is wearing drainpipe trousers. It is his
    new look. He is standing next to a real drainpipe. The blubbery sky threatens
    rain. It will send water pouring down the drainpipe. Across the road, a clairvoyant
    is driving pigs to market.

    The trinket is a pig-shaped trinket. It belonged to one of the elves. The selves
    of elves are unreadable. They keep their distance. They laugh in the face of death.
    They keep their chins up. One elf has warts on his shins. They require ointment.
    That''s right, oint.

    You can oint elvish shins with all manner of goo. Come get your goo, elf! It will
    cost a pretty penny. Or in exchange for a trinket. Maps and atlases chocker with
    elms. Elves unseen, because unreported by mappers. Soup and bridles. Bridles and
    soup. Odd sound of egg on wafer. The Great God Pan is riding pillion.

    Egg? Wafer? Morse code for both. What hath the Great God Pan wrought? Better drainage
    under blubber. It is no mean feat. Cox in boat with hacking cough. Given a lozenge.
    Given shrikes. Blue boat on Blubber Island Lake. Towelled down on Thursdays. To
    the sound of Petula Clark. Elves'' eggs. Oh such yolks as unseen for centuries
    past!

    Dim, dim, dim. Boisterous blips. Devil take the blue tail fly. These are the words
    of Piffleboy.'
