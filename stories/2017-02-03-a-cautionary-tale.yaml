  text: "I bashed my bonce upon a shelf, dislodging from it a tiny elf. It toppled\
    \ down on to the floor and scampered out through my front door. I followed it\
    \ as best I could, all the way into a wood. The wood was mostly larch and lime,\
    \ and the elf was bent on an awful crime. I watched as it picked a woodcutter's\
    \ pocket. As it ran away I tried to block it. Then I saw its face, the hideous\
    \ elf. It looked uncannily like Will Self. I fainted away in shock and fright,\
    \ and when I awoke it was deepest night. The woodcutter led me to a glade and\
    \ gave me tea and marmalade. I spooned it straight out from the jar, then we got\
    \ into the woodcutter's car and drove around in the pitch dark, thinking it would\
    \ be a lark. But it was not\u2014for we came a-cropper, and were arrested by a\
    \ copper. He took us to the local nick, where I began to feel quite sick. Locked\
    \ in a cell, I bewailed my fate. Then the elf came in, fair oozing hate. He bashed\
    \ me on my bonce again, and then he turned into a hen. Not any hen\u2014one with\
    \ no head. And then I woke up in my bed. It had all been a terrible dream occasioned\
    \ by too much ice cream. So, tinies, make sure you behave yourselves, or you'll\
    \ be beset by hens and elves, by a headless hen, and a terrible elf who looks\
    \ exactly like Will Self."
