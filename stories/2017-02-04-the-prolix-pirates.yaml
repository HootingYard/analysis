  text: "Shiver me timbers!\nShiver = quake with cold or fear.\nMe = the being that\
    \ is my self.\nTimbers = planks of wood cut to shape from trees.\nThus the prolix\
    \ pirate would shout \u201CQuake with cold and fear the being that is myself planks\
    \ of wood cut to shape from trees!\u201D\nBut the prolix pirate was what is known,\
    \ in the technical jargon, as an unlettered matelot, and so his prolixity was\
    \ improvised, off the top of his head. His shipmate, the even more prolix pirate,\
    \ was armed with a battered old copy of the Oxford English Dictionary. He would\
    \ shout \u201CTremble, shake, quiver; esp. to tremble with cold or fear the objective\
    \ case of the first person pronoun I reproducing the Old English accusative and\
    \ dative wood used for the building of houses, ships, etc., or for the use of\
    \ the carpenter, joiner, or other artisan; wood in general as a material; esp.\
    \ after it has been suitably trimmed and squared into logs, or further adapted\
    \ to constructive uses!\u201D\nYou can follow the adventures of the prolix pirates\
    \ every week in the children's comic The Ipsy Dipsy Doo (Prolix Edition), available\
    \ from all good dealers in newspapers and periodicals, esp. the owners of shops\
    \ where these are sold; (now also) the shop itself, usually also selling tobacco,\
    \ confectionery, etc."
