  text: The sea, the sea, vast wet expanse! I sailed upon it with Captain Hans. Hans
    was German. He could not swim. He was stricken with a withered limb. An arm or
    a leg, I remember not. Memories make my brain grow hot. I live in the present,
    by the shore. I live outwith the rule of law. My only rules are those of the sea.
    Vast wet expanse! Come splish-splosh me!
