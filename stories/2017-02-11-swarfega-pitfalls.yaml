  text: 'Many and various are the pitfalls one can face when using swarfega. You don''t
    need me to tell you that, but I''m going to anyway. I shall show you how to anticipate
    the common pitfalls, how to sidestep them with a certain elegance, and, where
    the pitfalls are gaping chasms that cannot be avoided, how to emerge from them
    more or less unscathed. As I say, you probably know all this already, but that
    won''t stop me from telling you, if I have time.

    First, though, there is something else I needs must address. When I have given
    this talk on previous occasions, whether in village halls or in windswept marquees,
    there are always one or two people in the audience who think the subject of my
    talk is Swarfegapit Falls, a putative cataract of tumbling water akin to, say,
    Niagara or Victoria Falls.

    Often I might be half-way through my talk, or even close to its end, when someone
    in the audience will pipe up with a complaint. These nitwits can become quite
    hot of head. One fellow insisted on brandishing at me a fat book called, I think,
    A Gazetteer Of The World''s Wettest Waterfalls, holding it open and jabbing his
    finger repeatedly at what he claimed was a colour plate of a mezzotint of Swarfegapit
    Falls. Another such ninny held aloft a marmalade jar, emptied of marmalade and
    now containing water, water which, he shouted, he had personally collected, perilously,
    from the seething roiling churning sloshing foot of Swarfegapit Falls.

    I usually deal with these interruptions by calmly pointing out that there is no
    such waterfall, and politely suggesting that my hecklers pay closer attention
    to the typography in my publicity material. This rarely satisfies them. For example,
    the gazetteer-wielder leaped on to the stage and began thumping me with the gazetteer,
    and the marmalade jar man similarly leaped on to the stage, unscrewed the lid
    from the jar, and poured the contents over my head, quite ruining my majestic
    bouffant.

    The point I am trying to make is that while there are pitfalls to be faced when
    using swarfega, equally, if not more so, there are pitfalls to be faced when simply
    talking about the pitfalls to be faced when using swarfega. These latter pitfalls
    can be more alarming. In all my years of using swarfega, for example, I cannot
    recall a single occasion when, having prised the lid off the tin and being ready
    to dip my hand into the squelchy cleansing agent, I have been set upon by a nincompoop
    either bashing me with a gazetteer or pouring a jar of water over my head. It
    is true that several times my majestic bouffant has been ruined in swarfega-related
    circumstances, but I must admit this has almost always been my own fault, by absent-mindedly
    preening my bouffant just moments after getting my hands covered in swarfega.

    Given the number of times my talks are interrupted by people demanding their money
    back because I am not talking about a waterfall, whether or not they physically
    attack me, it has crossed my mind that perhaps there actually exists a tumbling
    cataract called Swarfegapit Falls somewhere in the wide world. I have thus employed
    a gaggle of unpaid interns to fan out across the globe in search of it. They regularly
    report back to me on their progress. To date, none has found convincing evidence
    of a waterfall so named. More worryingly, one by one, my keen and perky interns
    fall silent, so that I have had to engage a second set of interns to fan out across
    the globe to track down the original gaggle. The reports I receive from the second
    lot make for sobering reading. It appears that, in traipsing through far-flung
    places in search of Swarfegapit Falls, each of the pioneer group has fallen into
    a pit. So cavernous are these pits, near waterfalls, that none has ever emerged.
    They may even have fallen into bottomless pits, riddled with subterranean vipers,
    like the one at Shoeburyness. Such are the pitfalls of unpaid internship with
    a lecturer giving talks on the pitfalls faced when using swarfega.

    They can''t say I didn''t warn them. "There may be pitfalls," I announced, breezily,
    for I always like to make my announcements breezily. But even I had no idea how
    many perilous pits there were in the vicinity of waterfalls. It has come as something
    of a surprise. The next surprise I am waiting for is when, or if, one of my interns
    manages to avoid the pitfall of falling into a pit and reports back to me the
    startling news that, yes, the ninnies and nincompoops were right all along, and
    there is in fact a waterfall called Swarfegapit Falls.

    Should that day come, I will have no option but to tear up the text of my lecture
    and start all over again. I will announce, breezily:

    Many and various are the pitfalls one can face when using swarfega. You don''t
    need me to tell you that, so I won''t. Instead, I will tell you about the pitfalls
    one can face when searching the globe for that mighty tumbling cataract, Swarfegapit
    Falls.'
