  text: 'Q--Dear Mr Key, I read with great interest your piece on swarfega pitfalls.
    I myself have often experienced swarfega pratfalls. I think it would be very helpful
    for your readers if you could provide a clear, comprehensive, and slightly hysterical
    explanatory string of paragraphs on the differences between pitfalls and pratfalls.
    Should you require my assistance in this matter, I am available for interview
    at the corner table in Old Ma Popsicle''s Tea Shoppe every day between the crack
    of dawn and the engulfing shroud of pitch black starless night.

    A--My correspondent is deluded in thinking there is such a thing as a swarfega
    pratfall. He or she is obviously confusing the phrase with Swarfegaprat Falls,
    a mighty cataract of tumbling water which can be found on the outskirts of Pointy
    Town. (Turn left by the cement statue of Hattie Jacques and keep going until you
    hear the roar and slosh of a mighty cataract of tumbling water.)'
