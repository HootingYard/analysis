  text: 'Tiptop pop group the Tiptop Toofles have released a new single which is steaming
    towards the top of the charts. "My Monkey Has An Ague" is a sprightly yet forlorn
    ballad telling of the lead singer''s pet monkey, Alan, being hospitalised in a
    monkey hospital after contracting an ague. It is an odd sort of monkey hospital.
    The lyrics make explicit that it is closely based on the hospital in a Carry On
    film, so there are name-checks for Kenneth Williams as a doctor, Hattie Jacques
    as Matron, and Charles Hawtrey as a weedy patient, languishing in the bed next
    to the monkey''s. So vivid is the picture painted by the words, though, that we
    accept it and trust to its verisimilitude, even though, if we give it a moment''s
    sober thought, it is piffle.

    As with all Tiptop Toofles tracks, it''s a toe-tapper, while at the same time
    being emotionally devastating. For those who have not yet heard it, I will not
    spoil the song by giving away its ending. All I will say is that, in the final
    verse, the scene changes from the monkey hospital to a monkey graveyard.

    The B side of the single is more smoochy than toe-tappy. "Apparent rari nantes
    in gurgite vasto" features the sampled voices of both Hattie Jacques and Charles
    Hawtrey--though not Kenneth Williams--and is scored, unusually for the Tiptop
    Toofles, or indeed for any other pop group, for Wurlitzer organ, piccolo, and
    Brazil nuts. At eleven and a half minutes, it is by far the longest track the
    group has ever released, and it is fair to say that it outstays its welcome by
    a good ten minutes or so. This has not deterred top pop critic Ted Popcrit from
    hailing it as "the smoochiest B side ever committed to wax cylinder recording
    technology that I have heard since yesterday afternoon". Maddeningly, but characteristically,
    Ted does not divulge what he was listening to yesterday afternoon, so I rang him
    up to ask.

    "Hello?" I said, "Is that Ted Popcrit?"

    But in reply all I heard was a Lovecraftian bubbling sound of "Glub .... glub
    ... glub". I surmised that Ted must be listening to the Tiptop Toofles'' previous
    chart-topper, the sprightly yet forlorn smoochy toe-tapper "Disgusting Seaside
    Resort". Pop fans will know that this smash hit features the sampled voices of
    Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson, and that tremendous chorus "the pollarded willows
    by the canal just before the level crossing", so startling because it has nothing
    whatsoever to do with seaside resorts.

    If you would like to join the Tiptop Toofles Fan Club, you are strongly advised
    to consult a qualified medical practitioner, or a man of the cloth, whichever
    suits your pocket.'
