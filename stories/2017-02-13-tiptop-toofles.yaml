  text: "Tiptop pop group the Tiptop Toofles have released a new single which is steaming\
    \ towards the top of the charts. \u201CMy Monkey Has An Ague\u201D is a sprightly\
    \ yet forlorn ballad telling of the lead singer's pet monkey, Alan, being hospitalised\
    \ in a monkey hospital after contracting an ague. It is an odd sort of monkey\
    \ hospital. The lyrics make explicit that it is closely based on the hospital\
    \ in a Carry On film, so there are name-checks for Kenneth Williams as a doctor,\
    \ Hattie Jacques as Matron, and Charles Hawtrey as a weedy patient, languishing\
    \ in the bed next to the monkey's. So vivid is the picture painted by the words,\
    \ though, that we accept it and trust to its verisimilitude, even though, if we\
    \ give it a moment's sober thought, it is piffle.\nAs with all Tiptop Toofles\
    \ tracks, it's a toe-tapper, while at the same time being emotionally devastating.\
    \ For those who have not yet heard it, I will not spoil the song by giving away\
    \ its ending. All I will say is that, in the final verse, the scene changes from\
    \ the monkey hospital to a monkey graveyard.\nThe B side of the single is more\
    \ smoochy than toe-tappy. \u201CApparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto\u201D features\
    \ the sampled voices of both Hattie Jacques and Charles Hawtrey\u2014though not\
    \ Kenneth Williams\u2014and is scored, unusually for the Tiptop Toofles, or indeed\
    \ for any other pop group, for Wurlitzer organ, piccolo, and Brazil nuts. At eleven\
    \ and a half minutes, it is by far the longest track the group has ever released,\
    \ and it is fair to say that it outstays its welcome by a good ten minutes or\
    \ so. This has not deterred top pop critic Ted Popcrit from hailing it as \u201C\
    the smoochiest B side ever committed to wax cylinder recording technology that\
    \ I have heard since yesterday afternoon\u201D. Maddeningly, but characteristically,\
    \ Ted does not divulge what he was listening to yesterday afternoon, so I rang\
    \ him up to ask.\n\u201CHello?\u201D I said, \u201CIs that Ted Popcrit?\u201D\n\
    But in reply all I heard was a Lovecraftian bubbling sound of \u201CGlub \u2026\
    . glub \u2026 glub\u201D. I surmised that Ted must be listening to the Tiptop\
    \ Toofles\u2019 previous chart-topper, the sprightly yet forlorn smoochy toe-tapper\
    \ \u201CDisgusting Seaside Resort\u201D. Pop fans will know that this smash hit\
    \ features the sampled voices of Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson, and that tremendous\
    \ chorus \u201Cthe pollarded willows by the canal just before the level crossing\u201D\
    , so startling because it has nothing whatsoever to do with seaside resorts.\n\
    If you would like to join the Tiptop Toofles Fan Club, you are strongly advised\
    \ to consult a qualified medical practitioner, or a man of the cloth, whichever\
    \ suits your pocket."
