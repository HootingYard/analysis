  text: 'May I remind you that this week is fundraising week at Resonance 104.4FM?
    The finest radio station in the known universe, and indeed in several parallel
    universes, urgently needs at least part of the contents of your bank account,
    plus any loose change you have scattered about your hovel. If you wish to continue
    listening to Hooting Yard On The Air, and plenty of other tremendous programmes,
    then please give generously.

    Go to the Resonance fundraiser page for more details, or head directly to the
    donation zone. You know you will feel a warm glow in your collywobbles when you
    have done so.'
