  text: 'Hurrah! I am clearly not alone in my loathing of Twitter. It seems to me
    thoroughly corrosive, of both journalism and public debate more broadly. But we
    cannot now uninvent it, so a way must be found to turn people away from it, and
    steer them towards a more elevated form of social network communication.

    Three cheers, then, for Twitsum Twatsum, a new platform launched yesterday. This
    allows users to couch their every banal waking thought in the form of lengthy
    disquisitions in Latin, peppered with classical quotations and abstruse scholarly
    bagatelles. The minimum length of a so-called "Tweetum" is ten thousand words,
    and if a user attempts to insert one of those wretched "emoticon" horrors, the
    software is designed to cause their device (phone, tablet, etc.) to explode with
    a loud bang!, shattering it to smithereens.

    I feel sure that millions around the world, who are currently destroying what
    is left of our civilisation by their endless Twittering, will embrace this splendid
    new service. I have already posted my first Tweetum, a crushingly tedious comment
    on what I had for breakfast made uncrushingly untedious by dint of its inordinate
    length, finely-wrought Latin prose, and quotations from Catullus.'
