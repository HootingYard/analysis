  text: 'Exterior, the gate of the Wasp Zoo.

    Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo : Halt! Who goes there?

    Voice Offstage : I am Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs.

    Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo : You may pass.

    Enter Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs. He is dressed in cardboard boxes save for
    his hat, which is made of birds.

    Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs : Have you heard the news from Chappaquiddick?

    Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo : Yes. Poor Mary Jo Kopechne.

    Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs : This is a very bijou wasp zoo.

    Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo : It is. But now I have no further words, and
    nor do you, for there is a fatal flaw in this little drama, viz. its incoherence.
    Now we must simply stand here on stage, silently, for several hours, until such
    time as your hat-birds fly, fly away.

    Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs : But they are not living birds. They are stone
    dead and taxidermised.

    Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo : Did you not hear what I said? Hush ye! Hush
    ye!

    Several hours pass, until the audience bursts into thunderous applause.'
