  text: "Exterior, the gate of the Wasp Zoo.\nSentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo\_\
    : Halt! Who goes there?\nVoice Offstage\_: I am Perkins, Bringer Of Mothballs.\n\
    Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo\_: You may pass.\nEnter Perkins, Bringer Of\
    \ Mothballs. He is dressed in cardboard boxes save for his hat, which is made\
    \ of birds.\nPerkins, Bringer Of Mothballs\_: Have you heard the news from Chappaquiddick?\n\
    Sentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo : Yes. Poor Mary Jo Kopechne.\nPerkins, Bringer\
    \ Of Mothballs\_: This is a very bijou wasp zoo.\nSentry At The Gate Of The Wasp\
    \ Zoo\_: It is. But now I have no further words, and nor do you, for there is\
    \ a fatal flaw in this little drama, viz. its incoherence. Now we must simply\
    \ stand here on stage, silently, for several hours, until such time as your hat-birds\
    \ fly, fly away.\nPerkins, Bringer Of Mothballs\_: But they are not living birds.\
    \ They are stone dead and taxidermised.\nSentry At The Gate Of The Wasp Zoo\_\
    : Did you not hear what I said? Hush ye! Hush ye!\nSeveral hours pass, until the\
    \ audience bursts into thunderous applause."
