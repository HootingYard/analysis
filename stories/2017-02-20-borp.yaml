  text: "I stumbled upon Borp shortly after Himmelfarb. It was my good fortune to\
    \ have an emotional cushion. I had prayed for a pillow, but I got a cushion, so\
    \ I could not complain. There was old black and white footage of Lasse Viren on\
    \ the box. I thought I spotted Borp behind the box. This was not something I expected,\
    \ and it caused those tremors I thought had gone forever, like the Gurglings.\n\
    There were Gurglings now, but they seemed to come from Borp. I was minded to take\
    \ a closer look, but a little voice in my head urged caution. Lasse Viren continued\
    \ to pound along the track, like a nonfiction Bobnit Tivol. I turned the sound\
    \ down, the better to hear Borp. There were definite Gurglings.\nInterrupted by\
    \ a whistling kettle, I decamped to the kitchen. Well, I ought properly say kitchenette,\
    \ if not kitchenettette. It was tiny. The kettle was correspondingly tiny too.\
    \ But the whistle! It was so loud that it drowned out the Gurglings. This was\
    \ a small mercy, and I was reluctant to remove the kettle from the hob. Had I\
    \ tried to do so, it would in any case have been held fast by the hobgoblins.\n\
    I had been trying to eradicate these from my kitchenettette since before Himmelfarb.\
    \ There was a spray, but it did little good. On the advice of Baines I fashioned\
    \ a crucifix from stalks of rhubarb and suspended it from a rafter with a chain.\
    \ Nobody told me Baines was a cretin.\nI whirled about in the kitchenettette trying\
    \ to work out what to do next. Outside, a crow landed on the lawn. Then another,\
    \ and another. Soon there were so many crows I could no longer see the grass.\
    \ I felt sure this had somehow been contrived by Borp, even if I had absolutely\
    \ no idea how or why. I tried to concentrate my mind on Himmelfarb.\nI summoned\
    \ up what faint courage I had and returned to the parlour to peek behind the box.\
    \ Lasse Viren had vanished from the box, to be replaced by Emil Zatopek, who was\
    \ running in a different direction. He looked like a man wrestling with an octopus\
    \ on a conveyor belt. I know that is not an original observation, but it had never\
    \ seemed more true. I gawped and almost forgot about Borp. But then the sound\
    \ of the Gurglings snapped me back to the present. What use were athletics to\
    \ me now?\nThen another question forced itself into my brain. Why were the crows\
    \ on the lawn silent? Should they not have been cawing? That is two questions.\
    \ It is no surprise that I dithered. I had dithered on Himmelfarb, had I not?,\
    \ and look where my dithering got me. Beset by kitchenettette hobgoblins, and\
    \ with only a useless spray and a rhubarb crucifix to counter them! Baines would\
    \ be made to pay, in his cretins\u2019 coinage.\nI was ready to throw in the towel.\
    \ That is of course a reference to the boxing ring. Lasse and Emil were strangers\
    \ to it, it was a different kind of box they were on. Was Borp behind it? I had\
    \ to know. But I also needed that towel, just in case. And I realised I had clean\
    \ forgotten where the airing cupboard was. I slumped in a chair and picked up\
    \ my album. It would have to serve as my emotional cushion for the time being.\
    \ I opened the album at a random page, and I gazed, and gazed and gazed, for hours,\
    \ until becalmed, at a photograph of Rasmus Tholstrup the cheesemaker, with his\
    \ wife and infant son.\n"
