    \ Ms Ono's birthday, so I have yanked it out and place it here for your edification:\n\
    Frank, inspired by your call to arms, I immediately wrote and staged a three-hour\
    \ chirpy Cockney knees-up musical based upon the lives of our two multi-millionaire\
    \ heroes, entitled \u201CJohn & Yoko\u2014I Should Coco,\u201D in which the whole\
    \ cast and audience bring the Grade 2-listed house down with a rousing final chorus\
    \ of \u201CYes! Imagine We Have No Bananas, I Wonder If You Can?\u201D\n"
