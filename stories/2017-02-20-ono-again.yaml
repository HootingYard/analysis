  text: 'I would not wish readers to miss a comment posted by Max Decharne on Ms Ono''s
    birthday, so I have yanked it out and place it here for your edification:

    Frank, inspired by your call to arms, I immediately wrote and staged a three-hour
    chirpy Cockney knees-up musical based upon the lives of our two multi-millionaire
    heroes, entitled "John & Yoko--I Should Coco," in which the whole cast and audience
    bring the Grade 2-listed house down with a rousing final chorus of "Yes! Imagine
    We Have No Bananas, I Wonder If You Can?"
