  text: "Should you need to placate a squalling infant, here--reposted from several\
    \ years ago--is a handy quartet of incey-winceys.\nIncey-wincey badger, scrubbling\
    \ in the dirt\n  Puts some sticks together and builds himself a yurt\n  He's a\
    \ New Age badger, his name is Little Kurt\n  Careful now, his feelings are very\
    \ easily hurt\nIncey-wincey lobster, clacking in the sea\n  His brain's completely\
    \ alien to that of you and me\n  Incey-wincey lobster, much bigger than a bee\n\
    \  The lobster's very strange, and is never ever twee\nIncey-wincey goat-boy,\
    \ creature of two realms\n  We can see you darting in between the elms\n  Half\
    \ of you is human, the other half's a goat\n  Incey-wincey goat-boy, drowning\
    \ in a moat\nIncey-wincey Stalin with his pockmarked face\n  Keeps all his medals\
    \ in a big briefcase\n  Lurks in the Kremlin hatching plots and schemes\n  Incey-wincey\
    \ Stalin haunts your childhood dreams\n"
