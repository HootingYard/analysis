  text: 'I am old enough to remember--albeit dimly--the Latin Mass. For younger readers,
    and non-Catholics, I should explain that until the mid-1960s, throughout the Catholic
    church, Mass was conducted exclusively in Latin. The priest would deliver the
    liturgy in Latin, and the congregation, when required to voice responses, would
    do likewise. The change to the use of the vernacular came about when Pope John
    XXIII instituted various liberalising reforms. There remain a few recalcitrant
    diehards--notable among them being the father of Mad Max star Melvin Gibson--who
    cling to the Latin Mass, although I understand this is much disapproved of by
    the Vatican, and may even be illegal.

    On the council estate where I grew up, there were many Catholics but no Catholic
    church. To save us from having to trudge a fair distance to St Bede''s, the parish
    church, an arrangement had been made that a pub on the estate would host our Sunday
    Mass. Thus every week we would troop into the Moby Dick on Whalebone Lane. We
    used the main bar area of the pub, with chairs temporarily aligned in rows, though
    I cannot recall what served as an altar. I do remember that towels were draped
    over all the beer pumps at the bar. After Mass, a goodly proportion of the congregation,
    and probably the priest too, would remain in the pub waiting for opening time.
    My parents were not drinkers, though, so we were herded home.


    Around the same time as the introduction of the Mass in English, the service itself
    was moved to a new community centre on the estate. Thus passed a particular, and
    in retrospect profound, part of my childhood.

    I stopped attending Mass when, as a nincompoop teenager, I turned my back on the
    faith. Then, and for many years afterwards, if I thought about the Latin Mass
    at all, it was as a prime example of the stupidity of religion. How preposterous,
    for people to gather together to listen and respond to what for most of them (and
    certainly for the infant me) was a babble of incomprehensible gibberish!

    It is only recently that I have realised the significance of this early experience.
    One must bear in mind that for the vast majority of people, there was nothing
    remotely swinging about the 1960s. Particularly on my council estate, it was a
    dull, pinched, grey (or beige) time yet to emerge from the austerity of the immediate
    post-war years. We had no television, telephone, refrigerator, central heating,
    or other home comforts. Life was uneventful and devoid of any but the most paltry
    excitements. (I now look back with nostalgia for the peace and tranquility.)

    There was thus something quite magical and passing strange about those Sunday
    mornings. We gathered in the gloom of the pub, while a man dressed--improbably--in
    often colourfully embroidered raiment stood, with his back to us (as the priests
    did in those days), intoning a litany of words, and always exactly the same words,
    which we did not understand, and bore no relation to anything we heard elsewhere,
    in any circumstances. Indeed there was nothing about it that had anything whatsoever
    to do with the world we inhabited the rest of the time. It was baffling and bizarre,
    but, by dint of weekly repetition, comfortingly familiar. And it was deeply, deeply
    serious.

    It has now dawned on me, at long last, that, in my own faltering yet determined
    way, I have been trying to recreate this numinous childhood experience by babbling,
    once a week, in Hooting Yard On The Air on ResonanceFM.'
