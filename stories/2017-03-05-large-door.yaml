  text: 'So glorious, the Large Door. Behind it, one prince in one palace. A cage
    bird in a birdcage. Ruffled feathers and one cardboard box on its side. Clever
    men with enormous brains next to an armoire. Salutes made hilarious by puppetry.
    There are pianos and machine guns.

    There is one prince. There is a chatelaine with a wooden leg. There is a cage
    bird in a birdcage. There is blood on the rug. There is a cake in the pantry.
    There are candles on the cake. A clever man with an enormous brain has put a cardboard
    box over his head.

    Electricity has been installed. Jasper in overalls. Millet strewn under the birdcage.
    Echoes of chivalry or typhoid. Weeping widow in widow''s weeds behind an arras
    weeping. Also wooden leg. Wood from banister railings. Interior railings be damned!
    Breadcrumbs in the millet.

    Intricate wiring courtesy of Jasper. Chatelaine''s oxygen pump. A vase of genetically
    modified lupins. Such tiny lupins. Such a hysterical prince. One prince without
    a cardboard box. The throwing of fits. The tidiest annexe. The marmaladeless larder.

    Grief embroidered on a pin cushion. Tallow candles guttered. A worm in the birthday
    cake. Slime and cobwebs near the clever men at the armoire. The result of the
    Honved cup tie. Smoke from the attic. Hippies encamped in the grounds in tents
    in perpetuity. Elsewhere harpies.

    Platitudes of sausage and gristle. One eye of one prince in one palace. Milk,
    lumber, string. Delirium of Jasper besotted. Bluebottle splattered on the wainscot
    dead. Funereal violins. Jug on the mantelpiece. Warped perspective of cardboard
    box and birdcage.

    Saturday tennis. One lupin wilted and turned to stone. There is a freak thunderstorm.
    A bat was seen. One bat in one sky in one hour. Muffled gunfire o''er the hills
    and far away. Jasper running with scissors. The chatelaine''s leg hankering for
    its balcony.

    Terrible giddiness of one prince. Enter the clairvoyant pig. Ten tin drums and
    a tuba. Vinegar blush of cloth-eared gran. A clever man hangs a Hazchem banner
    from the ceiling. Startling vulgarity of the firstborn. Dix Pap, Cray Lars. The
    bluebottle was a doll.

    Drastic measures of Jasper in extremis. One prince chucks one golliwog from one
    window. Pity and guff. Heresies enumerated by the chatelaine in sight of the cage
    bird in the birdcage. Soup before marmalade. Fenland memento mori.

    This could continue interminably.

    Large door.'
