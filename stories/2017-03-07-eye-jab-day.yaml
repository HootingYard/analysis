  text: 'This afternoon I shall be undergoing what seems like the umpteenth injection
    of a needle directly into my eyeball. It occurs to me that at some point I ought
    to write an account of what goes on at Tuesday Injection Club, introducing you
    lot to some of the characters I encounter, the doctors, nurses, and ancillary
    staff and the other patients. I can also attempt to answer some of the burning
    questions that are raised, such as why do I never get offered a cup of tea? and
    who is that mad woman who marches to and fro brandishing a clipboard but never
    actually speaks to anyone?

    I shall be interested to discover if, this week, I experience the Black Spot.
    Sometimes, after an injection, I have a Black Spot in my eye for a day or two,
    and sometimes not. The first time this happened it was mightily disconcerting.
    Now I treat it with airy familiarity, and imagine it as something that might have
    inspired a tale by J Sheridan Le Fanu.

    My more devoted readers will no doubt be asking but Mr Key can you actually see
    any better? to which the answer is, no, not yet, I am still perceiving the world
    through a blur of hazy mist or a haze of misty blur.

    Onwards to jab time!'
