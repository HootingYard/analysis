  text: 'Prick up your ears and click here and you can listen to the first episode
    of Hooting Yard In The Electro-Magnetic Field, a brand new show from ResonanceFM.

    As I write, boffins in a top secret research laboratory buried somewhere beneath
    the Swiss Alps are trying to calculate just how this show can be differentiated
    from the much-loved Hooting Yard On The Air. Initial measurements would seem to
    indicate the answer is "not at all".'
