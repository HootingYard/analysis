  text: 'As you lot probably already know, today is the first day of International
    Brain Awareness Week. But not at Hooting Yard! No, here we decided instead to
    celebrate International Lobster Brain Awareness Week. Who gives tuppence for the
    paltry human brain when we could be raising our awareness of the majestic brain
    of the lobster? It is an organ that, as one noteworthy lobster enthusiast claimed,
    is quite possibly the pinnacle of God''s creation.

    The first thing you ought to know about the lobster brain is that it is roughly
    the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen, or Biro. Imagine that! There are several
    other things you will wish to know, but we have a whole week ahead, so be patient.

    If there is anything in particular you are keen to be made aware of, with regard
    to the brains of lobsters, please add your questions in the Comments. We have
    a team of lobster experts standing by, ready to answer them.

    Nota Bene : Please feel free to frame your questions in the language of lobsters.'
