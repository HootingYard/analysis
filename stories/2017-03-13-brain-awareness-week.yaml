  text: "As you lot probably already know, today is the first day of International\
    \ Brain Awareness Week. But not at Hooting Yard! No, here we decided instead to\
    \ celebrate International Lobster Brain Awareness Week. Who gives tuppence for\
    \ the paltry human brain when we could be raising our awareness of the majestic\
    \ brain of the lobster? It is an organ that, as one noteworthy lobster enthusiast\
    \ claimed, is quite possibly the pinnacle of God's creation.\nThe first thing\
    \ you ought to know about the lobster brain is that it is roughly the size of\
    \ the tip of a ballpoint pen, or Biro. Imagine that! There are several other things\
    \ you will wish to know, but we have a whole week ahead, so be patient.\nIf there\
    \ is anything in particular you are keen to be made aware of, with regard to the\
    \ brains of lobsters, please add your questions in the Comments. We have a team\
    \ of lobster experts standing by, ready to answer them.\nNota Bene\_: Please feel\
    \ free to frame your questions in the language of lobsters."
