  text: 'I have a terrible memory. I sometimes wonder if my inability to remember
    things might have something to do with the ruinous debauches of my Wilderness
    Years, but I suspect my forgetfulness preceded them, and that my memory was never
    much cop in the first place. I barely recall much of what I have written and posted
    here over the years. This morning, casting about in my puny brain for a topic,
    I thought "Aha! I know! I will write about Dobson discovering the Pillow Book
    of Sei Shonagon and deciding to write a Pillow Book of his own!"

    I got as far as writing an opening line about Dobson and Marigold Chew sitting
    at breakfast one fabulously dreary morning in the early 1950s when a faint ping!
    within my bonce halted me. "I''ve already done this, haven''t I?" I said, to a
    nearby sock, for want of any other interlocutor. The sock did not reply, but a
    quick search confirmed that, yes, six years ago I wrote about this very thing.
    Maybe you lot had forgotten about it too. Here it is again:

    Capacious and pulsating it may have been, but Dobson''s brain contained many,
    many pockets of ignorance. He was in his mid fifties, for example, when he first
    came upon the Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, a work of which he had no previous
    inkling. He did not read it, merely noting the title on the spine of a copy lodged
    on the bookshelf of his friend Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp, the Sino-Dutch artist
    and mountaineer.

    Back at home later that day, he mentioned it to Marigold Chew.

    "Did you know that an eleventh century Japanese bint wrote an entire book about
    pillows?" he asked.

    "Yes, Dobson, of course," said Marigold Chew, "I have borrowed it from the mobile
    library more than once, and read it from cover to cover."

    "Speaking of the mobile library," said Dobson, and he embarked on a long-winded
    and pettifogging digression upon the mobile library, which in that place at that
    time took the form of a cart pulled by an elegant yet tubercular drayhorse, the
    cart piled high with hardbacks covered in greaseproof paper jackets, the drayhorse
    chivvied on its way by an equally elegant and equally tubercular librarian-carter,
    a man of grim countenance and terrible personal habits who bore a distinct resemblance
    to the actor Karl Johnson, noted for his roles as elderly peasant Twister Turrill
    in Lark Rise To Candleford and as Wittgenstein in Derek Jarman''s Wittgenstein.
    In fact, it may even have been Johnson himself, moonlighting as a mobile librarian
    to supplement his thespian earnings. Dobson posited this possibility, but doubted
    it was true, as we, too, must doubt it until all the evidence is in.

    So implacable was the pamphleteer''s babbling that Marigold Chew was unable to
    get a word in edgeways, and was thus given no opportunity to point out to Dobson
    that the Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, like all pillow books, was not actually
    a book about pillows, but a collection of lists and aphorisms and observations
    and jottings and poems and opinions and anecdotes. Had he ceased prattling for
    but a moment, Dobson would have learned this, and not, when eventually he exhausted
    the topic of the mobile library and the greaseproof paper jackets and the drayhorse
    and the librarian-carter and the actor and the fictional peasant and the non-fictional
    philosopher, gone scurrying off to his escritoire to sit and scribble the following:

    I have learned that a thousand years ago, a woman from the land of Yoko Ono wrote
    an entire book about pillows. Such is human progress that in the intervening millennium
    there must be much, much more to be said on the subject. Clearly I am the pamphleteer
    to take on this daunting task. I shall set to work on the Pillow Book of Dobson
    as soon as I have taken a nap. NB: The nap will of course be research for my Pillow
    Book, as I shall be resting my head upon a pillow while I nap, and present my
    findings as soon as I wake up.

    As far as we know, the promised "findings" were never written down. So refreshed
    was Dobson by his nap that, upon waking, he immediately put on his Iberian duck
    hunter''s boots, grabbed an Alpenstock in his fist, and set out for a jaunty hike
    that took him past the electricity pylons and the abandoned swimming pool and
    the badger rescue station and the allotments. All the while he hiked, he concentrated
    his mind on pillows--a thousand years of pillows! His brain reeled as he struggled
    to comprehend the sheer amount of material he would have to marshal in the making
    of his Pillow Book. What advances mankind must have made in the field of pillows
    since the eleventh century! How many heads had rested on how many pillows in that
    time? How many dreams dreamt during pillow-assisted dozes and naps and even comas?
    Pausing for a breather outside the bolted and shuttered off licence, Dobson suddenly
    felt intimidated by the scale of the task before him. He watched the skies for
    swifts and sparrows and starlings and other birds beginning with S. He rattled
    the bolts on the off licence door. He chucked his Alpenstock into a ditch. And
    then he turned for home, resolved to write, not a Pillow Book, but a whole series
    of Pillow Pamphlets, each to tackle a single, manageable subsection of his vast
    unwieldy subject matter.

    "Marigold!" he announced, bustling through the door, "I have had a brainwave with
    regard to my working methods on the pillow project!"

    "I did not know you had embarked upon a pillow project, Dobson," said Marigold
    Chew, "And what have you done with the Alpenstock?"

    "Oh, I chucked it into a ditch," said Dobson, "I shall go and retrieve it later.
    But first I must write out the plan for my Pillow Pamphlets, updating a thousand
    years of pillow history since Sei Shonagon wrote her book about pillows long long
    ago in far Japan!"

    But so exhausted was the pamphleteer by his hiking and his brain activity that
    before sitting at his escritoire he took another nap. He thus set a pattern for
    what was to follow. Every time he determined to set to work on the Pillow Pamphlets,
    he convinced himself that further practical pillow research was necessary, and
    lay his head upon a pillow, and fell asleep.

    The project was eventually abandoned when the pamphleteer''s attention was distracted
    by cataclysmic world events, and he turned his energies to writing his famous
    pamphlet On The Inadvisability Of Taking Daytime Naps During The Unfolding Of
    Cataclysmic World Events (out of print).'
