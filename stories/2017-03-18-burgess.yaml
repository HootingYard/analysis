  text: 'I once saw the novelist Anthony Burgess settle down at a concert grand, put
    a reproduction of ''The Fighting Temeraire'' on the music stand, and play the
    picture in a camp, but straight-faced, demonstration of synaesthesia. As ever
    with Burgess, you were not quite sure if he was taking the mick.
