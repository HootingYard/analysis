  text: 'I often receive letters from readers crying plaintively "Mr Key! Mr Key!
    How can I become a tiptop sporting champion? If anyone can give me a top tip,
    it is you!"

    Actually, it is not me you need to ask, but Hooting Yard''s tiptop sports correspondent
    Fatima Gilliblat. This is what she has to say:

    The best way to become a tiptop sporting champion is to ensure you were born on
    23 March. It was on this day of the year that champs such as Roger Bannister,
    Mo Farah, Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny, Steve Redgrave, and the bobsleighing Olympian
    Shelley Rudman dropped from their mothers'' wombs, as did the cricketer Mike Atherton
    and the pugilist Joe Calzaghe. If you were born on any other day, I am afraid
    that the road to sporting glory will be steep and pitiless and you will almost
    certainly fail.'
