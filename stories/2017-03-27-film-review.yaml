  text: 'Yesterday I went to see the new Walt Dinsey [sic] film Beauty And The Beast.
    (I know, I know. Don''t ask.) A more fitting title would have been Feisty Bookworm
    And The Prince With Bad Table Manners. Belle, the Beauty, as played by Emma Watson,
    is feisty, and a bookworm. The only other thing to note about her character is
    that she has a rather problematic relationship with her father''s horse, but we
    shall come to that.

    The putative Beast (one Dan Stevens) is hardly bestial. I was expecting something
    like the Grunty Man, that awful figure of children''s nightmares. Other than being
    a bit hairy, sporting a pair of goaty horns, and growling occasionally, this so-called
    Beast seems perfectly civilised. He speaks in a mellifluous RADA-trained voice
    not unlike that of the late Alan Rickman, and has a well-stocked library. The
    extent of his bestiality seems to be that he slurps his soup straight from the
    bowl. Franz Kafka had worse table manners (his father used to hide behind the
    newspaper when dining with FK).

    Now, about that horse. Its name is Philippe. The Feisty Bookworm arrives at the
    castle astride Philippe. We then see neither hide nor hair of the horse until,
    after an indeterminate period--days? weeks? months?--the Beast frees the Bookworm
    so she can rescue her father from imminent incarceration in a lunatic asylum.
    Suddenly, there is Philippe, fit as a fiddle, ready to gallop back to the village.
    Where has he been all this time? The Feisty Bookworm has expressed not a jot of
    concern for him, and we have seen no sign of a stable, nor even a trough. It is
    all very mysterious.

    Hooting Yard Rating : Three stars for tiptop soup-slurping.'
