  text: 'Crikey! I think that must be the longest period of eerie silence at Hooting
    Yard since records began fourteen years ago. Much has happened in the interim.
    Well ... not that much. There has been ongoing eye trouble (not yet resolved),
    regular shows on Resonance--available on Mixcloud--where I have been looking at
    past investigations of plums and swans and Captain Nitty, and a brief trip to
    Scotland. Oh, and I was asked to name a trawler.

    To ease you back in to what they call the Hooting Yard Experience, I bring you
    the work of Charles Anthony. I have no idea who Mr Anthony is, but he is clearly
    a very sensible man. Please take a minute to marvel at this and this.'
