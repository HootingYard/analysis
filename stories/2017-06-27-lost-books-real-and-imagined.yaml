  text: "I am currently reading\u2014or peering at, with my iffy eyes\u2014The Book\
    \ Of Lost Books by Stuart Kelly (2005). Among other things I have learned is that\
    \ we have lost a work by the ancient polymath Callimachus (c.320\u2014c.340 BCE)\
    \ entitled On The Changes Of The Names Of Fish. I, for one, would love to read\
    \ it, and I suspect it inspired a dream I had, where I came upon a copy of On\
    \ The Stiffness Or Otherwise Of Bolts Of Cloth by Rotting Engineering Equipment\
    \ Jr."
