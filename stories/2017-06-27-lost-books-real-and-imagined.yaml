  text: I am currently reading--or peering at, with my iffy eyes--The Book Of Lost
    Books by Stuart Kelly (2005). Among other things I have learned is that we have
    lost a work by the ancient polymath Callimachus (c.320--c.340 BCE) entitled On
    The Changes Of The Names Of Fish. I, for one, would love to read it, and I suspect
    it inspired a dream I had, where I came upon a copy of On The Stiffness Or Otherwise
    Of Bolts Of Cloth by Rotting Engineering Equipment Jr.
