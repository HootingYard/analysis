    \ forward\u201D, \u201Crobust and transparent\u201D, and, heaven help us, \u201C\
    diverse \u2018n\u2019 vibrant\u201D. Another horror I have thus far overlooked\
    \ is \u201Cnailed\u201D, as in \u201Che's really nailed it there\u201D. For the\
    \ avoidance of doubt, there is only one thing that can be nailed, and that is\
    \ Christ to the cross. If you are a barbaric heathen and have no idea what I am\
    \ talking about, see below.\n\nCrucifixion by Horace Pippin, 1943"
