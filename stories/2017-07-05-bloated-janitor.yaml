  text: "There was a bloated janitor, and all his friends were dead.\n  Echoes of\
    \ their voices bounced round inside his head.\n  He was terribly stressed.\n \
    \ And so, to blot out the echoes of the past, he fled\n  To Chris and Tim and\
    \ Lindsay, to Dagmar, John and Fred\n  Who played Unrest.\n(With a nod to The\
    \ Plain People of England.)"
