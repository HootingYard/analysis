  text: 'Behold the Nylon Duke. He is fashioned entirely from nylon, every last bit
    of him, yea, even unto his cartilages. He is a nylon wonder of the world.

    The Nylon Duke is pulled along, flat on his back, on a cart, by a great grey drayhorse
    with its bright and battering sandal, from village to village. At each stop along
    the way, in villages leafy or otherwise, he is hoisted upright by a system of
    winches and pulleys. The villagers gather and gasp and gawp at the sight of the
    Nylon Duke. They bring offerings of potatoes and similar root vegetables, piled
    high on the cart before being transferred into sacks by the Nylon Duke''s attendants.
    These attendants are not made of nylon.

    Elsewhere, there is a Nylon Duchess, and there may be a Nylon Dauphin, and there
    are even rumours of a Nylon Dunce. But in this land there are not enough great
    grey drayhorses to pull them on carts around villages. A Dearth Of Drayhorses
    is an oft-reprinted tract which goes some way to explaining this situation.

    Consider the Nylon Duke in the round, in all his pomp and finery and nylonosity.
    Would you begrudge him your potatoes? Think hard before you answer, for fig eider
    remprent, scou binder ad fig, as it is written, as it is engraved, as it is tattooed
    upon the foreheads of the attendants.

    The Nylon Duke''s given name is Bob.'
