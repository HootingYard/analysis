    Dear Mr Key, I am pleased to hear you are heading abroad for a well-earned break.
    I would be most interested to know what you are taking with you as holiday reading.

    Though I am leaving very early tomorrow morning, I have not finished packing.
    However, a couple of items have already found their way into my suitcase: the
    current issue of Fortean Times, and a new collection of essays by Gertrude Himmelfarb.
