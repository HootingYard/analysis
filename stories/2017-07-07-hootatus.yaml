  text: Just as I locate my mislaid mojo, and return to tippy-tapping, I'm afraid
    I must announce a brief hooting hiatus (hootatus?). I will be away in foreign
    climes, dressed like Fitzcarraldo, for about a week and a half. You can spend
    that time exploring the archive, and I will resume regular posting upon my return.
