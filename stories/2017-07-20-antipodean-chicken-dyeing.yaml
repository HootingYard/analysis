  text: "You will be pleased to learn that Mr Key has returned from his sojourn on\
    \ foreign shores, refreshed, revivified, and ready to shower you once again with\
    \ sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. I am not going to tell you much, if anything,\
    \ about my jaunt, but I think it is worth noting that I met, on my travels, a\
    \ man called Dave, from Australia who, when young, used to dye chickens different\
    \ colours. It was not entirely clear to me whether he did this as a form of gainful\
    \ employment, or for his own entertainment. It might even have been art. I mention\
    \ this because it occurred to me that an Antipodean chicken-dyer could prove a\
    \ useful recurring character in the various doings recounted here at Hooting Yard.\
    \ We shall see.\nOh, one more thing. I was startled to discover that Dave was\
    \ unable to name the four members of The Seekers. I have long believed\u2014with\
    \ good reason\u2014that it is the mark of any civilised person, and certainly\
    \ of any civilised Antipodean, that they can rattle off those names without even\
    \ having to think, much as one might list John, Paul, George, and Ringo (not forgetting\
    \ Yoko, of course), or Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, or Wynken, Blynken, and\
    \ Nod. I have no doubt that every single one of my readers will be as baffled\
    \ as I was by Dave's inability in this regard. Perhaps a lethal chemical constituent\
    \ of the dyes used on those chickens long ago bedizened his brainpans.\n"
