  text: 'You will be pleased to learn that Mr Key has returned from his sojourn on
    foreign shores, refreshed, revivified, and ready to shower you once again with
    sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. I am not going to tell you much, if anything,
    about my jaunt, but I think it is worth noting that I met, on my travels, a man
    called Dave, from Australia who, when young, used to dye chickens different colours.
    It was not entirely clear to me whether he did this as a form of gainful employment,
    or for his own entertainment. It might even have been art. I mention this because
    it occurred to me that an Antipodean chicken-dyer could prove a useful recurring
    character in the various doings recounted here at Hooting Yard. We shall see.

    Oh, one more thing. I was startled to discover that Dave was unable to name the
    four members of The Seekers. I have long believed--with good reason--that it is
    the mark of any civilised person, and certainly of any civilised Antipodean, that
    they can rattle off those names without even having to think, much as one might
    list John, Paul, George, and Ringo (not forgetting Yoko, of course), or Matthew,
    Mark, Luke, and John, or Wynken, Blynken, and Nod. I have no doubt that every
    single one of my readers will be as baffled as I was by Dave''s inability in this
    regard. Perhaps a lethal chemical constituent of the dyes used on those chickens
    long ago bedizened his brainpans.
