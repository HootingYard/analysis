  text: 'For a number of reasons, it has proved necessary to faff about with the technical
    gubbins lurking behind the Hooting Yard website, hence this new look. My--and
    your--thanks are due to the boffin who worked tirelessly to ensure the whole thing
    is still here on the internet. He has now gone away to a foreign land for a well-deserved
    break.

    Inevitably, there will be a few teething problems. I noted, for example, that
    the index to the Archives, making them accessible by date and topic under the
    tab above, has vanished. I know that most of you lot spend virtually all your
    waking hours reading, rereading, and rerereading the ten years'' worth of potsages
    [sic] gathered here, so until we fix that, upon the boffin''s return, I suggest
    you make use of the Search box to rummage around.

    Please let me know of any other blips, bloops, or catastrophic horrors you may
    spot, and we shall endeavour to put things straight.'
