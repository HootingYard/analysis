  text: "Gosh, look! Another letter arrives\u2014a real one this time\u2014from anagrammatic\
    \ reader Carlo Randle, who says:\nDear Frank\nA few weeks ago, I spent a grim\
    \ evening playing some kind of Lovecraft-based collaborative boardgame with friends.\n\
    Tiny plastic figures moving about on a dark board overprinted in near-black ink;\
    \ the prolix and apparently arbitrary rules, printed not in a handy booklet but\
    \ on large, flappy sheets tacked to the inside of the presentation box lid; the\
    \ various stacks of darkly-printed hazard cards, menace cards, threat cards, jeopardy\
    \ cards and so on; the strange anomaly of the \u2018taxis\u2019 by which one's\
    \ avatar might whisk about the region's gloomy mapscape; the massiveness of the\
    \ dice and their propensity to scatter the scrawny, lightweight playing pieces\
    \ from their assigned places; the confusing indistinguishability of those playing\
    \ pieces, which meant one frequently expended all one's half-understood strategic\
    \ nous on moving the wrong character, frustrating some ultimately crucial aspect\
    \ of our glacially-paced campaign to resist or repel the Old Ones; the swiftly-escalating\
    \ despair that (a) the game could not be won by the human players, because the\
    \ resources of The Game (our opponent) were so lavishly stacked against us and\
    \ (b) that it would nevertheless take a Troublingly Long Time before our inevitable,\
    \ crushing defeat was confirmed. In that respect, I suppose, it was a truly Lovecraftian\
    \ experience.\nI remember my avatar's being obliged to sidle down a kind of sewer\
    \ pipe from Arkham to Dunwich, or similar, to forestall some inexpressible catastrophe\
    \ which was about to be visited on the region by a tiny plastic \u2018monster\u2019\
    \ which, had it tumbled from one's Cornflakes packet in childhood, would have\
    \ been flicked desultorily into the pedal-bin without a second glance.\nWe lost\
    \ \u2026 the game itself was declared the winner. But I don't want to give the\
    \ impression that nobody enjoyed it. Our host was cooing with delight all evening.\n\
    Yours shudderingly,\nCarlo Randle (anag.)"
