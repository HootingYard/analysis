    reader Carlo Randle, who says:

    Dear Frank

    A few weeks ago, I spent a grim evening playing some kind of Lovecraft-based collaborative
    boardgame with friends.

    Tiny plastic figures moving about on a dark board overprinted in near-black ink;
    the prolix and apparently arbitrary rules, printed not in a handy booklet but
    on large, flappy sheets tacked to the inside of the presentation box lid; the
    various stacks of darkly-printed hazard cards, menace cards, threat cards, jeopardy
    cards and so on; the strange anomaly of the ''taxis'' by which one''s avatar might
    whisk about the region''s gloomy mapscape; the massiveness of the dice and their
    propensity to scatter the scrawny, lightweight playing pieces from their assigned
    places; the confusing indistinguishability of those playing pieces, which meant
    one frequently expended all one''s half-understood strategic nous on moving the
    wrong character, frustrating some ultimately crucial aspect of our glacially-paced
    campaign to resist or repel the Old Ones; the swiftly-escalating despair that
    (a) the game could not be won by the human players, because the resources of The
    Game (our opponent) were so lavishly stacked against us and (b) that it would
    nevertheless take a Troublingly Long Time before our inevitable, crushing defeat
    was confirmed. In that respect, I suppose, it was a truly Lovecraftian experience.

    I remember my avatar''s being obliged to sidle down a kind of sewer pipe from
    Arkham to Dunwich, or similar, to forestall some inexpressible catastrophe which
    was about to be visited on the region by a tiny plastic ''monster'' which, had
    it tumbled from one''s Cornflakes packet in childhood, would have been flicked
    desultorily into the pedal-bin without a second glance.

    We lost ... the game itself was declared the winner. But I don''t want to give
    the impression that nobody enjoyed it. Our host was cooing with delight all evening.

    Yours shudderingly,

    Carlo Randle (anag.)'
