  text: 'This piece first appeared in 2010. I am reposting it today for reasons which
    I am sure will be obvious to the woolly-brained among you.

    If you are a certain type of folk singer, or vicar, or countryside rambler, you
    will as likely as not be wearing a jumper or sweater or pullover made of wool.
    It may conceivably be a polo neck. You more than anyone will know that there is
    good wool and there is bad wool. I would go so far as to say that, in the matter
    of wool, there is no middle ground, no grey area. Either the wool is good, or
    it is bad, and there''s an end on''t.

    If your jumper or sweater or pullover has been knitted from good wool, you should
    count your blessings. Depending on where you live, good wool can be hard to come
    by. You may have had to send away to some far distant woolly apparel concern to
    have one of their catalogue items delivered to you through the mails, in a packet.
    The costs of transportation and packaging will have added to the basic price of
    your chosen jumper or sweater or pullover, but the outlay is justified when it
    is guaranteed that the knitwork was done with good wool.

    But woe betide you if for some reason you are forced to wear something made from
    bad wool. Bad wool comes from bad sheep. They may be diseased, or repugnant, or
    unseemly, or all three. That does not stop unscrupulous shearers from shearing
    the wool from them and selling it on to equally unscrupulous wool merchants, who
    in turn have it processed and knitted into garments. It is both sad and astounding
    what reserves of human skill can be deployed into making something out of bad
    wool. Spotting a garment on a market stall, or for sale from the barrow of a barrow
    boy, it may not be immediately apparent whether the wool is good wool or bad wool.
    It may not even become evident when you put it on, pulling it over your head and
    inserting your arms and tucking it about yourself. But if it is made from bad
    wool it will contaminate you, as surely as night follows day. That is the thing
    about garb knitted from bad wool. The knitting was bad and the garb is bad, because
    of the bad wool. And, disporting it upon your frame, sashaying along the boulevards
    of your faubourg, it will make you bad too.

    It is a wonder that bad wool has not been made illegal. Perhaps there are happy
    lands where that is the case. Is that not a pleasing thought, a happy land where
    all the wool is good, and none of it bad? Alas, it is an impossible dream. For
    there will always be bad sheep, and bad shearers, and unscrupulous merchants,
    and ne''er-do-well traders and barrow boys.

    Hence, if you are wearing good wool, I repeat, count your blessings, count them
    until kingdom come, and then count them over again. And if you are wearing bad
    wool, reflect upon the circumstance, ask what you have done to deserve bad wool.
    It is likely that you have brought the bad wool upon yourself, through your own
    contamination, for bad attracts bad, in persons and wool as in other phenomena
    of the boundless universe.'
