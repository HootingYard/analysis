  text: 'One of the places I visited on my recent holiday was described to me as "an
    insolent little town, turning its back on the tortured sea". Tortured the sea
    may have been, but it was neither dolphin-torn nor gong-tormented, though given
    my guide''s turns of phrase perhaps it ought to have been. Among the sights of
    the town--snapped by Pansy Cradledew--was this absurd flaneur prancing like a
    ninny along the boulevards before posing for the camera.
