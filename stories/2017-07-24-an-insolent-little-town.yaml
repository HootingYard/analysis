  text: "One of the places I visited on my recent holiday was described to me as \u201C\
    an insolent little town, turning its back on the tortured sea\u201D. Tortured\
    \ the sea may have been, but it was neither dolphin-torn nor gong-tormented, though\
    \ given my guide's turns of phrase perhaps it ought to have been. Among the sights\
    \ of the town\u2014snapped by Pansy Cradledew\u2014was this absurd flaneur prancing\
    \ like a ninny along the boulevards before posing for the camera.\n"
