  text: 'Why do fools fall in love? It is a question that has taxed the minds of great
    thinkers throughout history. A notable investigation of our own era, by Lymon
    in 1956, was perhaps hampered by his extreme youth and that of his research assistants.
    It is true that some breakthroughs in the advance of human knowledge have been
    made by youngsters, but in matters of the heart we may prefer to rely on the doddery
    and decrepit, who are likely to have amassed valuable experience in the field.

    Few are as doddery and decrepit as Nisbet Owlhead who, it is thrilling to learn,
    is at long last on the brink of publishing his findings. Owlhead has been working
    on this stuff for years, holed up in his top secret laboratory somewhere high
    in the Swiss Alps. Some decades ago, he provided a glimpse into his working methods
    in an article for The Rigorous And High-Minded Scientific Bulletin Of Lurve, reprinted
    here without permission:

    In order to find out why fools fall in love, we must first obtain two fools. The
    easiest way to do this would be to go to Cretin Town and drag off the street and
    bundle into the back of a van the first couple of fools we encounter. So that
    is what I did. It is a very long way from Cretin Town to my top secret laboratory
    somewhere high in the Swiss Alps, so I placed both fools into an induced coma
    for the duration of the journey by van, train, forklift truck, ship, another forklift
    truck, another van, another train, and finally funicular railway.

    I installed the fools in a sealed but spacious chamber designed especially for
    my purposes. Before bringing them out of their comas, I did a thorough investigation
    of their brains, prodding at them with various instruments, to ascertain the precise
    degree of foolishness. They were fools all right. I could not have been more pleased,
    so before waking them I treated myself to a slap-up dinner at The Reeking Goat,
    a Michelin-unstarred eaterie halfway down the mountain. The trough that night
    was filled with delicious pap and slops, and I mixed easily with the regular clientele
    of goatherds, peasants, and tubercular alpine invalids.

    Back in the lab, after a post-prandial snooze and a few games of pingpong with
    my hunchbacked assistant, Mungo, I set to work. I injected both fools with a wake-me-up
    potion, and then retreated to my observation post outside the sealed chamber.
    After some minutes the fools, as scientifically predicted, fooled about. I was
    so pleased I had another slap-up dinner, another snooze, and further games of
    pingpong with Mungo.

    On St. Valentine''s Day, I introduced into the chamber a box of chocolates. The
    following year, I introduced a bunch of flowers. The third and most decisive intervention
    came on the next St. Valentine''s Day, when I placed in the chamber a cherubic,
    winged, chubby, naked, curly-haired infant armed with a bow and arrow, which hovered
    in the air above the fools.

    I have every confidence that true love will blossom within that sealed chamber,
    and when it does I will be ready with my scanners and bleepers and probes and
    buzzers and pointy things and all sorts of tiptop scientific paraphernalia you
    could never begin to understand. Mungo keeps it all polished to a gleam with his
    special rag.

    Owlhead celebrated his ninetieth birthday last week with an announcement that
    he would publish his findings on St. Valentine''s Day 2018, or 2019, or, at a
    push, 2020.
