  text: 'In When I Was Borp, the narrator tells us that, on finding fools in his orchard,
    he drove them out. This may be truth or it may be fiction--he is not an entirely
    reliable narrator--but either way it is a clear reference to Expulsion Of The
    Fools From The Orchard, a mag, a maj, oh, a magnificent and majestic oil painting
    by the noted oil painter Dot Oilpain RA.

    Those initials after her name are often thought to indicate, mistakenly, that
    Dot Oilpain is a member of the Royal Academy. In fact they stand for Rara Avis.
    The artist considers herself to be a rare bird, and likes to wear a cardboard
    beak and a suit of feathers when working.

    Just as, in her case, the letters RA are misinterpreted, so too her magnificent
    and majestic oil painting. Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard depicts two
    fools being expelled from an orchard, one male and one female. They are both naked,
    and the female fool is holding a piece of fruit from which a chunk has been bitten.
    Understandably, the subject matter is thought to be Biblical. But this is not
    the case, as Dot Oilpain explained in an interview with Misinterpreted Oil Paintings
    Weekly magazine.

    It is true that I have mined the Bible for inspiration in the past. There are,
    for instance, my oil paintings of the Gadarene swine, the hairy man and the smooth
    man, everyone drinking the waters of their own cistern, and the horse saying "ha
    ha" among the trumpets in the Book of Job. But Expulsion Of The Fools From The
    Orchard has absolutely nothing to do with Adam and Eve being driven out of the
    Garden of Eden.

    The idea for the painting came from a conversation I had at a swish sophisticated
    cocktail party. I was not there by invitation--I stumbled into it under the misapprehension
    that it was a gathering of ornithologists, among whom I hoped to garner some tips
    for finessing my cardboard beak and suit of feathers, which I always wear when
    painting. By the time I realised that nobody in the room knew the first thing
    about birds, I had already drunk several cocktails and I felt a bit woozy. Worried
    that I might topple over, I leaned against a mantelpiece to steady myself. Also
    leaning against the mantelpiece, insouciantly, was a fellow who was clearly not
    an ornithologist but who nevertheless had the air of a jackdaw, or a budgerigar.
    We struck up a conversation, initially regarding mantelpieces, insouciance, cocktail
    parties, jackdaws, budgerigars, and the comparative merits of Kathy Kirby and
    Petula Clark.

    Then this chap told me about his orchard, and how it had been overrun by fools
    fooling about in it. "Are you saying Petula Clark is a fool?" I shouted, in outrage,
    for if there is one thing I cannot bear it is to hear a word said against Petula
    Clark. My interlocutor hastened to assure me that we had moved on to a completely
    separate conversational topic and that he, too, held Petula Clark in the highest
    regard, higher, perhaps, than any other twentieth-century songstress, with the
    possible exception of Cathy Berberian.

    I spluttered and spat some of my cocktail into the fireplace. "Pshaw!" I yelled,
    "Cathy Berberian couldn''t sing her way out of a paper bag, compared to the sainted
    and glorious Petula Clark!" In retrospect I am not sure this assertion stands
    up to scrutiny, but then nor do most assertions made at cocktail parties after
    a certain point.

    After several minutes of back and forth, and further cocktails, it eventually
    dawned on me that the orchard full of fools was indeed a completely separate conversational
    topic and that my umbrage had been misplaced. This in turn led to a creative spark
    setting off fireworks in my head as I envisaged a magnificent and majestic oil
    painting entitled Misplaced Umbrage. I was ready to bid farewell to the non-ornithologist
    and to rush away to my chalet peinture, don my cardboard beak and suit of feathers,
    and set to work.

    But he grabbed my arm and, with a wild look in his eyes, began gabbling about
    how he had driven the fools from his orchard, caring not a jot that they were
    naked and that one of them had just started snacking on a piece of fruit. So compelling
    was his tale that I could not help but listen, rapt, as rapt as I would listen
    to a Petula Clark platter spinning at 45rpm on my record player. And as I listened,
    the lineaments of a huge oil painting took form in my mind''s eye. Thus was born
    Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard. I began to paint it that very night.
    It took months to complete. I do not wish to boast, but I think it is the finest
    oil painting of fools being expelled from an orchard that I have ever painted,
    in oil paint, while wearing a cardboard beak and a suit of feathers, the better
    to inhabit my desired persona of a rara avis, Popsy.

    [Popsy is the given name of the editrix of Misinterpreted Oil Paintings Weekly,
    who conducted the interview.]

    Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchard by Dot Oilpain RA is currently on show
    at the Staatsgalerie, Pointy Town, as part of the exhibition "Cack-Handed Daubs
    Of Oil Paint Slathered On Vast Sheets Of Corrugated Cardboard". Entry is free,
    on production of a handful of birdseed.'
