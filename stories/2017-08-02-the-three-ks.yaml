  text: 'Yesterday I received an annoying email from a company--probably run by teenagers--called
    SOS.

    Hi Frank!, it began, overfamiliarly. I don''t know why I continued reading after
    such effrontery, but I did.

    Here at SOS we''re passionate about helping you maximise traffic to your website.
    SOS stands for Search Optimisation Solutions, and that''s exactly what we do!

    Like a fool, I carried on reading. I suppose I was won over by the thought that
    I could attract more than thirty-four readers. I became even more interested when
    SOS gave me one of their so-called "simple yet effective" tips without my having
    to pay them a penny.

    Our research shows that web traffic increases a millionfold if you mention three
    names on your site. We call them The Three Ks--Kate, Kim, and Keith. That is,
    Kate Middleton, Kim Kardashian, and Keith Potger.

    I am now racking my brains trying to work out how to concoct a story which includes
    the Duchess of Cambridge, the inexplicable celebrity, and a quarter of Antipodean
    1960s pop sensations The Seekers, which is at once (a) credible, (b) morally uplifting,
    and (c) groovy. If any of the thirty-four of you have any ideas, please let me
    know in the Comments.

    UPDATE : Gosh! Since I posted the above, an hour ago, traffic to Hooting Yard
    has increased to a whopping thirty-six! Thanks a million, SOS!'
