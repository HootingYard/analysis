  text: "Yesterday I received an annoying email from a company\u2014probably run by\
    \ teenagers\u2014called SOS.\nHi Frank!, it began, overfamiliarly. I don't know\
    \ why I continued reading after such effrontery, but I did.\nHere at SOS we're\
    \ passionate about helping you maximise traffic to your website. SOS stands for\
    \ Search Optimisation Solutions, and that's exactly what we do!\nLike a fool,\
    \ I carried on reading. I suppose I was won over by the thought that I could attract\
    \ more than thirty-four readers. I became even more interested when SOS gave me\
    \ one of their so-called \u201Csimple yet effective\u201D tips without my having\
    \ to pay them a penny.\nOur research shows that web traffic increases a millionfold\
    \ if you mention three names on your site. We call them The Three Ks\u2014Kate,\
    \ Kim, and Keith. That is, Kate Middleton, Kim Kardashian, and Keith Potger.\n\
    I am now racking my brains trying to work out how to concoct a story which includes\
    \ the Duchess of Cambridge, the inexplicable celebrity, and a quarter of Antipodean\
    \ 1960s pop sensations The Seekers, which is at once (a) credible, (b) morally\
    \ uplifting, and (c) groovy. If any of the thirty-four of you have any ideas,\
    \ please let me know in the Comments.\nUPDATE : Gosh! Since I posted the above,\
    \ an hour ago, traffic to Hooting Yard has increased to a whopping thirty-six!\
    \ Thanks a million, SOS!"
