  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes rock \u2018n\u2019 pop critic Rick Rockpopcrit, I was\
    \ fascinated to read your piece about Pierre et Clothilde yesterday. It is true,\
    \ sadly, that the duo's career lay in tatters by the early 1970s. What was missing\
    \ from your article, however, was any account of Pierre's later involvement in\
    \ the punk \u2018n\u2019 post-punk scene. My cousin Sid Punkcrit covered this\
    \ in an article for the monthly magazine Punks Named Pierre in September 1979.\
    \ I clipped it out with a pair of extremely shiny scissors, and am sending it\
    \ to you so you can transcribe it and share it with your readers.\n\nExciting\
    \ news reaches us that Pierre, previously of chart-non-topping duo Pierre et Clothilde,\
    \ is making a comeback! He has completely reinvented himself for the punk \u2018\
    n\u2019 post-punk era, fronting a new band called Pierre et les Pantoufles (above;\
    \ Pierre is on the far left). Their first single, O\xF9\_est Clothilde?, a raucous\
    \ and godawful discordant din, had me tapping my toes while wearing my own pantoufles.\
    \ The B side, Clothilde, Mon Amour is less of a toe-tapper and more of a hands-over-the-ears\
    \ cacophany of cacophonosity.\nThe band is currently in the studio recording their\
    \ debut album, Devons-nous jeter cette salet\xE9\_\xE0\_\_nos pop-enfants, Clothilde?\
    \ It promises to be a cracker. That is a view shared by Plastic Bertrand, who\
    \ I bumped into in a corridor on my way to conduct an interview with Pierre. It\
    \ came as a surprise to me that Plastic Bertrand is not, as I thought, made of\
    \ plastic. This revelation so disconcerted me that, when I sat down with Pierre,\
    \ the first thing I said to him was: \u201CPierre, did you know that Plastic Bertrand\
    \ is not made of plastic?\u201D\n\u201COui\u201D he muttered, before launching\
    \ into a mournful lament about Clothilde, accompanied by copious weeping. Unfortunately,\
    \ it was all in French, or the dialect of French spoken by Walloons, a language\
    \ with which I am wholly unfamiliar. So I just sat there trying to look sympathetic,\
    \ while puffing on a Gitane. There was no sign of the Pantoufles.\nBy the time\
    \ Pierre eventually shut up and dried his eyes with a dainty and unpunklike silken\
    \ handkerchief, I had got through an entire pack of Gitanes and had heard quite\
    \ enough mawkish Wallonian blathering. I was trying to work out what to do next.\
    \ I could slap Pierre about and tell him to get a grip. Or I could try to divert\
    \ him on to a different subject. Best of all, perhaps, I could sweep imperiously\
    \ out of the room and pursue Plastic Bertrand.\nThen the door crashed open, and\
    \ a woman swept imperiously into the room. I thought for a moment she was some\
    \ kind of space hippy. Then I realised\u2014it was Clothilde!"
