  text: 'There is the story about the pauper who steals a pea from a princeling. Or
    it may be that the princeling steals a pea from a pauper. I can never quite recall
    which way round it goes. I ought to remember, because god knows I heard the story
    often enough. My ma, or sometimes my pa, read it to me every single night, for
    years and years, as my bedtime story. Perhaps that is why I don''t remember it
    with blinding clarity, because I was always falling asleep as I listened to it.
    I fell asleep in spite of the undoubted excitement of the story, and of the Sturm
    und Drang of the violent thunderstorms which were a constant feature of the weather
    in that place at that time. I suspect my falling asleep came so easily because
    my ma, or my pa, spiked my bedtime milk of magnesia with a powerful tranquiliser.

    I was certainly a tranquil child. I never said "Boo!" to a goose. My parents kept
    several geese, but I never dared say "Boo!" to a single one of them. Frankly,
    they terrified me with their honking and their waddling about and the whiteness
    of their feathers, a whiteness that seemed unearthly. It reminded me of the final
    scene in The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket by Edgar Allan Poe.

    Of course, I was not reminded of this when I was an unlettered tot, it was only
    later, when I learned to read. At first I read childish comics like The Ipsy Dipsy
    Doo and The Hammer of Christ, but I was a keen reader and swiftly moved on to
    Enid Blyton and Enid Blytoff and Enid Blytattheendofthetunnel, before tackling
    Burgess and Borges, and the gloomy Russians, and potboilers by Pebblehead, until,
    at twelve, I read Arthur Gordon Pym, after which I was so unnerved by that whiteness
    that I never read anything else, ever again, just reading Poe''s novel over and
    over again and again. It remains the only book on my bookshelf, which rather obviates
    the need for the space provided by a shelf. Hence I have filled it with plasticine
    models of a pauper and a pea and a princeling.

    I made these models myself, visualising the pauper and the princeling based on
    what little I could remember about my childhood bedtime story, and the pea on
    close observation of a frozen pea I removed from a packet of frozen peas stored
    in the freezer compartment of my refrigerator in my kitchen in my chalet high
    in the Alps near the sanatorium where tubercular patients lie sprawled, exhausted,
    on balconies.

    Among these patients, who I watch through a pair of binoculars, is a fellow with
    a walrus moustache who closely resembles the lumbering psychopathic serial killer
    Babinsky. But it cannot be him. If it were, I like to think I would clamber up
    to his balcony and engage him in conversation and ask him if he, too, grew up
    listening over and over again and again to the tale of the pauper and the princeling
    and the pea. If he had, and if he was indeed Babinsky, it would explain a lot
    about his subsequent career raining violent havoc and mayhem upon the weedy and
    the blameless and the innocent.

    When I tire of watching the Babinsky lookalike, I train my binoculars upon the
    snow-capped Alpine peaks, white, so white, so unutterably, blindingly white.'
