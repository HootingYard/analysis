  text: 'The latest correspondence in the Hooting Yard postbox:

    Dear Mr Key : Your brief list of children''s authors named Enid brought back happy
    memories. I was surprised, however, that you made no mention of my own favourite,
    Enid Blytmyfire. Who can forget her series of books about Little Jim, the shamanic
    singer, poet and counterculture icon, who is revealed as merely a drug-addled
    alcoholic who dies in a bathtub in Paris?'
