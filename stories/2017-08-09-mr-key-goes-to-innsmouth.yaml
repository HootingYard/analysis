  text: 'I write these words with immense difficulty, and in frantic haste. If what
    I believe is true, I have little more than an hour, perhaps two, before my mind
    will lose its moorings, the brain inside my head will be reduced to a twitching
    jelly of miasmic horror, and I will be a hopeless case, raving and gibbering and
    throwing myself against the walls of this padded cell. I am confined here upon
    my own insistence. I had to demand that the lunatic asylum staff lock me up, and
    keep me locked up. If, in an hour or two''s time, I was free to roam the streets
    among other men, I shudder to think what unimaginable chaos and havoc would be
    wrought. No, I must remain here, isolated from a world that must, must be protected
    at all costs from me ... or rather, from the ... thing that I will soon become.

    Can it really be only a week ago that I was sitting at home, surrounded by my
    familiar magnets and retorts and cylinders, in peace and comfort, without a care
    in the world other than the incessant yapping of my neighbour''s dog and the incessant
    tinkling of the bell dangling from the collar round my neighbour''s dog''s neck
    and the incessant ululating incantations of my neighbour himself, incantations
    devised to summon forth the incarnation of the hideous bat-god Fatso, incantations
    which, thank the heavens, had proved unsuccessful for twenty years and which,
    one hoped, would remain unsuccessful for a further twenty years and, indeed, forever
    after? The yapping and tinkling and ululating aside, I was, as I say, in peace
    and comfort, and could never have imagined the inexplicable horror that was about
    to unfold. It has been just one week, but I feel I have lived through a thousand
    years, nay!, a thousand centuries, a thousand millennia in that time.

    It all began, prosaically enough, with the telltale sound of the daily postal
    delivery dropping onto the mat. I put aside the lemon meringue pie I was eating
    and went to retrieve it. I flicked briefly through the items: a couple of bills,
    a letter from my bankers, the latest copy of the Reader''s Digest--I quickly scanned
    the contents page and made a mental note to read, at the earliest opportunity,
    the article about bringing a monkey out of a medically-induced coma--a couple
    of advertising flyers, and--fatefully, as I was to learn--a black envelope, addressed
    by hand in gleaming silver lettering, bearing a postage stamp which, though I
    looked at it from every conceivable angle, and then from several inconceivable
    angles, resisted all attempts to see it clearly. It seemed somehow to shift in
    shape and colour and size, to become invisible and then visible again. I could
    not even tell whether it was self-adhesive or had had to be affixed to the envelope
    with a lick of spittle from a human--or inhuman?--tongue.

    Placing the rest of my post in the wicker basket on my escritoire, I returned
    to the breakfast table, took another mouthful of lemon meringue pie, and opened
    the envelope carefully. The letter inside was unexpectedly ordinary--a single
    sheet of white paper, covered in black handwriting of commendable neatness and
    legibility.

    Dear Mr Key, I read, I have long been an admirer of your Hooting Yard weblog and
    the associated podcasts on Resonance FM. It is an enthusiasm fully shared by my
    colleagues in the Faculty of Blasphemous and Forbidden Studies at Miskatonic University,
    Arkham, from where I write this letter. To be wholly accurate, I should say that
    I am writing from the campus annexe in Innsmouth, where the faculty offices are
    based. Such is our admiration for you that we wish to issue an invitation. There
    is work that needs to be done--important and urgent work--and we think you are
    the man to do it. It is a somewhat delicate matter, and I am reluctant to put
    the details down in writing--and not merely reluctant. Let us say, rather, that
    the prospect of committing those details to pen and paper fills me with a terrible,
    nameless dread. For this reason, I would be grateful if, at your earliest convenience,
    you would telephone me on the number given below.

    The number followed, and the letter was signed--in a florid if shaky hand--by
    Professor Charles Dexter Nyarlathotep, Dean of Faculty. I immediately picked up
    my telephone receiver and dialled.

    After a few rings, there was a click, as if my call had been answered, but no
    one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up when my ear caught a
    faint suspicion of sound. Was someone trying, under great difficulties, to talk?
    As I listened, I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid bubbling noise--"glub ...
    glub ... glub"- which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible, word
    and syllable divisions. I called "Is that Professor Nyarlathotep?" but the only
    answer was "glub-glub ... glub-glub" Then my interlocutor, whoever it was--whatever
    it was--hung up.

    If there is one thing I learned from President Nixon it was the advisability of
    tape-recording all my conversations. (A second thing I learned from him was to
    relieve stress by mashing potatoes, but that was not pertinent to the current
    situation.) I plucked the cassette from the machine and hurried next door. I did
    not go to my ululating neighbour with the yapping dog and the yapping dog''s tinkling
    bell, but to my neighbour on the other side. This fellow happened to be an eminent
    and distinguished retired professor of Comparative and Applied Ichthyolinguistics,
    and I was certain he would be able to help me to understand the strange sounds
    from the telephone call. Sure enough, having played the tape back to him, my neighbour
    was able to make an instant translation.

    "I have communed with many fish and other aquatic beings," he said, "And I recognise
    this at once as the lingua franca of a particularly hideous and unimaginably horrible
    spawn of the chthonic depths of the sea, depths so deep that all light is blotted
    out and the creatures there are grotesque blind albino monsters with writhing
    flippers. One must listen intently to each ''glub'' to discern its meaning. In
    this case, it seems you are being invited to Miskatonic University for the purpose
    of writing the authorised biography of the mad Arab, Abdul Alhazred, author of
    the Necronomicon."

    I thanked the professor, gave him the remainder of my lemon meringue pie, returned
    home, packed a suitcase, and made my way to the railway station, where I caught
    the next train to Arkham. At Arkham, I would need to change trains to proceed
    on the branch line to the university campus annexe at Innsmouth. It was a long
    journey, and I passed the time by reading my xeroxed copy of Ebn Khallikan''s
    early (12th century) biography of Abdul Alhazred. This was the text that claimed,
    among other things, that the mad Arab had been seized by an invisible monster
    in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen
    witnesses. I did not believe a word of this, nor of much else in the book, and
    as the train passed through bosky rustic backwaters, I grew confident that, as
    the authorised biographer, appointed by Miskatonic University, I could do a far
    better job.

    When, eventually, we arrived at Innsmouth, I booked myself into a dilapidated
    and ill-starred boarding house by the quayside. The landlady was a swarthy, bloated
    dwarf of cretinous appearance. I suspected she was the product of centuries of
    inbreeding. When completing the register, she asked me, in her weirdly strangulated
    guttural caterwaul of a voice, punctuated by almost reptilian hisses, to state
    the nature of my business. Rather than trusting her with the truth, I claimed
    to be an aide de camp to President Nixon, scouting possible locations for a branch
    of his presidential library. She scribbled this into her ledger without comment.

    It was late, and I was tired, so I declined the landlady''s offer of supper--which
    appeared to consist of a bowl full of boiled, writhing tentacles swimming in a
    mixture of brine and goat''s milk--and I retired to my room. As I opened the door,
    I reeled and nearly swooned. It was cramped and filthy and the wallpaper depicted
    ungodly patterns, in colours beyond any spectrum known to human science and lines
    and shapes of some bizarre, alien geometry. I flung myself on to the fantastically
    uncomfortable bed and prayed for sleep. For several hours I tossed and turned,
    but eventually I lost consciousness. How I wish I had not! That night, for the
    first time since infancy, my dreams were haunted by ... the Grunty Man!

    Most people of my generation will be familiar with this loathsome monster. It
    was common, when I was a child, for parents to frighten their children to sleep
    with spine-tingling tales of this creature, dwelling in a deep dark dank cave,
    hairy and grunting and covered in sores and suppurating boils, a hideous being
    older than the universe, older than time and space, grunting, drooling, stinking,
    and ever prepared to come lumbering out of the maw of his cave to visit unimaginable
    havoc upon the innocent. He had terrified me as a tiny tot, and he terrified me
    now, the more so because the nightmare was so inexplicably vivid.

    Eventually, mercifully, I awoke from this hideous phantasm. I was twitching and
    shattered. After cursory ablutions, I went downstairs to the breakfast room. When
    I saw that breakfast was the same bowl of tentacles as the supper of the night
    before, I excused myself, and crashed unsteadily out of the door. I decided to
    head straight for the campus to seek out Professor Nyarlathotep. The sooner I
    obtained comprehensive details of my commission, and signed a contract, the sooner
    I could leave this benighted, wretched, vile seaside hellhole.

    After a short bus ride to the campus, it was a simple enough matter to locate
    the Faculty of Blasphemous and Forbidden Studies and, once inside, to find the
    professor''s office. A young woman was sitting at a desk in the anteroom.

    "You must be Mr Key," she said, "I am Miss Dimity Cashew, the professor''s secretary.
    I am afraid he is not here right now He is off somewhere or other, consulting
    an abominable tome written in an unknown and possibly bestial alphabet."

    She was a pallid and asymmetrical figure, with a club foot and one withered leg,
    a withered arm, several extra fingers on one hand and several fingers missing
    on the other, eyes of different colours which seemed always to be looking in wildly
    different directions, and her lank hair was scattered with breadcrumbs and a twig
    or two. I was transfixed. My dementedly thumping heart seemed ready to burst from
    my breast. I could barely speak, but I managed to splutter some incoherent words.
    Dimity agreed to join me for a stroll along the Innsmouth promenade.

    It was a whirlwind romance, and five days later we were married in St Bibblybibdib''s
    church. Only on the morning after our wedding night did I snap out of my lovestruck
    daze and remember why I had come to Innsmouth in the first place.

    "The authorised biography of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred!" I cried, "I must go
    to see the professor at once!"

    These words had a strange effect on my new bride. Dimity seemed to shrink visibly
    and clutched desperately at the bedsheets. Already pallid, what little colour
    there was drained from her face. She shook her head violently, sending twigs and
    breadcrumbs flying from her lank hair across the room. And then, for the first
    time since I had met her, both of her eyes swivelled to fix in the same direction,
    and she looked straight at me.

    "For god''s sake!" she screamed, "Phn''glui mglw''nafh! Wgah''fhtagn! The pit
    of the shoggoths! Down the six thousand steps ... the abomination of abominations
    ... I never would let him take me, and then I found myself there! Ia! Shub-Niggurath!
    The Hooded Thing bleated ''Kamog! Kamog!'' In the place of utter blasphemy! I
    can''t stand it! I can''t stand it! My brain! It''s tugging--from beyond--knocking--clawing--Ngr''hfglkhar!
    The Goat with a Thousand Young! ... Oh God!"

    Like a fool, I dismissed this as delirium, a fit of the vapours. I told Dimity
    to have a nice cup of tea and to get some more sleep. And I hurried out towards
    the faculty office ... and, had I but known it, towards my own destruction.

    There is little more to tell. I ran to the faculty building and through into the
    anteroom, past Dimity''s empty desk, until I stood at the professor''s door. I
    knocked, and heard from inside a weird eldritch unfathomable rustling and panting
    and ... grunting. I threw open the door, and rushed in, and found myself in a
    room as deep and dark and dank as the cave of the Grunty Man. It was the cave
    of the Grunty Man! And there, in the Stygian blackness, looming before me, was
    the Grunty Man himself, in the form of the withered, ancient figure of Professor
    Nyarlathotep.

    "Ah! At last!" he wheezed, "I have been waiting for you. Every ten thousand years,
    I require a new host body. And here you are!"

    And before I had time to scream, or flee, the hideous being shot across the darkness
    towards me and somehow inserted itself, body and soul, its very being, into me.
    I felt it settle, adjusting its horrible contours to mine, feeling its way into
    me, physically and mentally. Desperately, I clung on to a small corner of my brain
    that remained my own. I have continued to cling to it for as long as I can, but
    I grow weaker and weaker, and the ''me'' that clings will soon be no more. That
    is why I ran as fast as I could to this lunatic asylum and, at gunpoint, demanded
    to be confined in a padded cell. Its walls and locks will keep humanity safe for
    a time. But the time will come, years, centuries hence, when the locks will rust
    and the walls crumble ... and then the Grunty Man will lumber forth, in his awful
    grunting horror, and he shall have dominion over the earth, and all the other
    planets in all the other universes, forever and ever. I am the Grunty Man!'
