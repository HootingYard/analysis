  text: 'It is one of the enduring mysteries of contemporary life. How can it be,
    I hear you cry, that there is not a blockbusting Hollywood franchise based on
    Hooting Yard? Imagine for a moment that there existed a dimwitted action-packed
    film, filled with CGI explosions and the like, in the spirit of, say, Alien vs.
    Predator, but in this instance called Babinsky vs. The Grunty Man. Clearly the
    moviegoing hordes would be queueing up at multiplexes across the land to lose
    themselves for two and a half hours in such a spectacle. So why has Mr Key not
    yet had a call from a Hollywood mogul? It is, as I say, an enduring mystery.

    I am sure, too, that a film entitled Tiny Enid : Plucky Tot could spawn an endless
    string of sequels. Come on, Hollywood! Get your act together!

    To date, only the visionary film-maker Miss HatHorn has used Hooting Yard as her
    source. If you have not yet seen A Recipe For Gruel, watch it now.'
