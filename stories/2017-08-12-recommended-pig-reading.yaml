    This magnificent book, packed with piggery, tells us, among much else, that

    old-fashioned pigs ... are extremely likeable characters. They are highly intelligent,
    exceedingly amiable ... and will follow you about like a dog. They have a keen
    sense of the absurd and will suddenly take off in a collective giddy fit, twirling
    round and round to the accompaniment of hoarse pantings, guffaws, it might almost
    be said, of merriment.'
