  text: "\nThis magnificent book, packed with piggery, tells us, among much else,\
    \ that\nold-fashioned pigs \u2026 are extremely likeable characters. They are\
    \ highly intelligent, exceedingly amiable \u2026 and will follow you about like\
    \ a dog. They have a keen sense of the absurd and will suddenly take off in a\
    \ collective giddy fit, twirling round and round to the accompaniment of hoarse\
    \ pantings, guffaws, it might almost be said, of merriment."
