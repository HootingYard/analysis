    There is a song about a lonely goatherd with which I am sure many of you are familiar.
    This goatherd is usually represented by a puppet (above). We are fortunate to
    have a picture--indeed, film!--of the lonely goatherd puppet, for there are other
    noteworthy goatherd puppets of which no images exist. I refer to the Blots, a
    family of goatherds unparalleled  in their rapacity, shadow puppets of whom were
    devised by the shadow puppeteer Jasper Weems.

    Weems told the story of the Blots through the medium of shadow puppetry. Let us
    retell it here, using words.

    The Blots had been goatherds in the Swiss Alps for generations. Their lives were,
    and always had been, narrow, pinched, and poor. Then, one day in 1964, the current
    patriarch of the family, Hans Blot, came upon a newspaper report of a meeting
    of British Labour Party politicians. One of their number, George Brown, had apparently
    made reference to the gnomes of Zurich. His interest piqued, Hans Blot read further,
    and learned that these gnomes, residing in Switzerland''s largest city, were exceedingly
    wealthy.

    Hans Blot, who was a goatherd unparalleled in his rapacity, saw an opportunity
    to turn around his family''s fortunes. Instead of scraping a living herding goats,
    the Blots could borrow money from the gnomes and ... well, he did not immediately
    form a plan, but he felt sure that he could turn a modest loan from the gnomes
    into an enormous pile of cash somehow or other, given his unparalleled rapacity.

    Blot did not set off for Zurich right away. First, he drilled the family in the
    tenets of anthroposophy as expounded by Rudolf Steiner. This was necessary, Blot
    thought, because he assumed the gnomes of Zurich were the invisible gnomes who
    live among men but cannot be perceived by the common riffraff, such as goatherds,
    only becoming visible to those on a higher plane of human existence, such as Rudolf
    Steiner.

    The Blots, driven by their unparalleled rapacity, studied hard, and before long,
    believing they might now be able to perceive the invisible gnomes, set off for
    Zurich. Upon arrival, they trooped into the first bank they saw, and were delighted
    when they realised they could see the gnomes with absolute clarity. Hans Blot
    proceeded to ask for a loan of money. Though the gnomes of Zurich--who were of
    course not Steinerian gnomes at all, and were visible to everybody--did not lend
    out money willy-nilly, they recognised the gleam of greed in Hans Blot''s eyes.
    Such unparalleled rapacity, they felt, was worthy of their regard. The Blots left
    Zurich with pockets full of cash.

    As winter drew in, they spent long evenings huddled in their noisome goatherders''
    hovel trying to think up ways to use the loan to, in the words of an accountant,
    generate a regular revenue stream. Then, on a blizzard-wracked night, one of the
    younger Blots, Hansi, as rapacious as her grandfather, had a brainwave.

    You know, just up the mountain, she babbled in excitement, there is the chalet
    of the Prix Poubelle-winning writer N K Freaky. He has his own private funicular
    railway. We could buy it from him, and then gouge oodles of cash by charging exorbitant
    funicular railway fares!

    All the Blots agreed this was a brilliant idea. And over the next five years,
    they bought more and more funicular railways, not only in the Swiss Alps but in
    the Austrian and Italian Alps too, and charged their passengers ever-increasing
    fares for journeys up and down those sublime snow-topped peaks.

    But such was their unparalleled rapacity the Blots were reluctant ever to part
    with a pfennig. When it came time to repay their loan to the gnomes of Zurich,
    the Blots simply ignored the demands that plopped through the letterbox of their
    Alpine hovel. Eventually, the gnomes lost patience. After a secretive conference
    in a secret chamber in their secretive bank, the gnomes of Zurich fastened upon
    a terrible resolution. They hired a gang of invisible Steinerian gnomes, who one
    night burst, unperceived, into the Blots'' hovel, and slaughtered them in their
    beds, each and every one, from Hans to Hansi.

    The foregoing cannot, of course, do justice to the vivid shadow puppetry of Jasper
    Weems'' shadow puppet version of the story of the Blot family, but I hope it has
    afforded you a modicum of entertainment.'
