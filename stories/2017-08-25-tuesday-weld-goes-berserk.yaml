  text: "\nTuesday Weld Goes Berserk is the title of a puppet show created by the\
    \ noted glove-puppeteer Dot Glovepup. It acts as a companion piece to her earlier,\
    \ award-winning show Googie Withers Goes Haywire, and has proved equally controversial.\
    \ Both shows are clearly indebted to the traditional Punch And Judy format, with\
    \ squeaky, braying voices and demented violence. Dot Glovepup has been forced,\
    \ in both cases, to add a prominent programme note declaring that \u201Cany resemblance\
    \ to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental\u201D.\nTuesday Weld\
    \ Goes Berserk is divided into three acts. In the first, the Tuesday Weld glove\
    \ puppet is presented as calm, placid, and peaceable. Indeed, one could say that\
    \ she is wholly inert, the better to contrast with the \u201Cgoing berserk\u201D\
    \ which follows. This opening scene lasts anywhere between four and fourteen seconds,\
    \ depending\u2014according to the glove-puppeteer\u2014on the mood of the audience.\n\
    In Act Two, Tuesday Weld gets married to the British pianist, actor, and comedian\
    \ Dudley Moore. She then goes berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock\
    \ filled with pellets of lead and then shoving him down a well. Immediately afterwards,\
    \ Tuesday Weld marries the Israeli violinist and conductor Pinchas Zukerman. She\
    \ proceeds to go berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock filled with\
    \ wet impacted sand and then shoving him down a mineshaft.\nIn Act Three, a police\
    \ officer attempts to arrest Tuesday Weld, but she scampers away and, dressed\
    \ in a pink duffel coat, goes cavorting at nightfall on the beach at Deal, skipping\
    \ about and waving her arms before mincing along the pier and vomiting into the\
    \ sea, an obvious reference to the haunting image of Carry On actor Charles Hawtrey\
    \ described in the closing pages of All The Devils Are Here by David Seabrook\
    \ (Granta, 2002).\nCritics have questioned the absence from the puppet show of\
    \ Tuesday Weld's first husband, Claude Harz. Dot Glovepup, interviewed for the\
    \ magazine Characters Ignored In Glove Puppet Shows Weekly, hinted that he may\
    \ appear in a planned \u201Cprequel\u201D glove puppet show featuring both Tuesday\
    \ Weld and Googie Withers.\nTuesday Weld Goes Berserk is currently showing at\
    \ a temporary kiosk at the end of the pier at Deal. Admission is free to those\
    \ wearing pink duffel coats.\nNOTA BENE\_: In the text above, any resemblance\
    \ to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental."
