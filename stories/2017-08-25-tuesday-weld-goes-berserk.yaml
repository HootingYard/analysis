    Tuesday Weld Goes Berserk is the title of a puppet show created by the noted glove-puppeteer
    Dot Glovepup. It acts as a companion piece to her earlier, award-winning show
    Googie Withers Goes Haywire, and has proved equally controversial. Both shows
    are clearly indebted to the traditional Punch And Judy format, with squeaky, braying
    voices and demented violence. Dot Glovepup has been forced, in both cases, to
    add a prominent programme note declaring that "any resemblance to actual persons,
    living or dead, is purely coincidental".

    Tuesday Weld Goes Berserk is divided into three acts. In the first, the Tuesday
    Weld glove puppet is presented as calm, placid, and peaceable. Indeed, one could
    say that she is wholly inert, the better to contrast with the "going berserk"
    which follows. This opening scene lasts anywhere between four and fourteen seconds,
    depending--according to the glove-puppeteer--on the mood of the audience.

    In Act Two, Tuesday Weld gets married to the British pianist, actor, and comedian
    Dudley Moore. She then goes berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock filled
    with pellets of lead and then shoving him down a well. Immediately afterwards,
    Tuesday Weld marries the Israeli violinist and conductor Pinchas Zukerman. She
    proceeds to go berserk, bashing him around the head with a sock filled with wet
    impacted sand and then shoving him down a mineshaft.

    In Act Three, a police officer attempts to arrest Tuesday Weld, but she scampers
    away and, dressed in a pink duffel coat, goes cavorting at nightfall on the beach
    at Deal, skipping about and waving her arms before mincing along the pier and
    vomiting into the sea, an obvious reference to the haunting image of Carry On
    actor Charles Hawtrey described in the closing pages of All The Devils Are Here
    by David Seabrook (Granta, 2002).

    Critics have questioned the absence from the puppet show of Tuesday Weld''s first
    husband, Claude Harz. Dot Glovepup, interviewed for the magazine Characters Ignored
    In Glove Puppet Shows Weekly, hinted that he may appear in a planned "prequel"
    glove puppet show featuring both Tuesday Weld and Googie Withers.

    Tuesday Weld Goes Berserk is currently showing at a temporary kiosk at the end
    of the pier at Deal. Admission is free to those wearing pink duffel coats.
