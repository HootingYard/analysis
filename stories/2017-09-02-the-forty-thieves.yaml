  text: 'I was at a loose end, staring out of the window looking at crows, and my
    mind turned to Ali Baba and his Forty Thieves. With a start, I realised how little
    I knew about them. As luck would have it, the very next day at a rummage sale
    I picked up a copy of a privately-printed pamphlet by Knud Padde, described on
    the title page as a Lecturer in Arabian Thievery Studies at the University of
    Ack-on-the-Vug, or possibly the University of Vug-on-the-Ack. Here is his list
    of the Forty Thieves, together with "preliminary notes" on each thief.

    Corky--a hireling thief, a chump, a talc-powdered wastrel.

    Mutcho--greasy, vindictive, base.

    Ibster--looms terrible in dreams, licks ice cream cones.

    Guff--the boffin of the gang, and sniper, and Tippi Hedren''s penpal,

    Spoors--great galumphing fool, Oppidan, thimble-fumbler.

    Waxy--waxy.

    Geraldo--of monstrous girth, of lively demeanour, of hand-stitched tunics.

    Carsten--polishes off raisins, swigs tap water, goes shod in clogs.

    Fang--inhabits palatial apartments with his wolf and his minuets.

    Sudbury--exists on a higher plane, thumps things, distressed.

    Oswin--suffers fools gladly, hung out to dry.

    Bantock--dustpan and brush man, Hotspur, clackety rhythm.

    Mort--hedger, was a water-bailiff, albino.

    Chippy--wanting eggs.

    Hardcastle--fevered brow, distorted spine, curly ringlets.

    Aptod--when first he flew he blundered into branches of dark trees.

    Shopworn--lacks the common touch, hoist by petards, a darling.

    Urbane--urbane yet ditzy, polka-dotted, ruminant.

    Dobbin--pumped gas back in Montana, unbridled savagery, lacks depth.

    Inky--several contradictory reports, buff-coloured envelope, chalk dust.

    Hig--shallow, potted, wet.

    Anglepoise--Jesuit upbringing, weather station, tarred with broad brush.

    Snapper--bolt upright, sprained ankles, Maoist.

    Boomer--booming voice, bloody nose, best before dusk.

    Chepstow--owls nest in his hair, he plays the piccolo, he eats mashed potato.

    Zigzoo--champs at bits, stinks of Jarlsberger, often with conifers.

    Delmore--lurid, spiteful, mechanical.

    Esher--flabby, subject to fits, member of Tuesday Weld Fan Club.

    Jetboy--likely to be found upon rotating things in park playgrounds.

    Casement--proudly lumpen, secretly engaged to a flapper, podcaster.

    Uck--abnormal alignment of head upon neck, neck grubby, hair unwashed.

    Fig--a stone''s throw from the sea, green about the gills, hot to trot.

    Straubenzee--sings the songs his mother taught him in that Darmstadt nursery.

    Fogbound--clatters to and fro, goes haywire, made of cement.

    Wailywaily--hidden behind shutters, brilliantine in his hair, indiscreet.

    Burgess--over by the ice rink, underneath the arches, powered by batteries.

    Mudguard--guards mud.

    Pepinstow--thunderous hooves, brilliant plumage, exquisite table manners.

    Dixon--marimba, clutching at straws, gin slings and blood oranges.

    Quangocrat--double helpings of sausage-shaped dough snacks.

    This is a slightly revised version of a piece which originally appeared in 2011.'
