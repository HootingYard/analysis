  text: "I was at a loose end, staring out of the window looking at crows, and my\
    \ mind turned to Ali Baba and his Forty Thieves. With a start, I realised how\
    \ little I knew about them. As luck would have it, the very next day at a rummage\
    \ sale I picked up a copy of a privately-printed pamphlet by Knud Padde, described\
    \ on the title page as a Lecturer in Arabian Thievery Studies at the University\
    \ of Ack-on-the-Vug, or possibly the University of Vug-on-the-Ack. Here is his\
    \ list of the Forty Thieves, together with \u201Cpreliminary notes\u201D on each\
    \ thief.\nCorky\u2014a hireling thief, a chump, a talc-powdered wastrel.\nMutcho\u2014\
    greasy, vindictive, base.\nIbster\u2014looms terrible in dreams, licks ice cream\
    \ cones.\nGuff\u2014the boffin of the gang, and sniper, and Tippi Hedren's penpal,\n\
    Spoors\u2014great galumphing fool, Oppidan, thimble-fumbler.\nWaxy\u2014waxy.\n\

    inhabits palatial apartments with his wolf and his minuets.\nSudbury\u2014exists\
    \ on a higher plane, thumps things, distressed.\nOswin\u2014suffers fools gladly,\
    \ hung out to dry.\nBantock\u2014dustpan and brush man, Hotspur, clackety rhythm.\n\
    Mort\u2014hedger, was a water-bailiff, albino.\nChippy\u2014wanting eggs.\nHardcastle\u2014\
    fevered brow, distorted spine, curly ringlets.\nAptod\u2014when first he flew\
    \ he blundered into branches of dark trees.\nShopworn\u2014lacks the common touch,\
    \ hoist by petards, a darling.\nUrbane\u2014urbane yet ditzy, polka-dotted, ruminant.\n\
    Dobbin\u2014pumped gas back in Montana, unbridled savagery, lacks depth.\nInky\u2014\
    several contradictory reports, buff-coloured envelope, chalk dust.\nHig\u2014\

    \ with broad brush.\nSnapper\u2014bolt upright, sprained ankles, Maoist.\nBoomer\u2014\

    \ the sea, green about the gills, hot to trot.\nStraubenzee\u2014sings the songs\
    \ his mother taught him in that Darmstadt nursery.\nFogbound\u2014clatters to\
    \ and fro, goes haywire, made of cement.\nWailywaily\u2014hidden behind shutters,\
