  text: "I am the Mudguard. I guard the mud. And, boy!, there is an awful lot of mud.\
    \ It's a full-time job.\nThe mud covers a large rectangular area on the outskirts\
    \ of town, just beyond the duckpond and the viaduct. It is known locally as \u201C\
    the muddy field\u201D, though its official name is Plunkett's Meadow. Nobody living\
    \ calls it that, but the name is shown on old maps of the area.\nI patrol the\
    \ perimeter of the field from dawn till dusk, day in day out, and sometimes at\
    \ night too, for example when the regime has declared a state of emergency. At\
    \ such times I am provided with extra supplies of strong black coffee and/or cans\
    \ of fizzy pop infused with chemicals designed to stimulate the nerves.\nBecause\
    \ of the long hours, and because I am the only mudguard, I live on site, or as\
    \ near as dammit, in a hut, or chalet, slap bang next to the muddy field. It is,\
    \ alas, far, far from the sea, but I keep on my bookshelf several paperbacks by\
    \ Herman Melville and Joseph Conrad. They have a briny smell, having been dipped\
    \ in seawater and dried by sea-squalls.\nMy uniform is best described as a blouse\
    \ and pantaloons. It is a foolish outfit, and often the object of ridicule by\
    \ wayfaring strangers. To cut a long story short, the Mud Bureau Chef d'Affaires\
    \ was a fanatical devotee of Spandau Ballet early in their career. That much is\
    \ true. I have grown used to the hysterical laughter of passers-by and no longer\
    \ bother to throw pebbles at them.\nOn a typical day, I rise from my pallet before\
    \ dawn, ablute, eat a slap-up breakfast in which sausages play an important part,\
    \ put on my preposterous uniform, and am ready to begin my first patrol as the\
    \ sun comes up. Brave Helios!, etcetera etcetera. I prance along each side of\
    \ the muddy field, first clockwise then anti-clockwise, keeping an eye out for\
    \ anybody or anything that might imperil the mud. I then take a break, perched\
    \ on a stool outside my chalet for five minutes, but remaining vigilant. I then\
    \ conduct the second patrol of the day, armed with a pointy stick. And so it goes\
    \ on, until nightfall. It is very satisfying work.\nOnce a week, I receive a visit\
    \ from a senior official of the Mud Bureau. It is rarely the same official. They\
    \ go about their business in plain clothes, the only sign of their status being\
    \ a small lapel badge. This depicts a patch of mud, above which hovers a disembodied\
    \ head. I think this is intended to be a generic human head, but for my money\
    \ it bears an arresting resemblance to Tony Hadley (b. 1960), the lead singer\
    \ of Spandau Ballet. The official interrogates me, under a Klieg light, about\
    \ each patrol of the previous week. I furnish the details using an agreed code,\
    \ in which sausages play an important part. There is then a little break, during\
    \ which we might chat about Melville and Conrad, if the official is sea-brained,\
    \ or other matters, if not. For example we might talk about stamp collecting or\
    \ foopball or the transubstantiation of the host in the Catholic Mass in Tudor\
    \ times. During these discussions, the Klieg light is switched off.\nAs mud goes,\
    \ the mud I guard in the muddy field, aka Plunkett's Meadow, is pretty ordinary\
    \ mud. I cannot claim to have studied it in any great detail, but as far as I\
    \ am able to ascertain it has no particular features which would distinguish it\
    \ from other mud, in other muddy fields, if there are any, elsewhere in the land,\
    \ say on the other side of town, by the fireworks factory and the hen coops, or\
    \ even further afield, blimey!, in remote areas such as the Security Zone, out\
    \ towards the sea, which sloshes against the shore, where gulls screech.\nWithout\
    \ wishing to boast, I must say that I am damned good at my job. To date, I have\
    \ guarded the mud with resounding success, in that it has not been imperilled\
    \ in any way by malefactors and ne'er-do-wells, whose numbers are legion, in spite\
    \ of regular round-ups by the secret police. I can say with pride that the mud\
    \ is safe under my watch, a watch shortly to reach its fortieth year of service.\
    \ I am looking forward to receiving, on the anniversary, my commemorative award,\
    \ a gorgeous cummerbund.\nI am the Mudguard. I guard the mud."
