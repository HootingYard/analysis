  text: "\nThe communist regimes of the last century threw up their fair share of\
    \ monsters, among whom Pol Pot was one of the more demented. His Khmer Rouge came\
    \ to power in Cambodia in 1976. By the time they were overthrown, three years\
    \ later, around a quarter of the population had perished.\nPol Pot had a vision\
    \ of a sort of peasant utopia. Accordingly, towns and cities were emptied and\
    \ the people marched out into the countryside to work on collective farms. He\
    \ had a particular animus towards \u201Cbourgeois intellectuals\u201D, a group\
    \ which apparently included anybody who wore glasses. Of course, surprise surprise,\
    \ Pol Pot was such an \u201Cintellectual\u201D himself. As a young man, he studied\
    \ in Paris, from 1949 to 1953.\nThere is an instructive story from his time in\
    \ France. Already the first glimmerings of his agrarian revolution were swirling\
    \ around in Pol Pot's brain, and an associate suggested he ought to get out of\
    \ Paris and investigate French farming methods. Pol Pot thus headed off, deep\
    \ into rural France, and went to stay\u2014uninvited\u2014with a dairy farmer.\n\
    For a couple of days, the future tyrant followed the farmer about, observing him\
    \ at work. This, it seemed, taught Pol Pot all he needed to know. On the third\
    \ day, over breakfast, he launched into a Marxist critique of the farmer's age-old\
    \ rustic ways. He could, he explained, order the cows to do exactly as they were\
    \ told, just as he would go on to bend the people of Cambodia to his will. The\
    \ wise old French farmer scoffed.\n\u201CYou do not understand,\u201D said Pol\
    \ Pot, never short on self-belief, \u201CYour cows will obey my every word. For\
    \ I speak the language of cows!\u201D\nThe farmer chuckled at the young Cambodian\
    \ upstart, took a last sip of his breakfast brandy, and went out to his barn.\
    \ He opened the doors, and the cows mooched off across his fields to munch grass.\n\
    At this point, Pol Pot appeared at his side. He announced that he would make all\
    \ the cows return to the barn tout suite, simply by issuing a verbal diktat. He\
    \ then uttered, at deafening volume, a strange guttural Cambodian cow incantation.\
    \ To the farmer's astonishment, the cows ceased munching, looked up, and, at almost\
    \ uncanny speed, charged across the fields and returned to the barn.\nIt was a\
    \ classic case of Pot calling the cattle back."
