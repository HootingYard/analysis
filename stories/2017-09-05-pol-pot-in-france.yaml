    The communist regimes of the last century threw up their fair share of monsters,
    among whom Pol Pot was one of the more demented. His Khmer Rouge came to power
    in Cambodia in 1976. By the time they were overthrown, three years later, around
    a quarter of the population had perished.

    Pol Pot had a vision of a sort of peasant utopia. Accordingly, towns and cities
    were emptied and the people marched out into the countryside to work on collective
    farms. He had a particular animus towards "bourgeois intellectuals", a group which
    apparently included anybody who wore glasses. Of course, surprise surprise, Pol
    Pot was such an "intellectual" himself. As a young man, he studied in Paris, from
    1949 to 1953.

    There is an instructive story from his time in France. Already the first glimmerings
    of his agrarian revolution were swirling around in Pol Pot''s brain, and an associate
    suggested he ought to get out of Paris and investigate French farming methods.
    Pol Pot thus headed off, deep into rural France, and went to stay--uninvited--with
    a dairy farmer.

    For a couple of days, the future tyrant followed the farmer about, observing him
    at work. This, it seemed, taught Pol Pot all he needed to know. On the third day,
    over breakfast, he launched into a Marxist critique of the farmer''s age-old rustic
    ways. He could, he explained, order the cows to do exactly as they were told,
    just as he would go on to bend the people of Cambodia to his will. The wise old
    French farmer scoffed.

    "You do not understand," said Pol Pot, never short on self-belief, "Your cows
    will obey my every word. For I speak the language of cows!"

    The farmer chuckled at the young Cambodian upstart, took a last sip of his breakfast
    brandy, and went out to his barn. He opened the doors, and the cows mooched off
    across his fields to munch grass.

    At this point, Pol Pot appeared at his side. He announced that he would make all
    the cows return to the barn tout suite, simply by issuing a verbal diktat. He
    then uttered, at deafening volume, a strange guttural Cambodian cow incantation.
    To the farmer''s astonishment, the cows ceased munching, looked up, and, at almost
    uncanny speed, charged across the fields and returned to the barn.

    It was a classic case of Pot calling the cattle back.'
