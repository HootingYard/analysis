    Daniel Barenboim has won many plaudits for his creation of the West-Eastern Divan
    Orchestra, bringing together young musicians from different countries in the Middle
    East to promote the cause of peace. Laudable as his efforts are, several observers
    have noted that the world of classical music is too small and narrow to have real
    societal heft. Pop music, they say, is the lingua franca that can genuinely bring
    people of different faiths together. To this end, and as a faltering first step
    in resolving the simmering civil war between the two major branches of Islam,
    a new single has been released. It is a new version of "I Got You Babe" by Sunni
    and Shia.'
