  text: "Can it be that a quarter of a century has passed since the publication of\
    \ the Hooting Yard Calendar 1992? Tempus bloody well fugit, and no mistake. The\
    \ calendar that year was entitled \u201CAccidental Deaths Of Twelve Cartographers\u201D\
    , and here is one such accidental death, that of Underbath, who, we are told,\
    \ was impaled by a javelin in Bodger's Spinney on February the fifth 1907.\n"
