    There are now more than 100 episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air available for
    your listening pleasure on Mixcloud. This means you could shove some headphones
    over your ears and listen to Mr Key babbling for two whole days without a break,
    and there would still be more to come. What bliss!

    Yesterday the umpteenth series began with this thrilling broadcast. Please note
    that the audio remains obstinately silent until about one minute in, due to technical
    gubbins beyond my puny understanding. Thereafter, you can listen to readings of
    When I Was Borp, Expulsion Of The Fools From The Orchsrd, Pierre Et Clothilde,
    Pierre Et Les Pantoufles (featuring Plastic Bertrand) and The Pauper And The Princeling
    And The Pea.

    As ever, your monetary donations are more than welcome. Hit that Donate button
    over on the right, daddy-o!'
