    Last night I dreamt I went to the Nocturnal Pig Observatory again. But it was
    one of those dreams where everything happens in bright and battering sunlight.
    This made it particularly disturbing, because, with the exception of the unfamiliar
    light, everything else in the dream matched my memories of those times. I sat
    at the console, twiddling the knobs. I made adjustments to the pig scanner with
    a pair of pliers. I gazed out through the pig-proof plexiglass observation panel,
    while making indentations in my tally-stick.

    One other detail that jarred was the presence, within the Observatory, of an albino
    chicken. I think it may have been a Vanbrugh chicken. It was so white, and the
    sunlight so glaring, that the chicken seemed to shimmer, like one imagines an
    Angel of the Lord come to earth upon a visitation.

    I saw no pigs, so in that sense again the dream had an air of brute reality. Not
    once, in all my years of duty at the Nocturnal Pig Observatory, did I ever spot
    a real pig. Sham ones, yes, of course, and puppet pigs, and ghosts of pigs. But
    never a real, solid, porker. The flat wild bleak desolate windswept tarputa is
    inimical to pigs, thank heaven, but we must always be on the watch. Or at least
    we used to be, back in those days, when we were pig ignorant.

    Now things have changed, many say for the better. Much of the tarputa is no longer
    as flat and wild and bleak and desolate and windswept as once it was. There are
    ice cream kiosks and miniature zoos and an aerodrome. There is a huge cement statue,
    on a plinth, of star of stage and screen Googie Withers (1917--2011). There is
    even, mischievously, an extensive modern state-of-the-art pig sty, though it is
    of course empty of pigs, including sham and puppet and ghost pigs.

    Or is it? One would have to creep up to the edge of the pig sty in darkness, on
    a moonless night, and train one''s portable pig scanner upon the most likely ghost-haunted
    parts of the sty, and wait, in silence and awe, for a sighting, to be duly recorded
    in one''s ghost pig log, with a notch indented on one''s tally-stick. Who among
    us can say we are truly prepared for such a task?

    Since I awoke, I have been thinking, like a man obsessed, about that shimmering
    albino chicken. What did its dream-presence portend? I can wring no sense from
    it, as I prance like a ninny across the tarputa, on my way to buy a choc-ice from
    the kiosk, and to lay a bouquet of gladioli upon the cement feet of Googie Withers.
    That will make my Thursday complete. And when I settle down to sleep, will I dream
    of the Nocturnal Pig Observatory again? Will the past haunt me still? Do I dare
    to eat a peach? Is there honey still for tea? Where have all the flowers gone?
    What''s so funny ''bout pigs, love, and understanding?'
