  text: 'Last night I dreamt I went to Urk again. Have you ever been to Urk, wide
    awake or in your dreams? You would surely remember if you had. Urk is a unique
    place, a tiny Belgian exclave oh! so high in the Alps. More precisely, it is an
    exclave of the province of Flanders, though its tiny population includes a tiny
    proportion of Walloons.

    Urkites are known to state, with pride, that "nothing ever happens" in Urk. That
    is largely true. It is so tiny, and so high above sea level, in contrast to the
    rest of Flanders, that very little of note has ever occurred there. Its official
    history, available from the kiosk in the street (both singular), runs to a four-page
    pamphlet printed in very big type, one-and-a-half pages of which consist of advertisements.
    And the pages themselves are tiny! Just as the kiosk is tiny and the street is
    short.

    Urk never signed up to the European Union''s Schengen Treaty, so visitors--if
    there are any--still need to show their passports at the frontier. This is a chalet
    at the foot of the funicular railway which climbs up, up, up, at dizzying steepness,
    to the village, where the air is thin and the police officer is idle.

    As one alights from the railway, one is thrust almost immediately into the heart
    of Urk. This is the village square. It is a patch of well-tended lawn, with a
    flowerbed rife with tulips, and a tiny concrete statue of tiptop Belgian cyclist
    Eddy Merckx. It is here you will also find, slumped on a bench, at all hours of
    day and night, the Blind Goose-Killer of Urk.

    When the exclave was founded, by a smattering of Belgian tuberculosis patients
    over a hundred years ago, it was decreed that only one person in Urk was permitted
    to kill a goose, and that this person must be blind. All the other laws governing
    the territory were imported wholesale from Flanders. The origins of the goose-killing
    edict are obscure, and may have resulted from a misunderstanding. Whatever the
    case, there has always and forever been a designated Blind Goose-Killer in Urk.
    It is a lifetime position, one of great honour but paltry reward.

    What happens is this. Let us say you are in Urk and you wish to make a goose die.
    You must go to the bench in the square and rouse the Blind Goose-Killer, who is
    probably dozing. You introduce yourself, presenting your identity papers, if you
    are an Urkite, or your passport, if you are a visitor. The Blind Goose-Killer
    cannot, of course, see these documents, but will enact what is known as "the sniffing
    and the rustling of the pages".

    You must then state, in Flemish, that you wish a goose to be killed, and ask the
    Blind Goose-Killer to kill the goose for you. Almost invariably, and while still
    half-asleep, the Blind Goose-Killer will accede to your request, although once
    in a blue moon, or if in an ill temper, or if bilious, he or she will refuse.
    Assuming the answer is positive, you must then go and fetch the goose you want
    killed.

    You hand the goose to the Blind Goose-Killer. Apart from blindness, another characteristic
    shared by all who have held the position is the possession of a pair of hands
    with eerie, vaguely inhuman musculature. Once in the grip of these hands, the
    goose cannot escape its fate. You could say its goose is cooked, though that introduces
    a second, putative, abstract goose, which is one goose too many, and may serve
    to befuddle the Blind Goose-Killer, so is best left unsaid.

    As soon as it has been strangled, you take the dead goose from the Blind Goose-Killer
    and offer your thanks. Although they are in receipt of an annual stipend from
    the burghers of Urk, you should give them some loose change as a tip.

    As I said, last night I dreamt I went to Urk again. It was a disturbing dream,
    more of a nightmare. The entire tiny exclave was overrun with living, honking,
    dazzlingly white geese. And there, on the bench in the square, was slumped the
    Blind Goose-Killer, torn and bloody and lifeless. He had been pecked to death.'
