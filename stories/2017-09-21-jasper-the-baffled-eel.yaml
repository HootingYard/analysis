  text: 'Jasper The Baffled Eel is a brand new children''s book about an eel named
    Jasper who is baffled. What baffles him? Oh, just about everything that happens
    in his life as an eel. I don''t need to go into the details, as I am sure you
    can imagine yourself as an eel and tally up in your head all the things that would
    baffle you.

    I say it is a children''s book, and that is indeed how it has been marketed by
    the soulless twerps in the marketing department of the publishing house. But I
    suspect the book may appeal more to older readers, very old readers, those in
    or approaching their dotage. It may even prove popular among those who have passed
    beyond dotage into death. At rest and encoffined, what better token of life to
    take with them, clutched in their cold stiff hands, than this baffling eely book?

    There are no illustrations. Most of the words are simple ones, of one or two syllables,
    with only a few instances of longer or less common words, among which I noted
    flapdoodle, japonaiserie, and haemoglobin. Jasper the eel is baffled by these
    words, but you will not be, not even if you are dead, because nothing baffles
    the dead.

    They say walls have ears, but birds and eels do not. They also say that Jesus
    wants me for a sunbeam, but try telling that to an eel. You will only baffle the
    eel, as Jasper is baffled, in a bravura display of realism. It may even be hyperrealism.
    There were certainly points in the book where I felt, vividly, that I had been
    plunged into the wide Sargasso sea. I was sopping wet and festooned with seaweed.
    Though it is fair to say that I am usually sopping and festooned, when reading
    books. It is, and always has been, my way.

    Oh, Jasper! Jasper! Poor baffled eel. No longer a glass eel or an elver, with
    its life stretching before it, full of promise, but a full-grown adult eel, lost
    in the immensity of the world''s oceans and seas and rivers and lakes and other
    watery parts, watery parts that cover seven-tenths of this globe, with its magnetic
    bits and its vegetation and its eels. For Jasper is not alone.

    But he is alone, in this book. Population of eels in its pages--one. One eel,
    but oh! how he fills those pages, turning up once, twice, even three times before
    it is time for you to turn the leaf. And that is not surprising, because this
    is his story. No other eel gets a look in, and nor does any other living creature,
    other than occasional mentions of a rabbit and a plover and a brass-necked goose.
    But these are incidental beings. They will, one day, have their own books, in
    which Jasper the eel may make a fleeting appearance.

    I would have been interested to learn more, in this book, about eels and japonaiserie.
    But then, most people who know me well will attest that I constantly carp on about
    eels and japonaiserie, to the exclusion of other, perhaps more pressing, matters.
    I make no apology. Though I may never be transfigured into a sunbeam for Jesus,
    I have buttered my parsnips, and I will take them with me to the grave, instead
    of my copy of Jasper The Baffled Eel, which I will donate to an orphanage library,
    for the future edification of generation after generation of orphaned tinies,
    as baffled as Jasper by the complexities of this complex and baffling universe.

    Now let us all sing Sag Mir Wo Die Blumen Sind?'
