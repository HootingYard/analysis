text: "\nOh cloak of night! Enshroud my hob\n  On which I boil, in a pan,\n  A gruel\
  \ thin, to feed my flock\n  When morning breaks, and they line up,\n  Each with\
  \ his coupon, snipped or torn\n  From Christ In Extremis! magazine\n  Bought from\
  \ the kiosk by the pond\n  Past the crumbling viaduct\n  Beyond the hen coops and\
  \ the sump\n  Over the hills and far away."
