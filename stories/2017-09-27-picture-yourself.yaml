    Picture yourself in a boat on a river, with tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
    You are wearing a pair of round gold-rimmed "granny" glasses. Beside you in the
    boat is your wife, an avant-garde artist from faraway Japan. You turn off your
    mind, relax, and float downstream. Then you turn your mind back on, just a tad,
    just enough to imagine no possessions. You wonder if now would be an opportune
    moment to raise with your wife that malarkey about her acquiring a second apartment
    solely for the storage of her collection of fur coats. You open your mouth to
    speak, but what comes out is gibberish. "Goo-goo-g''joob", you blurt. Your wife
    looks at you as if you have taken leave of your senses, which, to be frank, you
    probably have. Perhaps Bernard Levin was right when he wrote that there was nothing
    wrong with you that could not be cured by standing you upside down and shaking
    you gently until whatever is inside your head falls out.

    It strikes you that such a manoeuvre would be perilous if performed in a boat
    on a river. Your wife, who would have to turn you upside down, is diminutive,
    and it is likely that if she made the attempt both of you would topple over, capsizing
    the boat, and forcing you to swim to the riverbank.

    There are, apparently, tales of the riverbank, but you did not write them. Nor
    did you write tales of topographic oceans. But you did write about that famed
    ocean-going sailor Sir Walter Raleigh, who you described as a stupid git. You
    pronounced Raleigh as Rally. Nowadays, people usually pronounce it as Rahley.
    But in his own time his name was universally pronounced Rawley.

    The pronunciation of surnames is important. I have heard tell that an alarming
    number of young persons confuse you with the Bolshevik psychopath Lenin. These
    are presumably the same young persons who confuse Clarice Starling, the FBI agent
    played by Jodie Foster in The Silence Of The Lambs, with your successor Stalin.

    Oops! I meant Lenin''s successor, not yours. Now I''m getting things all mixed
    up in my head. Just like you. Well, you wrote a lot of nonsense too.'
