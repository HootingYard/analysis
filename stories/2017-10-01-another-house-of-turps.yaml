  text: "Older readers will recall House Of Turps as an out of print pamphlet published\
    \ by the Malice Aforethought Press in 1989. That's how I recall it myself. But\
    \ yesterday, rummaging in a midden, I came upon several sheets of buff paper,\
    \ the typed manuscript of a piece also called House Of Turps. It bears no resemblance\
    \ to the published text. It is the \"Prologue\" to what I clearly intended as\
    \ a lengthy narrative poem which, equally clearly, I thereafter abandoned. For\
    \ the benefit of scholars who, I know, devote their waking lives to poring over\
    \ every syllable I have ever written, here is that fragment of the lost (until\
    \ yesterday) House Of Turps ...\n\nWelcome to the House of Turps,\n  Riddled with\
    \ visionaries, idiots, twerps,\n  Bores, poltroons, maniacs, cranks,\n  Of the\
    \ highest and the lowest ranks;\n  Raised and ruined, rich and poor -\n  What\
    \ brings them all to the same door?\n  A vision of a visionary world.\nEach year\
    \ a pennant is unfurled\n  From the very top of the House's walls,\n  In howling\
    \ wind, as the mercury falls,\n  As winter bites. Ice grips the land.\n  Each\
    \ member of our demented band\n  Bids fare thee well to home, kith, kin,\n  And\
    \ with a doomed and gritty grin\n  Sets forth upon a long slow trudge\n  Towards\
    \ a circular bank of sludge.\n  This sludge-bank bars the trudgers' way.\n  To\
    \ cross it takes near half a day,\n  Weighed down by netting, pig-iron shoes,\n\
    \  Tourniquets, gum, a supply of booze,\n  Branches, forks, baize and bait -\n\
    \  All gifts for the Keeper at the gate,\n  The unfurler of the Winter Flag.\n\
    \  He's eighty-nine. His name is Cragg.\n  The House of Turps depends on him.\n\
    \  His countenance is pale and grim.\n  His history's shadowy and obscure.\n \
    \ He's lived here since the age of four.\nAs each guest lurches from the slime\n\
    \  Cragg makes a note of name and time\n  Scraped on the page with a blood-stained\
    \ hook\n  In his huge registration book.\n  He slams it shut then barks: \"Go\
    \ flee\n  To room nineteen!\" or \"twenty-three!\".\n  The guests head off on\
    \ a path of gravel\n  For they have not yet ceased to travel.\n  The House looms\
    \ a further six miles' trudge\n  Over gravel and pebbles, not slime or sludge.\n\
    \  Cragg remains, hard by the gate,\n  Until he's counted in all eight.\n  We'll\
    \ leave him there, improbably dressed,\n  As we consider each mad guest.\nPOTATO\
    \ SMITH is sick at heart,\n  Festooned with rotten sacking.\n  He made a fortune\
    \ in fine art.\n  His sense of humour's lacking.\n  Curt and shrivelled, eighty-five,\n\
    \  He likes to suck wood-splinters.\n  He is only just alive,\n  But comes here\
    \ every winter.\nPRIMROSE LEEK, a friend to ants,\n  Is only thirty-two.\n  She\
    \ wears black hat, black coat, black pants,\n  She's also known as Sue.\n  Though\
    \ dumb in summer, at the House\n  She speaks the lingua franca.\n  She murdered\
    \ Hector Lockjaw Frowse,\n  The international banker.\nThen there's DR RUFUS GLUBB,\n\
    \  The noted bandage-stainer.\n  His head looks like a bakelite tub\n  Topped\
    \ by a bent tea-strainer.\n  His belly has grown to a pot\n  From eating too much\
    \ custard.\n  The other guests loathe him a lot\n  But think he cuts the mustard.\n\
    Our fourth pal has a widow's peak,\n  Looks not unlike a panda.\n  C. T. PUCK's\
    \ part-Dutch, part-Greek,\n  Half-blind and part-Greenlander.\n  She lives on\
    \ a diet of gruel and slops\n  And vats of sour beer.\n  You can't buy those things\
    \ in the shops,\n  But Cragg supplies them here.\nLASCELLES DISTEMPER JARLEY\n\
    \  Has no sense of direction.\n  He is a proper Charlie\n  And has a cork collection.\n\
    \  He says \"by Jove!\" and \"golly gosh!\"\n  And other dumbkopf phrases.\n \
    \ He talks a huge amount of tosh\n  And he is prone to crazes.\nOLD DOGMOUTH's\
    \ fits are legion.\n  He broke his wooden legs.\n  Like others from his region\n\
    \  He sets fire to hard-boiled eggs.\n  Cragg and he are so alike\n  They could\
    \ share the same mother,\n  But Cragg was once an orphan tyke\n  And Dogmouth\
    \ has no brother.\nSISTER GERTIE of the Cross\n  Is a religious nutter.\n  She\
    \ roams the land astride her \"Hoss\",\n  A goat, a fractious butter.\n  Moths\
    \ have fluttered round her head,\n  Its incandescent light\n  Proof that she is\
    \ not quite dead\n  But shining, dazzling bright.\nThe last of the guests at the\
    \ turpentine House\n  Has crutches painted yellow.\n  His head is cracked, he's\
    \ such a louse,\n  He's such a grotesque fellow.\n  Watch him grow warts upon\
    \ his ears,\n  Watch him act agitator.\n  He's quite as vile as he appears -\n\
    \  NED HELLHOUND, your narrator.\nSo now we've met this motley crew,\n  On with\
    \ our tale of derring-do."
