  text: "Another thing I found in my recent rummage was a small batch of cuttings\
    \ from the legendary Factsheet Five magazine. Indefatigable editor Mike Gunderloy\
    \ was a generous reviewer of my (now) out of print Malice Aforethought Press pamphlets\
    \ and books. Here are some of his observations:\n\nHouse Of Turps. A curious and\
    \ delightful little booklet. Key writes in a sort of manic academic style, tracing\
    \ the life of the obscure chemist-chieftain Slobodan Curpin as he staggers through\
    \ the early days of the scientific revolution. Experimental windsocks, poultice-making,\
    \ and a civilisation beneath the Arctic ice all make perfect sense here. Much\
    \ better than the usual dreary textbook treatment of this sort of thing. Maddeningly\
    \ sensible and discordant at the same time.\nThe Immense Duckpond Pamphlet. More\
    \ bizarre prose from the fevered mind of Frank Key. This is a sort of murder mystery,\
    \ replete with an ogre who proves to be a detective, soup recipes, signs from\
    \ bizarre pubs, potato science, and even duckponds. Frank has a style all his\
    \ own, which most of us could not approach even with the use of large quantities\
    \ of illicit drugs.\nTwitching And Shattered. This is a collection of many of\
    \ Frank's shorter works, including the infamous \u201CTales of Hoon\u201D and\
    \ his series of dustjackets for forthcoming books. It also contains the wildly\
    \ funny \u201CSome Lesser-Known Editions Of The Bible\u201D, an exercise in parodied\
    \ scholarship that had me rolling on the floor. I like Frank's writing quite a\
    \ bit. He has a perfectly deadpan style that can string together the most utter\
    \ nonsense and make it fascinating. Personally, I find this style delicious, whether\
    \ Frank is writing of mysterious foreign agents, trips to Iceland, or bicycles\
    \ and earwigs. If you're fond of relatively sophisticated and curious humour,\
    \ you too should own a copy.\nAh, those were the small press days, in the pre-www\
    \ world. Now you get the outpourings of my allegedly \u201Cfevered mind\u201D\
    \ absolutely free, on an almost daily basis. That being so, remember you can always\
