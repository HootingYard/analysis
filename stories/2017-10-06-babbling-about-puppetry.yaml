  text: "\nListen here\_to yesterday's edition of Hooting Yard On The Air which devotes\
    \ much time to puppets, both shadow- and glove-, neither of which are usually\
    \ found on the radio, for obvious reasons. The show includes rather ramshackle\
    \ recitations of From The Mountains To The Sea, A Family Of Goatherds Unparalleled\
    \ In Their Rapacity, Two Sparrows, A Person Of Unhinged Mien, Tuesday Weld Goes\
    \ Berserk, and New Verse By Dennis Beerpint."
