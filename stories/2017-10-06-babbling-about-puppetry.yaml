  text: '

    Listen here to yesterday''s edition of Hooting Yard On The Air which devotes much
    time to puppets, both shadow- and glove-, neither of which are usually found on
    the radio, for obvious reasons. The show includes rather ramshackle recitations
    of From The Mountains To The Sea, A Family Of Goatherds Unparalleled In Their
    Rapacity, Two Sparrows, A Person Of Unhinged Mien, Tuesday Weld Goes Berserk,
    and New Verse By Dennis Beerpint.'
