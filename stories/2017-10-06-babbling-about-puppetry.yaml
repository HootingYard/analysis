text: "\nListen here\_to yesterday's edition of Hooting Yard On The Air which devotes\
  \ much time to puppets, both shadow- and glove-, neither of which are usually found\
  \ on the radio, for obvious reasons. The show includes rather ramshackle recitations\
  \ of From The Mountains To The Sea, A Family Of Goatherds Unparalleled In Their\
  \ Rapacity, Two Sparrows, A Person Of Unhinged Mien, Tuesday Weld Goes Berserk,\
  \ and New Verse By Dennis Beerpint."
