  text: 'On this day, six years ago, I posted this memoir of childhood. Rereading
    it just now made me laugh. I hope it will make you lot laugh too.


    There is a phrase I recall from my childhood, regularly used by my mother (above)
    when I--dippy and dreamy--was getting ready for school in the mornings.

    "One of dese days," she would say, in her Flemish accent, "You will go out widout
    your own head."

    Pish!, I thought, That is alarmist talk!

    But then one winter''s morning my mother''s prediction came true. I set off for
    school in the wind and snow, having left my head snoozing on the pillow. I suspect
    the people I passed in the street must have been astonished at the sight of a
    boy without a head, but I cannot say for sure, because of course I was completely
    unaware of them. My ears and eyes, lodged as they were in my head, were warm and
    snug and still abed.

    So familiar was I with the route to school, along the lane and past the duckpond
    and the fireworks factory and through the tunnel under the motorway and then along
    the canal towpath and past the aerodrome and the vinegar works, that I had no
    need of my head to get me there. It was only when I sat down at my desk in the
    classroom that things went awry.

    In those days, you see, we were taught such piffle as reading and writing and
    arithmetic and Latin and history, so my not having a head sent the teachers into
    a kerfuffle. I''m told there was some kind of emergency meeting in the staffroom--a
    fug of pipe-smoke then, of course--and I was put in isolation in the sickroom
    while they worked out what to do. How much more enlightened would things be today!
    Head or no head, I am sure there would be no attempt to exclude me from the diversity
    and self-esteem lessons. Indeed, my headless presence would be seen as a benefit,
    both to myself and to my fellow pupils, and to the teachers themselves. In fact,
    I would probably get a prize, just for not having a head. On the rare occasions
    prizes were dished out in those far off days, they were invariably book tokens,
    and I would certainly not have got one for not having a head. Now, I could expect
    something useful like a new app for my iPap, or a voucher for Pizza Kabin.

    But back then I was kept locked in the sickroom, excluded and with my self-esteem
    crushed, all because I''d come to school without my head. I would like to say
    that I sat there reflecting ruefully that my mother had been right all along,
    but any reflection, rueful or otherwise, wasn''t possible without my head, resting
    happily on the pillow back home.

    What happened was that the school called in a local doctor, who made a snap diagnosis
    after looking at me for about three seconds. He didn''t even use his stethoscope.
    Puffing on his pipe, he informed the headmaster in a grave doctorly voice that
    I showed all the symptoms of not having a head, and the best treatment was brisk
    exercise in the open air. So they sent me running round and round the athletics
    track all day, until the bell rang at home time. I got a ticking off from the
    gym teacher, to which I was thankfully oblivious, and then I was pointed in the
    direction of the canal towpath and told not to forget my head again or there would
    be ramifications. Yes, they used to use long words like "ramifications" even with
    headless tinies! What a different world it was.

    I trudged home in the wind and snow, went up to my bedroom, plopped my head back
    on to my neck, and sat down to warm myself in front of the gas fire. How could
    it be, I wondered, that the school was even open in such inclement weather?

    Soon it was time for tea. We had sausages and mash. It was only as I sat down
    at the table and tucked my serviette under my chin that I realised I''d put my
    head on back to front.'
