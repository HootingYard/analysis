  text: "\nI was discussing the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen with the ghost of his\
    \ first wife, Doris.\n\u201CIs it true\u201D I asked, \u201CThat Stockhausen was\
    \ covertly funded by the CIA in an attempt to demoralise German culture after\
    \ the Second World War?\u201D\nDoris was one of those mute ghosts we've been hearing\
    \ so much about lately but I hoped she would either nod or shake her head in reply.\
    \ But her phantom head remained motionless atop her phantom neck, jutting at a\
    \ disconcerting angle from between her phantom shoulders, draped in a shawl of\
    \ surpassing loveliness which was all too real, as I knew because I had touched\
    \ it, when gently pressing her down into her chair.\nWell, not her chair, but\
    \ a chair, the chair into which I press all my ghostly visitors. Unless you get\
    \ them firmly nestled, they have a tendency to float and flit about the room,\
    \ and even to splay themselves across the ceiling. Not all ghosts come when I\
    \ summon them, but Doris did. A few seconds after my ear-splitting incantation,\
    \ there was a faint tapping at my door. I opened it, and there, already, was the\
    \ ghost of Doris Stockhausen. She handed over my fifty-pfennig fee, in cash that\
    \ was pleasingly of this too too solid world\u2014I checked\u2014and allowed herself\
    \ to be ushered in, and settled in the chair.\nBut I had not reckoned on her being\
    \ a mute ghost. She sat across from me, fixing me with her baleful countenance,\
    \ silent as the grave from which I had summoned her. With no prospect of the conversation\
    \ I had so looked forward to, I went to rummage among my cassettes until I found\
    \ the tape of her ex-husband's Stimmung. I wondered if, hearing it again after\
    \ all these years, Doris might be in some measure animated.\nWhen I returned to\
    \ the room, Doris had escaped her chair and was splayed across the ceiling. The\
    \ surpassingly lovely shawl was hanging from her phantom shoulders, so I gave\
    \ it a tug, hoping to dislodge her. And indeed, she lost contact with the ceiling,\
    \ hovering in mid-air for a moment before darting this way and that, finally settling\
    \ atop a toffee cable. Oops, I mean a coffee table. Using thumb-tacks, I secured\
    \ the shawl to the table, holding Doris in place. The table was one of those fashionably\
    \ distressed coffee tables, so the addition of a dozen tack-pricks would only\
    \ add to its faux dilapidation.\nThere was every possibility that the ghost of\
    \ Doris could slip or waft from beneath the shawl and go skittering about. I slotted\
    \ the cassette into the cassette player, pressed \u201CPlay\u201D, and cranked\
    \ up the volume.\n\u201CLet us listen to Stimmung, Frau Stockhausen!\u201D I cried,\
    \ with perhaps an excess of jollity.\nThe tape hissed, and then the room was filled\
    \ with the sound of a German man moaning melodiouslyish. Startled, I saw Doris\
    \ suddenly clap her ghostly hands over her ghostly ears. Then she began to vibrate,\
    \ horribly. I turned the music off, but it was too late. With a whoosh!, Doris\
    \ shot up to the ceiling, taking the surpassingly lovely shawl and the coffee\
    \ table with her.\nTry as I might, I could not coax her down. Not only was I unable\
    \ to use my coffee table to display my coffee table books, of which I owned oodles,\
    \ but soon enough Doris outstayed her allotted time in the realm of the living\
    \ afforded by the fifty-pfennig fee. Six weeks later she was still there, clinging\
    \ to my ceiling, the shawl and table swinging gently beneath her in time with\
    \ her ghostly panting. I had not realised how violently ghosts pant, particularly\
    \ the mute ones.\nAt my wits\u2019 end, I consulted a local spirit medium who\
    \ specialised in the demoralisation of German culture in the aftermath of World\
    \ War Two. He was a rather curious fellow. His yellow skin scarcely covered the\
    \ work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and\
    \ flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed\
    \ a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same\
    \ colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion,\
    \ and his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of\
    \ human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence.\n\u201CHand.\
    \ Me. That. Cassette. Player.\u201D he boomed, standing directly beneath the ghost\
    \ of Doris and the shawl and the coffee table.\nI did his bidding, and he took\
    \ from his pocket a battered cassette tape. I shall never forget what happened\
    \ next. He plopped the cassette into the machine, pressed \u201CPlay\u201D, and\
    \ cranked up the volume. There was the familiar hiss, and then the sound of a\
    \ capella German voices warbling melodiously, with no ish about it, the first\
    \ of the Choruses For Doris, by Doris\u2019 ex-husband Karlheinz Stockhausen.\n\
    The spirit medium stepped\u2014or rather, lumbered grotesquely\u2014to one side,\
    \ and the ghost of Doris let go of the ceiling and wafted elegantly down, shawl\
    \ and coffee table and all, the table landing with a slight bump on the floor.\
    \ As the chorus continued, the medium removed the thumb-tacks one by one. The\
    \ ghost of Doris rose slghtly, hovering just above the coffee table, shimmered\
    \ for a few seconds, and then seemed to dissolve before my eyes. Weirdly, that\
    \ indubitably real unghostly shawl, of surpassing loveliness, dissolved with her.\
    \ Then, even more weirdly, the spirit medium dissolved too, taking a handful of\
    \ my thumb-tacks with him into ethereal realms beyond my puny understanding.\n\
    I was alone in my room, listening to the Choruses For Doris, and thinking to myself\
    \ that postwar German culture had not, after all, been demoralised, in spite of\
    \ the alleged efforts of the CIA."
