    I was discussing the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen with the ghost of his first
    wife, Doris.

    "Is it true" I asked, "That Stockhausen was covertly funded by the CIA in an attempt
    to demoralise German culture after the Second World War?"

    Doris was one of those mute ghosts we''ve been hearing so much about lately but
    I hoped she would either nod or shake her head in reply. But her phantom head
    remained motionless atop her phantom neck, jutting at a disconcerting angle from
    between her phantom shoulders, draped in a shawl of surpassing loveliness which
    was all too real, as I knew because I had touched it, when gently pressing her
    down into her chair.

    Well, not her chair, but a chair, the chair into which I press all my ghostly
    visitors. Unless you get them firmly nestled, they have a tendency to float and
    flit about the room, and even to splay themselves across the ceiling. Not all
    ghosts come when I summon them, but Doris did. A few seconds after my ear-splitting
    incantation, there was a faint tapping at my door. I opened it, and there, already,
    was the ghost of Doris Stockhausen. She handed over my fifty-pfennig fee, in cash
    that was pleasingly of this too too solid world--I checked--and allowed herself
    to be ushered in, and settled in the chair.

    But I had not reckoned on her being a mute ghost. She sat across from me, fixing
    me with her baleful countenance, silent as the grave from which I had summoned
    her. With no prospect of the conversation I had so looked forward to, I went to
    rummage among my cassettes until I found the tape of her ex-husband''s Stimmung.
    I wondered if, hearing it again after all these years, Doris might be in some
    measure animated.

    When I returned to the room, Doris had escaped her chair and was splayed across
    the ceiling. The surpassingly lovely shawl was hanging from her phantom shoulders,
    so I gave it a tug, hoping to dislodge her. And indeed, she lost contact with
    the ceiling, hovering in mid-air for a moment before darting this way and that,
    finally settling atop a toffee cable. Oops, I mean a coffee table. Using thumb-tacks,
    I secured the shawl to the table, holding Doris in place. The table was one of
    those fashionably distressed coffee tables, so the addition of a dozen tack-pricks
    would only add to its faux dilapidation.

    There was every possibility that the ghost of Doris could slip or waft from beneath
    the shawl and go skittering about. I slotted the cassette into the cassette player,
    pressed "Play", and cranked up the volume.

    "Let us listen to Stimmung, Frau Stockhausen!" I cried, with perhaps an excess
    of jollity.

    The tape hissed, and then the room was filled with the sound of a German man moaning
    melodiouslyish. Startled, I saw Doris suddenly clap her ghostly hands over her
    ghostly ears. Then she began to vibrate, horribly. I turned the music off, but
    it was too late. With a whoosh!, Doris shot up to the ceiling, taking the surpassingly
    lovely shawl and the coffee table with her.

    Try as I might, I could not coax her down. Not only was I unable to use my coffee
    table to display my coffee table books, of which I owned oodles, but soon enough
    Doris outstayed her allotted time in the realm of the living afforded by the fifty-pfennig
    fee. Six weeks later she was still there, clinging to my ceiling, the shawl and
    table swinging gently beneath her in time with her ghostly panting. I had not
    realised how violently ghosts pant, particularly the mute ones.

    At my wits'' end, I consulted a local spirit medium who specialised in the demoralisation
    of German culture in the aftermath of World War Two. He was a rather curious fellow.
    His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his
    hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but
    these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
    seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set,
    his shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips. His voice was booming
    and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or
    cadence.

    "Hand. Me. That. Cassette. Player." he boomed, standing directly beneath the ghost
    of Doris and the shawl and the coffee table.

    I did his bidding, and he took from his pocket a battered cassette tape. I shall
    never forget what happened next. He plopped the cassette into the machine, pressed
    "Play", and cranked up the volume. There was the familiar hiss, and then the sound
    of a capella German voices warbling melodiously, with no ish about it, the first
    of the Choruses For Doris, by Doris'' ex-husband Karlheinz Stockhausen.

    The spirit medium stepped--or rather, lumbered grotesquely--to one side, and the
    ghost of Doris let go of the ceiling and wafted elegantly down, shawl and coffee
    table and all, the table landing with a slight bump on the floor. As the chorus
    continued, the medium removed the thumb-tacks one by one. The ghost of Doris rose
    slghtly, hovering just above the coffee table, shimmered for a few seconds, and
    then seemed to dissolve before my eyes. Weirdly, that indubitably real unghostly
    shawl, of surpassing loveliness, dissolved with her. Then, even more weirdly,
    the spirit medium dissolved too, taking a handful of my thumb-tacks with him into
    ethereal realms beyond my puny understanding.

    I was alone in my room, listening to the Choruses For Doris, and thinking to myself
    that postwar German culture had not, after all, been demoralised, in spite of
    the alleged efforts of the CIA.'
