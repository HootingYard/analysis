    Browsing in the basement of a dust-choked and unkempt secondhand bookshop, I found
    on the floor a slim pamphlet entitled A Guide To The Care And Feeding Of The Internal
    Combustion Monkey. The author''s name was not given, but there was a picture of
    him below the title, a cad, a cad wearing a cravat, with a Terry-Thomas moustache
    and a glint in his eye. That glint, I assumed, that cad''s glint, was the glint
    that led him to envisage, and then to invent, the internal combustion monkey.
    Why did he not wish to crow his name from the rooftops, or at least to print it
    on his pamphlet?

    I picked up the pamphlet, and purchased it (thruppence), and made it my life''s
    work, from that hour, to find out exactly who this cad was, to give him a name,
    to slot him into his deserved place in the history of this our island''s glory.

    I began with the cravat. In the picture on the pamphlet it was black and white,
    but I felt sure the real thing, when tucked around the neck of the cad, had been
    bursting with colours. Which colours? I made multiple photocopies of the picture,
    and spent two years, armed with crayons and watercolours and state-of-the-art
    pigment-staining technology, working out the colour combinations most likely to
    have emblazoned the cravat of the cad. It was thirsty work, and I drank a well
    dry. This did not sit well with the well''s owner, a florid bumpkin plagued with
    whitlows, who evicted me from my chalet anent the well. And so I roamed the hills,
    reduced to just a few crayons, but with my portfolio of photocopied hand-coloured
    cad portraits intact, tucked in a satchel slung over my good shoulder.

    There was, up in the hills, the salon of a cravatteuse, and I made no bones about
    badgering her. One by one I waved in front of her the photocopies, much as a conjuror
    might deploy a deck of playing cards for a magic trick, until, at last, she stopped
    me, by pointing her finger decisively at the photocopy of the cad in which I had
    coloured his cravat in swirling curlicues of baize-green and fire-ant-red and
    Lee Harvey Oswald beige, with a few subtle tints of indigo, cerise, puce, chartreuse,
    mauve, mauve, and more mauve.

    "That is his cravat!", she cried.

    "And who is or was he?" I asked.

    Her eyes narrowed. Her lips puckered. Her dog, sitting at her feet, snarled. I
    felt a sudden mortification of the bowels.

    "He was an unspeakable cad!" she cried, and she had her dog chase me out of the
    salon, and further up into the hills, where the air was thin, and the promontories
    dizzying. I had left my satchel and crayons and sheaf of photocopies at the salon,
    but clutched in my good hand the only photocopy that mattered, the one with the
    accurate rendition of the colour scheme of the cravat sported by the cad. And
    I knew, now, what I had not known before, that his name was unspeakable.

    I remained in the hills for several years, living on rainwater and birds felled
    with well-aimed pebbles. Slowly, gradually, I came to understand that, if the
    name of the cad was unspeakable, then it had never been spoken, that nobody knew
    what it was, leading to the inescapable conclusion that, thus unknown, it could
    not be written down, which was why it did not appear, printed in big bold black
    letters on the cover of the pamphlet the cad had written about the care and feeding
    of the internal combustion monkey.

    And so I came down from the hills, and adopted a new life as a bargee on an unimportant
    canal, and I sprouted a Terry-Thomas moustache, and, yes, yes!, I too wore a cravat,
    of baize-green and fire-ant-red and Lee Harvey Oswald beige, with a few subtle
    tints of indigo, cerise, puce, chartreuse, mauve, mauve, and more mauve, and whenever
    I was asked my name, by other bargees or by, say, canalside picnic persons. I
    shut my mouth, and kept it shut, and said nothing.'
