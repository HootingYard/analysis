  text: "Ahoy there, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, I very much enjoyed reading your\
    \ piece Unspeakable. For me, the thunderclap moment was the mention of the cravatteuse's\
    \ dog. I am sure I cannot be alone among your readers in hankering for more dog-detail.\
    \ Would you, for example, be in possession of a picture of this fabled canine?\n\
    On another matter, with reference to your piece Hendiadys In Mudchute, am I correct\
    \ in thinking that there is a figure of speech, or it might be a disease of poultry,\
    \ called chickendiadys?\nI look forward to hearing from you regarding both these\
    \ riveting topics.\nIn answer to Dr Pastry's queries, the one about the dog being\
    \ (A) and the one about the chicken being (B), my responses are:\n\n(A) Yes\_\n\
    \    and (B) No."
