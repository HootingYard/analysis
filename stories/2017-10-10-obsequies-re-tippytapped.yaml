    Since this blog began in 2003, I have posted pretty much all the stories which
    were originally published as Malice Aforethought Press pamphlets (out of print)
    in the last century. The glaring exception is Obsequies For Lars Talc, Struck
    By Lightning. A short extract has appeared, but the full text is unavailable to
    all but the lucky (and sensible) few who bought the pamphlet back in 1994. It
    was the longest tale I issued as a spineless short-run pamphlet, and also the
    last. Shortly after it appeared, I descended into the Wilderness Years.

    In a few days'' time I shall be heading off to foreign parts again. Rather than
    leave you lot enmired in the unspeakable misery of No-Hooting-Yard-Updates-Land,
    it occurred to me to take advantage of the WordPress feature whereby I can prepare
    posts and set a future date and time for automated publication. Thus I have been
    busy tippy-tapping the text of Obsequies ... and it will appear, one chapter per
    day, over the next fifteen days, starting tomorrow.

    As ever when revisiting my stuff from long ago, I have been tempted to revise
    and tweak and edit, to rid the prose of infelicities and howlers and horrors.
    But I decided to leave this intact, almost exactly as it was when published twenty-three
    years ago. It might cause me--and indeed you lot--to groan from time to time,
    but, hey, I was younger then, and more stupid, and a hopeless drunk.

    Should any typos have crept in undetected, I am sure an eagle-eyed reader (you
    know who you are) will alert me to them. I will correct them when I''m back in
    Blighty.

    Finally, remember that you used to have to pay for this stuff, and a copy of the
    original pamphlet would fetch a hefty price on eBay. So please consider whacking
    the "Make A Donation" button over to your right, and shovelling some loose change
    in my direction. It could help pay for a wreath for the grave of poor Lars Talc,
    struck by lightning ...

    ... Chapter One of which will appear tomorrow.'
