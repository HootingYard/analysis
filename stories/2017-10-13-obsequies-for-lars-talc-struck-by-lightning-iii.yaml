    "Thursday," he wrote in his journal, "I could not stomach breakfast. Minnie reproached
    me. She has been hiding my socks again, God blast her! Today I found them in the
    coal-shed, after an hour''s search. An hour I could have better spent mulling
    over Bewg''s latest clue, which seems to be utterly without meaning. I spent much
    of the morning polishing off my paper on musketry. The post brought an anonymous
    letter, accusing me of having joined the scientifico-medical club by dint of intrigue,
    and threatening exposure unless I paid an unwarrantable sum of money into a secret
    bank account. I tore the letter to shreds in fury. Exposure? Intrigue? Dint?

    "After lunch, as I was about to settle to some serious Bewg-related musings, I
    was further distracted by a visit from Chodd. Apparently, I was meant to have
    completed by today the design for the new Electro-Magnetic Apparatus Museum tickets.
    The opening is next month and before then the Committee has to approve my design
    and get billions of the confounded things printed. I admitted to Chodd that this
    task had completely slipped my mind. I do not know why on earth I was asked to
    do it. To show willing, I fetched from the crate in the goose-shed my Simplified
    Ticket Design Handbook, and also dug out a few rough sketches I had made last
    time I designed some tickets (for the Small Zoo Railway) about forty years ago.

    "Chodd was contemptuous. His small flat ears, which poke out from his head at
    a grotesque angle, turned purple with irritability. I badgered him for information.
    What size should the tickets be? How many colours were permissible? Would the
    tickets be perforated and torn from a large sheet, or pre-snipped? What fonts
    were available? I realised I should have sought all this information earlier,
    and Chodd realised it too, and used my ignorance against me, spitting into my
    mahogany spittoon with undisguised venom. When eventually I had sketched a design
    which I thought perfectly adequate


    "Chodd had the nerve to insist that a separate design was necessary for the reduced-rate
    entry fee for children. Bah! Children! What do they care for Electro-Magnetism?
    It was my turn to spit, but I did as I was bid.


    "That shut him up! Roughly, I thrust the designs into his limp and puny hands
    and shooed him from the house. If the Committee did not accept my tickets, I raved,
    as he retreated out of the door, then they were no better than bed-wetters, and
    woe betide them if they were to ask me to revise my brilliant designs, into which
    I had poured every last scintilla of my genius. Chodd muttered something which
    I did not hear, and trudged off into the downpour. If he visits me again, I shall
    set a pack of starving sharp-fanged beasts upon him.

    "Chodd dispatched, I attempted to annihilate the image of him from my brain by
    undertaking some long overdue chores. I smeared wax on to the little spindle under
    the netting. I counted toads. I pressed my hair underneath a steaming slab. Minnie''s
    cocoa-tin needed a lick of paint. I re-counted the toads. There were far more
    of them than I had realised, and they came in many different shades and sizes.
    I suspected that some of them were not toads at all, and as luck would have it,
    the reference book I duly consulted in order to settle the matter quite fortuitously
    led me to decipher the next clue in Bewg''s trail, by an unfathomable concatenation
    of fireworks in my head, one of those tremendous mental jamborees which seem to
    occur more and more frequently the older I get, a fact which I have discussed
    at length with that fraudulent old buzzard Pillchain, who lives in the apartment
    below, and whose pretensions as a psychoanalyst cause me greater mirth than almost
    anything else in these twilight years of my life, beset as I am by creaking bones,
    indigestion, vipers like Chodd, Minnie''s manias, agonising pains which rack my
    every limb, the fiend Bewg, intermittent lockjaw, the gas bills, the cold and
    damp, and that peculiarly Finnish synkkys, tenebrous, yes, and ever-present.

    "The reference book I sought--All The Toads Of Scandinavia--sat on the shelf next
    to a mighty tome devoted to the history of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
    fully illustrated with maps and portraits (no doubt fanciful) of some of the more
    illustrious members of that preposterous band. I stole this book from a subscription
    library in Maitland, oh half a century ago, and as far as I can recall it has
    remained unread--until this afternoon. Casting toads from my mind for, I supposed,
    a few minutes, I removed this Mountie-book from the shelf and sprawled on my Davenport
    to bone up on the doings of a foreign poliisi.

    "I was at once struck by a skilful engraving showing the stern-jawed features
    of one Captain Crabbage. There was something arresting about his countenance,
    something at any rate which made me want to read about his exploits. These were
    detailed in a chapter entitled ''The Prestige Of The Scarlet'', which began on
    the page facing the portrait.

    The facts of the weird and wild adventure which befell Captain Crabbage on Tantarabim
    Island, I read, may be taken collectively as indicative of the many curious secrets
    awaiting solution in the vastnesses of the Arctic. They may be advanced as typical
    of the experiences to be met with by a white man when set down beyond the last
    vestige of civilisation to explore, to govern, and generally to represent Law
    and Order among a handful of consistently ignorant, intermittently violent, and
    unbelievably superstitious natives; or they may be looked upon as--just a story.
    But chiefly the serve as still another illustration of the tremendous prestige
    of the scarlet worn by Canada''s famous police force.

    "I was hooked. Yarns of derring-do, particularly those set in the polar regions,
    have always appealed to me. The toads forgotten, I read on with increasing glee.

    The awful character of the scenery--gigantic, barren cliffs, enormous, flat-topped
    mountains capped with snow and cloud, huge valleys mothering eternal glaciers,
    long beaches, ice-girt seas, and great fjords penetrating incredible distances
    into the unknown interior--such scenery as one finds in mediaeval panoramas of
    hell.

    "I read of Crabbage constructing his dwelling-house, store-house, and blubber-shed,
    racing against time with the long polar night only three weeks away. And then
    of his discovery of the Place Of The Big Killing and the sorcerer who, in a frenzied
    trance, announced that he was the Creator, Pingortitsijok, wrapped in hides, King
    of the Ice.

    "At the point where Captain Crabbage returned to Fort Hopton with the sorcerer
    in handcuffs, something in my brain went ping!, and I knew I had made the leap
    in the dark necessary to understand the next clue in Bewg''s trail. Oh, it is
    too complicated to explain. The Big Killing, the sorcerer, the handcuffs ... my
    mind underwent a curious topsy-turvydom as I linked these images to gunpowder,
    gruel, toy flamingoes, a wrench, a cupboard, a bee ... all of a sudden that weird
    couplet of Bewg''s, scratched in mirror-writing next to an emblem of plague, made
    stark and incontrovertible sense. I threw the book to the floor, grabbed the treasure
    map, and looked at it as if for the first time. Now it all seemed blindingly clear.

    "Outside it was already dark, and the rain poured down, and Minnie had hidden
    my umbrella, but I no longer cared. I slammed the door behind me and walked all
    the way across town to the Derelict Orchard. Bewg had been there before me. His
    shovel was there, shining, leaning against a pile of stones. I dug, dug, dug.
    Abominable pains attacked my skeleton, but I kept on digging in the downpour,
    down into the mud, until, past midnight, I found at last, buried in the muck,
    a tiny crate of zinc. I pocketed it, and made my way back home in the terrible
    blackness of the Finnish night.

    "It is now half past four on Friday morning. I am sitting in the kitchen, slurping
    from a mug of boiling turnip extract, and the crate is before me on the table.
    I have a little over twenty-four hours to work out how to open it."'
