  text: "\n\u201CThursday,\u201D he wrote in his journal, \u201CI could not stomach\
    \ breakfast. Minnie reproached me. She has been hiding my socks again, God blast\
    \ her! Today I found them in the coal-shed, after an hour's search. An hour I\
    \ could have better spent mulling over Bewg's latest clue, which seems to be utterly\
    \ without meaning. I spent much of the morning polishing off my paper on musketry.\
    \ The post brought an anonymous letter, accusing me of having joined the scientifico-medical\
    \ club by dint of intrigue, and threatening exposure unless I paid an unwarrantable\
    \ sum of money into a secret bank account. I tore the letter to shreds in fury.\
    \ Exposure? Intrigue? Dint?\n\u201CAfter lunch, as I was about to settle to some\
    \ serious Bewg-related musings, I was further distracted by a visit from Chodd.\
    \ Apparently, I was meant to have completed by today the design for the new Electro-Magnetic\
    \ Apparatus Museum tickets. The opening is next month and before then the Committee\
    \ has to approve my design and get billions of the confounded things printed.\
    \ I admitted to Chodd that this task had completely slipped my mind. I do not\
    \ know why on earth I was asked to do it. To show willing, I fetched from the\
    \ crate in the goose-shed my Simplified Ticket Design Handbook, and also dug out\
    \ a few rough sketches I had made last time I designed some tickets (for the Small\
    \ Zoo Railway) about forty years ago.\n\u201CChodd was contemptuous. His small\
    \ flat ears, which poke out from his head at a grotesque angle, turned purple\
    \ with irritability. I badgered him for information. What size should the tickets\
    \ be? How many colours were permissible? Would the tickets be perforated and torn\
    \ from a large sheet, or pre-snipped? What fonts were available? I realised I\
    \ should have sought all this information earlier, and Chodd realised it too,\
    \ and used my ignorance against me, spitting into my mahogany spittoon with undisguised\
    \ venom. When eventually I had sketched a design which I thought perfectly adequate\n\
    \n\u201CChodd had the nerve to insist that a separate design was necessary for\
    \ the reduced-rate entry fee for children. Bah! Children! What do they care for\
    \ Electro-Magnetism? It was my turn to spit, but I did as I was bid.\n\n\u201C\
    That shut him up! Roughly, I thrust the designs into his limp and puny hands and\
    \ shooed him from the house. If the Committee did not accept my tickets, I raved,\
    \ as he retreated out of the door, then they were no better than bed-wetters,\
    \ and woe betide them if they were to ask me to revise my brilliant designs, into\
    \ which I had poured every last scintilla of my genius. Chodd muttered something\
    \ which I did not hear, and trudged off into the downpour. If he visits me again,\
    \ I shall set a pack of starving sharp-fanged beasts upon him.\n\u201CChodd dispatched,\
    \ I attempted to annihilate the image of him from my brain by undertaking some\
    \ long overdue chores. I smeared wax on to the little spindle under the netting.\
    \ I counted toads. I pressed my hair underneath a steaming slab. Minnie's cocoa-tin\
    \ needed a lick of paint. I re-counted the toads. There were far more of them\
    \ than I had realised, and they came in many different shades and sizes. I suspected\
    \ that some of them were not toads at all, and as luck would have it, the reference\
    \ book I duly consulted in order to settle the matter quite fortuitously led me\
    \ to decipher the next clue in Bewg's trail, by an unfathomable concatenation\
    \ of fireworks in my head, one of those tremendous mental jamborees which seem\
    \ to occur more and more frequently the older I get, a fact which I have discussed\
    \ at length with that fraudulent old buzzard Pillchain, who lives in the apartment\
    \ below, and whose pretensions as a psychoanalyst cause me greater mirth than\
    \ almost anything else in these twilight years of my life, beset as I am by creaking\
    \ bones, indigestion, vipers like Chodd, Minnie's manias, agonising pains which\
    \ rack my every limb, the fiend Bewg, intermittent lockjaw, the gas bills, the\
    \ cold and damp, and that peculiarly Finnish synkkys, tenebrous, yes, and ever-present.\n\
    \u201CThe reference book I sought\u2014All The Toads Of Scandinavia\u2014sat on\
    \ the shelf next to a mighty tome devoted to the history of the Royal Canadian\
    \ Mounted Police, fully illustrated with maps and portraits (no doubt fanciful)\
    \ of some of the more illustrious members of that preposterous band. I stole this\
    \ book from a subscription library in Maitland, oh half a century ago, and as\
    \ far as I can recall it has remained unread\u2014until this afternoon. Casting\
    \ toads from my mind for, I supposed, a few minutes, I removed this Mountie-book\
    \ from the shelf and sprawled on my Davenport to bone up on the doings of a foreign\
    \ poliisi.\n\u201CI was at once struck by a skilful engraving showing the stern-jawed\
    \ features of one Captain Crabbage. There was something arresting about his countenance,\
    \ something at any rate which made me want to read about his exploits. These were\
    \ detailed in a chapter entitled \u2018The Prestige Of The Scarlet\u2019, which\
    \ began on the page facing the portrait.\nThe facts of the weird and wild adventure\
    \ which befell Captain Crabbage on Tantarabim Island, I read, may be taken collectively\
    \ as indicative of the many curious secrets awaiting solution in the vastnesses\
    \ of the Arctic. They may be advanced as typical of the experiences to be met\
    \ with by a white man when set down beyond the last vestige of civilisation to\
    \ explore, to govern, and generally to represent Law and Order among a handful\
    \ of consistently ignorant, intermittently violent, and unbelievably superstitious\
    \ natives; or they may be looked upon as\u2014just a story. But chiefly the serve\
    \ as still another illustration of the tremendous prestige of the scarlet worn\
    \ by Canada's famous police force.\n\u201CI was hooked. Yarns of derring-do, particularly\
    \ those set in the polar regions, have always appealed to me. The toads forgotten,\
    \ I read on with increasing glee.\nThe awful character of the scenery\u2014gigantic,\
    \ barren cliffs, enormous, flat-topped mountains capped with snow and cloud, huge\
    \ valleys mothering eternal glaciers, long beaches, ice-girt seas, and great fjords\
    \ penetrating incredible distances into the unknown interior\u2014such scenery\
    \ as one finds in mediaeval panoramas of hell.\n\u201CI read of Crabbage constructing\
    \ his dwelling-house, store-house, and blubber-shed, racing against time with\
    \ the long polar night only three weeks away. And then of his discovery of the\
    \ Place Of The Big Killing and the sorcerer who, in a frenzied trance, announced\
    \ that he was the Creator, Pingortitsijok, wrapped in hides, King of the Ice.\n\
    \u201CAt the point where Captain Crabbage returned to Fort Hopton with the sorcerer\
    \ in handcuffs, something in my brain went ping!, and I knew I had made the leap\
    \ in the dark necessary to understand the next clue in Bewg's trail. Oh, it is\
    \ too complicated to explain. The Big Killing, the sorcerer, the handcuffs \u2026\
    \ my mind underwent a curious topsy-turvydom as I linked these images to gunpowder,\
    \ gruel, toy flamingoes, a wrench, a cupboard, a bee \u2026 all of a sudden that\
    \ weird couplet of Bewg's, scratched in mirror-writing next to an emblem of plague,\
    \ made stark and incontrovertible sense. I threw the book to the floor, grabbed\
    \ the treasure map, and looked at it as if for the first time. Now it all seemed\
    \ blindingly clear.\n\u201COutside it was already dark, and the rain poured down,\
    \ and Minnie had hidden my umbrella, but I no longer cared. I slammed the door\
    \ behind me and walked all the way across town to the Derelict Orchard. Bewg had\
    \ been there before me. His shovel was there, shining, leaning against a pile\
    \ of stones. I dug, dug, dug. Abominable pains attacked my skeleton, but I kept\
    \ on digging in the downpour, down into the mud, until, past midnight, I found\
    \ at last, buried in the muck, a tiny crate of zinc. I pocketed it, and made my\
    \ way back home in the terrible blackness of the Finnish night.\n\u201CIt is now\
    \ half past four on Friday morning. I am sitting in the kitchen, slurping from\
    \ a mug of boiling turnip extract, and the crate is before me on the table. I\
    \ have a little over twenty-four hours to work out how to open it.\u201D"
