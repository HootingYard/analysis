  text: "\nDr Franklin first showed that lightning is the same as the electricity\
    \ made by the electrical machine. As the electricity of the electrical machine\
    \ is got by rubbing glass, so much of the electricity of the air is caused by\
    \ the rubbing of moist air against dry air. A great deal is made by the turning\
    \ into vapour or mist of the salt water of the ocean by the sun's heat or the\
    \ blowing of the wind. More water is turned into vapour during the heat of summer\
    \ and autumn than in winter, and this is why there is more lightning in warm than\
    \ in cold weather.\nThere is always a good deal of electricity n the air, and\
    \ in clear weather it is generally positive electricity, but during fogs, rains,\
    \ or snows it is usually negative electricity, though it changes often. It sometimes\
    \ happens that two clouds, one charged with positive electricity and the other\
    \ with negative electricity, come near each other, and then the two kinds of electricity\
    \ rub together, when a flash of lightning is seen, and thunder is heard.\nThe\
    \ lightning is the same thing as the spark from an electrical machine, the only\
    \ difference being that a flash of lightning is sometimes several miles long,\
    \ and the spark only a few inches. The little spark gives out only a snapping\
    \ sound, but if we were able to make a spark as large as a flash of lightning,\
    \ it would cause as much noise as thunder.\nWhen a cloud filled with one kind\
    \ of electricity comes near the earth while the earth is filled with electricity\
    \ of the opposite kind, the cloud may discharge its electricity to the earth.\
    \ If any tall object, such as a tree, a steeple, or a house, happens to be near\
    \ where the cloud discharges, the electricity will often pass down it to the earth.\
    \ In this way houses are sometimes injured and set on fire, and great trees are\
    \ split up into small pieces. Sometimes, too, human beings and animals are struck\
    \ and killed. It is not safe, therefore, to stand under a tree or close to a high\
    \ house during a thunder-storm.\nWe see lightning in several different forms;\
    \ sometimes its flash is straight, sometimes it is forked or zig-zag, sometimes\
    \ it is round like a ball, and sometimes it spreads over the clouds like a sheet\
    \ of fire. When a thunder-cloud is near the earth the flash comes straight down\
    \ to the earth, because there is but little air for it to pass through, but when\
    \ the cloud is a considerable distance from the earth, the air in the path of\
    \ the lightning is made denser or thicker by being pushed together, and as lightning\
    \ can pass quicker through thin than through thick air, it flies from side to\
    \ side so as to pass where it is thinnest. Thus its path is zig-zag or forked.\
    \ When there is a very great charge of electricity in a cloud it sometimes forces\
    \ its way through the air in the shape of a ball. What is called sheet lightning\
    \ is either the reflection or shine on clouds of a stroke of zig-zag lightning\
    \ which is too far off to be seen, or light discharges of electricity from clouds\
    \ which have not enough to cause zig-zag lightning.\nWhen lightning passes through\
    \ air it leaves behind it a vacuum\u2014that is, an empty place\u2014and the air\
    \ rushing in to fill it makes the noise which is called thunder (ukkonen in Finnish).\
    \ We do not usually hear this until some time after the flash of lightning, because\
    \ light travels more than a million times faster than sound. When the thunder-cloud\
    \ is at a distance, the sound comes to us little by little, and it is then called\
    \ rolling thunder; but when the cloud is near the earth the sound comes in one\
    \ great crash. We can generally tell how far off a thunder-cloud is by noting\
    \ how much time elapses between the flash of lightning and the sound of the thunder.\
    \ If we can count five as slowly as the tick of a clock between the two, it is\
    \ certain that the cloud is more than a mile away.\nLightning, in its way to the\
    \ earth, will always follow the best conductor, and when it strikes a building\
    \ or a tree it will leap from side to side to find it. It likes pointed things\
    \ better than round or blunt things, and this is why lightning rods have sharp\
    \ points. Buildings properly fitted with lightning rods are safe from being struck\
    \ by lightning, because the rods lead off the electricity into the earth. When\
    \ a cloud filled with electricity comes over the rods, the electricity will flow\
    \ silently down them until the cloud is discharged, and we see no flash and hear\
    \ no thunder; but we feel sure that the building will not be struck. The tops\
    \ of lightning rods are usually made of silver or are gilded, so that they may\
    \ not rust and thus become worthless. The lower end of the rod must be carried\
    \ down into damp earth; if the earth is dry it is better to carry the end into\
    \ a well, because dry earth is not so good a conductor as moist earth, and the\
    \ lightning might leap from the rod at the lower end and go into the cellar of\
    \ the building. High chimneys should have rods on them, because the soot in them\
    \ is a good conductor, as is also the vapour which rises from them when fires\
    \ are burning.\nThe word lightning in Finnish is salama; a flash of lightning\
    \ is salaman leimahdus."
