    The undertaker was a retired football referee named Aloysius Batlip, who doubled
    as a fishmonger. Unable to afford the rent for separate premises, he ran both
    his businesses from a single property in the town''s commercial district. He collected
    the body of Lars Talc before rigor mortis had set in, and deposited it on a counter
    at the back of his shop, where it jostled for space with a recent catch of herring,
    a dozen bream, a punnet of blubber, knives, boning-implements, wicker baskets
    filled with fishbones, and a platter of sturgeon''s innards.

    During the following hour, there were eight visitors to Batlip''s emporium.

    1. Dr Hoist, Lars Talc''s general practitioner. Precise details of Finnish health
    care provision at the time of these events are beyond the compass of the present
    work, which in some ways is a pity, as it would make for fascinating reading.
    Dr Hoist''s surgery was two minutes'' walk from the funeral parlour, which itself
    stood just a few yards from the spot where Talc had fallen. Batlip, who had witnessed
    the tragedy, had himself trundled the corpse into his shop, in a fish-barrow.
    A passing ingrate was sent speeding to Dr Hoist, who came at once.

    Medical implementa deployed, Dr Hoist pronounced his patient dead. Batlip covered
    the body with sailcloth, and suggested a prayer.

    "He was not a religious man," said the doctor, gagging on the overpowering stink
    of fish.

    "But I am," replied the undertaker, and he mumbled a few words of spiritual consolation.

    "I have an urgent case of the dropsy to attend to," said Dr Hoist, hurrying away,
    "I will send you the necessary papers tomorrow."

    2. Thing Linnet, an employee of the post office and passing acquaintance of Talc,
    who had also witnessed his death. He entered the shop as Dr Hoist left. A Papist,
    he unleashed from a roomy pocket in his tunic a set of antique wooden rosary beads,
    and proceeded to bray hectically over the body. Batlip, whose faith was more gritty,
    muscular, and northern, and who feared that such a racket could deter his piscine
    customers, pleaded with Linnet to desist. Eyes lambent with tears, Linnet apologised,
    but explained that he was grief-stricken and inconsolable.

    "You are acting like an Italian widow, sir," said the fishmonger, "Did you know
    the man well?"

    "Heaven forfend!" screeched Linnet, "Do you not know who you have here?" He lifted
    the sailcloth. "This is Professor Lars Talc!"

    Batlip had defective vision and an unsympathetic optician. He handled so many
    cadavers, he had not thought to examine this one closely. Now that he learned
    the identity of his charge, he was distraught.

    "One of the finest minds in all Finland!" he exclaimed.

    "Now perhaps you are sensible of my woe," said Linnet.

    Before Batlip could reply, his fishmongery assistant called him to the front of
    the shop, where the third visitor had appeared.

    3. Guesbaldo O''Shaughnessy, restaurateur and one of Batlip''s most valued customers.
    He called daily, and enjoyed discussing his gastronomic schemes with the shopkeeper.

    "Dear friend!" he said, planting a trio of kisses on the fishmonger''s moonlike
    cheeks, "Tonight I intend to lay on a fine meal. The Papal Nuncio has reserved
    four tables. Imagine! I will make a fine trout pie. First I will remove the skin
    and bone from a half dozen medium size trout, and cut them into small pieces.
    Then I will put the pieces, together with a teacupful of bland sauce, four hard-boiled
    eggs, a teaspoonful of chopped pignut, pepper, salt, and trimmings into a mighty
    iron basin, mix the lot up and place it into a thawed pastry-case. I will wet
    the edges with goats'' milk, fold the pastry up like an envelope, brush the top
    with goo, put it on to a greased tin, and bake it in my piping hot oven until
    the pie is virtually black. Over the top I will pour syrup of herring. Oh my pal,
    is your mouth watering as mine is?"

    It was not.

    4. Slops Curbin, a member of the Electro-Magnetic Apparatus Museum Committee,
    who lived but a street away. He arrived some minutes after Batlip had managed
    to bundle O''Shaughnessy out of the shop, thrusting a parcel of trout under his
    arm. Curbin came merely to gloat and did not stay long.

    5. Poor Minnie. She had been alerted by Linnet. She swept through into the funeral
    parlour. Batlip made room for her, sweeping buckets of jelly, mackerel-heads,
    steamed mullet, and tench-buns out of the way.

    "I would stay with you, but I must prepare the Chapel of Rest." he said.

    Minnie was silent. She sat by Talc''s body, scribbling notes into her commonplace
    book, chewing the end of her pencil each time she paused, briefly, for thought.
    Did she write a valediction to Talc, a torrent of memories, fire, and longing?
    Ah, that would not be Minnie. No, she sat by the corpse of the man with whom she
    had shared her life, and, in her crabbed hand, wrote about chemical barometer
    remedies, adulterations of cocoa, eye washes, the time for hanging chickens, the
    uses of sulphuric ether, stamped documents, the distance of the visible horizon,
    furniture for invalids, how to render linen bags incombustible, mange in dogs,
    irritating vegetable poisons, the return of liveries by dismissed servants, and
    the gutting of widgeons.

    6. Battista Ritnob, a journalist. Ritnob had bumped into Dr Hoist near the tram-stop,
    and had been apprised of Talc''s death. She arrived, panting, pumped Batlip and
    his assistant for details, was granted a cursory sight of the corpse, and scooted
    back to her office to file a stop press report.

    "Professor Lars Talc, the great Finnish polymath, was struck by lightning and
    killed this morning. He was ninety-four. Witnesses stated that Talc was walking
    along the Avenue Ack on his way to an important meeting when a bolt of lightning
    struck him down. A full obituary will appear in later editions."

    7. Flail Plon, an aeronautical engineer. He called into the shop to buy a brace
    of lampreys.

    8. Chodd. His behaviour was extraordinary, given that he held Talc in contempt.
    Chodd had fallen on hard times, his position as ill-paid henchman of the Museum
    Committee belying the fact that he had once, oh, long ago, had a glittering career
    as a bassoonist in Java. That island''s finest composers had written works especially
    for him. One thinks of Gribgab''s Wheelchair Variations, Dweb''s Three Winter
    Turnips, and, inevitably, The Filthiest Of The Churns, that clamorous masterpiece
    by Lug.

    It had all gone horribly wrong following a mysterious incident at the Annual Javan
    Bassoonists'' Picnic in the summer of the Lug premiere. The truth of what happened
    at the duckpond has never come to light, the facts hidden in mouldering police
    files. But Chodd''s career was effectively over, and, as the decades passed, he
    became ever more embittered.

    It rankled him to see a man like Talc, whom he considered a mere dilettante, held
    in such high esteem. Chodd''s loathing of Talc stemmed from a radio broadcast
    given by the latter, in which he disparaged bassoonists--particularly those from
    Java, Sumatra, and Borneo--as "mewling guttersnipes". The words were intemperate,
    the opinion indefensible, but music had long been considered as Talc''s glaring
    weakness: his views were universally ridiculed, and his own works--primarily the
    one hundred and fourteen pieces in the songbook--passed over in embarrassed silence
    by the musical community, except in tone-deaf England, which held Talc''s songs
    in curious regard. But Chodd never forgave him, and when, by chance, the two were
    brought together by the Electro-Magnetic Apparatus Museum Committee, the ex-bassoonist
    relished every opportunity to scorn Talc to his face.

    All the more remarkable, then, the vision of Chodd stamping into the funeral parlour
    in his tin boots, laying a bouquet of delphiniums on the sailcloth shroud, muttering
    consolatory nothings at the heedless, scribbling Minnie, and, joining Batlip in
    the Chapel of Rest, offering what help he could.

    Working silently, the two men emptied out barrels of whelks, mussels, and crayfish
    into an iron bath, which they shoved into a corner and covered with an old curtain.
    Chodd removed oozing tubs of sprat-oil from the shelves and stacked them away
    in a cupboard. Batlip bundled his knives, axes, slicers, choppers, hooks, spikes,
    whittles, scissors, razors, cutters, and cleavers into a canvas sack which he
    lowered into the cellar. Between them, they managed to hose down the slab. Chodd
    gathered handfuls of vegetation from the small plot at the back of the shop, and
    decked the room with them, while Batlip nailed a few fish-crates together into
    a coffin shape and placed it next to the slab, ready to receive Talc''s carcase.'
