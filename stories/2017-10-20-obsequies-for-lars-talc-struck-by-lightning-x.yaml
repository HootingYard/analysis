    In 1742 Jacques Benigne Winslow published a book entitled The Uncertainty Of The
    Signs Of Death. Aloysius Batlip owned a pirated Finnish edition of this important
    work, to which he referred each time a corpse lay sprawled on his mortuary slab.
    It was his practice not to allow weeping relatives into the Chapel of Rest until
    he was quite sure that the body was beyond all hope of resuscitation.

    Hence he followed Winslow''s advice to pour vinegar, pepper, and fresh, warm urine
    into the supposedly deceased''s mouth. But this was merely the first of a battery
    of tests he carried out. Talc''s cadaver was subjected to a panoply of often ferocious
    indignities.

    Batlip tweaked the Professor''s nipples with Dr Josat''s formidably sharp metal
    pincers, shocked his ears with hideous shrieks and excessive noises, applied a
    thermometer to his rectum, rammed burning tapers up his nostrils, melted sealing
    wax upon his chest, dipped a hammer into boiling water and pressed it into the
    hollow of Talc''s abdomen, plunged Monsieur Middledorf''s flag-capped needle into
    his heart, stuck one of Talc''s fingers into his ear to listen for rolling noises,
    carried out Snart''s anal sphincter test, dusted the groin with kwantod powder,
    and injected a solution of duggery into the spinal cord. Finally he was satisfied,
    and with Chodd still acting as his helper, he prepared the corpse for display.

    "Cleanse the body, Chodd," he said, handing his assistant a bar of soap and a
    mop, "I will gather the substances and equipment."

    Batlip was justly proud of his embalming skills, and had won many cups and trophies
    from the Institute of Finnish Sepulture. As Chodd, having completed his task,
    wrung out the mop in a bucket, Batlip plunged a trocar into Lars Talc''s abdomen
    just above the navel, and thrust it in all directions until he had pierced the
    stomach, intestines, rectum, bladder, and liver, sucking out bits of tissue, blood
    clots, food, faeces, intestinal gases, and urine. He then pushed the trocar through
    the diaphragm and into the chest, lacerating and sucking as it went. Pausing only
    to snack on a conger-eel sandwich, he pumped preserving fluid into the cadaver,
    and turned his attention to the face.

    When you die, your lower jaw falls downwards and backwards, and the mouth hangs
    open, giving you the look of a dolt or a dunderpate. With Chodd at his side, Batlip
    passed a needle and thread from the inner surface of Talc''s lower lip, up in
    front of his gums, through into one nostril, across to the other nostril, and
    back again into his mouth behind the upper lip. When the thread was drawn tight,
    by a fascinated Chodd, the lower jaw was pulled upwards and forwards. Lars Talc
    looked pensive and wise, and would remain so for a week or two, until his flesh
    began to rot.

    They dressed him in a winding-sheet embroidered with Batlip''s monogram, leaving
    only his face uncovered. Then they transferred him to the coffin and lifted it
    on to the slab, having first covered it with a cloth of baize. And there, for
    the next few days, the great Professor Talc lay in state.'
