  text: "\nIn 1742 Jacques Benigne Winslow published a book entitled The Uncertainty\
    \ Of The Signs Of Death. Aloysius Batlip owned a pirated Finnish edition of this\
    \ important work, to which he referred each time a corpse lay sprawled on his\
    \ mortuary slab. It was his practice not to allow weeping relatives into the Chapel\
    \ of Rest until he was quite sure that the body was beyond all hope of resuscitation.\n\
    Hence he followed Winslow's advice to pour vinegar, pepper, and fresh, warm urine\
    \ into the supposedly deceased's mouth. But this was merely the first of a battery\
    \ of tests he carried out. Talc's cadaver was subjected to a panoply of often\
    \ ferocious indignities.\nBatlip tweaked the Professor's nipples with Dr Josat's\
    \ formidably sharp metal pincers, shocked his ears with hideous shrieks and excessive\
    \ noises, applied a thermometer to his rectum, rammed burning tapers up his nostrils,\
    \ melted sealing wax upon his chest, dipped a hammer into boiling water and pressed\
    \ it into the hollow of Talc's abdomen, plunged Monsieur Middledorf's flag-capped\
    \ needle into his heart, stuck one of Talc's fingers into his ear to listen for\
    \ rolling noises, carried out Snart's anal sphincter test, dusted the groin with\
    \ kwantod powder, and injected a solution of duggery into the spinal cord. Finally\
    \ he was satisfied, and with Chodd still acting as his helper, he prepared the\
    \ corpse for display.\n\u201CCleanse the body, Chodd,\u201D he said, handing his\
    \ assistant a bar of soap and a mop, \u201CI will gather the substances and equipment.\u201D\
    \nBatlip was justly proud of his embalming skills, and had won many cups and trophies\
    \ from the Institute of Finnish Sepulture. As Chodd, having completed his task,\
    \ wrung out the mop in a bucket, Batlip plunged a trocar into Lars Talc's abdomen\
    \ just above the navel, and thrust it in all directions until he had pierced the\
    \ stomach, intestines, rectum, bladder, and liver, sucking out bits of tissue,\
    \ blood clots, food, faeces, intestinal gases, and urine. He then pushed the trocar\
    \ through the diaphragm and into the chest, lacerating and sucking as it went.\
    \ Pausing only to snack on a conger-eel sandwich, he pumped preserving fluid into\
    \ the cadaver, and turned his attention to the face.\nWhen you die, your lower\
    \ jaw falls downwards and backwards, and the mouth hangs open, giving you the\
    \ look of a dolt or a dunderpate. With Chodd at his side, Batlip passed a needle\
    \ and thread from the inner surface of Talc's lower lip, up in front of his gums,\
    \ through into one nostril, across to the other nostril, and back again into his\
    \ mouth behind the upper lip. When the thread was drawn tight, by a fascinated\
    \ Chodd, the lower jaw was pulled upwards and forwards. Lars Talc looked pensive\
    \ and wise, and would remain so for a week or two, until his flesh began to rot.\n\
    They dressed him in a winding-sheet embroidered with Batlip's monogram, leaving\
    \ only his face uncovered. Then they transferred him to the coffin and lifted\
    \ it on to the slab, having first covered it with a cloth of baize. And there,\
    \ for the next few days, the great Professor Talc lay in state."
