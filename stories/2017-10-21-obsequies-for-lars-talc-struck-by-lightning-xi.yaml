    "On the day after my death, the exercise book in which I have written my Last
    Will And Testament will be taken to a desolate spinney. There, its contents will
    be shrieked by my embalmer, whomsoever that may be. Those gathered to hear it
    will accompany the embalmer''s shrieks by plucking on primitive wooden stringed
    instruments. All those present will wear cotton hoods, and go barefoot. This I
    command."

    Lars Talc had written these words some twenty years before, and published them
    in a small compendium of his scribblings entitled Shuddering & Brilliantine. Minnie
    underlined the paragraph and handed a dog-eared copy of the book to Batlip, who
    read the words with dismay. He was a fiercely shy man, and the prospect unnerved
    him. With Talc in his coffin, and as he and Chodd rinsed off the embalming equipment
    and rubbed their hands with Finnish swarfega, he confessed his terrors to his
    helpmeet.

    "I cannot do it, Chodd. I am a deeply religious man, and I have no wish to ride
    roughshod over the sincere wishes of the deceased, especially so eminent a Finn
    as Professor Talc. But look, already I am incontinent with fear."

    Chodd dabbed at Batlip''s trousers with a cloth.

    "Thank you, Chodd. Oh, how I shiver with apprehension at the thought of public
    speaking. Two years ago, when I was awarded the All Finland Embalming Medal, I
    was forced to mount the dais to make an acceptance speech. Sepulchral noteworthies
    from throughout the land were gathered before me, sitting on benches, agog to
    hear my every word. The president of the Institute looped the medal around my
    neck, and they all cheered, applauded, and threw their funeral hats into the air.
    I was led to a microphone like a villain to the firing squad. Do not chuckle,
    I am serious. My mouth opened and closed repeatedly, without a word issuing forth.
    Sweat glistened from every pore. I shat in my pantaloons, and then I swooned."

    Chodd gawped.

    "You see," continued Batlip, "I simply cannot do it. I would disgrace the memory
    of a towering Finn. I would sully his name. There is only one answer. You will
    have to play my part. You will be the embalmer. After all, you have given me sterling
    assistance on this sad day. I ask this favour of you out of proper respect for
    the departed."

    So it was that at noon on the following day, Chodd, sporting a false moustache
    and smelling of fish, arrived in the desolate spinney with Talc''s exercise book
    stuffed into his pocket.

    There were twenty-six souls gathered to hear Talc''s last words: Minnie, of course;
    the ten surviving members of the scientifico-medical club, with Bewg in tow; a
    bone-setter named Carg; Linnet and his wife; Aloysius Batlip, heavily disguised;
    a trio of mountebanks with whom Talc had had larks; his neighbour Pillchain; a
    curmudgeonly widow, name unknown, who was passing the spinney and stopped to ponder
    the scene; poor, fearful Bruno; Slops Curbin, detailed to attend by the Electro-Magnetic
    Apparatus Museum Committee; Horst Venk, an old, begrimed friend of Talc''s from
    their student days; the journalist Ritnob; and Ingborg Todge, a blind and foul-mouthed
    army captain who, he kept telling everybody, had known Talc for years, though
    he was unknown to all those present, including Minnie, who deliberately crushed
    his toes under her black boot to stop his incessant babbling.

    Chodd distributed the little cotton hoods which he had found next to the exercise
    book in Talc''s cast iron cabinet and, at full screech, ordered the assembled
    company to remove their footwear. Minnie handed out the musical instruments. Then,
    standing atop a makeshift plinth, Chodd thumbed open the exercise book and proceeded
    to shriek.

    "This is the Last Will And Testament of Lars Talc. I, Professor Lars Talc, a Finn,
    a polymath, author of numberless books on topics as diverse as anorthopia, bell-ringing,
    cramp, death, ectoplasm, fireworks, galley-slaves, haplography, Iceland, jam,
    knuckle-dusters, lemon meringue pie, mortmain, nystagmus, owls, pap, quicklime,
    ranunculus, sanitation, time-bombs, ullage, vanquishment, whimbrels, xerasia,
    yeast, and zapateado, I, an accomplished musician, balladeer, and madrigalist,
    who have in my time excelled as a wrestler, an entomologist, a pirate manque,
    a splinterbrain, and a taxonomer, I who have enjoined my fellow Finns to acts
    of mercy and philanthropy, who have robbed none but given succour to many, who
    have clambered over mental obstacles with the torch of truth clutched in my fist,
    I, Lars Talc, Professor of Pandaemonium, moral exemplar, I who would reek of saintliness
    were there such things as saints, which there are not, I hereby give, devise,
    and bestow, absolutely and forever, in perpetuity, until the last pale flicker
    of animate life is stilled and the universe blotted out, I bequeath all my estate
    and effects, whatever they may comprise, for I neither know nor care, but all
    of it, every last scrap, to my dear, dear Minnie, who I thus proclaim as my executrix,
    and if, oh!, misery, she should perish before I do, then the whole lot will instead
    be bequeathed to a man, a crab-gaited man, a lanky man with a stoop, a man who
    will make himself known to you by the popping noises he elicits from the thin
    slit of his mouth, a man who may remain in hiding for years, even decades, during
    which time my estate will be tied up in formidable legal knots, and chaos descend
    upon all those who have the gall to claim any part of it, and their lives will
    be filled to the very brim with woe.

    "In witness to the above, I have hereunto set my hand, this teeming day, [date].
    The florid, some would say too florid, signatures of my witnesses appear below.
    Both are in my presence as I write. Pillchain is slumped in an armchair, leafing
    through a copy of my momentous tome The Glue Of Rascality, a better book than
    he will ever write. The other witness is a topiarist of renown, who I bumped into
    at the docks this morning, and is at present fooling about in a striped purple
    and green cape in my vestibule.

    "In turn, I will hand each of them my pen and la!, they will sign their names,
    and this document will be complete, and I will apply a wad of blotting paper,
    and shut the book, and place it in my cast iron cabinet, where it will remain
    for who knows how long, until these final words are screeched by my embalmer in
    a desolate spinney on the day after my death. You may now remove your cotton hoods
    and, putting boots, shoes, or sandals back on, go shod, my proxy-screeched farewell
    ringing in your ears. Farewell!"

    Chodd ceased. The mad strumming on the banjos, shamizens, guitars, and ukuleles
    ceased. The sun burst from behind a cloud. Lars Talc''s will was done.'
