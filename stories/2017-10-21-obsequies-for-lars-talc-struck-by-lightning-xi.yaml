  text: "\n\u201COn the day after my death, the exercise book in which I have written\
    \ my Last Will And Testament will be taken to a desolate spinney. There, its contents\
    \ will be shrieked by my embalmer, whomsoever that may be. Those gathered to hear\
    \ it will accompany the embalmer's shrieks by plucking on primitive wooden stringed\
    \ instruments. All those present will wear cotton hoods, and go barefoot. This\
    \ I command.\u201D\nLars Talc had written these words some twenty years before,\
    \ and published them in a small compendium of his scribblings entitled Shuddering\
    \ & Brilliantine. Minnie underlined the paragraph and handed a dog-eared copy\
    \ of the book to Batlip, who read the words with dismay. He was a fiercely shy\
    \ man, and the prospect unnerved him. With Talc in his coffin, and as he and Chodd\
    \ rinsed off the embalming equipment and rubbed their hands with Finnish swarfega,\
    \ he confessed his terrors to his helpmeet.\n\u201CI cannot do it, Chodd. I am\
    \ a deeply religious man, and I have no wish to ride roughshod over the sincere\
    \ wishes of the deceased, especially so eminent a Finn as Professor Talc. But\
    \ look, already I am incontinent with fear.\u201D\nChodd dabbed at Batlip's trousers\
    \ with a cloth.\n\u201CThank you, Chodd. Oh, how I shiver with apprehension at\
    \ the thought of public speaking. Two years ago, when I was awarded the All Finland\
    \ Embalming Medal, I was forced to mount the dais to make an acceptance speech.\
    \ Sepulchral noteworthies from throughout the land were gathered before me, sitting\
    \ on benches, agog to hear my every word. The president of the Institute looped\
    \ the medal around my neck, and they all cheered, applauded, and threw their funeral\
    \ hats into the air. I was led to a microphone like a villain to the firing squad.\
    \ Do not chuckle, I am serious. My mouth opened and closed repeatedly, without\
    \ a word issuing forth. Sweat glistened from every pore. I shat in my pantaloons,\
    \ and then I swooned.\u201D\nChodd gawped.\n\u201CYou see,\u201D continued Batlip,\
    \ \u201CI simply cannot do it. I would disgrace the memory of a towering Finn.\
    \ I would sully his name. There is only one answer. You will have to play my part.\
    \ You will be the embalmer. After all, you have given me sterling assistance on\
    \ this sad day. I ask this favour of you out of proper respect for the departed.\u201D\
    \nSo it was that at noon on the following day, Chodd, sporting a false moustache\
    \ and smelling of fish, arrived in the desolate spinney with Talc's exercise book\
    \ stuffed into his pocket.\nThere were twenty-six souls gathered to hear Talc's\
    \ last words: Minnie, of course; the ten surviving members of the scientifico-medical\
    \ club, with Bewg in tow; a bone-setter named Carg; Linnet and his wife; Aloysius\
    \ Batlip, heavily disguised; a trio of mountebanks with whom Talc had had larks;\
    \ his neighbour Pillchain; a curmudgeonly widow, name unknown, who was passing\
    \ the spinney and stopped to ponder the scene; poor, fearful Bruno; Slops Curbin,\
    \ detailed to attend by the Electro-Magnetic Apparatus Museum Committee; Horst\
    \ Venk, an old, begrimed friend of Talc's from their student days; the journalist\
    \ Ritnob; and Ingborg Todge, a blind and foul-mouthed army captain who, he kept\
    \ telling everybody, had known Talc for years, though he was unknown to all those\
    \ present, including Minnie, who deliberately crushed his toes under her black\
    \ boot to stop his incessant babbling.\nChodd distributed the little cotton hoods\
    \ which he had found next to the exercise book in Talc's cast iron cabinet and,\
    \ at full screech, ordered the assembled company to remove their footwear. Minnie\
    \ handed out the musical instruments. Then, standing atop a makeshift plinth,\
    \ Chodd thumbed open the exercise book and proceeded to shriek.\n\u201CThis is\
    \ the Last Will And Testament of Lars Talc. I, Professor Lars Talc, a Finn, a\
    \ polymath, author of numberless books on topics as diverse as anorthopia, bell-ringing,\
    \ cramp, death, ectoplasm, fireworks, galley-slaves, haplography, Iceland, jam,\
    \ knuckle-dusters, lemon meringue pie, mortmain, nystagmus, owls, pap, quicklime,\
    \ ranunculus, sanitation, time-bombs, ullage, vanquishment, whimbrels, xerasia,\
    \ yeast, and zapateado, I, an accomplished musician, balladeer, and madrigalist,\
    \ who have in my time excelled as a wrestler, an entomologist, a pirate manqu\xE9\
    , a splinterbrain, and a taxonomer, I who have enjoined my fellow Finns to acts\
    \ of mercy and philanthropy, who have robbed none but given succour to many, who\
    \ have clambered over mental obstacles with the torch of truth clutched in my\
    \ fist, I, Lars Talc, Professor of Pandaemonium, moral exemplar, I who would reek\
    \ of saintliness were there such things as saints, which there are not, I hereby\
    \ give, devise, and bestow, absolutely and forever, in perpetuity, until the last\
    \ pale flicker of animate life is stilled and the universe blotted out, I bequeath\
    \ all my estate and effects, whatever they may comprise, for I neither know nor\
    \ care, but all of it, every last scrap, to my dear, dear Minnie, who I thus proclaim\
    \ as my executrix, and if, oh!, misery, she should perish before I do, then the\
    \ whole lot will instead be bequeathed to a man, a crab-gaited man, a lanky man\
    \ with a stoop, a man who will make himself known to you by the popping noises\
    \ he elicits from the thin slit of his mouth, a man who may remain in hiding for\
    \ years, even decades, during which time my estate will be tied up in formidable\
    \ legal knots, and chaos descend upon all those who have the gall to claim any\
    \ part of it, and their lives will be filled to the very brim with woe.\n\u201C\
    In witness to the above, I have hereunto set my hand, this teeming day, [date].\
    \ The florid, some would say too florid, signatures of my witnesses appear below.\
    \ Both are in my presence as I write. Pillchain is slumped in an armchair, leafing\
    \ through a copy of my momentous tome The Glue Of Rascality, a better book than\
    \ he will ever write. The other witness is a topiarist of renown, who I bumped\
    \ into at the docks this morning, and is at present fooling about in a striped\
    \ purple and green cape in my vestibule.\n\u201CIn turn, I will hand each of them\
    \ my pen and la!, they will sign their names, and this document will be complete,\
    \ and I will apply a wad of blotting paper, and shut the book, and place it in\
    \ my cast iron cabinet, where it will remain for who knows how long, until these\
    \ final words are screeched by my embalmer in a desolate spinney on the day after\
    \ my death. You may now remove your cotton hoods and, putting boots, shoes, or\
    \ sandals back on, go shod, my proxy-screeched farewell ringing in your ears.\
    \ Farewell!\u201D\nChodd ceased. The mad strumming on the banjos, shamizens, guitars,\
    \ and ukuleles ceased. The sun burst from behind a cloud. Lars Talc's will was\
    \ done."
