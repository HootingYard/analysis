    Minnie threw herself into the funeral arrangements with astonishing energy. At
    ninety-seven, she was three years older than Talc, but the years had not dimmed
    her eupeptic zest. As executrix of the estate, she accosted Chodd--thinking he
    was Batlip--within seconds of the will being screeched.

    "I will be in charge of the funeral, down to the tiniest detail," she rapped,
    "You, Aloysius, will do my bidding. Your first task is to arrange for the Bosnian
    nerve gas billionaire, Turps Potcap, to be at my apartment at ten o clock tomorrow
    morning on the dot. Meanwhile, Talc is to be refrigerated at the lowest possible
    temperature you can manage. Snap to it."

    At ten o clock the next morning, Turps Potcap was ushered in to Minnie''s sitting-room.
    He was almost as wizened as she, but a quarter of a century younger. Born of Bosnian
    lumpenproles who died of the groist when he was a mere tot, Potcap was brought
    up in a frolicsome orphanage run by the famed reformer Hattie Brinks. At fourteen
    he was already displaying his formidable intellectual gifts, delivering lectures
    on a variety of abstruse subjects to his dumbstruck peers.

    Mistress Brinks enrolled him at the University of Tuzla, where he soon humiliated
    his teachers by addressing them in fluent Coptic, a language none of them understood.
    Before his sixteenth birthday, Potcap was appointed Corncrake Professor of Physics
    at a crumbling but important university in Burma, a post he held until he was
    forty. By then, however, he had invented a nerve gas of staggering power, which
    he patented and sold in vast quantities to governments around the world.

    The effects of Potcap''s gas, on one exposed to it, are temporary but devastating.
    The victim invariably runs to the nearest tobacconist, buys a huge quantity of
    cigarettes, slumps to the ground and sits, babbling, gesticulating, and smoking
    heavily, like a student. Meanwhile, the tanks, artillery, and special operations
    militia move in, and by the time the effects of the gas wear off, a couple of
    days later, the commanding heights of the socio-economic infrastructure are in
    the hands of the invading forces.

    Potcap made an absolute fortune, of course, and retired from academia. He lived
    simply, spending much of his time engaged in various secretive and pointless research
    projects, but occasionally hiring himself out as a "special consultant". He had,
    for example, designed a new whisk for a utensils conglomerate, written a lengthy
    report on pigeons'' blood at the behest of the Hooting Yard Foundation, conducted
    dangerous experiments at an international hot air ballooning conference, and solved
    the bogus laundry murder case, which had befuddled the minds of the Dutch police
    for six years. With such a pedigree, he was Minnie''s natural choice to organise
    Lars Talc''s funeral.

    She steered Potcap to an armchair and gave him a mug of soup.

    "Thank you for coming at such short notice," she said, "First of all, I must ask
    you if you are familiar with Talc and his work?"

    "I am not," replied Potcap.

    "Splendid!" shouted Minnie, unnecessarily loudly, "I am so glad. The Finns think
    they know Talc, you see, they think they understand him. That''s why I have asked
    you here, because you will approach the task objectively. You will bring no mental
    baggage in your train."

    "What is this task you speak of?"

    "I wish you to organise Talc''s funeral, Mr Potcap," said Minnie.

    The Bosnian billionaire was startled. "O is he dead then?"

    "Two days ago he was struck by lightning. Here is a newspaper clipping. You may
    keep it if you wish."

    Potcap read Battista Ritnob''s brief report, then tucked it carefully into his
    wallet.

    "If I may say so, madam, you have made an excellent choice in selecting me for
    this task," he announced. "Although I have never organised a funeral before, I
    am more than equal to the challenge. Is he to be buried or burned?"

    "Buried," said Minnie.

    "Good. Humans are the only creatures who bury their dead. The fact is of fundamental
    significance. Palaeolithic peoples not only buried their dead, madam, but they
    provided them with food and other equipment, implying a belief that the dead still
    needed such things in the grave. Tosh it may be, but significant tosh, highly
    significant, eh?"

    "Talc spurned all religion and other shilly-shallying."

    "As I do myself, madam," said Potcap, gulping down his soup. "Nevertheless, burial
    of the dead stems from an instinctive inability or refusal to accept death as
    the definitive end of life."

    Minnie snorted. "What else can you do with a corpse?" she asked.

    "Burn it," said Potcap, "Or leave it where it is. But let that pass. Talc shall
    be buried. As he was not a Christian, I suppose you do not wish the funerary ceremonies
    to be invested with a sombre character, the visible expression of which would
    be the use of black vestments, and candles of unbleached wax and the solemn tolling
    of a church bell, the corpse being carried in a doleful cortege of clergy and
    mourners, with the intoning of psalms and the purificatory use of incense, and,
    the coffin being deposited in the church, it being covered with a black pall,
    and the Office of the Dead recited or sung, with the constant rendition of Eternal
    rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him, followed
    by the recitation of the Requiem Mass, with the sacrifice especially offered for
    the repose of the soul of the dead, then the absolution of the deceased, the coffin
    solemnly perfumed with incense and sprinkled with holy water, before being carried
    to consecrated ground and buried while the officiating priest whines a litany
    of appropriate prayers?"

    Minnie spat.

    "I would rather lie on my back at the bottom of a pond than take part in such
    trumpery! No, Mr Potcap, I have very clear ideas about Talc''s funeral. You will
    need to take notes. While I fetch more soup, you had better sharpen your pencil.
    Here is a wastepaper basket for the shavings."

    Turps Potcap sharpened his pencil. Minnie brought two mugs of boiling soup.

    "The funeral will take place in three days'' time," she said, "You will have lots
    of work to do. Now listen carefully. Including you and me, there will be twenty-six
    mourners, selected on an alphabetic basis. I will give you the names later. If
    anyone else tries to attend, Bruno will frighten them away. He has a talent for
    scarifying.

    "We will gather at dawn in the gazebo on Pilgarlic Hill, to which Batlip will
    have delivered Talc in his coffin the night before. There will be a funeral breakfast,
    consisting of porridge, ships'' biscuits, and whey. We will then form a cortege,
    each mourner travelling separately in a different form of transport. Batlip''s
    hearse will be at the front, of course, and immediately behind it me, borne on
    a palanquin. The other carriages will be a landau, a motorbike, a rickshaw, a
    charabanc, a covered wagon, a brancard, a tumbrel, an ekka, a scooter, a tilbury,
    a van, an ambulance, a coach-and-four, a mail-phaeton, a jalopy, a huskie-drawn
    sled, a bicycle, a hard-top, a wheelchair, a truck, a go-kart, a diligence, a
    brake, a clunker, and a gig. I have you down for the tumbrel, Mr Potcap, I trust
    that will be satisfactory?"

    "Of course, madam," said the billionaire, writing frantically.

    "Good. We will proceed at a stately pace, with much wailing and gnashing of teeth.
    Our route will take us past the Cow & Pins, Talc''s favourite drinking-hole. We
    will all disembark, enter the tavern, and drink heavily. You will have to ensure
    that the landlord is apprised of our visit, and has in stock many barrels of a
    special funereal brew. We will not leave until every last drop of it is drunk.
    Communal ablutions will then take place in the lavatories, after which the cortege
    will make its way to the Gravelflap Building in the town square.

    "The coffin will be carried in on a bier. We mourners will remain outside, where
    we will eat hockey cake, count noses, drape a toad in ermine, and break into bits
    a mustard canister. That done, we will enter the building and take our seats.
    Dr Hoist will then sing song number one hundred and four from Talc''s songbook.
    It is a dirge of inordinate length, entitled The Grist, The Sack, The Perfume
    Of Lack. We shall all join in for the chorus. While Hoist moans, Finnish Airline
    Belles will distribute sprigs of watercress soaked in vinegar, which the mourners
    will entangle in their hair. Have you got all this written down? Good. We will
    then applaud immoderately as the Reverend Chew appears in the pulpit."

    "Madam?"

    "What?"

    "A reverend? I thought you said Talc abhorred religion?"

    "He did. But the Reverend Chew is an old friend. His mother and Talc''s mother
    killed horses together when they were children. He and Talc spent many happy hours
    side by side, laying plans for a fundamental reform of Finnish cartography. Their
    innovative map-reading techniques were revolutionary, and even today have not
    won popular acceptance. It is quite impossible to imagine Talc''s funeral without
    the Reverend Chew taking part in the obsequies.

    "When, after about ten minutes, the mourners have stopped cheering, Chew will
    deliver his sermon. If I know Chew, it will be a thing of magnificence. There
    will then be a little concert. I have arranged for a small ensemble of bassoon,
    sackbut, and twin accordions to play some dreadfully lugubrious pieces. I will
    then take centre stage and pound my madge upon an anvil, the very picture of hysterical
    bereavement. Ensure, Mr Potcap, that quick sketches of me are executed at this
    point. You will find plenty of able scribblers in the directory.

    "You will then unleash into the building a sleuth of bears, a chattering of choughs,
    a sedge of herons, a drift of swine, a congregation of plovers, a cete of badgers,
    and a husk of hares. Talc was fond of animals. Do not forget to contact the zoo,
    which must provide not only the beasts but their keepers. Their frolicking done,
    the animals will be mesmerised by the quack Pillchain, and carted off to the place
    of interment, whence we too will follow, after lunching on fudge and toffee in
    the Gravelflap cafeteria.

    "When we arrive at the cemetery, I want each mourner to be given an urn to blub
    into. Batlip and his henchman will varnish the coffin with a stinking substance,
    and it will be lowered into an enormous pit. We shall stand in a circle around
    it, sobbing, bereft, but dignified. The animals will be loosed among the tombstones.
    A troupe of minstrels will prance and caterwaul. Milk, feathers, sand, and fragments
    from the skull of an osprey will be tossed into the pit. The Reverend Chew will
    jabber. The sky will darken. We will shuffle away, each lost in our thoughts,
    going our separate ways, and never gather together again. There. That will be
    the funeral of Lars Talc."'
