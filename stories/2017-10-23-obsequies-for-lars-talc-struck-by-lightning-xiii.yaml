  text: "\nMinnie had decided that all twenty-six mourners would attend the funeral\
    \ bedecked in costumes made entirely of feathers. All feathers are made alike\
    \ in their general form, although they differ greatly in size, strength, and colour.\n\
    Each one has a quill, or barrel, a shaft, and a vane, beard, or web. The quill\
    \ is a hollow horny tube, made of hardened albumen. It has an opening at the bottom,\
    \ and one where it joins the shaft, and has inside a thin dry core. The shaft\
    \ is smaller and longer than the quill, and is nearly flat on each of its four\
    \ sides. It is made of a white spongy substance called the pith, covered with\
    \ a thin horny sheath. The vane or beard, which is in two parts, one on each side\
    \ of the shaft, is formed of many small flat plates or scales, which grow out\
    \ of the sides of the shaft, and lie with their flat sides close to each other.\
    \ These sides have along their upper edges little hooks, or barbules, by means\
    \ of which they hold fast to each other, so that the surface of the beard is close\
    \ and smooth and does not open when the bird is flying.\nIn some birds, like the\
    \ ostrich, these barbules do not hook very tightly together, and this makes their\
    \ feathers more soft and plumy than those of other birds. At the bottom of the\
    \ beard, next to the quill, there is usually a small feathery tuft called the\
    \ plumule, or accessory plume. Besides the feathers, many birds have next to the\
    \ skin a soft fleecy covering called down, which is made up of very small feathers.\n\
    Feathers grow very fast, and almost all birds change them every year. Feathers\
    \ vary in size and in form in different parts of the body, and have received different\
    \ names from those who write about birds. Most birds have a small gland, or kind\
    \ of bag, at the base of the tail, from which they squeeze out oil with their\
    \ bill, and spread it over their feathers. This is partly the reason why birds\u2019\
    \ feathers shed water.\nOf ornamental feathers, those of the ostrich are most\
    \ prized, especially the large white plumes from the back and tail of the male\
    \ bird. But many other birds, such as the peacock, swan, turkey, pheasant, cock,\
    \ heron, egret, osprey, eagle, ibis, rhea, emu, adjutant, grebe, marabout, stork,\
    \ and widgeon yield feathers which are used in ornament.\nIn preparing feathers\
    \ for use, they are tied up in bundles and washed in warm soap and water to free\
    \ them from grease. The soap is then rinsed out in clean hot water, and they are\
    \ then plunged into boiling water into which a few drops of saffron distillate\
    \ have been mixed. After further rinsing, they are drawn quickly through cold\
    \ water with a mixture of a little ground agaric, and are then steamed over sulphur\
    \ fumes and dried. The shafts are scraped to make them limber, and the filaments\
    \ or feathery parts are patted gently with special light-weight hammers.\nMinnie\
    \ had wheelbarrow-loads of feathers delivered to her apartment by a team of feather-gatherers\
    \ drawn from different bird-houses scattered throughout the town. Working like\
    \ a drudge, she made all the costumes herself, scarcely pausing to sleep. As each\
    \ costume was finished, Bruno packed it into a large cardboard packet and delivered\
    \ it personally to the recipient. In turn, at intervals of a few hours, Aminadab,\
    \ Bewg, Chodd, Darningneedle, Eck, Freakpit, Gum, Dr Hoist and the others answered\
    \ their doors to find the terrifyingly pale figure of Bruno standing before them,\
    \ the packet in one hand and an invitation to the funeral in the other.\nMinnie\
    \ had commissioned a rancorous Stalinist hobbledehoy to illuminate the invitations.\
    \ Josef Megrimovitch Bong lived in a pigeon-loft above one of the finest houses\
    \ in the town, and seemed to subsist on a diet of rusks, mugwort, and tap water.\
    \ His creaking, spavined frame, clad in a muddy black cape, was often seen stalking\
    \ aimlessly along the boulevards, spitting at children and stamping on puppies.\
    \ Minnie was his only friend\u2014even Talc had loathed him\u2014and spying him\
    \ on her way back from the screeching of the will, she dropped some rusted coins\
    \ into his hand and bid him draw up the invitations. For though he was almost\
    \ universally hated, every Finn who knew him had to admit that Bong's calligraphy\
    \ was of stupendous beauty.\n\u201CKnow ye,\u201D read the invitation, \u201C\
    That Professor Lars Talc was struck by lightning on Tuesday last, as he bestrode\
    \ the Avenue Ack. Aye, weep, for the great Finnish polymath is no more! The huge\
    \ throbbing brain is stilled! Mourn with every particle of your yet quick being!\
    \ You are commanded to be present at his Obsequies. At dawn on Sunday we will\
    \ gather at the gazebo on Pilgarlic Hill. Be there, or abominations will rain\
    \ down upon you. And wear these feathers, and nought else, for if you do not,\
    \ you will answer to Bruno, and he is fearsome in his wrath! Attend, or be besmirched!\u201D\
    \nNone dared disobey the call."
