    Minnie had decided that all twenty-six mourners would attend the funeral bedecked
    in costumes made entirely of feathers. All feathers are made alike in their general
    form, although they differ greatly in size, strength, and colour.

    Each one has a quill, or barrel, a shaft, and a vane, beard, or web. The quill
    is a hollow horny tube, made of hardened albumen. It has an opening at the bottom,
    and one where it joins the shaft, and has inside a thin dry core. The shaft is
    smaller and longer than the quill, and is nearly flat on each of its four sides.
    It is made of a white spongy substance called the pith, covered with a thin horny
    sheath. The vane or beard, which is in two parts, one on each side of the shaft,
    is formed of many small flat plates or scales, which grow out of the sides of
    the shaft, and lie with their flat sides close to each other. These sides have
    along their upper edges little hooks, or barbules, by means of which they hold
    fast to each other, so that the surface of the beard is close and smooth and does
    not open when the bird is flying.

    In some birds, like the ostrich, these barbules do not hook very tightly together,
    and this makes their feathers more soft and plumy than those of other birds. At
    the bottom of the beard, next to the quill, there is usually a small feathery
    tuft called the plumule, or accessory plume. Besides the feathers, many birds
    have next to the skin a soft fleecy covering called down, which is made up of
    very small feathers.

    Feathers grow very fast, and almost all birds change them every year. Feathers
    vary in size and in form in different parts of the body, and have received different
    names from those who write about birds. Most birds have a small gland, or kind
    of bag, at the base of the tail, from which they squeeze out oil with their bill,
    and spread it over their feathers. This is partly the reason why birds'' feathers
    shed water.

    Of ornamental feathers, those of the ostrich are most prized, especially the large
    white plumes from the back and tail of the male bird. But many other birds, such
    as the peacock, swan, turkey, pheasant, cock, heron, egret, osprey, eagle, ibis,
    rhea, emu, adjutant, grebe, marabout, stork, and widgeon yield feathers which
    are used in ornament.

    In preparing feathers for use, they are tied up in bundles and washed in warm
    soap and water to free them from grease. The soap is then rinsed out in clean
    hot water, and they are then plunged into boiling water into which a few drops
    of saffron distillate have been mixed. After further rinsing, they are drawn quickly
    through cold water with a mixture of a little ground agaric, and are then steamed
    over sulphur fumes and dried. The shafts are scraped to make them limber, and
    the filaments or feathery parts are patted gently with special light-weight hammers.

    Minnie had wheelbarrow-loads of feathers delivered to her apartment by a team
    of feather-gatherers drawn from different bird-houses scattered throughout the
    town. Working like a drudge, she made all the costumes herself, scarcely pausing
    to sleep. As each costume was finished, Bruno packed it into a large cardboard
    packet and delivered it personally to the recipient. In turn, at intervals of
    a few hours, Aminadab, Bewg, Chodd, Darningneedle, Eck, Freakpit, Gum, Dr Hoist
    and the others answered their doors to find the terrifyingly pale figure of Bruno
    standing before them, the packet in one hand and an invitation to the funeral
    in the other.

    Minnie had commissioned a rancorous Stalinist hobbledehoy to illuminate the invitations.
    Josef Megrimovitch Bong lived in a pigeon-loft above one of the finest houses
    in the town, and seemed to subsist on a diet of rusks, mugwort, and tap water.
    His creaking, spavined frame, clad in a muddy black cape, was often seen stalking
    aimlessly along the boulevards, spitting at children and stamping on puppies.
    Minnie was his only friend--even Talc had loathed him--and spying him on her way
    back from the screeching of the will, she dropped some rusted coins into his hand
    and bid him draw up the invitations. For though he was almost universally hated,
    every Finn who knew him had to admit that Bong''s calligraphy was of stupendous
    beauty.

    "Know ye," read the invitation, "That Professor Lars Talc was struck by lightning
    on Tuesday last, as he bestrode the Avenue Ack. Aye, weep, for the great Finnish
    polymath is no more! The huge throbbing brain is stilled! Mourn with every particle
    of your yet quick being! You are commanded to be present at his Obsequies. At
    dawn on Sunday we will gather at the gazebo on Pilgarlic Hill. Be there, or abominations
    will rain down upon you. And wear these feathers, and nought else, for if you
    do not, you will answer to Bruno, and he is fearsome in his wrath! Attend, or
    be besmirched!"

    None dared disobey the call.'
