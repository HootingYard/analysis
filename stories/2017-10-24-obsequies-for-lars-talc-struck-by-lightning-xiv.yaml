    Minnie had chosen well in Potcap. Everything went according to plan. Aloysius
    Batlip supplied a tiny cadet named Vig, who scurried among the mourners with the
    funeral schedule, ticking off the names, logging the times, counting the animals,
    and ensuring that Minnie''s wishes were met to the letter.

    As she had expected, the Reverend Chew''s sermon was the centrepiece of the funeral.
    His ovation lasted for thirteen and three quarter minutes. He stood poised in
    the pulpit of the Gravelflap auditorium, and as the rustle of applause finally
    died, he peered over his sinister spectacles at the twenty-six mourners, cleared
    his throat, and began to speak.

    "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in memory of Lars Talc. How can I, in my
    treacly voice, do justice to the memory of such a man? I could tell you the story
    of his life, but he was ninety-four, and it would take days, even weeks, to recount
    even the merest essentials. Were I to pick only selected, epiphanic incidents--the
    reinvention of bleach, the ascent of the mountain at Hoon, a fist-fight with a
    bus conductor, the creation of the postage stamp zoo--I would be imposing on the
    memory of his life a partial, fragmentary view which would be irreconcilable with
    the mighty genius he was. It will not do. What, then? It has been suggested to
    me that I could sing all one hundred and fourteen works from his magisterial songbook.
    But how could my puny, fluting tones equal the bliss of hearing Talc perform them
    himself? And, thanks to Minnie, we have the tape recordings. No, a recital by
    me would be quite, quite unendurable. How to get the measure of the man? Take
    you on a tour through his wardrobe? Read snatches from his books? Tell childhood
    anecdotes? Bluster? Gabble? Gibber? Hold up his example as a paragon of what it
    means to be a Finn? To be human? None of these will suffice.

    "So let me say this. He owed me a great deal of money. He was covered in dust.
    He couldn''t tell the difference between a heron & a moorhen. He never learned
    the rules of ice hockey. He was often plagued by mysterious boils. He had a scar
    on his left shin. He confused the different metallic elements. His hair was often
    unkempt. He set fire to a Bible. His pigs were neglected. Adept at ping pong,
    he weighted his bat. He once suffered from scrofula. His tent had many holes.
    He never wore a hat. His gas bills drove him crackers. He spoke umpteen languages.
    His mother told me he was terrified of swans. Geology was beyond him. He hankered
    for doilies. He counted toads. His bath was made of tin. His first marriage was
    disastrous. He could not ride a bicycle. He spat out mayonnaise. He avoided paying
    for hotel rooms by clambering down fire escapes. Once he built his own bridge.
    He burned himself in effigy. He loved to eat turnips. He often drooled. His thumbs
    were deformed. Rust and rime engaged his attention. He was much travelled. He
    designed his own pen-nibs. He kept a photograph of Ricardo Montalban in his bureau.
    His eyesight was atrocious. Candles have been lit for him. His credentials were
    spotless. He punched a fishmonger. He gutted huts. Linctus slithered down his
    throat. He owned dozens of fret-saws. He thought the moon was his lover. In Didcot
    he wept. He fed flamingos with cream crackers. In certain circles his name was
    mud. He kept his gutta-percha in a gunny sack. The sight of geese made him anxious.
    He smoked cheroots. He re-counted toads. He held aloft a blubber-lantern on the
    banks of a duckpond. His saliva was bitter. Taxes were levied upon him. He had
    a zest for crumpled things. In parks he pondered. He bit his fingernails. He chewed
    spinach. At a pinch he would talk for hours on the subject of straw. He wiped
    his bottom with leaves. He wrote a book about gnats. He mumbled through a tube.
    Things dangled from the ceiling of his boudoir. He lost on the horses. He wrapped
    a tortoise in blankets. As a youth he survived on crusts. His father painted difficult
    maps. Often he behaved like a madman. Twigs and branches fell unremarked in his
    garden. Rowing held no allure for him. He dabbed at his brow with ointments. He
    was fond of cormorants. He coaxed mice from their nooks. He was knocked down by
    a runaway bus. Clods of earth surrounded him. He could be petulant. He strained
    things in a muslin net. He pulverised a diving board with his bare hands. Morse
    code baffled him. He nearly became a marine. He moved his arms towards the lake.
    Under a cow tower he looked at planks. He overcame his stutter. His sheep had
    worms. He crossed himself. He played at bagatelle. He spied a crocus. He fainted.
    He snored. He panted. He sprayed. His stomach. His hearing aid. His cuffs. His
    gristle. His sponge. His batteries. His hardship. His chutney. His paths. His
    windows. His calcium. His rudders. His vinegar. His seeds. His nettles. His sores.
    His stool. His plastic. His incandescence. Autumn. Shipwreck. Curtains. Exile.
    Frost. Balconies. Pandaemonium. Hedgerows. Banisters. Carpets. Hinges. Remembrance.
    Hair. Custard. Dribble. Fanfares. Dampness. Bauxite. Trousers. Canals. Boskage.
    Lasciviousness. Tunics. Spigots. Iron. Lint. Cranks. Floozies. Doppelgangers.
    Tin. Bales. Agony. Loss. Lust. Love. Crack. Bang. Crunlop. Lars Talc is dead."'
