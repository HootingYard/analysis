text: "The church of St Adalbert, in the market square of Krakow, is almost a thousand\
  \ years old. On one side of it there is a low wall\u2014much more recent\u2014on\
  \ the inner part of which, for no apparent reason, a single small tile has been\
  \ embedded.\n\nOn this tile is depicted a bird. This bird has recently been designated\
  \ as the Hooting Yard Bird Emblem. Next time you go to Krakow, make sure you pay\
  \ due obeisance to the bird by sprawling on the ground before it and thinking of\
  \ Dobson.\n"
