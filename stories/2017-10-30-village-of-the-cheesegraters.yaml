  text: "As I made my way through the world, along lanes and pathways lined by larch,\
    \ laburnum, and pine, I came at last to the village of the cheesegraters. Here,\
    \ I thought, is somewhere I can lay my hat. My hat is not a cheese-hat. It will\
    \ not be grated.\nAnd it was not. But nor was it admired, as I felt sure it would\
    \ be. No villager came up to me to say \u201CCor blimey, what a splendid titfer\
    \ you've got there atop your head, meinheer!\u201D Rather, they seemed a sullen\
    \ people, jowly and hoarse, and sullen, sullen.\nIn the village square I sat,\
    \ to observe their ways. I jotted no notes in my jotting pad. It struck me, and\
    \ forcibly, forcibly, that they seemed to grate more marzipan than cheese. The\
    \ air was scented with almond. Theirs was a sullen grating.\nThere were many gratings,\
    \ too, punctuating the paving slabs of the path crisscrossing the square. Metal\
    \ gratings that gleamed in the sunlight in lattice patterns of stupendous complexity,\
    \ like the most delicate of lacework. What lay beneath those gratings?, I wondered.\
    \ Drains and sewers, drains and sewers, came the reply, whispered on the breeze.\n\
    Do not scoff when I suggest I was spoken to by the wind, by the stirrings of the\
    \ almond-scented air. That is how it is in the village of the cheesegraters, that\
    \ sullen place, where cheese comes cheap, and marzipan cheaper.\nIt was a tiny\
    \ village, and when I left the square I was soon enough out in open country. Now\
    \ there was no wind to speak of, or to speak to me. All was still and silent.\
    \ I saw a bird in the sky, but I know nothing of ornithology. I passed on, my\
    \ splendid titfer atop my head, towards another village."
