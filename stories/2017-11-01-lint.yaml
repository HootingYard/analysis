  text: 'Once upon a time Dobson decided to write a pamphlet on the subject of lint.

    Thus begins Ted Cack''s mammoth new book The Lint Pamphlet : An Enduring Mystery.
    It is the latest in a series of mammoth books, each one devoted to a single work
    by Dobson, including those which the twentieth century''s titanic pamphleteer
    abandoned, or planned but never wrote, or were mere fugitive throbs within his
    cranium.

    "By the time my work is done", announced Ted Cack at a press conference held at
    the end of a dilapidated seaside pier, buffeted by squalls, earlier this week,
    "The number of words I will have devoted to Dobson''s works will dwarf the number
    of words in all those works put together, however you add them up."

    Quite what he meant by this last phrase is unclear, as there is only one way to
    add things up, as most of us understand the process. Granted, we are not all students
    of advanced mathematics, but then nor is Ted Cack. His profile on the online network
    MyBoast lists several qualifications from several dubious or unimportant institutions,
    most of which appear to be in frankly absurd fields such as Hermeneutic Ornithology
    or Unapplied Faffing.

    As a Dobsonist, however, Ted Cack is peerless. Once the hot-headed enfant terrible
    of Dobson studies, as the years have passed his head has become far less hot.
    Indeed, last time its temperature was measured, his head proved to be so cold
    various medics pronounced him clinically dead. Ted Cack shocked them all by springing
    up from his head-temperatutre-measuring-bed, cutting two or three capers around
    the room a la James Boswell of a morning, dancing either a quadrille or a gavotte
    depending from what angle you viewed it, and singing, with unnerving boisterousness,
    the chorus from "More Than A Feeling" by Boston (Scholz, 1976).

    I''m afraid I must interrupt this riveting narrative. The console is beeping with
    an incoming query. Let me decode it.

    Q--If Ted Cack is peerless, how do you explain his press conference taking place
    on a pier, albeit a dilapidated one?

    The question is more sensible than it seems, much, much more sensible, so sensible
    it takes my breath away (Moroder/Whitlock, 1986; performed by Berlin. Berlin ought
    not be confused with Irving Berlin. The former was an American New Wave band formed
    in Orange County, home of Richard M. Nixon, in 1979. The latter, born Israel Beilin,
    wrote the kinds of songs which would knock anything written by the band into a
    cocked hat.)

    My breath having been taken away, I am unable to answer the question right now,
    but can only pant and wheeze as I struggle to remain conscious. You may be familiar
    with such a struggle, for example when listening to Hooting Yard On The Air, broadcasts
    of which have been known to lull even the most alert listeners into a deep and
    profound sleep, or at least a catnap.

    I should point out here that enquiries, such as the one about peerless Ted Cack
    on a pier, are always welcome, even if I do not always--oh, wait, here is another
    one beeping on the console already!

    Q--I could not help noticing that you have mentioned two pop music combos today,
    both of which take their names from cities beginning with the letter B, that is,
    Boston and Berlin. Are there any other groups with similar nomenclature, for example
    Bridlington, Basingstoke, Biggleswade, Bognor Regis, Broadstairs, Budleigh Salterton,
    or Bungay, to list only a few towns in England?

    If anything, this is an even more sensible question, and one I would be prepared
    to answer here and now were my knowledge of pop music combos more exhaustive than
    it is, but for heaven''s sake, I''m meant to be talking about lint!

    "Perhaps the most startling revelation of my mammoth new book", said Ted Cack
    at that press conference held at the end of a dilapidated seaside pier, buffeted
    by squalls, earlier this week, "is that Dobson seemed to be wholly ignorant about
    his proposed subject matter."

    This is not half as startling as Ted Cack thinks it is. It was the out of print
    pamphleteer''s common practice to write endless screeds on topics of which he
    knew nothing whatsoever. The word for this is perpilocution, and Dobson was a
    master of it. Sometimes he liked to pretend he was following the dictum that the
    best way to learn about something is to write a book about it, but this is rather
    belied by the resulting out of print pamphlets, which rarely tell us much about
    anything except the baffling innards of the author''s brain.

    Startling or not, however, Ted Cack paints a compelling picture of Dobson and
    Marigold Chew at breakfast on the morning when the lint spark was lit. The couple
    were tucking into bowls of reconstituted partridge livers in a mustard ''n'' milk
    of magnesia froideur when the pamphleteer suddenly banged his spoon against his
    forehead and burst into unnervingly boisterous song.

    "I want to know what lint is. I want you to show me, Marigold my sweet. I want
    to feel what lint is. I know you can show me.""

    He sang to the tune of "I Want To Know What Love Is" (Jones, 1984; performed by
    Foreigner. Interestingly, all the members of the group actually were foreigners,
    except for those periods when they were present in their home countries.)

    "I think you had better write a pamphlet on the subject, Dobson", said Marigold
    Chew.

    The "enduring mystery" of Ted Cack''s subtitle is that Dobson never did.'
