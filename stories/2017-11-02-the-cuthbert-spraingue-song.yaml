  text: "Cuthbert Spraingue! Cuthbert Spraingue!\n  He's the boss of the Mayonnaise\
    \ Gang!\n  His head's the same colour as his shoes.\n  He darts between elms &\
    \ bays & yews.\n  He came unglued on St Bibblybibdib's Day.\n  A cart pulled up\
    \ to take him away.\n  He fought them off with pins and straw,\n  Just pins and\
    \ straw and nothing more.\n  They say he's related to Nobby Stiles,\n  According\
    \ to the police station files,\n  But he denies any links by blood\n  To Nobby.\
    \ memorably smeared with mud\n  At the end of that match in \u201966.\n  Cuthbert\
    \ Spraingue loathes Weetabix\n  And Coco-pops and Special K.\n  He eschews breakfast\
    \ every day,\n  But his days still go with a bang!\n  For he's the boss of the\
    \ Mayonnaise Gang!\n  Cuthbert Spraingue! Cuthbert Spraingue!"
