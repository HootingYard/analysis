    We all know that God spelled backwards is Dog, but it is not commonly pointed
    out that Ergo spelled backwards is Ogre. This insight can lead us to faff about
    with Descartes'' famous dictum cogito ergo sum so that, instead of stating I think
    therefore I am, we say instead I think I am an ogre.

    It could be argued that this is actually a more profound statement than Descartes''
    original. It could be, and it has. In a new book, the paperbackist Pebblehead
    takes cogito ogre sum as his starting point, and weaves a tale staggering in its
    implications.

    "I am known for my potboilers" said Pebblehead, speaking from his chalet o'' prose
    high in the Swiss Alps, smoking his pipe, "Fat paperbacks with garish covers sold
    in bulk at airport bookstalls and the like. With my new book, I like to think
    I have created an entirely new genre, which I have dubbed the ''potboiler of profundity''.
    This is a fat paperback with a garish cover sold in bulk at airport bookstalls
    and the like which, in terms of deep mind-numbing profundity, can stand alongside
    the deepest and most mind-numbing and most profound works in the canon."

    Bashed out in just two weeks of frantic typing, Pebblehead''s potboiler of profundity
    tells the story of a man who thinks he is an ogre. It poses questions which delve
    into the core of the human soul. If I think I am an ogre, am I an ogre? If I think
    I am an ogre but I am not an ogre, what, then, am I? Why would I think I am an
    ogre in the first place? Am I hairy and brutish and savage? Do I grunt rather
    than speak articulate words? If so, how do I manage to narrate this potboiler
    of profundity in such punchy prose, daddy-o? Answer me that, or I''ll tear your
    head off with my bare hands, or rather paws, yes, great hairy paws, suitable for
    an ogre. And when I''ve torn your head off I''ll carry it back to my lair, a dark
    dank cave, full of bats, where I lurk, grunting and slobbering, ogreishly.

    With your head torn off and tossed on to the pile of other torn-off human heads
    in the corner of my cave, you won''t be able to continue reading my fat paperback
    with a garish cover sold in bulk at airport bookstalls and the like, will you?
    You won''t be able to read, and you won''t be able to think. And if you can''t
    read and you can''t think, can you still call yourself civilised, or are you,
    too, now merely an ogre, albeit one without a head? Ultimately, are we not, all
    of us, wandering the world like headless ogres, searching for our torn-off heads,
    tossed onto piles of other torn-off heads in the corners of dark dank caves? Is
    one of those caves Plato''s cave? Was Plato, too, an ogre? And if Plato was an
    ogre, what of Rene Descartes? And what of you?

    The latest news from Pebblehead is that his own brain has been so bedizened by
    the writing of his potboiler of profundity that he is currently languishing, exhausted,
    on the balcony of a sanatorium even higher in the Swiss Alps. His book is available
    at all good airport bookstalls. We wish him well.'
