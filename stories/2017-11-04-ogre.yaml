  text: "\nWe all know that God spelled backwards is Dog, but it is not commonly pointed\
    \ out that Ergo spelled backwards is Ogre. This insight can lead us to faff about\
    \ with Descartes\u2019 famous dictum cogito ergo sum so that, instead of stating\
    \ I think therefore I am, we say instead I think I am an ogre.\nIt could be argued\
    \ that this is actually a more profound statement than Descartes\u2019 original.\
    \ It could be, and it has. In a new book, the paperbackist Pebblehead takes cogito\
    \ ogre sum as his starting point, and weaves a tale staggering in its implications.\n\
    \u201CI am known for my potboilers\u201D said Pebblehead, speaking from his chalet\
    \ o\u2019 prose high in the Swiss Alps, smoking his pipe, \u201CFat paperbacks\
    \ with garish covers sold in bulk at airport bookstalls and the like. With my\
    \ new book, I like to think I have created an entirely new genre, which I have\
    \ dubbed the \u2018potboiler of profundity\u2019. This is a fat paperback with\
    \ a garish cover sold in bulk at airport bookstalls and the like which, in terms\
    \ of deep mind-numbing profundity, can stand alongside the deepest and most mind-numbing\
    \ and most profound works in the canon.\u201D\nBashed out in just two weeks of\
    \ frantic typing, Pebblehead's potboiler of profundity tells the story of a man\
    \ who thinks he is an ogre. It poses questions which delve into the core of the\
    \ human soul. If I think I am an ogre, am I an ogre? If I think I am an ogre but\
    \ I am not an ogre, what, then, am I? Why would I think I am an ogre in the first\
    \ place? Am I hairy and brutish and savage? Do I grunt rather than speak articulate\
    \ words? If so, how do I manage to narrate this potboiler of profundity in such\
    \ punchy prose, daddy-o? Answer me that, or I'll tear your head off with my bare\
    \ hands, or rather paws, yes, great hairy paws, suitable for an ogre. And when\
    \ I've torn your head off I'll carry it back to my lair, a dark dank cave, full\
    \ of bats, where I lurk, grunting and slobbering, ogreishly.\nWith your head torn\
    \ off and tossed on to the pile of other torn-off human heads in the corner of\
    \ my cave, you won't be able to continue reading my fat paperback with a garish\
    \ cover sold in bulk at airport bookstalls and the like, will you? You won't be\
    \ able to read, and you won't be able to think. And if you can't read and you\
    \ can't think, can you still call yourself civilised, or are you, too, now merely\
    \ an ogre, albeit one without a head? Ultimately, are we not, all of us, wandering\
    \ the world like headless ogres, searching for our torn-off heads, tossed onto\
    \ piles of other torn-off heads in the corners of dark dank caves? Is one of those\
    \ caves Plato's cave? Was Plato, too, an ogre? And if Plato was an ogre, what\
    \ of\_Ren\xE9\_Descartes? And what of you?\nThe latest news from Pebblehead is\
    \ that his own brain has been so bedizened by the writing of his potboiler of\
    \ profundity that he is currently languishing, exhausted, on the balcony of a\
    \ sanatorium even higher in the Swiss Alps. His book is available at all good\
    \ airport bookstalls. We wish him well."
