  text: "This week is meant to be Dobson Week at Hooting Yard (atoll, pickle, mosh\
    \ pit), but we must interrupt with important news o\u2019 toads. Devoted readers\
    \ will recall The Book Of Gnats (collected in the slim anthology We Were Puny,\
    \ They Were Vapid\u2014buy it now if you have not already done so). In part one,\
    \ we read:\nAnd then my eyes saw, standing fiery on a wooden plinth ringed by\
    \ scum-pools, the obscene figure of Winckelmann. In his left hand he brandished\
    \ aloft a scrap of burning linoleum. His right hand was made into a fist. As,\
    \ dribbling, I watched, the fist was slowly opened to reveal a\u2026.. I cannot\
    \ say. I do not know. For just at the moment my peering, watery eyes would have\
    \ seen that\u2026 that thing, I was startled by a toad, which leapt up at my face,\
    \ and thwacked me on the forehead, leaving an imprint which remains there to this\
    \ day, like a brand.\nThe narrator of part one then turns up in part two as The\
    \ Man With The Mark Of The Toad! (He invariably attracts an exclamation mark.)\n\
    Now, years later, far far away and banished to a pompous land, Mr Mike Jennings\
    \ has unearthed this piece of comic book art by the creator of Spiderman, one\
    \ Steve Ditko. An eerie premonition \u2026\n"
