  text: 'Dear Dr Fang, wrote Marigold Chew, I am writing to you, as the most eminent
    brain-quack I can think of, to ask for your help. Dobson has gone doolally. Yesterday
    he was as right as rain--a curious phrase, I grant you, but let us not dwell upon
    it--sitting at his escritoire scribbling away, then trudging along the towpath
    of the filthy old canal in the pouring rain, chucking pebbles at swans.

    He remained reassuringly Dobson-like at breakfast this morning, tucking into a
    bowl of boil-in-the-bag koala bear brains ''n'' mashed plums and blathering inconsequential
    poltrooneries, just as he always does. It was only when he drained the last dregs
    from his tumbler of post-breakfast Squelcho! that I noticed something amiss.

    Instead of putting on his Uruguayan Notary Public''s boots and crashing out of
    the door into the teeming downpour, as I expected him to do, he stayed sitting
    at the breakfast table, a thin smile playing about his lips, a fat beetle scuttling
    through his bouffant, a blob of marmalade on his cravat.

    "Look! Can you see it, O my cherished bundle of utter loveliness?" he said, pointing
    at a corner of the room.

    I could see nothing, save for some dust.

    "It is my little man, my homunculus. He has been following me about, in his satin
    and tat, in his frock coat and bippety-boppety hat. He whispers words I can never
    quite hear."

    I asked Dobson what on earth he was talking about. He continued to prattle.

    "Even were I able to hear him, I am not sure I would be able to understand his
    whisperings. Not only is he a foreign little man, from remote and distant parts
    not shown on any map, but he always whispers with his mouth full. He is forever
    stuffing his gob with smokers'' poptarts, of which he seems to have an endless
    supply. Have you noticed any packets missing from the larder, O my buttercup?"

    "You mean the pantry, Dobson," I said, "No, I have noticed no such thing."

    "Larder, pantry, pantry, larder," he went on, excitably, "Sofa, cushions, chaise
    longue, pouffe. Lay me place and bake me pie, I''m starving for me gravy. Leave
    my shoes and door unlocked, I might just slip away. If I slip away, perhaps I
    can escape my little man. But it''s likely he will follow me. God knows, I haven''t
    been able to shake him off these past seventeen years."

    It was at this point that I asked Dobson if he had taken leave of his senses.
    But he ignored the question.

    "He came seventeen years ago, and to this day he has shown no intention of going
    away," he said, "Sometimes he moves his arms as if they were the propellers on
    a seaplane, the Gnome Omega-powered Fabre Hydravion, for example. I have to place
    extra paperweights on my escritoire when he does this in close proximity to it,
    to prevent my papers being blown away. Are you sure you can''t see him?"

    I assured Dobson that I could not.

    "I think the propelling of his arms is an attempt to dry his hands," he continued,
    "His palms are horribly moist. Indeed, for such a tiny man he is surprisingly
    moist in every particular. Yet whenever he follows me into the bathroom, he shuns
    the towels. They seem to frighten him, as nothing else does. Imagine that, being
    frightened of towels! Tea-towels, too, especially those of a souvenir variety,
    bearing depictions of important buildings and tourist attractions. Once he vomited
    all over the tea-towel we bought in the gift shop at St Bibblybibdib''s Cathedral.
    When I tried to launder it he snatched it away from me and tore it into strips
    and fed it to his chaffinch."

    "What chaffinch?" I could not help but ask.

    "There, perched on his shoulder, tiny but weirdly luminous. It is the only chaffinch
    I know that glows in the dark. Or eats linen. Or monkeys. It ate the little man''s
    little monkey, which he kept at the end of a length of string, during the Tet
    Offensive. It ate the string too. It is quite a chaffinch!"

    By now I was convinced that Dobson had gone doolally. Thinking a violent bash
    on the head might bring him to his senses, I went to fetch a hammer. When I returned,
    there was no sign of him, and the front door was ajar. I looked in the shoe cupboard,
    but all of his many many many boots were lined up neatly along the bootesquade.
    Had Dobson done the unthinkable, and left the house in his socks?

    Indeed he had. Towards midday, also known as noon, when the hands of the clock
    both point upwards in an uncompromising vertical, I received a call from the seaside
    police. Dobson was sat on a pier, bootless, cradling in his arms the limp body
    of a strangled eel, and staring out to sea. His socks were wet, his cravat was
    awry, and there were traces of choc ice around his mouth. A ring of lumpenproles
    had gathered to taunt him. I rushed out and jumped aboard a charabanc heading
    for the seaside.

    The police had removed Dobson from the pier and installed him in a cubby within
    the seagull sanctuary. I had to use all my powers of persuasion to get past the
    armed security guards. I found Dobson sprawled on a bunk looking bewildered.

    "Wincklemann is gone!" he cried.

    "Wincklemann?" I asked.

    "My little man, my homunculus," he said, "He followed me at a trot all the way
    to the seaside, and while I was at the kiosk on the pier buying several choc ices
    he lost his footing and fell from the pier into the sea, the sea, the terrible
    vast wet sea. I fear he drowned therein, my little man."

    It occurred to me that if Wincklemann were as tiny a man as Dobson claimed him
    to be, it was likely that he was so light in weight that he would bippety-bop,
    like his hat, upon the water, rather than sink. Then it further occurred to me
    that Dobson had gone doolally, and that this purported homunculus was nothing
    but a figment of his fuming brain. I was still carrying the hammer, so I gave
    Dobson a smart crack on the head with it, hoping to restore his reason.

    Alas! The hammer blow had quite the opposite effect. While rubbing his bonce,
    Dobson gazed into the corner of the seagull sanctuary cubby and let out a joyful
    yell.

    "Wincklemann! You have escaped from the clutches of the wild wet sea! Where once
    you were moist, you are now soaked to the skin. Were you not fearful of towels
    I would dab you dry. But I am so happy to see you. What is that you are whispering
    to me in your foreign guttural tongue?"

    Of course, there was nothing in the corner except for some dust and a stray seagull
    feather. After signing some papers, and feeding cream crackers to an injured seagull,
    I was allowed to bring Dobson home. It is now early evening, and he has insisted
    on setting a third place at the dinner table, and carefully portioning out a helping
    of jellied hare ''n'' jugged eels ''n'' jagged shards of frozen celery for his
    invisible little man. I am at my wits'' end, Dr Fang, or at the end of my tether,
    whichever end is likely to snap first, and I need your help. Please come at once.


    Dear Mrs Wincklemann, wrote Dr Fang, At your request, I have conducted an examination
    of the brain, for which my fee is forty-five panes, ten soilings, and sixpins.
    Please pay in cash by midnight, or I will confiscate the brain and place it in
    a jar in my cupboard o'' brains, cackling as I do so.

    It is my considered opinion that you are suffering from a common malady, viz.
    indulging a phantasy that you are a personal friend and confidante of the twentieth
    century''s titanic, if out of print, pamphleteer. In your case, there is an intriguing
    level of displacement, where you imagine it is not you, but your husband, who
    is bosom pals with Dobson. Incidentally, your husband is indeed an extremely tiny
    little man who could easily be mistaken for a homunculus. Perhaps that is what
    caused the illusory vapours in your brain.

    As I say, it is not unusual for insignificant riffraff such as yourself to attach
    themselves to illustrious figures such as Dobson. I know of another patient who
    spent many years convinced she was on intimate terms with octogenarian Francophile
    pop songstress Petula Clark. If you take the pills I have given you, six per day
    for seventeen years, your symptoms will surely alleviate. I also recommend close
    reading of Dobson''s pamphlet At No Time Did I Ever Cradle In My Arms The Limp
    Body Of A Strangled Eel Upon A Pier While Taunted By Lumpenproles, And I Have
    Signed A Legal Affidavit To This Effect; And Other Essays, Together With A Spirit
    Photograph Of Petula Clark Holding Hands With A Homunculus (out of print).'
