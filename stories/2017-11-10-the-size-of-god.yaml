  text: "\nReviewing a new book about God in The Spectator, Alexander Waugh notes\n\
    the ancient Jewish Hekhalot gives precise measurements of the space between God's\
    \ thighs and his neck, revealing that from head to toe he is 1,298 billion km\
    \ tall.\n(That's 806\xBD billion miles, for those of us who still use sensible\
    \ measurements.)"
