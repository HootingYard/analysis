    Reviewing a new book about God in The Spectator, Alexander Waugh notes

    the ancient Jewish Hekhalot gives precise measurements of the space between God''s
    thighs and his neck, revealing that from head to toe he is 1,298 billion km tall.

    (That''s 806 1/2  billion miles, for those of us who still use sensible measurements.)'
