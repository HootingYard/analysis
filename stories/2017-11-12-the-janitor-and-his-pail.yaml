  text: "It's the Weekend o\u2019 Janitors here at Hooting Yard. Yesterday we had\
    \ that guff about the janitor and his mop, from 2014. Today we have related guff,\
    \ also from that year, about the janitor and his pail.\nThe relationship between\
    \ a janitor and his pail is a matter well worth our attention. Some janitors will\
    \ call their pail a bucket, but it is much of a muchness. It may well be that,\
    \ for the pernickety, a pail and a bucket are not quite the same thing, but we\
    \ are not pernickety, at least not today. Today we are having one of our non-pernickety\
    \ days. Good heavens, we did not even time the boiling of our breakfast egg to\
    \ the second, as we do on our pernickety days. No, today, we plopped the egg into\
    \ the pan and set the burners roaring beneath it and we wandered away, picked\
    \ up the post from the doormat, kicked the wainscot, kicked it again, God knows\
    \ why, chucked the post into the wastepaper basket\u2014it was all flyers, flyers\u2014\
    put the kettle on, extracted from our majestic bouffant a small beetle which had\
    \ taken up residence, Peason-like, and placed it on the windowsill, opened the\
    \ window, adjusted the position of the vase of hollyhock cuttings, turning them\
    \ towards the light, though Lord knows there was little enough light, so early\
    \ was the hour, and pottered and puttered in other dithery ways before returning\
    \ to the kitchen to set the burners unroaring beneath the pan, without checking\
    \ the time on our wristwatch, rather judging that a sufficiency had passed for\
    \ the egg in the pan to be toothsome when shelled.\nOn a pernickety day, on the\
    \ other hand, we would not leave our post, by the cooker, but count the minutes\
    \ and the seconds, gazing from wristwatch to pan and back again, and as the second\
    \ hand on the watch tocked to its appointed spot we would immediately lift the\
    \ pan from the roaring burners, extinguish them, hoist the egg from the seething\
    \ waters and transfer it to its egg-cup\u2014a souvenir egg-cup from an ill-starred\
    \ seaside resort\u2014sure in the knowledge that it had been boiled for a very\
    \ specific and particular length of time as recommended in Bl\xF6tzmann's Manual\
    \ of Egg-Boiling (second edition, lilac series). Thus the variation between our\
    \ pernickety and our non-pernickety days, a variation designed to crack us from\
    \ the bonds of rut.\nWhat does all that have to do with janitors and pails or,\
    \ if you prefer, janitors and buckets? Little or nothing, like the littleness\
    \ of the light as we tuck into our early morning boiled egg, like the nothingness\
    \ at the core of our all too mortal soul."
