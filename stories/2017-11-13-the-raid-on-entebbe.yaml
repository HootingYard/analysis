    The Raid On Entebbe (disambiguation).

    The Raid On Entebbe can refer to :

    a hostage-rescue mission carried out by commandos of the Israeli Defence Force
    at Entebbe Airport in Uganda on 4 July 1976;

    a 1977 film dramatisation of the incident starring Peter Finch (whose surname
    is also the common term for medium-sized passerine birds in the family Fringillidae);

    the given name of a pet hamster kept by the potboiling paperbackist Pebblehead.

    Pebblehead was once asked in an interview why he had named his hamster The Raid
    On Entebbe. This is what he said by way of reply:

    "I don''t know what you''re talking about. I haven''t got a pet hamster. I grant
    you, there is a small cage over there, fitted with a wheel for a small mammal
    to run around on like a mad thing, and lined with excelsior, or wood wool, for
    the comfort of such a small mammal, and, yes, there is a strong hamstery odour
    in the vicinity of the cage. But I challenge you to show me an actual hamster."

    Thus challenged, the journalist interviewing Pebblehead pointed to what looked
    undoubtedly like a hamster, nestling in the corner of the cage, almost covered
    in excelsior, and fast asleep.

    "Blimey!" said Pebblehead, "Where did that come from?"

    A press statement was later issued on Pebblehead''s behalf by a crack team of
    brain-doctors.

    "For some time now, Pebblehead has been suffering from what the medical profession
    terms intermittent hamster-blindness. The condition is debilitating and incurable,
    although the symptoms can be alleviated with a combination of intravenous drugs,
    eye drops, and frenzied activity, for example, bashing out potboilers on a typewriter
    at the rate of several novels a week. Incidentally, all of us have previously
    served as commandos in the Israeli Defence Force, so if you know of any hostages
    who need to be rescued from African airfields, do drop us a line."

    Pebblehead''s latest potboiler, Invisible Hamster Mayhem!, is now available from
    all good petshops.'
