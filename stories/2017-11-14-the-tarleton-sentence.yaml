  text: "So baffled were the police by the teeming ramifications of the Inspip case\
    \ that they had no idea what to do, until a dejected inspector threw in the towel\
    \ and suggested, reluctantly, that they call in Tarleton, the amateur's amateur,\
    \ in hope that he might hack a clearing through their mental forest, to which\
    \ Tarleton's response, upon receipt of the coppers\u2019 telegram, was to instruct\
    \ his helpmeet, the dwarf Crepusco, to pay them a visit and pull one of his faces\
    \ at them, to which Crepusco's response was \u201CAre you sure?\u201D, said in\
    \ a trembling voice, for he was all too aware that when he pulled one of his faces\
    \ the effect on those who saw it was akin to something from a story by H P Lovecraft,\
    \ reducing the witness to a horror-stricken gibbering wreck, fit only to be chained\
    \ up in an asylum for the incurably insane for the rest of their days, but Tarleton\
    \ insisted, telling Crepusco to pull face number forty-three, expressive of fathomless\
    \ and bitter contempt, so the dwarf toddled off along the lane towards the police\
    \ station, and on his way encountered, as chance would have it, one of the teeming\
    \ ramifications of the Inspip case, in that, not too far along the way, he tripped\
    \ and toppled into the bottomless viper-pit of Shoeburyness, and was mightily\
    \ surprised, after falling just a few feet, to land with a crunch upon a false\
    \ bottom in the viper-pit, a platform installed by unknown hand, possibly but\
    \ not definitively Inspip's, the crunchy nature of his landing caused by the bescatterment,\
    \ upon the platform, of eggshells in great abundance, with no sign whatsoever\
    \ of the eggs\u2019 innards, the albumen and yellow yolk and whatever else an\
    \ egg expert might descry inside an egg, there were just the shells, upon which\
    \ Crepusco landed, crunchily, before sitting up and rubbing his bonce and wondering\
    \ why he had not continued to fall, forever and ever, as ought surely to have\
    \ been his fate, the viper-pit of Shoeburyness, like that of Gaar, and several\
    \ others, being notorious for being bottomless, according to the guidebooks and\
    \ gazetteers available from the souvenir kiosk located at one end of a sort of\
    \ modern-day ley line, along which magnets ceased to function and clumps of vetch\
    \ and bindweed withered, at the other end of which stood, surrounded by an imposing\
    \ fence fitted with floodlights, the police station, wherein the frazzled coppers\
    \ were still awaiting a response from Tarleton, the amateur's amateur, and busying\
    \ themselves meanwhile by rummaging, for the umperumpteenth time, through their\
    \ miles of filing cabinets in which every last scrap of information regarding\
    \ the Inspip case was kept, from that very first report of an eye-witness, a preternaturally\
    \ alert passer-by, who had tested negative for hallucinogens, thrice, and who\
    \ had brought, breathlessly, panting, panting, to the coppers\u2019 attention\
    \ the curious circumstance that in Scroonhoonpooge Model Village, the aviary,\
    \ behind the milk factory, was life-size, and filled with real birds, such that\
    \ they would appear enormous and monstrous to the tiny little figures populating\
    \ the model village, and their caws and chirps and chirrups and trills deafeningly\
    \ loud, and that this anomaly was just the kind of thing Inspip would clap his\
    \ hands with glee over, though try as they might not a single officer could say\
    \ with any certainty, hand on heart, that Inspip had form in the area, nor indeed\
    \ that he even knew where the Scroonhoonpooge Model Village was, given that all\
    \ reported sightings of him for the past two decades placed him elsewhere, and\
    \ he had been banned from consulting maps and atlases for even longer than that,\
    \ ever since the Botched Shadow Puppetry case, when he was, albeit briefly, in\
    \ cahoots, or \u201Cup to his eyeballs\u201D as Detective Captain Cargpan put\
    \ it, with Babinsky, the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopathic serial killer,\
    \ an alliance that was mercifully short-lived, thanks to Cargpan, the very same\
    \ Cargpan who, now, rummaging in one of the filing cabinets, chanced upon a tattered\
    \ black-and-white snapshot of an unidentified acrobat performing an unidentified\
    \ feat of acrobatics which would have seemed physically impossible were it not\
    \ for the photographic evidence, and on a whim, or accident, the detective captain\
    \ looked at the snapshot from a geometrically unlikely angle, and saw suddenly\
    \ what nobody else had seen before, himself included, which was that, in her poise\
    \ and turpsiletto, the acrobat seemed to be personating the exact lineaments of\
    \ the stick-figure in the corner of an emblem on the flag of a secret society\
    \ the doings, or misdoings, of which had ravaged several important colonial outposts\
    \ and not a few unimportant ones at the tail end of the war, one of the wars,\
    \ and which had long been thought consigned to the dustbin of history but which,\
    \ Cargpan now realised, with a Lovecraftian shudder, could indeed still be active,\
    \ and engaged in nefarious shenanigans, here and now, and particularly in the\
    \ model village at Scroonhoonpooge, and he grabbed a butcher's pencil and began\
    \ scribbling frenziedly in his coppers\u2019 jotting pad, and then he rummaged\
    \ in some of the other filing cabinets, and tore some of his hair out, until he\
    \ jumped up on to a desk in the middle of the situation room, gaining the immediate\
    \ and rapt attention of all the other coppers, to whom he cried, ear-piercingly,\
    \ \u201CWhere are the eggs? Where are the eggs?\u201D, and they all knew at once\
    \ he was referring to the various birds\u2019 eggs laid by the anomalously life-size\
    \ birds in the aviary of the model village, and, gosh, this is exciting, at that\
    \ very moment Crepusco the dwarf, who had managed to clamber out of the temporarily\
    \ non-bottomless viper-pit of Shoeburyness, came blundering into the room, dozens\
    \ of bits of eggshell clinging to his clothing, and he was about to pull his fathomless\
    \ and bitter contempt face, number forty-three, when a sixth sense stopped him,\
    \ seeing the blazing eyes of Detective Captain Cargpan and all the other coppers\
    \ gazing at him with an unmistakeable gleam of dawning understanding and clarity,\
    \ as when pennies drop from heaven, every time it rains, and the clouds burst\
    \ and it was raining now, as it always rains on the feast day of St Bibblybibdib,\
    \ for yes!, this all happened on St Bibblybibdib's Day, which is why it is significant,\
    \ and why I have told you about it, for had it happened on any other day in the\
    \ calendar year it would hardly be worth mentioning, and it would have remained\
    \ one of those untold stories of Tarleton, the amateur's amateur, untold and unknown,\
    \ never collected in any of the many volumes devoted to his doings, all of which,\
    \ like the pamphlets of the pamphleteer Dobson, are out of print."
