    When, recently, it was announced that the Nobel Prize for Literature had been
    awarded to Kazuo Ishiguro, I thought I ought to read one of his books. Leaning
    out of the window, I hailed a passing urchin and sent him scampering off to what
    passes for a lending library in my bailiwick. Now this young wastrel was either
    inattentive or hard of hearing, for when he returned, several hours later, he
    brought, not The Redundancy Of Courage but The Consistency Of Porridge, a book
    by the noted food writer Rex Foodwrite.

    Exasperated, I smacked the urchin on the head, but I took the book anyway and
    sat down to read it. And what a revelation! Foodwrite gives a day-by-day account,
    in exhaustive detail, of the consistency of his breakfast porridge over a two-day
    period. His prose is at once Miltonic and Kafkaesque, Beckettian and Poeish, Bellowy
    and Ibarguengoitiaian. At times I was reminded of Pebblehead.

    "For many years I have been strictly an eggs ''n'' bloaters man," he writes, "But
    in the interests of tiptop literature of the highest quality, worthy of a Nobel
    Prize, I decided to eschew my usual breakfast for a couple of days and eat porridge
    instead. On the first day, it was thin, like gruel. On the second day, it was
    thick, like sludge."

    Over the succeeding 849 pages, the author proceeds to extrapolate from this pair
    of porridge consistencies a series of dazzling porridge-related extrapolations.
    Not the least of his insights is his contention that the consistency of porridge,
    at breakfast time, can serve as a dramatic bit of folderol in an award-winning
    motion picture starring a Welsh actor who is tortured by the realisation that
    his speaking voice is not, and never will be, as golden as that of his late compatriot
    Richard Burton. One only needs to hear the latter intone the words "Broadsword
    to Danny Boy" in Where Eagles Dare (Brian G Hutton, 1968) to know this, of course,
    but Rex Foodwrite goes on to provide a shot-by-shot analysis of the film, porridgeless
    as it is, which left this reader, at least, stunned.

    When I recovered consciousness, The Consistency Of Porridge had fallen from my
    lap on to the floor, where it was being nibbled by mice. I never returned it to
    the lending library.

    ADDENDUM : The Redundancy Of Courage is a novel by Timothy Mo, not Kazuo Ishiguro.
    This rather destroys the conceit of the above potsage [sic]. Oops.'
