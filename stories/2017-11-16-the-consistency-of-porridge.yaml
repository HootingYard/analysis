  text: "\nWhen, recently, it was announced that the Nobel Prize for Literature had\
    \ been awarded to Kazuo Ishiguro, I thought I ought to read one of his books.\
    \ Leaning out of the window, I hailed a passing urchin and sent him scampering\
    \ off to what passes for a lending library in my bailiwick. Now this young wastrel\
    \ was either inattentive or hard of hearing, for when he returned, several hours\
    \ later, he brought, not The Redundancy Of Courage but The Consistency Of Porridge,\
    \ a book by the noted food writer Rex Foodwrite.\nExasperated, I smacked the urchin\
    \ on the head, but I took the book anyway and sat down to read it. And what a\
    \ revelation! Foodwrite gives a day-by-day account, in exhaustive detail, of the\
    \ consistency of his breakfast porridge over a two-day period. His prose is at\
    \ once Miltonic and Kafkaesque, Beckettian and Poeish, Bellowy and Ibarg\xFCengoitiaian.\
    \ At times I was reminded of Pebblehead.\n\u201CFor many years I have been strictly\
    \ an eggs \u2018n\u2019 bloaters man,\u201D he writes, \u201CBut in the interests\
    \ of tiptop literature of the highest quality, worthy of a Nobel Prize, I decided\
    \ to eschew my usual breakfast for a couple of days and eat porridge instead.\
    \ On the first day, it was thin, like gruel. On the second day, it was thick,\
    \ like sludge.\u201D\nOver the succeeding 849 pages, the author proceeds to extrapolate\
    \ from this pair of porridge consistencies a series of dazzling porridge-related\
    \ extrapolations. Not the least of his insights is his contention that the consistency\
    \ of porridge, at breakfast time, can serve as a dramatic bit of folderol in an\
    \ award-winning motion picture starring a Welsh actor who is tortured by the realisation\
    \ that his speaking voice is not, and never will be, as golden as that of his\
    \ late compatriot Richard Burton. One only needs to hear the latter intone the\
    \ words \u201CBroadsword to Danny Boy\u201D in Where Eagles Dare (Brian G Hutton,\
    \ 1968) to know this, of course, but Rex Foodwrite goes on to provide a shot-by-shot\
    \ analysis of the film, porridgeless as it is, which left this reader, at least,\
    \ stunned.\nWhen I recovered consciousness, The Consistency Of Porridge had fallen\
    \ from my lap on to the floor, where it was being nibbled by mice. I never returned\
    \ it to the lending library.\nADDENDUM\_: The Redundancy Of Courage is a novel\
    \ by Timothy Mo, not Kazuo Ishiguro. This rather destroys the conceit of the above\
    \ potsage [sic]. Oops."
