  text: '

    What once was spineless has now acquired a spine. That old pamphlet Obsequies
    For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning is newly available in an almost but not quite
    facsimile paperback edition. Only twenty-five copies of the original were printed--now
    every single one of you lot can buy as many copies as you like. Which I hope and
    pray you will. What with Christmas approaching, what better gift to give to those
    dearest to you, including that crumpled Jesuit hiding in the broom-cupboard?

    Go to Lulu to place your order(s) right this minute. It''s the sensible thing
    to do.'
