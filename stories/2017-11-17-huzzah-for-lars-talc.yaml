  text: "\nWhat once was spineless has now acquired a spine. That old pamphlet Obsequies\
    \ For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning is newly available in an almost but not quite\
    \ facsimile paperback edition. Only twenty-five copies of the original were printed\u2014\
    now every single one of you lot can buy as many copies as you like. Which I hope\
    \ and pray you will. What with Christmas approaching, what better gift to give\
    \ to those dearest to you, including that crumpled Jesuit hiding in the broom-cupboard?\n\
    Go to Lulu to place your order(s) right this minute. It's the sensible thing to\
    \ do."
