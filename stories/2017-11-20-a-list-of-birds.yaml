  text: Eleven years ago, I devoted an episode of Hooting Yard On The Air to reading
    out a list of 601 birds, plus an astronomer, a newsreader, 2 jazzmen, 5 film directors,
    and 34 stars of stage and screen. This recording--hugely significant both culturally
    and ornithologically--has now been made readily available, split into three parts
    by dint of YouTubeosity. I strongly advise you lot to listen to the whole thing,
    repeatedly, umpteen times a day, until you have it committed to memory. You will
    find it invaluable next time you are leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece
    at a sophisticated cocktail party and there is a lull in the conversation.
