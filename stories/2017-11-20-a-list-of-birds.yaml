  text: "Eleven years ago, I devoted an episode of Hooting Yard On The Air to reading\
    \ out a list of 601 birds, plus an astronomer, a newsreader, 2 jazzmen, 5 film\
    \ directors, and 34 stars of stage and screen. This recording\u2014hugely significant\
    \ both culturally and ornithologically\u2014has now been made readily available,\
    \ split into three parts by dint of YouTubeosity. I strongly advise you lot to\
    \ listen to the whole thing, repeatedly, umpteen times a day, until you have it\
    \ committed to memory. You will find it invaluable next time you are leaning insouciantly\
    \ against a mantelpiece at a sophisticated cocktail party and there is a lull\
    \ in the conversation."
