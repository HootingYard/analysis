  text: "Lars and Maud went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.\n  Lars fell down\
    \ and clonked his crown and Maud came tumbling after.\n  They rolled and tumbled\
    \ further down, tumbling pell mell,\n  'Til they came bumping to a halt down in\
    \ the dingly dell.\n  In the dell lurked the Grunty Man, who carried them off\
    \ to his cave.\n  But fear not, tinies! For Lars was bold and Maud was very brave.\n\
    \  They shook their little fists and bawled and rent the sky asunder,\n  And made\
    \ the Grunty Man commit a very foolish blunder.\n  He dropped them at the cave-mouth\
    \ while he went to have a fight,\n  An illegal boxing match under the cover of\
    \ the night.\n  The Grunty Man was pitted 'gainst an awful, dreadful foe -\n \
    \ None other than Miss Peep, affectionately known as \"Little Bo\".\n  She looked\
    \ so pale and timorous, yet she packed a hefty punch,\n  And often bashed a dozen\
    \ ogres before she had her lunch.\n  So when the Grunty Man stalked off to meet\
    \ his Nemesis,\n  Lars and Maud ran off into the arms of Alger Hiss.\n  Yes, Alger\
    \ Hiss, the communist spy from Washington DC!\n  Urbane and droll and stylish,\
    \ dressed up to a T.\n  He took the tots to a meeting of his fellow-travelling\
    \ Reds,\n  Where Stalinist propaganda turned their pointy little heads.\n  They\
    \ went back to the cave and found the Grunty Man covered in gore.\n  Little Bo\
    \ Peep had bashed him up, then bashed him up some more.\n  They recruited him\
    \ to their cause, to overthrow the state.\n  Said Lars (or Maud) \"We must act\
    \ before it is too late!\"\n  So Lars and Maud and the Grunty Man went back to\
    \ the dingly dell,\n  And hid some microfilmed secrets at the bottom of the well.\n\
    \  But they were caught by Nixon, indefatigable in his zest\n  To place as many\
    \ Reds as possible under house arrest.\n  He confined them to a house atop the\
    \ hill they climbed for water,\n  A solid and a sturdy house well built from bricks\
    \ and mortar,\n  Like the house of the three little pigs that withstood lupine\
    \ huff and puff.\n  But Lars and Maud and the Grunty Man were Communists, sure\
    \ enough.\n  So when the big bad wolf hove into view from o'er the hills,\n  They\
    \ sang in praise of Stalin and then swallowed their cyanide pills.\n  And so the\
    \ state was safe once more from Communist infiltration,\n  And Nixon was bathed\
    \ in the praise of a relieved and grateful nation.\n  The Grunty Man and Lars\
    \ and Maud were buried and forgot.\n  But Richard Milhous Nixon--he is not.\n\
