    Hello readers! I am going to show you how to make a lovely scale model of Dealey
    Plaza, the site in Dallas, Texas, of the Kennedy assassination on 22 November
    1963.

    First, get some plasticine. Before removing the packaging, wash your hands thoroughly
    in warm water. If your hands are really grubby, for instance if you have been
    doing grubby things, use swarfega. I am making no moral judgement on your indulgence
    in grubby practices, merely noting that warm water by itself will not suffice
    to cleanse the pollution from your fleshly extremities. As for your immortal soul,
    far be it from me to pronounce upon the peril in which it is placed by your unconscionable
    grubbiness. After all, I am no saint. That being said, I abhor the kind of grubbiness
    to which you may have fallen prey, albeit I do not make it my business to go about
    declaring my own rectitude, for that would be to boast, and thus itself sinful.
    Once or twice, maybe, I have dipped my toe in the slimy puddle of moral turpitude,
    and that was quite enough for me.

    Now to the second stage of this exciting project. With your prayer book or catechism
    resting upon the work surface in easy reach, open the packet of plasticine. Intone
    three Hail Marys, break off some plasticine, and begin to mould it into the shape
    of the grassy knoll. It is advisable at this point to go and fetch your rosary
    beads.

    Before completing the grassy knoll part of the model, open up that tin of swarfega
    and clean your hands again. You can never be too careful.

    When you have made a passable model of the grassy knoll, take some matchsticks
    and press them into the plasticine to represent the white picket fence. Say a
    Novena. Now grab another chunk of plasticine and fashion a miniature version of
    the Texas Schoolbook Depository. Remember to tweak a tiny tubular shape poking
    out of the sixth floor window to show assassin Lee Harvey Oswald''s mail order
    Mannlicher- Carcano rifle with which he shot the President. Some people would
    insert the word "allegedly" into that sentence, but not me. I have read Case Closed
    by Gerald Posner so I know whereof I speak..

    A pink blob of plasticine will do for Jackie Kennedy''s pillbox hat.

    The underpass over the Stemmons Freeway is quite tricky to make out of plasticine,
    so you may wish to use a few bits of cardboard. Your local supermarket probably
    has packaging and boxes piled up somewhere for customers to take away. Go and
    get sufficient boxes to cut enough cardboard for the underpass, and while you
    are out and about, drop into your nearest Catholic church and make your confession
    to Father O''Flaherty. If your priest has a different name, don''t worry. If you
    don''t have a priest, do worry, for you will burn in hell, however skilfully you
    manage to complete your plasticine and cardboard model of Dealey Plaza.

    When you return home, your soul now washed clean of all disgusting filth, put
    the finishing touches to your model by curving a rectangle of plasticine into
    the shape of the pergola from where the Zapruder footage was shot. If you have
    exhausted your tin of swarfega, plunge your hands into a basin of piping hot soapy
    water while contemplating the martyrdom of your favourite saint.

    Place your toy Dealey Plaza in a suitable location, for example, on the mantelpiece,
    display cabinet, or kitchen table. Next time Father O''Flaherty drops in for a
    cup of tea, ask him to bless your model by sprinkling it with holy water. He will
    be happy to oblige, I am sure.

    ADDENDUM : Gerald Posner''s Case Closed, and indeed all of the thousands of books
    about the Kennedy assassination, have been superseded by the magnificently hefty
    Reclaiming History by Vincent Bugliosi. Over fifteen hundred pages (with exhaustive
    footnotes added on a compyooduh disc), Bugliosi proves Oswald acted alone, and
    demolishes all the many and various conspiracy theories with awe-inspiring skill.
    There need never be another book o the subject--though no doubt madcaps and nutters
    will continue with their folderol.'
