  text: "Talk to any spelunker and you will soon learn that nobody who strays into\
    \ the horrible cave emerges with their wits intact. Sometimes their hair turns\
    \ white, they shake and gibber, they have to be fed with slops. Others retire\
    \ to farmyards and spend the rest of their lives among pot-bellied pigs. Yet still\
    \ the reckless and the foolhardy risk their sanity by ignoring the big signpost\
    \ I hammered into the ground at the approach to the horrible cave. This is the\
    \ horrible cave, reads my notice, If you have a shred of sense you will durst\
    \ not enter. I spent quite some time on that wording, and ended up in hospital\
    \ because I chewed the end of my pencil so fretfully that I contracted lead poisoning.\
    \ It is by no means a pretty ailment, but I would much rather suffer that than\
    \ the terrible derangements of those who step but once into the horrible cave.\n\
    While I was in the hospital, I was visited by a government agent who was curious\
    \ about my signpost. I suspected he was from some secret agency, for he was dressed\
    \ in a trim black suit and did not remove his sunglasses. He had a very close-cropped\
    \ haircut, carried an attach\xE9 case which I noticed was chained to his wrist,\
    \ and he seemed to exude the scent of frangipani or dogbane, which is often a\
    \ telltale sign of covert operatives in my country. Standing beside the bed on\
    \ which I lay splayed out, he introduced himself as Christopher Plummer. \u201C\
    Not to be confused with the actor who played Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt Of The\
    \ Sun,\u201D he added hurriedly, although at that time the name was new to me.\
    \ I have since followed the agent's namesake's career with growing interest.\n\
    I was subjected to a series of questions about the signpost I had placed near\
    \ the horrible cave, and answered as best as I could, given my fevered state.\
    \ The agent made notes on a little hand-held pneumatic turbonotepad of ingenious\
    \ design. I often find myself wondering why they never caught on. These days you\
    \ are lucky to find one at a jumble sale or in a junk shop, luckier still if all\
    \ the notes made on it are still readable. When Christopher Plummer had finished\
    \ interrogating me in his strangely stiff manner, he depressed a knob on the turbopad\
    \ and, with a surprisingly loud hiss, it clunked into hibernation mode. I watched\
    \ the jet of escaping steam.\nYears later, sitting in a caf\xE9 in a tremendous\
    \ town, flicking idly through an intelligence journal, I learned that Agent Plummer\
    \ had been exposed as an alien life-form from some far planet riddled with horrible\
    \ caves. I thought how fortunate we were to have only one horrible cave, terrible\
    \ as it was.\nLast week I hiked out that way to see if my signpost was still there.\
    \ Prancing majestically along the path, I encountered dozens of terrified people\
    \ being attacked by cows. Sorry, that was a typing error. I should have said being\
    \ attacked by crows. One poor wretch who had been pecked at was slumped beside\
    \ his makeshift tent, fruitlessly trying to wrap a bandage around his head. I\
    \ knelt down beside him and gave him a hand, and could not resist asking what\
    \ was happening, but he was unable to speak. I surmised, however, that the crows\
    \ must have flown from the direction of the horrible cave. Perhaps they nested\
    \ there unbeknown to the local bird inspectors. It seemed like a good idea to\
    \ forget about my signpost for the day and go to the headquarters of the bird\
    \ inspection team instead, so that's what I did.\nAlthough it was at least fourteen\
    \ years since last I had roamed these parts, I still recalled the bus routes,\
    \ so after making sure the pecked man's head bandage was not too tight, I changed\
    \ direction and cut across the moors towards the bus stop. It was a dismaying\
    \ sight, for the shelter was in ruins, and the glass behind which the timetable\
    \ had been pinned up was smashed and the timetable itself torn to shreds. Further\
    \ evidence of violent crow activity, as if any were needed.\nThe bus pulled up\
    \ at this dismal scene a few minutes later. I clambered on board and became somewhat\
    \ uneasy to discover that I was the only passenger. Was this going to be one of\
    \ those frightening journeys where the driver would turn to look at me and I would\
    \ see that he was a fiend in human form, cackling hideously as the bus hurtled\
    \ to perdition? I had forgotten that it was Saint Eustace's Day, and that most\
    \ people, except for me and the bus driver and the people being attacked by crows\
    \ would be staying indoors, in darkness, behind fastened shutters, imploring the\
    \ saint to keep them safe from poisoned air for the coming twelvemonth. I hoped\
    \ that the bird inspection headquarters would at least have a skeleton staff on\
    \ this special day, and settled back in my seat, thinking to take a nap while\
    \ the driver steered his bus around the many dangerous corners on the route.\n\
    When will I ever learn? No sooner had I closed my eyes than the bus braked sharply,\
    \ jolting me out of my seat. The driver cursed, for which I reprimanded him. He\
    \ apologised for his rudery, then pointed in front of him, and I saw that the\
    \ road was blocked by a fanatical preacher man, naked from the waist up, caked\
    \ in filth, standing on a barrel and shouting his head off in a language I had\
    \ never heard before. The driver and I exchanged looks of befuddlement, then he\
    \ reached under his seat and hoisted up a rectangular tin which he opened to reveal\
    \ a clotted mass of stale food. He invited me to share his lunch, but I declined,\
    \ given that there appeared to be a number of weevils crawling about in it. Their\
    \ presence did not bother the driver, who began shovelling the food into his mouth\
    \ with his surprisingly dainty fingers. I noticed that his nails were painted\
    \ with bright red lacquer, flaking off in places as if it had been applied some\
    \ time ago. His eating habits were so repulsive that I turned to look out at the\
    \ preacher man again. He was shouting even louder now. I decided to get off the\
    \ bus to try and persuade him to move his barrel to the side of the road. As I\
    \ got closer to him, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Surely I was mistaken? But\
    \ no, there was no doubting it. Underneath all the caked muck, I recognised my\
    \ father!\n\u201CPapa!\u201D I cried, sudden tears streaming down my face. I may\
    \ as well have been invisible. He ignored me and continued to harangue the sky\
    \ in his unintelligible tongue, the sky that was now growing black as monstrous\
    \ clouds swept in from the west. I am tempted to lie and say that my tears were\
    \ copious, but I have to confess they were not. I snivelled a bit and then remembered\
    \ why I had got off the bus in the first place. It was clear to me, however, that\
    \ asking my father to shift his barrel out of the road would be futile. I wondered\
    \ how it would be if I just pushed him over and cleared the way myself. The laws\
    \ here on toppling preacher men are draconian, and I would have to make sure I\
    \ did not get caught. I judged that the bus driver was too intent on bolting his\
    \ food and would not be paying attention. If he saw me push my pa off the barrel\
    \ he would almost certainly inform on me, for we all know the reputation of bus\
    \ company personnel, hand in hand with the police force, at least in this neck\
    \ of the woods, for obvious historical reasons. As for my father, would he lay\
    \ an accusation against his only son? It was a risk I had to take.\nJust as I\
    \ was nerving myself for the odious deed, I was distracted by a mordant fancy\
    \ which had been nestling dormant in my brain until that moment. I am utterly\
    \ perplexed as to why it suddenly uncoiled itself, as it were, and sprang to the\
    \ forefront of my mind, casting out all other thoughts. It was a vision\u2014\
    so very vivid!\u2014of myself dressed in rags, exhaustedly swinging a leper bell\
    \ from my withered arm.\nWeird, that. I slapped myself on the forehead a couple\
    \ of times to dispel the hallucination, came to my senses, yanked my father's\
    \ ankle so that he fell off the barrel, pushed the barrel over and rolled it to\
    \ the kerb, and got back on the bus. The driver had finished his lunch, so, swerving\
    \ slightly to avoid my father, who was sat in the road dusting himself down, he\
    \ drove me to my stop ten minutes walk from the bird inspection unit. What I found\
    \ there was brain-dizzying.\nNOTA BENE\_: Younger readers should note that this\
    \ piece first appeared as long ago as 2004. There are two further episodes, which\
    \ will be posted in the next couple of days."
