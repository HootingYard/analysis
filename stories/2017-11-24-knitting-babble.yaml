  text: "\nYesterday's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air was briefly interrupted\
    \ by the dulcet tones of Miss Blossom Partridge with Miss Blossom Partridge's\
    \ Knitting Half-Hour, before Mr Key managed to regain control of the studio. Thereafter,\
    \ listeners\u2014deprived of tips such as keeping your knitting needles stuck\
    \ in a jar of rice*\u2014were treated to gobbets of prose about a Beatle, Cuxhaven,\
    \ another House of Turps, and part of a lecture by Little Bo Peep.\n* NOTA BENE\_\
    : Miss Blossom Partridge has asked me to confirm that this is a wholly genuine\
    \ knitting tip. I have seen the evidence with my own (admittedly myopic) eyes."
