    Yesterday''s episode of Hooting Yard On The Air was briefly interrupted by the
    dulcet tones of Miss Blossom Partridge with Miss Blossom Partridge''s Knitting
    Half-Hour, before Mr Key managed to regain control of the studio. Thereafter,
    listeners--deprived of tips such as keeping your knitting needles stuck in a jar
    of rice*--were treated to gobbets of prose about a Beatle, Cuxhaven, another House
    of Turps, and part of a lecture by Little Bo Peep.

    * NOTA BENE : Miss Blossom Partridge has asked me to confirm that this is a wholly
    genuine knitting tip. I have seen the evidence with my own (admittedly myopic)
    eyes.'
