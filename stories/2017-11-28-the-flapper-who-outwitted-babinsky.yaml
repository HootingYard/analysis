  text: '

    In her distant youth, the balletomane Nan Kew was a flapper. Not yet smitten by
    the ballet, she liked to flap about in speakeasies, getting dizzy on illicit cocktails
    and executing the latest dance crazes to the sound of boogie woogie and similar
    musical woogies, as performed by hot jazz quintets led by rascals.

    It was in one speakeasy, on 43,722nd Street, that Nan Kew encountered the lumbering
    walrus-moustached psychopathic serial killer Babinsky. In those days, of course,
    the phrase "serial killer" had not yet been coined, so Babinsky''s modus operandi
    remained sub rosa, and he did not have coppers on his trail.

    The Helsingfors poliisi may not have had their eyes on Babinsky that night but
    somebody else did. Lurking in the speakeasy subfusc was the serial killer''s long-lost
    idiot half-brother, Babinsky 2. He was watching Babinsky''s every move--and what
    moves! Babinsky was out on the dancefloor, essaying some new dance steps of his
    own invention, which he called "the lumbering psychopath". Those of you familiar
    with the dances of the era will recall it from its abbreviated name, the lumberpsych,
    which became wildly popular and spawned such hot jazz standards as Papa Done Gone
    Lopped Off My Limbs Again and Polka Dots, Hair Oil, And Brutality.

    Now it so happened that at this time, Babinsky 2 was Nan Kew''s paramour. They
    seemed an ill-matched couple, the flapper and the idiot, but there was a definite,
    if inexplicable, chemistry between them. Thus it was that Nan Kew, dizzy on illicit
    cocktails and slumped somewhat lopsidedly against Babinsky 2 in their booth in
    the speakeasy gloom, knew without asking why her darling was transfixed by the
    lumbering brute on the dancefloor. Babinsky 2 longed for a reconciliation with
    his long-lost brother, from whom he had been parted ever since that catastrophic
    picnic on the edge of the forest at the end of the war. Or had it been at the
    beginning of the war? So fuddled was his brain that Babinsky 2 could no longer
    remember. All he knew was that he had a burning desire to climb trees and play
    pin-the-antennae-on-the-locust again with his brother, to relive their carefree
    childhood in the shadow of the Big Formidable Mountains.

    But idiot that he was, even Babinsky 2 knew that his half-brother, being a psychopath,
    wanted nothing more than to drive an axe into his, Babinsky 2''s, skull, and then
    chop off his head and boil it in one of his horrible grease-encrusted vats in
    his horrible grease-encrusted cellar beneath his horrible grease-encrusted chalet.
    And so all he could do was sit in the darkened booth, gazing at Babinsky with
    love and longing and terror.

    Then dizzy Nan Kew had an idea.

    "I am sure he won''t recognise you if you don a disguise," she slurred in her
    woozy way, "We could get you up as a Levantine toothbrush salesman, or a crippled
    Dutch ski-lift operative, and Babinsky will never guess your true identity. Then,
    if we persuade him there is a cuddly little hamster or guinea pig trapped at the
    top of that sycamore tree in the street outside the speakeasy, the two of you
    can climb it together, just as if you were carefree tots before that picnic. Meanwhile,
    I will gather pencil and paper and a pin and a blindfold, and when you come back
    in you can play that foolish game you were both so fond of."

    "What a fantastic idea!" shouted Babinsky 2, planting a kiss on Nan Kew''s flushed
    cheek.

    "You will just have to convince your half-brother that the hamster or guinea pig
    atop the tree is an invisible one," added the flapper, "But that should not prove
    difficult. Just tell him there has been a plague of invisible small cuddly mammals
    in Helsingfors and you will show him the press clippings tomorrow. That will give
    me more than enough time to make some counterfeits on a Gestetner machine."

    Dizzy as she was, Nan Kew was already displaying the resourcefulness which later
    stood her in such good stead as a balletomane. (See her Memoirs for detailed clarification.)

    That night, everything went according to plan. The flapper and the idiot managed
    to pull the wool over Babinsky''s eyes. The next day, however, it all went wrong.
    The Gestetner machine was jammed. Mice nibbled at Babinsky 2''s disguise. There
    was a teeming downpour and thick fog. War broke out following skirmishes on the
    border at daybreak.

    When they went to meet Babinsky at midday on Sawdust Bridge as arranged, the serial
    killer was armed with his axe and his hatchet and his slicer and god knows what
    other fearsome sharp implements. Above his walrus moustache, his eyes burned with
    psychopathic psychopathology. Babinsky 2 and Nan Kew turned tail and fled through
    the narrow Helsingfors streets.

    It would be forty years before the half-brothers met again. During all that time,
    Babinsky 2 treasured his memories of that one evening. For a cherished hour, Babinsky
    and Babinsky 2 had relived the idyll of their pre-picnic childhood, all thanks
    to the quick wits of future balletomane Nan Kew!
