  text: "\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that a devotee of Hooting Yard is\
    \ equally a fan of \u201960s beat combo Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, known\
    \ to Bernard Levin as The Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich. That being so, readers\
    \ will be palpitating with overexcitement at the news that\u2014at long last!\u2014\
    a tribute band has been formed to recreate, as closely as possible, the authentic\
    \ sound of Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich-style poptasticness.\nBut this is\
    \ no mere tribute band. It is a supergroup, and a multi-disciplinary one at that,\
    \ drawing in not just musicians but sports stars, politicians, and statesmen from\
    \ around the world. Thus we have the Ivory Coast footballer Yaya Tour\xE9; the\
    \ avant garde octogenarian and widow of (in the immortal words of Kenneth Williams)\
    \ \u201Cthat Beatle who married an Asiatic woman\u201D, Yoko Ono; the Paris-born\
    \ American cellist Yo-Yo Ma; and the Israeli politicians Tzipi Livni and Binyamin\
    \ Netanyahu, known affectionately as \u201CBibi\u201D.\nThe group\u2014Yaya, Yoko,\
    \ Yo-Yo, Tzipi & Bibi\u2014are not yet on tour, nor in the recording studio. In\
    \ fact they have not yet met up with each other to rehearse such timeless classic\
    \ hits as \u201CMargareta Lidman\u201D, \u201CHe's A Raver,\u201D and \u201CThe\
    \ Wreck Of The \u2018Antoinette\u2019\u201D. It is my fond hope that, reading\
    \ this press release, each of the five will realise the urgency of making this\
    \ happen. The future of pop music is in their hands.\nADDENDUM\_: Dave Dee and\
    \ his pals graced these pages back in October 2010, when they encountered a bricklaying\
    \ witch."
