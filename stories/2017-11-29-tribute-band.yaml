    It is a truth universally acknowledged that a devotee of Hooting Yard is equally
    a fan of ''60s beat combo Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, known to Bernard
    Levin as The Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich. That being so, readers will be
    palpitating with overexcitement at the news that--at long last!--a tribute band
    has been formed to recreate, as closely as possible, the authentic sound of Dave
    Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich-style poptasticness.

    But this is no mere tribute band. It is a supergroup, and a multi-disciplinary
    one at that, drawing in not just musicians but sports stars, politicians, and
    statesmen from around the world. Thus we have the Ivory Coast footballer Yaya
    Toure; the avant garde octogenarian and widow of (in the immortal words of Kenneth
    Williams) "that Beatle who married an Asiatic woman", Yoko Ono; the Paris-born
    American cellist Yo-Yo Ma; and the Israeli politicians Tzipi Livni and Binyamin
    Netanyahu, known affectionately as "Bibi".

    The group--Yaya, Yoko, Yo-Yo, Tzipi & Bibi--are not yet on tour, nor in the recording
    studio. In fact they have not yet met up with each other to rehearse such timeless
    classic hits as "Margareta Lidman", "He''s A Raver," and "The Wreck Of The ''Antoinette''".
    It is my fond hope that, reading this press release, each of the five will realise
    the urgency of making this happen. The future of pop music is in their hands.

    ADDENDUM : Dave Dee and his pals graced these pages back in October 2010, when
    they encountered a bricklaying witch.'
