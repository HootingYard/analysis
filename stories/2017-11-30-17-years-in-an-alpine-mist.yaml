  text: "\nOne of the more curious episodes in the life of the out of print pamphleteer\
    \ Dobson is recounted in his autobiographical pamphlet 17 Years In An Alpine Mist\
    \ (out of print). It begins as follows:\nOne day in the 1950s I was hiking in\
    \ the Alps, researching all things goaty for a pamphlet I planned to write, provisionally\
    \ entitled All Things Goaty In The Alps. All of a sudden I found myself engulfed\
    \ in an Alpine mist. It was thick and swirling, the sort of mist one might find\
    \ enswathing the three witches in a production of Macbeth, or in a film by Guy\
    \ Maddin. Unable to see ahead of me, I blundered about, hopelessly lost.\nI had\
    \ my Alpenstock, and a flask of vitamin-enhanced boiled buttercup \u2018n\u2019\
    \ watercress water. Treading carefully, I tried to make my way down from the mountains.\
    \ But no matter which way I turned, I seemed always to be going uphill, up, up,\
    \ and up. The mist grew thicker and swirlier.\nIn prose that grows increasingly\
    \ hysterical, even hallucinatory, the pamphleteer reports that several hours pass,\
    \ with him plodding ever higher into the Alps. He can barely see more than an\
    \ inch or two in front of him, so dense is the Alpine mist. Eventually, he comes\
    \ to a halt when his path is blocked by a doorway.\nThe door was wooden, mahogany\
    \ by the looks of it, and set within a base and brickish wall. I could see very\
    \ little of the latter, in the thick and swirling Alpine mist, so I had no idea\
    \ how high it was, nor how far it extended on either side. Nonetheless, I gained\
    \ the distinct impression that I was standing outside a sort of half-size replica\
    \ of the Winnipeg evaporated milk factory where, long long ago, I had worked as\
    \ a junior janitor. This was most perplexing.\nDobson takes a glug from his flask,\
    \ and then thumps his Alpenstock on the door, thrice. As if in a scene from a\
    \ Hammer horror film, the door slowly opens, with an eerie and ominous creak.\
    \ The pamphleteer steps inside, and is disconcerted to note that the mist is even\
    \ thicker, though a bit less swirly. The door, of course, swings shut behind him,\
    \ as in one of those films.\nMy bafflement that the indoor mist was even more\
    \ engulfing than the mist outside was leavened somewhat by the fact that, after\
    \ hours toiling uphill, the stone floor beneath my feet was level. But I was still\
    \ lost, in silence and invisibility. And then, ahead of me, I saw emerging from\
    \ the mist, a human, or semihuman, or inhuman figure. Though it was blurry and\
    \ weirdly shimmering, I sensed that it was ancient, aeons-old, older perhaps than\
    \ time itself. I did not yet realise that I had come face to face with a Blavatskyite\
    \ Being Of Unutterable Esoteric Wisdom.\nThe mysterious figure beckons Dobson\
    \ to follow him\u2014her? it?\u2014and leads the pamphleteer to a room within\
    \ a room within a room within a room within a room within a room, an inner inner\
    \ inner et cetera sanctum, still enshrouded in thick Alpine mist. In the centre\
    \ of the room stands a stone slab, an altar, upon which are carved inscriptions\
    \ in several different unknown alphabets. Otherwise, the room is bare, save for\
    \ an escritoire, an armoire, an arras, a sideboard on which stands a cassette\
    \ player and a pile of cassette tapes, a much-becushioned sofa bed, a pair of\
    \ matching musnuds, a two-bar electric fire, a treadmill, a Toc H lamp, a Bakelite\
    \ figurine of Charles W. Leadbeater, a second stone slab altar without inscriptions,\
    \ an empotted pugton tree, several vases and basins, a jelly-making kit, a mysterious\
    \ blue carton, a chemical toilet, a grandfather clock, a drumkit, an easel, a\
    \ taxidermised weasel, a waste paper bin, an espresso machine, a doormat, a rug,\
    \ a cat-litter tray, and a few other bittybobs. In one corner there is a mop and\
    \ a pail.\nThis was to be my home for the next seventeen years. In all that time,\
    \ the Alpine mist never dispersed. It remained thick, and occasionally quite swirlyish.\
    \ So, when I sat in one of the musnuds, I could not see the other one, nor any\
    \ of the other appurtenances. Moving about my sanctum, I kept bumping into things.\
    \ My shins were a mass of bruises.\nI learned to operate the cassette player,\
    \ and grew fond of the music recorded on the tapes. Each of them contained ninety\
    \ minutes of skiffle, performed by Emile \u2018Stalebread\u2019 Lacoume & His\
    \ Razzy Dazzy Spasm Band. I also learned to make jelly.\nOnce a week, I received\
    \ a visit from the Blavatskyite Being. It explained that it was going to initiate\
    \ me into the secrets of the cosmos. To do so, it would read a few paragraphs\
    \ from The Collected Witterings of Madame Blavatsky, and then quiz me on what\
    \ I had heard. The questions were put in multiple-choice format, which I found\
    \ helpful. It had a curious speaking voice, sometimes sounding exactly like the\
    \ star of stage and screen Jack Hulbert, and at other times like his wife and\
    \ musical comedy partner Cicely Courtneidge. It might yoyo between the two voices\
    \ within a single sentence.\nEvery year, on St Bibblybibdib's Day, it took me\
    \ to its own domain, even higher in the Alps. Up there, the air was so thin it\
    \ could not form a mist, and we had to wear oxygen masks to breathe. All day long\
    \ we played ping pong on its full-size ping pong table. Oddly, every single game\
    \ we played over those seventeen years ended in a draw, which is technically impossible\
    \ when playing ping pong in the mortal world. I hoped one day to find an explanation\
    \ for this in one of the Madame Blavatsky readings, but it remained a mystery.\
    \ As did the blue carton in my sanctum, which I was forbidden to open.\nDobson\
    \ notes that he marked the passage of time, at first by cutting notches in his\
    \ Alpenstock and later by ticking off the days in an Esoteric Reader's Digest\
    \ 17-Year Pocket Diary which he found in the sideboard. Then, one Thursday, the\
    \ Blavatskyite Being makes an unscheduled appearance. The mist is thicker and\
    \ swirlier than usual. The pamphleteer is told that he has learned all there is\
    \ to know, plus a bit more, and is now an Adept Of The Secret Order Of Alpine\
    \ Blavatskyite Beings (Cadet Class). It is time for him to leave, and to return\
    \ to the mundane world of mortal men. He is bundled out of his inner inner inner\
    \ etcetera sanctum none too gently, and given a shove, and skitters down the mountain,\
    \ through the mist, down and down, until of a sudden the mist clears, and he can\
    \ see clearly, and to his astonishment, there, sitting on an Alpine municipal\
    \ bench at the foot of the mountain, waiting for him, is his inamorata and poppet,\
    \ Marigold Chew.\n\u201CMarigold my dearest darling dear!\u201D I cried, \u201C\
    I have returned! I am agog to know what has been going on in the world these past\
    \ seventeen years. Did the Vietnam War escalate after the Battle of \u0110i\u1EC7\
    n Bi\xEAn Ph\u1EE7? Did the Busby Babes win the European Cup? Was it ever proven\
    \ that Alger Hiss was indeed a Communist spy? Did Emile \u2018Stalebread\u2019\
    \ Lacoume & His Razzy Dazzy Spasm Band top the hit parade? Uncle Joe Stalin\u2014\
    does he yet live? Are Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge still high-earning stars\
    \ in the musical comedy firmament? Has Vice President Nixon published his book\
    \ Six Crises? I have a million questions to which answers are not vouchsafed even\
    \ by the secret knowledge I have acquired high, high in the Alpine mist!\u201D\
    \nMarigold Chew looks at Dobson as if he has gone mad.\n\u201CWhat on earth are\
    \ you blathering on about, Dobson?\u201D she says, \u201CYou vanished into the\
    \ mist saying you were going to research all things goaty, and here you are back\
    \ again, ten minutes later. You can't have learned much about Alpine goats in\
    \ that time. And what is that lump on your head? It looks very much as if you\
    \ have been struck on the bonce by a very large pebble hurled by a mischievous\
    \ and miscreant young Alpine goatherd boy from the nearby orphanage. We must make\
    \ a complaint to the beadle to ensure the ne'er-do-well mite is given no jelly\
    \ for his pudding tonight.\u201D\nAnd with that, Marigold Chew takes Dobson by\
    \ the arm, and they walk away from the Alps, never to return in this lifetime.\n\
    NOTA BENE\_: Thanks to my old mucker Max D\xE9charn\xE9 for alerting me to the\
    \ existence of Emile \u2018Stalebread\u2019 Lacoume & His Razzy Dazzy Spasm Band,\
    \ here.\nANOTHER NOTA BENE\_: Max has kindly provided a snap of the Razzy Dazzy\
    \ Spasm Band, taken in 1896 or 1897. As he says, they were proper New Orleans\
    \ street urchins.\n"
