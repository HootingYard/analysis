    Hot off the possibly magnetic etherwaves, in today''s episode of Hooting Yard
    On The Air, Mr Key turns his attention to Little Bo Peep, hendiadys in Mudchute,
    a spot of juvenilia, an account of the day he forgot his own head, and the ghost
    of Doris Stockhausen. With luck, Miss Blossom Partridge''s Knitting Half-Hour
    will be back next week.'
