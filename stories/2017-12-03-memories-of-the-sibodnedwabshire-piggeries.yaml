  text: 'Those who grew up in Sibodnedwabshire are forever haunted by memories of
    its piggeries, in the shadow of those Blue Forgotten Hills. The hills may be--oh
    mercifully!--forgotten, but the piggeries are not. Consider the song, still sung,
    or croaked, by aged decrepit Sibodnedwabshireites in the cobwebbed rumpus rooms
    of their hospices:

    The hopes and fears of all the years

    The cutman with his rusty shears

    The orphans wet behind the ears

    Oh swine of Sibodnedwabshire

    It is not a pretty song.

    There were a dozen piggeries in all, each penning dozens of pigs, except for the
    one that was empty of pigs, the one everybody remembers with a shudder, its piglessness
    both eerie and ridiculous. There was mud there, of course, mud aplenty, but not
    a single pig to wallow in it. The only things living in that mud were worms, tiny
    wriggling albino worms, worms from a child''s nightmare.

    Wormy nightmares, but piggy dreams. So many dreamers dreaming of those remembered
    pigs in the piggeries that there is now a clinical term--PTSD, or Pig-Themed Sibodnedwabshire
    Dreaming. In their dotage now, those who were long long ago the tots of Sibodnedwabshire
    have their hospice pillows embroidered with pig motifs, the better to prompt their
    dreams.

    What of the cutman, with his rusty shears? He would fly in, over the Blue Forgotten
    Hills, every Sunday, in his biplane, and come into land at the aerodrome. Accompanied
    by the Shire Stymonsieur, he would tour the twelve piggeries, yes, even that eerie
    and ridiculous pigless piggery, bandying his shears, encrusted with rust, and
    singing his song.

    I am the cutman, come to the shire

    My heart as hot as an Elmo fire

    Turning and turning in the widening gyre

    Oh swine of Sibodnedwabshire

    It was not a pretty song.'
