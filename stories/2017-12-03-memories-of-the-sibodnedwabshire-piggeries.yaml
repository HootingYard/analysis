  text: "Those who grew up in Sibodnedwabshire are forever haunted by memories of\
    \ its piggeries, in the shadow of those Blue Forgotten Hills. The hills may be\u2014\
    oh mercifully!\u2014forgotten, but the piggeries are not. Consider the song, still\
    \ sung, or croaked, by aged decrepit Sibodnedwabshireites in the cobwebbed rumpus\
    \ rooms of their hospices:\nThe hopes and fears of all the years\nThe cutman with\
    \ his rusty shears\nThe orphans wet behind the ears\nOh swine of Sibodnedwabshire\n\
    It is not a pretty song.\nThere were a dozen piggeries in all, each penning dozens\
    \ of pigs, except for the one that was empty of pigs, the one everybody remembers\
    \ with a shudder, its piglessness both eerie and ridiculous. There was mud there,\
    \ of course, mud aplenty, but not a single pig to wallow in it. The only things\
    \ living in that mud were worms, tiny wriggling albino worms, worms from a child's\
    \ nightmare.\nWormy nightmares, but piggy dreams. So many dreamers dreaming of\
    \ those remembered pigs in the piggeries that there is now a clinical term\u2014\
    PTSD, or Pig-Themed Sibodnedwabshire Dreaming. In their dotage now, those who\
    \ were long long ago the tots of Sibodnedwabshire have their hospice pillows embroidered\
    \ with pig motifs, the better to prompt their dreams.\nWhat of the cutman, with\
    \ his rusty shears? He would fly in, over the Blue Forgotten Hills, every Sunday,\
    \ in his biplane, and come into land at the aerodrome. Accompanied by the Shire\
    \ Stymonsieur, he would tour the twelve piggeries, yes, even that eerie and ridiculous\
    \ pigless piggery, bandying his shears, encrusted with rust, and singing his song.\n\
    I am the cutman, come to the shire\nMy heart as hot as an Elmo fire\nTurning and\
    \ turning in the widening gyre\nOh swine of Sibodnedwabshire\nIt was not a pretty\
    \ song."
