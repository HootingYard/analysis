    ''Twas brillig, again, but the slithy toves were nowhere to be seen. And that
    wasn''t all. The borogoves were anything but mimsy, and the mome raths ingrabe.
    It was the most baffling case yet to have landed on the desk of Detective Captain
    Cargpan at the Pointy Town Police Station & Ice Rink.

    Cargpan headed immediately to St Bibblybibdib''s church for Mass. He was a Roman
    Catholic so devout that he bore the stigmata, though in his case the marks were
    made by human rather than divine agency. He had had them tattooed on to his hands
    and feet and side. The tattooist, more accustomed to ornamenting the flesh of
    hairy leather-clad rock fans, had executed Christ''s wounds in the form of heavy
    metal umlauts. As a result, it looked as if Cargpan was displaying double stigmata,
    with the inference that he had suffered more than Christ. When accused of such
    blasphemy, the world-weary detective would reply "Perhaps I have, perhaps I have".

    After Mass, he went to confession. The priest, Father Tonguelash, was a keen student
    of the human heart, and Cargpan often relied on his insight.

    "I am sore perplexed by this brillig case, Father," he moaned.

    "Moan not, my child," said the priest, "For was it not the lately deceased psychopathic
    philosopher Manson who said ''No sense makes sense''?"

    Armed with this intelligence, and twenty Hail Marys later, Cargpan returned to
    his desk at the Pointy Town Police Station & Ice Rink. He immediately set about
    creating a filing system, of small rectangular pieces of cardboard shoved, alphabetically
    into a lockable metal cabinet. This was to be the artificial "brain" of the brillig
    case.

    In the days following, Cargpan went to Mass several more times, smoked hundreds
    of cigarettes, and sat in his parked car next to the reservoir, gazing for hours
    and hours at herons and egrets and grebes and little grebes and a Jubjub. He turned
    over and over in his mind, in uffish thought, the words spoken by Father Tonguelash.

    Somehow he knew that, as in a Scandinavian television series, the case would end
    with him apprehending a supremely clever and well-resourced serial killer, whose
    base of operations would be an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, within
    which was a panoply of fearsomely complicated equipment and a fiendish plan laid
    out, photographs and diagrams and documents pinned up and spread over an entire
    wall, rather than kept neatly in a ring binder.

    But before he could make the arrest, Cargpan had to identify the malefactor. Who
    was his manxsome foe? He sat by the reservoir as darkness fell.

    And then, several impossibly blood-soaked murders later, on a frabjous day, the
    perp came whiffling and burbling through the tulgey wood. Cargpan was there to
    nab him. It was his Father Confessor, Ninian Tonguelash SJ!

    In the next season of Cargpan, Detective Captain Cargpan is on the case of the
    so-called "Snark", a serial killer who also turns out to be a (spoiler alert)
    Jesuit priest!'
