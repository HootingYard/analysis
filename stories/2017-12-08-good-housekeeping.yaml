  text: "I am attempting to do a spot of Hooting Yard housekeeping, delving into the\
    \ terrifying innards of WordPress to tweak this website here & there. Frankly,\
    \ I find my brain befuddled, but progress is being made, albeit slowly.\nThus\
    \ far, I have managed to make a couple of updates to the sidebar. A while ago,\
    \ ResonanceFM discontinued its podcasts and, as far as I know, erased them from\
    \ history. I haven't worked out how to remove the podcasty links over to your\
    \ right, but I have inserted a link to the Hooting Yard audio archive on Mixcloud.\
    \ Shows are available there almost as soon as they have been broadcast.\nI recently\
    \ trod in the puddle of Instagram, and have added a sidebar link so you lot can\
    \ go and look at pictures posted by out_of_print_pamphleteer.\nI shall keep you\
    \ informed of further refinements if my brain doers not overheat in the meantime.\n\
    UPDATE\_: I've also inserted a sidebar Archives section, where you can browse\
    \ through the morass of potsages [sic] month by month.\nFURTHER UPDATE\_: Those\
    \ podcast links have now been excised. See the Comments, however, for Old Resonance\
    \ Hooting Yard Podcasts News, and watch this space \u2026"
