  text: 'I am attempting to do a spot of Hooting Yard housekeeping, delving into the
    terrifying innards of WordPress to tweak this website here & there. Frankly, I
    find my brain befuddled, but progress is being made, albeit slowly.

    Thus far, I have managed to make a couple of updates to the sidebar. A while ago,
    ResonanceFM discontinued its podcasts and, as far as I know, erased them from
    history. I haven''t worked out how to remove the podcasty links over to your right,
    but I have inserted a link to the Hooting Yard audio archive on Mixcloud. Shows
    are available there almost as soon as they have been broadcast.

    I recently trod in the puddle of Instagram, and have added a sidebar link so you
    lot can go and look at pictures posted by out_of_print_pamphleteer.

    I shall keep you informed of further refinements if my brain doers not overheat
    in the meantime.

    UPDATE : I''ve also inserted a sidebar Archives section, where you can browse
    through the morass of potsages [sic] month by month.

    FURTHER UPDATE : Those podcast links have now been excised. See the Comments,
    however, for Old Resonance Hooting Yard Podcasts News, and watch this space ...'
