  text: "\u2018Twas brillig, and I babbled guff\nUntil my listeners cried \u201CEnough!\u201D\
    \nAnd stopped my gob with a plug of dough\nAnd then it was that I knew woe.\n\
    A woe such as I'd never known\nNot e'en when I was skin and bone\nIn starveling\
    \ days of pimply youth\nBefore I grew so fat forsooth.\nFat and loud and babbling\
    \ guff,\nAll roister doister swagger and puff,\nPuffed up like one of those eerie\
    \ toads\nThat leap at you from beside the roads.\nWell, at least, they leap at\
    \ moi.\nI wrote of them in my memoir,\nThe text of which is what I brayed\nHoping\
    \ to make my listeners afraid.\nInstead they plugged my gob with dough\nAnd brought\
    \ me down so very low\nThat now my life is full of woe\nAnd it is time for me\
    \ to go.\nGo where? To the seaside I suppose\nTo my seaside chalet o\u2019 prose\n\
    To thump my typewriter's leaden keys\nAnd write of hornets, wasps, and bees."
