  text: '''Twas brillig, and I babbled guff

    Until my listeners cried "Enough!"

    And stopped my gob with a plug of dough

    And then it was that I knew woe.

    A woe such as I''d never known

    Not e''en when I was skin and bone

    In starveling days of pimply youth

    Before I grew so fat forsooth.

    Fat and loud and babbling guff,

    All roister doister swagger and puff,

    Puffed up like one of those eerie toads

    That leap at you from beside the roads.

    Well, at least, they leap at moi.

    I wrote of them in my memoir,

    The text of which is what I brayed

    Hoping to make my listeners afraid.

    Instead they plugged my gob with dough

    And brought me down so very low

    That now my life is full of woe

    And it is time for me to go.

    Go where? To the seaside I suppose

    To my seaside chalet o'' prose

    To thump my typewriter''s leaden keys

    And write of hornets, wasps, and bees.'
