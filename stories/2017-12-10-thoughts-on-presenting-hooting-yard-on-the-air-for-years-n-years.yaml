  text: "'Twas brillig, and I babbled guff\n    Until my listeners cried \"Enough!\"\
    \n    And stopped my gob with a plug of dough\n    And then it was that I knew\
    \ woe.\nA woe such as I'd never known\n    Not e'en when I was skin and bone\n\
    \    In starveling days of pimply youth\n    Before I grew so fat forsooth.\n\
    Fat and loud and babbling guff,\n    All roister doister swagger and puff,\n \
    \   Puffed up like one of those eerie toads\n    That leap at you from beside\
    \ the roads.\nWell, at least, they leap at moi.\n    I wrote of them in my memoir,\n\
    \    The text of which is what I brayed\n    Hoping to make my listeners afraid.\n\
    Instead they plugged my gob with dough\n    And brought me down so very low\n\
    \    That now my life is full of woe\n    And it is time for me to go.\nGo where?\
    \ To the seaside I suppose\n    To my seaside chalet o' prose\n    To thump my\
    \ typewriter's leaden keys\n    And write of hornets, wasps, and bees."
