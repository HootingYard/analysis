  text: 'The Emblems of Inanity are vivid, blindingly so. Gold leaf is used sparingly.
    Most, but not all, are the work of Ferdinandodooda Gulbenkian Mukherjee, of whom
    little is known, and that little, spurious. Bird motifs are used sparingly, but
    not as sparingly as gold leaf. Tremendous splattering is de rigueur. The viewer''s
    headaches thump and throb.

    Mukherjee''s own headaches are one of the few non-spurious things we know of him.
    There are documents. The gulf between head and ache was sometimes as wide as one
    of those big expansive seas one finds in the wet parts of the earth. Dust covered
    some, but not all, of the emblems. One thinks of a jester''s cap and bells.

    Hanging where they do, or tacked up with metal tacks, the emblems gain moral heft.
    Several ditches were emptied of mud. That crocus-scented one has particular significance,
    though it is one of the emblems Mukherjee denied moulding. It lacks gold leaf,
    a bird motif, even dust. Always wiped with the same rag.

    Frostbitten, the maker or moulder or what you will was bitten by more than frost.
    One need only examine the pins under a microscope. The apron was baize and bore
    tremendous splatterings. Its strings may have been those of Mukherjee''s dead
    mother, bobbed hair preserved in a jar on a shelf, an unsettling memento.

    When horsemen came roaring across the plains, these emblems were their purchase.
    Rough, dun, spelt, and plenty of hammers to pound. We can discern in certain emblems
    pocks. The juddering of a type of vibrational praxis or bedevilment. This is what
    Cugat was referring to in the lectures now lost. Swollen blobs of poor ink.

    Lupine howling, or awe, as a response, preclude proper digestion. Mukherjee had
    a special basin for Christ''s sake. Content and context fly at each other, fangs
    bared. One thinks of the barbarian horsemen. In only one case is the bird motif
    done in gold leaf. A pretty little chaffinch, a worm dangling from its beak, its
    beak golden, the worm a pink that nauseates.

    Sometimes lamps dazzle rather than illuminate. The viewers'' eyes scrunch and
    the headaches return. The gulf widens. That sea is wetter than ever. Shoes that
    had been laced with boggling expertise tread on golden slabs. The cumulative effect
    is sub rosa, and not just rosa. The deeper the delving, the shabbiness baffles.
    A torch might be an improvement on the lamp.

    What Mukherjee saw was arguably not without airlessness. He may have grown to
    manhood in an iron lung. There are more documents. Beneath the innocent streets
    run mile upon mile of tunnels, forlorn and unmapped. Mukherjee''s longings ought
    not detain the more sombre student of his work, cut to the quick. He had a pet
    mole.

    Pound writes somewhere of Swartest night stretched over wretched men there and
    it is the "there" that these emblems, at both their best and worst, and middling
    too, inhabit. More are frankly middling than otherwise. None is swart, unless
    at a stretch. Fixed to a torturer''s rack, with metal tacks, they could be stretched,
    if one insisted upon it. Mukherjee did not.

    There are times when oars groan in the water, like living things. Suffering is
    a given. It may be that the nauseating pink worm gnaws at the emblems'' core.
    Hunter and hunted, in sun or snow. There is a pallid cast to those who shuffle
    in circles in the prison gang. Look carefully at the more vivid of the emblems
    and blindness wears a trickster''s hat.

    In the end, inanity brooks no lop.'
