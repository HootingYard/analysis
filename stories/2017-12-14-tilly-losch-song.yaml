    I had a cuppa with Tilly Losch

    Just tea, the caff was out of nosh

    It cost an awful lot of dosh

    Then we went to a pit to mosh

    Oh Tilly! Such a smashing gal

    Nowadays she''s my penpal

    We swap letters ''cross oceans wide

    Oh Tilly! Tilly will abide

    Abide with me

    Abide with Ned

    Young Edward James

    Shared Tilly''s bed

    Soon enough the pair did part

    Ned collected surrealist art

    Some influenced by old H. Bosch

    But he never forgot Tilly--Tilly Losch!'
