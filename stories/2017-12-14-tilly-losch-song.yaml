  text: "\nI had a cuppa with Tilly Losch\n    Just tea, the caff was out of nosh\n\
    \    It cost an awful lot of dosh\n    Then we went to a pit to mosh\nOh Tilly!\
    \ Such a smashing gal\n    Nowadays she's my penpal\n    We swap letters 'cross\
    \ oceans wide\n    Oh Tilly! Tilly will abide\nAbide with me\n    Abide with Ned\n\
    \    Young Edward James\n      Shared Tilly's bed\nSoon enough the pair did part\n\
    \    Ned collected surrealist art\n    Some influenced by old H. Bosch\n    But\
    \ he never forgot Tilly--Tilly Losch!"
