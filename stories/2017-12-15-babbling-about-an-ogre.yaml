    Yesterday''s episode of Hooting Yard On The Air was the final show for the Year
    of Our Lord MMXVII. As a special treat for listeners'' ears, it included a rather
    marvellous rendition of The Cuthbert Spraingue Song, for which Mr Key was joined
    by the dulcet tones of Pansy Cradledew. Thereafter, there was a lot of babble
    about an ogre, and Dobson, both on an atoll and in a pickle. Plus an end note
    on Italian fascist Benito Mussolini.

    Meanwhile, don''t forget that ancient episodes of the show are being regularly
    added to an archive on YouTube.'
