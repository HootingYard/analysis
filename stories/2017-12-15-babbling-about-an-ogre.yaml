  text: "\nYesterday's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air was the final show for the\
    \ Year of Our Lord MMXVII. As a special treat for listeners\u2019 ears, it included\
    \ a rather marvellous rendition of The Cuthbert Spraingue Song, for which Mr Key\
    \ was joined by the dulcet tones of Pansy Cradledew. Thereafter, there was a lot\
    \ of babble about an ogre, and Dobson, both on an atoll and in a pickle. Plus\
    \ an end note on Italian fascist Benito Mussolini.\nMeanwhile, don't forget that\
    \ ancient episodes of the show are being regularly added to an archive on YouTube."
