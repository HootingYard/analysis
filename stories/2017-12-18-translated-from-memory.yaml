text: 'An old Latvian folk song, translated from memory. To be sung when gathered
  round a blazing hearth on a bitter winter''s night.

  There is a shepherd in the hills

  There is a [something] green

  But black is the crow in the [something] tree

  And forked lightning blasts the sky

  The shepherd''s lass has golden hair

  She [something something] milk

  But the crow has flown away, my love

  And the ducks have left the lake'
