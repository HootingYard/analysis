  text: 'An old Latvian folk song, translated from memory. To be sung when gathered
    round a blazing hearth on a bitter winter''s night.

    There is a shepherd in the hills

    There is a [something] green

    But black is the crow in the [something] tree

    And forked lightning blasts the sky

    The shepherd''s lass has golden hair

    She [something something] milk

    But the crow has flown away, my love

    And the ducks have left the lake'
