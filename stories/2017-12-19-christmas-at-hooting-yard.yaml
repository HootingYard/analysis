  text: "Tomorrow at the crack of dawn I shall be heading off to a foreign land, where\
    \ I shall prance about like a fool until New Year's Eve Eve. But fear not! You\
    \ lot will not be left bereft and weeping, tormented by a Hooting Yard-shaped\
    \ hole in your souls. Through the [something or other] of technology, daily potsages\
    \ [sic] will be appearing here, even as your favourite impecunious scribbler is\
    \ thousands of miles away from his escritoire.\nNot only will our Advent Calendar\
    \ continue to tock towards Christmas every morning, but from Thursday until 30\
    \ December you will be treated to Ten Tarleton Tales, one for each day. These\
    \ are reposts rather than new stories, but they take on a fresh\u2014and possibly\
    \ alarming\u2014significance when bundled together as a sort of box set.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ nearly all surviving episodes of Hooting Yard On The Air from 2004 are now available\
    \ on YouTube, or you can go to Mixcloud for an archive of more recent shows.\n\
    Taken together, all of that should keep you lot occupied until I return. And though\
    \ all of this bounty is offered freely, it might well be that you feel compelled\
    \ to offer up a prayer of gratitude, invoking the twisted spine of St Spivack,\
    \ and chucking oodles of cash into Mr Key's Paypal coffers.\nA very happy Christmas\
    \ to you all, and may the Lord have mercy on your souls."
