  text: It is ten long years since ResonanceFM broadcast the historic reading of Christopher
    Smart's magnificent Jubilate Agno. To mark the occasion, I am delighted to announce
    that the station will be repeating the programme--all three hours of it--on Boxing
    Day at 2.00 PM. Sluice out the valves on your wireless, tune in, and listen to
    Mr Key & Germander Speedwell read this utterly mesmerising poem.
