  text: 'Tarleton, the amateur''s amateur, was sat one evening in an armchair in his
    consulting rooms, constructing a working scale model of a hydroelectric power
    station out of matchsticks and cardboard and glue and fusewire and hydroelectric
    power, when there came a sudden urgent knocking, the door crashed open, and into
    the room came a man holding, at arm''s length, an asp.

    "Are you Tarleton?" gasped the man. It was his last gasp, for as soon as the words
    were out of his mouth he collapsed upon the carpet. In death, his grip on the
    asp was necessarily relaxed, but the manner in which he fell meant that the asp
    was trapped under the weight of his corpse. Its head, however, poked free, and
    it hissed in an aspy way at Tarleton.

    This, then, was the famous mystery of the asp, some say Tarleton''s finest hour.
    The mystery may be thought to have inhered in the identity of the man who had
    come carrying an asp into the consulting-rooms, his purpose in bringing the asp,
    and indeed in the provenance of the asp. There were certain other matters, too,
    to which Tarleton needed to turn the cranks of his powerful mind, but those mentioned
    are considered the main three. We might mention here that the dead man had a pudding-basin
    haircut.

    Before solving the mystery, Tarleton determined to put the finishing touches to
    his model. He was unruffled by the hissing of the asp, for he had, years before,
    gained mastery of a mystic oriental technique for remaining unruffled in the presence
    of hissing asps, and indeed of other things that hiss. One inadvertent consequence
    of his mastery was that, on the one occasion Tarleton met Alger Hiss, the communist
    spy, he remained utterly unruffled, when a certain rufflement might have spurred
    him to action, and he could have taken steps to gather evidence of Hiss''s perfidy,
    and thus saved Whittaker Chambers a great deal of pother. Chambers, with his rotten
    infected teeth and shabby stained suit, never forgave Tarleton for his languid
    lack of concern, and sent the amateur''s amateur several poison pen letters in
    succeeding years. These have now been collected in The Correspondence Of Whittaker
    Chambers And Tarleton, The Amateur''s Amateur, a somewhat misleading title in
    that the word ''correspondence'' suggests that Tarleton replied, which he did
    not. He could not bestir himself to do so, preferring to muck about with matchsticks
    and cardboard and glue and fusewire and hydroelectric power. Having made one working
    scale model of a hydroelectric power station, putting the finishing touches to
    it under the watchful eyes of a hissing asp, Tarleton was so delighted with it
    that he immediately set about making another. It was a hobby that kept him profitably
    occupied for a number of years.

    Obviously, he had to take a break from his model-making from time to time, for
    example to sleep, to eat, to go for long hikes, to solve cases that perplexed
    the best minds of the police force, and not least, to do something about the asp.
    But before he could address the matter of the asp, Tarleton had to arrange for
    the disposal of the corpse of the man who had burst into his consulting rooms
    carrying the asp at arm''s length. He placed a call to the local rascally illegal
    disposer of corpses. One might ask why he did not seek to have the corpse disposed
    of in a manner commensurate with the law. One might ask, but to no avail, for
    Tarleton was notoriously tight-lipped about such things. Let us say it was not
    the first time he had had a corpse disposed of illegally, nor the first time said
    corpse had a pudding-basin haircut. It was, however, the first time the removal
    of the corpse from his consulting rooms would release, from under its dead weight,
    a hissing asp.

    To this end, after making arrangements with the rascal, Tarleton placed a second
    call, this one to an asp expert at a zoo.

    "Tell me about asps," he said.

    The asp expert took the call at a busy time, when he was engaged in tackling some
    kind of zoo asp mayhem. It is the kind of thing that happens all the time even
    at the best regulated zoos, and it is best you know nothing more. The upshot,
    however, was that the expert could not afford the time to spout all he knew of
    asps to Tarleton, as that would have taken several hours, hours he did not have
    as he strained every sinew to avert zoo asp mayhem. All he managed to splutter
    was some nonsense about the first asps having been created from the spilled blood
    of the head of Medusa, borne aloft by Perseus on his flight to Mount Olympus.
    He then slammed the phone down, leaving Tarleton little wiser than he was before.

    All this while, the mystery of the asp remained unsolved. Yet we know there are
    those who say it was Tarleton''s finest hour. Why would they say such a thing?
    He sat there, faffing with matchsticks and cardboard and glue and fusewire and
    hydroelectric power, and placing a couple of calls, occasionally glancing over
    at the trapped hissing asp, and hissing back at it. Perhaps that in itself is
    the mystery.

    When, later in the evening, the rascal appeared, to make illegal disposal of the
    corpse, he spotted the asp and licked his lips and asked Tarleton if he might
    remove, not just the corpse, but the asp into the bargain. Tarleton nodded.

    "Thankee kindly, sir," said the rascal, doffing his cap, "There''s nothing I like
    better for a nightcap than a tot of asp''s blood." and he whacked the asp on its
    head with a lead-weighted sap, and dragged it from under the corpse, and popped
    it in his pocket. We might mention here that the rascal had a pudding-basin haircut
    atop a countenance that was the spit and image of Alger Hiss.'
