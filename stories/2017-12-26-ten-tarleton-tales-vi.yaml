  text: "Tarleton was visited in his consulting rooms one April evening by a padding\
    \ fellow clutching a buff envelope.\nGlossary\_:\nTarleton, \u201Cthe amateur's\
    \ amateur\u201D.\nConsulting rooms, address unknown but probably in an ill-lit\
    \ alleyway off the main thoroughfare in Pointy Town.\nApril, fourth month of the\
    \ year. Abolished during the French Revolution and replaced by Germinal (to 19\
    \ April) and Flor\xE9al (from 20 April). Tarleton's internal \u201Cclock\u201D\
    \ was regulated accordingly, though not for ideological reasons.\nEvening, latter\
    \ part of the day, descending into dusk and twilight and, eventually, nightfall,\
    \ wherein terrors are unloosed (see Thomas Nashe, Terrors Of The Night, 1594).\n\
    Padding, moving like a cat.\nBuff envelope, an item of stationery, not to be confused\
    \ with the Buff Orpington, a type of duck.\n\u201CWhy are you padding into my\
    \ consulting rooms clutching a duck?\u201D asked Tarleton. Then, putting on his\
    \ spectacles, he added, \u201CI beg your pardon, I ought to say clutching an envelope.\u201D\
    \n\u201CWithin this buff envelope,\u201D said the visitor, \u201CAre papers which,\
    \ if revealed to the press, could bring about the collapse of several crowned\
    \ heads, and seething unrest throughout the continent!\u201D\nGlossary:\nThen,\
    \ here indicating the next action or event in a sequence. Can also refer to the\
    \ past, as in the model sentence \u201CI was happy then, in my childhood, before\
    \ the revolution, before the shambles wrought by our new masters\u201D.\nSpectacles,\
    \ eyeglasses, two monocles stuck together with connecting wire. Often rose-tinted,\
    \ though not in Tarleton's case.\nPapers, top secret quasi-official documents\
    \ of world-shuddering significance.\nThe press, generic term for newspapers, both\
    \ tabloid and broadsheet, even, great heavens to Betsy, Berliner format!, not\
    \ to be confused with Papers (see above).\nCollapse, can happen to puddings and\
    \ souffl\xE9s if cooking times go awry.\nCrowned heads, done away with, violently,\
    \ during revolutionary upheavals.\nUnrest, second album by Henry Cow, released\
    \ in 1974. Sock on cover.\nContinent, seven known to exist, in alphabetical order\
    \ Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America. There\
    \ may be others, hidden or occult. Continental location of Tarleton's consulting\
    \ rooms not yet identified beyond every shadow of a doubt (Alfred Hitchcock, 1943).\n\
    \u201CGood grief!\u201D spluttered Tarleton's sidekick Not-Tarleton, sprawled\
    \ on a beanbag by the fireplace, \u201CIf what you say is true we must act immediately\
    \ to stop the collapse and unrest in their tracks!\u201D\nAn enigmatic smile played\
    \ over Tarleton's lips.\n\u201CMay I have the buff envelope?\u201D he asked the\
    \ visitor.\nGlossary:\nGrief, Hardship, suffering; a kind, or cause, of hardship\
    \ or suffering. Hurt, harm, mischief or injury done or caused by another; damaged\
    \ inflicted or suffered; molestation, trouble, offence. A wrong or injury which\
    \ is the subject of formal complaint or demand for redress. Gravity, grievousness\
    \ (of an offence). Feeling of offence; displeasure, anger. A bodily injury or\
    \ ailment; a morbid affection of any part of the body; a sore, wound; a blemish\
    \ of the skin; a disease, sickness. The seat of disease; the diseased part; the\
    \ sore place. Physical pain or discomfort. Mental pain, distress, or sorrow. Deep\
    \ or violent sorrow, caused by loss or trouble; a keen or bitter feeling of regret\
    \ for something lost, remorse for something done, or sorrow for mishap to oneself\
    \ or others. Accidents in steeplechasing or in the hunting-field. Also in Golf.\
    \ (OED). Not-Tarleton's usage encompasses all these meanings, and more, oh! so\
    \ many more, for he is that kind of chap, sprawled on his beanbag, spluttering.\n\
    Sidekick, a companion, colleague, junior partner, straight man.\nNot-Tarleton,\
    \ specifically in this case, Tarleton's sidekick. More generally, can be applied\
    \ to any organism, animate or inanimate, other than Tarleton himself. Thus, everything\
    \ in the universe. Space precludes a complete list.\nBeanbag, a large sealed bag\
    \ containing synthetic beans, upon which to sprawl. Similar to the \u201CProtean\
    \ armchair\u201D in The Confidence-Man\_: His Masquerade by Herman Melville (1857).\n\
    Fireplace, as the name suggests, a place of fire, of licking flames, of heat and\
    \ blaze. Often located within an inglenook. Beanbags (see above) ought only be\
    \ placed near to inglenooks if they are fire-resistant, otherwise a single spark\
    \ from a hissing spitting coal upon the fire and, pfft!, up they go in flames.\
    \ For fictional treatments of the catastrophic effects of fire upon persons, see\
    \ Dickens, in particular Miss Havisham and Krook.\nTracks, \u201CSo take a good\
    \ look at my face / You'll see my smile looks out of place / If you look closer,\
    \ it's easy to trace / The tracks of my tears\u201D (The Tracks Of My Tears, Smokey\
    \ Robinson And The Miracles, 1965). In The Song Of Investment Capital Overseas\
    \ (1981), the Art Bears hint at tracks without quite mentioning them\_: \u201C\
    The roads and rails run like cracks / And carry me upon their backs\u201D.\nEnigmatic\
    \ smile, clich\xE9 used to impart spurious depth to a fictional character.\nLips,\
    \ important parts of the mouth.\nBuff envelope, remember not to confuse it with\
    \ a Buff Orpington duck.\nHesitantly, the visitor handed the buff envelope to\
    \ Tarleton. Without opening it, he in turn passed it to Not-Tarleton, still sprawled\
    \ on a beanbag by the fireplace.\n\u201CToss it on to the fire!\u201D he commanded.\n\
    Not-Tarleton did as he was bid, and within seconds the buff envelope, and its\
    \ mysterious world-shuddering contents, were consumed by the awful flames.\n\u201C\
    I think we can say that the world is a safer place,\u201D said Tarleton, smugly.\
    \ \u201CNow, shall we toast some crumpets?\u201D\nGlossary:\nIt would be a shame\
    \ to add a further gloss on terms at this point. We would distract from the thrilling\
    \ climax of the tale, and in any case few new words have been introduced. Hesitantly,\
    \ toss, bid, awful, toast and crumpets can be looked up in any decent dictionary,\
    \ and sometimes it is beneficial for readers to take the initiative, rather than\
    \ having everything handed to them on a plate.\nGlossary:\nPlate, or platter,\
    \ an item of crockery on which toasted crumpets are served in the consulting room\
    \ of Tarleton, the amateur's amateur, at the conclusion of the famous story Tarleton\
    \ And The Mysterious Affair Of The Buff Orpington\_\u2013 sorry,\_Envelope."
