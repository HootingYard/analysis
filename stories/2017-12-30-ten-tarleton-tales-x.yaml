  text: 'Note : As with the first of our Ten Tarleton Tales, Tarleton plays only a
    bit part in this final one, yet in many ways his bit is key to the whole damn
    thing.

    Snitby blubbing on the causeway. A death in the family. The priest is on his way,
    astride his elegant horse, along the clifftop path. Candles lit in the cottage,
    and blood on the pillow. The dog is being sick in the gutter. Snitby''s dog, with
    its corkscrew tail like a pig''s. Call My Bluff on the wireless. Nobody wants
    to turn it off. Robert Robinson says: cagmag. Nobody is listening. Birds are shrieking
    in the sky, an impossible blue, not a hint of cloud. Snitby''s tears extinguish
    his gasper. It is too wet to be relit so he tosses it into the sea. A gull swoops
    to examine it. The sound of hooves, but it is not the priest, not yet. It will
    not be the priest at all, today, for the telegram was mistranscribed and he has
    set off in entirely the wrong direction. He will arrive at Taddy at nightfall
    and have to be put up at an inn. Here comes the crone with the winding sheet.
    She has a goitre and clogs. The winding sheet is filthy. Snitby stares at the
    sea. The gull has flown away into the far distance. It is now a speck. In the
    cottage, Robert Robinson says: pannicles. There is nobody to hear him, for they
    have all come out to greet the crone, to kick the dog, to rub its snout in its
    vomit. It whimpers and scampers to the causeway. Snitby pats its head. A tiny
    white cloud appears in the sky. A police car screeches to a halt outside the cottage.
    Snitby scarpers.

    Snitby listening to Plastic Ono Band on his iPod.

    Snitby sobbing on the jetty. Undone by art. A seaside exhibition of oils by Tarleton.
    Oil paintings of oily subjects, rigs and slicks and sumps. A terrible beauty.
    His dog tied to a post outside the galeria. Really an underused seaside civic
    hall. Snitby overcome with emotion. Here in Taddy where the priest is still holed
    up in the inn, one or more limbs paralysed. He fell from his elegant horse as
    it cantered to a halt. A hopeful crone came clutching a winding sheet but he let
    out a groan and she was sent away. Salt stains on the jetty. Salt in Snitby''s
    tears. He holds his gasper at arm''s length. Sea sloshes against the wooden posts.
    Onions on Snitby''s breath. Tarleton dead these many years but still remembered
    and beloved in Taddy. He was a local boy. Blond and breathless. One leg shorter
    than the other. Collector of cakestands. Auctioned off. Snitby wanted one but
    had no cash to speak of. In exile here now and for the future, where the police
    have no remit. Ancient laws, woolly and medieval, like Snitby himself, after a
    fashion. In his attic room, the priest''s shutters are shut.

    Snitby reading Ruskin''s numbered paragraphs on his Kobo.

    Snitby bawling on the pier. The handcuffs chafe. The sergeant has a florid face
    and a massive moustache. His socks are unwashed and give off a whiff. Klaxons
    blaring. A pier ventriloquist stuffing his gob with steak and kidney pie while
    his dummy prates. It is reciting a list of over six hundred birds. Snitby''s face
    in the sawdust. A couple of teeth loose. Police brutality, but then the sergeant
    does not suffer fools gladly. Kicks Snitby as an afterthought. Fills out a form
    with the stub of a pencil. Ten miles along the coast from Taddy, twenty from the
    causeway. Geographical precision. Pins on a map. The priest an invaluable source
    of intelligence. One arm now working perfectly, or as near as dammit. Grace abounding.
    Gruel for his breakfast during Lent. Fish abounding in this resort, but he pushes
    his plate away with his good hand. The diocese is paying his bill at the inn.
    Totted up in the innkeeper''s head and nowhere else. Snitby turning to prayer.
    Mouth full of blood and sawdust. O Lord O Lord why hast Thou forsaken me?

    Snitby playing Demented Virtual Needlework on his iPad.

    Snitby weeping on the quayside. Tears blurring his vision. He cannot make out
    the horizon, simply a blank grey blue expanse. Fussing with rosary beads in his
    pocket. Given up the gaspers for now. Cries of gulls and clanks of tugboats. Foghorns
    on a clear day. A marching Salvation Army band. Catholicism versus muscular Christianity.
    It''s an endless battle with no winners. Snitby asked for a nun. He was sure this
    seaside resort had a convent, right on the harbour. He had his resorts all mixed
    up. Fifty miles from the causeway on the other side from Taddy. At high speed
    in a Japanese car with blinking lights and a siren. And motorbike outriders. And
    two helicopters. Promised a nun on arrival. Not in writing. Snitby''s dog still
    tied to its post in Taddy. Fawned over by passing widow-women. One will untie
    it and take it home to a cottage in the woods. It will run away and perish on
    a railway line beneath a thundering locomotive. The nun will hear about the accident
    on a nun''s grapevine but decide not to tell Snitby, Snitby in extremis.

    Snitby scraping his serial number on his iSlate.

    Transportation to shores afar

    But the gates of heaven are left ajar

    Repent while you can

    Repent while you can

    O you base and wretched man

    O''er the sea to a distant shore

    To see your homeland nevermore

    Repent while you can

    Repent while you can

    O you base and wretched man

    Snitby jumping overboard.'
