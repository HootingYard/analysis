  text: 'Concentrate, look carefully, and you will see an embittered dentist riven
    by crackers. The crackers are of a circular, unsalted variety, sealed in a cellophane
    package, itself further packaged inside a cardboard carton. The carton is primarily
    red, but has upon it a hyperrealist illustration of several circular unsalted
    crackers executed, for a hefty fee, by the noted hyperrealist Rex Hyper.

    The embittered dentist bought the carton of cellophane-wrapped crackers when,
    one morning, he popped in to his local corner shop. The shop was not actually
    located upon a corner. Nonetheless, in its ownership, size, opening hours, and
    range of items stocked, it fell so close to the common understanding of a corner
    shop that we may as well call it a corner shop, as most of its customers did,
    including, neatly, our embittered dentist.

    Along with the carton of crackers, the embittered dentist made purchase of a (plastic)
    bottle of milk, a newspaper (The Daily Embitterment), and a keyring to which was
    affixed a small rubber toad with a jewel embedded in its forehead. It was not
    a real jewel, but it sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight, or would, when the
    sun shone. But this was Hooting Yard, forever overcast, with drizzle threatening
    to become a downpour.

    Upon leaving the corner shop, clutching a paper bag in which the shopkeeper had
    placed with care his crackers and milk and paper and toad, the embittered dentist
    turned to his left, and pranced for perhaps five or six paces, before wheeling
    about and prancing in the completely opposite direction, to his right, towards
    ruins.

    These ruins were ancient, the ruins of what once had been a grand palace, much
    of which had crumbled as centuries passed. At the time it was built, so solid,
    so new, there were no dentists, as we would understand the term. Nor were there
    any hyperrealist illustrators, for the techniques of hyperrealist illustration
    were yet to be devised. It was a very long time ago.

    In the lee of a ruined nook, affording some shelter from the drizzle, the embittered
    dentist sat down upon a fragment of ruined wall. He took from the paper bag the
    newspaper, The Daily Embitterment, and read that day''s main headline.

    EMBITTERED DENTIST RIVEN BY CRACKERS, it said.

    Inside the bag, the small rubber toad with a false jewel embedded in its forehead
    suddenly twitched and squirmed. It had come to life!

    NB : This is not part of the planned scheme of interconnected prose pieces to
    which I referred the other day.'
