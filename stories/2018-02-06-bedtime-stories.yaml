  text: 'One of the most valuable lessons life has taught me is to know the difference
    between salvation and salivation. It is so easy to confuse the two, especially
    in one''s youth. When I was a young whippersnappernipper, long ago, I would regularly
    insert an i when one was not needed, or omit an i where the high heavens cried
    out for one. I know I was not the only pimply young shaver to commit these errors.
    Over the decades, I have had conversations with, ooh, hundreds if not thousands
    of people who were--and in some cases still are!--fuddled by the difference. It
    should go without saying that confusing the two can have serious ramifications.

    That is another word, incidentally, with which I had problems. I would commonly
    omit not just an i but also an a, giving it as ramfictions. This was because I
    thought it had something to do with stories about sheep. My dear departed Ma would
    regularly read to me a bedtime story about a sheep named Dolores, whose fleece
    became snagged on a wire fence at the edge of a field on a farm in a fictional
    place called Dippydopeyland. As her name indicates, Dolores was a ewe rather than
    a ram, so even if such a thing as a ramfiction existed, which it did not, except
    within my little head, her story would not have been one. But that was just something
    else that confused me as a child.

    When I heard the word ewe I thought the speaker was referring to a yew. I suspect
    this was because, when it was my dear departed Pa''s turn to read me a bedtime
    story, he invariably chose to recite, in an eerie voice, "The Moon And The Yew
    Tree" by Sylvia Plath. The result was that I found Ma''s story of Dolores frankly
    incomprehensible. The Plath poem, on the other hand, with its fumy spiritous mists
    and sea like a dark crime and bonging bells and bats and owls and the moon bald
    and wild and the blackness and silence, I found almost unbearably thrilling, so
    much so that I began to salivate. I would often slobber on to my pillow before
    Pa got to the end of the poem.

    Of course, I confused my salivation with salvation, and imagined Jesus was about
    to come and pluck me from my bed, and take me to his bosom, and up to heaven,
    where he wanted me for a sunbeam. Now, as it happened, if Ma and Pa were called
    away to a night rally, my dear departed Uncle Ned read my bedtime story, which
    for him was always Chapter V of Part III of Travels into Several Remote Nations
    of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain
    of Several Ships. That is why, throughout my childhood, I was convinced I was
    a cucumber.'
