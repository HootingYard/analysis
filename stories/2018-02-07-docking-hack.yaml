  text: 'Here is an old favourite, written over thirty years ago. Two words have been
    changed from the original version. I have no idea what it means, but it might
    be diverting to subject it to piercing critical analysis. Does anybody want to
    have a go?

    Hats are off in Docking; caps are being doffed. The council''s got a town plan.
    The maths are on a chart. Pips have been spat out and drudgery is bye-byed. Chocolate
    puddings seem to be in everybody''s pantry. And here comes Pebblehead pere. He
    caught a shark in waters. His sou''wester''s been askew since 1954-ish. Bubbles
    surge from froth. The chemist''s shop is shut. There''s pills & pills & pills
    that no Docking man could swallow. Suffering aborted. The council in a caucus.
    The shaven heads of heads of state are battering the doors down. The city gates,
    the turrets, the alleys, roads & mews: Docking has its ears all go for red alert
    decisions. Language has been no-no''d, the bamboo men are wailing, the breakage
    rate is scheduled: the system has been broken. Crayons pink & stacked, the burnt
    sienna packaged. Vandals clash at nightfall, but Docking has its crackers. Plastic
    wrapped in plastic. The Docking coffers emptied. Idiot brawl saloon bar, a gorgeous
    snag-tooth babble. Prepared to dance a hoo-cha, not a tear or boo-hoo. Thousands
    of museums stacked with golden maps. Misshapen trunk road closures. Big stone
    reconstructions. Docking''s cottoned on: it''s a town about a tower. The frame
    is out of kilter, the coughing''s filling coffins. Oh, but I want to go back to
    that Docking, Docking hack.'
