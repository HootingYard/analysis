  text: "When Eduard Raban, coming along the passage, walked into the open doorway,\
    \ he saw that it was raining. The morning drizzle had become a lunchtime downpour.\
    \ So teeming was the rain that Raban could barely see the milk bar across the\
    \ street. Crushed by weather, he turned abruptly, returned along the passage and\
    \ up the stairs and into his rented room and flung himself on to the bed and promptly\
    \ fell asleep.\nShortly afterwards, without waking, he rose from the bed, put\
    \ on a pair of galoshes, and went back out of the room and down the stairs and\
    \ along the passage and into the open doorway. But this time, being fast asleep,\
    \ he did not stop to consider the rain, but continued out, sploshing across the\
    \ puddle-splattered street and into the milk bar.\nHe sat at the communal table\
    \ and, still wholly unconscious, waved his arm in a languid, foppish manner to\
    \ attract the attention of the milk bar serving urchin, a tiny lad no more than\
    \ four foot tall, with a withered leg and a pointy hat. Unlike Raban, this urchin\
    \ boy was wide awake, almost uncannily so, vividly aware of everything going on\
    \ around him, from the languid and foppish gestures of unconscious customers to\
    \ the scuttling of tiny beetles across the sawdust floor of the milk bar.\nNow,\
    \ in the ringing words of Bl\xF6tzmann\u2014admittedly wrenched out of context\u2014\
    \u201CForget the somnambulist!\u201D and concentrate instead upon the urchin.\
    \ For it is this weedy milk bar factotum who played a decisive part in the history\
    \ of the century of which I write. This tiny lad was none other than Gus Von Vig,\
    \ inventor\u2014or perhaps one should say discoverer\u2014of the milk moustache.\
    \ It was a fashion craze that swept across the continent as relentlessly as the\
    \ plague-riddled rats of an earlier century. And it was more than a fad, oh!,\
    \ much more. One need only study photographs taken during the decades when the\
    \ milk moustache was de rigueur. Scarcely an upper lip is unadorned by a stripe\
    \ of dried or drying milk.\nBecause he was employed as a milk bar serving urchin,\
    \ it was long believed that Gus Von Vig lit upon the milk moustache in the course\
    \ of his duties. Recent and fantastically rigorous research by upper lip fashion\
    \ historian Popsi Uplip has demonstrated, beyond argument, that, on the contrary\
    \ and unexpectedly, Von Vig first gave the milk moustache a public outing dozens\
    \ of miles away from the milk bar, out in the country, when he attended a wedding.\n\
    He had been invited, the Lord only knows why, to the nuptials of Babinsky 2, the\
    \ idiot half-brother of the lumbering walrus-(not milk-)moustached serial killer\
    \ Babinsky, and his bride, the equally dimwitted Babs Glint, daughter of countryside\
    \ folk. The wedding took place in some godforsaken rustic hellhole a half-day's\
    \ train journey away from the bustling modern city, replete with street lighting\
    \ and majestic boulevards and sodium flares and milk bars where Gus Von Vig had\
    \ lived all his life.\nWhile he sat enlocomotived waiting for the train to chug\
    \ out of the station, far away in the countryside Mama and Papa Glint were making\
    \ preparations for their daughter's wedding. There was a tent. There were trestle\
    \ tables. There were cackhandedly embroidered cloths covering the tables. Upon\
    \ each cloth was placed a potato, one per table. There was every chance that pitting\
    \ the wedding guests against each other in games of the often brutal peasant sport\
    \ of Grab The Potato would lead to unbridled violence, but both Mama and Papa\
    \ Glint were brutish and given to unbridled violence, as were almost all the wedding\
    \ guests, as indeed was the blushing bride, dimwitted Babs.\nAlso preparing for\
    \ the wedding was the local man of the cloth, the Reverend Pluvius Mancloth. Urbane,\
    \ hirsute, vengeful, cantankerous, potty, gassy, ferocious, dismal, hare-brained,\
    \ hare-lipped, lascivious, erudite, appalling, nuts, rubicund, sordid, wintry,\
    \ butter-fingered, holy, brittle, bitter, blessed of the fruit of Our Lady's womb,\
    \ Jesus, half-full of grace, rotting-from-the-inside, creaky, blind, the Rev.\
    \ Mancloth was also brutish and given to unbridled violence, but only towards\
    \ puppies and kittens. To his flock of peasant churchgoers, he appeared addled\
    \ and incompetent, if somewhat greasy. And yet he was loved by them, with a deep\
    \ spiritual peasant love, akin to the love a farmer feels for his favourite pig.\
    \ It was appropriate, then, that the vicar prepared for the wedding by wallowing,\
    \ among pigs, in the muck, in their sty.\nWhat nobody could have foreseen was\
    \ that this squalid countryside wedding, of Babinsky 2 to Babs Glint, would witness\
    \ the public debut of the greatest upper lip fashion craze of the century. For\
    \ as his train chugged slowly towards the rustic hellhole's dilapidated railway\
    \ station, Gus Von Vig grew thirsty. He determined that the first thing he would\
    \ do, upon disembarking from the train, was to beg a farmer for a tumbler of milk.\n\
    As luck would have it, there was just such a farmer loitering on the station platform.\
    \ He was on the lookout for the railway cat, for which, each day, he would pour\
    \ a tumblerful of milk into a bowl, and watch it lap. When Gus Von Vig came mincing\
    \ along the platform, the milk had not yet been poured into the bowl. It was still\
    \ in the tumbler, held in the farmer's muscular and grubby peasant hand. Gus begged.\
    \ The farmer explained about the cat. Gus begged further, but the farmer would\
    \ not yield.\nThen Gus realised he had in his jacket pocket a persuasive theological\
    \ tract which, if he were to recite the more vivid passages to the farmer, might\
    \ change his mind. Coincidentally, this tract\u2014entitled Why Cats Must Suffer\u2014\
    had been written by the Rev. Pluvius Mancloth. It certainly proved persuasive,\
    \ for no sooner had he heard four or five words of it than the farmer handed the\
    \ tumbler of milk to Gus Von Vig, who gulped it down greedily, inadvertently leaving\
    \ the telltale stripe of a milk moustache on his upper lip.\nAnd it was thus adorned\
    \ that he attended the wedding. Not a single peasant expressed admiration of his\
    \ milk moustache, but at the reception, when the games of Grab The Potato descended\
    \ into unbridled violence, weedy Von Vig sought refuge from the brutality by fleeing\
    \ to a nearby newsagent's kiosk. Also at the kiosk, buying a bundle of the latest\
    \ fashion magazines, was the internationally celebrated Italian fashionista Giuseppe\
    \ Boppo. Boppo's glance fell on the milk moustache upon Von Vig's upper lip, and\
    \ so great was his ecstasy that he swooned. The rest is history.\nA question that\
    \ has always plagued those plagued by questions is precisely why Boppo was so\
    \ taken with the milk moustache. Such was his influence that, within a week of\
    \ the wedding, it was on the upper lips of the most fashionable people in every\
    \ important city across the continent. In her research paper, Popsi Uplip provides\
    \ a simple explanation, when she writes:\nHe's instantly ecstatic about everything\
    \ beautiful \u2026\nThe first sentence, and the last, were translated from the\
    \ German by Ernst Kaiser and Eithne Wilkins. Everything in between was not."
