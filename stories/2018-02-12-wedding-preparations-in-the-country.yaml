  text: 'When Eduard Raban, coming along the passage, walked into the open doorway,
    he saw that it was raining. The morning drizzle had become a lunchtime downpour.
    So teeming was the rain that Raban could barely see the milk bar across the street.
    Crushed by weather, he turned abruptly, returned along the passage and up the
    stairs and into his rented room and flung himself on to the bed and promptly fell
    asleep.

    Shortly afterwards, without waking, he rose from the bed, put on a pair of galoshes,
    and went back out of the room and down the stairs and along the passage and into
    the open doorway. But this time, being fast asleep, he did not stop to consider
    the rain, but continued out, sploshing across the puddle-splattered street and
    into the milk bar.

    He sat at the communal table and, still wholly unconscious, waved his arm in a
    languid, foppish manner to attract the attention of the milk bar serving urchin,
    a tiny lad no more than four foot tall, with a withered leg and a pointy hat.
    Unlike Raban, this urchin boy was wide awake, almost uncannily so, vividly aware
    of everything going on around him, from the languid and foppish gestures of unconscious
    customers to the scuttling of tiny beetles across the sawdust floor of the milk
    bar.

    Now, in the ringing words of Blotzmann--admittedly wrenched out of context--"Forget
    the somnambulist!" and concentrate instead upon the urchin. For it is this weedy
    milk bar factotum who played a decisive part in the history of the century of
    which I write. This tiny lad was none other than Gus Von Vig, inventor--or perhaps
    one should say discoverer--of the milk moustache. It was a fashion craze that
    swept across the continent as relentlessly as the plague-riddled rats of an earlier
    century. And it was more than a fad, oh!, much more. One need only study photographs
    taken during the decades when the milk moustache was de rigueur. Scarcely an upper
    lip is unadorned by a stripe of dried or drying milk.

    Because he was employed as a milk bar serving urchin, it was long believed that
    Gus Von Vig lit upon the milk moustache in the course of his duties. Recent and
    fantastically rigorous research by upper lip fashion historian Popsi Uplip has
    demonstrated, beyond argument, that, on the contrary and unexpectedly, Von Vig
    first gave the milk moustache a public outing dozens of miles away from the milk
    bar, out in the country, when he attended a wedding.

    He had been invited, the Lord only knows why, to the nuptials of Babinsky 2, the
    idiot half-brother of the lumbering walrus-(not milk-)moustached serial killer
    Babinsky, and his bride, the equally dimwitted Babs Glint, daughter of countryside
    folk. The wedding took place in some godforsaken rustic hellhole a half-day''s
    train journey away from the bustling modern city, replete with street lighting
    and majestic boulevards and sodium flares and milk bars where Gus Von Vig had
    lived all his life.

    While he sat enlocomotived waiting for the train to chug out of the station, far
    away in the countryside Mama and Papa Glint were making preparations for their
    daughter''s wedding. There was a tent. There were trestle tables. There were cackhandedly
    embroidered cloths covering the tables. Upon each cloth was placed a potato, one
    per table. There was every chance that pitting the wedding guests against each
    other in games of the often brutal peasant sport of Grab The Potato would lead
    to unbridled violence, but both Mama and Papa Glint were brutish and given to
    unbridled violence, as were almost all the wedding guests, as indeed was the blushing
    bride, dimwitted Babs.

    Also preparing for the wedding was the local man of the cloth, the Reverend Pluvius
    Mancloth. Urbane, hirsute, vengeful, cantankerous, potty, gassy, ferocious, dismal,
    hare-brained, hare-lipped, lascivious, erudite, appalling, nuts, rubicund, sordid,
    wintry, butter-fingered, holy, brittle, bitter, blessed of the fruit of Our Lady''s
    womb, Jesus, half-full of grace, rotting-from-the-inside, creaky, blind, the Rev.
    Mancloth was also brutish and given to unbridled violence, but only towards puppies
    and kittens. To his flock of peasant churchgoers, he appeared addled and incompetent,
    if somewhat greasy. And yet he was loved by them, with a deep spiritual peasant
    love, akin to the love a farmer feels for his favourite pig. It was appropriate,
    then, that the vicar prepared for the wedding by wallowing, among pigs, in the
    muck, in their sty.

    What nobody could have foreseen was that this squalid countryside wedding, of
    Babinsky 2 to Babs Glint, would witness the public debut of the greatest upper
    lip fashion craze of the century. For as his train chugged slowly towards the
    rustic hellhole''s dilapidated railway station, Gus Von Vig grew thirsty. He determined
    that the first thing he would do, upon disembarking from the train, was to beg
    a farmer for a tumbler of milk.

    As luck would have it, there was just such a farmer loitering on the station platform.
    He was on the lookout for the railway cat, for which, each day, he would pour
    a tumblerful of milk into a bowl, and watch it lap. When Gus Von Vig came mincing
    along the platform, the milk had not yet been poured into the bowl. It was still
    in the tumbler, held in the farmer''s muscular and grubby peasant hand. Gus begged.
    The farmer explained about the cat. Gus begged further, but the farmer would not
    yield.

    Then Gus realised he had in his jacket pocket a persuasive theological tract which,
    if he were to recite the more vivid passages to the farmer, might change his mind.
    Coincidentally, this tract--entitled Why Cats Must Suffer--had been written by
    the Rev. Pluvius Mancloth. It certainly proved persuasive, for no sooner had he
    heard four or five words of it than the farmer handed the tumbler of milk to Gus
    Von Vig, who gulped it down greedily, inadvertently leaving the telltale stripe
    of a milk moustache on his upper lip.

    And it was thus adorned that he attended the wedding. Not a single peasant expressed
    admiration of his milk moustache, but at the reception, when the games of Grab
    The Potato descended into unbridled violence, weedy Von Vig sought refuge from
    the brutality by fleeing to a nearby newsagent''s kiosk. Also at the kiosk, buying
    a bundle of the latest fashion magazines, was the internationally celebrated Italian
    fashionista Giuseppe Boppo. Boppo''s glance fell on the milk moustache upon Von
    Vig''s upper lip, and so great was his ecstasy that he swooned. The rest is history.

    A question that has always plagued those plagued by questions is precisely why
    Boppo was so taken with the milk moustache. Such was his influence that, within
    a week of the wedding, it was on the upper lips of the most fashionable people
    in every important city across the continent. In her research paper, Popsi Uplip
    provides a simple explanation, when she writes:

    He''s instantly ecstatic about everything beautiful ...

    The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Ernst Kaiser
    and Eithne Wilkins. Everything in between was not.'
