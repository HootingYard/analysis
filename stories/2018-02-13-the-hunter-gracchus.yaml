  text: 'Two boys were sitting on the harbour wall playing with dice. One of the boys
    was clever, and the other boy was dim. Now, when I tell you that one of the boys
    tossed the dice into the sea that sloshed against the harbour wall, you are likely
    to conclude that the boy who so tossed was the dim one. Dice serve no purpose
    in the sea. They will bob upon the surface of the waters, uselessly, carried by
    the tides, growing ever more distant the one from the other, sopping wet, and
    no longer to be played with.

    But in fact it was the clever boy who ruined their play by tossing the dice into
    the sea. For not only was he astoundingly clever, with an intellect far outwith
    the usual range of boyish brains, but he was also a psychopath. No sooner had
    he tossed the dice into the sea than he shoved his dim playmate off the harbour
    wall into the same sloshing sea and, for good measure, he grabbed hold of a passing
    harbour kitten and, deaf to its mewling, chucked it into the water alongside the
    dice and the dim boy. The name of this clever boy? Young Babinsky!

    Amused by his seaside enormities, the youthful psychopath toddled off to a milk
    bar with not a care in the world. Meanwhile, in the vast wet merciless sea, the
    dice bobbed, but the dim boy and the harbour kitten sank like stones, and the
    waters washed over them, and they were forgotten.


    Let us leap forward thirty, no, forty years. Forty is a better number than thirty,
    according to Blotzmann, who famously assigned abstruse yet compelling non-numerical
    values to certain numbers that took his fancy, for example eight and eleven and
    fifteen and sixteen and nineteen and twenty-six and twenty-nine and thirty-seven
    and forty and oh for god''s sake shut up with the list of numbers, it could go
    on ad infinitum. Suffice to say forty is one of Blotzmann''s so-called "basilisk"
    numbers, whatever that might mean.

    In the forty years since the clever boy and the dim boy sat on the harbour wall
    playing with dice, the wall has crumbled. The big wet sea is reclaiming the land.
    Half of the town is now under water, including the milk bar where, all those years
    ago, Babinsky drank a tumbler of warm sour goaty milk and chuckled at his youthful
    crimes. And now he has returned. Look, there he is, silhouetted against the ghastly
    sky, swinging his axe, standing on the town''s highest hill and gazing, perplexed,
    at the sea below. He has come on a pilgrimage of sorts, eager to revisit the scenes--idyllic,
    as he remembers them--of his youth. But they are gone, sunk beneath the waves
    as surely as his first victims, his dim playmate and the harbour kitten, vanished
    forever.


    Babinsky was not a man to let a little thing like the sea confound him. Pausing
    only to waylay a passing Punch & Judy man, butchering him with his axe and slicers,
    the lumbering walrus-moustached psychopath lumbered off towards a chandlery, where
    he rented a deep-sea diving outfit, complete with gleaming brass helmet. Then
    he walked into the sea, following the old familiar roads and paths and mews and
    alleys submerged under the churning waters, until he came to the milk bar.

    Its door had long ago fallen from its rusted hinges. Babinsky entered, and sat
    at the communal table, whereon tiny crabs scuttled and lobsters clacked. Memories
    tumbled through his insane head. He could almost taste the goaty milk of forty
    years ago.

    And then, from behind the milk bar counter, there appeared a sea-wraith, festooned
    in seaweed. It was accompanied by a sea-ghoul kitten. The kitten wore a necklace
    of eelgrass, on which were strung a pair of dice. The wraith sat down opposite
    Babinsky. The ghoulish kitten jumped up on to the table and chased away the crabs
    and lobsters.

    "Hello, Babinsky" gurgled the wraith.

    For once, the walrus-moustached psychopath was nonplussed.

    "Yes, it is me, your childhood playmate, poor dim Gracchus. You shoved me off
    the old harbour wall, into the pitiless sea, and chucked Tiddles the kitten in
    after me. I thank you for that. He has been a boon, if kittenish, companion these
    past forty years.

    "We both drowned, of course. But our bodies were never recovered. When we sank
    to the bottom of the sea, we were dragged into a cave by an old man with a long
    beard who carried a trident. He nursed us back to what passes for health among
    sea-wraiths and sea-ghouls, until we were well enough to attend his series of
    Microsoft PowerPoint presentations about undersea life. They were a real eye-opener,
    I can tell you. Even someone as dim as me, or as stupid as the kitten--we learned
    so much!

    "For example, do you have any idea how easy it is to hunt down and kill tiny fish
    such as dabs and sprats and blennies? That is how I make my living--or rather,
    wraithing--these days. I roam the seas in my little ship,  with Tiddles as First
    Mate, casting my net and catching tiny fish which I sell to the other denizens
    of the deep. There are all sorts down here--drowned sailors, suicides, nitwits
    who never learned to swim.

    "You should think about coming to join us, Babinsky. There must have been times,
    lying awake in your blood-drenched bed, when it crossed your mind that you should
    have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas. Not
    that it''s silent down here, oh no. Apart from the shrill piping screams of slaughtered
    dabs and sprats and blennies, there is the continuing reverberation of "Autumn",
    played by the house band on the Titanic, as documented by Gavin Bryars in his
    1975 recording The Sinking Of The Titanic, released on Brian Eno''s Obscure Records
    label. Plus there are all sorts of weird bubbly gurgling noises.

    "Anyway, Babinsky my old mucker, give it some thought. I think you''ll like it
    here. My ship has no rudder, and it is driven by the wind that blows in the undermost
    regions of death."

    The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Willa and
    Edwin Muir. Everything in between was not.'
