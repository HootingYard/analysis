  text: 'In her "Mind Your Language" column in The Spectator, Dot Wordsworth turns
    her attention to jejune. It is one of those words (like fulsome) where an erroneous
    usage is now so common that the correct, original meaning may be lost entirely.
    Because of its similarity to juvenile and French jeune, jejune is misused to mean
    childish, naive, callow. (Dot Wordsworth suggests George Bernard Shaw may be to
    blame.) This is the (wrong) sense given in the finest use of jejune in cinema
    history:

    What jejune actually means is thin, meagre, unsatisfying. Thank heavens there
    is at least one man who uses the word correctly. Blockbusting potboilerist Pebblehead
    has embarked on a new series of gaudy paperback potboilers which purport to be
    sequels, or prequels, or simply complete rewrites, of acknowledged classics. The
    first title to appear is Pebblehead''s take on Richard Llewellyn''s 1939 novel
    How Green Was My Valley. Recalling the privations of his childhood in Pang Hill
    Orphanage, Pebblehead''s book is entitled How Jejune Was My Gruel. It begins:

    How jejune was my gruel. Oh, how jejune it was. I remember so vividly how, when
    given my bowl of gruel in the orphanage dining hall, I was struck by its jejunosity.
    Has ever a poor orphan child, who grew up to become an internationally successful
    bestselling paperbackist, been faced with gruel so jejune? I think not.

    A film adaptation of How Jejune Was My Gruel is currently in production, starring
    anybody the producers can find whose career is not in tatters following allegations
    of sexual misconduct.
