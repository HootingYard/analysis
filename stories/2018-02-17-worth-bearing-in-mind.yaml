  text: 'In addition to Doktor Kafka the doom-ridden poete maudit of Prague, he gives
    us Dr Jackdaw (Kavka in Czech), the charming young writer, fond of slapstick humour,
    who, reading the first chapter of The Trial to his friends, became so convulsed
    with laughter that "he could not continue reading at times" while they howled
    "uncontrollably".
