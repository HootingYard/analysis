    \ gives us Dr Jackdaw (Kavka in Czech), the charming young writer, fond of slapstick\
    \ humour, who, reading the first chapter of The Trial to his friends, became so\
    \ convulsed with laughter that \u201Che could not continue reading at times\u201D\
    \ while they howled \u201Cuncontrollably\u201D.\nTim Martin, reviewing Kafka by\
    \ Reiner Stach"
