  text: 'Josef K. was dreaming. Don''t worry, I''m not going to tell you about it.
    Other people''s dreams are almost always insufferably boring. My heart sinks when
    somebody I barely know insists on telling me one of their dreams. It is akin to
    the horror I feel when buttonholed by somebody who is determined to read to me
    their "latest poem". These poems are invariably codswallop. And so it is with
    dreams.

    On the other hand we are, perhaps rightly, fascinated by our own dreams--as, I
    suppose, we are by our poems, if we are foolish enough to write them. Dreams churn
    up our memories, distort them, pluck them from where they belong and drop them
    into new and weird contexts. Because they belong to us, they are endlessly interesting.
    We try to wring sense from them, to act as our own Viennese quack and work out
    what the dream tells us about ourselves. Such navel-gazing is very pleasing, but
    you really don''t want to impose it on anybody else.

    Pleasing, yes, but sometimes futile. God alone knows how I have wrestled with
    the deep, deep meaning of a dream I had a few years ago, in which I attacked the
    actor Roy Kinnear, bashing him over the head with a chair. I never met the late
    Mr Kinnear. It is, to date, his sole appearance in my dreamworld. I still have
    no idea what that dream meant, if it meant anything.

    We might, if we are sufficiently engaged, find the dreams of fictional characters
    intriguing. I can''t remember the particular dream Josef K. had in A Dream by
    Franz Kafka, which is another reason I''m not telling you about it. But we ought
    to remember that fictional characters'' dreams aren''t real dreams--they''re made
    up by the author. They may well be based on actual dreams the author had, though
    there is no guarantee of that. In any case, you can bet on your sickly and wizened
    grandmother''s life that the author embroiders, and shapes the dream-narrative,
    through art.

    Consider, as an example, the story in which fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol has
    a dream while taking a pre-polevaulting nap. As readers, we know that the dream
    has been planted in his (fictional) sleeping brain, probably by his coach, the
    cantankerous, chain-smoking, enovercoated, Homburg-hatted, and all too real Old
    Halob, a non-fictional character if ever there was one.

    In the dream, Bobnit Tivol and Old Halob have somehow swapped identities. Thus,
    it is the coach who is polevaulting, an image so absurd and preposterous it is
    the epitome of dream-bizarrerie. This is what I mean by art. Fictional athlete
    Bobnit Tivol, meanwhile, in the persona of his coach, has gone to visit Old Halob''s
    sickly and wizened grandmother in her hovel. He explains to her, by thumps on
    her head, that he is going to gamble on her life in a sordid wager. The grandmother
    then takes off her thrum nightcap, and is revealed to be a large, fierce wolf,
    with gleaming and razor-sharp fangs.

    Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol screams. In real life, this is the point where
    a dreamer would be shocked awake. But in the story, the dream continues. Bobnit
    Tivol runs out of the hovel, runs and runs, and finds himself on a familiar running
    track. He runs round and round and round, in pursuit, now, of another runner,
    just ahead of him. Eventually the fictional athlete catches up with this runner,
    and they sprint across the finishing line at exactly the same moment. Panting,
    they turn to face each other, and Bobnit Tivol recognises his fellow-runner as
    the late actor Roy Kinnear.

    Arm in arm, they repair to a sort of supersonic milk bar, where they order a couple
    of sort of supersonic milk-based drinks. They sit at a table. All of a sudden,
    the writer Frank Key comes charging in and attacks Roy Kinnear, bashing him over
    the head with a chair.

    Frightened, Bobnit Tivol runs into a sort of supersonic milk bar pantry, locking
    the door behind him. He mops his fevered brow, first taking off his Homburg--remember,
    he is still in the guise of his coach Old Halob, who we assume is making up this
    dream. We might ask, then, at this point, whether the dream tells us more about
    (fictional) Bobnit Tivol or (non-fictional) Old Halob. We might ask the question
    of a Viennese quack, who would surely know the answer. But none is available,
    so instead, growing bored, we ask "how did the dream end?"

    Having removed his Homburg, Bobnit Tivol, or Old Halob, looked down, and saw that
    his trouser-cuffs were dirty and his shoes were laced up wrong. Bending to retie
    the shoelaces, he bumped his head on a headbumper. So severe was the bump that
    stars appeared revolving around his fictional, dream head, as in an illustration
    in a children''s comic. They were such pretty stars! Oh, how they twinkled! Enchanted
    by the sight, he woke up.

    The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Willa and
    Edwin Muir. Everything in between was not.'
