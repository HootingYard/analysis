  text: 'It looks as if much had been neglected in our country''s system of defence.
    Yes, Fort Hoity is famously impregnable, and Fort Toity likewise. But the fence
    linking them, running along the frontier, had been constructed from balsa wood
    and lollipop sticks. And when the swarm of specially-trained border wasps was
    wiped out by Hulbert-Courtneidge Disease, otherwise known as Border Wasp Wipeout
    Syndrome, the flimsiness of the fence had become all too apparent.

    Our neighbours are ferocious and barbaric. Night after night, on the other side
    of the fence, they light bonfires and dance in circles round them, screaming impious
    guttural cries and waving pitchforks. They are unfathomably stupid. To date, they
    have been kept at bay by the papier-mache wasps gummed to lollipop sticks at regular
    intervals along the frontier. The effectiveness of this defensive measure is unlikely
    to last. The puppet wasps cannot withstand torrential rainfall, of which there
    is much, in torrents, and our factories cannot churn out sufficient replacements,
    because of the shortages.

    From Fort Hoity, as also from Fort Toity, we take snipes at our barbarian foe
    by launching snipe at them. For those of you who know little or nothing about
    flying things with wings and beaks and feathers, the snipe is a type of bird.
    It has a long, sharp, pointy bill or beak (see previous sentence). Our snipe are
    specially trained to swoop relentlessly towards barbarians, and to pierce them
    with their pointy beaks, ideally puncturing one of the major arteries. Note that,
    as with sheep and teal, the plural of snipe is snipe. I do not know why that is
    the case. Ask an ornitholinguist.

    One drawback of our sniping is that, for all their savagery, our neighbours seem
    to have a way with birds. The original idea was that, having stabbed and slain
    a barbarian, the snipe would turn around and fly back to Fort Hoity (or Fort Toity),
    ready to be relaunched for another attack. But the barbarians cosset the snipe,
    and feed them millet and tiny terrified mammals, and make pets of them, and--maddeningly--the
    snipe thrive in their care. We are fortunate that thus far the savages have not
    yet worked out how to get the snipe to attack us.

    One of our brightest engineers has devised a plan to dig a ha-ha along the length
    of the fence between Fort Hoity and Fort Toity. Thus, if the barbarians did manage
    to breach the balsa wood and lollipop sticks and papier-mache wasps, they would
    immediately topple in to the ha-ha. They would be trapped like sitting ducks,
    and our forces could then make short work of them by dropping in a mass of violets
    and other flowers, smothering them as Heliogabalus did his enemies. Before we
    can put this plan into action, we need to convert much of our farmland into plantations
    for violets and other flowers, so we have enough for the smothering.

    Meanwhile, our Black Ops team conducts various black ops on both sides of the
    border. By their nature, black ops are carried out under the radar. As we do not
    have a radar, we fashioned a convincing counterfeit by attaching a couple of wire
    coat-hangers to the top of a lamppost near Fort Hoity, and another one near Fort
    Toity. So pig-ignorant and backward are the barbarians, they are completely taken
    in. Baffled by our superior technology, they think a coat-hanger is the work of
    the devil--and that is when it is used for its original purpose. As a faux radar,
    they think it is the work of two devils.

    Threatened as we are by brutes on the border, there is perhaps a greater peril
    lurking in our midst. I speak of the enemy within, the peaceniks. They are growing
    in number, in spite of our efficient secret police and the Friday night head-boilings
    at both Fort Hoity and Fort Toity. These "useful idiots" deny that our neighbours
    are barbaric savages who wish us harm, insisting rather that they are lovely people
    who just grunt rather more than we do. Look how they care for their snipe!, these
    nitwits cry, ignoring the fact that they are our snipe, primed to kill, and treacherously
    bought off by the barbarians with millet and tiny terrified mammals.

    Of equal concern to the authorities is the fashionable theory, currently being
    bruited about the cement water-troughs of our fauborgs, that there is no land
    at all on the other side of the fence, no barbarians, just the sea, the vast wet
    illimitable sea that stretches forever, to the ends of the earth. Proponents of
    this codswallop maintain that the bonfires we see are strange inexplicable atmospheric
    phenomena, that the barbarians dancing in circles round them, screaming impious
    guttural cries and waving pitchforks are mere sea-sprites, phantoms of wind and
    water and the play of the light. This is a misunderstanding of some kind; and
    it will be the ruin of us.

    The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Willa and
    Edwin Muir. Everything in between was not.'
