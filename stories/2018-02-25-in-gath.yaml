  text: "And lo! there came unto Gath an man whose head was as the head of the otter.\n\
    And his body also was as the form of the otter and likewise his dimension.\nAnd\
    \ when the man spoke his voice was as the cry of the otter.\nNow the people of\
    \ Gath, seeing this, were much afraid.\nThey gathered about the man with their\
    \ pointy sticks and led him unto their Hierophant.\nNow the Hierophant of Gath\
    \ dwelt in a place of much mist and vapourousness unyielding.\nAnd the people\
    \ said \u201CO Hierophant of Gath, we bring you this man in form like unto the\
    \ otter, what shall we do with him?\u201D\nAnd with his mouth the Hierophant of\
    \ Gath spoke mumbo-jumbo unto them and they laid down their pointy sticks and\
    \ returned to their fathers\u2019 fields where many tares were sown.\nAnd he took\
    \ the man like unto the otter into his house in the mists.\nAnd the next day there\
    \ came tidings of the Hindenburg disaster."
