  text: 'Several readers have written in to ask if any parallels can be drawn between
    Grandma Pipstraw''s Lovely Zoo and Noah''s Ark. The answer is: very few, the most
    noteworthy of which is that Grandma Pipstraw had three sons named Ham, Shem, and
    Japheth.

    Fans of nineteen-sixties folk-pop may recall them as The Singing Pipstraws. Think
    of The Seekers minus Judith Durham. Indeed, The Singing Pipstraws were sometimes
    mistaken for the Australasian foursome (minus Judith Durham), chiefly because
    Shem Pipstraw bore a striking resemblance to Seeker Athol Guy. He even obtained
    his trademark spectacles from the same optician, despite living on the other side
    of the world from that most wistful of eye specialists.

    Interestingly, the optician''s given name was Noah, and he lived on a boat moored
    in an important Australian river the name of which escapes me. I wanted to write
    the Maitland, but I think that is in Canada. There are so many rivers, not only
    in Australasia and North America but also on the other continents, and I can hardly
    be expected to remember them all, and to know at the drop of a hat which ones
    are on which continents. I have never proclaimed myself a river expert--unlike
    Ham Pipstraw, who, when he was not strumming a stringed instrument and warbling,
    liked nothing better than to pore over atlases and gazetteers, memorising all
    the rivers of the world, their names and lengths and locations and directions
    of flow. By the time of his tragically early death, Ham Pipstraw had committed
    to memory the details of at least six rivers worldwide.

    Several readers have written in, in the last few seconds, to ask for details of
    the tragically early death of sixties folk-pop legend Ham Pipstraw. It happened
    like this. He was visiting the zoo and aviary run by his mother, known as Grandma
    Pipstraw''s Lovely Zoo, when he was engulfed in a flock of whinchats. The frantic
    beating of their tiny wings did for Ham Pipstraw.

    He was memorialised in a song by his surviving brothers, which topped the hit
    parade until it was dislodged by a disc more in keeping with the freaky psychedelic
    groove which fuddled the heads of the so-called new generation. All generations
    are new--that is the point of them.

    Shem and Japheth invited Noah to replace Ham, so they could be a trio again, but
    the wistful Australian optician declined, citing a devotion to the correction
    of eyesight, a tin ear, and the trauma he had experienced when his own beat combo
    recorded their difficult second album.

    Other parallels between Grandma Pipstraw''s Lovely Zoo and Noah''s Ark are the
    subject of a forthcoming stage musical starring a hologram of the late Dusty Springfield.'
