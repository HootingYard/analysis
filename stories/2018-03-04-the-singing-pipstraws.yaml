  text: "Several readers have written in to ask if any parallels can be drawn between\
    \ Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely Zoo and Noah's Ark. The answer is: very few, the most\
    \ noteworthy of which is that Grandma Pipstraw had three sons named Ham, Shem,\
    \ and Japheth.\nFans of nineteen-sixties folk-pop may recall them as The Singing\
    \ Pipstraws. Think of The Seekers minus Judith Durham. Indeed, The Singing Pipstraws\
    \ were sometimes mistaken for the Australasian foursome (minus Judith Durham),\
    \ chiefly because Shem Pipstraw bore a striking resemblance to Seeker Athol Guy.\
    \ He even obtained his trademark spectacles from the same optician, despite living\
    \ on the other side of the world from that most wistful of eye specialists.\n\
    Interestingly, the optician's given name was Noah, and he lived on a boat moored\
    \ in an important Australian river the name of which escapes me. I wanted to write\
    \ the Maitland, but I think that is in Canada. There are so many rivers, not only\
    \ in Australasia and North America but also on the other continents, and I can\
    \ hardly be expected to remember them all, and to know at the drop of a hat which\
    \ ones are on which continents. I have never proclaimed myself a river expert\u2014\
    unlike Ham Pipstraw, who, when he was not strumming a stringed instrument and\
    \ warbling, liked nothing better than to pore over atlases and gazetteers, memorising\
    \ all the rivers of the world, their names and lengths and locations and directions\
    \ of flow. By the time of his tragically early death, Ham Pipstraw had committed\
    \ to memory the details of at least six rivers worldwide.\nSeveral readers have\
    \ written in, in the last few seconds, to ask for details of the tragically early\
    \ death of sixties folk-pop legend Ham Pipstraw. It happened like this. He was\
    \ visiting the zoo and aviary run by his mother, known as Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely\
    \ Zoo, when he was engulfed in a flock of whinchats. The frantic beating of their\
    \ tiny wings did for Ham Pipstraw.\nHe was memorialised in a song by his surviving\
    \ brothers, which topped the hit parade until it was dislodged by a disc more\
    \ in keeping with the freaky psychedelic groove which fuddled the heads of the\
    \ so-called new generation. All generations are new\u2014that is the point of\
    \ them.\nShem and Japheth invited Noah to replace Ham, so they could be a trio\
    \ again, but the wistful Australian optician declined, citing a devotion to the\
    \ correction of eyesight, a tin ear, and the trauma he had experienced when his\
    \ own beat combo recorded their difficult second album.\nOther parallels between\
    \ Grandma Pipstraw's Lovely Zoo and Noah's Ark are the subject of a forthcoming\
    \ stage musical starring a hologram of the late Dusty Springfield."
