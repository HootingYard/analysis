  text: 'The orchard gull is a bird I remember from my childhood. It was often to
    be seen perched on the railings around the plot of what once had been a thriving
    orchard, now overgrown with weeds and nettles. The trees were dead or dying. The
    gull was alive and raucous.

    It was a one-legged gull, its other leg a stump, having suffered a catastrophic
    bird injury. I admired its ability to balance on the railings. I admired, too,
    its inhuman savagery. Birds are not like us, not at all.

    At a loose end one day when Harold Wilson was prime minister, I fashioned a doll
    orchard gull from a wire coathanger and cloth and rags and cotton wool and pipe-cleaners.
    I used lollipop sticks for the legs, snapping two-thirds off the length of one
    to represent the stump.

    I finished making the doll at ten o'' clock in the morning, and went mincing off
    along the lane towards the orchard. I placed my doll on the railings, near to
    where the orchard gull often perched, though there was no sign of it that morning.

    When I returned home, my Ma and Pa were discussing the death, recently announced,
    a month short of her ninetieth birthday, of Alice B Toklas. I remember how they
    got into a spat about her middle name. Pa swore it was Blossom, while Ma was sure
    it was Babette. Ma was right, but it was several days before she was able to claim
    victory, when the mobile library, with its reference books, came to our neck of
    the woods.

    Late that afternoon I returned to the orchard to see how my gull doll was getting
    along. As I approached the railings, I saw that it had been rent asunder, torn
    to shreds, clearly with inhuman savagery. The orchard gull itself was nowhere
    to be seen, but I had no doubt it had attacked and destroyed my doll.

    It pained me that the orchard gull had, plainly, loathed its likeness. I gathered
    up the few stray remnants of coathanger and cloth and rags and cotton wool and
    pipe-cleaners and lollipop sticks and returned home, resolved to make a more flattering
    replica.'
