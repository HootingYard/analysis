  text: "An item in Futility Closet yesterday includes some amusing tombstone inscriptions.\
    \ One in particular filled me with glee, and I hereby declare that the words in\
    \ bold type must appear on my own grave, when the time comes \u2026\nSacred to\
    \ the memory of inestimable worth of unrivalled excellence and virtue, N.R., whose\
    \ ethereal parts became seraphic, May 25th, 1767."
