  text: "This picture was taken over fifty years ago. It was part of a photo-shoot\
    \ for the now defunct River Gods In Repose magazine, at that time one of the best-selling\
    \ \u201Cglossies\u201D. One terrible day, when the sun was blotted out and the\
    \ sky was black, a photographer came calling at Old Ma Bittergall's Grim Orphanage\
    \ For Cherubic Tots, where I was a day pupil. Our whole class was taken in a charabanc\
    \ to where Old Father Nile was sprawled, and we were told to disport ourselves\
    \ upon him, and lark about, so long as we stayed perfectly still at the snapper's\
    \ command. I remember the river god's breath stank of rotten fish. The cherubic\
    \ tot to my left, sitting on the god's shoulder, is my grate friend peason, who\
    \ was uterly wet and a weed.\n"
