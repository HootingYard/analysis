  text: 'We are five friends, one day we came out of a house one after the other,
    first one came and placed himself beside the gate, then the second came, or rather
    he glided through the gate like a little ball of quicksilver, and placed himself
    near the first one, then came the third, then the fourth, then the fifth. We were
    like a five-sided die. Most dice have six sides, or faces, I think, but we were
    like one of those five-sided dice you used to be able to buy at Mr Fatso''s Unseemly
    Joke Shop. There is an old canard that a five-sided die is a geometric impossibility.
    Well, try telling that to Mr Fatso. He will spit on your shoes and push one of
    his novelty spiders up your nose.

    We did not come out of the house voluntarily. We were turfed out, one by one,
    by its paterfamilias. Several hours earlier, shortly after the risen sun brought
    a blush of golden loveliness to the burgeoning day (Dinsey), we had barged into
    the house purporting to proselytise. We claimed to be Adepts of the Order of Sibodnedwab,
    an esoteric order devoted to esoterica, spiritual perfection, and robbery. On
    the pretext of converting the occupants to our cause, we hoped to snaffle items
    such as kettles, cushions, and coathangers.

    They were a--very wholesome--family of four, Pa and Ma and Little Gus and Little
    Gertrude. We kept them entranced by chalking an esoteric design upon the carpet,
    babbling incoherent yet strangely compelling gibberish, and summoning, from a
    plume of smoke, the jewel-encrusted toad god Alf. Everything was going swimmingly
    until one of us--I won''t say who--got carried away and pushed one of Mr Fatso''s
    novelty spiders up Little Gus''s nose. His Pa became enraged. He was wholesome
    but also a champion wrestler, as big and broad as a big broad bear--see Colour
    Plate XIV in Snit''s Picture Book Of Bears. That will give you an idea of who
    we were dealing with.

    Or not dealing with. One by one, Pa picked us up by the scruff of the neck and
    hoicked us out of the house. We came away with nothing. Now we are gathered at
    the gate, the five of us, like a five-sided die, wondering what to do next.

    "Let us repair to an ice cream parlour!" cries Ringo. I ought to explain that
    we are each named after a Beatle. That means four of us have fixed names, while
    the fifth is known variously as Stu or Brian or George (the other one) or Mal
    or Yoko, depending upon which lengthy and pointless bit of conjecture gleaned
    from a half-century''s-worth of so-called rock journalism is uppermost in our
    minds at any one time.

    Usually we like to engage in lengthy and pointless arguments, particularly when
    it is Ringo calling the shots, but this morning we all agree that ice cream sounds
    like a capital idea. After all, was it not Perkins who wrote "a choc ice is always
    a consolation"?

    So off we toddle, the five of us, towards the nearest ice cream parlour, as the
    hands of the clock creep inexorably towards that position where they are both
    pointing in an identical, decisive vertical. There is a name for that precise
    alignment. You can look it up in Hodgepang''s The Positions Of Clock-Hands And
    Their Implications.

    As we pass a splurge of binsey poplars, one of us--I won''t say who--looks back
    and sees, springing along the lane in pursuit, the jewel-encrusted toad god Alf.
    He is such a nuisance! Years ago, we hired him from Mr Fatso''s Unseemly Joke
    Shop, thinking he would add a dash of panache to our Order of Sibodnedwab capers.
    And he did, but he never leaves us alone, when for example we want to go and eat
    choc ices. We stopped paying Mr Fatso his rental fee long ago, but the toad god
    still follows us about. Is he a toad god or a toad demon? No matter how he pouts
    his lips we push him away with our elbows, but however much we push him away,
    back he comes.

    The first sentence, and the last, were translated from the German by Tania and
    James Stern. Everything in between was not.'
