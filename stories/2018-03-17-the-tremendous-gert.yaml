  text: 'Readers may recall my essay about the world-famous food-splattered Jesuit.
    I imagined a music hall act of "sheer simplicity. The curtains would open and
    there, on stage, world-famous and splattered with food, stood a Jesuit. He would
    extend his arms, almost in crucifixion pose, and gaze at a point slightly above
    the heads of the audience. There were no frills, no ''business'' with props. After
    a few minutes, the curtains would close, and--barring the inevitable encore--that
    was that."

    It has now come to my attention that, as so often, the real world anticipated
    the supposedly wacky world of Hooting Yard, and by many decades. Via Strange Flowers,
    I learned today of Weimar cabaret artist Valeska Gert. "In the 1920s, Gert premiered
    one of her most provocative works entitled Pause. Performed in between reels at
    Berlin cinemas, it was intended to draw attention to inactivity, silence, serenity,
    and stillness amidst all the movement and chaos in modern life. She came onstage
    and literally just stood there. ''It was so radical just to go on stage in the
    cinema and stand there and do nothing,'' said Wolfgang Mueller."

    Here she is in more animated mode:'
