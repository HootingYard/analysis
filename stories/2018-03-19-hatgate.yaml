  text: "The row between Twittery Corbynistas and the BBC over Jeremy Corbyn's hat\u2014\
    a row some have dubbed Hatgate \u2013 reminded me that during the late 1960s,\
    \ at the height of the Cold War, my father sported a Russian-style winter hat.\
    \ This led some neighbours on our council estate to surmise that my Pa was a Soviet\
    \ spy. The fact that he regularly popped in to the newsagent's to pick up a copy\
    \ of the Morning Star probably added to their suspicions. Unfortunately I don't\
    \ have a photograph, doctored or otherwise, of my father in his Communist headgear.\n\
    \nOne of the amusing things about all the nitwit fans losing their marbles over\
    \ supposed BBC perfidy is that there must be thousands of photographs of Corbyn\
    \ wearing self-styled \u201Crevolutionary\u201D attire. Remember that the dear\
    \ leader's politics are still those of an earnest teenager circa 1968. Before\
    \ becoming Labour leader, he was regularly pictured wearing Leninist workers\u2019\
    \ caps or one of those scarves the Palestinian death cult maniacs are so fond\
    \ of.\nOK, now I'm off to the political re-education camp to learn the errors\
    \ of my ways."
