    GAEL ANDERSON, the bride-to-be

    ANDREW CLUTTERBUCK, her suitor

    IAN ANDERSON, minstrel & father of Gael

    Scene: A mansion in the countryside

    Enter GAEL and ANDREW

    GAEL : Oh darling! I am so thrilled at the prospect of our imminent betrothal!

    ANDREW : As I am too, my poppet. [A dark cloud passes over his brow.] But first
    I must ask your father for your hand in marriage. I fear he may place hurdles
    in our path.

    GAEL : It is true he can be an exacting man, darling, but I feel sure you will
    win him over.

    ANDREW : Well, we shall find out soon enough. Hark! I hear him approach!

    Enter IAN ANDERSON

    IAN : Hello Gael, hello young fellow-me-lad.

    GAEL : Hello Papa!

    ANDREW : Hello Ian ... I may call you Ian?

    IAN : No you may not. Address me as J-Tull Dot Com, as in the title of the 1999
    album release by my rock band.

    ANDREW : Oh ... okay.

    IAN : [Laughing] But I jest with you! By all means call me Ian. And what brings
    you to my country pile on this lovely summer''s day, sonny?

    ANDREW : Well, I, er, um ...

    GAEL : Go on, darling, ask him!

    ANDREW : I come to ask for the fair and dainty hand of your daughter in marriage.

    IAN : I see. And are you a worthy suitor?

    GAEL : He is, Papa, he is!

    IAN : To be worthy of my daughter, a man must be able to play the flute while
    standing on one leg. Can you do that, son?

    ANDREW : [Crestfallen] I''m not sure.

    GAEL : But Papa, Andrew has other special skills. He has fought many zombies,
    and has a string of triumphs over the walking dead!

    IAN : Really? I have not heard anything so preposterous since Crest Of A Knave,
    the 1987 album release by my rock band.

    GAEL : Yes, really, Papa! Have you not seen the post-apocalyptic television drama
    The Walking Dead? Every week, Andrew gives those zombies the what-for!

    IAN : My poor sweet child, you are confusing Mr Clutterbuck here with Andrew Lincoln,
    the zombie-battling star of that show.

    ANDREW : Be it known that I am Andrew Lincoln! Born a Clutterbuck, I dropped that
    foolish surname when I embarked upon my glittering thespian career.

    IAN : Is that so? Well then, I give my consent!

    GAEL : Oh thank you Papa!

    ANDREW : Thank you, J-Tull Dot Com sir!

    IAN : Let us celebrate by singing a few snatches from Aqualung, the 1971 album
    release by my rock band.

    They sing & wassail.

    Curtain.
