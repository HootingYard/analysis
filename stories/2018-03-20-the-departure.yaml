  text: "I ordered my horse to be brought from the stables. His name is Alan. He is\
    \ an elegant horse, but tubercular. His shanks are admirable, and he has as fine\
    \ a mane as any horse in Christendom.\nThe stable-boy, a pockmarked little squirt\
    \ who bore a distinct resemblance to the young Stalin, came limping out. His face\
    \ was drained of all colour.\n\u201CAlan is gone, gone, vanished, as if in a puff\
    \ of smoke!\u201D he cried, and began to weep.\nI cannot bear the sight of a weeping\
    \ stable-boy.\n\u201CI cannot bear the sight of a weeping stable-boy!\u201D I\
    \ cried, \u201CStop snivelling!\u201D\nAnd I jabbed a finger sharply into one\
    \ of his pocks. I found this immensely satisfying, so I jabbed my other seven\
    \ fingers, one by one, into seven of his other pocks.\n\u201CNow,\u201D I said,\
    \ \u201CYou will go and find Alan. The mobile library is parked outside the birdseed\
    \ shop on Lower Goat Lane. In the library, you will find a horse-atlas. Borrow\
    \ it, using your library ticket. The horse-atlas contains many maps showing those\
    \ parts where horses of different complexions and beauty are located. It is likely\
    \ Alan has galloped to one such part of our land. Work out which, using the horse-knowledge\
    \ you have acquired as a stable-boy, get thee hence, and fetch him back, using\
    \ a lasso if need be.\u201D\nI was pleased with this little speech, almost as\
    \ pleased as I was jabbing my fingers into his pocks, so I took myself off to\
    \ the tavern for well-deserved refreshment. When I arrived at the tavern, on Upper\
    \ Goat Lane, I discovered that it was under new management and had been turned\
    \ into a trendy milk bar, within which dozens of beatniks were playing bongos\
    \ and reciting terrible poetry.\nAs I sipped my tumbler of milk, I jotted down\
    \ the words of one of the poems I heard.\nI saw the best minds of my generation\
    \ destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,\nBecause their horses had gone\
    \ missing from the stables\nBut they were in luck because they could send pockmarked\
    \ stable-boys who looked like the young Stalin\nOff in search of their horses\
    \ armed with a horse-atlas from the mobile library.\nFor some reason, I found\
    \ that this poem spoke to me in a way the other beatnik twaddle did not. Perhaps\
    \ it was because I was one of the best minds of my generation. I had a trophy\
    \ to prove it, a cup I had been given in my infant school. The full wording etched\
    \ on the cup was another poem:\nBest mind your cup, oh child so tiny\nIf you break\
    \ it you will be whiney\nAnd if you whine on Saint Spivack's Day\nThe Grunty Man\
    \ will take you away!\nI had actually been taken away by the fearsome and awful\
    \ Grunty Man at the age of six, but he grew so exasperated by my constant whining\
    \ that he brought me back again later the same day. As I sat in the groovy milk\
    \ bar, I could only hope that the stable-boy would bring Alan the horse back just\
    \ as quickly.\nHe duly turned up several hours later, by which time I had drunk\
    \ so much milk, and listened to so much terrible poetry accompanied by bongos,\
    \ that I was burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo\
    \ in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high\
    \ sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across\
    \ the tops of cities contemplating jazz.\nThe stable-boy had brought me a horse,\
    \ but it was not Alan. It was neither elegant nor tubercular, its shanks were\
    \ despicable, and its mane was nothing to write home about.\n\u201CThat horse\
    \ is not Alan!\u201D I cried, \u201CIt is neither elegant nor tubercular, its\
    \ shanks are despicable, and its mane is nothing to write home about!\u201D\n\u201C\
    Sorry,\u201D said the stable-boy, \u201CI visited many many many of the places\
    \ on the maps in the horse-atlas, and this is the best I could do.\u201D\nI was\
    \ minded to jab my fingers in his pocks again, but I restrained myself.\n\u201C\
    Take the new horse to the stables and saddle it up,\u201D I said, \u201CI will\
    \ be along shortly, for I have miles to go before I vomit up all this milk and\
    \ go to sleep.\u201D\nThe stable-boy plodded off with the horse in tow, and I\
    \ drank another tumbler of milk and listened to another godawful poem accompanied\
    \ by bongos.\nWhen I made to leave, I found my way barred by a huge bouncer-beatnik.\n\
    \u201CWhat gives, daddy-o?\u201D he said, \u201CYou don't want to leave this groovy\
    \ milk bar. Anyway, we won't let you. You're the kind of cat we'd love to have\
    \ hitting those bongos morning noon and night. You really fry my wig. Yes, you'll\
    \ stay here forever, drinking milk and thumping bongos. Where would you go, anyway?\u201D\
    \nI whined.\n\u201COut of here\u2014that's my goal.\u201D\nThe first sentence,\
    \ and the last, were translated from the German by Tania and James Stern. Everything\
    \ in between was not."
