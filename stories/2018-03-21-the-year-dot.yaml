  text: "\nThe noted mezzotintist Dot Tint was born in the Year Dot. Some researchers\
    \ argue that she was named for the year in which she was born, while others, conversely,\
    \ claim the year was so named in honour of her. On the face ot it, the latter\
    \ seems unlikely. Noted Dot Tint may be, but do enough people care enough about\
    \ mezzotints or their makers to start naming entire years after them? But those\
    \ who take this side of the argument are indefatigable, relentless, and occasionally\
    \ physically violent when propounding their case.\nAnd admittedly, they have a\
    \ number of points in their favour. No one knows what the Year Dot was called\
    \ before it was designated the Year Dot. They are also able to point to the Year\
    \ Kuryakin, which all authorities agree was named after Ilya Kuryakin, the Russian\
    \ agent in the television seiies The Man From U.N.C.L.E. played by the Scottish-American\
    \ actor David McCallum. Poignantly, there is not, and never has been, a Year McCallum.\
    \ Thus, the calendar recognises his fictional persona rather than the man himself.\n\
    A question well worth asking, whichever side of the Dot Tint fence you are on,\
    \ is\_: what kind of blather is this?"
