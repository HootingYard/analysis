  text: 'I have occasionally muttered in exasperation when the world o'' Hooting Yard
    is described as "surreal" or "weird", given that the so-called real world is often
    so much stranger. Just the other day, there was that business about the (all too
    real) Valeska Gert anticipating the (wholly fictional) world-famous food-splattered
    Jesuit.

    Now, courtesy of Richard Carter at Gruts, I learn of a real world mother who seems
    to outdo my fictional mother in Songs My Mother Taught Me.

    Neil Armstrong (no, not that Neil Armstrong) reviewing Secret Pigeon Service:
    Operation Columba, Resistance and the Struggle to Liberate Europe by Gordon Corera
    in the latest edition of Literary Review:

    Among others, we meet Viscount Tredegar, an occultist and friend of Aleister Crowley.
    He was for a time in charge of the section of the army that supplied MI14(d) with
    birds but was eventually court-martialled for gossiping about Columba''s work.
    His defence cited his unhappy childhood and the fact that his mentally ill mother
    had built herself a large bird''s nest in the living room and sat in it wearing
    a beak.'
