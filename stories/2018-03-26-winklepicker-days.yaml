  text: "Oh! How I pine for those winklepicker days\n  On the pier at Deal\n  Like\
    \ Ingmar Bergman's camera's gaze\n  In The Seventh Seal\n  Yes, I played chess\
    \ on Deal pier\n  Against Death dressed in black\n  But I was shod in winklepickers\n\
    \  And they took Death aback\n  I saw envy on his pale white face\n  Envy for\
    \ my shoon\n  And I bested Death on the pier at Deal\n  Under a Kentish moon"
