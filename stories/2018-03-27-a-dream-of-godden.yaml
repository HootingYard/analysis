  text: "\nAh, the manifold complexities of the human brain! In my dreams, as I slept\
    \ last night, there was a starring role for Rumer Godden. Quite what she was up\
    \ to became unclear the moment I awoke, and now I remember nothing at all, save\
    \ that she had a very important part to play in whatever was going on in my sleeping\
    \ head.\nBut why? I have never read any of her books. I had to remind myself,\
    \ with a tiny bit of morning research, that she was the author of (among much\
    \ else) Black Narcissus. I know almost nothing about her. Yet here she was, unsummoned,\
    \ at the forefront of my unconscious mind.\nAt least I did not bash her about\
    \ with a wooden chair, as once\u2014in dreams\u2014I bashed Roy Kinnear \u2026"
