  text: "Gus was pipped at the post. It was one of those huffington posts, recently\
    \ erected at strategic points across the land, by diktat. They were named in honour\
    \ of Puissance Huffington, the tiny orphan child who, by some inexplicable chain\
    \ of accidents, now reigns over our realm. Nobody expected frail little Puissance\
    \ to rule with an iron fist, but she does, and then some!\nLike so many citizens,\
    \ Gus had assumed that Puissance would be a benign queenlet. It was perhaps this\
    \ naivete which led to his undoing, when he entered a contest in the weekly children's\
    \ comic The Terrible Wrath Of Christ Our Saviour. Readers were asked to supply\
    \ a caption for a drawing which showed an innocent farmyard scene, typical of\
    \ our country. Mischievous Gus wrote something disobliging about a hen, unaware\
    \ that every single caption submitted to the comic would be scrutinised, personally,\
    \ by Puissance Huffington. She could not read, of course, so pressed into service\
    \ a man of letters who loitered somewhere in the bowels of the palace. When this\
    \ sickly one-legged fellow read to Puissance the words written by Gus, she was\
    \ outraged.\n\u201CI am very fond of hens,\u201D she is reported to have said,\
    \ \u201CAnd I will not have disobliging things said of them, no siree!\u201D\n\
    And she told the man of letters to aim his crutches in the direction of the Palace\
    \ Git, conveying instructions to have Gus arrested. And so within hours of writing\
    \ his unwise words, Gus found himself chained to one of the huffington posts in\
    \ one of the less salubrious parts of the country, populated for the most part\
    \ by ne'er-do-wells, halfwits, and Corbynistas. Eagerly, they pelted Gus with\
    \ pips, as Puissance Huffington decreed.\nIn retrospect, we can appreciate just\
    \ how fortunate Gus was to have committed his crime in the early days of the reign\
    \ of Puissance. For her power made the little orphan child ever more vindictive\
    \ and cruel, and it was not long before she declared that miscreants should be\
    \ pelted, not with pips, but with plumstones.\n"
