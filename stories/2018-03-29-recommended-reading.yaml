text: "\nI sprawled in the mosque and thought about Allah.\n    Did he, I wonder,\
  \ ever visit Valhalla?\n    Would the Vikings have allowed him to enter\n    And\
  \ make it an Islamic Cultural Centre?\n    Or would they have smote him with axe\
  \ and bludgeon\n    Violent in their Nordic dudgeon?\n    There is only one true\
  \ God.\n    Requiem aeternam dona ei, Ken Dodd."
