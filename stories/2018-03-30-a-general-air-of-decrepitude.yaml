  text: Yesterday's episode of Hooting Yard On The Air (aka A General Air Of Decrepitude)
    was a packed show. Mr Key read the stories A Dream, At Night, and An Old Manuscript,
    and he was joined for a performance of the one-act play Overheard In A Supermarket
    by Miss Blossom Partridge, aka Pansy Cradledew, who also read The Coronation and
    joined Mr Key for a recital of In Gath. In addition, there was a brief discussion
    of Scritti Politti, an old French saying, and new verse by Dennis Beerpint.
