  text: 'The only sound to tear the night comes from the man upstairs. His bloated
    belching figure stomps. He may crash through the ceiling soon. If he does so,
    the sound will cease. He will be lying on his back, on my carpet, covered in a
    film of dust and powder and debris. I will cast upon him a look of reproach, and
    poke him with the pointy stick I keep to hand for circumstances such as these.
    He may grunt, if still alive, or not, if dead.

    When I prod his neck, I will dislodge from around it a delicate silver chain to
    which is attached a medallion. It bears a depiction of a saint, identified by
    an inscription as Saint Agur. I will be tempted to kick the bloated belcher in
    the head, on account of his stupidity. Is he not aware that this so-called saint
    is but a figment of the marketing department of a French cheesemaking concern?
    Not for the first time, I will be driven crackers by the blithering ignorance
    of my neighbours. As Dylan observed, it''s a wonder that they still know how to
    breathe.

    The belcher from upstairs splayed on my carpet may or may not be breathing. But
    the sound of his stomping, mercifully done with, will now be replaced by the roaring
    of an idiot wind. Wild is the wind, and I hear the sound of mandolins. Can a man
    get no peace nor quiet in this damnable urbis? I will retreat to my kitchen for
    Phensic and marmalade. Somewhere I have a packet of twenty No. 6, but no light.
    I will rifle through the pockets of the bloated git on my carpet. I will give
    him a kicking as I do so.

    But he is not there. He did not, after all, crash through the ceiling. The stomping
    of his bloated belching figure remains the only sound. Until, at last, day breaks,
    and it is joined by twittering birdsong, and the clink and clank of the milkman
    on his morning rounds.

    Milkman, milkman, bring me curds and whey!

    No--there is nothing for you today.

    No milk, no whey, no curds nor cream.

    Go crash through the ceiling of your dream.
