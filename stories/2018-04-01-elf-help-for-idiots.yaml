  text: "After writing dozens and dozens of books, self-help guru \u201CDr.\u201D\
    \ Bruce Terrific has had an epiphany.\n\u201CIt was always my aim to write more\
    \ books than Tony Buzan,\u201D he said in an interview with Buzantastic News magazine,\
    \ \u201CAnd having achieved that goal, I felt it was time to strike off in a new\
    \ direction. It has also dawned on me that my self-help books serve only to increase\
    \ the navel-gazing narcissism of readers who can't see further than their own\
    \ petty and squalid lives. Christ almighty, isn't it high time people stopped\
    \ helping themselves and instead helped others?\n\u201CThat's why I am launching\
    \ a new series of elf-help books. For too long, elves, fairies, and laughing gnomes\
    \ have had to fend for themselves. Well, those days are over. From now on, my\
    \ readers are going to be instructed in the best ways to devote themselves to\
    \ the care and feeding of elves. Beat that, Tony Buzan!\u201D\nThe first book\
    \ in the series, Elf-Help For Idiots, explains how to darn an elf's pointy hat\
    \ when it becomes frayed."
