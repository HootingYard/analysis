  text: 'After writing dozens and dozens of books, self-help guru "Dr." Bruce Terrific
    has had an epiphany.

    "It was always my aim to write more books than Tony Buzan," he said in an interview
    with Buzantastic News magazine, "And having achieved that goal, I felt it was
    time to strike off in a new direction. It has also dawned on me that my self-help
    books serve only to increase the navel-gazing narcissism of readers who can''t
    see further than their own petty and squalid lives. Christ almighty, isn''t it
    high time people stopped helping themselves and instead helped others?

    "That''s why I am launching a new series of elf-help books. For too long, elves,
    fairies, and laughing gnomes have had to fend for themselves. Well, those days
    are over. From now on, my readers are going to be instructed in the best ways
    to devote themselves to the care and feeding of elves. Beat that, Tony Buzan!"

    The first book in the series, Elf-Help For Idiots, explains how to darn an elf''s
    pointy hat when it becomes frayed.'
