  text: 'From a reader''s letter in the current issue of Standpoint:

    Whenever I am feeling a little low I call to mind a Sunday morning 30-odd years
    ago waiting in a queue in a shop in Riberac, Dordogne. The gentleman at the head
    of the queue, wearing shorts and sandals with long white socks, bellowed at the
    lady behind the counter: "Je suis Sir William van Straubenzee, ou est mon Sunday
    Telegraph?"'
