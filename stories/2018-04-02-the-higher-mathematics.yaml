  text: "Dear Mr Key, writes Andy Martin, I recently read (or tried to read) a textbook\
    \ on recent developments in mathematics. Its pages are littered with sentences\
    \ and phrases which often sound as if they've been swiped from one of the earlier\
    \ pamphlets by that chap [Norman Davies] who wrote Further Science.\nMr Martin\
    \ then lists some of the inexplicable, yet curiously compelling, phrases he has\
    \ digested, all quoted verbatim from the text:\n\u2026degeneracy on a manifold\u2026\
    \n\u2026lemmas on ordinary differential operators with parameters\u2026\n\u2026\
    sharp regularity estimates for the solution of the oblique derivative problem\u2026\
    \n\u2026instability modes in Benard systems\u2026\n\u2026codimension-two bifurcations\u2026\
    \n\u2026the basic boundary value problems for operators with VMO coefficients\u2026\
    \n\u2026time dependent and time independent wave packet approaches to reactive\
    \ scattering\u2026\n\u2026laser excited wave packets in semiconductor heterostructures\u2026\
    \n\u2026Feshbach resonances and singular Hodge theory\u2026\n\u2026elliptic complexes\
    \ of pseudodifferential operators and to stratified media\u2026\n\u2026singular\
    \ interaction problems with distribution and hyperfunction data\u2026\n\u2026\
    polar materials without director symmetry\u2026\n\u2026the mechanical fragility\
    \ of smectic bookshelf structure\u2026\n\u2026quantum dot heterostructures\u2026\
    \n\u2026eigenoscillations in diffraction theory\u2026\n\u2026molecular integral\
    \ evaluation\u2026\n\u2026material tensors of ranks 2 to 7\u2026\n\u2026multiconfigurational\
    \ self-consistent fields and coupled clusters\u2026\n\u2026orientational aspects\
    \ in pair transfer and multichromophoric systems\u2026\n\u2026the Stokes parameters\
    \ in nonlinear media and self action polarisation phenomena\u2026\n\u2026canonical\
    \ quantization and stochastic wave functions\u2026\n\u2026quantum states of bosonic\
    \ systems\u2026\n\u2026phase space distribution functions and the density operator\u2026\
    \nAs a lover of books, adds Mr Martin, I assume you, too, are profoundly concerned\
    \ about the mechanical fragility of smectic bookshelf structure. Perhaps you've\
    \ already noticed it. I know I have."
