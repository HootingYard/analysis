  text: 'Oh look, shifting sands! If you stand quite still, and shut your eyes, and
    wait for, say, five minutes before opening them, when you do you will find yourself
    in an utterly different terrain. When you were not looking, the sands shifted,
    and now all is strange and bewildering.

    On the beach at Shifting, a lovely little seaside town in Hoonshire, it is common
    to see people standing stock still with their eyes shut. It is common, too, to
    see looks of disappointment, even devastation, cross their faces, when they open
    their eyes to find the beach unchanged from how it was five minutes before. This
    is because the sands at Shifting Sands are not shifting sands. They are what are
    known as inert sands, roughly speaking. What shifting occurs, occasioned by the
    wind and the tides, is slow and imperceptible.

    What they do have at Shifting Sands are perilous pockets of quicksand. Beware!
    Best not even to think about those pockets, for if you do, you will sink into
    the quicksand of your thought, and you won''t have the power anymore.'
