  text: "Old Farmer Frack! Old Farmer Frack!\n  What are you carrying in your sack?\n\
    I've half a dozen weasels in my sack,\nThree for Jill and three for Jack.\n  Are\
    \ you sure they're weasels and not stoats?\n  Or even little baby goats?\nNo,\
    \ they're weasels, of that I'm sure\nNow get in the barn and lock the door.\n\
    \  And Old Farmer Frack burns the barn to the ground\n  And swings his sack o\u2019\
    \ weasels round and round\n  Then he climbs up to the top of Polkadot Hill\n \
    \ And gives the sack o\u2019 weasels to Jack and Jill\nOh thank you, thank you,\
    \ Old Farmer Frack!\nWe've always wanted weasels in a sack!"
