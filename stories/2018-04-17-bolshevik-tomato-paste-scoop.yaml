  text: "I opened my briefcase and took from it my Bolshevik Tomato Paste Scoop. I\
    \ was so pleased with it. I had snapped it up on eBay, where it was going for\
    \ a song. The song I opted for was \u201CEssay On Pigs\u201D (1968) by Hans Werner\
    \ Henze. Strictly speaking, this is actually five separate songs, but I got away\
    \ with it. The Bolshevik Tomato Paste Scoop arrived in the post four days later.\
    \ I will be sure to take it with me, in my briefcase, on my forthcoming trip,\
    \ by hot air balloon, to the Lost City of Karencarpenter, far far away, beyond\
    \ the mountains of madness, where night-penguins fringe a yawning abyss."
