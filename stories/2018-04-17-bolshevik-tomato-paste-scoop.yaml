  text: I opened my briefcase and took from it my Bolshevik Tomato Paste Scoop. I
    was so pleased with it. I had snapped it up on eBay, where it was going for a
    song. The song I opted for was "Essay On Pigs" (1968) by Hans Werner Henze. Strictly
    speaking, this is actually five separate songs, but I got away with it. The Bolshevik
    Tomato Paste Scoop arrived in the post four days later. I will be sure to take
    it with me, in my briefcase, on my forthcoming trip, by hot air balloon, to the
    Lost City of Karencarpenter, far far away, beyond the mountains of madness, where
    night-penguins fringe a yawning abyss.
