  text: 'I am advised by our technical boffin that the maleficent imps wreaking havoc
    on this blog''s innards have now been removed, and all should be well. What that
    means is that I must stir my brain-broth and get cracking with further majestic
    paragraphs of sweeping prose to keep you lot on an even mental keel. And by the
    sinews of St Spivack, I shall!

    Meanwhile, should any of you spot any continuing problems with untoward online
    shenanigans here, please let me know in the comments.'
