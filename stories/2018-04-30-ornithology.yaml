  text: "Ornithology, when pursued recklessly, breaks bones. This aper\xE7u first\
    \ appeared in Dobson's pamphlet Oh! One Merry March Morning I Climbed A Tree The\
    \ Better To Investigate, At Close Quarters, The Nest Of A Wren And, Losing My\
    \ Footing, I Plunged To Earth, Landing Awkwardly And In So Doing Broke My Collarbone,\
    \ Subsequently, In Making My Report To The Triage Nurse, I Blamed The Wren, I\
    \ Blamed The Wren! (out of print).\nOf late, there has been something of a kerfuffle\
    \ in Dobsonist circles occasioned by the publication of a new monograph on the\
    \ pamphlet. Upstart young Scandinavian critic Knud Pantryboy argues, in his essay,\
    \ that there is not a jot of truth in the pamphleteer's hysterical prose. Controversially,\
    \ he suggests that Dobson was making a stab at writing a piece of fiction.\nDobson\
    \ never climbed a tree in his life, writes the hot-headed Dane, and he would certainly\
    \ have been unable to distinguish the nest of a wren from that of any other of\
    \ the approximately ten thousand, four hundred and four types of birds, many of\
    \ them extinct, which grace, or have graced, the blue skies of the ever-rotating\
    \ globe we call the Earth.\nPantryboy also makes the point that no evidence exists\
    \ to suggest Dobson's collarbone was ever broken. He dismisses as \u201Cobviously\
    \ fraudulent\u201D the pencil sketches, purportedly based on X-rays, which appeared\
    \ in the compendium Pencil Sketches Based On X-Rays Of The Bones Of Several Twentieth-Century\
    \ Writers compiled by the quack medical illustrator Tosh Quackpencil. The half-dozen\
    \ sketches of Dobson's collarbone each show signs of traumatic shattering, but\
    \ Pantryboy argues, persuasively, that the pictures were executed during a thunderstorm.\n\
    Why, though, would Dobson have risked his reputation by inventing this tale? While\
    \ admitting that he does not know the answer to this question, Knud Pantryboy\
    \ suggests that the narrative is a veiled reference to a singular episode in the\
    \ pamphleteer's childhood.\nThe \u201Ctree\u201D is a picnic blanket. The \u201C\
    wren's nest\u201D is a sausage-on-a-stick. The \u201Cplunge to earth\u201D is\
    \ a fit of hiccups. The \u201Ccollarbone\u201D is another sausage on another stick.\
    \ The \u201Ctriage nurse\u201D is International Woman of Mystery Primrose Dent.\
    \ I rest my case.\nIt is undoubtedly true that La Dent used to appear, uninvited,\
    \ at innumerable picnic spots throughout what Lumsden called \u201Cthat brittle,\
    \ squalid decade\u201D. True, too, that it was both brittle and squalid. And equally\
    \ true that Lumsden himself had his posthumous bones sketched, from X-rays, by\
    \ Tosh Quackpencil. Nor should we ever forget that wrens, when gathered in huge\
    \ numbers, can be extremely dangerous. Ornithology, when pursued recklessly, does\
    \ indeed break bones."
