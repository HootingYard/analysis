  text: 'Ornithology, when pursued recklessly, breaks bones. This apercu first appeared
    in Dobson''s pamphlet Oh! One Merry March Morning I Climbed A Tree The Better
    To Investigate, At Close Quarters, The Nest Of A Wren And, Losing My Footing,
    I Plunged To Earth, Landing Awkwardly And In So Doing Broke My Collarbone, Subsequently,
    In Making My Report To The Triage Nurse, I Blamed The Wren, I Blamed The Wren!
    (out of print).

    Of late, there has been something of a kerfuffle in Dobsonist circles occasioned
    by the publication of a new monograph on the pamphlet. Upstart young Scandinavian
    critic Knud Pantryboy argues, in his essay, that there is not a jot of truth in
    the pamphleteer''s hysterical prose. Controversially, he suggests that Dobson
    was making a stab at writing a piece of fiction.

    Dobson never climbed a tree in his life, writes the hot-headed Dane, and he would
    certainly have been unable to distinguish the nest of a wren from that of any
    other of the approximately ten thousand, four hundred and four types of birds,
    many of them extinct, which grace, or have graced, the blue skies of the ever-rotating
    globe we call the Earth.

    Pantryboy also makes the point that no evidence exists to suggest Dobson''s collarbone
    was ever broken. He dismisses as "obviously fraudulent" the pencil sketches, purportedly
    based on X-rays, which appeared in the compendium Pencil Sketches Based On X-Rays
    Of The Bones Of Several Twentieth-Century Writers compiled by the quack medical
    illustrator Tosh Quackpencil. The half-dozen sketches of Dobson''s collarbone
    each show signs of traumatic shattering, but Pantryboy argues, persuasively, that
    the pictures were executed during a thunderstorm.

    Why, though, would Dobson have risked his reputation by inventing this tale? While
    admitting that he does not know the answer to this question, Knud Pantryboy suggests
    that the narrative is a veiled reference to a singular episode in the pamphleteer''s
    childhood.

    The "tree" is a picnic blanket. The "wren''s nest" is a sausage-on-a-stick. The
    "plunge to earth" is a fit of hiccups. The "collarbone" is another sausage on
    another stick. The "triage nurse" is International Woman of Mystery Primrose Dent.
    I rest my case.

    It is undoubtedly true that La Dent used to appear, uninvited, at innumerable
    picnic spots throughout what Lumsden called "that brittle, squalid decade". True,
    too, that it was both brittle and squalid. And equally true that Lumsden himself
    had his posthumous bones sketched, from X-rays, by Tosh Quackpencil. Nor should
    we ever forget that wrens, when gathered in huge numbers, can be extremely dangerous.
    Ornithology, when pursued recklessly, does indeed break bones.'
