  text: "Lupe Node, the carrier, O is he dead then? My fruit-bowl all emptied. He\
    \ carried my fruit, Lupe Node, in his manly muscular hands, plums in punnets and\
    \ hawberries in hopkins. The sun battered him, as he sashayed from orchard to\
    \ pier, to my kiosk, this man o\u2019 fruit, Jesuitical in his furrow-browed beanstalk\
    \ bitterness. A man of few words, and those the names of fruits, names he made\
    \ up, embroidered, spat out like plum-stones, chewed like nettles, O Lupe Node,\
    \ forsaken by a God whose mercurial recklessness\u2014those divine spasms!\u2014\
    came twitching in rags and schmutter. Pips haunted him, Lupe Node, lodged in his\
    \ pocket-crannies, scattered in his locks, curly black and slathered in lac. Do\
    \ not taunt him now, in his grave, on his uppers, worm-lunch, bird-roost. They\
    \ named a pond for him. No fish thrive inwith it. And yet in memory of Lupe Node\
    \ I take my paper bag of baggings there each March morning sodden by rain and\
    \ stamped by yearning. Crumbs fall. Necks sag. Galoshes splosh."
