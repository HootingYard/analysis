text: "I am the squeamish vagabond\n  I swoon when I see blood\n  And I see blood\
  \ aplenty\n  As I trudge through slime and mud\n  As I roam from copse to spinney\n\
  \  I see corpses widely strewn\n  Of slaughtered tramps and vagrants\n  I fear I'll\
  \ join them soon\n  For I'm pursued by a violent foe\n  A fiend from the bottomless\
  \ pond\n  I tremble and piddle in my pants\n  I'm the squeamish vagabond"
