  text: "I am the squeamish vagabond\n  I swoon when I see blood\n  And I see blood\
    \ aplenty\n  As I trudge through slime and mud\n  As I roam from copse to spinney\n\
    \  I see corpses widely strewn\n  Of slaughtered tramps and vagrants\n  I fear\
    \ I'll join them soon\n  For I'm pursued by a violent foe\n  A fiend from the\
    \ bottomless pond\n  I tremble and piddle in my pants\n  I'm the squeamish vagabond"
