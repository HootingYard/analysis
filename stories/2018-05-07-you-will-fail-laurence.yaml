  text: "You Will Fail, Laurence is the title of a book which appeared to me in my\
    \ dreams last night. It was a children's book, written in very short, staccato\
    \ sentences, and lavishly illustrated with detailed, brightly-coloured drawings\u2014\
    in spite of the fact that Laurence spent much of his time enveloped in what my\
    \ dream insisted on calling \u201Cfog-storms\u201D.\nAn additional curiosity was\
    \ that I was looking at a facsimile of the book online, and the dream suggested\
    \ that the book itself did not exist, this digital version being a hoax perpetrated\
    \ by japesters for reasons which must remain unutterably mysterious."
