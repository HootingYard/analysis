  text: 'You Will Fail, Laurence is the title of a book which appeared to me in my
    dreams last night. It was a children''s book, written in very short, staccato
    sentences, and lavishly illustrated with detailed, brightly-coloured drawings--in
    spite of the fact that Laurence spent much of his time enveloped in what my dream
    insisted on calling "fog-storms".

    An additional curiosity was that I was looking at a facsimile of the book online,
    and the dream suggested that the book itself did not exist, this digital version
    being a hoax perpetrated by japesters for reasons which must remain unutterably
    mysterious.'
