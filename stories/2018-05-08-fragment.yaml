  text: Sick at heart and improperly trousered, the vicar galumphed across the fields
    towards the viaduct. Not for nothing was he known as the vicar of the viaduct.
    Air wafted about his head, tiny little flying insects perched ephemerally in his
    hair. He had his sermon all prepared, committed to memory, for the service of
    the blessing of the crutches. The sun blazed down. Brave Helios!
