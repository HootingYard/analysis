  text: "\u201CThe term \u2018nostalgia\u2019 was in fact dreamt up in 1688 by a doctor\
    \ called Johannes Hofer who was treating young Swiss mercenaries suffering from\
    \ a strange set of symptoms. They wouldn't eat, couldn't summon the will to live\
    \ and sometimes became dangerously ill with no apparent physical cause. They had\
    \ fainting fits, high fevers and indigestion. After talking to the young men,\
    \ Hofer realised they were simply ill for want of home. When he sent them back\
    \ to the mountains, they invariably recovered.\n\u201CEven earlier, Swiss soldiers\
    \ were said to be so susceptible to nostalgia when they heard a particular Swiss\
    \ milking song, \u2018Khue-Reyen\u2019, that its playing was punishable by death.\u201D\
