  text: 'Lonely, he made a companion of string and wood and tin, and sat her at his
    window, as if she were looking out. And whenever he returned from tiresome jaunts,
    she was there, framed in the window, to welcome him home.

    But when he was at home, she had her back turned to him. She was facing the outside
    world, immobile, yet desperate to go frolicking dizzily into that world, where
    other things of string and wood and tin were surely to be found.'
