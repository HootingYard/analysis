  text: "Renaissance\_: noun, from the French for \u201Crebirth\u201D. If you stumble\
    \ upon this word in the course of your reading, you need no longer scratch your\
    \ head in dimwitted befuddlement. Its primary definition is a reference to the\
    \ occasion, in early July in the Year of Our Lord MMXVIII, when the Hooting Yard\
    \ website, having been kaput for some while, came blazing back to life (hence,\
    \ rebirth) like a phoenix rising from the ashes. (If you want to know what a phoenix\
    \ is, you will have to wait for the \u201CP\u201D section of the Hooting Yard\
    \ Guide To Non-Existent Birds.)"
