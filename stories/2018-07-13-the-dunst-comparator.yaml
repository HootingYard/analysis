  text: 'This year''s foopball World Cup coincided with the Hooting Yard shutdown,
    which means I have neglected to keep you lot apprised of the choice witterings
    of commentators. Each time there is a big foopball tournament, we find ourselves
    wondering if one of the TV babblers will say anything to match that classic observation
    from 2010 : "For a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who''d just plopped
    out of the womb."

    My favourite moment from this year came early in the contest. Commenting on one
    of the Argentinian players, the BBC man said : "He''s five-foot-five, the same
    height as Kirsten Dunst. A dangerous little winger."

    Was he in possession of a chart matching the heights of foopballers to Hollywood
    stars? Or is a foopballer''s height relative to Kirsten Dunst a standard measure?
    These questions were never answered, more''s the pity.'
