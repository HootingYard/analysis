  text: 'From the archives, August 2012:

    I used to know a man who, like Sloppy in Our Mutual Friend, could do the Police
    in different voices. It began as a party trick, for which he always received thunderous
    rounds of applause, upon which he eventually became dependent. There came a time
    when he no longer used his normal speaking voice at all. He couched every single
    utterance in one of his different Police voices, but the novelty wore off, and
    people no longer clapped, and he grew sour and disillusioned and rancorous, and
    ended his days drunk to high heaven sprawled on the floor of a hotel lobby at
    a seaside resort. It is a cautionary tale, then, his life.

    But that ruinous end cannot dim the joy of his early forays into doing the Police
    in different voices. I remember as if it were yesterday the first time I came
    across him. I was attending a sophisticated cocktail party in a sophisticated
    house in a sophisticated part of town, and, being myself deeply and ineradicably
    unsophisticated, was having a rather hard time mingling. I was leaning against
    a mantelpiece, trying my best to look insouciant, but the only people who deigned
    to speak to me were those who challenged my very presence, accusing me of being
    some kind of valet or factotum or, worse, an interloper. I grew increasingly cantankerous,
    losing any sheen of sophistication I might have hoped to assume. I spat at people
    and pointedly ground out my cigarette butts on the expensive carpet. Across the
    room I saw a couple of genuine factotae approaching, huge burly monobrowed fellows,
    like minatory bears, bent, I supposed, on chucking me out into the street. Before
    they reached me, however, the hubbub of sophisticated chitchat suddenly ceased,
    and one voice was ringing out solo.

    "On the fifteenth inst at eight forty-six pee em I was proceeding along Letsby
    Avenue in a northerly direction when I spotted the accused taunting a kitten.
    I apprehended him in the course of this bestial enormity and--" and then, without
    missing a beat, he quoted that twit-and-jug bit from The Waste Land, "--Twit twit
    twit, Jug jug jug jug jug jug, So rudely forc''d, Tereu". Then he continued, in
    so deep and grave and sonorous a voice we might have been listening to T S Eliot
    himself, "And I dragged him down to the nick for a mild roughing-up by some of
    Inspector Cargpan''s boys." It was marvellous, and we all applauded, and my lack
    of sophistication was forgotten as all eyes turned to the owner of the voice.

    Or, as I learned soon enough, voices. A couple of weeks later I went to another
    sophisticated cocktail party. This time I took the precaution of wearing spats
    and a dressing gown, to give myself airs. I was leaning against a mantelpiece
    when once again, there was a hush and a single voice made itself heard:

    "On the sixteenth inst at six fourteen pee em I was proceeding along Letsby Avenue
    in a westerly direction when I spotted the accused engaged in a hate crime against
    a sparrow. No! Oo-er, missus. Really! Nay, nay and thrice may! Titter ye not!
    Oo-er. I dragged him down to the nick and handed him over to Inspector Cargpan''s
    boys for a roughing-up in the basement."

    It was extraordinary. There was no hint of T S Eliot. This time it was is if Frankie
    Howerd had come back to life. Again there was a round of applause. I left my mantelpiece
    and made my way across the room to congratulate the speaker personally, but before
    I could reach him he had flitted away, possibly with some of the silverware tucked
    in his pocket.

    Over the next few years, during my inveterate partygoing, I came upon the fellow,
    who I had dubbed "Sloppy" after his Dickensian inspiration, on numerous occasions.
    Every time I heard him he do the Police in different voices. Some of them were
    recognisable. As with his Eliot and Howerd, he could do pitch perfect impersonations
    of Enoch Powell and Bernard Levin, both Mike and Bernie Winters, and the Irish
    one-time hostage Brian Keenan. I even heard him do Yoko Ono. He had other voices
    which seemed to spring from his repertoire of invented characters, a chuckling
    Quaker, for example, and a breathless bike wanker. He never repeated himself.

    The last time I saw, or rather heard, Sloppy, was at a sophisticated cocktail
    party at an art gallery private view. I was leaning against a mantelpiece staring
    vacantly at a splattery daub when a voice rose above the arty babbling. And this
    time it was not a speaking voice. Sloppy was singing! Well, perhaps it would be
    more accurate to say he was caterwauling, in an ear-splitting high-pitched screech.
    I recognised that sound immediately, and did not need to wait for the words "Roxanne,
    you don''t have to put on the red light" to know he was doing the Police in the
    voice of Gordon Sumner.

    That, at least, was what I thought. But on my way home that night, through certain
    half-deserted streets, the muttering retreats of restless nights in one-night
    cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells, I picked up the Evening
    Rag, and reading it on the unsophisticated top deck of the unsophisticated bus
    which took me to my unsophisticated home, I read that the man I knew as Sloppy
    had been buried that day in a seaside resort graveyard, having died drunk to high
    heaven sprawled on the floor of a hotel lobby earlier in the week. I realised,
    with a shock, that the screeching caterwauler at the private view must have been
    Sumner himself, and I wept. I could connect Nothing with nothing. The broken finger-nails
    of dirty hands. My people humble people who expect Nothing.
