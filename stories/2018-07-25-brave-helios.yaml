  text: My apologies for the recent lack of potsages [sic] here at the Yard of Hooting.
    This has been occasioned my my inability to cope--either mentally or physically--with
    the damnable weather. Whatever happened to "overcast, with drizzle"? Instrad,
    I am battered and blinded by the sun--or, as the Moody Blues liked to call it,
    Brave Helios! Well, Brave Helios is an accur'd orb I would happily see blotted
    out, or wholly extinguished. I shall pray for rain, or, better, a howling blizzard,,
    and resume tippy-tapping when I am able.
  title: Brave Helios!
