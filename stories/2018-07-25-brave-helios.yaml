  text: "My apologies for the recent lack of potsages [sic] here at the Yard of Hooting.\
    \ This has been occasioned my my inability to cope\u2014either mentally or physically\u2014\
    with the damnable weather. Whatever happened to \u201Covercast, with drizzle\u201D\
    ? Instrad, I am battered and blinded by the sun\u2014or, as the Moody Blues liked\
    \ to call it, Brave Helios! Well, Brave Helios is an accur'd orb I would happily\
    \ see blotted out, or wholly extinguished. I shall pray for rain, or, better,\
    \ a howling blizzard,, and resume tippy-tapping when I am able."
