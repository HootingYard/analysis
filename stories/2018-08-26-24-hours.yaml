    Bank Holiday Monday, 27 August : 12:00am--11:59pm.

    Twenty four hours in the company of Frank Key, writer in residence and creator
    of Resonance''s longest running programme, Hooting Yard on the Air. Comprising
    a selection of programmes from the very first in April 2004 to the present day.

    It has been an eerily quiet summer here at Hooting Yard, what with one ting and
    an udder (as my mother used to say). I hope to return to the land of the living
    soon.'
