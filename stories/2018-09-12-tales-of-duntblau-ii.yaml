  text: "I was born in Duntblau, above the wool shop, at the beginning of our night\
    \ that lasts for half a year. The alignment of the stars in the sky over Duntblau\
    \ did not augur well. Shortly after my birth, the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman paid her\
    \ visit, creaking up the fire escape to my parents\u2019 flat above the wool shop.\
    \ She cast her twigs and pebbles upon the floor, and descried signs in the steam\
    \ rising from her bowl of boiling ducks\u2019 blood. She announced that, though\
    \ I was not exactly a curs\xE8d child, still, I was a tot inwardly hobbled, morally\
    \ and comprehensively. There was no force in the universe that could ever come\
    \ to my aid. Mama poured the ducks\u2019 blood down the drain while Papa paid\
    \ the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman her stipend. As she creaked away down the fire escape,\
    \ my infant wailing woke every sleeping soul in Duntblau.\nThree decades and three\
    \ more years passed, with little or nothing of remark, until one day Papa called\
    \ me down to the back room of the wool shop.\n\u201CShambeko,\u201D he said, \u201C\
    You have now reached the age Christ Jesus was when he was so cruelly nailed to\
    \ his cross. It is time you left Duntblau, to make your way in the world.\u201D\
    \nI begged Papa to allow me to postpone my leaving for six months, when there\
    \ would be daylight, but his mind was made up. I was to quit the wool shop immediately,\
    \ and Duntblau as soon as possible thereafter. As I minced out of the door, Mama\
    \ handed me a snack and a bag of whatnots.\nWhen I was out of sight of the wool\
    \ shop, I collapsed on to the pavement and ate my snack, a fish-paste whirl and\
    \ a plum. Then I rummaged through the whatnots in the bag, but my fingers were\
    \ sticky, so I tipped the contents on to the pavement the better to grasp their\
    \ quiddities. Suddenly dozens of birds swooped from the Duntblau sky, grabbing\
    \ the whatnots in their beaks, and soaring away, up, up, until they vanished into\
    \ the black starless night.\nAfter a while I rose to my feet and continued along\
    \ the street, or rather, boulevard. This was one of the main thoroughfares of\
    \ central Duntblau, and was named after Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich,\
    \ huge cement statues of whom stood, upon tawdry plinths, at intervals from east\
    \ to west. It so happened that, a couple of schtapps past the Beaky statue, where\
    \ I had snacked and had my whatnots abstracted by birds, there was an alleyway\
    \ leading off the boulevard to the left, and down this alleyway was the kiosk\
    \ of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman. I was minded to go and have a word with her, but\
    \ just as I was readying my legs to make the required turn, I was set upon by\
    \ an assailant.\nIt was not the first time in my thirty-three years to heaven\
    \ that I felt the bash of a bludgeon on my bonce. Violence stalks Duntblau in\
    \ the long night. But I had never before been knocked unconscious for such a protracted\
    \ period of time. When I came to, sprawled in the gutter, I heard the toots and\
    \ bangs and bellowing of improvised oompah band music, and saw the massed papier-m\xE2\
    ch\xE9 puppets of Duntblau noteworthies being carried aloft. It was the Saint\
    \ Bibblybibdib's Day Parade! I must have been lying in the gutter for a fortnight!\n\
    I knew Papa would expect me to be a lot further away by now, possibly gone from\
    \ Duntblau entirely. I knew, too, that he was likely to have employed the private\
    \ detectives Perkins & Throwback to scour the streets for any sign of me. He was\
    \ that kind of Papa\u2014rigorous, righteous, mad. I had to make myself scarce.\n\
    I scuttled off down an alleyway. It was a different alleyway to the one where\
    \ the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman had her kiosk, but there is that old saying in Duntblau\
    \ \u201CAll alleyways [something something] / But [something] a ha'porth for a\
    \ kiosk\u201D. Above me the shroud of night lay heavy upon the souls of embittered\
    \ men and their wan, pale wives. The alleyway was scattered with dustbins and\
    \ corrugated cardboard and dead or dying kittens. A dribbling sot lurked in a\
    \ doorway, shaking his fist at nothing. I pulled up my collar as I passed him\
    \ by. How does that song go?\nI pulled up my collar as I passed him by,\nLittle\
    \ suspecting he was a private eye,\nEither Perkins or Throwback, hired by my dad.\n\
    The end of this story is going to be sad.\nThe end of this story is going to be\
    \ sad. No longer feigning sottishness and the dribbling that accompanies it, Perkins,\
    \ or it might have been Throwback, grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled a sack\
    \ over my head. I was overcome by the pong of bladderwrack. The private eye prodded\
    \ me in the back and told me to start walking. So, sightless, I walked, or tottered,\
    \ Perkins or Throwback guiding me like a dog.\nAlso like a dog, indeed so much\
    \ like a dog that it actually was a dog, was a dog that started trotting alongside\
    \ us after we had been walking for, oh, I don't know, call it a few miles. At\
    \ some point we began to go uphill, at a steeper and steeper gradient. I was panting.\
    \ The dog was yapping. Perkins or Throwback seemed tireless, humming a varied\
    \ selection of tunes by Rodgers & Hammerstein, Rodgers & Hart, Leiber & Stoller,\
    \ Brecht & Eisler, Ashford & Simpson, Flanders & Swann, Goffin & King, and Holland,\
    \ Dozier, Holland, Dozier, Dozier, Holland, Holland, Dozier, Holland, Dozier,\
    \ Dozier, Holland.\nEventually, we stopped. The private eye muttered something\
    \ menacing, and I heard him trudging away. When I thought it safe to do so, I\
    \ pulled the sack off my head and looked around. We were high up in an important\
    \ mountain range, muffled by snow, and ice, and a thick, swirling, freezing mist,\
    \ a white nothingness. The dog had stopped yapping and was gazing up at me adoringly.\n\
    \u201CToto,\u201D I said, \u201D I've a feeling we're not in Duntblau anymore.\u201D"
