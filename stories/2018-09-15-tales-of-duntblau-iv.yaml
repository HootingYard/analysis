  text: 'Nimrod Im Duntblau is an opera by Horst Gack, the contemporary composer famed
    for his startling bouffant, ill temper, and near-fatal coughing fits. It is both
    unfinished and unperformed. Several extracts have been recorded, at gunpoint,
    by the Loopy Von Straubenzee Jug Band accompanied by one-time popstrels Ingmar
    & Hetty, the so-called "terrifying singing twins". Horst Gack himself pointed
    the gun.

    In Act One, Scene One, Nimrod arrives in Duntblau. The "mighty hunter before the
    Lord" is, appropriately, on a hunting expedition. He sings that he has heard much
    about the fabled Chicken of Duntblau, which he means to hunt down, pinion, and
    strangle with his bare hands.

    He is overheard by Schwindi, the Duntblau Postmistress, who is hiding behind an
    arras. When Nimrod exits, she appears and sings the plaintive ballad "Must we
    swim yet again in the blood of chickens?"

    Horst Gack has yet to write scenes two and three, but in Act One, Scene Four we
    find Nimrod, alone in the graveyard of St Bibblybibdib''s church, leaning insouciantly
    against a tombstone, smoking a fag, and muttering to himself. Because the muttering
    is punctuated by occasional thumps of a kettledrum, Horst Gack counts this as
    an arietta.

    The only other scene yet completed is Act Seven, Scene Forty-Two. Schwindi is
    standing outside the Duntblau Chicken Sanctuary, holding a placard and singing
    a dirge. Critics have been sharply divided over this lengthy number. In the Macclesfield
    Tomato Sellers'' Weekly, Trilby Baxter dubbed it "a dire dirge, the direst dirge
    I ever heard". (This sentence was abstracted by Dennis Beerpint, who used it as
    the first line of one of his twee verses, where "heard" is rhymed with "bird",
    "curd", "furred", "bird" again, and "erred".)

    On the other hand, writing in the journal Dirges By Gack, Giles Pipstraw commended
    the piece as "possibly the most magnificent dirge moaned by a postmistress holding
    a placard outside Duntblau Chicken Sanctuary ever committed to sheet music by
    your friend and mine, Horst Gack!" (The overexcited Pipstraw in fact added nine
    more exclamation marks, which I have omitted for reasons of space.)

    Other critics have ignored the dirge entirely, waiting, some would say wisely,
    for the opera to be finished before they pronounce upon it.

    CDs of the recorded extracts can be obtained at jumble sales, charity shops, and
    as part of the contents of a jamboree bag available from spivs lurking in insalubrious
    alleyways in certain ill-starred seaside resorts, but not in Duntblau.

    Ingmar & Hetty are currently on tour with their "Eighty Years In Showbiz And Contemporary
    German Opera" special extravaganza.'
