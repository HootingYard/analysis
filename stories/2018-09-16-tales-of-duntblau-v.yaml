  text: "Immediately adjacent to the Duntblau Wool Shop, on the main shopping parade,\
    \ is the Duntblau Nougat Parlour. This is the chief source of nougat, not only\
    \ in Duntblau, but for miles around.\nThe proprietor of the Nougat Parlour is\
    \ a fellow called Jukka-Pekka [Illegible], who can best be described as a \u201C\
    capsized man\u201D. That is how he was referred to in the most authoritative book\
    \ on the subject, Pen-Portraits Of The Proprietors Of The Duntblau Nougat Parlour,\
    \ From Its Foundation In 1882 To The Present Day.\nThe illegibility of his surname\
    \ is but one, telling, sign of his capsized nature. Add to that the fact that\
    \ he is often to be found upside down and soaking wet, even when behind the counter\
    \ selling nougat to the more confectionery-bedazzled citizens of Duntblau.\nHis\
    \ history is curious, if shadowy. It is also dark, sweeping, flinty, error-strewn,\
    \ piquant, lode-bearing, toffee-nosed, hip, hep, and hapless. Some claim it is\
    \ tacky. Whichever words are used to describe his history, they pale in comparison\
    \ to the pencil-drawings and diagrams which often accompany them. Many, if not\
    \ most of these were executed at a single marathon session by Duntblau's civic\
    \ penciliste, Maisie Binns.\nMaisie Binns herself is a woman without a history.\n\
    \u201COne day she was just there,\u201D reported the town blabbermouth, \u201C\
    Sitting on a chair near the shopping parade, scribbling in her sketchpad with\
    \ a pencil. It was as if she had simply dropped from heaven. The pencil whizzed\
    \ over the paper, she turned out drawings and diagrams with a felicity that can\
    \ only be marvelled at. She was there, and then, just as suddenly, pfft!, she\
    \ was gone. They say we shall not see her like again, but this is incorrect, as\
    \ a second penciliste will be appearing shortly, God willing, if my prayers have\
    \ been answered. And why should they not be?\u201D\nThere is something dismal\
    \ about Duntblau once one wanders far from the shopping parade. Any sense of civic\
    \ oomph is dispelled the further away one is from wool and nougat. But I suppose\
    \ the same could be said of virtually any cluster of buildings, any human settlement,\
    \ in any of the districts of any of the regions in any of the countries in any\
    \ of the continents on any of the planets in any of the solar systems.\nIt cannot\
    \ be said of the seas. The seas are very different from the lands. The seas are\
    \ soaking wet, and riddled with fish, and cephalopods, and huge aquatic monsters\
    \ which suddenly crash to the surface and overturn our puny human boats, capsizing\
    \ them, and all who sail in them."
