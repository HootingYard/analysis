  text: 'I have maintained a list of every book I''ve read since 1982. (I did once
    have an earlier list, stretching back to the mid-seventies, but this was irretrievably
    lost at some point, and my memory is not good enough to recreate it.) I thought
    it would be a fine thing to create a gallery of the covers of these many, many
    books, where possible showing the edition I read--not always possible when I borrowed
    the book from a library. Here is a first stab at the project, showing the first
    six books I read in 1982. The next half-dozen will appear tomorrow.
