  text: The latest episode of the recently-resurrected Drabblecast is devoted to Mr
    Key. It includes Norm Sherman's magnificent reading of the exciting sci-fi story
    "Far, Far Away". If you have not previously heard Norm intone the words "magnetic
    mute blind love monkeys", you are in for a rare treat. If you have heard him,
    you will know that there are few instances in the history of recorded sound that
    are quite so unforgettable.
