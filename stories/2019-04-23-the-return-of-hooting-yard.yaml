  text: 'Midway through our thrilling milk-based calendar, back in December, the Hooting
    Yard website went kaput. Boffins worked tirelessly to repair whatever damage had
    wrecked the innards, and I think it is now germ-free at last.

    Unfortunately, at around the same time, Mr Key himself went kaput. There was general
    physical debility, catastrophic problems with my eyesight--still pitiable in spite
    of ongoing injections of a needle directly into my eyeballs--and, I am afraid
    to say, a brain which came to resemble an empty vacant void or vacuum, in which
    nothing stirred.

    In the meantime, I celebrated my sixtieth birthday. I cannot simply sprawl around
    peering vaguely at misty shimmerings and dribbling into a tin cup. No! I must
    crack away at that damned keyboard again, however slowly and fitfully, and try
    to unleash further sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose!

    It''s all a bit of a palaver, with ludicrously magnified screens and hit-and-miss
    typing--not to mention a compulsive desire to take a long snooze - but I shall
    do my best to revivify your favourite website.'
