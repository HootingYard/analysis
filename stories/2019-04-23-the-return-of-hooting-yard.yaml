  text: "Midway through our thrilling milk-based calendar, back in December, the Hooting\
    \ Yard website went kaput. Boffins worked tirelessly to repair whatever damage\
    \ had wrecked the innards, and I think it is now germ-free at last.\nUnfortunately,\
    \ at around the same time, Mr Key himself went kaput. There was general physical\
    \ debility, catastrophic problems with my eyesight\u2014still pitiable in spite\
    \ of ongoing injections of a needle directly into my eyeballs\u2014and, I am afraid\
    \ to say, a brain which came to resemble an empty vacant void or vacuum, in which\
    \ nothing stirred.\nIn the meantime, I celebrated my sixtieth birthday. I cannot\
    \ simply sprawl around peering vaguely at misty shimmerings and dribbling into\
    \ a tin cup. No! I must crack away at that damned keyboard again, however slowly\
    \ and fitfully, and try to unleash further sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose!\n\
    It's all a bit of a palaver, with ludicrously magnified screens and hit-and-miss\
    \ typing\u2014not to mention a compulsive desire to take a long snooze \u2013\
    \ but I shall do my best to revivify your favourite website."
