  text: "One consequence of my hopeless eyesight is that, over the past couple of\
    \ years, reading has become somewhat difficult. Even armed with industrial-strength\
    \ magnifying spectacles, issued by my eye doctors, it is a strain to read standard\
    \ size type.\nI have always loved books as physical objects, and eschewed their\
    \ digital, electronic counterparts. But having been given a Kindle Fire tablet\
    \ as a birthday gift, I have become\u2014of necessity\u2014a convert to the e-book.\
    \ I can read again, voraciously, without having to peer like a little mole.\n\
    Thus, in the last few months, I've been splurging, my reading life as demented\
    \ and enthusiastic as ever it was. I've reread Beckett (Molloy) and Kafka (America),\
    \ Henry Fielding and Mickey Spillane, read Theodore Dalrymple's marvellous book\
    \ on litter (Litter\_: The Remains Of Our Culture), Melanie Phillips\u2019 memoir\
    \ Guardian Angel, Francis Iles, Derek Raymond, and James Hadley Chase, H P Lovecaft,\
    \ William Hazlitt, and Sir Thomas Browne, and am currently bingeing on Georges\
    \ Simenon. What a wonder he is."
