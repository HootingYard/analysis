  text: "In the early 1960s, my paternal grandmother went mad and was carted off to\
    \ a Mercy Home for the Baffled and Bewildered. It was run by an order called the\
    \ Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, and my grandmother spent her final decade\
    \ contented and happy. Surrounded by nuns, she perhaps believed that she had realised\
    \ a lifelong ambition, and become a nun herself. The home, in Lytham St Annes,\
    \ was\u2014still is\u2014called Stella Matutina.\n\n\n\ncirca 1935: A milkman\
    \ chats with a father holding a baby, as he leaves the daily quota of milk on\
    \ the doorstep. (Photo by Fox Photos/Getty Images)\nMore than half a century later,\
    \ at the beginning of last year, my brother acquired a dog. It was the first time\
    \ he had ever had a pet pooch and, by all accounts, possession of the dog \u201C\
    changed his life\u201D. The name he gave to this dog was Stella Matutina.\nI find\
    \ this psychologically fascinating. It would be intriguing to plumb the depths\
    \ of my brother's psyche in relation to dogs and mad grandmothers and nuns. As\
    \ the psychiatrist remarked in Fawlty Towers, \u201Cthere's enough material there\
    \ for an entire conference\u201D."
