  text: "In the current transgender hoo-hah, the implications for women's sport have\
    \ prompted much controversy. If big burly blokes who \u201Cidentify as\u201D women,\
    \ like \u201CDr\u201D Rhys/Rachel McKinnon, are allowed to compete in women's\
    \ events, what are the odds that, given their physical advantage, they will start\
    \ winning everything? There are already enough instances of this happening to\
    \ make women's prospects seem bleak.\nIt so happens that the future of women's\
    \ sport was televised almost half a century ago, on Monty Python's Flying Circus.\
    \ In his fight against Petula Wilcox, boxer Ken Clean-Air System is not explicitly\
    \ identified as trans, but of course those were far less enlightened times.\n\
