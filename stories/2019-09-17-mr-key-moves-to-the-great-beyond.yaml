  text: 'A post from Pansy Cradledew

    Dear visitors to the Yard,

    For those of you who may not yet be aware of the tragic news, I am sorry to report
    that Mr Key left this world for The Great Beyond late last week. I do not know
    what he may find there but, however implausible, I am fairly certain that it would
    a) amuse him and b) he would find a way to write about it if he could.

    Though those of us left behind may feel bereft for quite some time, we can take
    some small comfort in the many pages of prose he left for us here on the site
    and the hours upon hours of blathering available at Hooting Yard on the Air, courtesy
    of Resonance FM.

    It is hoped that an exhibition of Frank Key rarities, scarcities and snippets
    may be mounted in London at some time in the near future, along with a reception
    to allow his devoted fans a chance to celebrate the time we had with him.

    Should you wish to support us monetarily in this latest endeavour, please consider
    donating to his JustGiving page or sending your hard-earned cash to the radio
    station that was his spiritual home for so many years.

    Yours in sadness and with a zest for crumpled things,

    Pansy'
