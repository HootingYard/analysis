  text: 'This story is Hooting Yard fan fiction by Tristan Shuddery:

    Dobson was prone to listlessness. Lacking inspiration he would generally eschew
    his escritoire and visit sawdust-strewn dockside taverns. When these moods took
    him, he could be found swilling stale grog and exchanging apocryphal nautical
    tales with peg-legged sea dogs.

    Indeed it was under such circumstances, in the arctic port of Murmansk that Marigold
    Chew once-again located Dobson, and bade him translocate to climes more pleasant.

    Why then did he choose a milk-processing factory as his next home? It is clear
    that Dobson found this locale arresting, however our sources do not state what
    caused his infatuation with this dilapidated industrial building on the frozen
    shores of Lake Winnipeg.

    Dobson''s surviving work from that period provides few clues. On his arrival he
    began work on an incomplete series of outre ornithological tracts describing such
    topics the nesting, mating and flight patterns of mythical, hypothetical and imaginary
    pond-fowl.

    Growing weary of all things feathered his later "factory works" were obscure ontological
    and theological essays. Fragments of a treatise comparing the theories of "Trebizondo
    Cullpepper" with those of "Goon-Fang" and "Tundism" suggest that Dobson''s mood
    was becoming more introspective than usual.

    None of these texts provide any clues as to the purpose for Dobson''s seclusion.
    Even the hellishly rigorous Concordance Dobsonia merely umms and ahhs around these
    most perplexing issues. It is likely that our sorry state of ignorance would have
    persisted were it not for a single remarkable discovery made on the eve of St.
    Bibania''s Feast five years ago.

    A weed-festooned pod was dredged from the tidal basin of the Great Frightening
    River. It was taken to the institute for the study of uncanny pods, part of the
    University at or near Ack where Professors Bindweed and Tadaaki stripped it of
    its maritime encrustations.

    The professors'' pointy tungsten tweezers removed barnacles and kelp, eventually
    revealing a glimmering metallic lozenge-shaped pod. Further studies revealed that
    the container was made from an alloy of tin and zinc with gaskets of gutta-percha.
    On what the professors assumed to be it''s front could be observed an heraldic
    device: A plummeting cormorant, traced in cerulean bip.

    Such was the quality of this pod''s construction, the pod-scientists opined that
    it could have withstood the lashings of the Frightening River for another hundred-year
    before succumbing to it''s icy waters. It was sealed with monstrous welds, and
    required the combined might of the village wrestling team to rent it asunder.
    Finally the uncanny pod''s contents were exposed.

    It contained a single burlap gunnysack, which in turn held a collection of scrawlings
    knick-knacks and bitty-bobs; The professors had discovered a trove of original
    Dobsonia:

    They found unsent letters to legendary luminaries, unaccepted invitations to campanology
    conventions, incomprehensible drafts of unpublished pamphlets, empty phials gak
    and goop. More importantly they discovered answers to all pertinent questions
    about Dobson''s lonely vigil in a milk-evaporation plant on the Western shore
    of Lake Winnipeg:

    Questions such as:

    What eerie phosphorescence lured Dobson to his industrial retreat? How did he
    write with nought but a Tilley-Lamp to illuminate his scribbling? From which spigot
    did he eek sustenance over the long frostbitten nights? Why then did he need to
    steal evaporated milk cans and what possessed him to weld them into a pod? From
    whence did he obtain his welding gear? What possessed him to take his few remaining
    possessions and seal them in that pod, and how did that pod having been sealed
    come to be sunk beneath the treacherous waves of the Great Frightening River,
    the river upon which I plied my trade as the dredge-meister all those years ago?

    I now know all of the answers to these questions, plus many more which would no
    doubt befuddle your puny mind were I even to pose them. If you were to glimpse
    but once at the Dobson trove (which has been entrusted to me as curator), all
    this and more would be made plain.

    But you shall never see the treasures of which I speak. They are interred within
    the locked display cabinet in the basement of the museum at (or near) the Gruesome
    Copse at Ack. The museum will be forever closed and barred to you, for you are
    a land-lubber and have been judged unworthy of it''s secrets.

    Be Gone!'
