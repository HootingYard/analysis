    This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is a special
    edition of hooting yard on the air. Gilbert white 1722 1793 was a country clergyman
    for many years the curative Selborne in Hampshire. He was also one of England''s
    first and greatest nature writers. His book the natural history and antiquities
    of Selborne was published in 1789. And there''s never been out of print. Incidentally,
    he had a great nephew who, when an infant was known as the learned pig. In 1946,
    Sylvia Townsend Warner published a book called the portrayal of a tortoise she
    extracted from Gilbert watch journals. All the references to Timothy, a tortoise
    belonging to whites aren''t which upon her death, he brought a Selborne. I''m
    going to read it to you now, beginning with Sylvia Townsend Warner''s brief preparatory
    note the portrait of a tortoise. In piecing together these extracts from the journals,
    I have allowed myself to include some passages which do not directly refer to
    Timothy. Sometimes there''s a perceptible good reason for such inclusions. Whether
    for instance, means a great deal to a taught us. So swallows in their kind mean
    nothing to it taught us, they meant a great deal to the journalist, lovers of
    Gilbert White will allow me to swallows and such entries as that for March the
    26th 1789 would show his faithful observation of nature and his power, like that
    of some Chinese artist of conveying a whole landscape with a few strokes. But
    in a few inclusions, such as the astonished bantams and the concatenation in a
    naturalist''s mind of the fertility of the polyamorous and of the white family,
    I''ve just given way to personal liking. readers who know the journals will be
    astonished at my moderation. 1771 November the first this is smoothly tortoise
    begins to scrape an hole in the ground in order for laying up November the second,
    Mrs. snoops tortoise begins to dig in order to hide himself for the winter, the
    veil of bramber and the river enveloped in a vast fog. The downs were clear. November
    the 10th tortoise comes out in the sun about noon, but soon returns day''s work
    of digging a hole to retire into. November the 15th taught us at ringmer had not
    finished his hibernacula being interrupted by the sunny weather which tempted
    him out 1772 May the 22nd tortoise eats flycatcher appears and bills. May the
    23rd the ringmer tortoise came forth it''s from its hibernacula them on the sixth
    of April, but did not appear to eat till May the fifth it does not eat but on
    hot days, as far as I could find it has no perceptible pulse made the 30th taught
    us each all day. In Mrs. snoops ponds are vast spiders, which dive and conceal
    themselves on the underside of plant lying on the water, perhaps RNA or aquatic
    ilyn or in a Toria the swallow seems to be the only bird which washes itself as
    it flies by dropping into the water. 1773 December the second the tortoise in
    Mrs. snoops garden, went underground November the 21st came out on the 30th for
    one day and retired to the same hole lies in a wet border in mud and mire with
    its back bear. December the 17th Mrs. Snoop taught us after it had been buried
    more than a month came forth and wandered around the garden in a disconsolate
    state, not knowing where to fix on a spot rich retreat. 1775 March the 21st Mrs.
    snoops old tortoise came out of the ground, but in a few days buried himself as
    deep as ever. April the 17th Mrs. Snoop totters came out of the ground, the second
    for the summer,




    Unknown Speaker  05:03


    August the seventh Timothy Mrs. snoops old tortoise has been kept for 30 years
    in the court before the house weighs six pounds three quarters and one ounce.
    It was never weighed before but seems to be much grown since it came 1776 August
    the 20th Timothy the tortoise weighs just six pounds three quarters and two ounces
    and a half so is increased in weight since August 1775. Just one ounce and and
    half August the 28th. The tortoise eats voraciously, is particularly fond of kidney
    beans. Vast halo around the moon. November the 20th. Mrs. snoops old taught us
    that ringmer went underground 1777 March the 26th and 27th to salt three days
    Mrs. snoops tortoise came forth out of the ground, but retired again to it hibernacula
    in a day or two, and did not appear anymore for near a fortnight. swallows appeared
    also on the same days and withdrew again, a strong proof this of their hiding.
    September the 11th. Mrs. snoops taught us devours kidney beans and cucumbers in
    a most voracious manner swallows its food almost whole footnote Timothy the tortoise
    weighed six pounds, three quarters and two ounces and a half. So he''s not at
    all increased in weight since this time last year. The scales were not very exact.
    1778 October 2 Timothy the old tortoise weighed six pounds and 11 ounces of urge
    up to 1779 October the 23rd Timothy the old tortoise at this house weighs six
    pounds nine ounces and then half averred up ah it weighed last year, October the
    second an ounce and a half more. But perhaps the abstemious life that it lives
    at this season may have reduced its bulk for tortoises seem to eat nothing for
    some weeks before they lay up. However, this inquiry shows that these reptiles
    do not as some have imagined continue to grow as long as they live. This poor
    being has been very torpid for some time, but it does not usually retire underground
    to the beginning of next month. November the 25th. Mrs. snoops old tortoise retired
    under the ground, November the 28th. The ground is glutted with water 17 at March
    the sixth skylarks mount and seeing March the eighth Mrs. snook died aged 86 March
    the 14th chaffinches sing but in a shorter way than enhance March the 15th. Mrs.
    Snoke was buried. March the 17th brought away Mrs. snoops old taught us Timothy,
    which she valued much and had treated kindly for near 40 years. When dug out of
    its hibernacula. It resented the insult by hissing March the 20th. We took the
    tortoise out of its box and buried it in the garden. But the weather being warm
    it heaved up the mold and walked twice down to the bottom of the longboard to
    survey the premises. March the 21st. The tortoise is quite awake and came out
    all day long. Towards the evening it buried itself in part. March the 25th, sowed
    carrots parsnips, planted potatoes, ground works well taught us sleeps. March
    the 28th. The tortoise put out his head this morning, March the 30th taught us
    keeps close. April 5, the frost enjoyed the bloom of the warm trees covered the
    bloom with boughs of Ivy. April the seventh talks us keep still in its hole. April
    the 15th cucumber swell taught us sleeps on radishes are drawn. April the 21st.
    The tortoise heaves up the earth and puts out its head. April the 22nd tortoise
    comes forth and walks around his coop will not eat lettuce yet goes to sleep at
    four o''clock pm. May the second taught us marches about each part of a cucumber
    pairing




    Unknown Speaker  09:59


    maze 10th stormy all night taught us scarce moves during this wet time. May the
    11th taught us moves about but does not feed yet. May the 13th after a fast of
    seven or eight months, the tortoise which in October 17 79 weighed six pounds
    nine ounces and a half of the world up Ah, why is now only six pounds four ounces.
    Timothy begins to break his fast May the 17th on the globe thistle and American
    Willow herb. His favorite food is lettuce and dandy line cucumber and kidney beans
    May the 27th Timothy the tortoise possesses a much greater share of discernment
    than I was aware of, and is much too wise to go into well well, for when he arrives
    at the haha he distinguishes the fall of the ground and retires with caution or
    marches carefully along the edge. He delights in crawling up the flower bank and
    walking along it verge made the 29th the tortoise shank the heat, it was so intense.
    June the first distant clouds sultry thunderclouds. sulfurous Melania, sweet even
    small shower, strawberries blow well medlow shows much bloom honeysuckles blow
    Fern out chatter true worm jars. The tortoise shines the intense heat by covering
    itself with dead grass and does not eat till the afternoon. June the fifth tortoise
    does not move, chew lips fade, cinnamon roses below. July the first, the red valerians
    roses, irises corn flags, honeysuckles lilies etc. Make a gallon show most of
    the Pink''s were destroyed in the winter by the hairs. We put Timothy in a tub
    of water, and found that he sunk gradually and walked on the bottom of the tub.
    He seemed quite out of his element and was much dismayed. This species seems not
    at all amphibious. Timothy seems to be the testudo graeca of Linnaeus. Dr. Chandler
    who saw the operation says there''s a species of tortoise in the Levant, that
    times frequent ponds and lakes, and my brother john white affirms the same of
    assault in Andalou sia July the third, the tortoise weighs six pounds and three
    quarters of Urdu power, six pounds 12 ounces. July the eighth, the excrement of
    the tortoise is hard and solid, but when that creature urines, as it often does
    plentifully, it voids after the water a soft white matter, much like the dung
    of birds of prey, which dries away into a sort of chalk like substance. July the
    10th Timothy eats voraciously, but picks out the hearts and stems of cost letters
    holding the outer leaves back with his feet. July the 24th taught us eats and
    Ivan poppies. July the 27th taught us each gooseberries. August the 12th dust
    flies garden suffer for amount of rain, much wheat bound Timothy in the beginning
    of May, after fasting all the winter weighed only six pounds and four ounces is
    now increased to six pounds and 15 ounces. August the 22nd Timothy is sluggish
    and scarce moves September the 10th. The motions of Timothy''s are taught us are
    much circumscribed. He has taken to the border under the fruit wall and makes
    very short excursions. He sleeps under a marvel of Peru. September the 12th. Timothy
    still feeds a little September the seventh, when we call loudly through the speaking
    trumpet to Timothy, he does not seem to regard the noise. September the 18th Timothy
    eats heartily October the third now ring ouzels seen this autumn yet, Timothy
    very doubt October the 13th the tortoise scarcely moves. October the 29th men
    put their hogs up a fattening Timothy the tortoise, who in May last year after
    fasting all the winter weighed only six pounds and four ounces. And in August
    when full fed weighed six pounds and 15 ounces. weighs now six pounds, nine ounces
    and then half and so he did last October ringmer. Thus his weight fluctuates according
    as fast Or abstains.




    Unknown Speaker  15:03


    November the second leaves fall very fast. My hedges show beautiful lights and
    shades. The yellow of the tall maples makes a fine contrast against the green
    Hazel''s. November 3. Timothy who is placed under a hen coop near the fruit wall
    scarce moves at all. November the sixth, the tortoise begins to dig mold for his
    winter retreat. He has much moss in his coop, under which he conceals himself.
    November the seventh, some snow on the ground. Many trees were stripped last night,
    vine leaves began to fall, winter weather. November the ninth Timothy does not
    stir. November the 13th week stubbles plow up in fine order green week comes up
    well taught us goes underground over him is thrown a coat of moss, the border
    being very light and mellow. The tortoise has thrown the mold entirely over his
    shell, leaving only a small breathing hole near his head. Timothy lies in the
    border under the fruit tool in an aspect where he will enjoy the warmth of the
    sun and where no wet can annoy him. A hen coop over his back protects him from
    dogs etc. footnote the severity of the weather quickens Timothy''s retreat, he
    used to stay above ground till about the 20th ringmer he used to lay himself up
    in a wet swampy border. Indeed he had no choice. November the 28th Timothy lies
    very snug but does not get any deeper. 1781 February the 11th the tortoise came
    forth and continue to be alert till the 25th and then ate some letters. When the
    weather turning very harsh. He retired under the straw in his coop. April the
    first the tortoise came out for two hours. April the second taught us out. April
    a third Timothy eats heartily the wryneck appears and piped May the eighth Timothy
    lies close this cold weather. July the seventh Timothy the tortoise who weighed
    April a second after fasting all the winter only six pounds and eight ounces now
    weigh seven pounds in one ounce weighed last August six pounds and 15 ounces.
    From the increased number of the swift It seems as if they had brought out many
    of their young. About eight in the evening. Swift''s get together in a large party
    and caught around the environs of the church as if to teach their broods the art
    of flying. July the 29th Timothy comes out but little while the weather is so
    hot. He sculpts among the carrots and cabbages September the 10th redbreast feed
    on elderberries enter rooms and spoil the furniture. Timothy''s appetite is now
    on the decline. September the 14th Timothy the tortoise doll and torpid October
    the 24th. The tortoise is very torpid, but does not bury itself. October the 27th
    my well sinks and is very low, the tortoise begins to dig into the ground. The
    bat is out this warm evening. October the 30th. The tortoise retires on the ground
    within his coop, November the eighth. The tortoise came out of his coop and there''s
    buried himself in the Laurel hedge 1782 March the 28th. Poor Timothy was flooded
    in his hibernacula moments the Laurel hedge and might have been drowned had not
    his friend Thomas come to his assistance and taken him away. Made the second to
    swift nor Hill passed by me at a steady rate towards this village as if they had
    just arrived. May the fourth vegetation is at a stand and Timothy the tortoise
    fast asleep The trees are still naked. May the 14th talk to us eat the leaves
    of poppies. June the 16th this hot weather makes the tortoise so alert to lead
    traverses all the garden by six o''clock in the morning. When the sun grows very
    powerful. he retires under a garden mat or in the shelter of some cabbage, not
    loving to be about him vehement heat. In such weather he eats greedily July the
    29th fine Woods strawberries again Wrong stream of water runs in northern mead
    among the haycox




    Unknown Speaker  20:05


    August the first timothy the tortoise weighed seven pounds and three ounces. October
    the 17th no baking pears gathered in medlars dug up carrots a good crop but small
    in size. The tortoise not only gets into the sun under the fruit wall, but he
    tilts one edge of his shell against the wall so as to incline his back to its
    raise. By what contrivance he obtains more heat than if he lays in his natural
    position. And yet this poor reptile has never read that planes inclining to the
    horizon receive more heat from the sun than any other elevation. At 4pm. he retires
    to bed under the broad foliage of a hollyhock. He has ceased to eat for some time.
    November the 26th. The woods and hedges are beautifully framed with snow ordered
    Thomas carefully to beat off the snow that lodges in the south side of the laurels
    and Laura steams November the 27th fierce frost rhyme hangs all day on the hanger.
    The hairs pressed by hunger haunt the gardens and devour the pink cabbages, parsley
    etc.

    redbreast Timothy the tortoise sleeps in the fruit border under the wall covered
    with a hen coop in which is a good arm full of straw. Here he will lie warm, secure
    and dry. His back is partly covered with mold 1783 February the 18th cleaned up
    the borders in the garden sowed radishes and a few carrots under the fruit bowl.

    the hill attended by a numerous flock of starlings. The tortoise gets under the
    Laurel hedge but does not bury himself. October the 29th tortoise begins to bury
    himself in the Laurel hedge 1780 for the buds of the vines have not swelled yet

    smell. Lily of the Valley blows lapwings on the downs May the 28th Timothy''s

    wicked we suppose, and may be in the fields among the grass. Timothy found in
    the little bean field short of the pound field. The nightingale Fernau cuckoo
    and grasshopper Lark may be heard at the same time in my outlet November the fourth
