She wanted a cow so she would have a daily supply of milk, and she wanted some worms to provide her with a goodly amount of silk. But the only worms for sale that day were those of the earth and the tape, and the cow she paid good money for was not quite the usual shape. It was a cow in the form of a bear and it stood on its hind legs, and rather than providing her with milk it laid weird furry eggs. For the market to which the farmer's wife went was a market exceeding odd, where all the beasts were blasphemous offences against God. There were spiders with horns and three-legged crows and giraffes from the gates of Hades, and owls spawned from mud and geese with ears and basilisks to frighten the ladies. The gentlemen were terrified too by the pig with ten million eyes, and the bloated sacs with razor wings which swooped down from the skies. 'Twas market day in Scroonhoonpooge when the godly tremble and pray, for the devil sells his monsters on Scroonhoonpooge Market Day.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Udo Luckner And The Magical Nucleus\n", "completion": " The British explorer Percy Fawcett vanished in the Amazon jungle, along with his son Jack and a friend of Jack's, in 1925. Fawcett was searching for the remains of an ancient mythical (and mystical) city he called Z. Over the following years, many attempts were made to find him...\nMany Brazilians told us that, over the past few decades, religious cults had spring up in the area that worshipped Fawcett as a kind of god. They believed that Fawcett had entered a network of underground tunnels and discovered that Z was, of all things, a portal to another reality. Even though Brian Fawcett had concealed his father's bizarre writings at the end of his life, these mystics had seized upon Fawcett's few cryptic references, in magazines such as the Occult Review, to his search for \"the treasures of the invisible World\". These writings, coupled with Fawcett's disappearance and the failure of anyone over the years to discover his remains, fuelled the notion that he had somehow defied the laws of physics.\nOne sect, called the Magical Nucleus, was started, in 1968, by a man named Udo Luckner, who referred to himself as the High Priest of the Roncador and wore a long white gown and a cylindrical hat with a Star of David. In the 1970s, scores of Brazilians and Europeans, including Fawcett's great-nephew, flocked to join the Magical Nucleus, hoping to find this portal. Luckner built a religious compound by the Roncador Mountains, where families were forbidden to eat meat or wear jewelry. Luckner predicted that the world would end in 1982 and said that his people must prepare to descend into the hollow earth. But, when the planet remained in existence, the Magical Nucleus gradually disbanded.\nfrom The Lost City Of Z : A Legendary British Explorer's Deadly Quest To Uncover The Secrets Of The Amazon by David Grann (2009)\n###"}
{"prompt": "High Strikes\n", "completion": " Victorian ladies who, one gets the impression, spent most of their lives in what is now known as 'socialising', rarely set foot in the kitchen except to have words with Cook, but were frequently found in hysterics, or high strikes as the condition was vulgarly known. When visitors came to call, a young woman had to know when to stay in the room or when to make herself scarce and while the writers on etiquette tried to be reassuring--'A young girl with all the freshness of youth and the sweet dignity of woman-hood has a sure passport into society which assures her a warmth of welcome' (the proviso, as long as her papa has pots of money, was considered at once too obvious and too coarse to be stated)--it is no surprise that so many of them were reduced to lying on the floor drumming their heels and screaming. Hysteria, which was, according to The Dictionary Of Daily Wants, 'more common in females than men', was characterised by 'low spirits, a feeling of depression and anxiety, sudden involuntary grief and tears, palpitation, sickness, a sense of suffocation and the apparent presence of a ball in the throat; theses symptoms are or are not attended with sobs and sudden fits of laughter, convulsive twitches and contractions of the hands and arms, finally terminating, after more or less muscular contractions, in insensibility and coma'. If the patient was young and robust, she was bled, but in general it was thought sufficient to throw cold water on her.\nfrom Alice Thomas Ellis, Fish, Flesh And Good Red Herring : A Gallimaufry (2004)\n###"}

If they refuse to obey, this will be taken as a sign that their claims are false.\nThe visionaries will then be visited by a team of psychiatrists, either atheists or Catholics, to certify their mental health while theologians will assess the content of any heavenly messages to see if they contravene Church teachings.\nIf the visionary is considered credible they will ultimately be questioned by one or more demonologists and exorcists to exclude the possibility that Satan is hiding behind the apparitions in order to deceive the faithful.\nI have put my name forward as a volunteer outreach demonologist for the new scheme. Peeking behind apparitions to check for the presence or absence of Satan is, after all, a long-standing hobby of mine, and I think I have the required skills-set.

I trust you make no question that those dull-pated pennyfathers, that in such dudgeon scorn rejected him, drunk deep of the sour cup of repentance for it when the high flight of his lines in common bruit was oyezed.

To wit, the launch of this lavish and lovely book:\n\nHere is part of the official press release from Westreich Wagner:\n\"works of James Beckett with constant interjections by Frank Key\"\nIn a spatially and conceptually complex arrangement of text, image and scale, this book is a multi-vocal account of the varied practice of Amsterdam-based artist James Beckett. Beckett's work explores minor histories, many of which are concerned with industrial development and demise across Europe, a process of investigation which is as much physical as it is biographical. The pages of this new monograph are littered with associative interjections from the archive of Frank Key's radio program \"Hooting Yard\", as an irreverent running commentary. These texts become marginal notes to, and poetic mirrors of, the contributions of the book's eleven other authors.\nContributing Authors:\nWill Bradley, Kari Cwynar, Moosje M.

{"prompt": "Tap-Tap\n", "completion": " \nMr Kearney, firing from both barrels, demolishes pseudonyms like a cowboy smashing bottles in a bar-room, and woven into his staid bibliographical canvas is a host of colourful figures, shorn of their aliases: authors, publishers, illustrators, booksellers, who have had a hand in this bizarre trade almost since the invention of moveable types. Perhaps the strangest of these is Alphonse Momas, a hack-pornographer or 'pisse-copie'. . . who wrote no fewer than forty-five books in the [Private Case] and whose output was so prolific that he had to use nine pseudonyms: Le Nismois, Tap-Tap, Cain d'Abel, L'Erotin, Fuckwell, Un journaliste du siecle dernier, Mercadette, Pan-Pan, and Trix. Mr Kearney tells us Momas was a civil servant attached to the Paris police and that he devoted himself to spiritualism in later life. I recall reading, in some attack on spiritualism, perhaps one of Fr Raupert's spirited diatribes, of a clergyman much given to the practice of automatic writing who, to his distress, found his hand suddenly impelled by an agency capable only of the grossest indecencies. Each day on awakening from the trance into which he had thrown himself, pen in hand, in humble expectation of exploring life beyond the veil, he discovered he had been delivered of page after page of writings of the lowest and most shocking kind. Perhaps it was the spirit of Tap-Tap', 'coming through'.\nTimothy D'Arch Smith, in a review of Patrick J.

One thinks of Stephen Fry, regularly--if inexplicably--acclaimed as the possessor of the largest and most pulsating brain on this or any other planet. It is a case of Triton among the minnows, the majority of television persons being so vacuous and stupid that someone like Fry can dazzle simply by using words of three or more syllables.\nThe delusion is even more pronounced in pop music, and nowhere more preposterously than in the adulation of the lead singer of The Smiths, a band that split up a quarter of a century ago. His autobiography has now been published as a Penguin Classic. Reread and digest that sentence, please, for it tells us much about the pitiable state of our culture, if indeed we could still be said to have one.\nWhat we have here is a combination of overweening vanity (on the part of the pop singer) and the sacrifice of any literary credibility to hard-headed marketing (on the part of the publisher). It would be bad enough had Penguin issued it as a Modern Classic, the usual imprint for suitably recognised works written after 1918. But no, this solipsistic screed is deemed worthy for inclusion in what the Penguin website still maintains is an imprint devoted to \"the best literature of several thousand years and countless cultures\".\nWhen the pop singer said \"I'd like my book to be published as a Penguin Classic\", the correct response would have been \"You are ridiculous. Go away.\"\nMy thoughts are with E. V. Rieu, a proper scholar, the original editor of the Penguin Classics list, who died in 1972. The poor man will be turning in his grave.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Ectoteleideoplasm\n", "completion": " \"The word 'ectoplasm' was not known to the Victorians, and after it was coined by the French spiritualist Charles Richet it vied in favour with 'teleplasm' and 'ideoplasm'. Richet had thought up the term after a seance in 1903.\n\"There are many descriptions in spiritualist literature of a misty vapour issuing from a medium which sometimes solidifies. When the medium Slade was in Australia in 1878 he produced a cloud-like whitish-grey vapour, 'Dr' Monck produced a white patch that turned into a cloudy pillar, and D D Home managed to extrude a variety of clouds that formed into hands. In 1885, Eglinton managed a dingy white-looking substance that swayed and throbbed. Madame d'Esperance, an almost forgotten medium born in 1849 and noted for her looks rather than her phenomena, described the production of ectoplasm as though fine threads were being drawn out of the pores of her skin and woven about her face and hands like a spider's web. The 'red, sticky matter' described by Bournemouth medium, Vincent Turvey, was an unusual variation on the theme, and when Florence Cook was manifesting Katie King the latter 'was connected with the medium by cloudy, faintly luminous threads'.\n\"Ectoplasm is supposed to have exuded from any or all of the medium's orifices, and to have been responsive to light, when it would retract. 'Ectoplasm' was captured by an investigator early in this [i.e., the twentieth] century; it burned to an ash, leaving a smell as of horn. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of salt and phosphate of calcium. It is perhaps unfortunate that modern chemists have not had the opportunity to try their skills on this mysterious substance.\"\nRonald Pearsall, The Table-Rappers (1972)\nSometimes, ectoplasm could appear inexplicably like a piece of net curtain, as in this 1948 photograph of the Middlesbrough medium Minnie Harrison:\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Concrete Posts of Obergruwwel\n", "completion": " He was beleaguered and curt, and had been ever since he was appointed to survey every single concrete post in the town of Obergruwwel. Witold Lutoslawski, the Polish composer who had worked with Panufnik as a cafe pianist, was on record as saying \"Those concrete posts needed a surveyor, but why this hatless, lantern-jawed man of disrepute was chosen is nothing less than a civic disgrace\". Uncharitable, perhaps, for the surveyor had himself once been a cafe pianist, in The Dismal Bat, that haven for baffled people with persistent coughs. Ah, but that had been so long ago. Most of the customers were now in their graves; the cafe itself had been bulldozed to make way for a space-age bird sanctuary; and the pianist, poor curt Kurt, roamed the streets with pad and pencil, jotting down notes about the concrete posts. There were more than seven hundred such posts in Obergruwwel, and no one had thought to survey them until the Town Balaclava Guild sat in special session in the converted gym on that grim, teeming, winter Thursday, behind locked doors, its members clad in coats of many hues, just like Joseph, the papa of Jesus Christ. Later, when the bright moon shimmered among stars, the Guild Vizier made a proclamation from the Town Hall balcony. \"We seek someone to survey the concrete posts,\" he said, \"Someone beleaguered and curt and hatless and lantern-jawed and disreputable.\" Thus did Kurt meet his destiny in this world.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tetrahedron News\n", "completion": " So who are they, these people who live on the tetrahedron-earth millions of years hence? (See below, 8th February). I asked Glyn Webster to tell me. He says:\n\"You don't need me to tell you what sort of people will live on the tetrahedron! First, M C Escher himself made a woodcut of the tetrahedral world of the future, Tetrahedral Planetoid, 1954. According to the Chrysler Museum of Art, \"in this print Escher imagined a small planet in the shape of a tetrahedron, or pyramid. Two of the four surfaces are visible and show houses, gardens, trees, roads, and even people.\" Escher etched in immense detail, so if you were to get close enough to Tetrahedral Planetoid with a magnifying glass you should be able to see just the sort of people who will live on the tetrahedron. There's not enough detail in this reproduction for me to see the people too closely, but it is safe to assume they are able to survive their straitened circumstances by virtue of their very strong Bomba.\n\n\"Next, from Carlos A Furuti's excellent Cartographical Map Projections pages I read that the tetrahedral world of the future will be a very relaxed world for cartographers: \"Most cartographic problems would disappear if the Earth were a polyhedron\", says Furuti, and Tetrahedral \"globes\" are very easy to manufacture. Furuti provides simple paper models that can be printed and given to tots to cut out and fold up on rainy days.\"\nSo now we know. Nothing there about rocket booster backpacks, though, which I had hoped would have appeared by about 1999. I'm still waiting.\n###"}

Interestingly, in the dictionary's first citation, from 1703, it is spelled Moofin, and in the second, from 1747, Muffing (capitalisation in the originals). I wonder if it is too late to beat against the tides of history and to reintroduce one or other of these spellings?\nAnyway, the only reason I have returned to this possibly inexhaustible topic is that, having apprised himself of the difference between true Moofins and what the rest of the world outside Britain think is a Muffing, Mr Webster has kindly provided these cut-out \"patches\" or \"plug-ins\" for your heraldic muffin device.

{"prompt": "The Manufacture Of Tinplate\n", "completion": " George Eliot said that a happy home life was a necessity for her to write. It seems the same was true for Dobson, who churned out all those innumerable out of print pamphlets while living in domestic bliss with Marigold Chew. But was happiness indeed the spur for his indefatigable pamphleteering? Quite the opposite was the case with Emanuel Swedenborg, as we learn from Eric John Dingwall. In Very Peculiar People : Portrait Studies In The Queer, The Abnormal And The Uncanny (1950) Mr Dingwall has a paragraph which ends superbly:\n\"As the years went by Swedenborg became more energetic than ever. His passion for women still tormented him, for, since the rejection of his suit by the young Emerentia Polhem about 1717, he apparently contracted no other alliance. There is no doubt that his failure to win her hand had affected him deeply, but he quickly steeled himself against allowing emotion to upset his work.

A brand new edition of the Book Of Days has just been published, apparently, but in place of Chambers' original heteroclite jumble of learning, anecdote and dusty scholarship, the reader is treated to anniversaries of television shows and such important dates as, I suspect, Kylie's birthday.

But something got his goat today, belatedly and unexpectedly, so bear with him please.\nAnd so we are about to enter the new Dark Ages. Things are bad enough already, in Papworld, ruled by airheads for airheads. Now we enter the Era of Pap and Darkness. A dim society gets dimmer, in more ways than one.\nI read about the new criminal status of the 100W light bulb a while ago, but only now have I summoned my rage. This is what happens. Relentless idiocy begets inertia even in those of us who still cling helplessly and hopelessly to the Raft of Sense.\nWell, I shall blunder about, in the gloom, half-blind, calling down imprecations upon the filament-bulb-hating nitwits. But eventually I will start shouting \"Bring me my blubber candles! Forward to the Dark Ages!

They have claws and talons or very thin little twig-like feet. Some say that long, long ago human beings began to write by copying the tracks made by the feet of birds in snow or mud. There is one more tiny bird to come. I think it will be a tiny harlequin duck, I can feel it in my water.\n\nOops! I was wrong! It is a tiny mute swan.

{"prompt": "Water-Cresses Without Sewage\n", "completion": " \nThis is Shirley Hibberd--or James Shirley Hibberd to give his full name--a Victorian writer and horticulturalist (1825-1890). I draw him to your attention apropos of nothing in particular. By all accounts he was a prolific author, churning out books and articles on many subjects apart from his specialist field. He wrote beautifully. Consider this, from \"The Instincts And Habits Of Bees\", published in The Intellectual Observer : Review Of Natural History, Microscopic Research And Recreative Science, Volume VI (1865).\n\"If a man has but one stock of bees and is of the right temper to make pets of them, his attachment to them will grow so surely that it will be strange if he does not, in a very short time, renounce many a commonplace pleasure in order to make room in his heart for a strong affection for these happy confectioners, and perhaps appropriate a portion of his head to an investigation of their instincts and habits, so as to prove for himself all the written records of bee history, and live in hope of adding to them the results of personal observation.\"\nI appropriated a portion of my head to wondering who this reminded me of. I appropriated another portion of my head to discovering the titles of some of the books of this proto-Dobson. They include:\nThe Seaweed Collector: A Handy Guide To The Marine Botanist Suggesting What To Look For, And Where To Go In The Study Of The British Algae And The British Sponges (1872)\nClever Dogs, Horses, Etc (1868)\nThe Golden Gate And Silver Steps, With Bits Of Tinsel Round About (1886)\nWater-Cresses Without Sewage (1878)\nAnd, in 1856, this:\n\nThe photograph of Shirley Hibberd, by an unknown snappist, is copyright The Oxford Dictionary Of National Biography.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Origins Of Innit\n", "completion": " One of the more distressing verbal infelicities committed by young persons nowadays is the strewing of their utterances with \"innit\", as in \"I was like oh my god innit\". My chief objection is that it is almost always ungrammatical. It used to be the case that \"innit\" was a truncation of \"isn't it?\", but if you listen carefully to teen persons, their \"innit\"s can rarely be construed as such.\nThe changing fads and fashions of teensprache are a mystery, at least to me, for I have not studied these matters properly. But I think I have stumbled upon the reason why \"innit\" has become so ubiquitous. Last night, I watched a snippet of BBC4's John Lennon Night, an edition of Top Of The Pops 2 (recorded some years ago, I think) in which Yoko Ono did little introductory pieces to camera for a selection of songs by her bespectacled Liverpudlian husband. The programme began with Yoko saying:\n\"We didn't think [Give Peace A Chance] would be a big song, but it is, innit?\"\nYoko was, of course, using \"innit\" in a grammatically correct manner, but I am convinced that a generation of young persons heard this when it was originally broadcast and, bowled over by the Beatle relict's verbal flourish, duly began to imitate her on any and every occasion.\nI am thus forced to revise my view of \"innit\" and will henceforth say a little prayer for world peace and a wish for no possessions whenever I overhear it.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Daily Bird Challenge\n", "completion": " The time is right, I think, to flex my ornithological chops by setting a daily bird-related challenge. By doing so, I hope to silence forever those fiends who mutter darkly that \"Actually, Mr Key is a complete ignoramus in matters avian\". It is astonishing, is it not, that such brickbats can be thrown? Yet they are, with distressing regularity. Well, let us see how the birdy know-alls deal with the first of these challenges!\nYour task, which you must accept on pain of Aubreyan kim kam, is, bebooted and with your bird spotters' book tucked in to the pocket of your rainwear, to locate and identify the following birds, as mentioned in Slouching Towards Kalamazoo by Peter De Vries (1983):\n\"That there is no bluebird of happiness, only the robin of resigned acceptance of things as they are. The plain everyday starling of common, undeluded reality... and then what next?... The grackle of total disillusionment?\"\nSo there are four birds to spot, and spot well. No ordinary bluebirds, nor robins, nor starlings, nor grackles, mind. And, once spotted, you must execute pencil or crayon sketches of each, and post them, or links to them, in the Comments carton.

{"prompt": "Hot Zinc\n", "completion": " I used to know a man whose name, unusually, was Hot Zinc. His character was equally rum. He muttered much in Dutch, while twisting twigs into dollies. Angular and emaciated, they were frightening dollies, quite unsuitable for the tiny tots who form the standard dolly demographic.\nThe airbag in his car was of a wholly new type. It was devised by his cousin. He had dozens of cousins, and the name of the airbag designer was Ulf Drib, which is an anagram of bird flu. Ulf was a fat fellow who looked as if several of his airbags had exploded within him. In May 1968 he threw a pebble at a policeman in Paris. Youthful folly! Now he was fat and comfortable and bourgeois and able to manipulate air in wondrous ways.\nIt was good thing he did, for Hot Zinc was a terrible driver. He ploughed into a gaggle of swans beside a canal. The prototype new airbag saved his life. The swans', not.\n###"}

It is founded on an extensive series of experiments, which tend to bring the mysterious phenomena of Mesmerism within the domain of physics, and in fact to reduce the whole subject of physiology to a department of chemical science... The investigations, of which the results are here described, are of a singularly curious character, exhibiting the most astonishing developments, with a philosophical calmness that is rare even among German savants.\"\n\"In the album presented to the King of Bavaria by the artists of Munich, is an admirable composition by Hubner. It is an expression of the feelings of a large portion of Upper Germany. It represents a female prostrate upon the ground, with the arms crossed, the face entirely hidden, in an attitude of the deepest despair. The long hair floats over the arms, and trails along the ground. The whole figure is a mixture of majesty and utter abandonment. The simple title of the piece is--Germania, 1850.\"\n###"}

Sitting at your desk in a corner of a virtual barn, you have to make bureaucratic decisions about cows, goats, tractors and similar farmyard appurtenances, fill in lots of paperwork, and drink weak and watery pixellated tea from a grubby pixellated samovar while you await the arrival of the regional collective farm supervisor, who could appear on the screen at any moment, but may just as likely never arrive at all.\nTo give a flavour of the game, here are a couple of screenshots.\n\n\nFor added verisimilitude, scenes such as these remain \"stuck\" on screen for days on end. Sound effects include the mooing of a tubercular cow and the puttering of a tractor about to run out of fuel.\nWhile you await delivery of your pre-ordered copy of Collective Farm Administrator 2.0, you may indulge in further rustic fun and frolic, this time in full colour, by following this link.

Was it stolen by a ruthless gang of aromatic resin smugglers? Did the gang abduct the physician as part of the plan? Was the local television station prompted to show Celebrity Balm In Gilead Sniffer Dog Challenge? Did the massed bloodhounds and their permatanned owners fail to find even the merest trace of resin? Did the gang succeed in carting off all the balm in Gilead to their mountain lair? What are we to make of the conjecture in the press that the physician's abduction was a piece of fakery and that he was the mastermind behind the plot? How long did it take for a hack on the Daily Shackle to dub the affair Balmingileadgate? Will there ever again be balm in Gilead? Who is the young whippersnapper who has arrived, announcing himself as the replacement physician? Is there something reproachful and oily about his manner? Why does he keep referring to the missing balm as \"gumme\" or \"triacle\"? Is he unable to spell \"treacle\", or is he up to something? Why does he refuse to divulge the recipe for the bandage paste he uses? Is he in league with his predecessor, and with his predecessor's alleged gang? Is there any connection between the fact that the new oily physician has put posters up all over the place promising to rid the populace of \"evil humours\" and that \"malign bile ad\" is an anagram of \"balm in Gilead\"? What on earth is that stuff the new physician smears on his hair? Must it pong so offensively? Has he no shame?

For the past few years I have been engaged in some rather abstruse socio-anthropological research. In the course of this work, as a sort of 'spin-off', I happen to have cracked the code of the Aztec-Maya-Omec Tonalpouhalli ('ritual year'). This, even if I say so myself, is quite an important academic achievement and will undoubtedly create quite a stir in the appropriate circles when I publish my findings.\nFor your information--in case your acquaintance with the extinct Meso-American cultures is no longer up to specialist standard--the Tonalpouhalli was a 'year' consisting of 13 20-day 'months'... The Nahuatl word 'Tonalpouhalli' translates as something like 'the arithmetic of destiny' and it forms the foundation of the Tonalamatl ('The Book of Fate') which consists of pictures only...\nThe reason I am telling you this is that, with the riddle solved, the Tonalamatl lends itself eminently well to a transformation into a game akin to the phenomenally successful Monopoly, as well as to an ordinary card game, as well as to a divinatory system similar to the Tarot cards...

{"prompt": "Downy, Witched, Dutch Cloud-heaps of Some Quaintest Tramontane Nephelococcugia of Thought\n", "completion": " This familiar phrase, which appears in the quotation from M. P. Shiel above, was also the title of one of Dobson's more readable works, and the only one to find a publisher in his lifetime. (All those pamphlets of his were, of course, cranked out on Marigold Chew's dilapidated printing press.) During the early 1950s, after spending some time as a pin-the-paper-to-the-cardboard instructor at the Pang Hill Orphanage, Dobson became interested for the first time in writing pedagogic works for urchins. The early attempts were not a success. In a burst of ludicrous enthusiasm, he produced a series of ten \"Tracts For Tinies\" (including the now justly-admired Hideous Execution Practices Of The Blood-Drenched Corsairs, Ten Easy Steps To Grooming Your Cormorant, and My Nightmares About Emily Dickinson), but sales were few, and most of the copies ended up being used as hot air balloon ballast. Late in 1958, however, a janitor who worked for Ladybird Books picked up a copy of A Brief & Bewildering History Of Helsinki in a charity shop, read it with glee, and showed it to one of the firm's editors, who immediately tracked down the elusive pamphleteer. Commissioned to write a book for the Junior Science series, and given carte blanche regarding his subject-matter, Dobson scribbled down this tremendous text in just three hours.

Among the fascinating material in this book, she has drawn my attention to these glove-related nuggets of interest:\nMusonius, a philosopher who lived at the close of the first century of Christianity, among other invectives against the corruption of the age, says \"it is shameful that persons in perfect health should clothe their hands and feet with soft and hairy coverings\". (page 4)\nAbout Queens, we read that Anne Boleyn was marvellously dainty about her gloves. She had a nail which turned up at the side, and it was the delight of Queen Catharine to make her play at cards without her gloves, in order that the deformity might disgust King Henry. It is also an historical fact that Queen Elizabeth was extravagant, fastidious, and capricious in the extreme about her gloves, and used to display them to advantage in playing the virginal. (page 55)\nIt was considered unbecoming if not undignified in olden days to wear gloves when visiting the royal stables. The reason given seems strange, but it is an ancient established custom in Germany, that whoever enters the stables of a prince, or great man, with his gloves on his hands, is obliged to forfeit them by a fee to the servants.

{"prompt": "What's on in Mustard Parva\n", "completion": " My diving helmet is made of gleaming brass. I polish it once a week, on Friday afternoons. Each Saturday morning, I don the diving helmet and cycle fourteen voots to a bucolic hamlet called Mustard Parva. (Curiously, there is no neighbouring village named Mustard Magna, although a rustic barnyard person I met while drinking a pot of gaar in the local gaar-pot drinking hut told me that there had once been such a place. In the year of his birth, this toothless derelict said, the sizeable cluster of wooden buildings known as Mustard Magna had been invaded by a sloth of bears, many hundreds of them, driven insane by ergot poisoning, each bear capable of destroying a humble peasant dwelling with a single thwack from its mighty paw. Two hours after the first bear lumbered across Sawdust Bridge, the village was completely obliterated. It is still shown on some maps.) Jamming my bicycle into a kiosk on Mustard Parva's Yoko Ono Boulevard, I join six or seven other diving helmet enthusiasts for our weekly meeting. Huddled together in the upstairs room of a building fast succumbing to dry rot, we discuss our diving helmets and take lamentably inaccurate minutes which are published regularly through the good offices of the Mustard Parva Thing, whose editor is none other than the blind cousin of Marigold Chew.\nSource : The Belle of Amherst & Other Essays Written During An Unprecedented Pea-souper by Dobson (limited edition of three copies, unsigned, bound in tat, and coated with a foul-smelling medicament concocted by Dr Fang)\n###"}

{"prompt": "Summer o' Cartographic Excitement\n", "completion": " Readers with school community education hub-aged tinies will be keen to find activities to entertain and instruct their nippers through the summer holidays. Surprisingly few children today take as great delight as Little Ruskin did in jumping off a box, so that splendid hobby is unlikely to occupy all their time in the coming weeks. Thus I am pleased to announce Mr Key's Summer Holiday Cartographic Excitement Project.\nThe idea is that, when the weather is foul or the bliss of frolicking outdoors begins to pall, your tinies can busy themselves drawing maps of Hooting Yard. First of all, of course, they will have to be familiar with all the tales and investigations posted here, so I suggest you make them click on the \"Prose\" category (in the Archives) and read everything, possibly twice. Then give them paper and pencils and crayons and pots of paint and so on, and have them create a map, or maps, which accurately, or indeed inaccurately, represent the settings of the stuff they have read. They may wish to draw a detailed street map of Pointy Town, or the branch line out to O'Houlihan's Wharf, or even something as ambitious as the entire landscape, showing Sawdust Bridge and Bodger's Spinney and Pebblehead's \"chalet o' prose\" and Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard and the running track where fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol sprinted round and round and round under the watchful eye of Old Halob and the dingly dell hotel carpark and the bottomless viper pit and so on and so, exhaustively, forth.\nThat should keep them busy until summer's end, at which point they, or you, can scan their maps and send them to Mr Key, who will display each and every one received here on the Hooting Yard website.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Kitemark\n", "completion": " \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been wondering if it is time for Hooting Yard to obtain a kitemark.  Readers from overseas will wonder what on earth I am babbling about, so let me explain. Every single person in this country, man, woman and child, upon seeing a little picture of a kite, knows viscerally that whatever it is that the picture of a kite is attached to is an absolutely fantastic thing, and they can confidently begin to drool with glee. Why this should be so is not quite clear, but is probably bound up with age-old traditions of bureaucratic twaddle.\nIt has its critics, of course, those in the reality-based community who suggest there is something inane in the equation picture of a kite = gleeful drooling. But we can only go on the evidence before us. I tested the Pavlovian responses of passers-by in a bustling hamlet yesterday. First, I offered people a string bag packed with oozing squelchy muck. There were no takers, and indeed on more than one occasion I was clouted around the head or threatened by the attentions of community hub vigilance officers. But then I made the same offer having stuck a picture of a kite to the bag with Blu-Tac. The transformation was astonishing. People began to openly drool in the streets, their glee uncontained, and several grabbed at the bag full of muck until I had inadvertently created a melee. In the end I had to hide behind a piece of civic statuary, but my point was proved.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Banished To A Pompous Land\n", "completion": " So resonant is the phrase \"banished to a pompous land\" that it was adopted by one expatriate Hooting Yard devotee as a pseudonym. You will, I trust, be familiar with Mr Banished not only for his comments here but for his own blog--where, in the sidebar, you will see the quotation from A Lecture Delivered In The Big Tent At Hoon where the phrase appeared.\nAs far as memory served, this 1987 story was the only incidence of the phrase. However, while researching the Bill Hatworn letters, I discovered this earlier usage, which I think dates from about 1984--almost thirty long, long years ago. It is a piece called Golden Gate, and is a good example of the kind of thing I was writing at that time, before the advent of the Malice Aforethought Press. Make of it what you will.\nBanished to a pompous land where I knew no one, I set about mending my ways. There were flags to be darned, ceremonial shields to be polished, hospitality to be dispensed. At night, I was seconded to stand guard at a gateway. The gateway was made of solid gold. It was enormous. I sat hunched on a wooden stool, alert and eagle-eyed. I brandished my pike at the hint of a passer-by. But few passed by, and in the tiny hours I pondered, and pondered hard. There was me, felon, rascal, thief, and behind my back a gigantic gateway cast in gold. One night, I took a rasp. All was dark and still as I began to shave the gold from the gate. At dawn, my satchel held a cellophane packet of gold, and each night I added packet after packet. It is dawn again now. In an hour, they will take me away and behead me.\n###"}

As she advanced, the place seemed an area of desolation and decay, with wind-falls for crops.

Yes, it is Kalaallit Nunaat of which I speak, the land whose flag is shown above, the land which used to be shown as Gruntland on early maps. I would like to think it was so called because it was the home of the Grunty Man who plods so menacingly through the nightmares of tiny children, but here \"Grunt\" simply means \"Ground\".\nJust as there is no Grunty Man in Greenland, nor are there any railways, rivers or canals. There are a few roads, true, but only the glorious and lovely towns of Ivittuut and Kangilinnguit are connected by one, every other human settlement being isolated.

{"prompt": "Practical Seagull Exercises\n", "completion": " If you have a pet seagull, it is extremely important to ensure that it gets the requisite amount of exercise. Have you got any idea how dangerous it is for a seagull to become idle and listless? Many seabird doctors have, over the years, been driven to despair by the negligence of certain people who keep seagulls as pets. One such medic, whose name, by weird coincidence, is a perfect anagram of auk tern guillemot gull, has written a memoir in which he lambasts some of the feckless seaside-resort inhabitants whose gulls he came to tend. His language is at times violent, but what shines through the prose is a great love for seabirds and an almost pathological loathing of human beings.\nIn an appendix, the doctor recommends certain exercises which the responsible gull-keeper ought to encourage a bird to perform as part of its fitness regime. Mindful of the depressed economies of most coastal regions, all of the exercises are designed to cost little in the way of kit. For example, gull exercise number ten, reprinted below, involves nothing more than access to a limitless supply of corrugated cardboard:\nGull Exercise Number Ten\nFetch a few large sheets of corrugated cardboard and take them to your seagull. Announce in a loud voice that you will reward the bird with a bucket of fish-heads and entrails if it tears the corrugated cardboard to pieces with its fearsome beak. Stand well back. Most well-balanced seagulls will shred the corrugated cardboard in a matter of minutes. Note: if you do not actually have a bucket full of fish-heads and entrails with which to reward the gull at the end of its exercise, it may become angered and vengeful, so make sure you are wearing protective clothing and have removed all traces of fish-odour from yourself by bathing in lemon juice, or alternatively keeping as far away from the harbour as you can, especially at those times when the fishing boats come in to port with their catch of sprats and gudgeon.\n###"}

On a sudden came a frightfully large bird darting down upon us, so that we thought it was going to carry one or both of us away. At this we both began to scream, and to defend ourselves with our shepherd's crooks, and to cross ourselves, till the bird flew away; then we said to one another, \"We have done wrong in wishing to be able to fly; God did not create us for flying, but for walking.\" Another time I was in a very deep fissure looking for crystals, of which many were found in it. All at once I saw a stone as large as an oven starting from the side, and as I had no time to get out of the way, I stooped down upon my face. The stone fell several fathoms down to a spot above me, and from thence it made a spring away over me, so that I escaped with a whole skin.

He stayed valiantly on, doing his duty faithfully by his humble people. But after some time had elapsed, 'his health being much impaired, and there being no church or meeting-house, he was exposed to the violence of the weather at all seasons; and having no manse or glebe, and no fund for communion elements, and having no mortification for schools or other pious purposes in either of the islands, and the air being unwholesome,'--he was finally compelled to leave, much to his own regret and that of his poor little flock.\"\nHattie Tyng Griswold, Home Life Of Great Authors (1886)\n###"}

{"prompt": "My Winch\n", "completion": " I always wanted a winch of my own, something I could use to haul things up and then to lower them again. Winching is splendid exercise, for one thing, and for another thing, it is often very useful to winch things off the ground. Think of a flood, or an infestation of ferocious ants with powerful biting jaws, or even both at the same time! You might think the floodwater would drown the ants, but that is not necessarily so, for they might be swimming ants. My brother Raoul tells me that his barn was almost swept away in a mighty flood, and that there was a swarm of fierce ants bobbing about in the water, biting anything that came into their path, such as my brother Raoul's goose. Raoul has a licence for only one goose, otherwise I am sure he would have more. His goose was bitten by the ants, but he was able to rescue it before the ants' venom coursed through its veins. He does not have a winch, so he had to slosh through the floodwater in the barn and pluck his goose from it with his bare hands. Well, they were not bare, for Raoul was wearing farmers' gloves. But if he had had a winch, he could have winched the goose, if not the entire barn, out of danger. That is the kind of thing you can do if you have a winch. It is not always easy to hire one at short notice, as I know to my cost. The winchless circumstances in which I learned that cost are too recent, and too upsetting, for me to talk about without bursting into tears. I have not even told Raoul. After all, as the old saying has it, \"Never sob in front of a farmer\".\n###"}
{"prompt": "What Was Cardew Thinking?\n", "completion": " John Tilbury, in his biography Cornelius Cardew :  A Life Unfinished (2008) on some of the later songs, when our hero had become a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party Of Britain (Marxist-Leninist):\nInvariably, the songs are extended by virtue of repetition ; in \"Revisionist Somersaults And The Opportunist Opposition\" the brevity and uneventfulness of the melody is a blessing, except that there are ten verses; the crude lyric is provided with music which is appropriately routine... How can this be explained--by which I mean, what was Cardew thinking at the time? I quote just the first verse:\nOne jumps out and one jumps in saying\nCPC(ML) agent of the bourgeoisie\nThe Moscow 'communists' really love this country\nAnd say that CPC(ML) is against democracy\nWith one foot in and the other also\nThe revisionists and opportunists defend the status quo\n\"An Opportunist Has Come Back Home\" is an endless, turgid, sectarian tract attacking a 'revisionist' who has betrayed the Party. The text is spoken and sung; the music is interspersed with, and accompanies, speech alternating with a sung chorus... the whole text [is] of extraordinary length, doubtless uncut and unabridged. Here, towards the beginning, Voice 1 describes the young man:\nOh beautiful sight! What a striking pose!\nOh look at his Russian greatcoat,\nThe Mao badge on his lapel,\nHis Castroite fatigues,\nAnd this is not all! Oh yes!\n(Voice II)\nAn opportunist has come back home\nFor me, the wonderful thing about these songs is that they are sung in an impeccably upper middle class accent, and have a jauntiness redolent of the Bloomsbury set on a picnic outing. Not so much jolly hockey sticks as jolly petrol bombs. (I'm also intrigued by the way the ideological imperative of the lyrics means that they rarely scan comfortably. Well, you try packing \"our ideology is Marxism-Leninism, we're workers and like workers everywhere our aspiration is for socialism ushered in by violent revolution\" or \"in utter chaos the old order spews out unlimited decadence and parasitism\" into a singable song.)\n###"}

{"prompt": "Mustard? Custard!\n", "completion": " Mustard? Custard! is an exciting parlour game for all the family, best played in pitch darkness. While the lights are still on, each player is dealt a hand of six cards. These are then traded frantically until someone has a hand of a single suit. This player is designated the timekeeper, and is also in charge of the light switch. Each person then places their cards face down on the table.\nThe timekeeper draws the curtains, closes any shutters, and turns off the light. Using hoops, counters and coat-hangers, the players dash wildly around the room bumping into furniture, walls and each other, all the while screaming at the tops of their voices. Points are gained for bloodcurdling shrieks, bestial howling, and unbridled panic.\nAfter precisely three hours have passed, the timekeeper switches the lights back on. The players have ten seconds to claw their way to the table and collect their cards. A non-participating family member or friend then creeps into the room with a trolley on which there are two large bowls, one filled to the brim with mustard and the other with custard. Big iron spoons are distributed to each player. Starting with the person holding the best hand, and then in descending order, each player plunges their spoon into one of the bowls, gulps down the yellow goo, and shouts \"Mustard!\" or \"Custard!\" accordingly.\nWhen everyone has had their turn, the whole game is repeated from scratch, with the important difference that at the end, those who devoured a spoonful of custard must choose the mustard, and vice versa.\nThere is no outright winner. As in all sports and pastimes, the important thing is taking part.\n###"}

It reads as follows:\n\n\"It is a crying shame, Mr Key, that you did not seek my permission before letting those Dabbler people, whomsoever they may be, reproduce my receipt for alphabet soup. Either through neglect or mischief you omitted a crucial passage from the receipt, and I feel sorry for any reader who prepares the soup according to the bastardised version which is now so regrettably in the public domain. It occurred to me to issue a corrective as a tweet on The Dabbler's Twitter feed, but on reflection I realised I do not even know what that means, being as I am a creature very much of the previous century, if not the one before that. I therefore insist that you air this letter on your weblog.\n\"Please note that when leaving the bowl to stand, and before transferring the contents to a cauldron, one should introduce into the liquid a duck, preferably a merganser or teal. The duck should be left to plash 'n' dabble in the bowl, as if it were a pond, for at least two hours. You should then remove the duck, gently, wearing gloves, and allow it to go on its merry way, perhaps to rejoin its family of other ducks, wherever they may be. The soup will contain a \"memory\" of the duck's presence, plashing 'n' dabbling, and this adds a piquancy to the flavour which, though imperceptible on the palate, is such stuff as soups are made on, as the Swan of Avon (a man, not a duck) might have said.\n\"I shall look forward to seeing this important note appear, Mr Key.

Yours pleadingly, Sophonisba Gullsbeak (Miss).\nI am afraid to say that I haven't got a clue. Dobson, the titanic pamphleteer of the twentieth century, compiled a similar Dictionary Of Fruit- And Nut-Related Jazz And Blues Nomenclature (out of print), but the soul music of Gladys Knight And The Pips fell outwith his frame of reference. All I can suggest is that perhaps you obtain high-definition photographic enlargements of the pips of every fruit-with-pips you can think of, and then compare these with photographs of the Pips. It is possible you might be able to note certain striking resemblances. Of course, it is equally possible you might not.\nBy the way, I cannot help wondering if you, like your namesake Sophonisba Peale, daughter of the American painter, soldier, scientist, inventor, politician, and naturalist Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827) have three brothers named Raphael, Rembrandt, and Rubens.

This crime was discovered when I came home by the smell of peppermint, and a large dose of rhubarb and soda was at once administered with a forcing-spoon, though I was in robust health at that time, to teach me to avoid such carnal indulgences as lollypops for the future. For two years, also, I was obliged to swallow a dose of rhubarb every morning and every evening because--according to old-fashioned ideas--it was supposed to 'strengthen the stomach'!

Here, now, at Valladolid was another mouth that equally required plugging. What a pity, then, that some gay brother page of Kate's had not been there to turn aside into the room, armed with a roasted potato, and, taking a sportsman's aim, to have lodged it in the crocodile's abominable mouth!

I think we recently received a letter from Bill Hatworn, our Kenya correspondent,\"\nTragically, this is the sole mention of Bill Hatworn in the novel and, indeed, in all world literature. We learn nothing, nothing whatsoever, about him, not even the contents of that letter, which Monsieur Clinche has \"already filed\". Surely, having invented a character with such a resounding name--one which we must presume he considered typically Anglo-Saxon--Simenon ought to have bashed out a series of novels about him and his doings in Kenya? Clearly it must fall to me to rescue Mr Hatworn from obscurity and to write all those exciting adventures myself.\nFirst up, I suppose, will have to be Bill Hatworn--Kenya Correspondent! to introduce our hero to readers. Next, I think I will take inspiration from a poster I saw for a new blockbuster multiplex piece of cinematic twaddle (see below) and write Bill Hatworn And The Foolish People Of The Future!

Various provincial cliques and coteries, whether eccentrically Anglo-Irish, or just plain Irish, are inflated out of all proportion to their actual significance by their admiring fellows in the metropolitan British media. It is also depressing that the only celebrated visual art is the political graffiti--known as Muriels in Belfast--that adorns the ends of terraced housing. Hollywood contributes its quotient of surreal movies about nobly moody Irish terrorists allegedly facing agonising moral dilemmas, rather than the reality of intimidating drunks cutting (Republican Catholic) people's throats in Belfast bars for such grave offences as spilling their drink, a practice that assumed global notoriety after the slaying of Robert McCartney (1971-2005). It can depict Irish-American cops as crooked or psychopathic in such movies as LA Confidential or Internal Affairs, but realism departs once the movies are about the emerald isle. Drink plays a large role in what is a deeply unattractive fusion of sentimentality and violence, where people are quick to take offence as Robert McCartney and Brendan Devine discovered (senior Belfast IRA figures stabbed and battered McCartney to death in Magennis's bar after Devine had made an observation about one of the females in their company). Speaking of bars, dingy Irish theme pubs are ubiquitous in Europe, with their fake swirling Celtic tat and Guinness, and giant monitors for football and rugby, Gaelic or otherwise, which only partially drowns out the relentless, mindless gabbling known as 'craic'. Some evenings these places are given over to interminable fiddle and jiggy music, or to tear-jerking rebel songs, although a truly weird cultural format, consisting of boys and girls hopping up and down with their arms rigid at their sides, has even made it on to the West End stage in London.\n###"}

Does that mean simply a shed with a magnet in it? Or a shed built out of planks in which magnets have somehow been embedded, perhaps by banging them into the weave of the wood with a hammer? Or should that be the weft of the wood? Ought I consult the dictionary regarding weft and rewrite the preceding sentences? Is \"a shed for magnetic purposes\" the same thing as \"a magnetic shed\"? Whether it is or not, and assuming I have managed to build it, how does it work? Given that Madame Blavatsky was writing, if you remember, From The Polar Lands, are we just talking about compasses here? Wouldn't it be easier to use a compass than to build a wooden shed for magnetic purposes? Or is it all a lot more complicated and beyond my poor puny pea-sized brain? Does it matter what kind of wood I use? Should I concern myself with the size of the shed, and its proportion in relation to the size and/or power of the magnet or magnets?

{"prompt": "Flapper In An Airship\n", "completion": " Some writers are so damned original that they create their own genre. This is true even of certain pulp writers, such as the American scribbler Brent Crude, who was born on this day in 1882. After knocking out short stories at a prodigious rate for magazines such as Amazing Yarns, Astonishing Yarns, and Breathtaking Yarns, in 1922 Crude published his first full-length novel. Flapper In An Airship introduced readers to his heroine the flapper in an airship, and thus was born the entire flapper-in-an-airship genre.\nOver the following two decades, dozens of hacks bashed out novels about flappers in airships, but none could match Brent Crude's industry, nor indeed his ability to devise page-turning pot-boilers about flappers in airships. By the time of his death in 1941, it is thought he had written over fifty novels featuring the flapper in an airship.\nInterestingly, Brent Crude was an exact contemporary, 1882 to 1941, of both James Joyce and Virginia Woolf. If he is little read today, it is probably because both flappers and airships have fallen out of fashion. I think, however, he is due for a revival. This is not a view shared by the literary critic Prig Blot, one of the few people who has read all of Crude's work (or at least claims to have done so).\n\"These so-called flapper in an airship novels,\" he contends, \"are all much of a muchness, Careful analysis of the texts, as carried out by me in my Scandinavian ivory tower overlooking the fjords and glaciers of my homeland, demonstrates conclusively that Brent Crude simply shuffled about the same sentences and paragraphs of his first novel, over and over again, occasionally inserting a different adjective here and there. I have wasted ten years of my life reading and rereading and rerereading these foolish books, years I can never regain, and my soul is corroded, and all I am good for now is to eke out what time is left to me chewing salted fish and sobbing into my Scandinavian napkin.\"\nAll of Brent Crude's books are currently out of print.\n###"}

I learn from the website that their repertoire soon extended to children's ditties, worker's songs, national anthems and quotes from Finnish laws and international treaties.

{"prompt": "The Curious Appeal Of Deal\n", "completion": " What, when there are places on the map called Upper Dicker, Lower Dicker, or Wyre Piddle, was the particular appeal of Deal (pop. 28,504), one wonders, for the nation's reprobates and misanthropes? The drunken polymorphously perverse bankrupt novelist and cashiered King's Own Shropshire Light Infantryman Simon Raven (1927-2001), for example, was banished to a nursing home for handicapped old ladies in the town for thirty-four years, sallying forth every now and again to a massage parlour opposite the Reform Club, Pall Mall, for 'a good housemaid's wank'. One is compelled to picture the streets of Deal as a world in decay thronged with George Grosz characters got up in askew velvet hats and musquash coats seeking eyeglass-fogging diversions. 'I always used to see [Charles] Hawtrey being pulled out of pubs,' Raven recalled the week before he died, 'But what's wrong with that? We all like a drink, don't we dear?' Deal is the capital of non-conformity.\nA footnote by Roger Lewis in his biography Charles Hawtrey : The Man Who Was Private Widdle (2001). Another Deal resident, in his final years, was Rayner Heppenstall (1911-1981), whose posthumously published novel The Pier is a murderous fantasy in which the Heppenstall-like narrator systematically plans and commits the slaughter of his (working class) next door neighbours.\n\n###"}

Well, we take it all back. Recently, our people sent a speculative letter to his people accompanied by a draft screenplay for a film based on the adventures of Ugo of Plovdiv (see the Unhelpful Index for dates of the various stories). This morning, we received the following email:\nDear Hooting Yard Person : I am writing on behalf of Kevin Costner, who you are aware is the single most creative genius currently working in the motion picture industry. Kevin has read your screenplay for Ugo Of Plovdiv and it is fair to say that he is bowled over. He is particularly taken with your twist on the eternal theme of a relationship triangle. Instead of the usual boy, boy, girl or girl, girl, boy, you have devised a scenario involving boy (Ugo), boy's pal (Ugo's pal Ulf), and boy's blind mother (Ugo's ma), the trio forever locked into a battle of wits by turns humorous, tragic, heart-warming, and--despite being set in the drab Bulgarian town of Plovdiv--utterly relevant to American idealism and optimism, values which Kevin embraces in such works as Waterworld, Field Of Dreams, and, of course, Tin Cup. I enclose a cheque for three dollars and a contract for you to sign, in which you cede intellectual copyright and complete creative control of the project to Kevin. Just to keep you informed, our man is so thrilled by your script that he has already signed up the two Toms, Cruise and Hanks, to play Ugo and Ugo's pal Ulf (or vice versa), and Cher as Ugo's blind ma. Yours sincerely, Illegible, pp Kevin Costner.\n###"}

It is a supergroup, and a multi-disciplinary one at that, drawing in not just musicians but sports stars, politicians, and statesmen from around the world.

{"prompt": "A Man Of Letters\n", "completion": " [F. J. Furnivall (1825-1910)] was... besides being a redoubtable scholar himself, one of the great rock-blasting entrepreneurs of Victorian scholarship, the kind of man who if his energies had taken another turn might have covered a continent with railways. As secretary of the Philological Society, he spent twenty years amassing materials for the New (Oxford) English Dictionary, of which he was one of the first editors; as founder of the Early English Texts Society, he performed an indispensable service for medievalists. Societies were his natural element. Apart from the E.E.T.S., he also founded the New Shakespere Society [he insisted on spelling it that way], the Ballad Society, the Chaucer Society, the Wycliffe Society, the Shelley Society, the Browning Society. It is a measure of his optimism that he even tried to start a Lydgate Society, though it failed to get off the ground...\n\nThere are times when it is impossible not to applaud his fighting spirit, or marvel at his vitality. Like the young Shakespeare, he was a lithe and active fellow; at the age of seventy he had enough surplus energy left to found the Hammersmith Sculling Club for Girls and Men, and he was still turning out with them on the river every Sunday at the age of eighty-five. He was also an ardent old-fashioned socialist, who refused to be bound by snobbish convention. It is characteristic that the memorial volume published after his death should have contained, along with contributions by scholars from all over the world, a simple tribute from a waitress in the ABC tea-shop in Oxford Street where he used to hold court.\nfrom The Rise And Fall Of The Man Of Letters by John Gross (1969)\n###"}

And then, as suddenly as they had become fashionable, so Duggleby Bins were shunned, discarded, abandoned, broken up with hammers, and ownership of one became a social gaffe, the cause of mockery and disgrace. Nowadays, you can trawl for weeks or months or years through junkyards and rubbish tips and never set eyes upon a Duggleby Bin. Rag and bone men who will happily clasp to their bosoms the most noisome detritus will look askance and pass on to examine something filthy and worm-eaten rather than hoist a Duggleby Bin on to their cart.\nIt was with very little publicity, then, that last week saw the launch of the Duggleby Bin Appreciation Society. Its mission statement says that the Society aims to \"revive, preserve, and enthuse about Duggleby Bins\", although a footnote in the inaugural Newsletter reveals that not one of the founding members actually owns one, or has ever seen a genuine Duggleby Bin.

However, I now wish to alert readers to the possibility that things may quieten down for a week or so, the reason being that a critical stage has been reached in the production of this year's Lulu paperback. Yes!, fear not, fairly soon now your Christmas-present-purchasing-befuddlement will be washed away, like the blood of the lamb, with the publication of another fat (350 pages or thereabouts) anthology of mighty lopsided prose, direct from Mr Key's pea-sized yet pulsating brain to the printed page!\nThe mind-numbing business of bashing the book together is at an advanced stage, formatting the text and proofreadnig and reformatting the text, etcetera etcetera ad nauseam.. This ought to be a simple matter, but as the ever-reliable Mr Fadhley, who directs the operation, points out, the programme used to create the book \"was designed by nerds for nerds and is monstrously complex\". Think of that when, eventually, you clutch the treasured tome in your dainty little hands, as tiny as Scriabin's, if that is an approximate description of your hands, though I realise it may not be. You may have huge hairy paws. It matters not.\nSo for the next few days at least I will be trying to tackle the remaining monstrous complexities. Should anything momentous bubble up in my cranium I shall try to post it here, but I thought it worth alerting you that things may quieten down just a tad.\nMeanwhile, you might want to make a day trip to Beccles.\n###"}
{"prompt": "By Hot Air Balloon To Hoon\n", "completion": " \nWe travelled to Hoon by hot air balloon. I took my harpoon, and impaled a wolf that was roaming the woodland below us. We hauled the wolf into the basket of our balloon, by a long and sturdy rope that was tied to the end of the harpoon. We arrived in Hoon, two balloonists and an impaled wolf, making a bumpy landing. The Hoon Head Honcho of Hunted Wolves was there to greet us. \"I will have that wolf,\" he said, \"It is not yours to keep. Here in Hoon we keep all hunted wolves, including those that have been impaled by a harpoon shot from a hot air balloon.\" But we wanted to keep our harpooned wolf, as a rug for the basket of our balloon, so I pulled the harpoon out of the wolf and pointed it at the man from Hoon. \"We shall keep our wolf. If you try to take it you will feel the point of this harpoon upon your neck,\" I said. We did not know that the man from Hoon was a Wolfman. His head changed shape, and then the rest of him, and with his savage claws he tore the silken fabric of our balloon. We were trapped in Hoon, helpless among the Wolfmen.\nSource : Victorian Tales Of Derring-Do In Hoon & Its Hinterland\n###"}

The creature appeared a distinct miniature effigy of a man. The shape of the limbs was clearly traceable, and two little brown tentacles of arms with rudimentary hands lay, one by the side and the other half over the breast. Bits of the earth from which it had been torn still clung in the indentations of the shape, and on the top of the head, mingling with the tufts of hair, were the shrivelled remains of a stalk which had been removed or had mouldered away.

Dobsonmore will later incorporate an online shop where people can purchase exclusively the long-awaited Dobson ePamphlets (out of e-print), in partnership with Frank Key's publishers worldwide, and is ultimately intended to become an online reading experience, extending the relevance of Dobson to new generations of readers, while still appealing to existing fans. As the Dobsonmore Shop develops, it is intended that it should include further products designed specifically for Dobson fans, offering a potential outlet for Blodgett Global Domination Enterprises GmbH products and services related to Dobsonmore. In keeping with Dobson's international appeal, the site will launch in English, Afrikaans, Ugric, Ket, Generic BBC Drama Peasant, and Glosa, with more languages to follow.\nIn the new website, the storyline will be brought to life with sumptuous newly-commissioned illustrations and interactive 'Moments' through which you can navigate, starting with the first appearance of Dobson bent over his escritoire, scribbling. On entering, you choose a foolish username and begin your experience. As you move through the chapters, you can read and share exclusive writing from Frank Key, and, just as Dobson barges through the door of his dilapidated hovel, so can you. You visit Pointy Town, get sorted into a chalet, write pamphlets and chuck pebbles at swans...\nThat's quite enough of a rewritten press release to be going on with.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Pier\n", "completion": " To a great many people, and I am here to say that I am one of them, a seaside resort cannot stake a great claim on interest or affection unless it has a pier. More perhaps than speeches or proclamations, the one fact that convinced many Englishmen in 1940 that the nation was really up against it was when detachments of Royal Engineers at every resort and with precision blew great gaps in our beloved piers so that they could not be used as landing stages by the Germans then threatening seaborne invasion.\nThis affection for the pier can be doubtless proved to have psycholgical implications, particularly to any Freudians left in the audience. That rigid object penetrating the loved or hostile ocean from the anchorage of the land--well, as long as you know how to spell phallus you can barely go wrong.\nAnthony Hern, The Seaside Holiday : The History of the English Seaside Resort (Cresset 1967)\n###"}

He was a poster boy for the greaves of way-o, big grinning fangs and a lopsided hat, and no pal of haddo-haddo. Every Thursday he brought home an eel, already dead, and he chopped it up on the sideboard with his mighty hatchet, and then he fed it to the cat.\nI was trained in botany, because I became musto. I was alert to both the ticks and the tocks, given my upbringing. I had a lot of lanterns. Remember this was fenland, flat and wet, no haddo-haddo here. They used to give me a new biro on my birthday but I always lost them soon enough. The greaves of way-o were big on biros then, I remember, especially in the fens.\nI had by musto my ha'penny salt tokens. In those days my management skills were second to none.

{"prompt": "Name That Cur\n", "completion": " One of the most common misconceptions in the world of cur-nomenclature is the idea that many dogs bear the name Fido because its Latin meaning (I trust or I am faithful) has some bearing on perceptions of canine personality. Dobson, for one, saw through this nonsense, as he explained in his out-of-print pamphlet On The Naming Of Curs As Fido : A Stern Corrective. He wrote:\nWhat never seems to occur to people is that there is not one single recorded instance of any dog being called Fido prior to World War II*. This stark fact alone is surely all the evidence any rational person needs to realise that dogs are named Fido in honour of the Petroleum Warfare Department's successful development of the \"fog, intensive dispersal of\" system, otherwise known as FIDO. I cannot be bothered to go into the details of how, in 1944, boffins managed to make mist and fog vanish, for all the world like mediaeval magicians, but they did, God knows they did. Furthermore, the connection between dogs and fog is well known, as anyone who has studied some of my earlier pamphlets will know.\n\nA fairly standard type of cur\n* NOTE : Much as one admires the magisterial tone of Dobson's pronouncement, he is, of course, quite mistaken.\n###"}

And voila!, here it is:\n\"The other case, as related by Van Swieten, in his commentaries upon Boerhaave, is that of a learned man, who had studied, till be fancied his legs to be of glass: in consequence of which he durst not attempt to stir, but was constantly under anxiety about them. His maid bringing one day some wood to the fire, threw it carelessly down; and was severely reprimanded by her master, who was terrified not a little for his legs of glass.

The dirty habits and gross feeding of the early natives of Britain, as well as of all other uncivilized people, rendered this malady common; but at the time in which Prince Bladud lived, no cure for it was known to the Britons. Being highly infectious, therefore, all persons afflicted with it were not only held in disgust and abhorrence, but, by the barbarous laws of the times, were doomed to be driven from the abodes of their fellow-creatures, and to take their chance of life or death in the forests and the deserts, exposed alike to hunger and to beasts of prey.\" -- Robert W Shoppell, The Afflicted Prince\n###"}

{"prompt": "Interrogation\n", "completion": " In a comment on Knitting & Catastrophe, someone calling themselves \"Who are you?\" gets very prickly and accuses me of all sorts of perfidy. I am assuming this must be Dr Jonathan Faiers himself, familiar as he is with the contents of Dr Faiers' email inbox.\nI wrote to him, you see, to alert him to the fact that the film Sightseers is a splendid example of knitting and catastrophe in the cinema. And I wrote because I think \"knitting and catastrophe in the cinema\" is a brilliant, brilliant theme, for which Dr Faiers should be applauded. Alas, he ignored that praise, preferring to become enraged by my comments about the deadly horror of academic prose--all those \"interrogations\"--and heaped insult and invective upon me. Which rather goes to prove my point--he is clearly capable of writing vivid prose, so why must he couch his lecture in such clogged-up blather?\nAnyway, I mention this as an excuse to direct your attention to a comment by David Thompson, which neatly summarises everything that is wrong with academic art talk, specifically \"interrogations\" (and \"explorations\"):\nA while ago, I suggested a drinking game involving random art press releases. Every time you spot the word 'explores' or 'interrogates' you take a swig of tequila. Oblivion would beckon very quickly indeed. These words are all but obligatory--it's a way to signal phony intellectual heft--and given the context, they're usually meaningless. The particulars of this alleged mental activity--all this exploring and interrogating--never seem to be stated clearly, and no conclusions ever seem to be reached or announced to the public. But that's because these words aren't meant to refer to reality. You'll see they're used pretty much randomly. They're just there to let the credulous punter know that the artist is supposed to be clever and therefore deserving of attention and taxpayer subsidy.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Maori Factotum\n", "completion": " Close to the ruins of Eynsford Castle, Philip [Heseltine / Peter Warlock] shared the small main-street cottage with his composer friend, E. J. Moeran, together with a collection of cats and a Maori housekeeper-cum-factotum, Hal Collins (Te Akau) (d. 1929). Collins had previously been a barman at a London drinking club. [Cecil] Gray gave this intriguing description of him:\n\"In contra-distinction to this more or less floating population of cats and women, a permanent member of the establishment was a strange character called Hal Collins . . . whose Maori grandmother had been a cannibal and used, within his memory, to lament the passing of the good old days when she could feast upon her kind. Besides being a graphic artist of considerable talent, particularly in woodcut, he was one of those people who, without ever having learned a note of music or received a lesson in piano playing, have an inborn technical dexterity and a quite remarkable gift for improvisation. He used to compose systematically, also, but without being able to write it down; I remember him once playing to me a whole act of an opera he had conceived on the subject of Tristram Shandy . . . He subsisted chiefly on stout, of which he consumed gargantuan quantities, and when elated would perform Maori war dances with quite terrifying realism. On spirits, however, he would run completely amok, in true native fashion, and on one occasion almost succeeded in massacring the entire household.\"\nAnother snippet from Peter Warlock : The Life Of Philip Heseltine by Barry Smith (1994)\n###"}

We cut the clenches and take off the relic of ignorance and barbarism, throwing it with hearty good-will into the only place fit to receive it--the pile of scrap-iron.\"--John E Russell, Rational Horse-Shoeing, 1873\nIn this passage, Russell is clearly casting aside \"ignorance and barbarism\", perhaps to atone for the mayhem caused by his earlier work Irrational Horse-Shoeing. It was the latter book which had a profound influence on Dobson, who is known to have read it from cover to cover at least forty times. Of course, the pamphleteer had no interest in horses per se--he could barely tell a Knabstrup from a Yonaguni with his glasses on--but the panting urgency of Russell's prose style as he describes various completely bonkers approaches to shoeing horses was something Dobson spent his entire curdled and despicable life trying to match.

{"prompt": "I Am A Willow Warbler\n", "completion": " The willow warbler is a type of bird which warbles in willows. I am not a bird--obviously!--but I, too, have warbled in willows. It is a simple enough matter. What you do is locate a clump of willows, then wander into the midst of them, and start warbling. You can then describe yourself as a willow warbler, perhaps when, at a sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece, you are approached by a fellow guest who asks you what you do. \"I am a willow warbler\", you can say, truthfully.\nAmong the various definitions given for warble in the OED, the one I find particularly helpful is \"To twitter, as a young bird; to make uncertain attempts at singing\". This is my kind of warbling, because, frankly, I cannot sing for toffee. But there is nothing to stop me making \"uncertain attempts\" at singing, in the midst of a clump of willows, whenever the mood takes me. And take me it often does!, to the point of mania.\nI have a varied repertoire of songs which I warble--or sing uncertainly--on my willowy jaunts. Land Of Ladies by the Brothers Johnson, Vienna by Ultravox, Boom Bang-A-Bang by Lulu, and Nunc dimittis servum tuum by The Toofles are among my favourites. I struggle with the words--and tunes--of all of them, but that is par for the course with warbling. Occasionally I am shot at by farmers.\n\n###"}

This led some neighbours on our council estate to surmise that my Pa was a Soviet spy.

Unfortunately I don't have a photograph, doctored or otherwise, of my father in his Communist headgear.\n\nOne of the amusing things about all the nitwit fans losing their marbles over supposed BBC perfidy is that there must be thousands of photographs of Corbyn wearing self-styled \"revolutionary\" attire.

{"prompt": "Our Ancestors\n", "completion": " Patrick Delany was an 18th century Irish clergyman, a friend of Jonathan Swift, who--among other writings--produced fifteen issues of a weekly entitled The Humanist in 1757. Among topics addressed in its pages were: the renouncing of docked tails for horses; the lawfulness of eating blood; the procreation of man after the Flood; and the advantages of polygamy.\nWas The Humanist a forerunner of Hooting Yard? I think it was! Here is Delany announcing his intentions in the first issue: the paper \"would interest itself in all the concerns of human nature ... which means not only amusement ... but likewise something more than mere amusement ... being calculated to convey some little useful and entertaining knowledge of various kinds, historical, classical, natural, moral, and now and then a little religion\".\nOne other note about Delany: he was highly ambitious and lived extravagantly beyond his means. At his parish outside Dublin, he decided to improve the grounds, and the few acres of land were subjected to an attempt to show how \"the obdurate and straight line of the Dutch might he softened into a curve, the terrace melted into a swelling bank, and the walks opened to catch the vicinal country.\"\nIn An Epistle Upon An Epistle (1730), Swift recounted his follies:\nBut you, forsooth, your all must squander\n  On that poor spot, call'd Dell-ville, yonder;\n  And when you've been at vast expenses\n  In whims, parterres, canals and fences,\n  Your assets fail, and cash is wanting;\n  Nor farther buildings, farther planting;\n  No wonder when you raise and level,\n  Think this wall low, and that wall bevel.\n  Here a convenient box you found,\n  Which you demolish'd to the ground;\n  Then built, then took up with your arbour,\n  And set the house to Rupert Barber.\n###"}

The idea was that each week, a couple of contestants (Brian from Swanage and Carol from Jaywick) would stare at a photograph of a pond for fifteen minutes, then, after the advert break, use their skill, judgment, and cherished religious beliefs to work out which pond they'd been looking at. Stephen Fry would be on hand to help them, because he's so clever.\nIt's a quandary, but in the end I think I will have to get back to the teenage television person and say No, No, No. But that's no reason why you, my loyal readers, should be deprived of the wholesome family entertainment such a game provides.

{"prompt": "Accidents Will Happen\n", "completion": " An item in yesterday's Guardian mentioned the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (ROSPA). Let us consider the wonderful mysticism of that title. First, it is \"Royal\", imbued with a lordly, monarchist ethos far above the common herd of humankind. Then, it is a \"Society\", a fraternity or sorority one supposes, an esoteric band of adepts, sworn together by bonds of ritual secrecy. And on what purpose are they bent, these shadowy yet somehow noble figures? Nothing less than the \"Prevention of Accidents\"! If one thinks of an accident as an Act of God, which must surely be a common definition, then here we have a group dedicated to averting or undoing the whims of the Almighty. Whether that is heroic or abominable, it is incontrovertibly blasphemous. And so we find, lurking behind the innocuous \"ROSPA\", that myth-shrouded medieval organisation the Mystical Order of Divine Saboteurs.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Found At A Jumble Sale\n", "completion": " At a jumble sale last week, I was delighted to pick up a bundle of Dennis Beerpint poetry books for less than the price of a toffee apple. Well, I say books, but these are leaflets really, of between four and twelve pages each, printed with a Gestetner machine in the early 1970s. Here at Hooting Yard we think Beerpint is a criminally overlooked versifier, often subjected to critical maulings when he ought justly be garlanded with laurels.\nMuch of the material in these forgotten publications sees Beerpint finding his voice, and admittedly that voice was still a little shaky at this early stage in his career. I was struck, however, by the odd gem such as Illness, which begins:\nOh how dark the night is / When you've got meningitis\nand by Being A Bee, with its wonderfully evocative couplet\nI do as I do and I does as I does / And what I do and does is buzz\nI think it is lines like these that fool people into thinking Beerpint \"twee\", or a peddler of doggerel. This seems a particularly fatuous accusation when one considers titanic works of poesy such as Lines Upon The Death Of Dag Hammarskjold In A Plane Crash (September 1961), with its vibrant \"pluckety-pluck\" rhythms, massive resonance, reach, vigour, gargantuan ambition, deliberately blurred vision, knock-kneed tremblement, sourness, decisively windswept atmosphere, implacability, tartness, muscular bounding strides, and bravery in confronting, head-on, conundrums of global significance. It ends with this Beerpintian flourish:\nO Dag! Alenda lux ubi orta libertas / I've reserved a pew at your Requiem Mass\nWho else could have written that?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Rant\n", "completion": " Perhaps the novelist Julian Barnes is to blame, since his novel Flaubert's Parrot was a huge bestseller. I haven't read it myself, so offer no opinion. What bothers me is that the title of the book has seemingly cast a spell over the entire British publishing industry. That format--[historical figure]'s + [everyday or whimsical object]--now infests the shelves of our bookshops to the point of teeth-gnashing despair. At first, only fiction caught the bug--Hemingway's Chair and Lenin's Trousers spring to mind--but once non-fiction contracted the virus, the plague was unstoppable. Yesterday, browsing desultorily in Waterstone's, I came upon the following within about five minutes: Pandora's Breeches; Wittgenstein's Poker; Rembrandt's Whore; Dorothy Parker's Elbow; and Schopenhauer's Porcupines, not to mention Schopenhauer's Telescope. I could go on, but I already feel quite ill.\nA significant side-effect of this wretchedness is that in some cases one suspects the very content of the book has been twisted to fit the title. Giles Milton's Nathaniel's Nutmeg was ostensibly a history of the early spice trade, a subject of interest in itself. But because of the imperatives of the title, the author buoys up a single character--Captain Nathaniel Courthope--and gives him an importance in the narrative that is simply unjustifiable. I have no doubt that Giles Milton knows this, and knows that it damages his book, but bows to what is required by theBritish publishing industry--a contemptible, money-grubbing, market-driven playground for the alumni of Oxford and Cambridge universities, rife with nepotism. Even the witless goons who run it must surely learn when enough is enough?\nThis is one reason, of course, why Hooting Yard appears on the web. Renamed Sir Matt Busby's Cistern or Spinoza's Rhubarb, it would probably attract a five-figure advance ... but only if the content were tailored to meet the requirements of the intellectually bankrupt poltroons who sign the cheques. I prefer to plough my lonely furrow. End of rant.\n###"}
{"prompt": "A Cautionary Tale\n", "completion": " I bashed my bonce upon a shelf, dislodging from it a tiny elf. It toppled down on to the floor and scampered out through my front door. I followed it as best I could, all the way into a wood. The wood was mostly larch and lime, and the elf was bent on an awful crime. I watched as it picked a woodcutter's pocket. As it ran away I tried to block it. Then I saw its face, the hideous elf. It looked uncannily like Will Self. I fainted away in shock and fright, and when I awoke it was deepest night. The woodcutter led me to a glade and gave me tea and marmalade. I spooned it straight out from the jar, then we got into the woodcutter's car and drove around in the pitch dark, thinking it would be a lark. But it was not--for we came a-cropper, and were arrested by a copper. He took us to the local nick, where I began to feel quite sick. Locked in a cell, I bewailed my fate. Then the elf came in, fair oozing hate. He bashed me on my bonce again, and then he turned into a hen. Not any hen--one with no head. And then I woke up in my bed. It had all been a terrible dream occasioned by too much ice cream. So, tinies, make sure you behave yourselves, or you'll be beset by hens and elves, by a headless hen, and a terrible elf who looks exactly like Will Self.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Summa Theologica\n", "completion": " Things have been quiet here for a while. That is because I have been concentrating on completing my masterwork, the Summa Theologica. As its title indicates, this is a theological summary which attempts to explain the ways of God to Man--or at least to my readership. It has involved untold research, over many years, the collection of thousands, if not millions, of notes, all written painstakingly in pencil on Nabokovian index cards. Now at last I have set about the task of marshalling all this into a coherent narrative that is at once jaw-droppingly erudite and also as readable as any airport bookstall blockbuster.\nThe opening sentence is, in a sense, the summa theologica of the Summa Theologica. Having consulted my notes, I wrote:\nIt is blindingly obvious, to even the most dim-witted and wet-behind-the-ears six-year-old, that there is only one god, all-powerful and all-knowing, and that is the hideous bat-god Fatso.\nUnfortunately, after writing this, I reached an impasse. It is, indeed, blindingly obvious, so what else is there to say? The simple truth is that we must all bow down or, better, prostrate ourselves upon our bellies, like the creatures that creep upon the earth, before the terrible countenance of the hideous bat-god Fatso, for ever and ever Amen. If you do not grasp that fact, then you are doomed, yea unto the umpteenth generation, and you will eat nought but nettles and drink nothing but evaporated milk flavoured with the bitter tears of grumpy German film directors, and you will be dressed in rags, and the rags will be besmirched with the blood of slaughtered innocents, and your limbs will flail helplessly, and your brain will boil.\nIf you require further evidence of the unflinchingly brutal reality of the hideous bat-god Fatso, see here.\n###"}

I was with a friend and his Scottish grandfather. My abiding memory of the adventure is that the grandfather whacked me on the elbow--hard--with his golf club. He insisted it was an accident. Hmm.\nTo which my correspondent replied:\nThanks for that piece of information--I am wondering whether the disclosure of the grandfather's nationality is a mere embellishment, or actually a key detail of the tale.\nWithout giving the matter much, or indeed any, thought, I replied immediately to say that I thought the detail highly significant.

{"prompt": "A Slim Volume of Twee Verse\n", "completion": " It is quite a while since anything has been heard from the poet Gervase Beerpint, author of Homage To Neurasthenia and Do You Know The Way To Sin, Jose?*, so it is with something akin to breathless overexcitement that his publishers announce a forthcoming volume, his first since the cataclysmic events of Bastardgate engulfed John Major's Conservative administration of 1990 to 1997.\n\nProvocatively entitled A Slim Volume Of Twee Verse, Beerpint's latest is a huge slab of a book. Truman Capote said of Kerouac's On The Road that \"it's not writing, it's typing\", and one feels that were Mr C still with us, he would make the same waspish remark about the torrent of verbiage spewed across these pages. It is difficult to know what to make of a work that steadfastly refuses to engage the reader in any way. At times it reads like an ironmongery catalogue for upwards of a hundred pages, then without warning the poet launches into his own (incompetent) Tagalog translation of the Book of Isaiah.

His is not a pleasant figure to contemplate, though it is one that we all see very often and know very well--clothed irreproachably in the most expensive raiment that London tailors and unlimited credit can supply. He lives lazily and luxuriously on his father's money and his wife's, and, being after his natural term of days laid away in a tomb at Mt. Auburn, ends his existence without making any more impression upon the world's history than a falling rose leaf, or an August cricket's faintest chirp.\"\n\"In 1885 we were informed of the success of spirits at Cleveland, Ohio, in communicating messages by the telegraphic method in rapping, in which our millionaire friend, Mr. J. H. Wade, has taken much interest. A little apparatus has been constructed, with which the spirits give their communications in great variety. I have repeatedly stated that the diagnoses and prescriptions of deceased physicians have always proved in my experience more reliable than those of the living. This has been verified at Cleveland. The late Dr. Wells of Brooklyn has been giving diagnoses and prescriptions through the telegraph.\"\nI think we can agree with the correspondent of the Vineland Rostrum, who said of the Journal's editor J R Buchanan \"We never read an article from the pen of this world-renowned thinker, but that we feel we are in the presence of one whose shoes' latchet we are unworthy to unloose\".\nMany thanks to Odd Ends.\n###"}
{"prompt": "A Lucky Find\n", "completion": " Burrowing through the dust-caked and tottering piles in Old Pa Dustcake's secondhand bookshop the other day, I was delighted to light upon a copy of Pebblehead's absurdly precocious autobiography I, Pebblehead! Published when he was still wet behind the ears, it was his first bestselling paperback. The fact that he was completely unknown to the world when he wrote it, and had lived so short and uneventful a life up to that point, makes its astounding success all the more bewildering. The prose is callow, clunky, and at times incoherent, the narrative devoid of incident save for the famous hydroelectric power station picnic explosion disaster and its aftermath, to which an entire, lengthy chapter is devoted. Yet the presses kept rolling as more and more copies had to be printed to satisfy the public's seemingly hysterical demand. One observer calculated that more copies were sold than there are stars in the heavens. That being so, one might think it would be an easy title to track down, in shops such as Old Pa Dustcake's, even so many years after publication. But one hardly ever sees a copy for sale. One explanation, which I find quite convincing, is that a flaw in the binding caused the majority of the books to fall apart when touched by human skin. Luckily, when I was rummaging in the shop, I was wearing my sinister black mittens, simply to strike a pose, you understand.\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "Cat\n", "completion": " Curiosity killed the cat. But a cat has nine lives, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even eight instances of overweening and perilous curiosity will not prove ultimately fatal. It is the ninth instance that a cat has to worry about. But it will not worry, because it is ineradicably stupid. And thus, when its curiosity is piqued, for the ninth time, by a stray strand of string or a minuscule insect creeping along the wainscot, the cat will not pause to consider that this time, ah!, this time, there will be no coming back from the death it dallies with. It is not that the cat is brave, reckless, valiant. It is stupid, and it cannot count.\nYou would do well, then, if you care for a cat, and wish to protect it from harm, to teach it elementary arithmetic. Place the cat on a stool, and arm yourself with a series of flashcards on which the digits from 1 to 9 are written in clear big bold black sanserif. You need not bother with zero. No cat's brain could ever cope with that concept.\nThe instruction of cats can prove highly exasperating, so you are advised to take some sort of bottled calmative elixir before starting. Drum the digits, and their significance, into the cat's bonce. Check its progress with regular tests. If it leaves the stool, for example to pursue a stray strand of wool or a minuscule insect on the wainscot or, worse, a birdie in the garden, haul it back, replace it on the stool, and give it a ticking off.\nBe warned that there is every possibility you will die before the cat has grasped the essentials. But you will die happy in the knowledge that you preserved the cat from harm for as long as you could, and left your considerable fortune to it in your last will and testament, to ensure it wants for nothing in this mortal world.\n###"}

A more fitting title would have been Feisty Bookworm And The Prince With Bad Table Manners. Belle, the Beauty, as played by Emma Watson, is feisty, and a bookworm. The only other thing to note about her character is that she has a rather problematic relationship with her father's horse, but we shall come to that.\nThe putative Beast (one Dan Stevens) is hardly bestial. I was expecting something like the Grunty Man, that awful figure of children's nightmares. Other than being a bit hairy, sporting a pair of goaty horns, and growling occasionally, this so-called Beast seems perfectly civilised. He speaks in a mellifluous RADA-trained voice not unlike that of the late Alan Rickman, and has a well-stocked library. The extent of his bestiality seems to be that he slurps his soup straight from the bowl. Franz Kafka had worse table manners (his father used to hide behind the newspaper when dining with FK).\nNow, about that horse. Its name is Philippe. The Feisty Bookworm arrives at the castle astride Philippe. We then see neither hide nor hair of the horse until, after an indeterminate period--days? weeks? months?--the Beast frees the Bookworm so she can rescue her father from imminent incarceration in a lunatic asylum. Suddenly, there is Philippe, fit as a fiddle, ready to gallop back to the village. Where has he been all this time? The Feisty Bookworm has expressed not a jot of concern for him, and we have seen no sign of a stable, nor even a trough.

{"prompt": "The Expurgated Lovecraft\n", "completion": " The other day I met a man who has devoted the past several years to a singular literary project. His aim is to produce a bowdlerised version of the complete works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which all reference to the spine-tingling and the spooky, the eldritch and the uncanny, is expunged. I was able immediately to grasp the value of this scheme. Lovecraft is a fascinating writer, but there must be many potential readers who are deterred from his work because, quite frankly, they do not wish to get the collywobbles. Excise the spine-tingling and the spooky, the eldritch and the uncanny, and an entire new constituency of fans will be created.\nI asked my new friend how he went about the creation of an expurgated Lovecraft. He explained that he began by simply deleting all the terrifying adjectives, adverbs, verbs and nouns. This had the unintended consequence of rendering much of Lovecraft's prose \"bitty and near-incomprehensible\", as he put it. Whole passages were reduced to strings of prepositions. Though commendably brief, the resulting text lacked heft. So then, he said proudly, his real work began. He realised that he could reinstate a certain amount of readability, and up the word-count, by replacing, for example, Shoggoth with a pretty vase of flowers, or hideous tentacles with gambolling bunny rabbits. I pointed out to him that some people--not least myself--found rabbits utterly frightening, and he promised to look again at his revisions.\nThen he bid me farewell, and I sat alone at the cafe table, mercilessly correlating all the contents of my mind.\n###"}

For that reason, here at Hooting Yard we have taken it upon ourselves to educate our readers by providing some cardinal do's and don'ts. Read, ponder, and digest, and never again will you stand accused of glue-related tomfoolery.\n1. Never use glue to stick your head to something it ought not be glued to. For example, you should avoid gluing your head to the nest of a being which will suck out your brains.\n2. Do not confuse glue with gum. Some gum can be chewed--indeed, such gum is often called 'chewing gum'. You cannot chew glue, and you will rue the day you do, should you be such a nincompoop so to do.\n3. Make sure you read Dobson's various pamphlets on the subject of glue, all of which are highly informative. I particularly recommend The Adhesive Properties Of Six Hundred Different Types Of Glue, With Diagrams (out of print, but sometimes salvageable from rubbish tips in the vicinity of glue-making factories). This pamphlet has been condemned by a number of commentators as being a farrago of lies and bile, written by Dobson in order to exact revenge upon one of his enemies, but you should read it anyway, for even if the so-called facts with which it is packed are false and inaccurate, you will still learn much enabling you to hold your own in any argument concerning glue.\n4. Some glues are designed for very specific purposes. For example, library paste is thick and glutinous, whereas mucilage is thin, clear and gelatinous.

{"prompt": "The R Numbers\n", "completion": " 1. For reasons which remain obscure to me, the text of John Ruskin's Praeterita is arranged in numbered paragraphs. At least, such is the case with the Everyman edition which I am reading. I have seen other versions where the numbering is absent. This practice is not a substitute for, but rather an addition to, the conventional division of the text into chapters. The numbering, however, is continuous through the chapters, so that, for example, Chapter II of Volume I (\"Herne-Hill Almond Blossoms\") begins with paragraph number 36. The book was originally published in three volumes, and each has its paragraphs separately numbered, so that Volume I contains paragraphs numbered 1 to 260 in twelve chapters, Volume II 1 to 235 in twelve chapters, and Volume III 1 to 86 in four chapters, at which point Ruskin abandoned it.\n2. The numbering of paragraphs does not support a critical apparatus appended to the book, such as a commentary, notes, or what have you. Hence my perplexity. It appears to be simply idiosyncratic.\n3. I have noticed, while reading, that my eyes tend to glance over the numbers without registering them. And yet, when I first opened the book, and saw the numbering, I found it very pleasing. I cannot quite articulate why. Of course, it acts as a handy aide memoire for any nuggets of arresting Ruskinian prose one wants to recall. However, I think there have been quite enough quotations from Mr R. posted at Hooting Yard over recent months.\n4. I am not sure what, if anything, is the purpose of this post, other than to practise a bit of paragraph-numbering off my own bat. In my experience, it is these odd and inconsequential postages which attract a greater number of comments than usual. We shall see.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Mincing Corsair\n", "completion": " Many moons have passed since we last received a letter of complaint from Dr Ruth Pastry, but she has at last been stirred into action. The following email arrived the other day:\nDear Mr Key : I was disturbed to note, in your item headed Petrochemical Shiver-Me-Timbers Conclave (20th December 2004), that you unthinkingly preceded the word corsair with bloodthirsty. This is not only a cliche, but also panders to the stereotype of corsairs as violent maniacs who careen around the decks of sailing ships off the Barbary Coast with gleaming cutlasses clenched between their equally gleaming teeth. I have met many corsairs in my time, and not one of them bears any resemblance to this nonsensical image. Indeed, the corsair with whom I was best acquainted, in that he was my fiance for a few months in the early 1970s, was a gentle soul named Federico Dellapiccola de Grunwald, who spoke with a pronounced lisp and whose usual form of locomotion, when he wasn't prancing, was to mince. I do not think he had ever been near a cutlass in his life. Much of his time, whenever he was absent from his buccaneering privateer ship, was spent raising rhododendrons and dahlias, holding raffles in aid of the local orphanage, and gambolling o'er green fields with puppies and flopsy-tailed bunny rabbits. Next time you write about corsairs, please be more accurate. Yours fuming, Ruth Pastry.\n###"}

My trip abroad, followed by a period of feeling like death warmed up, has led to a sort of unplanned holiday from Hooting Yard and indeed from Het Internet generally. After bashing out three hundred and twenty essays in three hundred and twenty days, not to mention a myriad of other postages, it is with some relief that I have refrained from tippy-tapping sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose.\nHowever, this does mean that I have failed to impart to you much decisive information, without which you are probably wandering the earth lost, twitching and shattered. I am thinking, for example, of a recent dream, in the course of which I attended a party at a retirement home for outrageous old thespians of the Donald Sinden stripe. One of these ageing hams was swaddled from head to foot in cloth of the deepest crimson, bemoaning that he had devoted his life to interpreting a minor character in a minor work by a minor dramatist. We then gathered for a screening of In Search Of The Most Pious Man : A Life Of Jesus, a film directed by Carrington Holmes.\nI have tried, in my waking hours, to discover more about the dream film and the dream film director, to no avail. It seems neither of them actually exists. They ought to.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Modern Pig Revisited\n", "completion": " Some months ago we turned our attention to the modern pig, and I am pleased to post this letter received from Outa_Spaceman in which he recalls his very own modern pig experience:\nMany years ago one of my 'in-between-jobs' was as a security guard. I had to look after a 'pig trap'. It looked like a bungalow-sized oil refinery, all red painted pipes, valves and exciting gauges. It was positioned in a small village called Lofthouse at the top of Nidderdale.\nThe 'intelligent' pig (iPig?) had been inserted at Billingham and trundled down the pipeline inspecting and cleaning as it went. Boffins monitored its progress, via in-built T.V. cameras, in a portakabin alongside the pig trap. My job was to make sure no yokels attempted to interfere with the installation, as the pipeline carried a highly explosive pressurised gas (methane I think).\nAt the end of my night-long vigil I decided to stay and wait for the pig to arrive and watch the trap being 'blown'. Frantic boffin activity, lots of valve opening and closing, the pig arrived in the trap and the methane burnt off. It created the biggest sheet of flame I've ever seen and, even though I was a good way off, singed my eyebrows. After tests and recalibration the pig was reinserted and sent off toward Stanlow.\nFor me the most amazing fact is that there's a pipeline that connects one side of the country to the other via the Pennines.\n###"}

In this respect he was absolutely uncanny, a person to be discussed and analyzed in remote rooms or upon quiet walks. Sam never talked about these supernatural powers, and so far as I know the Society for Psychical Research never had him under inspection, but he had these powers, abnormally, unhumanly developed, not only had them, but used them, nightly...

{"prompt": "Boogie Woogie\n", "completion": " One of the most common difficulties facing newcomers to the teachings of Trebizondo Culpeper is the complete absence, anywhere, of boogie, coupled with the almost terrifying prevalence, throughout, of woogie.\nIn his magisterial if incoherent Syncretic Glossary Of The \"Way\" Of Trebizondo Culpeper, J K Pox devotes some three hundred pages to what he calls \"the boogie-woogie conundrum\". One can argue that there is no conundrum, but that doesn't stop Pox harping on about it. As ever, he is flamboyant, and one must admire his refusal to define his terms, as if in doing so the magic, if magic it is, would leach out of them.\n\"When thunder claps and wolves howl,\" he writes, \"When the sedge is wither'd on the lake, and gigantic mutant crustaceans come a-clattering on to the sandbanks, then, then! my sweet dear ones, is when we are most tempted to admit into our souls some sort of boogie. Squash the very thought underfoot, as one might a fig during a fig-glut. No, there is not and never has been and never will be boogie, if we follow the Way with eyes bright and brows clean. There is only woogie, blessed, blossoming and blanketing, at once tough as nails and chewy as the king and queen of toffees. So we are taught by Trebizondo Culpeper and so we have embroidered upon our pullovers. Link arms and sing, as snow falls and tinkly things tinkle. Sing!\"\nPox does not go on to say what song it is his readers and students should be singing. To do so may have been psychologically impossible for him, for as we know he was, when young, expelled from the Conservatoire before his studies had properly begun, following the incident described in pages 45 to 64 of Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The Gummed-Up Tuba And The Worm-Eaten Spinet.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Method Dabbling\n", "completion": " \nMethod acting comes under the spotlight in my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, and I thought it would be interesting to write the piece using the technique of Method writing. The idea is to induce in oneself a state of mind where the only \"writing\" which exists is the tracks of birds in snow--marks that are at once meaningless yet numinous. In this state, \"literature\" has yet to come into being. Prose has to be invented anew. It is as if one were Jeanette Winterson!\nTo get the hang of the momentous task before you, it is a good idea to make a copy of the bird-tracks in the snow, for they are fugitive, and when the snow melts, they will vanish forever. Go to a stationery shop or a post office, and buy a pen and paper. When choosing a pen, say of the ballpoint variety, make sure the tip is about the size of the primitive ganglia which constitute the brain of a lobster.\nOut in the field, learn how to make marks, with the pen upon the paper, which match precisely the patterns made by the tracks of birds in the snow. This is the beginning of writing! Back at home, sat at an escritoire, continue making such marks, but rather than mere copying allow yourself free rein. Sooner or later, you will discover that the marks you are making will, as if by a miracle, form literate prose!\n###"}

{"prompt": "Teetering On The Brink Of Idiocy\n", "completion": " ... speculation continued to flourish in Germany, where a group of young writers, gathered at the University of Jena, began to explore the philosophical ideas of Friedrich Schelling, and what he called Naturphilosophie. This doctrine, perhaps best translated as 'science mysticism', defined the entire natural world as a system of invisible powers and energies, operating like electricity as a series of 'polarities'. According to Schelling's doctrine, the whole world was indeed replete with spiritual energy or soul, and all physical objects 'aspired' to become something higher. There was a 'world-soul' constantly 'evolving' higher life forms and 'levels of consciousness' in all matter, animate or inanimate. All nature had a tendency to move towards a higher state.\nSo carbon for example 'aspired' to become diamond; plants aspired to become sentient animals; animals aspired to become men; men aspired to become part of the Zeitgeist or world spirit. Evolutionary, idealist, electrical and Vitalist ideas were all evidently tangled up in this system, which had an obvious appeal to imaginative writers in the Jena circle like Novalis, Schiller and Goethe, as well as experimental physiologists like Johann Ritter. It had its attractions, not least in its optimism and its sense of reverence for the natural world. But it also constantly teetered on the brink of idiocy. One of its wilder proselytisers, the Scandinavian geologist Henrick Steffens, was said to have stated that 'The diamond is a piece of carbon that has come to its senses'; to which a Scottish geologist, probably John Playfair, made the legendary reply: 'Then a quartz, therefore, must be a diamond run mad'.\nRichard Holmes, The Age Of Wonder : How The Romantic Generation Discovered The Beauty And Terror Of Science (2008).

In my tent they might be counted by thousands; in my slung cot they were by hundreds; on my clothes they were by fifties; on my neck and head they were by scores. The several plagues of locusts, fleas, and lice sink into utter insignificance compared with this fearful one of earwigs. It is true they did not bite, and they did not irritate the cuticle, but what their presence and numbers suggested was something so horrible that it drove one nearly insane to think of it.

Who is he that having read them will not remember with horror the dreadful account given by Speke of his encounters with these pests? My intense nervous watchfulness alone, I believe, saved me from a like calamity.\nMr Webster adds:\nI haven't been able to learn more!

I left my ruined chalet at about the same time as Dobson caught his train. On the first part of the journey--mine, not Dobson's--I was looking at all the life. There were plants and birds and rocks and things, things I was unable to identify, despite having a handy illustrated encyclopaedia in my knapsack. There was sand and hills and rings, abandoned engagement rings, tossed aside in what one must assume were fits of pique. It puzzled me that no one had returned to reclaim them. On I went. Dobson's train was pulling in to Mustard Parva station when the solitude of my journey was at last broken. The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz, and the second thing was a distressed monitor lizard. I fed the fly to the lizard, had a snack myself, and pressed on. Eventually I came to a clump of pugton trees, and I examined them very carefully, and the sand, and the sky with no clouds. The heat was hot and the ground was dry but the air was full of sound. I could have sworn I heard a Bavarian accordion band, but it must have been my imagination. I've been through the desert on a horse with no name. It felt good to be out of the rain.

{"prompt": "The Sick Fairy\n", "completion": " According to David Attenborough on BBC Radio 4's Tweet Of The Day this morning, the sound made by the storm petrel has been described as \"like a fairy being sick\". Conversely, in Lands of Faerie, for example in Cottingley, where the fairies are made of paper, a fairy being sick is compared to a storm petrel.\nOne might find it hard to imagine a fairy, especially a paper one, vomiting. But the Land of Faerie is (mostly) invisible to (most of) us. It is a parallel world where, could we see it, much would be familiar to us, albeit skewed and distorted. So, yes, fairies are sometimes sick, just as we are sometimes sick. But what they vomit up is not the same as what we vomit up. Yes, fairies shop for groceries in supermarkets with an increasing number of self-service tills, but they buy different groceries, in supermarkets which dimly resemble our own, and the protocol for self-service tills is like something from the fourteenth century. Fairies travel on buses, but not on our buses. I could go on.\nDo you want me to go on? Or would you rather I shut up, so you can put on a pair of stout walking boots, and hike out to the seaside, in hope of finding a colony of storm petrels, so you can make a tape recording of their cries, and, later, back home, play it while reading a bedtime story to your tinies, that much-loved story from your own childhood, the one about the oh so delightful fluttering paper fairy that caught a stomach bug and vomited up a mess of fairy pottage, into a fairy bucket, in a little fairy cottage in Cottingley, and they called for a doctor, and the doctor who came hurrying across the fields with his black bag was Dr Arthur Conan Doyle?\n###"}

It was only when the question was put to me that I thought about the possibility of GoogleNod--a vast archive cataloguing all that is contained, not in the \"real\" world, but in the world of dreams.\nThe content of GoogleNod would of course be utterly different to the stuff we find on its parent search engine.

In fact the pair of them were so slow that at first glance I thought they were immobile, posing on the pavement in a tableau vivant, as if to illustrate the subject \"Person With Dog\". On further inspection, however, it became clear that they were both walking along, but imperceptibly, imperceptibly.\nI am not familiar with all the different breeds of dog in the world but in this instance I am prepared to go out on a limb and state, clearly and decisively, that the dog was a mastiff.\nI passed them by and went about my business, a series of errands which took me, in turn, to a tobacconist, an ironmongery, and a post office. Coming out of the post office, I saw something across the road which defied description. Nevertheless, fresh from my triumph at identifying a mastiff, among innumerable dog types, I am going to attempt to describe it. It was indescribably nondescript. That being so, I paid it no further attention, turned on my heel, and made my way home.\nWhen I passed the slow dog and its master, they had progressed perhaps an inch or two along the pavement.\nHome, I decided to listen to the Belly record. Tanya Donelly sings that her slow dog has \"see-through skin, the kind of skin you can see through\".

He would simply tear the nest from his tresses and punch his fist at the hummingbird or wren so that it flew away. But the fop of whom I write was no hater of birds. His love of our winged chums was so great that he was known to some as The Bird-Adoring Fop. Perhaps the hummingbird or wren had, with some avian sixth sense, apprehended this bird-love and chosen the site of its nest accordingly. Or it may have been simply the luxury of the fop's locks, espied from high up in the sky as he reclined languidly on a chaise in a salon, fluttering a perfumed kerchief and sipping some delightful infusion from a bone china cup. Birds cannot speak in human language, so we shall never know. Nor do we know what terrible series of events found the fop, ten days later, facing a firing squad.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Are You A Bird Or A Cow?\n", "completion": " I recently came across a fascinating personality test. Normally, I give short shrift to such things, because they tend to be devised by airheads drunk on a combination of psychobabble and inanity, but this one delighted me. Unfortunately I can't reproduce it here. Rarely have I seen a document so thoroughly protected by copyright, threatening extreme measures up to and including the crushing of one's skull and the sale into slavery of one's descendants, yea unto the fourth generation. Very occasionally I have shown a devil-may-care attitude in the face of such warnings, but I am not an idiot.\nAnyway, as far as I can see, there is nothing to stop me paraphrasing a few questions from the test, so that's what I'll do. It's called \"Are You A Bird Or A Cow?\". I looked in vain for any indication that these are meant as types of human personality, so I can only assume that we are meant to take it literally. Maybe the test is meant to be conducted on behalf of your bird or cow acquaintances who are confused about their identity. That would make perfect sense.\nSo, for example, there are questions like Would you say you were flighty or given to rumination? and Do you prefer standing in a field or perching high in a tree? Please remember that I am only paraphrasing. One question asks specifically whether for breakfast you would prefer to eat millet or cud. Oddly, it doesn't go on to ask about elevenses, lunch, dinner, tea, or supper, and nor is there any mention of snacks. This may indicate a certain laxness in the methodology employed, par for the course with tests such as this, but given the ferocious look on the face of the deviser, whose photograph appears at the top of the first page, I am minded not to level any criticism.\nI completed the test for myself, rather than as a proxy for my crow Martin or for a cow I know called Degustibus, and the results were extremely interesting.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Curse Of The Ground\n", "completion": " The earth has been torn and convulsed as by the spasm of some great agony, and the signs of it lie thick around. Huge beds of rock, thousands of feet in thickness, have been cracked and shivered like potsherds; streams of molten metal have been injected into the fissures, and have surged through the rents and swept vast floods of burning lava over the smiling plains. There must have been times in the history of the development of this earth, fair and calm as it lies now under the sun, when its whole structure must have been shaken to the very centre; when there was dread peril lest, like some lost planet, it should be shattered into fragments and fill its orbit with a cloud of wreck. But some sure hand has helped earth's travail, and has brought forth out of the chaos of struggle and storm an orderly, smiling, serene, and beautiful world. The signs of past agony are there, to those whose eye can pierce the surface; but a loving hand has clothed it all with a glow of beauty and a robe of grace. The regions where the convulsion was fiercest, where the scars are deepest, are the regions of glorious mountain beauty, whither pilgrims wend as to nature's most sacred shrine. The rents and chasms, clothed with the most splendid forests, with streams leaping and sparkling through the emerald meadows to the hollows below, breathe nothing but beauty, and stir all hearts to joy and praise.\nJ Baldwin Brown, Misread Passages Of Scripture (1869)\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Star On The Vest\n", "completion": " Dear Mr Key, writes Dagmar Glossop from Shoeburyness, I recently came upon this terrific photograph at My Ear-Trumpet Has Been Struck By Lightning (where a much, much larger version can be seen), and I fell to wondering if it might be a rare snapshot of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. Please enlighten me.\n\nDear Ms Glossop, I can see immediately why you thought this might be fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. It's that star on his vest. The whizzo sprinter and pole-vaulter never appeared in public without such a star, on the instructions of his catarrh-wracked coach, Old Halob, for whom it had some kind of mystical quality. Unfortunately, however, the dashing young chap in the photograph is not fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. I say this with due authority, based on two unarguable points. One, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, being fictional, was never snapped by any camera wrought by human hand. Two, it is common knowledge that fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol's athletics kit, as well as being emblazoned with a star, was much baggier than the kit seen here. In fact it was inordinately baggy.\n###"}

Julia was a cripple. She was drawn to school by an older sister with rosy cheeks, bright flashing black eyes, and a sprightly animated countenance, and carried into the school-room in the arms of her teacher, or some of the older scholars. And so she came, year after year, mingling with the merry group. But where is she now? Yon little mound of heaped up earth covers her remains, and a narrow marble slab tells the place of her repose, and we can but hope she who was denied the privilege of walking on earth may now soar on angel's wings. This dear child was obliged to crawl from place to place after her more favoured companions, dragging her useless perished limbs behind her. But He who careth for us knew what was best for her, and we cannot doubt His infinite wisdom.\nWould that Edward Gorey were with us still, to illustrate this tear-stained yet uplifting tale!\n###"}
{"prompt": "Remember, Remember\n", "completion": " Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. Remember, too, the case of the distressed pig, solved by Special Agent Blot. The distressed pig was found in a rowing boat crossing Tantarabim Lake. Agent Blot swam out to it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becalmed Agent Blot took the oars and he rowed to the mud-splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of the boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plodded his way in his wellington boots to the pig farmer's hut down the lane, and he felled the brute with a thwack of his fist and bound him up with a chain. Agent Blot dragged the pig farmer off to the prison, bang in the centre of town. And that is why, on November the fifth, the distressed pig did not drown.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Assassination Of Hilary Mantel\n", "completion": " The Guardian today published a short story by Hilary Mantel entitled The Assassination Of Margaret Thatcher. This piece apparently took Ms Mantel thirty years to write, for \"technical reasons\"--\"I just couldn't see how to get [the characters] to work together\". The inference is that she has at last solved the problem, but it seems to me that the characters--an assassin and the woman whose flat he uses to set up his sniper's nest--neither work together nor individually.\nI have always found Mantel a curiously lifeless writer. The popularity of her prize-winning Thomas Cromwell books is a profound mystery, and Beyond Black was spectacularly turgid. In the present story she makes full use of her gift for clunking, tin-eared dialogue.\nMost amusing is the revelation that the original title of the forthcoming collection of stories for which The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher acts as a trailer was Ten Transgressive Tales. Ooh! Transgressive! What could be less transgressive than an infantile fantasy about murdering a Tory prime minister published in the pages of the Guardian?\nFor the next thirty years I intend to work on a story entitled The Assassination of Hilary Mantel. The technical challenge, to drain all life from my prose, will be huge, but hey!, think how transgressive and shocking it will be.\nNOTA BENE : For something genuinely transgressive, see my forthcoming book Tony Benn Was A Complete Wanker.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Oil Painting News\n", "completion": " A recent survey of British tastes in art announced that \"the nation's favourite painting\" was a work called, I think, The Singing Butler by Jack Vettriano. Mr Vettriano is a self-taught painter whose often whimsical realism is, of course, execrated by conceptualist noodleheads and the Saatchi-financed \"Britart\" mafia.\nI wondered if a similar survey were to be conducted in Hooting Yard what the result might be, so I contacted the polling agency run by a sister of suburban shaman Joost Van Dongelbraacke and asked them to find out. The methodology they used was perplexing, so much so that it gives me a splitting headache just thinking about it. In fact I think I am going to go and lie down in a darkened room, with a dampened medicinal bandage wrapped around my forehead. [Pause.] That's better. I am pleased to inform you that this morning's post included the agency's definitive result of the poll, scribbled on a piece of blotting paper by Clytemnestra Van Dongelbraacke herself.\nIn third place is Allegory of St Bonaventure & The Poolside Attendants, by Sir Gordon Sumner, RA (no relation to that \"Stig\" person, thankfully). In second place is Some Wheat And A Couple Of Hens by Hattie Le Mesurier. But a clear winner as the favourite painting of all time here at Hooting Yard is the second official portrait of ex-President Richard Milhous Nixon, reproduced below. I think all our readers will appreciate the justice of this choice.\n\nIn an addendum to the result, Ms Van Dongelbraacke noted that several thousand proxy votes, by which Mrs Gubbins had sought to influence the outcome in her charmingly malign way, had been discounted. And not only discounted, but incinerated in a big cast iron pot.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dabbling With Suzanne\n", "completion": " \nThis week in The Dabbler I pioneer a new form of close textual analysis of classic songs, starting with \"Suzanne\" by Leonard Cohen. And when I say \"close\", I mean close--in my attempt to winkle out the deep meaning of the song I concentrate on a single six-word phrase, jettisoning the rest of it. And when I say \"winkle\", well, as you will discover when you pore over my piece, winkles and other hardy organic life-forms of the tide pool have a crucial part to play in the heretofore hidden deep structure of the song.\nOne unexpected advantage of my brain-numbing work was the realisation that there is a connection, albeit tentative and tangential, with my concurrent lobster research. I make no great claims for what we might call \"the Suzanne lobster\", but it suffices, I think, that the word \"lobsters\" appears, not at all gratuitously, in my analysis.\nThese are hideously complicated matters, but I hope I have been able to shed some little light on them.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Vox Pop : A Pang Hill Orphan Speaks\n", "completion": " \nMy name is Sago and I am a glum inmate of Pang Hill Orphanage. I was born in a faraway land. My papa was a crusty man who fell into a pond and never surfaced. Later they found a vent at the bottom of the pond which led to a chute which in turn led to a hideous abode of Doom. My mama collected flies and fleas and similar wee beasts, often but not always winged ones. One day, soon after papa plunged down the chute at the bottom of the pond, she took a little paper bag with some of her flies in it to the parliament building of that faraway land, and when she showed reluctance to open the bag to the security guards at the magnetic barrier in the lobby, they shot her dead. That is the kind of land I come from.\nI spent a few months living off berries and rainwater and living in a cave on the coastline. Then the captain of an illegal fishing smack scooped me out of the tide pool where I was happily paddling and brought me thousands of miles across the storm-tossed ocean and delivered me to the gates of Pang Hill Orphanage. That is my story in its broad outlines. I would tell you more, but it is time for my morning brain scan. No one at the Orphanage has ever explained to me why each orphan's brain is scanned three times a day, but I have made a plasticine copy of the key to the room behind the canteen in which lurk the filing cabinets where the brain scan results are stored, and soon I am going to skulk in there at dead of night and examine all the results very, very closely and then I am going to shred them, for I fear nobody and nothing.

Ned had not got the hang of correct bodice-ripping, however, for he failed to understand that the bodices he ripped were meant to have fey damsels inside them. Ned simply headed for the nearest bodice warehouse, jemmied the lock, and, once inside, ripped all the bodices stored there by whichever needleworkers had made them. This made Ned hugely unpopular with the bodice-makers, and they ran him out of town.\nSo Ned found himself sat on a stone in the middle of a field, all rustic and rural. Here there seemed little opportunity for him to be caddish or rascally. There was not a bodice in sight, only some cows and a few hens and a pigsty down the way. Ned was disconsolate.\nWhat he needed was a picaresque adventure. But such rollicking antics were not to be found in Tantarabim in days of yore, so Ned shredded cabbage instead.

I walked and walked for hours through the dense woodlands, until I gradually calmed down, and when I did, the truth started to dawn on me. I was in the middle of the forest in the middle of winter, I didn't have any idea where I was, and I couldn't find my way back home.\"\nTiciuc was speaking after being lost in frozen forest for more than a month. \"I thought I was going to die. The temperatures were sub-zero, and I was getting really weak by the end. I survived by eating berries and leaves, and grain from a haystack, until I became too weak to move. Then one day I heard voices and saw some farm workers nearby. I called them and they managed to get me to hospital. The doctors tell me I'm lucky to be alive, but they may have to amputate my legs. They're damaged from frostbite, and it may not be possible to save them.\n\"No matter what happens in future, that's the last time I ever criticise my wife's cooking.

{"prompt": "Happy Holidays\n", "completion": " Today is the final day of the Muggletonian Great Holiday, celebrated on the third, fourth and fifth of February each year. On those three days in 1652, the tailor John Reeve (1608-1658) received his commission from God, and was told that his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton (1609-1698) was to be his \"mouth\". Reeve learned that he and Muggleton were the two witnesses referred to in Revelations 11:3, and that God had empowered them to pronounce upon the fate of individuals. As Muggleton wrote in his 1663 tract The Neck of The Quakers Broken, \"He hath put the two-edged Sword of His Spirit into my Mouth, that whosoever I pronounce cursed through my Mouth, is cursed to Eternity\".\n\nPortrait of Lodowicke Muggleton by William Wood, circa 1674 (National Portrait Gallery)\nIt was long thought that, of all the sects which sprang up in the English Civil War period, only the Quakers survived into the twentieth century. During the 1970s, however, one Philip Noakes came to light in Kent, a living Muggletonian in possession of a huge archive of material covering the sect's entire history.\nThe Muggletonians believed that human reason was unclean. This led them to reject physical science. They refused to accept the laws of gravity or the rules of mathematics, and they considered astronomy to be wrong. The stars, they said, were only as big as God made them appear from earth. In later years, Muggletonians banned hot air ballooning, because the balloons would crash into the sky, a solid band around the earth.\nAnd here is a date for your diary. Lodowicke Muggleton was imprisoned for blasphemous writing in January 1677. He was released on 19th July, which was thereafter celebrated every year as the Muggletonian Little Holiday.\n(Thanks to Andy Hopton, whose 1988 article in Small Press Gleanings is my source.)\n###"}

I note that in your prognostications for the coming year you failed to mention birds. Knowing, as I do, that you are a man of exceeding ornithological perspicacity, this came as something of a surprise. You will protest that eggs get a mention, in October, but as I need hardly tell you, eggs are not birds. Some of them may become birds, in due time, but that is beside the point.\nI myself would never presume to foretell the future without first making a very careful study of our wing-blessed friends. It is, I think, well known that accurate forecasts about the future doings of princes and potentates and popes depend upon acute \"reading\" of the various timbres of coos and caws and clucks and chirrups and shrieks of all sorts of birds, not excluding budgerigars and pratincoles. Similarly, by plucking and arranging in significant array the plumage of certain birds, including avocets and owls, one gains eldritch insight into the likely outcome of the coming year's important sporting fixtures. Of course, you need to know which type of bird to pluck the feathers from, how to lay out the feathers upon a plain flat surface, and, crucially, how to interpret the pattern thus formed.\nI do not claim, however, to be a haruspex, for the simple reason that it is against my moral code wilfully to slaughter a bird--any bird--that I might wrench out its entrails, hot and bloody, for the sole purpose of fortune telling. I leave that kind of thing to the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman.\nAnyway, I wish you a happy new year, whatsoever may come to pass, and now I must dash, because the iFry I received as a Christmas gift is wittering imbecilically upon every subject under the sun, and I shall be driven insane unless I silence it by plunging it into a bucket of scum-coated rainwater.

I have been fortunate enough to get a sneak preview of version four and, let me tell you, it is everything it's cracked up to be.\nAs with the earlier releases, the basic concept of Grovel With Dampier is deceptively simple. Sorry, that's not quite right. There's no deception involved. It is simple! You, the player, accompany a simulacrum of buccaneering sea captain Sir William Dampier (1651-1715) on his three circumnavigations of the globe. Every now and again, you both disembark from your ship, whether it be the Cygnet, the St George, or the Duke, and grovel in the stinking, muddy tidewaters of whichever land mass you are at the edge of. Then, your hair festooned with kelp and your eyes sore from salt water, you clamber back on to your ship and voyage onwards to seek further grovelling grounds.\nAficionados will be pleased to learn that most, if not all, of the irritating additional features have been removed from this new edition, allowing players to concentrate fully on the essence of the game.

{"prompt": "Cuddly Wasps\n", "completion": " \"It is difficult for wasps suddenly to turn cuddly.\"--Theodore Dalrymple.\nDifficult, but by no means impossible. In his secret underground laboratory, the experimentalist Dr Fang has set up a \"wasp chamber\", to which he lures any wasps he comes upon on his perambulations around the perimeter fence of his compound. Once the wasp is trapped within the chamber, Dr Fang goes to work with what he terms his \"wasp behaviour modification techniques\". These are, of course, never to be divulged to anybody outside the secret underground laboratory, so I cannot tell you much about them. By bribing several of Dr Fang's hunchbacked troglodyte albino assistants, however, I have learned that the techniques involve a serum, a ray gun, spooky buzzing music composed by an argumentative German, icing sugar, tweezers, and mesmerism. Please note this is not an exhaustive list, so do not try to experiment on a wasp yourself.\nDr Fang remains tight-lipped regarding the cuddliness, or otherwise, of his wasp chamber alumnae, which are released into the wild when he has finished with them. Those of you who know more or less where Dr Fang's compound is located may wish to go picnicking in the vicinity on an idle summer afternoon.

(1791):\nIt seems [Johnson] had been frequently observed at the Club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges, after he had squeezed the juice of them into the drink he made for himself. Beauclerk and Garrick talked of it to me, and seemed to think that he had a strange unwillingness to be discovered. We could not divine what he did with them; and this was the bold question to be put.\nI saw on his table the spoils of the preceding night, some fresh peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces. \"O, Sir, (said I) I now partly see what you do with the squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the Club.\" JOHNSON: \"I have a great love for them.\" BOSWELL: \"And pray, Sir, what do you do with them? You scrape them, it seems, very neatly, and what next?\" JOHNSON: \"I let them dry, Sir.\" BOSWELL: \"And what next?\" JOHNSON: \"Nay, Sir, you shall know their fate no further.\" BOSWELL: \"Then the world must be left in the dark. It must be said (assuming a mock solemnity) he scraped them, and let them dry, but what he did with them next, he never could be prevailed upon to tell.\" JOHNSON: \"Nay, Sir, you should say it more emphatically:--he could not be prevailed upon, even by his dearest friends, to tell.\"\nIt seems to me that Sherlock Holmes, having cleared up that business about The Five Orange Pips, ought to have turned his attention to The Mysterious Case Of Dr Johnson And His Collection Of Orange Peel.\nTag : Fruit in literature.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Village Wrestler\n", "completion": " At midday, greased and pungent, the village wrestler took up his position by the war memorial. With his aggressive stance and tiny brain, he challenged everyone passing by to a wrestling bout. But not one among the villagers was fool enough to fight him and so, in his frustration, he would fling himself upon a dog or a chicken or a defenceless toddler straying from its mother's apron-strings, and wrestle them to the ground and pin them there, counting to ten in awful grunts, and then stand up, arms raised aloft in victory.\nHe was the undefeated champ when, eventually, the sheriff shot into him a dart tipped with a powerful horse tranquilliser, and he keeled over, bashing his head on the war memorial. He lay there unconscious for days. The villagers debated what to do with him when he awoke. Chains and cages were suggested, as was electro-convulsive therapy. But then, when he did awake, the village wrestler was placid, all aggression spent. He took a chicken and a flask of water drawn from the village trough, and he wandered off along the lane that led to the aerodrome. We never saw him again.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Good Bee\n", "completion": " Do bees make moral choices? Do they know the difference between good and evil? Answering these questions was the life's work of Captain Federico Gull, pirate-turned-apiarist, the man who swapped a life being roguish and dastardly on the high seas for one spent limping around on his wooden leg among hundreds of beehives in a field.\nCaptain Gull had been possibly the most feared buccaneer on the Spanish Main, or what was left of it. He was so fierce that he would eat a mouthful of carpet tacks for breakfast, washed down with the blood of various animals penned in the cargo holds, which he slaughtered with his sharp and shiny scimitar. Unlike the general run of pirates, however, he rarely cackled. Indeed he was not given to laughter, hideous or otherwise. Underneath the terrifying exterior, he was a thoughtful fellow, whose pleasures were found not in fighting and carousing but in resting on his bunk with a good book, such as the Rule of St Benedict, in his cabin strewn with the blossom of fragrant shrubs. Only when there was a rustle in the piles of blossom, and his Lovecraftian shoggoth reared its terrible head and prodded him to bloodlust, did Captain Gull become violent. Sometimes he wondered what had become of the rest of his crew, for there was not a soul else on board his ship.\nIt was in mulling over the inconsistencies of his own behaviour that Captain Gull began to think about the ideal of the Good Bee. As luck would have it, one winter's day a huge storm engulfed the ship and it was run aground on a remote island, but not before the shoggoth had been hurled overboard by the mighty tempest. Alone at last, Captain Gull clumped ashore, drenched and disconcerted, and camped overnight in a field. Next morning, exploring his new home, he discovered that the island was riddled with swarms of bees. The rest, children, is history.\nSource : The Bee As Moral Exemplar & Other Insect-Related Parables For Young & Old Alike, Innit by Dobson\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Smelly Castle\n", "completion": " Once upon a time there was a smelly castle. Boy, did it pong! The baron who lived there could not account for the reek. He was not a stinky person himself. Indeed, he bathed much more often than was usual in that time, in that land, and he also doused himself in rich and heady perfumes, brought to him from mysterious distant lands by itinerant perfumiers. So offended were some of these travellers by the hideous stench wafting through the castle that they could not bring themselves to cross the drawbridge. The baron would have to come out of his castle and meet them in a field to take possession of their latest scents and tinctures. He felt this was beneath his dignity, to have to come and haggle in a field like a peasant, but on the other hand it was quite a treat to be out in the fresh air for half an hour.\nThe baron had tried everything to rid the smelly castle of its pong. He had the drains inspected. He scattered pot pourris hither and thither. He even called in a fumigation expert, or at least a man who announced himself as one. But all to no avail.

After selecting today's quotation (originally published in 1893, by the way) I decided to look up \"bad drawing of a horse\".

{"prompt": "Chrononhotonthologos\n", "completion": " For many years I believed that the most startling opening line in theatre was Ubu's \"Merdre!\" in Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi. But no! What could better this:\nAldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?\nThese are the opening words of Henry Carey's Chrononhotonthologos, spoken by Rigdum-Funnidos. The play is not unlike Ubu Roi, in that the title character is a greedy, bad-tempered and violent king. (It would have been a great role for Robert Coates.) The final scene leaves the stage littered with corpses--this memorable line will give you some idea:\nO horrid! horrible, and horridest horror! Our king! our general! our cook! our doctor! All dead! stone dead! irrevocably dead! O-----h!---- [All groan, a tragedy groan.]\nThe play also includes my favourite musical direction, which would not be out of place at the Festival of Argumentative Music at Ulm (see 24th February):\nSCENE--A Bed Chamber. Chrononhotonthologos asleep. [Rough music, Viz. Salt Boxes and Rolling Pins, Grid-Irons and Tongs, Sow-Gelders Horns, Marrow-Bones and Cleavers, c. c.] He wakes.\nHenry Carey (c.1687-1743) also wrote, among much else, the words to God Save The King (or Queen). Chrononhotonthologos was so popular in its day that the title entered the language, as a synonym for \"furious, violent, demanding, self-centered\" (sounds just like Pa Ubu) and appeared in earlier editions of Roget's Thesaurus, although appears not to have made it into the OED.\nYou can read the play in full by clicking on the picture of Pa Ubu (for want of a picture of Chrononhotonthologos himself).\n\n###"}

Now, pig protection teams stand guard over the sties, and barns are built from fireproof panels, and the doh-si-doh is classed as a criminal act, the penalty terrible. It is perhaps a more civilised world, even here in the Wenkenblatt, but though I know it only from my grandparents' stories, still I miss that rustic mayhem. There is a hole where my soul should be.\nI wander past the pig sty and beat my fists upon the side of the barn, and very very quietly, so I will not be overheard, I put my lips together and whistle a tune from the old pneumatic hoedownolator, a mad and giddy tune.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Where Are The Snows Of Yesteryear?\n", "completion": " Until yesterday, the snows of yesteryear were being kept in bins in a remote and refrigerated storage facility. Due to a security alert, however, the bins were moved during the night. A fleet of trucks ferried the snow, in the bins, to a secret location. The trucks were refrigerated as, too, we must assume, is the secret location. Because it is secret, I cannot tell you where it is. I don't even know myself. But what this means is that we cannot answer the question, where are the snows of yesteryear?\nObviously we can answer that they are in a secret, refrigerated, location, but that is hardly satisfactory. The more persistent reporters from the winter weather phenomena press are unlikely to return to their igloo offices only to face the wrath of their white-bearded, icicle-strewn editors. No, they will think up ever more cunning ways to phrase their questions, hoping to trip up the snow authorities.\nThe snows of yesteryear, where are they?, they might ask, or Yesteryear, the snows of, whatever happened to them? Sooner or later a dimwit on the panel will blurt out the precise coordinates of the secret location, and frenzy will ensue.\nSnow frenzy is akin to snow fury, and we are reminded of the bestselling paperback Like A Woman Scorn'd by Ella Snowfury. It was in fact by Pebblehead, writing under a pseudonym. There is a rogue edition purporting to be by Ella Thnowfury, copies of which have fetched sums as high as 15 New Pence on eBay.\n###"}

It's a fat book, as fat as the Bible, but not black like the Bible. In fact its cover comes in a variety of hues, shades of Tompkins' own devising, created from pigments unutterable.\nAnother of his food-and-drink-based quizzums is:\nIf it looks like an egg, and has its own nog, why is it not an egg nog?\nThe best way to read this book is one question at a time. I found, in foolishly trying to read a whole page-worth of queries at one sitting, that my brain overheated and vapours hissed out of my ears and I had to go and lie flat on my back in a pitch black room, pitch black like the Bible, for umpteen hours. \"Umpteen\", incidentally, is a number that crops up umpteen times in the book, for example in this brain-teaser:\nIf a he-man tosses umpteen medicine balls into a waiting bin, how big must the bin be to gather unto itself all those umpteen medicine balls tossed into it by the he-man?\nYou can see what I mean about the overheating and the vapours and the lying flat on one's back and the pitch black and the Bible.\n###"}

This is a splendid work, highly recommended to Hooting Yard readers. To take just one essay at random, in Amusements Of The Learned, we are told that\nWhen Petavius was employed in his Dogma Thealogiea, a work of the most profound and extensive erudition, the great recreation of the learned father was at the end of every second hour, to twirl his chair for five minutes.\nTwirling in a seated position wasn't good enough for Cardinal Richelieu. He preferred \"violent exercises; and he was once discovered jumping with his servant, to try who could reach the highest side of a wall.\"\nMost amusing, perhaps, is the manner in which Baruch Spinoza liked to unwind from his philosophical labours:\nAfter protracted studies Spinoza, would... unbend his mind by setting spiders to fight each other; he observed their combats with so much interest, that he was often seized with immoderate fits of laughter.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dobson Dust-jacket Discovery\n", "completion": " On Friday 12th March we referred to Dobson's short-lived contract with Ladybird Books, which saw the publication of just one work. It has long been argued, by the indefatigable Dobson scholar Jasper Poxhaven, that a second book was planned, and--more controversially--that dust-jackets were printed for the new title so that it could be included in Ladybird's 1960 catalogue. When Dobson failed to deliver his manuscript, says Poxhaven, the proposal was quietly dropped, an erratum slip was inserted into the catalogues, and the dust-jackets were torn up and donated to the Pang Hill Orphanage for use in papier mache projects. All traces of the book were then lost, and it became one of the so-called \"Phantom Dobsons\", those much-discussed works of which there appear to be hints and vestiges in the documentary record, yet which elude even the Poxhavens of this world.*\nLast week, however, while taking a cigarette break, the same Poxhaven was caught in a downpour and took shelter in a derelict kiosk abutting the Port of Tongs flag-and-pennant warehouse. The scholar was astonished to see, pasted to the crumbling wall of the kiosk with proprietary paste, a copy of the lost Dobson dust-jacket. Gingerly, he unpeeled it from the wall, put it in his satchel, and cycled furiously to the Dobson Building, where it is now on temporary display next to a pile of towels in the laundry room.\n\n* NOTE : Aloysius Nestingbird has compared the \"Phantom Dobsons\" to the Sherlock Holmes cases which Dr Watson mentions in passing, but which were never written up as part of the canon. Three of these in particular hold me spellbound: \"the case of the bogus laundry\", alluded to in The Adventure Of The Cardboard Box, \"the singular affair of the aluminium crutch\" noted in The Adventure Of The Musgrave Ritual, and, best of all, the magnificent case of \"the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant\" in The Adventure Of The Veiled Lodger.\n###"}

{"prompt": "A Person From Porlock\n", "completion": " Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge, I know the misery of being inconvenienced by a person from Porlock. It happened thus. It was a Wednesday, I recall, teeming with Hooting Yard's most tremendous rainfall for forty years. I was sat at the kitchen table attempting to insert a new pair of laces into my gleaming big black leather boots. Minnie was at her spinet, as usual, idly tinkling. I suspected that soon the tinkling would cease and she would launch into an impassioned performance of one of her ten thousand and twenty two songs. I hoped she would play my favourite, the Anthem for a Brutish Haberdasher, or perhaps her mangled sea shanty Bring Me Your Winding Sheet, O Mother of Mine. As I fiddled ineptly with the laces, our door crashed open and a hirsute and drenched individual burst into the room. In an instant, a puddle formed at his feet. Minnie continued to tinkle.\n\"I come,\" announced the stranger, in a declamatory roar as if he were addressing a vast crowd of huddled petitioners, \"I come not from haunts of coot and hern. Nor do I come in response to your whistle, my lad.\"\n\"I was not whistling,\" I replied.\n\"Precisely!\" he continued, \"I come from Porlock, and I am going to confiscate your aglets.\"\nSo saying, he withdrew from the pocket of his bright yellow windcheater a pair of garden secateurs, swiftly cut the aglets off the ends of my brand new laces, and charged out into the downpour.

[From 25 April to 9 May Diary is written in Eileen's hand.]\nNow, we are used to one egg or two eggs, and very rarely three eggs, but fourteen? Can it be mere accident that this anomalous number of eggs is counted on the very day that Eileen has commandeered the writing of the diary? Has George been lying? Is it conceivable that all along the daily egg count has been higher than he has reported, and that he has been hiding the undeclared eggs from Eileen? One pictures Orwell sneaking off to the eggery while Eileen is out on an errand, making himself a secret omelette, perhaps, or hardboiling a clutch to carry in his pockets and give as gifts to any orphans and distressed widows he meets on his roamings. Or, conversely, is Eileen pretending to a larger egg count than is true, for her own purposes, which we can only guess at?\nWe shall have to see how many eggs are reported between now and the ninth of May, when Eileen gives George his pen back.\n###"}

This marks something of a change from your usual focus upon cows and pigs and bees, and I wonder if it signals an intention on your part to provide readers with an encyclopaedic survey of the entire animal kingdom over the coming twelvemonth. I would find this particularly useful, as, due to my education being interrupted by repeated concretions of the brain, much of my knowledge of the natural world has been gained by reading Hooting Yard. So I am well aware, for example, that pigs can be divided into two classes, real pigs and fictional pigs, and that pigs of both types can have the given name Popsy (or Popsie). I also know that goats can suffer from frequent fainting spells. However, I haven't got a clue about, say, giraffes or bison or some of the tinier life-forms such as leafcutter ants and barely visible microscopic beings without eyes or even heads. Assuming my surmise is correct, I look forward to being well-versed in the world of beasts by January next, and all thanks to you! Yours ever, Tim.\nWell, I hate to disappoint, but I fear Tim has jumped to an erroneous conclusion. The recent pieces on ducks and squirrels and pelicans were all occasioned by an abstruse formula for selecting subjects which I have been using for a couple of years now. It is theoretically possible that, within a year, the formula might throw up every single member of the animal kingdom, but that is as likely as a monkey typing out a novel by V S Naipaul.\nBy the way, I didn't see a single squirrel today.

His is an absolutely individual talent, to the point where one could say a single shot could not be mistaken for the work of another director. Melodrama, ice hockey, sexual obsession, Winnipeg, dreams, amnesia... just some of the joys of a Guy Maddin film.

The number of the bus that Smotter caught had mystic significance, so I made a note of it on one of my bits of paper. My pockets are full of them. Every year, on Savonarola's birthday, I empty out from my coats and jackets all the accumulated scraps, stack them into a pile, randomly ordered, and type up my jottings verbatim. I have usually forgotten the context and import of most of my notes, so I have about as much idea as the readers of my annual Pocketsbook [sic] what it all means. In the early days, I separated each piece with an ellipsis, but at some point--possibly around the time of Lynnette \"Squeaky\" Fromme's assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford, I cannot be precise--I just ran one note headlong into another. Hence there are passages such as the month of Frumentor possible pills for unknown disorders what is in the garden of the parsonage and why oo nooky (anag) printer's devil Gerard Manley Hopkins mesmerised a duck two sausage recipes and so on.

The museum, located at the mouth of the once mighty Columbia River, open to Cape Disappointment and just down the way from Dismal Nitch, was a very good museum, with many arcane and wonderous accounts of the famous \"Graveyard of the Pacific\".  Of course it was when I found myself studying a fantastic display of pudding fenders that the Hooting Yard Effect commandeered my own internal voice, and it really was a value-added treat.

The latest book--a snip at PS110--is devoted to the Diaries, Journals, and Notebooks. As a good Catholic, Hopkins kept a record of the sins he committed, and this new edition includes the previously suppressed details. We learn, for example, of frequent bouts of \"O.H.\" (\"old habits\"--I think we can guess what that means) and of occasions when unseemly thoughts are prompted by the sight of choristers, \"cart-boys\", and other young men.\nBut several other entries are suggestive of the fathomless depths of the poet's sickening depravity and moral turpitude. He confesses in the privacy of his diary to \"looking at and thinking of stallions\" and worse, much worse, \"self-indulgence at Croydon in fruit\".\nHow Hopkins escaped prison is one of the enduring mysteries of Victorian Jesuit literature.\n\n###"}

Much as I applaud the wisdom of the choice, I feel I should point out that this is, of course, a pamphlet rather than a book, and an out of print one to boot. I should also express my dismay that \"boiledonions\" seems to be claiming that it does not exist.\nThose cavils aside, there is a wider point here, and one all readers should note, and note well, in your little Daily Hooting Yard Devotional Observations notebooks, and it is this: Dobson may be a figure of the last century, and he may be out of print, but wherever and whenever you can, as you roam the highways and byways of the interweb, you should take whatever opportunities as present themselves to sing his praises, and to make his work more widely known.\nSo well done, \"boiledonions\".

{"prompt": "Tint When Tiny\n", "completion": " \nThis picture shows the mezzotintist Rex Tint, as a child, painting a portrait of his sister Dot Tint, chronicler of vampiric sea shanties and much else besides. Rex had great pretensions, in his curdled youth, to becoming a painter of note, rather than a mezzotintist, and he executed innumerable daubs, of which the portrait of Dot is but one. Several art critics have tugged at their beards and fiddled with their hornrimmed spectacles as they struggle to understand why Rex Tint abandoned paint and set out on the path to mezzotinty glory. Now the tale can be told. Well, not \"can be\" but \"has been\", in Pebblehead's latest bestselling paperback How The Secret Police Confiscated Rex Tint's Paintbox And How He Sobbed And Whimpered Until A Kindly Butcher's Shop Assistant Gave Him A Secondhand Mezzotinting Kit. Annoyingly, the prize-winning paperbackist does not tell us the reason why the secret police targeted the tiny painter. Had he perhaps daubed a less than flattering portrait of Prince Fulgencio? Or, on one of his plein air excursions, had he unwittingly painted a top secret experimental brain-incapacitating nerve gas facility? It really would help if Pebblehead could do some proper research for a change, but I expect he is too busy bashing out his next bestseller on that antique typewriter of his, looking up occasionally at the picture of Anthony Burgess drawingpinned to his cork board and pretending it is a mirror.\n\n###"}

We watched as a harmless, affable young IT person was supplied with what he thought was a loaded gun, placed into a trance, and then, in a crowded theatre, calmly \"shot\" a celebrity. The target was Stephen Fry.\nIt was all very entertaining, but whereas we know (and he himself cheerfully admits) that Derren Brown is simply a showman with a bag of tricks, it was evidence that your very own Mr Key is a seer who can foretell the future.

{"prompt": "A Trip To Margate\n", "completion": " A letter to The Times, from \"C.L.S.\", 16th August 1871:\nSir,--On Monday last I had the misfortune of taking a trip per steamer to Margate. The sea was rough, the ship crowded, and therefore most of the Cockney excursionists prostrate with sea-sickness. On landing on Margate pier I must confess I thought that, instead of landing in an English seaport, I had been transported by magic to a land inhabited by savages and lunatics. The scene that ensued when the unhappy passengers had to pass between the double line of a Margate mob on the pier must be seen to be believed possible in a civilized country. Shouts, yells, howls of delight greeted every pale-looking passenger, as he or she got on the pier, accompanied by a running comment of the lowest, foulest language imaginable. But the most insulted victims were a young lady, who, having had a fit of hysterics on board, had to be assisted up the steps, and a venerable-looking old gentleman with a long grey beard, who, by-the-by, was not sick at all, but being crippled and very old, feebly tottered up the slippery steps leaning on two sticks. \"Here's a guy!\"  \"Hallo! You old thief, you won't get drowned, because you know that you are to be hung,\" etc., and worse than that, were the greetings of that poor old man. All this while a very much silver-bestriped policeman stood calmly by, without interfering by word or deed; and myself, having several ladies to take care of, could do nothing except telling the ruffianly mob some hard words, with, of course, no other effect than to draw all the abuse on myself. This is not an exceptional exhibition of Margate ruffianism, but, as I have been told, is of daily occurrence, only varying in intensity with the roughness of the sea. Public exposure is the only likely thing to put a stop to such ruffianism ; and now it is no longer a wonder to me why so many people are ashamed of confessing that they have been to Margate.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\n", "completion": " Hark! The herald angels are singing the song of Stakhanov, the heroic worker. The herald angels are legion, but there are only two Stakhanovs. That's right, two. One Stakhanov is busy at the forge, just like Felix Randal the farrier, busy in his bellowing room, smelting iron or hammering a huge sheet of steel with implacable industry. The other Stakhanov is a pale aesthete. He has a bow tie, luxuriant locks, a thin Ronald Colman moustache, and is lounging in a buttercuppy meadow, propped on one immaculate elbow, reading a book of poetry. It is the collected lyrics of some forgotten noodling progressive rock group. What will become of the two Stakhanovs? Hark! Let us listen to what the herald angels are singing.\nThe hero worker at his forge / The aesthete in a meadow / Lampblacked one and the other in serge / But both end on the gallows\nGosh! So, according to the herald angels, both Stakhanovs will come to a sticky end. We must assume that they can accurately predict the future, being herald angels. When they had finished their song, we sent one of our reporters to interview them. They were not happy about this, but put forward one of their number, an angel named Angerecton, to act as their spokesangel.\nNow you and I know that Angerecton is a fumigating angel rather than a true herald angel, so it should be no surprise that the interview was unsatisfactory. In any event, our reporter found that his tape recorder malfunctioned, and all he could hear when he played back the tape was the sound of mighty and glorious angelic hosannahs, not unlike Spem In Alium by Thomas Tallis. As Dobson once wrote, in another context, \"Angels sing, and devils make a din, but the heroic worker pounds his hammer and the poet praises Stalin\". I think that before too long, you and I and both Stakhanovs will be deafened by the devil's din.\n###"}

Our drama team perform their adaptation of Nixon's Six Crises, we have readings from the infamous tape transcripts (in which we insert all the \"expletives deleted\", for added authenticity), and the highlight is a competition to find a dog in the vicinity that most closely resembles Checkers.

Charles Baudelaire, the Poe of French literature, in his tribute to the dead poet, indignantly wrote: \"What is the matter with America? Are there, then, no regulations there to keep the curs out of the cemeteries?\" In view of the fact that the Griswold biography of Poe has been incontestably discredited, and proved to be merely a scaffolding of malevolent falsehoods--the outcome of malice and mendacity--the deference paid to Griswold and his baleful work in the memoir accompanying the latest publication of Poe's writings seems well-nigh incomprehensible.\"\n###"}

I took the ACRONYM by the hand and led him towards the church, where Father Boggis waited with an old rugged cross and a handful of nails. I patted my pocket, feeling for the hammer I carried there.

{"prompt": "Real Orghast\n", "completion": " More from Phil Baker's biography of Austin Osman Spare, one of the chief pleasures of which is its plethora of anecdotes and asides. Such as this:\nIn the 1960s Ted Hughes and Peter Brook attempted to develop a language called Orghast, effectively a magical language where words would have \"a more inevitable relationship to reality\". For example, the Orghast for \"darkness opens its womb\" (\"staple of any phrasebook\" as a cynic writes) is BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR.\nI would like to learn and become fluent in Orghast. Apparently it has a vocabulary of some two thousand words, but of these only about fifty count as \"real Orghast\", according to Ted Hughes, and he should know.

{"prompt": "The Four Soups\n", "completion": " \nIn a comment on yesterday's postage about Nixonian soup hatred, Salim Fadhley asks the intriguing question if the serving of shark's fin soup at a dinner on the President's state visit to China in 1972 prompted one of his \"six crises\". We shall overlook the fact that Nixon published his book of that title ten years earlier, in 1962, and we shall also overlook the fact that Mr Fadhley's question is easily answered, either by reading the book itself or, if the prospect of hundreds of pages of Nixonian prose does not appeal, a summary of its contents which can be found on the wikipedia. We will soon learn that the shark's fin soup did not pose a crisis for Nixon, or at least not one of the six he wrote about.\nBut that is so disappointing, is it not? I would prefer to think that there is another book by Nixon, entitled perhaps Soup Crises, in which the thirty-seventh Potus describes in dramatic and unflinching detail the various soup crises he had to face. If, in the course of his life, there were only four soup crises, then an alternative title for the book could be The Four Soups. Happily, this is an anagram of House Of Turps, an out of print pamphlet by Mr Key. Could it be that I was anagrammatically channelling Nixon in 1989?

And that eerie, unholy noise they make--the soundtrack to nightmares. I know otherwise saintly people--Francis of Assisis in the making--who would gladly bludgeon, stamp on, or maim pigeons to make the world a better place. Well.\nMy theory is that our attitude to Ken's \"vermin\" has a lot to do with the associations--such as those above--which crowd our heads when we hear the word \"pigeon\". Our ability to take an objective view of the birds is lost. Just as we would find it difficult to maintain an air of suave politeness if introduced to a woman, only to learn that her first name was Condoleezza, we cannot escape the involuntary, Lovecraftian shudderings elicited by certain words and names.\nThere is a way forward, if we are prepared--in this instance--to approach ornithological taxonomy with a devil-may-care looseness. Some breeds of pigeon have lovely names. Ever since I began to think of these shit-riddled birds as cumulets, my heart swells with pangs of joy at the sight of them, which is as it should be on this miraculous and lovely planet.

Immediately this light departed, the sea grew calmer, and then we saw various kinds of birds among which were some that had no fundament.\"\nThis is not a hallucination--he is describing the electrical phenomenon known as St Elmo's Fire--but the language tends towards the visionary, and ends with this decidedly odd seabird that lacks an anus.\nCharles Nicholl, in \"Conversing With Giants\", collected in Traces Remain : Essays And Explorations (2011), quoting Antonio Pigafetta, who met giants in Patagonia.

Cardea was a nymph who also went by the name Carna. Janus was besotted with her, and as some kind of love-token, I suppose, gifted her with power over the aforesaid door handles and hinges. The Carna whose feast day it is today was another goddess entirely, who presided over the heart and other organs (hence carnal), and there is no record of her paying the slightest attention to doors, handles, hinges, or any other fixtures and fittings.\nTo make things absolutely clear, here is a picture of Cardea/Carna, together with a modern, 21st century Cardea, who is a robot designed to open doors by turning the handle and pushing.

Tempting though it is to use this as an excuse to regale you with my all-encompassing kettle theories--and believe me, you will be impressed--I'd like instead to say a few words about the particular make of kettle Ms Cradledew purchased.\nThere is an egg-shaped window in the side of the kettle which enables the pleased-as-punch kettle owner to see at a glance the water level of the water that has been poured out of a tap or spigot into the kettle. It may be argued that I could rewrite that sentence so that it is less ungainly and doesn't mention the kettle three times, but I want to be absolutely clear and I am writing in a rush. There is a pot of tea to be brewed, and I cannot type and make tea at the same time. You try it, and see how difficult it is.\nWhen the power is on, but the kettle is switched off, that is, when it is plugged in to the wall socket and the wall socket is switched on but the kettle remains in its default, at rest, idle state, an internal light is activated, and through the egg-shaped window the excited kettle owner sees a blue glow. This has the effect of making the water look not unlike a tropical sea, or at least a tiny portion of such a sea, on a blazing hot summer day--no small benefit when one lives in a land of ice chaos.\nDepress the switch underneath the kettle's handle, however, and the blue glow is instantly transformed into a glow that is bright red. The kettle is now on, and begins to boil the water which was poured into it from the tap, or spigot. Gradually, it begins to bubble. As it approaches boiling point, the combination of seething, bubbling water and a blood-red glow makes it look like a scene from hell. Satan's spa!\nI may write about further kitchen-based excitements at a later date, but now it is time for that pot of tea.\n###"}

Each of these had a specific theme, thus the 1992 Hooting Yard Calendar was entitled Accidental Deaths Of Twelve Cartographers, while its 1993 successor commemorated The Golden Days of the Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre. In 1994 I thought to illustrate a fictional work of fiction (Fangs In The Mist--a phrase stolen from J. P. Donleavy) and, in casting about within my bonce for a suitable name for the fictional author, I lit upon Chlorine Winslow. \"Chlorine\", it seemed to me, sounded like it might well have been a popular girl's name in Victorian times, and I recall that I chuckled immoderately to myself having decided upon it.\nNow, years later, I discover this:\nMrs [Leonora] Piper had become a medium in 1883. The thing had happened in the usual way--by contagion. She had been suffering from a tumour and had gone to visit a medium who gave medical consultations, but who also specialized in developing latent mediumship in others. At her first sitting Mrs Piper felt very agitated and thought she was going to faint. On the next occasion, the medium put his hands on her forehead. Once more she was on the point of losing consciousness. She saw a flood of light, unrecognisable faces, and a hand which fluttered before her own face. She then passed out. When she came to, although she could remember nothing, she was told that a young Indian girl named.,incredibly, Chlorine, had manifested through her and had given a remarkable proof of survival after death.\nFrom The Spiritualists : The Passion For The Occult In The Nineteenth And Twentieth Centuries by Ruth Brandon (Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1983).\n###"}

{"prompt": "That Impossible Map of a Dismal Canal\n", "completion": " It was made using embroidery, crayons, buttons, string and grease, and it was enormous. It was stored in an aircraft hangar. The forty aeroplanes that used to occupy the space had all been smashed up by an aeroplane-smashing machine. What a fantastic machine it was! Did you know that it could pulverise an Immelmann in less than two minutes? And do so almost silently? It would not be true to say that you could hear a pin drop, but a box of pins, yes, that you would have heard. No pins were used in the making of the map, except for that patch of darning where the canal cuts through the site of the Old Shabby Bakery, where a tiny lock-keeper's hut now stands, marked on the map by a tiny drawing of a tiny lock-keeper's hut done in red crayon. (The lock-keeper is tiny, not the hut.) The crayons used, incidentally, were waxen ones, as used by small children when first learning to draws cows or other barnyard animals. There are no cows pictured on the enormous map, because no cows stray near the canal. The elegantly-detailed border, however, is decorated with schematic motifs representing linnets, shrikes and cormorants, also in red crayon. Some have questioned why eels are shown thrashing about in the canal at various points, particularly near the darned portion of the map and at what is known as the \"Mad Section\", but I am not at liberty to divulge the full facts of the matter until the centenary anniversary of the map's completion, by which time I will be old and incontinent and white of hair and dribbling and incoherent. I can hardly wait.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Muddy Dabbling\n", "completion": " \nThis week in The Dabbler I pay homage to the two heroes of my teenage years, Samuel Beckett and Robert Wyatt, and how they sort of collided, in spirit, in Wyatt's song \"Muddy Mouth\".\nDo I still idolise either of them? Probably not. Beckett's early novels remain matchless, but he wrote himself into an airless and sterile impasse. The later, shorter, fictions lack the comic energy that makes Watt a bonkers masterpiece sui generis. As for Wyatt, he still makes some fine records, but I can't really uphold as a hero an unreconstructed communist who has that curious British middle-class leftie obsessiveness about Israel.

{"prompt": "Dismantled Wooden Myrna Loy Revisited\n", "completion": " Back in April, when I posted the words of \"Dismantled Wooden Myrna Loy\", I suggested to Outa_Spaceman that perhaps the world was ready for a new setting of this traditional folk song.

{"prompt": "The Natural World\n", "completion": " A number of readers have suggested that Hooting Yard's vision of the natural world is an extremely narrow one, overpopulated by birds, with the occasional badger thrown in, and all other life-forms excluded. There is, I suspect, some justice in this. You are more likely to come upon, let's say, a list of three-letter bird-names (auk, cob, emu, hen, jay, kea, moa, owl, pen, poe, roc, tit, tui) than an equivalent catalogue of bears, insects, or horses.

{"prompt": "Robust And Transparent\n", "completion": " It is ever more apparent that Hooting Yard needs to be both robust and transparent.

The message will be shouted in a transparently robust manner, from behind a transparent screen, made of robust glass. It's a big ask, but I think it's important to begin the conversation. One benefit of such robust transparency is that we might, as a result, be invited into the government's big tent of all the talents. Asked to predict the likelihood of this, our resident prognosticator Little Severin The Mystic Badger scrabbled around in a pile of twigs and muck and came to no definite conclusion. Perhaps he is insufficiently robust. Nor, of course, is he transparent, being a badger.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Git On Drayhorse\n", "completion": " Speaking of drayhorses, as we were yesterday, I could not help but notice that the phrase \"Git on drayhorse\" is an anagram of \"Hooting Yarders\". This has the vexing implication that my average reader or listener is a git mounted on a drayhorse. One pictures a rustic lane along which a great grey drayhorse is plodding, atop which is a git, leafing through a copy of Gravitas, Punctilio, Rectitude & Pippy Bags perhaps, or listening to my radio show on a pair of headphones jammed into their gitty ears.\nNow I do not wish to think of any Hooting Yard devotee as a git. Perhaps what we have here is akin to that phenomenon where otherwise staid and reasonable persons turn into psychotic maniacs when they get behind the driving wheel of a car. Does the placid and altogether lovely Hooting Yarder become a git at the moment of plopping in to the saddle of their great grey drayhorse? I suppose it is possible.\nAnagrammatic determinism being what it is, all I can do is to plead with my readers and listeners to find for themselves an alternative means of pulling their carts along the country lanes. Many of you will, I know, be toiling along those very lanes today, engarbed in peasant rags, transporting your carts piled high with rustic muck from one filthy field to another, or perhaps rolling in to a market square at the centre of a squalid hamlet. And what better way to pass the time, as the wind howls through the branches of larches and pines, than to read a tale from Befuddled By Cormorants or to listen on your iHoot to a morally instructive episode of Hooting Yard On The Air? But doing so need not, must not, make you a git. So eschew your drayhorse, I beg of you, and if you cannot afford a fume-belching tractor, pull the damned cart yourself.\n###"}

We bought them from CND.\nOh how we failed to laugh around the Christmas dinner table as we pulled our ideologically sound crackers. Out fell the expected paper hat and printed slip--and on the latter, there was not a terrible and groanworthy joke, but a sobering fact about nuclear weapons and the inevitable worldwide holocaust they would cause.

{"prompt": "The Path Of Pollen\n", "completion": " Mr Key wishes to announce that henceforth he will be following the Path of Pollen. As you may already know, this Path is an important and ancient tradition of bee shamanism. Like Naomi Lewis, I will be bounding out of bed at dawn and doing the lemniscatic walk. It looks like walking in a figure of eight. When bees come back from foraging, they do this to tell the hive where the best nectar is, and so on. The walk is seen to give one access to infinite knowledge and vitality.\nYou might wonder what precisely is implied by that \"and so on\", as if there is some kind of fluffy vagueness about the Path of Pollen, but I can assure you this is not so. I am confident that, as infinite knowledge and vitality begin to suffuse every last chink of Hooting Yard, you, as readers, will be thankful that bee shamanism is being practised here, and you may indeed take up lemniscatic walking yourselves.\nIncidentally, I have been asked a number of times over the years if Joost Van Dongelbraacke, the suburban shaman, was in fact a suburban bee shaman, but I am afraid my researches to date have thrown only a very pale light on the matter. While some authorities claim that he shed bits of beeswax as he roamed his shamanic suburb, others counter that they were simply bits of earwax falling from his admittedly rather grubby head. I do not yet know enough to pronounce on the question, for I have only been following the Path of Pollen since this morning, and so my knowledge is not yet infinite. I am hoping it will be so by about Thursday week.\n###"}

Apparently, a second raid on her hideout by the Blister Lane Constabulary Dangerous Python Squad was partly successful. Most of the octogenarian fugitive's \"minders\" perished after being attacked by the snakes and their robot-controlled metal counterparts. Astonishingly, Mrs Gubbins herself made a daring getaway, using her crutches in an inventive way which the urchin was unable to divulge, either through ignorance or inarticulacy. He was able to inform us, however, that our pal has taken refuge in the Tent of the Tundists, who have vowed to protect her if she embraces Tundism. We have sent a greetings card to her. It shows a picture of a decidedly inelegant giraffe standing next to some beetles. Mrs Gubbins is fond of beetles.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Was Dobson Stalin?\n", "completion": " This is the intriguing thesis propounded by Aloysius Nestingbird in his new book, entitled Was Dobson Stalin? : Laying Bare The Greatest Secret Of Twentieth Century Communist Politics Once And For All, With Eight Diagrams, Six Colour Plates, A Big Map & Far Too Many Footnotes (Thedoobiebrothers Books, PS16.99). Here is a short extract, including one of those infernal footnotes--which itself has a footnote:\nLet us consider the fact that Stalin's childhood nickname was \"Soso\". Later he became \"Koba\", and of course \"Stalin\" itself is a nickname, the \"Man of Steel\". There are profound implications here. Was Dobson, as a child, not known as \"Doso\"? In his twenties, was it not common for such friends as he had to call him \"Doba\"? Did he not later become known as the \"Man of Bandages?\" *\n*NOTE : Just before this book went to press, the author received decisive information. Apparently, not one of these nicknames was ever applied to Dobson. Even when he was a babe in swaddling clothes, his parents addressed him as \"Dobson\", as did everyone else he ever met throughout his life. There are those who will carp and say my theory is thus invalidated. A pox upon them! Just take a look at these photographs: one shows a gigantic poster of Stalin at the height of his personality cult; the other shows a huge billboard with what is incontrovertibly the image of Dobson.*\n\n* For copyright reasons I am unable to reproduce the extremely similar Dobson photograph.\n###"}

The French writer Raymond Roussel once claimed that, in time, his fame would eclipse that of Napoleon Bonaparte: and who knows, he may yet be proved right. I venture to suggest that Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's name will likewise ring down the centuries, yea, e'en unto the time when, as Carl Sagan so memorably put it, \"the earth is a charred cinder, and the sun... dead\". Why should this be so? Recall the first series of that wretched television programme I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! There is one superb moment when Tara and the log-obsessed Tony Blackburn are clearing up the camp. The other participants--including Uri Geller--have left. Tara stoops to pick something up. She looks at it, whatever it is, distastefully. Then, handing her find to Tony, she pronounces the immortal words: \"These are Uri's underpants. Burn them\".\n###"}

Touching with all reverence on the proper study of religious books, Dr Conolly lamented that morbid brooding over subjects of theology and points of doctrine is such a fruitful cause of mental diseases... Although Dr Conolly's remarks pointed generally to the impropriety and danger of persons--ladies especially--abandoning themselves to self-guidance, and over-prolonged contemplation on subjects of religious controversy, he severely commented upon the injurious effects of those poisonous literary emanations appearing without authority, and dignified most improperly by the name of 'religious'.\"\nI have to say that some of the greatest pleasures of my life have been found in morbid brooding about abstruse points of theological doctrine. Still, now I know better, don't I? The quoted passage is from Things Not Generally Known by John Timbs (1858), where you can also read about such matters as insensibility of the brain, dread of eclipses, unpopular improvements, and the Death of the Beetle and the Giant.

{"prompt": "Poets Of Porridge\n", "completion": " Weedy poet Dennis Beerpint recently received a commission from PIG to write a ballade in celebration of the election of its new Presidento. PIG, for those of you wallowing in ignorance, stands for the Porridge Information Groupuscule, a body devoted to promoting the sale and consumption of porridge in every corner of the land.\nSince he became a beatnik, Beerpint's Muse has deserted him, and he has written nothing except for fragmentary squibs. He accepted the commission, partly because of the generous fee and partly in the hope that his versifying gifts might be reborn. Alas, he spent many hours sat staring hopelessly out of the window with an empty brain.\nFinally, in desperation, he cast around in anthologies for something which, if he could not quite pass off as his own, he could tinker with, or use as a model. As luck would have it, he discovered George Huddesford's 1802 poem The scum uppermost when the Middlesex porridge-pot boils over :  an heroic election ballad with explanatory notes : accompanied with : An admonitory nod to a blind horse. Here was a work that fitted the bill perfectly, featuring not only porridge and elections, but horses and scum. As I write, Beerpint is mucking about with the text to turn it into something he can call his own.\nHuddesford, incidentally, had a way with titles, among his other published pieces being Bubble And Squeak : A Gallimaufry of British Beef with the Chopped Cabbage of Gallic Philosophy (1799). As for PIG, it is held by some of the members that the proper title of Timothy Mo's 1991 novel The Redundancy Of Courage should in fact be The Consistency Of Porridge, though this is thought to be a comment on its prose style.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Useful Words\n", "completion": " Vigilant readers of the Hooting Yard Search Engine Lure will note within it the splendid word \"bewolfenbuddlement\". Like \"solipsism\", this is a coinage by Horace Walpole, but sadly one which never caught on. When the future George III was a teenager, his grandfather tried to marry him off to a European princess, much to the dismay of George's mother. The name of the princess was Sophia Caroline Maria, daughter of the Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel. Under his mother's influence, George became fretful and aghast at the proposal, and--as Walpole wrote--he \"declares violently against being bewolfenbuttled\". To resurrect the word successfully, perhaps it is necessary to widen it from the sense of being forced into an arranged marriage to being forced into anything one doesn't want to do.

Surely the best way to find out would be to pit one against the other in a (lack of) intelligence test--a \"brain-off\" between the newsagent's cat and a blue-footed booby. Unfortunately, it was at this point that I learned--by consulting my copy of Dobson's Bumper Book Of Facts About Things The Lower Extremities Of Which Are Blue (out of print)--that the blue-footed booby is not native to these shores.

Instead of pouring milk into the saucer, however, just place the packet of toffee apple sausages on it, unopened, and go about your business, whatever that business may be, whether it is pickling the tiny bones of a wren or rearranging your collection of Vinder's soccer coupons in their leather-bound album.\nWhen a ghoul comes a-shimmering and a-groaning into your homestead, it will be lured by the toffee apple sausages, and hunker over the saucer, befuddled. One cannot speak of its brain being discombobulated, for ghouls do not have brains as such. Whatever that hideous insubstantial blob nestling within its ghastly head may be, it is not a brain. But the blob will throb in the presence of toffee apple sausages, and if the ghoul lingers long enough over the saucer, its head-blob will either shrivel or explode, depending on what category of ghoul it is. The one thing it will not be able to do is to summon the wherewithal to launch an attack.\nIt will have been successfully nobbled.\nThere is much else that can be said about the commingling of sausage and toffee apple, quite irrespective of ghouls, but now I have to go and make a few changes to my exquisite hand-drawn map of Blunkett-by-the-Blears.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Letter From Belper\n", "completion": " A letter plops on to my desk from Tim Belp.\nDear Mr Key, I noticed, in yesterday's essay on tin foil, that you ascribed authorship of the play The Man Who Came To Dinner In A Shiny Pointy Hat to a certain Belper Frisson. Well, the name means nothing to me, because I am just a simple country person and a stranger to the sophisticated delights of theatreland. But I can tell you that in my neck of the woods--that is, Belper--what we call a \"Belper frisson\" is that little pang of excitement one gets when, having left our lovely Derbyshire town to go elsewhere on an errand, one arrives back, on the train, and steps on to the platform of Belper railway station, home at last. If you have never been to Belper, may I recommend a visit? Not being a native, you will be unlikely to feel a \"Belper frisson\" upon arrival, but you may nevertheless experience a thrill when you learn that you are in the birthplace of swarfega, manufactured by Deb Ltd in Belper since its invention by Audley Bowdler Williamson in 1947. Passionately yours, Tim Belp.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Fatal Flaw In The Great Escape\n", "completion": " Yesterday I watched The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963) on television, and I was struck by a scene about an hour into the film which fatally undermines the plot. Up to that point, we are rooting for the Allied prisoners of war who, as is usual in such dramas, say things like \"OK, chaps, let's form an Escape Committee and smoke our pipes\", and we accept their statements that it is their duty to try to escape and to otherwise make life as difficult as possible for their Boche captors.\nBut then comes the scene where Blythe, played by Donald Pleasence, gives an ornithology lecture to some of the men. He whistles the song of the warbler, and then shows them how to draw the masked shrike. We are asked to believe that sensible British chaps would rather risk gruesome death at the hands of the Gestapo when they could see out the war having bird-life explained to them by eerie-eyed Donald Pleasence. This seems to me utterly implausible, and for all the thrills and spills of the remaining two hours, I think the film would have been much better had it concentrated solely on Blythe's ornithology classes.\n\n###"}

The Lady's maid is taken very sick today: I sopose she has been eating too much or something of the kind. But she is very subject to sickness. Last summer, when we were coming home from Canterbury, she actually spewed all the way, a distance of sixty miles and not less time than eight hours. The people stared as we passed through the towns and villages as she couldent stop even then. It amused me very much to see how the country people stood stareing with their mouthes half open and half shut to see her pumping over the side of the carriage and me sitting by, quite unconserned, gnawing a piece of cake or some sandwiches or something or other, as her sickness did not spoil my apatite. It was very bad for her but I couldent do her any good as it was the motion of the carriage that caused her illness. I gave her something to drink every time we changed horses but no sooner than it was down it came up again, and so the road from Canterbury to London was pretty well perfumed with Brandy, Rum, Shrub, wine and such stuff. She very soon recovered after she got home and was all the better for it after. It's eleven o'clock. My fire is out and I am off to bed.\n###"}

Although, perhaps, she belonged to the age of Webster more than to any later one, for there was a certain quality about her at once robust and morbid. She loved the sea, and all its smaller fruits, shrimps, prawns, and winkles (here her aristocratic prejudices, as evinced in her horror of bananas, broke down); she loved the lanes, then fuller of wild flowers than of charabancs, and could name any flower, bird, or tree with its proper English name; she loved theatres and any form of pageantry; but more, I think, than anything, did she love to read of a murder--though it was only in the Bible--visit a friend dying of some lingering disease, or roam at her ease in a well-ordered cemetery, observing every inscribed and floral detail... it was this woman, with her \"invincible ignorance\", as those responsible for the welfare of the present writer termed it... together with the old house in the shelter of which he lived, that nevertheless joined everyday life for him on to that of previous ages, prevented the nineteenth century from cutting itself off entirely from the past, and provided a healthy current of red blood to that which otherwise might have seemed a dull, bloated, yet anemic age.\nOsbert Sitwell, in the preface to Sober Truth : A Collection Of Nineteenth-Century Episodes, Fantastic, Grotesque And Mysterious, compiled and edited by Margaret Barton and Osbert Sitwell (1930)\n###"}

While commonly used up until the early 20th century, the hand-made rope bumpers were eventually replaced with used auto tires and synthetic rubbers.\nVisually, they're masterpieces of knot-craft, heavy and beautifully patterned.A Lord knows how long it took to knit these things, but I hear sailors can have a lot of free time on their hands while at sea. I did come across a site that sells modern versions of Pudding Fenders, butA I can't really think why one would buy one except for the reason of being able to shout \"Throw down the Pudding Fenders\" to the first mate every so often.\nAlso known as Bow Pudding, they came in all kinds of different shapes, sausage-like mostly, and even one style that looks like a steroidal string mop hung from the bow like a great messy beard.  .\nHere's a nice example, just like one of the fenders I saw on display--large and huggable even, it measured a meter+ in diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a side note, I was a little, well, a lot confused about the Pudding aspect, until tonight I remembered something about the English and their puddings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMystery solved!

Nobody expected frail little Puissance to rule with an iron fist, but she does, and then some!\nLike so many citizens, Gus had assumed that Puissance would be a benign queenlet. It was perhaps this naivete which led to his undoing, when he entered a contest in the weekly children's comic The Terrible Wrath Of Christ Our Saviour. Readers were asked to supply a caption for a drawing which showed an innocent farmyard scene, typical of our country. Mischievous Gus wrote something disobliging about a hen, unaware that every single caption submitted to the comic would be scrutinised, personally, by Puissance Huffington. She could not read, of course, so pressed into service a man of letters who loitered somewhere in the bowels of the palace. When this sickly one-legged fellow read to Puissance the words written by Gus, she was outraged.\n\"I am very fond of hens,\" she is reported to have said, \"And I will not have disobliging things said of them, no siree!\"\nAnd she told the man of letters to aim his crutches in the direction of the Palace Git, conveying instructions to have Gus arrested. And so within hours of writing his unwise words, Gus found himself chained to one of the huffington posts in one of the less salubrious parts of the country, populated for the most part by ne'er-do-wells, halfwits, and Corbynistas. Eagerly, they pelted Gus with pips, as Puissance Huffington decreed.\nIn retrospect, we can appreciate just how fortunate Gus was to have committed his crime in the early days of the reign of Puissance. For her power made the little orphan child ever more vindictive and cruel, and it was not long before she declared that miscreants should be pelted, not with pips, but with plumstones.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Beatnik Beerpint\n", "completion": " Never one to be troubled by the chronology of cultural fads, poet Dennis Beerpint is trying to reinvent himself as a beatnik. He has been seen about town sporting a goatee beard and a jet black polo neck sweater. A concerned Beerpint-watcher suspects a copy of Allen Ginsberg's Howl may have fallen into his hands.\n\"Knowing Dennis Beerpint,\" writes my correspondent, \"His version of Howl will probably be called Bleat or Oooh, Missus!\"\nThis seems a bit harsh to me. Though Beerpint can be incorrigibly twee, and often fatuous, at its best his work has reduced me to a sincerely sobbing heap of woebane. I am thinking of such pieces as Lines Upon The Collision Of A Little Peewit With A Hot Air Balloon, a poem I consider to be the finest peewit-related poem of the last millennium. It will be interesting to see where he goes in his new beatnik persona, daddy-o. Well, perhaps not interesting, but at the very least mildly diverting in a Beerpinty way for those of us who follow his doings.\n###"}

{"prompt": "That \"Dobson\" Photograph\n", "completion": " On Thursday 1st April we published an anonymously-sent photograph of a man and a child, one of whom was purportedly Dobson. I suggested this was probably an April Fool's Day prank. Now, reader Peter C Ross writes:\nSir : Having known Dobson for more years than I care to mention I am certain that the photograph you have received is of Dobson as a child and that the figure behind is his father (also known as Dobson). The identification is further confirmed by the corner of a Crittal window visible in the background. It is a well known fact that Dobson spent his formative years behind such a window.\nThis is clearly nonsense. In his breathtaking--if indigestible--List Of Every Single Person Dobson Met In His Life, Jasper Poxhaven never mentions anyone named Ross, let alone Peter of that ilk, with or without a C. Our correspondent is either the shadowy figure who sent the photograph, or a maniac, or possibly both.

{"prompt": "Ted Volta\n", "completion": " A while back, in his Ragbag, Gaw posted an excerpt from David Kynaston's book Family Britain 1951-1957 recalling inhabitants of a lost world, variety acts of the time including mental telepathists the Piddingtons and Valantyne Napier the human spider. Lost indeed, but that trace of them survives, both in Kynaston's book and, duly quoted by Gaw, on het internet. Imagine how pleased you would be, as one of a younger generation of Piddingtons, to do a Google search and find your grandparents or great-grandparents (and so on, yea unto the last generation) remembered, even in so tantalisingly vague a fashion.\nBut what of those who vanish utterly from memory? I thought, perhaps naively, that everything could be found on het internet, somewhere or other, hidden in some cobwebbed corner. This morning, in The Naked Lady, or Storm Over Adah : A Biography Of Adah Isaacs Menken by Bernard Falk, I came upon this:\n\"Ted Volta, the famous clown, happily still alive in the winter of 1933-34, remembers how he, and the young men of his day, rushed over Westminster Bridge to be shown the bold hussy, whose surprising dress was said to be that of Mother Eve.\"\nFalk's book was published in 1934, when the aged Ted Volta could still be described as \"the famous clown\". Intrigued by that splendid name, I looked him up online but could find not a trace of him anywhere. Not a trace. And The Naked Lady is out of print. So will Ted Volta be completely forgotten? Or, by tapping out that quotation, have I singlehandedly rescued him from oblivion?\nIt is my hope that one day a historian of clowns will stumble upon this postage, and set off in pursuit of Ted Volta, and, after months and years of tireless research, produce a thumping great biography in book form, and a website dedicated to the famous, not forgotten, clown.\n###"}

It is this combination of characteristics which makes them so engaging, unlike dogs. As we have seen, dogs are boring.\nWe can adduce further evidence of cats' fundamental malevolence from Nerea De Clifford. In her study What British Cats Think About Television, she wrote: \"Most cats show an interest of some kind, though it is often of hostility... a significant reaction is the display of excitement when any picture, especially of birds, moves quickly across the screen.\" (Previously quoted in the Archives, March 2004.)\nHere is a photograph of Nerea De Clifford, described by the Cats Protection League as \"a popular and gracious lady\".\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Back\n", "completion": " Back after a longer than expected break. Much has happened since Hooting Yard was last updated. For one thing, I had to go to Rome in an attempt to become the Pope. I was disappointed that Vatican officials chose not to use the traditional method of ensuring that John Paul II was really dead, by striking him three times on the forehead with a special hammer while shouting his name. Lamentably, they relied on modern medical practice. After that, it was downhill. Instead of me, they chose one of the cardinals. Ah well, maybe next time. And to think I had already chosen my pontifical name. After all those pious ones (usually spelled Pius) I was going to be Impius the First. However, I have changed my mind during the last week. On his visit to Washington, George Galloway memorably called Christopher Hitchens a \"drink-soaked former Trotskyist popinjay\", and I think Pope Popinjay has a nice ring.\nWhat else have I been up to? Much of my time has been spent working tirelessly on a book entitled Essays On String, Killer Bees, Slops And Pap. Astute readers will note that my title is plagiarised from one of Dobson's out-of-print pamphlets, but the two works could not be more different. Where Dobson is gullible, I am drawn to flimflam.

{"prompt": "Witless Fabiola\n", "completion": " Witless Fabiola is one of the archetypes in the complex mythology of the Tundists. Of the many stories about her, perhaps the most important is the legend in which she is sent out west on a Tundist quest to find a hornets' nest but becomes distressed and sits down to rest, and while she rests she has a dream about a giant bream swimming in a stream lit by a moonbeam the colour of cream. In other tales, Witless Fabiola does deeds of derring-do, fights phantom crustacea in the tide pools of Tantarabim, wraps herself in flags, and--in an apocryphal story--turns into a zombie goddess who causes thunderstorms and blizzards and other meteorological phenomena.\nWitless Fabiola is usually depicted holding a trident in her left hand and some birdseed in her right, wearing a cape spun of crocus stalks, her left foot trampling on the neck of a subjugated cormorant. Sometimes she is given a human head, with a mop of frazzled black hair not unlike, say, Robert Smith's of The Cure. In other images, inspired by the breakaway Pseudotundist sect, her head is that of a merganser duck or booby.\nTundist scholar Ernesto Hudihudimojo has compiled an anthology of legends about Witless Fabiola, none of which is longer than a couple of hundred words, and all of which peter out quite irritatingly. The reader is desperate to know more, but Dr Hudihudimojo points to the authenticity of his retellings, and argues that one of the crucial features of Tundist myth is the eschewing of \"closure\".\nWe asked the publishers for permission to reprint some of these stories, but they just grunted at our representative and sent her packing, pursued by fractious toddlers armed with pebbles.\n###"}

In a bunker deep underground, I was able to view several hours of footage from various demonstrations, hoping to spot a committed member of the social justice movement, in other words a mermaid, being clubbed senseless, possibly even to death, by a brutish copper or two. Well, when I say that is what I was hoping to see, I do not mean that I was excited by the prospect of watching a semiaquatic being being roughed up by the forces of law and order, rather if that is what I did see it would confirm mermaids' status as committed members of the social justice movement. Are you still with me? This isn't particularly complicated stuff, but I am having some difficulty explaining myself. Though I must say it was fun to write a grammatically correct sentence containing two adjacent \"being\"s. Anyway, to my infinite regret the footage was shaky and blurry and I couldn't make anything out in detail, so I am still unable to reach a definitive mermaid conclusion. What I do have, courtesy of OSM, is a photograph of a gathering of mermaids, perhaps protesting in favour of world peace or against capitalism. Neither George Galloway nor Annie Lennox, say, is visible in the picture, so it's hard to be sure what exactly the mermaids are making a fuss about. Careful study of the photo will be necessary, through a microscope, which I shall have to borrow from my next door neighbour, a somewhat perplexing individual with cake-crumbs in his beard.

{"prompt": "Dobson's Commentary on the Above\n", "completion": " At a loose end one blustery Thursday morning, Dobson decided to write a lengthy critical analysis of the The Life & Times of Captain Cake. He began, as he always did, by sharpening his pencil. That done, in a single burst of inexplicable enthusiasm, he penned an essay much, much longer than his usual pamphlets. It is a bewildering piece of work, caustic and trenchant even by Dobson's standards, and was issued in fifteen weekly instalments. Flush with cash from the sale of his Big Mysterious Piece of Hardboard, Dobson took out advertisements in the press to announce his new part-work, offering the first issue at a discount price, and including a two-inch high plastic figurine of Captain Cake* as further inducement.\nEach of the fifteen instalments addresses a different aspect of the text. So, for example, Volume IV is entitled Welk, Bankhead, Loy : There'll Be A Welcome In The Hillsides while Volumes VIII and IX both concentrate entirely on the game of ping pong. Long out of print, this superb (if unintelligible) essay is ripe for reassessment in the 21st century which Dobson did not live to see. Over the coming months, the Hooting Yard Foundation hopes to publish on this site a hypertext version of the essay. Be in no doubt that it will prove a boon to scholars worldwide.\n* NOTE : The distinguished critic and pirate F. X. Gilliblat claims that the figurine bears no resemblancewhatsoever to Captain Cake. He may well be right.\n###"}

He ground the Standard under his boot, and he poked pins into a waxen doll of Dr. J. Q.

Now stick innumerable pins into it, and voila! you have a splendid homemade pin cushion.\nIt may be that your interests do not run to needlework or embroidery, in which case you will not find much use for a pin cushion. So let me show you how easy it is to turn it into something far more exciting!\nFashion a few pipe cleaners into the basic shape of a human body--arms and legs and torso. Then poke this into your pin cushion, which serves as the head. Depending on the size of your pippy bag, the proportions will be all wrong, and it will look a bit like a three-dimensional stick person with a huge bloated hydrocephalic head, but don't worry about that. Think of it as a voodoo dolly.\nThe next thing you need to do is to force your mind into believing that the dolly is genuinely imbued with the spirit of a real person, just as Francis Galton convinced himself that Mr Punch was a god. Bear in mind that the dolly has innumerable pins stuck in its head, which almost guarantees that the person you choose, whether it is David Blunkett, for example, or Gore Vidal, will shortly afterwards have their actual head attacked by a swarm of bees.\n###"}

This is precisely the sort of activity a plucky tot such as myself ought to be engaged in.\nOn my way to the station I encountered a tearaway pulling the wings off flies. I kicked his head in and then made him glue the wings back on using a glue composed of his own blood, spittle, and bone marrow. Then I made him swear a solemn vow to be an upstanding citizen for the rest of his natural life. It is a shame such ne'er-do-wells can no longer be transported to Botany Bay.\nThinking of Botany Bay made me think of botany, so I paused by the railway embankment to pick some peonies and marigolds. Because of my deeds of derring-do and penchant for violence people often forget that I am just a simple little girly and take great pleasure in my flower press. Sometimes I fancy I hear the flowers shrieking as I press every last smidgen of life out of them.\nAt the railway station, the dithering old station master, Mr Cribbins, was faffing about with flags and hooters. Needless to say he cannot make the trains run on time. I lured him to some sidings by pretending my little dolly was trapped in the rails, then buried him up to his neck in coarse sand. I read him the riot act, or at least a version of it improvised by Il Duce, translated into English by my mysterious mentor. Back on the platform, I took up Mr Cribbins' flag and hooter and deployed them in such a manner that I struck fear into the hearts of train drivers throughout the land.

{"prompt": "Profundity\n", "completion": " It is high time I wrote something profound. To do so has always been within my gift, of course, it is just that I have neglected it. Oh, every single day I am beset by thoughts of great profundity, though admittedly these may oft be mistaken for platitudes, truisms, or mad ravings.\nThis morning, for example, as I awoke with the sunrise, at approximately half past four, the first thing that came into my head was the phrase \"All roads lead to Rome\". How profound that is. We could, if we wished, worry away at it for hours and hours, like a cat with a strand of wool, and, unlike the cat, we would forever find new insights, new angles, unfathomable depths of wisdom and, yes, profundity. The cat, by contrast, being ineradicably stupid, would forget whatever it had learned about the strand of wool thirty seconds ago. I am sometimes envious of cats. Imagine how exciting life must be, to be so stupid!\nUnfortunately, with my pea-sized yet pulsating brain, I am able to fret and fiddick about the five words \"All roads lead to Rome\" for hour after hour. I can draw from them profound insights about history and geography and the nature of what it means to be human, and much else besides. I can become lost in profundity.\nBy the way, I made up that word \"fiddick\". Or at least, I commandeered the surname of the last editor of the much-lamented The Listener, Peter Fiddick, to serve as a verb meaning something along the lines of fretting at and worrying at something, as a cat might fret and worry at a strand of wool, as a fool might fret at an old adage.

I entered a large room with three windows looking out upon the road; folding doors connected it with the room behind. These I pushed open and found myself in another room exactly like the first; I went over to the central one of its three windows and looked out. Instead of the characterless gardens and hinder facade of a parallel block, I saw a sloping strip of ground overgrown with brambles, then a pebbly shore, and beyond, the crash and smother of Atlantic waves, breaking ceaselessly and without tide. This ocean stretched away to the horizon where it met a misty sky, but did not merge with it--the heaving water set up a melancholy distinction out there; and here within, a briney exultant smell penetrated the panes, cutting through the mustiness of a house long closed.\n\"What extraordinary growths, I wondered, flowered in those wasteful depths? There must be a submerged garden whose silken green held curiosities far surpassing those I had come upon before. Idiots often describe such places and describe what they see; making idiots is one of the sea's favourite games.

{"prompt": "Matters Of Note\n", "completion": " Two unrelated matters of note to draw to your attention. I was going to write \"two unrelated headlines\", but \"headline\" suggests news, and one of these is not only three years old but was not a \"news headline\" even then.\nThough having said they are unrelated it now occurs to me that one could in fact connect the two, or imagine a scenario in which they were jammed together, for example, by using the contraption in (A) to view the incident in (B).\n(A), then, is Build Your Own Dobsonian Telescope. Tragically--and I am quite clear about the usage of that word--the Dobson in question is not our beloved out of print pamphleteer, but another Dobson entirely. Still, to discover that such a thing as a Dobsonian telescope exists, and that its creator might, every now and then, be mistaken for our Dobson, is most pleasing.\n(B) is news that a Japanese fishing trawler has been sunk by giant jellyfish. Unfortunately, the details of the story are rather prosaic. You might want to skip them, and instead imagine you are standing upon a promontory on the coast of Japan, peering through your Dobsonian telescope at the terrible sight of a fishing boat being attacked by a hideous semi-transparent sea monster with flailing tentacles.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Some Interesting Lops\n", "completion": " First, let us consider Ferdinand Lop. During the Fourth Republic in France, Lop was a serial election candidate. Perhaps his most memorable policy was his promise to extend the Boulevard Saint-Michel in Paris in both directions until it reached the sea. I am not making him up. So often did his candidacy for various offices appear on ballot papers that he provoked the creation of an anti-Lop party, called, superbly, the Anti-Lops.\nSecond, Loplop, Max Ernst's \"Bird Superior\", which first appeared in 1929. Here it is:\n\nThis anthropomorphic bird-man with beaked head and human body (occasionally depicted with wings as well) became Ernst's alter ego in numerous works in different media--collage, painting, and relief. Loplop is sometimes represented as a complete figure, sometimes in abbreviated fashion with disembodied head and hand, as he presents or introduces pictures within pictures--leaves or flowers, a young woman, fellow Surrealists, butterflies or, as in the picture above, other birds.\nThird, and still on the topic of birds, we have the lopwit. This bird does not actually exist, although I thought it did. It appears in A Catalogue Of 53 Birds, and pretty much nowhere else. A Google search for \"lopwit\" elicits four results, two of which are from Hooting Yard. And I was convinced that such a thing as the lopwit existed. Ah well.\n###"}

Not a sound beyond the clanging of doors was to be heard, punctuated at frequent intervals by the dull thud of blows, as some hapless wretch was being clubbed, the shrieks and howls of prisoners, and the groans of those on the verge of insanity. It was just as if all the demons of the Nether Regions were at work worrying and harrying their victims. While rocking myself to and fro I heard the turning of the key.

If any reader knows the names of his dozen siblings, please let me know.\n* NOTE : I am careful to write \"I think, reasonably well-known\" as opposed to the magisterial \"everybody knows\".

{"prompt": "Lost Or Imaginary\n", "completion": " The New Psalmanazar reminds us of catalogues of lost or imaginary books compiled by Sir Thomas Browne and Francois Rabelais, which in turn reminded me that for some time I have been planning an exhaustive catalogue raisonne of the out of print pamphlets of Dobson. This would be an inestimable boon to the amateur Dobsonist, unable to gain access to the official archive because they haven't got either a ticket or a key or indeed a clue as to which high Alpine pass it is situated in.\n\nFrancois Rabelais\nMany, many, many of Dobson's pamphlets have been mentioned in these pages over the years, but even that fragmentary list has never been cobbled together into a coherent whole. Mr Key himself has avoided the task, sad to say, forever devising new and ludicrous excuses, such as flint in the heart or reruns of Daktari. A while ago, there was a suggestion that a team of feral teenagers could be taken off the streets and locked in a bunker until they had compiled a complete list, but it was rightly objected that they could not be trusted to resist appending \"innit\" to the end of each title. Judicious Tippexing could expunge such desecration, but who would wield the Tippex?\n\nSir Thomas Browne\nAlas, it seems the Dobson catalogue raisonne may have to join a list of lost or imagined catalogues, alongside such magisterial lists as The Map Reference Points Of 400 Duckponds Mentioned In Binder's Lieder and All Pebblehead's Cravats, Illustrated And Itemised.\n###"}

This religious puppet is an excellent choice for puppet ministry and children's church. Use him to teach scripture and for many bible lessons. This biblical puppet is fully functional for both children and adults and can be used as a full body puppet or remove the legs to make a light weight rod style half body puppet. These puppets are similar to Muppet style puppets.\nThis Jesus puppet was made with great care and love and was designed to depict Christ in a loving, kind approachable way. We wanted a Jesus that children would want to know, love and cherish. He is in a garb of the biblical days with sandals and a satin deep red shawl that represents the blood shed on the cross and royalty as the King of Kings. All of this big mouth puppet's clothes are completely removable including his shoes. He has accentuated fingers, feet with toes (to wear sandals) and sewn elbow and knee joints. You can enter this lovely puppet from either the back in a ventriloquist puppet style or from the bottom like a standard half body puppet. He has a natural tanned skinned flesh tone and has big brown eyes and dark brown yarn hair and a short cropped beard. A plastic attachment is available to make the puppet appear to walk on water. This fully functional performance puppet is not only totally functional but he has been made affordable for puppet ministries with a tight budget.\nThanks to Private Eye for bringing this to my attention.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Thirty Years Ago\n", "completion": " Another thing I found in my recent rummage was a small batch of cuttings from the legendary Factsheet Five magazine. Indefatigable editor Mike Gunderloy was a generous reviewer of my (now) out of print Malice Aforethought Press pamphlets and books. Here are some of his observations:\n\nHouse Of Turps. A curious and delightful little booklet. Key writes in a sort of manic academic style, tracing the life of the obscure chemist-chieftain Slobodan Curpin as he staggers through the early days of the scientific revolution. Experimental windsocks, poultice-making, and a civilisation beneath the Arctic ice all make perfect sense here. Much better than the usual dreary textbook treatment of this sort of thing. Maddeningly sensible and discordant at the same time.\nThe Immense Duckpond Pamphlet. More bizarre prose from the fevered mind of Frank Key. This is a sort of murder mystery, replete with an ogre who proves to be a detective, soup recipes, signs from bizarre pubs, potato science, and even duckponds. Frank has a style all his own, which most of us could not approach even with the use of large quantities of illicit drugs.\nTwitching And Shattered. This is a collection of many of Frank's shorter works, including the infamous \"Tales of Hoon\" and his series of dustjackets for forthcoming books. It also contains the wildly funny \"Some Lesser-Known Editions Of The Bible\", an exercise in parodied scholarship that had me rolling on the floor. I like Frank's writing quite a bit. He has a perfectly deadpan style that can string together the most utter nonsense and make it fascinating. Personally, I find this style delicious, whether Frank is writing of mysterious foreign agents, trips to Iceland, or bicycles and earwigs.

{"prompt": "How the Quotations Are Selected\n", "completion": " A number of readers have asked me how I choose the quotations with which each Hooting Yard bulletin begins. I wish it was as simple as saying \"I browse through books and find a sentence or paragraph that tickles my fancy\", for who among us does not like having their fancy tickled? In truth, the process is hideously complicated.\nWhen I developed the initial concept for this website towards the end of last year, covering page after page of a big writing tablet with notes, diagrams, graphs, squiggles and, it must be said, the occasional savage doodle born of fractiousness, it seemed to me that mere whim was an unacceptable way of making the selection. After all, the rest of the content adheres to a system--albeit a deep system--and so should the quotations. I therefore designed an Oulipian constraint to govern my choices. Careful study of the quotations will thus reveal that there is a profound logic at work determining which words, by which author, are excerpted at any particular point on the calendar.\nSo abstruse is the scheme that the launch of Hooting Yard, which ought to have taken place in October 2003, was delayed until mid-December. I spent six or seven weeks devising the system, having cast aside the original writing tablet and obtained a fresh one just to work on what I code-named, like a military adventure, Operation Quote-of-the-Day For The Hooting Yard Website, or OQOTDFTHYW for short. Without wishing to lay bare the rules by which the system operates, I think it is worth pointing out that today, for example, being the tenth of November, the title of the book cited includes the word poise, and the extract itself consists of four sentences, two of which refer to an apparatus designed to deflect rainfall.\n###"}

So I lifted the needle off of the disc, I filed the record back under Misc., and I unlocked the door with a big iron key, and I climbed up the stairs with the pig beside me, and we ran outside into the battering sun, and down to the riverbank where we had fun, the pig and me paddling, splashing about, with voles and otters. Then I heard a shout. A fellow was waving from the opposite bank. At first I thought he was some kind of crank. But it was Paul Weller, to my amaze, dressed as he was in his Style Council days. Now the pig liked The Jam, it was that kind of pig. It had never gone near a Style Council gig. It grunted and trotted off back to the cellar. So was my pig/river idyll marred by Paul Weller.\n###"}

On the other hand, when a man is tired of Hooting Yard (not that such a mental aberration is remotely credible, of course) there are other Yards he can investigate. I have just returned from a stay in Whitby, where, among other Yards, I was happy to spot both Dark Entry Yard and Arguments Yard. Whitby is all Yards and Steps. Of the latter, the one hundred and ninety-nine steps leading up to the ruined Abbey are the most noteworthy, but there are plenty of less celebrated Steps to clamber up and down, many of then perilous and steep.\nDark Entry Steps can be found opposite the railway station, which has a somewhat battered and semi-derelict air, and has but a single platform and a single track, on which a train plies between Whitby and Middlesbrough, back and forth all day, but not at night.\nMy little trip to Whitby goes some way to explaining the eerie silence that has crept over Hooting Yard of late.

That the strength of Hercules is for deed, not misdeed ; and that his club--the favourite weapon, also, of the Athenian hero Theseus, whose form is the best inheritance left to us by the greatest of Greek sculptors, (it is in the Elgin room of the British Museum, and I shall have much to tell you of him--especially how he helped Hercules in his utmost need, and how he invented mixed vegetable soup)--was for subduing monsters and cruel persons, and was of olive-wood.\n(My emphasis.)\nIt may be that my classical education is scanty, but I had no idea mixed vegetable soup was invented by Theseus. I am hoping, with undisguised excitement, that Ruskin keeps his promise and tells me more about this in a subsequent letter.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Name That Boy!\n", "completion": " I read somewhere last week that Mohammed is now the second most popular name for newborn boys in the UK. It strikes me as a bit odd that you can get beheaded for drawing a picture of the Prophet Mohammed, but it's perfectly fine to attach his name to your son. Still, there is much about Islam that I find perplexing, such as a recent fatwa in Egypt which allows an unmarried woman to work in an office alongside men so long as she breastfeeds each of them five times to create a familial bond. Now there's a sensible idea.\nAnyway, I was prompted to think about boys' names, and more particularly what name I would ideally like to see in the number one spot above Mohammed. Readers will know that I am very keen on Sebag, but my current choice to become the most popular boys' name is Suetonius.\nNot only is it a splendid, resounding name, but of course it also commemorates the author of The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars. Suetonius--whose full name was Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus--can be seen as a kind of Dobson-like figure, in that many of his works are terminally out of print. That is, they are lost, possibly forever. We know that he wrote, among other things, Physical Defects Of Mankind, Lives Of Famous Whores, and an essay on Critical Signs Used In Books, but no trace of them survives. Luckily, we do have the rattling good read that is The Lives Of The Twelve Caesars.\nGeorge Costanza, in Seinfeld, favoured the names Soda and Seven, neither of which holds a candle to Suetonius in my opinion. So if there are any expectant parents reading this, and your newborn is a boy, do the decent thing and name him after the Roman Ur-Dobson. And mothers please note! While I would recommend breastfeeding, it would probably be a good idea to limit the milk supply to little Suetonius, rather than sharing it out among those unprepossessing gits in the accounts department.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Mr Beale And The Lovecraftian Monster From The Sea\n", "completion": " A certain Mr Beale, in the nineteenth century, was collecting shells on the shores of the Bonin Islands when he encountered \"a most extraordinary animal\" creeping on its eight legs towards the water. \"It seemed alarmed and made great efforts to escape, but the naturalist had no idea of consenting to the termination of so unexpected an interview with the odd-looking stranger,\" so he trod on one of its legs and then grabbed hold of another one and then \"gave it a sudden jerk to disengage it\" (the poor thing was clinging to the rock). \"This seemed to excite it into fury\" which by now was hardly to be wondered at and, \"it suddenly let go its hold of the rock and sprang on its assailant's arm, which was bare, and fixing itself by its suckers endeavoured to attack him with its powerful beak. The sensation of horror caused by this unexpected assault may be readily imagined. Mr Beale states that the cold and slimy grasp of the ferocious animal induced a sensation extremely sickening, and he found it requisite to call to the captain, who was occupied in gathering shells at a little distance.\"\nI don't know what Mr Beale had expected, but they proceeded to jump on the wretched creature and hack it with the boat knife: \"It did not surrender, till the limbs by which it so tenaciously adhered were successively cut off.\" The Victorians were notoriously wasteful of wildlife and we may be sure that Mr Beale and the captain did not cook and eat this octopus. We are told that cephalopods are unusually intelligent, which strikes us, prejudiced as we are against things with tiny heads and eight legs, as strange but caused me to feel some sympathy with Mr Beale's antagonist. It must have experienced its own sensation of horror on being confronted with a heavily bewhiskered Victorian naturalist.\nfrom Fish, Flesh And Good Red Herring : A Gallimaufry by Alice Thomas Ellis (2004)\n###"}
{"prompt": "American Snipe\n", "completion": " Clint Eastwood's new film American Snipe has broken box-office records in its first week on release. It is quite an achievement for the octogenarian director, the more so, perhaps, given its ornithological theme. American Snipe tells the true story of a snipe with a record number of kills. The film follows the bird as it flies around, swooping down to catch and gobble up crane flies, horse flies, deer flies, beetles, dragonflies, crickets, grasshoppers, ants, mayflies, butterflies, caddis flies and moths. No explicit moral judgements are made, though at one point an ornithologist, observing the slaughter, remarks \"They're just insects\".\nThe film has provoked controversy in the United States, winning plaudits from right-wingers while those on the liberal left have condemned it for painting a picture of unalloyed avian savagery, instead of showing nature as twee and cuddly.\nThe role of the American snipe is played by an award-winning snipe with a particularly long slender pointy bill.\n\n###"}

At the quayside, I hurried to my chalet and I slapped the cod on my tabletop and, with great savagery, I gutted it with my bare hands, exposing its innards. I took the liver over to the draining-board, where I had ready a glass jar into the neck of which I'd stuck a funnel. I squeezed and squeezed the liver until my fists ached, until every last drop of oil had dripped down the funnel into the jar. Then I threw the funnel away and took a big iron spoon, and I poured oil out of the jar onto the spoon and inserted the spoon in my mouth and I drank the oil greedily, desperately, gurglingly.\nAnd that, my syphilitic friends, is how I preserve my health, and why I can gambol 'cross the greensward with the zip and vim of a monkey, when the fancy takes me.\n###"}

His preferred manner of answering the telephone was to shout \"Ahoy!\" This seems to me far more exciting than a dull \"Hello\", and it's a pity that Bell's habit never caught on. It is, of course, never too late to overturn various social conventions. If we all started yelling \"Ahoy!\" when answering the telephone, the world would be just a little bit more pleasurable.\n.\nBell : Ahoy!\nOn a vaguely related note, I take this opportunity to mention that the first ever message sent in Morse code, by Samuel Morse himself, was \"What hath God wrought?\"\n###"}

Five distinct emotions are raised: 1. Interest; 2. Fear; 3. Pleasure or sympathy; 4. Grief, almost to tears; 5. A sudden reversion to mirth, and \"All's well that ends well,\" a great desideratum in baby estimation.

Coleridge, his head shrouded in a fog, read poetry badly and moaned gloomily. The dreams of Jean Paul, the crow that loved the storm, reverberated across the Lake District... There were others who helped themselves to dreams. Robert Southey experimented with laughing gas.

{"prompt": "An Elocution Lesson\n", "completion": " When I was first invited to present a show on ResonanceFM, way back in 2004, my immediate enthusiasm was tempered by a certain anxiety. I was fretful that perhaps I did not have a \"radio voice\", and that, as soon as I was stuck in front of a microphone, I would screech like a screech-owl. Listeners would lunge towards the off-button, desperate to stop the hideous caterwauling and lapse into blessed silence. So before accepting the offer, I took myself off to an elocutionist.\nMiss Blossom Christsblood's establishment was on the top floor of a tall and ramshackle and quite possibly condemned building in an insalubrious part of town. It did not enjoy a lift, and by the time I had lugged myself up the stairs I was breathless and panting. Before she even said hello, Miss Blossom was intent on exacting payment from me, in cash, for my first lesson. I emptied my pockets of coinage, which she immediately squirrelled away in what looked like a battered tobacco tin.\nI was given to understand that my lesson would begin when I stopped panting, which I duly did several minutes later. During this time, Miss Blossom paid no attention to me whatsoever, but busied herself with her birds, innumerable birds housed in innumerable birdcages hanging from innumerable rafters. I am no ornithologist, but I think at least one of them was a screech-owl.\nEventually my lesson began.\n\"When speaking aloud,\" announced Miss Blossom, in a screech, \"The most important thing is the formation of the vole sounds.\"\nIt was at this point I decided to cut my losses and leave. Over a decade has passed since that unfortunate episode. In that time, I have continued to present Hooting Yard On The Air every week, with the occasional lacuna, and I do not think that at any time I have found it necessary to imitate the sound of a vole, nor a beaver, nor a shrew, nor even an otter.\n###"}

The beaux distinguished themselves by their adroitness in replenishing this pot from a huge copper teakettle. To sweeten the beverage, a lump of sugar was laid beside each cup, and the company alternately nibbled and sipped with great decorum; until an improvement was introduced by a shrewd and economic old lady, which was to suspend, by a string from the ceiling, a large lump directly over the tea table, so that it could be swung from mouth to mouth.\n\"At these primitive tea parties, the utmost propriety and dignity prevailed,--no flirting nor coquetting; no romping of young ladies; no self-satisfied struttings of wealthy gentlemen, with their brains in their pockets, nor amusing conceits and monkey divertisements of smart young gentlemen, with no brains at all.\"\nFrom A History Of New York by Diedrich Knickerbocker (Washington Irving), 1809\n###"}

{"prompt": "I Is for Index\n", "completion": " Episode nine in our not-quite-daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet, this time without any potato pictures\nLike the novelist Samuel Richardson, Doctor Cack was an enthusiastic indexer of his own work.

The bulk of the contents he wrote himself, allowing the occasional interjection from Ruhugu, Moop, Trellis and the others. Only Jubble had been barred from its pages, because he was unhinged.\nEvery five years, Doctor Cack published, as a separate volume, a cumulative index to the Bulletin. His skills lay in thematic rather than purely alphabetic indexing. Indeed, Scridge has remarked that, like Prynne's Histrio-Mastix (1633), Doctor Cack's indices are often more readable than the texts from which they are eked.\nOf the most recent edition of the Quinquennial Collection Of Instructive Sentiments, Maxims, Descriptions, Footnotes, Evasions, Queries & Accusations Contained In The Bulletin Of Potato Science & Related Matters, Digested Under Proper Heads, Scridge reported that he was \"driven to hilarity\" by the entry for Potato Cyst Eelworm, an infection which stunts and withers the crop, with haulm dying down prematurely and tubers the size of marbles resulting.\nOf course, Scridge cannot always be trusted, for he is a deceitful toad.

{"prompt": "1848\n", "completion": " Zamoyski is adept at painterly scene-setting. One vivid paragraph shows the Paris revolution of 1848, which sent King Louis Philippe scurrying into exile and ignited populist insurrections across Europe, as caused by a clumsy bandsman with a big drum. After a day of innocuous, anti-climactic Paris demonstrations, a company of soldiers stationed on a boulevard corner tried to retreat from a rowdy but hardly murderous crowd into the courtyard of the ministry of foreign affairs. They were blocked because the musician carrying the drum got jammed in the porte-cochere of the ministry. As a result some soldiers had to turn and face the crowd, grew rattled, and fired shots that left over 30 dead. The mangled corpses were piled onto a wagon, which was trundled through the streets of Paris by rabble-rousers crying for revenge. It was the drummer, rather than the previous uprisings in Palermo and Naples, and the granting of constitutions in Sicily, Sardinia and Tuscany, that triggered the continent-wide uprisings of 1848.\nRupert Davenport-Hines reviewing Phantom Terror: The Threat of Revolution and the Repression of Liberty, 1789--1848 by Adam Zamoyski in The Spectator.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Swoons, Shudders, Convulsions & Dread\n", "completion": " Here is a further enlightening snippet from Hargrave Jennings' Curious Things Of The Outside World, Last Fire (1861) :\n\"Amatus Lusitanus relates the case of a monk who fainted when he beheld a rose, and never quitted his cell while that flower was blooming. Orfila (a less questionable authority) gives the account of the painter Vincent, who was seized with violent vertigo, and swooned, when there were roses in the room. Voltaire gives the history of an officer who was thrown into convulsions and lost his senses by having pinks in his chamber. Orfila also relates the instance of a lady, of forty-six years of age, of a hale constitution, who could never be present when a decoction of linseed was preparing, being troubled in the course of a few minutes with a general swelling of the face, followed by fainting and a loss of the intellectual faculties, which symptoms continued for four-and-twenty hours. Montaigne remarks on this subject, that there were men who dreaded an apple more than a cannon-ball. Zimmerman tells us of a lady who could not endure the feeling of silk and satin, and shuddered when she touched the velvety skin of a peach : other ladies cannot bear the feel of fur. Boyle records the case of a man who experienced a natural abhorrence of honey ; a young man invariably fainted when a servant swept his room. Hippocrates mentions one Nicanor, who swooned whenever he heard a flute ; and Shakespeare has alluded to the strange effect of the bagpipe. Boyle fell into a syncope when he heard the splashing of water ; Scaliger turned pale on the sight of water-cresses ; Erasmus experienced febrile symptoms when smelling fish ; the Duke d'Epernon swooned on beholding a leveret, although a hare did not produce the same effect ; Tycho Brahe fainted at the sight of a fox, Henry III of France at that of a cat, and Marshal D'Albret at a pig.

Many, especially those of a higher degree, suffer from them severely. They form the last term of the series--stomach-ache, head-ache, fainting, spasm. They may be occasioned by magnets, by terrestrial magnetism, by poles of crystals, by amorphous, unipolar, bodies, either odo-positive or odo-negative, by human odic poles, by the prismatic rays of either the solar or lunar spectrum, particularly the green rays, by down passes, but oftener by up passes, by charging and conduction, whether immediate or approximative, by the mere odic atmosphere, by the psychical action of insult, grief, anxiety, fear, annoyance, jealousy, quarrels, mental exertion, joy, or even dreams. They are most conspicuous in the extremities, solar plexus, and head. They can be artificially excited and calmed, or depart naturally. They often follow a tolerably similar course from the toes through the abdomen to the brain, and thence down the spinal cord, like a pass.

{"prompt": "Jejune\n", "completion": " In her \"Mind Your Language\" column in The Spectator, Dot Wordsworth turns her attention to jejune. It is one of those words (like fulsome) where an erroneous usage is now so common that the correct, original meaning may be lost entirely. Because of its similarity to juvenile and French jeune, jejune is misused to mean childish, naive, callow. (Dot Wordsworth suggests George Bernard Shaw may be to blame.) This is the (wrong) sense given in the finest use of jejune in cinema history:\nWhat jejune actually means is thin, meagre, unsatisfying. Thank heavens there is at least one man who uses the word correctly. Blockbusting potboilerist Pebblehead has embarked on a new series of gaudy paperback potboilers which purport to be sequels, or prequels, or simply complete rewrites, of acknowledged classics. The first title to appear is Pebblehead's take on Richard Llewellyn's 1939 novel How Green Was My Valley. Recalling the privations of his childhood in Pang Hill Orphanage, Pebblehead's book is entitled How Jejune Was My Gruel. It begins:\nHow jejune was my gruel. Oh, how jejune it was. I remember so vividly how, when given my bowl of gruel in the orphanage dining hall, I was struck by its jejunosity. Has ever a poor orphan child, who grew up to become an internationally successful bestselling paperbackist, been faced with gruel so jejune? I think not.\nA film adaptation of How Jejune Was My Gruel is currently in production, starring anybody the producers can find whose career is not in tatters following allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n###"}

But Ulf had been sniffing glue. Ulf found Ugo's ma sitting on a stool. \"Ugo's ma,\" said Ulf, \"Ugo has turned blue. His hood is snagged on a tack.\" Ugo's ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool and ran to Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Ugo's ma spat out her chew, and it landed in a pot of glue. It was the glue Ugo's pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo's ma unsnagged Ugo's hood from the tack. \"Ack\" said Ugo. \"Ooo, Ugo's ma, I knew you would know what to do,\" said Ulf. Ugo's ma clouted Ulf on the head with a spoon, and confiscated his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass. At Saint Hector's Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.\n###"}

They then begin to jump with strange gestures, repeating this exercise with all their might until they are exhausted, so that it not unfrequently happens that women who, like the Maenades, practise these religious exercises, are carried away from the midst of them in a state of syncope, whilst the remaining members of the congregations, for miles together, on their way home, terrify those whom they meet by the sight of such demoniacal ravings.\" -- Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker, The Black Death And The Dancing Mania\n###"}

I have written elsewhere, at some length, about wafers, and I do not intend to repeat that pretty little escapade, not when I am standing at the bottom of a staircase down which I fully expect a ghoul to traipse. Upon the descent of the ghoul, I shall climb the staircase myself and enter the chamber from which it has been expelled.\nMy arrival may well cause consternation. A ghoul leaves, and almost immediately afterwards a chubby man wearing filthy gloves appears.

I can use the filthiness of my gloves as an excuse for not doing so. It is an excuse I have flourished on many occasions, not always successfully. Like the ghoul, I have been expelled from chambers and attics and parlours and even from cow sheds.\nBut I will not be expelled from the chamber at the top of the staircase, for it is written that I shall dwell therein, unto the last trump.

His tin shadow, his dockside groans, his futile picking at unbuttons... there is so much material.  But \"emptiness\" and \"uncertainty\" may be more troublesome.\nOne uncertainty is to what extent I can get away with writing about prose I have not yet written.

{"prompt": "Reincarnation News\n", "completion": " Let me begin with a caveat. Reincarnation is not a topic I know much of, so I may be about to write something inaccurate and simple-minded. I am under the impression that those who claim past lives always seem to have been at, or close to, the seat of power. Napoleon's manservant and Cleopatra's handmaiden are popular \"phantom memories\", or, if more anonymous, the previous corporeal existence has usually become embroiled in major historical events--a footsoldier at Agincourt, or a spectator, knitting, as the tumbrils rolled through Paris during the French Revolution. No one ever recalls a past life as a simple peasant scrubbling around to eke a few potatoes from the muck, which is what the vast majority of our forebears spent most of their time doing, regional substitutes for potatoes notwithstanding.\nThen, when it comes to posited future lives, there is a consensus that one's return is as a non-human. Cats and dogs are popular choices (or aspirations), as are horses and other majestic and elegant beasts. Those lacking self-esteem may bemoan their likely reappearance as a worm, but that's about it. Nobody says, thrillingly, \"I think I'll come back as a locust!\", do they?\nThe point of all this is to pose a question. Is it feasible for someone to be reincarnated as a multinational corporation? Consider the evidence. Exactly twenty eight years ago, on 1st April 1976, the painter Max Ernst died. Onthe very same day (exciting emphasis), Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak formed Apple Computers. Spooky? I think so. Is Apple the first global surrealist company? And if--as seems likely--it is, how does that affect its business operations, its day-to-day running, its mission statements and project schedules and, by all the angels in heaven!, its human resources policies? An in-depth investigation is urgently needed, but I haven't got the time. Perhaps a reader or two might take this up and report back.\n###"}

Its 'waist' was girdled with a ring of repelatron radiators for exerting a repulsion force when it wanted to move, by repelling itself away from nearby objects. Below the repelatrons was an hourglass-shaped power unit, housing a solar-charged battery. The power unit, in turn, was mounted on a pancake-shaped transportation unit. This unit was equipped with both casters and a sort of caterpillar-crawler arrangement for the contrivance to get about over obstacles. Inside was a gyro-stabilizer to keep the whole device upright.

Their houses are ultra neat, with outbreaks of supernaturally competent DIY, like externalisations of the kind of mind that adjusts a complex system until it's just so. His is surrounded by a runaway experiment in growing wildflowers, and has a car in the driveway which has been awaiting repairs for many months. Inside, rampaging grandchildren zoom about. A keen Morris dancer, with a countryman's voice, he was largely responsible for Chevaline, the naval update of Polaris, in the 1970s. As I talked to him, he sat by his fire; an old Panama hat wobbled on top of the stack of books next to his armchair.

His student Porphyry, who edited, polished and arranged the Enneads for publication, had the thankless preliminary task of transcribing Plotinus' shoddy and near-illegible scribbles. That was almost two thousand years ago, yet in many ways it describes perfectly the working relationship that obtained between Dobson and Marigold Chew. The out of print pamphleteer had an abysmal scrawl, possibly because of the unusual way he clutched his pencil, like a monkey with a pin-cushion. It may be difficult to make sense of that simile, but go and lie down in a darkened room and screw your eyes tightly shut and everything will become clear. For salvaging any clarity at all from Dobson's notebooks, we have Marigold Chew to thank. Without her, not one of those majestic pamphlets would ever have been tucked lovingly on to the shelves of a motorway service station or airport bookstall.\nAmong much that they had in common, Porphyry and Marigold Chew were excellent proofreaders, capable of spotting the tiniest error and correcting it. This is not a job you would give to the American cinema player Bruce Willis. Mr Willis is apparently a keen contributor to blogs and chatrooms, and when other readers pointed out his many infelicities of grammar and spelling, he issued the immortal retort \"proofreading is for pussies\".

{"prompt": "Conspiracy Of Silence\n", "completion": " My grassy knoll potsage the other day prompted a keen-eyed reader to bring to my attention something called Project Unspeakable. According to its Facecloth page, this \"project\" aims to \"challenge the silence surrounding the assassination\" of President Kennedy and three other \"leaders for peace\" (Robert Kennedy, Dr King (as we must always call him), and Malcolm X).\nEr ... what silence is that, precisely? There are so many books about the JFK assassination that even Vincent Bugliosi hasn't had time--in the twenty-plus years he worked on his book--to read all of them. Not to mention the magazine articles, television documentaries, and feature films. The deaths of the other three have not attracted quite that level of attention, but they have hardly been ignored and cast into the dustbin of history ((c) Leon Trotsky, another murderee who surely ought to be on Project Unspeakable's list. Oh, hang on, he wasn't American, and he was ice-picked by a Stalinist agent, so in Unspeakable circles that's probably all above board.)\nThe \"conspiracy of silence\" is about as silent as Hooting Yard, which as you know hardly ever shuts up.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Cuppid\n", "completion": " Cuppid is, as you might expect, related to Cupid, although there is a lot more than that extra P to help you distinguish between them. Cuppid is composed of both toxic and non-toxic gases, and tinkles a little golden bell whenever it alights upon the hairy back of a bison, which it often does, for Cuppid's favourite haunts are the vast plains of North America. I say it because Cuppid is, if not exactly a hermaphrodite, neither male nor female, although sometimes when its gases cool and take on liquid form it can bear a fugitive resemblance to Sonja Henie (1912-1969), the legendary Norwegian figure skating champion. Such moments can be dangerous for Cuppid, for it is volatile, and seeks warmer air urgently to return to its gaseous state.\nCuppid is invoked by farmers and by those who work with timber, for it brings them luck. Conversely, wrestlers and plutocrats live in fear of a visitation by Cuppid, and tremble at its approach. You can be sure that if you see a trembling plutocrat, Cuppid is not far away.\nSome say Cuppid can be trapped in an envelope or small carton and used for both good and ill. The common feature of such tales is that not one of them has ever been verified.\nToy plastic Cuppids, coated with a special varnish to ape the appearance of gas, have recently become popular as gifts for children in Dawlish, Oswestry and Uttoxeter. This geographical exclusivity is due to factors unique to Cuppid, including the risk of suffocation, impending thirst, and three or four empty metal pails lined up in a row on the site of a long ago mudslide.\nCuppid rotates.\n\nLeft : Cupid. Right : Sonja Henie, or possibly Cuppid at low temperature.\n###"}

Agent Blot swam out to it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becalmed Agent Blot took the oars and he rowed to the mud-splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of the boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plodded his way in his wellington boots to the pig farmer's hut down the lane, and he felled the brute with a thwack of his fist and bound him up with a chain. Agent Blot dragged the pig farmer off to the prison, bang in the centre of town.

See how they embrace, each chimera recognising in the other his own misery. The chin of the newly-confident child-headed swan seems to jut in new-found defiance of the world! I'm not sure if a beak can jut, so I shall reserve judgement on the swan-headed child--in any case it seems to me an altogether more ambiguous character. Such a firm grip on the child-headed swan's neck; I infer here the crafty sense in the swan-headed child's tiny bonce that it is the benefactor of this symbiotic relationship. After all, the swan-headed child may be dextrous and bipedal, but it is led around by a pea-sized brain. The child-headed swan, for its part, has a fey, ethereal beauty... but when the head matures into adulthood the neck will be powerless to support it, and what then? What then?\"\nThough I would swear by the crumpled cloth of Anaxagrotax's winding-sheet that the snap does indeed show Raymond Roussel as a tiny, so forceful and convincing is Mr Trenery's argument that I am putting the series on hold pending further investigations.

Some years ago, to my delight, I worked out that the great man's full name, Charles Robert Darwin, is an anagram of 'rectal winds abhorrer'. Unfortunately for my anagram, the meanings of words, like species, can evolve. On the rare occasions that Darwin mentioned his problems to friends, he always used the word 'flatulence'. Nowadays, we think of flatulence as being synonymous with farting, but in Darwin's day it meant (as it technically still does) an accumulation of gases in the alimentary canal. While I'm sure that Darwin must have vented his excess gas one way or the other, there's no reason to believe that his farts were uncontrollable.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The God With Paws\n", "completion": " There is a tribe of people who dwell beyond Those Purple Hills who worship a god with paws. It has no other name, or at least not one that is ever spoken aloud by the members of the tribe, nor written down, for they do not write as we would understand the term. The god with paws apparently forbids any image to be made of it, so we have no idea what it looks like. How many paws does it have? How tall is it? Does it have just one head, or many? What living creature does it resemble, if any? We do not know the answers to any of these questions, for the tribespeople are unwilling or unable to answer them. For the same reason, it is futile to quiz them about the part played in their culture by the god with paws, for they grow mute, or--the chatterboxes among them--change the subject, or simply wander away to check their stockpiles of macadamia nuts.\nThere has been some conjecture that by worshipping a \"god with paws\", the tribespeople imply the existence of other gods--the god with hooves, perhaps, or the god with flippers--but no hard evidence has come to light.\nThe god with paws inhabits a hut on the edge of the tribe's village. No one is allowed within a certain distance of it, but at sunset each day, everyone gathers in a circle around the hut and stares at it in rapt, if somewhat ill-tempered, silence. It is thought that the people are given instructions by the god with paws, communicated in some unknown extrasensory manner, but the nature of these commands, and whether or not the people take a blind bit of notice of them, is unclear.\nI have knitted myself a pair of paw-like mittens and intend to impersonate the god of paws, just to see what happens. I will let you know.\n###"}

Ghouls will oft times take you into their chill embrace and drip ghastly ectoplasm from their extremities. This can be such a disgusting experience that your nerves will be bedizened before you even have time to shout \"Allahu Akbar!\" or some similar appeal to a deity. Not that calling upon any god, not even some of the Aztec ones, will do you much good with a ghoul on the attack. By and large, ghouls are godless, and have no concept of spiritual fervour or fear. Being semi-transparent and insubstantial, they are also, regrettably, impervious to being beaten with shovels or fire-tongs. How, then, can you defend yourself and your loved ones against their malign implacability?\nHere are some tips from a pamphlet recently issued by the government's newly-appointed Ghoul Czar:\nA flamboyant ping pong technique unnerves most ghouls. Practise relentlessly, even on the Day of Rest.\nGhouls hate syrup. Keep plenty of tins in your pantry.\nA lopsided cake-stand artfully placed on the dresser will throw a ghoul into a quandary.\nIf you have a pond, keep a pet swan.\nRecital of Sylvia Plath poems can send ghouls back to the netherworld from which they emerged. But never, ever whisper a word from the works of Ted Hughes in their presence.\nSlack-jawed farmhands can be positioned between you and a ghoul to stave it off.\nIf you are staying in a ghoul-haunted guest-house, insist on having a trapdoor in your room.\nSpray the air with essence of toffee apple.\nOrnate stippled eider duck decor baffles the keenest ghoul.\nAn unctuous demeanour will behove you well.\nBear in mind that there is no known defence against the Brechtian ghoul.\nLike racehorses, ghouls can be nobbled.

I would recommend a powerfully fragrant nosegay.\nOnce our eyes become accustomed to the gloom, we can see a midden of unutterable filth. Such is the home life of our own dear peasantry. Well, mayhap not so dear. You will be thankful for the nosegay. You may also wish to have armed yourself with a sharp pointy stick, to keep the peasant at bay should he approach you. But there is little danger of that, because he is wholly occupied with veneration. He is sprawled on the ground, mouth open, dribbling freely, his idiot gaze fixated upon a statue of Our Lady of the Bumpkins. It is raised above the piles of gruesome clutter, resting on a sort of shrine or altar. It emits an unearthly glow, and is the one clean thing for miles around. When he is not venerating it, the dribbling peasant spends untold hours spraying it with polish from an aerosol canister and buffing it with rags.\nWe poke him with the pointy stick to gain his attention. Still dribbling, he turns his head to look at us.\n\"Can you not venerate Our Lady of the Bumpkins with your mouth closed?\" we ask.\nIn reply, the peasant grunts, and returns to his dribbling veneration.\nBefore leaving, we note that he collects his dribbles in a rough-hewn wooden cup, artfully placed beneath his chin.\nAnd later, when we call in to the village's one-stop-shop to return our rented nosegay and pointy stick, we note that there are shelves stacked with similar cups of dribble.

In truth, the day was not blue, for there was frightful storminess, a blizzard of hailstones, and much tempest and wrack. Nevertheless, when looking back, I remember other things. I remember how we laughed even though our picnic plans were dashed. I remember how we pretended the cow in the field was a Magus, bewitching us. I remember how we ran back to the house and spent the afternoon playing a game of Ayn Rand!

It contains a splendid anecdote which I can now share with you:\nIn 1994 my sister, who lives in the United States, was on a visit back to England for a couple of weeks. One day we decided to pay a visit of homage to St Patrick's Roman Catholic cemetery in Leytonstone, wherein lie buried the five Franciscan nuns whose drowning in the mouth of the Thames in December 1875 was the event which sparked Gerard Manley Hopkins to write The Wreck Of The Deutschland. It was an overcast day in late summer, and we trudged aimlessly around the stones, unclear as to what sort of tomb or edifice we were looking for. It is a fairly small cemetery, and after half an hour or so we were on the point of abandoning the search--I think it was beginning to rain--but as we were going back towards the gates we noticed that a light was on in the shabby one-storey building near the entrance. We went in, and were greeted by some sort of cemetery attendant. My sister began, rather haltingly, to explain that we were looking for the grave of some nuns who had been drowned and whom the poet Hopkins had written a...--The attendant held up a hand to stop my sister in mid-flow and, looking over his shoulder towards an ajar door behind him, called \"Oi, Mario! Them nuns what drowned...\" Enter Mario, another cemetery worker, who promptly led us to the plot, asked if we were German (as the nuns had been), and explained that \"quite a few people come to look at them nuns\". My sister began a brief tutorial on Hopkins, but I think Mario had heard it all before--having delivered us to our tombstone, he rapidly headed back to whatever he had been doing before.

{"prompt": "Map Tip\n", "completion": " I think it highly likely that quite a few Hooting Yard readers will have woken up this morning thinking to themselves, \"Gosh! It really is time I bought myself a map of Switzerland! As soon as I have done my ablutions and chomped my breakfast I shall head off to the cartographers' bazaar to make a judicious purchase!\"\nIt is thus fortunate that I can pass on to you some very sensible advice in the matter, courtesy of that excellent Mr Ruskin.\nThe Original von Keller's Zweiter Reisekarte der Schweitz (1844) is, says Ruskin,  \"the only map of Switzerland which has ever been executed with common sense and intelligence\". (Praeterita, Volume II, Chapter XI, paragraph 215.) Lord knows there are plenty of maps of Switzerland made with foolhardiness and stupidity, and you might have gone and bought one of those. Notch that up as another triumph for Hooting Yard's map-procurement advisory service.\nThe illustration below is a detail from von Keller's earlier 1825 map of Switzerland. It has clearly been executed with somewhat less common sense and intelligence than the 1844 version, but is still far more sensible than the average Swiss map.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Gruel In Pewter\n", "completion": " According to the Press Association, Scientists will serve gruel to the public today after recreating the porridge made famous by Oliver Twist. Members of the Royal Society of Chemistry produced the recipe, consisting of water, oats and milk, after consulting historic sources as well as Charles Dickens' novel. The Victorian workhouse staple, which will be prepared by French chef Fabian in the society's kitchen, will be ladled into pewter dishes and served to passersby at 11am by the society's own \"Beadle\" at the entrance of its London home at Burlington House, Piccadilly. An RSC spokesman said: \"Diners asking for more will be rejected.\"\nSadly, I read this too late to be able to get to Piccadilly in time for my free pewter pot of gruel. I could console myself, however, that it would not have been a new experience for me. I think I have mentioned elsewhere that I spent a period, earlier in my life, subsisting on a diet of gruel. This was not for reasons of ill-health or a traumatised digestive system or even abject poverty. My flatmate at the time and I undertook the gruel-only diet as an experiment in asceticism, puritanical fanaticism, and self-righteousness. Indeed, as I read the Press Association report it struck me that the RSC recipe seems rather luxurious, adding a slop of milk to the oats and water. No such treats for us!\nMy grueldom took place many years ago, early in the Thatcher administration, but the lessons I learned then, and the stiffening of my moral fibre, have remained with me. In fact, whenever the opportunity arises, I like to announce that \"I lived on a diet of gruel, you know,\" to whomsoever is listening. Curiously enough, this is almost invariably met by laughter and ridicule.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Matters Pertaining To Bees (19th Century)\n", "completion": " Richard Carter of Gruts has kindly drawn my attention to this splendid passage from an autobiographical sketch by Thomas Henry Huxley:\n\nI was born about eight o'clock in the morning on the 4th of May, 1825, at Ealing, which was, at that time, as quiet a little country village as could be found within half a dozen miles of Hyde Park Corner. Now it is a suburb of London with, I believe, 30,000 inhabitants. My father was one of the masters in a large semi-public school which at one time had a high reputation. I am not aware that any portents preceded my arrival in this world; but, in my childhood, I remember hearing a traditional account of the manner in which I lost the chance of an endowment of great practical value. The windows of my mother's room were open, in consequence of the unusual warmth of the weather. For the same reason, probably, a neighbouring bee-hive had swarmed, and the new colony, pitching on the window-sill, was making its way into the room when the horrified nurse shut down the sash. If that well-meaning woman had only abstained from her ill-timed interference, the swarm might have settled on my lips, and I should have been endowed with that mellifluous eloquence which, in this country, leads far more surely than worth, capacity, or honest work, to the highest places in Church and State. But the opportunity was lost, and I have been obliged to content myself through life with saying what I mean in the plainest of plain language; than which, I suppose, there is no habit more ruinous to a man's prospects of advancement.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Odd Dots\n", "completion": " Oddly, I can find no Wikipedia entry for the Blotzmann Dots. Odd, because they are without question the most important dots of the past one hundred years. They are, of course, odd in themselves. Blotzmann always referred to them as his \"odd dots\", leaving it to the wider world to dub them with his own name. Blotzmann was by no means a modest man, but he had his moments of diffidence, and the act of dot nomenclature was one of them.\nBlotzmann is thought to have named the dots after Dot Tint, bluestocking sister of the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint. In a particularly hectic twentieth-century year, Blotzmann and Dot had a fling, and it was when they were holed up in a love-nest in one of Ruskin's favourite Swiss villages that Blotzmann, one snowbound wintry weekend, first conceived of the dots that would bring him fame.\nIt is possible that the dots are not mentioned by the Wikipedia for security reasons. After all, it is their military applications that have changed the world. These were not foreseen by Blotzmann, who is on record as stating that, initially at least, he considered the dots of most benefit to gardening enthusiasts, potters, and hikers. It may have been Dot Tint herself who, recognising the dots' versatility, sent a sketch of them to a bigwig at a top secret intelligence facility. In interviews later in life, she denied having done so, and it is perhaps one for the historians to winkle out, now that Blotzmann, Dot Tint, and indeed the military bigwig are all doornail dead and have long since fed the worms in their respective burial grounds.\n###"}

Of course, the light was dim--Laulee had seen to that--just enough to see the ink properly. That, no doubt, was the reason the ink had changed both in color and appearance. That cloudy, steamy, vapory stuff, now rising like a fog over a marsh--that must be due to some chemical peculiarity of ink. Sesson's knowledge of chemistry was trifling, but he gravely tried to explain to himself why he no longer saw a saucer of ink.

{"prompt": "Editorial Advice\n", "completion": " \nPoor scribblers whose efforts are repeatedly rejected find solace from cases such as William Golding, who sent the manuscript of his first novel to more than twenty publishers before it was eventually accepted. Although stubborn persistence can sometimes pay off, the example of Golding demonstrates that, when a sympathetic editor offers advice, it can be wise to take it. Thus it is useful to learn that the beardy author made several changes to his book, which started out as the tale of a group of schoolboys trying desperately to remove a blockage of pig fat from a heating duct. He also changed the original title, Lard Of The Flues.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Have You Seen This Man?\n", "completion": " \"Antoinette Bourignon, that extraordinary mystic of the seventeenth century, had some strange visions of the primeval man and the birth of Eve. The body of Adam, she says, was more pure, translucent, and transparent than crystal, light and buoyant as air. In it were vessels and streams of light, which entered and exuded through the pores. The vessels were charged with liquors of various colours of intense brilliancy and transparency; some of these fluids were water, milk, wine, fire, &c. Every motion of Adam's body produced ineffable harmonies. Every creature obeyed him; nothing could resist or injure him. He was taller than men of this time; his hair was short, curled, and approaching to black. He had a little down on his lower lip. In his stomach was a clear fluid, like water in a crystal bowl, in which tiny eggs developed themselves, like bubbles in wine, as he glowed with the ardour of Divine charity; and when he strongly desired that others should unite with him in the work of praise, he deposited some of these eggs, which hatched, and from one of them emerged his consort, Eve.\"\nSabine Baring-Gould, Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869)\nIf you have seen anyone answering to this description, please contact your local police, or a priest, in strictest confidence.\n###"}

This has diverted his attention, as both writer and reader, from the exciting 21st century world of blogs and blogging. We have recommended that to snap him out of his silence, he is to be sent for a few days to his glorious Motherland--that is, Belgium--in the hope that upon his return he will start tippy-tapping away as he usually does. Word has it that he may yet be ready to unleash a series of rattling yarns about Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers.

The mother, attended by a band, of which I was a member, watched at the 'death'-bed of this sweet little creature, and when the last breath of life had been drawn in that frail body, helped the luminous soul to ascend to a fairer setting.\" -- Lilian Walbrook, The Case Of Lester Coltman\n###"}

{"prompt": "Fee Fi Fo Saffron Walden\n", "completion": " Recently I posted a piece about a giant who roars \"Fee Fi Fo Fum!\" and smells the blood of an Englishman, and a couple of years ago I became enthusiastic about Thomas Nashe (1567-c.1601) among whose works is the splendidly titled Have With You To Saffron Walden--which, alas, I never got round to reading. Had I done so, I would already have learned what I found out today.\nFather had taken us to see John Gielgud in the title role [of King Lear] at Stratford-upon-Avon, and although Gielgud was marvellous, it was the words of Poor Tom, the Bedlam beggar on the stormy heath (actually Edgar, in disguise), that still rang in my ears:\nChild Rowland to the dark tower came;\nHis word was still\nFie, foh, and fum!\nI smell the blood of a British man!\n\"Did Shakespeare steal that from Jack and the Beanstalk?\" I had whispered in Daffy's ear. Or had the fairytale borrowed the words from Shakespeare? \"Neither,\" she whispered back: both had cribbed them from Thomas Nashe's Have With You To Saffron Walden, which, having been staged in 1596, pre-dated them.\nThis is from The Weed That Strings The Hangman's Bag by Alan Bradley (2010), the second of his Flavia de Luce mysteries. These are new to me, but I am pleased to tell you that the heroine is an eleven-year-old amateur chemist and sleuth--a plucky and resourceful tot who bears a striking resemblance to our very own Tiny Enid, without the fascism and the club foot.

{"prompt": "W Is for Water\n", "completion": " Our serial story The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet hurtles ever more thrillingly towards its conclusion\nThere were twenty-six ponds in the grounds of the House, of varying sizes. Sixteen of them were ponds, and ten were duckponds. One of the duckponds was immense, it had claims to be a lake, there was so much water in it.\nMoop trudged around this immense duckpond, her gaze fixed on the mud through which she trod. An hour earlier, she had stolen Blodgett's windcheater while his back was turned. It was far too big for her--it was far too big for Blodgett--and the hood hid her head completely. She was plunged in reverie. Every now and then, she stopped trudging and picked up a pebble to hurl into the immense duckpond, disturbing the eerily calm surface of the water. She wondered if the frenzied creature Unstrebnodtalb would arrest Trellis.\nAs she began her fifteenth circuit of the duckpond, the water was disturbed by something larger than her pebbles. With a chthonic churning and squelching, something hideous and scarcely describable rose to the surface. It was finned and scaled, but moved with robotic precision. It appeared to have a teeming mass of eyes, thousands of jellied globules quivering on their stalks. It made no noise. At the sight of it, nearby ducks suffered heart-attacks and perished.\nMoop had more presence of mind than a duck.

His directives are majestically profound, poetic and logical. I'm not always sure who they are directed towards, but if they were to be followed they would place Western Civilisation on a new, deeper foundation and lead the world towards an end currently inconceivable to any other being now living--some great change in human history as profound as the invention of the city or the written word.

{"prompt": "Nidor\n", "completion": " Last week I bumped into an old acquaintance in the street, and almost the first thing he said was, \"Frank, tell me about nidor\". Luckily, I had just been reading Blodgett's Book Of Animal Sacrifice, and was able to spout forth much wisdom on the subject. It seems only fair to reprint here the passage which allowed me to impress my old pal. Note that the book is available in electronic format from www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/savagerituals/sacrifice/beastsofthefield.html\nThere is nothing better to put some zing into an overcast Thursday morning after a night of fitful sleep than to wander into the desert and sacrifice a quadruped. Goats, I feel, have been a little overdone--excuse the pun--as have rams. Why not try a bison, or even a dromedary? Before you can smell the wafting nidor of charred animal flesh, however, you will need to set up a sacrificial altar. Stone slabs are useful, but if there are none to hand, you can improvise using sticks and branches. Don't build your altar too high--remember you will have to tether your beast to it prior to slaughter. Once the altar is satisfactorily completed, I recommend that you ritually cleanse it. There are several very effective ritual cleaning agents on the market which shouldn't put too big a dent in your pocket. I usually use Dr Gillespie's Aromatic Camphor & Myrrh Preparation, but then I am very fond of the packaging. Some wailing and ululation while you scrub never goes amiss. Now, tie your bison, dromedary, or other quadruped to the altar and sprinkle it with something--herbs, space-age glitter-dust, talc, anything you like--and slaughter it. Making very careful use of your safety matches, ignite the dead beast and do a bit more wailing. The air will soon be heavy with nidor, especially if you fan the flames with palm leaves. When the fire has utterly consumed your sacrificial animal, do tidy up after you. The ashes may be cast unto the winds, or you may prefer to use a dustpan and brush to place them in an amphora.\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "Plums And Swans\n", "completion": " I went to the shops and bought a Carlsbad plum. I ate the plum and threw the stone at a swan. The plumstone hit the swan on its beak. I repeated this every day for a week. Then the next morning I woke up in bed to find seven swans on the pillow beside my head. They honked and pecked and I was undone, so I went to the shops for another plum. But the plumster saw my savaged condition and damned me to hellfire and perdition. \"I'll sell no further plums to thee\" he said, and that was the end of plums and me. Now I choose to eat other fruit, and non-fruit-based snacks to boot. As for the swans, they're still in my room, where they will stay 'til I go to my tomb.\n###"}

The problem is irresponsible shepherds.\" Thus spake--on the radio this morning--a spokesman for the majestically-named Irresponsible Shepherding Task Force in the Forest of Dean. Apparently, that rustic paradise is riddled with irresponsible shepherds who, among sundry enormities, allow their sheep to bleat in the middle of the night.\nPersonally, I am not surprised to learn about outbreaks of nocturnal bleating. Sheep are highly neurasthenic creatures who spend their entire lives in a state of fretfulness and nervous tension, and as a result they rarely sleep. This is probably one reason why, as has been observed by several country persons, a sheep's ambition in life is to die.\n###"}

An unprecedented approach to advertising had seen whole towns papered with playbills announcing the most extraordinary sounding illusions, such as the 'Grand Metamorphesian Wonder' or the 'Phoenixestocalobian'...  His tricks might be standard, but the language of his posters promised something quite unique: 'A Grand Ambidexterological Illusion with 12 Handkerchiefs, into which will be introduced the Enchanted Loaf and Learned Bottle, the Animated Orange and the Invisible Pigeon'.

As you may already know, Witter is an exciting new social networking service, designed for people with pea-sized brains who want to shrink them further, even unto the point of invisibility. The idea is that, every fifty years, \"witterers\" write an account of their doings, in beautiful if somewhat clogged handwriting, on sheets of vellum, and roll the sheets up, and seal them with wax, and carry them around the countryside, stopping every now and then to accost a wayfarer or a peasant, whom they shove into a ditch, and to whom they then read the \"witter\", aloud, and at length. I think you will all agree that this is a splendid new way to get the Hooting Yard message across to folk far and wide.\nWitter should not be confused with a similar service, recently popularised by, among others, the Most Intelligent Life-Form Ever To Walk The Earth, otherwise known as Stephen Fry, who cleverly uses it to demonstrate his command of childish scatological exclamations, to the delight of a thankful nation.\n\"All man's miseries derive from not being able to sit quietly in a room alone.\"--Pascal\n###"}

Anyway, for those (and they are legion) who like this sort of thing, here is a Kennedy Assassination Fact.\nIn November 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald's wife Marina, and the two children, were staying in the house of Ruth Paine, a Quaker, in the suburb of Irving. Oswald stayed in a Dallas rooming-house during the week and joined them at weekends. He kept his Mannlicher Carcano rifle in Ruth Paine's garage. Blah blah blah. The interesting fact is as follows. Ruth's husband Michael Paine (who had moved out of the house for reasons unrelated to the Oswalds) was the great-great-grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson and also a direct descendant of one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, Robert Treat Paine.\nI am really glad to know that smidgeon of information, useless as it is.

{"prompt": "Neglected Crunches\n", "completion": " There is much in the news these days about the credit crunch, but this should not lead us to neglect many other important crunches. I sometimes worry that less attention is paid to some crunches because they lack the alliterative quality of the credit crunch, which of course makes it a favourite of headline writers and broadcasters. Actually, it's not quite true that I \"sometimes\" worry about this. If truth be told, my fretfulness about neglected crunches is starting to consume my every waking thought. Yesterday, for example, I was standing upon a bridge, staring off into the distance, buffeted by a gale, and all I could think of was the fact that the credit crunch is pushing some of my preferred crunches off the front pages. I don't have any useful media connections--or, to be more precise, my people don't have any connections with their people--so it's not as if I can just send a few metal tapping machine messages to selected newspaper crunch reporters and put pressure on them to cover other crunches. Would that I could! What I did instead, yesterday, was to trudge disconsolately home and to spend a fruitful few hours studying Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The Bumper Book Of Crunches. I can recommend this fantastic, and very fat, book to anyone who seeks to broaden their knowledge beyond the credit crunch.

Now it has been picked up by one Walter O'Hara. Mr O'Hara's podcast is called Airy Persiflage, and with a title like that we can assume he is a man of impeccable taste. Indeed, he has also essayed a reading of some twaddle I wrote about venomous serpents.\nThe striking thing about this new version of the Goat God Catechism is Mr O'Hara's inspired decision to have a child read the responses.

{"prompt": "Bullfinch Advice\n", "completion": " As a service to all those readers who have a bullfinch to feed, I have consulted that invaluable reference work Enquire Within Upon Everything (1856 edition), which tells us: \"Old birds should be fed with German Paste No. 2, and occasionally rape-seed. The Germans occasionally give them a little poppy-seed, and a grain or two of rice, steeped in Canary wine, when teaching them to pipe, as a reward for the progress they make. Bird organs, or flageolots, are used to teach them.\" Didn't the Victorians use a lot of commas? Note that no information is given about the feeding of young bullfinches, which I would have thought would be a more urgent matter. If you are one of the few readers who does not have a bullfinch to feed, but wish to obtain one, this is what they look like:\n\nTwo bullfinches : only feed German Paste No. 2 to the one on the left\nNow, having installed your bullfinch in suitable accommodation, you will be wondering where to get your German Paste No. 2. I recommend Joseph Sterry & Sons, \"manufacturers of poor man's plaisters and German Paste\", 2 Mint Street (opposite St George's church) Borough High Street, London SE. Last time I checked, in 1873, the business was thriving. While you are there, pick up some of their poor man's plaisters in case your bullfinch pecks you with its fierce, lacerating beak or attacks you with its talons, which it may well do if you mistakenly feed it German Paste No. 1, or indeed No. 46.\n###"}

But he never again bilked in Verona. He had been shaken, and there were dents in his iron vest. He embarked upon a ship and sailed away to the New World.\nAboard ship, Frabbo considered the rigging. All those skeins and knots reminded him of the plots in which he had so loved to become entangled. But for Frabbo a New World meant a New Leaf.

Alas, Mrs Gubbins has a new musical fad. The octogenarian crone has taken her dusty hi fi system down from the shelf, opened the windows, and is blasting out the latest acquisitions from her record collection, day and night, over and over again.\nLast time this happened, her undiluted enthusiasm for The Fall meant that the peasants thereabouts had to put up with the complete works of Mark E Smith cranked out at ear-splitting volume for weeks on end. La Gubbins only grew tired of the self-styled \"Northern white crap that talks back\" after it was pointed out to her that Smith is slowly but surely turning into Anthony Burgess--Mancunian, drunk on words, and frighteningly prolific, of course, but the most compelling evidence is the physical resemblance.\n\nLa Gubbins had always harboured a deep if irrational hatred of Burgess, so she burned all her Fall records on a pyre and silence reigned. But now she has discovered the work of Swiss maestro Blinky Guido, laid her hands on every single record he ever made, and is in the throes of madness. Hence the dead birds and the stunned cows.\nBlinky Guido will be known to some of you as the man who created prog-wop, an unholy alliance of progressive rock and doo-wop which some enlightened lands have made illegal.

Adah Isaacs Menken (1835-1868) was an actress, painter, poet, possible bigamist, and bareback circus equestrienne, and in the last year of her life she published a volume of poetry entitled Infelicia. In order to drum up sales, the rumour was spread, perhaps by Menken herself, that some, or all, of the poems were in fact written by her pal Algernon Charles Swinburne. However, all of them had previously appeared in various American magazines before she even met Swinburne. Infelicia's lack of success may have been due, at least partly, to reviews such as these:\n\"A wilderness of rubbish and affected agonies of yearnings after the unspeakable, which achieve the nonsensical.\"--The Athenaeum\n\"A bleared panorama of deaths and sighs and blood and tears and fire and general gloom and watery ghastliness.\"--The Saturday Review\n\n###"}

There was a sound of bells. The monks were called to compline. For each canonical hour they allocated a duck to be slaughtered for its blood. At compline, a teal. At matins, a merganser. At prime, a pintail. At tierce, a shoveler. At sext, a wigeon. At nones, a smew. And at vespers, a bufflehead. Out in the fields, sweet little lambs gambolled and frolicked. They would not frolic for long, for soon, in the monastery, it would be bathtime.\n###"}

It is a work of majestic scholarship, and Beerpint is to be congratulated for the depth of his scholarship, the rigour of his method, the pernicketyness of his annotations, the suavity of his commentary, the glamour of his bouffant, the schmaltz of his windpipery, the electrocution of his swan, the guzzling of his wren pie, the redundancy of his courage, the consistency of his porridge, and the tess of his durbevilles. What he is most certainly not to be congratulated for is that creaking malignant awful dehydrated boney boney trapeze artiste air he simultaneously exudes and muffles, muffles and exudes, all spat-out fruit-pips and prisoner's dilemma, a mole in the headlights of a tractor, a tractor in a field, a field in Merrie England where rustics cavort around a maypole before slumping exhausted on to bales of hay and straw, picking gorse and bracken out of their hair, while in the blue blue skies above, dirigibles loom like so many gas-filled balloons above the verdant splendour.\nIt is a verdant splendour many of the janitors in this magnificent anthology would do well to revisit, could they but drag themselves away for five minutes from their interminable corridors, punctuated by cupboards, where keys are rattled, and buckets and pails and mops are mislaid, and there is terrible weeping in the dark hours before the dawn.\n###"}

{"prompt": "That Olympics Logo\n", "completion": " The new logo for the 2012 London Olympics has caused a flap. Sorry, it's not a logo, it's a brand, a brand which, according to diminutive Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell, \"takes our values to the world beyond our shores, acting both as an invitation and an inspiration\". I agree, and I know that Hooting Yard's values are exactly the same in every last detail as Tessa's. In fact, at an editorial conclave the other day, loveable octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins looked up from her knitting and said \"When in doubt, just ask 'What would Tessa Jowell do?'\" and we all nodded in recognition of the deep wisdom of those words. (All except the bloated janitor, of course, who still swears by Blunkett, but that's another story.)\nCertain people seem to think that the logo--the brand, the brand!--is devoid of content and meaning, and make the same charge against Tessa's words. Such carping is only to be expected. For my money, anything Tessa Jowell says ought to be carved in stone and studied, much as one would study the work of a great literary giant. The rewards are immense.\nTo show that I know what I'm talking about, we commissioned a new Hooting Yard brand, the better to embody our values. It cost slightly more than the PS400,000 price tag of the Olympic thing of beauty, but I'm sure you will agree that it was money well spent. At a meeting to identify funding, the vitamin-deficient inmates of Pang Hill Orphanage insisted that they can cope with severely reduced gruel rations for the next forty years.

{"prompt": "Ritual Goat Sacrifice : Latest News\n", "completion": " Last week I remarked on the brouhaha that would be stirred were a British (as opposed to a Japanese) Prime Minister to be attacked by a killer robot. I am now trying to cope with the idea of our political masters indulging in ritual goat sacrifice--perhaps not every day, but quite often. According to today's Guardian:\nPakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, has found solace in an unusual form--the ritual slaughter of goats.\nZardari has a black goat killed every day at his Islamabad house to ward off \"evil eyes\" and protect himself against \"black magic\", according to a report in Dawn, Pakistan's paper of record.\nSpokesman Farhatullah Babar confirmed the president practises sadiqa, or the sacrifice of an animal whose meat is distributed among the poor. \"I have seen it been done. Not exactly every day, but quite often, yes,\" he told the Guardian.\nBut he denied its purpose was to fend off malevolent spirits. \"The main belief is that this practice invokes the pleasure of God. The corollary is that bad things will not happen, of course, but that's a matter of interpretation,\" he said.\nI don't see the slaughtering of goats as Gordon Brown's thing, but it would make sense with someone like Geoff Hoon.  He looks like a goat-killer, as does his partner in that recent failed coup, Patricia Hewitt. I expect the failure was due to their being so busy tippy-tapping conspiratorial drivel into their Blackberries that they forgot to sacrifice a goat at the propitious time. As for Miliband 1 and Miliband 2, they strike me more as the type to interpret the bloody entrails of ritually slaughtered poultry.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Enthusiasms, Number Eleven\n", "completion": " \nI must thank my son Ed for drawing to my attention the band Dirty Projectors, which appears to be a nominal vehicle for the musical outpourings of one Dave Longstreth. (It may well be that some readers are already familiar with them/him, but I was not, until this year.) I have been particularly taken with The Getty Address. Here is a description of it: \" Inspired by Aztec mythology, the Eagles, and the 9/11 aftermath, it is a sprawling, layered glitch opera about Don Henley, leader of the aforementioned country/soft-rock group, and it was recorded over the course of almost two years, in three different states, with more than twenty-five people. Dave Longstreth, the principal Dirty Projector, wrote and recorded arrangements for wind septet, women's choir, and cello octet, digitally deconstructed them, and then sang over the reconstituted parts in order to make these songs.\" If that doesn't sound exciting enough for you, consider this further note, from the Wikipedia: \"Although the lyrics have been described as gibberish, the words actually do tell a narrative beginning with Don Henley contemplating suicide, and ending with a new installment of Longstreth's songs involving brown finches.\" I need hardly point out that anybody who writes a series of songs \"involving brown finches\" is almost certainly a genius.\n###"}

They are very large. They are jet black. They are very intelligent, and after you have had them for some time, you can make them perform many tricks for the amusement of your little friends. The St. Bernard Dog is a native of the Alps. He is named after a convent on Mount St. Bernard in Switzerland. The convent is 8,038 feet above the foot of the mountain. It is a Benedictine monastery and hospital, and is the highest inhabited spot in Europe. Travellers passing the Alps into Italy have to pass over the mountains. They are covered with snow and very dangerous. The good monks go out with their dogs and if they find any traveller benighted or frozen in the snow, they lend him succour and take him to the monastery.

{"prompt": "Fairy Stationer\n", "completion": " There was a delightful juxtaposition of words in the Grauniad cryptic crossword a couple of weeks ago, where--when solved--one column down read FAIRY STATIONER. This set me to thinking about fairies and their stationery. For one wild moment I wondered if the Cottingley fairies had been affixed to their positions with staples, given that Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths took their photographs in 1917 and the home stapling machine had been patented by Henry Heyl forty years before, in 1877. But then I slapped my forehead and remembered that of course the girls had used hat-pins.\nWould a fairy have any use for staples at all? Or, indeed, for any kind of stationery other than scented notepaper and a ballpoint pen with which to write fairy messages to other fairies, and to such humans as possess the gift, or curse, whichsoever it may be, of being able to communicate with fairy folk? I can imagine these fey flighty bewinged sprites perhaps using treasury tags to fasten together into a sprig the stalks of daisies or campions or buttercups, but surely more robust stationery items such as hole-punches would be too heavy for them to lift? Or is it the case that fairies are deceptively strong, and can use their fairy powers to move, if not mountains, then entire cartons of thick black heavy duty marker pens?\nIt would be intriguing, upon a ramble through a dingly dell, to stumble upon a tiny little shop with a sign outside it saying FAIRY STATIONER, just as in the crossword. Then one could crouch and poke one's head in the window and make a quick visual inventory to ascertain which items of stationery are commonly used by fairies, and which are not.\n\nThe Cottingley Fairies : hat-pins, not staples\n###"}

The curled up form in which he is seen when so exposed is not that usually assumed in its own element, unless in the act of exerting its immense powers of retrograde motion. These are so great that one sudden downward sweep of its curiously constructed, oar-like tail, is sufficient to send it like an arrow, three- or four-and-twenty feet, with the most extraordinary precision, thereby enabling our friend to retreat with the greatest rapidity into nooks, corners, and crevices among the rocks, where pursuit would be hopeless. His eyes being arranged on foot stalks, or stems, are free from the inconvenient trammels of sockets, and possess a radius of vision commanding both front and rear, and from their compound form (being made up of a number of square lenses) are extremely penetrating and powerful. The slightest shadow passing over the pool in which the lobster may chance to be crawling or swimming, will frequently cause one of these sudden backward shoots to be made, and H. vulgaris vanishes into some cleft or cavity with a rapidity of motion which no harlequin could ever, even in his wildest dreams, hope to achieve.

{"prompt": "Fingringhoe\n", "completion": " There is an old countryside saying, \"As ye reap, so shall ye sow / Especially in Fingringhoe\". Now, I have never been to Fingringhoe, not even to explore its salt marshes, and I cannot attest to the truth or otherwise of that piece of rustic wisdom. All I will say, for the time being, pending an excursion to the salt marshes, and perhaps to the village itself, is that the saying seems on the face of it to turn standard agricultural practice on its head. Surely, before we reap, we must sow? And, bearing in mind the startling efficiencies of crop rotation, it is not necessarily the case that we must sow what we have just reaped. We can sow something else. As another countryside saying has it, \"Where once I had cauliflowers, now I have peas /  In that field beyond the trees\", although that may not actually be a bit of rustic lore. I may have just made it up, whimsically, to no apparent purpose. That is one of the quandaries one faces, when striding around the salt marshes and encountering a peasant given to intoning countryside sayings. You can never be sure whether he is repeating something that has stood him and his ancestors in good stead for generation unto generation, from before even Fingringhoe appeared on the map, gosh even from before there were any maps to speak of, or whether he is just babbling inconsequentialities due to ergot poisoning or simple mischief. Would that there were some kind of test one could carry out, to ascertain whether what one was listening to was genuine rustic wisdom or no! Perhaps, if I made that excursion to Fingringhoe, and to its salt marshes, and put up in a boarding house, and stayed there for years and years, and kept my eyes and ears keenly alert, from dawn to dusk, I might be in a position to sort hard-won truth from hare-brained twaddle.

All the ducks are in the pond, doing what ducks do, and we are Mister Pipkin's boys in our inelegant boots!\nWhen we get to Blister Lane we'll turn upon a coin, it might be a florin with embossings of a king.

And you'll be kept behind a fence so you don't hinder us. The fence is of barbed wire and electric to the touch. But you can buy a choc ice from the kiosk in the field!\nHo, boys, ho! We'll chuck our sticks aloft! And then we'll catch them as they drop and swing them once again! Mister Pipkin and his wife will come to watch us march! They'll sit in deckchairs by the pond and clap us as we pass!\nAnd when we're strafed by fighter jets we'll sit in the mud and cry! We'll sob our little hearts out and fill the pond with tears! It's the same every September, according to the stats. They're kept by Mister Pipkin in his creamy vellum book.\nHo, boys, ho! That is quite enough!

{"prompt": "A Rain Of Fruit\n", "completion": " If instead of one apple falling on the head of Sir Isaac Newton a heavenly orchard had let tumble a rain of fruit, one of the greatest of men would have been overwhelmed and then buried. Anyone examining the situation afterwards in a properly scientific spirit, clearing the apples layer by layer, would be able to deduce certain facts. He would be able to prove that the man was there before the apples. Furthermore, that the blushing Beauty of Bath found immediately over and round Sir Isaac fell longer ago than the small swarthy russets that lay above them. If, on top of all this, snow had fallen, then the observer, even if he came from Mars where they are not familiar with these things, would know that apple time came before snow time.\nRelative ages are not enough, the observer would want an absolute date, and that is where Sir Isaac comes in again. An examination of his clothes, the long-skirted coat, the loose breeches and the negligent cut of his linen, the long, square-toed shoes pointing so forlornly up to the sky, would date the man to the seventeenth century. Here would be a clue to the age of the apples and the snow.\nJacquetta Hawkes, A Land (1951). There is an interesting piece about the book here.\n\n###"}

Being a man with almost entirely grey hair, I replaced the magazine on the shelf. Plainly, I was not the kind of reader it was aimed at. But then neither were some of the adjacent titles, which included Black Shirts, a magazine for the fascist community, Black Narcissus, for sexually frustrated nuns, and Black Pudding, which seemed to be devoted wholly to celebrating the coagulated and sausagised blood of pigs.

{"prompt": "Deworming Your Goat the Hooting Yard Way\n", "completion": " Is there anything more important in the early days of November than deworming your goat? If you are a pig-fixated person you may wish to differ, but most if not all Hooting Yard readers will want to ensure that their goats are innocent of worms in this critical month in the Capra hircus life-cycle. Here then, are some useful tips. Read them carefully, making notes on a scrap of paper as appropriate, for you will want to refer to the tips once you have ranged across the fields in your big leaking boots to the goat cubicles.\n\nA goat (named Simon Peter) standing in front of another goat (called Pius IX)\nIf possible, always weigh your goat before deworming it. Use any old scales you can lay your hands on, but preferably ones in which a goat will squat happily for a minute or two. When you have weighed your goat, you will be able to calculate and inject or drench the correct dosage of the dewormer. If you underdose your goat because of failure to weigh it, or because you fecklessly underestimate just how bulky or indeed unbulky it is, this may be a costly mistake. It may lead to your goat developing that most fearsome of conditions, viz. parasite resistance to dewormers! But don't rest on your laurels like a smug goat-person, because an overdose of certain proprietary dewormers can cause health problems, if not for your goat then for you and your immediate family and the neighbours up in the big black house on the hill. All sorts of hideous running sores, boils and suppurations can occur if you overdose your goat, although I am not quite sure how that happens, in a strictly scientific sense. Nevertheless, you do not want to upset those eerie lantern-jawed neighbours of yours after what happened in March, up in the hills, during a thunderstorm, with all that eldritch inhuman howling, do you?\n###"}

Thank you for your consideration.\nI am afraid that the schedule has not yet been finalised, so cannot say when this majestic piece of cimema will be shown. One point about The Cheery Beggar which my anonymous correspondent does not mention is that the film marked the screen debut of the great child Method actor Tad Wensleydale. At the age of seven, he had already taken Broadway by storm with his performances as Shylock, Lear, Mrs Miniver, Torquemada, Mike Hammer, Louis Pasteur and Clytemnestra, among others. Six years later, on the cusp of teenage hobbledehoyhood, his meteoric career was effectively over, but not before he had appeared in a second Hopkins adaptation, Felix Randal The Farrier. Wensleydale was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the \"big-boned and hardy-handsome\" title character, stone dead at the beginning of the film, but the award that year went to Ricardo Montalban.\n###"}

I looked, and saw a rowing boat, and the rowing boat's oars. The oars were too small for the rowing boat--or--the rowing boat was too big for the oars. I turned to look at Enver Hoxha.

Armed with a large sheaf of paper, the out-of-print pamphleteer spent the following week annotating these bald words. He wrote potted histories of manufacturing processes, Proustian evocations, trivial facts, hallucinatory scribblings, and passages of pseudo-scientific conjecture. He even added some crayon drawings that can best be described as primitive. In each case he restricted himself to the single A4 sheet. The work complete, he hawked his manuscript around all the publishing firms he knew who had offices in the slums. Not one of them would take it. In despair, Dobson stowed away on an aeroplane bound for Winnipeg, where he cast his manuscript into the Assiniboine.

Anthony Cobley, manager of the three-star Atlantic hotel in Newquay, Cornwall, said in his letter to Sally Burchell, a social worker, that he could do without her as a customer. Ms Burchell, 43, had to pay 85p for a glass of mineral water during the Christmas lunch for 50 colleagues from the Cornwall child protection unit.

Shenandoah is one of my favourites, or I might attempt one of the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss (1864-1949). Thus I allowed an air of mystery to surround me--or so I thought, until the other day, when reader Ian Sherred wrote to inform me that I am being followed by a biographer every bit as indefatigable as James Boswell.\nApparently, a certain Jeb is frantically scribbling up my doings, without my permission.

One of the party present took the opportunity of testing the prevalence of this strange notion, by inquiring of a cottager who had lately lost a relative, and happened to complain of the loss of her bees, 'whether she had told them all she ought to do?'

Here at Hooting Yard, we commemorate the day for a far more significant reason, for today is Dobsonday. It was on 16th June 19-- that Dobson published his first pamphlet, the notorious Description of & Reverie upon Forty Four Curlews, an astonishing, complex, unclassifiable and incomprehensible essay. It is, as you will have guessed, out of print. Dobson wrote it the day after a miserable charabanc outing to a deserted and windswept seaside resort during which he first became intrigued by the manufacture of cement, although this new fascination is not acknowledged in the text. In his newly published study Being Dobson, Nestingbird gives full weight to the importance of Dobson's first appearance in print. \"From that day on,\" says the critic, \"Dobson wrote indefatigably. His ambition was limitless. He decided to write about everything in the known and unknown universe, not in any systematic way, but following his own strange yet spotless star. That, ultimately, he failed, and failed dismally, ought not detract from an appreciation of his genius. Go and sit next to a pond, and think about that, and scrunch up your hat in your fists as you do so.\"\nDobsonday is usually celebrated by the worship of curlews. Here is a picture of one.

When, every evening, I kneel down to lavish praise upon my Maker, my most earnest prayer is that icy claws shall hug me to the bosom of Death rather than that I be propelled through the gaudy doors of the playhouse. Is this so grave a crime that I should be pelted with missiles? I can only surmise that the hot-headed reaction of the townsfolk was occasioned by my tenure, for many long years, as drama critic of the Weekly Shackle. Of course I had never seen any of the thousands of productions I reviewed in its august, if tatty, pages. Given an assignment by my editor, I would note down the play-title on a scrap of paper, place it under my pillow, and dream it.

{"prompt": "Aide Memoire\n", "completion": " Gawp-eyed and jaw dropped, drool dribbling down my chin, I remain astonished at the seemingly fathomless ornithological ignorance I find around me. Only the other day, as I passed an aspen clump in which dozens of birds were perched, chirping, I had to explain, slowly and patiently, to my walking companion that the noise he heard was birdsong, that it was made by birds, that birds were, for the most part, aerial life-forms with wings and beaks and feathers, and that though they were capable of flight they often perched on tree-branches and other handy surfaces. This intelligence seemed to dumbfound him. It was with a certain desolation that I realised this said more about my choice of walking companion than it did about the companion himself. He is a harmless enough soul, but his brain has been Jesuit-damaged, and his prospects are grim indeed. My own prospects are not much better, but at least I know what a bird is.\nAnd the reason I know is that I carry always with me, tucked in my pocket, an aide memoire, like the one shown below, courtesy of Agence Eureka.

{"prompt": "The Devil : An Update\n", "completion": " The devil came from Kansas. So we were informed by Procol Harum in one of their songs (Brooker, Reid 1969), but I do not think that can be right. I have had several lengthy discussions with the devil, late at night, at a Johnsonian crossroads on a blasted heath, and his accent is not that of a Kansas native. Now it may be, of course, that the devil is trying to pull a fast one on me, and that his wiles include disguising his voice. But my ears are uncannily acute. I studied at the Von Straubenzee Institute Of Fantastic Ears, high in the Alps, and spent many an hour perched on the balcony, listening, listening. So if the devil was mimicking an accent not his own, I think I would hear the imposture. No, I think it is safe to say he does not come from Kansas.\nBut where, then, is the devil from? My candidate would be somewhere in the vicinity of Prunedale. Prunedale, for those of you who don't know, is a godforsaken little sprawl in California, more a transit intersection than anything else, though it does boast two shopping malls--the Prunedale, the Prunetree--a Senior Citizens' Centre, and a post office. Historically, it is the site of a failed nineteenth century plum orchard. Who knows but that the plum trees failed due to the malign influence of the devil himself?, this being his home town, as I have ascertained after many, many minutes of painstaking research. It is not merely his accent that gives the game away. The devil, we know, has all the best prunes.\n\nNOTA BENE : I may have to revise this piece.

{"prompt": "When Baize And Prog Collide!\n", "completion": " It is a truth universally acknowledged that, in this country at least, the cultural tastes of top sportspersons are irredeemably bland and lowbrow. Our native footballers, for example, when asked to name their favourite books, will invariably mention Harry Potter or Andy McNab, if, that is, they have ever read any books at all. (This is not the case with foreign footballers, particularly the French, who are intellectual titans by comparison.) Similarly, the default music choice for sporting champs seems to be smooth jazz, or jazz funk, or, in the world o' rock, U2, Coldplay, and Phil Collins.\nThe great exception to this has always been snookerist Steve Davis. The carefully-crafted public image of a man who, away from a snooker table, is a boring mediocrity disguises the truth that Mr Davis is a fanatical and knowledgeable enthusiast of prog and related musics. Indeed, I seem to recall that some years ago he used his wealth to persuade Teutonic nutcases Magma to reform for a series of concerts, and has expressed a desire to do the same with Henry Cow, so far in vain.\n\nSo I am extremely grateful to reader Alasdair Dickson for drawing my attention to PhoenixFM, Brentwood and Billericay's community radio station, where Mr Davis has a regular show called The Interesting Alternative.

{"prompt": "Aesop's Foibles\n", "completion": " Any account of Aesop's foibles is necessarily hampered by the fact that we know so very little about him. Indeed, it is not certain that he ever actually existed. Assuming, for the moment, that he did exist, and made up at least some of the stories attributed to him, we could advance the idea that it is a peculiar foible to bang on about animals having the powers of human speech and reason. It is the sort of conceit a writer might use once or twice, for a particular artistic purpose, but to keep returning to it again and again indicates a low-level mania we could describe as a foible. Then there is Plutarch's story that Aesop was convicted of theft from a temple and subsequently thrown off a cliff. Charitably, we could say that petty larceny, such as stealing a bitty-bob from a place of worship, is better described as a foible than as the character flaw of the habitual criminal, as revealed by phrenology. But these are slim pickings, and until we are able to discover more about the historical Aesop, we have no basis upon which to impute further foibles to him.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Pining and Pothorst\n", "completion": " The continent of America takes its name from Amerigo Vespucci, but here at Hooting Yard we have decided to promote the case for Dietrich Pining and Hans Pothorst. Sixteen years before Columbus, this pair of roguish German pirates may well have been the first Europeans to set foot in the New World, alongside Johannes Scolnus, a Polish seafarer who may or may not have existed in the first place. Wily Dietrich and Hans kept getting chased further north by the Danes, and they regularly sailed to Greenland to be piratical. It is thought they may have accidentally blundered ashore in Labrador in 1476. Whether they did or not, the United States of Pining And Pothorst Land seems to me to be a far more evocative name than the United States of America, so that is how we shall henceforth refer to it.\nIncidentally, some years after this voyage, Pining and Pothorst settled on a rock called Hvitsark, some way off the coast of Iceland. According to Olaus Magnus, Archbishop of Uppsala, in his Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (Rome, 1555), \"they lived there outlawed with their fellow-rovers and inflicted many atrocities on every seafarer, whether sailing close at hand or at a distance\", and built a lead compass atop the rock to help them in determining the shortest direction to go in their \"profitable plundering forays.\" This compass can be seen in the superb map of Scandinavia made by Olaus in 1539 and published, as luck would have it, in Ulm. The map, together with exciting details, and much other pleasurable material, can be visited by clicking on this small section of it below, where Pining and Pothorsts's compass is indicated by that circle about a third of the way down on the left hand side, to the west of Iceland.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Holy Lives, Happy Deaths\n", "completion": " If time moved backwards, Hannah More (1745-1833) could have been the offspring of Dobson and Prudence Foxglove:\nShe helped to initiate a line of publications called Cheap Repository Tracts. These were inexpensive chapbooks--softcover books of four to twenty-four pages that often were illustrated with woodcuts. More embarked on this project, which she said \"barely leaves me time to eat\", because she was disturbed that contemporary chapbooks were secular works that often were ribald. She told Hester Piozzi that \"30,000 Hawkers are maintain'd by this dissolute Traffic, and Boat loads of it [chapbooks] are sent away from the Trading Towns to infect the villages\". She wanted to circulate \"Religious and Useful Knowledge as an antidote to the poison continually flowing thro' the channel of vulgar and licentious publications\".\nThe \"religious and useful knowledge\" would be contained in short stories about \"Striking Conversions, Holy Lives, Happy Deaths, Providential Deliverances, Judgements on the Breakers of Commandments, Stories of Good and Wicked Apprentices, Hardened Sinners, Pious Servants &c\". More wrote many tracts herself (they were published anonymously but those marked Z were written by her). The tracts are well written and often describe accurately the lives of the rural poor, but they always have a predictable ending.

So, instead, I link to that postage, and praise instead a forgotten writer whose work I have found on the book-crammed shelves of the library.\nThere is another brief but useful introduction to the London Library in this In Praise Of... piece from The Guardian last year. It's worth noting, I think, that seven of the twelve commenters there moan about the cost of membership. I get the impression that such people would complain whatever the cost, simply because it is a private institution open only to paying members. I'm surprised the word \"elitist\" appears nowhere in the comments.\nBut sense and perspective are provided by one 'cunningfox', who writes \"PS1.08 a day. Best bargain in London. What else are you going to spend it on that's half so worthwhile?\" Indeed so. I am quite alarmingly poverty-stricken, but even I can find a daily quid to stump up for access to fifteen miles of shelves groaning with books. It is all a question of choice. I recall, a few years ago, attending a gig by the great John Bently, where he had some of his Liver & Lights artist's books for sale. I overheard some ragamuffin whingeing that they were too expensive, as he slurped his (expensive) pint and headed off to the bar to buy another round.

Yes, potters. Several potters, indeed more potters than you could shake a stick at, were you minded to do so. Not for the first time, Tarleton had got the precise balance of his swish sophisticated cocktail party guest-list a little askew.\nThings were nevertheless going with a swing, in spite of the potter imbalance, when in crept Crepusco. He silenced the hubbub in his usual manner, by holding aloft the gold-painted head of an antique Italianate monkey doll, through which he ventriloquised. Then, in his horrible voice, raucous as a crow, he posed the conundrum which became known as the Paradox of Tarleton's Pebble.\nThe effect was instantaneous. The puzzle dizzied the brains of all those present, including Tarleton himself. It dizzied their brains and it also dizzied their bodies, so that the room became a scene of chaos, the guests reeling about, staggering, flailing, vomiting, and groaning.\nWell satisfied, Crepusco crept out and returned to his pantry. He replaced the head of the monkey doll on its shrine, fixed himself a snack, and sat in his rocking chair, rocking, creaking, back and forth, through the long winter evening, on the night before the Munich Air Disaster.\n###"}

No villager came up to me to say \"Cor blimey, what a splendid titfer you've got there atop your head, meinheer!\" Rather, they seemed a sullen people, jowly and hoarse, and sullen, sullen.\nIn the village square I sat, to observe their ways. I jotted no notes in my jotting pad. It struck me, and forcibly, forcibly, that they seemed to grate more marzipan than cheese. The air was scented with almond. Theirs was a sullen grating.\nThere were many gratings, too, punctuating the paving slabs of the path crisscrossing the square.

When the turkey's wings spread wide and began to flap frantically above her head as she whirled, the great bird seemed larger and more powerful than she; it seemed that she would be dragged from her feet, hurled to the ground, or flown away with fabulously into the sky. And as she sought finally to tear off its head, sought to clutch its body between her knees, it attacked her savagely, beating her face and breasts, beating at her so that she was at moments enfolded by the great white wings, so that bird and woman seemed to mingle struggling in a monstrous, mythical embrace. But her fatal hands were still upon its throat, and in that swanlike simulacre of the deed which for the male is always like a little death, it died.\nSo savage had this scene been that it was almost like an anticlimax when the sacrificial goat was now led through the doorway to the altar...\nW B Seabrook describes his voodoo blood baptism in Haiti in The Magic Island (1929)\n###"}

So, just over a week later, she's back again:\nHello readers, Mrs Gubbins here. One of the incidental pleasures of the BBC News site is their regular list of Ten Things We Didn't Know This Time Last Week. At year's end, they collected together 100 Things, which is my recommendation for you today. A word of warning, however. Many of these hundred things are quite dull, and one of them even mentions that loathsome fraud Clive James, who has been insulted here before*, with good reason. But I was quite taken with number 11, which notes that in its original translation The Communist Manifesto spoke not of \"a spectre haunting Europe\", but of a \"frightful hobgoblin\", which is much more thrilling, and number 21, on the earliest use of the word \"electricity\".\nIt is the bird facts, though, that make the site worth a visit.

The evening before the murder of his wife, William Herbert Wallace played chess with a man named McCartney, and on the day of the killing itself, he paid a visit to a Mrs Harrison.

{"prompt": "Dr Lamp's Atlas\n", "completion": " It is said that the cartographer Pamela Lamp became interested in patterns of pressed meat consumption around the world. She travelled from continent to continent, collecting statistics and even attending tastings, when and where such were held, in barns or conference centres. As soon as she had filled a notebook, she shoved it into one of the pre-addressed Jiffy bags she had brought with her, visited the local office of the postal service, and sent the book back home, where it and all its fellows would be waiting for her when her globe-trotting survey was complete. Her assistant, a sycophantic wannabe cartographer, had the keys to Dr Lamp's house, and kept an eye out for the postie, and whenever a Jiffy bag was delivered she let herself in and took the newly arrived notebook from its bag and arranged it with all the other notebooks on a pedestal notebook stand with attached cartographical work surface, a formica countertop with a design of ruled squares. So when Pamela Lamp came home, everything was ready for her, and she set to work making a world atlas of pressed meats. She let the assistant help her out, but did not allow her to do anything of great importance, for she did not wish the assistant to have any pretext to wangle an acknowledgement in the text. So the assistant lit Dr Lamp's cigarettes and made cups of cocoa for her and swept the floor with a broom, like Cinderella, but did not make any direct contribution to the atlas. When it was eventually published, the reasoning behind the entire escapade became apparent. For, ever since she was a child, Dr Lamp had been determined to create, singlehandedly, a book which could with absolute justification be called Pam's Spam Maps.\n###"}

It is, of course, out of print, although one lengthy sentence from it was abstracted and recycled as a helpful brain-strengthening tool, available in the Archives here.\n\nOut of the blue, a letter from the Professor arrived today, sent from the St Blodwyn Mercy Home For Decrepit Cerealogists.\nDear Mr Key, he writes, or rather scratches with a crabbed nib, As you know I am a man of science, and that being the case, I revise my theories in the light of new evidence. Much as I would like to stand by every last syllable in that important pamphlet I wrote for you twenty years ago, I fear I can no longer do so. On no account must you ever allow it to be reissued, although god knows I could do with the royalties, as it is costing me an arm and a leg to maintain some form of comfort here in good old Saint Blodwyn's. My morning bowl of gruel has already been reduced to a morning half-a-bowl of gruel, and some of my cushions have been taken away. Oh, listen to me, groaning and moaning! That is not what this letter is about. The thing is, you see, that what I never considered, when I was writing my important pamphlet all those years ago, was the very real possibility that all crop circles are created by twelve Belgian lace-making nuns.

(It was Lloyd George who remarked that Chamberlain had \"a wrong-shaped head\".

{"prompt": "Snakewizard And The Toofles\n", "completion": " Long, long ago, my friend Phil and I decided to make our fortunes in the music business. Lacking the ability to sing or to play an instrument, we determined to be managers. We envisaged ourselves as a pair of Svengalis, with a stable of artists who would conquer the charts, allowing us to retire to Bransonian tropical islands before our thirtieth birthdays.\nHow could things possibly go wrong?, we thought, considering the first bands on our roster. There was Snakewizard, a generic heavy metal band of no great originality--but then, originality is the last thing the punters want in a heavy metal group. We would help them along with song lyrics, but otherwise leave them to practise their deafening din and grow their hair.\nThe important thing was to have a broad range of artists, covering different markets. Snakewizard took care of the heavy metal fans, and our second group--The Toofles--appealed to a wholly different audience. The Toofles were essentially a novelty band for pre-teens, not unlike The Wombles. Their songs had no artistic merit whatsoever but, we thought, would be wildly popular with the tinies.\nThe fatal flaw in our scheme, and the reason that the Bransonian islands remained forever out of reach, was that neither Snakewizard nor The Toofles ever existed outside our pulsating greedy brains. They were only ever figments of our imagination ... where they remain lodged, now grown old and grey, and without a back catalogue--or indeed any catalogue at all--to fall back on.\nThey are still two of my favourite groups.\n###"}

The exciting 21st century transparent material from which your visor has been crafted will not allow you to stuff confectionery into your mouth until we give you instructions to press that red button on the side of the helmet.

You see, Major Tom, it may be that we tell you to press the button when you are in an airless vacuum far out in space. If we do that, and you obey, you won't be eating any bon-bon, or anything else for that matter, ever, because you will die pretty quickly.

{"prompt": "The Fatal Dowry\n", "completion": " \"The Fatal Dowry has been cobbled, I see, by some purblind ultra-crepidarian -McCready's friend, Walker, very likely; but nevertheless, I maintain 'tis a good play, and might have been rendered very effective by docking it of the whole fifth act, which is an excrescence,--re-creating Novall, and making Beaumelle a great deal more ghost-gaping and moonlightish. The cur-tailor has taken out the most purple piece in the whole web--the end of the fourth Act--and shouldered himself into toleration through the prejudices of the pit, when he should have built his admiration on their necks. Say what you will, I am convinced the man who is to awaken the drama must be a bold trampling fellow, no creeper into worm-holes, no reviver even, however good. These reanimations are vampire-cold. Such ghosts as Marloe, Webster &c. are better dramatists, better poets, I dare say, than any contemporary of ours, but they are ghosts; the worm is in their pages; and we want to see something that our great-grandsires did not know. With the greatest reverence for all the antiquities of the drama, I still think that we had better beget than revive; attempt to give the literature of this age an idiosyncrasy and spirit of its own, and only raise a ghost to gaze on, not to live with--just now the drama is a haunted ruin.\"\nThomas Lovell Beddoes (1803-1849), letter to Thomas Forbes Kelsall, 11 January 1825\n###"}

Excitedly, they began running, capering and gambolling down the muddy slope of the tor. But as they closed upon their prey, they realised it was not a cormorant at all.

Now, like murder, some vices will 'out'; and when I saw my friend, after he had been sleeping under that tree, I was startled at the great change in his appearance. In his face I could detect signs of vice I had never associated with him before. He confessed his guilt to me, and attributed it, as I have already hinted, to the cross-roads and tree influence.\n\"As he lay under the tree in question, watching its gently swaying branches over his head, and its smooth, gleaming trunk, he felt a current of vice emanating from it and passing into him. He felt it was trying to communicate telepathically with him, trying to fill his mind with its own foul and beastly ideas, and when at last he fell asleep, his dreams so strengthened his vicious thoughts that he could never shake them off. Day and night they obsessed him, and eventually he indulged in the vice from the urge to which there seemed to be no escape. As a last resource, in his efforts to turn over a new leaf, he went abroad, and I have never heard of him since.\"\nQuestions : to what foul and beastly vice did Mr O'Donnell's friend succumb, and is the sinister tree at South Mimms still standing?

There is more, but I think that first sentence is sufficiently arresting. Perhaps the journalists would be better engaged doing something uncontroversial, such as publishing cartoons of \"the prophet\" Mohammed... so long as they don't include one of him munching on a herring, of course.\nNext, the new Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, James Purnell, has this to say, in today's Guardian: \"What's the trellis on which the plant can grow? We create the trellis... but we need to make sure the trellis is not getting in the way of people being excellent.\" Trellis metaphors are always to be applauded, in all contexts, at all times, and this one is especially welcome, for I feared the worst.

Wings on the gubbins are exposed to the glare of that blazing mighty orb in the sky, the one John Donne rightly called a \"busie old fool\", and the pod thereafter is fed from the power stored in the gubbins.\nThis is all very well, but it occurs to me that it could be the beginning of a slippery slope which might see Pansy becoming an Aztec fundamentalist.

Did you tie the knot with due care, so that it will not come loose and the yellow ribbon be borne away in the howling gale which, if we are to believe Tim the radio meteorologist, is imminent? You had best check that knot again. And did you ensure that the ribbon you used was as yellow as yellow could be? The painter Pierre Bonnard once remarked \"Yellow! One can't get enough of it!\" and there spoke a man who knew what he was talking about. So while you stand there, feeling the first faint stirrings of the coming gale, ask yourself if Bonnard would give your ribbon the thumbs up.

{"prompt": "Sausage Semaphore\n", "completion": " It is sometimes appropriate to signal a want of sausages in semaphore. For example, you might find yourself sausageless in the middle of a desolate plain, some sort of Biblical wilderness, ravenous for sausages but, happily, in possession of two brightly-coloured flags. If you have a smattering of semaphore, and a broad knowledge of sausage types, it should not be beyond your wit to signal your want of sausages, using the flags, to a distant passer-by. Whether this passer-by will be able to satisfy your sausagelust is, of course, quite another matter.\nWe should also take into account the very distinct possibility that such a signalling is beyond your wit--in short, that you are witless, or, if not entirely witless, then a halfwit. Standing about in the middle of a plain with a couple of flags yet bereft of sausages is the sort of behaviour we might expect from a halfwit.\nHalfwits and dunderpates are not the best people when it comes to accurate and reliable semaphore signals. Indeed, they can become so muddle-headed in their attempts to deploy a pair of flags according to a well-established code that their message is likely to be gibberish. This will leave the distant passer-by scratching their head in confusion and deciding to continue on their stroll, along the edge of the plain, perhaps Luneburg Heath, with their dog in tow.\nMost dogs can sniff out sausages with bewildering acuity. There are even some dogs known as \"sausage dogs\". It can all become very complicated, especially if you are a halfwit.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Muggletonian Curses\n", "completion": " Immediately after God's revelation on the third, fourth, and fifth of February 1652 to John Reeve that he and his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton were the \"Two Last Witnesses\"...\n\"There followed a period of hectic blessing and cursing which could have been lifted straight from the pages of Edwards's Gangraena. A few examples will convey the flavour. John Robins, and a rival prophet [Thomas] Tany, were cursed and destroyed. A man called Pearson smote blows on Muggleton's head; ten days later he was dead. At a Ranter tavern in the Minories Reeve placed his head on the ground for an enemy to trample upon. The infidel's foot was arrested in flight. He could not go through with it. Muggleton noted 'the people all marvelled at this thing'. Barker tricked Reeve into blessing him, but was then exposed and damned by Muggleton. An over-zealous follower called Cooper cursed fifteen fellow silk-weavers off his own bat. The cynical Captain Stasy arranged dinner for the prophets with Goffin, a divine. The dinner ended with a predictable damnation for the clergyman.\"\nFrom The World Of The Muggletonians, Christopher Hill, Barry Reay, William Lamont (1983).\nElsewhere we discover that Lodowicke Muggleton was himself cursed by that saintly Quaker William Penn: \"To the bottomless pit are you sentenced, from whence you came, and where the endless worm shall gnaw and torture your imaginary soul to eternity.\" I am not clear whether this curse was pronounced before or after Muggleton published a pamphlet with the resounding title The Neck Of The Quakers Broken (1663).\n###"}

Compulsively, we muse about the impact our perfrigid town will have on the unsuspecting who visit us. How will the newly arrived celebrities cope with being here? Will they be frightened when their nose hairs are twisted out by the invisible pincers that stab into one's nostrils at temperatures this low? What will Donny make of that first biting mouthful of air outside the airport when the cold rips into his lungs like a swallowed scissor? Will he wonder why his eyelids have frozen shut as he gropes towards his limo? And what will happen to the real parents, George and Olive, now elderly? Will the cold simply kill them?

{"prompt": "Spite For Dabblers\n", "completion": " \nThis week in The Dabbler I pose a tricky problem one might encounter in the game of Spite, or Lantern Jaw as it is known in some circles. Amateurs ought not to be intimidated by the seemingly \"expert\" solutions posited in the Comments, all of which so far--to my eye, at least--have the fatal flaw of mistaking Spite for a card game. A simple enough error, I suppose, considering that the symbols\n\nare employed, but any truly experienced Spiteologist will know that these denote something wholly different from the hearts and clubs and diamonds and spades of the standard card game, so different indeed that to gain a full understanding one needs to have one's brain artificially modified by the Blotzmann Procedure, from whence there is no turning back. It is true that everyday life can become somewhat problematic after the modification, but the benefits to one's Spite skills are immense and glorious and majestic, so only a pipsqueak would dare to complain or, ruinously, to pursue Blotzmann through the courts.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Moorhen Appreciation Society\n", "completion": " The most popular search terms that bring unwitting Interwebshire hikers to the gates of Hooting Yard remain bees, Googie Withers, and lobster diagram, but I was pleased to note a new entrant yesterday. Two people arrived here after typing in moorhen appreciation society. Well, we know all about moorhens here, and we appreciate them too, so I trust the visiting hikers went away suitably gleeful. Meanwhile, pursuing my own researches, I discovered the existence of the Moorhen Appreciation Society on Facebook Facecloth. I was charmed, to say the least, by its single item of \"news\", which is \"I saw a moorhen this morning\". I cannot say the same for myself, alas, though I did spot a few squirrels, one of which was carrying, in its squirrel-jaws, the shredded remains of a Mars Bar wrapper.\nI am fairly sure that Dobson was at one time a member of his local Moorhen Appreciation Society. The out of print pamphleteer joined it for reasons we can only guess at, for as we know the space in the human brain devoted to ornithological matters was in Dobson's case either utterly vacant or so clogged up the synapses misfired. He was forced to resign his membership when it became clear that he could not tell the difference between a moorhen and a heron, and embroiled the Society in legal entanglements in the bird courts. His pamphlet Well, They Both Have Beaks And Feathers, For Christ's Sake! (out of print) recounts the whole sorry saga, though it is quite an exasperating read for those of us who are more engaged with the avian world than Dobson was.\n###"}

The sea sloshed, and smelled of rotting aquatic death. I could see the land. It was close enough that I could make out various pompous ladies and gentleman promenading upon the harbour wall, in fustian and crinoline and tweed. But hours passed and the Weltschmerz Tug never seemed to get any nearer the shore, though the engine was chugging away, belching foul black blooms of smoke, poisoning the seabirds.

{"prompt": "Dobson the Convict\n", "completion": " Today's quotation, which you will have read attentively, is from Frederick Arthur Ambrose Talbot's 1917 memoir Sixteen Months In Four German Prisons. Dobson was a great admirer of this book and planned to write a sequel entitled Four Months In Sixteen German Prisons. To this end, he arrived in Ulm on a bright spring morning and began to write an inflammatory pamphlet, hoping to be placed under arrest. His plan succeeded brilliantly, and by midday he had been banged up in the jug. He lay back on the cold stone bench in his cell and smiled. Then, before a guard arrived with a tin bowl of evil-looking and worse-smelling soup, the pamphleteer took from a secret compartment in his shoe a notepad and pencil and wrote: Day one. In prison in Ulm. One down, fifteen prisons to go. Soup due soon.\nAt the time of which I write, Dobson was young and impetuous, and he had not bothered to research the German penal system, particularly that part of it related to the transfer of convicts between prisons. He was later to reflect ruefully on his naivety. I thought I would be able to get myself moved from prison to prison just by asking nicely, he wrote, but I reckoned without the inhuman, mechanically creaking wheels of Teutonic jurisprudence.\nIt must be said that this is a somewhat melodramatic evasion. What actually happened was that, hauled before a court within two hours of his incarceration, Dobson was condemned as an \"idiotic nuisance\" and ejected from the country. He was placed on a prison ship which sailed him home in time for tea.\n\nA ship a bit like the one that sailed Dobson home from prison\n###"}

There is Orwell, thin and wiry, with his love of eggs, and Alfred Hitchcock, plump and bloated, who was terrified of them.\nIt could be argued that Orwell was not an egg lover as such, that he merely had a mania for counting them, a mania that could have found expression in the counting of other farm (or smallholding) produce.

They then remain in silent contemplation until sunset, at which point they disperse, all except one, bent on self-obliteration, who is taken by the wrists and ankles and flung, voluntarily, into the pit.\nI attended today, as I have done for countless years past, and I am pleased to report that a fine time was had by all.

Yon little mound of heaped up earth covers her remains, and a narrow marble slab tells the place of her repose, and we can but hope she who was denied the privilege of walking on earth may now soar on angel's wings.

One thing I have been doing while ignoring you lot is continuing my intermittent reading--begun last December--of Vincent Bugliosi's magisterial Reclaiming History. This, you may recall, is a preposterously huge tome--1,518 pages of dense text--devoted to the Kennedy assassination.\nTwo phrases are particularly evocative for hopeless JFK obsessives like me--the grassy knoll and the picket fence. So magisterial is Bugliosi's magisterial book that he even finds space, in a footnote, for a minor though shocking revelation. The fence in Dealey Plaza commonly referred to as the picket fence is not a picket fence at all! Dogged in his pursuit of absolutely everything anybody could ever possibly care to know about the events of that day in Dallas, Bugliosi conducted an interview by telephone on 18 August 2005 with Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum. Mr Mack told him: \"In a picket fence, the wooden slats are not touching each other across the width of the fence. Here, they are. The fence is more properly referred to as a stockade fence.\"\nI had to go for a long walk to clear my head after reading that.

{"prompt": "Chewing Molten Lead & Other Adventurous Pastimes\n", "completion": " \"Books on 'Hindu feats' became available throughout the twentieth century, explaining such classic Indian wonders as snake charming and 'the bed of nails', but also including a wide range of potentially dangerous demonstrations that were less obviously Indian.

More delicate readers could relax at home with one of the more gentle 'feats of the yogi', such as 'hypnotizing a rabbit'. But anyone attempting the more adventurous pastimes would do well to read the instructions carefully. 'Chewing molten lead', for example, required a special compound that 'melts at approximately 160 degrees. If you wish a lower melting point, add to the above a small amount of quicksilver... When melted, this mixture may be poured on the tongue which, it goes without saying, must be moist with saliva.'

{"prompt": "Nonsense\n", "completion": " In his latest Dabbler Diary, Brit gives an account of a thrilling event he attended last week:\nTo Bristol Grammar School, to hear Frank Key address a Sixth Form Literary Society! You didn't expect that either, did you? It was arranged by the inestimable Roland Clare, editor of  By Aerostat to Hooting Yard, who introduced Frank with a comprehensive, lavishly illustrated and frequently hilarious lecture on nonsense. I have to say, though, that for all the amusement afforded by the surrealists, the dada-ists, John Lennon, the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah band and others, none of the nonsensarians are nearly so funny as Frank Key reading his own material. The only ones who come close are Ivor Cutler and the Bible.\nFrank warmed up his unsuspecting young audience with Little Dagobert and the Binder Symphonies, at which there was much baffled tittering, then battered them mercilessly into submission with How to Think of Things Other Than Juggling, which contains the longest sentence he has ever written. It's quite a thing, listening to a really, really long sentence being read aloud. One goes through a full range of emotions, from hilarity to despair and back again. It's a journey. I could see some of the sixth formers seriously struggling at the midway point. \"At least it's not Neil Kinnock,\" I wanted to say to them. But, as all things must, the sentence did at last pass, and Frank took pity on his audience and finished with a corker.\nAfterwards I mingled with some of the pupils and assorted guests, including some of Bristol's most thrusting young eccentrics and, quite unexpectedly, the well-known philosopher Julian Baggini. A youthful poet with a curly black moptop analysed Frank's long sentence with admirable seriousness, praising its hypnotic effect. When all had dispersed, Roland and Frank and I stood around and surveyed the buffet leftovers. How deeply moving it was to watch the penniless authors methodically consume the free sandwiches.\nI cannot speak for Roland, but as far as I recall I ate only a single sandwich.\n###"}

Only after the picture had been published, along with its twenty-five compadres, in the big fat paperback Small Press Yearbook (date forgotten, but circa 1990) did I discover that the Bunting in question was not flags but a bird.

{"prompt": "Constipated Bees\n", "completion": " \"Among the animals who expend industry on hygiene and the protection of their dwellings, we must place Bees in the first line. It may happen that mice, snakes, and moths may find their way into a hive. Assaulted by the swarm, and riddled with stings, they die without being able to escape. These great corpses cannot be dragged out by the Hymenoptera, and their putrefaction threatens to cause disease. To remedy this scourge the insects immediately cover them with propolis--that is to say, the paste which they manufacture from the resin of poplars, birches, and pines. The corpse thus sheltered from contact with the air does not putrefy. In other respects Bees are very careful about the cleanliness of their dwellings; they remove with care and throw outside dust, mud, and sawdust which may be found there. Bees are careful also not to defile their hives with excrement, as Kirby noted; they go aside to expel their excretions, and in winter, when prevented by extreme cold or the closing of the hive from going out for this purpose, their bodies become so swollen from retention of faeces that when at last able to go out they fall to the ground and perish.\"\nFrom The Industries Of Animals by Frederic Houssay (1893)\nIs that not inexpressibly sad?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Origin Of The Potato Disorder\n", "completion": " Here is another newspaper cutting quoted in Deadly Encounters : Two Victorian Sensations by Richard D Altick, this one from the Illustrated Times, 10 August 1861:\nThat some unusual endemic excitement has been at work, directing weak, debauched, and diseased minds into a homicidal course, must be apparent to every newspaper-reader. May not the electrical condition of the atmosphere exercise some hidden power in this way over the human brain? A correspondent of the Standard, Dr. J. Q. Rumball, a well-known lecturer on science, points out electrical causes as the origin of the potato disorder. It is a fact that lately the finest mechanisms of clockwork, notably those at the Observatory at Greenwich, have been going wrong, without visible derangement or imperfection, and this has been attributed to an abnormal condition of atmospheric electricity. It is surely not a wildly-hazardous theory to suppose that a similar agency acting upon that most susceptible and complex of galvanic machines, the human brain, may have some tendency, if not to the actual increase of crime, of lessening the healthy power which restrains its committal or of aggravating the phrenal disease which but for such influence might have been subdued, or at least retarded.\n###"}

They used to think it a disc floating in water. There are still stupid people who believe it is flat. Every wise child knows that the truth is that the earth is practically a round ball.\nIt will not always be like this, however...what the people of the world will live on in millions of years to come will probably be a tetrahedron. It all looks terribly dull, but it is really tremendously interesting... Let us think about it all.\nI adore that well-placed \"probably\", and it's a bit rich for a tetrahedron-earther to call a flat-earther \"stupid\", but look, look!\n\nThis is how it will be, and you can read further details here. What you cannot read, maddeningly, is the answer to the question that is posed. I for one want to know what sort of people will live on the tetrahedron. Muggletonians? Quakers? Management consultants? Will they use the Mayan calendar? Will the Pope still wear a little white cap? Will the novels of V S Naipaul be in print?

Nor am I even drawing to your attention the incident at Chappaquiddick (1969), though you may very well expect me to.\nNo, what we ought to have celebrated yesterday with flags and bunting and possibly a primitive blood sacrifice was the tenth anniversary of the first ever batch of smokers' poptarts going on sale.

{"prompt": "The Truth About Banbury Cross\n", "completion": " \nGenerations of tinies have grown up learning the nursery rhyme with the Roud Folk Song Index number 21143, to wit:\nRide a cock-horse to Banbury Cross,\n  To see a fine lady upon a white horse;\n  Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,\n  And she shall have music wherever she goes.\nIn a recent earth-shattering research paper, published in The Weekly Earth-Shattering Research Papers Digest, boffins at the Centre For Banbury Cross Studies make a convincing argument that the third line of the rhyme is wrong. Using state of the art techniques involving a big magnetic robot, they claim that it ought to read\nWrinkles on her fingers and boils on her toes.\nThe lady may indeed be fine, but she is also a crone, or a hag. It is thought that she is related by sisterhood to both the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman and the Woman of Twigs, and Shakespeare probably had the trio in mind when he was writing The Tragedie Of Macbeth.\nIn a related development, other boffins at a different Centre, for other Studies, have been using state of the art techniques involving a tiny rubber nozzle to identify the music that the lady with wrinkles on her fingers and boils on her toes was listening to wherever she went. Their unarguable case is that the music was some particularly argumentative German improv racket, made with dustbin lids and hammers and hideous electronic buzzing noises.\nTogether, these two studies shed an entirely new light on the nursery rhyme. It is a light that the present day inhabitants of Banbury Cross find unwelcome, and there have been mutterings in the streets, and dark deeds plotted in the taverns, and pebbles thrown at boffins. Excitingly, the latter hoo-hah has given rise to the creation of a brand new nursery rhyme:\nRide a cock-horse to Banbury Cross\n  To see all the citizens get very cross\n  Let's all throw pebbles at the boffins\n  Until they end up in their coffins.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dobson's Leech Mishap\n", "completion": " Dobson was one of the few pamphleteeers of the 20th century who still took seriously the mediaeval theory of the Four Bodily Humours. To remind readers who have forgotten, and inform those who don't know, here is a commendably concise paragraph from \"Humorous\" Dobson, an unpublished essay by Marigold Chew:\nTaking the Aristotelian elements in turn, the theory was as follows: earth is reflected in the body as black bile, air as yellow bile, fire as blood, and water as phlegm. From these derive the terms melancholic, choleric, sanguine and phlegmatic. Dobson never deviated from his belief that the theory was fundamentally correct. He tended towards melancholy.\nAnd, it should be said, he was so convinced that he also subscribed to the related practice of bloodletting with leeches. Dobson was rarely ill, but when he was, he had a devil of a time trying to find a doctor who would treat him as he wished. On his 61st birthday, suffering from an excess of black bile, he was in luck--or so he thought. An \"alternative therapist\" had opened their doors just down the road. Dobson presented himself and demanded leeching. He was shown into a back room and lo!, leeches were applied to his spindly legs. Unfortunately, the quack used leeches of the genus Helobdella (Glossiphoniidae), rather than Hirudo medicinalis. The latter is, as its name implies, the medicinal leech. It is a quaint, dark cylinder which has thirty three body rings, five pairs of eyes, several pairs of testes and two suckers, one at each end of its body. The head sucker searches and penetrates while the tail sucker holds fast to the host.\nThe result of the wrong type of leech being used was so vile that I shall not repeat it here. Dobson was lucky to survive, but he did, thank the Lord. If you decide to have your blood sucked by leeches, take this helpful anatomical diagram of Hirudo medicinalis with you. You will be able to check that your practicioner is using the correct type of leech, and can rest easy.\n\n###"}

Of course, it is the idiots who are showered with money and kudos.\nIn a brighter, more sensible world, some of the unknown amateurs tirelessly plying their crafts outwith the public gaze would be our stars.

Then there is the faery year of our English birds : spiral evolution of linnets in the frosty skies, loop of the rooks going home to rest, a flock of starlings in autumn black-budding the ash tree a field away, swans angel white clipt out on the leaden lake, thrushes singing like mad in the grey stormy March dawn.\"\nIt is surprising, perhaps, to find that an English nature writer in the first decade of the last century was some kind of proto-Stalinist, but then there is this :\n\"The right enjoyment and study of these things must make men and women happier, completer in understanding in taste and eye, and therefore better members of the State.\"\nQuotes from the prefatory note to The Faery Year by George A B Dewar (1906)\n###"}

I had been hoping to regale you with some choice snippets from his biography of Robert Stephen Hawker, The Vicar Of Morwenstow (1886), but, frankly, I was a little disappointed. The most arresting of Hawker's eccentricities are listed in the opening paragraph of this piece, and Baring-Gould has little to add, save perhaps for a detailed account of the dressing-up-as-a-mermaid incident. (Part of my disappointment was to discover that this was a single occurrence rather than a general Hawker pastime.) However, the book is not without its pleasures, and I feel before we say farewell to Sabine we should mark this additional note about the vicar:\n\"After the death of Mrs Hawker, he fell into a condition of piteous depression, and began to eat opium. He moped about the cliffs, or in his study, and lost interest in every thing...\n\"He took it into his head that he could eat nothing but clotted cream.

But when morning came, they untied him from the post and bundled him into a sack and they carried him on a cart up to the awful cliffs. Banners were flying. The sun burned, brilliant and golden.\nWhen the sack hit the sea, its impact made a splash the like of which none had seen nor heard before. Nor did any of these simple coastal folk have the words to describe what was so anomalous, so eerie, about the splash. They called it the Duggleby Splash, and ever since, on the anniversary, they have tried to recreate it, by tossing the latest priest into the sea in a sack, without success. And every year, on the eve of the anniversary, it is said that a phantom horse is heard a-clopping along the cliffs, each clop sounding like the clack of rosary beads.\nAnd the day after, they send for a new priest, and lo! he comes galloping across the heath.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Ask Uncle Dan\n", "completion": " Dear Uncle Dan\nI have been given a burlap sack full of old crocuses and I have no idea what to do with it. Please help.\nValentine Smew\nUncle Dan says: Well, Valentine, whenever I read the word \"crocuses\" I think of ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging, also called kado, or \"the way of the flowers\". Get yourself a vase and transfer the crocuses from the sack. Throw the sack away. Now--be deft! Manipulate the crocuses with delicacy, taste and vision. There is, of course, the possibility that you lack these qualities, in which case you may be better occupied throwing the crocuses away and retaining the burlap sack. With a pair of scissors and a sewing machine you will soon be able to turn it into a mightily uncomfortable vest which can be wrapped up and given as a Christmas or birthday gift to a devout Roman Catholic. Jesuit priests in particular are known to be fond of such garb. If you do not number any Jesuits among your acquaintances, I would recommend visiting the SJ Web, an excellent resource \"connecting Jesuits and friends around the world\".

These mischievous sprites are reluctant to leave the snug lining of their bags, except to flit from one to another when they become oh so lonesome and feel compelled to procreate. If you creep ever so silently into a postal sorting office in El Paso at dead of night, you might be lucky enough to see a flickering sprite leaping between jiffy bags. If it sees you, it will be vexed, and cast a spell on you, and for twenty-six days and nights you will be tormented by visions of potato-headed monsters spewing ectoplasm in every direction. But if the sprite does not see you, you will have good luck for a twelvemonth, possibly involving the unexpected offer of an appearance in a radio advertisement for a thrilling new detergent or bleach product. That, at any rate, is what I was told by the Weird Woman of Woohooweedywood, and she has yet to be proved wrong in any of her pronouncements or incantations, except for the one about the badger in the hedge.\n\nThese are not Tex-Mex Jiffy Bag Sprites.

{"prompt": "Obnosis\n", "completion": " Here is an extract from a Scientology Handbook:\nThere is a word \"obnosis\" which has been put together from the phrase, \"observing the obvious.\" The art of observing the obvious is strenuously neglected in our society at this time. Pity. It's the only way you ever see anything; you observe the obvious. You look at the isness of something, at what is actually there. Fortunately for us, the ability to obnose is not in any sense \"inborn\" or mystical. But it is being taught that way by people outside of Scientology. How do you teach somebody to see what is there? Well, you put up something for him to look at, and have him tell you what he sees. An individual can practice this on his own or in a group situation, such as a class.\nAnd here is an extract from Janet Reitman's Rolling Stone article \"Inside Scientology\":\n[Scientologists] assert that 75 million years ago, an evil galactic warlord named Xenu controlled seventy-six planets in this corner of the galaxy, each of which was severely overpopulated. To solve this problem, Xenu rounded up 13.5 trillion beings and then flew them to Earth, where they were dumped into volcanoes around the globe and vaporized with bombs. This scattered their radioactive souls, or thetans, until they were caught in electronic traps set up around the atmosphere and \"implanted\" with a number of false ideas -- including the concepts of God, Christ and organized religion. Scientologists later learn that many of these entities attached themselves to human beings, where they remain to this day, creating not just the root of all of our emotional and physical problems but the root of all problems of the modern world.\nOh, and one more extract from Reitman:\nUnique among religious faiths, Scientology charges for virtually all of its religious services.\nI think it can be a useful exercise to obnose those three paragraphs, and draw the obnostic conclusion.\n###"}

You probably think that I am unsuitable, as I am a man who does not actually use your products, and my hair is fairly short, at least in comparison to Andie's, so I won't be able to do that hair-tossing thing very effectively. I can toss my head, though.\nWhere I think I could really make a difference is in my ability to speak the part of the script that includes the scientific information. I enclose a tape recording of one of my practice-runs, and I think you will be impressed at the bit where I say: \"Now with reduced pH values and clinically-tested Norwegian molecule-balancing agents\". As for the punchline--\"Because I'm worth it\" -- I think there is an opportunity here to diversify and create some new catchphrases which will soon be on the lips of millions of people worldwide. As I have indicated, when I toss my head my hair doesn't do that sinuous, flowing, Andie thing, so it looks as if I've got some kind of nervous tic. Well, let's use that!

{"prompt": "Every Person Is Victimised By Satan (Apparently)\n", "completion": " A card popped through the letterbox today from the Morning Star Church Of God. I wondered if this was evidence of some new alliance between the Communist Party and evangelical Christians. Maybe the sermons would consist of harangues from the editorial pages of the Morning Star about the necessity of building the class struggle by going on strike every five minutes. I looked in vain for a hammer-and-sickle-and-crucifix motif on the card, then turned my attention to the text:\nAre You A Victim?, it read, Every person is victimised by Satan, either by Depression, Stress, Heart Problems, Baroness, Skin Diseases, Kidney, Cancer, ENT and many more. No Hope + No Cure = No Peace. But There Is Hope.\nMy initial surmise about the Communist element was clearly correct. Not only does Satan plague us with ailments and infirmities, but sets the aristocracy against us in the form of that Baroness. I pictured a sort of fairy tale baddie, or \"Baroness\" Margaret Thatcher, though of course it's hard to tell the difference.\nIncidentally, when I am eventually ennobled, as is bound to happen sooner or later, I think I'd like to be a Baron.

{"prompt": "Is Jesus Irresponsible?\n", "completion": " Dear Mr Key, writes Pansy Cradledew, I fear I must protest that you gave publicity to Jesus Inspirational Sport Statues by including it as one of your so-called 'detours' yesterday. In many of the representations, Jesus is shown inappropriately dressed for the sport, such as attempting to kick a football in sandals, or perform ballet in an ancient Hebrew shift. By choosing not to wear kneepads or safety helmet when rollerblading, Our Lord is setting a poor example to today's youth with His reckless behaviour. In many of the scenes, He only seems to be participating in the sport half-heartedly, just standing around with His arms posed in what He thinks is some kind of benevolent attitude. It's all a bit wishy-washy and unsportsgodlike. As for the golf statue, should He not be mindful of the traumas the Roman Catholic church has undergone in recent years due to the antics of its less salubrious priests? Yours in Christ, Pansy Cradledew.\n\nHaving reviewed the site, and looked more carefully at some of the statues, I think Pansy has a point. In any case, would it not be more inspirational to show the little tots with Satan looming over their shoulders, threatening them with fire and brimstone unless they perked their ideas up and went out there to win?

A striking feature of the material is that, almost invariably, mention is made of Harry Price. Wishing to discover more about the \"veteran ghost-hunter\" than was divulged in scattered references, I obtained a copy of Search For Harry Price by Trevor H. Hall (Duckworth, 1978). What a hoot! The book proves to be a sustained character assassination, demonstrating in forensic detail that Price was a liar and a fraud and a charlatan, not only in the field of ghost-hunting, but, earlier in his life, as a numismatist, archaeologist, and book-collector. It is a highly entertaining read, and I have not yet arrived at the part, promised in the preface, where Hall examines \"the ridiculous Brocken affair ... the 'magical experiment' in the Harz Mountains in which a goat was supposed to change into a beautiful youth (which attracted some 800 press reports in over a dozen countries)\".

It was sitting, or lying, or just generally disporting itself on the garden wall of a neighbour. It was so still that I assumed it was in a badger-like doze. The morning was, after all, grimly hot. I ran into my house (The Dobson Compound) to fetch a camera, intending to take a snapshot to add to my album of over seventeen badger photographs.

{"prompt": "Frustum, Tang, Sluice\n", "completion": " One of Confidential Agent Blot's earlier investigative triumphs was cracking the case of the dishevelled marmalade man. Let us recall the facts. The whinnying of horses had disturbed the sleep of the little village of Spraingue for two months. There was a damp, hideous thing in the corner of the post office that none dared approach. Perhaps most jarring of all, an illegal cafeteria had been built slap in the middle of the village, surrounded by menacing guard dogs whose fangs glistened in the moonlight. Agent Blot arrived on the scene on a Tuesday afternoon frantic with gales. His dazzling cone-shaped hat made the villagers wonder what frustum it had once topped. His complexion was paler, more drawn and anguished than usual, possibly because a change in diet had given him a recent attack of the seeds, from which he was not yet fully recovered. His breath was tanged with the fumes of his weird pills, those tiny pink spangles Dr Glag had insisted upon. Agent Blot commandeered an abandoned birdseed silo as his headquarters, and subjected every single villager to a lengthy interrogation. His manner was charming but curiously unnerving. The clinic was soon filled with haunted-looking patients demanding to have their brains sluiced with Baxter's Terrible Fluid. By Saturday afternoon, with no let up in the gales, Spraingue had an air of almost Biblical calamity.

{"prompt": "Rebranding\n", "completion": " As we reported on Tuesday, today sees Snow White's tiny friends the seven dwarves adopting new names as part of a long-overdue rebranding exercise (see 9th March). Inspired by their example, we have decided to rebrand Hooting Yard itself. Readers are invited to send in suggestions, bearing in mind that in the corporate world exciting, vibrant and dynamic new identities are invariably limited to one word, usually ending in -A, and probably in fake Latin--think Aviva, Consignia, Engenda and so on.

{"prompt": "In A Cardboard Box\n", "completion": " In a cardboard box on a wooden shelf in a broom cupboard behind a door in a corridor on the ground floor of a shabby house on an ill-lit lane winding towards the sea in a land whipped by blizzards and gales, there is an old picture postcard, stuffed in among a jumble of papers and scraps and cotton-reels and bobbins and pins and clinker and orts and scantlings. The picture on the postcard is of a pavilion on a green by the sea. On the other side of the postcard, to which in one corner is stuck a postage stamp, there is scrawled in fading ink an illegible name and address, and a message, written in block capitals and unpunctuated, and it says DO NOT FORSAKE ME O MY DARLING.\nIf we knew who lived in the shabby house on the ill-lit lane, if we rapped upon the door with a stick to coax them into the open, ah, then we might be able to find out who had forsaken whom, so many years ago, before the ink faded on the postcard, in the past, when the blizzards and the gales whipping the land were more violent, or so we are told in the tavern near the beach, by ancient sailors who remember, remember the weather, the weather.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Self-Tidying Gulls\n", "completion": " Last week we looked at self-tidying swans, and we can now extend our ornithological researches courtesy of Johnny Seven. Mr Seven, incidentally, is a man to whom you should be profoundly thankful. Not only does he present the excellent \"Pull The Plug\" show on ResonanceFM, but he is currently the sound engineer charged with making sure Mr Key's dulcet tones are transmitted into your ears every week.\nLong, long ago, in the last century, Johnny snapped a gang of self-tidying seagulls. He writes: \"Taken on Tuesday 10th December 1984 (I know this since it's written on the back of the photographs), I was interested in the slate-grey blanket of fog shrouding the trees on the embankment in Putney. No sooner had I set up the tripod than the hungry birds came (picture no.1). See their expectant little faces. Imagine their disappointment when croutons were not scattered. I moved further back to get a wider (and, to be honest, less pleasingly composed) view, and the gulls moved further up the railing toward me, increasing in number (picture no.2, and detail).\"\n\n\n\nYou will note that, unlike the self-tidying swans, these self-tidying gulls are not accompanied by an equal number of water gulls. This is due to their choice of emperchment, upon railings, if, indeed, it was a conscious choice. Who can say what weird shenanigans occur in the tiny brains of birds? One thing we can be sure of is that they know how to line up very neatly, with the precision for which self-tidying gulls are applauded, in some circles.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Glib Dabbler\n", "completion": " \nI exhume the tale of the glib hatter in The Dabbler this week. When the piece first appeared here at Hooting Yard, long long ago, I remember that I was bombarded with letters from readers desperate to be told what sort of hats the hatter made, and in what manner his glibness manifested itself. I refused to answer those questions at the time, as I refuse to answer them now. There is only so far one can go when holding the reader by the hand and leading him or her along the fictional path. The fictional path is a very different path to a real path, of kerbstones perhaps, or just gravel. One can be led a merry dance along either kind of path, if that takes one's fancy, and if it does one might find the dance leader is a hatter, and a glib one at that. Or so I am told.\n###"}

In these tumours were contained and cherished many Putrefactions and rotten clods, covered over with certain small skins, this putrefied stuff, being moistened with dew by night, and the Sun heating it by day, after a certain season became ripe, and the skins being broken, thence issued all kinds of living creatures, whereof, they that had quickest heat, became Birds, the earthy ones became creeping beasts, the waterish ones became Fishes in the sea, and they which were mean, as it were, between all these, became walking-creatures.\" -- Giambattista Della Porta, The Second Book Of Natural Magick\n###"}

I will be celebrating by drinking a flask of aerated lettucewater and sacrificing a (vegan, marzipan) goat.\nOnce upon a time, of course, radio shows were fugitive, ephemeral things, but today, with the wonders of podcasting, untold hours of Mr Key's babbling remain available for you to download from the ResonanceFM archive. Apparently, thousands of people do, certainly more than ever read this blog.\nThis seems as good a time as any, then, to note that a new podcast maestro has taken over the reins, whose self-appointed task is to increase the frequency of releases. Past programmes have been issued as podcasts generally about once a fortnight, but the plan now is for them to appear twice a week, until the backlog is cleared.\nFor an insight into the tremendous technical challenges of the process, I refer you to this piece from the 2006 archives. Little has changed, save perhaps for the metal from which the maestro's hat has been welded.\nMy thanks are due to the podcast maestro and his predecessors, and you can make their dedication to this noble cause worthwhile by subscribing, downloading, and listening, for so long and so often that Mr Key's voice haunts your dreams. And please remember that the very existence of ResonanceFM is a fragile and rickety thing, and your donations to the station will help it to survive.\n###"}

{"prompt": "A Postcard From The Last Century\n", "completion": " In 1982 I spent much of my time making postcards, which I sold for a pittance to eager punters from what would now be called a pop-up stall in Norwich. Below is an example of the sort of thing I was doing.\nThe source material for both words and images was a huge pile of National Geographic magazines from the 1950s and 1960s acquired from various second-hand bookshops. To create the captions I employed a cut-up technique akin to that used by William S Burroughs and David Bowie, but far more amusingly than either of them ever did, particularly the former, a tedious gun-toting drug-addled uxoricide.\nYounger readers may find it difficult to fathom, but in Norwich in 1982 it was well nigh impossible to find an affordable colour photocopying facility. I thus sent my originals to my friend Peter Ross in London, and Peter organised the copying and sent me the results by post. I then employed scissors and glue to mount the hysterically funny images on to card, ready for sale to East Anglians.\nI think Peter is still in possession of most of the original artwork, but this one came to light the other day. The captions read as follows:\nUndimmed by Death\nWho were they?\nIn this convivial land, trendy youngsters like Walter And Jorg searched the ground for clues.\nWalter and Jorg are each identified by separate name captions.\n\n###"}

In the pocket of his weskit, where his fob watch ought to have been, he kept a supply of tin baubles, and he would throw these at any birds that came within his range, particularly guillemots, which he loathed, and cormorants, which he did not understand, but his aim was not good, and he usually missed.One of his arms was withered from scrofula.\nHis fob watch lay, abandoned, in the untidy drawer of his escritoire, hidden among old pencils, bits of calico, drawing pins, bottle tops, cornflakes and dust.

{"prompt": "On Pugton Hill\n", "completion": " While shepherds watched their flocks at night on Pugton Hill the wind blew wild and there were shimmerings or ghostly gleams. One shepherd had a wristwatch and told the time to the other two. Down below Pugton Hill on the main arterial road huge container lorries thundered past on their way to the ferry. The shepherds smoked their pipes. The lorries too belched smoke for there were no laws in place to stop them so doing. Nor were there speed limits. Crashes and pile-ups and terrible accidents were common at that time in that place below Pugton Hill. When they heard or saw dimly in the black night a grievous traffic incident the shepherds laughed for their hearts were cold and void of human sympathy. They preferred the company of nocturnal sheep wide awake and terrified as sheep are for most of their time on earth and on Pugton Hill. So slowly the hands of the wristwatch tock off the minutes and the hours. The shepherds are waiting for a sign. There is no signage on the main arterial road save for an occasional arrow pointing towards the ferry. No sign points the way back for none of the huge speeding lorries ever comes back. They carry the contents of the country load by load to the ferry and never return past Pugton Hill atop which the shepherds smoke and laugh and are fiercely protective of their terrified sheep. Glory be for yes it is a kind of glory up there above the road as the wind blows wild in the night on Pugton Hill.\n###"}

He dashed outside into the mist that engulfed the hotel grounds.\nAgnetha and Benny slumped in the lobby armchairs, expecting to hear a rifle shot in the distance. But none came.

It is common, too, to see looks of disappointment, even devastation, cross their faces, when they open their eyes to find the beach unchanged from how it was five minutes before. This is because the sands at Shifting Sands are not shifting sands. They are what are known as inert sands, roughly speaking. What shifting occurs, occasioned by the wind and the tides, is slow and imperceptible.\nWhat they do have at Shifting Sands are perilous pockets of quicksand. Beware!

A small to medium sized member of the bird family Thraupidae, the tanager picks insects off branches, often has a rather dull song, and lives in a cup nest on a tree branch. Sometimes the cup can be almost globular, but that's a tanager for you. Because it is a tropical bird, flocks of tanagers are incredibly rare in the sky around Haemoglobin Towers, so the majority of Hooting Yard's new year tanager birds are made of paper or cardboard. Well, all of them. The making of paper or cardboard birds, often very elaborate ones, but sometimes really quite shoddy and slapdash, has long been found to be a splendid way of keeping the tinies of Pang Hill Orphanage busy during the winter nights, when other, more fortunate children are fast asleep. Throughout the month of December, the orphanage attic, open to the freezing and black night sky, rings out with the jolly cries of infants competing with each other to craft the very best paper or cardboard tanager using shredded newspaper or crumpled cartons or torn-up Popsie The Pig annuals donated by a foundlings' charity. These latter are eagerly grasped by the larger and more lumbering orphans, for the pretty coloured pictures of Popsie The Pig and her pals make for splendid plumage on the paper birds. On New Year's Eve, each tiny collapses with exhaustion on the floor of the attic, and a trio of worthies roams among their fallen little bodies, destroying all but one of the paper or cardboard tanagers with hammers and slicers. The sole surviving paper bird is carried off for the Hooting Yard festivities that begin at dawn on New Year's Day, by which time the orphans have been bundled downstairs and locked into the filthy and infested canteen for their breakfast of cauliflower water and radishes.\n###"}

I don't suppose you'd care to tell me about that, would you?\" Or I may be queueing in the post office to buy a postage stamp or two, when the person behind me, sometimes on crutches, will tap me on the shoulder and say: \"I could tell by looking at the back of your head that you were borp. What was it like?\" Every so often, I am asked in writing, usually in a crabbed and barely legible hand.\nI wish I could say that I try to give a full and frank answer. I wish I could say I responded, at least, politely. But I do not.\nMy usual tactic is to gibber like unto a monkey, toss my not so golden locks, what's left of them, and execute a little pirouette. I then remove from my blazer pocket a crucifix, kiss it, and set it on fire with my Ignitofab lighter.\nAs Perkins run through with a rapier, so Himmelfarb bewildered in the gloaming. There are things fit only for the ears of those who dwell in Cretin Town. Was it Browning who wrote about \"the bough of cherries some officious fool / Broke in the orchard\"? There are no fools in my orchard any longer. I sent them packing, one by one, from Thursday through to the following Monday, yes, even on the Lord's Day I chased a fool from my orchard, by dint of borp.\nWish me Godspeed, and count the circle of toads, for borp is borp and shall ever be as never be in witlessness and pox.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Spem in Alium\n", "completion": " \"Spem in alium is surely not just the greatest of all Thomas Tallis' musical achievements, but one of the great musical compositions of all time. Writing for forty independent voices, Thomas Tallis created a noble and imaginative masterpiece.\" That's what one of the record companies selling a CD of the motet--chosen yesterday by Poppy Nisbet--has to say, and I don't disagree. It is quite sublime.\nIn these leaden days when nobody knows Latin anymore, it is useful to provide a translation of the title. I was somewhat disconcerted by this email from Tim Thurn:\n\"Spem in alium: alium is Latin for onion, so Spem in must mean The world is just a great big. Close listening reveals an astonishing affinity between Tallis' work and the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell soul classic. For those who think garlic is a more accurate rendering of alium, and if we accept that spem translates as hope, then the motet is clearly an eleven minute incantation to ward off vampires. In the week of Michael Howard's Conservative Party conference, it is essential listening.\"\nI suggest Tim buys himself a Latin dictionary. The full title of the work is Spem in alium numquam habui, which means I have never put my hope in any other. Tallis is referring not to Michael Howard, Marvin Gaye, nor Tammi Terrell, but to Deus Israel qui irasceris et propitius eris et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione dimittis, the God of Israel who will be angry and yet become again gracious and who forgives all the sins of suffering man. Whether He, She or It will forgive Tim Thurn's sins is a moot point. I wouldn't.\n\nThomas Tallis\n###"}

{"prompt": "Tiny Little Hands, Decisive Mustachios\n", "completion": " Much of the work of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) was written for piano. This is surprising when one considers how tiny his hands were. Indeed, there were two occasions during his short, fraught life when he injured them while relentlessly practising piano pieces which called for hands larger than his own.\nTiny his hands may have been, but this puny neurasthenic Russian cultivated a pair of decisive mustachios.\n\nAmong his orchestral works, the Poem of Ecstasy, opus 54, is a supremely bonkers piece which, long before Spinal Tap, goes up to eleven. One critic imagined he was hearing a graphic portrayal of the players all having sex with each other. Another refers to the \"malignant sneers from muted trombones... was music ever more evil-sounding\"?\nNot everyone appreciated Scriabin at the time, of course. The man who was chosen to conduct the premiere of his Second Symphony complained \"After Scriabin, Wagner lisps sweetly like a suckling babe. I think that I will go mad any moment now. Where can one hide from such music? Help me!\"\nMy favourite Scriabin piece is the Mysterium. This was designed as a total art work, involving an orchestra, dance, light, and exotic perfumes, to be performed in the Himalayas, its playing ushering in Armageddon. Mysterium would be \"a grandiose religious synthesis of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world\" and the emergence of a Nietzschean Superman. Whether this Superman would have tiny little hands and decisive mustachios we do not know, for Scriabin succumbed to septicemia when the composition was barely begun. It thus has a place in the museum of lost or non-existent works of art, about which I shall write more soon.\n###"}

The text given here has been transcribed by Marigold Chew from a dictaphone recording made by Dobson which was lost for many years, and only recently came to light, hidden behind the pipes of an intricate plumbing system in the basement of the Pang Hill Fireworks Factory. What it was doing there is anybody's guess. Dobson is known to have had various altercations with the janitor of the factory, one Joost Van Dongelbracke, who later became famous--or infamous--as the \"Suburban Shaman\", founder of a cult which gained an incredible four million adherents across Europe and North America in the 1970s before imploding in ghastly circumstances.

But I confess I am very intrigued. In a world of fluffyheads, pseudoscientists, conspiracy theorists, theocratic nutters and whatnot, who would have thought that the greatest and most dangerous enemy of Reason is poultry? This calls for proper investigation, before the majestic achievements of the Enlightenment are brought crashing to the ground by vengeful and unreasonable hens.

Nevertheless, until I am able to bring you further revelations, keep a beady eye on any poultry you come across. Meanwhile, I shall begin by looking up what Diderot had to say about hens, to discover if he had any inklings of the threat.\nUPDATE : Hmm, this could prove significant. In D'Alembert's Dream (1769), Diderot has Bordeu say this : \"But here's a strange fact which countless educated people will tell you is true but which is false, namely, that in the poultry yard of the archduke they've seen a disgusting rabbit who used to act as a cock and service around twenty shameless hens who were happy with the arrangement. The people will add that they have been shown some chickens covered with fur which were the products of this bestiality. You can be sure they were ridiculed.\"\nClearly my next step must be to conduct a rigorous survey of the poultry yards of archdukes.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Fictitious Sports\n", "completion": " It is monumentally curious, is it not, that fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol won renown in sports which are not, themselves, remotely fictional? Polevaulting and haring round and round a running track are both activities in which plenty of non-fictional athletes have taken part, in the past as in the present day. Now, the release of previously repressed passages from the Memoirs of Bobnit Tivol's coach and mentor, the catarrh-wracked, Homburg-wearing Old Halob, show how sporting history might have taken a different path.\nUnlike his protege, Old Halob was of course all too terrifyingly real, yet he harboured a deep love for fictitious sports. While Bobnit Tivol was scampering round and round those cinder running tracks following his punishing training regime, Old Halob, we now learn, was dreaming of pitting his champion against Markus Geissler, the big Austrian, in a Guyball match. It remained a dream, for all the cantankerous trainer's attempts to enrol the fictional athlete in a Guyball team came to naught through a series of mishaps. Telegrams went astray, railway timetables proved to be forgeries, buses crashed, the addresses on envelopes were smudged to illegibility by rainfall... those sorts of mishap dogged Old Halob.\nLater in the same year, he was in secret talks with John Tetrad and Max Quad in an attempt to have Bobnit Tivol join their fennel team. In this case, it seems negotiations were far advanced, and only fell apart when nobody could find a fictional pen with which the fictional athlete could sign on the fictional dotted line of a fictional contract. This prompted the strange, almost hallucinatory passage in the repressed Memoirs where Old Halob blathers on for page after page bemoaning the non-existence of a well-stocked fictional stationery shop.\nTake it from me, the Repressed Memoirs Of Old Halob is suitable reading for repressed sport enthusiasts of any stripe.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Foes\n", "completion": " \nSometimes it can happen that you find yourself with a foe, or enemy. This may be the result of some ancient blood feud, or it may be more recent. You might, say, steal some fruit from a greengrocer and thereafter the greengrocer becomes your foe. I am not suggesting for one moment that Hooting Yard readers are the kind of people who go around stealing plums or berries, I simply use that as an example. Ancient blood feuds are more complicated, often having their origin in the doings--or misdoings--of your remote ancestors, for which you are in no way responsible. That being so, you should nevertheless be aware that an ancient blood feud foe is likely to be alarming, vicious, and bent on violence, whereas the greengrocer whose plum you slipped in your pocket may not remain your foe for long. The greengrocer's enmity is of a less frenzied sort.\nIt is a good idea to assess the level of enmity your foe feels towards you before accepting their invitation to meet, unarmed, at the top of a high tower. If they have a foe-score of more than seven point five, it may well be that they plan to push you over the edge of the tower so that you plunge to your doom on the savage rocks below. Less than seven point five and your foe may simply have chosen a place with breathtaking views the better to facilitate a little chat, after which bygones will be bygones.\nOf course, arriving at the foe-score is not an exact science, so when you have conducted the tests it is advisable to repeat them. Always allow for a margin of error. Should it be your judgement that your life would be imperilled by meeting your foe in a high tower, do try to send a polite note explaining that you will be unable to make the appointment. Invent an excuse if necessary, but try to cleave to the truth if you can.\nNext week : the stolen plums, or berries.\n###"}

Which is not to say there were no flies in his realm, for god knows they were legion. But whereas the pigs were devoted to Uncle Tom, and considered him their Lord and Saviour, the flies showed no such obeisance. Why would they?\nUnderneath Uncle Tom's cabin was his wine cellar, bottle after bottle after bottle after bottle after bottle in serried horizontal ranks on his subterranean shelving racks. He was particularly fond of cabernet sauvignon, which had a couple of shelves all to itself. None of the pigs ever got to go down the iron spiral staircase into the cellar. Uncle Tom did not want any of his bottles accidentally smashed by a clumsy lumbering and perhaps terrified pig.\nUncle Tom was a great friend of the legendary Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin.

When these two had issue, this was the ant-lion, partaking of the features of its parents, its forepart being that of a lion and its hindquarters like an ant.

Instead, every book fanatic knows that the quaint, humane system used in the London Library is much clearer: all the interesting stuff is in Science and Miscellaneous and arranged alphabetically. Fruit Farming follows Flagellation.\nThus Stephen Bayley, in the Telegraph, while bemoaning the decimalisation of our currency forty years ago.

You should be aware that Crestfallen Dan is not only crestfallen but litigious.

{"prompt": "Buying An Island\n", "completion": " It was just as well that the Lemane plan had been abandoned, as Richard Bradley's efforts to buy the island for the crown had descended into farce. Stopping to purchase some goods to take upriver as 'dashes'--that is, gifts or bribes--he had been blackmailed by a local trader into buying far more merchandise than he had intended. Then he had been made to pay a large number of 'barrs', or small iron bars worth five shillings each, to local figures. Bradley paid barrs not only to such dignitaries as the 'King of Barra' and the 'master of Gillifree' but to two 'Key Keepers', the 'Tobabmanser of Jancacunda' and to the latter's retinue of fifty servants. The Tobabmanser was unable to conduct any negotiations without his 'singing Man' (who also required payment in barrs of course), and when the 'King of Lemain' arrived he also brought a large retinue of servants, including the requisite key keeper, singing man and principal marabout. The whole negotiations cost much more than Bradley had anticipated, and during the palaver, wilting in the West African rainforest, he sickened and died. Later, his brother Henry would proudly announce to Sydney that the island had been purchased, only to discover that he had laboured in vain as the government had abandoned the plan.\nfrom Emma Christopher, A Merciless Place : The Lost Story Of Britain's Convict Disaster In Africa (2011)\n###"}

{"prompt": "I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night\n", "completion": " I had too much to dream last night, and for once I didn't dream about my weak and not good Bomba. I dreamed about an electric prune, and it looked like this:\n\nIt was shouting \"The Kol Nidre! The Kol Nidre!\", whatever that might mean, and then it was joined by two more prunes, equally electrified:\n\nI was somehow aware that I was in the middle of a dream, and I was desperate to wake up. I had a feeling of terror that these prunes would begin to celebrate a Mass, not necessarily a Black Mass but perhaps something worse, a Mass in F Minor. I was sure it would be portentous and horrifying, but I was powerless to stop it. I think I may have been chewing my pillow and beating my puny fists on the mattress. Suddenly yet another electric prune came shimmering into view:\n\nThere was a heavy, rumbling sound, redolent of uberprog. The phrase \"release of an oath\" hammered through my brain, over and over again. The dream was becoming a nightmare. I yearned for some kind of respite. I sensed that a fifth prune, as electric as the others, would push forward to haunt me. It did, and there they all were, lined up in a row:\n\nTime seemed to go into reverse. That hideous noise became delightful, chirpy, sweetly innocent yet somehow a little bonkers. It was a bit like pop music, but not quite. Now all became clear. Despite my weak and not good Bomba, I was as one with the children of rain, the children of sand. I woke up to a sparkling morning, my soul refreshed, my Bomba in fine fettle.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Waugh In The Lion's Den\n", "completion": " From 1973 to 1975 Auberon Waugh wrote a regular column for the New Statesman. So unlikely was this alliance that Waugh gave the apposite title In The Lion's Den to a 1978 book collecting fifty of his pieces. In the introduction, he described the imaginary New Statesman reader he was addressing:\nMy image of the New Statesman reader was that of a taut, slightly embittered female school-teacher, possibly in Coventry but certainly in one of the less well-favoured areas of the country, struggling valiantly against the inherited and environmental disabilities of her charges to preserve some quasi-theological Hope in the socialist future. She was a convinced atheist and a convinced progressive in sexual matters although her own experiences in that field had seldom been encouraging. In foreign affairs she was endlessly progressive but in home affairs subject to strange disciplinarian urges which might suddenly demand unspeakable punishments not only for racists, rapists and male chauvinists, but also for litter-louts, cigarette-smokers and males generally. She approved of homosexuality and unmarried mothers, disapproved of drink and drugs, approved of education, disapproved of anyone excelling in it, approved, rather nervously, of the working class in most of its manifestations except football hooliganism and represented, in fact, the only surviving bastion of middle class values.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Now We Are Six\n", "completion": " I must apologise for echoing A A Milne in the title of this postage.

However, thanks to No. 25,088 set by Crucible, I can bring you up to speed.\nIt seems Splotchy Astrid was tucking in to some tiramisu in a worldly teashop, when a lethargic menial began playing an anthem of the Resistance on a viola. A chill came over the room, and a sagacious adult customer challenged the menial to a bout of fisticuffs. The reproachful spinster was well aware that this was a lethal locality, for her itinerary had taken her past the sordid roadsign, daubed with four letter words, which led her here in the first place.

{"prompt": "Pebblehead's Book Of British Pebbles\n", "completion": " Pebblehead's Book Of British Pebbles is something of a departure for the bestselling paperback potboilerist. Best known for his fat airport-bookstall blockbusters with one-word titles ending in an exclamation mark, his latest tome is a picture book featuring hundreds of snaps of pebbles accompanied by sprightly and vivid explanatory texts.\n\"For many years I have been collecting pebbles,\" said Pebblehead, sheltering from the rain under an umbrella outside a sordid backstreet bordello where he was buttonholed by an eager young cub reporter from a regional newspaper, \"And it occurred to me to exploit my success as a writer of potboilers to bring the joy of pebbles to a wider audience.

Some of you, when you go down from the University, will go into the Church, or to the Bar, or to the House of Commons, or to the Home Civil Service, or to the Indian or Colonial Services, or into various professions. Some may go into the Army, some into industry and commerce; some may become country gentlemen. A few--I hope a very few--will become teachers or dons. Let me make this clear to you. Except for those in the last category, nothing that you will learn in the course of your studies will be of the slightest possible use to you in after life--save only this--that if you work hard and intelligently you should be able to detect when a man is talking rot, and that, in my view, is the main, if not the sole, purpose of education.\nJohn Alexander Smith, Waynflete Professor of Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy at Oxford, introducing a series of lectures in 1914.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Plums In The Puddle\n", "completion": " This is an outdoor game that will bring gleeful smiles to tinies and adults alike. Buy a bag of plums from the greengrocer's and whistle as you and your family stride purposefully to a place of puddles. It might be a canal towpath or a field or even a derelict shopping precinct, and there need only be a single puddle. Take the plums out of the bag and distribute them to the family members so that everyone has the same number. If the numbers of persons and plums do not match up, you can either put the plums back into the bag and go back to the greengrocer's to buy some more, or have one or more family members carted away by the secret police. Once you have that settled, the game can begin. Each takes their turn to throw their plum or plums into the puddle. If someone's plum misses the puddle, and lands on the towpath or the grass or the concrete, they can either take their turn again, or pay a forfeit, such as being carted away by the secret police. When all the plums are bobbing about in the puddle, the game is over and you can all go home, taking a short detour past the secret police interrogation centre to attempt to retrieve any family members who have been carted there. This will usually be pointless, however, as the secret policeman at the gate will deny any knowledge of your family members and insist that the interrogation centre is but an innocent warehouse or office building. Do not become jumpy or ill-tempered with the secret policeman or you are likely to become an unperson, after a period of interrogation, and you won't be throwing any plums into a puddle ever again.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Myers & Butler\n", "completion": " To a man of [Frederic] Myers' eager temperament restrained indifference was not possible; his pent-up enthusiasm was sooner or later sure to find some line of discharge. And it so happened that a ready line of discharge was at that point presented to him by the crusading Christianity of Mrs. Josephine Butler, the still young and beautiful wife of George Butler, Vice-Principal of Cheltenham College, and later Principal of Liverpool College. Mrs. Butler later, of course, became famous for her work among prostitutes and her campaign against the Contagious Diseases Acts. At this time however she was chiefly engaged in what might be described as the spiritual seduction of promising young men. Her religion was emotional rather than dogmatic, and her methods of conversion were simple. Having aroused her quarry by her exciting concern for his welfare, she would flatter him with an earnest account of her own inner trials and victories--an account delivered perhaps at twilight while she lay with her slim form stretched out upon a sofa--and at last capture him by a well-staged denouement. She might, for instance, call him into her room to find her kneeling in pale beauty before her mirror, devoutly praying for his salvation. Only men with the coolest heads could resist such an appeal; and Myers was not one of them. During the next few years he met or visited Mrs. Butler repeatedly, and his way of life changed so much that his friends hardly knew him. One of them, Richard Jebb, noted in his Journal for 26 February 1866: \"Myers devotes himself to self-discipline. He never goes anywhere. He gets up at 6.30 and goes to bed at 10.00. His days are spent in reading Ecce Homo and in thinking.\"\nAlan Gauld, The Founders of Psychical Research (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1968)\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Dobsonmeter\n", "completion": " \"Dear Frank,\" writes Richard Carter of Gruts, \"This week's New Scientist  (20 September, 2008) contains the rather stirring story of how a lone British Antarctic Survey scientist managed to give NASA a red face by discovering the hole in the ozone layer with a 50-year-old instrument assembled in a shed. The instrument was called a Dobsonmeter.\"\nThe Dobsonmeter was invented by a certain Gordon Dobson, who may or may not have been related to the out of print pamphleteer whose doings are so assiduously chronicled at Hooting Yard. Judging by these excerpts from the New Scientist piece, there is a definite affinity:\nWithout [Joe] Farman, the truth [about the ozone layer] might not have been discovered for several years or more. But he couldn't have done it without his trusty Dobsonmeter, first assembled in a shed outside Oxford more than 50 years earlier by another dogged researcher, Gordon Dobson from the University of Oxford's Clarendon Laboratory...\nThe odd thing about the Dobsonmeter is that for a quarter-century it was an instrument without much use. It finally came into its own during the International Geophysical Year of 1957, when researchers decided to make global measurements of the ozone layer. They put in an order for around 50 Dobsonmeters with the London instrument maker, R. & J. Beck.\nFarman remembers going to Oxford to pick up his machine from Dobson in 1956. \"Even after 25 years, they hadn't completed the instruction manual,\" he recalls. \"That only arrived the following year.\" Farman still has his original copy. For best results, it recommends wrapping a quilt round the instrument to keep it warm.\nOnly about 120 Dobsonmeters were ever made, of which some 50 remain in use. Each is known by its number. Dobson's original, No 1, is in London's Science Museum. Farman made his discoveries with Nos 37 and 51. Probably the oldest still in use is No 8, now 73 years old and sitting on the roof of the Norwegian Polar Institute in Svalbard. Dobson died in 1976, so he never saw his instrument's finest hour.\n###"}

Ever since he was tiny, Chiles had hankered to feature in an exciting news story alongside sea creatures, and now his thunder had been stolen by the octogenarian pretend chimney-sweep! It was too much to bear.\nYet, rather than turning his twisted mental havoc upon Dick Van Dyke, the West Bromwich Albion-supporting anchorman began to plot vengeance against the very sea creatures which until now had fascinated him. In his mania, he decided to obliterate the largest sea creature he could obtain, to obliterate it in the most disgusting way, by eating it. And he decided to make of his revenge a festive occasion, by arranging his foul dinner to take place on the day when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.\nWhat demons swept through his maddened mind, to so finesse his unutterable act?

{"prompt": "The Fishmongers' Prayer\n", "completion": " \"Oh Lord, through Thy infinite grace, shower my counter with bream and plaice\" is the opening couplet of the Fishmongers' Prayer. This has the distinction of being the longest prayer in the English language, which is why you will rarely hear it recited in full. Its length is due to the fact that, within the rolling cadences of its many, many verses, all known types of fish, both edible and inedible, are mentioned at least once. It was the work of a piscatorial monomaniac named Egbert Bock. He was not himself a practising fishmonger, nor indeed did he live in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy little man whose ears were perplexingly shaped, inasmuch as they looked as if they had been stuck to his head upside down. His obsession with fish is thought to have been caused by a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders. Nine times out of ten such happenstance will lead to a phobia, but in Bock's case it had precisely the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were made upon his brain after his death, it was discovered that the areas devoted to fish and the mongering of fish were terrifically shrivelled. Some seaside vicars still include an abridged version of the Fishmongers' Prayer in their services. But not many.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Other Places, Other Names\n", "completion": " While we are on the subject of other worlds (or at least other places), it is worth remembering that Dobson once wrote a pamphlet entitled Netherlands, Holland, Dutch--What's That About? The opening lines provide a summary of its subject matter:\nWe call China China and its people Chinese. We call Finland Finland and its people Finns. We call Germany Germany and its people Germans. I could go on, but I won't. What I want to know is, why do we have two interchangeable names--the Netherlands and Holland--for the country whose inhabitants we call Dutch? Why don't we say Netherlanders or Hollanders? What's all that about?\nIt's a remarkable pamphlet, chiefly because Dobson, having posed an interesting linguistic question, blathers on for over forty pages trying desperately to conceal the fact that he has done no research whatsoever. He simply makes things up and veers off at tangents. One such tangent is Dobson's brief look at what other nationalities call themselves. For example, the Chinese call China Zhongguo, the Finns call Finland Suomi, and, most enticingly, Shqiperi is where Albanians live and breathe and have their being.\nThere are times when I foolishly try to emulate Dobson, and I must confess that, like him, I have not bothered to research this Netherlands--Holland--Dutch business either.

{"prompt": "Light Shining In Buckinghamshire\n", "completion": " Last night I dreamt I wrote Light Shining In Buckinghamshire. My version was completely different to the original - an anonymous Digger tract of 1648--though it was written in archaic prose and contained a plethora of commas. Indeed, it contained many, many more commas than I would ever be likely to deploy, all things considered, when acting in the waking world, so much duller, most of the time, than the phantasmal world of sleep, and by acting, of course, I mean writing, the act of writing, in prose, with commas, but, boy oh boy, not half as many commas as I, or rather the dream me, managed to pack in, furiously, so many they were tripping each other up, almost, in Light Shining In Buckinghamshire, the dream version. That sentence may be grammatically compromised, but that is the price you pay for a plethora of commas.\nMy text was hand-written, and it was clear, or dream-clear, that it would remain as an edition of one. Nevertheless, I got the strong impression that my Light Shining In Buckinghamshire was considered by readers to be the best thing I had ever written.

{"prompt": "Happy Birthday, Franz\n", "completion": " Today is, or would be, Franz Kafka's 121st birthday. Two things worth remembering about Mr K. Although one thinks of him as a haunted, pallid, neurasthenic wreck, he was in fact an enthusiastic oarsman who enjoyed rowing boats. The other thing I find quite arresting is that he was a keen Fletcherist, which made his table manners trying, to say the least. Fletcherism was (is) a system of eating which involves chewing each bite of food until it becomes a watery mass in your mouth before swallowing. This has two effects. First, if you chew a bite of food that long, you will be consuming your meal at a slower rate. Secondly, the reduction of this food to liquid goo means that it will be less difficult to extract the nutrients. I am not sure whether it is true that the recommended number of mastications is thirty-two (one for each tooth). Horace Fletcher (1849-1919) was an American businessman from Lawrence, Massachusetts who expounded his theories in a number of excitingly-titled books, including Fletcherism : What It Is or How I Became Young At Sixty, The New Menticulture, The AB-Z Of Our Own Nutrition, and The New Glutton Or Epicure. He was known to cycle up to two hundred miles a day. Other notable Fletcherists included John D Rockefeller, Upton Sinclair, and Henry James. Incidentally, I read somewhere that Henry James in his final years became deluded and was convinced that he was Napoleon Bonaparte.\nFletcherism ought not be confused with Daltonism, which is the technical term for colour blindness. John Dalton (1766-1844) was a British chemist and physicist, born at Eaglesfield, near Cockermouth in Cumberland. In 1794 he published the first scientific paper on the subject, Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours.\n\nLeft : Mr Kafka. Right : Mr Dalton.

{"prompt": "A History of Starlings\n", "completion": " A third of the world's starling population lives in North America.

Those who do not love starlings see them as pests, and indeed it is not unknown for a hungry flock to devour twenty tons of potatoes, spread histoplasmosis, and make life difficult for bluebirds and woodpeckers.

Now to satisfie the doubts of men we have called this tradition unto experiment; we have given hereof unto Dogs, Chickens, Calves and Horses, and not in the singular in number; yet never could find the least disturbance ensue. There must be therefore other causes enquired of the sudden death and swelling of cattle; and perhaps this insect is mistaken, and unjustly accused for some other. For some there are which from elder times have been observed pernicious unto cattle, as the Buprestis or Burstcow, the Pityocampe or Eruca Pinnum, by Dioscorides, Galen and AEtius, the Staphilinus described by Aristotle and others, or those red Phalangious Spiders like Cantharides mentioned by Muffetus. Now although the animal may be mistaken and the opinion also false, yet in the ground and reason which makes men most to doubt the verity hereof, there may be truth enough, that is, the inconsiderable quantity of this insect. For that a poison cannot destroy in so small a bulk; we have no reason to affirm. For if as Leo Africanus reporteth, the tenth part of a grain of the poison of Nubia, will dispatch a man in two hours; if the bite of a Viper and sting of a Scorpion, is not conceived to impart so much; if the bite of an Asp will kill within an hour, yet the impression scarce visible, and the poison communicated not ponderable; we cannot as impossible reject this way of destruction; or deny the power of death in so narrow a circumscription.\n###"}

For his grave stood open near him; it was covered only with the snows of age, not decked with the green of youth; and he brought with him, from a long and rich life, nothing save errors, crimes, and sickness--a wasted body, a desolate soul, a breast filled with poison, and an old age heavy with repentance and sorrow.\" -- John Mather Austin, Golden Steps To Respectability, Usefulness And Happiness\n###"}
{"prompt": "Rarest Of Rarities\n", "completion": " \nTwenty-six years ago, the Malice Aforethought Press published Penitence And Farm Implements in an edition of twenty-six copies. Each copy was individually lettered from A to Z. The front and back covers contained twenty-six photographs, snipped out of (I think) old copies of National Geographic magazine. One of the original snippages was pasted in on the inside title page of each copy.\nThe preface--or \"A Few Words Before The Drivel\"--ran as follows:\nThe seventy-five pieces in this book were written between 1981 and 1987; they are arranged here in no particular order. Readers whose brains become frazzled by the often turgid nature of these poems may prefer to muck about with the illustrative matter; this consists of sheets of sticky labels inserted here and there within the book. Indeed, it is possible to ignore the texts completely and to spend hours of idle amusement rearranging the pictures in jigsaw-like fashion, or to remove the labels from the book entirely and use them as charming decorative accessories, guaranteed to brighten up the home, office, or slaughterhouse.\nTo which was appended a line from John Aubrey's Brief Lives:\n\"after his Booke came out, he fell mightily in his Practize, and 'twas beleeved by the vulgar that he was crack-brained\".\nThe \"illustrative matter\" consisted of further snippages from National Geographic, printed--in black and white--on to sheets of Gestetner sticky labels. Of the written content, the less said the better.\nPenitence And Farm Implements is possibly the rarest of rare out of print pamphlets published by the Malice Aforethought Press during the last quarter of the last century.

When a space is introduced between the l and the r, we get Owl Rd, where Rd is a common abbreviation for Road. Thus the New World Order is to be found along Owl Road, which is to be the new name for every single road, street, avenue, crescent, mews, lane, path, you get the idea, throughout the kingdom.\nThe usual moaning minnies have raised objections, chiefly the posties and dustbin men and others whose duties require them to navigate the various roads and streets. They--or at least their representatives--say that with every road called Owl Road they will get lost, lost, hopelessly lost, and be unable to perform their functions with due efficiency. To which the king says: \"Pah!\"\nThat is one of the great things about being the king. You can wave your begloved hand disdainfully and say \"Pah!\", and none dare challenge you. The posties' and dustbin men's representatives made a little fuss, it is true, but once the king had glared at them and spat his contempt, they knew better than to persist. They returned to their depots like whipped curs, and held meetings where they told the posties and the dustbin men to get to work, starting on Owl Road.\n\"Don't worry your little proletarian heads about becoming hopelessly lost,\" they were told, \"For how can you be lost when, wherever you are, you know you are on Owl Road?\"\nYou see how the king looks after his subjects? In the New World Order, everybody knows exactly where they are, at every hour of the day and the night.

That Bim was holy, and Bam was not? Or quite the reverse? But wherein does holiness reside? We know it does not reside in holes, the holes, for example, in Bim's socks. There were no holes in Bam's socks, for he was a darner. Or it might be that Bam went sockless. Either way, we know that Bim had never set eyes on a darning-needle, not even the Darning-Needle of Doom.\nThe Darning-Needle of Doom is the one that pierced Bam's soul. At its prick, he heard a bell toll. It tolled for Bam, but it did not toll for Bim. Bim was on his uppers. He drooled into a cup. It was a tin cup he won in a wrestling match. His opponent?

{"prompt": "Birds That Clang\n", "completion": " In a poem she scribbled on the back of a letter to a friend in 1855, the Pre-Raphaelite Muse Lizzie Siddall wrote:\nThe voices of a thousand birds / That clang above my head, / Shall bring me to a sadder dream / When this sad dream is dead.\nA freakish loon by the name of Wilf Birdclang--methinks he changed his name by deed poll--has spent the last fifteen years identifying and cataloguing the thousand different types of bird that make a clanging sound. It would not surprise me if you raised your eyebrows at that sentence, an inner voice exclaiming \"what fresh nonsense is this?\" You are probably of the conviction that few, if any, birds go \"clang\", and certainly not a thousand different types. You might also be thinking to yourself that Lizzie Siddall did not suggest that her clangers were anything but a thousand birds all of the same type. Granted, she does not specify, but I think sheer common sense indicates that she had just one type of bird in mind. What that bird may have been she does not say, thus allowing the likes of Wilf Birdclang to step in with his ludicrous list.\nThe point about his fifteen years' work is that it is all bluster and assertion, without a trace of evidence or argument. For example, the first bird on Wilf's list is the starling. He writes:\n1. The starling. Starlings make loud, even deafening, clanging noises.\nAny ornithologist of repute will tell you that this is complete drivel. Indeed, I am an ornithologist of repute, and I am telling you it is drivel. I have come across any number of starlings in my time, and not one of them has clanged, ever, deafeningly or otherwise.\nWilf Birdclang has now set to work on a list of a thousand sad dreams. Let us hope it proves more rigorous than his birdy twaddle.\n###"}

Much to my annoyance, I failed to identify the source of my quotations, and now I cannot recall where I read them. Very slapdash.\nWhen he wasn't inventing the computer, Charles Babbage spent much of his time getting het up about what he called \"street disturbances\".

I do not own such a set, but that may be a small mercy.

It is said that he was regularly arrested for impersonating Ray Milland at seaside resorts, though this is probably one of those stories that get bandied about by mischief makers. In all the millions of words he wrote, however, Dobson had almost nothing to say on the subject of cinema, save for a throwaway remark towards the end of his essay Six Types Of Snodgrass Implement, where he writes: \"without any doubt the greatest film of all time is Blue Demon Y Las Seductoras\".\n\n###"}

I hadn't thought of that!\nInterviewer--Is there any particular type of buttercup you particularly identify with?\nFrank--Yes, there is.

If people have to pay 5/- for a telegram or take the trouble to write and post a letter, they think twice before they bother you at all. If they have a telephone, however, even the most trivial information takes on urgency. The telephone dispenses irrelevance like a tap which won't turn off; it is also a dangerous instrument of interference and even persecution; but like most other so-called amenities of modern life, the telephone is essential for dealing with complexities which the telephone itself has caused, and it is quick to assert its tyranny at the expense of those who, like myself, would ignore it.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Airport Novel\n", "completion": " I have been thinking about writing a big fat paperback, one of those novels disdained by the so-called literary world yet which sell in mighty amounts, often from airport bookstalls. Due to some sort of cultural blip, business persons who jet around the world being obnoxious still like to be seen reading something other than their latest sales reports, and the airport novel is a form created especially for them. It is never less than 736 pages long, and will usually have the title picked out in embossed gold on the cover. The contents will invariably be world-shuddering--a plot to destabilise NATO, for example--and militaristic, technological and \"intelligence\" matters will be described in preposterous detail. The film rights will have been sold before publication, but the film itself, if it is ever made, will never get a theatrical release. The hero's name will often be Graham Maitland. I had been toying with the idea of making mine a Vatican-related thriller called Pontiff! but was disappointed to discover that that title has already been taken. No matter. The point is that readers of these novels rarely get beyond page 243.

He has somehow managed to continue his subterfuge from beyond the grave, which is some feat, as I am sure you can appreciate. But it was ever thus. Four days after his death, a balaclava-clad farmyard person swore an affidavit before a provincial solicitor that he had seen Dobson squatting behind his pig hut, scribbling notes into a ledger, but that when he--the farmyard person--returned with cronies, to accost the wraith, \"Dobson\", if it was he, had vanished, leaving only a toothpaste tube from which much of the paste had already been eked, and a sinister plasticine duck, possibly intended to be a bufflehead, the head of which was squashed by the farmyard person's mastiff, by accident.

The interview process was exhausting, possibly because our recruitment advert, by some mishap, appeared in Bee People magazine instead of Jobs For The Bird-Obsessed, our publication of choice. That misunderstanding dealt with, we questioned what in the name of heaven had persuaded us to hold the selection process in the annexe of a House Of Sortilege & Magick hard by the banks of a tempestuous river on the point of bursting its banks, fourteen miles from the nearest railway station. We eventually appointed Jim Pond, a man with a blue hat and dozens of library tickets, who suggested that his first contribution ought to be some birdsongs: the lapwing, the curlew, and quite alarmingly, the carrion crow. Jim has now gone off to join the Richard Milhous Nixon Memorial Sweatlodge, and it is unclear if he is ever coming back.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Soup, Lists, Rand\n", "completion": " Over at Think Of England, Brit has a list of things worthy of disparagement (or \"meh\", as he puts it). It is a fine list, by and large, although I was not the only commenter to question his inclusion of \"most soups\". Obviously the poor fellow is brainsick, at least in that part of the cranium evolution has designed for soup appreciation. Perhaps his family and pals can rally round and organise an \"intervention\". It may be his only hope.\nHis list, however, reminded me of one of my favourite books, The Chatto Book Of Cabbages And Kings : Lists In Literature, edited by Francis Spufford. Looking it up on Amazon to find out if it is still available--it is, of course--I noted that, with splendid serendipity, it was published exactly twenty years ago today. An anniversary not quite as thrilling as the becrumblement of the Berlin Wall, but nevertheless one worth marking. So my thanks to Brit for making me think about lists.\nOn the other hand, I have absolutely no idea what has brought Ayn Rand swimming into my head over the last few days. I have mentioned her here, and in my comment at Think Of England, which might give readers the impression that I am somehow obsessed. It is true that I continue to work tirelessly at my monograph A Startling Number Of Anagrams Of 'Ayn Rand', which I am hoping to finish during the next decade. But other than that, the most interesting thing about the bonkers Objectivist is that she was a very keen stamp collector. I drew readers' attention to this some years ago, but may as well do so again for those of you who do not spend your every waking hour trawling through the Hooting Yard Archives. While others may claim The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged as Ayn Rand's greatest work, you and I know that she never surpassed her classic Why I Like Stamp Collecting.\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "Soup From The Carpathians\n", "completion": " Carpathian thick potato and sausage soup is a delicious soup from the Carpathians, perfect for those long winter evenings as darkness falls and the temperature plummets and a chill sets in to your bones. It is very simple to make. Basically, you just boil up a pan of potatoes and sausages and add a suitable coagulant. When it is thick enough for your iron spoon to stand up in it unsupported, tip the whole lot into a bowl and garnish with the horns of a goat or two, for added crunch.\nIn the past, entire Carpathian families lived off this soup for years on end. It is true that in some cases they suffered from nutritional... difficulties, and had many ructions with the Carpathian goat-herding community, but we live in a different age, and can put such unpleasantness behind us. There is no benefit whatsoever in reviving ancient Carpathian blood feuds, although of course to do so can enliven an otherwise dull week.\nIf you are worried by the prospect of a gang of Carpathian peasants hoving into view armed with flaming torches and pitchforks, call our helpline. Our staff have been fully--well, adequately--trained in Carpathian thick potato and sausage soup dispute resolution techniques, and will not hang up if they hear you screaming for mercy.\n###"}

During the unfortunate technical trauma that closed down Hooting Yard for a couple of weeks, a friend reminded me that I had got myself into a similar tizz some years ago. My bugbear then was that the Booker Prize shortlist always seemed to be limited to novels with pompous, portentous titles like The Redundancy of Courage--was that by Timothy Mo? (I could check, but I really, really can't be bothered.) Titles, in any case, which announced: \"This is a serious work. It may be ill-written, tedious, and simple-minded, but it addresses big themes. This is literature.\" My plan at the time--never fulfilled, alas, but you know how it is--was to write a thumping great tome entitled The Consistency of Porridge. I may still do so.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Knud Padde\n", "completion": " In Forbrydelsen, the 2007 Danish TV crime thriller known here as The Killing, there was a minor character, appearing in just three of the twenty episodes, named Knud Padde. I confess that I have forgotten pretty much everything about the character but for his name--but what a name! Knud Padde ought, surely, to have his own spin-off series.\nI can imagine him, dapper in his Danish duds, as one of the Four Norsemen of the Apocalypse, alongside Lars and Bengt and Erik, a quartet of impossibly sophisticated Scandinavians, noble of brow and fond of herring. I am assuming, of course, that \"Norsemen\" can refer to any old Scandinavian, not exclusively those from Norway, though if we had to export Knud Padde and his fellows to Norway then so be it.\nWe could, after all, put them on the banks of a fjord. What would the Apocalypse look like, viewed from a fjord? I asked fjord- and Apocalypse-expert Tarleton Buchbinder for his thoughts. He never called me back. I think he was taking a very long bath, in his tub, listening to a cassette tape of inspirational speeches by Patricia Fripp, sister of the guitarist Robert, husband of popstrel Toyah Wilcox.\nToyah's big hit was \"It'th A Mythtery\", and I think the Knud Padde TV series ought to have a mystery element. The mystery could be some unspoken horror in Knud Padde's past, or in Lars's past, or Bengt's past, or Erik's past, or perhaps in the pasts of all four of them, the unspoken horror that brought the four of them together in the first place, on the banks of a fjord, in a high and icy wind, noble of brow and fond of herring.\nThis needs work.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Replica Eden\n", "completion": " Cardboard Adam stands hand in hand with cardboard Eve in front of a cardboard tree around which is twined a serpent of plasticine. Plasticine, too, are the fruits which hang from the cardboard branches of the tree. In truth, cardboard Adam and cardboard Eve are not so much holding hands as sharing a single hand between them, for they have been cut from a single sheet of cardboard. Cardboard Adam's other hand is a plain cardboard hand, but to cardboard Eve's other hand is stuck a glob of plasticine. It is not perfectly spherical, for a chunk has been taken from it. The suggestion is that cardboard Eve has bitten the chunk out of the plasticine fruit. Tiny glittering beads are sunk in the head of the plasticine serpent, and they give the impression that they are gazing at Eve's cardboard hand.\nThere is a little motor attached by wires to the balsa wood panel upon which cardboard Adam and cardboard Eve are posed. Depressing a knob on the motor switches it on and causes the panel, and thus the cardboard figures, to tremble. Their trembling is redolent of the terror they experience when the Lord informs them of their Fall.\nOver on the draining board, a third cardboard figure is lying flat. It has been daubed with a blotch of crimson paint, and punctured with a toothpick. This is cardboard Abel. Cardboard Cain has been chucked into a patch of filth out in the gutter, representing the Land of Nod.\nIt took me two years to make my replica Eden, or Eden and Nod. It was time well spent. I am now going to use my leftover cardboard and plasticine to make a model of Pointy Town pier, including the bats and the goats and the crocus.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Erasmus Stribbling Trout Shue's Diary 23.1.97\n", "completion": " A diary from Greenbrier County, West Virginia, this day in 1897:\nToday I murdered my wife. I mashed her windpipe and broke her neck, which might seem an overreaction to the fact that she had not cooked any meat for my dinner, but then, as my first wife would tell you, I am a cruel and horrible and violent man. My second wife would probably say the same, had she not died in mysterious circumstances shortly after our marriage. Zona, who I killed today, was my third wife. I hope to have seven eventually.\nI won't get a chance to marry a further four wives if I am hanged or imprisoned for murder. So I took various steps to cover my tracks. I laid Zona out on the bed and dressed her in a high-necked dress with a stiff collar, and placed a veil over her face. When Dr Knapp arrived to examine the corpse, I sobbed and wailed and cradled Zona's head in my hands. That did the trick, and he did not inspect her too closely, noting that death was due to \"everlasting faint\".\nSo everything went according to plan and I seem to be in the clear, free to find a fourth wife to terrorise and/or kill. The worst that could happen is that Zona might appear as a ghost, to her grieving mother, and spill the beans, and prove that I broke her neck by rotating her ghostly head in a full circle atop her ghostly body. But even if she does, repeatedly, over four nights, and Zona's mother goes babbling her tale, an American court of law in the enlightened 1890s is not going to accept the testimony of a ghost.

Further darkening of the cake can be accomplished by rubbing into it charcoal or play-soot.\nNow empty the contents of a sachet of cuppasoup into a bowl. I know it is called cuppasoup, not bowlasoup, but just do as I advise. You can choose whatever flavour of soup you desire, but do ensure that it is one heavy with croutons. In fact, however many croutons are present in the sachet, add further croutons. If you do not have access to a supply of croutons, obtain something hard, like a block of wood or an empacture of dried-up mud, and cut it into tiny crouton-sized cubes.\nBoil a kettle. Pour the boiled water into the bowl, sufficient to cover the powdered cuppasoup and the croutons and the added croutons. Remove the darkened sponge cake from the shadows, and crumble it into the soup.\nStir and allow to sit undisturbed on a counter until cold. Protect it from the depredations of domestic pets, creeping vermin, and wild animals by surrounding the bowl with electrified chickenwire.\nFor serving, pour the soup out of the bowl into an upturned potter's cap, and use as a source of dunkage for digestive and other biscuits.

{"prompt": "Pudding Flaps\n", "completion": " A while ago I wrote about hiking pickles, and today I want to address the equally important topic of pudding flaps. Flaps about pudding are rarer than they once were, chiefly because puddings play a less critical role in our diets than used to be the case. Time was when no meal was innocent of a pudding, and though of course not every pudding preparation was the occasion of a flap, the incidence of such flaps was obviously more frequent. One or two psychoculinary statisticians have attempted to put a precise figure on the occurrence of pudding flaps, and one feels pity for them, pity mixed with mocking laughter. Sooner or later, I think, we are going to have to accept that we will never know how often the making of a pudding was done in a state of flap, certainly not to a statistically significant extent.\nThe implications of this are, of course, that I may be able to say nothing pertinent about pudding flaps save for what I have already said, that they used to be more common than they are in the gilded paradise we live in today. And it is a sort of Eden, as we zoom around the glistening metropolis in bendy hoverbuses, primping our bouffants with space-age preening tweezers, scanning the electronic information silos for the latest diktats from our Supreme Leader, the Great Helmswoman Hazel Blears, plugging our pods into hubs, enduring cataclysmic hailstorms with undiminished joie de vivre, and taking our state-provided One-Pig-Per-Person-Policy pig for a brisk walk through the concrete underpasses below the boulevards. Yet some say it is a fool's paradise, and they may be right. Perhaps there is a deep, primeval human need to get into a flap when preparing a pudding, whether it is a pudding of suet or of plums or of greasy slops. Our loss of those flaps, at least in our daily lives, has cost us dear.\n###"}

Their eyes are glued to their fishtank in which brightly-coloured tropical finned things swim about listlessly in water. Her neighbours have taken against the hoyden and have determined to break her hedge.

And I think one thing I have tended to neglect is drawing readers' attention to particularly splendid items I find elsewhere on the net--such as this piece about the Mundaneum.\nI am hoping that the idea of a Daily Hooting Yard does not crumble to dust by, oh, about the third or fourth of January, so bear in mind that suggestions and contributions are always welcome from readers, either in the Comments or directly to hooting.yard@googlemail.com\nMeanwhile, go and listen to Jubilate Agno again. It is \"strangely mesmeric\" according to one correspondent, who tells me he has so far listened to it, all the way through, four times. Very sensible man.\n###"}

I am thinking of the phrase batshit crazy. We do not commonly say, for example, catshit crazy or giraffeshit crazy or puff-addershit crazy, or at least I have not heard these phrases used at the sort of swish sophisticated cocktail parties I try to barge my way into. But reference to the droppings of bats is made frequently.\nAnswers in the Comments please, unless you are batshit crazy yourself, in which case you would be more appropriately occupied reading something by Will Self.\n###"}
{"prompt": "In Foff\n", "completion": " In Foff lay patches of glue strewn higgledy. Tarps billowed in a gale that was never a zephyr. There's a hole in my bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza. Crack out the canisters of Strontium 90.\nSo, at any rate, says weedy poet Dennis Beerpint in his new book, Gibberish From An Unalloyed Nitwit. Interviewed by a scribbler next to a filbert hedge, the poet was at pains to punctuate his prattle with words beginning with P. But the scribbler's tape recorder malfunctioned, so all record of what Beerpint said is lost, as lost as a flea in a jerrycan.\nWhat we might want to know is where Foff lies, and whether there are fleas there. On the other hand, armed with an early morning pint of milk and a copy of The Daily Hammer Of Christ, we might prefer to stroll out to where the steamrollers wheeze in the dawn light, as milky as the milk in our carton, and sing wassailing songs of long ago penned by intoxicated German Fafnirs.\nBeerpint's bucket did not have a hole in it. In Foff, it rested on a shelf in his shed. His shed was precisely twenty times the size of his head. That is how you measure sheds, and huts, and cabins, and kiosks. Look at them all lined up, ordered by size, in multiples of Beerpint head measurement. Now watch as they are flattened by steamrollers.\nNow dip your fingers in those patches of glue. It is glue that will hold things together.\n###"}

I know not how other people's nerves are constructed; but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse materials, to stand the shock of such a horrid assault. It was, indeed, a compound of villainous smells, in which the most violent stinks, and the most powerful perfumes, contended for the mastery. Imagine to yourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours, arising from putrid gums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies, rank arm-pits, sweating feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments, and embrocations, Hungary-water, spirit of lavender, asafoetida drops, musk, hartshorn, and sal volatile; besides a thousand frowsy steams, which I could not analyse.

{"prompt": "Wurlitzer News\n", "completion": " This brief rummage through the Hooting Yard postbag ends with the following, from reader Peter Ross:\nWhile in Norfolk we went to something called 'The Village Experience'. It was like a League of Gentlemen version of Legoland. Each of the so called rides, which only functioned every hour or so, was attended by a humpbacked man with a limp. There was also a large shed containing a Wurlitzer collection where we managed to catch a concert performed by a slightly odd teenager. The whole place looked like it had been built in the 1960s and never updated. In fact it would not have surprised me if the whole thing had been brought over from Plovdiv. Don't know why I have told you this, except that it had a certain Hooting Yard quality about it. Sadly the place is closing down in September.\n###"}

{"prompt": "B Is for Blodgett\n", "completion": " Episode two in our daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet\nBlodgett had been at the House since infancy. He was dyspeptic and cruel. Like Madame Rousseau, he had never learned to tell the time and rarely knew what day of the week it was. This was surprising for a man in his position, charged as he was with running the lower floors of the House. His bailiwick included the frightening rooms on the first floor, the whole of the ground floor, the cellars and underground passages (except for the secret ones), and various ill-defined sections of the grounds, possibly including the boneyards, the engine room, and the pointless hut.\nThe arrival of Aminadab dismayed him. He had not been told what on earth to do with this lopsided person, which meant he would have to seek instructions from Doctor Cack or one of his cronies. He could barely bring himself to speak to them, with their supercilious manners, spotless frock-coats, and knot-tying expertise. Blodgett's blood boiled. Without bothering to tell Aminadab where he was going, he shoved the trap for flying insect beings back in the kitchen drawer, slammed the door shut behind him, and headed off for Doctor Cack's headquarters.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Amis Cat\n", "completion": " This is probably the most accurate observation of a cat in world literature:\nVictor was a blue-point Siamese, a neutered tom-cat now in the third year of his age. He entered, as usual, in vague semi-flight, as from something that was probably not a menace, but which it was as well to be on the safe side about. Becoming aware of me, he approached, again as usual, with an air of uncertainty not so much about who I was as about what I was, and of keeping a very open mind on the range of possible answers. Was I potassium nitrate, or next October twelvemonth, or Christianity, or a chess problem--perhaps involving a variation on the Falkbeer counter-gambit? When he reached me, he gave up the problem and toppled on to my feet like an elephant pierced by a bullet in some vital spot. Victor was, among other things, the reason why no dogs were allowed at the Green Man. The effort of categorizing them might have proved too much for him.\nfrom The Green Man by Kingsley Amis (1969)\n###"}

The gist of Tim's scribbled note was that the illustration of a starling only showed a side view. What, he asks, does the other side look like? This seems at first to be a fatuous question, but perhaps Tim is on to something. Here is the other side of a starling:\n\n* NOTE : The postman who delivered Tim's letter was not The Postman, as played by Kevin Costner in that foolish, foolish film, although there are times when, looking out of the window, one could be forgiven for thinking that a nuclear holocaust had already happened..\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dabbling In Ducks' Blood\n", "completion": " \nDennis Beerpint's majestic poem Two Monks Took The Blood Of A Duck is the subject of Key's Cupboard in The Dabbler this week. Elderly Hooting Yard readers will know that the title is taken from Alfred Wesley Wishart's A Short History Of Monks And Monasteries (1900), wherein we also learn--in the same brief quotation--that St Ursula had three heads. She is one of the very few Catholic saints to have more than  one head, a fact which becomes blindingly clear if you tot up the number of saints and then count the number of saints' heads. The two numbers almost match, but however many times you do the calculation you will always find slightly more saints' heads than saints.\nIn their girlhood, both of my sisters attended an Ursuline Convent School, and I asked them if the three-headed nature of their dedicatory saint had any decisive influence on the school's ethos.\n\"No,\" they said, \"Don't be such a nitwit.\"\nMy sisters have one head each.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dripping Trellis\n", "completion": " Last night I dreamed I went to Dripping Trellis again. Dripping Trellis, where fresh raindrops dripped from the trellises in its many gardens. Dripping Trellis, where we woke each dawn to the clink of the milkman's bottles, and his morning song, that odd, strangulated keening, the words never quite decipherable. Dripping Trellis, through which in the afternoons the mobile library would putter, before parking by a dripping trellis, and we would return our books, overdue, overdue, and damp from lying unread on lawns in summer rainfall. It was the bucolic hamlet of my infancy, where I lived until the age of six. It is a deluded memory. There is not a grain of truth in it.\nIn my dream I was skipping and gambolling across a lawn, a huge lawn, in a garden rife with peewits and starlings and lupins and hollyhocks and Vietcong. The milkman was there, with much milk, but the milk was pink and gold, like the sky at sunset. He was singing, and the mobile librarian was accompanying him on sackbut. There may have been elves. I pranced towards a grot and peered within, and saw lanterns, and caged birds, and my papa. Then tish tosh tish tosh Blunkett of Jago's Peak. Raindrops dripped off the thousands of trellises in Dripping Trellis. A man with a klaxon made an announcement about a wolf, and waved a flag, and I knew, though I did not see, that the flag had been darned by a convict in a distant pompous land. I had toast and marmalade. There was a Nissen hut, and on its roof perched an owl, and the owl hooted, and I awoke.\nOutside, the rain was pouring down, and a bitter wind was howling across the desolate expanse of cement and concrete and tar where I was born, where I have always lived, where there is not a single trellis from which the raindrops may drip.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Fuming Binder\n", "completion": " We have seen how a comment comparing one of his symphonies to a pimple made Binder fume. In truth, the composer was much given to fuming. He fumed in circumstances where others, of a less choleric disposition, might simply tut or mumble or shrug. Nobody ever actually saw steam coming out of Binder's ears, but he was invariably portrayed thus by cartoonists and by the more scurrilous painters of his day. Binder was a favourite subject of portraitists of all stripes, because he had such an extraordinary head. Words cannot quite capture its phantasmal oddity. And yet he was deemed the most handsome of composers by his admirers of both sexes, who were legion. Queues used to form at his dressing-room door whenever he deigned to appear at a concert hall, conducting one of his own works and a squib by an inferior for contrast. Even when fawned over, Binder fumed. He could occasionally be placated by marzipan treats, but not very often.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Infant Moralist\n", "completion": " Reader Kimika Ying has unearthed a treasure from the past.\n\nDear Mr. Key, she writes, I've found a book which put me in mind of Hooting Yard which I would like to pass along, \"The Infant Moralist\" by Lady Helena Carnegie and Mrs. Arthur Jacob, published in 1903. Public domain versions of the book, with a delightfully illustrated copy of the original, are located here\nIt contains some of the usual moral lessons on \"The Consequences of Greed\", \"Profanity\", \"Envy\", \"Courage\", etc. What caught my attention were the less commonly heard ones: \"Insensate Mischief\", \"Inevitable Retribution\", \"Unsuitable Jesting\", and \"Ill-Timed Levity\".\nAnd this:\nTHE CHATTERBOX\nI needs must beg you, Caroline,\nTo cease your Chatter whilst I dine.\nIt deafens every Ear.\nJohn Footman cannot hear my Words,\nAnd I have asked him twice for Curds\nAnd still he cannot hear.\nIf Caroline were with us today she would undoubtedly have a cell phone out at the dinner table as well.

The pipes, the pipes are calling. The Nazis, too, now, are muddle-headed, and they follow the dulcet tooting of the pipes, like children following the Pied Piper of Hamelin.\nBroadsword is safe from the Nazis for the time being. He packs up his radio transmitter and hoists it on his back and carries it down, down, to a janitorial shed near the railway tracks. Above, in the blue, blue sky, an eagle swoops. The eagle is neither Broadsword nor Danny Boy. It is an eagle with no name, just as in America, far from the Tyrol, there is a horse with no name, just as, here, coming into the janitorial shed, to join Broadsword, is the Man with No Name.\nLater there will be much gunfire.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dobson in Residence\n", "completion": " One of the more arresting facts about Dobson is that he spent a five-year period living in an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. Such was the hold on him of this location that he devoted no less than sixteen pamphlets to it. According to the statistician Aloysius Nestingbird, Dobson wrote more words about this factory than on any other topic. What was it about the place that exerted such a fascination upon Dobson? How significant is it that, during his stay there, the factory was still functioning, producing thousands of tins of evaporated milk every week, and not, as it is today, an abandoned ruin populated only by screeching birds? Was the workforce aware that the pamphleteer had taken up residence in an unused room on the mezzanine floor, and that he had attached his own design of bolts and latches to the door to prevent his being disturbed? Or that the carefully-lettered sign on the door, reading \"S Q Perkins, Janitorial Padre\", was a fake of Dobson's devising? Was Dobson responsible for the occasional small theft of a few tins of evaporated milk noted in a big ledger by the management's security team? Was it really necessary for the security team to march about the premises in gangs of four, dressed in uniforms not unlike those of a fascist junta, accompanied by howling, slavering dogs, each as tall as a ten-year-old? Were the dogs skittish when taken to their kennels at the end of a security tour? Did a wet-behind-the-ears junior evaporated milk technical consultant take the rap for the missing tins? Was he dismissed and did he have his epaulettes thrown into the shredder? What in the name of heaven was Dobson doing in that room for five years? Why are the answers to these cogent questions entirely absent from Dobson's pamphlets? And, most importantly, what birds screech there now?\n###"}

{"prompt": "From The 20th Century\n", "completion": " \nIn my cupboard in yesterday's Dabbler I resurrected some prose from the last century. The twelve potted biographies you will find there served originally as the texts accompanying illustrations for the 1993 Hooting Yard Calendar, entitled The Golden Age Of Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre. (One of the illustrations is reproduced for The Dabbler.)\nI revisited some even earlier prose in a dream last night. When I was about fifteen years old I wrote a dreadful surrealist(ish) play-of-sorts called The Shepherd Of Amsterdam. The text no longer survives, long ago consumed by fire or eaten by worms. Last night it returned to haunt me in my sleep. I was in charge of putting on a stage production of the work, due to begin in fifteen minutes in spite of the fact that no rehearsals had taken place and the actors were wholly unfamiliar with the play. Indeed, there was only the single copy of the text in my possession, which I belatedly thought to photocopy. I was heading to the library for that purpose when I was told that the soundtrack CD of the play--produced by a walrus-moustachioed impresario who, I was assured, was \"a big fan of Hooting Yard\"--featuring music by Verdi and Monteverdi, was ready, awaiting only the addition of the actors performing the words.\nThen I woke up.\n###"}

I am beset by a case of diabetic retinopathy--plus a Roth spot--and my eyesight is, quite frankly, pitiable.

Hence the lack of sweeping paragraphs of majestic etc etc.\nBut all is not lost! I shall shortly be commencing a series of monthly appointments at the exciting-sounding Tuesday Injection Clinic in the ophthalmic department of my local hospital. The Key eyes will be jabbed with needles each month until such time as my sight returns to normal--normal, for me of course, meaning myopic, akin to a mole, but much better than it is now.\nIn the meantime I will try to post here when able, and I look forward to resuming normal service before too long.\n###"}

This had come to light very early in his days at the House, so long ago that no one--not even Blodgett--could recall precisely what had happened. There were occasional mutterings about a cravat and a thunderstorm, but nothing of substance.\nWhen Doctor Cack had arrived with his hideously food-splattered entourage, Jubble had ingratiated himself immediately. He helped the tuberologists to move into the Leaking Building, tirelessly destroying with his bazooka the piles of accumulated waste materials that had been stored there. He hung their hats up to dry after rainfall. He sharpened their pencils. There were other kindnesses.\nWithin weeks, Doctor Cack had formally pronounced him as a bona fide assistant potato person. Jubble busied himself researching powdery scab, wireworm and spraing. He worked hard, and Doctor Cack began to trust him with the more outre aspects of potato science. But as the years passed, Jubble became ever more unhinged.\nHe was often to be found in uproarious carousal with Euwige, the two of them pouring vast quantities of dandelion and burdock down their throats and singing inhuman songs. His moustache grew outlandish, and was forever smeared with lemon curd and other, sinister curds. He wore hawthorns in his hair, and carried tiny abominable homunculi in the pockets of his mackintosh. Doctor Cack had to have words with him on this score, for the potato scientist was not a man to tolerate orthodox raincoats.\n###"}

Sometimes, after an injection, I have a Black Spot in my eye for a day or two, and sometimes not. The first time this happened it was mightily disconcerting.

Imagine for a moment that there existed a dimwitted action-packed film, filled with CGI explosions and the like, in the spirit of, say, Alien vs. Predator, but in this instance called Babinsky vs. The Grunty Man. Clearly the moviegoing hordes would be queueing up at multiplexes across the land to lose themselves for two and a half hours in such a spectacle. So why has Mr Key not yet had a call from a Hollywood mogul? It is, as I say, an enduring mystery.\nI am sure, too, that a film entitled Tiny Enid : Plucky Tot could spawn an endless string of sequels. Come on, Hollywood!

Realistic details are combined with a larger naivety about space that wouldn't be out of place in Dan Dare, and there are moments whose sheer weirdness compares with the work of proto-surrealist Raymond Roussel: when, for example, the insects [a breed of hyper-intelligent insects who buzz around like bees and give telepathic orders] show them black and white films of great moments in human history, and\n\"the bee-beetles who controlled the machine again pressed the lever; again the machine whirred and the words came, 'Music while you work', followed by the rumba.\"\nWheatley never attempted science fiction again.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Spangles Reference Library\n", "completion": " The reference library in Spangles, mentioned in today's instalment of the enthralling serial Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars, is, as far as I know, the only library in the world to hold a complete run of Dobson's short-lived periodical A Lantern In The Pit. The Lantern, as it was known, was a bold attempt to shed Dobsonian light on various intractable questions, chiefly of a philosophical bent. For some unknown reason, the pamphleteer-turned-journalist chose to compose most of the contents in a so-called ur-lingua of his own devising. He provided no translations, and all the papers relating to what he hoped would become a new universal language were destroyed in the Potato Building fire. We are left with seven fat issues of the magazine, densely packed with text which is--and, one assumes, will remain--devoid of meaning. Various cryptographers have at one time or another tried to crack Dobson's code, but most of them have given up when they discovered that no one would pay them. Here is a mercifully brief extract, from Volume 2, Number 1:\nAck spun dig hod bulk frag mint. Shog nit pan get hole tap pote. Rag snout cot bag hag ack ack tix. Nod goo pin pan sap tot foo.

Although the location of each larder seemed random--two adjacent here, another just down the corridor and around the corner, one tiny, solitary larder in the west wing--in fact they were distributed according to a system so stupendous and abstruse that only Mrs Purgative understood it. Blodgett claimed to, and no one was confident enough of their own knowledge to challenge him.\nAminadab, having arrived at the House only hours before, was unaware that there was even a system in the first place. All he knew for certain was that he was slumped, queasy with exhaustion, on the floor of a larder stacked floor to ceiling with soup tins marked \"Number Three\". He had given up the quest for Euwige. Half his luggage had been abandoned somewhere back in an ill-lit corridor which stank of porridge, though there was no porridge to be found in it. He still had the other half of his belongings with him, and was rummaging frantically in one of his satchels for the bag of gob-stoppers he had packed at the start of his journey, three weeks ago.\nAs his trembling fingers lit at last upon the crumpled bag, he heard footsteps approaching.

{"prompt": "Ringer Sedgeweg Again, Again\n", "completion": " It's been a twelvemonth since we heard hide or hair of Sedgeweg, the Tewkeston ringer. Much has happened. The Tuppers posted bail, and the ringer himself was seen scratching in limepits. Every so often he'd lift a find to the light and toss it to one side. He'd have to rent a cart or barrow, and that was where the Tuppers came in. They always had something with wheels to hand, they took pride in that, if in nought else. Sedgeweg had his shovel and a broom. Lord knows where he got them from, they were bent and battered, as if they'd been used to bash heads in. But Sedgeweg wasn't a man given to lifting a finger in fury. He'd popped enough caps in his time, didn't have to anymore, didn't want to, couldn't see the point. He still spent time with otters, by the riverbank, even when he was on his uppers. A collapsed lung was on the cards, the way he was going. The physio kept giving him sideways glances and making new appointments for him. It was quite a clinic he had there, white and bold and with a lawn outside with swings and a seesaw. Tupper money, some said, in whispers, on their punts. Wheels within wheels, that was another thing you heard, in those days. It was just punter babble, though. The ringer hardly heard it, he had his scratching to keep him busy. Go and see him at the limepits one day, he'd like that. He's a generous and open-hearted man and he'll share his flask with you likely as not. It always has something hot in it, with not much milk. Sedgeweg has a complicated theory about milk and calcium and bones, not any bones but his own bones. It doesn't make any sense, but it becalms him at times when he might go all funny and shaky. He can't count anymore. He has to get a Tupper to count the otters now. It's come to that.\n###"}

Their recollections have been anthologised in a new book, entitled Smooching With Istvan, in which they reminisce about their smooching. One of those whose memories are not included is alleged Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, who is known to have smooched with Istvan in a Fort Worth, Texas nightclub early in 1963, soon after his return from the Soviet Union. His, there, refers to Oswald, not Istvan, although Istvan had himself visited the USSR (or, in Cyrillic, the CCCP) on many occasions, smooching with Olga, Natasha, Yuri, Boris and Svetlana, among others.\nIt has to be said that most of these tales are mundane, boring, even unreadable.

{"prompt": "Marching This Way And That\n", "completion": " In his later years, Rayner Heppenstall described himself as a \"freelance reactionary\". Here is his amusing capsule summary of les evenements of 1968, from The Sex War And Others : A Survey Of Recent Murder, Principally In France (1973):\n\"Paris always had the best riots. Those of May 1968 marked the clear emergence of a new criminal class, that of the Western World's countless superfluous undergraduates. Our own welfare kids had done a fair amount of marching this way and that and shouting 'Fascist!'. This word they had no doubt picked up from their Left-wing parents, for none of them had been born when fascism ended at least in Western Europe. One kind of seasonal marching had ended when the actress Vanessa Redgrave decided, doubtless on doctor's orders, to stop planting her fair bottom on the cold stones of Trafalgar Square. The French students had heard of Freud and Marx, whose names had bored Britons of my generation to a state verging on hysteria before the war but had somehow skipped Paris, where they had their own anarchist tradition. In Regis Debray, they had a little Che Guevara of their own, and for some reason they had paid more attention than our own young to the government-organised wrecking or cultural revolution in China the previous year...\n\"At least on the routes of marches, public lavatory attendants get a chance to start cleaning up as soon as the procession has passed, while in general Pop fans congregate in the open air, so that the dead grass can afterwards be sprayed. The Paris undergraduates blocked up the drains in theatres and university buildings until the stench became too much even for them. Then they moved out and left it all to the cleaners and decorators. Even now atavistically respectful of the plumbing, German and Anglo-Saxon undergraduates also occupied fine premises, but in smaller numbers and for shorter periods.\"\n###"}
{"prompt": "Head To Head\n", "completion": " Barring cancellations or hissy fits, next week will see the first of Hooting Yard's new Public Seminars where matters of great import will be debated by a mix of experts, intellectuals, charlatans, rascals, and persons of fecklessness.\nThe topic of our first debate is Life Beyond Death, and will be an exciting head-to-head pitting the enormously wealthy best-selling author Deepak Chopra against Hooting Yard's very own Little Severin, The Mystic Badger. Mr Chopra will argue that he has spiritual insights into life after death, based on his rigorous and expert understanding of quantum physics. Little Severin will scrubble about in the undergrowth and snuffle the air in his mystic way, thus proving a worthy opponent. Claims that the debate is weighted too heavily in Mr Chopra's favour can be summarily disposed of. Little Severin knows just as much about quantum physics as his human opponent, if not more so, and to suggest that the badger will be outwitted is plain wrong. You'll see.\nThe debate will take place in a tent in the middle of a field near Sawdust Bridge. Tickets to see Little Severin are free, but unfortunately you will have to pay through the nose to see Mr Chopra's segment, for so high a spiritual plane has he reached through use of Transcendental Meditation and other techniques that it takes an enormous cashflow to keep him bobbing up there in the mystic aether.

{"prompt": "A New Musical\n", "completion": " \nYou can learn many things by watching the Eurovision Song Contest. I noted some of them the other day at The Dabbler, but here I wish to confess that it was only when watching Eurovision that I learned to pronounce Malmo correctly. I had always thought that the final o rhymed with dough. Now I know that it is more accurately a sort of er or uh sound.\nThis new knowledge led me, by ways I will not bother to explain, to devise a plan for an exciting piece of musical theatre. Now, I have not studied the life and times of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi with any great diligence, nor indeed with any diligence at all. What I know of the late tyrant was picked up from news reports--print and broadcast--over the years. So I have no idea whether he ever paid a visit to Sweden. If he did not, it does not matter, for my musical can be wholly fictional.\nThe basic premise of my all-singing all-dancing show is that Gaddafi, on a visit to Sweden's southern capital, is presented by the good burghers of Malmo with an offering of myrrh. I realise this has connotations of the baby Jesus being presented with myrrh--plus gold and frankincense--by the three Kings of Orion-Tar, and that as a result my show might be accused of blasphemy. Well, bring it on!, as they say. We are all aware that blasphemy is a splendid way to drum up publicity. And Christian blasphemy is nice and safe, and wins plaudits for being \"edgy\" from the Guardian, unlike blasphemy against Islam, which gets you blown up or beheaded and accused of being racist by the Guardian.\nThe main--the only--reason I have devised this show, however, is as a pretext for the title Muammar's Malmo Myrrh. That has a pleasing ring, does it not? The great thing about it is that, however clearly and resoundingly you try to enunciate the words, you still sound like a toothless inarticulate wretch.\n###"}

Trying to remove the beetle only pushed it in further. The beetle continued into Speke's ear as far as possible, and then \"he began with exceeding vigour like a rabbit in a hole, to dig violently away at my tympanum. The queer sensation this amusing measure excited in me is past description . . . What to do I knew not.\" After trying to flush the critter out with melted butter, Speke tried to dig it out with his penknife, succeeding only in killing it and increasing the damage to his ear. Infection followed, distorting his face and causing boils. \"For many months the tumour made me almost deaf, and ate a hole between the ear and the nose, so that when I blew it, my ear whistled so audibly that those who heard it laughed. Six or seven months after this accident happened, bits of the beetle--a leg, a wing, or parts of the body--came away in the wax.\"\n(Quotes are from Speke's journals, as referred to in Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton by Edward Rice, 1990, Scribner's, New York.)\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Huffington Post\n", "completion": " Whenever bumpkins gather of an evening in the shack at the end of the lane, sooner or later their talk will turn to the Huffington Post. It is not uncommon for the peasantry to fixate upon minutiae, of course. We think of Old Farmer Frack, obsessed with his bellowing cows, or the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge, or any number of pig-related outbreaks of countryside mass hysteria, often focussed upon something as insignificant as the shape of a newborn pig's snout or trotters. Yet the bumpkins' preoccupation with the Huffington Post was curious, for to the untrained eye it looked like any other fencepost or stake or piece of paling. I dare say you or I would pass by that post without giving it a glance, and the prattle of the bumpkins of an evening in the shack at the end of the lane would sound to us nonsensical. But rustic wisdom is hard won, and only a fool would dismiss the bumpkins' shack chatter as drivel.\nOn a balmy evening one such fool blundered into the shack at the end of the lane and, hearing the bumpkins bandying the profundities of Huffington Post lore, took it for the idiocy of defectives. With his briefcase and bowler hat it was clear the fool dwelt in a city. Clear, too, that he could not tell the Huffington Post from any other posts and stakes and pales thumped into the muck for fencing the fields. His manner and his smirks were disparaging of the bumpkins, and when he left the shack and was making his way to the railway station, they waylaid him and carried him off to the eerie barn at Scroonhoonpooge.

During the Wimbledon tennis championships, I forget which game exactly though it may have been one of the men's semi-finals, during one of the breaks between sets, the BBC cameras drifted off to the surrounding scene, and showed a jetty by the river around which sunbathers sprawled. Also present was a swan, approached by a tiny tot who looked as if she was wanting to feed it a sandwich. The proximity of tot to swan led one of the commentary team to observe that, belying their elegance and grace, swans are of course savage and aggressive creatures. Whereupon fellow-commentator Tim Henman--whose surname suggests he knows a thing or two about birds, or at least about poultry--said (and I paraphrase from memory):\nWhenever you see a swan, someone always points out that they are capable of breaking your arm.

I looked at it very carefully, and saw that a stanza of Emily Dickinson's had been scratched on it: Its little Ether Hood--Doth sit upon its Head--The millinery supple--Of the sagacious God. Now I was spectacularly terrified! The Belle of Amherst dream, that had plagued me for two decades until Dr Snap prescribed his balm and unguents, had returned to haunt me! Somehow I was conscious that I was thrashing about in my bed and yet I remained transfixed in sleep. The noise made by the hen grew louder. Knowing that \"a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid\", I looked desperately around me. Though I could hear it, the hen had vanished. The iron slab weighed heavy. Now I was knee deep in water. I began to shout, echoing Edgar Allan Poe's dying words: \"Reynolds! Reynolds! ... Reynolds!\" At the last cry, mercifully, I awoke. I jumped out of bed immediately and plunged my head into a nearby pail of icy water. Then I went to the window, and looked out at the bright morning. Rustic farmyard persons were trudging up the hill over by Bodger's Spinney. A booby and a godwit sang.\n###"}

The full index can be read in Chapter Five of Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars, the latest episode in our thrilling weekly serial. It is curious that Dobson never turned his attention to Walter Mad, for he was fascinated by despicable malefactors of every stripe. He wrote percipiently about the so-called Irksome Poisoner of Cupflop, the Hungarian maniac Borag Lacko, and Blasphemous Ted Cargpan, among others, yet the indefatigable pamphleteer seems to have overlooked the madman once described as \"the Steed Malbranque of Crime\", in reference to the evocatively-named football player.

Peering in, you see a warm and happy scene. Mr and Mrs Grip are swaddling their newborn son, a little pink Scandinavian bundle. You watch as an elderly crone enters the room, carrying a basin of piping hot water. She places the basin by the roaring fireplace, and then you hear her ask \"What are you going to call this little gift of heaven?\" And Mr and Mrs Grip speak in unison, proudly, \"We shall call him Tord!\"\nLittle did the parents or the grandmother know that the tiny tot cradled so lovingly would grow up to become what the official Football Association website calls \"an invalubale part of the Team England setup\" [sic].

Further revelations from Strange Cults And Secret Societies Of Modern London by Elliott O'Donnell (1934):\n\"On All Hallows E'en certain members of the [Ghost] Circle were invited to meet, at eleven at night, in secrecy, at cross-roads not far from South Mimms. All turned up, the founder, as usual, arriving first, and on the neighbouring clock striking midnight, they were surprised to see a herd of pigs trotting down the road towards them, road and pigs gleaming white in the moonbeams. Never had any of the members of the Ghost Circle seen such pigs! They seemed to be positively gigantic, but thin. On they came, perfectly noiselessly, and on arriving at the cross-roads, they passed through a gateway into a field, leaving in their wake a current of icy air. There was something so strange and eerie about them that several members of the Ghost Circle, overcoming a certain reluctance, ran to the gate to have another look at them. The field, which afforded no cover of any kind, was very large, and it was empty, save for cattle. The pigs had inexplicably vanished.\n\"The members of the Circle learned subsequently that the cross-roads were known to be haunted by a herd of phantom pigs, but only on All Hallows E'en.\"\nI think at the end of this month the Hooting Yard Phantom Pig Spotting Club should convene at that cross-roads in South Mimms.

It was set in an eerie and mist-enshrouded forest clearing, where a cast of regular characters were attacked by a variety of wild beasts. Much of the humour derives from the attempts of the cast to fight off savage and blood-crazed panthers, lions, bears, etcetera, armed only with a tape measure.\nAmong the show's memorable catchphrases were \"Unhand me, you brute!\", \"Eek! My windpipe has just been slashed by the razor-sharp claws of a wild hog!\" and \"Let's put the kettle on for a nice piping hot cup of tea\".\nToday DVD copies of the first two series are particularly popular with zoo monkeys.\n###"}

The first mention made of hats is about the time of the Saxons, but they were not worn except by the rich. Hats for men were invented at Paris, by a Swiss, in 1404. About the year 1510, they were first manufactured in London, by Spaniards. Before that time both men and women in England commonly wore close, knitted, woollen caps. It is related, that when Charles the Second made his public entry into Rouen, in 1449, he wore a hat lined with red velvet, surmounted with a plume or tuft of feathers; from which entry, or at least during his reign, the use of hats and caps is to be dated.

Others, however, I was extremely pleased to be reminded of. Here are the relevant quotes:\n\"Rousseau's extreme short-sight was such that at the best of times he saw the landscape as a blur, while his wife, in similar fashion, never knew which day of the week it was and never even learned to tell the time.\"\n\"In many ways [Buckland] was undeniably a very curious person: an oddly truncated man... He sported childish jests and puns, devised peculiar contraptions, went in for the weirdest kinds of food... It was typical of him that he drove round in a special kind of carriage, strengthened in an ostentatious manner... he carried around a mysterious blue bag... he led his students on excursions into the field wearing quite incongruously formal clothes.\"\n\"Robert Dick...

A member of the select and exclusive Jockey Club of Paris, and a foreign and honorary member of our own fashionable Travellers' Club here, he was at first represented as one of the elite of society--the observed of all observers--the pink of fashion and the mould of form--\"a gentlemanly-looking man of fifty-five,\" who did not merely drive a gig and graduate in respectability in such a middle-class way, but was an honoured guest in the saloons of exiled princes, and having easy access to the tables of the noblest of our countrymen, he appeared to live upon a social eminence which might have provoked jealousy, but which freed him from any suspicion of heinous criminality. On the other hand he has been represented, with perhaps equal exaggeration, to have been certainly a parvenu, and perhaps a bore. He is said to have been the son of a glove-maker, and to have had, in his own person, some mysterious commercial connection with button-making, and to have either acquired his title by the purchase of a small Italian estate which conferred that empty distinction upon him, or else to have been the last plebeian metamorphosed into an aristocrat by the will and pleasure of the late Louis Philippe. It is doubtless, as a matter of gossip, interesting to that curious individual, the general reader--but it is a matter of perfect indifference in an English court of law whether the accused is the undoubted scion of a family dating from the Deluge, or the most pushing, irrepressible, and objectionable of that terrible section of society, who are described as \"distinguished foreigners\".--The Morning Chronicle, 22 July 1861\nSome barons fancy they may do as they like in England.

She explained that the Readers' Digest records always got broken in the post, and we never wondered why she didn't simply cancel the subscription.\nShe's been gone for decades; but her wind-up gramophone remained, and when we were cleaning it up recently to send it to auction we found just one of those white-label Readers' Digest 78s, still extant in a thin drawer in the base of the machine.

{"prompt": "Lightning Rod News\n", "completion": " \nThe above graphic is not merely a sensible warning. Glyn Webster (for it is he) reminds us that during the American War of Independence there was quite a spat between Benjamin Franklin and King George III regarding the correct design of lightning rods. Franklin advocated the use of a sharpened end to the rod, which many English electricians of the time took issue with. Benjamin Wilson, a member of the Royal Court circle of George III, believed that the pointed rod actually elicited lightning strikes, and that rods with a rounded sphere were safer. Other English colleagues favoured the use of blunt-tipped rods. King George III's involvement in the dispute was politically motivated rather than having any scientific basis. As Franklin was one of the signatories to the 1776 American Declaration of Independence, the use of sharpened rods was seen to be an upstart Republican idea. Further fuel was added to the fire when the Purfleet powder magazine in outer London burnt down after a lightning strike, and the Franklin rods were blamed. The King ordered that all lightning rods throughout the empire were to have a cannon ball placed on the top of them, or be removed.\nYou can read more about this exciting dispute here. Meanwhile, if your enthusiasm for lightning rods remains unquenched, you really ought to read The Lightning-Rod Man by Herman Melville.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Victorian Ditch Trauma\n", "completion": " I have been much enjoying the Times Archive Blog recently. Old news can be so much more appealing than new news--that is, news--particularly when, as in this case which I belatedly bring to your attention, it features a postie toppling into a ditch, a scene that could come straight from a Hooting Yard story:\nAbout noon on Thursday as a labourer, in the employ of Mr Cooper, of Pyrford--a village about seven miles from Guildford--was passing through Pondfield, in the neighbourhood of his master's farm, he espied an object in the ditch, which attracted his attention. On examination the object, which was nearly covered with snow, turned out to be a man named Tappin, the messenger who delivers post letters in the outlying districts of which Pyrford and Wisley form part. Mr Cooper was at once communicated with, and he speedily arranged for the delivery of the letters, while with equal promptitude the messenger was assisted from his bed of snow, where he had been for some hours. Tappin's account is that he got into the drift and pitched headlong into the ditch, when he was too exhausted to extricate himself.\nAs the Times' archivist notes, how pleasing it is that the reporter assures us of the safe delivery of the post before mentioning the rescue of the hapless Tappin. I suspect strongly that, almost a century and a half after his ditch trauma, Postie Tappin may be resurrected as a Hooting Yard character.\n###"}

{"prompt": "A Note On Rugs\n", "completion": " Apropos of crow and hare oracles, R., in a comment, takes me to task for being cavalier about the precise nature of the rug upon which one's cards are dealt and pebbles scattered, and asks for--or rather demands--a rug reading list. It pains me to suggest that such a request merely demonstrates R.'s lack of attunement with the esoteric spheres. It also reminds me that the old fraud G I Gurdjieff began life as a travelling rug salesman. As how could he not? For his trade is hidden in his name. Take the first three letters, reverse them, and voila!, \"Gur\" becomes \"Rug\". Thus we see how human destinies can, sometimes, be inscribed in our being.\nI think it no accident, either, that my correspondent R. shares an initial with the subset of floor covering types he is getting all worked up about. I do not use the phrase \"worked up\" lightly, for of course it reminds us of \"The Work\" about which Gurdjieff babbled and wrote for much of his preposterous life. I wonder if R. would be driving himself to the same level of hysteria had I recommended dealing the cards and scattering the pebbles upon a mat, or even upon linoleum.\nIn addition, may I advise R. to be careful what he wishes for? A cursory reading of the medical literature warns us against becoming fumous-brained about floor coverings such as rugs, mats, and especially carpets. Quite literally, that way madness lies!\n\n###"}

There were bones from humans and dogs and rabbits and cows and hens and pigs and ospreys and hamsters and larks and goats and ostriches and bears and sheep and swordfish and gulls and deer and tanagers. He fetched a bale of fusewire from a cupboard. He tied the bones together with the wire. He worked slowly and with care. When he was done he leaned the bone-being against his mantelpiece at an angle he thought insouciant. He plopped a hat on its head.\n\"All hail, Vabogadabingahobbema!\" he cried.\nHe placed a cardboard box filled with sand at its lower talons as an offering.

{"prompt": "Annals Of Fruit\n", "completion": " The sun is a ball of flames. It feels like a torrid southern summer ... I can see a port. People are strolling in the shade of the high harbour walls. Shop doors are open wide. Aromas of tropical fruit fill the air with their fragrance. Peaches, oranges, apricots, raisins, cloves, and pepper all give off their wonderful scents. The asphalt steams after being sprayed with water. I can hear the strident, guttural tones of Persian merchants offering their wares. My God! How marvellous it smells here! How pleasant is the tropical air!\nSuddenly my foot tripped over my ski pole. I quickly steadied myself against the kayak, opened my eyes wide, and was dazzled by the sun. For a moment I did not know where I was. What had happened to my tropical port? How the devil had I been transported to this icy wasteland?\n\"What happened?\" asked my companions. \"Nothing,\" I answered, \"I tripped over my pole. The boreal landscape unfolded once more before me in an infinite expanse, and the sun which had fleetingly brought me such joy now sought only to blind and torture me.\nYet the hallucination did not completely vanish. My nose was still filled with the aromas of Mediterranean fruit. My companions were not conscious of my present condition. What did it mean? Was I ill? I shut my eyes tight once again. I was like an automaton, moving rhythmically with the pole in my right hand, and once again I could hear the monotonous tune: \"Far to go, so very far!\"\nBut what I had just experienced continued to trouble me.

{"prompt": "Squelchy Buffers\n", "completion": " Most buffers are not squelchy, but some are, some are. I am thinking, in particular, of the buffers in the submerged portion at the end of the line at Pointy Town. They are not just squelchy buffers, they are very squelchy buffers, at times exceedingly so, Adding to their squelchiness is the fact that the approach to the buffers, for several hundred plodes, is equipped, at regular intervals, with baffles, of both metal and sponge. The baffles first appear in the unsubmerged portion of the line but continue in the submerged portion until we are within spitting distance of the squelchy buffers themselves. Not that we would actually spit, for that would contravene the by-laws, unsurprisingly.\nThe poet-in-residence at Pointy Town Terminus, Dennis Beerpint, has recently published an anthology entitled Shall I compare thee to a squelchy buffer?, the answer to which would appear to be \"no, I would rather you didn't\" (see Canto XXVII in the collection). Beerpint spent many long hours perched on a camping-stool, half-submerged, close by the squelchy buffers, smoking his pipe and jotting down his matchless poetic apercus with a propelling pencil in a notepad. Curiously, he had nothing whatsoever to say about the metal and sponge baffles, although it is possible he is saving them for a second anthology which, like the first, will be available at the Pointy Town Terminus Kiosk.\nHoplites often disport themselves near the squelchy buffers, in historical reenactment tableaux vivants, but they do not hop.\nOccasionally, it has been remarked that prose will simply peter out.\n###"}

There were selections from T S Eliot, Sylvia Plath, and Philip Larkin, among others, but I was dismayed to note that they did not include Dennis Beerpint.\nThe twee versifier has been rather quiet of late, so I was pleased to learn that a new book is in the works. For the last year, apparently, Beerpint has been busy with a project entitled Imperfectly-Remembered Mitteleuropean Folk Songs In Translation. He has collected at least four or five examples, enough for a characteristically slim volume of verse.\nUnder cover of darkness, Pansy Cradledew smashed her way into Beerpint's so-called \"poetry hut\" and managed to steal Gestetnered copies of a couple of the pieces, so we can give readers a sneak preview. The first is called \"The Shepherd's Lament\":\nThere is a shepherd in the hills / There is a [something] green / But black is the crow in the [something] tree / And lightning blasts the sky / The shepherd's lass has golden hair / She [something something] milk / But the crow has flown away, my love / And the ducks have left the lake.\nMarvellous.

Although you might not think it, ornaments, however small, can and do get in your way. I remember one match that was entirely lost because of the presence of a gold curb bracelet with a small dangling chain attached. Putting up her hand to adjust a hairpin, the owner did not know that the chain had caught on to her fringe-net, and, bringing her hand down quickly, the fringe-net and most of the hairpins were dragged from her hair. The result was that the player, who might easily have left the court and fixed up her hair again firmly, adjusted it as best she could, her hair blowing about in all directions. In between every stroke she had to clutch wildly at stray portions that blew across her face and into her eyes. This diversion naturally upset her game, and I think that was the last time she wore a bracelet in court.\" -- Mrs Lambert Chambers, Lawn Tennis For Ladies (1910)\n###"}
{"prompt": "Z\n", "completion": " During the last splutters of the Harold Wilson years, I had occasion to read a slim book entitled Zen Buddhism, which consisted simply of a series of what I think are called koans, anecdotes or parables designed to assist one in striving towards enlightenment. I do not recall any particular koan in detail, but they all seemed very similar, and tucked away in my memory there is a sort of generic koan, which goes something like this:\nOne day Bin-Bag was fishing in a stream, and he caught a pike. He decided to take it to his Master as a gift.\n\"Here, Master, I have brought you a pike,\" he said.\nBin-Bag's Master took the pike, and then he picked up a stick and bashed his pupil about the head with it.\n\"Ouch!\" wailed Bin-Bag. \"Why are you hitting me when I have brought you a pike?\"\nThe Master pushed Bin-Bag down a slope and resumed his meditation. Bin-Bag rubbed his head and understood he was one step further towards Enlightenment.\nI was young and impressionable, but even then I could see that this was complete twaddle. Compared to Zen, Roman Catholicism seemed sensible and coherent. I decided to have no truck with Eastern mysticism in future.\nYears later, however, I was glad I had read the book. I was commissioned to write a potted biography of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, and struggled to find an angle from which to approach the subject. Then I realised that the witless koans provided an ideal model. I was able to scribble dozens of short yarns about the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman, based on my faltering recollection of Zen koans. The only changes I had to make were to substitute the Zen Master's bashing and shoving with the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman's technique of making haphazard gesticulations at a robin, or at a flock of sparrows, or, in extremis, when faced with a particularly recalcitrant acolyte, wandering woozily off to a nearby kiosk to buy herself a toffee apple.\nAnd that brings us smartly to the end of our alphabet.\n###"}

Having gazed, unblinking, at its reflection, blurry, blurry, the duck turns about and walks back to the pond, into which it plashes, and often times upends itself, so to a passer-by only its fundament and feet are visible, its head and upper body submerged in the water. When a breeze gusts, as it usually does, the leaves on trees on the horizon rustle. If the breeze becomes a gale, the trees sway. Once the wind grew so strong one of them, a beech, crashed to the ground, its topmost twigs and branches falling into the swamp at the swamp's edge. Fortunately for the duck, it was in the pond when this happened. The sky was black, for the wind was howling in the night, and there were no stars to be seen, because of clouds. The duck was terrified.\nIf ever you pass by that pond, chuck some stale breadcrusts to the duck. If you are on your way to the trees, to take measurements, or to carve your initials and those of your sweetheart into the bark on a trunk, be sure to skirt the swamp. Even the stoutest and most voluminous wading boots will not save you from sinking into the murk and slime, glubb glubb glubb. If you take the proper route to the trees, you will pass the memorial garden where stones and piles of pebbles and rugged wooden crosses mark those whose souls the swamp has claimed. The duck has seen some of them, from the safety of its pond, as they sank, flailing and helpless and screaming. It is a traumatised duck.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Wooden Child And Fiery Serpent And Trees\n", "completion": " \n\nIntriguingly, the serpent is belching fire not through its mouth but from its fundament. This is more common than you might think. Often, when I roam the lanes of my bailiwick, I come upon similar scenes of wooden tinies being menaced by fiery serpents, and in a significant number of cases serpentine fundament-fire is seen to occur. For the serpent, the advantage of this is that when a public-spirited figure such as myself chances upon it and extinguishes the flames with a handy portable fire extinguisher, it does not gag or choke on the jet of exciting fire-suppressant foam, as invariably happens with mouth-sourced serpentine flames, but merely shrugs it off, inasmuch as a serpent can shrug, and slithers off on its merry way down the lane. Unfortunately, I have to say that the skittish wooden tinies whose imperilment I so selflessly avert tend to be an ungrateful lot, and it is rare indeed that I am even thanked, let alone given a reward. Nevertheless, I shall not stint in my roamings, along the winding lanes of my bailiwick, armed with my fire extinguisher.\nNote the disposition of the trees.\nThe picture appears in Monster Brains, to which the reader is referred.\n###"}

A bird's feathers are replaced periodically during its life through molt. For those of you who do not know what a bird is, let me tell you: it is a bipedal, warm-blooded, egg-laying vertebrate characterized primarily by feathers, forelimbs modified as wings, and hollow bones. Wings, by the way, are surfaces used to produce an aerodynamic force normal to the direction of motion by travelling in air or another gaseous medium, gas being one of the phases of matter. An ideal gas, or perfect gas, is a hypothetical gas which obeys gas laws exactly. Below is a picture of a man who devoted his life to obeying the Laws of Gas.

Now if the hammer were removed, the tendency of the pin would be to yield to the pull of the string; but if the pin is turned enough to take up such amount of string as was pulled through the bridge, and, as it is turned, is allowed to yield downward toward the pull of the string, it will resume its balance and the string will stand at that pitch, provided it has been \"rendered\" properly over the bridges.

{"prompt": "P Is for Planaria\n", "completion": " The fact-packed sixteenth episode of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet\nGlagolitic script was invented in the latter half of the ninth century by the monk Cyril, who is better known for having devised the alphabet which bears his name, Cyrillic. Glagolitic was designed to provide a written rendering of Old Slavonic, the language spoken by the Moravians among whom Cyril and his brother Methodius were carrying out their holy work. The word glagol, or hlahol, cannot easily be translated into English. Its meaning involves the sound of bells and the call to the glory of God in worship.\nMoop seems not to have considered such associations when one considers the subject-matter of her secretive Glagolitic scribblings. She was embroiled in the study of a fiendish species of flatworms known as planaria, which kill and feed on earthworms. The vile flatworms excrete an enzyme like a narcotic drug that paralyses an earthworm completely. Then they excrete another that dissolves the worm into a sort of soup. Then they suck it up. In the space of half an hour, all that remains is a trace of soil from the earthworm's stomach.\nPlanaria are successful because they have no known predators. Having no muscles, these hideous flatworms simply fall apart if any attempt is made to eat them. Like a vagabond horde, planaria are highly mobile, wiping out all the earthworms in one area before moving on relentlessly to another. It is not difficult to imagine what havoc Moop could wreak in Doctor Cack's potato-patches by introducing a gang of killer flatworms. Let us remember that the good Doctor had entitled a special issue of his Bulletin Let Us Now Sing The Praises Of The Humble Earthworm, so essential was its contribution to potato cultivation.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Blind Men And Ostriches\n", "completion": " One of the combat sports which thrilled the crowds in the circuses of Ancient Rome was the pitting of blind men against ostriches. A savage and ugly spectacle, no doubt, and one quite out of keeping with our modern sensibilities, to say nothing of health and safety legislation. Yet I can't help feeling that it would make a tremendous subject for a Gladiator-style movie blockbuster. The Antipodean player Russell Crowe--or, as I prefer to think of him, the Artist Formerly Known As Bouffanted Rockabilly Star Russ Le Roq--is so talented an actor one can imagine him playing either a blind man or, caked in prosthetics, an ostrich. What with the computer generated wizardry available to today's film-makers, he could appear on our screens as both antagonists, and indeed, his image multiplied a thousandfold, as the baying blood-crazed crowd.\nI may put my mind to drafting a screenplay, in which our hero is, let's say, an Ancient Roman haruspex who is blinded when a struggling chicken whose entrails he is attempting to rip out pokes its taloned feet into his eyes. From there it is a short and sorry journey to the Colosseum, where an enraged and starving ostrich awaits. It strikes me that, if there is a need to do the film on the cheap, a high-tech ostrich outfit could be dispensed with. Russell Crowe is, famously, a knitting enthusiast, and given the right wool he could knit his own ostrich costume.\nAdd a musical soundtrack of bumptious ditties by Randy Newman, and I suspect this could be a surefire hit.\n###"}

It would be more accurate to say that she force-feeds you the oranges, given that you have only just eaten and have already told her that you have stomach cramps. Suzanne is feeding you oranges when what you asked her for was Dr Boswell's Elixir, promoted in television adverts as the most effective indigestion remedy of the 21st century. Although you suspect strongly that Dr Boswell is a fictional character rather than a real doctor, his white-coated, bespectacled, avuncular figure with that reassuring blend of piercing intelligence and a kindly bedside manner a little too good to be true, you still want to take a draught of his elixir, and all you get is a mug of tea and a bowl of oranges, which Suzanne starts ramming into your mouth without even peeling them first. Clearly she is trying to choke you. What can you do? Her place near the river is far away from any other buildings, and no one is going to come and help you, even if you manage to spit out the oranges and scream your head off. Before you lose consciousness, you reflect ruefully--if it is possible to be rueful while panic-stricken--that you had absolutely no idea Suzanne was a homicidal maniac on the loose, whose modus operandi is the infliction of death by fruit. You can hear the boats go by, but that is not much solace now, for in about five minutes time your body will end up in the cellar of Suzanne's place near the river, lying alongside the corpse of a man who was beaten to death with a kumquat.\n###"}

Until last Thursday, he was Greece's most popular man. Now he, and Thanou, are seen as traitors. Greeks are united in contempt for the pair bringing such shame on their country at an event they hoped would mark its triumphant emergence as a modern European country. 'They should be strung up,' said Litsa Sarantou, a beekeeper. 'No,' added retired bank employee Nassos Kafezopoulos. 'They should be shot.'\nMax does not say that he has put aside all his current projects in order to write an opportunistic potboiler in which fearful Hellenic sprinters are pursued by a vigilante beekeeper armed with a rope and a noose, but I am sure he is just hiding his light under a bushel.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Infants Savants\n", "completion": " I don't drive, and am almost wholly ignorant about cars. Certainly, other than a couple of iconic designs such as the VW Beetle and the Mini, I cannot tell one make of car from another. Thus it was, and remains, inexplicable to me how my eldest son, when tiny, eagerly announced the name of every car he saw. He was two or three years old at the time, not yet able to read, but when we went for a walk, he would point at each parked car we saw along a street, piping up its name. Other than his mispronunciation of \"Ford Sierra\" as \"Fonsierra\", he was unerringly correct. Eventually, he stopped doing this, and moved on to other childish things, straightforward and unremarkable. One's own child is never unremarkable, of course, but I mean to say that the talents he developed and displayed were not what Charles Fort would have described as \"wild talents\", such as that somehow eerie, pre-literate knowledge of cars. Where did it come from?\nI had more or less forgotten about this as the years passed, until this morning, when I read:\nwe moved back to Paris, and there I have, on my father's authority, a story about people standing him drinks at the cafe while I entertained the clientele by identifying the marque of each car as it passed on the boulevard: \"Renault! Peugeot! Citroen! Simca!\" I haven't evinced any savant talents since, but apparently at two I had this precocious knack--of cars only, French cars in particular.\nThat is Peter Blegvad, reminiscing in The Bleaching Stream (Journal of the London Institute of 'Pataphysics, Number 3, Absolu 139). It is precisely the same case as my son--the infant savant, privy to a body of knowledge without apparent provenance, displayed for a brief period when very young.

So I have not deemed any of my slumberland visions worthy of inclusion here since that exciting dream related on 27th January this year under the title The Glove Of Ib.\nLast night I had one of those seemingly endless, episodic dreams which flitted from one scene to another with remorseless unreason. One part stayed with me after I woke, and, despite the above, I think it may be of interest to Hooting Yard readers.\nI was giving a talk in a huge auditorium to an audience of youngsters. They were gathered at one end of the hall, and I was in the middle. Immediately behind me was a sort of hardboard screen, beyond which was the \"workshop\" wherein my two assistants were located. One of these assistants was the late actor Roy Kinnear. He was sat at a table on which was a record turntable, and he kept playing snatches of an LP of classical music--piano and cello, I recall. I wished for silence while addressing the youths, and kept ducking back behind the screen asking Mr Kinnear to stop playing the record, but every time I returned to my lectern, the music started up again. Eventually, I grabbed a wooden chair leg and ran at Roy Kinnear, brandishing it above my head and threatening to bash his head in if he did not cease.\n\nRoy Kinnear\nThat's it. Then the dream went off at a tangent I forget. I haven't thought about Roy Kinnear for years. Sadly, he died in 1988, on horseback, while filming in Spain. I would like to offer him a posthumous apology, and assure his ghost that he can play snatches of cello and piano music for all eternity, without the threat of being clubbed with a chair leg.\n###"}

{"prompt": "A Shot In The Dark\n", "completion": " There is a story in today's Grauniad about young Polish artists being recruited to recreate Vincent Van Gogh's paintings for a film. Young British artists, apparently, lack the skills for the work because all they are \"taught\" (if that is the word) at art school is how to make conceptual art. That would certainly explain the unbelievably tiresome twaddle exuded by the Hoxtonwankers.\nA professor at the Royal College of Art insists \"there are some very fine painters, but the focus is on innovation and finding a new way of painting\". Well, fine, but it might help if students learned some \"old\" ways of painting first. Minor things like how to hold a brush and how to apply paint to canvas--that would be a start.\nBut that is by the by, because what really got my attention was the final paragraph of the story, referring to the film.\nLoving Vincent will question whether Van Gogh's death was suicide or murder. [Co-producer] Welchman points to a Frenchman's \"oblique\" admission that he shot the artist and that police have never found a weapon.\nThe inference of that last phrase is surely that the French police are still investigating. If it said \"police never found a weapon\", that would consign it firmly to the past. The inclusion of \"have\" suggests a live, ongoing enquiry.

None criticised it more severely than those 'abolitionists' to placate whom the Bill had been brought in. That is perhaps natural enough. For them, it abolished too little. The nervous and those who simply saw no reason for change (known as 'retentionists', just as non-motorists had, to their astonishment, come to be known as 'pedestrians') were dismayed to find that no more than a 'life' sentence (averaging ten years) thenceforward awaited those who, for the first time as far as the law knew and when not actively engaged in robbery, for any reason or none, killed anyone but a policeman or prison officer with poison, cold steel, a blunt instrument, drowning, strangulation, smothering, burning, gassing, starvation, driving a car at the victim or tampering with his brakes, infecting him with a fatal disease, pushing him off a tall building or over a cliff, torturing him beyond what his constitution would bear, shutting him in with dangerous animals, inducing madness with drugs, hypnotic suggestion or sustained ill-treatment and then putting the means of suicide into his hands or leading him to believe that a fatal trap is a way to safety, anything in fact that a writer of detective stories might plausibly imagine.

{"prompt": "Potted Autobiography\n", "completion": " Occasionally the Hooting Yard postbox is choked with letters from readers all of which say, in so many words, \"Frank, tell us what you're really like\". My natural diffidence makes me reluctant to respond to such pleas, but today I have changed my mind. Here, then, is a brief but devastatingly accurate pen-portrait of \"Mister Hooting Yard\".\nUnlike Maya Angelou, I have no idea why the caged bird sings. Nor am I particularly given to singin' and swingin' and gettin' merry like Christmas. On the contrary, I have an almost fathomless ignorance of ornithological matters and the Yuletide season will find me moping and lugubrious. Thus, if I am ever to write a series of memoirs, it will not do for me to plagiarise Maya Angelou's catchy titles. I will have to come up with my own ideas, and the strain of doing so makes it unlikely that I will be in a fit state to continue writing once I have hit upon the perfect title for the story of my own life. Of course, if I was able to get my hands on the Cordial Balm of Siriacum (see O Cure Me, below, 6th March) that might provide the fillip I need, and I would be able to type away energetically, regaling you with anecdotes from my past, attempting an amusing yet cogent dissection of my current state, and even looking forward to the future with the aid of psychic messages from a squirrel.

If, my fellow citizens, we are serious about tackling crime, root and branch, we are going to need a hell of a lot more than a lab full of tin pots, a lab with a leaking roof and an antiquated piping system, a lab which has not been patrolled at night by brightly-fanged guard dogs since the last sputtering gasps of the Eisenhower administration.

In her only book, Six Hundred And Six Stories, Chew demonstrated what she called \"interstitial prose\": she would take an existing composition (from a bewildering variety of sources) and insert her own text in between each and every sentence of the original material. Sometimes the results were startling: the poet Gervase Beerpint, in one of his all too rare critical essays, said that Chew's story based upon a chapter from George Bernard Shaw's \"nonage novel\" The Irrational Knot was \"as good as anything by Ayn Rand, and makes John Fowles read like a grumpy cod-mystic of limited talent\". (Inevitably, Beerpint received a grumpy letter from Fowles within days of the essay being published. Wisely, he cast it into a furnace.) As a special treat for Hooting Yard readers, we have gained permission to reprint one of Marigold Chew's uncollected stories, The Albatross, where her \"interstices\" appear within a short sketch of the same title by Augustus Earle which was included in The Book of Enterprise & Adventure; Being an Excitement to Reading for Young People (London, 1851).\n###"}

In spite of the fact that these huge explosions of energy from the sun which could crash electricity grids and paralyse the earth are due to occur in just three years' time, the story was not the main headline. Nor even the second or third. In fact, it came at the tail-end of the bulletin, the place one might expect to be told about a skateboarding duck or a pancake bearing the face of Christ.\nHas it come to this? The destruction of civilisation is considered to be of lesser account than Nick Clegg? Yes, yes, we know Clegg smokes and idolises Samuel Beckett and weeps when he listens to the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss, but remember, too, that Chris Mullin, a man of (I think) some integrity, who still watches television in black-and-white, describes him as \"easily the biggest charlatan of the lot\".\nThe terrifying thing is that, if two-thirds of the skies will indeed be smothered in a blood-red aurora, what will become of Hooting Yard? Let's get our priorities right. The Lib Dem party conference may be of interest to smoking Beckettian Straussist charlatans and their hangers-on, but any sane person would be preparing themselves for a hideous new dispensation of pre-industrial scavenging, untold savagery, and silence like unto death itself falling upon Dobson and Blodgett and Tiny Enid and Pebblehead and all your Hooting Yard favourites.

Occasionally I think it necessary to give a comment a more prominent airing, for even the most assiduous reader might miss a buried gem. Like this one, received today regarding The Heroic Bus Driver Of Pointy Town:\nHi there. With all this discussion of our township I thought it was about time we thanked you for putting Pointy Town on the map. Well, it already is on the map of the Yukon Territory here in Canada, but we don't get to be in the news much. Pointy Town has just elected a Mayor for the first time, after being recognised as a township, and we have appointed a promotions chief to put us on the Web. The Mayor is Johnny Osikomiwasa (proud of his Inuit roots) and his buzz word this week is 'promotion'. So that's what I am doing. So I intend to climb to the top of Pointy Hill (it really is very pointy) and start promoting--well actually I will probably have to do the promoting from my office computer. So keep up the good work and tell the world about our Pointy Town. Hugs, Kelly (very tired, on fire watch)\nNow, Kelly Le Cornu, my correspondent, has an email address at pointytown.com.ca, and I have no reason to believe she is a fictional character. Isn't it marvellous to think that there is a real Pointy Town, with a Pointy Hill? I am looking forward to the promised web presence of this magnificent township, and will certainly link to it. If anyone would like to start planning an outing, let me know. As some wag put it the other day, \"it's like Hooting Yard gone mad!\"\n###"}

At certain periods in his life, he maintained a voluminous, almost demented daily journal. At other times he made only scattered and vestigial scribblings, and there are also whole stretches where he fell completely silent, at least as a diarist. Surprisingly, there has been as yet no attempt to marshal all the extant texts into a published edition. Here, however, is Dobson's diary entry written sixty years ago to the day, on the first of January 1953:\nCabbage stalks in swans' blood for breakfast. Then I went for a trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal. Stopped to gaze at cows--the cows gazed back. Spent untold hours slumped at my escritoire struggling with my pamphlet in progress, Farming With Gnomes. The problem is I know little about farming and even less about gnomes. Why, then, asked my inamorata Marigold Chew, did I choose the topic in the first place? She fails to grasp the intricate workings of what I have decided to dub \"Dobson Praxis\", a praxis that itself may be the subject of a future pamphlet.\nWhen the time came to sharpen my pencil I could not find the pencil sharpener, so instead I picked up this week's copy of The Listener and read a fascinating article about a buff-breasted sandpiper. From a careful reading--and rereading--I deduced that this is some sort of bird, though what it is doing hanging around at a sewage works is beyond me. If I had wings and the power of flight I am by no means certain that I would choose to wallow in sewage when I could take wing and fly to, oh I don't know, somewhere less noisome and noxious.\nActually, I note that the writer calls it a sewage farm rather than a sewage works. Perhaps this is a suitable type of farm for gnomes. I shall have to embark upon further research.\nPig innards and peas for supper.\n\n###"}

Still thy beating heart!\nBUTTON, BUTTON The players sit around the room in a circle. The leader then holds a button between his hands, with the palms pressed together, so as to hide it. He goes around the circle, passing his hand between those of the players.

The circuit having been made, the leader says to the first player: \"Button, button, who has the button?\" The one questioned must answer, naming some one whom he thinks has it. So it continues until all have had a turn at answering the same question. Then the leader says: \"Button, button, rise!\" The button holder must do this.\n\nSome buttons\nPROGRESSIVE PUZZLES Provide as many small, square cards as there are guests; also several pairs of scissors.

After the first cut, the pieces must be held together until the second cut has been made. A player mixes his pieces and passes them to his right-hand neighbor. When the leader gives the signal, all the players put together the four pieces they have. The one who first succeeds calls out \"ready.\" Then all stop and pass the cards on again.

I have read and reread the story, in the faint hope that R. misunderstood it and that there really is--or was--a 3ft wasp at large in Hampshire. It would make a terrific short story, wouldn't it? As Mrs Gubbins awoke one morning from uneasy dreams she found herself transformed in her bed into a gigantic wasp.

But it was exceedingly difficult to examine it in any detail, because of the cracks and the holes. These were now so legion that the story itself was barely perceptible. It would be more accurate to say that it was not perceptible at all, by any of the senses, even if all five were in working order. It is, I suppose, vaguely possible, but only vaguely, that someone blessed with a sixth sense might be able to perceive the story, but oh, dimly, dimly. There were just far too many cracks, and far too many holes, and it simply did not hang together. How could you hang a hole, after all, or a crack, even separately, one by one, discrete, let alone all together?

{"prompt": "Lost In Translation\n", "completion": " Sometimes I find myself fretting about things which common sense tells me are absolutely not worth fretting about. Yet still I fret. Think of it as idiotic fretting.\nThe latest matter to consume my stupid attention is as follows. I was struck, when watching Danish television dramas such as Borgen and The Killing, by the immense politeness of the Danes. In both shows, the characters are forever saying \"Takk\" (\"Thank you\"), certainly more so than the average Brit or American would do. I am not familiar with real life in Denmark, but I assume that the writers of these series are making every effort to reproduce the actual speech of contemporary Danes.\nIn Game Of Thrones, by contrast, we are told by Ser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) that \"there is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki\". Given that the Dothraki are a savage and barbaric race whose idea of a square meal is to consume a whole horse-heart, raw, the absence of an expression of gratitude is not surprising.\nBut what is bothering me is this : when Danish dramas are shown on Dothraki television, how in heaven's name will the subtitle-writers cope with all those \"Takk\"s?\nIt is, to be sure, a proper quandary, if an idiotic one.\n\nThe Khaleesi eating a raw horse-heart for breakfast\n###"}

What makes me gnash my teeth in irritation is that this portentous comment doesn't actually mean anything, it just sounds as if it does. James wants to be thought of with high seriousness, so he spouts this rubbish, and it gets lapped up by the witless literati, who probably think it does mean something. (I seem to recall one of James' other \"talents\" has been fawning to the royal family, so that gives us some idea just how \"all too real\" his world is.) End of minor rant.\n###"}

Nashe wrote of the terrors of the night, and there was nothing natty about them. Or gnatty. Oh, sweep them away, the swarms, or disperse them with a blast from a bicycle pump.\nImagine if Lee Harvey Oswald had been armed with a bicycle pump rather than with a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.

If I tell the truth--that I donated my hammer as a raffle prize for the Toffee Factory Charity Gala Night--I get that look of bewilderment and condescension that makes my blood boil and makes me want to start hammering my putative big hammer at four o clock in the morning. I then feel compelled to point out that all of the prizes on that fateful night were specifically requested by Mistress Brockbracke, who asked for donations of items that ended in -ammer, or its phonetic equivalent. So, in addition to my hammer, she was given a windjammer, a clamour (of rooks, in a spacious if rusty birdcage), a copy of Glamour magazine, a rubber stamp of the Greek letter gamma, several more hammers, and a banner, the latter given by the partially deaf man who loiters outside the post office with an eel wrapped round his neck. And I simply cannot be bothered to explain all that to the kind of people whose lives are so empty that all they can think about is to stop me mucking about with my eyepatch and to ask me why I haven't got a hammer.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Botched Trepanning Operations\n", "completion": " Yesterday's passing mention of botched trepanning operations prompted Pansy Cradledew to remind me of the account given by Nestingbird in his Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Dobson But Were Afraid To Ask. I am pleased to reprint it here:\nFor about a week, Dobson had been jabbering to anyone who would listen that he was determined to have a hole drilled in his skull. He had been impressed by the sixties songstress Julie Felix, and convinced himself that if he, too, had his cranium punctured, he may be able to resume his abortive musical career. In spite of the loud groaning of his friends, Dobson bought a ukulele and sat listening repeatedly to Julie Felix's recording of The Great Brain Robbery, trying hopelessly to learn the chords.\nThursday came, a day of incomprehensible weather and newspaper headlines about a previously unknown strain of potato blight. Dobson slipped out of the house before breakfast, returned his library books, and caught a train to Mustard Parva, where, having located the high street, he rapped upon the door of Dr Stanley Hinge.\n\"I want you to drill a hole in my skull!\" shouted Dobson, overenthusiastically, brandishing a drill-bit in the face of the bewildered medico. The pamphleteer wrongly believed that Dr Hinge was the local secretary of the Julie Felix Fan Club and would therefore be sympathetic. Alas, he had got the wrong man.\nWhat happened next was so appalling that I cannot bring myself to describe it to the delicate readers of Hooting Yard. Suffice to say that Dobson emerged from Dr Hinge's surgery three hours later, bloodied and bandaged, with no less than fourteen dents in his head. Dents, but no holes. Suffering from temporary amnesia as a result of the doctor's cack-handed attentions, Dobson spent the next three months wandering aimlessly around some hideous rural backwater, living off berries and canal water, sleeping in various noisome barnyards and talking to cows.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Job Application\n", "completion": " With Osama Bin Laden dead, the position of figurehead for the global Al Qaeda franchise is vacant. I would like to put myself forward to fill this important role. It is true that I do not believe in Allah, have never handled a Kalashnikov, and, indeed, have in the past scribbled a blasphemous cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed (see here and below). No doubt these things will count against me in the initial round of interviews, which I understand will be taking place in some remote mountain fastness in the coming days. But I have every confidence that I will be able to win over the wild-eyed nutters and gun-toting beardy persons with my unique vision of the role. What Al Qaeda desperately needs, I will argue, is an injection of woolly Church of England-style cardigan-wearing niceness. Instead of all that chanting and suicide bombing and beheading, I see the waging of jihad as a matter of cups of tea and arrowroot biscuits and seed cake, with a spot of choral evensong and a sermon. And instead of all that shouty sermonising packed with threats against Jews and infidels, the sermons under my dispensation will be abstruse and windy, full of qualifying phrases and equivocation.

Stipples of what looks like gouache have been stippled hither and thither about the composition to add elan. There is an unseemly smudge at the bottom left, above which the painter's signature has been scribbled with a biro, seemingly so hurriedly that it is illegible.

The counting player finishes by writing their name and the number of bees they have counted on their sheet of paper, folds it in half twice, and places it in the pot, which can be an upturned hat, or a cauldron, or some similar container. Then the next player counts the bees, and so on, until there are as many pieces of folded paper in the pot as there are players. One family member is then nominated to take the papers from the pot, put them in an envelope, affix a postage stamp, and address the envelope to the local Official Bee Counting Person. Remember to write your return address on the back of the envelope. A second player is then nominated to go out into the dark night, wild with gales, and pop the envelope into the nearest post box. While they are gone, the remaining players place the bee pictures in a neat pile and tidy away the pencils.

{"prompt": "An Exciting Pastime\n", "completion": " Frederica Seeger's Entertainments For Home, Church & School (1910) is packed with unbearably exciting diversions. Here, for example, is \"Lighting The Candle\" :\nThis feat is a very amusing one, and is performed as follows: Two persons kneel on the ground, facing each other. Each holds in his left hand a candle in a candlestick, at the same time grasping his right foot in his right hand. This position compels him to balance himself on his left knee. One of the candles is lighted; the other is not. The holders are required to light the unlighted candle from the lighted one. The conditions are simple enough, but one would hardly believe how often the performers will roll over on the floor before they succeed in lighting the candle. It will be found desirable to spread a newspaper on the floor between the combatants. Many spots of candle-grease will thus be intercepted, and the peace of mind of the lady of the house proportionately spared.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Burnt Maps\n", "completion": " Mister Bim bought an atlas as a birthday gift for his daughter, who was tremendously fond of geography. Without opening the big fat book, Mister Bim asked the oddly-haired shop assistant to wrap it up in colourful and exciting paper and to tie a ribbon around it. The shop assistant did the wrapping with precision and care, but then got the ribbon entangled in his odd hair, and had to use a pair of scissors to free it. Now the ribbon was not long enough to girdle the atlas.\n\"I am most dreadfully dreadfully sorry,\" said the shop assistant.\n\"Oh never you mind now,\" said Mister Bim, \"the wrapping paper is lovely all by itself.\" The paper had a pattern of interlocking hollyhocks, delphiniums, and fire extinguishers, all red and green and gold and purple and yellow and blue.\nMister Bim's daughter, Clytemnestra, unwrapped the atlas on her birthday three days later. She beamed and gave her papa a kiss on his hairy cheek.\n\"Oh gosh what can I say thank you so much papa!\" she said.\nWe learned in the very first sentence that Clytemnestra was terrifically fond of geography. That fondness had led her to become knowledgeable, too. So imagine her disappointment when, upon close inspection, she discovered that every single one of the maps in the atlas was inaccurate. The port of Split is not in Bolivia. The world's largest lake is not just a few miles south of Swanage. Swanage itself is not spelled Swange.\n\"I will take it back to that shop and complain,\" said Mister Bim.\n\"No no, papa. Let us tear all the maps out of the book and make a fire with them. Let us create a conflagration like unto the very flames of Hell.\"\nAnd, children, do you know something?

As we all know--and shudder as we remember--the Grunty Man dwells in a filthy and horrible and tenebrous cave. Weirdly, some sort of magnetic anomaly in the rock of which the cave is composed has led to the Grunty Man's bestial grunts being somehow recorded and preserved for posterity. By harnessing state-of-the-art 78 rpm shellac disc engroovement technology, the Swiss gruntologists were able to transfer the awful sounds from the dank interior of the cave on to state-of-the-art 78 rpm shellac discs (with grooves). A collection of said discs has now been made available to the public, so we can all relive the terrors of our totdom.\nHere is a transcript of the Grunty Man, musing upon his existence on this day in 1913, and 1813, and 1713, and 1613, and back, back, at intervals of a century, to before the earth was formed, to before the universe existed, to before time and space, back to that unimaginably distant past when the Grunty Man was all there ever was, or ever is, or ever will be:\nGrunt grunt grunt.\n###"}

Pleasurable as it may be to embark upon a rant, I fear that in doing so Hooting Yard would fall victim to the tetchiness and spleen that sours so many websites. Readers do not alight here for that kind of thing, after all. We aim to instruct, edify, and entertain, and for those times when you are keen to read a litany of complaints, there are untold thousands of blogs and suchlike with names like Moaning Minnie and Getting In A Flap About Nothing In Particular. I may even start one myself.\nWhere was I? Ah yes, junk emails. So often tiresome, but occasionally they can be amusing, as was one I received this morning, for the simple reason that it began \"Dear Horse Enthusiast\". After that, admittedly, it swiftly grew tedious. As the \"owner of a horse-related website\" I was being offered free inclusion in an equestrian directory, aiming to \"improve the connection between people who provide horse-related information, services, and products and those who seek them\". This seems to me an admirable service.\nI have never before thought of myself as a Horse Enthusiast, but perhaps Christine Wendin, who signed the letter, knows me better than I know myself. Ms Wendin is apparently the COO of the Equestrian Directory, which I take to indicate that she is its Chief Operating Officer, or similar, though she could conceivably be a Clairvoyant Old Ostrogoth, peering into an orb which reveals to her horse enthusiasts like myself who, for one reason or another, have so repressed our enthusiasm that we live empty lives in blithe ignorance of our true calling.\nI have given this much thought, and intend to print up a set of visiting cards reading Frank Key, Editor of Hooting Yard & Clairvoyantly Revealed Horse Enthusiast, perhaps emblazoned with a monogram of a horse's head, or mane, or shanks.\n\nMy lovely horse is the one on the right\n###"}

{"prompt": "Uncake Day\n", "completion": " In some cultures, it is traditional for Uncake Day to take place shortly after Pancake Day. On Uncake Day, sacks of flour are hidden away behind wooden partitions, eggs remain uncounted and ignored in their nests and cartons, and milk from cows is used to make pap or slops for the benefit of bedridden invalids. No pan may be used for the making of a cake, on pain of excommunication from whichever faith one professes, or execution, by the severing of one's head or the ripping of one's heart, bloody and throbbing, from one's chest, depending on the savagery of that faith.\nIt has been said, by Clunk among others, that the savagery of a religious tradition is in direct correlation to its cake dogmas. Woolly-minded, cardigan-wearing followers of weedy milksop faiths will have few if any prohibitions on the eating of cake, including the pancake, that most panny of all cakes. Such vapid belief systems also use cake as a celebratory foodstuff at every opportunity, rather than acknowledging its numinous quality by restricting cakey joy to one or two days a year, as the barbaric and blood-drenched religions do.\nIn a certain light, when cooked just so, a pancake resembles a miniature edible sun.

{"prompt": "Tiny Bird Brains\n", "completion": " Despite having tiny pea-sized brains, birds may be more intelligent than we thought. Avian scientists have been studying crows, which are apparently able to carry out tasks involving food and twigs which would be beyond the wit of a human infant. They can also make elementary tools, like hooks, though why a crow, with its fierce lacerating talons, would need a hook is beyond me. The cleverest crow in the study, incidentally, was called Betty, which seems an unusual name for a crow. If I had a pet crow, which I do not, I would call it something like Cecilia, or Hortense, or perhaps Clytemnestra! But Betty was a New Caledonian crow, so perhaps that is pertinent.\nIn trying to explain why minuscule bird brains are able to wield such unexpected mental power, the scientists suggest that they may work in entirely different ways to the brains of mammals. Apprised of this, Pansy Cradledew has suggested that I could challenge Edward De Bono and Tony Buzan as a self-styled brain expert and churn out a series of books, with titles such as Think Like A Crow, Rewire Your Brain The Cormorant Way, and Storm Petrel Thought Patterns Made Easy.\n###"}

These being the days before punk, my phantom line-ups included players of the cello and bassoon and theremin as well as guitar, bass and drums. I devised album and track titles and liner notes--much as I have done in recent years for Vril, to my continuing astonishment--and wrote record and concert reviews.

Among them, this:\n\"One evening, an acquaintance of mine, who is an Irish writer of some repute, having drunk rather more than was good for him, a by no means unusual occurrence, in attempting to stagger home from his club, by some means he could never quite explain, got into a strange house instead of his own, and found himself in a semi-dark room full of queer-looking people, male and female, clad in leopard skins. Being given a skin by a dark, foreign-looking girl, he tried to put it on and, in spite of his addled senses, he so far succeeded that no one appeared to notice it was upside down. Probably no one paid any heed to him, everyone's attention being centred on a woman, who was standing in the middle of the room, haranguing them. My friend could not see her very distinctly owing to the lights being turned down, but he judged her to be coloured, she looked so dark, and not a British subject, as she spoke with a decided foreign accent. The cool night air, blowing into the room, through an open window near at hand, gradually sobered him, and his brain became quite clear. He realised then that the people around him belonged to some strange exotic cult, and finally the amazing fact that they were Leopard and Panther People dawned on him.\"\nThe quotation is from Strange Cults And Secret Societies Of Modern London by Elliott O'Donnell, published in 1934.

The students on the creative writing course, aged 13 to 16, were charming, enthusiastic, creative and full of ideas. One of the things I shared with them was the inspirational joy of cryptic crossword clues. Forget about trying to solve them (that is a separate pleasure), just treat them as phrases cut loose from any context, in which case they can act as starting points for pieces of prose.\n\"Prince enters flat of major\" was one of the clues in yesterday's Guardian crossword, and I wrote a short piece inspired by it.\nPrince Fulgencio's entourage--all clanking armour and burnished golden helmets--gathered in the corridor outside the dingy flat wherein Major Blenkinsop lurked. The brevet captain of the entourage rapped on the door, thrice, before the more brutish and sullen members of the entourage kicked it down and stomped into the flat, roaring their heads off and unleashing a flock of half-starved starlings to sow havoc and confusion. Thus was the necessary atmosphere created for Prince Fulgencio's entrance. He had come to have breakfast with the Major, and wanted to eat his cornflakes and doughballs while watching starlings peck the wallpaper off the walls. That was the kind of Prince he was, especially at breakfast time.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Singalonga Stamp Cancellation\n", "completion": " Your favourite radio programme, Hooting Yard On The Air, will be six years old next month. As happens from time to time, I have been pondering whether or not to change the theme tune, which, since very early in the show's run, has been the \"Caucasian Lullaby\" by Slapp Happy & Henry Cow, from the Desperate Straights album of 1975. When I mention to people that I am considering a change, I am almost invariably met with gasps of horror, as if by dumping the eerie lullaby in favour of something else I would be doing violence to a well-loved national institution, much as if I were to throw pebbles at Stephen Fry. So there is every likelihood the sixth anniversary will come and go without any change whatsoever.

{"prompt": "Punter Hoonjaw\n", "completion": " On 31st January, we had cause to mention the science fiction author Punter Hoonjaw, in a copy of whose potboiler Attack of the Zargons from Planet Git was found the anonymous \"Captain Cake\" manuscript to which Dobson devoted so much impenetrable verbiage. There are those who say that Hoonjaw (1904-1993) is a justly neglected figure, but today is the centenary of his birth, and here at Hooting Yard we wish to mark it.\nGiven that he died an octogenarian, it is surprising to learn that Hoonjaw's active career as a writer lasted just six years: his first published story, Dick Dazzle And The Intergalactic Toothpaste Horror, appeared in Inexplicable Yarns Magazine in 1937. Following the publication of his novel The Fiendish Plasma Goo From Outer Space in 1943, Hoonjaw lapsed into silence, and wrote not another word in the half-century until his death. Yet between those two landmarks, he was one of the most prolific writers in history. The sci-fi expert Dr Gavin Foddal, when attempting to produce a catalogue raisonee, estimated that Hoonjaw wrote over seven hundred full-length novels, eighty-odd novellas, and an astonishing four thousand, two hundred and ninety seven short stories. Today, not a single one of the millions of words he wrote is in print. Perplexingly, one will search in vain in secondhand bookshops for any of his work, and the original manuscripts--written in longhand with a fat fountain pen in exquisite copperplate--were all destroyed. In 1957, the by now ex-author set fire to the warehouse in which they were stored as part of an insurance scam involving a gang of ruthlessly violent Bolivian thugs and a mysterious figure known only as \"Henry\". That this may have been the self-styled \"Doctor\" Henry Kissinger, later to become President Nixon's National Security Adviser, is clearly a load of flapdoodle.\nThe paperback which harboured the \"Captain Cake\" text has itself vanished from a filing cabinet in the Dobson Building on the Blister Lane Bypass. It is a most curious state of affairs.\n\nLeft : Punter Hoonjaw. Right : \"Henry\" -- a vague resemblance to Kissinger.\n###"}

The signs of this selectiveness were the wide spaces between the huts; their decorum in colour and lack of fantasy in architecture; and the absence of radios (though the loudspeaker was still young), and the quality and size of the cars arriving at week-ends; and the good-quality plus-fours of the younger set. They were, in fact, of the class most disliked by my guardian, mostly prosperous shopkeepers, with a sprinkling of teachers, whom he also didn't like. It fairly pleased him not to like anyone in the camp except a certain scoutmaster. This was the quintessence of scoutmasters, and I feel certain he came from Roehampton, because of a particular greenhouse wildness in his appearance (I caught him acquiring a tropical tan artfully behind a bush once). He liked to stand most erect on the brow of the plateau and scan the horizon, eyes narrowed, ready, I believe, for eventualities.\n###"}

His nickname \"The Forest of Incandescent Bliss\" was given to him by his godfather, the Chinese Nationalist leader Sun Yat Sen; it is a Chinese pun on \"Paul Linebarger\". He wrote his sci-fi under the pseudonym \"Cordwainer Smith\". Disappointingly \"Paul 'Forest of Incandescent Bliss' Linebarger\" never appeared on book covers because he had a respectable day job devising pyschological warfare techniques for the American army:\n\"While in Korea, Linebarger masterminded the surrender of thousands of Chinese troops who considered it shameful to give up their arms. He drafted leaflets explaining how the soldiers could surrender by shouting the Chinese words for love, duty, humanity, and virtue--words that happened, when pronounced in that order, to sound like I surrender in English. He considered this act to be the single most worthwhile thing he had done in his life.\"\n\"The Forest of Incandescent Bliss\" is a marvellous nickname, almost on a par with the title adopted by ex-President Mbuto of Zaire, who, in the 1970s, dubbed himself \"The All-Powerful Warrior Who Because Of Endurance And An Inflexible Will To Win, Will Go From Conquest To Conquest Leaving Fire In His Wake\".\n###"}

But he did not complain. He showed fortitude. I was encamped at Fort Hoity, he said to himself, and then at Fort Toity, so it is only meet that, in forts, I show fortitude. No wonder Tarleton was showered with petunia petals by adoring peasants. There remain a few petals in his hair, for it is a long time since he shampooed it.\nIt is a long time, too, since last he stood upon this balcony, eating a plum. It is so long ago that he only dimly remembers. More vivid are the memories of Fort Hoity, with its ostriches and bandages and zinc, and Fort Toity, with champions arrayed along the crenellations, and games of spit-in-the-gutter. It was between forts that Tarleton lost his leg to a crocodile.\nIn the middle ages, returning crusaders brought with them the embalmed bodies of crocodiles, which were wrapped in chains and hung from the ceilings of cathedrals. Tarleton did not think of his gouging and hewing as a crusade, but it was, oh it was.\nHe spits out the plumstone into the palm of his hand, makes a fist, and, taking careful aim, tosses it over the edge of the balcony down into the shallow pool around the fountain.

Eel Zzub was the way to go--at least until I woke up.\nI would add two points, which may or may not be pertinent. First, it was resoundingly clear, in the dream, that the Eel of Eel Zzub was nothing whatsoever to do with eels. Second, in my waking state I could not help but recall that Zzub Books was a wholly fictitious publisher of slim volumes of twee verse, invented by Ed Baxter and listed in one of the Small Press Yearbooks circa 1990.\n###"}

Now I learn, somewhat belatedly, that the BBC has launched a \"Hot Shoes\" initiative. First the furniture, now the clothes. What will be the next hot thing?\nHere at Hooting Yard we always try to keep one step ahead of the latest management thinking, so we tasked Mrs Gubbins to come up with a list of hot thing initiatives. Being an octogenarian crone, La Gubbins baulked at the use of \"tasked\" as a verb, but we fed her a bowl of gravy pudding and offered to help find that knitting needle she mislaid, and she soon came on board.\nShe initially decided to set up a working party to originate and assess various hot ideas, but this was felt to be crass, until it dropped the \"working party\" title and renamed itself as an \"ideas silo\". The silo has a hub with radii, each radius has a directional pointing device, and at the end point of each is a \"brain crate\". Responsibility for sifting through the crates rests with Mrs Gubbins herself, in between her core activities of knitting tea cosies and taking naps.\nAs a result of her first such sift, Hooting Yard will shortly be launching a series of hot initiatives entitled \"Hot Pencil Sharpeners\", \"Hot Carpets\", \"Hot Puddings\" and \"Hot Peter Wyngarde Monogrammed Cravats\".

It has been suggested that White was rather selectively quoting Lightfoot, and there are arguments to be had. But let us not get into a kerfuffle about it. Clearly the important thing is that God knew what time it was, on what day, in what month, of what year. Being majestic and subtle and ineffable, He did not proclaim the beginning of all things as \"Year Zero\", as the tiresomely literal-minded Pol Pot did, in spite of a French university education. I think we can all be grateful that the universe, with all its kinks and crooked timbers, was created by a mischievous beardy rascal and not by that Cambodian psychopath.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Film Studies\n", "completion": " From his exile in a pompous land, reader Mike Jennings very kindly alerts me to a newly published film studies textbook from the University of Ulm:\n\nThe title translates as Oi Mate! Are You Looking For A Punch In The Face? : Horst Gack and the Cinema of Belligerence. The first study dedicated to the visionary director of \"Goats and Ogres: A Film from the Hillsides\", \"Revenge of the Pig\" and \"The Fatal Duckpond\". This thumping tome collects together essays by some of the most incisive and rigorous minds of Teutonic academia. Unfortunately all the contributors have chosen to remain anonymous following reports that Horst Gack's mysterious wife and collaboratrix Primrose Dent is \"not best pleased\" with the book. We know not why, but then she is an international woman of mystery, so her motivations and manias are forever hidden from the public gaze.\nWhat is most startling about the book is that it completely avoids the sort of obfuscatory postmodernist verbal diarrhoea that besmirches so many academic texts these days. The formidable German intellects who have turned their brainpower towards the films of Horst Gack do so in prose so plain and simple it can be understood by tiny tots. This passage, from an essay entitled \"The Use Of Smudged Camera Lenses In Revenge Of The Pig\", is typical. It was translated for Hooting Yard by our old pal Fatima Gilliblat:\n\"See the pig. See the pig in black and white. See the pig blurred. See the pig go from the sty to the barn. See the clouds louring. See the rain falling. Hear Horst Gack cry \"Cut!\" Hear Primrose Dent cry \"No, don't cut yet!\" Hear a kerfuffle. See the camera fall off its tripod. Hear imprecations and threats. See Horst Gack stomp off to lock himself in his trailer. See the pig emerge from the barn and roll in the muck. See Primrose Dent channelling the spirit of Leni Riefenstahl. See the rain continue to pour down relentlessly until darkness falls.\"\n###"}
{"prompt": "Candide Camera\n", "completion": " The other day the BBC Parliament channel showed a repeat of the general election coverage from February 1974. This is precisely the kind of thing I can watch, avidly, for hours. I rarely essay political topics here at Hooting Yard, but when not engaged in high level research into matters Dobsonian or limning the contours of Bodger's Spinney or whatever else I prattle on about, I can be a terrible political pointyhead. There is a special fascination with old archive footage--the haircuts, the fruity pronunciation, the clunking technology, the on-screen fug of tobacco smoke, the impossibly youthful appearance of people still in the public eye, the phantoms of those who are dead and gone...\nOf many treasurable moments, one in particular stood out for me. Jeremy Thorpe was down in his Devon constituency, on camera yet speaking to the London studio via a large green telephone receiver clutched tight against his ear, and as he signed off he said he was planning to spend the weekend doing lots of gardening before returning to the fray on Monday. Back in the studio, Alastair Burnet said, very casually, \"Jeremy Thorpe there, very Voltairean... now, some more results...\"\nI cannot imagine any presenter today making that comment, either because they wouldn't be capable of doing so, or, if they were, it would be considered too obscure a reference for the viewers, who need to be treated like slow-witted infants.\nI will, of course, be glued to the screen for hours come the forthcoming election, and will enjoy every minute of the coverage. But if any reference at all is made to anything outside the hermetically-sealed world o' Westminster, it will be to an airhead \"celebrity\" rather than to an Enlightenment philosophe.\n###"}

He is a nylon wonder of the world.\nThe Nylon Duke is pulled along, flat on his back, on a cart, by a great grey drayhorse with its bright and battering sandal, from village to village. At each stop along the way, in villages leafy or otherwise, he is hoisted upright by a system of winches and pulleys. The villagers gather and gasp and gawp at the sight of the Nylon Duke. They bring offerings of potatoes and similar root vegetables, piled high on the cart before being transferred into sacks by the Nylon Duke's attendants. These attendants are not made of nylon.\nElsewhere, there is a Nylon Duchess, and there may be a Nylon Dauphin, and there are even rumours of a Nylon Dunce. But in this land there are not enough great grey drayhorses to pull them on carts around villages. A Dearth Of Drayhorses is an oft-reprinted tract which goes some way to explaining this situation.\nConsider the Nylon Duke in the round, in all his pomp and finery and nylonosity.

{"prompt": "Pod Person From Porlock\n", "completion": " For readers unfamiliar with the person from Porlock, here is the gist of the story. In 1797 Samuel Taylor Coleridge was staying at a farmhouse near Porlock in Somerset. One day he was reading about Kubla Khan, but--having taken his habitual dose of opium--he fell asleep and had a vivid dream. As soon as he woke up, he had a lengthy poem clear in his mind, famously beginning \"In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree...\" He started to write down the words in his head, but was \"called out by a person on business from Porlock, and detained by him above an hour.\" By the time Coleridge got back to his desk, the dream was forgotten, and the visionary poem remained incomplete.\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge (left) and Ringo Starr (right), flanking a map showing the town of Porlock\nDobson had a theory that the person from Porlock was in fact a Pod Person from some other, uncanny universe, sent as an emissary to Coleridge for reasons we can only guess at. The pamphleteer carried out a number of experiments in an attempt to summon the Pod Person, many of which ended up with him being taken to Casualty. Even when he managed to escape injury, neighbours became so vexed by various banging, hammering, wheezing, snorting, thudding and high-pitched whistling noises issuing from Dobson's hovel that the police were called to give him a ticking off.\nOn one famous occasion Dobson actually travelled to Porlock and accosted people in the streets, accusing them of being Pod People. He was hounded out of town by ruffians and never returned. Oddly enough, he never wrote any pamphlets about the matter, and it has been left to the octogenarian film director James Paste to bring it to wider attention. Paste's drama-documentary Dobson And The Pod Person From Porlock is currently in pre-production. Rumour has it that Ringo Starr has been signed up, but for which role--Dobson, Coleridge, or the Pod Person (or perhaps all three)--is not yet known.\n###"}
{"prompt": "For Want Of Fitting Audience\n", "completion": " \"Nearly every Roman indeed had qualified himself before he was fifty to be a candidate for the Travellers' Club; and sometimes the fine gentleman, who declined taking an active part in public affairs, found himself unexpectedly a thousand miles from home, with an imperial rescript in his portmanteau enjoining him not to return to Rome without special leave.\n\"To such a compulsory journey was the poet Ovid condemned, apparently for his very particular attentions to the Princess Julia. His exile was a piece of ingenious cruelty. He was sent to Tomi, which was far beyond the range of all fashionable bathing-places. The climate was atrocious; the neighbourhood was worse; the wine was execrable and was often hard frozen, and eaten like a lozenge, and his only society was that of the barracks, or a few rich but unpolished corn-factors, who speculated in grain and deals on the shores of the Euxine. To write verses from morn to dewy eve was the unfortunate poet's only solace; and he sent so many reams of elegies to Rome, that his friends came at last to vote him a bore, and he was reduced, for want of fitting audience, to learn the Getic language, and read his lacrymose couplets to circles of gaping barbarians.\"\nWilliam Bodham Donne, Old Roads And New Roads (1852)\n###"}

The sun was always shining, the weather was always balmy, and the other animals in the meadow--birds and insects and burrowing moles--were happy and contented. Of course it was a completely artificial and unnatural meadow, quite unlike real nature, which is bloody and gruesome and utterly horrifying, full of violence and pain and death. Just ask a sheep. Sheep know. That is why they barely get a wink of sleep, they are so frightened and fretful.\nAnyway, tinies, one day Popsy the Pony was having a lovely time in the lovely meadow when, all of a sudden, this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion of reality ... no, let me rephrase that ... this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion of the hidden, Lovecraftian, true reality beyond our puny human comprehension, and Popsy the Pony was slobberingly devoured by an enormous squid from the Black Pit of Hellish Nothingness.

{"prompt": "A Grand Plan\n", "completion": " Every so often I find myself devising grand schemes and projects. These rarely come to fruition. One that did, probably because it was modest in its ambitions, was last year's set of alphabetic postages here at Hooting Yard, where I adopted the constraint of posting twenty-six consecutive entries, entitled A through to Z. One that didn't was the plan that my pre-Wilderness Years pamphlet House Of Turps would be the first volume in a series of twenty-six. I think this scheme failed primarily because it was never clear in my then-fuddled brain how the succeeding twenty-five pamphlets were intended to relate to the first one.\nSo the likelihood is that the preposterous plot hatched this morning will remain incomplete, if indeed it is ever even begun. It occurred to me that I ought to devote my time to tippy-tapping a blog postage for every single word listed in the Oxford English Dictionary, in alphabetical order. According to Oxford Dictionaries, \"the Second Edition of the 20-volume  Oxford English Dictionary contains full entries for 171,476 words in current use, and 47,156 obsolete words. To this may be added around 9,500 derivative words included as subentries\". Since January 2007 there have been 1,607 Hooting Yard postages (this is the 1,608th) to which one can add just short of a thousand entries in the archive for the previous format between 2003 and 2006. Clearly I would be taking on a gargantuan task, particularly given that I would want each and every postage to be packed with sweeping Dobsonian paragraphs of majestic prose. Even if I confine myself to the obsolete words--a highly tempting grand plan in itself--it would take years and years of toil, quite possibly more years than remain to me on this spinning terrestrial globe.\nI may, however, make a start, in the near future. Foolhardy, I know, but then I am living in a fool's paradise, am I not?\n###"}

That was until I came upon the Scots poet Allan Ramsay (1686-1758), of whom I was only dimly aware.\nWhat happened was this. It occurred to me this afternoon that it was a matter of utmost urgency that I discover the etymology of \"frogman\", specifically whether, at any point, the word \"toadman\" had been preferred. As always happens as soon as one consults the Oxford English Dictionary, I was blown off course. My attention was caught by \"frogland\", which is defined, not unexpectedly, as \"marshy land in which frogs abound, as the Fens, Holland, etc.\" The first of a mere two citations in the OED is \"1721 RAMSAY Tartana xxxiii, May she be curst to starve in frogland fens.\"\nMy curiosity was piqued. Who was she and what had she done to deserve so awful a fate? I soon found an online edition of Allan Ramsay's Poems of 1721 and read:\nMay she be curst to starve in Frogland Fens, / To wear a Fala ragg'd at both the Ends, / Groan still beneath an antiquated Suit, / And die a Maid at fifty five to boot ; / May she turn quaggy Fat, or crooked Dwarff, / Be ridicul'd while primm'd up in her Scarff ; / May Spleen and Spite still keep her on the Fret, / And live till she outlive her Beauty's Date ; / May all this fall, and more than I have said, / Upon that wench who disregards the Plaid.\nGosh.

{"prompt": "Campion Day\n", "completion": " Today is the feast day of the Jesuit martyr St Edmund Campion. In the long ago, I attended a grammar school which bore his name. Each year, on the first of December, the school celebrated its patron saint by making all the pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 engage in a cross-country run. On a bitterly cold December morning, then, instead of sitting in a classroom poring over a Latin textbook, we would stand assembled in a field, shivering in skimpy running kit, awaiting the barked order from a teacher which would send us scurrying and squelching through mud and puddles for a seemingly interminable race.\nI was not an athletic child, and the prospect of these runs filled me with something close to despair and rage at an unfair universe. In the first year, I avoided it by remaining at home in bed, moaning weedily and convincing my parents I was suffering from a terrible malady. In the second year, I contrived to be knocked down by a car on the way to school and spent the morning in a hospital bed from which I was ejected, being unharmed, by midday. In the following three years, however, I took part in the annual cross-country run.\nWe are not talking about the real countryside here. The school was located in suburban Essex, so the \"country\" across which we were forced to scamper was a few fields and patches of scrubland in the vicinity. It was a bleak and awful landscape of mud and brambles and nettles and muck. pitted with puddles, often beset by driving rain and howling winds.

{"prompt": "The Encyclopaedia of Unnecessary Knowledge\n", "completion": " Jasper Poxhaven has claimed that Dobson had as many unrealised or aborted projects as there were published pamphlets--and we know how numerous they were! Perhaps the most ambitious of these abandoned works is the gargantuan Dobson's Illustrated Encyclopaedia Of Unnecessary Knowledge. From notes scrawled higgledypiggledy in various notebooks, we know that the projected work was to extend to forty thick volumes of tiny, tiny print, with upwards of twenty thousand articles containing millions of words. Some of the pieces were indeed written and appeared as pamphlets, but until recently it was thought none of the proposed illustrations were ever executed. At a Port of Tongs jumble sale, however, Mrs Gubbins' nephew happened upon a cardboard box full of detritus, buried in which were three drawings. Subjected to tremendously exciting forensic analysis by a scientist known only to Jasper Poxhaven as \"man with unwashed hair\", the pictures have now been authenticated. They were drawn by Marigold Chew to accompany three of Dobson's encyclopaedia articles; alas and alack, not one of the three was ever written. We are proud to publish the pictures here, together with Mr Poxhaven's brief notes. We have given each its own Hooting Yard paragraph-break, because that's the kind of thing we do, especially on Wednesdays.\n\nIt is possible that some trace of Dobson's text for this article can be found in his pamphlet How And Why I Built Eight Small Papier Mache Brontosauruses.\n\nIt is unclear what Dobson meant by the title of this proposed article. Ms Chew's illustation is similarly perplexing. I have applied for a grant which will allow me to devote the next four years to unravelling the mystery.\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Perking Up\n", "completion": " It is rare for an entire fortnight to pass in complete silence here at Hooting Yard, but that is what has happened. It is a sorry state of affairs and I cannot blame it entirely on the aforementioned loss of my mojo. Clearly what is needed is for me to PERK UP. To this end, I have been working my way through a self-help regime entitled PERKING UP. I will not go into the details of what this consists of, as I do not want you lot to be overcome with waves of nausea, spiritual despair, and the withers. Suffice to say that I went to the nearest grocery kiosk and obtained a supply of plums, and on my way home I walked widdershins around the kirk several times. More than that I had best not say, for the time being.\nWhile my PERKING UP begins to take hold, there are a couple of small matters to bring to your attention. First is the dearth of memorable utterances thus far from the commentators at the foopball World Cup. I had hoped to bring you a torrent of inanities, but alas there is little to report. Perhaps worth noting was one pundit's observation that \"He's a very talented foopballer--he knows where the goal is\". But really the tournament has been something of a disappointed to date, with nothing to match such past gems as \"For a moment there, he looked like a baby gazelle who'd just plopped out of the womb\".\nSecond, I am delighted to draw to your attention this newly-released podcast from Resonance104.4FM.

The resulting arc is spread by powerful electro-magnets, so.' And he illustrated with his eight acid-stained fingers. 'Spread out like a disk or sphere of flame, of electric fire, you see.' 'Yes, and what then?' demanded Flint, while his partner, forgetting now to smile, sat there by the window scrutinizing him.

{"prompt": "Gish 'n' Wasps\n", "completion": " In a comment on Googie 'n' Bee, R. writes: I think there could be some useful mileage in Lilian Gish + wasps, too. I am afraid to say that this demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the connections between stars of the silver screen and the sorts of insects that buzz and fly and sting, the Aculeate Hymenoptera.\nA modicum of research reveals a plethora of anecdotal material linking Googie Withers with bees. Much of this is hearsay, and some of it is undoubtedly fictitious, merely the product of fuming brains careening pell-mell into poltroonery for want of any more useful employment. Nevertheless, bloody good anecdotage should never be discounted entirely, as Dobson once said, at a picnic.\nConversely, conversely, say it again daddy-o, you will wander the world for umpteen years before you ever come upon a reliable Gish-wasp story.\nNow, useful mileage there may be if we are talking about Tallulah Bankhead and hornets, or Nova Pilbeam and German wasps, or even Vilma Banky and bees. In the latter case we even have a story involving ectoplasmic bee goo, though it has been suppressed by Vilma Banky's estate, for understandable reasons.\nI hope that makes things clear.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Whither Blenkinsop?\n", "completion": " Whither Blenkinsop? It is a question I have asked myself, oh, dozens of times in the past fortnight. That was when I last saw him, the titanic blob of a man, as he trundled away from me aboard his self-constructed space-age uber-tractor, heading, he said, for the Big Disused Radish Cannery near Crapwing. So far as anybody knows, he never arrived. His vehicle, uncannily riddled with what looked like age-old rust, was found in a thicket, as if deliberately concealed by a malefactor. A boot which may have belonged to Blenkinsop lay in the muck a few yards away. There were signs that an attempt had been made to remove the bootlace, which was splattered with stains of an unknown and possibly extra-terrestrial substance of fabulous blue. Mordant herons, gathered in a clump nearby, seemed to be suffering the ill-effects of this goo, whatever it was. Then, on Thursday, the night editor of the Daily Spasm took delivery of a parcel. It had been inexpertly-wrapped in corrugated cardboard and smelled of pig. Reluctant to divulge the contents, the newshound handed it to the police, who sent it to their forensic laboratory, which burned to the ground the next day, when a rookie lab assistant carelessly discarded a not-quite-spent lucifer in a wastepaper basket containing a petri dish of something monstrous, invisible and volatile concocted by the evil experimentalist Dr Turp, who had inveigled his way into the lab through a combination of charm and cunning. Now, it is known that Dr Turp once belonged to the same hat-collecting club as Blenkinsop. For this reason alone, he was taken into custody by the doughty Inspector Brazilnut on the day after the fire. This morning I purchased a railway ticket, and in a few minutes I shall board the train to Crapwing, where I shall confront Dr Turp as he stands arraigned in the dock of the assizes, and I shall blow his brains out with a fat and shiny pistol.\n###"}

Examining legal proceedings taken against \"snails, flies, mice, moles, ants, caterpillars, &c.\", Baring-Gould gives us the precise wording recommended when one wishes to excommunicate such vile creatures. This was drawn up by Bartholomew de Chasseneux, \"a noted lawyer of the sixteenth century\". Please note that you should always bring your case against creepy-crawlies and vermin before the ecclesiastical rather than the civil courts.\nThe correct form of excommunication is as follows: \"O snails, caterpillars, and other obscene creatures, which destroy the food of our neighbours, depart hence! Leave these cantons which you are devastating, and take refuge in those localities where you can injure no one. I.N.P., &c.\"\nIt is unclear to me whether that \"&c.\" indicates simply the reading of the Lord's Prayer--\"I.N.P.\" standing for \"In Nomine Patris\"--or whether there are further animadversions and anathemas to follow.

The extremity of its unvirtue consisted, observe, mainly in the quantity of instruction which was abused in it. It showed that the persons who produced it had seen everything, and practised everything ; and misunderstood everything they saw, and misapplied everything they did.

{"prompt": "Water-Parties\n", "completion": " There are many ways of arranging a water-party at yachting stations and at all riverside places. At yachting stations, for instance, a sailing yacht is hired to convey a party of from eighteen to twenty-five to some point of interest on the coast, in which case luncheon and tea are provided at an hotel in the vicinity of the place where the party have landed, and the expenses are equally divided. Not unfrequently, on the return journey, the yacht is becalmed, and does not reach its destination until between two and three the following morning. If it happens to be a fine moonlight night, this prolongation of a water-party is an additional source of enjoyment; but if there is no moon as well as no wind, and the calm betokens a storm, it is the reverse of pleasant. But these little contretemps, when they do occur, rather lend a zest to the day's pleasure, and are something to talk about afterwards.\nfrom Manners And Rules Of Good Society, Or Solecisms To Be Avoided by A Member Of The Aristocracy (1916)\n###"}

We have exhausted them. We are left, then, with three choices.\nWe may lapse into silence. This is a strategy much favoured by anchorites and hermits and some saints and saintly persons. I have, myself, been described as a Diogenesian recluse, and not without good reason.\nWe may resort to barbaric grunting. This seems to be a popular choice among many of the shuffling scowling denizens of my bailiwick. Whenever I go sashaying forth--for even a recluse must sashay forth from time to time--I hear more grunts than words. But where once I thumbed my nose in patrician contempt at those grunters, now I understand that they have been reduced to their barbarism because they have used up all the words in the dictionary, from A to Z. They reached the end.\nWe may invent new words. We may coin new sounds. Glogscheen, snup, parapapahooft, swarfoogie. Some might say we are thus babbling nonsense. Others would counter that our nonce-words are divinely inspired, that we are \"speaking in tongues\". Once towards the end of the last century, I sat in a hall in a meeting of the religiously devout, several of whose members loomed over me and so spoke in tongues, to cure me of my woes. Those woes are past, and I may doubt that incoherent babbling was the cause of their passing, but can I ever be sure?\nThere is a fourth choice. When we reach the end of the dictionary, we turn back to the beginning, where each and every word awaits us anew.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Climb Every Mountain\n", "completion": " Ford every stream. Follow every rainbow, with a cutlery canteen, just as any good Victorian explorer would do. Those people knew precisely how to equip themselves for their often arduous journeys. Here, for example, is some advice from H H Johnston's Hints On Outfit of 1889: \"I cannot too strongly recommend all travellers to supply themselves with quantities of light literature. By 'light' I do not mean frivolous in character, but devoid of great material weight, so that it can be easily packed and readily transported. There are a great many standard works now published in cheap editions in paper covers, and these, together with a supply of good novels, sensational tales, old magazines, and reviews, should be taken. It is astonishing with what pleasure [the traveller] will peruse the veriest rubbish in the wilderness, and really crave for anything that may serve to distract his mind at times from the savagery around him.\" Utilitarian to a fault. Equally diverting is the strangely assorted cargo taken, a hundred years before, by Jean-Pierre Blanchard and his pals on the first Channel crossing by hot air balloon: a barometer and compass, thirty pounds of ballast, flags, anchors, cork jackets, a packet of pamphlets, a bottle of brandy, some biscuits and apples, two useless silk-covered aerial oars, an equally useless rudder, and a moulinet--a sort of hand-operated revolving fan with no apparent purpose.

So I commented:\nMr Hitchens : I really must take issue with your use of the word \"backpack\". It ill becomes you. \"Backpack\" is a barbaric neologism used by young persons, often those on so-called \"gap years\". In future, please ensure you use one of the three--yes, three!--acceptable alternatives, \"rucksack\", \"haversack\", or--my personal preference--\"knapsack\".\nThese words of wisdom are awaiting moderation, but I hope to see them appear soon.

On the face of it, the answer to that question seems self-evident. How else would one describe the club-footed young gal, pootling about in her clapped-out jalopy, puffing away at cheroots, essaying deeds of matchless valour, and giving a variety of malefactors a good kicking? Yet such were the constraints imposed by society on what was deemed seemly, Tiny Enid oftbetimes made great pretence of being a helpless weedy flibbertigibbety waif, ready to swoon away or throw a fit of the vapours. Sometimes she put on such a show even while performing one of her brave deeds. In this picture, for example, it looks as if Tiny Enid is about to topple from a hot air balloon basket, and is being saved by a pair of tender-hearted ruffians. She is, of course, acting out the part expected of her in a patriarchal culture. What is actually happening here is that Tiny Enid is cleverly distracting the ruffians--card-carrying members of the Communist Party, no less!--for, moments after the sketch was completed, she was back in the basket, her big black boot stamping on the neck of one ruffian while the other flung himself overboard in a cowardly escape from the tot's righteous wrath.\n\nPicture courtesy of Agence Eureka\n###"}

They went on a voyage north, until they encountered pack ice. The bewitching floozie was skilled in the mariner's arts, but even she pooh-poohed pack ice. They turned back and sailed for home and the hop. Blodgett in his entrancement had been commanded to keep the ship's log, and as they came into harbour the floozie snatched it from his hands and with a twist of one turquoise earring magnet she released him from her spell. They walked arm in arm from the harbour to the hop and danced the night away. Blodgett remembered nothing. He was astonished, years later, passing through the town near the bog, to find in a chandlery bargain bin the ship's log, in his distinctive curlicued handwriting.

To travel alone with the Primordial cannot but be solemn. The moon is of the hue of the glow-worm; and Night of the sepulchre. Nux bore not less Thanatos than Hupnos, and the bitter tears of Isis redundulate to a flood. At three, if a cab rolls by, the sound has the augustness of thunder. Once, at two, near a corner, I came upon a priest, seated, dead, leering, his legs bent. One arm, supported on a knee, pointed with rigid accusing forefinger obliquely upward.

They appear to be alike in many respects, except for the fact that Tull! contestants would have no use for such phrases as \"Field of Dreams\" or \"Table for Five\", since the object of the game was to torment one's opponent beyond the point of exhaustion with old Jethro Tull album titles. A typical opening gambit might be, \"Heavy Horses\", prompting the reply \"Songs from the Wood\". \"Minstrel in the Gallery\" would very likely follow, then maybe \"Thick as a Brick\" or \"Too Old To Rock n Roll, Too Young To Die\", until, as with Costner!, someone would inevitably play the trump card: in this case, \"Aqualung\". Whoever managed to dredge up the most examples of codpiece-wearing, standing-on-one-leg-style flute-infested tomfoolery was declared the winner. Indeed, perhaps the two games are more closely connected than previously imagined, since Ian Anderson of the Tull was renowned for his \"interesting\" stage gear of medieval tights and pointy boots--an outfit later modelled to no good effect by our Kevin in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.\nI beg to remain, etc etc,\n  Max Decharne\n###"}

Yesterday on your website I was intrigued to read about ichor, alongside the piece on sieves and basins in which you kindly reprinted my letter. This got me to wondering--if I poured ichor into a basin through a sieve, would there be any residue in the sieve, and if so, what would it be?\nTempting though it is to ignore Mr De Burhg's [sic] witterings, and throw some more pebbles at starlings and crows, I have been told he is a fearsome litigant and will probably take me to court if I do not address his latest question.\nIn order to pour a quantity of ichor through a sieve into a basin, you would first have to wound, lacerate, or perhaps apply leeches to an immortal Ancient Greek deity. This is no easy task. I would go so far as to say it is impossible. But for the sake of argument, let us say you manage to waylay a passing God on a footpath. You poke at it with a spike and draw ichor, and collect the ichor in a small bowl held under the wound. We shall assume that the God is so surprised by your attack that it does not immediately smite you with divine retribution.\nLeaving the Deity crumpled by the wayside, you scuttle off to the patch of ground hidden behind a pile of rocks where you have earlier stored your sieve and basin. You pour the ichor from the bowl through the sieve into the basin, and you note that there is not a trace of residue left in the sieve. Being an ethereal divine fluid, ichor by definition contains no impurities which would get snagged within the lattice of the sieve.\nI trust that answers your foolish query, Mr De Burhg [sic].

Between 1952 and 1958, the library was staffed entirely by frightful clowns in full traditional clown costume, as part of a \"social engineering experiment\" conducted by the Blotzmannite head librarian, one Barb Crutch. She never made clear the purpose of her scheme, nor indeed its results. She died in the Munich Air Disaster, puzzlingly, for no one ever discovered what connection she had with the Busby Babes, and her replacement as head librarian quietly dropped the clown business. One Tuesday morning in March 1958, she tricked all the staff into thinking they were going on a charabanc outing, and once they were all aboard, she persuaded the driver to take them to a big top erected on a piece of land reserved for government nerve gas tests.

In the 1770s, he published, anonymously, the Wolfenbuttel Fragments, essays by the (deceased) Professor of Oriental Languages at Hamburg, Reimarus, questioning the status of miracles recounted in the Bible.\nHis skepticism in this regard means Lessing is one of the few European thinkers who has a ditch named after him.

That Sister Hortense / She makes no sense / Mother Superior / Said \"Get thee hence!\" sang the novitiates as they queued in the canteen for their jugged hare and creeping jenny. Sister Hortense turned a deaf ear, but she could not ignore the blandishments of the grubby old Catholic sea dog who lay sprawled in a heap outside the convent gate on that fateful day in April. He had come for alms: he left with Sister Hortense. He took her away with him to sea, and she followed willingly, and when he fell overboard after an accident with a topgallant shroud as the ship approached the Arctic Circle, she gave not one whit of a thought to returning to the convent. She prayed; she said her novenas; she drank rainwater; and two weeks later she hove into port, who knows what port it was, gave the barquentine a lick of paint, stocked up on provisions, renamed the boat the SS Our Lady of Lachrymose Convulsions, and sailed away. Auks and skuas shrieked, and a guillemot swooped low over the poop deck.

{"prompt": "The Bats Of Remorse\n", "completion": " \"The Bats of Remorse hang upside down in the Cave of Grief.\" Discuss.\nModel Answer : It is a fact of nature that bats, sometimes many hundreds of them, hang upside down in caves. The author is making use of this image to comment upon human frailty, specifically the emotionally disruptive lacerations of remorse and grief. Bats are linked with remorse, the cave with grief. As we read and digest the phrase, tears well up in our eyes, and we begin to sob. Our past griefs may come tumbling back inside our heads, the inside of the head very much like a cave, if we think of the skull as stone, with crags and dents. The flutterings we feel inside it, synapses snapping as we are racked by remorse, can be thought of as bats swooping in to the cave to take up their perches. Once in place, they hang there twitching occasionally, just as the lashings of remorse twitch within the porale of grief. Crucially, the writer is implying that when we stop blubbing like girlies, and dry our eyes, and grasp our Alpenstock in readiness for a healthy hike in the mountains to wash all this mawkish drivel out of our heads, the bats remain hanging there, upside down within. They do not go away. The lesson is self-evident, and is imprinted upon our consciousness, even when we are atop the mountain, panting, buffeted by a high freezing wind.\nNote : Extra points will be awarded to those who correctly identify the text as a line from Dennis Beerpint's magisterial piece Versified Outpourings From The Batcave, recently reissued by Twee Threnodies Ltd.\n###"}

If you would be sure to be successful, you will ask your friend to help you watch the flame, and you will even ask him to lift the omelette gently so that the rhum may be poured all over it until the whole of the alcohol contained in the liquor is burned out.\nI might add that taking a spoon without any ceremony is easier said than done, but my remarks on that will have to wait for our series on spoons and ceremonies, which is forthcoming.\n###"}

In view of possibilities so dreadful, surely it is a duty that a man owes to his kind to disseminate the truth, if he can, about the present condition of that reptile which, crawling on its belly and eating dust and having its head bruised by the descendants of Eve, sometimes pays off her share of the curse on their heels.\" -- E H Aitken, Concerning Animals & Other Matters\n###"}
{"prompt": "Two Important Birthdays\n", "completion": " In spite of that little grumble in today's first item, never let Hooting Yard be accused of being out of touch with popular culture. It's just that we're discriminating in what we pay attention to. Today, for example, we celebrate the double birthday of not just one of the finest male voice icons in twentieth century cinema, but two.\nChristopher Plummer is 77 today, and decades have passed since his bizarre, strangulated, bird-like squawkings as Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt Of The Sun. I have spent hours upon hours trawling the internet to find out if a Plummermaniac has posted sound samples from the film, but to no avail. Happy birthday, Atahualpa.\nBorn on the same day two years before Plummer was Dick Van Dyke, the man who invented cockney, or possibly mockney, or whatever that accent was that he used to such powerful effect in Mary Poppins. Chim chim cheroo indeed. One little-known fact about Dick, possibly because it is entirely spurious, is that he signed a multibillion dollar deal to allow his initials to be used by the manufacturers of DVD technology. At one point, the now-ubiquitous discs were going to be called EVDs, because Chariots Of The Gods? author and wag Erich Von Daniken was asking for less money for his initials.

{"prompt": "Lamb To The Slaughter\n", "completion": " On Friday afternoon the Coroner and a respectable Jury sat on the body of a Lady in the neighbourhood of Holborn, who died in consequence of a wound from her daughter the preceding day. It appeared by the evidence adduced, that while the family were preparing for dinner, the young lady seized a case knife laying on the table, and in a menacing manner pursued a little girl, her apprentice, round the room; on the eager calls of her helpless infirm mother to forbear, she renounced her first object, and with loud shrieks approached her parent.\nThe child by her cries quickly brought up the landlord of the house, but too late--the dreadful scene presented to him the mother lifeless, pierced to the heart, on a chair, her daughter yet wildly standing over her with the fatal knife, and the venerable old man, her father, weeping by her side, himself bleeding at the forehead from the effects of a severe blow he received from one of the forks she had been madly hurling around the room.\nFor a few days prior to this the family had observed some symptoms of insanity in her, which had so much increased on the Wednesday evening, that her brother early the next morning went in quest of Dr Pitcairn--had that gentleman been met with, the fatal catastrophe had, in all probability, been prevented.\nIt seems the young Lady had been once before, in her earlier years, deranged, from the harassing fatigues of too much business.--As her carriage towards her mother was ever affectionate in the extreme, it is believed that to the increased attentiveness, which her parents' infirmities called for by day and night, is to be attributed the present insanity of this ill-fated young woman.\nThe above unfortunate young person is a Miss Lamb, a mantua-maker, in Little Queen-Street, Lincoln's-inn-fields.

As the Cameron tartan of his kilt floated to the surface he struck up with Hieland Laddie. He continued even as the man behind him was hit, dropped into the sea and sank.

The glaring exception is Obsequies For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning. A short extract has appeared, but the full text is unavailable to all but the lucky (and sensible) few who bought the pamphlet back in 1994. It was the longest tale I issued as a spineless short-run pamphlet, and also the last. Shortly after it appeared, I descended into the Wilderness Years.\nIn a few days' time I shall be heading off to foreign parts again. Rather than leave you lot enmired in the unspeakable misery of No-Hooting-Yard-Updates-Land, it occurred to me to take advantage of the WordPress feature whereby I can prepare posts and set a future date and time for automated publication. Thus I have been busy tippy-tapping the text of Obsequies ... and it will appear, one chapter per day, over the next fifteen days, starting tomorrow.\nAs ever when revisiting my stuff from long ago, I have been tempted to revise and tweak and edit, to rid the prose of infelicities and howlers and horrors. But I decided to leave this intact, almost exactly as it was when published twenty-three years ago. It might cause me--and indeed you lot--to groan from time to time, but, hey, I was younger then, and more stupid, and a hopeless drunk.\nShould any typos have crept in undetected, I am sure an eagle-eyed reader (you know who you are) will alert me to them. I will correct them when I'm back in Blighty.\nFinally, remember that you used to have to pay for this stuff, and a copy of the original pamphlet would fetch a hefty price on eBay. So please consider whacking the \"Make A Donation\" button over to your right, and shovelling some loose change in my direction. It could help pay for a wreath for the grave of poor Lars Talc, struck by lightning ...\n... Chapter One of which will appear tomorrow.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Surrealophobia\n", "completion": " I make no apology for the fact that I have become a rabid surrealophobe. We need to be careful with our terminology, however. Time was when a phobia meant an irrational fear--as in triskaidekaphobia, fear of the number 13. Nowadays, in our debased world, the -phobia suffix has come to denote little more than hatred, irrational because it is not shared by right-on Guardian reading types. Thus homophobia and Islamophobia, for instance. This is not the place to take a forensic fork to the weird interior world of Guardian readers, who are generally tolerant of absolutely everything except everything with which they disagree, which is verboten, forever and ever.\nIt must be understood, then, that I have neither an irrational fear nor hatred of surrealists. Quite the contrary. What I hate, with a loathing that seems to me entirely reasonable, is the bandying about of the word \"surreal\" to refer to the mildly out of the ordinary, or at times even the wholly ordinary.\n\"Oh wow it was surreal\", a halfwit will announce, panting with stupidity, at something or other. I have heard such exclamations yelped at sight of, for example, a minor traffic accident, a malfunctioning self-service till in a supermarket, and a cat behaving like a cat. There is not a jot of surrealism in any of these things. Anybody who thinks--let alone jabbers aloud--that there is needs the innards of their head sluiced out with a powerful antistupidity solvent.\nIt may be time to begin a campaign to Bring Back Real Surrealism, with badges and banners and marches and petitions and chance encounters of sewing machines and umbrellas on operating tables.\nNOTA BENE : Mr Key is not a surrealist.

{"prompt": "Ten Tarleton Tales--IX\n", "completion": " The Paradox of Tarleton's Pebble is a famous, or infamous, conundrum. It was first posed, not by Tarleton himself, but by his valet, the dwarf Crepusco. Legend has it that Crepusco crept into the room where Tarleton was hosting a swish and sophisticated cocktail party attended by various mountaineers, polar explorers, flappers, Jesuits, toad-headed robbers, Quakers, conjurers, reprobates, gas meter readers, spud-faced nippers, fanatics, greaseproof paper salesmen, composers, dentists, tuppenny-ha'penny tosspots, Grand Guignol performers, Chappaquiddick experts, foopball refs, tugboat captains, hedgers and ditchers, gondoliers, minstrels, troubadours, astronauts, emboldened milquetoasts, rhubarbarians, eel-men, dabblers, plotters, coppers, tanners, coopers, fletchers, tailors, tinkers, Oppidans, floozies, weathermen, mavens, bus conductors, out-of-town Pointy Towners, painters, pimps, and potters. Yes, potters. Several potters, indeed more potters than you could shake a stick at, were you minded so to do. Not for the first time, Tarleton had got the precise balance of his swish sophisticated cocktail party guest-list a little askew.\nThings were nevertheless going with a swing, in spite of the potter imbalance, when in crept Crepusco. He silenced the hubbub in his usual manner, by holding aloft the gold-painted head of an antique Italianate monkey doll, through which he ventriloquised. Then, in his horrible voice, raucous as a crow, he posed the conundrum which became known as the Paradox of Tarleton's Pebble.\nThe effect was instantaneous. The puzzle dizzied the brains of all those present, including Tarleton himself. It dizzied their brains and it also dizzied their bodies, so that the room became a scene of chaos, the guests reeling about, staggering, flailing, vomiting, and groaning.\nWell satisfied, Crepusco crept out and returned to his pantry. He replaced the head of the monkey doll on its shrine, fixed himself a snack, and sat in his rocking chair, rocking, creaking, back and forth, through the long winter evening, on the night before the Munich Air Disaster.\n###"}
{"prompt": "A New Com\n", "completion": " One might think we had enough coms to be going on with. We already have sitcoms and romcoms and divcoms and dotcoms--respectively, situation comedies, romantic comedies, The Divine Comedy by Dante, and comedies about dotterels, the small wading bird of the plover family which breeds in the arctic tundra. So it might be argued that yet another com is a com too many. Normally, I would agree, were it not that the latest com is the frackcom, a series of comedies about Old Farmer Frack. As these are chiefly written by the bestselling paperback author Pebblehead I suppose they might equally well be called pebcoms. No doubt one or other term will win out as the common usage, much as we say \"ping pong\" rather than \"gossima\", and \"lawn tennis\" rather than \"sphairistike\".\nIt could be argued that there is little humour to be found in the perpetual trudgings of a mad old farmer driving his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly, in all weathers, through all the hours god sends. In fact, that is a view I have myself favoured, as explicated thoroughly in my six-part television series Penitence And Farm Implements, which insists that farmyard life is miserable and grim and despondent and hateful and wretched and disgusting and absolutely without comic possibility. But I reckoned without the skills of Pebblehead, whose hilarious accounts of Old Farmer Frack driving his bellowing cows from field to field, pointlessly, have me slapping my sides and gasping for breath.\nThe original books, of course, are known as farmyardlit, and it is the films and TV series based upon them that are called frackcoms or pebcoms.

This biography we could make up from whole cloth or, if we preferred, we could cobble it together from snatches from the true biographies of the other Pitts, the Elder and the Younger, and, casting further afield, from the biographies of any number of not-Pitts, contemporaries, coevals, and peers. Judiciously constructed, such a book might tell us more, much more, about the world and the age of the Pitts than any existing biography of either one of them or of any of the many not-Pitts whose lives we would gut to tell of the Middling Pitt.\nOur Pitt would be a sort of invisible man, one whose presence, however vivid, is nowhere attested in the available historical record. An invisible man and also a Frankenstein's monster, into whom we breathe the spark of life. Vampire too, for never having really lived, he can never really die.

It is a valuable food, and an indispensable accessory to the culinary artist; but as used by many people it is not suggestive of refinement. And yet the bulb has not only an honourable character--it has a sort of sacred history.\n\"Both Pliny and Juvenal, among old writers, and many Egyptologists of our own time and country, have recorded that the ancient Egyptians worshipped the onion. It is true that Wilkinson, who wrote on the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, doubts the evidence of this; but he adds that the onion was admitted as a common offering on every altar, and that the priests were forbidden to eat it. In Ellis's History of Madagascar it is noted that the Malagasy of our time regard the onion as unclean, and forbidden by the idols.\"\nBut the onion can be a weapon in the fight against crime!\n\"Ovid... says that both onions and sulphur were given to criminals to purify them from their crimes, upon the old theory of purgation by fumigation.\"\nExtracts from Storyology : Essays In Folk-Lore, Sea-Lore, And Plant-Lore by Benjamin Taylor (1900)\n###"}

The flapper is accompanied in my tale by a chump (unillustrated).\nRay Bradbury wrote a famous collection of short stories called The Illustrated Man (1951), made into a film (1969) starring Rod Steiger (1925-2002). Were Mr Steiger still with us, I think I would write to him suggesting he play a character called The Unillustrated Chump. This would not be an adaptation of The Chump And The Flapper, the story in today's Dabbler, but a wholly different work, based on the boiling frustrations of a chump who, try as he might, cannot get his likeness depicted by a single illustrator. Mr Steiger did boiling frustration very well, and though he may have had difficulty playing a chump--for he was the most unchumpish of men--his training in the Method would no doubt have stood him in good stead. Alas, it is not to be.\n###"}
{"prompt": "JFK : The Unanswered Questions\n", "completion": " \nToday being the forty-first anniversary of the assassination of Potus John Fitzgerald Kennedy, it is appropriate to pose some of the questions about that day in Dallas which remain unanswered. Perhaps they are unanswerable.\nDid the citizens of Dallas refer to the grassy knoll as \"the grassy knoll\" before it became known as The Grassy Knoll, or did they call it \"a grassy knoll\" or \"that grassy knoll\", or even \"that patch of grass over there in Dealey Plaza\"? Similarly, was the white picket fence known as \"that white picket fence\" or just \"that fence\"?\nDid his family, friends and acquaintances address Umbrella Man as \"umbrella man\" prior to 22nd November 1963? The same question can be asked of Badge Man, and indeed of Marymoon Man, or, as some commentators on the assassination have it, Mary Moonman, or Moorman.\nWe know that future Potus Richard Milhous Nixon flew out of Dallas, suspiciously, on the morning of the assassination. Was he accompanied by his dog Checkers, or had Checkers already passed to The Other Side by then?\nElderly dressmaker Abraham Zapruder famously shot the Zapruder Footage on that sunny November day in Dallas. Who decided to dub it \"The Zapruder Footage\" as opposed to, say, \"The Zapruder Film\" or \"Zapruder's cinefilm\"?\nThe cinema in which Lee Harvey Oswald was apprehended was showing the film War Is Hell starring Van Heflin at the time. Was Mr Heflin part of the conspiracy, if indeed there was a conspiracy?\n\nBrain guru Tony Buzan : was he in the Texas Schoolbook Depository?\nA question with wider implications relates to the practice of assassin nomenclature. When was it decided, and by whom, that the assassins of Potuses (or Potae) should invariably be given their full three names, as in Lee Harvey Oswald and John Wilkes Booth? Why is this also accorded to the assassins of whining Liverpudlian pop singers (Mark David Chapman) but not to unsuccessful Potus assassins (John Hinckley) unless they are members of the Manson cult (Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme)? And is Sirhan Sirhan's middle name also Sirhan?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Werner Herzog Goes For A Walk\n", "completion": " For me, the story that sums up Herzog's unique world-view concerns the great German Jewish film critic Lotte Eisner, a concentration camp survivor and an early champion of his work. Eisner had lived in Paris since the war, having fled to France to escape the Nazis. In November 1974 Herzog was in Munich when he heard that she was dying. 'German cinema could not do without her now,' he declared. 'I set off on the most direct route to Paris, in full faith, believing that she would stay alive if I came on foot.' For three weeks he walked through rain and snow, without a proper map or winter clothing, trekking across muddy fields, following a straight line on his compass. 'It was like a pilgrimage,' he says. 'I would not allow her to die.' When he arrived at her bedside, Eisner was on the mend. 'Open the window,' he told her. 'From these last days onward I can fly.'\nfrom a review of The Werner Herzog Collection (BFI) in The Spectator\n###"}
{"prompt": "A Guide to Pointy Town : Part Two\n", "completion": " Yesterday we listed some of the things Pointy Town is famous for. Yet it is no Utopia. For instance, you will find in the town no trace whatsoever of quaintness, wry euphonium rehearsals, toffee, yoghurt, ululating idiots, ornithological paraphernalia, athletics, sawdust, dockyard flamboyance, gutters, hedgerows, jugglers, kissing lovers, zealous x-ray-eyed cadets, & \"Visigoth\"-brand nougat munchies. But who needs any of those things when there are great architectural marvels to be seen? One of the most striking and gigantic buildings in Pointy Town is the Old Wretched Flophouse. The principal front on the land side is considerably more than one-third of a Javan mile in length, and its wings, in depth, extend six hundred and seventy two feet, down to the edge of the Big Frightening River, this noble watercourse forming the fourth side of the quadrangle. Within the three sides (the Big Frightening River and two wings) are ranges of parallel buildings, which form the magazines, artificers' shops, mast and boat houses, offices, &c.; and in the area within these are four slips for building the largest, and two for the smaller class of Tugboats of Pointlessness. The whole of the outer range of buildings consists of lamentable suites of rooms, and long and filthily ornamented galleries, filled with the natural history and curiosities collected in every part of the globe, and brought by the different navigators which Pointy Town, of late years, has sent forth on discovery. In one room are assembled all the different nautical and mathematical instruments; in another all the models of toy brazil nuts of different nations and different eras; in another a complete library connected with every branch of both human and inhuman knowledge. The library's most treasured item is the manuscript of the first draft of Sepulveda's inane Lines Written Upon First Listening To 'Dr Bogenbroom' by Jethro Tull.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Earworm Challenge\n", "completion": " Diligent readers who commit to memory everything that I have ever written (that is, most of you) will recall that somewhere or other I bemoaned the fact that my brainpans are assailed by a persistent earworm. It is my fate to suffer, rattling around inside my bonce, day in day out, the strains of Merry Xmas (War Is Over) by Mr Lennon and Ms Ono, augmented by a choir of tinies. Why this is so, I cannot say. All I can assume is that I must have done something awful in a previous life and the gods have seen fit to torment me in a particularly cruel way.\nNow, perhaps, there is a gleam of hope. For the past week or so, the Yuletide caterwaulings of the Beatle and the woman Cornelius Cardew threw out of his house have been replaced. But my new earworm is, it has to be said, somewhat challenging. I am now beset by Henry Cow's Living In The Heart Of The Beast, which takes over a quarter of an hour to work its way through my poor cranium. This is indubitably more welcome, but I do ask myself why I can't have a snappy snippet of pop music, which is what an earworm ought to be.\nIncidentally, for those of you who care about such things, Living In The Heart Of The Beast was written (by Tim Hodgkinson) during the period of collaboration between Henry Cow and Slapp Happy. The music was given to Peter Blegvad, who was instructed to supply lyrics. He came up with something about chickens. \"This won't do at all.\" pronounced Hodgkinson, who proceeded to write his own words, of a more Marxist-Leninist bent. Shortly afterwards, Blegvad was dismissed from the merged group for \"flippancy\".\n###"}

It is, I think, a credit to his acting skills that, while one rarely, if ever, encounters myrrh in 21st century Britain, he gives a compelling performance and one truly believes that, yes, this small child does indeed have myrrh.

There is a Drugs Tsar, a Railways Tsar, a Homelessness Tsar, a Smoking Tsar, and who knows how many others. And that's only in the UK. Over in the US, where the Tsar made his comeback, the 9/11 Commission has just recommended the appointment of an Intelligence Tsar.\nBritish readers will recall that John Major, the last Conservative Prime Minister, had a bee in his bonnet about traffic cones, for some reason, and set up a spectacularly important-sounding Cones Hotline to tackle the \"problem\".

{"prompt": "Naked Somersaulting Emissaries\n", "completion": " I think the time has come for me to acquire a team of naked somersaulting emissaries...\nIn 589, a man went insane after being surrounded by flies in a forest near Arles., in France; two years later, he dressed himself in animal skins and made his way down to Gevaudon, in the Cevennes, declaring that he was Christ, and that he had the power to heal the sick... He began to accumulate an army of followers, which reached three thousand, and towns they approached were asked to acknowledge that he was Christ--which most of them did to avoid trouble. Approaching the town of La Puy, he quartered his army in halls and churches, and sent naked messengers to announce his arrival to Bishop Aurelius.\nWhen the bishop saw these emissaries turning somersaults, he had no doubt that they were inspired by the devil, so, hiding his disgust, he sent some of his men to welcome the man who called himself Christ. They bowed as if to kiss the messiah's knees, then dragged him to the ground and stabbed him to death. Without their leader, the followers quickly dispersed... but St Gregory of Tours, who records the story, adds that the messiah's followers continued to believe in him until the day they died.\nFrom The Devil's Party : A History Of Charlatan Messiahs by Colin Wilson (2000)\nWilson, who knocks out books at a Pebbleheadian rate, can't be bothered to provide us with footnotes and references (other than that allusion to St Gregory of Tours). I think by \"Gevaudon\" he means GA(c)vaudan, which, intriguingly, was terrorised by man-eating wolf-like creatures between 1764 and 1767. Could it be that, clothed in his animal skins, the fly-maddened Christ returned after twelve hundred years as the Beast of  Gevaudan? I suspect this is highly likely, for as we all know, the Lord moves in mysterious ways His flies to swat away wonders to perform.\n###"}

Students are directed to this \"rather elaborate recipe\" by the editors of Alquin, a site for students learning English as a foreign language. The assignment is as follows:\n\"Search the Internet for recipes for two of the following Victorian foodstuffs and translate the recipes into Dutch, in a way that you, or someone else, would easily be able to prepare the food. By presenting some Victorian food dishes, the actors who're in the play [an adaptation of Oliver Twist] might be even more motivated to act Victorian. Of course you could also feed them gruel, but that might not go down that well...\"\nThere follows a list of enticing grub including dumplings, black-cap pudding, 'good common cake', pickled mussels, and potted meat sandwiches. Links for each dish are provided for the students, ending with one to Hooting Yard, suggesting that they \"try to work out from this description what you need to do to make gruel\".\nMay I implore all readers, next time they find themselves eating out in the Netherlands, to order a bowl of gruel?\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Mimms. Mimmses?\n", "completion": " What with the foul and beastly vice and further spookiness at South Mimms, I admit to lying awake at night, tossing and turning, fretful that nothing of comparable import ever seemed to happen at North Mimms. One likes to think of the Mimms (Mimmses?) as equal in their attractions, albeit those attractions are largely historical. Balanced Mimms are so much easier to comprehend, within my head, than lopsided Mimms. I am going to have to consult a reference work to decide on the proper plural.\nTo my delight, I have discovered an event at North Mimms to serve as a counterweight to all that shenanigans at South Mimms. The Age Of Wonder : How The Romantic Generation Discovered The Beauty And Terror Of Science by Richard Holmes is itself a wonder of a book. Nige has a postage on it which you would do well to read. In his chapter on ballooning, Holmes tells us of the foppish Vincent Lunardi (1759-1806), a young Italian who made the first manned balloon ascent in Britain, rising from Moorfields in London on 15 September 1784. He took his cat with him. After drifting across London and over Hertfordshire, eating chicken, drinking champagne, and accidentally breaking one of his aerial oars, Lunardi noticed that the cat was numb with cold. He brought the balloon down (by paddling the oars, he claimed, which Holmes points out is impossible), and delivered the shivering cat into the hands of a no doubt nonplussed peasant girl in a field, before reascending and continuing his historic flight. And where was this field? Why, in North Mimms!\nI have not yet managed to ascertain the name of the cat, more's the pity. If any reader knows it, perhaps they would be kind enough to let me know in the Comments. You can see the cat for yourself in this portrait of Lunardi published by Edward Hodges of Cornhill just six weeks after his act of feline mercy in North Mimms.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "It's Holiday Time!\n", "completion": " Today is the first day of the Muggletonian Great Holiday, celebrated on the third, fourth and fifth of February each year. On those three days in 1652, the tailor John Reeve (1608-1658) received his commission from God, and was told that his cousin Lodowicke Muggleton (1609-1698) was to be his \"mouth\". Reeve learned that he and Muggleton were the two witnesses referred to in Revelations 11:3, and that God had empowered them to pronounce upon the fate of individuals. As Muggleton wrote in his 1663 tract The Neck of The Quakers Broken, \"He hath put the two-edged Sword of His Spirit into my Mouth, that whosoever I pronounce cursed through my Mouth, is cursed to Eternity\".\nIt was long thought that, of all the sects which sprang up in the English Civil War period, only the Quakers survived into the twentieth century. During the 1970s, however, one Philip Noakes came to light in Kent, a living Muggletonian in possession of a huge archive of material covering the sect's entire history.\nThe Muggletonians believed that human reason was unclean. This led them to reject physical science. They refused to accept the laws of gravity or the rules of mathematics, and they considered astronomy to be wrong. The stars, they said, were only as big as God made them appear from earth. In later years, Muggletonians banned hot air ballooning, because the balloons would crash into the sky, a solid band around the earth.\n\nPortrait of Lodowicke Muggleton by William Wood, circa 1674 (NPG)\nNOTE : My thanks to Andy Hopton, whose 1988 essay in Small Press Gleanings is my source--and was my introduction to the sect.\n###"}

Pins, litmus paper, zinc, gorse, pie-crusts... not even Euwige knew where Blodgett stashed everything, or how he disposed of it all.\nEuwige was relentless. She listened out for Blodgett, concealed behind parapets, shrubberies, false ceilings. She pried and spied without success. Then she questioned him directly. She tied him to a chair and shone a Toc H lamp into his eyes, puffing the smoke from her cheroot into his face. He coughed, but was otherwise uncommunicative. Later she tried wheedling and deedling, but that didn't work either. Blodgett remained wholly and uncannily silent.\nAnd still he accumulated tuning forks, dishcloths, cortisone and ironmongery, tin baths, cupcake mixture, the heads of oxen, and whisks, and still these things vanished, somehow, as if they had never existed in the first place.

{"prompt": "The Truncheon Brothers\n", "completion": " The Truncheon Brothers, Tad and Tod, were an unacclaimed act from the golden age of variety theatre. Both dressed as middle-ranking police officers, they would bound creakily on to the stage--they were of advancing years--Tad from the right and Tod from the left or, as it might be, Tod from the right and Tad from the left, and proceed to bludgeon each other about the head with their truncheons. These were lead-weighted heavy rubber truncheons as deployed by real coppers. One or other of them, Tad or Tod, would collapse unconscious to the floor first, at which point the still-conscious-but-decidedly-woozy one, Tod or Tad, would break into song, usually slurring the words due to the disorientation occasioned by the several blows to the head received. The song itself never varied. A third, non-performing brother, Gilliblat, wrote both the words and the music. The lyrics were as follows:\nI bashed my brother on the head\n  But don't you worry, he's not dead\n  We will be back tomorrow night\n  For another truncheon fight\n  We're the Truncheon Brothers, Tad and Tod\n  And we bathe in the blood of the Lamb of God\n  We take our baths offstage of course\n  Now please cheer us until you are hoarse\n  We'll pass a cap round for your cash\n  Then I'll give Tod [or it might be Tad] a final bash\nThe cap, passed around the audience by Gilliblat, rarely had any cash in it by the time it came back to him, though the Truncheon Brothers never wanted for buttons and corks and scrunched-up bits of paper.\nSource : Some Truly Awful Acts Who Appeared At Bodger's Spinney Variety Theatre, 1880-1910 by Dobson (out of print).\n###"}

Some years ago when placing the shelves round the small room, which, by a euphemism, is called my library, I took the precaution of making two self-acting ventilators which communicated directly with the outer air just under the ceiling. For economy of space as well as of temper (for lamps of all kinds are sore trials), I had a gasalier of three lights over the table. The effect was to cause great heat in the upper regions, and in the course of a year or two the leather valance which hung from the window, as well as the fringe which dropped half-an-inch from each shelf to keep out the dust, was just like tinder, and in some parts actually fell to the ground by its own weight; while the backs of the books upon the top shelves were perished, and crumbled away when touched, being reduced to the consistency of Scotch snuff.

Six and a half years have passed, and do you know, not a single one of you has bothered to respond. This is simply not good enough.

Is this a manufacturing compound where industrial funnels are brought into being, or is it rather an industrial manufacturing compound whose output happens to be funnels?\nLest I seem to be splitting hairs, I should perhaps add that the former instance might well be a case of two amiable widows occasionally meeting in, let's suppose, a disused pig-pen or similar compound where they desultorily pop a few more rivets into their long lives' work, a single immense funnel of statuesque and sturdy conception; whereas the latter case might imply a colossal foundry or other such satanic installation which churns out, in their tens of thousands, minute funnels of such a definitively non-industrial calibre that they buckle, or actually wither to dust, under the mere weight of the potential customer's scrutiny.\nR is quite right to draw attention to the ambiguity, and I am happy to clarify that the industrial funnel manufacturing compound to which I referred was indeed a disused pig-pen wherein two widows popped rivets into a single immense funnel.

They have been performing their praxis for the past year, seldom letting the beardy Smolenskian out of their sight, much as ex-UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar was pursued for years, and interrupted at press conferences, by nitwits convinced he had been abducted by aliens in Manhattan in 1989.\nDmitri and Serge are guarded about how long they intend to continue haunting Metropolitan Kirill.

Saw a worm being dragged from the soil by something much bigger than it, possibly with wings. Rang Dennis to tell him about it. He said he'd come and check, but by the time he arrived, puffed out, ten minutes later, the thing was gone, and there was no sign of the worm. Dennis said it was probably a cassowary.\nFriday. Overheard a couple of people in the park talking about sedge warblers. Later, I discovered these are a life-form which all authorities agree is a type of bird.

Now, to ring the Bells, and call the People on purpose together, would be but a blunt business; but to do it neatly, and when no Body look'd for it, that's the rarity and art of it. Suppose, then, that he takes for his text that of St. Matthew, Repent ye, for the Kingdom of God is at hand. Now tell me, Sir, do you not perceive the Gold to be in a dismal fear, to curl and quiver at the first reading of these words. It must come in thus: The blotts and blurrs of our sins must be taken out by the Aqua-fortis of our Tears; to which Aqua-fortis if you put a fifth part of Sal-Amoniack, and set them in a gentle heat, it makes Aqua-Regia, which dissolves Gold. And now 'tis out. Wonderfull are the things that are to be done by the help of metaphors and similitudes!

{"prompt": "Scrofula and Penitence in the Middle Ages\n", "completion": " Scrofula is the Latin word for brood sow, and it is the term applied to a tuberculous infection of the chain of lymph glands in the neck, creating swellings between the angle of the jaw and the top of the breastbone. It has been known to afflict people since antiquity, and during the Middle Ages was known as \"the King's Evil\", because it was thought that the monarch's touch would cure it. We may scoff at such naivete, especially given the rather disturbing personal habits of kings and queens past and present. An early scoffer was Valentine Greatrakes (1628-1666), a Cromwellian soldier during the English Civil War. In the revolutionary mood of the time, he correctly surmised that God could act through himself as well as through the royal personage, and did his own scrofula-healing by gently stroking his patients. He also applied poultices made from carrots, although it is unclear whether these were divinely inspired.\nBack in the Middle Ages, of course, when only the King was thought to be capable of curing scrofula by touch, there was also a great enthusiasm for penitence. Natural calamities of all kinds were thought to be the Terrible Judgment of an Angry God, a not unreasonable idea. Pestilence was met with penitence, rather than with carrot poultices, although perhaps I am oversimplifying. No doubt some canny peasants used both approaches.\nAnd what can we learn from this, o tiny ones? Well, if you think you have contracted scrofula, or indeed any other malady, such as Asiatic Bird Flu, a pandemic of which we are promised by world health officials, you would be well advised to repent your sins, preferably in a manner that involves the mortification of the flesh, and while doing so, grate some carrots.\nNext week, we shall take a look at Fundamentalist Aztec Sun-worshippers and Swamp Fever.\n\nA terrifically helpful diagram of the human skull.

Unstrebnodtalb was at the hangar to meet her, brandishing a trumpet. At this stage in his career, he looked not unlike a Hungarian fairground proprietor. He wore spats. He had gabbled at Euwige importunately, but his command of human languages was not good, and she had difficulty understanding him. Eventually, she had snatched the trumpet from him and beat him over the head with it repeatedly, stopping him in mid-gabble. Then she pushed him into a cart and rattled off to the House.\nNow, after all those years, they had a lot to catch up on. The walls of the Room shook as Unstrebnodtalb told his anecdotes in booming, cataclysmic roars. Jubble shoved putty into his ears to dull the racket. But Euwige seemed unperturbed, regularly refilling their tin mugs and badgering the Detective Captain with questions. What had happened to his spats? Was it true that he had arrested the notorious strangler Babinsky, and shaved off his bristly side-whiskers? Was his brain hot? Did moths fly about his head? Did he make crunching noises? Why had he not come sooner?\nUnstrebnodtalb, flicking gnats and hornets away from his head, smashed up the empty dandelion and burdock bottles with a single thwack from his huge and hairy fists.

His book on the mayfly is filled with spiritual verses and musings, as well as his magnificent drawings, like this one.\nWhile finding out more about Swammerdam, I chanced upon the marvellous Origins Of Modernity online exhibition, wherein will be found many old book illustrations on topics including alchemy & chemistry, cosmology & astronomy, literature, mathematics, natural history, natural philosophy, philosophy, physiology & medicine, political philosophy, theology & witchcraft, and travel literature.\nThe picture below is a detail from Thomas Burnet's Telluris theoria sacra.

{"prompt": "Packaging or Fighting?\n", "completion": " In Britain, the day after Christmas is known as Boxing Day. Curiously, the day after Pansy Cradledew Day has not been accorded its own name. A plenary session of the Hooting Yard Miscellaneous Matters Of Towering Importance Committee was convened to address the issue. It was swiftly agreed that a name for the post-Pansy day should be in some way related to \"boxing\", but frantic arguments raged for minutes whether the allusion was to packaging or fighting. Some members of the committee wanted to plump immediately for Wrestling Day. They were silenced when member F X Duggleby provided unassailable evidence that the \"boxing\" referred to boxes, and had not a jot nor tittle to do with contact sports.\nThis point decided, the committee went into recess, and partook of a superb lunch of shredded watercress and boiled duckpond water, then engaged in post-prandial calisthenics (think trampolines and medicine balls). Brain scans completed, the committee members shuffled back into the Big Overwhelming Hall, with its gleaming linoleum, important-looking wallpaper, and empty birdcages.\nThe afternoon session reviewed a wide variety of boxes and packaging materials, and eventually voted between two options: Big Unwieldy Crate Day or Jiffy(tm) Bag Day.

{"prompt": "Bode Code\n", "completion": " One of the more outlandish episodes in Dobson's life was the Bode Code affair. The out of print pamphleteer was facing utter penury, as usual, and hatched a particularly ill-starred money-making scheme. He had been reading the ravings of various Revelations-obsessed fundamentalist Christians, and was struck by their argument that the Number of the Beast, 666, was somehow \"hidden\" in all bar codes. Quoting Revelations 13:16--He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark in his right hand or in his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.--the conspiracy theorists demonstrated that the number appears in all UPC/EAN-13 barcode formats, whatever that might mean.\nDobson decided that if he could devise a new system, he might be able to market it to paranoid delusional Christians seeking to establish a separatist worldwide trading network. He spent months working on what he called his Bode Code, named after the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode, the man who gave the planet Uranus its name. Dobson's system was abstruse, weird, unfathomably complex, and never understood completely by anyone except its inventor. We know that it was based on the twenty satellites of Uranus, that it had no negative associations for the God-fearing, and that when he attempted to promote his system to a reclusive American billionaire fundamentalist, Dobson was chased off his property by slavering, yelping dogs.\nDobson himself was not a religious man, nor even a remotely pious one, and he soon abandoned Bode Code and found something else to occupy his magpie mind--something to do with the manufacture of swiss rolls, if I am not mistaken.\n\nLeft : a conventional barcode, wherein lurks the Number of the Beast, apparently.

The raches, roughened and furrowed down the middle with pointed spiculae, or tubercular ramifications prolonged in a straight canal, the columellar edge sometimes callous--this is the critical moment for the hapless bivalve! He seizes it with a three-pronged fork, aiding also the functions of the stomach, filled with villainous green matter, which is conical, swollen in the middle, diminished, and tapers off, producing new beings, covered with vibratile cilia, furnished with two fins, limited only by the length of the stem, but in a moment beginning to dissolve its corporation, a soft reticulated crust, or bark, full of little cavities. The hinder ones loosen their hold, with four or six rows of ambulacral pieces designated by the names compass, plumula, bristling envelope, levelled bayonets, smothered. Last come the terrible and multiplied engines of calcareous immovable thread-like cirrhi with transverse bands, many of which crumble. Sometimes they are dredged.\nADDENDUM : I note that Amazon has copies of This Fish Is Loaded for sale from $0.47.

He often had occasion to write the word because, shunning human company, he lived alone and ran a lighting-fixture advice service by post. He spent a fortune on postage stamps! Crestfallen Dan did not possess a telephone, but if he had done so it would have availed him not, because there was no telephone pole within miles upon miles of his nondescript hut. He had only a handful of correspondents, or customers, but they were exceedingly loyal to him, for Crestfallen Dan knew more about lighting-fixtures than anyone else, ever, alive or dead, and his advice was always couched in clear and simple language that even a splinterbrain could understand.

Even if the latter had been living, the scratches found on the corpse are less likely to have resulted from an attack by Moina in the form of a monster cat, than from running naked in the dark over rough country, which Miss Fornario had done immediately before her collapse.\"\nIthell Colquhoun, Sword Of Wisdom : MacGregor Mathers And 'The Golden Dawn' (1975)\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Cabinet of Doctor Calicagcag\n", "completion": " It was a stormy and hideous night. A ferocious gale uprooted sycamores, hollyhocks, and strange unearthly shrubs which grow only in Finland. Thunderclaps deafened the major domo of the orphanage. Lightning bolts blinded the crapulous Stalinist funeral director. Then came the rain, a torrential downpour unleashed by storm-clouds blacker than the blackest thing the human mind can comprehend. The temperature plummeted. Rain turned to hail, assailing with ten thousand merciless pin-pricks the pathetic figure of a man trudging through the streets of Helsinki dressed only in shirt-sleeves and boxer shorts. The man was the notorious forger, quack and charlatan Inigo Hoist. Moments before, he had been denuded of the rest of his clothing and ejected from the hovel of his concubine, who had taken exception to the odour on his breath of sour custard and hibiscus. Hoist managed to reach his doctor's surgery without being crushed by a felled sycamore. He hammered on the door, wailing desperately. At long last Doctor Calicagcag drew back the fourteen bolts on his door and let Hoist in. The good doctor was wearing a rhinoceros mask of beaten bronze. He cackled, and shoved the snivelling Hoist into his sinister cabinet. Then he began to adjust the dials on the control panel......\nTo be continued\n###"}

{"prompt": "Badger And Cherries\n", "completion": " Important news from Reuters' Berlin bureau:\nA badger in Germany got so drunk on overripe cherries that it staggered into the middle of a road and refused to budge, police said yesterday. A motorist telephoned police near the central town of Goslar to report a dead badger lying in the road--only for officers to turn up and discover that the animal was alive and well, but drunk. Police later discovered that the badger had eaten cherries from a nearby tree which had fermented and given the animal diarrhoea as well as a hangover. Having failed to scare the animal away, officers eventually used a broom to chase it from the road.\nWhat the report fails to mention is that the \"animal\" in question was Little Severin, The Mystic Badger. How in heaven's name do you think he is able to make all those devastatingly accurate mystic prognostications? Painting him as a simple drunk is a travesty. Little Severin had, of course, gorged on fermented fruit as a trusted method of inspiring a shamanistic--or rather, shabadgeristic--hallucinogenic trance. I must admit it is not entirely clear why he then chose to sprawl in the middle of an Autobahn, imperilled by the products of the mighty Teutonic car industry, rather than engage in his usual scrubbling about in the muck, but far be it from me to question the ineffable wisdom of Little Severin. After all, the last person who did so was turned into a toad, and not just a toad, but a blind toad with rickets and pins and needles. As, indeed, was foretold, by the Mystic Badger himself, during an earlier cherry binge.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Odd Family\n", "completion": " In the reign of William III, there resided at Ipswich a family which, from the number of peculiarities belonging to it, was distinguished by the name of 'the Odd Family'. Every event remarkably good or bad happened to this family on an odd day of the month, and every member had something odd in his or her person, manner, or behaviour. The very letters in their Christian names always happened to be an odd number; the husband's name was Peter, and the wife's name Raboh: they had seven children, all boys, viz, Solomon, Roger, James, Matthew, Jonas, David, and Ezekiel. The husband had but one leg, his wife but one arm. Solomon was born blind of one eye, and Roger lost his sight by accident. James had his left ear bit off by a boy in a quarrel, and Matthew was born with only three fingers on his right hand. Jonas had a stump foot and David was hump-backed. All these, except the latter, were remarkably short, while Ezekiel was six foot one inch high at the age of nineteen The stump-footed Jonas and the hump-backed David got wives of fortune, but no girls in the borough would listen to the addresses of their brothers. The husband's hair was as black as jet, and the wife's remarkably white; yet every one of the children's hair was red. The husband was killed by accidentally falling into a deep pit in the year 1701; and his wife, refusing all kinds of sustenance, died five days after him, and they were buried in one grave. In 1703, Ezekiel enlisted as a grenadier; and although he was afterwards wounded in twenty-three places, he recovered. Roger, James, Matthew, Jonas, and David, it appears by the church registers, died in different places and were buried on the same day, in 1713; and Solomon and Ezekiel were drowned together in crossing the Thames in the year 1723. Such a collection of odd circumstances never occurred before in one family.\nJohn Timbs, English Eccentrics And Eccentricities, Volume II (1866)\n###"}

{"prompt": "Boosters\n", "completion": " Devoted Hooting Yard readers will know that I am always on the lookout for boosters of one sort or another. I don't really care what kind of booster it is, nor what it is designed to boost. It is entirely possible that my enthusiasm is stirred simply by the sound of the words 'boost' and 'booster'. Broadly speaking, I would aver that you can't go wrong if your sentence has 'boost' in it somewhere, even if it doesn't make sense. A while ago I employed a team of boffins to analyse the neurological responses of a sample of listeners to my radio show. The results, though difficult to clarify, buried as they were in a vast pile of inexplicable data, showed that magnificently pleasurable brain-tinglings occurred in seven out of ten people, irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity, sock-size, religious or political affiliation, or the angle of the ears towards their wireless sets, whenever I declaimed in sprightly tones the words 'boost' or 'boosters'. Further tests showed that the remaining three out of ten persons each had so-called \"boffin-resistant brains\". Apparently the cranial integuments of such persons send out weird wild rays or beams of some unknown substance which thoroughly beflummox the dials and chockers on the boffins' conical scanners.\nAnyway, I make mention of all this because, during my stay in Flanders, I could barely walk ten paces upon the cobbles without seeing this excellent example of booster-related advertising.\n\nI am not sure whether Belgacom boosts anything else, in addition to het internet, but I wouldn't put it past them.\n###"}

Apart from the occasional recipe, I find little here that teaches me how to actually do anything. Sort it out!\"\nWell then. Here, especially for Ms Pastry, is the first in a series of How To... articles which have been written for us by the Barry Bucknell de nos jours, Fatima Gilliblat.\nHere is a surefire way to festoon yourself with old netting. First, buy a train ticket to the seaside, or more precisely to a fishing port, the more Lovecraftian the better. Innsmouth would be ideal, but anywhere faintly sinister and maritime will do. As soon as you arrive, sidle insouciantly down to the quayside, looking out for grizzled old fisherfolk. They may eye you with suspicion, but that is because you are a landlubber unfamiliar with the lore of the sea. Strike up a conversation. Ask questions about their \"catch\". At some point, while sucking on his clay pipe or picking the bones of sprats out of his matted hair, your interlocutor will mention his fishing net. This is your chance! Ask to see his net. Squelch across the sands with him when the tide is out, past the algae-smeared buoys and the rotting tugboats, and when you come to the old frayed net, slip the sea dog a fiver. He will trudge off to buy lugworms or maggots with this unexpected booty, and while he is gone, you can wrap yourself up in the net. Be sure to disentangle yourself and head back to the jetty before the tide comes in, or you will meet a watery doom, and miss the train home.\n###"}
{"prompt": "H Is for Haruspices\n", "completion": " Episode eight in our not-quite-daily serialisation of The Immense Duckpond Pamphlet, today with added potato pictures for your instruction and delight\n\nIn ancient Rome, the haruspices were an order of priests who made prophecies by examining the steaming entrails of sacrificially-slaughtered animals. Doctor Cack had made a thorough study of their methods, and for the last ten years had been engaged in experiments to carry out successful haruspication using mashed potatoes instead of entrails.\n\nAbly assisted by Ruhugu and others, Doctor Cack would lay out the \"field\", a triangular cloth weighted down at each corner by a small piece of bakelite. On to this, a precisely-measured amount of mashed potato would be splattered with the agency of an iron spatula. A second triangular cloth would be placed atop the resulting mess, and pressed down evenly. The upper cloth would then be turned over, and the pattern created by the mashed potato which had adhered to it would be examined with great care. Ruhugu used his box camera to make a photographic record.\n\nDivination completed, and notes and annotations pencilled into the foolscap ledger, the cloth triangles would be scrubbed clean with a special detergent in readiness for the next experiment.\n\nThere were arguments, of course. Moop insisted that only certain potato varieties were sufficiently \"numinous\", as she put it. Maris Pipers, Majestics, and Arran Banners met with her approval. Trellis maintained that the waxy texture of the Red Craig's Royal made it the only suitable variety. Strob said the cloths ought to be hexagonal. The unhinged Jubble went so far as to suggest using boiled and mashed celery instead.\n\nRuhugu mediated between the factions, protecting Doctor Cack from turmoil and strife, leaving him free to pore over the foolscap ledger, frowning, rapt, determined to eke from it whatever revelations it harboured.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Hubs and Tranches\n", "completion": " I wrote some months ago that where I live--when I am not on duty in the Haemoglobin Towers annexe, of course--has been designated as a hub. I am not entirely sure who has so designated it, although doubtless it was some \"New\" Labour apparatchik. In fact it would be more correct to dub it a forthcoming hub, or a hub-to-be, for of course its hubdom is not yet complete. I do not know how many tranches are involved in the area's transformation from whatever it is now to being a true hub, and this bothers me.\nI want to know about the tranches, pretty desperately. Something cannot become a hub in Blair's brave new land without each successive tranche being signed off, or so I gather.\nIn fact I want some tranches of my own. Hooting Yard deserves, I think, to go from one tranche to another. So let this be the First Tranche, I declare.\nIt also strikes me that Hubs And Tranches sounds like an album title, perhaps one made by a fey singer-songwriter. If, dear reader, you are that fey singer-songwriter, you are welcome to use it.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Splendidly Useful Definition\n", "completion": " Regular readers will have gathered that the bulk of the prose in Hooting Yard is the result of many, many hours of painstaking research. Before writing Pipistrelle Pursuivant, for example--see below, 25th June--I needed to know a lot more about heraldic bats than I did when I woke up that morning. Indeed, I had much to learn about bats, and even more about heraldry. To gain a precarious foothold in the latter, one of my sources was Pimbley's Dictionary of Heraldry. I must say, having read it in full, that this is the very model of what a dictionary can be. Seldom have I found such a rigorous approach to the act of definition. Pimbley's are clear, succinct, and remarkable. Take this, as just one example: there you are, thumbing through your heraldic dictionary, wanting--even needing--to know what is meant by the phrase 'Barry bendy dexter and sinister'. Pimbley defines it as 'a combination of barry and bendy dexter and sinister'. Isn't that perfect? You close the book, thump your fist on your escritoire, and furrow your brow, older and wiser than you were but a minute ago.\n\n###"}

I smoked a cigarette and thought about Paavo Nurmi, the Flying Finn. It occurred to me that if ever I tried to run as far, as fast as him, I would almost certainly collapse from exhaustion. Grinding the butt of my cigarette into the muck, I took the doll from my pocket. From another pocket I took a batch of pins. Spatters of rain started up again. I adjusted my Homburg on my head, as best as I could with the doll in one hand and the pins in the other. It was my intention to pierce the doll with the pins while jabbering curses. I think it best that I do not divulge the name of the cursee. In any case, it hardly matters, because I did not carry out my plan. I cast the doll into the mire and dropped the pins in the muck by the mire's edge. Then I turned on my heel and sprinted--yes!, sprinted!--back towards my shabby hotel room in the town. Long before I reached it, I collapsed from exhaustion. Unlike Paavo Nurmi, I had no idea how to pace myself. I am no Flying Finn, nor was meant to be. I sprawled there in the muck and the rain fell down on me. I let it fall. What could I have done to stop it? I have no power over the weather. He whom I had been on the point of cursing, oh, now he has such power. The day will come, perhaps, when he will have egg on his face. I am too tired to care. I have run out of steam. I fear that, as dusk falls, gruesome creatures will crawl from Grimpen Mire, grab me by the ankles, and drag me under. So be it.\n###"}

Their songs are mostly about beer and foopball. Their EP Love On The Terraces is a collector's item these days. Also taking to the stage is a post-punk performance poet. Incapable of memorising his verses, he has them scribbled on pieces of paper which, as he finishes reading each one, he scrunches up in his fist and chucks into the audience. Nobody knows--indeed nobody cares--that this will be his one and only performance as a poet, and he will not reappear on stage until the new century has dawned. He shouts (among other things):\nI spent ten days in a shed\n  The shed was made of wood\n  I smoked a pack of Number 6\n  And drank a bottle of stout\n  I didn't eat a fucking crumb\n  After a while my legs went numb\n  Then I went and had my bath\n  Now I'm so clean it almost hurts\nThat youthful performer was Frank Key The Poet. I am not sure what brought that memory flooding back.\nADDENDUM : I recall only one other piece I shouted at the crowd that night, and only the opening three lines come back to me:\nHe pushed a boy scout into a lake\n  Went to a snackbar and stole some cake\n  He's a snackbar hooligan!\nAll the verses followed the same pattern, a rhyming couplet followed by the one-line \"chorus\", after each bellowing of which I urged the audience to shout \"Yeah!\" or \"Oi!\", which I am pleased to say they did, with a certain mocking enthusiasm.\n###"}

They worried about their souls and stared deeply and hopelessly into the depths of themselves. Well, that was how they had always carried on in the past anyway.

{"prompt": "Some Rare Editions of the Bible : Number One\n", "completion": " Scholars, theologians, and indeed plain old book-lovers have long been intrigued by various anomalous editions of the Holy Bible. In this new series, Hooting Yard's own expert on such matters, Fatima Gilliblat, will be examining some of her favourites. She begins with a rare Bible from 1982:\nThe so-called Emperor Rosko Bible of 1982 is astonishingly rare. In fact, some people, who ought to know better, have suggested that it is a figment of my own fancy. Such accusers are hotheads unfit to lick my theological bootees, and should be discouraged from making any pronouncements upon these matters whatsoever, at least until such time as they have been forced to memorise all eighty-nine chapters of the Codex Gilliblatiana, wherein I expound my learning with verve and wit. I recommend it as suitable holiday reading, if you have a suitcase big enough to contain it. But enough of self-advertisement.\nThe Emperor Rosko Bible is so called because the four gospels in the New Testament were comprehensively rewritten by a quartet of clapped-out Radio One disc jockeys, including the eponymous Emperor Rosko (Matthew), Ed \"Stewpot\" Stewart (Mark), Dave Lee Travis, otherwise known, at least by himself and his immediate family, as \"The Hairy Cornflake\" (Luke), and finally Diddy David Hamilton (John). The remainder of the New Testament, and all of the Old Testament, follows the standard Douai version, except for the Book of Isaiah, which has been expunged for no apparent reason. My copy is bound in bloodstained bandages abstracted from a locker in the basement of a mysterious clinic high in the Swiss alps.\nOnly eight copies of the Emperor Rosko Bible were ever made, and they were given away as prizes at a Radio One Roadshow held in the North Yorkshire seaside town of Whitby. The combination of the bloodstains and the resonance of Bram Stoker's Dracula that still hangs over Whitby I find strangely appealing.\n###"}

They had stood triumphantly, arm in arm, each with a foot--or in Unstrebnodtalb's case, more properly a hoof--planted on the dead body of Blodgett, or Jubble.\nThe end had been horrifying, and very messy. They had had to call on Euwige to help, and by the time they realised the scimitar had not been sharpened it was too late. Afterwards, Euwige and Moop got rid of the corpse. The distant splash led Aminadab to conclude that Blodgett/Jubble's body ended up in one of the twenty six ponds, but he didn't really care which one.\nThree weeks later, when he returned home, he wrote up the case as usual. Fuelled by dandelion and burdock and bilgegrew buns, he sat late into the night engraving his zincographs. Half of what he wrote was lies, of course. Unstrebnodtalb hardly featured in the Aminadab version. Moop and Trellis virtually disappeared, although he awarded them a footnote in a sentimental moment.\nHe was, as usual, merciless with himself. If anyone ever bothered to read the narrative, they would surely conclude that the sleuth Aminadab didn't have a clue what was going on, and still didn't twig what had actually happened even at the end, as he bid farewell to Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb, his absurd agglomeration of luggage long abandoned save for the punnet and reticule, enormous birds beating their enormous wings around him as he stood ankle-deep in mud, weird and hapless, at the very edge of the immense duckpond.\n###"}

Some would argue that a smidgen of truth is better than no truth at all, and they may well be right, but what my correspondent overlooks is that if one did plunge the syringe filled with essence of gumption and pluck directly into the subject, thus obviating any need for the pickles in the first place, what on earth would one do with all those pickles, and indeed with the jars into which they are crammed?

Downstairs I could hear the band tuning up for what turned out to be a \"jam\" session, as the young people say. And what did I learn from Dobson? I discovered that my uninvited--but not unwelcome--guests had begun life as a skiffle combo called The Urbane Blodgett Seven. Riding the sixties wave, they tried out various styles until in 1969 they emerged, utterly transformed, as the pioneers of glob music. By now they had settled on the name of The Hinges And Nozzles, after being told that their other choices--among them Foghat, The Carpenters, Petula Clark, and Blodwyn Pig--had already been nabbed by other acts. The 1970s were kind to them, and they had a string of hit albums, including Baleful Porpoise, Jesuit Gewgaw Handler, and Irk The Shibboleth. The release of Brain Salad Surgery was postponed indefinitely after a rival album was released by a so-called \"prog rock\" group whose name Dobson could not recall, despite all the research materials listed in what Nestingbird has dubbed his \"most exhaustive appendix\".

A brief--but by no means complete--list would include:\nThe Munich Air Disaster; the Kennedy Assassination; Peter Maxwell Davies eating an accidentally-electrocuted whooper swan; the Hindenburg Disaster; Yoko Ono; Googie Withers; David Blunkett.\nI realise that my selection includes two aerial disasters, so that is a common thread, but otherwise none of them seem to link up in any coherent way. Are there some profound psychological reasons that cause you to harp on about these subjects, or are you just repeating yourself? And whichever is the case, can you give any clues as to how one might predict whether or not an event or a person might become embedded in your brain, and thus crop up time and time again in Hooting Yard?\nI suppose it would be polite of me to reply to these questions, so I will try at some point to frame a response, once I have finished making my set of Hazel Blears finger puppets.\n\n###"}

Laudable as his efforts are, several observers have noted that the world of classical music is too small and narrow to have real societal heft. Pop music, they say, is the lingua franca that can genuinely bring people of different faiths together. To this end, and as a faltering first step in resolving the simmering civil war between the two major branches of Islam, a new single has been released.

{"prompt": "Dietary News\n", "completion": " Many years ago, I decided to experiment by living on a subsistence diet of gruel for a while. (I do hope my readers understand that this is a true story.) I think I was pandering to my ascetic, puritanical streak. For the duration of the exercise, I eschewed all other foodstuffs, even to the point where I was tempted neither by pap nor by slops. Around the same time I read somewhere that krill was the Food of the Future. This appealed to me hugely, but gruel seemed easier to come by than krill.\nThis is by way of introduction to my recent discovery of another alleged Food of the Future, in the form of poi, a thoroughly exciting dish from Hawaii. Poi is made from the taro plant, which is apparently the fourteenth most cultivated crop on earth. The root or corm of the taro is cooked for hours and hours and then pounded into a sticky goo that has the consistency of library paste, which makes it especially appealing to those of us who are bookish. One of the other great things about poi is that you can dispense with cutlery, as it is shovelled daintily into the mouth using your bare hands.\nSo if you are on the lookout for a sour paste to serve as your staple diet, poi seems to be the thing. Maybe after eating a delicious bowl of the goo, you may wish to engage in fire dancing, fire twirling, fire spinning, or fire swinging, for all of which you can use fire poi. If you wish to know more, I suggest that you join an online fire twirler community.\nFood and fire... who ever said Hooting Yard was not a repository of essential information for a fulfilling life?\n###"}

Well, let me tell you, Adair, you putrid little twerp, had you been in a Jap prisoner-of-war camp during the last war, as I was, you would have been delighted to be bored with some soup! Oh yes, you would have got down on your knees and begged to be bored out of your gruesome little mind!\" Needless to say, I ate the soup--and, from that formative moment on, I got, as it were, the hang of the thing.\nGilbert Adair, \"On Soup\", collected in Surfing The Zeitgeist (1997)\n###"}

{"prompt": "Fantastic Architecture Of The Burning Cities\n", "completion": " When I was young, I was keen to study the fantastic architecture of the burning cities. I enrolled in a college run according to Blotzmannist principles. We were taught to build scale models of the more outlandish buildings, from paper and cardboard and gum, and to set fire to them and watch them burn, keeping a safe distance. Viewed through heavy duty hectorscopes, from behind the potted begonias and chrysanthemums in our workroom, the effect was astonishing. One could imagine oneself standing, windswept, upon the tor, watching from that high peak, with its glistening mere, the city in flames far below.\nAnd when it was reduced to ashes and dust, what then? What then? Had we really been upon the tor, we would have no city to return to. As the smoke dispersed, would we have trooped down the far side of the tor and set out for new, undiscovered lands, to build and burn anew? Pimply students, we need not risk such adventure. We took our brooms and dustpans and swept up the ashes and then we left the workroom, laughing and babbling, heading across the lawn, with its glistening pond, for the cafeteria.\nAnd as we gobbled and drank, the college janitor locked up his cupboard, hung his keys on the hook in the porch, and took the bus to the foot of the tor. Up he trudged to the top, and he sat by the glistening mere, and looked upon the city, and he wept.\n###"}

Dear Frank, my anonymous correspondent wrote, I have heard it said that Blodgett always maintained an alphabetical contents in his duffel bag. Is this true, and if so, can you give an example, drawn from a typical Blodgett day?\nI have not ignored this question, but coming up with an answer has taken a lot of research, sometimes perilous.

{"prompt": "St Dunstan's Cup\n", "completion": " St Dunstan's Cup is the name given to a wassail-and-carousing practice once popular in the Fens and the Ditches. In the midst of a wassail-and-carouse, a participant would throw their drained goblet up in the air, and whoever caught it with one hand upon its descent would become \"St Dunstan\". Other wassailers-and-carousers would then pick \"St Dunstan\" up, carry him to the yard outwith the wassailing-and-carousing parlour, and fling him into a cesspit. After wallowing for a few minutes, \"St Dunstan\" would then heave himself out of the pit, crawl back into the parlour, and shout \"Which among you is my uncle AElfheah, Bishop of Winchester?\" The person roaring their head off at the most ear-shattering volume would be dubbed the Bishop, and \"St Dunstan\" would hand them the goblet, which would again be tossed into the air, and thus the whole senseless business would begin again. At most wassails-and-carouses in the Fens and the Ditches, St Dunstan's Cup would continue until everybody present had been flung into the cesspit at least once.\nThe practice is thought to have died out with the development of modern sanitary methods of coping with human filth and muck. In those wassailing-and-carousing parlours which still survive, it has been replaced by a game called St Dunstan's Tongs. This is a far more complicated pastime, with abstruse rules, and has been described as \"contract bridge for the hopelessly inebriate\". Some Sunday newspapers published in the Fens and Ditches carry columns devoted to the strategy and tactics of St Dunstan's Tongs, written in impenetrable prose.\nNext week : St Dymphna's Pinking Shears.\n###"}

{"prompt": "In Praise Of Nisbet Spotting\n", "completion": " Reading a couple of blog postages today led me to cast my mind back to the heyday of nisbet spotting in the early nineteen-seventies. In The Dabbler, ZMKC fondly recalls an absurd and pointless exchange of correspondence with a schoolfriend, while BlackberryJuniper And Sherbet apologises (unnecessarily) that she is \"thinking aloud about nothing in particular\".\nAbsurdity, pointlessness and \"nothing in particular\" as one's subject matter all dovetail neatly into the theory and practice of nisbet spotting. I earlier gave some account of this exciting activity here. To recap, aged around ten or eleven, I created a newspaper or magazine which purported to be the Official Journal of the Nisbet Spotting Society. Written by hand, illustrated with drawings and collages, the pages carefully stapled together--though not with fairy staples--the contents of the Journal chronicled the failure of the Society's members ever to spot a nisbet. Indeed, I made it a conscious point never to explain what a nisbet was. I suppose it was my version of the Snark or the Boojum, though I don't think I had read Carroll's \"Agony In Eight Fits\" at the time.\nDid the nisbet even exist, or were those seeking to spot one on a futile quest? We shall never know, for before I faced up to deciding one way or another, I abandoned the Journal after five or six issues and discovered other enthusiasms. I continued to write, though I don't remember what. Then soon enough I entered the dread world of teendom, and became very serious and earnest, as teenpersons will do, and my writing suffered accordingly. I had an important message for the world, if only it would listen. It did not.\nIt took about ten years for me to regain my mojo, and to realise that the absurdity and pointlessness and \"nothing\" of nisbet spotting showed the way forward. To a large extent, everything I have written over the past quarter of a century, since the first Malice Aforethought Press booklet in 1986, has been a sort of hommage to those hapless enthusiasts of the Nisbet Spotting Society.\n###"}

It was called Jeffrey.\nThis is something I am very, very glad to know, and I doubt that a Yuletide will pass in future without me mentioning it.\nBob Drake replied, saying \"That got me thinking.

This is easily done by gently tapping the shell with the handle of a pocket-knife until it is full of small cracks, and then, with the blade of the knife, picking off the small pieces. In this way remove the shell from the space about the size of a nickel. Remove the shell from the small end of the egg over a space about as large as the end of the glass tube. Next, from the lower end of the candle cut a piece about one-half inch long. Bore a hole in this just the size of the glass tube. Now soften one end of the piece of candle with the hole in it and stick it on to the small end of the egg so that the hole in the candle comes over the hole in the egg. Heat the wire, and with it solder the piece of candle more firmly to the egg, making a water-tight joint. Place the glass tube in the hole in the piece of candle, pushing it down till it touches the egg. Then, with the heated wire, solder the tube firmly in place. Now run the wire down the tube and break the skin of the egg just under the end of the tube.

Finally he added a scrawled note on the stained outer flap of his letter, dated 4 November. It captures a soldier's-eye view of the British imperial mission. \"PS Dr Anderson and Mills dead since writing the within--my head a little sore this morning--was up late last night drinking Ale with a Moor who has been at Gibraltar and speaks English--got a little tipsy--finished the scene by giving the Moor a damn'd good thrashing.\"\n[My italics.] Now, does hardbitten Captain Martyn sound like an effeminate prancing ninny?

And that he in return was looked upon with affection is surely to some extent shown by the fact that he was asked by Mr Goodwin to choose his wife's hats. Mrs Goodwin, it seems, had appalling taste. The results of leaving her to dress herself could be shocking in the extreme. Her husband's pupil was therefore asked, and apparently agreed, not only to accompany the lady in an advisory capacity when she went shopping but also to inspect her before she left the house.\n\"Mr Goodwin was later made Bishop of Carlisle, a characteristic choice for one of those bishops who, as the century progressed, found themselves faced by forces greater than they were equipped to understand. Who supervised his wife's choice of hats in Carlisle is not recorded.\"\n###"}

A very poor child, of the parish of Newington-Butts... was a very monster of wickedness, and a thousand times more miserable and vile by his sin than by his poverty. He was running to hell as fast as he could go, and was old in vice when he was but young in years: we scarcely hear of one so like the devil in his infancy as was this poor child. What sin was there that his age was capable of, which he did not commit? What by the corruption of his nature, and the abominable example of little beggar boys, he was indeed arrived at a great pitch of impiety. He would call names, take God's name in vain, curse, swear, and do all kinds of mischief; and as to any thing of God, he was worse than a heathen...\n6. He was in grievous agonies of spirit; his former sins stared him in the face, and made him tremble. The poison of God's arrows did even drink up his spirits; the sense of sin and of wrath were so great that he knew not what to do. The weight of God's displeasure, and the thought of lying under it to all eternity, broke him even to pieces, and he bitterly cried out, \"What shall I do! I am a miserable sinner, and I fear that I shall go to hell.\" His sins had been so great and so many, that there was no hope for him...\n14. The Wednesday before he died, he lay in a trance for about half an hour, in which time he thought he saw a vision of angels...\n16 ...he gave a kind of leap in his bed, and snapped his finger and thumb together with abundance of joy. And from that time forward, in full joy and assurance of God's love, he continued earnestly praising God, desiring to die, and to be with Christ.\nJohn Wesley, Stories Of Boys And Girls Who Loved The Saviour (date uncertain)\n###"}
{"prompt": "Whither Art?\n", "completion": " Whither art? It's a question I often ask myself, usually when tucking into a plate of smokers' poptarts or other breakfast-based snack food. I like to get art out of the way early on in the day, freeing up my time for higher things. I do not practise art myself, but it is a subject of abiding interest to me. Whither art?, I ask, wondering where it will go.\nTo answer that question, one must of course be familiar with where art has been. One follows its trajectory, from the earliest cave paintings to the latest talentless derivative didactic Marxist video installation bollocks, and one tries to push the line further along, to see whence it leads. Every morning, at breakfast.\nSometimes, alas, those smokers' poptarts are just too damned delicious, and the brain that ought to be cogitating upon the future of art is instead benumbed in a lovely haze of gustatory bliss. At such times, all thoughts of art fly away, like unto a flock of starlings, and instead I ponder the sheer genius of modern breakfast snack food manufacturing processes.\nBut the next morning, after a day devoted to the higher things, things such as prayer and beekeeping and shove ha'penny, I return to that burning question, whither art?, as a dog returns to its vomit, and I wrestle with it, at least until breakfast is digested.\nVery occasionally, when for example I have a stomach upset, I do not ask whither art?, but instead declaim, in a booming tone, wither, art! I curse art and I envision a glorious new world where art curdles and shrivels until at last it is gone, all of it, forever.

It was not entirely clear to me whether he did this as a form of gainful employment, or for his own entertainment. It might even have been art. I mention this because it occurred to me that an Antipodean chicken-dyer could prove a useful recurring character in the various doings recounted here at Hooting Yard. We shall see.\nOh, one more thing. I was startled to discover that Dave was unable to name the four members of The Seekers.

{"prompt": "The Smothered Chicken Of Greaselbow\n", "completion": " The legend of the smothered chicken of Greaselbow has been told and retold for over a thousand years. The core details seldom vary. In the rustic backwater of Greaselbow, a child, usually but not always an orphan, is settling in to its cot one wild and windy night when it senses an unusual lump under its pillow. Lifting the pillow, the child finds a chicken, often but not always a Vanburgh chicken, which has expired due to smothering. The child picks up the chicken by one of its feet, and chucks it out of the bedroom window. The instant it is let go, the chicken springs to life, utters a shrill squawk, and hurtles heavenward. When the child returns to bed, it finds the pillow vanished, replaced by a large egg. The child climbs into the egg--somehow--and the shell then closes around it.\nInterpretations of the legend by folklorists have tended to concentrate on the egg and the child, but of more interest is the smothered chicken. That is particularly the case if one has a penchant for poultry. And which of us does not? Well, you might counter, there are plenty of people who don't give a fig about poultry. Even keen egg-eaters, who rarely let a breakfast go by without scoffing an egg or two, might be utterly uninterested in the provenance of their eggs, id est poultry of one kind or another.\nThis is a lamentable state of affairs, and is the reason I carry a pillow with me whenever I am in the vicinity of someone eating eggs.\n\"Oi!\", I shout, \"Where did those eggs come from?\"\nUnless I receive a full and frank reply, acknowledging the eggs' origins, I bundle the egg-eater to the ground and smother them with the pillow.

His audience gasped. It was the climax of his lecture; all that remained were a few words of summing up, then the astonished listeners would scatter, like chaffinches from a treetop after a gunshot, and the scientist could put his stick away for another week. But not today! For lurking incognito in the group was Father Desperado Sepulveda, the so-called Milquetoast Jesuit, sent on a mission from Paraguay to ferret out the truth. He cleared his throat. \"I think,\" he said, in a whisper like the hiss of an asp, \"I think we would all like to hear it go clunk.\" The scientist's brow furrowed and his mouth felt suddenly dry. \"It is one thing to be told that it goes clunk,\" continued the relentless Jesuit, \"But something else entirely to experience for ourselves the sound of it going clunk.\" He was an empiricist. The rest of the crowd began to mutter excitedly. They had not thought to be so forward themselves. The scientist spluttered, but it was too late, for Father Sepulveda had already pressed the big yellow knob that made it go clunk. Forensic teams later recovered his rosary beads from the rubble.\n\nThe Milquetoast Jesuit's rosary beads in happier days\n###"}
{"prompt": "Thew's Pod\n", "completion": " On 30th April, we reported on the space-age-pod-turned-restaurant on the outskirts of Bodger's Spinney, noting that maverick Digby Thew had been appointed as head chef. Building work was completed early in June, and the eaterie has now been open for a month, so we thought we would find out from Mr Thew how things were going. Unfortunately, he was not available for comment, as he suffered a near-fatal casserole accident and is under heavy sedation in some clinic somewhere. His charming assistant chef, who preferred not to give her name, told us:\n\"With Digby out of the way, we have been able to turn the space-age-pod into a truly spectacular restaurant. Where else do you think you could get two slices of toast and a cup of boiled goo for the same price as a bag of toffees? The longer that nitwit stays in hospital the better for us, and the better for our customers. And that means better for the socioeconomic infrastructure of Bodger's Spinney and its windswept and dreary hinterland, from the oddly-shaped purple mountains of Lewdbag to the roadworks on the Blister Lane Bypass, from Pang Hill to Loopy Copse.

(I know that sounds like one of Dobson's pamphlets, but I checked, and it is--surprisingly, perhaps--a topic he never addressed.)\nI jotted down a few notes (Berio--partridge, Havergal Brian--reed warbler, Berg--grebe) but my pea-sized yet pulsating brain was drawn back to swans by that indefatigable correspondent Glyn Webster, who sent this:\n\"When I was a toddler my parents used to amuse themselves by taking me to the Rotorua lake front to feed the Satanic Black Swans. These swans are not the white, regal, placid creatures I'd been shown in my storybooks. They are black, greasy, violent creatures that smell of sulphurous lake mud. The expression in their glowing red eyes switches from vacant, narcissistic insanity to envious hatred the instant they are offered food.\n\"In a shoebox somewhere is a Super 8 film reel of me weeping in terror, running and stumbling in my nylon parka and Crackerjack(r) gumboots while a dozen of these evil beasts waddle after me lunging after the lump of bread I'd forgotten to drop in my panic.

{"prompt": "\"As a simple example, I will state...\"\n", "completion": " \"As a simple example, I will state that wild birds are caught by means of a sympathetic electricity. For this purpose a long, hollow metal tube is used, at the bottom of which is a globe containing a powerful acid. A receptacle at the top of the tube contains seeds much liked by the birds. They hover about these seeds, and, when they are within a certain distance, a slight pressure on a wooden spring causes a drop of the acid in the globe to escape into the tube, and so to set in movement a current of electricity, which, being very sympathetic to the bird, acts as an attractor so powerful, that it cannot get away. The tube is then gently lowered, and the birds are gradually drawn near to the earth, when a light net is thrown over the captives, and they are shaken into a cage-net at the bottom. Calmed by the electricity, they do not flutter or struggle when thus secured. It is very interesting to see the birds come nearer and nearer as the rod is lowered towards the ground. For electrical purposes it is necessary to catch the birds alive.\" -- Benjamin Lumley, Another World; or Fragments From The Star City Of Montalluyah\n###"}

Weirdly, it fails to mention the noted mezzotintist Rex Tint, but you can rely on me to make good that omission. For what I recalled, over my cornflakes 'n' egg a la Blavatsky, was that in the early months of 1958 Rex Tint was busy with what came to be known as \"the cack-handed mezzotints\". This was a set of pieces which lack the sureness of touch and the dapper brilliance of his best work, but are nevertheless of interest, no piece more so than this rather clumsy mezzotint of the Busby Babes.

{"prompt": "Stupid Ancient Greek Men\n", "completion": " [Thomas Carlyle's] aversion for the 'fixed smile' of Greek statuary was equal to that of Ruskin, and his way of expressing it no less individual. Carlyle sat to G F Watts for his portrait, and Watts, as he often did in conversation with his sitters, began to talk of Pheidias. Carlyle advanced a criticism which no one else seems to have thought of. He contended that among all the sculptured beings which the genius of Pheidias had produced there was 'not one clever man'. With the long upper lip of Ecclefechan obstinately tightened he declared that a short upper lip showed an absence of intellect. He stuck to his point even when Watts cited Napoleon, Byron, and Goethe as evidence against him. He added that the jaw of the Greek was not sufficiently prominent. 'Depend upon it,' said Carlyle, 'neither God nor man can get on without a jaw.' 'There's not a clever man amongst them all,' he repeated, 'and I would away with them--into space.'\nfrom William Gaunt, Victorian Olympus (1952)\nThanks to Nige for alerting me to this splendid book, in this post over at The Dabbler.\n###"}

After all, in a god-eat-god world, you can stay one step ahead by clutching every new twitching tendril of faith to your capacious Blavatskyesque bosom as soon as it appears. Recent news items alert us to some must-have additions to your cult.\nSo, for example, ensure that your sect incorporates a 'blot', a sacrificial meat offering to the ancient Norse Gods as practised by adherents of Asatru. You might also want to smash statues and tear up baptismal gowns and wedding veils like the devotees of Creciendo En Gracia, for whom 59-year-old Puerto Rican Jose Luis De Jesus Miranda is Christ. Like Jesus of Nazareth, he wears fine suits and diamond-encrusted rings, drives a 7 Series BMW, and, until recently, lived in a 5000-square-foot Miramar home with Corinthian columns and vaulted ceilings. He also travels with a battalion of guards who wear dark suits and conspicuous earpieces, but the running cost of this security detail is only about $300,000 per annum, so is completely affordable if you tithe your followers at the appropriate level.\nMeanwhile, don't forget to co-opt Kathleen McGowan on to the shadowy ruling council of your sect.

My unpaid intern research assistants tell me that the emblem first appeared, in black and white, on the cover of an edition of the ReR Quarterly magazine in the late 1980s, cheek by jowl with several other emblems. If this is the case, then in terms of simple chronology it would have been impossible for nisbet spotters of the early 1970s to spot it, as it did not yet exist.

If any reader has a copy of the magazine in question, perhaps they would be good enough to scan both front and back covers and send them to Mr Key.

Their current production, the one that had the Sludge Hall Farm yokels gawping, was a dramatisation of the first Blunkett resignation of 2004. That was the one where, relinquishing the post of Home Secretary, our hero went on television and spoke mawkishly, tearfully, and repeatedly about \"the little lad\", a bit of homespun phraseology designed to tug the heartstrings of the nation. It certainly had that effect on the Sludge Hall Farm farmhands, at least when acted by Bodger's Spinney's most accomplished thespian, Vlasto Harbinge. The racket made by the peasants' copious sobbing almost drowned out the closing peroration by the chorus.\nIn order to have sufficient pretext for wielding their bodkins and whisks, the Players set their Blunkettorama in the fourteenth century. This also allowed them to incorporate the gruesome battle scenes for which they have become notorious. In a particularly splendid segment, the Home Secretary's trusty guide dog Ruby--or possibly Teddy or Offa or Lucy or Sadie--single-pawedly fought off a pack of rabid wolves egged on by spectral wolfmen armed with the requisite bodkins and whisks.

I would be glad to know, as I am sure would other Hooting Yardists.\nI suppose it is touching in a way that Anon expects me to come up with an answer at the snap of his or her fingers, but, you know, sometimes these things demand research. Prodigious research, in a case like this. There are going to be sleepless nights, long trudges through the rain to suburban warehouses, bus ticket expenditure, enjanglements of the cranium, sobbing, hysteria, unanswered metal tapping machine messages, desperate snackbar encounters, and quite possibly a lengthy period of Bewilderment Home convalescence.

{"prompt": "More About Captain Cake\n", "completion": " Captain Cake had gone to sea in a battered and leaking ship. He drank his grog from a bakelite cup. When he walked upon the orlop deck he sang in vulgar Latin, and every morning he made the sailors pray at Matins. The bo'sun had a voodoo doll pierced with many pins. But Captain Cake had a jacket made of tin, and he made the bo'sun walk the plank till he fell into the churning sea. All the sailors rollicked with glee. So Captain Cake sat in his cabin reading a book about gourds. Then they landed on an island of bloodthirsty hordes. The purser chucked the voodoo pins at the leader of these folk, who put down his sword and began to choke. Captain Cake wanted to be the island king, but they already had a god with bright and fluttery wings, and the god made the captain bow down on the sand. So if you sail the hectic seas be sure to understand that leaking ships can run aground at the drop of a hat. If only Captain Cake had realised that.\n###"}

During this time your editor has been engaged in exciting discussions with Hollywood moguls about a new television series. Zeigler And Locke will be a spin-off from two existing shows, featuring Toby Zeigler from The West Wing and Mr Locke from Lost. No one seemed to know what to do with the partnership. Should they be crusaders against evil, like Batman and Superman? Arch-rivals perhaps? Or just buddies on a pointless road trip?\nI am not sure why I was called in as a consultant. I messed around with a few templates--Steptoe and Son, Boswell and Johnson, Cagney and Lacey--but my parting advice, before coming home from the hills, was that Zeigler and Locke would work best by having the two protagonists as argumentative ornithologists roaming the hills and fields of a distant country, never agreeing on the identification of the various birds they spot. In each hour-long episode they would come upon one bird, and the conceit would be that every single time neither of them would be correct. In my pilot episode, what Zeigler argues is a peewit, and Locke insists is a moorhen, turns out to be a grebe.\n\nLeft to right : Toby Zeigler, Mr Locke, a grebe\n###"}

I am certain he could be reasonably still-ish while being drawn, or even painted, and I feel he deserves a second chance. He is, after all, a very small badger, and it is not his fault if his behaviour was misconstrued as \"mystic\" by ne'er-do-well impresarios hungry for a victim to exploit. Yours concernedly, Poppy Nisbet\nWell, Poppy, it's true that Little Severin the Mystic Badger turned out to be not so mystic after all, although rumours flying about at Haemoglobin Towers have it that he correctly forecast the medal winners in the recent Olympic men's polevaulting event (though not in the right order). On the other hand, maybe he was just scrubbling about in the undergrowth foraging for tasty grubs. Who can say? In any event, we have taken your advice and Little Severin is now earning his keep posing not, I am afraid to say, for paintbrush wielding Dachshunds, but as a full time model for human children at the Lancashire Badger Group.

{"prompt": "Nothing\n", "completion": " You will have noticed a distinct lack of gung ho Hooting Yard activity of late. This is due to the usual reasons, viz. a vacant space between Mr Key's ears where normally are forged the great iron girders of prose. This vacancy itself has been occasioned, I think, by a hare-brained intention to rearrange all the books on the bookshelves. The prospect of doing so has stunned me. I ought to point out that I have no pressing need to reshelve, and I may still abandon the idea. But just the other day, gazing at the teeming rows of books, I thought how pleasant it would be to see them all in a different order. What stops me from immediately getting on with it is a sense of not being entirely sure how I wish to rearrange. There are, after all, so many different schemes one can apply, and I am ludicrously unsure about which to proceed with. So instead of reshelving, I gaze, and think, and make a cup of tea, and smoke a fag, and stare out of the window, and generally faff about to no good purpose.\nAt least Huw Halfbacon raked the gravel.

Our next letter, O, could be taken for Nothing, too, if it were to be misread as 0, or zero, which it can be, if you are not looking carefully and don't give a damn about context. Iggy Pop claims that his band, The Stooges, has the best band-name ever, simply because of that \"oo\" in the middle. But the \"oo\" sound, written down, can also be interpreted as a double-zero, a double nothingness, as in, for example, the surname of the poet Rupert Brooke, propelled into the nothingness of death by a gnat-bite to his lip, as he sailed towards the Dardanelles, and Gallipoli. Edgar Allan Poe has just the one O at the centre of his surname, the O of a maelstrom, such as the maelstrom that lies in wait for Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket as he vanishes into a white nothingness. Iggy, too, has a central O in his surname, coupled by the O of his real surname, Osterburg.\nBut I ought not be babbling about all these Os now, when we are speaking of N, when we are speaking of Nothing.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Sortes Sacrae\n", "completion": " The penultimate essay in Sabine Baring-Gould's 1869 collection Curiosities Of Olden Times is entitled \"Sortes Sacrae\", wherein we find this:\n\"It is not an uncommon case, now-a-days, for pious persons at times of great perplexity, to seek a solution to their difficulties in their Bibles, opening the book at random and taking the first passage which occurs as a direct message to them from the Almighty...\n\"The 11th chapter of Proverbs, which contains thirty-one verses, is often taken to give omen of the character of a life. The manner of consulting it is simple; it is but to look for the verse answering to the day of the month on which the questioner was born. The answer will be found in most cases to be exceedingly ambiguous.\"\nElsewhere in the essay, Baring-Gould suggests that such augury from the Bible is by no means reliable, but I know better, and it was with trembling hands that I turned to Proverbs, Chapter 11, in the King James Version of course, and read verse 29:\n\"He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.\"\nThis, then, is the infallible omen of my life.

What in the name of heaven can this mean?\nThe best way to find out, of course, would be to question Old Key himself. But where to find this eldritch figure, shrouded in a moth-eaten black cape besplattered with stars, a pointy hat atop his potato-shaped head? Old Key is famously elusive, and indeed some say he does not actually exist.\nEven if he does exist, I have to say that the appearance of two entirely different sets of prognostications casts doubt on the worth of Old Key's scrying skills.

What seems important to hacks as the year takes its last gasps may, in fifty or a hundred years' time, be quite forgotten, and 2011 may be remembered for other events entirely, ones which, to us who lived through them, seem trivial and unworthy of remark.\nSo when I was commissioned by the editors of The Dabbler to write my own review of 2011, I put on my futurologist's cap (satin and wool, tassles, earflaps) and, with the aid of Dr Baxter's Invigorating Brain Syrup, I looked at the year through the eyes of a Man Of The Future.

{"prompt": "Chasm Of Vases\n", "completion": " The usual pronunciation of vase, in this country, is as a rhyme with mars. In the United States, it is more common for vase to rhyme with lace. Growing up on an Essex council estate with a Belgian mother whose native tongue was Flemish, however, I learned to rhyme vase with jaws.\nThis was but one example of my mother's idiosyncratic English. She spoke of the old films we loved to watch as being \"in white and black\", and regularly deployed a sort of guttural expostulation my sister still refers to as \"the Flemish sound\". This was used to express a vast swathe of emotions, from surprise to incredulity to contempt to disgust to ... well, pretty much any response.\nThe word chasm is one that we probably encounter more in written than spoken English. My mother pronounced it with a soft ch, as in chase or chicken. So I did too, on the rare occasions I said it aloud. I only learned the correct, hard c pronunciation in my late teens, when I was reading a passage aloud in an English class at school and my teacher raised an amused eyebrow. He gently corrected me when I finished reading.\nMany years have passed, but I still find myself drawn inexorably to the pronunciations I learned at my mother's knee.

This was duly provided in the form of a cupboard full of documents, all of which had been signed by the pointyhead and countersigned by the pointyhead's own pointyhead person. By skim-reading just one bulging Lever arch file, Mr Key learned that there was a whole hierarchy of risk tsars, risk rapporteurs, risk champions, risk adjudicators, and whatnot.

Would you, for example, be in possession of a picture of this fabled canine?\nOn another matter, with reference to your piece Hendiadys In Mudchute, am I correct in thinking that there is a figure of speech, or it might be a disease of poultry, called chickendiadys?\nI look forward to hearing from you regarding both these riveting topics.\nIn answer to Dr Pastry's queries, the one about the dog being (A) and the one about the chicken being (B), my responses are:\n\n(A) Yes\n    and (B) No.\n###"}

Indeed, so grumpy did I become that I could only becalm myself by mooing like a cow, which I am given to understand is a proven relaxation technique peddled by stress counsellors. I mooed the afternoon away, and so intensely did I immerse myself in cowdom that, at dusk, I found myself standing in a field, staring blankly at nothing, while gnats and midges hovered in the air around me.\nWhile I was thus engaged, Antipodean Hooting Yard researcher Glyn Webster made better use of his time. He has devised an extremely helpful Table Of Non-Blotzmann Smileys which is reproduced below.

For reasons never explicit, everybody in the minibus thoroughly disapproved of me. My sense of this was vivid and distressing, and I was very glad to wake from it.\nI told Pansy Cradledew I had had a bad dream. \"I was the subject of disapproval,\" I said. She laughed. \"When people say they have bad dreams you expect them to say 'I was terrified' or something similar. But no, you were merely subject to disapproval.\" She found this highly amusing.\nLater I was able to reflect that things could be much worse. I learned that Auberon Waugh's maternal grandfather was told by a foolish friend that a guaranteed cure for blindness was to have all of one's teeth removed. He arranged for this to be done, contracted blood poisoning as a result, and died at the age of 43.\n###"}

For her folk herded cows through the seasons long, but they also jumped and leaped. They would wander into the market square of a town down in some dale, and they'd bounce up and down and gambol about wearing coats of many hues. And the songs they sang! Oh, the songs they sang were as strange as strange could be. I remember one that went \"Vienna--it means nothing to me\". All caked and painted were their carts, yellow, green and blue. But my true love's cart was black as pitch, as black as the raven and crow. I stand in the hills in an icy gale wondering where will my true love go?

You're getting yourself all flustered, Mrs Gubbins,\" said Daisy, a little sharply, \"Just because you forgot to insert a backslash into the command line for the ActiveX Pod System Tray Default.\"\nReminded of this peccadillo, Mrs Gubbins became even more agitated, toppled off her ergonomic extruded-plastic workstation seating module, and landed on the floor, threshing about in an alarming fashion.\n\"Dearie me,\" muttered Daisy to herself, and resolved at once to call an ambulance, despite the storm which was now raging outside like something from the imagination of the painter John Martin. She flipped through her Rolodex looking for the telephone number of the Bodger's Spinney Ambulance Station, which was close by, but without her spectacles--which she had unaccountably left in the office kitchenette while making some Bovril earlier--she was as good as blind. \"One of these days I'll forget my own head!\" she chuckled, in her fluting croak.*\nMeanwhile a stream of drool was flowing from Mrs Gubbins' thin-lipped mouth, and her head was turning green ...\n* NOTE : Pedantic readers may argue that a croak cannot be fluting, but they have not heard Daisy De'Ath speak.

Pansy, it transpired, had fashioned a figurine of the hideous bat god Fatso, his \"look\" based on the equally hideous bat god Camazotz, and the removal of the head was a temporary measure to expedite the drying and setting process.

Perhaps you are holding a plastic bag filled with the torn-up remains of a loaf of bread with which you intend to feed the ducks. You have been known to do such a thing, on a Sunday morning perhaps, come rain or shine. Now, what I want you to consider is as follows. Do you think there are any circumstances, whether on a Sunday morning or at any other time, when you might look at the famished expectant ducks paddling towards you, and single out one particular duck, and say to yourself, \"Hmm, that duck looks lugubrious\"?\nCan a duck take on a lugubrious air? This is no idle question. For whether the answer is Yea or Nay, further and more cogent questions present themselves, tumbling over each other in their urgency to be answered. \"If so, how?\" or \"If not, why not?\" are clearly the next in line, but it does not stop there. To arrive at honest answers to all the succeeding questions will take all your wit and insight, and a knowledge not only of ducks and other waterfowl but of biology and psychology and the engines of perception and optics and so on, ad infinitum. You see, as each question begets another, by the time you have finished answering them--not that you will ever really finish answering them, more that you will faint from exhaustion--you will know everything there is to know about everything in the universe.\nThat being so, the lugubrious duck has earned its crusts of bread a thousandfold. So feed it now, before you swoon.\n###"}

Ahead of us was a family group, and I recognised among them the tall lugubrious figure of Will Self. Shortly thereafter, I discovered that my cigarette lighter was kaput. So I asked Mr Self for a light.

Certainly not me, which is why I pranced majestically through the south London streets in freezing temperatures yesterday evening to go and listen to Jonathan Faiers explain all.\nUnfortunately, Dr Faiers turned out to be an academic, so his talk--which contained some interesting and intriguing snippets--was couched in dreadful brain-numbing postmodern gobbledegook. I realise that to carve out a career in modern academia you have to talk and write like that, but how one yearns to hear a simple, straightforward sentence! Instead, it's all \"discourses interrogating notions of the Other\", blah blah bollocks. I think \"interrogate\", in its various forms, popped out of Dr Faiers' mouth half a dozen times in little more than twenty minutes. I would happily have subjected him to a proper interrogation, tied to a chair in a secret police basement with a Klieg light shoved in his face.\nThings were not helped by the fact that he was unable to master the technology to show us the film clips with which he meant to illustrate his blather. These would have included scenes from The King Of Comedy (Martin Scorsese, 1983), Breakfast At Tiffany's (Blake Edwards, 1961), Rosemary's Baby (Roman Polanski, 1968), and Double Indemnity (Billy Wilder, 1944). You see what I mean? It could have been very interesting indeed.\nIn spite of all, I do applaud Dr Faiers for his title. \"Knitting And Catastrophe In The Cinema\" deserves its place in any list of highly amusing academic studies, alongside the one I devised thirty years ago, in tandem with my then colleague, the journalist and television person Tracey MacLeod.

Without your own shadow, and the telegraph poles which follow the supposed trail, you'd be as hopeless as a sparrow in the oven.\nArthur Rimbaud, in his account of crossing the Alps in 1878, quoted in Somebody Else : Arthur Rimbaud In Africa 1880-91 by Charles Nicholl (1997)\n###"}

Whoever named someone Sago? Sago is a sort of pudding, not a boy's or girl's name. Well, it's the pith found inside the stems of some cycad plants, the pith that forms the basis of the pudding, rather than the pudding itself. The pith is first ground to a coarse flour, washed carefully to leach out natural toxins, then dried and cooked to become a starchy granular fecula. It is very similar to tapioca and is used for many of the same purposes. What it is most certainly not is a child's name, orphaned or otherwise. Don't try to give me any lessons about precision and exactitude.\nAnd another thing. It is not clear from your farrago of invented twaddle how old this tot is meant to be, but no one under the age of about a hundred and seven says things like \"that is my story in its broad outlines\".

{"prompt": "Gruesome and Turgid\n", "completion": " The television arm of the Hooting Yard Foundation is currently developing a drama series based on the detective stories of F X Duggleby. Fans of his fiction will know that DCI Gruesome is irascible, vain, hirsute, and mordant, that he keeps a colony of fruitbats in his attic, and that he invariably solves his crimes using a ratiocinative method similar to--if not wholly plagiarised from--M. P. Shiel's Prince Zaleski. (Duggleby goes so far as to have the DCI spend long hours loitering in a gazebo.) His assistant, Sgt Turgid--highly-strung, imprudent, bedizened, yet valiant, a keen Reader's Digest reader--bears a striking resemblance to Frankenstein's monster. In the first book of Duggleby's series, The Murder of the Murderous Murderer, he is described thus: \"His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and his straight black lips. His voice, when at last he spoke, was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence.\" I mention this because the casting director is completely stumped, having failed to persuade veteran Eric Sykes and Melvin \"Mad Max\" Gibson to take the lead roles.

{"prompt": "Vacancy-Between-The-Ears\n", "completion": " For the past few days I have fallen victim to the disorder known as vacancy-between-the-ears. Contrary to popular belief, this malady does not mean that the head is entirely empty. There are, for example, certain fugitive thoughts that flit through, such as \"I think I shall make another cup of tea\" or \"I shall pop out to the corner shop and spend my latest Old Halob subscription\". But when vacancy-between-the-ears strikes, the victim is hard pressed to have more interesting thoughts than these, and it is the more interesting thoughts that give rise, in the general run of things, to Hooting Yard postages.\nSo, for example, the idea of nipping out to buy a pouch of acrid Serbian tobacco does not lend itself to paragraphs of tremendous prose, of which postages are wrought. It is, of course, possible that something exciting may occur during the nipping-out, such as the sight of a flock of bitterns, or the inadvertent stepping into a puddle, or perhaps a religious revivalist meeting with hymns and tambourines and hellfire-and-brimstone preaching. But one of the distressing effects of vacancy-between-the-ears is that even diversions such as these fail to set the cranial synapses a-snapping. The scribbler is bereft.\nIn these circumstances, the best thing to do is to embrace the vacancy and make no effort to cram anything into it.

{"prompt": "Pointy Town Drinking Dens\n", "completion": " One of the more unusual features of Pointy Town is that its sots and topers gather in beer palaces and gin gardens, rather than the more familiar vice versas. This idiosyncratic arrangement of drinking dens is thought to date back to the time of Robin Hod, the bricklaying outlaw dressed all in green, who stole from a ditch to give to a Boer. Who knew there were Boers in Pointy Town? It is possible that I have misheard or misunderstood the legend, wittered at me by a passing storyteller I met on a beaten track, and that Robin Hod fenced his stolen goods to a boor, or even a bore. There are plenty of both in Pointy Town, as you quickly learn if you spend any time in one of the beer palaces or gin gardens. What has always puzzled me, more than the possible colony of expat Boers in Pointy Town, is the nature of Robin Hod's ditch theft. I mean, what could you come upon in the average ditch that would be worth stealing? Some mud? Brackish puddle water rife with tiny wriggling beings? A broken and rusty and abandoned pram or bicycle? Certainly not the latter, for the ditches of Pointy Town are famously free of such unsightly excrescences, swept clean, or clean-ish, as they are, once a week, on a rotation system, by the Pointy Town Ditch Maintenance Patrol. It is thought that Robin Hod recruited his so-called \"merry men\" from the ranks of disaffected or incapable Ditch Patrol has-beens. He tried to teach them bricklaying, but the lure of the beer palaces and gin gardens was too powerful. It was almost magnetic, if you can imagine such a thing.\n###"}

The moving spirit behind this avian paradise on earth was one Merrill Stubing, a man who, incidentally, was later to share his name with a fictional character. Although they had nought else in common, this was the name of the captain of The Love Boat, an exciting television series of the 1970s, long after the real \"Bird Man\" Stubing was dead.\nBesotted with birds, Stubing lit upon Bodger's Spinney as the perfect place for his planned sanctuary after accidentally wandering across it when he got lost on a Sunday morning jaunt with his colleagues from the Pastry Works. Hurling his considerable energy into the project, Stubing called for a meeting of interested parties, where he outlined his vision as follows:\nAnd the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it; and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.\nAnd that, children, is why there is a bird sanctuary at Bodger's Spinney.\n###"}

Before I had a chance to ask which of the people depicted I should be looking at, the spiv scampered away, saying he had to buy tickets for an anniversary concert in which television person Keith Chegwin would reprise his vocal accompaniment to the Third Ear Band's soundtrack for The Tragedy Of Macbeth (Roman Polanski, 1971).\n\nIf the spiv is to be believed, one of the people in the picture above is Old Halob.

{"prompt": "International Bog Day\n", "completion": " According to the superb wikipedia, tomorrow is International Bog Day, a time for all of us to sing the praises of sphagnum. I am distraught to note that for once the wiki is wrong, as the celebration came five days early this year. However, one sure way to recover from such a trauma is to ponder all the other special days or weeks that are celebrated around the world. I am particularly fond of \"Awareness Weeks\", those times when we are urged to raise our consciousness about--usually--health-related matters. But why should nosebleeds, coughing fits, running sores and botched trepanning operations get all the attention? It's time to broaden the range. I therefore propose that next week should become Potato Awareness Week, with Wednesday as International Pencil Sharpener Day. Before introducing an exciting new calendar, however, I ought to check up on what already exists. I am sure there must be a website somewhere giving comprehensive details of all these things, but I haven't found it. If any reader can help, please send details of useful links.\n###"}

You may not know this, but for over a year now I have been working on a hand-drawn map of Hooting Yard and its environs, or hinterland.

Certain passages you have written have allowed me to make educated guesses regarding the whereabouts of Pointy Town and--albeit with difficulty--Tantarabim.

Darwin, in his Zoonomia, reports a case where an officer, holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel, could not tolerate a breakfast in which this odious article was wanting; but, as a savage retribution invariably supervened within an hour or two upon this act of insane sensuality, he came to a resolution that life was intolerable with muffins, but still more intolerable without muffins. He would stand the nuisance no longer; but yet, being a just man, he would give nature one final chance of reforming her dyspeptic atrocities. Muffins, therefore, being laid at one angle of the breakfast-table, and loaded pistols at another, with rigid equity the Colonel awaited the result. This was naturally pretty much as usual: and then, the poor man, incapable of retreating from his word of honour, committed suicide,-having previously left a line for posterity to the effect (though I forget the expression), \"That a muffinless world was no world for him: better no life at all than a life dismantled of muffins\".\nThomas De Quincey, \"On the Temperance Movement of Modern Times\", Tait's Edinburgh Magazine (1845)\n\n###"}

While trying to rid herself of the aforementioned insects, the Flashing Neon Foreshadowing kicks in, and Laura \"lay a bruised and bleeding mass of humanity in the darksome depth of the old disused quarry, where her victim, the palefaced girl, had stood and shuddered, as she thought of the horror of a fall into that dreadful darkness!\" (231)\"\n###"}

But I digress.\nThe point of this item is to record my favourite fact about the recently-departed Ronald Wilson Reagan, fortieth President Of The United States. Incidentally, I read somewhere that within the government bureaucracy, the office is known by the acronym POTUS. This seems a much better word than \"President\". In Britain we have a \"Queen\" (in itself a strange word--repeat it a few times and it begins to sound like something out of Edward Lear ) so perhaps the US ought to have a \"Potus\".\nWhere was I? Oh yes. When Ron and Nancy retired to California, they moved to a place in Bel Air bought for them by friends. The address was 666 St Cloud Road, but they were so appalled at sharing a house number with the Number of the Beast that they persuaded the civic authorities to change their number to 668--effectively, the Neighbour of the Beast. I've always wondered about the knock-on effect of that for the people living at the existing 668 and upwards, in a dull-witted and trivial kind of way.\nSome of those affable types who like to study the Book of Revelations have noted that each of the ex-Potus's three names has six letters, suggesting that changing his house number was just a wily deceit to throw investigators off the scent.

I have convinced myself that, once I fully grasp every last little detail of the deaths of the modernists, I will be in a much better position to winkle some meaning out of the endless clogged blather of standard po-mo prose. Some would say it is not worth the effort, and they are probably correct, so perhaps I ought to put the whole project into a dustbin or wastepaper basket. What a quandary!\n###"}

Where it says do, don't, and where it says don't, do. When you can do or don't with practised ease your conduct will be unbecoming. To become becoming again, simply undo the don'ts and do's.

My tiny daughter has grown fond of Willie \"Woo Woo\" Wong's swings, and is often to be heard screaming and gurgling with delight, noises which in an uncanny way remind me of the eldritch wailings of the Woohoohoodiwoo Woman as she skips and trudges around in the dark dark woods on moonlit nights.

{"prompt": "The Potato, Certain Beliefs Regarding\n", "completion": " \"The folklore of the plant is meagre, considering its wide distribution, but there are a number of curious superstitions connected with it. In some parts there is a belief that it thrives best if planted on Maundy Thursday; in others, that if planted under certain stars it will become watery. In Devonshire the people believe that the potato is a certain cure for the toothache--not taken internally, but carried about in the pocket. It is by several writers mentioned as a reputed cure for rheumatism in the same way; only it is prescribed that, in order to be an effective cure in such cases, the potato should be stolen. Mr. Andrew Lang mentions an instance of faith in the practice of this cure, which he came across in a London drawing-room. He regards this belief as a survival of the old superstitions about mandrake, and as analogous to the habit of African tribes who wear roots round the neck as protection against wild animals.\"\nBenjamin Taylor, Storyology : Essays In Folk-Lore, Sea-Lore, And Plant-Lore (1900)\nADDENDUM : It may be worth noting here that, if you were suffering from rheumatism in Aveyron, and, in attempting a cure, stole a potato from the Wild Boy of that place, he would begin to scream.

{"prompt": "The Bells!\n", "completion": " I greatly admire those who devote time and energy to the study of extremely arcane, obscure, or specialised subjects. Such as Robert Killick-Kendrick, whose obituary appears in today's Grauniad. Though he was \"a man of many interests, which included guitar playing, choral singing, hiking and photographing the numerous butterflies that visited his garden\"- and possibly sharing his wife's major preoccupation (she is \"an expert on sand flies\")--our hero is particularly to be acclaimed for this:\nHe also made a study of domestic animals' bells, ranging from elephants in India to hunting dogs in southern France, which resulted in a scholarly, but sadly uncompleted book, illustrated mainly with his own photographs.\nIncidentally, elsewhere in the Grauniad today, in the Weekend magazine, there is a photograph of what must surely be the most coveted Christmas gift of the year--of any year!--an Alain De Botton action figure.

A similar result is obtained by using raven's dung, wrapped in wool and attached to the body, or else sparrow's dung, warmed with oil and injected into the ear on the side affected. This last remedy, however, is productive of an intolerable itching, for which reason it is considered a better plan to rub the part with the ashes of young sparrows burnt upon twigs, mixed with vinegar for the purpose.\"\nPliny The Elder, The Natural History (AD 77-79)\n###"}

{"prompt": "Club Key\n", "completion": " I am not sure whether to be amused or nauseated to learn that the cleverest person in the known universe is launching Club Fry, \"an arena, a forum, a social network, a sodality, a society for the sharing of knowledge and passions\". Nice to know it's all being organised by what he calls \"my team\".\nHere at Haemoglobin Towers, I've decided that the only possible response is to set up Club Key. Not having a team of spellbound acolytes to do the jiggery-pokery, it might take some time to get it up and running. But what can you expect if you sign up?\nClub Key members will meet online, once a month, dressed in the club uniform of food-splattered cybertunics. Discussion will be limited to ornithological topics, for obvious reasons, and grunting, whimpering, whingeing and prating will be actively encouraged. Think of it, not as a Club Fry-style arena or forum blah blah blah, nor as the modern equivalent of a literary salon or eighteenth century coffee house, but as a pond, a brackish and stagnant pond, upon the bottom of which you wallow, breathing through a straw poking up into the stale air above, which is swarming with midges and gnats. Occasionally members will be given the opportunity to sprawl in a virtual drainage ditch, batting away flies and even vultures. Both hissy fits and projectile vomiting will be allowed.\nAll club meetings will be recorded and posted on YouBoot, a version of the video sharing site which concentrates on violent kicking and stamping while wearing big sturdy hiking boots of the pixellated variety.\nI have every confidence that this initiative is going to take off in a big way, and that we shall easily outnumber the members of Club Uberbrain. In fact, I have such faith in the project that to get things started I'm going to splatter my cybertunic with genetically modified sponge pudding and go and round up some injured swallows from the local injured birds hospice right this minute.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "World O' Sport\n", "completion": " One of the great pleasures of the Olympic Games is listening to the commentators on radio and television. For one thing, there are all those obscure, minority activities for which arcane and incomprehensible terms have been coined. Listen to a skeet shooting or, in the Winter Olympics, curling commentator and you will be lucky to understand a word of what they say. Those whose remit is more familiar--athletics, gymnastics--have to do their best to compete. Thus, yesterday, I was delighted by the BBC pundit who noted, with due gravitas, of an entrant in one of those events where athletes run repeatedly around a track, \"I've been dubious about her hydration\". One can only echo that sentiment. For my part, I know that dubiousness about hydration is always to the forefront of my mind when watching people in numbered vests running around with that gleam of demented concentration in their eyes.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Aztec Fundamentalism\n", "completion": " Ye gods and little fishes! It seems you can't breathe a word about religion these days without being deemed \"offensive\". Yesterday's piece A Weekend With An Owl God brought to my postbag a letter from Stephen Atahualpagreen of Aztec Voice:\nDear Mr Key : I am writing to protest in the strongest possible terms about your slanderous treatment of the Aztec faith. Traducing the name of our night owl god Chalchiuhtecolotl in such disgusting terms is not funny. It is deeply offensive to our most cherished beliefs. Like any other religion, the Aztec faith demands respect in 21st century Britain, which means, among other things, respecting our cultural right to practice a bloody form of human sacrifice on big stone altars. As well as feeling wounded and offended, your attack has also made us angry, and you know what happens when the gods get angry. Please send me your postal address and telephone number so I can publish them on our website and provoke other Aztec believers to exact the retribution which is your due fate.\nI did a bit of research into Mr Atahualpagreen.

Who would not marvell, that either himselfe should be of that beliefe, or hope to persuade others to his opinion? For what child is there to be found so simple and ignorant, who will beleeve, that birds should keep their times to shed tears  every yere so duly, and especially so great drops and in such quantitie, sufficient to engender Amber in that abundance? Besides, what congruitie is there, that birds should depart as far as to the Indians and beyond, for to mourn and lament the death of Meleager when he died in Greece?\n\"What should a man say to this? Are there not many more as goodly tales as these, which Poets have sent abroad into the world? And their profession of Poetry, that is to say, of faining and devising fables, may in some sort excuse them.

Perhaps the most laughable thing is the idea that he is some kind of edgy intellectual maverick. From his many appearances in the Grauniad and on the BBC, I think it is clear that he is in possession of the Middle-Class Student Wanker's starter pack marked 'This is what you think'. All his opinions are predictable and orthodox. If there is such a thing as the \"metropolitan liberal elite\", he is a card-carrying member. For example, he believes that everyone who voted for Brexit is probably a racist. Such simplistic twaddle will always get you applause and whooping from a Question Time audience, a fairly reliable indicator of vacuous dimwittery.\nI fear, however, that I will forever be linked with the wretched Self, given that his one useful contribution to the world was giving Mr Key a light for his cigarette in the midst of a downpour in south London.\n###"}

Over my bed I have a gas-jet so properly shaded that the rays of light are concentrated and reflected downward upon the volume which I am reading. Miss Susan insists that much of this light and its attendant heat falls upon my head, compelling there a dryness of the scalp whereby the follicles have been deprived of their natural nourishment and have consequently died. She furthermore maintains that the welsh-rarebits of which I partake invariably at the eleventh hour every night breed poisonous vapors and subtle megrims within my stomach, which humors, rising by their natural courses to my brain, do therein produce a fever that from within burneth up the fluids necessary to a healthy condition of the capillary growth upon the super-adjacent and exterior cranial integument.\"\n--Eugene Field, The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac.\nEugene Field also wrote, among many other works, the children's rhyme Wynken, Blynken & Nod.

{"prompt": "M. Bazard To Mme. Francey\n", "completion": " Not being an evildoer myself, I find it hard to believe that one of my fellow creatures--what am I saying?--a monster, indeed, could have obliged a woman to point a revolver at his head, and I am even less capable of explaining his flight.\nI am no hero of bravado, but I am not afraid; I do not court danger, but I have courage, sustained energy, and a will of iron . . . To be killed by a bullet from the revolver of a pretty woman, held in an adorable hand, aimed by eyes that could make an Andalusian's pale by comparison . . . Few men can hope to die that way.\nIn this life, one is exposed to many things: one can be bitten by a mad dog, stung by a fly, run over by an omnibus, or be the victim of a derailing. A termite can slyly find its way into your ceiling, you can suddenly receive some bad news, you can catch cholera, you can burn your mustache, you can be blinded by a falling star, you can have a mother-in-law, you can lose your umbrella . . .\nHippolyte Bazard, in a letter to Henriette Francey after she had threatened him with a pistol. A few days later, she shot him dead. Quoted in Victorian Murderesses : A True History Of Thirteen Respectable French And English Women Accused Of Unspeakable Crimes by Mary S Hartman (1977)\n###"}

It appears that the only thing they had in common was early rising and, above all, not dozing off once they were awake. Most important.\nBefore you adopt this practice, it is well to bear in mind that I read somewhere--I wish I could recall where--of another fellow who I think also lived to a great age, and who made it his habit frequently to lean against a wall and take a nap, sleeping standing up, like a horse.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tarleton On His Balcony\n", "completion": " Exciting news! Tarleton is back on his balcony! He is eating a plum! It is a Carlsbad plum! He gazes across the city and the wasteland into the distance, where the pinky-russet peaks of the Pinky-Russet Mountains shimmer in the haze! From one of Tarleton's ears dangles a piratical earring, but there is no piratical parrot on his shoulder! He has, though, acquired, since last we met him, a wooden leg!\nTarleton's brief, we might recall, was to gouge and hew. Gouge and hew he did, heroically, losing a leg in the process. But he did not complain. He showed fortitude. I was encamped at Fort Hoity, he said to himself, and then at Fort Toity, so it is only meet that, in forts, I show fortitude. No wonder Tarleton was showered with petunia petals by adoring peasants. There remain a few petals in his hair, for it is a long time since he shampooed it.\nIt is a long time, too, since last he stood upon this balcony, eating a plum. It is so long ago that he only dimly remembers. More vivid are the memories of Fort Hoity, with its ostriches and bandages and zinc, and Fort Toity, with champions arrayed along the crenellations, and games of spit-in-the-gutter. It was between forts that Tarleton lost his leg to a crocodile.\nIn the middle ages, returning crusaders brought with them the embalmed bodies of crocodiles, which were wrapped in chains and hung from the ceilings of cathedrals. Tarleton did not think of his gouging and hewing as a crusade, but it was, oh it was.\nHe spits out the plumstone into the palm of his hand, makes a fist, and, taking careful aim, tosses it over the edge of the balcony down into the shallow pool around the fountain. How many Carlsbad plumstones lie there, barely submerged! He has never once missed a toss. Tarleton turns and withdraws into his chamber. His head is full of squeaking imaginary bats.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Pin Bulletin Number One\n", "completion": " This is the first instalment of the Hooting Yard Pin Bulletin, an important new series published as a service to readers who wish to be kept informed of all things pin-related. Here, for example, is a very useful tip from one Judy Amarose: When pushing pins into a foam board, try using a metal thimble. That will help save your fingers! You know, I think Judy is right. Dobson, of course, wrote about pins on a number of occasions, most famously in his pamphlet There's Hours Of Fun To Be Had With A Handful Of Pins, the only one of his works to be published under a pseudonym. The first edition of fifty-six copies, run off the press by Marigold Chew despite the fact that she had a collapsed lung at the time, purported to be by an author named \"Blenkinsop\". When a second edition--of just four copies--was printed a decade later, Dobson reverted, wisely I think, to his real name. Jed Git, the wastrel Dobson scholar who perished in the 1958 Munich Air Disaster alongside the \"Busby Babes\", hailed what he called \"that pin pamphlet\" as among the works that would prove to be timeless classics, celebrated a thousand years after their author's demise. He was wrong in this, as in so many things. Incidentally, forty-six years after his death, Jed Git's paramour still places a posy of primroses on his tomb on the sixth of February every year. The primroses are invariably withered.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Three Blue Days of Imbecilic Glee\n", "completion": " The first blue day of imbecilic glee was a Tuesday towards the end of March. In truth, the day was not blue, for there was frightful storminess, a blizzard of hailstones, and much tempest and wrack. Nevertheless, when looking back, I remember other things. I remember how we laughed even though our picnic plans were dashed. I remember how we pretended the cow in the field was a Magus, bewitching us. I remember how we ran back to the house and spent the afternoon playing a game of Ayn Rand! Every time you shouted a sentence from The Fountainhead and I countered with one from Atlas Shrugged, the uproar was such that Mr Loog Oldham next door took off his big black boot and hammered on the wall. I remember the embers at the end of that first blue day.\nThe second blue day of imbecilic glee was that day we took our bicycles on the train to the fishing village at the end of the world and painted watercolours of the post office and bought stamps and drank Tizer and we were followed around the village by a one-eyed dog with terrible fangs and you wanted to take it home and all afternoon the shrill singing of the orphanage choir filled our ears and I found a tiny toy plastic pig in a thicket of stinging nettles and we cycled all the way home along that dangerous road as huge container lorries thundered past us in both directions.\nThe third blue day of imbecilic glee is today.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dobson After Death\n", "completion": " Committed Dobsonists often turn their minds to the perplexing question of how the out of print pamphleteer would have coped with the 21st century. It is difficult to imagine him in our world o' bleeping digital flummery 'n' pap, is it not? But now I think I have stumbled upon something which clearly calls out for the great man's talents.\nAccording to this piece about the red tape by which our doughty coppers are being strangled, \"some constabularies have a 44-page booklet for recording collisions between two cars\". Of course, as soon as I read this, my immediate thought was \"O Dobson! If thou wert with us now!\" Rather than subsisting in penury, the pamphleteer could make a pretty penny offering his services to these police constabularies. He was capable of scribbling a 44-page pamphlet about any subject under the sun as easily as you or I could freeze to death in an Antarctic blizzard, and with considerably more aplomb. Alas, he passed over to the ethereal realm before getting the chance to add to the canon such potential masterworks as An Essay Upon The Unfortunate Collision Between A Skoda And A Trabant, or How I Learned About A Terrible Road Accident In Which Two Cars Smashed Into Each Other At Inhuman Speed.\nStill, next time I am invited to play the parlour game What Would Dobson Do Today?, I think I have a good chance of winning top points.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Fatso Versus Camazotz\n", "completion": " I have received a bat-letter from Miss Dimity Cashew.\nDear Mr Key, she writes, Like most people, I have always believed that the hideous bat god Fatso is the most terrifying of all bat deities. This has been an article of faith for as long as I can remember. However, I recently stumbled upon Wayne Ferrebee's blog Ferrebeekeeper, where I discovered some rather alarming details about Camazotz, the Death Bat. Now, while I am no expert on bat deities and their varying levels of hideousness, violence, and terror, it seems to me that Camazotz would prove a formidable opponent were he and the hideous bat god Fatso pitted against each other in some kind of apocalyptic clash of bat deities. Your views on the likely outcome of such a battle would be much appreciated, also of course the betting odds, in case I fancied taking a flutter.\nYours primly, Dimity Cashew (Miss)\nPS--I enclose a snapshot of Camazotz from Mr Ferrebee's blog, so you can appreciate just how terrifying he is.

{"prompt": "Aerated Celerywater\n", "completion": " \nLudicrously obsessed as I am by the Kennedy assassination, my current reading is Vincent Bugliosi's Four Days In November (2007), an extraordinarily detailed narrative of the events in Dallas forty-eight years ago. Bugliosi, famed as the prosecutor in the Manson murders, has won great respect for his \"precise and definitive\" account, \"put[ting] all the pieces together\", carefully documenting his tale with thousands of footnotes referring to primary sources.\nYet here I am, on page 310, when we have arrived at 1.50 AM on Saturday 23 November, and I am ready to toss the book across the room in exasperation. Why?\n\"Most of Dallas is asleep when Ruby finally enters the KLIF building after Russ Knight gets back from City Hall and opens the door. Several of the guys on duty are glad to see Jack's big paper sack full of corned-beef sandwiches and soft drinks. \"I figured you guys would be hungry,\" Jack tells them, \"and I brought these up for you.\" Knight and DJ Danny McCurdy were intrigued by Doctor Black's celery tonic in its peculiarly shaped bottle and expensive-looking gold foil, which neither of them had ever seen before. Whoever heard of a soft drink with celery in it? Jack explains that it's something you normally get only in New York and is especially pleased when McCurdy thinks it's the best soft drink he's ever had.\"\nThere is, of course, no such drink as \"Doctor Black's celery tonic\". Bugliosi is confusing it with Doctor Brown's celery tonic, also known as Cel-Ray. If he cannot get that right, if he muddles Black with Brown, how can we trust anything he says in this bulky doorstop of a book? Such inaccurate flimflam is enough to have me signing up to the absurd and paranoid Oliver Stone-Jim Garrison theories about the case.\nMcCurdy may have asked \"Whoever heard of a soft drink with celery in it?\" but a more pertinent question is surely \"Whoever would have thought that a soft drink with celery in it would prove so crucial a factor in the Kennedy assassination?\"\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"On ships, attempts to melt the ice...\"\n", "completion": " \"On ships, attempts to melt the ice by buckets of hot water or by steam jets are only partially effective, because a great deal of heat is needed to melt a little ice. Further, if the temperature is still below freezing point when the operation is being carried out, the melted ice may freeze again unless it can be pushed overboard first. Mechanical detachment of the ice is no easy matter, for ice adheres most tenaciously to clean, grease-free surfaces and a ship has often been thoroughly de-greased by wind-swept rain and spray before it becomes iced-up.\" -- G Van Praagh, De-Icing Of Ships\n###"}
{"prompt": "Chains and Waters\n", "completion": " Last week I borrowed from the library Adam Nicolson's Power And Glory : Jacobean England And The Making Of The King James Bible. It's a splendid read, packed with nuggets of interest. At the moment, I'm at the point where Nicolson takes us back to the 1580s and the persecution of the Separatist puritans. (It was this lot, incidentally, who started the fad for naming their children after moral or holy qualities--Eschew-Evil, Sin-deny, Increased, Much-mercy, and, my favourite, Wrestling Brewster.) Many of the Separatists fled to Holland, but those who didn't ended up in prison. \"One of them,\" writes Nicolson, \"the eighteen-year-old Roger Waters, was kept in irons for more than a year.\"\nNow this seems a savage punishment for questioning the basis of the Church of England, but it led me to think that, four hundred years later, it would have been a pretty lenient way of dealing with the poor lad's namesake. Writing Another Brick In The Wall, by itself, is probably worth at least five years in chains, and there are sundry other crimes to account for.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Club Hooting Yard\n", "completion": " Book groups and reading clubs have become immensely popular in recent years, so it is unsurprising--if pleasing--that various Hooting Yard Study Groups have sprung up on at least three continents. As their name implies, the Study Groups adopt a more rigorous and earnest approach to texts than the often dilettanteish approach of the average book group. In Winnipeg, for example, where a group meets on a weekly basis, they have thus far spent six sessions on a close reading of the Istvan & Zoltan stories. (See the Unhelpful Index to locate these on the site.) The Dobsonians, a gathering which meets monthly in Ulm, devotes itself only to those items which refer to the out-of-print pamphleteer. Helpfully, they are at work on a catalogue raisonee which they have already entitled the Codex Dobsoniana, though how many years they will take on this valuable work is anybody's guess. Meanwhile, in some godforsaken Antipodean outpost, a trio of readers meet every Thursday to pose each other questions about the previous week's contents. They report that they have been scribbling both the questions and answers in a notebook and that they will photocopy it and send it to me when the book is full.\nI noted that buyers of Microsoft's Encarta encyclopaedia are invited to join something called Club Encarta, and it seemed to me that all these study groups ought to come together under an umbrella Club Hooting Yard.

{"prompt": "Poppycock\n", "completion": " In a review of Ian Jack's The Country Formerly Known As Great Britain, Rachel Cooke writes:\nAlmost all of these wonderful pieces were commissioned by newspapers and magazines. They would never have worked, and would not now work, on the internet, which is so very interested in speed and sensation and so resolutely uninterested in well-researched thoughtfulness; in essays on bus conductors and Sundays and the seaside; in all the small, strange things that make us who we are.\nThis seems to me to be utter poppycock. There is abundant \"well-researched thoughtfulness\" in Interwebshire, plenty about bus conductors and seaside resorts, and a cornucopia of those small, strange things. Hooting Yard is merely one tiny haven of such delights. And surely if one is seeking vapid drivel and \"sensation\", one need look no further than the Grauniad and the Observer (where the review appears).\nThe book itself looks well worth reading:\nJack notes that 1956 was the year in which he and his parents ate their first \"tin of baked beans that also included sausages\", a meal taken while sheltering from the rain beneath a bridge at Lanercost Priory, near Hadrian's Wall. \"My,\" said his father, \"but this is good!\"\nYou can rarely go wrong with a sausage anecdote.\n###"}

Forget Honved, or bees, or the grassy knoll. The clue is in that contraption he used instead of spectacles, in particular that it made use of \"light-reflecting\" mirrors and lenses. Something about that phrase set me thinking, so I went to have a lie down on my day-bed on my veranda in the baking heat, shaded by many parasols brought back from far Cathay. From time to time I took dainty sips from a tumbler of iced nettle and hawthorn cordial, while my cat, Boutros Boutros-Ghali IV, frisked among the hollyhocks with a ball of wool and a small, lost toad which had wandered far from its pond.\nI kept mulling over the words \"light-reflecting\" until I had a eureka moment. Of course! \"Light-reflecting booster technology\", the crucial ingredient of one of L'Oreal's much-advertised shampoo preparations! No one knows what this actually means, least of all the craven expense-account-addled plop-heads at the advertising company, but I have always been an aficionado of booster technology in all its forms, whether light-reflecting or not.\nNow, my question is, did your docent ever show any interest in extreme right wing politics? The founders of L'Oreal were known for their Nazi sympathies, and in fact used a confiscated Jewish property as their HQ in the Vichy years.

Just as music lovers use file-sharing programmes such as Kazaa or WinMX, Audubonistas favour a dedicated piece of software called DownloadAudubonBirdsOfAmericaPictureFilesV1. 04. What is not often realised is that one can access the paintings via any old internet connection, for example by visiting A Bird's Home. To whet the appetites of any readers who have not yet become caught up in the craze, here is this week's chart of the top five downloads (last week's position in brackets).\n1.

{"prompt": "Take One Weasel...\n", "completion": " Here is a simple method of grasping a weasel by the scruff of its neck, hypnotising it, and having it do your bidding.\n1. Take one weasel.\n2. Grasp the weasel by the scruff of its neck and hold it so that its head is no more than a couple of inches from your eyes.\n3. Stare into the eyes of the weasel while making hypnotic weaselly noises.\n4. Place the weasel carefully on your floor and issue it with a command.\n5. When the weasel returns from its mission, pick it up by the scruff of the neck, and repeat step 3, substituting hypnotic weaselly noises with antihypnotic weaselly noises.\n6. Release the weasel.\nWhat could be simpler than that? Indeed, the only difficulty most students find is to think up a suitable command for the hypnotised weasel to obey. Experience shows that tasks involving high-pitched squealing and savagery are likely to achieve the best results. If you are of a squeamish disposition, command the weasel to do its slashing and slaughtering in another room, or even outside, in your front garden, if you have a front garden. Try to remember that weasels will attack most effectively if set upon organisms of equal size, or smaller than themselves, although in certain circumstances they can prove lethal and terrifying pitted against larger beings, particularly if such beings are tethered to a stout post.\nAdvanced students may wish to attempt the grasping, hypnotising, and commanding of more than one weasel at a time.\nEven more advanced students can omit steps 5 and 6, and maintain a pack of hypnotised weasels primed and ready to do their bidding in perpetuity, or until the weasels die.\n###"}

Or so I have been told by my spy at the lab, who keeps me up to date on such matters. It is best to wear a pair of tough Uruguayan Air Force boots over the Socks of Pepintude.

I am going to the post office. Alas, unlike the post office in Plovdiv it is not emblazoned with a mural painted by the Plovdiv Fivesome, but none the less it is a very fine post office. Outside it on the esplanade is a flagpole with a big blue flag flying atop it. The doors are made of some weird iridescent metal and swoosh open as one approaches. Having thrown off any trailing curs and kittens I am going to cause those doors to swoosh and I shall make my decisive strides into the post office lobby, where a cadet in a cadet's cap and tunic will point me towards a queue leading to a counter behind which I know in the innermost fibres of my being there will be a tally-stick person ready to sell me some postage-related items.\nWhen the exchange has been made, I will exit again through the swooshing doors, having saluted the cadet, and I shall stride decisively into the esplanade, and gaze at the flag atop the flagpole, and I shall not flinch.\nSource : Forty Visits To The Post Office by Dobson (out of print)\n###"}
{"prompt": "Robertson's Minerva\n", "completion": " To hell with the Wright Brothers, or Percy Pilcher, or any of those other aviation pioneers being celebrated this week. The man for me is Robertson. In 1804 he published in Vienna a plan for La Minerva, an aerial vessel destined for discoveries, and proposed to all the Academies of Europe, by Robertson, physicist. The Minerva would have a balloon of 150 feet in diameter, made of unbleached silk, coated within and without with india-rubber. For some reason it was imperative that the balloon be manufactured in Lyons. Atop the balloon would gleam a weathercock, \"the symbol of watchfulness\", and at the sides would be two purely ornamental wings. Suspended from the balloon would be a ship, containing a small boat (\"in which the passengers might take refuge in case of necessity, in the event of the larger vessel falling on the sea in a disabled state\"); a store for water, wine and other provisions; silk ladders; closets; the pilot's room; an observatory containing compasses \"and other [unspecified] scientific instruments\"; a room \"fitted up for recreations, walking, and gymnastics\"; a kitchen, medicine room, theatre and music room; a study; and lastly, tents for the \"air-marines\".

Doris thinks they're birds, but her husband has other ideas about this \"sighting\".\nThese days, Jimmy Goddard has a superb suite (if that's the word) of webpages, which are well worth a visit.

{"prompt": "Hen Project\n", "completion": " Now you have spruced up your mud idol, you are probably in the mood to spruce up a few of your other appurtenances. You might have noticed that your hens are looking a bit tatty. It is difficult to work out why this is so, although the neglect into which you have allowed their coop to moulder may have something to do with it. It will probably be a good idea to spruce up the hen coop once you have spruced up the hens themselves, but that is a project for another day, one when it is not raining incessantly, and when a cold wind is not lashing across the yard in a corner of which the coop has been shoved, ramshackle and near collapse.\nThe best way to spruce up a hen is to paint its feathers with henna, obviously. Prepare a large tub of henna and get a paintbrush. Holding the hen in one hand, paint each individual feather with henna, and then replace the hen in the coop. Repeat until all your hens have been spruced up.\nIt may be that being painted enrages one or more of your hens and you may now suffer from lacerations made by their fierce beaks. Dab some sort of gooey antiseptic ointment upon the lacerations, swathe them in bandages, and go and lie down in a darkened room. Before you do so, don't forget to clean the tub and the brushes with hot soapy water. If you do not have any hot water, or soap, you must be a filthy and unprepossessing person, quite unlike your hens, which are now smartly spruced with henna. Passers-by, if there are any, will do a double-take, wondering how so grimy a specimen as yourself has managed to accumulate a coop's worth of such lovely hens. By such disjunctures is the world made that little bit more intriguing.\n###"}

The abiding fascination of basins is subject to almost criminal neglect, a situation we hope to put right. Please note, however, that not all basins are sites of coal extraction, and certainly not of heroic works of coal extraction by Stakhanovites.\n\nIt is unlikely that Ronald Colman ever extracted coal from a basin in his life, heroically or otherwise, but he had other talents, one of which led to him being known as \"the man with the velvet voice\". Colman will never be forgotten, of course, for he starred alongside Greer Garson in the single most heart-rending tear-jerker of all time, Random Harvest.

{"prompt": "Dabbling With Little Ruskin\n", "completion": " \nThis week at The Dabbler I recommend the setting up of a free school with a curriculum devoted to the works of John Ruskin, and include two Tales Of Little Ruskin suitable for reading aloud to tinies. Incidentally, I could not help noticing the manner in which the Grauniad reported the official approval given to the setting up of sixteen such free schools. One idealistic teacher suggested that among the things deemed important in his planned school, in a deprived area, would be good manners and the basic civilised matter of sitting down together at mealtimes. The privately-educated well-brought-up Grauniad staff take these things for granted, of course, but the very idea that they should be inculcated in the lower orders is anathema. The front page headline sneerily misrepresented the plans as teaching \"etiquette and fine dining\".\n###"}

{"prompt": "Diverse And Vibrant\n", "completion": " When Sebastian Coe spoke of \"the greatest tickets on earth\", he was talking twaddle, but at least it was amusing twaddle. Too often, the twaddle babbled by politicians and others is composed of readymade phrases seemingly used to fill time--or, in written form, space--without the inconvenience of thought.\nOne practice that has become ubiquitous is an inability to say \"diverse\" without immediately adding \"vibrant\". The most recent culprit I noted was the cabinet minister Francis Maude, on last week's Question Time. Having told us how great it was that the country is \"diverse\", and not really knowing what else he wanted to say, after a very brief pause he added \"and vibrant\", clearly playing for time.\nSimilarly, the front page headline on a recent issue of my local council's Pravda-style newspaper was a quote from a resident announcing \"I love that the borough is so diverse and vibrant\".\nCan one be diverse without being vibrant? Or vibrant without being diverse? And, if interrogated, chained to a chair in a dank basement, could most of the people trotting out this stuff define what they actually mean by \"vibrant\"?\nHooting Yard--it's diverse! It vibrates!\n###"}

It tells how a young geometer, employed in surveying a country that was still highly localised and almost wholly unmapped, arrived in the village of Les Estables, some forty miles (and about 400 years) away from Lyons. The villagers, simple peasant folk with their simple peasant ways and beliefs, assumed that this outsider, never seen in their village, must therefore be a herald of Satan. They hacked him to pieces.\n###"}

Instead, here is an extract from her 1972 cookbook, 101 Recipes For Croutons And Pith:\nIf you find yourself befuddled at the prospect of serving a nourishing meal to a detachment of visiting functionaries from the Soviet Union, why not do what I do, and try this splendid recipe, number 49? Take the pith of a dozen cucumbers, and a big bag of croutons. Empty the croutons into a tin bowl, then stir in the pith. Leave to stand for half an hour. Crush the mixture to a paste, then roll out flat. Cut into squares and place in a huge saucepan. Add seawater, and bring to the boil. Simmer for ages, drain any water that hasn't evaporated, and serve in bowls. A garnish of mayonnaise is sometimes acceptable, although I wouldn't recommend it.

{"prompt": "The Pastures Red With Uneaten Sheep's Placentas\n", "completion": " To celebrate what would have been Samuel Beckett's one hundred and third birthday on Monday, Nige (whom I've not come across before) quoted from Watt:\n\"The crocuses and the larch turning green every year a week before the others and the pastures red with uneaten sheep's placentas and the long summer days and the new-mown hay and the wood-pigeon in the morning and the cuckoo in the afternoon and the corncrake in the evening and the wasps in the jam and the smell of the gorse and the look of the gorse and the apples falling and the children walking in the dead leaves and the larch turning brown a week before the others and the chestnuts falling and the howling winds and the sea breaking over the pier and the first fires and the hooves on the road and the consumptive postman whistling The Roses Are Blooming in Picardy and the standard oil-lamp and of course the snow and to be sure the sleet and bless your heart the slush and every fourth year the February debacle and the endless April showers and the crocuses and then the whole bloody business starting over again.\"\nAs is probably crystal clear, Watt--along with much else of Beckett's prose--is a key text for Mr Key. It remains for me one of the funniest books I have ever read. I was introduced to Beckett by my English teacher when I was about fifteen. The teacher's name was Dick Shone--the schoolboy joke was that, as an English teacher, he lived in a Dick-Shone-ry.

Devoted readers will recall The Book Of Gnats (collected in the slim anthology We Were Puny, They Were Vapid--buy it now if you have not already done so). In part one, we read:\nAnd then my eyes saw, standing fiery on a wooden plinth ringed by scum-pools, the obscene figure of Winckelmann. In his left hand he brandished aloft a scrap of burning linoleum. His right hand was made into a fist. As, dribbling, I watched, the fist was slowly opened to reveal a.... I cannot say.

{"prompt": "Larder Tips\n", "completion": " Welcome to this month's Hooting Yard Larder Tips. If you have a larder, we strongly recommend that you stack the shelves with lots of jars containing different types of sauce. It is a good idea to glue a label to each jar, bearing the name of the sauce it contains. A bold, clear typeface should be used for the label, not some hasty scrawl made with the last remnant of a crayon. In the unlikely event that you do not drool with glee at the prospect of eating all those sauces, you can instead pack your larder with pots of paste, but follow the same labelling advice. Pots may need smaller labels than jars, so bear that in mind.\nMake sure your larder is airy. If the door shuts very very tight, and by some chance all the air is sucked out of the larder, you will find that you are unable to gain access to your jars of sauce, or pots of paste, because the larder will have become a vacuum, which nature abhors. Readers in the United States who face this quandary may find it useful to contact Dave Aspnes (pictured below) who is the current president of the American Vacuum Society. As Dave says, \"the historic roots of [the Society] are in the creation and measurement of vacuum\", so he should be able to help if your larder becomes one.\n\n###"}

To lay a trap for those future scholars, let me just note here that the Dabbler text includes the word filthy, which is absent from the original Hooting Yard text. This might be connected to the recent appearance on these pages of the filthy magpie. Or it might not.

{"prompt": "The Appian Way\n", "completion": " Next time you go for a stroll along the Appian Way, take a pair of shears with you. Then, if you happen to encounter a hairy slave hurrying along, you can seize him and chop off his hair with the shears.

As a brief taster, here is part of the entry on the great grey shrike:\n\nThe Latin name of the great grey shrike, Lanius excubitor, translates into English as butcher sentinel. Whenever this bird is hereafter mentioned in Hooting Yard, that is what it will be called, as in the sentence \"Oh look,\" said Dobson, taking a pause from hammering a nail into a plank to no apparent purpose, \"There is a butcher sentinel singing its little heart out atop that wooden pale.\"\n###"}
{"prompt": "Belshazzar\n", "completion": " Rembrandt's source for this painting, the Old Testament Book of Daniel (5: 1-6, 25-8), tells of a banquet Belshazzar, King of Babylon, gave for his nobles. At this banquet he blasphemously served wine in the sacred vessels his father Nebuchadnezzar had looted from the Temple in Jerusalem.\nRembrandt shows the moment when a divine hand appeared and wrote on the wall a phrase only Daniel could decipher. When transliterated the inscription reads: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation: 'God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; your kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.' That very night Belshazzar was slain.\nRembrandt derived the form of Hebrew inscription from a book by his friend, the learned Rabbi and printer, Menasseh ben Israel, yet mistranscribed one of the characters and arranged them in columns, rather than right to left, as Hebrew is written. The picture, painted in about 1635, is an example of Rembrandt's attempt to establish himself as a painter of large-scale Baroque history paintings.\nNotes courtesy of the National Gallery, London\n###"}
{"prompt": "Triumph Of The Barbarians, Continued\n", "completion": " I have paid little attention to the current kerfuffle at the BBC. As stated previously, I am intensely relaxed about the fact that some people have far more money than I will ever have, and I cannot bestir myself to get in a flap about it. It is of course preposterous that the ex-Deputy Director General was given a million pound payoff in order to keep him focussed on his decisively important work (or words to that affect) but, heigh ho, that is the way of the world and to expect any better is to live in a fool's paradise.\nAt the same time, I can be roused to a sort of impotent armchair-based fury when these ridiculously overpaid persons make public display of their own witlessness and stupidity. Consider Ian Katz, lately the deputy editor of the Guardian and now installed as the editor of BBC's Newsnight. I do not know how much he is paid but it is no doubt a sum beyond my wildest dreams.\nKatz is the latest in a long line of supposedly intelligent persons who is unable to master the difference between sending a private message and broadcasting it to the entire world. In his editorial role, he apparently sent a \"tweet\" in which he said a Labour shadow minister was boring--for which he later apologised. Frankly, I couldn't care less. It is the sentence that followed the accusation that bothers me. Katz wrote:\nplayout was fun tho, wasn't it? telly MUCH better than snooooozepapers innit\nLet me remind you. This man was deputy editor of a serious newspaper and is now editor of a flagship current affairs programme. No doubt he would say he is being playful and \"ironic\". But for him to even think of writing--and then actually to write--such infantile twaddle is profoundly depressing.\nKatz should be locked in a cupboard with a copy of The Anatomy Of Melancholy, and taken out at intervals to have his brain sluiced.
