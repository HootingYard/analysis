She wanted a cow so she would have a daily supply of milk, and she wanted some worms to provide her with a goodly amount of silk. But the only worms for sale that day were those of the earth and the tape, and the cow she paid good money for was not quite the usual shape. It was a cow in the form of a bear and it stood on its hind legs, and rather than providing her with milk it laid weird furry eggs. For the market to which the farmer's wife went was a market exceeding odd, where all the beasts were blasphemous offences against God. There were spiders with horns and three-legged crows and giraffes from the gates of Hades, and owls spawned from mud and geese with ears and basilisks to frighten the ladies. The gentlemen were terrified too by the pig with ten million eyes, and the bloated sacs with razor wings which swooped down from the skies. 'Twas market day in Scroonhoonpooge when the godly tremble and pray, for the devil sells his monsters on Scroonhoonpooge Market Day.\n###"}

Peeking behind apparitions to check for the presence or absence of Satan is, after all, a long-standing hobby of mine, and I think I have the required skills-set.

I have only just started to read McKie's Gazetteer : A Local History Of Britain, and am smitten (as I knew I would be). David McKie's book is not a comprehensive guide, but a series of essays about places that have caught his interest for one reason or another. The piece on Aberdeen, for example, is largely devoted to a potted biography of Alexander Cruden, the self-styled \"Alexander The Corrector\", compiler of one of the most demented works of scholarship ever fashioned, the Complete Concordance To The Holy Scriptures.\nI clapped my hands in glee to discover that Jaywick had not escaped McKie's attention. Though he does not mention the day the cows came visiting, he is a fount of information on that ill-starred seaside resort, including the fact that it was founded by a man whose nickname was Foff.\nIf you need any further persuading to buy this excellent book, bear in mind that David McKie used to write the Smallweed and McElsewhere columns in the Guardian, where, more than once, he made mention of Hooting Yard.

Van Dongelbracke, however, was merely a janitor. He spent many long hours in his shed, poring over nautical charts and beetle diagrams, plotting his future. Who could have guessed that the actuality would be even more preposterous than his dreams? And his daydreams were fervid, to say the least, hence his frequent run-ins with the Gubernator, who expected, not unreasonably, to see janitorial tasks completed. Rather than sweeping a corridor or emptying wastepaper bins, however, Van Dongelbracke was more likely to be found intoning \"Head... thorax... abdomen\" in a voice like a rasp, as a kettle boiled away for his umpteenth flask of tea and the candles in his shed sputtered and smoked. So far, so uneventful, regardless of the Gubernator's irritation.

Uncharitable, perhaps, for the surveyor had himself once been a cafe pianist, in The Dismal Bat, that haven for baffled people with persistent coughs. Ah, but that had been so long ago. Most of the customers were now in their graves; the cafe itself had been bulldozed to make way for a space-age bird sanctuary; and the pianist, poor curt Kurt, roamed the streets with pad and pencil, jotting down notes about the concrete posts. There were more than seven hundred such posts in Obergruwwel, and no one had thought to survey them until the Town Balaclava Guild sat in special session in the converted gym on that grim, teeming, winter Thursday, behind locked doors, its members clad in coats of many hues, just like Joseph, the papa of Jesus Christ.

{"prompt": "Ten Years Ago Too\n", "completion": " Another item that appeared on Hooting Yard ten years ago today was this:\nColossal, crude, terrible and sublime, Brann opened the ears of the people by the mighty power of his untamed language, by the smashing fury of his wrath of words... Waste, futile and planless, mere howling, empty, chaotic waste, for no purpose under heaven but to serve as food for idle fancies as to what might have been--such to me is the death of Brann, and my throat chokes with sorrow and my soul is sick with vain despair.\nThat is a quotation from Milo Hastings' preface to Brann The Iconoclast, a collection of pieces by William Cowper Brann (1855--1898). You can read the whole thing here, or you might prefer, as I do, to repair to a deserted windswept promontory and shout those colossal, crude, terrible and sublime words at the sky, and watch birds drop down dead.\n\n###"}

The witch's countenance became twisted with hate and she cried \"I'm his childhood sweetheart, Captivity Waite! He abandoned me, the cur, the dog, yet my name is immortalised in his autobiog, Love Affairs Of A Bibliomaniac\", and then, maddened, she started to whack Dave Dee and Dozy and Beaky and Mick and Tich with brick after brick after brick until in the wood in the dead of the night the soul of each pop star took heavenward flight.

{"prompt": "The Manufacture Of Tinplate\n", "completion": " George Eliot said that a happy home life was a necessity for her to write. It seems the same was true for Dobson, who churned out all those innumerable out of print pamphlets while living in domestic bliss with Marigold Chew. But was happiness indeed the spur for his indefatigable pamphleteering? Quite the opposite was the case with Emanuel Swedenborg, as we learn from Eric John Dingwall. In Very Peculiar People : Portrait Studies In The Queer, The Abnormal And The Uncanny (1950) Mr Dingwall has a paragraph which ends superbly:\n\"As the years went by Swedenborg became more energetic than ever. His passion for women still tormented him, for, since the rejection of his suit by the young Emerentia Polhem about 1717, he apparently contracted no other alliance. There is no doubt that his failure to win her hand had affected him deeply, but he quickly steeled himself against allowing emotion to upset his work. He promptly published a pamphlet on the manufacture of tinplate.\"\nWhat this might indicate about the home life of our own dear Dobson is worthy of speculation.\n###"}

Alas, I have never read Misery Junction by Richard Henry, and I find myself wondering if the story is set in one of the notorious junctions and sidings of the Hooting Yard to O'Houlihan's Wharf Branch Line. There, Misery Junction is the foul rainswept junction between two other junctions, one called Moral Squalor Junction and the other known as Pretty Little Dandelion Junction. It should be noted that the pretty little dandelions growing so profusely around the railway lines at that spot were contaminated with some kind of toxin, and the pretty little ponies which cantered up to them for a lunchtime chew were swiftly carted off to the knackers yard, stone dead.\n* NOTE : Pansy quite rightly points out that I have confused a series of 19th century paperbacks (Yellowbacks) with a type of wasp (Yellowjacket).

It was devised by his cousin. He had dozens of cousins, and the name of the airbag designer was Ulf Drib, which is an anagram of bird flu. Ulf was a fat fellow who looked as if several of his airbags had exploded within him. In May 1968 he threw a pebble at a policeman in Paris. Youthful folly! Now he was fat and comfortable and bourgeois and able to manipulate air in wondrous ways.\nIt was good thing he did, for Hot Zinc was a terrible driver.

{"prompt": "A Couple Of Germans\n", "completion": " From Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 2, Number 12, May 1851\n\"Physico-Physiological Researches on the Dynamics of Magnetism, &c., by Baron CHARLES VON REICHENBACH, translated from the German, by JOHN ASHBURNER, M.D., is a scientific treatise, showing the relations of magnetism, electricity, heat, light, crystallization, and chemism to the vital forces of the human body. It is founded on an extensive series of experiments, which tend to bring the mysterious phenomena of Mesmerism within the domain of physics, and in fact to reduce the whole subject of physiology to a department of chemical science... The investigations, of which the results are here described, are of a singularly curious character, exhibiting the most astonishing developments, with a philosophical calmness that is rare even among German savants.\"\n\"In the album presented to the King of Bavaria by the artists of Munich, is an admirable composition by Hubner. It is an expression of the feelings of a large portion of Upper Germany. It represents a female prostrate upon the ground, with the arms crossed, the face entirely hidden, in an attitude of the deepest despair. The long hair floats over the arms, and trails along the ground. The whole figure is a mixture of majesty and utter abandonment. The simple title of the piece is--Germania, 1850.\"\n###"}

Shiel above, was also the title of one of Dobson's more readable works, and the only one to find a publisher in his lifetime. (All those pamphlets of his were, of course, cranked out on Marigold Chew's dilapidated printing press.) During the early 1950s, after spending some time as a pin-the-paper-to-the-cardboard instructor at the Pang Hill Orphanage, Dobson became interested for the first time in writing pedagogic works for urchins. The early attempts were not a success. In a burst of ludicrous enthusiasm, he produced a series of ten \"Tracts For Tinies\" (including the now justly-admired Hideous Execution Practices Of The Blood-Drenched Corsairs, Ten Easy Steps To Grooming Your Cormorant, and My Nightmares About Emily Dickinson), but sales were few, and most of the copies ended up being used as hot air balloon ballast. Late in 1958, however, a janitor who worked for Ladybird Books picked up a copy of A Brief & Bewildering History Of Helsinki in a charity shop, read it with glee, and showed it to one of the firm's editors, who immediately tracked down the elusive pamphleteer. Commissioned to write a book for the Junior Science series, and given carte blanche regarding his subject-matter, Dobson scribbled down this tremendous text in just three hours. Sadly, it is now out of print.\n\n###"}

On the other hand, they might be beatniks, and it's Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk who's behind the times, daddy-o.\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "Two Tinies\n", "completion": " Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, Always keen to keep abreast of the latest happenstances in popular culture, last evening I sat me down with a mug of cocoa and a bag of filberts to watch the Mercury Music Prize awards. I was saddened to see that young pop person Tinie Tempah, who was shortlisted, failed to win. Anyway, as I dabbed away my tears, it occurred to me to ask you if Master Tempah is in any way related to that other excellent tiny, Tiny Enid. Please enlighten me.\nDear Tim, In this bewildering world it is critical that we can distinguish one tiny from another. Actually, that isn't strictly true, now I come to think of it. What matters is that we can tell Tiny Enid apart from all other extant tinies.\nTiny Enid is a heroic clubfooted infant, usually dressed in a polka dot frock, much given to brave, even reckless, deeds of derring-do, and of pronounced Fascist sympathies.\nI am not entirely sure who Tinie Tempah is, but I suspect he may be some kind of homunculus, possibly malevolent.\nI hope this clears the matter up to your satisfaction.\n###"}

And England's rivers--with those in Scotland and Wales--have ancient names, often conferred before the Roman legions came, and passed down almost unchanged to the present. Daily Mail spread on the misery that will last all summer featured the Bewl, the Chess and the Pang. But these are just the start. What about the Mease, the Tees, the Dee, the Cree, the Nar, the Ter and the Ver? Or the Box, the Yox and the Axe? Or the Neet, the Fleet and the Smite? Do not forget, either, the Ebble, the Piddle, the Polly, the Nadder or the Wandle. Or the Feshie, the Mashie and the Wissey. Then there are the Lugg, the Ugie, the Meggat, the Tud, the Lud and the Irt. Like these other rivers, the Wampool, the Snizort, the Skirfare, the Deveron, the Cocker and the Stinchar speak of a deep Britain, to which we are more connected than we realise.

Incidentally, not long before his death, the spookily tall and almost blind Huxley answered the doorbell of his California home to a young vacuum cleaner salesman named Don Van Vliet, soon to be better known as Captain Beefheart. It would be fitting if I could end this squib with the observation that Van Vliet, too, was the child of a dentist, but his Pa was a van driver for a bakery, toting pastry-related items hither and yon, and I have no idea of his Ma's occupation, alas.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Among The Goats\n", "completion": " Once there were two of us little goatherds in the wood, and were talking of various childish things: amongst others we wished that we could fly, for then we would fly out of the mountain to Germany (for so Switzerland was called in St. Gall). On a sudden came a frightfully large bird darting down upon us, so that we thought it was going to carry one or both of us away. At this we both began to scream, and to defend ourselves with our shepherd's crooks, and to cross ourselves, till the bird flew away; then we said to one another, \"We have done wrong in wishing to be able to fly; God did not create us for flying, but for walking.\" Another time I was in a very deep fissure looking for crystals, of which many were found in it. All at once I saw a stone as large as an oven starting from the side, and as I had no time to get out of the way, I stooped down upon my face. The stone fell several fathoms down to a spot above me, and from thence it made a spring away over me, so that I escaped with a whole skin. I had plenty of such joys and happiness on the mountains among the goats, of which I now remember nothing more.\nfrom The Autobiography Of Thomas Platter, A Schoolmaster Of The Sixteenth Century, Translated From The German By Mrs Finn (1847)\n###"}

My footnote is appended.\nIt began with a telephone call just before midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took down the receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying under great difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid bubbling noise--\"glub... glub... glub\"--which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called \"Who is it?\" But the only answer was \"glub... glub... glub-glub.\"\nNOTE : In the early 1990s, \"Glub ... glub ... glub\" was the recorded answerphone message of Ed Baxter, benevolent despot of ResonanceFM.\n###"}

For example, I do not own--nor covet--a mobile phone, and would much rather curl up with a copy of Jubilate Agno by Christopher Smart than go shopping for fripperies. But of course, such pretence is delusional. I am as eager as anyone else to get my hands on stuff, depending on the stuff.

{"prompt": "A Cinema Goat\n", "completion": " Today, for reasons I shall not bore you with, my attention is drawn to the 2005 Hungarian film Fekete kefe, directed by Roland Vranik. This synopsis could scarcely fail to entice any devoted Hooting Yardist:\nFour fake chimney sweeps prowl on rooftops, in pubs & flats of Budapest and in the stomach of a goat. Love, history, friendship and religion pull each other's weights but in the end there is absolutely no solution. Zoli, DAPfi, Papi and Anti goes to the rooftops one morning to sweep the chimneys but they are meeting a strange housing-estate-goat so they are getting totally confused and everything goes chaos. After their hard day they find the key to escape in the stomach of the goat...\nIt's shot in black & white, too. I may have to write about a quartet of fake chimney sweeps and a \"strange housing estate goat\", and should probably do so before seeing what I have already convinced myself is a masterwork of cinema.\n###"}

Doctor Johnson's common sense comprises the vulgarest of commonplaces: expressed with the bizarre violence that Boswell has the art to depict, it has a quality unique in this world. Only this ponderous catalogue resembles the doctor's dictionary; from it one could extract a Scientia Johnsoniana with an index. Boswell has not had the aesthetic courage to select.\n(Translation by Iain White.)\nI was delighted to note, elsewhere in the introduction, that Schwob makes mention of \"the conjectures to which Boswell abandons us concerning the use Johnson made of the dried orange-peel he liked to keep in his pockets\"--as noted recently here.\nNB : Hooting Yard's in-house anagrammatist R. will, I hope, get to work on the title of this postage.\n###"}

One of Marr's more amusing beliefs was that all words derive ultimately from the root sounds rosh, sal, ber and yon. (\"Linguisticians who held otherwise\", Amis tells us, \"were jailed or shot.\")\nDobson came across Marr's work at some point, and as a result produced what must be, by any measure, his most preposterous essay. In The FA Cup Final Of 1962 As It Might Have Been Reported By One Of Our Troglodyte Ancestors, the out of print pamphleteer \"channels\" the caveman mindset, as he sees it, and constructs a forty-four page text of blithering inanity.

Yon sal rosh ber sal ber yon sal yon ber rosh rosh ber ber ber ber ber ber rosh yon. Sal.\nAnd so it goes on.

{"prompt": "Dabbling A La Bruce\n", "completion": " \nEarlier this week in The Dabbler, Brit reviewed Sweeper!, a novel by the foopballist Steve Bruce. Though I have yet to read the book itself, the review was enough for me to recognise genius. I added a comment, saying: \"OK, that's it.

It's early doors, and I can't pretend to have mastered the intricacies of the Brucesque method, but I am trying, I am trying.\nIncidentally, astute readers will note a particularly clever metafictional sally in my piece. Brit points to Bruce's repeated use of fundamental spelling inconsistencies in proper names, and is dismissive of the idea that these may be due to a lack of proofreading or copy editing. I have followed Bruce in giving my hero's name in a number of variations, and I also refer more than once to the actor Bruce Willis. Not only is there a pleasing Bruce / Bruce echo, but of course Willis once reputedly wrote on an online forum the immortal words \"proofreading is for pussies\".

{"prompt": "The Curious Appeal Of Deal\n", "completion": " What, when there are places on the map called Upper Dicker, Lower Dicker, or Wyre Piddle, was the particular appeal of Deal (pop. 28,504), one wonders, for the nation's reprobates and misanthropes? The drunken polymorphously perverse bankrupt novelist and cashiered King's Own Shropshire Light Infantryman Simon Raven (1927-2001), for example, was banished to a nursing home for handicapped old ladies in the town for thirty-four years, sallying forth every now and again to a massage parlour opposite the Reform Club, Pall Mall, for 'a good housemaid's wank'. One is compelled to picture the streets of Deal as a world in decay thronged with George Grosz characters got up in askew velvet hats and musquash coats seeking eyeglass-fogging diversions. 'I always used to see [Charles] Hawtrey being pulled out of pubs,' Raven recalled the week before he died, 'But what's wrong with that? We all like a drink, don't we dear?' Deal is the capital of non-conformity.\nA footnote by Roger Lewis in his biography Charles Hawtrey : The Man Who Was Private Widdle (2001). Another Deal resident, in his final years, was Rayner Heppenstall (1911-1981), whose posthumously published novel The Pier is a murderous fantasy in which the Heppenstall-like narrator systematically plans and commits the slaughter of his (working class) next door neighbours.\n\n###"}

No one, however, can cavil at our decision to draw attention to an event that occurred in London two hundred and sixty four years ago today. Indeed, its contemporary relevance is uncanny. On 17th March 1740, Henry Fielding--author and magistrate--using the splendid pseudonym Captain Hercules Vinegar, issued a court summons against the Poet Laureate, Colley Cibber, accusing him of the wilful murder of the English language.\nIs there in 21st century London an officer of the law with the wit to follow Captain Vinegar's example? I have had stern words to say about the present Poet Laureate before (see 18th December). But Lemsip-slurping Andrew Motion has now surpassed even his own previous doggerel with A Song For Jonny. Read it and weep.\nNow dry your eyes, for Pansy Cradledew has a theory. \"Could it be,\" she asks, \"that Motion is brilliantly undermining the anachronistic, monarchist post of laureate by writing deliberately atrocious twaddle? Consider the evidence. You referred in December to his poem about a \"dapper hall\" and a \"ball\". In this latest poem we find more balls. Read the last line of the new one carefully.

The Hoon Head Honcho of Hunted Wolves was there to greet us. \"I will have that wolf,\" he said, \"It is not yours to keep. Here in Hoon we keep all hunted wolves, including those that have been impaled by a harpoon shot from a hot air balloon.\" But we wanted to keep our harpooned wolf, as a rug for the basket of our balloon, so I pulled the harpoon out of the wolf and pointed it at the man from Hoon. \"We shall keep our wolf. If you try to take it you will feel the point of this harpoon upon your neck,\" I said. We did not know that the man from Hoon was a Wolfman. His head changed shape, and then the rest of him, and with his savage claws he tore the silken fabric of our balloon.

The shape of the limbs was clearly traceable, and two little brown tentacles of arms with rudimentary hands lay, one by the side and the other half over the breast. Bits of the earth from which it had been torn still clung in the indentations of the shape, and on the top of the head, mingling with the tufts of hair, were the shrivelled remains of a stalk which had been removed or had mouldered away.

He wrote:\nWhat never seems to occur to people is that there is not one single recorded instance of any dog being called Fido prior to World War II*. This stark fact alone is surely all the evidence any rational person needs to realise that dogs are named Fido in honour of the Petroleum Warfare Department's successful development of the \"fog, intensive dispersal of\" system, otherwise known as FIDO. I cannot be bothered to go into the details of how, in 1944, boffins managed to make mist and fog vanish, for all the world like mediaeval magicians, but they did, God knows they did.

The dirty habits and gross feeding of the early natives of Britain, as well as of all other uncivilized people, rendered this malady common; but at the time in which Prince Bladud lived, no cure for it was known to the Britons.

You can then describe yourself as a willow warbler, perhaps when, at a sophisticated cocktail party, leaning insouciantly against a mantelpiece, you are approached by a fellow guest who asks you what you do. \"I am a willow warbler\", you can say, truthfully.\nAmong the various definitions given for warble in the OED, the one I find particularly helpful is \"To twitter, as a young bird; to make uncertain attempts at singing\". This is my kind of warbling, because, frankly, I cannot sing for toffee. But there is nothing to stop me making \"uncertain attempts\" at singing, in the midst of a clump of willows, whenever the mood takes me. And take me it often does!, to the point of mania.\nI have a varied repertoire of songs which I warble--or sing uncertainly--on my willowy jaunts. Land Of Ladies by the Brothers Johnson, Vienna by Ultravox, Boom Bang-A-Bang by Lulu, and Nunc dimittis servum tuum by The Toofles are among my favourites. I struggle with the words--and tunes--of all of them, but that is par for the course with warbling. Occasionally I am shot at by farmers.\n\n###"}

This led some neighbours on our council estate to surmise that my Pa was a Soviet spy. The fact that he regularly popped in to the newsagent's to pick up a copy of the Morning Star probably added to their suspicions. Unfortunately I don't have a photograph, doctored or otherwise, of my father in his Communist headgear.\n\nOne of the amusing things about all the nitwit fans losing their marbles over supposed BBC perfidy is that there must be thousands of photographs of Corbyn wearing self-styled \"revolutionary\" attire.

{"prompt": "Name That Pond!\n", "completion": " Every so often I get a metal tapping machine message from an overexcited television person pleading with me to devise a game show based on some aspect of Hooting Yard. These people are invariably young and stupid, and I try hard not to be a git as I refuse their offers of ruinous wealth and a peaktime viewing audience of millions.\nBut I must admit that I was tempted by the latest whizzkid's \"concept\", which was to turn The Names Of The Ponds into a thirteen-part series. The idea was that each week, a couple of contestants (Brian from Swanage and Carol from Jaywick) would stare at a photograph of a pond for fifteen minutes, then, after the advert break, use their skill, judgment, and cherished religious beliefs to work out which pond they'd been looking at. Stephen Fry would be on hand to help them, because he's so clever.\nIt's a quandary, but in the end I think I will have to get back to the teenage television person and say No, No, No. But that's no reason why you, my loyal readers, should be deprived of the wholesome family entertainment such a game provides.

Tragically, his fate was sealed when he came down in that airfield.

He landed in the airfield and walked up the tor, in his goggles he passed through the canteen door. He told them his tales of venturesome flights, until the poisonous breakfast put out his lights.

Then, it is a \"Society\", a fraternity or sorority one supposes, an esoteric band of adepts, sworn together by bonds of ritual secrecy. And on what purpose are they bent, these shadowy yet somehow noble figures? Nothing less than the \"Prevention of Accidents\"! If one thinks of an accident as an Act of God, which must surely be a common definition, then here we have a group dedicated to averting or undoing the whims of the Almighty. Whether that is heroic or abominable, it is incontrovertibly blasphemous.

Truman Capote said of Kerouac's On The Road that \"it's not writing, it's typing\", and one feels that were Mr C still with us, he would make the same waspish remark about the torrent of verbiage spewed across these pages. It is difficult to know what to make of a work that steadfastly refuses to engage the reader in any way. At times it reads like an ironmongery catalogue for upwards of a hundred pages, then without warning the poet launches into his own (incompetent) Tagalog translation of the Book of Isaiah.

Published when he was still wet behind the ears, it was his first bestselling paperback. The fact that he was completely unknown to the world when he wrote it, and had lived so short and uneventful a life up to that point, makes its astounding success all the more bewildering. The prose is callow, clunky, and at times incoherent, the narrative devoid of incident save for the famous hydroelectric power station picnic explosion disaster and its aftermath, to which an entire, lengthy chapter is devoted. Yet the presses kept rolling as more and more copies had to be printed to satisfy the public's seemingly hysterical demand. One observer calculated that more copies were sold than there are stars in the heavens. That being so, one might think it would be an easy title to track down, in shops such as Old Pa Dustcake's, even so many years after publication. But one hardly ever sees a copy for sale. One explanation, which I find quite convincing, is that a flaw in the binding caused the majority of the books to fall apart when touched by human skin.

The following email arrived the other day:\nDear Mr Key : I was disturbed to note, in your item headed Petrochemical Shiver-Me-Timbers Conclave (20th December 2004), that you unthinkingly preceded the word corsair with bloodthirsty. This is not only a cliche, but also panders to the stereotype of corsairs as violent maniacs who careen around the decks of sailing ships off the Barbary Coast with gleaming cutlasses clenched between their equally gleaming teeth. I have met many corsairs in my time, and not one of them bears any resemblance to this nonsensical image. Indeed, the corsair with whom I was best acquainted, in that he was my fiance for a few months in the early 1970s, was a gentle soul named Federico Dellapiccola de Grunwald, who spoke with a pronounced lisp and whose usual form of locomotion, when he wasn't prancing, was to mince. I do not think he had ever been near a cutlass in his life. Much of his time, whenever he was absent from his buccaneering privateer ship, was spent raising rhododendrons and dahlias, holding raffles in aid of the local orphanage, and gambolling o'er green fields with puppies and flopsy-tailed bunny rabbits. Next time you write about corsairs, please be more accurate. Yours fuming, Ruth Pastry.\n###"}

I am thinking, for example, of a recent dream, in the course of which I attended a party at a retirement home for outrageous old thespians of the Donald Sinden stripe. One of these ageing hams was swaddled from head to foot in cloth of the deepest crimson, bemoaning that he had devoted his life to interpreting a minor character in a minor work by a minor dramatist. We then gathered for a screening of In Search Of The Most Pious Man : A Life Of Jesus, a film directed by Carrington Holmes.\nI have tried, in my waking hours, to discover more about the dream film and the dream film director, to no avail.

The idea is to induce in oneself a state of mind where the only \"writing\" which exists is the tracks of birds in snow--marks that are at once meaningless yet numinous. In this state, \"literature\" has yet to come into being. Prose has to be invented anew. It is as if one were Jeanette Winterson!\nTo get the hang of the momentous task before you, it is a good idea to make a copy of the bird-tracks in the snow, for they are fugitive, and when the snow melts, they will vanish forever. Go to a stationery shop or a post office, and buy a pen and paper. When choosing a pen, say of the ballpoint variety, make sure the tip is about the size of the primitive ganglia which constitute the brain of a lobster.\nOut in the field, learn how to make marks, with the pen upon the paper, which match precisely the patterns made by the tracks of birds in the snow. This is the beginning of writing! Back at home, sat at an escritoire, continue making such marks, but rather than mere copying allow yourself free rein. Sooner or later, you will discover that the marks you are making will, as if by a miracle, form literate prose!\n###"}

He would simply tear the nest from his tresses and punch his fist at the hummingbird or wren so that it flew away. But the fop of whom I write was no hater of birds. His love of our winged chums was so great that he was known to some as The Bird-Adoring Fop. Perhaps the hummingbird or wren had, with some avian sixth sense, apprehended this bird-love and chosen the site of its nest accordingly. Or it may have been simply the luxury of the fop's locks, espied from high up in the sky as he reclined languidly on a chaise in a salon, fluttering a perfumed kerchief and sipping some delightful infusion from a bone china cup.

Then he plodded his way in his wellington boots to the pig farmer's hut down the lane, and he felled the brute with a thwack of his fist and bound him up with a chain. Agent Blot dragged the pig farmer off to the prison, bang in the centre of town. And that is why, on November the fifth, the distressed pig did not drown.\n###"}
{"prompt": "The Assassination Of Hilary Mantel\n", "completion": " The Guardian today published a short story by Hilary Mantel entitled The Assassination Of Margaret Thatcher. This piece apparently took Ms Mantel thirty years to write, for \"technical reasons\"--\"I just couldn't see how to get [the characters] to work together\". The inference is that she has at last solved the problem, but it seems to me that the characters--an assassin and the woman whose flat he uses to set up his sniper's nest--neither work together nor individually.\nI have always found Mantel a curiously lifeless writer. The popularity of her prize-winning Thomas Cromwell books is a profound mystery, and Beyond Black was spectacularly turgid. In the present story she makes full use of her gift for clunking, tin-eared dialogue.\nMost amusing is the revelation that the original title of the forthcoming collection of stories for which The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher acts as a trailer was Ten Transgressive Tales. Ooh! Transgressive! What could be less transgressive than an infantile fantasy about murdering a Tory prime minister published in the pages of the Guardian?\nFor the next thirty years I intend to work on a story entitled The Assassination of Hilary Mantel. The technical challenge, to drain all life from my prose, will be huge, but hey!, think how transgressive and shocking it will be.\nNOTA BENE : For something genuinely transgressive, see my forthcoming book Tony Benn Was A Complete Wanker.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dabbling With Suzanne\n", "completion": " \nThis week in The Dabbler I pioneer a new form of close textual analysis of classic songs, starting with \"Suzanne\" by Leonard Cohen. And when I say \"close\", I mean close--in my attempt to winkle out the deep meaning of the song I concentrate on a single six-word phrase, jettisoning the rest of it. And when I say \"winkle\", well, as you will discover when you pore over my piece, winkles and other hardy organic life-forms of the tide pool have a crucial part to play in the heretofore hidden deep structure of the song.\nOne unexpected advantage of my brain-numbing work was the realisation that there is a connection, albeit tentative and tangential, with my concurrent lobster research. I make no great claims for what we might call \"the Suzanne lobster\", but it suffices, I think, that the word \"lobsters\" appears, not at all gratuitously, in my analysis.\nThese are hideously complicated matters, but I hope I have been able to shed some little light on them.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Bodice-ripper\n", "completion": " His name was Ned and he was a cad and a rascal. Given half a chance, he would rip a bodice while flashing his wolfish teeth. Ned had not got the hang of correct bodice-ripping, however, for he failed to understand that the bodices he ripped were meant to have fey damsels inside them. Ned simply headed for the nearest bodice warehouse, jemmied the lock, and, once inside, ripped all the bodices stored there by whichever needleworkers had made them. This made Ned hugely unpopular with the bodice-makers, and they ran him out of town.\nSo Ned found himself sat on a stone in the middle of a field, all rustic and rural. Here there seemed little opportunity for him to be caddish or rascally. There was not a bodice in sight, only some cows and a few hens and a pigsty down the way. Ned was disconsolate.\nWhat he needed was a picaresque adventure. But such rollicking antics were not to be found in Tantarabim in days of yore, so Ned shredded cabbage instead. Whether or not you are fond of coleslaw, you have Ned to thank for its presence on your plate, or in your bowl, next to the cold mashed potatoes and the jumbo size sausages, as you sit in the canteen of your 26th century spaceship hurtling towards the weirdly crumpled planet where your destiny awaits.\n###"}

There are blue bumps, and bumps of a faded greenish hue, and bumps red and inflamed, and his bald sconce looks as though it had been out in a rain of spent bullets. It is not so, however; it has only been exposed to a downpour of raw potatoes.\nRead more about this magnificent potato man at The Cat's Meat Shop.\n###"}

I suggested at the time that a reading of this would make a splendid special edition of Hooting Yard On The Air, and lo! it has come to pass.

In his secret underground laboratory, the experimentalist Dr Fang has set up a \"wasp chamber\", to which he lures any wasps he comes upon on his perambulations around the perimeter fence of his compound. Once the wasp is trapped within the chamber, Dr Fang goes to work with what he terms his \"wasp behaviour modification techniques\". These are, of course, never to be divulged to anybody outside the secret underground laboratory, so I cannot tell you much about them. By bribing several of Dr Fang's hunchbacked troglodyte albino assistants, however, I have learned that the techniques involve a serum, a ray gun, spooky buzzing music composed by an argumentative German, icing sugar, tweezers, and mesmerism. Please note this is not an exhaustive list, so do not try to experiment on a wasp yourself.\nDr Fang remains tight-lipped regarding the cuddliness, or otherwise, of his wasp chamber alumnae, which are released into the wild when he has finished with them.

{"prompt": "The Village Wrestler\n", "completion": " At midday, greased and pungent, the village wrestler took up his position by the war memorial. With his aggressive stance and tiny brain, he challenged everyone passing by to a wrestling bout. But not one among the villagers was fool enough to fight him and so, in his frustration, he would fling himself upon a dog or a chicken or a defenceless toddler straying from its mother's apron-strings, and wrestle them to the ground and pin them there, counting to ten in awful grunts, and then stand up, arms raised aloft in victory.\nHe was the undefeated champ when, eventually, the sheriff shot into him a dart tipped with a powerful horse tranquilliser, and he keeled over, bashing his head on the war memorial. He lay there unconscious for days. The villagers debated what to do with him when he awoke. Chains and cages were suggested, as was electro-convulsive therapy. But then, when he did awake, the village wrestler was placid, all aggression spent. He took a chicken and a flask of water drawn from the village trough, and he wandered off along the lane that led to the aerodrome. We never saw him again.\n###"}

He was not a stinky person himself. Indeed, he bathed much more often than was usual in that time, in that land, and he also doused himself in rich and heady perfumes, brought to him from mysterious distant lands by itinerant perfumiers. So offended were some of these travellers by the hideous stench wafting through the castle that they could not bring themselves to cross the drawbridge. The baron would have to come out of his castle and meet them in a field to take possession of their latest scents and tinctures. He felt this was beneath his dignity, to have to come and haggle in a field like a peasant, but on the other hand it was quite a treat to be out in the fresh air for half an hour.\nThe baron had tried everything to rid the smelly castle of its pong. He had the drains inspected. He scattered pot pourris hither and thither. He even called in a fumigation expert, or at least a man who announced himself as one. But all to no avail.

[From 25 April to 9 May Diary is written in Eileen's hand.]\nNow, we are used to one egg or two eggs, and very rarely three eggs, but fourteen? Can it be mere accident that this anomalous number of eggs is counted on the very day that Eileen has commandeered the writing of the diary? Has George been lying? Is it conceivable that all along the daily egg count has been higher than he has reported, and that he has been hiding the undeclared eggs from Eileen? One pictures Orwell sneaking off to the eggery while Eileen is out on an errand, making himself a secret omelette, perhaps, or hardboiling a clutch to carry in his pockets and give as gifts to any orphans and distressed widows he meets on his roamings. Or, conversely, is Eileen pretending to a larger egg count than is true, for her own purposes, which we can only guess at?\nWe shall have to see how many eggs are reported between now and the ninth of May, when Eileen gives George his pen back.\n###"}

The group slap bang next to the crate is peering past it, at something else, we know not what. Others are seen walking past, as if oblivious. In the foreground, however, we see a diminutive figure, possibly a curious infant, who seems to want to move towards the crate but is being bustled away by its guardian or governess, dressed in hood and cape.\nCan it be that the tiny one, alone of those in the hangar, knew what the crate contained, was attracted to it by invisible forces the nature of which must remain to us as mysterious as the crate itself?

{"prompt": "Tint When Tiny\n", "completion": " \nThis picture shows the mezzotintist Rex Tint, as a child, painting a portrait of his sister Dot Tint, chronicler of vampiric sea shanties and much else besides. Rex had great pretensions, in his curdled youth, to becoming a painter of note, rather than a mezzotintist, and he executed innumerable daubs, of which the portrait of Dot is but one. Several art critics have tugged at their beards and fiddled with their hornrimmed spectacles as they struggle to understand why Rex Tint abandoned paint and set out on the path to mezzotinty glory. Now the tale can be told. Well, not \"can be\" but \"has been\", in Pebblehead's latest bestselling paperback How The Secret Police Confiscated Rex Tint's Paintbox And How He Sobbed And Whimpered Until A Kindly Butcher's Shop Assistant Gave Him A Secondhand Mezzotinting Kit. Annoyingly, the prize-winning paperbackist does not tell us the reason why the secret police targeted the tiny painter. Had he perhaps daubed a less than flattering portrait of Prince Fulgencio? Or, on one of his plein air excursions, had he unwittingly painted a top secret experimental brain-incapacitating nerve gas facility? It really would help if Pebblehead could do some proper research for a change, but I expect he is too busy bashing out his next bestseller on that antique typewriter of his, looking up occasionally at the picture of Anthony Burgess drawingpinned to his cork board and pretending it is a mirror.\n\n###"}

Charles Baudelaire, the Poe of French literature, in his tribute to the dead poet, indignantly wrote: \"What is the matter with America? Are there, then, no regulations there to keep the curs out of the cemeteries?\" In view of the fact that the Griswold biography of Poe has been incontestably discredited, and proved to be merely a scaffolding of malevolent falsehoods--the outcome of malice and mendacity--the deference paid to Griswold and his baleful work in the memoir accompanying the latest publication of Poe's writings seems well-nigh incomprehensible.\"\n###"}

I have to say I am extremely impressed that the National Lobster Hatchery, which offers this splendid opportunity, insists that the first stage of the process is to Name Your Lobster. Thus is the act of naming given its proper, paramount importance.\nThese conscientious lobsterists at the Hatchery have gone to the trouble of listing all their thousands of adopted lobsters, at the point where they are released into the wild, and so will your adopted lobster appear on the website when its turn comes. Note my assumption that you will be adopting a lobster as soon as you have finished reading this. Do not let me down.\nWhile I do not wish to dictate in so important a matter as lobster nomenclature, I cannot help thinking that it would be a fine thing indeed if the waters around Padstow were to have clacking about in them lobsters named after your favourite Hooting Yard characters, such as Dobson, Tiny Enid, Old Halob, Dennis Beerpint, Little Severin The Mystic (Badger) Lobster, and the rest.

A typical selection could read: a pin-cushion (innocent of pins); a small AA battery (dead); and twelve postage stamps from the Plunkett collection (non-adhesive).\nA further three cards, from the second pack, are then chosen. These will give further crucial information about each player's entrapment, to wit, for example: your left leg is broken in three places; you have been blind since birth; and a starling has built its nest in your tremendous bouffant.\nPlayers are each given forty five seconds to describe their method of escape, which must be plausible, vivid, logically watertight, and lead to the apprehension of the psychopath by doughty Inspector Calloway and his lame bloodhound, Tim.\n###"}

For example, the Orghast for \"darkness opens its womb\" (\"staple of any phrasebook\" as a cynic writes) is BULLORGA OMBOLOM FROR.\nI would like to learn and become fluent in Orghast. Apparently it has a vocabulary of some two thousand words, but of these only about fifty count as \"real Orghast\", according to Ted Hughes, and he should know.

{"prompt": "The Four Soups\n", "completion": " \nIn a comment on yesterday's postage about Nixonian soup hatred, Salim Fadhley asks the intriguing question if the serving of shark's fin soup at a dinner on the President's state visit to China in 1972 prompted one of his \"six crises\". We shall overlook the fact that Nixon published his book of that title ten years earlier, in 1962, and we shall also overlook the fact that Mr Fadhley's question is easily answered, either by reading the book itself or, if the prospect of hundreds of pages of Nixonian prose does not appeal, a summary of its contents which can be found on the wikipedia. We will soon learn that the shark's fin soup did not pose a crisis for Nixon, or at least not one of the six he wrote about.\nBut that is so disappointing, is it not? I would prefer to think that there is another book by Nixon, entitled perhaps Soup Crises, in which the thirty-seventh Potus describes in dramatic and unflinching detail the various soup crises he had to face. If, in the course of his life, there were only four soup crises, then an alternative title for the book could be The Four Soups. Happily, this is an anagram of House Of Turps, an out of print pamphlet by Mr Key. Could it be that I was anagrammatically channelling Nixon in 1989?

{"prompt": "Goddess Clarification\n", "completion": " Most, if not all, Hooting Yard readers will today be paying special attention to door handles and hinges, in honour of the Roman goddess Cardea. Well stop right there! You can safely treat your doorway accoutrements with the same admixture of disdain and neglect with which you regard them during the rest of the year.\nI cannot stress too energetically the importance of not getting your Roman goddesses all mixed up. Cardea was a nymph who also went by the name Carna. Janus was besotted with her, and as some kind of love-token, I suppose, gifted her with power over the aforesaid door handles and hinges. The Carna whose feast day it is today was another goddess entirely, who presided over the heart and other organs (hence carnal), and there is no record of her paying the slightest attention to doors, handles, hinges, or any other fixtures and fittings.\nTo make things absolutely clear, here is a picture of Cardea/Carna, together with a modern, 21st century Cardea, who is a robot designed to open doors by turning the handle and pushing. If any befuddlement remains in readers' minds about the two Carnas and the two Cardeas, drop me a line and I will try to dig out a photostat of Dobson's out-of-print pamphlet which goes into this topic in such excruciating detail that you will wish you had never asked.\n\nLeft : Cardea.

{"prompt": "The Game Of Glossop\n", "completion": " Here is an outdoor game for all the family. After singing lustily at the Sunday service, and having a little chat with the vicar on the church steps, you should repair to a patch of waste ground, taking with you a couple of battered iron pails, an unopened packet of processed cheese triangles, and some strips of bark from a pugton tree. Each family member should don a red balaclava, apart from the tiniest one, who goes bare-headed. One side of the patch of waste ground is designated Nobby Stiles. The opposite side is consecrated to David Blunkett. The object of the game is to get from Stiles to Blunkett as directly as possible, cleanly and without undue dithering. If the patch of waste ground is assailed by inclement weather, for instance a howling gale, a teeming downpour, or thunder and lightning, the family may be accompanied by beetle-browed urchins from beyond the railway tracks. Use counters and a tally stick to keep score.\n\n###"}

I shall have further words to say about those who sow confusion in the field of Tiny Enid life studies shortly, and they will be stern words, sulphurous ones, declaimed from a platform, a platform I hope to erect in Planken itself, or failing that, in Schaan or Balzers. The platform will be made from expensive wood, as you would expect, but the carpenters will be cheap, if I do my homework, which involves consulting a directory of Liechtensteinian carpenters and other woodworkers and ranking them according to price. Such an activity can becalm the most anguished of souls.\n###"}

The later, shorter, fictions lack the comic energy that makes Watt a bonkers masterpiece sui generis.

Perhaps it was purveyor of \"performance cattle that calve on the range and graze through the winter\" Kirk Dickinson himself. Astonishingly, what went on in his head was something like this:\n\"Hmm, this is a fine cow. I think I'll name it after an eighties pop group given to portentous witterings, remembered today for that matchless paean to vapidity Vienna, it means nothing to me. No doubt the minstrel Midge Ure will be pleased to know he has a cow named after his old band. The cow's name shall be Ultravox!\"\nThanks to Alasdair Dickson for drawing my attention to this.

The message will be shouted in a transparently robust manner, from behind a transparent screen, made of robust glass. It's a big ask, but I think it's important to begin the conversation. One benefit of such robust transparency is that we might, as a result, be invited into the government's big tent of all the talents. Asked to predict the likelihood of this, our resident prognosticator Little Severin The Mystic Badger scrabbled around in a pile of twigs and muck and came to no definite conclusion.

And if it does, I would be interested to know if it is possible to pursue, beyond the grave, any bishop who, before his last gasp, broke the law by not so bequeathing his pack of dogs.

{"prompt": "Was Dobson Stalin?\n", "completion": " This is the intriguing thesis propounded by Aloysius Nestingbird in his new book, entitled Was Dobson Stalin? : Laying Bare The Greatest Secret Of Twentieth Century Communist Politics Once And For All, With Eight Diagrams, Six Colour Plates, A Big Map & Far Too Many Footnotes (Thedoobiebrothers Books, PS16.99). Here is a short extract, including one of those infernal footnotes--which itself has a footnote:\nLet us consider the fact that Stalin's childhood nickname was \"Soso\". Later he became \"Koba\", and of course \"Stalin\" itself is a nickname, the \"Man of Steel\". There are profound implications here. Was Dobson, as a child, not known as \"Doso\"? In his twenties, was it not common for such friends as he had to call him \"Doba\"? Did he not later become known as the \"Man of Bandages?\" *\n*NOTE : Just before this book went to press, the author received decisive information. Apparently, not one of these nicknames was ever applied to Dobson. Even when he was a babe in swaddling clothes, his parents addressed him as \"Dobson\", as did everyone else he ever met throughout his life. There are those who will carp and say my theory is thus invalidated. A pox upon them! Just take a look at these photographs: one shows a gigantic poster of Stalin at the height of his personality cult; the other shows a huge billboard with what is incontrovertibly the image of Dobson.*\n\n* For copyright reasons I am unable to reproduce the extremely similar Dobson photograph.\n###"}

I venture to suggest that Tara Palmer-Tomkinson's name will likewise ring down the centuries, yea, e'en unto the time when, as Carl Sagan so memorably put it, \"the earth is a charred cinder, and the sun... dead\".

Touching with all reverence on the proper study of religious books, Dr Conolly lamented that morbid brooding over subjects of theology and points of doctrine is such a fruitful cause of mental diseases... Although Dr Conolly's remarks pointed generally to the impropriety and danger of persons--ladies especially--abandoning themselves to self-guidance, and over-prolonged contemplation on subjects of religious controversy, he severely commented upon the injurious effects of those poisonous literary emanations appearing without authority, and dignified most improperly by the name of 'religious'.\"\nI have to say that some of the greatest pleasures of my life have been found in morbid brooding about abstruse points of theological doctrine. Still, now I know better, don't I? The quoted passage is from Things Not Generally Known by John Timbs (1858), where you can also read about such matters as insensibility of the brain, dread of eclipses, unpopular improvements, and the Death of the Beetle and the Giant.

Like \"solipsism\", this is a coinage by Horace Walpole, but sadly one which never caught on. When the future George III was a teenager, his grandfather tried to marry him off to a European princess, much to the dismay of George's mother. The name of the princess was Sophia Caroline Maria, daughter of the Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel. Under his mother's influence, George became fretful and aghast at the proposal, and--as Walpole wrote--he \"declares violently against being bewolfenbuttled\". To resurrect the word successfully, perhaps it is necessary to widen it from the sense of being forced into an arranged marriage to being forced into anything one doesn't want to do.

He whistles the song of the warbler, and then shows them how to draw the masked shrike. We are asked to believe that sensible British chaps would rather risk gruesome death at the hands of the Gestapo when they could see out the war having bird-life explained to them by eerie-eyed Donald Pleasence.

The gravediggers have pointy spades, too, but they are not as pointy as the shovels. The shovels could not be more pointy.\nThere is a price to be paid for all this pointiness. It is a price paid sometimes in blood, sometimes in coinage, and sometimes in toads. Pointy Towners will roam the marsh flats outside Pointy Town collecting in baskets the toads that live there. Most of the toads have pointy bits, though perhaps they are more knobby than pointy. Pointy Town's genetic engineers are working hard to breed a pointier toad. If and when they succeed, the knobby toads will become worthless as currency and will be left to go about their toady business in the marsh flats undisturbed.\n###"}

For my own part I cannot conceive how a man with good red blood in his veins could look a chirky little robin in the eye and call him to his face a Planesticus migratorius, when as chubby youngster he had known the bird and loved him as Robin Red-Breast.

These were early collaborations between Max Decharne and Frank Key and are, just like Dobson's pamphlets, sadly out of print.

{"prompt": "Dobson's Commentary on the Above\n", "completion": " At a loose end one blustery Thursday morning, Dobson decided to write a lengthy critical analysis of the The Life & Times of Captain Cake. He began, as he always did, by sharpening his pencil. That done, in a single burst of inexplicable enthusiasm, he penned an essay much, much longer than his usual pamphlets. It is a bewildering piece of work, caustic and trenchant even by Dobson's standards, and was issued in fifteen weekly instalments. Flush with cash from the sale of his Big Mysterious Piece of Hardboard, Dobson took out advertisements in the press to announce his new part-work, offering the first issue at a discount price, and including a two-inch high plastic figurine of Captain Cake* as further inducement.\nEach of the fifteen instalments addresses a different aspect of the text. So, for example, Volume IV is entitled Welk, Bankhead, Loy : There'll Be A Welcome In The Hillsides while Volumes VIII and IX both concentrate entirely on the game of ping pong. Long out of print, this superb (if unintelligible) essay is ripe for reassessment in the 21st century which Dobson did not live to see. Over the coming months, the Hooting Yard Foundation hopes to publish on this site a hypertext version of the essay. Be in no doubt that it will prove a boon to scholars worldwide.\n* NOTE : The distinguished critic and pirate F. X. Gilliblat claims that the figurine bears no resemblancewhatsoever to Captain Cake. He may well be right.\n###"}

But of course there are all sorts of bags, from the pippy to the tea, so I would need to spell out precisely what bags my note was about, if it were about nothing but bags, and had nothing to add on holes and monks and moths and palaces and Tsars and corridors and Yoko Ono, but it concerns itself with all those things, so the title as given is a misnomer. \"An Imprecisely-Named Note On Bags\" might do the trick, or \"A Set Of Notes On Bags And Other Things\".

The sight of a carcass bulging frenetically in the dim undersea light, with a dozen of these lovelies inside, is... something. On top of that, if you keep hagfish in an aquarium and reach in to pick them up, they instantly exude a chemical that mixes with seawater to produce a huge ball of snot all around them, which you are left holding as they slip away.\n\n\nHagfish diagram from Bigelow and Schroeder, 1948, p. 34.\n###"}

In what must be one of the most bizarre coups of all time, Wamba was drugged and dressed as a monk. The rebels also shaved his head, because to the Visigoths long hair was a symbol of sovereignty. The embarrassed king stood aside for the rebel leader Ervigius. Then, when Ervigius' grandson Witiza died, a brief civil war of succession put King Roderick on the throne in 710 in place of Witiza's son, Achila.

Born in Belgium, she came to Britain in her early twenties after her marriage to my father. One of the ways she chose to improve her English was by reading through the canon--Jane Austen, the Brontes, George Eliot, Dickens, et cetera. She eventually decided to tackle Ulysses.

{"prompt": "Matters Of Note\n", "completion": " Two unrelated matters of note to draw to your attention. I was going to write \"two unrelated headlines\", but \"headline\" suggests news, and one of these is not only three years old but was not a \"news headline\" even then.\nThough having said they are unrelated it now occurs to me that one could in fact connect the two, or imagine a scenario in which they were jammed together, for example, by using the contraption in (A) to view the incident in (B).\n(A), then, is Build Your Own Dobsonian Telescope. Tragically--and I am quite clear about the usage of that word--the Dobson in question is not our beloved out of print pamphleteer, but another Dobson entirely. Still, to discover that such a thing as a Dobsonian telescope exists, and that its creator might, every now and then, be mistaken for our Dobson, is most pleasing.\n(B) is news that a Japanese fishing trawler has been sunk by giant jellyfish. Unfortunately, the details of the story are rather prosaic. You might want to skip them, and instead imagine you are standing upon a promontory on the coast of Japan, peering through your Dobsonian telescope at the terrible sight of a fishing boat being attacked by a hideous semi-transparent sea monster with flailing tentacles.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Some Interesting Lops\n", "completion": " First, let us consider Ferdinand Lop. During the Fourth Republic in France, Lop was a serial election candidate. Perhaps his most memorable policy was his promise to extend the Boulevard Saint-Michel in Paris in both directions until it reached the sea. I am not making him up. So often did his candidacy for various offices appear on ballot papers that he provoked the creation of an anti-Lop party, called, superbly, the Anti-Lops.\nSecond, Loplop, Max Ernst's \"Bird Superior\", which first appeared in 1929. Here it is:\n\nThis anthropomorphic bird-man with beaked head and human body (occasionally depicted with wings as well) became Ernst's alter ego in numerous works in different media--collage, painting, and relief. Loplop is sometimes represented as a complete figure, sometimes in abbreviated fashion with disembodied head and hand, as he presents or introduces pictures within pictures--leaves or flowers, a young woman, fellow Surrealists, butterflies or, as in the picture above, other birds.\nThird, and still on the topic of birds, we have the lopwit. This bird does not actually exist, although I thought it did. It appears in A Catalogue Of 53 Birds, and pretty much nowhere else. A Google search for \"lopwit\" elicits four results, two of which are from Hooting Yard. And I was convinced that such a thing as the lopwit existed. Ah well.\n###"}

Then I heard a shout. A fellow was waving from the opposite bank. At first I thought he was some kind of crank. But it was Paul Weller, to my amaze, dressed as he was in his Style Council days.

The film follows the bird as it flies around, swooping down to catch and gobble up crane flies, horse flies, deer flies, beetles, dragonflies, crickets, grasshoppers, ants, mayflies, butterflies, caddis flies and moths. No explicit moral judgements are made, though at one point an ornithologist, observing the slaughter, remarks \"They're just insects\".\nThe film has provoked controversy in the United States, winning plaudits from right-wingers while those on the liberal left have condemned it for painting a picture of unalloyed avian savagery, instead of showing nature as twee and cuddly.\nThe role of the American snipe is played by an award-winning snipe with a particularly long slender pointy bill.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Lilliputian Rabbits, Etc.\n", "completion": " Henry Fuseli ate a diet of raw meat in order to obtain splendid dreams. Lamb spoke of \"Lilliputian rabbits\" when eating frog fricassee; and his sister Mary, wielding a knife, chased a little girl who was helping her in the kitchen and then stabbed her own mother through the heart; Hazlitt was perceptive about musculature and boxers; Wordsworth used a buttery knife to cut the pages of a first-edition Burke. Coleridge, his head shrouded in a fog, read poetry badly and moaned gloomily. The dreams of Jean Paul, the crow that loved the storm, reverberated across the Lake District... There were others who helped themselves to dreams. Robert Southey experimented with laughing gas. Ann Radcliffe sought out huge quantities of indigestible food to reinforce her terrible night visions. Mrs Leigh Hunt was proud to have produced an apocalyptic dream, which then appeared in a poem by Shelley. Coleridge, distracted by the scratching of his pen over the paper while transcribing his dream, forgot part of it. And Lamb complained about the derelict impoverishment of his dreams.\nFrom Three Possible Lives by Fleur Jaeggy (2005). The lives of which she writes are of Thomas De Quincey, John Keats, and Marcel Schwob.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Bird Observation\n", "completion": " Pansy Cradledew reports that a pigeon, or possibly a cumulet, has become a regular visitor to her sixteenth-floor windowsill. The curious thing about this pigeon is that it spends all its time on these visits standing on one leg. Pansy wonders if this is normal pigeon behaviour, or if her visitor is some sort of avian Ian Anderson, legendary fish farmer and flautist of Jethro Tull, who was of course noted for playing his flute while perched on one leg. I suggested that the best way to test this theory was to whittle a twig into a rudimentary bird flute, lodge it in the bird's beak, and wait to hear what mellifluous sounds may emerge. I shall keep readers apprised of the results of this important experiment.\n###"}

My father, too, and one of my sisters, and a priest who had joined us for the picnic, clad in his black soutane, but non-magnetic.

His first words--uttered on the day of his birth--were \"I am a Christian\". He then asked to be baptised, and to receive Holy Communion. The next day he preached a sermon, quoting freely from the Bible. On the third day, he gave another sermon, addressed to his parents, after which he keeled over and died.

The bulk of the contents he wrote himself, allowing the occasional interjection from Ruhugu, Moop, Trellis and the others. Only Jubble had been barred from its pages, because he was unhinged.\nEvery five years, Doctor Cack published, as a separate volume, a cumulative index to the Bulletin. His skills lay in thematic rather than purely alphabetic indexing.

{"prompt": "1848\n", "completion": " Zamoyski is adept at painterly scene-setting. One vivid paragraph shows the Paris revolution of 1848, which sent King Louis Philippe scurrying into exile and ignited populist insurrections across Europe, as caused by a clumsy bandsman with a big drum. After a day of innocuous, anti-climactic Paris demonstrations, a company of soldiers stationed on a boulevard corner tried to retreat from a rowdy but hardly murderous crowd into the courtyard of the ministry of foreign affairs. They were blocked because the musician carrying the drum got jammed in the porte-cochere of the ministry. As a result some soldiers had to turn and face the crowd, grew rattled, and fired shots that left over 30 dead. The mangled corpses were piled onto a wagon, which was trundled through the streets of Paris by rabble-rousers crying for revenge. It was the drummer, rather than the previous uprisings in Palermo and Naples, and the granting of constitutions in Sicily, Sardinia and Tuscany, that triggered the continent-wide uprisings of 1848.\nRupert Davenport-Hines reviewing Phantom Terror: The Threat of Revolution and the Repression of Liberty, 1789--1848 by Adam Zamoyski in The Spectator.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Zoist Spasms\n", "completion": " \"Spasms (kraempfe) are an affection to which almost all sensitives are especially inclined. Many, especially those of a higher degree, suffer from them severely. They form the last term of the series--stomach-ache, head-ache, fainting, spasm. They may be occasioned by magnets, by terrestrial magnetism, by poles of crystals, by amorphous, unipolar, bodies, either odo-positive or odo-negative, by human odic poles, by the prismatic rays of either the solar or lunar spectrum, particularly the green rays, by down passes, but oftener by up passes, by charging and conduction, whether immediate or approximative, by the mere odic atmosphere, by the psychical action of insult, grief, anxiety, fear, annoyance, jealousy, quarrels, mental exertion, joy, or even dreams. They are most conspicuous in the extremities, solar plexus, and head. They can be artificially excited and calmed, or depart naturally. They often follow a tolerably similar course from the toes through the abdomen to the brain, and thence down the spinal cord, like a pass. In most cases they can be more or less easily calmed by down passes. Hence as they are essentially related to sensitiveness, and immediately dependent on odic motions, they undoubtedly belong to the domain of od.\"\nFrom Reichenbach and his Researches : the principal \"Laws of Sensitiveness\" abstracted from Reichenbach's work DER SENSITIVE MENSCH, by ALEXANDER J ELLIS, B.A., Trin.

Its 'waist' was girdled with a ring of repelatron radiators for exerting a repulsion force when it wanted to move, by repelling itself away from nearby objects. Below the repelatrons was an hourglass-shaped power unit, housing a solar-charged battery. The power unit, in turn, was mounted on a pancake-shaped transportation unit. This unit was equipped with both casters and a sort of caterpillar-crawler arrangement for the contrivance to get about over obstacles. Inside was a gyro-stabilizer to keep the whole device upright.

They attach themselves to your ankles and bite you, you my carriers. They cannot bite me, for I am beyond their reach in my palanquin. Its draperies are tattered and torn. But I am clued up. Yes, I am all clued up and wise to tricks and box-hot. Carry me, carry me down with all due haste, for we must reach the plain before midnight strikes.

Anthony Burgess is mentioned in the text, which gives me an excuse to remind you lot of his biographer Roger Lewis' matchless description of the Mancunian polymath's hair:\nAnd how are we going to describe his hair? The yellowish-white powdery strands were coiled on his scalp like Bram Stoker's Dracula's peruke, not maintained since Prince Vlad the Impaler fought off the Turks in the Carpathian mountains in 1462. What does it say about a man that he could go around like that, as Burgess did? Though he was a king of the comb-over (did the clumps and fronds emanate from his ear-hole?), no professional barber can be blamed for this. I thought to myself, he has no idea how strange he is. What did he think he looked like? He evidently operated on his own head with a pair of garden shears.\n\n###"}

According to its Facecloth page, this \"project\" aims to \"challenge the silence surrounding the assassination\" of President Kennedy and three other \"leaders for peace\" (Robert Kennedy, Dr King (as we must always call him), and Malcolm X).\nEr ... what silence is that, precisely? There are so many books about the JFK assassination that even Vincent Bugliosi hasn't had time--in the twenty-plus years he worked on his book--to read all of them. Not to mention the magazine articles, television documentaries, and feature films. The deaths of the other three have not attracted quite that level of attention, but they have hardly been ignored and cast into the dustbin of history ((c) Leon Trotsky, another murderee who surely ought to be on Project Unspeakable's list. Oh, hang on, he wasn't American, and he was ice-picked by a Stalinist agent, so in Unspeakable circles that's probably all above board.)\nThe \"conspiracy of silence\" is about as silent as Hooting Yard, which as you know hardly ever shuts up.\n###"}

When the lights came up, Kahn had disappeared, and VerEecke had taken her place in the same crumpled position.

I take the liberty of reproducing it here for your edification and instruction. Our resident anagrammatist R. (who is not Richard, by the way) should find it of particular interest:\nSteven Shapin writes that Darwin's uncontrollable retching and farting seriously limited his public life (LRB, 30 June). Some years ago, to my delight, I worked out that the great man's full name, Charles Robert Darwin, is an anagram of 'rectal winds abhorrer'. Unfortunately for my anagram, the meanings of words, like species, can evolve. On the rare occasions that Darwin mentioned his problems to friends, he always used the word 'flatulence'. Nowadays, we think of flatulence as being synonymous with farting, but in Darwin's day it meant (as it technically still does) an accumulation of gases in the alimentary canal. While I'm sure that Darwin must have vented his excess gas one way or the other, there's no reason to believe that his farts were uncontrollable.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Impenetrable Language\n", "completion": " There may be readers who understand the above quotation. I like it for the simple reason that no matter how closely I read it, I know that it would take years of study before I could ever eke any meaning from it. There is a fascination in impenetrable texts which is quite different from looking at a passage written in a foreign language of which one is ignorant: that has its own pleasures, of course. Most of the words above are familiar to me; the ones that aren't I can look up in a dictionary; and still I will be unable to wring any sense out of it. I used to be a regular reader of the Bridge column in one of the Sunday newspapers. I have never played Bridge, nor had any desire to do so, but I loved these short texts describing situations, tactics and possibilities of a game whose rules I knew not.

(Praeterita, Volume II, Chapter XI, paragraph 215.) Lord knows there are plenty of maps of Switzerland made with foolhardiness and stupidity, and you might have gone and bought one of those.

The vessels were charged with liquors of various colours of intense brilliancy and transparency; some of these fluids were water, milk, wine, fire, &c. Every motion of Adam's body produced ineffable harmonies. Every creature obeyed him; nothing could resist or injure him. He was taller than men of this time; his hair was short, curled, and approaching to black. He had a little down on his lower lip. In his stomach was a clear fluid, like water in a crystal bowl, in which tiny eggs developed themselves, like bubbles in wine, as he glowed with the ardour of Divine charity; and when he strongly desired that others should unite with him in the work of praise, he deposited some of these eggs, which hatched, and from one of them emerged his consort, Eve.\"\nSabine Baring-Gould, Curiosities Of Olden Times (1869)\nIf you have seen anyone answering to this description, please contact your local police, or a priest, in strictest confidence.\n###"}

We have recommended that to snap him out of his silence, he is to be sent for a few days to his glorious Motherland--that is, Belgium--in the hope that upon his return he will start tippy-tapping away as he usually does. Word has it that he may yet be ready to unleash a series of rattling yarns about Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers. It is unclear whether these tales will be based on historical fact, or whether Mr Key intends simply to make use of the names for a fictional 'dismal duo'.

Without this dear dumb brute, existence would have been well-nigh unbearable.

{"prompt": "Disparate Horseflies\n", "completion": " \nEver since it ended, after eight seasons, in 2012, fans of the television comedy-drama Desperate Housewives have been hoping for a sequel. Now it appears their prayers have been answered. Next month sees the launch of a brand new television comedy-drama called Disparate Horseflies.\nSet on a horse named Wisteria, the show features the amusing and sometimes not so amusing antics of a group of horseflies who live, parasitically, upon its shanks, withers, fetlocks, and other parts of a horse which I am sure you can list for yourselves. As the title implies, the flies are a varied bunch, apart from their all being flies of the horsefly family (Tabanus sulcifrons).\nThe cast comprises several actual horseflies, specially trained to act by tiptop thespian fly-trainer Cedric Flytrain. For the setting of Wisteria, an elegant if tubercular horse named Keith, resident at a stables in Vileshire, was employed.\nPreview tapes have not been made available, but word has it that the first episode includes close-up scenes of grotesque horsefly behaviour which some viewers, and horses, may find absolutely sickening.\n###"}

My understanding is that, rather than making a series of three films, Bourne-style, Mr Eastwood intends to compact the narrative into a single movie, entitled American Snipper.

Thanks to Max Decharne, I am able to reproduce one such cutting here. (Click to enlarge.)\n\n###"}

They honked and pecked and I was undone, so I went to the shops for another plum.

Apparently, that rustic paradise is riddled with irresponsible shepherds who, among sundry enormities, allow their sheep to bleat in the middle of the night.\nPersonally, I am not surprised to learn about outbreaks of nocturnal bleating. Sheep are highly neurasthenic creatures who spend their entire lives in a state of fretfulness and nervous tension, and as a result they rarely sleep. This is probably one reason why, as has been observed by several country persons, a sheep's ambition in life is to die.\n###"}

As you may already know, Witter is an exciting new social networking service, designed for people with pea-sized brains who want to shrink them further, even unto the point of invisibility. The idea is that, every fifty years, \"witterers\" write an account of their doings, in beautiful if somewhat clogged handwriting, on sheets of vellum, and roll the sheets up, and seal them with wax, and carry them around the countryside, stopping every now and then to accost a wayfarer or a peasant, whom they shove into a ditch, and to whom they then read the \"witter\", aloud, and at length. I think you will all agree that this is a splendid new way to get the Hooting Yard message across to folk far and wide.\nWitter should not be confused with a similar service, recently popularised by, among others, the Most Intelligent Life-Form Ever To Walk The Earth, otherwise known as Stephen Fry, who cleverly uses it to demonstrate his command of childish scatological exclamations, to the delight of a thankful nation.\n\"All man's miseries derive from not being able to sit quietly in a room alone.\"--Pascal\n###"}

Anyway, for those (and they are legion) who like this sort of thing, here is a Kennedy Assassination Fact.\nIn November 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald's wife Marina, and the two children, were staying in the house of Ruth Paine, a Quaker, in the suburb of Irving. Oswald stayed in a Dallas rooming-house during the week and joined them at weekends. He kept his Mannlicher Carcano rifle in Ruth Paine's garage. Blah blah blah. The interesting fact is as follows. Ruth's husband Michael Paine (who had moved out of the house for reasons unrelated to the Oswalds) was the great-great-grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson and also a direct descendant of one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, Robert Treat Paine.\nI am really glad to know that smidgeon of information, useless as it is.

I sometimes worry that less attention is paid to some crunches because they lack the alliterative quality of the credit crunch, which of course makes it a favourite of headline writers and broadcasters. Actually, it's not quite true that I \"sometimes\" worry about this. If truth be told, my fretfulness about neglected crunches is starting to consume my every waking thought. Yesterday, for example, I was standing upon a bridge, staring off into the distance, buffeted by a gale, and all I could think of was the fact that the credit crunch is pushing some of my preferred crunches off the front pages. I don't have any useful media connections--or, to be more precise, my people don't have any connections with their people--so it's not as if I can just send a few metal tapping machine messages to selected newspaper crunch reporters and put pressure on them to cover other crunches. Would that I could! What I did instead, yesterday, was to trudge disconsolately home and to spend a fruitful few hours studying Pebblehead's bestselling paperback The Bumper Book Of Crunches. I can recommend this fantastic, and very fat, book to anyone who seeks to broaden their knowledge beyond the credit crunch.

Indeed, he has also essayed a reading of some twaddle I wrote about venomous serpents.\nThe striking thing about this new version of the Goat God Catechism is Mr O'Hara's inspired decision to have a child read the responses.

The book in question was Ulysses by James Joyce--he invariably pronounced it \"Oolissis\", by the way--and these were the passages I found so diverting:\n\"An immense mass of clotted nonsense\"--Teachers' World\n\"The maddest, muddiest, most loathsome book issued in our own or any other time... inartistic, incoherent, unquotably nasty ... a book that one would have thought could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum.\"--The Sphere\nI can now recommend a couple more such tirades, though in this case the book is less well-known. Adah Isaacs Menken (1835-1868) was an actress, painter, poet, possible bigamist, and bareback circus equestrienne, and in the last year of her life she published a volume of poetry entitled Infelicia. In order to drum up sales, the rumour was spread, perhaps by Menken herself, that some, or all, of the poems were in fact written by her pal Algernon Charles Swinburne. However, all of them had previously appeared in various American magazines before she even met Swinburne. Infelicia's lack of success may have been due, at least partly, to reviews such as these:\n\"A wilderness of rubbish and affected agonies of yearnings after the unspeakable, which achieve the nonsensical.\"--The Athenaeum\n\"A bleared panorama of deaths and sighs and blood and tears and fire and general gloom and watery ghastliness.\"--The Saturday Review\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "Tanis Diena\n", "completion": " Here is what to do. Get a pig's head and place it on top of a stone. This will protect you from thunder and lightning. When you've done that, go to your nearest pig pen. Leaning on the fence, sing songs in celebration of the fertility of pigs. If you do not know any such songs, make one up. After lunch, bury the rest of the pig whose head is atop the stone, except for its feet. You will probably have eaten the head and the feet for lunch, with or without a garnish. Make sure you refrain from needlework all day, and don't drink when you are at home. Keep an eye on the weather. If it is foggy, start gathering sandbags, for soon there will be floods. At all times bear in mind that you are in Ancient Latvia and that today is Tanis Diena, the sacred pig holiday.\n\nHooting Yard recommends the wikipedia.\n###"}

Why, it is a film entitled Creekside Artists, made by Endwell Productions as long ago as 2006-7, the soundtrack of which is a direct recording of Mr Key babbling away on the radio about Dobson, Marigold Chew, squirrels, and seagulls.

{"prompt": "Two Monks\n", "completion": " Alfred Wesley Wishart's phrase \"two monks took the blood of a duck\", which appears above in today's quotation, was appropriated by the poet Dennis Beerpint as the title of a lengthy, as-yet-unpublished work. It may be that he is still writing it, but our regular Beerpint-watcher, Dan Sprawl, is currently in hospital with a case of jangling cav and pag, so news is limited.\nWhat we do know is that the prose-poem compares the image of monks draining blood from a duck with the concept of being \"washed in the blood of the lamb\". Here is an extract:\nThen Brother Fabrizius strangled another teal. \"Hand me that retort, Brother Arpad, so that I may decant into it this teal's gore.\" Brother Arpad reached for the retort and in so doing smashed an alembic. There was a sound of bells. The monks were called to compline. For each canonical hour they allocated a duck to be slaughtered for its blood. At compline, a teal. At matins, a merganser. At prime, a pintail. At tierce, a shoveler. At sext, a wigeon. At nones, a smew. And at vespers, a bufflehead. Out in the fields, sweet little lambs gambolled and frolicked. They would not frolic for long, for soon, in the monastery, it would be bathtime.\n###"}

(It may well be that some readers are already familiar with them/him, but I was not, until this year.) I have been particularly taken with The Getty Address. Here is a description of it: \" Inspired by Aztec mythology, the Eagles, and the 9/11 aftermath, it is a sprawling, layered glitch opera about Don Henley, leader of the aforementioned country/soft-rock group, and it was recorded over the course of almost two years, in three different states, with more than twenty-five people. Dave Longstreth, the principal Dirty Projector, wrote and recorded arrangements for wind septet, women's choir, and cello octet, digitally deconstructed them, and then sang over the reconstituted parts in order to make these songs.\" If that doesn't sound exciting enough for you, consider this further note, from the Wikipedia: \"Although the lyrics have been described as gibberish, the words actually do tell a narrative beginning with Don Henley contemplating suicide, and ending with a new installment of Longstreth's songs involving brown finches.\" I need hardly point out that anybody who writes a series of songs \"involving brown finches\" is almost certainly a genius.\n###"}

It occurs to me that it serves as a first variation on a theme by Gerard Manley Hopkins, the \"theme\" in this case being the tall nun from The Wreck Of The Deutschland. Her name, incidentally, was Henrica Fassbender, her last words were reported as \"Oh Christ, Christ, come quickly!\", and her body was never found. But she is commemorated on the headstone in St Patrick's Cemetery, Leytonstone, where the other four drowned Franciscan nuns were buried. Go here for a photograph of the headstone and an amusing anecdote.\nSister Hortense, the even taller nun in my little tale, is not actually based on Henrica Fassbender. All they have in common is nundom, tallness, and of course a predilection for ships, in Hortense's case a barquentine, in Henrica's a German steamship.\n###"}

{"prompt": "A Rain Of Fruit\n", "completion": " If instead of one apple falling on the head of Sir Isaac Newton a heavenly orchard had let tumble a rain of fruit, one of the greatest of men would have been overwhelmed and then buried. Anyone examining the situation afterwards in a properly scientific spirit, clearing the apples layer by layer, would be able to deduce certain facts. He would be able to prove that the man was there before the apples. Furthermore, that the blushing Beauty of Bath found immediately over and round Sir Isaac fell longer ago than the small swarthy russets that lay above them. If, on top of all this, snow had fallen, then the observer, even if he came from Mars where they are not familiar with these things, would know that apple time came before snow time.\nRelative ages are not enough, the observer would want an absolute date, and that is where Sir Isaac comes in again. An examination of his clothes, the long-skirted coat, the loose breeches and the negligent cut of his linen, the long, square-toed shoes pointing so forlornly up to the sky, would date the man to the seventeenth century. Here would be a clue to the age of the apples and the snow.\nJacquetta Hawkes, A Land (1951). There is an interesting piece about the book here.\n\n###"}

While I agree with you that it is the most faithful of the many Hopkins adaptations, I have a deep personal affection for The Cheery Beggar, despite the unfortunate miscasting of Aldo Ray as the Polynesian sponge-diver. Thank you for your consideration.\nI am afraid that the schedule has not yet been finalised, so cannot say when this majestic piece of cimema will be shown. One point about The Cheery Beggar which my anonymous correspondent does not mention is that the film marked the screen debut of the great child Method actor Tad Wensleydale. At the age of seven, he had already taken Broadway by storm with his performances as Shylock, Lear, Mrs Miniver, Torquemada, Mike Hammer, Louis Pasteur and Clytemnestra, among others. Six years later, on the cusp of teenage hobbledehoyhood, his meteoric career was effectively over, but not before he had appeared in a second Hopkins adaptation, Felix Randal The Farrier. Wensleydale was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the \"big-boned and hardy-handsome\" title character, stone dead at the beginning of the film, but the award that year went to Ricardo Montalban.\n###"}

Juice from the blood oranges dribbled down our jaws. From the discomfort of his beach chair, Enver Hoxha directed my attention to the left. I looked, and saw a rowing boat, and the rowing boat's oars. The oars were too small for the rowing boat--or--the rowing boat was too big for the oars. I turned to look at Enver Hoxha. After a pause, he rose, and pulled from his pocket a length of gauze. When he went, he shook my hand, but he did not let fall the gauze. He spoke then. He said he had to go and draft some new Albanian laws. I recall nothing more.\n###"}

From Thursday to the following Wednesday, each time he chewed something he wrote down a keyword on a fresh sheet of A4 paper. So, for example, Saturday morning's batch included suet, button, Garibaldi biscuit, pencil, pastille, tongue, bootlace, boiled sweet and cork. Armed with a large sheaf of paper, the out-of-print pamphleteer spent the following week annotating these bald words. He wrote potted histories of manufacturing processes, Proustian evocations, trivial facts, hallucinatory scribblings, and passages of pseudo-scientific conjecture. He even added some crayon drawings that can best be described as primitive. In each case he restricted himself to the single A4 sheet. The work complete, he hawked his manuscript around all the publishing firms he knew who had offices in the slums. Not one of them would take it. In despair, Dobson stowed away on an aeroplane bound for Winnipeg, where he cast his manuscript into the Assiniboine. Returning home, he wrote the pitiful pamphlet How My Annotated List Of Chewed Things Was Lost In A Muddy Canadian River, copies of which he gave as Christmas presents to his friends in 1958.\n###"}

He would invoke disastrous plutonian gods, and have them frolic, miniaturised, before Blodgett's eyes, occasionally tweaking the hairs from his nostrils.

{"prompt": "Aesop's Foibles\n", "completion": " Any account of Aesop's foibles is necessarily hampered by the fact that we know so very little about him. Indeed, it is not certain that he ever actually existed. Assuming, for the moment, that he did exist, and made up at least some of the stories attributed to him, we could advance the idea that it is a peculiar foible to bang on about animals having the powers of human speech and reason. It is the sort of conceit a writer might use once or twice, for a particular artistic purpose, but to keep returning to it again and again indicates a low-level mania we could describe as a foible. Then there is Plutarch's story that Aesop was convicted of theft from a temple and subsequently thrown off a cliff. Charitably, we could say that petty larceny, such as stealing a bitty-bob from a place of worship, is better described as a foible than as the character flaw of the habitual criminal, as revealed by phrenology. But these are slim pickings, and until we are able to discover more about the historical Aesop, we have no basis upon which to impute further foibles to him.\n\n###"}

These were inexpensive chapbooks--softcover books of four to twenty-four pages that often were illustrated with woodcuts. More embarked on this project, which she said \"barely leaves me time to eat\", because she was disturbed that contemporary chapbooks were secular works that often were ribald. She told Hester Piozzi that \"30,000 Hawkers are maintain'd by this dissolute Traffic, and Boat loads of it [chapbooks] are sent away from the Trading Towns to infect the villages\". She wanted to circulate \"Religious and Useful Knowledge as an antidote to the poison continually flowing thro' the channel of vulgar and licentious publications\".\nThe \"religious and useful knowledge\" would be contained in short stories about \"Striking Conversions, Holy Lives, Happy Deaths, Providential Deliverances, Judgements on the Breakers of Commandments, Stories of Good and Wicked Apprentices, Hardened Sinners, Pious Servants &c\". More wrote many tracts herself (they were published anonymously but those marked Z were written by her). The tracts are well written and often describe accurately the lives of the rural poor, but they always have a predictable ending.

When the turkey's wings spread wide and began to flap frantically above her head as she whirled, the great bird seemed larger and more powerful than she; it seemed that she would be dragged from her feet, hurled to the ground, or flown away with fabulously into the sky. And as she sought finally to tear off its head, sought to clutch its body between her knees, it attacked her savagely, beating her face and breasts, beating at her so that she was at moments enfolded by the great white wings, so that bird and woman seemed to mingle struggling in a monstrous, mythical embrace. But her fatal hands were still upon its throat, and in that swanlike simulacre of the deed which for the male is always like a little death, it died.\nSo savage had this scene been that it was almost like an anticlimax when the sacrificial goat was now led through the doorway to the altar...\nW B Seabrook describes his voodoo blood baptism in Haiti in The Magic Island (1929)\n###"}

In his pamphlet How To Dye A Goat (out of print), he hammered home the very same point, or almost the same point, attending as he did to the dyeing of goats rather than to the dyeing of sheep, over dozens of pages, to such effect that there is not a single recorded incident of a person dyeing someone else's goat for the entire period that the pamphlet was available in all good goat-related bookshops and/or airport terminals.\n###"}

(It was Lloyd George who remarked that Chamberlain had \"a wrong-shaped head\". Lord knows what he would have made of the bonce of a killer robot.)\nAlas, it appears from the video kindly posted by Mr Eugenides that the PM-robot encounter was not quite as blood-curdling as we are led to believe. This just goes to show that you simply cannot trust most of what you read, either in newspapers or on the interweb. One shining exception, of course, is Hooting Yard. I am regularly discomfited when it is suggested that I make a lot of this stuff up, whereas I spend untold hours engaged in rigorous, yes, damned rigorous research to bring you the nuggets of wisdom contained herein.

But his case provides no rule and the fact remains that a great deal of music, especially at the present time, is either extemporized at the keyboard or else built up of fragments discovered, more or less fortuitously at the pianoforte and afterwards unskillfully glued together.\nPeter Warlock, 'A Note On The Mind's Ear', Musical Times, February 1922\nBoth quotations appear in Peter Warlock : The Life Of Philip Heseltine by Barry Smith (1994)\n###"}

I will be taking up the invitation (the command?) to listen again to Wyatt's extensive back catalogue.

The cur-tailor has taken out the most purple piece in the whole web--the end of the fourth Act--and shouldered himself into toleration through the prejudices of the pit, when he should have built his admiration on their necks. Say what you will, I am convinced the man who is to awaken the drama must be a bold trampling fellow, no creeper into worm-holes, no reviver even, however good. These reanimations are vampire-cold. Such ghosts as Marloe, Webster &c. are better dramatists, better poets, I dare say, than any contemporary of ours, but they are ghosts; the worm is in their pages; and we want to see something that our great-grandsires did not know. With the greatest reverence for all the antiquities of the drama, I still think that we had better beget than revive; attempt to give the literature of this age an idiosyncrasy and spirit of its own, and only raise a ghost to gaze on, not to live with--just now the drama is a haunted ruin.\"\nThomas Lovell Beddoes (1803-1849), letter to Thomas Forbes Kelsall, 11 January 1825\n###"}

Below them, beyond the pig huts, the curiously-stained bridge, and the abandoned swimming baths, they were just able to see, shrouded in mist, the famous (or infamous) Wotan and Tantalum ponds, so dried up after successive droughts that they were now little more than puddles.\n\"Onwards!\" cried Captain Federico 'Gwyneth' Paltrow, undisputed leader of the Cormorant Patrol and the man whose stupendous energy had helped it thrive even through such lean times. Seldom has a puny and diminutive physiognomy been so misleading.\nAnd so began their descent. Three quarters of the way down, the newest recruit, fey young Daisy 'Ricardo' Montalban, stopped in her tracks, pointed, and yelled out: \"Look! Look! Something with a beak and feathers!\" And indeed, as they peered through the enshrouding mist, the others saw it too, perched on the branch of a withered pugton tree sprouting hopelessly on the banks of one of the ponds, or puddles. Excitedly, they began running, capering and gambolling down the muddy slope of the tor. But as they closed upon their prey, they realised it was not a cormorant at all. It was a little bittern.\nSource : Forty-Six Bird-Related Adventure Stories by Vercingetorix Sepulveda (out of print)\n###"}

It was close enough that I could make out various pompous ladies and gentleman promenading upon the harbour wall, in fustian and crinoline and tweed. But hours passed and the Weltschmerz Tug never seemed to get any nearer the shore, though the engine was chugging away, belching foul black blooms of smoke, poisoning the seabirds.

More delicate readers could relax at home with one of the more gentle 'feats of the yogi', such as 'hypnotizing a rabbit'. But anyone attempting the more adventurous pastimes would do well to read the instructions carefully. 'Chewing molten lead', for example, required a special compound that 'melts at approximately 160 degrees. If you wish a lower melting point, add to the above a small amount of quicksilver... When melted, this mixture may be poured on the tongue which, it goes without saying, must be moist with saliva.'

I was constructing a set of twenty-six alphabetical drawings, and decided that O would stand for Ortolan. How I arrived at this word without knowing what it meant I cannot recall. Anyway, I looked it up and learned that Ortolan was a synonym for Bunting. I then drew a picture of a string of triangular flags such as one might find at an outdoor gala. Only after the picture had been published, along with its twenty-five compadres, in the big fat paperback Small Press Yearbook (date forgotten, but circa 1990) did I discover that the Bunting in question was not flags but a bird. As readers know, since the last century my ornithological erudition has progressed by leaps and bounds and little birdy hops a la the robin. I cannot find a copy of my drawing, so these snaps, from here and here, must suffice.\n\nBunting, but not Ortolan\n\nBoth Bunting and Ortolan\n###"}

{"prompt": "Constipated Bees\n", "completion": " \"Among the animals who expend industry on hygiene and the protection of their dwellings, we must place Bees in the first line. It may happen that mice, snakes, and moths may find their way into a hive. Assaulted by the swarm, and riddled with stings, they die without being able to escape. These great corpses cannot be dragged out by the Hymenoptera, and their putrefaction threatens to cause disease. To remedy this scourge the insects immediately cover them with propolis--that is to say, the paste which they manufacture from the resin of poplars, birches, and pines. The corpse thus sheltered from contact with the air does not putrefy. In other respects Bees are very careful about the cleanliness of their dwellings; they remove with care and throw outside dust, mud, and sawdust which may be found there. Bees are careful also not to defile their hives with excrement, as Kirby noted; they go aside to expel their excretions, and in winter, when prevented by extreme cold or the closing of the hive from going out for this purpose, their bodies become so swollen from retention of faeces that when at last able to go out they fall to the ground and perish.\"\nFrom The Industries Of Animals by Frederic Houssay (1893)\nIs that not inexpressibly sad?\n###"}
{"prompt": "Origin Of The Potato Disorder\n", "completion": " Here is another newspaper cutting quoted in Deadly Encounters : Two Victorian Sensations by Richard D Altick, this one from the Illustrated Times, 10 August 1861:\nThat some unusual endemic excitement has been at work, directing weak, debauched, and diseased minds into a homicidal course, must be apparent to every newspaper-reader. May not the electrical condition of the atmosphere exercise some hidden power in this way over the human brain? A correspondent of the Standard, Dr. J. Q. Rumball, a well-known lecturer on science, points out electrical causes as the origin of the potato disorder. It is a fact that lately the finest mechanisms of clockwork, notably those at the Observatory at Greenwich, have been going wrong, without visible derangement or imperfection, and this has been attributed to an abnormal condition of atmospheric electricity. It is surely not a wildly-hazardous theory to suppose that a similar agency acting upon that most susceptible and complex of galvanic machines, the human brain, may have some tendency, if not to the actual increase of crime, of lessening the healthy power which restrains its committal or of aggravating the phrenal disease which but for such influence might have been subdued, or at least retarded.\n###"}

I had been hoping to regale you with some choice snippets from his biography of Robert Stephen Hawker, The Vicar Of Morwenstow (1886), but, frankly, I was a little disappointed. The most arresting of Hawker's eccentricities are listed in the opening paragraph of this piece, and Baring-Gould has little to add, save perhaps for a detailed account of the dressing-up-as-a-mermaid incident. (Part of my disappointment was to discover that this was a single occurrence rather than a general Hawker pastime.) However, the book is not without its pleasures, and I feel before we say farewell to Sabine we should mark this additional note about the vicar:\n\"After the death of Mrs Hawker, he fell into a condition of piteous depression, and began to eat opium. He moped about the cliffs, or in his study, and lost interest in every thing...\n\"He took it into his head that he could eat nothing but clotted cream. He therefore made his meals, breakfast, dinner, and tea, of this. He became consequently exceedingly bilious, and his depression grew the greater.\"\nThere is another particularly splendid passage, in which Baring-Gould transcribes the wording of a sign outside a \"little shop\" in Cornwall.

The statue is by Jacopo Sansovino (1486-1570), who was also known as Jacopo Tatti. Should you wish to ape an ancient Roman and celebrate the day, here's what to do: go out to a field and build yourself a little hut out of laurel branches. This is your umbra. Take a picnic, and make sure you drink mineral water. You can carry on picnicking and generally larking about until tomorrow. You may also wish to sacrifice a bull, or begin doing some irrigation work. Oh, and if you have a horse, try to get it to pay some sort of obeisance to Neptune. Apparently, he invented horses.\n###"}

Get yourself a vase and transfer the crocuses from the sack. Throw the sack away. Now--be deft! Manipulate the crocuses with delicacy, taste and vision. There is, of course, the possibility that you lack these qualities, in which case you may be better occupied throwing the crocuses away and retaining the burlap sack. With a pair of scissors and a sewing machine you will soon be able to turn it into a mightily uncomfortable vest which can be wrapped up and given as a Christmas or birthday gift to a devout Roman Catholic.

These mischievous sprites are reluctant to leave the snug lining of their bags, except to flit from one to another when they become oh so lonesome and feel compelled to procreate. If you creep ever so silently into a postal sorting office in El Paso at dead of night, you might be lucky enough to see a flickering sprite leaping between jiffy bags. If it sees you, it will be vexed, and cast a spell on you, and for twenty-six days and nights you will be tormented by visions of potato-headed monsters spewing ectoplasm in every direction. But if the sprite does not see you, you will have good luck for a twelvemonth, possibly involving the unexpected offer of an appearance in a radio advertisement for a thrilling new detergent or bleach product. That, at any rate, is what I was told by the Weird Woman of Woohooweedywood, and she has yet to be proved wrong in any of her pronouncements or incantations, except for the one about the badger in the hedge.\n\nThese are not Tex-Mex Jiffy Bag Sprites.

{"prompt": "Every Person Is Victimised By Satan (Apparently)\n", "completion": " A card popped through the letterbox today from the Morning Star Church Of God. I wondered if this was evidence of some new alliance between the Communist Party and evangelical Christians. Maybe the sermons would consist of harangues from the editorial pages of the Morning Star about the necessity of building the class struggle by going on strike every five minutes. I looked in vain for a hammer-and-sickle-and-crucifix motif on the card, then turned my attention to the text:\nAre You A Victim?, it read, Every person is victimised by Satan, either by Depression, Stress, Heart Problems, Baroness, Skin Diseases, Kidney, Cancer, ENT and many more. No Hope + No Cure = No Peace. But There Is Hope.\nMy initial surmise about the Communist element was clearly correct. Not only does Satan plague us with ailments and infirmities, but sets the aristocracy against us in the form of that Baroness. I pictured a sort of fairy tale baddie, or \"Baroness\" Margaret Thatcher, though of course it's hard to tell the difference.\nIncidentally, when I am eventually ennobled, as is bound to happen sooner or later, I think I'd like to be a Baron.

{"prompt": "Is Jesus Irresponsible?\n", "completion": " Dear Mr Key, writes Pansy Cradledew, I fear I must protest that you gave publicity to Jesus Inspirational Sport Statues by including it as one of your so-called 'detours' yesterday. In many of the representations, Jesus is shown inappropriately dressed for the sport, such as attempting to kick a football in sandals, or perform ballet in an ancient Hebrew shift. By choosing not to wear kneepads or safety helmet when rollerblading, Our Lord is setting a poor example to today's youth with His reckless behaviour. In many of the scenes, He only seems to be participating in the sport half-heartedly, just standing around with His arms posed in what He thinks is some kind of benevolent attitude. It's all a bit wishy-washy and unsportsgodlike. As for the golf statue, should He not be mindful of the traumas the Roman Catholic church has undergone in recent years due to the antics of its less salubrious priests? Yours in Christ, Pansy Cradledew.\n\nHaving reviewed the site, and looked more carefully at some of the statues, I think Pansy has a point.

I ran into my house (The Dobson Compound) to fetch a camera, intending to take a snapshot to add to my album of over seventeen badger photographs.

Under his mother's influence, George became fretful and aghast at the proposal, and--as Walpole wrote--he \"declares violently against being bewolfenbuttled\".

{"prompt": "A Postcard From The Last Century\n", "completion": " In 1982 I spent much of my time making postcards, which I sold for a pittance to eager punters from what would now be called a pop-up stall in Norwich. Below is an example of the sort of thing I was doing.\nThe source material for both words and images was a huge pile of National Geographic magazines from the 1950s and 1960s acquired from various second-hand bookshops. To create the captions I employed a cut-up technique akin to that used by William S Burroughs and David Bowie, but far more amusingly than either of them ever did, particularly the former, a tedious gun-toting drug-addled uxoricide.\nYounger readers may find it difficult to fathom, but in Norwich in 1982 it was well nigh impossible to find an affordable colour photocopying facility. I thus sent my originals to my friend Peter Ross in London, and Peter organised the copying and sent me the results by post. I then employed scissors and glue to mount the hysterically funny images on to card, ready for sale to East Anglians.\nI think Peter is still in possession of most of the original artwork, but this one came to light the other day. The captions read as follows:\nUndimmed by Death\nWho were they?\nIn this convivial land, trendy youngsters like Walter And Jorg searched the ground for clues.\nWalter and Jorg are each identified by separate name captions.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Potted Biographies of a Marine Hue, No. 1\n", "completion": " Captain Flask, of the HMS Corrugated Cardboard, was a bad and dangerous man. He never washed his hair, and he was fond of tormenting badgers. His ship was falling apart, because whenever any of his miserable crew tried to repair something, like the rigging, or a fo'c'sle, or even the whole orlop deck, he would fly into a rage like something out of the Old Testament, and the crew would be cowed, and go back below decks to their scrimshaw and grog.\nEvery day, all day, and every night, all night, Captain Flask lurched around the deck, shouting at the sky. In the pocket of his weskit, where his fob watch ought to have been, he kept a supply of tin baubles, and he would throw these at any birds that came within his range, particularly guillemots, which he loathed, and cormorants, which he did not understand, but his aim was not good, and he usually missed.One of his arms was withered from scrofula.\nHis fob watch lay, abandoned, in the untidy drawer of his escritoire, hidden among old pencils, bits of calico, drawing pins, bottle tops, cornflakes and dust. Every morning at six o' clock, or whatever that is in maritime parlance, Captain Flask drank a whole pint of milk of magnesia.\nOh, he was such a bad man! Such a dangerous man!\n###"}

At a time when the press is full of stories of people living on credit and building up massive debt, Burton reminds us how they used to deal with these things:\nAt Padua in Italy they have a stone called the stone of turpitude, near the senate-house, where spendthrifts, and such as disclaim non-payment of debts, do sit with their hinder parts bare, that by that note of disgrace others may be terrified from all such vain expense, or borrowing more than they can tell how to pay.

If you stand quite still, and shut your eyes, and wait for, say, five minutes before opening them, when you do you will find yourself in an utterly different terrain. When you were not looking, the sands shifted, and now all is strange and bewildering.\nOn the beach at Shifting, a lovely little seaside town in Hoonshire, it is common to see people standing stock still with their eyes shut. It is common, too, to see looks of disappointment, even devastation, cross their faces, when they open their eyes to find the beach unchanged from how it was five minutes before. This is because the sands at Shifting Sands are not shifting sands. They are what are known as inert sands, roughly speaking. What shifting occurs, occasioned by the wind and the tides, is slow and imperceptible.\nWhat they do have at Shifting Sands are perilous pockets of quicksand. Beware! Best not even to think about those pockets, for if you do, you will sink into the quicksand of your thought, and you won't have the power anymore.\n###"}

What it was doing there is anybody's guess. Dobson is known to have had various altercations with the janitor of the factory, one Joost Van Dongelbracke, who later became famous--or infamous--as the \"Suburban Shaman\", founder of a cult which gained an incredible four million adherents across Europe and North America in the 1970s before imploding in ghastly circumstances.

{"prompt": "The Ant-Lion\n", "completion": " \"An interesting, though rather detestable, creature called the ant-lion is found in some of the bestiaries of the Middle Ages... The ant-lion was so called because of its size, since 'while to other animals it is only an ant, to ants themselves it is as if it were a lion'.\n\"As an instance of the implicit credulity of the Middle Ages witness this account of the ant-lion given in the Physiologus. This states that the ant-lion's father was shaped like a lion and his mother like an ant. The father was a flesh-eater; its mother herbivorous. When these two had issue, this was the ant-lion, partaking of the features of its parents, its forepart being that of a lion and its hindquarters like an ant. Being thus composed the wretched insect could neither eat flesh like its father nor herbs like its mother, and so it starved to death!\"\nColin Clair, Unnatural History : An Illustrated Bestiary (1967).

{"prompt": "Buying An Island\n", "completion": " It was just as well that the Lemane plan had been abandoned, as Richard Bradley's efforts to buy the island for the crown had descended into farce. Stopping to purchase some goods to take upriver as 'dashes'--that is, gifts or bribes--he had been blackmailed by a local trader into buying far more merchandise than he had intended. Then he had been made to pay a large number of 'barrs', or small iron bars worth five shillings each, to local figures. Bradley paid barrs not only to such dignitaries as the 'King of Barra' and the 'master of Gillifree' but to two 'Key Keepers', the 'Tobabmanser of Jancacunda' and to the latter's retinue of fifty servants. The Tobabmanser was unable to conduct any negotiations without his 'singing Man' (who also required payment in barrs of course), and when the 'King of Lemain' arrived he also brought a large retinue of servants, including the requisite key keeper, singing man and principal marabout. The whole negotiations cost much more than Bradley had anticipated, and during the palaver, wilting in the West African rainforest, he sickened and died. Later, his brother Henry would proudly announce to Sydney that the island had been purchased, only to discover that he had laboured in vain as the government had abandoned the plan.\nfrom Emma Christopher, A Merciless Place : The Lost Story Of Britain's Convict Disaster In Africa (2011)\n###"}

So unlikely was this alliance that Waugh gave the apposite title In The Lion's Den to a 1978 book collecting fifty of his pieces. In the introduction, he described the imaginary New Statesman reader he was addressing:\nMy image of the New Statesman reader was that of a taut, slightly embittered female school-teacher, possibly in Coventry but certainly in one of the less well-favoured areas of the country, struggling valiantly against the inherited and environmental disabilities of her charges to preserve some quasi-theological Hope in the socialist future. She was a convinced atheist and a convinced progressive in sexual matters although her own experiences in that field had seldom been encouraging. In foreign affairs she was endlessly progressive but in home affairs subject to strange disciplinarian urges which might suddenly demand unspeakable punishments not only for racists, rapists and male chauvinists, but also for litter-louts, cigarette-smokers and males generally. She approved of homosexuality and unmarried mothers, disapproved of drink and drugs, approved of education, disapproved of anyone excelling in it, approved, rather nervously, of the working class in most of its manifestations except football hooliganism and represented, in fact, the only surviving bastion of middle class values.\n###"}

It was too much to bear.\nYet, rather than turning his twisted mental havoc upon Dick Van Dyke, the West Bromwich Albion-supporting anchorman began to plot vengeance against the very sea creatures which until now had fascinated him. In his mania, he decided to obliterate the largest sea creature he could obtain, to obliterate it in the most disgusting way, by eating it. And he decided to make of his revenge a festive occasion, by arranging his foul dinner to take place on the day when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.\nWhat demons swept through his maddened mind, to so finesse his unutterable act? Alas, no hint was given of his motives in the newspaper report which followed, in the cheaply-photocopied Weekly Cetacean News Roundup, under the headline A Whale's Christmas In Chiles.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Fishmongers' Prayer\n", "completion": " \"Oh Lord, through Thy infinite grace, shower my counter with bream and plaice\" is the opening couplet of the Fishmongers' Prayer. This has the distinction of being the longest prayer in the English language, which is why you will rarely hear it recited in full. Its length is due to the fact that, within the rolling cadences of its many, many verses, all known types of fish, both edible and inedible, are mentioned at least once. It was the work of a piscatorial monomaniac named Egbert Bock. He was not himself a practising fishmonger, nor indeed did he live in or even near a fishing port. He was a squat, scruffy little man whose ears were perplexingly shaped, inasmuch as they looked as if they had been stuck to his head upside down. His obsession with fish is thought to have been caused by a traumatic childhood incident involving several flounders. Nine times out of ten such happenstance will lead to a phobia, but in Bock's case it had precisely the opposite effect. Interestingly, when experiments were made upon his brain after his death, it was discovered that the areas devoted to fish and the mongering of fish were terrifically shrivelled. Some seaside vicars still include an abridged version of the Fishmongers' Prayer in their services. But not many.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Other Places, Other Names\n", "completion": " While we are on the subject of other worlds (or at least other places), it is worth remembering that Dobson once wrote a pamphlet entitled Netherlands, Holland, Dutch--What's That About? The opening lines provide a summary of its subject matter:\nWe call China China and its people Chinese. We call Finland Finland and its people Finns. We call Germany Germany and its people Germans. I could go on, but I won't. What I want to know is, why do we have two interchangeable names--the Netherlands and Holland--for the country whose inhabitants we call Dutch? Why don't we say Netherlanders or Hollanders? What's all that about?\nIt's a remarkable pamphlet, chiefly because Dobson, having posed an interesting linguistic question, blathers on for over forty pages trying desperately to conceal the fact that he has done no research whatsoever. He simply makes things up and veers off at tangents. One such tangent is Dobson's brief look at what other nationalities call themselves. For example, the Chinese call China Zhongguo, the Finns call Finland Suomi, and, most enticingly, Shqiperi is where Albanians live and breathe and have their being.\nThere are times when I foolishly try to emulate Dobson, and I must confess that, like him, I have not bothered to research this Netherlands--Holland--Dutch business either.

It seems to me that this is now far too familiar a charge, and that if we are going to delve into history to find sticks with which to beat the paper, some fresh snippet is long overdue. I was pleased, therefore, to find this anecdote about Lord Northcliffe, the founder of the Daily Mail, in Piers Brendon's Eminent Edwardians (1979):\nThe campaigner against the use of birds' feathers to decorate women's hats once wantonly struck down a seagull with his stick and beat it to death on the sand.\nIncidentally, Northcliffe seems to have had a thing about hats. In 1910, he issued a directive to his editorial staff:\nIt is about time men had a new hat. Why not offer PS100 for the best design for a new hat? There is at present only the silk hat, the pot-hat or bowler (what in America is called a Derby), the straw hat, the felt hat of various shapes (usually referred to as the Trilby--I do not know why) and the universal cap.

{"prompt": "A History of Starlings\n", "completion": " A third of the world's starling population lives in North America. The fact that possibly over a billion starlings roam the skies is due to one man, a rich New York drug manufacturer named Eugene Schieffelin, who in 1890 released eighty imported starlings in Central Park as part of his thoroughly sensible plan to introduce to the United States all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Those who do not love starlings see them as pests, and indeed it is not unknown for a hungry flock to devour twenty tons of potatoes, spread histoplasmosis, and make life difficult for bluebirds and woodpeckers. Attempts to reduce or scare off pesky starlings have included the use of artificial owls, radio broadcasts of the starlings' alarm call, Roman candles, and a mass publicity drive to encourage people to eat starling pie (with recipes).\n\nThis is what a starling looks like (side view).

Plunge the conger eel into the seething liquid in one easy, elegant, yet startling movement. Add a dash of ground pepper. Leave to simmer for 45 minutes.\nTransfer the boiled (or broiled) conger eel onto a platter. Open a medium-sized jar of sandwich paste and spoon the entire contents onto the eel. Use a butter knife to spread the paste so it coats pretty much the whole topside. Place under the grill and toast for ten minutes, or until the colour of Turbinado sugar.\nToss a few brazil nuts onto the platter, and serve.

I do not own such a set, but that may be a small mercy.

He used to get all het up that he was never invited to vote in those critics' polls of the best films of all time, and once held a candlelit vigil outside the British Film Institute as a protest. It is said that he was regularly arrested for impersonating Ray Milland at seaside resorts, though this is probably one of those stories that get bandied about by mischief makers. In all the millions of words he wrote, however, Dobson had almost nothing to say on the subject of cinema, save for a throwaway remark towards the end of his essay Six Types Of Snodgrass Implement, where he writes: \"without any doubt the greatest film of all time is Blue Demon Y Las Seductoras\".\n\n###"}

He was writing half a century ago, in 1963, about what we now call old-fashioned \"landlines\", but how right--and prescient--he was:\nCheap and easy systems of communication simply promote cheapness in what is communicated. If people have to pay 5/- for a telegram or take the trouble to write and post a letter, they think twice before they bother you at all. If they have a telephone, however, even the most trivial information takes on urgency. The telephone dispenses irrelevance like a tap which won't turn off; it is also a dangerous instrument of interference and even persecution; but like most other so-called amenities of modern life, the telephone is essential for dealing with complexities which the telephone itself has caused, and it is quick to assert its tyranny at the expense of those who, like myself, would ignore it.\n###"}

When it is thick enough for your iron spoon to stand up in it unsupported, tip the whole lot into a bowl and garnish with the horns of a goat or two, for added crunch.\nIn the past, entire Carpathian families lived off this soup for years on end. It is true that in some cases they suffered from nutritional... difficulties, and had many ructions with the Carpathian goat-herding community, but we live in a different age, and can put such unpleasantness behind us. There is no benefit whatsoever in reviving ancient Carpathian blood feuds, although of course to do so can enliven an otherwise dull week.\nIf you are worried by the prospect of a gang of Carpathian peasants hoving into view armed with flaming torches and pitchforks, call our helpline. Our staff have been fully--well, adequately--trained in Carpathian thick potato and sausage soup dispute resolution techniques, and will not hang up if they hear you screaming for mercy.\n###"}

I know not how other people's nerves are constructed; but one would imagine they must be made of very coarse materials, to stand the shock of such a horrid assault. It was, indeed, a compound of villainous smells, in which the most violent stinks, and the most powerful perfumes, contended for the mastery. Imagine to yourself a high exalted essence of mingled odours, arising from putrid gums, imposthumated lungs, sour flatulencies, rank arm-pits, sweating feet, running sores and issues, plasters, ointments, and embrocations, Hungary-water, spirit of lavender, asafoetida drops, musk, hartshorn, and sal volatile; besides a thousand frowsy steams, which I could not analyse.

It was like a League of Gentlemen version of Legoland. Each of the so called rides, which only functioned every hour or so, was attended by a humpbacked man with a limp. There was also a large shed containing a Wurlitzer collection where we managed to catch a concert performed by a slightly odd teenager. The whole place looked like it had been built in the 1960s and never updated. In fact it would not have surprised me if the whole thing had been brought over from Plovdiv. Don't know why I have told you this, except that it had a certain Hooting Yard quality about it. Sadly the place is closing down in September.\n###"}

Like Madame Rousseau, he had never learned to tell the time and rarely knew what day of the week it was. This was surprising for a man in his position, charged as he was with running the lower floors of the House. His bailiwick included the frightening rooms on the first floor, the whole of the ground floor, the cellars and underground passages (except for the secret ones), and various ill-defined sections of the grounds, possibly including the boneyards, the engine room, and the pointless hut.\nThe arrival of Aminadab dismayed him. He had not been told what on earth to do with this lopsided person, which meant he would have to seek instructions from Doctor Cack or one of his cronies. He could barely bring himself to speak to them, with their supercilious manners, spotless frock-coats, and knot-tying expertise. Blodgett's blood boiled. Without bothering to tell Aminadab where he was going, he shoved the trap for flying insect beings back in the kitchen drawer, slammed the door shut behind him, and headed off for Doctor Cack's headquarters.\n###"}

He entered, as usual, in vague semi-flight, as from something that was probably not a menace, but which it was as well to be on the safe side about. Becoming aware of me, he approached, again as usual, with an air of uncertainty not so much about who I was as about what I was, and of keeping a very open mind on the range of possible answers. Was I potassium nitrate, or next October twelvemonth, or Christianity, or a chess problem--perhaps involving a variation on the Falkbeer counter-gambit? When he reached me, he gave up the problem and toppled on to my feet like an elephant pierced by a bullet in some vital spot. Victor was, among other things, the reason why no dogs were allowed at the Green Man.

Elderly Hooting Yard readers will know that the title is taken from Alfred Wesley Wishart's A Short History Of Monks And Monasteries (1900), wherein we also learn--in the same brief quotation--that St Ursula had three heads. She is one of the very few Catholic saints to have more than  one head, a fact which becomes blindingly clear if you tot up the number of saints and then count the number of saints' heads. The two numbers almost match, but however many times you do the calculation you will always find slightly more saints' heads than saints.\nIn their girlhood, both of my sisters attended an Ursuline Convent School, and I asked them if the three-headed nature of their dedicatory saint had any decisive influence on the school's ethos.\n\"No,\" they said, \"Don't be such a nitwit.\"\nMy sisters have one head each.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Fuming Binder\n", "completion": " We have seen how a comment comparing one of his symphonies to a pimple made Binder fume. In truth, the composer was much given to fuming.

Nobody ever actually saw steam coming out of Binder's ears, but he was invariably portrayed thus by cartoonists and by the more scurrilous painters of his day. Binder was a favourite subject of portraitists of all stripes, because he had such an extraordinary head. Words cannot quite capture its phantasmal oddity. And yet he was deemed the most handsome of composers by his admirers of both sexes, who were legion. Queues used to form at his dressing-room door whenever he deigned to appear at a concert hall, conducting one of his own works and a squib by an inferior for contrast. Even when fawned over, Binder fumed. He could occasionally be placated by marzipan treats, but not very often.\n###"}

When I was about fifteen years old I wrote a dreadful surrealist(ish) play-of-sorts called The Shepherd Of Amsterdam. The text no longer survives, long ago consumed by fire or eaten by worms. Last night it returned to haunt me in my sleep. I was in charge of putting on a stage production of the work, due to begin in fifteen minutes in spite of the fact that no rehearsals had taken place and the actors were wholly unfamiliar with the play. Indeed, there was only the single copy of the text in my possession, which I belatedly thought to photocopy. I was heading to the library for that purpose when I was told that the soundtrack CD of the play--produced by a walrus-moustachioed impresario who, I was assured, was \"a big fan of Hooting Yard\"--featuring music by Verdi and Monteverdi, was ready, awaiting only the addition of the actors performing the words.\nThen I woke up.\n###"}

Realistic details are combined with a larger naivety about space that wouldn't be out of place in Dan Dare, and there are moments whose sheer weirdness compares with the work of proto-surrealist Raymond Roussel: when, for example, the insects [a breed of hyper-intelligent insects who buzz around like bees and give telepathic orders] show them black and white films of great moments in human history, and\n\"the bee-beetles who controlled the machine again pressed the lever; again the machine whirred and the words came, 'Music while you work', followed by the rumba.\"\nWheatley never attempted science fiction again.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Spangles Reference Library\n", "completion": " The reference library in Spangles, mentioned in today's instalment of the enthralling serial Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars, is, as far as I know, the only library in the world to hold a complete run of Dobson's short-lived periodical A Lantern In The Pit. The Lantern, as it was known, was a bold attempt to shed Dobsonian light on various intractable questions, chiefly of a philosophical bent. For some unknown reason, the pamphleteer-turned-journalist chose to compose most of the contents in a so-called ur-lingua of his own devising. He provided no translations, and all the papers relating to what he hoped would become a new universal language were destroyed in the Potato Building fire. We are left with seven fat issues of the magazine, densely packed with text which is--and, one assumes, will remain--devoid of meaning. Various cryptographers have at one time or another tried to crack Dobson's code, but most of them have given up when they discovered that no one would pay them. Here is a mercifully brief extract, from Volume 2, Number 1:\nAck spun dig hod bulk frag mint. Shog nit pan get hole tap pote. Rag snout cot bag hag ack ack tix. Nod goo pin pan sap tot foo.

Blodgett claimed to, and no one was confident enough of their own knowledge to challenge him.\nAminadab, having arrived at the House only hours before, was unaware that there was even a system in the first place. All he knew for certain was that he was slumped, queasy with exhaustion, on the floor of a larder stacked floor to ceiling with soup tins marked \"Number Three\". He had given up the quest for Euwige. Half his luggage had been abandoned somewhere back in an ill-lit corridor which stank of porridge, though there was no porridge to be found in it. He still had the other half of his belongings with him, and was rummaging frantically in one of his satchels for the bag of gob-stoppers he had packed at the start of his journey, three weeks ago.\nAs his trembling fingers lit at last upon the crumpled bag, he heard footsteps approaching. Lurching to his feet, he threw open the door of the larder in desperation. Had Euwige come to rescue him?\n###"}

This comprises, in reverse chronological order, every book Mr Key has read since the beginning of the current year of Our Lord, MMXI.

He was much impressed by the officer class...\n... a race apart, immune from arrest by the police, they could be tried only by their own courts of honour and, if found guilty of a disgraceful act, they were simply given a pistol with which to shoot themselves. The civilian population had been conditioned to regard them with abject veneration. Ladies, as well as men, when approaching one of them in a street, stepped off the pavement into the gutter to give them ample room to pass, which they accepted as their right and did not even acknowledge by the flicker of an eyelid.

During the Wimbledon tennis championships, I forget which game exactly though it may have been one of the men's semi-finals, during one of the breaks between sets, the BBC cameras drifted off to the surrounding scene, and showed a jetty by the river around which sunbathers sprawled. Also present was a swan, approached by a tiny tot who looked as if she was wanting to feed it a sandwich. The proximity of tot to swan led one of the commentary team to observe that, belying their elegance and grace, swans are of course savage and aggressive creatures. Whereupon fellow-commentator Tim Henman--whose surname suggests he knows a thing or two about birds, or at least about poultry--said (and I paraphrase from memory):\nWhenever you see a swan, someone always points out that they are capable of breaking your arm. Have you ever met anybody who's had their arm broken by a swan? I haven't.\nSadly, the cameras then returned to the tennis, and we were not treated to any further swan-talk from Hen-man.\n\nSwan upping in the last century\n###"}

About the year 1510, they were first manufactured in London, by Spaniards. Before that time both men and women in England commonly wore close, knitted, woollen caps. It is related, that when Charles the Second made his public entry into Rouen, in 1449, he wore a hat lined with red velvet, surmounted with a plume or tuft of feathers; from which entry, or at least during his reign, the use of hats and caps is to be dated.

{"prompt": "Lightning Rod News\n", "completion": " \nThe above graphic is not merely a sensible warning. Glyn Webster (for it is he) reminds us that during the American War of Independence there was quite a spat between Benjamin Franklin and King George III regarding the correct design of lightning rods. Franklin advocated the use of a sharpened end to the rod, which many English electricians of the time took issue with. Benjamin Wilson, a member of the Royal Court circle of George III, believed that the pointed rod actually elicited lightning strikes, and that rods with a rounded sphere were safer. Other English colleagues favoured the use of blunt-tipped rods. King George III's involvement in the dispute was politically motivated rather than having any scientific basis. As Franklin was one of the signatories to the 1776 American Declaration of Independence, the use of sharpened rods was seen to be an upstart Republican idea. Further fuel was added to the fire when the Purfleet powder magazine in outer London burnt down after a lightning strike, and the Franklin rods were blamed. The King ordered that all lightning rods throughout the empire were to have a cannon ball placed on the top of them, or be removed.\nYou can read more about this exciting dispute here. Meanwhile, if your enthusiasm for lightning rods remains unquenched, you really ought to read The Lightning-Rod Man by Herman Melville.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Victorian Ditch Trauma\n", "completion": " I have been much enjoying the Times Archive Blog recently. Old news can be so much more appealing than new news--that is, news--particularly when, as in this case which I belatedly bring to your attention, it features a postie toppling into a ditch, a scene that could come straight from a Hooting Yard story:\nAbout noon on Thursday as a labourer, in the employ of Mr Cooper, of Pyrford--a village about seven miles from Guildford--was passing through Pondfield, in the neighbourhood of his master's farm, he espied an object in the ditch, which attracted his attention. On examination the object, which was nearly covered with snow, turned out to be a man named Tappin, the messenger who delivers post letters in the outlying districts of which Pyrford and Wisley form part. Mr Cooper was at once communicated with, and he speedily arranged for the delivery of the letters, while with equal promptitude the messenger was assisted from his bed of snow, where he had been for some hours. Tappin's account is that he got into the drift and pitched headlong into the ditch, when he was too exhausted to extricate himself.\nAs the Times' archivist notes, how pleasing it is that the reporter assures us of the safe delivery of the post before mentioning the rescue of the hapless Tappin. I suspect strongly that, almost a century and a half after his ditch trauma, Postie Tappin may be resurrected as a Hooting Yard character.\n###"}

It is not clear if this is related to L'Oreal's light-reflecting booster technology, but I am sure it must be so.\nThe refrigerator alluded to in my postage was the one in Michael Tippett's kitchen which he called \"Bernard Levin\". I cannot help wondering if that model, too, had the most up to date sensation technology of its era. Again, I would like to think that was the case.\nI do not know what Tippett's fellow composer Peter Maxwell Davies calls his refrigerator, but no doubt it, too, is a state of the art model, crammed with electrocuted swans.\n###"}

{"prompt": "A Note On Rugs\n", "completion": " Apropos of crow and hare oracles, R., in a comment, takes me to task for being cavalier about the precise nature of the rug upon which one's cards are dealt and pebbles scattered, and asks for--or rather demands--a rug reading list. It pains me to suggest that such a request merely demonstrates R.'s lack of attunement with the esoteric spheres. It also reminds me that the old fraud G I Gurdjieff began life as a travelling rug salesman. As how could he not? For his trade is hidden in his name. Take the first three letters, reverse them, and voila!, \"Gur\" becomes \"Rug\". Thus we see how human destinies can, sometimes, be inscribed in our being.\nI think it no accident, either, that my correspondent R. shares an initial with the subset of floor covering types he is getting all worked up about. I do not use the phrase \"worked up\" lightly, for of course it reminds us of \"The Work\" about which Gurdjieff babbled and wrote for much of his preposterous life. I wonder if R. would be driving himself to the same level of hysteria had I recommended dealing the cards and scattering the pebbles upon a mat, or even upon linoleum.\nIn addition, may I advise R. to be careful what he wishes for? A cursory reading of the medical literature warns us against becoming fumous-brained about floor coverings such as rugs, mats, and especially carpets. Quite literally, that way madness lies!\n\n###"}

Although you might not think it, ornaments, however small, can and do get in your way. I remember one match that was entirely lost because of the presence of a gold curb bracelet with a small dangling chain attached. Putting up her hand to adjust a hairpin, the owner did not know that the chain had caught on to her fringe-net, and, bringing her hand down quickly, the fringe-net and most of the hairpins were dragged from her hair. The result was that the player, who might easily have left the court and fixed up her hair again firmly, adjusted it as best she could, her hair blowing about in all directions. In between every stroke she had to clutch wildly at stray portions that blew across her face and into her eyes. This diversion naturally upset her game, and I think that was the last time she wore a bracelet in court.\" -- Mrs Lambert Chambers, Lawn Tennis For Ladies (1910)\n###"}

This is more common than you might think. Often, when I roam the lanes of my bailiwick, I come upon similar scenes of wooden tinies being menaced by fiery serpents, and in a significant number of cases serpentine fundament-fire is seen to occur. For the serpent, the advantage of this is that when a public-spirited figure such as myself chances upon it and extinguishes the flames with a handy portable fire extinguisher, it does not gag or choke on the jet of exciting fire-suppressant foam, as invariably happens with mouth-sourced serpentine flames, but merely shrugs it off, inasmuch as a serpent can shrug, and slithers off on its merry way down the lane. Unfortunately, I have to say that the skittish wooden tinies whose imperilment I so selflessly avert tend to be an ungrateful lot, and it is rare indeed that I am even thanked, let alone given a reward.

{"prompt": "Bowra\n", "completion": " Last night I dreamed of Sir Maurice Bowra (1898--1971). When I awoke, this morning, I had to look him up to find out who he was. When I went to sleep last night, his was a name I knew, that I had come across here and there over the years, but I could not have said I knew anything about him.\nI learn, today, among other things, that he wrote : \"I expect to pass through this world but once and therefore if there is anybody that I want to kick in the crutch I had better kick them in the crutch now, for I do not expect to pass this way again.\"\nIn my dream Bowra was hanging about on the street wit a man named Henderson and a third party whose name was not divulged. Bowra had lank sandy hair and looked not unlike the actor David Warner. But in reality, he was \"built like a sandbag, ... short and square with no neck and possessed a huge bittern booming voice\". This is what he really looked like.\n\n###"}
{"prompt": "\"Now, if the tuning hammer is placed...\"\n", "completion": " \"Now, if the tuning hammer is placed upon the tuning pin with the handle straight upward, and it is pulled backward (from the tuner) just a little, before it is turned to the right, the tension will be increased somewhat before the pin is turned, as this motion, slight as it may seem, pulls the pin upward enough to draw the string through the upper bridge an infinitesimally small distance, but enough to be perceptible to the ear. Now if the hammer were removed, the tendency of the pin would be to yield to the pull of the string; but if the pin is turned enough to take up such amount of string as was pulled through the bridge, and, as it is turned, is allowed to yield downward toward the pull of the string, it will resume its balance and the string will stand at that pitch, provided it has been \"rendered\" properly over the bridges. We set forth these details that you may have a thorough understanding of what is meant by setting the pins, and while it is not always advisable to follow this method in tuning, there are some pianos that will stand more satisfactorily when treated in this way.\"--J Cree Fischer, Piano Tuning\n###"}

Months ago, he had filled it to the brim with goo. Some said the goo was the mashed-up remains of enemies Ahab slew. Within this noisome mash, fungi grew. Asked to account for his possession of both pail and contents, Ahab said \"I haven't got a clue\". One theorist proposed that Ahab was seeking to patent a new and revolutionary glue. Around his head, winged monsters flew. Ahab was beginning to resemble that legend, the Wandering Jew. He took his pail into a chapel and rested it upon a pew. There is much in the foregoing on which to chew. Not one word of it is true.\n###"}

'They should be strung up,' said Litsa Sarantou, a beekeeper. 'No,' added retired bank employee Nassos Kafezopoulos. 'They should be shot.'\nMax does not say that he has put aside all his current projects in order to write an opportunistic potboiler in which fearful Hellenic sprinters are pursued by a vigilante beekeeper armed with a rope and a noose, but I am sure he is just hiding his light under a bushel.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dobson's Cocoademon\n", "completion": " Ahoy there, Frank!, writes Tim Thurn, irritatingly, Are you sure you're not confusing Dobson's Cacodaemon with his Cocoademon? I recall reading somewhere that the titanic pamphleteer once unscrewed the lid from a jar of cocoa and unleashed a ferocious sprite which made his life a misery for about a week. Everywhere he went he found cocoa powder splattered in his path. Some of us wouldn't be too bothered by that. If it were me, I'd avail myself of a little plastic scoop, and scoop up the cocoa powder, because I truly love cocoa, and drink seven or eight mugs of it a day. But apparently Dobson wasn't so fond, and he was only unscrewing the lid from the jar as research for his pamphlet Notes Upon The Unscrewing Of Lids From Jars (out of print). He hadn't even bought the jar of cocoa, he was just wandering through the aisles in Hubermann's Food Hall hoping no one would spot what he was doing. I have never read that pamphlet, by the way, so is there any chance you could find a copy and transcribe it on your splendid website?\nDear Tim, replies Mr Key, Making up titles of spurious Dobson pamphlets is no way for a grown man to behave. I suggest you do something more useful with your life, such as projectile vomiting in the direction of Andy Burnham.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Chewism\n", "completion": " Chewism is the popular name for the fictional method pioneered by Marigold Chew (1955-1998). In her only book, Six Hundred And Six Stories, Chew demonstrated what she called \"interstitial prose\": she would take an existing composition (from a bewildering variety of sources) and insert her own text in between each and every sentence of the original material. Sometimes the results were startling: the poet Gervase Beerpint, in one of his all too rare critical essays, said that Chew's story based upon a chapter from George Bernard Shaw's \"nonage novel\" The Irrational Knot was \"as good as anything by Ayn Rand, and makes John Fowles read like a grumpy cod-mystic of limited talent\". (Inevitably, Beerpint received a grumpy letter from Fowles within days of the essay being published. Wisely, he cast it into a furnace.) As a special treat for Hooting Yard readers, we have gained permission to reprint one of Marigold Chew's uncollected stories, The Albatross, where her \"interstices\" appear within a short sketch of the same title by Augustus Earle which was included in The Book of Enterprise & Adventure; Being an Excitement to Reading for Young People (London, 1851).\n###"}

As R. remarks, it is \"disappointing that it's the extent of the nest, rather than the magnitude of a particular wasp, to which this headline refers\". I have read and reread the story, in the faint hope that R. misunderstood it and that there really is--or was--a 3ft wasp at large in Hampshire. It would make a terrific short story, wouldn't it? As Mrs Gubbins awoke one morning from uneasy dreams she found herself transformed in her bed into a gigantic wasp. Or has somebody already written something similar?\nElsewhere at the BBC, I heard--in the woozy world between sleep and wakefulness--something about squirrels with leprosy. This was a report on Farming Today on Radio 4, a show I have come to think of as Girly Farming Club.

He saw them eating their yams and pralines and playing their fiddles and dancing their jigs and guffawing over coarse jokes and beating one another to death with agricultural implements.

From right to left, according to the Water Swan Register, they are Nat, Olive, Popsy, Quetzalcoatl, Rex, Succubus, Totteridge, Ubuntu, Vincenzo, Whetstone, Xantippe, Yoko, and Blodwyn.\nThe fact that Blodywn's name is Blodwyn, rather than something beginning with Z, suggests that she may not be a self-tidying water swan, but rather an interloper. Such swans are commonly termed anomalous untidy water swan interlopers. There is no standard Register listing them, although volunteers who can devote a few hours per day to the compilation of such a Register are always welcome.

One recalls--with a jolt--that he was raised as a Quaker. One thinks of cold rage, bitterness, and \"expletives deleted\". Inevitably, one thinks of Watergate, and one considers that, thirty years after Nixon's resignation, -gate is the suffix-of-choice for lazy journalists writing about any and every political scandal. And one is thankful for that laziness, because it is so amusing to see how short a time it takes from the first stirrings of a scandal to the first appearance in print of the -gate word. Last year, for example, when the ex-Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith (\"the Quiet Man\") stood accused of misusing public funds to pay his wife, it took only about forty eight hours for the episode to be dubbed Betsygate.

She writes a stream of letters to Cardew complaining bitterly about the couple who have come to stay at the flat. They add to both her childcare responsibilities, leaving her to act as nursemaid to their pneumonia-wracked child while they go off gallivanting to swish parties, and to her financial problems, in that they never contribute a penny towards the housekeeping--this in spite (or more likely because) of what Stella describes as their exaggerated and unseemly preoccupation with money.

Figures such as Cecil Sharp and Percy Grainger and Bela Bartok were fond of traipsing the countryside jotting down the ululations of peasants, and my correspondents wonder if the tale of the duck and the devil and the farmer comes from such a source. Indeed it does. A Rustic Lesson was collected by Prudence Foxglove's cousin Sagacity Wolfbag, a tireless explorer of rustic byways.\nIt is exactly one hundred years since Sagacity published her anthology Filth & Muck & Fields Of Green, comprising thousands of pages of songs and ballads, lore and legend, recipes and remedies, proverbs, sayings and old saws, many if not all of them nonsensical. The bulk of the material in the book was gathered in one tiny rustic backwater, a dismal huddle of dilapidated huts in a field near the Blister Lane Bypass. Much of it seems to have been relayed to Sagacity Wolfbag by a single, particularly grubby peasant, who was probably in the throes of ergot-related hysteria, and who died babbling in a ditch shortly after the anthology was published.\nThanks to R. for alerting me to the existence of Sagacity Wolfbag.\n###"}

I was struck, when watching Danish television dramas such as Borgen and The Killing, by the immense politeness of the Danes. In both shows, the characters are forever saying \"Takk\" (\"Thank you\"), certainly more so than the average Brit or American would do. I am not familiar with real life in Denmark, but I assume that the writers of these series are making every effort to reproduce the actual speech of contemporary Danes.\nIn Game Of Thrones, by contrast, we are told by Ser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) that \"there is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki\". Given that the Dothraki are a savage and barbaric race whose idea of a square meal is to consume a whole horse-heart, raw, the absence of an expression of gratitude is not surprising.\nBut what is bothering me is this : when Danish dramas are shown on Dothraki television, how in heaven's name will the subtitle-writers cope with all those \"Takk\"s?\nIt is, to be sure, a proper quandary, if an idiotic one.\n\nThe Khaleesi eating a raw horse-heart for breakfast\n###"}

The other sailors pick him up and chuck him in the soup. By soup of course I mean the sea, the churning broiling sea. And the blighter eating bloaters, well in truth that man was me. I puked some more and then I swam until I reached the shore. It was a Continental shore o lumme guv, o lor'. Now I must eat mayonnaise and Continental sauces. But now at last I'm mindful of globalising forces. So give me sauce and condiments to accompany my bloaters, and I will explain all about socioeconomic motors, the engines of commerce and exchange and of all sorts of trades. Give me my breakfast bloaters and don't stint on mayonnaise!\n###"}

It is not always easy to satisfy such a longing, although of course it may not be a longing or a yearning, it may simply be a flash in the pan whim, one which will evaporate once you get out of bed and plunge your head into ice cold water. Indeed, by the time you sit down to your breakfast sausages, the very idea may seem absurd, and you can get on with your day untroubled by such thoughts. For some though, there can be a sense of desperation, an absolute need that must be assuaged. This can be a very debilitating condition.\nLuckily, help is at hand, if one is able to divert one's desires from the ex-Vice President to his boss, President Richard Milhous Nixon.

Each holds in his left hand a candle in a candlestick, at the same time grasping his right foot in his right hand. This position compels him to balance himself on his left knee. One of the candles is lighted; the other is not. The holders are required to light the unlighted candle from the lighted one. The conditions are simple enough, but one would hardly believe how often the performers will roll over on the floor before they succeed in lighting the candle.

{"prompt": "Uncake Day\n", "completion": " In some cultures, it is traditional for Uncake Day to take place shortly after Pancake Day. On Uncake Day, sacks of flour are hidden away behind wooden partitions, eggs remain uncounted and ignored in their nests and cartons, and milk from cows is used to make pap or slops for the benefit of bedridden invalids. No pan may be used for the making of a cake, on pain of excommunication from whichever faith one professes, or execution, by the severing of one's head or the ripping of one's heart, bloody and throbbing, from one's chest, depending on the savagery of that faith.\nIt has been said, by Clunk among others, that the savagery of a religious tradition is in direct correlation to its cake dogmas. Woolly-minded, cardigan-wearing followers of weedy milksop faiths will have few if any prohibitions on the eating of cake, including the pancake, that most panny of all cakes. Such vapid belief systems also use cake as a celebratory foodstuff at every opportunity, rather than acknowledging its numinous quality by restricting cakey joy to one or two days a year, as the barbaric and blood-drenched religions do.\nIn a certain light, when cooked just so, a pancake resembles a miniature edible sun.

{"prompt": "Tiny Bird Brains\n", "completion": " Despite having tiny pea-sized brains, birds may be more intelligent than we thought. Avian scientists have been studying crows, which are apparently able to carry out tasks involving food and twigs which would be beyond the wit of a human infant. They can also make elementary tools, like hooks, though why a crow, with its fierce lacerating talons, would need a hook is beyond me. The cleverest crow in the study, incidentally, was called Betty, which seems an unusual name for a crow. If I had a pet crow, which I do not, I would call it something like Cecilia, or Hortense, or perhaps Clytemnestra! But Betty was a New Caledonian crow, so perhaps that is pertinent.\nIn trying to explain why minuscule bird brains are able to wield such unexpected mental power, the scientists suggest that they may work in entirely different ways to the brains of mammals. Apprised of this, Pansy Cradledew has suggested that I could challenge Edward De Bono and Tony Buzan as a self-styled brain expert and churn out a series of books, with titles such as Think Like A Crow, Rewire Your Brain The Cormorant Way, and Storm Petrel Thought Patterns Made Easy.\n###"}

Forget about trying to solve them (that is a separate pleasure), just treat them as phrases cut loose from any context, in which case they can act as starting points for pieces of prose.\n\"Prince enters flat of major\" was one of the clues in yesterday's Guardian crossword, and I wrote a short piece inspired by it.\nPrince Fulgencio's entourage--all clanking armour and burnished golden helmets--gathered in the corridor outside the dingy flat wherein Major Blenkinsop lurked. The brevet captain of the entourage rapped on the door, thrice, before the more brutish and sullen members of the entourage kicked it down and stomped into the flat, roaring their heads off and unleashing a flock of half-starved starlings to sow havoc and confusion. Thus was the necessary atmosphere created for Prince Fulgencio's entrance. He had come to have breakfast with the Major, and wanted to eat his cornflakes and doughballs while watching starlings peck the wallpaper off the walls.

When I mention to people that I am considering a change, I am almost invariably met with gasps of horror, as if by dumping the eerie lullaby in favour of something else I would be doing violence to a well-loved national institution, much as if I were to throw pebbles at Stephen Fry.

They were, in fact, of the class most disliked by my guardian, mostly prosperous shopkeepers, with a sprinkling of teachers, whom he also didn't like. It fairly pleased him not to like anyone in the camp except a certain scoutmaster. This was the quintessence of scoutmasters, and I feel certain he came from Roehampton, because of a particular greenhouse wildness in his appearance (I caught him acquiring a tropical tan artfully behind a bush once).

He wrote his sci-fi under the pseudonym \"Cordwainer Smith\". Disappointingly \"Paul 'Forest of Incandescent Bliss' Linebarger\" never appeared on book covers because he had a respectable day job devising pyschological warfare techniques for the American army:\n\"While in Korea, Linebarger masterminded the surrender of thousands of Chinese troops who considered it shameful to give up their arms. He drafted leaflets explaining how the soldiers could surrender by shouting the Chinese words for love, duty, humanity, and virtue--words that happened, when pronounced in that order, to sound like I surrender in English. He considered this act to be the single most worthwhile thing he had done in his life.\"\n\"The Forest of Incandescent Bliss\" is a marvellous nickname, almost on a par with the title adopted by ex-President Mbuto of Zaire, who, in the 1970s, dubbed himself \"The All-Powerful Warrior Who Because Of Endurance And An Inflexible Will To Win, Will Go From Conquest To Conquest Leaving Fire In His Wake\".\n###"}

I brought it inside and fashioned a splint with some hairpins and elastic bands. It is called Agamemnon. Saturday. My \"minders\" are a terrific bunch. They have taken to wearing ribbons in their filthy hair and chewing cheroots. This afternoon there was a short gun battle with some police officers. We won. Sunday. By happenstance, one of my gang is a priest, so we were able to celebrate Mass. For the sacrament, we used what was left of a stolen packet of croissants. A tin mug of duckpond water had to do instead of wine. Monday. I have been passing the time by reading a stash of old Dobson pamphlets. I was particularly taken with Two Hundred And Two Spurious Latin Names For Birds Together With A Meditation Upon A Sheet Of Corrugated Cardboard. I read it out to [X], one of the minders, and he has started to translate it into Tagalog. Tuesday. Peewits on roof.\n###"}

{"prompt": "The Nylon Duke\n", "completion": " Behold the Nylon Duke. He is fashioned entirely from nylon, every last bit of him, yea, even unto his cartilages. He is a nylon wonder of the world.\nThe Nylon Duke is pulled along, flat on his back, on a cart, by a great grey drayhorse with its bright and battering sandal, from village to village. At each stop along the way, in villages leafy or otherwise, he is hoisted upright by a system of winches and pulleys. The villagers gather and gasp and gawp at the sight of the Nylon Duke. They bring offerings of potatoes and similar root vegetables, piled high on the cart before being transferred into sacks by the Nylon Duke's attendants. These attendants are not made of nylon.\nElsewhere, there is a Nylon Duchess, and there may be a Nylon Dauphin, and there are even rumours of a Nylon Dunce. But in this land there are not enough great grey drayhorses to pull them on carts around villages. A Dearth Of Drayhorses is an oft-reprinted tract which goes some way to explaining this situation.\nConsider the Nylon Duke in the round, in all his pomp and finery and nylonosity. Would you begrudge him your potatoes? Think hard before you answer, for fig eider remprent, scou binder ad fig, as it is written, as it is engraved, as it is tattooed upon the foreheads of the attendants.\nThe Nylon Duke's given name is Bob.\n###"}
{"prompt": "For Want Of Fitting Audience\n", "completion": " \"Nearly every Roman indeed had qualified himself before he was fifty to be a candidate for the Travellers' Club; and sometimes the fine gentleman, who declined taking an active part in public affairs, found himself unexpectedly a thousand miles from home, with an imperial rescript in his portmanteau enjoining him not to return to Rome without special leave.\n\"To such a compulsory journey was the poet Ovid condemned, apparently for his very particular attentions to the Princess Julia. His exile was a piece of ingenious cruelty. He was sent to Tomi, which was far beyond the range of all fashionable bathing-places. The climate was atrocious; the neighbourhood was worse; the wine was execrable and was often hard frozen, and eaten like a lozenge, and his only society was that of the barracks, or a few rich but unpolished corn-factors, who speculated in grain and deals on the shores of the Euxine. To write verses from morn to dewy eve was the unfortunate poet's only solace; and he sent so many reams of elegies to Rome, that his friends came at last to vote him a bore, and he was reduced, for want of fitting audience, to learn the Getic language, and read his lacrymose couplets to circles of gaping barbarians.\"\nWilliam Bodham Donne, Old Roads And New Roads (1852)\n###"}

The sun was always shining, the weather was always balmy, and the other animals in the meadow--birds and insects and burrowing moles--were happy and contented. Of course it was a completely artificial and unnatural meadow, quite unlike real nature, which is bloody and gruesome and utterly horrifying, full of violence and pain and death. Just ask a sheep. Sheep know. That is why they barely get a wink of sleep, they are so frightened and fretful.\nAnyway, tinies, one day Popsy the Pony was having a lovely time in the lovely meadow when, all of a sudden, this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion of reality ... no, let me rephrase that ... this pastoral idyll was shattered by the intrusion of the hidden, Lovecraftian, true reality beyond our puny human comprehension, and Popsy the Pony was slobberingly devoured by an enormous squid from the Black Pit of Hellish Nothingness.

The mole was called Hortense and she was extremely glamorous. She wore a sort of mole version of a cloche hat, but there was nothing remotely human about her. She was just a mole, albeit one so glamorous that other moles swooned in her presence. Have you ever seen a mole swoon? It is quite a sight, and you will do well to have your camera at the ready.

Examining legal proceedings taken against \"snails, flies, mice, moles, ants, caterpillars, &c.\", Baring-Gould gives us the precise wording recommended when one wishes to excommunicate such vile creatures. This was drawn up by Bartholomew de Chasseneux, \"a noted lawyer of the sixteenth century\". Please note that you should always bring your case against creepy-crawlies and vermin before the ecclesiastical rather than the civil courts.\nThe correct form of excommunication is as follows: \"O snails, caterpillars, and other obscene creatures, which destroy the food of our neighbours, depart hence! Leave these cantons which you are devastating, and take refuge in those localities where you can injure no one. I.N.P., &c.\"\nIt is unclear to me whether that \"&c.\" indicates simply the reading of the Lord's Prayer--\"I.N.P.\" standing for \"In Nomine Patris\"--or whether there are further animadversions and anathemas to follow. In the absence of any clear guidance I suppose you shall have to get the presiding excommunicator to improvise.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Water-Parties\n", "completion": " There are many ways of arranging a water-party at yachting stations and at all riverside places. At yachting stations, for instance, a sailing yacht is hired to convey a party of from eighteen to twenty-five to some point of interest on the coast, in which case luncheon and tea are provided at an hotel in the vicinity of the place where the party have landed, and the expenses are equally divided. Not unfrequently, on the return journey, the yacht is becalmed, and does not reach its destination until between two and three the following morning. If it happens to be a fine moonlight night, this prolongation of a water-party is an additional source of enjoyment; but if there is no moon as well as no wind, and the calm betokens a storm, it is the reverse of pleasant. But these little contretemps, when they do occur, rather lend a zest to the day's pleasure, and are something to talk about afterwards.\nfrom Manners And Rules Of Good Society, Or Solecisms To Be Avoided by A Member Of The Aristocracy (1916)\n###"}

Yet such were the constraints imposed by society on what was deemed seemly, Tiny Enid oftbetimes made great pretence of being a helpless weedy flibbertigibbety waif, ready to swoon away or throw a fit of the vapours. Sometimes she put on such a show even while performing one of her brave deeds. In this picture, for example, it looks as if Tiny Enid is about to topple from a hot air balloon basket, and is being saved by a pair of tender-hearted ruffians.

{"prompt": "At a Hop\n", "completion": " After clambering out of the bog, Blodgett went to a hop. It was free of ghosts. Blodgett danced a hoocha with a bewitching floozie. She literally bewitched him, using her turquoise earring magnets. For the next three weeks, Blodgett was under her spell. She took him to the harbour and put him on a boat. It was a steam packet. They went on a voyage north, until they encountered pack ice. The bewitching floozie was skilled in the mariner's arts, but even she pooh-poohed pack ice. They turned back and sailed for home and the hop. Blodgett in his entrancement had been commanded to keep the ship's log, and as they came into harbour the floozie snatched it from his hands and with a twist of one turquoise earring magnet she released him from her spell. They walked arm in arm from the harbour to the hop and danced the night away. Blodgett remembered nothing. He was astonished, years later, passing through the town near the bog, to find in a chandlery bargain bin the ship's log, in his distinctive curlicued handwriting. He bought it and took it home and put it on his mantelpiece, where gathering dust was a fading snapshot of the floozie, in her cloche hat and turquoise earrings.\n###"}

Such an existence of shadow is not without charm; nor, I think, could many minds be steadily subjected to its conditions without elevation, deepened awe. To travel alone with the Primordial cannot but be solemn. The moon is of the hue of the glow-worm; and Night of the sepulchre. Nux bore not less Thanatos than Hupnos, and the bitter tears of Isis redundulate to a flood. At three, if a cab rolls by, the sound has the augustness of thunder. Once, at two, near a corner, I came upon a priest, seated, dead, leering, his legs bent. One arm, supported on a knee, pointed with rigid accusing forefinger obliquely upward. By exact observation, I found that he indicated Betelgeux, the star \"a\" which shoulders the wet sword of Orion. He was hideously swollen, having perished of dropsy. Thus in all Supremes is a grotesquerie; and one of the sons of Night is--Buffo.\"\nM P Shiel, Xelucha (1896)\n###"}
{"prompt": "Correspondence Received\n", "completion": " Sir,: Idly scanning your website today I couldn't help noticing the similarity between the parlour game Costner! (see below, 2nd January), and the ancient East Anglian game of Tull!, which helped me pass many a cold Norwich evening back at the start of the 1980s. They appear to be alike in many respects, except for the fact that Tull! contestants would have no use for such phrases as \"Field of Dreams\" or \"Table for Five\", since the object of the game was to torment one's opponent beyond the point of exhaustion with old Jethro Tull album titles. A typical opening gambit might be, \"Heavy Horses\", prompting the reply \"Songs from the Wood\". \"Minstrel in the Gallery\" would very likely follow, then maybe \"Thick as a Brick\" or \"Too Old To Rock n Roll, Too Young To Die\", until, as with Costner!, someone would inevitably play the trump card: in this case, \"Aqualung\". Whoever managed to dredge up the most examples of codpiece-wearing, standing-on-one-leg-style flute-infested tomfoolery was declared the winner. Indeed, perhaps the two games are more closely connected than previously imagined, since Ian Anderson of the Tull was renowned for his \"interesting\" stage gear of medieval tights and pointy boots--an outfit later modelled to no good effect by our Kevin in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.\nI beg to remain, etc etc,\n  Max Decharne\n###"}

She never made clear the purpose of her scheme, nor indeed its results. She died in the Munich Air Disaster, puzzlingly, for no one ever discovered what connection she had with the Busby Babes, and her replacement as head librarian quietly dropped the clown business. One Tuesday morning in March 1958, she tricked all the staff into thinking they were going on a charabanc outing, and once they were all aboard, she persuaded the driver to take them to a big top erected on a piece of land reserved for government nerve gas tests.

In view of possibilities so dreadful, surely it is a duty that a man owes to his kind to disseminate the truth, if he can, about the present condition of that reptile which, crawling on its belly and eating dust and having its head bruised by the descendants of Eve, sometimes pays off her share of the curse on their heels.\" -- E H Aitken, Concerning Animals & Other Matters\n###"}

It's just that we're discriminating in what we pay attention to. Today, for example, we celebrate the double birthday of not just one of the finest male voice icons in twentieth century cinema, but two.\nChristopher Plummer is 77 today, and decades have passed since his bizarre, strangulated, bird-like squawkings as Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt Of The Sun. I have spent hours upon hours trawling the internet to find out if a Plummermaniac has posted sound samples from the film, but to no avail. Happy birthday, Atahualpa.\nBorn on the same day two years before Plummer was Dick Van Dyke, the man who invented cockney, or possibly mockney, or whatever that accent was that he used to such powerful effect in Mary Poppins. Chim chim cheroo indeed. One little-known fact about Dick, possibly because it is entirely spurious, is that he signed a multibillion dollar deal to allow his initials to be used by the manufacturers of DVD technology. At one point, the now-ubiquitous discs were going to be called EVDs, because Chariots Of The Gods? author and wag Erich Von Daniken was asking for less money for his initials.

Millin began his apparently suicidal serenade immediately upon jumping from the ramp of the landing craft into the icy water. As the Cameron tartan of his kilt floated to the surface he struck up with Hieland Laddie. He continued even as the man behind him was hit, dropped into the sea and sank. Once ashore Millin did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes...\n\"[Later...] Millin was surprised not to have been shot, and he mentioned this to some Germans who had been taken prisoner.

But what if he had? What then?\nWe might write a thumping fat biography of the middling Pitt, middling in stature, middling in importance, fair to middling in his accomplishments. This biography we could make up from whole cloth or, if we preferred, we could cobble it together from snatches from the true biographies of the other Pitts, the Elder and the Younger, and, casting further afield, from the biographies of any number of not-Pitts, contemporaries, coevals, and peers. Judiciously constructed, such a book might tell us more, much more, about the world and the age of the Pitts than any existing biography of either one of them or of any of the many not-Pitts whose lives we would gut to tell of the Middling Pitt.\nOur Pitt would be a sort of invisible man, one whose presence, however vivid, is nowhere attested in the available historical record. An invisible man and also a Frankenstein's monster, into whom we breathe the spark of life. Vampire too, for never having really lived, he can never really die.

{"prompt": "Onions, Vulgarity, And Crime\n", "completion": " \"There is, one must admit, a certain association of vulgarity with the onion. It is a valuable food, and an indispensable accessory to the culinary artist; but as used by many people it is not suggestive of refinement. And yet the bulb has not only an honourable character--it has a sort of sacred history.\n\"Both Pliny and Juvenal, among old writers, and many Egyptologists of our own time and country, have recorded that the ancient Egyptians worshipped the onion. It is true that Wilkinson, who wrote on the Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, doubts the evidence of this; but he adds that the onion was admitted as a common offering on every altar, and that the priests were forbidden to eat it. In Ellis's History of Madagascar it is noted that the Malagasy of our time regard the onion as unclean, and forbidden by the idols.\"\nBut the onion can be a weapon in the fight against crime!\n\"Ovid... says that both onions and sulphur were given to criminals to purify them from their crimes, upon the old theory of purgation by fumigation.\"\nExtracts from Storyology : Essays In Folk-Lore, Sea-Lore, And Plant-Lore by Benjamin Taylor (1900)\n###"}

Were Mr Steiger still with us, I think I would write to him suggesting he play a character called The Unillustrated Chump. This would not be an adaptation of The Chump And The Flapper, the story in today's Dabbler, but a wholly different work, based on the boiling frustrations of a chump who, try as he might, cannot get his likeness depicted by a single illustrator.

'German cinema could not do without her now,' he declared. 'I set off on the most direct route to Paris, in full faith, believing that she would stay alive if I came on foot.' For three weeks he walked through rain and snow, without a proper map or winter clothing, trekking across muddy fields, following a straight line on his compass. 'It was like a pilgrimage,' he says. 'I would not allow her to die.' When he arrived at her bedside, Eisner was on the mend. 'Open the window,' he told her.

He is two and a half, and will be playing one of the Three Wise Men in his nursery nativity play. The part calls for him to deliver the line \"I have myrrh\".\nHe has been rehearsing with admirable diligence. It is, I think, a credit to his acting skills that, while one rarely, if ever, encounters myrrh in 21st century Britain, he gives a compelling performance and one truly believes that, yes, this small child does indeed have myrrh. And he has been able to inhabit fully the character of the Wise Man without having to ask the director \"what's my motivation?\".

{"prompt": "Gluten-free Jabbering Man\n", "completion": " I am Gluten-Free Jabbering Man, and I jabber in the corridors of power. Like a L'Oreal product, I am armed with light-reflecting booster technology. I use it wisely, and do not abuse the advantages it gives me. How easy it would be for me to take a Member of Parliament, like Lembit Opik, say, or Dawn Primarolo, and not only boost the light reflecting off them but jabber at them until they, too, are gluten-free. I could if I wished do the same with captains of industry, media moguls, big players in the world of sport, with anyone you care to mention who has even the tiniest smidgeon of power and influence in the world. I have often been tempted to wreak my weird magic on Lionel Richie, for example, and yet I restrain myself. Now, I just do the jabbering, a quiet sort of jabbering, and I jabber only at the little bugs and creepy-crawlies that scurry unnoticed in the corridors of power, unnoticed, that is, by all but me, and by the pest controllers, to whom I refrain from jabbering, for even with my light-reflecting booster technology I suspect they would outwit me with their fearsome engines of destruction, their sprays and rays and fumes and beams. I covet such weaponry, but it would be too dangerous in my hands, and in any case, I am the personification of mercy, and I am replete.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Dutch Gruel\n", "completion": " There has always been a pedagogical impulse throbbing at the heart of Hooting Yard, so I am delighted to report that our recipe for gruel is now being used as a set text. Students are directed to this \"rather elaborate recipe\" by the editors of Alquin, a site for students learning English as a foreign language. The assignment is as follows:\n\"Search the Internet for recipes for two of the following Victorian foodstuffs and translate the recipes into Dutch, in a way that you, or someone else, would easily be able to prepare the food. By presenting some Victorian food dishes, the actors who're in the play [an adaptation of Oliver Twist] might be even more motivated to act Victorian. Of course you could also feed them gruel, but that might not go down that well...\"\nThere follows a list of enticing grub including dumplings, black-cap pudding, 'good common cake', pickled mussels, and potted meat sandwiches. Links for each dish are provided for the students, ending with one to Hooting Yard, suggesting that they \"try to work out from this description what you need to do to make gruel\".\nMay I implore all readers, next time they find themselves eating out in the Netherlands, to order a bowl of gruel?\n\n###"}

Pins, litmus paper, zinc, gorse, pie-crusts... not even Euwige knew where Blodgett stashed everything, or how he disposed of it all.\nEuwige was relentless. She listened out for Blodgett, concealed behind parapets, shrubberies, false ceilings. She pried and spied without success. Then she questioned him directly. She tied him to a chair and shone a Toc H lamp into his eyes, puffing the smoke from her cheroot into his face. He coughed, but was otherwise uncommunicative. Later she tried wheedling and deedling, but that didn't work either. Blodgett remained wholly and uncannily silent.\nAnd still he accumulated tuning forks, dishcloths, cortisone and ironmongery, tin baths, cupcake mixture, the heads of oxen, and whisks, and still these things vanished, somehow, as if they had never existed in the first place.

{"prompt": "Remember, Remember, Re Dabbler\n", "completion": " \nIn my cupboard at The Dabbler this week, I have transcribed the words of a children's song appropriate for today's date.\nThe song is taken from a garish publication of the last century entitled Special Agent Rastus Blot's Traditional Songbook For Winsome Tinies. It was a piece of spectacular self-aggrandisement by Blot. Though the songs purport to be much-loved chants and ditties sung by billions of children around the world, they were all in fact devised by the Special Agent himself, and feature him in a starring role, carrying out deeds of daring and bravado. When I did some research into the matter, I discovered that not one tiny has been heard singing any of these songs, anywhere, ever.\nQuite frankly, if you are going to present an urchin with a book as a gift, I would give Special Agent Rastus Blot's farrago of nonsense a wide berth and buy Impugned By A Peasant & Other Stories instead.\n###"}

However, this time, instead of devising a bedtime story suitable for tiny tots, the challenge is to compose a poem worthy of our titanically talented Poet Laureate. To assist readers wishing to contribute verses or doggerel to a forthcoming Andrewmotionopoly Anthology, here are those adjectives in alphabetical order: airy, busy, clean-shaven, clever, energetic, handsome, inquisitive, interesting, light, little, mobile, perpetual, sarcastic, sharp, slight, special, thin. Seventeen adjectives in two sentences is quite a feat. Your poem, however, can be as long as you like, so long as you include all those adjectives, which must appear once and once only.

Some years ago when placing the shelves round the small room, which, by a euphemism, is called my library, I took the precaution of making two self-acting ventilators which communicated directly with the outer air just under the ceiling. For economy of space as well as of temper (for lamps of all kinds are sore trials), I had a gasalier of three lights over the table. The effect was to cause great heat in the upper regions, and in the course of a year or two the leather valance which hung from the window, as well as the fringe which dropped half-an-inch from each shelf to keep out the dust, was just like tinder, and in some parts actually fell to the ground by its own weight; while the backs of the books upon the top shelves were perished, and crumbled away when touched, being reduced to the consistency of Scotch snuff.

Is this a manufacturing compound where industrial funnels are brought into being, or is it rather an industrial manufacturing compound whose output happens to be funnels?\nLest I seem to be splitting hairs, I should perhaps add that the former instance might well be a case of two amiable widows occasionally meeting in, let's suppose, a disused pig-pen or similar compound where they desultorily pop a few more rivets into their long lives' work, a single immense funnel of statuesque and sturdy conception; whereas the latter case might imply a colossal foundry or other such satanic installation which churns out, in their tens of thousands, minute funnels of such a definitively non-industrial calibre that they buckle, or actually wither to dust, under the mere weight of the potential customer's scrutiny.\nR is quite right to draw attention to the ambiguity, and I am happy to clarify that the industrial funnel manufacturing compound to which I referred was indeed a disused pig-pen wherein two widows popped rivets into a single immense funnel.

To make up for such an inexplicable oversight, let me draw your attention to St Prisca, whose feast day is today.\n\n\nSt Prisca was a child martyr, and you can read all about her in The Book Of Saints And Friendly Beasts by Abbie Farwell Brown. You will learn how, \"Small and defenceless though she was, she did not fear to tell everyone what she believed and Whose Cross she followed. So she soon became known as a firm little Christian maiden.\" When you have read this stirring tale, and wept, yet felt strangely uplifted, I recommend some of the other stories you will find there, such as Saint Keneth [sic] Of The Gulls, Saint Launomar's Cow, Saint Fronto's Camels, and Saint Werburgh And Her Goose. That should be quite enough saints to keep you occupied and out of mischief.\nNOTE : It strikes me that St Prisca comes across as a Christian version of heroic infant Tiny Enid, many of whose exploits have been recorded here.

They are indeed beatniks. By allowing their goatee beards to grow into more flourishing hairiness, swapping their berets for those big weird hats, and shadowing the Metropolitan wherever he roams, the pair are engaging in a performance art intervention praxis. Dmitri and Serge (for it is they) are legendary cats on the Russian Orthodox beatnik scene, best known for their jazz, their existentialist pretensions, and their French cigarettes. They have been performing their praxis for the past year, seldom letting the beardy Smolenskian out of their sight, much as ex-UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar was pursued for years, and interrupted at press conferences, by nitwits convinced he had been abducted by aliens in Manhattan in 1989.\nDmitri and Serge are guarded about how long they intend to continue haunting Metropolitan Kirill. If asked, by art students and the like, they offer only dismissive guttural noises designed to be enigmatic.

{"prompt": "The Reverend And The Dandy\n", "completion": " Yesterday's crumbs of Babinskiana provoked an inundation of letters from female readers imploring me to post a picture of the Reverend John Chippendall Montesquieu Bellew, he of the head of hair like a great ball of spun white silk, so they could print it, cut it out, put it in a frame, and make it the centrepiece of a shrine at which they could adore him, as so many women did when he was--becomingly, remember--alive. I managed to track the Reverend down here, where you may note he is categorised not merely under \"cassock\", \"clergyman\" and \"Victorian\" but also \"arms crossed\" and \"keen eyed\". Et voila!\n\nNot to be outdone, a plethora of male readers beseeched me, similarly, to post a picture of Jules Amedee Barbey d'Aurevilly, the boulevard magnifico, of the gold-knobbed cane and hand-held mirror, no doubt so they could pick up some invaluable tips on personal grooming. As always, I am happy to oblige.\n\nPlease note that these pictures are of Bellew and Barbey d'Aurevilly themselves, not of the criminal lunatic Babinsky in disguise, first as one, emerging from a hovel, then as the other, prancing off a pier.\n###"}

Now, to ring the Bells, and call the People on purpose together, would be but a blunt business; but to do it neatly, and when no Body look'd for it, that's the rarity and art of it. Suppose, then, that he takes for his text that of St. Matthew, Repent ye, for the Kingdom of God is at hand. Now tell me, Sir, do you not perceive the Gold to be in a dismal fear, to curl and quiver at the first reading of these words. It must come in thus: The blotts and blurrs of our sins must be taken out by the Aqua-fortis of our Tears; to which Aqua-fortis if you put a fifth part of Sal-Amoniack, and set them in a gentle heat, it makes Aqua-Regia, which dissolves Gold. And now 'tis out. Wonderfull are the things that are to be done by the help of metaphors and similitudes! And I'll undertake, that with a little more pains and consideration, out of the very same words, he could have taught the People how to make Custards, Marmalade, or to stew Prunes.\"\nJohn Eachard, The Grounds And Occasions Of The Contempt Of The Clergy And Religion (1670)\n###"}

I had been issued with one of the new-style Anti-Social Behaviour Orders. Now I would have many long years to reflect upon the consequences of brazenly smoking a cigarette at a bus stop, past which an endless parade of vehicles belched noxious fumes. It was, as they say, a fair cop, guv. I readily placed my wrists into the manacles presented by the Community Patrol Invigilation Cadet as I lay sprawled in the gutter following a salutary Tasering. My week in a befouled hulk anchored off the seaside was an enormous help. I was able for the first time to acknowledge the depth of my criminality. I can say, without dissembling, that I positively enjoyed the sensation of being tossed out of an aeroplane and descending, with the aid of an automatically-opening parachute, which I have since ripped up for bedding linen, onto my atoll. For it is, now, very much my atoll, where I subsist upon molluscs and rainwater, and my rapidly dwindling carton of untipped full strength Paraguayan cigarettes.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Swammerdam\n", "completion": " Today is the 368th birthday of Jan Swammerdam, the Dutch scientist and pioneer of the microscope. His Bible of Nature, published on the centenary of his birth, contains hundreds of his drawings, mostly of insects. For all the painstaking observation, which today we may see as cold and unemotional, Swammerdam had a highly wrought mystical attitude to nature, and in 1875 he abandoned science for a life of religious contemplation. His book on the mayfly is filled with spiritual verses and musings, as well as his magnificent drawings, like this one.\nWhile finding out more about Swammerdam, I chanced upon the marvellous Origins Of Modernity online exhibition, wherein will be found many old book illustrations on topics including alchemy & chemistry, cosmology & astronomy, literature, mathematics, natural history, natural philosophy, philosophy, physiology & medicine, political philosophy, theology & witchcraft, and travel literature.\nThe picture below is a detail from Thomas Burnet's Telluris theoria sacra.

A plenary session of the Hooting Yard Miscellaneous Matters Of Towering Importance Committee was convened to address the issue. It was swiftly agreed that a name for the post-Pansy day should be in some way related to \"boxing\", but frantic arguments raged for minutes whether the allusion was to packaging or fighting. Some members of the committee wanted to plump immediately for Wrestling Day. They were silenced when member F X Duggleby provided unassailable evidence that the \"boxing\" referred to boxes, and had not a jot nor tittle to do with contact sports.\nThis point decided, the committee went into recess, and partook of a superb lunch of shredded watercress and boiled duckpond water, then engaged in post-prandial calisthenics (think trampolines and medicine balls). Brain scans completed, the committee members shuffled back into the Big Overwhelming Hall, with its gleaming linoleum, important-looking wallpaper, and empty birdcages.\nThe afternoon session reviewed a wide variety of boxes and packaging materials, and eventually voted between two options: Big Unwieldy Crate Day or Jiffy(tm) Bag Day.

Well, it seems I was mistaken. I was rummaging in a satchel that I found abandoned on a canal towpath, and I came upon indisputable evidence that at least one sensible person admired a Dobson song so much that they recorded a cover version of it. The song in question is one of the pamphleteer's settings from the Book of Isaiah.\nHooting Yard readers are a wise bunch, and I would not be surprised to be deluged with letters accusing me of making up the whole satchel-rummaging incident in some foolhardy attempt to chivvy up Dobson's reputation.

He had a metal plate in his skull, following a childhood picnic-hamper incident. He was mildly lantern-jawed. Whenever he wrote about being lantern-jawed, or about lanterns, Crestfallen Dan invariably used the archaic spelling, viz. \"lanthorn\". He often had occasion to write the word because, shunning human company, he lived alone and ran a lighting-fixture advice service by post. He spent a fortune on postage stamps! Crestfallen Dan did not possess a telephone, but if he had done so it would have availed him not, because there was no telephone pole within miles upon miles of his nondescript hut. He had only a handful of correspondents, or customers, but they were exceedingly loyal to him, for Crestfallen Dan knew more about lighting-fixtures than anyone else, ever, alive or dead, and his advice was always couched in clear and simple language that even a splinterbrain could understand. Crestfallen Dan himself lit his hut with the aid of a single Tilly lamp. He was that kind of man.\nSource : Worlds Beyond Sense by Dobson (out of print)\n###"}

As the incidents leading to Miss Fornario's death did not take place until some eighteen months after Moina's own, the charge is scarcely worth refuting. Even if the latter had been living, the scratches found on the corpse are less likely to have resulted from an attack by Moina in the form of a monster cat, than from running naked in the dark over rough country, which Miss Fornario had done immediately before her collapse.\"\nIthell Colquhoun, Sword Of Wisdom : MacGregor Mathers And 'The Golden Dawn' (1975)\n###"}

The temperature plummeted. Rain turned to hail, assailing with ten thousand merciless pin-pricks the pathetic figure of a man trudging through the streets of Helsinki dressed only in shirt-sleeves and boxer shorts. The man was the notorious forger, quack and charlatan Inigo Hoist. Moments before, he had been denuded of the rest of his clothing and ejected from the hovel of his concubine, who had taken exception to the odour on his breath of sour custard and hibiscus. Hoist managed to reach his doctor's surgery without being crushed by a felled sycamore. He hammered on the door, wailing desperately. At long last Doctor Calicagcag drew back the fourteen bolts on his door and let Hoist in. The good doctor was wearing a rhinoceros mask of beaten bronze.

I wonder if their ranks have been infiltrated by a Dobsonist? Apparently, there is a forthcoming series called Strictly Pamphleteering, in which contestants will write pamphlets and declaim them on live television. Week by week, the panel of judges and the public will vote out the most hopeless would-be pamphleteer, until at the end of the series, the winner is crowned Strictly Pamphleteering Pamphleteer Of The Year.\nNo details have yet emerged of who will be on the judging panel, though names such as Dale Winton, Yoko Ono, V S Naipaul and Leo Sayer have been touted. The panel will also decide on each week's pamphlet topic, with subjects ranging from ospreys to goat husbandry to the astronomical innovations of Tycho Brahe. We can be sure that the eventual winner will have shown a splendid ability to declaim mighty pamphleteering prose about pretty much anything under the sun. Could this show bring us a 21st century Dobson? I live in hope.\n###"}

Half an hour later he detected a black speck ahead. Soon we knew this could not be a natural snow feature. We marched on, found that it was a black flag tied to a sledge bearer; near by the remains of a camp; sledge tracks and ski tracks going and coming and the clear trace of dogs; paws--many dogs. This told us the whole story. The Norwegians have forestalled us and are first at the Pole. It is a terrible disappointment, and I am very sorry for my loyal companions. Many thoughts come and much discussion have we had. Tomorrow we must march on to the Pole and then hasten home with all the speed we can compass.

{"prompt": "Splendidly Useful Definition\n", "completion": " Regular readers will have gathered that the bulk of the prose in Hooting Yard is the result of many, many hours of painstaking research. Before writing Pipistrelle Pursuivant, for example--see below, 25th June--I needed to know a lot more about heraldic bats than I did when I woke up that morning. Indeed, I had much to learn about bats, and even more about heraldry. To gain a precarious foothold in the latter, one of my sources was Pimbley's Dictionary of Heraldry. I must say, having read it in full, that this is the very model of what a dictionary can be. Seldom have I found such a rigorous approach to the act of definition. Pimbley's are clear, succinct, and remarkable. Take this, as just one example: there you are, thumbing through your heraldic dictionary, wanting--even needing--to know what is meant by the phrase 'Barry bendy dexter and sinister'. Pimbley defines it as 'a combination of barry and bendy dexter and sinister'. Isn't that perfect?

A brief--but by no means complete--list would include:\nThe Munich Air Disaster; the Kennedy Assassination; Peter Maxwell Davies eating an accidentally-electrocuted whooper swan; the Hindenburg Disaster; Yoko Ono; Googie Withers; David Blunkett.\nI realise that my selection includes two aerial disasters, so that is a common thread, but otherwise none of them seem to link up in any coherent way. Are there some profound psychological reasons that cause you to harp on about these subjects, or are you just repeating yourself? And whichever is the case, can you give any clues as to how one might predict whether or not an event or a person might become embedded in your brain, and thus crop up time and time again in Hooting Yard?\nI suppose it would be polite of me to reply to these questions, so I will try at some point to frame a response, once I have finished making my set of Hazel Blears finger puppets.\n\n###"}

Laudable as his efforts are, several observers have noted that the world of classical music is too small and narrow to have real societal heft. Pop music, they say, is the lingua franca that can genuinely bring people of different faiths together. To this end, and as a faltering first step in resolving the simmering civil war between the two major branches of Islam, a new single has been released. It is a new version of \"I Got You Babe\" by Sunni and Shia.\n###"}

It was called Jeffrey.\nThis is something I am very, very glad to know, and I doubt that a Yuletide will pass in future without me mentioning it.\nBob Drake replied, saying \"That got me thinking. Would I rather be haunted by a badger's disembodied head, or a badger's headless body? I can only conclude that it would depend on the temperament of the partial apparition\", while Roland Clare picked up the echo of Jubilate Agno, and suggested: \"For I Will Consider My Headless Badger Jeffrey ...\"\nIt is my fond hope that Mr Drake will be inspired to write a song on the subject, and Mr Clare will essay a badgerised version of the pertinent section of Christopher Smart's poem.\n###"}

Set to a recording of prepared piano music by John Cage, the brief piece ended with the exhausted dancer lying in a heap as the stage darkened. When the lights came up, Kahn had disappeared, and VerEecke had taken her place in the same crumpled position. Rising from the floor, he cried out to God, ran around the periphery of the stage and pounded his fists against the rear wall. His cries of the heart were picked up and developed in lyrical movements by ten dancers who had learned the graceful choreography in VerEecke's workshop.\n\n###"}

All the fruits talk constantly and simultaneously, so it is extremely difficult to decipher a word any of them is saying, even if we understood their languages.\nAre any of them listening to each other, or are they just babbling, incoherently, oblivious to their fellow fruits?

They included Bring Forth, Devil, Your Moose, Bring Forth, Devil, Your Stormy Petrels, and Bring Forth, Devil, Your Common House Flies. Unlike the Finnish volume, none of Dobson's works ever saw the light of day, for he abandoned the writing of them when it was pointed out to him that he could make more money by churning out a potboiler about decorative cardigan buttons, a subject on which he was an acknowledged expert.\nUnfortunately, a glut of decorative cardigan button books appeared on the market just as Dobson was finishing his manuscript. His money-making scheme shattered, the pamphleteer was forced to take a job as janitor at an evaporated milk factory. As we now know, this experience was pivotal in his pamphleteering career.\nFurther Reading : \"Dobson's Pivotal Experience As A Janitor At An Evaporated Milk Factory\" by Petula Clark, in The Journal Of Evaporated Milk Studies, Vol XLVI, No 7 (out of print).\n###"}

For one thing, Mr Tuffley's location suggests he lives next to the sea, and thus may from time to time have seen, conversed with, or otherwise had traffick with mermaids. As far as I can ascertain, Mr Hartley is a Londoner, and thus is unlikely to be familiar with such semiaquatic beings, other than at those times they splash and cavort in the Thames.\nI note that Harriet Harman's latest Equalities Bill has not a jot to say about mermaids, and this may indeed have led to a justified sense of grievance, even of victimhood.

The rest of the crowd began to mutter excitedly. They had not thought to be so forward themselves.

{"prompt": "\"As a simple example, I will state...\"\n", "completion": " \"As a simple example, I will state that wild birds are caught by means of a sympathetic electricity. For this purpose a long, hollow metal tube is used, at the bottom of which is a globe containing a powerful acid. A receptacle at the top of the tube contains seeds much liked by the birds. They hover about these seeds, and, when they are within a certain distance, a slight pressure on a wooden spring causes a drop of the acid in the globe to escape into the tube, and so to set in movement a current of electricity, which, being very sympathetic to the bird, acts as an attractor so powerful, that it cannot get away. The tube is then gently lowered, and the birds are gradually drawn near to the earth, when a light net is thrown over the captives, and they are shaken into a cage-net at the bottom. Calmed by the electricity, they do not flutter or struggle when thus secured. It is very interesting to see the birds come nearer and nearer as the rod is lowered towards the ground. For electrical purposes it is necessary to catch the birds alive.\" -- Benjamin Lumley, Another World; or Fragments From The Star City Of Montalluyah\n###"}

Carlyle sat to G F Watts for his portrait, and Watts, as he often did in conversation with his sitters, began to talk of Pheidias. Carlyle advanced a criticism which no one else seems to have thought of. He contended that among all the sculptured beings which the genius of Pheidias had produced there was 'not one clever man'. With the long upper lip of Ecclefechan obstinately tightened he declared that a short upper lip showed an absence of intellect. He stuck to his point even when Watts cited Napoleon, Byron, and Goethe as evidence against him. He added that the jaw of the Greek was not sufficiently prominent. 'Depend upon it,' said Carlyle, 'neither God nor man can get on without a jaw.'

Had you had a bit of stamina and kept up regular production of the Official Journal of the Nisbet Spotting Society, those hapless enthusiasts would not, with the passing of time, have been quite so hapless. Yours indefatigably, Dr Ruth Pastry.\n\nDr Pastry is correct about the provenance of the emblem. If any reader has a copy of the magazine in question, perhaps they would be good enough to scan both front and back covers and send them to Mr Key. On the question of whether or not the \"odd being\" is indeed a nisbet, I think it best to reserve judgement until a panel of experts has been empanelled to consider the matter with due diligence.\n###"}

When he walked upon the orlop deck he sang in vulgar Latin, and every morning he made the sailors pray at Matins. The bo'sun had a voodoo doll pierced with many pins. But Captain Cake had a jacket made of tin, and he made the bo'sun walk the plank till he fell into the churning sea. All the sailors rollicked with glee. So Captain Cake sat in his cabin reading a book about gourds. Then they landed on an island of bloodthirsty hordes. The purser chucked the voodoo pins at the leader of these folk, who put down his sword and began to choke. Captain Cake wanted to be the island king, but they already had a god with bright and fluttery wings, and the god made the captain bow down on the sand.

During this time your editor has been engaged in exciting discussions with Hollywood moguls about a new television series. Zeigler And Locke will be a spin-off from two existing shows, featuring Toby Zeigler from The West Wing and Mr Locke from Lost. No one seemed to know what to do with the partnership. Should they be crusaders against evil, like Batman and Superman? Arch-rivals perhaps? Or just buddies on a pointless road trip?\nI am not sure why I was called in as a consultant. I messed around with a few templates--Steptoe and Son, Boswell and Johnson, Cagney and Lacey--but my parting advice, before coming home from the hills, was that Zeigler and Locke would work best by having the two protagonists as argumentative ornithologists roaming the hills and fields of a distant country, never agreeing on the identification of the various birds they spot. In each hour-long episode they would come upon one bird, and the conceit would be that every single time neither of them would be correct. In my pilot episode, what Zeigler argues is a peewit, and Locke insists is a moorhen, turns out to be a grebe.\n\nLeft to right : Toby Zeigler, Mr Locke, a grebe\n###"}

I am certain he could be reasonably still-ish while being drawn, or even painted, and I feel he deserves a second chance. He is, after all, a very small badger, and it is not his fault if his behaviour was misconstrued as \"mystic\" by ne'er-do-well impresarios hungry for a victim to exploit. Yours concernedly, Poppy Nisbet\nWell, Poppy, it's true that Little Severin the Mystic Badger turned out to be not so mystic after all, although rumours flying about at Haemoglobin Towers have it that he correctly forecast the medal winners in the recent Olympic men's polevaulting event (though not in the right order). On the other hand, maybe he was just scrubbling about in the undergrowth foraging for tasty grubs. Who can say? In any event, we have taken your advice and Little Severin is now earning his keep posing not, I am afraid to say, for paintbrush wielding Dachshunds, but as a full time model for human children at the Lancashire Badger Group.

I ought to point out that I have no pressing need to reshelve, and I may still abandon the idea. But just the other day, gazing at the teeming rows of books, I thought how pleasant it would be to see them all in a different order. What stops me from immediately getting on with it is a sense of not being entirely sure how I wish to rearrange. There are, after all, so many different schemes one can apply, and I am ludicrously unsure about which to proceed with. So instead of reshelving, I gaze, and think, and make a cup of tea, and smoke a fag, and stare out of the window, and generally faff about to no good purpose.\nAt least Huw Halfbacon raked the gravel.

Our next letter, O, could be taken for Nothing, too, if it were to be misread as 0, or zero, which it can be, if you are not looking carefully and don't give a damn about context. Iggy Pop claims that his band, The Stooges, has the best band-name ever, simply because of that \"oo\" in the middle. But the \"oo\" sound, written down, can also be interpreted as a double-zero, a double nothingness, as in, for example, the surname of the poet Rupert Brooke, propelled into the nothingness of death by a gnat-bite to his lip, as he sailed towards the Dardanelles, and Gallipoli. Edgar Allan Poe has just the one O at the centre of his surname, the O of a maelstrom, such as the maelstrom that lies in wait for Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket as he vanishes into a white nothingness.

{"prompt": "Chasm Of Vases\n", "completion": " The usual pronunciation of vase, in this country, is as a rhyme with mars. In the United States, it is more common for vase to rhyme with lace. Growing up on an Essex council estate with a Belgian mother whose native tongue was Flemish, however, I learned to rhyme vase with jaws.\nThis was but one example of my mother's idiosyncratic English. She spoke of the old films we loved to watch as being \"in white and black\", and regularly deployed a sort of guttural expostulation my sister still refers to as \"the Flemish sound\". This was used to express a vast swathe of emotions, from surprise to incredulity to contempt to disgust to ... well, pretty much any response.\nThe word chasm is one that we probably encounter more in written than spoken English. My mother pronounced it with a soft ch, as in chase or chicken. So I did too, on the rare occasions I said it aloud. I only learned the correct, hard c pronunciation in my late teens, when I was reading a passage aloud in an English class at school and my teacher raised an amused eyebrow. He gently corrected me when I finished reading.\nMany years have passed, but I still find myself drawn inexorably to the pronunciations I learned at my mother's knee. And, intriguingly, my sister finds herself increasingly using \"the Flemish sound\" as she grows older.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Pointyhead Closure\n", "completion": " Hooting Yard has been threatened with closure by a pointyhead. And no, I don't mean airhead \"closure\", I mean real closure, shutting down, expungement from the web. This is apparently because our risk assessment protocols and strategies lack robustness and transparency. Mr Key asked the pointyhead where we were going wrong, and was told there was an unacceptable risk to \"users\" that their heads would become blunter and would need to be sluiced out with a whitewash-based fluid, or possibly some kind of gas.\nSticking up for your rights, Mr Key demanded that the pointyhead produce evidence to back up so foul an accusation. This was duly provided in the form of a cupboard full of documents, all of which had been signed by the pointyhead and countersigned by the pointyhead's own pointyhead person. By skim-reading just one bulging Lever arch file, Mr Key learned that there was a whole hierarchy of risk tsars, risk rapporteurs, risk champions, risk adjudicators, and whatnot. It was like theology.\nMr Key set fire to the cupboard and pushed the pointyhead into a pond.\n###"}

I mooed the afternoon away, and so intensely did I immerse myself in cowdom that, at dusk, I found myself standing in a field, staring blankly at nothing, while gnats and midges hovered in the air around me.\nWhile I was thus engaged, Antipodean Hooting Yard researcher Glyn Webster made better use of his time.

She laughed. \"When people say they have bad dreams you expect them to say 'I was terrified' or something similar. But no, you were merely subject to disapproval.\" She found this highly amusing.\nLater I was able to reflect that things could be much worse. I learned that Auberon Waugh's maternal grandfather was told by a foolish friend that a guaranteed cure for blindness was to have all of one's teeth removed. He arranged for this to be done, contracted blood poisoning as a result, and died at the age of 43.\n###"}

For her folk herded cows through the seasons long, but they also jumped and leaped. They would wander into the market square of a town down in some dale, and they'd bounce up and down and gambol about wearing coats of many hues. And the songs they sang! Oh, the songs they sang were as strange as strange could be. I remember one that went \"Vienna--it means nothing to me\". All caked and painted were their carts, yellow, green and blue.

Hurling his considerable energy into the project, Stubing called for a meeting of interested parties, where he outlined his vision as follows:\nAnd the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever. But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it; and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.\nAnd that, children, is why there is a bird sanctuary at Bodger's Spinney.\n###"}

Darwin, in his Zoonomia, reports a case where an officer, holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel, could not tolerate a breakfast in which this odious article was wanting; but, as a savage retribution invariably supervened within an hour or two upon this act of insane sensuality, he came to a resolution that life was intolerable with muffins, but still more intolerable without muffins. He would stand the nuisance no longer; but yet, being a just man, he would give nature one final chance of reforming her dyspeptic atrocities. Muffins, therefore, being laid at one angle of the breakfast-table, and loaded pistols at another, with rigid equity the Colonel awaited the result. This was naturally pretty much as usual: and then, the poor man, incapable of retreating from his word of honour, committed suicide,-having previously left a line for posterity to the effect (though I forget the expression), \"That a muffinless world was no world for him: better no life at all than a life dismantled of muffins\".\nThomas De Quincey, \"On the Temperance Movement of Modern Times\", Tait's Edinburgh Magazine (1845)\n\n###"}

At the end, the Honorable Laura Mapleson shoots Lizzie, the younger of the two female protagonists, then chucks the body into the nearest \"rippling stream\" (231)...  Righteous smiting soon follows.  Laura, who apparently failed to look where she was going, stumbles into a nest of wasps, and is quickly beset by \"infuriated insects\" (231).  While trying to rid herself of the aforementioned insects, the Flashing Neon Foreshadowing kicks in, and Laura \"lay a bruised and bleeding mass of humanity in the darksome depth of the old disused quarry, where her victim, the palefaced girl, had stood and shuddered, as she thought of the horror of a fall into that dreadful darkness!\" (231)\"\n###"}

It is by several writers mentioned as a reputed cure for rheumatism in the same way; only it is prescribed that, in order to be an effective cure in such cases, the potato should be stolen. Mr. Andrew Lang mentions an instance of faith in the practice of this cure, which he came across in a London drawing-room.

Those whose remit is more familiar--athletics, gymnastics--have to do their best to compete. Thus, yesterday, I was delighted by the BBC pundit who noted, with due gravitas, of an entrant in one of those events where athletes run repeatedly around a track, \"I've been dubious about her hydration\".

Yesterday's piece A Weekend With An Owl God brought to my postbag a letter from Stephen Atahualpagreen of Aztec Voice:\nDear Mr Key : I am writing to protest in the strongest possible terms about your slanderous treatment of the Aztec faith. Traducing the name of our night owl god Chalchiuhtecolotl in such disgusting terms is not funny. It is deeply offensive to our most cherished beliefs. Like any other religion, the Aztec faith demands respect in 21st century Britain, which means, among other things, respecting our cultural right to practice a bloody form of human sacrifice on big stone altars. As well as feeling wounded and offended, your attack has also made us angry, and you know what happens when the gods get angry. Please send me your postal address and telephone number so I can publish them on our website and provoke other Aztec believers to exact the retribution which is your due fate.\nI did a bit of research into Mr Atahualpagreen.

First, back in 2009, we had the question posed \"Is Frank Key Will Self?\" And now, just the other day, this:\n\nWhile I am flattered by Mr Bugs' complimentary remarks, I am equally appalled to find myself compared in any way with the preposterous figure of Self. Perhaps the most laughable thing is the idea that he is some kind of edgy intellectual maverick. From his many appearances in the Grauniad and on the BBC, I think it is clear that he is in possession of the Middle-Class Student Wanker's starter pack marked 'This is what you think'. All his opinions are predictable and orthodox. If there is such a thing as the \"metropolitan liberal elite\", he is a card-carrying member. For example, he believes that everyone who voted for Brexit is probably a racist. Such simplistic twaddle will always get you applause and whooping from a Question Time audience, a fairly reliable indicator of vacuous dimwittery.\nI fear, however, that I will forever be linked with the wretched Self, given that his one useful contribution to the world was giving Mr Key a light for his cigarette in the midst of a downpour in south London.\n###"}

At first he was destined to work in the refectory, but the result of his frequent fits of absence of mind and ecstatic states on the crockery was disastrous, and Joseph added to the irritation caused by his breakages by wearing the pieces round his neck...  the accounts of his childhood, lack of education and later mental development suggest that he was not far from what today we should call a state of feeble-mindedness.

Here, for example, is a very useful tip from one Judy Amarose: When pushing pins into a foam board, try using a metal thimble. That will help save your fingers! You know, I think Judy is right. Dobson, of course, wrote about pins on a number of occasions, most famously in his pamphlet There's Hours Of Fun To Be Had With A Handful Of Pins, the only one of his works to be published under a pseudonym. The first edition of fifty-six copies, run off the press by Marigold Chew despite the fact that she had a collapsed lung at the time, purported to be by an author named \"Blenkinsop\". When a second edition--of just four copies--was printed a decade later, Dobson reverted, wisely I think, to his real name. Jed Git, the wastrel Dobson scholar who perished in the 1958 Munich Air Disaster alongside the \"Busby Babes\", hailed what he called \"that pin pamphlet\" as among the works that would prove to be timeless classics, celebrated a thousand years after their author's demise. He was wrong in this, as in so many things. Incidentally, forty-six years after his death, Jed Git's paramour still places a posy of primroses on his tomb on the sixth of February every year.

Of course, as soon as I read this, my immediate thought was \"O Dobson!

{"prompt": "\"On ships, attempts to melt the ice...\"\n", "completion": " \"On ships, attempts to melt the ice by buckets of hot water or by steam jets are only partially effective, because a great deal of heat is needed to melt a little ice. Further, if the temperature is still below freezing point when the operation is being carried out, the melted ice may freeze again unless it can be pushed overboard first. Mechanical detachment of the ice is no easy matter, for ice adheres most tenaciously to clean, grease-free surfaces and a ship has often been thoroughly de-greased by wind-swept rain and spray before it becomes iced-up.\" -- G Van Praagh, De-Icing Of Ships\n###"}
{"prompt": "Chains and Waters\n", "completion": " Last week I borrowed from the library Adam Nicolson's Power And Glory : Jacobean England And The Making Of The King James Bible. It's a splendid read, packed with nuggets of interest. At the moment, I'm at the point where Nicolson takes us back to the 1580s and the persecution of the Separatist puritans. (It was this lot, incidentally, who started the fad for naming their children after moral or holy qualities--Eschew-Evil, Sin-deny, Increased, Much-mercy, and, my favourite, Wrestling Brewster.) Many of the Separatists fled to Holland, but those who didn't ended up in prison. \"One of them,\" writes Nicolson, \"the eighteen-year-old Roger Waters, was kept in irons for more than a year.\"\nNow this seems a savage punishment for questioning the basis of the Church of England, but it led me to think that, four hundred years later, it would have been a pretty lenient way of dealing with the poor lad's namesake. Writing Another Brick In The Wall, by itself, is probably worth at least five years in chains, and there are sundry other crimes to account for.\n###"}

{"prompt": "Poppycock\n", "completion": " In a review of Ian Jack's The Country Formerly Known As Great Britain, Rachel Cooke writes:\nAlmost all of these wonderful pieces were commissioned by newspapers and magazines. They would never have worked, and would not now work, on the internet, which is so very interested in speed and sensation and so resolutely uninterested in well-researched thoughtfulness; in essays on bus conductors and Sundays and the seaside; in all the small, strange things that make us who we are.\nThis seems to me to be utter poppycock. There is abundant \"well-researched thoughtfulness\" in Interwebshire, plenty about bus conductors and seaside resorts, and a cornucopia of those small, strange things. Hooting Yard is merely one tiny haven of such delights. And surely if one is seeking vapid drivel and \"sensation\", one need look no further than the Grauniad and the Observer (where the review appears).\nThe book itself looks well worth reading:\nJack notes that 1956 was the year in which he and his parents ate their first \"tin of baked beans that also included sausages\", a meal taken while sheltering from the rain beneath a bridge at Lanercost Priory, near Hadrian's Wall. \"My,\" said his father, \"but this is good!\"\nYou can rarely go wrong with a sausage anecdote.\n###"}

The curtains would open and there, on stage, world-famous and splattered with food, stood a Jesuit. He would extend his arms, almost in crucifixion pose, and gaze at a point slightly above the heads of the audience. There were no frills, no 'business' with props. After a few minutes, the curtains would close, and--barring the inevitable encore--that was that.\"\nIt has now come to my attention that, as so often, the real world anticipated the supposedly wacky world of Hooting Yard, and by many decades. Via Strange Flowers, I learned today of Weimar cabaret artist Valeska Gert. \"In the 1920s, Gert premiered one of her most provocative works entitled Pause. Performed in between reels at Berlin cinemas, it was intended to draw attention to inactivity, silence, serenity, and stillness amidst all the movement and chaos in modern life.

The man for me is Robertson. In 1804 he published in Vienna a plan for La Minerva, an aerial vessel destined for discoveries, and proposed to all the Academies of Europe, by Robertson, physicist. The Minerva would have a balloon of 150 feet in diameter, made of unbleached silk, coated within and without with india-rubber. For some reason it was imperative that the balloon be manufactured in Lyons. Atop the balloon would gleam a weathercock, \"the symbol of watchfulness\", and at the sides would be two purely ornamental wings. Suspended from the balloon would be a ship, containing a small boat (\"in which the passengers might take refuge in case of necessity, in the event of the larger vessel falling on the sea in a disabled state\"); a store for water, wine and other provisions; silk ladders; closets; the pilot's room; an observatory containing compasses \"and other [unspecified] scientific instruments\"; a room \"fitted up for recreations, walking, and gymnastics\"; a kitchen, medicine room, theatre and music room; a study; and lastly, tents for the \"air-marines\".

The effects of vitriol throwing. Stories tinctured with salacious wit. Sensual exposition of Eugenic Doctrines.\n1919 -- Criminal poisoning by dissemination of germs. Excessive revolver shooting. Animals gnawing men and children*. Clutching hands.\n1925 -- Libels on the British nursing profession. Bolshevik propaganda.

{"prompt": "Stakhanov, Colman\n", "completion": " \nAleksei Grigorievich.Stakhanov was the heroic Soviet worker who, in 1935, extracted one-hundred-and-two tons of coal in a six-hour shift, exceeding the norm more than sevenfold. Stakhanov was from the Donets Basin, one of a number of basins we will be examining here at Hooting Yard in the coming weeks. The abiding fascination of basins is subject to almost criminal neglect, a situation we hope to put right. Please note, however, that not all basins are sites of coal extraction, and certainly not of heroic works of coal extraction by Stakhanovites.\n\nIt is unlikely that Ronald Colman ever extracted coal from a basin in his life, heroically or otherwise, but he had other talents, one of which led to him being known as \"the man with the velvet voice\". Colman will never be forgotten, of course, for he starred alongside Greer Garson in the single most heart-rending tear-jerker of all time, Random Harvest. Watch it and weep, and then watch it again and weep again. Is there another film with so preposterous a plot which remains utterly and completely captivating at the umpteenth viewing?\n###"}

{"prompt": "Horse Begone\n", "completion": " I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still.\n\"Da doo ron ron, horse begone!\" she cried. It was an incantation, in a field, and sure enough, the horse to whom she addressed these words turned and cantered away, until it could no longer be seen in the mist and the drizzle.\nSomebody told me that her name was Jill, but before I could ask her, she was casting her spells again.\n\"Hoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!\" she yelled, at a cow, but this time without the desired effect. The cow just stared back at her, chewing its cud, the way cows do.\n\"Hoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!\" she repeated, a little desperately, I thought. If I'd been the cow, I would have sensed a moment of panic, of confidence drained. Jill--if Jill was her name--repeated her incantation too soon. The cow did not move.\nSo I took the opportunity to stride purposefully across the field in my creaking black boots until I was face to face with her.\n\"Somebody told me that your name is Jill,\" I said, essaying a bow as if I were some sort of Regency fop.\n\"My name is not Jill,\" she hissed, \"I am the Woohoohoodiwoodadooronron Woman. Fop begone!\" and I found myself propelled by some eldritch force into a weird netherworld where I languish to this day, my only companion the horse. There is no sign of the cow.\n###"}
{"prompt": "Nature Notes\n", "completion": " On May 13 1988 I was amused to read a report in The Daily Telegraph that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds had erected a mesh fence to keep bird-fanciers away from a colony of little terns on Great Yarmouth beach, whose numbers had grown from 20 pairs to 70 pairs in three years.\nOn August 2 1990 I was interested to read a report in The Daily Telegraph as follows:\n\"Britain's biggest breeding colony of little terns, on Great Yarmouth Beach, Norfolk, where 201 pairs were nesting, has been largely wiped out by two hedgehogs and a kestrel.\"\nKestrels, of course, are fanatically protected by all the high-tech and paramilitary resources of the multi-million pound RSPB, which on this occasion seems to have been hoist with its own petard, as they say. It is hard to know with whom we should sympathise most in this tale: the ordinary bird-fanciers, who were kept away from fancying little terns by a mesh fence put up by the superior bird-fanciers of the RSPB bureaucracy, or the unfortunate little terns, condemned to twitter away unseen.\nMy own sympathies are with the hedgehogs. They are delightful, if slightly flea-ridden, animals, with whom it is sometimes possible to hold an intelligent conversation. Has anybody ever had an intelligent conversation with a little tern? Hedgehogs do not demand a whole apparatus of repression to survive. Every time a hedgehog wipes out a little tern, it is a blow for freedom.\nAuberon Waugh, \"Nature Notes\", The Daily Telegraph, 11 August 1990\n###"}

One idealistic teacher suggested that among the things deemed important in his planned school, in a deprived area, would be good manners and the basic civilised matter of sitting down together at mealtimes. The privately-educated well-brought-up Grauniad staff take these things for granted, of course, but the very idea that they should be inculcated in the lower orders is anathema.

{"prompt": "Diverse And Vibrant\n", "completion": " When Sebastian Coe spoke of \"the greatest tickets on earth\", he was talking twaddle, but at least it was amusing twaddle. Too often, the twaddle babbled by politicians and others is composed of readymade phrases seemingly used to fill time--or, in written form, space--without the inconvenience of thought.\nOne practice that has become ubiquitous is an inability to say \"diverse\" without immediately adding \"vibrant\". The most recent culprit I noted was the cabinet minister Francis Maude, on last week's Question Time. Having told us how great it was that the country is \"diverse\", and not really knowing what else he wanted to say, after a very brief pause he added \"and vibrant\", clearly playing for time.\nSimilarly, the front page headline on a recent issue of my local council's Pravda-style newspaper was a quote from a resident announcing \"I love that the borough is so diverse and vibrant\".\nCan one be diverse without being vibrant? Or vibrant without being diverse? And, if interrogated, chained to a chair in a dank basement, could most of the people trotting out this stuff define what they actually mean by \"vibrant\"?\nHooting Yard--it's diverse!

{"prompt": "Larder Tips\n", "completion": " Welcome to this month's Hooting Yard Larder Tips. If you have a larder, we strongly recommend that you stack the shelves with lots of jars containing different types of sauce. It is a good idea to glue a label to each jar, bearing the name of the sauce it contains. A bold, clear typeface should be used for the label, not some hasty scrawl made with the last remnant of a crayon. In the unlikely event that you do not drool with glee at the prospect of eating all those sauces, you can instead pack your larder with pots of paste, but follow the same labelling advice. Pots may need smaller labels than jars, so bear that in mind.\nMake sure your larder is airy. If the door shuts very very tight, and by some chance all the air is sucked out of the larder, you will find that you are unable to gain access to your jars of sauce, or pots of paste, because the larder will have become a vacuum, which nature abhors. Readers in the United States who face this quandary may find it useful to contact Dave Aspnes (pictured below) who is the current president of the American Vacuum Society. As Dave says, \"the historic roots of [the Society] are in the creation and measurement of vacuum\", so he should be able to help if your larder becomes one.\n\n###"}

{"prompt": "Belshazzar\n", "completion": " Rembrandt's source for this painting, the Old Testament Book of Daniel (5: 1-6, 25-8), tells of a banquet Belshazzar, King of Babylon, gave for his nobles. At this banquet he blasphemously served wine in the sacred vessels his father Nebuchadnezzar had looted from the Temple in Jerusalem.\nRembrandt shows the moment when a divine hand appeared and wrote on the wall a phrase only Daniel could decipher. When transliterated the inscription reads: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation: 'God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; your kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.' That very night Belshazzar was slain.\nRembrandt derived the form of Hebrew inscription from a book by his friend, the learned Rabbi and printer, Menasseh ben Israel, yet mistranscribed one of the characters and arranged them in columns, rather than right to left, as Hebrew is written. The picture, painted in about 1635, is an example of Rembrandt's attempt to establish himself as a painter of large-scale Baroque history paintings.\nNotes courtesy of the National Gallery, London\n###"}
