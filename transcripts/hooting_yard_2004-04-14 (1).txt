Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And I'm going to read you some stories and other things for about half an hour. Everything I read, you can find on my website, the hooting yard website and I'll give you the address at some point. And the addresses also probably somewhere on the resonance web page, if it's not it will be most of the stuff is is written by me but I do like I do like to keep keep my readers and listeners informed and educated with instructive and moral quotations from the world of literature and I'm tireless in my search. For example, this this is from john H. Knox, from a novel called the thing that dined on death.

Unknown Speaker  01:10
It was marrow dark, the fashionable radio astrologer whose name was on every woman's tongue. slayed had seen him often passing through the village in his big foreign made car with his jaded and divorced companions on whose neurotic faces Slade's I had read the imprint of sickening abnormalities did the orgies which was said to go on in marrow darks house, have any bearing on these best deal atrocities slayed plotted back to his car. His brain was a whirling chaos. Isn't that marvelous? And the the so called worthy Barber of Pimlico natto would Sarah lantana non us those those five sentences from Knox's book as the basis for a word game, which she unsuccessfully marketed for a while under the name john fouls opoli ik fail completely, but it's a great favorite of all of us at hooting yard. And the rules such as they are very simple. Taking the adjectives from Knox's passage, which in alphabetical order, our best deal big do borscht fashionable, foreign made, jaded, neurotic, sickening and whirling all of that in such a short passage, players are given five minutes to compose a very short story suitable as a bedtime tale for infants. All nine adjectives have to be used but free rein is given for the rest of the text. And extra points are awarded if the word plodded is also included. You can play this at home and in fact, you might even want to send in your entries but to give you an idea, here's here's one that here's one I knocked up earlier. Once upon a time, there was a deadbolt fairy named bind we'd bind we'd who like to dress in fashionable foreign made fairly closed, had a ferry sister called ring rot. Ring rot was jaded and neurotic. On the day the big spaceship with its whirling propellers landed in dandy line del bind Weeden ring rock wet plodding along to greet the goose splattered alien beings. The screeched bind weighed aren't they sickening? Ring rock began to vomit right next to the spaceship, the goose splattered alien beings were extremely disturbed by the best deal behavior. They climbed back into their spaceship and flew off to another planet called zigzag k seven nine. Good night children. So if you'd like to try that yourself, if you I'll repeat very slowly the so you can write them down the nine adjectives you need. best deal big deal borscht? fashionable, foreign made, jaded, neurotic, sickening and whirling. And don't forget that you get extra points if you include the word plodded and it you know it should be suitable for bedtime reading, as is as is the next piece which another children's story. In fact, this is taken from the idyllic childhood of Clytemnestra BIM by Gustav BIM. As told to Dobson you be hearing a lot more of dogs than I think, I suspect, and this is called burnt maps. Mr. bimm bought an atlas as a birthday gift for his daughter, who was tremendously fond of geography. without opening the big fat book, Mr. BIM asked the ugly head shop assistant to wrap it up in colorful and exciting paper, and to tie a ribbon around it. The shop assistant did the wrapping with precision and care, but then got the ribbon and tangled in his old hair and had to use a pair of scissors to free it. Now, the ribbon was not long enough to go the Atlas. I am most dreadfully dreadfully sorry, said the shop assistant. Oh, Never you mind now, said Mr. BIM. The wrapping paper is lovely all by itself. The paper had a pattern of interlocking hollyhocks, delphiniums, and fire extinguishers. All red and green and gold and purple and yellow and blue. Mr. Ben's daughter Clytemnestra unwrapped the Atlas on her birthday. Three days later,

Unknown Speaker  06:08
she beamed and gave her part a kiss on his hairy cheek. Oh gosh, what can I say? Thank you so much papaya she said. Now, we learned in the very first sentence that classroom Nestor was terrifically fond of geography. That fondness had led her to become knowledgeable too. So imagine her disappointment, when upon close inspection, she discovered that every single one of the maps in the Atlas was inaccurate. The Port of split is not in Bolivia. The world's largest lake is not just a few miles south of Swanage, and Swanage itself is not spelt swans without that second day. I will take it back to that shop and complain, said Mr. bimm. No, no papar said Clayton nestra. Let us tear all the maps out of the book and make a fire with them. Let us create a conflagration like hunter the very flames of hell. And children, Do you know something? That is exactly what they did. I'm not gonna just have a little sip of water while you mull over that story. And you may want to get your pens and paper at hand. I should have told you you should have pens and paper and because it's time for recipe of the week. And in case if you don't, if you don't manage to get all this down, don't worry, because as I said it can be found on the website. And then the address is hooting.yard.users.bt open world.com and there's no there's no www prefix for some reason. I don't know why. So here's this week's recipe. And it's quite simple. I think I think you shouldn't have too much trouble with it. First of all, a list of ingredients. You will need six ounces of self raising flour, six ounces of self hatred flour, four tablespoons of jezza Bell oil 25 pints of boiled duck pond water, one reason 12 quails eggs, a smidgeon just a smidgen of marzipan. 12 cucumbers, 13 sticks of rhubarb, a very large hollyhock two buckets of chaff, a pint of turtles blood, five packets of Special K 15 blood oranges, two fresh bream 54 more raisins, one plastic bag, eight radishes, one cup of Blair 18 pints of milk, three pounds of toffee, five tablespoons of gum arabic, two cups of Bathsheba extract. 62 more hand feathers, a dash of eyes and glass. One tablespoon of lemon curd we're nearly there. three balls of wool, five ounces of titanium, one beetle and eight jars of some nameless eldritch plasma. Got that. Now method one, find a large metal drum about the size of a telephone kiosk to shove everything into it having chopped up the things that need chopping three boil for while it boils think long and hard about the fact that rhubarb takes From the Greek Riaan barber on that is something which comes from the barbarous country of the raw, which was the Greek name for the Volga five. When it's finished boiling, transfer it into a big metal basin and bake it in an oven for four hours. Six removed from the oven, allow to cool then cut into cake sized cubes. Seven fry those cakes over a low flame until golden or at least what passes for golden in this lead an age eight serve with milk diluted with tap water What should we have next?

Unknown Speaker  10:46
What should we have next?

Unknown Speaker  10:47
I've got another Soup Recipe don't want that now. Recently I've been I've been right for some reason I've been inspired by the Grateful Dead. Isn't that strange? So this piece is called this piece is called Dark Star crashes. I'm sure you know it well. Dark Star crashes pouring it to light into ashes. Reason tatters. These are weighty matters so weighty indeed, that you must note them in your jata but horror of horrors with what will you jot you recall with a Pang that your borrow is lost, or perhaps has been purloined by the borrow thief. He whose exploits have so enthralled the readers of the daily clang. Your draw, of course is innocent of pencils. It has been so since childhood, your power would have no pencils in his house, you recall. And yet he never revealed the wellspring of his loathing. Once you tried to write about it with your borrow, and your book is low thing it's Wellspring was well, well received up to a point, though there were those who said it lacked a certain dash. To your shame you blamed your past chlamydia, a conclusion so preposterous that your uncle sued you in a court of law. Behind the door of the court of law lacked a lactose intolerant nitroglycerin boffin bluestocking, who became your wife and changed your life. You popped all copies of your book and sat in steam. You had a hideous headache for a week. But planning as you did to raise those storms. You kept all pencils from your house just as your father did. Your wife asked why you used a nib to jot down your reply. I am my father son, you wrote he died a pauper. He was that kind of guy.

Unknown Speaker  13:01
Again, as I say you can you can read that you can have a look at that on the on the on the website. I'm just I'm just selecting what might what might fit nicely after that. leafing through lots of paper here. Oh yeah, this this is this pointy town. pointy town. A Guide to pointy town.

Unknown Speaker  13:32
pointy town

Unknown Speaker  13:33
is no you know utopia. For instance, you will find in the town no trace whatsoever of quaintness, rye, euphonium, rehearsals, toffee, yogurt, you lating idiots. ornithological paraphernalia, athletics, sawdust, dockyard, flamboyance, gutters Hydros drugless kissing lovers, zealous X ray eyed cadets, and visigoth brand nugget munchies. But who needs any of those things when they're a great architectural Marvels to be seen? One of the most striking and gigantic buildings in pointy town is the old wretched flophouse. The principal front on the land side is considerably more than one third of a drive and mile in length, and its wings in depth extend 672 feet down to the edge of the big frightening River. This noble watercourse forming the fourth side of the quadrangle within the three sides, the big frightening river and two wings, arrangers of parallel buildings which form the magazines artificers shops, mast and boat houses, offices and so on. And in the area within these are four slips for building the largest and two for the smaller class of tugboats of pointlessness. The whole of the outer Ranger buildings consists of lamentable suites of rooms and long and fill fully ornamented galleries filled with the natural History and curiosities, collected in every part of the globe and brought by the different navigators which pointy town of late years has sent forth on Discovery. in one room are assembled all the different nautical and mathematical instruments. In another all the models of toy Brazil nuts of different nations in different eras, and in another a complete library, connected with every branch of both human and inhuman knowledge. The library's most treasured item is the manuscript of the first draft of sepal Vedas in named poem lines written upon first listening to Dr. Bogan broom by Jethro towel. And I'd like to read that poem to you now, it's the only time you're going to get a poem. So think yourself lucky. But it's a what a fine poem it is, I think. Oh, savage and vile and pink and bloated thing. Kirsten canny globule of despair, monstrous to so pale and shuttering. Its gleaming talons, clawing my hair. Has this being come to announce my Doom? its head is like a chaffinch or a gal that has been sent by Dr. Bogan broom, invoked by minstrel wizards, Jethro towel. And they won't be any more of that kind of nonsense, I can tell you two news items, which I think we need to get out of the way. If I can find them among all this stuff. Bear with me while I bear with me talk among yourselves while I find these.

Unknown Speaker  16:55
Now we're gonna have to probably go on with something else instead because I can't find them. But I was reading about Charles Babbage, you know, the 19th century computer man. And when he wasn't inventing the computer, Babbage spent much of his time and really quite a lot of his time. This is entirely factual, getting really het up about what he calls street disturbances. And they seem to have consisted almost entirely of what most people call music. And he wrote, he wrote a helpful list he sent a letter to the to the government, I think, and it was called instruments of torture permitted by the government to be in daily or nightly use in the streets of London. And here's Babbage's list, organs, bagpipes brass bands, accordions Fiddler's hate me whistles, harps, tom toms, harpsichords trumpets, hurdy gurdy, he's shouting out objects for sale flagey a lot religious counting drums and some singing. And apart from the government, who was responsible for allowing this mayhem, Babbage knew exactly who to blame, as he wrote further in the pamphlet, Tavern keepers, public houses, girl shops, beer shops, coffee shops, servants, children, visitors from the country, ladies of doubtful virtue and occasionally titled ladies, but these are almost invariably of recent elevation and deficient in that taste which their sex usually possess. So he sounds like a, you know, the man after one's own heart. This

Unknown Speaker  18:43
is me,

Unknown Speaker  18:44
Charles Babbage. Where to next? Where to next? Oh, this is interesting. I told you I was going to say more about Dobson.

Unknown Speaker  18:57
Now one of the things about Dobson he wrote many many, many pamphlets, all of which unfortunately are out of print. But one thing that never made it as far as a pamphlet in 1955 he went to the the Festival of argumentative music in olma. And he made a dictaphone recording of his impressions of what was going on at the festival. But it never made it into a pamphlet. So here here's his here's my kind of my reading of the transcript is really not quite what it should be is not I haven't got Dobson's haven't got Dobson's expression. So you just have to imagine, imagine that the tape actually begins with these kind of uncanny and repetitive metallic banging noises. And then you hear and then then Dobson comes in and I'll do that. Oh, oh. According to the program this racket because you See he's actually there recording this as he's watching or listening. According to the program, this racket must be an ensemble called brouhaha playing a piece called tiny moths. Ah, gossamer wings. I suppose that's meant to be ironic in some way. Either that or it's a mistranslation. After all, they're Hungarians, and so many of them are counted 40 but then more of them appeared with hammers and other ironmongery and they all bear a faint resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Maybe brouhaha is one big family. I'll have to check. This piece has been going on for over an hour and they look as if they're just warming up. God help us and then there's a then there's a break in the tape. And when he comes back, Dobson saying, Now that was more like it. I've just finished watching Fleur and Primrose much more conducive to my tastes. flirt played the pocket Cornett and Primrose played TAC piano, instrumentals mostly with a sort of valiant carelessness. I don't think any of the pieces lasted more than 45 seconds. The last number was strange. They were joined by someone called Dennis who shouted things. I think he was reading from a list of water polo Cup tie results. Anyway, it was matchless. nother another, click edit on the tape. And then there's this just this one sentence. I really don't know what I'm doing here. And then it comes back home. It's three hours since I last recorded. I've just come back on the bus from the old swimming pool, LIDAR and Marina complex where parts of the festival are taking place. I went over there to hit the big event everyone's been talking about the premiere of binders control over medicine balls, blood, oranges and canoe. I assumed it was going to be an electronic piece. But no, it was all natural. unamplified sound and somehow it had an astonishing. I don't know montverde esque resonance, which is hard to explain. It was visually exciting too, as all the players were wearing hideous orange junctions. I'm sure I saw Primrose from Primrose and Fleur in the Molly somewhere but without her tak piano. Next up is something called Big flugel horn mayhem in the northern territories disputed by goat boy and his whelk farm hardhat orchestra. I think I'll give that a myth. And that was that was the end of the recording. And more Dobson, now actually more about jobs and he wrote, he wrote a lengthy critical analysis of a piece of work called the life and times of Captain cake. This was a this was a very short text that was scribbled on a scribbled on a torn envelope, which was found tucked inside a paperback copy of attack of the Tsar guns from planet gate, which is a science fiction novel by punter. hyunjun as I said, it's a very it's a very brief text. And I'll read it to you the life and times of Captain cake. All hands on deck, cried Captain cake. He looked so much like Lawrence Welk. his crew were grim. They play ping pong on the poop deck with spite and hate. But Captain cake, he hacked and choked and took his bucket to shops on shore, where he saw Tallulah Bankhead. She was a card shop in the dockyards. Now Captain cake had gone to seed. He looked as if he'd been cursed by some bright fanged as tech God. I think it might be called abraxis. Either that or Myrna Loy, whose face loomed huge when he shut his eyes racked by palsy, His hands were withered and all his timbers had been shivered.

Unknown Speaker  24:16
As I said, it was a loose end one one blustery Thursday morning. And Dobson decided to write a critical analysis of the text. He began as he always did by sharpening his pencil. That done in a single burst of inexplicable enthusiasm. he penned an essay much, much longer than his usual pamphlet. It's a bewildering piece of work caustic and trenchant even by Dobson standards, and it was issued in 15 weekly installments, flush with cash from the sale of his big mysterious piece of hardboard. Dobson took out advertisements in the press to announce his new pathwork offering the first issue a discount Pricing including a two inch hard plastic figurine of Captain cake is further inducement like those, you know those sort of de augustino? Dagestani partworks. It didn't sell very well. And one reason may be that the FX dealer blat, the distinguished critic and pirate said that the figurine bore absolutely no resemblance to Captain cake. And in fact, thought that Dobson had probably just picked up a job somewhere, which fakely I suppose, undermined undermine the whole project.

Unknown Speaker  25:43
I was going to earlier I was going to give you some news, and we might have time for, for a little bit of news before we go. And I'm so well prepared, he said, I know exactly where it is. But if you allow me to leave through my papers, I will find it for you. Because I know it's here. We can hear you can hear the rummaging carny and hear the exciting rummaging. As I begin to think that, you know, I'm not going to find it, am I? Russell Russell Russell. There's another recipe but I don't think we need another recipe for today. So here's another quotation. This might take us up. Here's another quotation because I can't find the news item. This is I can't pronounce this name. This is the author of this is ma chaplet, ska, from his his or her book shamanism in Siberia. And he says or she says, the cam, as if approaching the Yata of Ehrlich and coming into His presence. bowels, brings his drum up to his forehead and says Maru Maru, then he declares whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts. This is meant to indicate that Ehrlich is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his Yatta the frightened can leap backward towards the door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches Ehrlich's thrown, after this performance has been gone through three times. Ehrlich speaks, winged creatures cannot fly hither. beings with bones cannot come. How have you, Ill smelling black beetle made your way to my abode. And that's it for this week. And we'll leave you with with our theme music which is which is bloated janitor by Vril from the album effigies in Cork.
