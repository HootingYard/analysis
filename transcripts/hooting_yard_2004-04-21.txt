Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for half an hour. I had thought of reading one or possibly two longer pieces, but I think like last week, we'll have some variety. So I'll read various shorter pieces, beginning with a piece. Some while ago, I thought I needed to devote my life to writing pen portraits of ships captain's. So I trolled through many, many old sort of nautical almanacs. Thinking that I'd write, you know, dozens, hundreds of these things. And in the event I only ever wrote one, and this is it. And it's a it's a pen portrait of a ship's captain. Captain flask of the HMS corrugated cardboard was a bad and dangerous man. He never washed his hair, and he was fond of tormenting badges. his ship was falling apart, because whenever any of his miserable crew tried to repair something, like the rigging, or a focus or, or even the whole, all off deck, he would fly into a rage, like something out of the Old Testament, and the crew would be cowed and go back below decks to their scrimshaw and Grog. Every day, all day, and every night All night, Captain flask lurched around the deck, shouting at the sky in the pocket of his Westgate, where his Fogg watch ought to have been, he kept a supply of tin baubles, and he would throw these at any birds that came within his range, particularly guillemots, which he loved and cormorants, which he did not understand. But his aim was not good. And he usually missed. One of his arms was withered from scruffier. His job was to lay abandoned in the untidy draw of his escrow suar hidden among old pencils, bits of Calico drawing pins, bottle tops, cornflakes and dust every morning at six o'clock, or whatever that is in maritime parlance. Captain flask drank a whole pint of milk of magnesia he was such a bad man, such a dangerous man. And so that was the only ship's captain's pen portray I ever got around to writing unfortunately. Last week for any listeners who were listening last week, I kept promising a couple of news items, which none of which I've ever or ever read out. The reason for that being that I discovered after the show that in fact, I hadn't brought them with me. But you'll be pleased to know that I have them whether they still count as news is another matter entirely. But here they are. Anyway, the first one is well the first one leads me to think is is nothing sacred has has rebranding got so bad. I mean, I just heard the other day apparently that this The Seven Dwarves Snow White's diminutive little pals are going to be rebranded and given new names. And apparently these names should be used for next Friday. Was that the 23rd? I think 23rd of April, if that's the correct date on Friday, the Seven Dwarves after that should be should be known as wretched, spiteful incontinent, wistful, lippy rancorous and preening. As Snow White apparently continues as on a Snow White for some reason. But if you could start using those new names for the, for the Seven Dwarves, that would be helpful. The other news item which I'm shuffling through it have actually marked marked things today that I still seem to have difficulty finding it. Where is this second? Oh yes, the second item is about the Ayn Rand household pet of the week contest, which is run by the weekly shackle and it's been won this week. The top prize this week has gone to blasphemous Ted kargh pan's dog variously known as some some listeners will know that hopscotch,

spinach chevin iX degroote or L'Oreal because he's worth it. He was the clear winner the dog in a field which included a be a horse, three corncrakes, a flea ridden bison, Tim the pipistrelle bat, a weasel occurred you a pair of otters, and the bookies favorite a squirrel called Miriam. Unfortunately, Miriam's have come to an attack of the bindings and had to be withdrawn from competition. So Better luck next week and get well soon. And Miriam, the squirrel from all of us here at resonance, FM. Next, Next up, I think, yes, your listeners should know that. There's a hooting yard website, of course. And I'll give you the address if you'd like to take pen and paper. The address is hooting.yd.users.bt open world.com. Normally, the website is our there's no there's no www prefix for some reason. Normally, the site is updated for five, six, sometimes even seven days a week. But there's been a slight problem at the moment we've had major technical problems. Part of this may be that Mrs. gubbins who's one of the main people who runs the site is currently on the run from the law. And I just want to read to you something that happened to Mrs gubbins shortly before she was arrested she escaped from police custody that's why she's on the run. But shortly before she was arrested there's an account of what happened it should you should understand that the the the website is maintained by a group of volunteers from a home for the bewildered and the fraught, who come in and organize it. This this is this is an account of something that happened to Mrs. gubbins. Doc clouds lowered and hailstones began to ping upon the pavement. Inside haemoglobin towers, Mrs. gubbins and an 83 year old colleague Daisy dfx. We're putting the finishing touches to their new software development pump action graphics hub 1.0 already being touted as a harbinger by techno bilge magazine. Would you care for a cup of tea dear? asked Daisy, noting that Mrs. gubbins was panting as dramatically and mopping her brow with a dainty handkerchief embroidered with a pattern of crocus's, hollyhocks. mealy bugs and spurge Daisy has always been famed for her solicitude. gasped Mrs. gubbins you're getting yourself all flustered. Mrs. gubbins sent Daisy a little sharply, just because you forgot to insert a backslash into the command line for the ActiveX pod system trade default. reminded of this peccadillo Mrs gubbins became even more agitated, toppled offer ergonomic extruded plastic workstation seating module and landed on the floor thrashing about in an alarming fashion theory may matter to Daisy to herself, and resolved at once to call an ambulance. Despite the storm which was now raging outside like something from the imagination of the painter john Martin. she flipped through her Rolodex looking for the telephone number of the budget spinny ambulance station, which was close by but without her spectacles, which she had unaccountably left in the office kitchenette while making some Bovril earlier. She was as good as blind. One of these days I'll forget my own head. She chuckled in her fluting croak. Meanwhile, a stream of drool was flowing from Mrs. gubbins thin lipped mouth, and her head was turning green dot dot dot. I just want to make one comment there pedantic listeners may argue that a croak cannot be fluting.

But you haven't heard Daisy DS speak. And by the way, you'll be pleased to know that Mrs. gubbins did make a full recovery before an ambulance arrived, because Matilda Choctaw who's so sprightly for a 91 year old, skipped into the office and and did mouth to mouth resuscitation just at the point of the dot, dot dot above. So I hope that you know, you will rest easy knowing that things are okay. Ah, yes, yes. People often say to me, you know, in conversation as I wind my way through life, people often say to me, Frank, why are you so obsessed with the, the out of print pamphleteer Dobson? And it's true, I'm, I'm, you know, I admit, I'm probably quite fixated upon this legendary figure. no longer with us. Of course. Those of you who listened last week will have heard certain of certain writings of Dobson's what we haven't. What you haven't heard now, until now is fragments from his autobiography. This was never completed, and in fact, never published. But Dobson did work for many years on an autobiography. And there are four extracts from it which I'd like to read to you. They're not connected we don't know what period of his life he's referring to. And of course, he lived a very long and fulfilling life as an out of print pamphleteer. Here are the four extract from it was never titled The Autobiography. So we don't know really what to call it. Dobson. I suppose this is one of the things of this is one of those Dobson moments. Extract number one. My mother's brooch was blue. She took me to the lake and punched my jaw. She threw my breakfast into a pond. I banged my head against a barge the day she showed me the canal. Number two. There were massive shutters in that room and I'd never left it. Ah, I had brilliant teeth in my hair. There were roses that were lockets I was lacking something so unnerved. But for my hatred she'd have seen it even eaten it. Got it on her eyelash crushed it broken it. eked it out of someone's personal loved it lusted after it. So here's my signifier. You can read it. You can keep it. You're so thick. You don't even know what to do with it. Well, eyebrows hair, my pastorals then breakfast and I love her. I'll come on, you must be guessing. Or maybe you're just so fetching. I'm done with fleshing out my lying. My hair is in a tangle and I haven't paid the rent, but I had brilliant teen in my hair and yours were better shutters. Dammit, I couldn't even see your rubbish but I had brilliant in in my hair. Number three, extract from Dobson's autobiography. I'm just actually before reading this, I'm gonna have a sip of tea bear with me. When I stood at the edge of the lake, when I stood on the bridge, when I looked at the water when I saw the broken fountain when I broke my neck when I lay awake all night when I couldn't see a thing when my mind began to snap when I was spoon fed cocoa when what I said went askew when they profit me jam when my tongue was hanging out when I loaded in all when the diving board cracked beneath me when I fell into a pond when I was all washed up when I ate too much chocolate when nothing broke my spirit when I hosted a TV chat show when I went to a wedding when I broke down in tears when I was in despair when Bracken snagged my socks when illness cast a shadow when death appeared lascivious when sadness crushed my feelings. When I was struck by lightning when all I did was worry when I threw in the towel when I was scorched in deserts when no one gave me biscuits when all I had was breathing. When my gas bill sent me bonkers then you told when he told me that I'd had it. All I wanted was and unfortunately the next word is illegible, so we don't know what it was. And the final extract from from this rather

puzzling autobiographies somewhere has some has not surprisingly never finished it. When the tiny Mexican house on stilts was revealed behind such rich brocade curtains and we fell in love, Captain snaps wooden leg was rammed between us. He was a brutish man, vengeful hirsute and lewd, prone to piss and vinegar jars and to take our clocks to bit. I remember how he left the parts. The dial hands, cogs and springs lifted about our flat smeared with marmalade, peppered with talc and reeking of his dubbing. We walked on either side of him, mouthing words of IR and loading as he limped stump, clunk stump, clunk stump, clunk by the wharf, jabbering and shouting. He never made any sense. Captain snaps wooden leg was rammed between us, I took a hunting rifle and shot him through the head, then we were together darling, and he was good and dead. Interestingly enough, I think that that last piece may be entirely fictional because as far as we know dopson never had any intimate relations of any kind. At least that's what seems to be what is the great Dobson scholar Jasper pox haven has indicated pen and paper hand because it's time for this this week's recipe. Those of you who listened last week may may recognize that seems rather similar possibly to last week's recipe that's because I have a very limited calorie palate rather than palate. But this is a this is a great recipe for alphabet soup which was which was given to me by Ruth Dr. Ruth pastries system mod. A very good soup and I think you'll enjoy it. You can read the you can if you haven't got pen and paper. You know, if you can't take notes, you can always read about it on the website. And I'm sure you'll enjoy this nourishing soup. The ingredients one pound each of apricot breadcrumbs, coleslaw, dandelions, Edelweiss stalks, flapjacks, and goldfish brains. six tablespoons of honey, two ounces of ice. One pound each of Jackdaw feathers, ketchup, love lies, bleeding, marmalade, nugget, and oxalates one p, one tab of quick line, four ounces each of raisins spike nard and toffee, five teaspoons of unspeakable glue, one family size catering pack of vinegar, three whelks, as much xantham as you can stomach 12 packets of yeast and 44, zinnias and the method, pound everything beginning with a vow into a mulch, smear it onto the inside of a big bowl. Put the bowl somewhere safe and below freezing point for a week. Cut everything else up into chunks the size of a newborn baby's fist, then chargrill go and get the bowl and toss the trunks in haphazardly. Place the bowl under an outside spigot and filter the brim with water. Leave to stand for as long as you like. Depending on how hungry you are. Transfer to a cauldron. Bring to the boil and allow to simmer. Pour in some milk reboil indefatigably ladle off the scum from the top and serve with hibiscus clumps and cocoa and I do hope that you'll enjoy that. It's superb soap in fact, I had some just before arriving at the studio. Now the next the next part is the beginning of an exciting cereal, which in in subsequent weeks I hope to continue with with further episodes. This is a serial recounting the exploits of those those rather rather excitable twins Istvan undissolved ham and this is this is Episode One, which is a he's headed Tuesday afternoon. We're a bit of a weird daylight but nevermind. Crikey exclaimed this van. What in the name of Heaven is that?

his twin brother Zoltan looked up from the book. He was reading his van Calm down, he drove, you know, I hate to be interrupted in my reading, especially when the book in my hands is the journals of Gerard Manley Hopkins. And I've just got to the entry for that most exciting day, the 27th of April 1871, when the poet quote, mesmerized a duck with chalk lines drawn from her beak, sometimes level and sometimes forwards on a black table. Unquote. How on earth can you immerse yourself in the pros of that Victorian Jesuit screeched his van when I'm about to be waylaid by preposterously complicated mechanical contraption somehow imbued with almost human malevolence? Zoltan umed, I've long been fascinated by Jared Manley Hopkins, Harvard. Incidentally, were you aware Oh twin that the nuns who's drowning was commemorated in a majestic poem The wreck of the Deutsch land lie buried in St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Leytonstone, East London. And I have placed flowers on their grave peonies are recalled or may have they were pinks or pansies. eek yellow is van Zoltan cast his eyes in the direction indicated by the frantic gesticulations his twin brother made to compliment his frightful eek golly, gasps Zoltan. His eyes popping for traveling at inhuman speeds towards East van was a monstrous steam powered engine, bulky and strange, built of tungsten to titanium and tin and seemingly alive with a perplexing array of Hooters, leavers, flaps, nozzles chains, bleepers consoles, klaxons, trucks, struts, decoys, shields, Covington lenses, battery prongs, bits of corrugated cardboard, and McKenzie beans. It was the indigestion machine. And episode and the next episode of that exciting series should be should be next week. And so I found that I found a brief quote from from Virginia Woolf, which, which I found quite fascinating, actually. She said, I'll just find it. If you bear with me while I do my, when I do my paper shuffle, and it's from it's from, I think it's from her diaries from Virginia Woolf diaries, and one day, I don't know the date on which she wrote this. But she wrote in her diary, I think it is true that one gains a certain hold on sausage and Haddock by writing them down. Now, I've tried that myself. I wrote down sausage, and I wrote down Haddock and, you know, you know, something, I had a certain hold on them after that, you know, I did. So Virginia Woolf was was in fact correct. With that. Where are we time for time for time for one or two more things. And the first, the first is the first I've lost. I've got the beginning of the novel, not the second bit. So if I'll just find that talk among yourselves. While I do so. See, I've got my papers all out of order and this is a bad thing. I yes. This is a this is an exciting little yarm called the disgusting bilge of cadet Vig. cadet vigs bilge was disgusting. Most people remember him as the so called tiny cadet. But I always think of his bilge. He kept it in a pail in his locker. I wrote the sign for him it read cadet vigs locker, keep out my disgusting build us in here.

He wanted it printed in 24 points. gills songs condensed but I told him to shut up and scroll it with my nib. I'll tell you all about my never another time on a day when the astrological signs are favorable to my doing so, that is toxin in the fourth house with Jim Naka DS rising and CAC in the funnel of smooth. You know that our back headed man with the bandage dear. He tells me that that this conjunction of the stars is unlikely to occur for the next two school years and 10 so you'll have to be patient, just as cadet Vig was. I made him wait a year and a half of his sign suffering as I was from Winslow's and scrofula. But he never ever complained. I think that was admirable particularly for a cadet renowned for his rigor. Well, I should say for his rigor and his bilge, and indeed for his tireless. Gosh, was there ever a tinier cadet? I suspect not. I had my amanuensis crap trawl through the records just in case a cadet tinier than cadet, they had trodden these blue corridors at some time in the inconceivably distant past, perhaps during the time of the great dismal Thor, but alack Nothing was found. Now I sit slumped in my booth while staring at the one photograph of cadet vague in my possession. He has a full on expression in the picture, and looks as if he's chewing something or about to chew something, the air perhaps there is a hummingbird on his cap. But whether it's real or made of Styrofoam is hard to tell. The photograph is blurred. I try so hard to pin these things down in prose. But how could I ever compete with beer pints incredible poem? How did it go? The old rugged cross the cows in the field, something something and vague, something handmade that sandpaper. Crows have landed on the roof and I have work to do. And I think that's all from hooting yard for this week. We'll have some music and we'll be with you at the same time next week. So listening then and have a good rest of your day.
