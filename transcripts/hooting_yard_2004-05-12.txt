Boy Good afternoon. This is resonance FM. This is putting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. You know, I think I'll start again. hello darkness my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. I've had a nightmare about a hand. I've been abandoned in my pajamas in a desolate fan. The hand approached me clucking seldom have I heard so eldritch or cluck from a domestic foul. I was thoroughly unnerved. In the nightmare believing that I had a woken I was chewing my pillow and my mouth was full of feathers and I began to choke. But I did not wake. The hen pecked at something on the ground. I was no longer in a fan. I was standing in the middle of a field splattered with buttercups, holding a big iron slab of dubious utility. I looked at it very carefully, and saw that a stanza of Emily Dickinson's had been scratched on it. It's a little ether hood, death sit upon its head, the millenary supple of the sagacious God. Now I was spectacularly terrified. the belle of Amherst dream that had plagued me for two decades, until Dr. Snap prescribed his bomb and undulant had returned to haunt me. Somehow I was conscious that I was thrashing about in my bed, and yet I remained transfixed in sleep. The noise made by the hand grew louder knowing that quote, a hen who was merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid, unquote, Mark Twain. I looked desperately around me, though I could hear it for hen had vanished. The iron slab weighed heavy. Now I was knee deep in water. I began to shout, echoing Edgar Allan Poe's dying words. Reynolds, Reynolds. Reynolds. At the last cry mercifully, I woke, I jumped out of bed immediately and plunged my head into a nearby pile of icy water. Then I went to the window and looked out at the bright morning, rustic farmyard persons with trudging up the hill over by barges spinny, a boobie and a Godwin sang. Those are reportedly Edgar Allen's genuine final, famous last words Reynolds Reynolds Reynolds. Reynolds was apparently one of the people who propounded the theory about the earth being hollow, and there being entrances at the poles. And if you got in through the entrance of the pole, and you come upon a waste, ancient subterranean civilizations, signs or sins whole, I think they caught up to the person who first came up with the theory and was taken on by Reynolds and Poe became obsessed with Reynolds. But enough of that, that was one of a number of pieces that begins a kind of variation on a famous song. And I think a couple of weeks ago, I did Ground Control to Major Tom, and there might be another one of those coming up. First of all, well, I'd like to read you. Tell You About two palms. Vonn pig flask palm there is named for Horst Helmut von pig flask, the noted percussionist who created his own Sonic universe, using just a couple of biscuit tins, a thermos flask half full of milk, and a few odds and ends scavenged from a rusting ship. For milk he famously declared, must be sour, or at least four days sour or it has no tar, no tan

At one time at a picture I have the same mass a dockyard drinking dens as that scallywag Lothar preen. We heard all about him last week. Vaughn pig flask had a huge falling out with his mentor on the 12th of October 1959. Despite both protagonists, keeping voluminous, if not to say obsessive diaries, neither of them has a word to say about this incident. preens journal entry for the day is the usual vain self serving serving hyperbole. While pomp Vaughn pig floss writes simply a long list of farm implements annotated with pencil drawn symbols. What can it all mean? The sad thing is that no one then or now ever really cared. On the following day following this altercation Vaughn pig flowers Carter dingey, from one of his disreputable acquaintances put out the sea and vanished. Perhaps because his police files had been mislaid his absence went unremarked, and certainly there is no trace of him whatsoever, until at some point in the late 1960s, when reports began to circulate that he was a founding member of the blues rock pioneers blood wind pig. To this day, the other original members of the band Mick Abraham's jack Lancaster, Andy Pyle and Ron Burge. Did I ever having heard of the great percussionist, let alone giving him free rein with his tins and his flask and his rusty flotsam on their debut album, a head rings out from 1968. There is no doubt however, that it was Vaughn pig Clarke himself who appeared unannounced on stage at the 1974 Jazz Festival in a room, where he performed a very brief In fact, 16 second untitled improvisation before scuttling away into the tenebrous German Twilight. Two more years passed before his triumphant return to the world stage, the patching up of his differences with low thought praying, and the air splitting genius of his late work in 1996, by now aged and suffering increasingly from the bindings. He retired and settled in Winnipeg. His final years were spent on the upper floors of a gleaming skyscraper, where he took great pleasure in his pet tortoise, and worked away for hours and hours every day, on a seemingly endless list of anagrams of pol pot. Ayn Rand, you thant and of course, Yoko Ono and the other pond we're gonna look at today is stagnant, Inky, black fathomless spooky pond. How ill named it is tiny ones may well flee screaming from fiendish pond, but not from here. On the contrary, it's not uncommon for beetles and matrons from the parish home for poor wretched mud splattered orphans to bring their charges here for an afternoon of gambling frolic. Oh, how the air rings with the joyous cries of the tots as they play, pin the paper to the cardboard, sitting at the edge of the pond with their grubby little feet splashing in the water. How they gobble down their small tin bowls of custard and watercress with toothsome relish. If you as an adult, dear listener, need to have your hearts cockles warmed. Why not join one of the regular shower bank excursions which relief from hemoglobin towers at noon every Thursday and witness this scene for yourself. The cost is reasonable. And if you bring your own pack lunch, you can even join in the antics. But pray heaven that you do not give credence to the correspondent to the hooting er B, who wrote a Farago of nonsense about getting bats in tangled in his hair. Normal you listen to malicious gossip about the pond being riddled with vivid blue, poisonous toads. a brisk walk around the pond will soon diffuse the diesel for fumes from the bank, and you will no longer have a headache. You can of course, instead of listening to this, you can read all of this stuff on the hooting yard website. I'll give you the I'll give you the address and I happen to have because I get I get I get very bored with that dot business in website addresses. So we have that instead. And that good. I'll have that when I do that. That will be a dot and the address is Yeah, there's no www I'm just trying to remember this. There's no www just go straight to hooting yard users

bt open world calm and forget that last little bit there. That was me putting it down. So go there and you can you can have a read of all this stuff and also take part in exciting competitions like like this word game, which I'm about to tell you that listeners who listened to on a few weeks ago now, I talked about the game, john fouls opoli, which you had to you had to write a very brief story suitable for a bedtime story for children. Making use of nine, I think it was nine adjective from a quotation. And today I'm going to introduce you to an even more thrilling game, which is called Andrew motion opoli. That's one word. And again, the idea is to compose a text which contains all the adjectives in a prescribed list. But this time, the challenge is to compose a poem worthy of of our Titanic, the talented Poet Laureate, Andrew motion, any of you who read his works will know exactly what I mean. The quotation is two sentences from an essay written by Raymond black white, called George grossmith and the humor of him, which is quite an interesting construction. George grossmith, of course, brother of Weeden. The two of them wrote The Diary of a nobody. Anyway, here's Raymond black, white on George grossmith, and the humor of him. little slight man with a thin, clever mobile, clean shaven face, a sharp, inquisitive nose surmounted by a perpetual err, pair of pants Nay, and a rather sarcastic mouth, from which wit and humor as light and areas the cigarette smoke which accompanied each remark continually flowed. He stands on the hearth rug of his own special sanctum in his handsome house in Dorset square, with his back to the fire cigarette in his mouth, his hand now in his pocket, now waving in the air, as he vivaciously tells me the story of his busy, energetic and wonderfully interesting life. 17 adjectives in two sentences, it's pretty good going, I think, anyway, to help readers who want who wants to join in and contribute versus or doggerel to a forthcoming Andrew motion opoli anthology. Here are those adjectives in alphabetical order all 17 of them get your pens and papers please. And right down very carefully. airy, busy, clean shaven. Clever, energetic, handsome, inquisitive. Interesting. Light, little mobile, perpetual, sarcastic, sharp, slight, special, and thin. Those are the 17 adjectives. Your poem can be as long as you like, so long as you include all of the adjectives which must appear once and once only an extra admiration will be showered upon entries which include the non-compulsory phrase waving in the air, so set to work. One of the other things you'll be able to read on the on the website is well it's out of date now because I wrote it last week and nothing's happened unfortunately, I'll tell you all about is a bit of a bit of a sob story. The fact that I never received a reply Alomar just have a little sip of water. See, I thought everything was going to change when I posted a letter last week. And now a weeks gone by no news. So I've given up anyway, I'll read the letter to you.

Dear L'Oreal, I would like to apply to become the new face of L'Oreal. As I think we both know that the model and actress Andie McDowell has been hanging on to the role for too long. You probably think that I'm unsuitable as I'm a man who does not actually use your product. And my hair is fairly short, at least in comparison to Andy's. So I won't be able to do that here too. tossing thing very effectively. I can toss my head though, where I think I could really make a difference is in my ability to speak the part of the script that includes the scientific information. You know, and and i enclosed with the Well, I'll tell you what I wrote, I enclose a tape recording of one of my practice runs. And I think you'll be impressed at the bit where I say, now with reduced pH values and clinically tested Norwegian molecule balancing agent as for the punch line, because I'm worth it. I think there's an opportunity here to diversify and create some new catchphrases, which will soon be on the lips of millions of people worldwide. as I've indicated, when I toss my head, my hair doesn't do that sinuous flowing Andy thing. So it looks as if I've got some kind of nervous tic. Well, let's use that. Imagine the end of the advert. I toss my head and say, L'Oreal because I've got ergot poisoning, or L'Oreal because I've got Tourette syndrome. It's a winner. I look forward to receiving my contract in the post. You're sincerely Frank key. As I say, I haven't received a thing. And I'm very sad about that. But what can you do? You know, I tried. I tried. One of the thing about the pond mentioned an orphanage, and I've been accused by one reader of the website of writing far too much about orphanages which is interesting given that I'm one of at least 17 children. Anyway, this is Pang Hill news. What what what has Pang Hill orphanage burned to the ground again? famous cease the use of blubber candles forthwith. I know sexual lighting is cheap. But three conflagrations in as many months is evidence of sheer stupidity. At least the tinies were ushered to safety scampering around the duck pond in their tunics, while Mr. von stroheim tried to gather them together for counting. But why on earth did he think that asking, asking them to sing Conquistador by Procol Harum would become them. Alas, that had the usual effect, and instead of a placid duck pond dangers worth of orphans neatly lined up. He had to deal with tears and wailing and breast beating and religious fervor and mischeif and duck taunting and drenching and jiggery pokery and panic and hopelessness and fisticuffs and spillages and mitten loss. The reporter from the weekly shackle, observed only one child filling a pail with duck pond water and carrying over to the orphanage to combat the flames. Such a heroic little tot, I shall make sure he's given a new pair of socks. And it wasn't his fault that the bottom of the pail was half eaten away with rust, and that by the time he crossed the prize, winning Condoleezza Rice flower garden, and with within yards of the Inferno, there were only a few meager droplets of water left and a fat lot of us they were as, quote, brilliant orange flames licked and cold around the charred cinders of what had once been Pang hills finest orphanage. Unquote. Surely the flames would have died down by the time they were seniors to be seen. But anyway, that's a quote from the reporter. And man who knows his onions or so I've been told. Apparently the dispatches who sent from the budget spinny beehive building competition was so well written that he was offered a job on the daily agony in the garden, but he turned it down, unwilling to leave Pang Hill, who snowdrops cow parsley and flocks soothed his nerves, he said, and he was fearful that if he did not daily look upon them, he would be burdened and turn into a splinter brain. As for the Craven, Mr. von stroheim I'm going to have his guts for garters when I lay my hands on him.

Recently, a couple of weeks ago, I think it may have been that I updated, updated you on what was going on with Mrs gubbins who's on the run from the police. We've we've received a few tatty pages smuggled from our hideaway apparently written by Mrs. gubbins herself, letting us know how she's getting on. So I'll read them to you. Never before heard actually online on any news program. Friday, soup for breakfast. Duck with broken leg outside hat. I brought it inside and fashioned a splint with some hairpins and elastic bands. It's called Agamemnon. Saturday. My mind is a terrific bunch. They've taken to wearing ribbons in their filthy hair and chewing cheer roots. This afternoon there was a short gun battle with some police officers. We one Sunday, by happenstance, one of my gang is a priest, so we were able to celebrate mass. For the sacrament, we used what was left of a stolen packet of questions, and a 10 mug of duck pond water had to do instead of wine. Monday, I have been passing the time by reading a stash of old Dobson pamphlets. I was particularly taken with 202 spurious Latin names for birds together with a meditation upon a sheet of corrugated cardboard. I read it out to one of the minders and he started to translate it into Tagalog Tuesday. P what's on roof? That was yesterday. So you know, maybe next week we'll have more from from Mrs. gubbins. And I can keep you informed of how she's getting on, as I'm sure that you'll be very interested to know. Next, next, next, next, this this is uh should we do? I know what would I was asked one of the one of the people who both reads the website and listens to the show. hooting out on the air, which we're listening to now said that they were very interested in not having sort of behind the scenes look at how the show is made. So I'll tell you, I'll tell you, four or five hours before transmission time, the recording studio is thoroughly disinfected by a crack squad of specialist cleaning workers dressed in what looked like astronauts outfits. They're armed with a panoply of highly intriguing tools, instruments and tweezers, many of which have no apparent purpose. The HQ of resonance FM is summary there's no located in a subterranean basement far far below the London streets and is only accessible via an underground pneumatic capsule railway system last used in the 1880s but which has been preserved like a fly in Amber, by a group of enthusiasts all of whom by weird coincidence, and I'm Tim, as their fathers were before them. When disinfection is complete, other preparations are made and take Bakelite canisters are distributed to dozens of eager fact totems. Or should that be fact tota. Grease pans handled by imperious and jewel dappled kitchen staff, a loaded into magnificent neoclassical oven like pods of questionable a remarkable significance. any stray toads are ushered violently from workspaces. xylophone abandoned after an earlier program is yanked off its hinges and holds zestfully into a yellow xylophone waste bin. Waste VAT sorry. Urgent telecommunication signals are read and reread quickly then plastered onto oblong cards which are nailed to murals in one of the many lobbies not to tide in jumpers. incredibly huge golden flaps have to be emblazoned with diamond patterns. The dank cellar of the building is then aired. listeners are often surprised to learn that Frankie does not actually appear on the show himself. His place is taken by an actor named Ludovico boo speaking bull the ability to mimic the vocal inflections of anyone who chooses to his matchless and he's had a long and successful career doing so. Other impersonations he's assayed include sir Isaiah Berlin, Tuesday Weld, both Richard and Karen Carpenter

For security purposes, a different Terminus is chosen each week. That decision being made by the tropper pilot during the flight safely in scars ensconced in the resonance FM HQ bullies handed the week script together with the meal he insists on as part of it. contract for bloaters a bowl of boiling hot custard, bread crumb Flan and a drug of thoroughly diluted potato extract, wiping his mouth on a monogram napkin. Ball then enters the studio and begins to read. So there's some useful background information for you. And I did say that I was going to read another of those kind of things that things that things that begin like a song, but I'm not going to I've decided instead I'm going to read you a sermon, a sermon which was delivered at the funeral of the Finnish polymath last talc. And it was transcribed by one of the other one of the mourners, so even today, were able to recreate it. And here it is, spoken as it was by the Reverend true I think it was. I better just have a little sip of water and then I will begin.

Dearly beloved. We are gathered here in memory of Lars talc. How can I do justice to the memory of such a man? Well, let me say this, he owed me a great deal of money. He was covered in dust. He couldn't tell the difference between a Heron and a more hand, he never learned the rules of ice hockey. He was often plagued by mysterious boils. He had a scar on his left chin. He confused the different metallic elements. His hair was often unkempt, he set fire to a Bible. His pigs were neglected. adept at ping pong. He waited his bat. He wants suffered from scruffy color. his tent had many holes. He never wore a hat. His gas bills drove him crackers. He spoke umpteen languages. His mother told me he was terrified of swans. Geology was beyond him. He hankered for doilies. He counted toads. His bath was made of tin. His first marriage was disastrous. He could not ride a bicycle. He spat out mayonnaise. He avoided paying for hotel rooms by clambering down fire escapes. Once he built his own bridge. He burned himself in effigy. He loved to eat turn it he often drooled his thumbs were deformed, rust and rhyme engaged as attention. He was much traveled. He designed his own pen nibs. He kept a photograph of Ricardo montell Bahn in his Bureau. his eyesight was atrocious. Candles have been lit for him. His credentials were spotless. He punched a fishmonger he gutted hearts link to slither down his throat. He owned dozens of fret saws. He thought the moon was his lover, in Didcot, he wept. He fled, he fed flamingos with cream crackers. in certain circles, his name was mad. He kept his gut a purchase in a gunny sack. The site of geese made him anxious, he smoked two routes, he recounted toads, he held off the blubber lantern on the banks of a duck pond. His saliva was bitter. taxes were levied upon him. He had a zest for crumpled things. in parks, he pondered. He bit his fingernails, he chewed spinach. At a pinch, he would talk for hours on the subject of straw. He wiped his bottom with leaves. He wrote a book about gnats, he mumbled through a chub. Things dangled from the ceiling of his booth while he lost on the horses, he wrapped a tortoise in blankets. As a youth he survived on crusts. His father painted difficult maps. Often he behaved like a madman, twigs and branches fell unremarked in his garden. rowing held no early or for him. He dabbed at his brow with ointments. He was fond of cormorants. He coaxed mice from their nooks. He was knocked down by a runaway bus, clods of Earth surrounded him, he could be petulant, he strained things in a Muslim net, he pulverize the diving board with his bare hands. Morse code baffled him, he nearly became a Marine, he moved his arms towards the lake. Under a cow tower. He looked at planks. He overcame his stutter. His sheep had worms he crossed himself he played at Bagatelle he spied a crocus he fainted. He snored. He panted. He sprayed his stomach, his hearing aid his cuffs his gristle, his pants. His batteries. His hardship is chutney his parts his Windows has calcium, his rubbers, his vinegar, his seeds, his nettles, his soles, his stall his plastic his incandescence, autumn shipwreck curtains exile frost balconies pandemonium Hydros banisters carpets hinges, remembrance, hair, custard, dribble, fanfares dampness, bauxite, trousers, canal boss Gage, lasciviousness tunics, spigots, iron cranks, floozies, doppelgangers 10. bales agony loss.
