Good afternoon. This is resonance 104 point four FM. It's four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon in London. And my name is Frankie. And this is that time of the week when you can have a long soak in that kind of verbal bath of acids milk that is hooting yard. This week that kind of combination of all of new brand new stuff, in some cases, brand new as in this morning, and old favorites which had been requested by various listeners, but I thought I'd begin by just discussing one of the most dog names dog names. I've often thought that one of the ambitions for hooting yard is to become a kind of all encompassing encyclopedia. Last week, the listeners may recall, there was an item about the introduction of starlings into North America, this week from starlings to dogs. One of the most common misconceptions in the world of dog nomenclature is the idea that many dogs bear the name Fido because it's Latin meaning I trust or I am faithful, has some bearing on perceptions of canine personality. Dobson for one saw through this nonsense, as he explained in his out of print pamphlet, on the naming of curves as Fido, a stern corrective and he wrote as follows. One never seems to occur to people is that there is not one single recorded instance of any dog being called Fido prior to World War Two. This Stark fact alone is surely all the evidence any rational person needs to realize that dogs are named Fido in honor of the petroleum warfare department's successful development of the fog intensive dispersal of system otherwise known as Fido. I can't be bothered to go into the details of how in 1944 boffins managed to make mist and fog vanish for all the world like medieval magicians, but they did. God knows they did. Furthermore, the connection between dogs and fog is well known as anyone who has studied some of my earlier pamphlets will no The only is very good. The only problem with that is that much as one admires the magisterial tone of Dobson's pronouncement, he's, of course completely mistaken about there not being any pre Second World War dogs called Fido. Nevermind. starlings last week, dogs this week, where will we go next? Who knows. Next up, it's quite a while since I've read one of those pieces where I only wrote half of it. And the other half is from an entirely different source. In other words, every other sentence has been inserted from an original text has been inserted. This is a piece called escape from a ship on fire. Every other sentence in it is from an essay of that title in the missionary annual for 1833. And it goes as follows it's very exciting, I think, escape from a ship on fire.

There were about four score of us to use biblical numbers. Many of the party having retired to their hammocks soon after the commencement of the storm were only partially closed when they made their escape. But the see men on the watch, in consequence of a heavy rain, having cased themselves in double or treble dresses supplied their supernumerary articles of clothing to those who had none. I myself gave my hood made out of compressed wheat to a Jesuit priest who had been taking confessions from the stowaways when the tempest struck. We happily succeeded in bringing away two campuses from the binnacle and a few candles from the caddy table. One of them lighted, one bottle of wine and another of Porter were handed to us with the tablecloth and a knife, which proved very useful, but the fire raged so fiercely in the body of the vessel, that neither bread nor water could be obtained. We were able to turn the tablecloth into a makeshift tarpaulins. And I chuckled at the appropriateness of its embroidered scene of ducks clashing in a pond. The rain still poured in tarrance the lightning followed by loud bursting of thunder continue to stream from one side of the heavens to the other. One moment dazzling us by its glare on the next moment, leaving us in darkness, relieved only by the red flames of the conflagration from which we were endeavoring to escape. Verily, it was like come to the fires of hell, the flaming pit, and it would be no exaggeration to say that the licking flames took on the appearance of fiends with pitchforks to poke at the damned. Our first object was to proceed to a distance from the vessel less she should explode and overwhelm us. But to our inexpressible distress, we discovered that the y'all had no rudder, and that for the two boats, we had only three oars. Those were the oars I had vanished back in port. All exertions to obtain more from the ship proved unsuccessful. The accurate stench of burning ores and rudders and tallow and chandlery assailed us. For gig had a rather from this they threw out a rope to take us in tow. And by means of a few paddles made by tearing up the lining of the boat, we assisted in moving ourselves slowly through the water. I tried to keep up our spirits by singing a shanty, but my voice was cracked and broken, and I got no further than the first nine stanzas providentially the sea was comparatively smooth, or overloaded boats would have swamped and we should only have escaped the flames have perished in the deep. Throughout my life I had suffered from nightmares wherein I was gobbled up in the jaws of some eldritch aquatic being resembling a giant squid with pulsating suckers. And now I feared that all those tossing and turning nights had been a premonition of my actual doom. The wind was light but variable and acting on the sails which, being drenched with the rain did not soon take fire, drove the burning mass in terrific Granger over the surface of the ocean, the darkness of which was only illuminated by the quick glancing of the lightning of a glare of the conflagration. But what could account for the hissing and see the noises, like 1000 deranged baby pigs, now soft, now definitely loud, which seemed to be pursuing us in our hectic progress. Our situation was for some time, extremely perilous. damnable see. The vessel near does more than once and apparently threatened to involve us in one common destruction. Great crashing waves tumbled over us, and we give it in terror. Then one old salts developed a massive nosebleed which he tried to staunch with a roll of bandage he had looted from the person's cabin. Just before we abandon ship. He knew he would hang for theft, but a brute sense of survival had him pulling out an oar with one hand and fumbling with the bandage with the other.

The cargo consisting of dry provisions, spirits, cotton goods, and other articles equally combustible burned with great violence, while the fury of the destroying elements, the amazing height of the flames, the continued storm, amidst the thick darkness of the night, rendered the scene appalling and terrible. I noticed that even in the midst of this mayhem, our ships artists, Binney was scribbling frantically in his tattered and seawater soaked sketchpad, drawings which would one day go on show at some godforsaken seaside Museum, I'm visited and sung. About 10 o'clock the masks of the swaying from side to side fell with a dreadful crash into the sea, and the hull of the vessel continued to burn amidst the shattered fragments of the wreck till the sides was consumed to the water's edge. At five past 10, an angel appeared momentarily in the black forbidding sky, or it might have been a Guillemot. The spectacle was truly magnificent. Could it even have been contemplated by us without a recollection of our own circumstances? those circumstances were perilous indeed, only once before had I been involved in a burning shipwreck, and that had been child's play in comparison. The torment enjoyed by the dogs, sheep and other animals on board, as any other time would have excited about. deepest commiseration, but at present the object before us our stately ship that had for the last four months been our social home for seen of our enjoyments, our labors and our rest. Now a prayed of the destroying element. The suddenness with which we have been hurried from circumstances of comfort and comparative security to those of destitution and peril, and with which the most exhilarating hopes had been exchanged for disappointment, as unexpected as it was afflictive the sudden death of the two seamen our own narrow escape and lonely situation on the face of the deep, and the great probability, even yet, although we had succeeded in removing to a greater distance from the vessel, that we ourselves should never again see the light of day or set foot on solid ground, absorbed every feeling, every feeling that is except one, and it may be that I speak only for myself, but among the jumble of terror and loss and despair and Whoa, I yet had a vision of the pantry in my parents pie shop. It shelves stacked with jar upon jar of pickled and jelly blubber products, which remarkably, even in this ferocious capitalism, made my mouth water. For some time, the silence was scarcely broken, and the thoughts of many I doubt not, we're engaged on subjects most suitable to immortal beings on the brink of eternity. I myself took comfort in my pie shop pantry thoughts. The number of persons in the two boats was 48. And all with the exception of the two ladies who bought this severe visitation with uncommon fortitude, worked by turns at the oars and paddles good Victorians that they were despite it being the year 1963 the lady's dance socks and queued gentle hymns as the storm blustered around us. After some time, to our great relief, the rain ceased. The labor of bailing water from the boats was then considerably diminished. Our feet nevertheless were drenched, except for those of the wily sailor who had smeared the lower half of his body with balls grease.

We were frequently hailed during the night by our companions in the small boat, and returned the call, while the brave and generous hearted Seaman occasionally enlivened the solitude of the deep by a simultaneous Hurrah to cheer each other's labors and to animate their spirits. Throwing ping pong balls to each other across the storm tossed seas was another way of coping with our predicament. But Tang jaw rose in the water, as its contents were gradually consumed. The flames roared pitilessly. We saw it burning the whole night, and at daybreak could distinguish a column of smoke which, however, soon ceased, and every sign of our favorite vessel disappeared. Dawn was approaching. When the sun rose, our anxiety and uncertainty as to our situation, were greatly relieved by discovering land ahead. The sight of it filled us with grateful joy, and nervous with fresh vigor for the exertion required in managing the boats. I wondered if by some freak of chance, we had lit upon the island of abundant spinach, of which I had so often read. With the advance of the day we discerned more clearly the nature of the country. Alas, it was wild and covered with jungle without any appearance of population. Could we have got ashore therefore, many of us might have perished before assistance could have been procured. But the breakers dashing upon the rocks, convinced us that landing was in practicable stuck in our boats. We try to chat about mundane things, railway timetables, soup recipes, the film career of Rex Harrison, in the course of the morning, we discovered a native vessel or Dhoni lying at anchor at some distance, the wind at that time beginning to favor us, every means was devised to render it available. By now most of us were too exhausted to Rome, even the sailor with the nosebleed who had collapsed and was lying in the bottom of the boat for all the world like a fell marble statue of a magnificent God. In the y'all, we extended the tablecloth as a sail and then the other boat a blanket serve the same purpose. I have not mentioned a blanket before for reasons which even the most astute reader can only get at. Let us just say that this blanket warp and weft when not of this earth, nor have any imaginable planet. This additional help was, the more seasonable as the rays of the sun had become almost intolerable to our partially covered bodies. despite there being a gang of violent pagan some worship as a board, we cursed that brighten battering orb. Some of the seamen attempted to quench their thirst by salt water, but the passengers encouraged each other to abstain. It is astonishing how determined one can be if faced with a crack on the skull from a gas canister. about noon we reached the Dhoni, every last one of us had survived that terrible night. The natives on board were astonished and alarmed at our appearance, and expressed some willingness to receive us. But our circumstances would admit of no denial, and which ghastly waited till our single ease fellow passenger could interpret to them our situation and our wants, before we ascended the sides of their vessel, assuring them that every expense and loss sustained on our account should be amply repaid. The very next day, I set sail once more alone, bound for Greenland, little knowing that I would twice more be imperiled on the vast and thundering ocean, dashed against rocks and almost drowned in the bilgewater. Before I would once again step over the threshold of my parents pie shop. The prodigal daughter returning to her shriveled and infected parents home, home from the sea.

Okay. Next, where are the snows of yesteryear? The snows of yesteryear have been safely bagged up in burlap sacks and placed in a frozen pit. Am I allowed to remove one of the sacks from the pit? You may remove one sack from the frozen pit if authorized to do so. How do I gain authorization? You may gain authorization by prostrating yourself before a plinth a top which stands are robot duck the control mechanisms of which have been deactivated. Why have the control mechanisms of the robot duck being deactivated? The control mechanisms of the robot duck has been deactivated because a bug in the program meant that the duck was prone to fits of illogical and haphazard scampering about and it's great size and sharp metal feathers in peril the people out strolling in the vicinity of the plinth, forcing them to jump into the flower beds. Much soil was scattered and strewn and flowers would have been damaged had any remained in the beds. Where have all the flowers gone? The flowers have been plucked from their beds with botanic pincers and removed to a place of safety. Are you allowed to divulge the location of the flowers? The current location of the flowers rescued from the rampages of the robot duck is top secret. Is there a blue daliah among the flowers? There is not a blue daliah among the flowers for all the flowers are chrysanthemums, every last man jack of them. Whoever people you mentioned strolling in the vicinity of the plinth that people strolling in the vicinity of the plinth, a top which stands at the activated robot duck include two famous campaign ologists and organ grinder and many people who resemble koala bears. Was that a full and Frank answer to my question? That was a partial answer. Full and Frank details of all those strolling can be accessed in a database maintained online www dot Blodgett global domination.com forward slash plinths forward slash robot duck forward slash vicinity forward slash passes by forward slash missed dot html. What on earth has Blodgett got to do with this? There is no fleck of human activity which has not been dangled from the fingertips of Blodgett. How do you dangle a flat? flex dangled by Blodgett with dang global flex? Did Blodgett ever meet Starling? Blodgett met Starling on a number of occasions, either at Stalin's dacha or Blodgett abandoned gasworks. Their meetings were generally both convivial and fraught, varying from conviviality to fruitless and back again within seconds. They also kept up a hectic correspondence, which has not yet seen the light of day. Did Blodgett allow Starling to dangle some of his flex? Starling dangled many of blogilates flex, but only after issuing a use case, which forced Blodgett hand. Was Blodgett still alive when Starling died in 1953. Blodgett was still alive at the time of Stalin's death, but he died soon afterwards. What was the cause of Blodgett death? The cause of Blodgett His death was calendar. What is calendar?

Frank Key  21:53
calendar is the name given to various fevers occurring in the tropics, especially to a form of furious delirium accompanied by fever among sailors, which sometimes lead the affected person to imagine the sea to be a green field and to throw himself into it. That is how Blodgett died. Where is Blodgett buried? Blodgett remains were interred in the same frozen pit where in lie the burlap sacks containing the snows of yesteryear. Does that mean that if I prostrate myself in front of the plinth, a top which stands the deactivated robot duck and gain permission to remove one of the burlap sacks of snow from the frozen pit? I could at the same time pay obedience to the relics of Blodgett? Yes.

Have you or someone you know, got a great anecdote about gigantic balls of volatile gas? why not share it with our listeners? at one time or another, all of us have been confronted by unimaginably vast orbs of gas glowing, perhaps or even pulsating, eerily as if about to explode, unleashing destruction and doom. It seems a shame to keep your experience to yourself. Perhaps you were traumatized and begin to juber and draw when recollecting what happened. Or maybe you've tried to shut out the memory entirely so that only in your nightmares Do you revisit the scene? Whatever your own way of dealing with monstrous bright spherical gas phenomena. We'll be pleased to hear from you. The most riveting submissions will be collected in a forthcoming hooting yard anthology for which we've already signed up Perry Como to write the preface. Some some listeners will be aware that Mr. Como unfortunately crossed to the other side on the 18th of may 2001. He will be dictating his preface via an angel to a spirit medium yet to be appointed. Possibly Yoko Ono

More factual information now we've had we I thought might wait until next week to follow on from starlings and the naming of dogs. But this is just too good. the continent of America takes its name from Amery go the spooky, but here are hooting yard we've decided to promote the case for did three pining and hands pot Horst 16 years before Columbus, this pair of roguish German pirates may well have been the first Europeans to set foot in the New World, alongside yohannes coldness, a Polish seafarer who may or may not have existed in the first place. While he deitrick and Hans kept getting chased further north by the Danes, and they regularly sailed to Greenland to be piratical. It's thought that they might have accidentally blended ashore in Labrador in 1476. Whether they did or not, the United States of pining and pot horse land seems to me to be a far more evocative name than the United States of America. So that's how we will henceforth refer to it. Incidentally, some years after this voyage, pining and potholes settled on a rock called vit Sark, somewhere off the coast of Iceland. And according to allow us Magnus, the Archbishop of Uppsala, in his historia de gente bus septentrionalis bus published in Rome in 1555. pining and potholes, lived there, outlawed with their fellow rovers and inflicted many atrocities on every seafarer whether sailing close at hand or at a distance. And they built a lead compass atop the rock to help them in determining the shortest direction to go in their profitable plundering forays. This compass can be seen in an absolutely superb map of Scandinavia, made by a Laos Magnus in 1539, and published very excitingly in boom, the map the map is on is on the internet, and there's a link to it from the hooting yard website. So if you go to hooting yard at the usual address, which you should know by now, but I'll tell you anyway, it's hooting.yard.users.bt openworld.com. And you look at the you look at the entries on the hooting yard site for Thursday, the second of September, just almost a week ago, you will find not only not only a link to this great map of Scandinavia, but also a little extract from it. And you'll also find the full text of fear of squirrels, which are read to you last week, and that's about it for this week, I think. Oh, just one other item I mentioned last week that I was I was doing a one of my rare public readings next set on Saturday the 18th of September at the crypt in Camberwell and I promise to tell you much more about that this week. But I still don't really know much more while I do but I've forgotten and who else the name of the band that that I'm appearing with. But I will tell you next week so that Saturday the 18th in Camberwell if you're in London, you can come and listen bye
