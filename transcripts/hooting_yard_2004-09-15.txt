Good afternoon. It's hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. Before we get on to the main bulk of the show, many listeners will no doubt be wondering what's happened to our Bulgarian friend who go back in Plovdiv. ogo won a hooter as a booby prize. Who go tooted his hooter in his blind Mars ear. Ugo said who goes Ma, that hooter makes a din. It's a hooter. Ma. I wanted a booby prize, said, ooh, go. And what did your power off when Ugo asked? Ooh, goes Ma, shelling peas as she spoke. off one or toy wolf ma said, ooh, go. It's as noisy as my booby prize hooter. Because when you press your thumb on it, Tom, the toy wolf for OAuth one roars Ooh, go to today's hooter again, and ran off to find off on a very wet Tuesday, near the old fort in Plovdiv.

And next, people who've visited the hooting yard website will know that virtually the first thing seen on the website is the search engine lady or the legendary hooting yard search engine you're designed really to pull in people from all over the internet who may be putting likely things into Google or some other search engine. And it struck me that I've never read this on the on the show before. So that's what I'm going to do now. And if any listeners have any ideas for other words that they think ought to appear in it, please let me know. This is the who's in yard search engine, your duffle coat.

This is an exciting story called the lactose intolerant Jessica bell of bothnia. Her impending flu jab and the howling of wolves at dusk. pins, pins, pins, muttered chlamydia, as she marched about the hotel lobby thinking about embroidery project for jezza Bella bothnia needed something to take her mind off her impending flu jab for the very thought of injections, made her wins, wins and national teeth, wins a national teeth and shutter wins and natural teeth and shutter and shake Windsor natural teeth and shutter and shake and sometimes even swoon and she did not want to swoon here in the hotel lobby. So she concentrated hard on her embroidery project. Why one a depiction of the crushing of the fashion guru by drub age in 1864. Too much Ivy and elecampane twirled around the tower. Three, a set of tea towels showing Rex Harrison with each of his wives, including additional fictional wives fermented in Class D his brain clavia had named them whore tense, Flopsy, and Gar. Her flu jab was imminent, because clarity is dr was famed throughout bothnia. For her unparalleled preventative techniques. She had devised a shedule of inoculations for all her patients, not just clavia and none of them had fallen victim to influenza. diphtheria, plague tappings for dang or Callen, chia for years. clavia had more than once asked Dr. dacoit if there was anything she could do about her lactose intolerance, and the good doctor was working on it. She had suggested the regular application of an experimental poultice but that had not been a success, and Claudia found that her temper was frayed rather more often than usual. After sitting with the poultice on her brow for a few hours. The hotel lobby was hot and had many flies in it. Clap they left the hotel to have her flu jab. Afterwards, she spent some time traipsing aimlessly by the canal, then picked up some groceries from the grocery and made her way home armed with ob jeans and beetroot and custard and a disco dancing CD and eggplant and few towel dreams of being plucked from her futile existence in bothnia. And as she tried the familiar path home, wolves howled. Wolves howled in the night. Just like wolves always do.

This is a piece that I have read a couple of short extracts from before in the past, but I thought the time was appropriate to read the entire thing. And this is this is called the names of the ponds. The first pond is called postage stamp pond, not as one might think due to its timeliness for it is indeed a tiny pond. But because it was the scene of the 1898 postage stamp riots, you will recall from your schoolbooks, that the introduction of a new machine at the sorting office lead to unrest. The second pond is named me jaw pond, which is thought to be a corruption of the name major your Mr. Your was a balladeer and minstrel of the last century now largely forgotten. Although there exists a dwindling band of devotees who gather together underneath the railway bridges and viaducts to stink to sing extemporary versions of his profound meditation upon vapidity, Vienna, it means nothing to me. appropriately enough, this pond is unfathomably deep. The third pond, everybody's favorite is called Pando cakes. It was in this pond on a teeming Day in April in the year of the Munich air disaster, that a canister of protoplasmic goo from another dimension was found in the fishing net of a little tyke called Sheva. Next, Perkins. Young Perkins was the only begotten Son of the disgraced insecticide merchant slocan Burgess Perkins, late, not of this parish, but of another parish entirely, where eldritch groans and wailings would often be heard emerging from dilapidated barn yards and abandoned bomb shelters, the likes of which the groans and wailings that is no human ear or ever be suffered to hear in this brief mortal existence. I'm sorry about that sentence It was a translation from Hungarian. Little Sheva next gave his find to the museum at or near the gruesome cops at ACC, from where it has since disappeared. pond number four was for a long time nameless, but has recently been dubbed birds pond, because of the masonry pillar just to the north, on which is inscribed this sentence from an 1877 book by john barrows called birds and poets. The defiant scream of the hawk circling aloft, the wild Winnie of The Loon, the whooping of the crane, the booming of the bittern, Val pine bark of the eagle, that allowed trumpeting of the migratory geese sounding down out of the midnight sky, or by the seashore, the coast of New Jersey or Long Island, the wild crooning of the flux of goals repeated continued by the hour swirling sharp and shrill, rising and falling like the wind in a storm, as they circle above the beach, or dip to the dash of the waves are much more welcome in certain moods than any and all mere bird melodies, in keeping as they are with the Shaggy and untamed features of ocean and woods, and suggesting something like the Richard Wagner music in the ornithological orchestra. The fifth pond, worse things happen at sea pond is barely what you would call a pond at all. It has been called a puddle. Some have dubbed it a mere one authority on landlocked pools of water has called it a town or be inactive. inaccurately as it is at or at least near sea level, it would appear that the Appalachian authority is that equally inaccurate. Although few have questioned it as the pond boffin concerned is none other than cloris. priene niece of the notorious Lothar preen and ex wife of a beetle brown terps magnate hengest shad,

Cloris Prinze, universal gadgeteer of ponds, mirrors and similar bodies of water across the globe, indexed by depth, hue and mean temperature with 1000s of diagrams, and lots and lots of exciting maps is reputedly the longest single volume book ever published, although most scholars hold it in contempt. worse things happen at sea pond is notable for the weird iridescent glow it admits on certain saints feast days, usually those of st Bartholomew 24th of August, often invoked against nervous diseases and twitching. St. Ambrose, seventh of December, patron saint of beekeepers and wax refiners, and St. Rita of Cascadia 22nd. of May, the patron saint of desperate cases, should cloris priem be classed as a desperate case. We come now to fiendish pond, home to a bewildering array of aquatic life forms, which I'm afraid I have not had time to catalogue. Some of them look like monsters from HP Lovecraft and those are the less frightening ones. terrorized infants can often be seen running away screaming from this pond, only to become entangled in a nearby thicket of nettles and bind weed that poor might. So shuddering, let us attempt to push the tentacle and sucker festooned denizens of fiendish pond to the backs of our minds and consider instead, Mary Moon Man pond, named after one of the key witnesses to the assassination of john F. Kennedy on the 22nd of November 1963. Her name is or was, in fact, Mary more man rather than marry Moon Man, but the blonde swashbuckling Nair do well who painted the signboard affixed to a wooden post stuck in the mud to the southwest of the pond was hard of hearing, and his error has never been corrected. In any case, marry more man or Moon Man, or better be known as marry Moon Man, thus more appropriately named alongside her fellow witnesses to the assassination, badge, man, umbrella man, Black Dog, man, and far too many more men than we have space for here. And this does seem as good a time as any to throw in a little known fact that alleged assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was interred under the name William Bobo. from Mary Moonmen pond strike East tread carefully around the place of strewn grotesque pebbles, and you will find yourself within spitting distance of paracelsus pond, named Of course for the 16th century Alchemist theophrastus philippus oriolus bombastic von hohenheim, the man whom all Episode ariens, holding high honor, as among his coinage is were both the words alcohol and zinc. of more concern to us here is the way in which faint yet compelling links and patterns can be traced across the centuries. Mention has already been made of the terps tycoon hanging Chad, whose fortune was based on the olio resins exuded from coniferous trees consisting of more or less viscous solutions of resin in a volatile oil and low we find that the very same turpentine was an essential constituent of paracelsus celebrated weapons sold the recipe for which was as follows. Take of moss growing on the head of a thief who has been hanged and left in the air of a real mummy of human blood still warm of each one ounce of human Sue it two ounces of linseed oil, turpentine and Armenian bowl of each two dragons. Mix all Well in a mortar and keep the soul in an oblong narrow urn.

For suppose the linkage may seem tenuous, if it were not for the fact that the very next pond we stumble upon, is called human Sue it pond sounds like an anagram doesn't it? And indeed it is, for this is an artificial pond, obvious from it perfectly ellipsoid shape, which was dug in 1962 by one Thomas pan June at an anagram to mark the publication of Richard Milhouse Nixon's book six crises. careful study of the pond reveals half a dozen partly submerged plastic baubles, each of which is designed to represent one of the Venn future presidents half dozen formative events, the most exciting of which are referred to both bauble and crisis is the goodwill tour of South America in 1958. When Nixon and his wife, the saintly Pat, were attacked and nearly killed by pro communist mobs in Venezuela, Thomas panduan was a great admirer of admirer of the only Quaker ever to order the bombing of Cambodia. Although he underwent his own crisis in 1971. The details are blurry, but it had something to do with a yeast infection. whereupon he disavowed Nixon pond and baubles and retired to work bewilderment home on a bleak hillside. He may still be there haunted, ancient and drooling for all I know, but his pond remains a very lovely thing, and has always been popular with the picnicking element. Next on our fascinating tour is Pang fabula Quisling pond, known colloquially as much dragged pond, as it has the distinction of being the most frequently dragged pond in the land, the police forces of this baileywick and there are at least seven different so called law platoons who claim it as their own. All have a perplexing mania for sending frogman equipment forensically approved nets into the pond at the least opportunity. Sometimes they do not even wait for a crime to be committed. scarcely a week goes by without a nylon fence being erected around this splendid pond. A team of yellow jacketed walkie talkie wielding mervi Dawn's materializing out of the blue, and then a series of faint splashes as the dashing frogmen set about their task. Their trolls have even been productive on occasion. The Grim or perhaps the word is grimy, poisonous gervaise tank Wilde was convicted on the basis of a file of Smee riddled with his fingerprints, which we had tossed into the pond while pursued by bloodhounds. It proved to be the only evidence against him. Yet it was as the trial judge put it, the hinge on which the case swings. This judge incidentally was fond of iron mungry metaphors in his something's up and regularly invoked hinges, lever handles, snap hooks, latches ceiling lugs, padlocks, mobile aeration screens, safety chains, shrink devices, transom window gears, a spaniel, it bolts, bevels sash pulleys, pressed brackets, and even fire tongs to illuminate is never less than draconian judgments. Tank quote he sent to the drug for 40 years, which amounted to a death sentence as the theme was already in his 80s when he was at last apprehended. Much drag pond has also been noteworthy as a popular location for filmmakers, no doubt because his morning mists hangover it's still surface on those rare days it is not being dragged. It has a magical atmosphere, like one imagines Avalon say or Narnia or the blister lane bypass note to the solitary Heron standing vigil at the edge of the pond. of Clytemnestra pond, we need say nothing.

Vaughn pig from Vaughn pig flask pond is named for host Helmut von pig flask, the noted percussionist who created his own Sonic universe using just a couple of biscuit tins, a thermos flask half full of milk, and a few odds and ends scavenged from a rusting ship. The milk he famously declared Must be sour, at least four days sour or has no tone, no time. At one time and a bit of the same Marseille dockyard drinking dens as that scallywag, Lothar preen, Vaughn pick flowers cut a huge falling out with his mentor on the 12th of October 1959. Despite both protagonists, keeping voluminous if not to say obsessive diaries, neither of them has a word to say about this incident. preens journal entry for the day is the usual vain self serving hyperbole. While Vaughn pig flask wrote a long list of farm implements annotated with pencil drawn symbols in some indecipherable private code. What can it all mean? The sad thing is that no one then or now ever really cared. On the following day after this altercation from pic flashcard a dingey, from one of his disreputable acquaintances put out to see and vanished. Perhaps because his police files had been mislaid his absence went on and remarked, certainly there's no trace of him whatsoever until at some point in the late 1960s, when reports began to circulate that he was a founding member of the blues rock pioneers blog wind pig. To this day, the other original members, Mick, Abraham's jack Lancaster, and the pile and Ron Burge denied ever having heard of the great percussionist, let alone giving him free rein with his tins, flask and Rusty flotsam on their debut album, ahead rings out. There is no doubt however, that it was Vaughn pig floss himself who appeared unannounced on stage at the 1974 Jazz Festival in olm, where he performed a 16 second untitled improvisation before scuttling away into the tenebrous German Twilight. Two more years passed before his triumphant return to the world stage, the patching up of differences with preen and the air splitting genius of his late work in 1996. By now aged and suffering increasingly from the bindings. He retired and settled in Winnipeg. His final years was spent on the upper floors of a gleaming skyscraper, where he took a great pleasure in his pet tortoise, and worked for hours every day on a seemingly endless list of anagrams of pol pot. Ayn Rand, you thant and Yoko Ono there is one further pond stagnant, inky black fathomless spooky pond. But I've read about that to you before. And we don't have any time this afternoon to hear all about the poor wretched mud splattered orphans who hang around there. So we're going to bring the show to an end. And just to let you know that hooting yard is now repeated on resonance at 830 in the morning, on Saturdays every Saturday, so you can hear this again. Thin bye
