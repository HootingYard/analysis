Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. If I sound a little somber, it's because I have before we can get on with the rest of the show I've there's a kind of real, something painful I have to deal with first really. This is a refutation of some of the less plausible claims made by Dennis kargh pan, in his woeful lecture delivered from the balcony of the Civic Hall at bulges Spinney on Thursday last, during a hailstorm to a gathering of ingrates and orphans. I wish to refute while sipping from a glass of milk of magnesia some of the less plausible claims made by that odious charlatan Dennis kargh. Pan in his woeful and let's face it mercenary lecture delivered from the crumbling balcony of the Civic Hall at budget Spinney. On Thursday last during the most tremendous hailstorm I have ever seen in my life, to a gathering of best deal in grades and orphans, who were corralled into the square by kargh pans team of electric cattle prod wielding ruffians and forced to applaud his preposterous statements. Chief among these statements was his contention that toads are shy, usually Nocturnal Animals hiding during the day in dark, damp places, and hopping about at night in search of insects, grubs, slugs, worms and other invertebrates that they're often brownish or grayish in color, and have warty skin, a flat head, swollen parotid glands on the side of the neck behind the eyes, bright jewel like eyes with a transverse pupil, and slightly webbed toes. That they are often stouter than frogs and cannot leap as far as the tongue of the toad is attached to the front of its mouth, that the tongue is flicked forward from the mouth, and this sticky tip grasps the prey and carries it back to the mouth. That unlike most frogs, most toads do not have teeth. But the tongue produces quantities of mucus to help in swallowing that all anurans blink when they swallow, and because there is no bone between the eye and the mouth, the eye is pushed against the roof of the mouth, forcing the food further back. Let me just sip some milk of magnesia before refuting this twaddle. There, I refute it utterly. I do not refute it on the basis of scientific fact nor on my own acute observation of the natural world. Nor do I refute it because I have read many, many learned papers about toads which counter these statements. Similarly, I do not refute it in homage to my mother, who was a self proclaimed expert on toads, and passed down her hard won knowledge to me, because my mother was bonkers and confused toads with more hens, and it should come as no surprise that all those articles about toads she sent off to the Reader's Digest and the Daily Telegraph were tapped out on a special padded typewriter. From her room in the st. Cynthia Mercy Home for the deranged and bewildered. No, I refute this drivel simply because I bear a grudge against Dennis kargh pan. One day he will burn in hell. In the meantime, I shall not rest for my refutations of every word he acids from that pinched and slippery mouth of his well, may he regret the day He chuckled at my carefully preened Buffon

no doubt you're it's it's nearly nearly October, isn't it? And you're probably thinking, where shall I go on holiday in the winter? So here's what to do on a winter's day in tanta arobin. This handy guide has been produced by the tantau urban Tourist Board, a body riddled with corruption from top to toe, all of its internal politics need not concern the innocent listener, who merely wishes to spend a few joyous hours in the bailiwick of tan Tara beam on a cold and blustery winter's day swag rolling woolen garments against the elements. Let's start again. This is a handy guide to the sort of activities you and your family can enjoy in tan Tara beam during the winter months, should you be unlucky enough to have your plane maker forced landing there due to storminess? Surely the only reason to go anywhere near 10 Tower beam in the first place, given how frightening it is. Having said that, for the tourist who does not mind discomfort and privations. tantaran can be a source of much entertainment and interest if the words are used loosely. So put on your hat and come with me now. As we creep past the gore splattered beasts with venomous fangs which guard all approaches to the town, and I shall list at least five things you can do when stuck in tanto orbimed. During a blizzard, one plummet helplessly down one of the many hidden chutes which deliver you into a flaming pit to be poked at with pointed sticks by cloven hooved imps spitting sulfur. You'll have lots of fun trying to shake them off, but we guarantee you won't succeed. Three take a guided tour of the choc ice factory. The price of entry includes the opportunity to taste their wares for become embroiled in a fight to the death with bone Crusher, Jim and untamed Python which has been deprived of food for months. And five, spend a night in one of 10 Tara bins many ins where you will be entranced by the primitive Gaslight, inexplicable nighttime banging and crashing noises, swarms of Phantom locusts, and walls and ceilings that seemed to move when you're not looking. Most inns do not charge for children under 16 probably because they're likely to be abducted by strange amphibious monsters and dragged into the sea.

Continuing with the theme of scary places, this is a this is a part one of a story called the horrible cave. Talk to any spell anchor, and you will soon learn that nobody who strays into the horrible cave emerges with their wits intact. Sometimes their hair turns white, they shake and Juba, they have to be fed with slops. Others retire to farmyard and spend the rest of their lives among pot bellied pigs. Yet still a reckless and the foolhardy risk their sanity by ignoring the big signpost I hammered into the ground. The approach to the horrible cave. This is the horrible cave reads my notice. If you have a shred of sense you will dust not enter. I spent quite some time on that wording and ended up in hospital because I chewed the end of my pencil so fretfully while I was writing it that I contracted lead poisoning. It is by no means a pretty ailment. But I would much rather suffer that than the terrible derangement of those who stepped back once into the horrible cave. While I was in the hospital, I was visited by a government agent who was curious about my signpost. I suspected he was from some secret agency for He was dressed in a trim black suit and did not remove his sunglasses. He had a very close cropped haircut, carried an attached a case which I noticed was changed his wrist, and he seemed to exude the sense of frangipani or dogbane, which is often a telltale sign of covert operatives in my country. Standing beside the bed on which I lay splayed out, he introduced himself as Christopher Plummer. Not to be confused with the actor who played quits our current role in the Royal hunt of the sun, he added horridly although at that time the name was new to me. I have since followed the agents namesakes career with growing interest I was subjected to a series of questions about the signpost I had placed near the horrible cave and answered as best I could. Given my fevered state. The agent made notes on a little handheld pneumatic turbo note pad of ingenious design. often find myself wondering why they never caught on. These days you're lucky to find one at a jumble sale or in a junk shop. luckier still if all the notes made on it is still readable. When Christopher Plummer had finished interrogating me in his strangely stiff manner, he depressed a knob on the turbo pad, and with a surprisingly loud hiss, it clunked into hibernation mode. I watched the jet of escaping steam. Years later, sitting in a cafe in a tremendous town, flicking idly through an intelligence journal, I learned that agent Plummer had been exposed as an alien life form from some far planet riddled with horrible caves. I thought how fortunate we were to have only one horrible cave, terrible as it was. Last week, I hiked out that way to see if my signpost was still there. prancing majestically along the path, I encountered dozens of terrified people being attacked by cows. Sorry, that was a typing error. I should have said being attacked by crows. One poor wretch who had been picked up was slumped beside his makeshift tent. fruitlessly trying to wrap a bandage around his head. I knelt down beside him and gave him a hand and could not resist asking what was happening, but he was unable to speak. I surmised, however, that the crows must have flown from the direction of the horrible cave. Perhaps they nested there unbeknown to the local bird inspectors.

It seemed like a good idea to forget about my signposts for the day and go to the headquarters of the bird inspection team instead. So that's what I did. Although it was at least 14 years since last I had roamed these parts. I still record the bus routes. So after making sure the pecked man's head bandage was not too tight, I changed direction and cut across the malls towards the bus stop. It was a dismaying sight for the shelter was in ruins, and the glass behind which the timetable had been pinned up was smashed, and the timetable itself torn to shreds. Further evidence of violent CRO activity as if anyone needed. The bus pulled up at this dismal scene. A few minutes later, I clambered on board and became somewhat uneasy to discover that I was the only passenger. Was this going to be one of those frightening journeys where the driver would turn to look at me, and I would see that he was a fiend in human form, cackling hideously is the bus hurtle to perdition. Ah, I'd forgotten that it was st uses day, and that most people except for me and the bus driver, and the people being attacked by crows would be staying indoors in darkness behind fasten shutters, imploring St. Eustace to keep them safe from poisoned air for the coming 12 months. I hope that the bird inspection headquarters would at least have a skeleton staff on this special day and settled back in my seat, thinking to take a nap while the driver steered his bus around the many dangerous corners on the route. When will I ever learn? No sooner had I closed my eyes then the bus brake sharply jolting me out of my seat. The driver cursed for which I reprimanded him. He apologized for his Rudra he then pointed in front of him and I saw that the road was blocked by a fanatical preacher man naked from the waist up caked in filth, standing on a barrel and shouting his head off in a language I had never heard before. The driver and I exchanged looks of befuddlement. Then he reached under his seat and hoisted up a rectangular tin, which he opened to reveal a clotted mass of stale food. He invited me to share his lunch, but I declined, given that there appeared to be a number of weevils crawling about in it. Their presence did not bother the driver, who began shoveling the food in his mouth with his surprisingly dainty fingers. I noticed that his nails were painted with bright red lacquer flaking off in places as if it had been applied some time ago. His eating habits was repulsive. The light turned to look out at the preacher man again. He was shouting even louder now. I decided to get off the bus to try and persuade him to move his barrel to the side of the road. as I got closer to him, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Surely I was mistaken. But no, there was no doubting it. underneath all that caked mark, I recognized my father. Papaya I cried, sudden tears streaming down my face. I may as well have been invisible. He ignored me and continued to harangue the sky in his unintelligible tongue, the sky that was now growing black because monstrous cloud swept in from the west. I'm tempted here to lie and say that my tears were copious, but I have to confess they were not. I snuggled a bit, and then remembered why I had got off the bus in the first place. It was clear to me, however, that asking my father to shift his barrel out of the road would be futile. I wondered how it would be if I just pushed him over and cleared the way myself. The laws here on toppling preacher men are draconian, and I'd have to make sure I did not get caught. I judged that the bus driver was too intent on bolting his food and would not be paying attention. If he saw me push my power off the barrel, he would almost certainly inform on the floor. We all know the reputation of bus company personnel hand in hand with the police force, at least in this neck of the woods, for obvious historical reasons. As for my father, would he lay an accusation against his only son, it was a risk I had to take. Just as I was nerfing, myself for the odious deed, I was distracted by a mordant fancy which should be nestling dormant in my brain until that moment.

I'm utterly perplexed as to why it suddenly uncoiled itself as it were, and sprang to the forefront of my mind, casting out all other thoughts. It was a vision, so very vivid of myself, dressed in rags. exhaustedly swinging a leper bell for my withered arm. Weird that I slapped myself on the forehead a couple of times to dispel a hallucination came to my senses, yanked my father's ankles so that he fell off the barrel, pushed the barrel over and rolled it to the curb, and got back on the bus. The driver had finished his lunch, so swerving slightly to avoid my power, who was sat in the row dusting himself down and still shouting. He drove me to my stop 10 minutes walk from the bird inspection unit. What I found there was brain dizzying

Tales of the river bank. The river bank of which I speak was inhabited by glamorous moles. There were dozens of them, each more glamorous than the last. And the one who engages our attention on this damp Wednesday is the most glamorous mole of all. Her name is whore tense. Before you start complaining about the regrettable practice of anthropomorphizing riverbank creatures, please bear in mind that not a lot of that is going on here. The mole was called hortensis and she was extremely glamorous. She wore a sort of mole version of a clash hat, but there was nothing remotely human about her. She was just a mole, albeit one so glamorous that other molds wound in her presence. Have you ever seen a mole swoon? It's quite a sight and you'll do well to have your camera ready. On the Wednesday of which I speak, there were many swooning molds to be seen by the riverbank. And we have not even begun to explore the marshes. tails of the marshes. Out in the spooky marshes at dead of night nothing stirred. nothing except tiny nocturnal creatures whose habitat was Marsh and fen kakanin and you might hear scribblings and scurrying things, fugitive wisps of sound and the otherwise eerie silence. They use it in your concrete pillbox, a primed grenade in one hand and a mug of tomorrow. tomato soup in the other. The dampness of your socks is most distressing. You are distressed by the dampness of your socks in the marshes in the night. But why are you holding a hand grenade? Is this wartime? Surely in wartime, you would not be fobbed off with damp socks. A bat appears near your head and you flinch. These marshes are known for their colonies of bats. wisely, you sip your soup, it is piping hot. The air in the marshes is not.

I just thought I'd throw in this, you know, imagine you've never used a telephone before. This is public information. Imagine you've never used the telephone before. It rings and you pick up the receiver. But you don't know that the social convention is to say hello, or Dobson here who's calling or something similar. So what do you say? One man who faced this dilemma was of course Alexander Graham Bell who invented the thing or at least got the patent on it. Now Belle's preferred manner of answering the telephone was to shout or hoy. This seems to me far more exciting than a doll Hello. And it's a pity that Bell's habit never caught on. But of course, it's never too late to overturn various social conventions. If we all started yelling, our hoy. When answering the telephone, the world would be just a little bit more pleasurable.

The dilapidated walls the moldering plaster, the blackened mantle pieces for stained and polluted wainscott, under license of a fopp Roth, Roth in measurable, unimaginable unmistakable burned up my heart like a cancer.
