Good afternoon. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. Today, it's of decisive importance that I tell you about Blodgett esque farming methods. The techniques pioneered by Blodgett in his heyday are breathtaking. Consider for example, the uses to which your blog jetty and farmer will put hay. There are many, many diagrams in the manual, which show bales of hay being commandeered for all sorts of inventive purposes all over the farmyard in all six seasons of the year. That's right six seasons. One of budgets most telling innovations was his calendrical recalibration if I'm using the word correctly. out go winter spring summer and autumn income tally spate the time of MONTH Mighty remonstrations tak hub and bullishness so comm hub COMM The haywain as the saying goes with his big fat boots stuffed with straw. I mean, hey, we will not get diverted from this important essay by wandering down the byways of blog Jesse and countryside parlance. But I can't resist sharing with you the rhyme that goes Don't forget to shut the gate on the 43rd of Speight. The meaning of which is obvious, as you would realize, had you seen as I have an implacable army of our bino hens marching off into the sunset, because little versand Jetta reeks the barnyard Hubble de hoy was too busy chewing on a sheaf of fronds to remember to close the gate behind him. As it happened, the fronds were poisonous, and the miscreant was subject to convulsive fits for the next three weeks blessing. As with Hey, so with mulch, blood, your test mulch is a thing of beauty, even if it does stink. Have you ever seen asparagus grown in Blodgett smelt you would remember if you had for its for it is too common every day asparagus as a big shiny supersonic 26th century space rocket is to a shred of plankton. Preparation of mulch takes place mostly in business. When the winds how and thunderclaps shatter the eardrums of toiling farmworkers, Hardy folk with almost inhuman musculature as a result of regular doses of Blodgett serum, the recipe for which appears in an appendix to the manual. To begin farming the Blodgett way all you will need is a home a shapeless hat, iron determination and your own field, preferably one with a pond in it, and ducks in the pond mergansers or tail. Some of them are ill, some of them would call Beco ducks, and some of them just vaporous specters of your own fervent imagining

this is an extract from the autobiography of Mrs gubbins which she has been writing, and I crept into her office the other day and stole a few pages of the manuscript. So here's his part of part of Mrs. gubbins autobiography. After my divorce from the man who liked her sing, Shenandoah morning, noon and night, setting my teeth on edge, I became a flapper and spent the next five years going from one party to another. I doubt that any of the Demi mundanes with whom I canoodle had any idea that between parties, I was lecturing at various colleges on the history of bell ringing and the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Tudor church. It was through this shared interest that I met our fan who became a husband number two, Bathsheba, he would say to me, I often wonder why my parents named me are Fang. After all, my father was Belgium and my mother hailed from the tenebrous dense forests of Northern Finland. My siblings all have names like Yan and Euston hacky and I know Johnny. How many siblings have you got? Are Fang my sweet I would ask patting him on the cheek, then his brow would grow furrowed and he would become morose and matter something about going out to buy a bottle of dandelion, and burdock. I became unhappy at this secretiveness of his and it grieves me to think that during our eight months together, I felt closer to my pet anteater. Dez mondo. Nonetheless, I wept for a week when our Fang perished in the Hindenburg disaster. I owe my life to the fact that for once I was not at his side that day, having in that very week been employed to spy on the young Anthony Burgess, or john Wilson, as he then was, for reasons I forget. I must say it rains a lot in Lincolnshire.

That was the that was the the only extract I've so far got of Mrs. gubbins autobiography. But the brief paragraph that I've just read about scarcely does justice to our Fang, for he was an endlessly fascinating man with a brain the size of an airship, such as that in which he perished. In his memoir, the our Fang, I knew Fx duggleby wrote as follows. Our Fang harbored certain ideas about phosphorescence parallelograms and the life cycle of the funnel web spider, which challenges the Weltanschauung, or at least my Veldt hadn't shown. He often likened his curiosity about the world to a raven, regurgitating food for its young. Although it's difficult to grasp quite what he meant by this analogy, much given to solitude, he would lie for hours in a tin bath, paring his fingernails in seussian flea and humming what he called the true music of the spheres. At other times, such as cocktail parties, he would start up and on earthly keening, pressing a medicine ball to his chest. fluent in Flemish and Finnish, he was surprisingly inarticulate in such exciting languages as wendish or sorbian. See Diack, Petit Panwar, Petit, Mariska and MC Mack. His widow Bathsheba once calculated that our Fang devised over 400 distinct recipes for cold soup, despite an abnormality of the taste buds, which had afflicted him since a childhood accident in a metal on a Wednesday with a blowtorch in a frenzy. Duggal be who that quote was from appears to be mistaken regarding our fangs cocktail party behavior for the man who so newly became Pope Giono. sforza left a vivid account of a bash one night on the outskirts of the Vatican in 1923. which reads as follows. Are Fang brilliant teamed and slobbering entered the room. I could see that his airship size brain was pulsating more terrifically than it usually did. I could see this because like Ray Mel and I was the man with X ray eyes. I have always said that my special gift cost me the papacy. But this is not the time to be Mone my slow decline into beggar them penury and insignificance. No. In those days I struck a fine figure as the confidante of such men as our Fang. His presence filled the room despite all those glittering chandeliers and the expensive furniture. He spoke but briefly in an aside to some foreign ambassador of preening, contempt ability, and I was unable to hear exactly what he said. He spent most of the evening leaning against a harp, steadily devouring pies and enchanting a number of floozies with the enigmatically mute braggadocio of his Flim Flam. Our fangs greatest legacy may well be the dredging of the canal at Garg on the eve of the bat cake, a keto conference, a full of cat a full account of which can be found in Dobson's pamphlet, the dredging of the canal at Garg on the eve of the bat cake a key conference out of print.

I want to try an experimental, an experimental radio thought wave process. Because the next the next piece I want to read depends on two photographs. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold the photograph up, maybe flap it a bit and see if I can save my brainwaves can go across the ether so you'll be able to sense them. It is basically Hera hooting odd, we're always seeking new ways to help our readers achieve sex, self actualization in the profoundest sense. To this end, we commissioned Professor zahlt and shudder to devise a quiz based on his theory that all known human personality types can be shoehorned into two basic eidelons either learn from the Greek means a specter or Phantom, which suggests that the professor knows not of what he speaks. But it can also mean an idealized image, the sense in which it was sometimes used in the early 19th century. So perhaps that's what he's driving at. Anyway, each of us sugery argues, is either a Richard Milhouse Nixon, or an Emily Dickinson. So, try the quiz to see which one you fit which model you fit into. The first question, so listen carefully may want a pen and paper a note down your answer. One, do you like to spend long hours gazing wistfully out of an upstairs window in amhurst? The second question, given the chance, would you bomb Cambodia? And the third question and this is where I'm going to try and send a kind of sense sensory picture of the photographs. I want you to look very, very carefully at these two photographs. randomly generated photographs. And assuming you were invited to share a picnic with one of these people, would it be Person A or Person B? So this is the first one. So that person a I'm getting a sense of I don't know. Getting a sense of a quiet New England town, perhaps and poems being written. And then this is Person B. Okay, that's I've just waved that other photograph. I'm getting the sense there of I don't know someone, someone involved in six crises, perhaps with a small dog called checkers. So those are the three questions to answer. When you've completed the quiz. Send your answers for analysis to Professor Zoltan sialorrhea. The usual address marked Who am I? He will send you a report of no less than 14 closely typed pages individually tailored to give you a deep and lasting insight into your personality, indeed, into your very essence.

Udo turns blue. It was st Hector's day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ooh, goes hood got snagged on attack and he had turned blue. Or as Carl Sagan used to say, blue. Ooh, said who goes POW off. Ooh, go. You look all blue. ACC said Ooh, go. I'll go and fetch your blind Mark Ugo to see what she can do set off. Though he could have pulled Lugo's hood off the tack on which it was snagged. But off had been sniffing glue all found who goes mass sitting on a stool. Who goes mom said oh Ergo has turned blue. His hood is snagged on attack. Ooh goes Maher was eating too, but she jumps off her stall, and Randy Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Who goes Maher spat out her true And it landed in a pot of glue. It was the glue goes POW off had been sniffing who goes Mar, and snagged who goes hood from the tack. Said Ooh, go. Ooh, ooh goes Ma. I knew you would know what to do. Said off. Who goes Mark clouded off on the head with a spoon and confiscated his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass at St Hector's Cathedral in Plovdiv.

I just thought I would mention you know that the the Sherlock Holmes stories were that Conan Doyle wrote them as if they were written by Dr. Watson. It was Dr. Watson, you know, retailing the various cases. And quite often in the stories. Dr. Watson, in an aside almost mentions other cases that he's never written up. So there's like, there's the corpus of the Sherlock Holmes stories. And then there's this kind of ghost set of all these cases that Watson mentions but never writes up. Some of them sound really fascinating one of them that I remember I can't remember which story is from is the affair of the bogus laundry, and Mike, but my absolute favorite is his wit for fairly obvious reasons, is from the story entitle the adventure of the Naval Treaty. And I just like to quote from this and I think that the case that doctor one Watson refers to here really ought to be written up, maybe I should write it myself. This is Conan Doyle or Dr. Watson. The discretion and high sense of professional honor, which has always distinguished my friend are still at work in the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. I deprecate. However, in the strongest way the attempt which has been made lately to get at and to destroy these papers, the source of these outrages is known and if they are repeated, I have Mr. Holmes authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician, the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the public. There is at least one reader who will understand Don't you just love that? That adventure of the politician the lighthouse and the crane cormorant? It's such a shame he never wrote it.

Do bees make moral choices? The bees know the difference between good and evil. answering these questions was the life's work of Captain February ko goal. Pirate turned a purist, the man who swapped a life being roguish and dastardly on the high seas, for one spent limping around on his wooden leg among hundreds of beehives in a field. Captain gold had been possibly the most feared Buccaneer on the Spanish mane or what was left of it. He was so fierce that he would eat a mouthful of carpet tacks for breakfast, washed down with the blood of various animals penned in the cargo hold, which is slaughtered with his sharpened shiny Scimitar. Unlike the general run of pirates, however, he rarely cackled indeed he was not given to laughter, hideous or otherwise, underneath the terrifying exterior, he was a thoughtful fellow, whose pleasures were found not in fighting and cruising, but in resting on his bunk with a good book, such as the rule of Saint Benedict in his cabin strewn with the blossom of fragrant shrubs only when There was a rustle in the piles of blossom, and his lovecraftian shrug off reared its terrible head and prodded him to bloodlust. Did Captain gold become violent? Sometimes he wondered what had become of the rest of his crew, for there was not a soul else on board his ship. It was in mulling over the in consistencies of his own behavior that Captain gold began to think about the idea of the good be, as luck would have it. One winter's day a huge storm in Gulf the ship, and it was run aground on a remote island, but not before the lovecraftian shrug off had been hurled overboard by the mighty Tempest. alone at last Captain girl clumped ashore, drenched and disconcerted, and camped overnight in a field. Next morning, exploring his new home, he discovered that the island was riddled with swarms of bees, the rest children is history. And that's that's taken from a pamphlet by Dobson entitled, The bee as moral, exemplar and other insect related parables for young and old alike in it.

They will also need to wear special boots because the violent magnetic activity which has been throbbing in the spinny because of the violent magnetic activity, which has been throbbing in the spinny since Mr. pox haven overturned the job of his experimental substance. The hooting yard emergency response Squadron managed to seal off part of the area but they use plywood for their impromptu fence and during the night it tends to get ignored at by voles. This intelligence has been reported by the Pang Hill vole watching club, who campout by the spinny night after night, peering through binoculars, and scribbling notes on sheets of a two paper, which they pin up each morning on that board outside the post office. We should be thankful to every last man jack of them at the festival of bears and pomposity in December, they will be given a special prize made out of tin in recognition of their efforts. Tickets for the children's activity weekend are available from that weird dilapidated kiosk over by the pond. Bring Your Own planks.

The 400 men and women of the blister lane cormorant patrol brandished their pencil sharpeners, toffee apples and inaccurate atlases as they reached the peak of the tour after marching all day. below them beyond the pig hearts, the curiously stained bridge and the abandoned swimming baths. They were just able to see shrouded in mist the famous or infamous Rotana and tantalum Pons. So dried up after successive droughts that they were now a little more than puddles. onwards, cried Captain Federico Gwyneth Paltrow, undisputed leader of the cormorant patrol and the man who stupendous energy had helped it thrive, even through sexual lean times, sell them as a puny and diminutive physiognomy being so misleading And so began their descent. Three quarters of the way down the newest recruit Faye young Daisy Ricardo montell Bahn, stopped in her tracks. interviewed and yelled out, look, look something with a beak and feathers. And indeed, as they peered through the enshrouding nest, the other saw it to perched on the branch of a withered pecan tree, sprouting hopelessly on the banks of one of the ponds, or puddles. Excited with excitedly they began running capering and gambling down the muddy slope of the tour. But as they closed upon their prey, they realized it was not a cormorant at all. It was a little bittern. And the source of that story is from an anonymous book entitled 46 bird related adventure stories.

I very rarely read poetry, or very rarely write poetry, but I very rarely read poetry on this show. But I'd like to read a little poem to you now. Matt spat in the pan. He was a dismal man. He ate his way and curds, and went to look for birds. He found a Curlew. First, he spat again and cursed. Then he saw a crow packing a lump of dough. Then linnets geese Acuff until he'd seen enough, Matt trudged into his shed, and Inferno in his head. He wept and drooled and shook. Then, in his exercise book, he wrote with trembling pen that he had not seen the hand. The hand that made him scream when it loomed awful in his dream that plagued him every night, the hand of hideous white the weird ferocious bird. squawking the terrible word. The word that drove mad mad, though word rock up bad.
