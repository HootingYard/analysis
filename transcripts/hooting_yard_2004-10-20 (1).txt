The poor man's add some picturesque incidents, according to their version, a huge helmeted hornbill Rhino plaques vigil sits by the far end of the bridge across the river of death, and with its screams, tries to terrify the ghost, so that it shall fall from the bridge into the jaws of the great fish, which is in league with the bird. On the other side of the river is unwrap a woman with a cauldron and the spear and gap. If appeased with a gift, aids the ghosts to escape from the monstrous bird and fish. Pebbles or beads are put in the nostrils of the Poulin corpse, in order that they may be presented to uncap. Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. I'm Frank key. And that was that was a short extract from the pagan tribes of Borneo by Charles hos, and William McDougall. And very exciting. It was two I think. Recently, I read the first part of a of an exciting story called the horrible cave. And since when Episode Two has been completed, but I thought, I thought I'd do the whole thing episodes one and two together. For those of you who have already heard part one, you can hear it again. And Part two is brand new. So this is episodes one and two, seamless, seamless, have the horrible cave. Talk to any spelunker and you will soon learn that nobody who strays into the horrible cave emerges with their wits intact. Sometimes their hair turns white, they shake and jibba they have to be fed with slops. Others retire to farmyards and spend the rest of their lives among pot bellied pigs. Yet still, the reckless and the foolhardy risk their sanity by ignoring the big signpost I hammered into the ground. The approach to the horrible cave. This is the horrible cave reads mine noticed. If you had a have a shred of sense, you will dust not enter. I spent quite some time on that wording and ended up in hospital because I chewed the end of my pencil so fretfully. While I was writing that I contracted lead poisoning. It is by no means a pretty ailment. But I would much rather suffer that than the terrible derangements of those who step but once into the horrible cave. While I was in the hospital, I was visited by a government agent who was curious about my signpost. I suspected he was from some secret agency, for He was dressed in a trim black suit and did not remove his sunglasses. He had a very close cropped haircut, carried on attach a case which I noticed was chained to his wrist, and he seemed to exude the sense of frangipani or dogbane, which is often a telltale sign of covert operatives in my country. Standing beside the bed on which I lay splayed out, he introduced himself as Christopher Plummer. Not to be confused with the actor who played a helper in the Royal hunt of the sun. He added horridly although at that time the name was new to me. I have since followed the agents namesakes career with growing interest. I was subjected to a series of questions about the signpost I had placed near the horrible cave and answered as best I could. Given my favorite state. The agent made notes on our little handheld pneumatic turbo notepad of ingenious design. I often find myself wondering why they never caught on. These days, you're lucky to find one at a jumble sale or in a junk shop. Lucky is still if all the notes made on it are still readable. When Christopher Plummer had finished interrogating me in his strangely stiff manner, he depressed a knob on the turbo pad and with a surprisingly loud hiss it clunk into hibernation mode. I watched the jet of escaping steam. Years later, sitting in a cafe in a tremendous town, flicking idly through an intelligence journal,

Unknown Speaker  05:14
I learned that agent plumber had been exposed as an alien life form from some far planet riddled with horrible caves. I thought how fortunate we were on earth to have only one horrible cave. Terrible as it was. Last week, I hiked out that way to see if my signpost was still there. prancing majestically along the path, I encountered dozens of terrified people being attacked by cows. Sorry, that was a typing error. I should have said being attacked by crows. One poor wretch who had been packed at was slumped beside his makeshift tent. fruitlessly trying to wrap a bandage around his head. I knelt down beside him, and gave him a hand and could not resist asking what was happening, but he was unable to speak. I surmised, however, that the crows must have flown from the direction of the horrible cave. Perhaps they nested there. unbeknown to the local bird inspectors. It seemed like a good idea to forget about my signpost for the day, and to go to the headquarters of the bird inspection team instead. So that's what I did. Although it was at least 14 years since last I had roamed these parts, I still recall the bus routes. So after making sure that pecked man's head bandage was not too tight, I changed direction and cut across the malls towards the bus stop. It was a dismaying sight for the shelter was in ruins, and the glass behind which the timetable had been pinned up was smashed, and the timetable itself torn to shreds. Further evidence of violent crime activity as if anyone needed. The bus pulled up at this dismal scene. A few minutes later, I clambered on board and became somewhat uneasy to discover that I was the only passenger. Was this going to be one of those frightening journeys where the driver would turn to look at me, and I would see that he was a fiend in human form, cackling hideously as the bus hurtled to perdition. I had forgotten that it was St. Eustace his day, and that most people except for me and the bus driver, and the people being attacked by crows, would be staying indoors in darkness, behind fastened shutters, imploring the saints to keep them safe from poisoned air for the coming 12 month. I hope that the bird inspection headquarters would at least have a skeleton staff on this special day and settled back in my seat, thinking to take a nap while the driver steered his bus around the many dangerous corners on the route. When will I ever learn? No sooner had I closed my eyes then the bus break sharply jolting me out of my seat. The driver cursed for which I reprimanded him. He apologized for his rude Hurry, then pointed in front of him. And I saw that the road was blocked by a fanatical preacher man, naked from the waist up, caked in filth standing on a barrel and shouting his head off in a language I had never heard before. The driver and I exchanged looks of befuddlement. Then he reached under his seat and hoisted up a rectangular tin, which he opened to reveal a clotted mass of stale food. He invited me to share his lunch, but I declined, given that there appeared to be a number of weevils crawling about in it. Their presence did not bother the driver, however, who began shoveling the food into his mouth with his surprisingly dainty fingers. I noticed that his nails were painted with bright red lacquer flaking off in places as if it had been applied some time ago. His eating habits were so repulsive, that I turned to look out at the preacher man again. He was shouting even louder now. I decided to get off the bus to try and persuade him to move his barrel to the side of the road. as I got closer to him, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Surely I was mistaken. But no, there was no doubting it. underneath all the caked mark. I recognized my father.

Unknown Speaker  09:47
Power, I cried, too sudden tears streaming down my face. I may as well have been invisible. He ignored me and continued to harangue the sky in his unintelligible time. The sky that was now growing Black has monstrous cloud swept in from the west. I'm tempted to lie and say that my tears were copious, but I have to confess they were not. I snuggled a bit, and then remembered why I had got off the bus in the first place. It was clear to me however, the asking my father to shift his barrel out of the road would be futile. I wondered how it would be if I just pushed him over and cleared the way myself. The laws here on toppling preacher man are draconian, and I would have to make sure I did not get caught. I judged that the bus driver was too intent on bolting his food and would not be paying attention. If he saw me push my power off the barrel, he would almost certainly inform on me, for we all know the reputation of bus company personnel hand in hand with the police force, at least in this neck of the woods for obvious historical reasons. As for my father, would he lay an accusation against his only son, it was a risk I had to take. Just as I was nursing myself for the odious deed, I was distracted by a mordant fancy which should be nestling dormant in my brain until that moment, I'm utterly perplexed as to why it suddenly uncoiled itself as it were, and sprang to the forefront of my mind, casting out all other thoughts. It was a vision so very vivid of myself dressed in rags. exhaustedly swinging a leper Bell from my withered arm. Weird that I slapped myself on the forehead a couple of times to dispel the hallucination came to my senses, yanked my father's ankle so that he fell off the barrel, pushed the barrel over and rolled it to the curb, and got back on the bus. The driver had finished his lunch, so swerving slightly to avoid my father, who was sat in the road dusting himself down, he drove me to my stop 10 minutes walk from the bird inspection unit. What I found there was brain dizzy, dizzying. I arrived at the bird inspectors heart to discover that it had been engulfed by a tsunami and lay in ruins. A solitary more hand was paddling about where the door used to be. But there was no sign of the inspectors. I fancied that perhaps this might be talking more hand, which could apprise me where they had gone. And so I asked my question in a slow, clear, loud voice as one might use in speaking to a recalcitrant infant. But of course, the more hen was incapable of speech. What was I thinking? I felt it more important than ever to track down at least one of the bird inspectors, and to relay my theory that crows were nesting in the horrible cave with alarming consequences. In my experience, most bird inspectors sport Italianate mustachios and preen them front fanatically with oils and waxes, so I decided to head off on foot for the nearest village and seek out a shop selling oils, waxes and other hair preparations. I was in luck, for as soon as I strode purposefully into the village I saw not only suction Emporium, tucked between a wholesaler of dinghies and a clapboard hovel, but a man with Italianate mustachios. lurking in the doorway. He was sopping wet, making his moustache droop, but that made it all the more likely he had been caught in the tsunami. I hailed him from a distance of some 40 feet. And that is the last thing I can remember. I have no idea what happened from that moment until today, three weeks later, so I'm told, where I found myself sitting in an armchair staring out at a dying lawn being offered cups of tea and mashed potatoes by an over solicitors nurse. Her name she told me was Primrose. That name rang a faint bell in my memory. I associated it with something petrifying and terrible. But Primrose, the nurse seems to be neither. In fact, her fawning was getting on my nerves.

Unknown Speaker  14:24
I wanted to ask her where I was and how I got here, but she had already skipped off to fetch more potatoes. Deciding to follow her. I walked rather unsteadily into a curry door. It was painted a hideous shade of orange. And on the walls, hung framed portraits of members of Jethro Tull, Emerson lake and Palmer and Barclay James harvest, was this some kind of benighted prog rock haven. I should add that these were paintings rather than photographs, although perhaps the word I'm looking for is dorbz my infant child could do better if I had an infant child, but I do not long ago I vowed never to bring a new being into a world with a horrible cave in it less the mic should accidentally wander into it. I could not forgive myself if such a thing happened. I could hear what sounded like potatoes being mashed coming from an open doorway over to my left. entering the room. However, I did not find Primrose. Instead, I was confronted by a slobbering ghoul, it spoke or rather groaned at me in Latin for it was a Vatican ghoul, a topics gruesome head, I could see the tattered remnants of a Beretta, in which a number of locusts seem to be feeding. Were they eating the ghouls straggly locks or its priestly hat, or both? I was so fascinated by the locusts that I'm afraid I paid little attention to the gravelly voice the Latin being spouted at me. At this point, Primrose came in. There you are Mr. mctavish. She cooed sweetly, addressing the ghoul. I've been looking all over for you. It's time for your mashed potato poultice Come with me. There's a deer. She took it by what I can only assume was its arm and stared it away. Still groaning. I was rather disconcerted that Primrose had ignored me completely. Perhaps I was being oversensitive. I looked at my wristwatch and saw that it was just coming up to midday. Why in heaven's name was I dressed in pajamas, I opened a cupboard and rummaged around until I found a shiny and brand new boiler suit. I changed into it and checked how I looked in a mirror. Noting that it's broad black and yellow hoops gave me a thank resemblance to a giant bee. It was time to leave this place wherever it was. I pranced out onto the lawn and peered around looking for a signpost. I have always been fond of crocus's, and there was a clump of them nearby. In the absence of a signpost, I decided I could do worse than terrier while examining their flowers and leaves, and perhaps scrabbling in the soil to have a quick look at the corm one should take one's pleasures as one can, and if I was to stride onward with a spring in my step, a few minutes contemplation of foliage would calm my brain for the inevitable travails ahead. These were early crocus's or crocus Thomas cinionic has no doubt that Google could have told me I wondered where abouts on his grisly frame Primrose, the nurse was going to apply that poultice of hers his head, that spindly arm, I wonder to how she would cope with the locusts, who would devour the mashed potato as quickly as she could apply it? vast lost in thoughts of potatoes, ghouls and crocus's. I failed to notice that a man had approached me all but silently. Good day to you, sir. He said clearing accumulated phlegm from his throat as he did so would I be correct in thinking you know, something of VA horrible cave? I looked up astonished and saw that my interlocutor was none other than the so called limping irredentist, Florencio popsters. I'm I was ill last week. I think

This is an extract from that this medicine has excellent effect in historic fits. And in all that train of symptoms which hysteric and hypochondriac persons are subject to, such as risings in the throat threatening suffocation, difficult breathing, fluttering and palpitations of the heart. Frequent fainting, lowness of spirits, violent pains in the head langar of the whole body, dullness of the mind and senses with constant anxieties and in quietude. It's cetera. The dose must be repeated according to the urgency of the symptoms, and the medicine must be continued some time after the complaint disappear to prevent a relapse. It will be serviceable during the course of the ether, especially in the case of cost eveness. To take at proper intervals a gentle purge, such as tincture, a Sacra pill, roofie, rhubarb, or glauber salts. bodily exercise of all sorts contributes greatly to the cure of these complaints, especially riding on horseback.

I work for a clandestine defibrillation unit. They call me Lars. My real name is odo. But they call me Lars because we are clandestine. I have what some consider a grandiose hat. My parents had a hat shop called hats of grandiosity, and they gave me this hat when I left home. I did not wish to be part of the hat trade much to my parents consternation on my 11th birthday, a tad precociously. I announced that I saw my future in the world of clandestine defibrillation. odo my parents said simultaneously, you have our blessing. They always spoke at the same time using identical words and vocal inflections. It was uncanny. I grew up thinking all married couples were like that. And it came as something of a shock when I got married myself to the delightful Zelda and discovered that not only did we not speak like we did not think alike at all.

preoccupations were party dreadnoughts and the box arising subject to very little interest to me. I did make some attempt to show an interest in potty but my wife grew impatient with my ham fisted, flapping like a seal on an ice floe. After six months, she did captor tan Tara beam with a post office worker who will brilliant team in his hair and shared her passion for potty. I was distraught, of course, and considered pursuing her to apply to my troth, but in the clandestine defibrillation business, the devil takes the hindmost. We have just received a document imploring us to recall Tip Top skills in an abandoned birdcage factory on the banks of the old dried up river in pointy town. My supervisor who not only looked like but had the very same name as Tuesday, weld said to me, last, I know your wife has run off with a brilliant team Patty enthusiast, but this job is decisively important. If we crack it. We will be hailed throughout the world of clandestine defibrillation units. The grandiosity of our reputation will match that of your hat. I couldn't argue with that. Indeed, I could never argue with Tuesday Weld. So off we went in our jeep terrifying small domestic animals as we sped screeching along the narrow and dangerous roads to pointy town. The citizenry had put out flags to welcome us, even though they knew we were clandestine. Tuesday, weld was furious, more furious than I had ever seen her. Not even when her pencil sharpener was mislaid by a Tasmanian duck doctor, was she so furious? Remove those flags. She cried, jumping from the jeep. The rest of us sculpt into the birdcage factory and defibrillated it clandestinely. Then Tuesday world took us to the pointy town Bistro and bought us cake. I chose a chocolate swiss roll.

We think of Dobson primarily as a pamphleteer, albeit an out of print one is occasional forays into public speaking, lecturing. And it has to be said jabbering like a man who has lost his marbles of us often overlooked. A new paper by Allah wishes nesting bird attempts to set this right. I say attempts because in my view nesting bird has been spectacularly unsuccessful. reading his verbose travel gave me a splitting headache after the first couple of paragraphs I went to have a lie down in a darkened room. As I lay on my palate, I took pleasure in recalling my great enmity for nesting bird. Verily, I thought to myself staring at patches of badly applied paint on the ceiling. He is a detestable old fool who wouldn't be better off inspecting the bed of a slimy pond than writing articles about Dobson. The fact that I'm even older than nesting bird is irrelevant. As soon as various sensory globules in my cranium had stopped pulsating, I returned to my desk and plowed on through the article. Unlike its author, I'm conscientious and I had promised to review it for resonance. For my usual fee of 10 of plum tomatoes and a new cravat with which I can cut a dash. nesting bird focuses his attention on Dobson's famous declaration, which the pamphleteer delivered on a sopping wet Tuesday in March, in the year of Nicholas Ray's film bigger than life, in which James Mason memorably goes bonkers on cortisone and announces God was wrong. In one of Hollywood's finest moments, I wish I could say that the film and Dobson's declaration had some definite connection. The trouble is that the only record of what he said that day standing next to a gleaming puddle in the Bally wick of thromboses Magna is the text marigold to inscribed on the back of a toffee apple wrapper the next day. The writing that she used was is far too tiny to be read by the average human eye, or mine at any rate. This is doubly frustrating, as we have to take the wretched nesting birds word on trust path, when he asserts that the entire Declaration was nothing more than a garbled account of Dobson dropping his bus pass down a crevasse and obtaining a replacement from a kiosk infested with bats. Now I'm going to go and lie down again to a white my plum tomatoes and cravat.

news from the classical world now, as in the ancient world. This is about Helio gobblers, and it was written in fact, this is an account of Helio Gabba Helio gobblers, his death by Alexander Dumas. Not in one of his one of his novels, but in the preface to his grand Dictionary of cuisine. Helio gobblers made elaborate preparations for his own death, expecting that it would come in the midst of some uprising. He had a courtyard in his palace, paved with porphyry so that he might throw himself down on it from a high place. He had a steel dagger fitted with a diamond studded carved gold hilt to stab himself. He had a specially spun a rope of golden silk to strangle himself surprised in the latrine by his assassins, he choked himself to death on the sponge that to us montagnes expression the Romans used to wipe their behinds.
