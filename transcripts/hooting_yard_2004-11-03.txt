German fight southeast becoming cyclonic five or six, occasionally seven showers then rain. Good becoming moderate. Occasionally poor. Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. I'm Frank key. That was part of the shipping forecast for one day in October last year. And I thought you might like to hear it again because it's not often that you get the chance to hear repeats of the shipping forecast. Everything else gets repeated. So I think that should too. This is a quote this is called Tex Mex Jiffy bags sprites. Did you know that in the world of fairies there is a specific type of sprite which dwells within Jiffy bags of Tex Mex origin. These mischievous sprites are reluctant to leave the snug lining of their bags, except to flip from one to another when they become oh so lonesome, and feel compelled to procreate. If you creep ever so silently into a postal sorting office in El Paso, dead of night, you might be lucky enough to see a flickering sprite leaping between Jiffy bags. If it sees you, it will be vexed and cast a spell on you. And for 26 days and nights, you will be tormented by visions of potato headed monsters spewing Ecto plasm in every direction. But if the sprite does not see you, you will have good luck for a 12 month, possibly involving the unexpected offer of an appearance in a radio advertisement for a thrilling new detergent or bleach product. That any rate is what I was told by the weird woman over Whoo Hoo wee bee wood, and she has yet to be proved wrong in any of her pronouncements, or incantations. except for that one about the Badger in the hedge

writer's block. Even Dobson, the indefatigable pamphleteer occasionally suffered from writer's block. Whenever he was assailed by this pernicious malady, he took the advice of the country and western singer Tad to distantly related to his manual census and printer marigold. tabs true once wrote a song about the moon, and Dobson would dig out the old 78 and give it a few spins on the phonograph. He would then sit down at his escrow twang, and force himself to scribble sentences of a lunar kidney, carrying not a jot whether or not they made any sense. So for example, Dobson would write there are a few phosphorescent fancies about the moon, like Ignis factory, which we may dispose of those of them that are mythical or to Evanescence, to become full grown myths, and those which are religious or too volatile, to remain in the solution or salt of any bottled creed. Like the wandering lights of the Russians, answering to our winner the Wisp they are the souls of stillborn children. Or gulping lukewarm tap water as he worked. Dobson might scroll something like ecclesiastical history will declare how as early as the close of the fourth century, the women who were called Kala yridians worshipped the Virgin Mary as a moon goddess, and judged it necessary to appease her anger and seek her favor and protection by libations. sacrifices and oblations of cakes colori die this is better record of the women kneading dough to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven, as recorded by Jeremiah and proves that the relative position occupied by a start a in company with a bow. Juno with Jupiter duergar with Brahma and Matsu po with booed, is that occupied by Mary with God. And if he was feeling particularly fraught Dobson would even scribble this. I find circumstance occurred in the shipwreck of Santiago in 1585. The ship struck in the night, the wretched crew had been confessing singing litanies, etc. And this they continued till about two hours before break of day, the moon arose beautiful and exceeding bright. And for as much as till that time they had been in such darkness that they could scarcely see one another when close at hand. Such was the stir among them at beholding the brightness and glory of that orb. But most part of the crew began to lift up their voices, and with tears, cries and groans, called upon our lady saying that they saw her in the moon. Page after page of such verbal packs spewed from Dobson's pencil until he was overcome by cramps, at which point he would take the accumulated papers out to a field and cast them onto the winds in the night under the gleam of that mighty silver orb.

We all know that birds have tiny brains. But are they more intelligent than we think? Even finches are regarded as particularly stupid and described by some researchers, as the tabloid readers of the avian world can solve problems that would be beyond primates or human infants. In a study supervised by the husband and wife team of Nathan Emery and Nicola Clayton, researchers took a clear tube with a hole halfway along and laid it flat. They put food in the tube next to the hole. finches used a stick to pull the food out so it would not fall through the hole. primates and tiny tots push the food so it fall through the hole and he's lost. According to Emory. In another study, a team at Oxford University altered the size of the end of a tube containing food. When new Caledonian crows were given a branch containing twigs 29 out of 13 of them made tools have the right length and diameter to get to the food. It makes you wonder about that 30th crow. Perhaps it thought it was a Finch. In another experiment, Betty, a new Caledonian crow began to make hooks out of garden wire. She adapted the shape of the hook if it was not suited for a particular job. It is not explained what she was trying to do with her hooks, no doubt something crow like and Savage. Nor is it explained how this crow came to be called Betty, which seems to me an unusual name for a crow. If I have a crow, which I do not, but if I did, I would call it something like Cecilia or hortense. Or perhaps Clytemnestra. All those facts about finches and crows are absolutely true. And one additional note from crows, it's a short step to ravens and then to Edgar Allan Poe. As a child, apparently, Edgar Allan Poe's favorite pastime was to gather together all the horses, mules and cows that he could muster. Tie tin pans to their tails and drive them for miles up the road in the middle of the night.

The field of the cloth of gold Yes, that's what I said the field of the cloth of gold. That is where I have just been and it's where I want you to go. So up you get from your bed of straw, pin those crutches under your armpits and get cracking. I have made you a packed lunch of beetroot pie, potato foods and juice squeezed from nettles so you will not go hungry on your journey. Wait, I want you to take this hour with you. There are far too many field mice scurrying around in the field of the cloth of gold and the owl will tear them to shreds with its lacerating beak. The lucky ones will escape by running off to the adjoining field. If luck is something one can ascribe to mice. What do you think? Does Dame fortune shine her bright lantern on such tiny beasts? Originally only concerned with that which is human? Speaking of which, you'd better have a wash and spruce yourself up before you go. You look as if you haven't been out of that bed of straw for months. Just because all the bones in both of your legs are fractured beyond repair is no excuse. Why do you think I shelled out 10 fat coins to buy you the crutches? Why do you think I got old hengest DeVonish them so splendidly. Take the out of the field of the cloth of gold and come straight back. I have another job for you. The spigot is jammed or not for nothing Are you known as the man who can unjam spigots with his eyes shot. So get the hence

this is part one of a story called gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. Long Long ago, I think I read part three of the story on the show. Now I'm going to read part one and another time maybe a few more months I might read Part Two there are three parts in all this is part one gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams, part one September 1894. I had been marooned on the island for 11 weeks when I discovered the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams, rolled into a metal canister and wedged in a narrow crevice between two rocks. Taking a swig from my bag of turtles blood, I squatted on the ground and removed the diagrams from the canister. There were about a dozen large sheets, rather frayed around the edges but perfectly legible. The top left corner of each sheet had been stamped with an official device of the Bolivian administration showing an A scaption as a cigarette, the helmet of a Conquistador the hand of God and abbreviations in neat Italian lettering. The signature of what is supposed to be a petty Bolivian official had been scratched across each of the stamps in mode ink. munching a whelk. I turned my attention to the diagrams themselves. They were very complicated. I am no architect and at first all I could make out were mariadb lines, meeting angles and criss crossing each other seemingly at random. Most of the diagrams have been subjected to revision, and there was much evidence of erasure over printing and emendation. My studies were interrupted by a sudden and ferocious thunderstorm shoving the diagrams hastily back into the canister. Unfortunately tearing one of them. I hobbled back to my shelter, where my Viper was busy biting the head off an unidentified rodent tossing my crutches into the corner. I lay back on my palate and spent a profitable hour mucking about with bits of wire and driftwood to make a trap for bats. The life of a maroon on an island such as this is not unpleasant. Food is plentiful and easily gathered or slaughtered. The vegetation is lush and the animals are slow witted and crusting. On my very first day, I was able to bash out the brains of a badger which trundled innocently towards me as I sat on the beach, idling with my club. Quite what a badger was doing on the island is beyond me. I have not come across any others. But I am ever vigilant. I won't risk boring you by listing the stupendous array of equipment I managed to salvage from the wreck of my ship, the top of magnesium. Suffice to say, the club was not my only weapon, nor a matar, nor am I at a loss for a change of trousers. I have told you that I'm not an architect. The truth is, I cannot remember what I am. What trade or business I followed on dry land. Perhaps I was a jolly jack tar, but I think it's unlikely. I like to think that I was aboard the top of magnesium as a supernumerary passenger, a merchant of sorts, my cabin crammed with samples of tea or silk or mustard. In the final desperate moments, as the ship pitched and rolled and smashed against gleaming rocks, I received the blow to the head, which has impaired my memory. It was not the only injury I received. My right leg is only just recovering. I was very thankful that among the first items from the ship washed up on the beach, was a wooden box of sinner prisms from the surgeon's casket. In the first days of my marooning, the lifeless bodies of my shipmates were washed up on shore, white and puffed and gruesome. I ticked off the dead in an impromptu ledger, which I have since mislaid the bodies did not lie there long, enormous birds swooped out of the sky, hooked the dead in their vicious beaks and bore them off their nests and not on this island. I have searched every inch of it.

The gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams came to light on one of my earliest searches. For the first few weeks, I was so sure of being rescued by a passing smack or schooner that I could barely bring myself to move. I sprawled on the beach, knocking out the brains of a variety of curious animals, applying center prisms to my wounds and caches and covering myself with an old bit of sail cloth at night, or during rainfall. I lost a ship Hove interview, I hopped about like a mad thing shouting and raving and Latin, following the advice of my Jesuit mentors. Eventually, I realized that the craft I was hailing was none other than what was left of the top of magnesium scene from an advantageous angle. If the listener, you will expert in tides and currents in the pleasingly complex science of the movement of seas, I would ask you how it was that this broken record of a ship sailed about for nine or 10 weeks without sinking, only to return to the spot where razor sharp rocks hidden beneath the waves had pierced its fabric and brought about it doom. But I suspect that you are not expert in those matters. It was at this stage that I conquered my indolence and set to work. In 48 hours, I salvaged everything I could carry from the ship, constructed a raft knocked up a shelter from planks and sail cloth, knocked up another shelter when the first one collapsed on top of me, this time shoring up the sides with some sort of metal, killed eight turtles, made a store for buckets, dug some holes lost my ledger, a typical ran I found in the surgeon's casket and hardly paused for sleep. The next day I began my search of the island. I found a Mulberry Bush and some gemstones. On the second day I found bauxite deposits, a waterfall, big grains of sand and what looked like the bones of a horse. On the third day, I found the gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. On the fourth day, I found a crushed encampment of beetles and a cave full of the most loathsome Bats I had ever seen. So it went on day after day. In two weeks, I had covered the island. All the while I had been making careful notes. And now I rested and spent my days drawing an exquisitely detailed map. I tack this up above my palate. As night fell, and my blubber candles splattered, I lay back and considered my island home. With neriah, smack or schooner in sight, I could remain Maroon for years on end, my shelter may not last buffest as it was by howling winds and freezing rain, I decided that the best place for me to live would be the cave. So I declared war on the backs.

So that was part one of gigantic Bolivian architectural diagrams. Now earlier, I read some very exciting, factual information about birds. And we're going to continue with that kind of factual factual theme next, but just a couple of a couple of notices. One is that to remind you that the show is repeated at 830 on Saturday mornings. And the second is to let you know that I will be appearing live at the fener Fest in slouch in a couple of weeks time the 18th of November. The phenom fest is a festival as a two week celebration of the life and legacy of Fenner Brockway, the pacifist ex MP for and I'll give you more details about that next week, but it all sounds very exciting. And I thought I'd mention it. Anyway, factual information. First we had birds. Now I want to explain to you something I'm sure that it's quite important to most listeners, de worming your goat the hooting yard way. Is there anything more important in the early days of November than be worming your goat? If you're a pig fixated person you may wish to defer. But most if not all hooting yard listeners will want to assure ensure that their go to innocent of worms in this critical month in the Capra hircus, or domestic goat lifecycle. here then are some useful tips. Listen to them carefully making notes on a scrap of paper as appropriate. For you will want to refer to the tips once you've ranged across the fields in your big leaking boots to the goat cubicles. If possible, always weigh your goat before de worming it. Use any old scales you can lay your hands on, but preferably ones in which when goats will squat happily for a minute or two. When you have weighed your goat, you will be able to calculate and inject or drench the correct dosage of the de wormer. If you underdose your goat because of failure to weigh it, or because you fecklessly underestimate just how bulky or indeed and bulky it is, this may be a costly mistake, it may lead to your goat developing that most fearsome of conditions. That is parasite resistance to D wormers. But don't rest on your laurels like a smug goat person. Because, conversely, an overdose of certain proprietary d wormers can cause health problems. If not for your goat, then for you and for your immediate family. And for the neighbors up in a big black house on the hill. All sorts of hideous running sores, boils and separations can occur if you overdose your goat, although I'm not quite sure how that happens in a strictly scientific sense. Nevertheless, you do not want to upset those eerie lantern jawed named lantern jawed neighbors of yours after what happened in march up in the hills during a thunderstorm with all that eldritch and inhuman howling. Do you

copied copied c u p p ID is, as you might expect related to Cupid c u p ID, although there is a lot more than that extra p to help you distinguish between them. copied is composed of both toxic, toxic and non toxic gases and tinkles a little Golden Bell whenever it alights upon their hairy back of a bison, which it often does. For carpets favorite haunts are the vast plains of North America. I say it, because copied is if not exactly a hermaphrodite, neither male nor female. Although sometimes when it's gases cool and take on liquid form. It can bear a fugitive resemblance to Sonja Henie 1912 to 1969 the legendary Norwegian figure skating champion. such moments can be dangerous for copied for it is volatile and seeks warmer air urgently to return to its gaseous state. copied is invoked by farmers, and by those who work with timber, for it brings them luck. Conversely, wrestlers and plutocrats live in fear of a visitation by KappaHD and tremble as its approach. You can be sure that if you ever see a trembling plutocrat copied is not far away. Some side copied can be trapped in an envelope or small carton, and used for both good and ill. The common feature of such tales is that not one of them has ever been verified. Toy plastic cup IDs coated with a special varnish to ape the appearance of gas have recently become popular as gifts for children in dawlish, oswestry and utakata. This geographical exclusivity is due to factors unique to KappaHD including the risk of suffocation, impending thirst, and three or four empty metal pails lined up in a row on the site of a long ago mudslide. copied rotates.

That's nearly the end of this week's visit to hooting yard. But a couple more things. One of them is is this is what Jared Manley Hopkins, the great Victorian Jesuit poet, author of the wreck of the Deutschland, among other things, this is what Jared Manley Hopkins wrote in his diary on the 24th of September 1863. Grind grind good, great, great, great crash crash. Crack crate crate grab culus. crackle. I said that was going to be two more things but I think we need to leave it there because that's how do you follow that? How do you follow that? So bye and see you next week.
