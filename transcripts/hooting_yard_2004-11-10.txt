Good afternoon, this is resonance 104 point four FM and this is hooting yard on the air and my name is Frank key. Thought I begin this week with some notes on jellyfish. There came a time when marigold true growing, exasperated by Dobson's listlessness, encouraged him to get involved in amateur dramatics. The out of print pamphleteer formed a group entitled the jellyfish players and issued a prospectus, hoping to gain bookings in various derelict seaside theaters during the winter months. The company's first production was strange and poisonous aquatic beings, a loose adaptation of ex hostage Brian Canaan's book an evil cradling in Dobson's hands out wet the Celtic bardic posturing, the romanticized vision of an intense poetic response to a terrible ordeal, and in came gnomic baffling speeches, which appeared to have more to do with life on the ocean floor than with a claustrophobic seller in Beirut. The production closed after two nights, and Dobson and his cohorts were chased out of town by an enraged group a school called the children of Hibernia, fanatical mystics, who had claimed the bearded figure of Kenan as their prophet. Back home marigold to try to point out to Dobson the gravity of his miscalculations, and had him read many stupendous tomes on dramatic theory. She was not aware, however, that in the middle of the night by torchlight Dobson was devouring Victorian melodramas and French fasces by the dozen the following winter, somehow managing to come and do an end of the pier Playhouse in valg by the sea, the jellyfish players unveiled a four hour show entitled my plankton theory. Dobson's foolish friend, Bala Slav Carnegie Guggenheim had a hand in the play script, which one critic described as outright gibberish. When the players took to the stage for the first night, dressed up to the nines in hand-sewn lobster costumes, they were disconcerted by the audience, which reacted to the broad knockabout comedy, as if it were the most harrowing of tragedies. Several theater goers in the front row sat sobbing, convulsed by grief, and one eye witness told the local newspaper that there was gnashing of teeth and rending of garments in the upper circle. Despite this misunderstanding of his intentions, Dobson kept the show running for 11 months, even when nobody actually turned up to watch. Only when he was hospitalized, following a mishap with a drenched and disorientated trumpeter Swan did the play close. By the time he recovered, Dobson had become so obsessed with his investigations into the fatal Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash, that he abandoned his dramatic ambitions forevermore, and his amanuensis marigolds true, made no attempt to revive them. Instead, she devoted her energies to potato gardening, and was awarded many many glittering prizes.

More about Dobson now, Dobson was one of the few pamphleteers of the 20th century who still took seriously the medieval theory of the four bodily humors to remind listeners who forgotten and informed those who don't know, here is a commendably concise paragraph from humorous Dobson an unpublished essay by marigold true. Taking the Aristotle alien elements in turn, the theory was as follows. Earth is reflected in the body as black bile as a yellow bile, fire as blood and waters phlegm. From these derive the terms melancholic, choleric sanguine, and phlegmatic Dobson never deviated from his belief that the theory was fundamentally correct. He tended towards melancholy. And it should be said he was so convinced that he also subscribed to the related practice of bloodletting with leeches. Dobson was rarely ill, but when he was, he had a devil of a time trying to find a doctor who would treat him as he wished. On his 61st birthday, suffering from an excess of black bile, he was in luck or so he thought. An alternative therapist could open their doors just down the road. Dobson presented himself and demanded leaching. He was shown into a back room and low leeches were applied to his spindly legs. Unfortunately, the quack used leeches of the genus hell Abdulla, glossy funny die rather than hirudo medic analysis. The latter is as its name implies, the medicinal leech. It is a quaint dark cylinder which has 33 body rings, five pairs of eyes, several pairs of testes and two suckers, one at which one at each end of its body, the head sucker searches and penetrates while the tail sucker hold fast to the host. The result of the wrong type of leech being used was so vile that I shan't repeat it here. Dobson was lucky to survive, but he did Thank the Lord. If you decide to have your blood sucked by leeches, take a helpful anatomical diagram of hirudo medicine knowledge with you, then you will be able to check that your practitioner is using the correct type of leech and you can rest easy.

Those of you who look at the hooting yard website from from whence all this springs, and then know that every every bulletin from the for three or four or five times a week, occasionally even six or seven times a week, every bulletin begins with a quotation. And a number of readers to the website have written in and asked me how I choose the quotations. I wish it was as simple as saying, Well, you know, I browse books and I find a sentence or a paragraph that tickles my fancy for Who among us doesn't like having their fancy tickled? In truth though, the process is hideously complicated. When I developed the initial concept for the website towards the end of last year, I was covering page after page of a big writing test. But with notes diagrams, graphs, squiggles, and it has to be said the occasional savage doodle born of fractiousness. And it seemed to me that mere whim was not an acceptable way of making the selection. After all, the rest of the content of the web page or web pages, adheres to a system albeit a very deep system. And so social quotations. So what I did was to design an Olympian constraint to govern my choices. And careful study of the quotations included on the site will reveal that there's a profound logic at work determining which words by which author are excerpted at any particular point on the calendar. So abstruse is the scheme that the launch of of the website which ought to have taken place in October 2003, was delayed until mid December, I spent six or seven weeks devising the system. Having cast aside the original writing tablet and obtained a fresh one, just to work on what I had code named, like it was some kind of military adventure, operation, quote of the day for the hooting yd website, or OQTDFTHYW for short. Without wishing to lay bare the rules by which the system operates. I think it's worth pointing out that well as an example, the quote that appears newly on on the website today. It's the 10th of November. The title of the book cited includes the word poise. The extract itself consists of four sentences, and two of those sentences refer to an apparatus designed to deflect rainfall. Here's the quotation. It's from a book called poise, how to attain it by the Stark. We have heard of a man who was so lacking in poise that he lost his situation, because when summoned by his chief, he became so confused that he forgot to leave his streaming umbrella in the outer office. It was an extremely wet day, and the unfortunate man, instead of being able to plead his cause, effectively, became hopelessly embarrassed at perceiving his mistake, the results of which it is needless to state, we're by no means to the benefit of the floor. His despair at the sight of the reveal, it's that running from his umbrella spread themselves over the polished surface of the wood, prevented him from thinking of anything but his unpardonable stupidity. He was replaced by someone else at the first opportunity, on the pretext that the direction of important affairs could no longer be left in the hands of a man of such notorious incapacity.

There is a tribe of people who dwell beyond those purple hills, who worship a God with pause. It has no other name, or at least not one that is ever spoken aloud by the members of the tribe, nor written down for they do not write as we would understand the term. The God with paws apparently forbids any image to be made of it. So we have no idea what it looks like how many poses Have? How tall is it? Does it have just one head or many heads? What living creature does it resemble? if any? We do not know the answers to any of these questions. For the tribes people are unwilling or unable to answer them. For the same reason, it is futile to quiz them about the part played in their culture by the God with pools, for they grow mute or the chatterboxes among them, change the subject or simply wander away to check their stockpiles of macadamia nuts. There has been some conjecture that by worshipping a God with paws for tribes people imply the existence of other gods, the God with hooves perhaps, or the God with flippers. But no hard evidence of such belief has come to light. The God with pause in habits are hot on the edge of the tribes village. No one is allowed within a certain distance of it. But at sunset each day, everyone gathers in a circle around the heart and stares at it in rapt, if somewhat ill tempered silence. It is thought that the people are given instructions by the God with pores communicated in some unknown, extra sensory manner. But the nature of these commands, and whether or not the people take a blind bit of notice of them is unclear. I have knitted myself a pair of poor like mittens, and intend to impersonate the God of pause just to see what happens. I'll let you know.

I'm sorry about that i CRO appears to be hanging around in the studio. bit difficult to deal with really. But never mind. Because in fact, that's quite useful because it brings us on to another piece that involves birds, although not crows, out. It's still here, but it seems to have gone silent. Occasionally, if you observe closely, it's possible to watch a crisis developing in a clump of sage. On any given day, the crisis may involve sedge warblers. That's the type of bird isn't a crow. But it's unlikely to match the features of any of the six crises examined by Richard Milhouse Nixon, in his 1962 book of that title. Search crises tend to be riverbank II by definition. So in addition to the aforementioned sedge warblers, one may also find that otters, frogs, or hand carved wooden decoyed ducks are involved. In the case of frogs, it's advisable to make tape recordings of their croaks. These can then be analyzed at leisure back in the comfort of one's laboratory attended by mungo, the disfigured factotum it is not recommended to make recordings of any quacks which seemed to have the decoy ducks as their source. As these are, of course, utterly fraudulent, and many hours diligent lab time will be wasted as a result. If one has to pay rental for the laboratory space, this can be financially ruinous, thus compromising one's ability to resolve a sense of crisis, in some instances fatally. Know that most common sense crises can be dealt with quite effectively by the amateur and the whole thing should blow over within a week. Special patrol units dedicated to this type of work ought to be called in if the sedge crisis lasts longer. telephone numbers for more than a dozen such teams can be found in the directory of sege crisis resources, available money by mail order. Unfortunately, there are some imposters who prey on the naive and the credulous genuine crisis teams will always, always wear caps with ear flaps as soon as possible after the sedge crisis has been dealt with a full written report in the international standard format must be submitted to the authorities. This is a legal requirement and failure to comply will result in criminal charges and deportation to a secret facility disguised as a cream cracker factory, where the malefactor will be poked out with forks, and bashed on the head with a big iron utensil.

Just time I ought to mention once again, before, I'm just gonna have a sip of tea. Which now I could have done while the music was on, but I didn't. Just another reminder that next week on Thursday, the 18th of November at the fener Fest in selecao in honor of Fenner Brockway, the pacifist x MP for Slayer on Thursday, the 18th of November at eight o'clock on woods in St. Mary's Church. I'll be appearing reading stuff accompanied by the bloody poet, john Shepard, and Fawzia Rahman. And there might even be other people there. That's happening on on the 18th of November. Which it's a bit we'll be a bit late for this. Which is, in fact, it's already a bit late for this because this is a kind of this is a Guy Fawkes Night thing. Remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. Remember to the case of the distressed pig solved by special agent blot. The distressed pig was found in a rowing boat crossing 10 Tara bin Lake, Agent blocked swam out to it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becomed agent blocked took the oars and he rode to the mud splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of the boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plotted his way in his Wellington boots to the pig farmers hat down the lane, and he felt the brute with a threat of his fist and bound him up with a chain. Agent blocks drag the pig farmer off to the prison, banging the center of town and that is why on November the fifth, the distressed pig did not drown.

smooching with istvaan many, many women, and not a few men have their stories of the time they smooched with his van. Their recollections have been anthologized in a new book entitled smooching with his van in which they reminisce about their smooching. One of those his memories is not included, are not included as memory one of the car think of a grammar they're one of those whose memories are not included is alleged Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, who is known to have smooched with Istvan in Fort Worth, Texas nightclub early in 1963. Soon after his return from the Soviet Union his there refers to Oswald not just fun, although it's fun him had himself visited the USSR or in Cyrillic what looks like the cccp on many occasions, smooching with Olga, Natasha, Yuri, Boris and Svetlana among others. It has to be said that most of these tales are mundane, boring and even unreadable. From time to time, however, the diligent reader comes upon a nugget of splendor, such as this brief passage from an unnamed resident of the landed jumped to the frightening sea. Tip larks sang, German leaders, singers gathered petunias and hellebore were in bloom, and a new DVD of William Betty they young roseus was at last available in the shops. I pootled off to the dancehall planning little more than an evening of glum pinch mouth misery. But his van was there. I smooshed with him for two hours, his cravat was so so dashing. Now, as I sit in my beat chart, peering intently at all walks and turns through my binoculars. I think of that night and my heart pounds with something which may well be excitement. Copies of smooching with Istvan are not yet available, as they have been impounded by shadowy figures wearing tunics woven from 1000s upon 1000s of hairs plucked from pipistrelle bats.

Nearly the nearly the end of this week show now But wait, the beginning of the show, I spoke about quotations and the quotations that appear on the heating yard website. And here are two. I like these. The first is from Arnold Bennett, the novelist who wrote a small book called literary taste, how to form it. And he wrote, to my mind, one of the most beautiful words in the English language is pavement, enunciate it, study it sound and see what you think. It is also in jus biteable, that certain combinations of words have a more beautiful sound than certain other combinations. Thus, Tennyson held that the most beautiful line he ever wrote was the mellow ouzel floating in the Elm. Perhaps a sound it was, but does it live in the memory is one of the rare great tenor sonian lines? It does not. And that's what Arnold Bennett thought pavement he liked pavement that and that more about words, really this is from a book called on the study of words by Richard Shanna Vic's trench. Who wrote what a record of great social revolutions, revolutions in nations and in the feelings of nations, the one word Frank contains, which is used as we all know, to express order that is generous, straightforward and free. And that's all we have time for this week. So I'll me Frank will be back with you generous, straightforward and free next week. Bye.

The crowd is still here to try and get rid of it by next week.
