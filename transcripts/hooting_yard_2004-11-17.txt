Good afternoon, you're listening to resonance 104 point four FM. As you know, this is heating yard on the air. It's that time of Wednesday afternoon again, my name is Frank key and I'm going to read various things to you as the as the half hour goes on. I'd like to begin with telling you that the Blodgett global domination Institute, has issued a new pamphlet containing a series of practical brain exercises to encourage it says here are quote, enhanced thinking patterns for all and sundry. The pamphlet has been given the somewhat Tweety title, put on your thinking cap, exclamation mark, although I doubt that that will improve sales. Anyway, here exclusively for hooting yard are two tips for listeners to try out. This is the Blodgett global domination Institute's practical brain exercises. One place an envelope on a flat surface, such as a table or desktop. If you are short of furniture the floor will do. Now, very carefully with your fingertips, push the envelope gently across the surface. To obtain a large box, if it has a lid, remove it. Stand in the box or if it's big enough sit or squat. After a few minutes, clamber out of the box and start to think about something. From practical brain exercises, it's a short step to practical see goal exercises. If you have a Pepsi goal, it's extremely important to ensure that it gets the requisite amount of exercise. Have you got any idea how dangerous it is for a seagull to become idle and listless? Many seabird doctors have over the years, being driven to despair by the negligence of certain people who keep see goals as pets. One such medic whose name by weird coincidence is a perfect anagram of awk turn guillemots, gold, has written a memoir in which he lambastes some of the feckless seaside resort inhabitants whose goals he came to tend. His language is at times violent, but what shines through the pros is a great love for seabirds, and an almost pathological loading of human beings. In an appendix, the doctor recommends certain exercises which the responsible goalkeeper ought to encourage a bird to perform as part of its fitness regime. mindful of the depressed economies of most coastal regions, all of the exercises are designed to cost little in the way of kit. For example, goal exercise number 10, which I'll read to you in a moment, involved nothing more than access to a limitless supply of corrugated cardboard. here then is gold exercise number 10. fetch a few large sheets of corrugated cardboard and take them to your seagull. Announce in a loud voice that you will reward the bird with a bucket of fish heads and n trails. If it tears the corrugated cardboard to pieces with its fearsome beak. Stand well back. Most well balanced seagulls will shred the corrugated cardboard in a matter of minutes. Note, if you do not actually have a bucket full of fish heads and end trails to hand with which to reward the goal at the end of its exercise. It may become angered and vengeful. So make sure you're wearing protective clothing and have removed all traces of fish odor from yourself by bathing in lemon juice, or alternatively by keeping as far away from the harbor as you can, especially at those times that the fishing boats come into port with their catch of sprats and gudgeon.

The big smushed and the bunkers topiary man is who do and collapse. I will tell you how it happened in November 1919. In Holland, his besmirched his mismanagement was physical rather than moral, but no less catastrophic for that. He was walking beside a pond and an evil eyed tiny one career towards him on a tricycle. In stepping aside to avoid a collision, he lost his footing and fell into the pond. And the pond was stagnant and brackish and rife with all that slimy green wispy stuff found in stagnant, brackish ponds. So when he clambered out onto the path, sopping wet and lagoo breus his clothing was besmirched. He was poor and had but that one suit of clothes, and so he remained besmirched. His being bonkers. His parents ran a private asylum, and he grew up in its grounds. his earliest pals with a mad caps, moons and holy innocence, who were incarcerated they're never diagnosed as a lunatic himself. He nonetheless exhibited eccentricities, and harbored strange casts of thought which led the wider world to view him as a zany even 40 years after his parents perished in the flames which laid waste their asylum. His topiary How I wish I could write, he was the finest topia theorist the Netherlands had ever produced, but I cannot, for he was not in truth, his topiary was inept. More often than not, those few who came to view his work were unable to identify what he had meant to depict. By rifling through newspaper accounts. We know for example, that when he unveiled his gigantic Belgian hedge entitled Judith slaying holofernes the citizens of Antwerp thought they were looking at a representation of a giant pig. Similarly, the foliage portrait of Pope Pius the ninth was mistaken for a fruit bat. The hoodoo. This besmirched and bonkers man had the signal misfortune to be placed under a hoodoo, by forces both malevolent and uncanny. All attempts to extricate himself from the hoodoo, only made it more malign. The actual details are too sickening to recount. But let it be said that the last angels played their pipes and bright wings bought his soul to Heaven is collapse. It was Thursday, he sat under the shade of a big tree with many branches and countless leaves. He was chewing a Brazil nut and reading a paperback copy of a dictionary of glues. A chaffinch sang and the sky was blue. His matted hair had been cut the day before, and his boots were freshly repaired. The raucous hubballi hoys whose tunings ruined his morning had gone off to cause mayhem on the railway tracks. He had been able to afford a pair of swimming trunks and planned a dip in a nearby canal. He swallowed what was left of the Brazil nut, put the book in his sexual stood up and began to walk towards the arm palace. halfway across the shimmering lawn, he collapsed. It was the very end of him.

Unknown Speaker  09:38
I've recently referred in another piece to an outbreak of cases of botsman syndrome, and certain medically minded listeners have written in to seek further information about this modern Scourge. It's a modern Scourge as opposed to a perennial Scourge because the first recorded case is from a few months ago According to the medical journals to which I subscribe, or be that in a paper presented to the first conference devoted to blockman syndrome in Helsinki in September, one doctor, Xavi, a illegible of Samarkand, referred to a pandemic and the land of geese during the 15th century, which may well have been an earlier instance of the condition, although we cannot be sure, and Dr. elegibles documentation has been questioned by both eminent physicians and by a few cantankerous autodidact, Chief among the latter, the infamous nincompoop father Ignacio twinkling priest, Potter, topi theorist and champion of flat tourism, the ones popular dietary technique involving much chewing, much chewing they're not to be confused with the village of that name were twinkling by an uncanny coincidence lived and this sentence has gone on for far too long. So it must end now or soon, though, the sooner the better for all our sakes. There. botsman syndrome is named after the man who first isolated it in laboratory conditions, whose name was botsman. He had never met father tweaking, although he had encountered the priest sister on some kind of management training paint ball exercise in Woodland, to which he went on sufferance after threats from his superior, a man whose psychometric tests showed him to be and I quote from the hitherto confidential report, flabby, petulant and fixated upon cashew nuts. botsman pelted father twinkling sister with twigs and berries, for he refused to carry a paintball gun. At sunset, he sat down and swept his hands across the forest floor. The generic term for all that stuff found on the ground in forests and woodland, by the way, is Duff. Something blots man's fingers brushed lightly against gave him a piercing insight into the syndrome, which now bears his name. He dashed back to the lab, did a few experiments with a Bunsen burner and some substances mentioned in the Old Testament, and wrote up his findings in a frenzy, pressing the blotting paper to his scroll. As dawn broke, lighting a cheroot he stepped outside and encountered a dairy person on her way to milk cows. I have just isolated the agency whereby folk fall victim to a malady, the nature of which has been befogged and blurry into the best minds in the field of medicine, said botsman to the rosy cheeked maiden at five o'clock in the morning. Unfortunately, her brain was so thoroughly consumed by a cryptic crossword clue that she ignored him, and thus, a love that could have conquered everything, a love of intense passion that would have been written down the ages, like that of Avalon and helwys or crystallin. And result was doomed never to spark blockman named his syndrome, that dairy maid milked her cows, but the two were destined never to meet again on this planet, or in any other existence that motto white to lonely stars in a boundless and incomprehensible firmament.

And if you don't celebrate Christmas, you could always buy presents to celebrate Dobson's birthday which happens to be sometime around around the same time as Christmas.

Unknown Speaker  16:12
Speaking of Dobson one of the more arresting facts about Dobson is that he spent a five year period living in an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. Such as the hold on him of this location, he devoted no less than 16 pamphlets to it. According to Alyssa Aloysius nesting bird dogs and wrote more words about this factory than on any other topic. What was it about the place that exerted such a fascination upon Dobson? How significant is it that during his stay there, the factory was still functioning, producing 1000s of tins of evaporated milk every week, and not as it is today? An abandoned ruin, populated only by screeching birds? Was the workforce aware that the pamphleteer had taken up residence in an unused room on the mezzanine floor, and that he had attached his own design of bolts and latches to the door to prevent his being disturbed. Or that the carefully lettered sign on the door reading Sq Perkins, janitorial Padre was a fake of Dobson's own devising. Was Dobson responsible for the occasional small theft of a few tins of evaporated milk noted in a big ledger by the management security team. Was it really necessary for the security team to march about the premises in gangs of four dressed in uniforms not unlike those of a fascist you're into a company by howling slavering dogs, each as tall as a 10 year old? Were the dogs skittish when taken to their kennels at the end of a security patrol. Data wet behind the ears Jr, evaporated milk technical consultant take the rap for the missing tins. Was he dismissed? And did he have his epaulette thrown into the shredder? What in the name of heaven was Dobson doing in that room for five years? Why are the answers to all of these cogent questions entirely absent from Dobson's pamphlets? And most importantly, now that the factory is abandoned and in ruins what

birds screech there now. factual information time now a bit late though, because this is factual information from May 1855. When a mag when the eclectic magazine published the following the origin of fires is now so narrowly inquired into by the officers of the brigade by means of inquests that we have been made acquainted with a vast number of curious causes which would never have been suspected. From an analysis of fires which have occurred since the establishment of the brigade. We have constructed the following list of causes of fires. curtains, candle flus, stoves, gas light dropped down area, lighted tobacco falling down area, dust falling on hold resonsible flew. doubtful incendia ism carelessness intoxication dog

Also, as as regular listeners know I do like to throw in quotations from other writers, usually most weeks. This is from john Harris and his book inferences from haunted houses and haunted men. He wrote a noise like the continual explosion of pet odds. Another like the falling of a large animal against his bedroom door. Another noise like spirit wraps and shrieks were heard by Father Ah, no one else then heard them. Father, he heard them for eight nights and not on the ninth. As a priest, he was probably a good deal alone and had to walk over to a cottage behind a belt of woods to the eastward weather retreat of the nuns He attended to was held. According to the average experience of Miss friers party, he would only have been attacked on about two days.

Here's an old folk song actually has a new focus on I'm not going to sing it to you because I can't sing. Although you'll be pleased to hear that it has been set to music or is about to be set to music by the by the wonderful ever, who may be playing summer in London near you. Soon. It's called on the Bonnie Bonnie banks. On the Bonnie Bonnie banks of the foul old lock where a dredger applied from shore to shore. I saw my true love pluck some furs and place it in her hair. My True Love was a wandering last of a clan that herded cows and she broke her back when she had a mishap with a trampoline for her folk herded cows through the seasons long but they also jumped and leaped they would wander into the market square of a town Down in some detail, and they bounce up and down and gamble about wearing coats of many hues and the songs they sang. Oh the songs they sang were as strange as strange could be. I remember one that went Vienna, it means nothing to me. All caked and painted were their carts, yellow green and blue. But my true loves cart was black as pitch as black as the raven and crow. I stand in the hills in an icy Gale wondering where Will my true love go? Green grow the rashes on those Bonnie Bonnie banks. The last week we had a crow in the studio and it seems to have reappeared I don't know what we're gonna do about this. We're gonna have to try and get rid of this crow sooner or later. Yeah, I'll see what I can do hold on a second. Here's a we've we've had a focus on his a fairy story, a fairy story. Once upon a time, there was a debauch fairy named bind we'd bind we'd who liked to dress in fashionable foreign made fairy clothes had a fairy sister called ring rot. Ring rot was jaded and neurotic. On the day, the big spaceship with its whirling propellers landed in dandy line del bind Weeden ring Ron ring rot went skipping along to greet the goose splattered alien beings. The screech bind weed, aren't they sickening? Ring rock began to vomit right next to the spaceship. The goo splattered alien beings were extremely disturbed by this bestie or behavior. They climbed back into this spaceship and flew off to another planet called Xuxa k 79. Good night children. The end of this week show I'd like to read you another quotation This is an exciting quotation from the thing that dined on death by someone called john H. Knox. What you may notice is that ever, all of the adjectives in this quotation are also we're also there in the little fairy story. Is that a coincidence? Exactly the same adjectives? It was merrowed dark, the fashionable radio astrologer
