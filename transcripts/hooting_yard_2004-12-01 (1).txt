Hello there, my name is Frankie it's four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon on resonance 104 point four FM. That can mean only one thing. That means that we're visiting hooting yard cue here some kind of spooky music baps or maybe I don't know, some other kind of music What do you think? I want to bestow a prize on Mr. blackfin a cup perhaps or trophy or just a cup. He's just published his second book. The first was a word for word transcription of that hideous strength by CS Lewis. differing from the original only in the sentences are jumbled up in no particular order, or not one that I can decipher in his post face, Mr. Black Finch claims to have and I quote, rested from this lamentable Christian apologists noxious sci fi potboiler, a new an urgent text or read text or Uber text. Or we might go so far as to say a proto blackfin ceske text the one he meant to write had he not been CS Lewis Baker that what you will, or as I did dismiss it as the ravings of a nincompoop? No, the reason I want to give Mr. Black Finch some sort of award is because his second book is a delightful and entertaining memoir, rather than a vapid bit of twaddle. Not only that, but it rekindled my own memories of that very special time in the early 1970s. When it seemed that crowd rock could revolutionize the way we listen to popular music. Remember, Amazon duel? match magma. Popo boo? sodas Mr. Black Finch? Well, he gives each of these groups are mentioned in his index, even if they're curiously absent from the body of the text itself. But that can be excused. Excuse me that can be excused to for the book. My two tonic memory banks, as it's called, is essentially a narrative of the author's experience as a sound engineer with the now forgotten group dobe. Soon dobe soon took their name from the out of print pamphleteer Dobson and the lyrics to all their songs are taken from illegal German translations of some of his more, shall we say, arresting ornithological texts, the moving spirit in daube soon, with lead singer Spinetta just an all round wild man of rock horse brought some camera vandalized, who founded who found a cache of pirated Dobson pamphlets when sorting through his father's papers after the latter's death. bratan tamon verbalised Senior died during the so called weans terror of 1967. It is to our great good fortune that Mr. Black vinci's memoir ends before the group degenerated into the turgid, heavy metal monsters they became commercial success ruined them of course, and they were never quite the same after being invited to support the captain and to kneel on a tour of Canada, Alaska and Papua New Guinea as the 1970s ground to an ignominious end. Join me then as I beat my breast earnestly raining 1001 thank us upon Mr. Black finches remarkably a tired head for reminding me of the glorious days of those ear splitting yet valiant LPs poison linate and the 10,000 chaffinches of Dr. T.

I'd like to dedicate this next piece to a pansy cradle Jew who for once might be listening to the show today. She doesn't normally But anyway, this is for pansy and it's called my little blind Dolly. I have a little blind Dolly. She is still stuffed with straw. I have not named her yet. I have only had her for half an hour. I found her on a patch of waste ground half an hour ago. I was out walking. I suppose I should say I was out limping because I limp when I walk. My left leg is shorter than my right leg, on account of a mysterious childhood illness. I was limping along near the canal when I passed a patch of waste ground and saw the blind Dolly stuffed with straw. She had been abandoned possibly by some ungrateful infant in gratitude is the besetting sin of today's infants. That is my opinion, not shared by all. rooting around on the waste ground, I noticed other things, including a pair of blue buttons, I think I can say with some confidence that they were made of Bakelite. I supposed that they may have been the eyes of my little blind Dolly once upon a time, but they had become detached, perhaps when she was thrown with a certain amount of violence onto the patch of waste ground from the wound down window of a Chevrolet passing at high speed in the backseat of which and ungrateful infant was throwing a tantrum. That would fit the fact as I found them. I did think about sewing the buttons back onto my little blind Dolly's cloth head about 25 minutes ago, but decided against doing so. She has been robbed of her sight, and I do not presume to play God. I have placed both buttons in my pocket However, in case they come in handy for another purpose, a purpose which will be revealed to me at the Jew time. For the moment, I'm concerned with selecting a name for my little blind Dolly. No doubt to the ungrateful infant who tossed her aside had a name for her. But in 20,000 years, I would be unable to guess what it was. It's not as if she has her name embroidered on the soul of her cloth foot. At home, I have a whole shelf full of books by Tony Buzan. They are all packed with tips to make better use of my brain, but not one of them tells me how to pronounce the author's name. Is it Busan or bqs. An until I find out my little blind Dolly will have to have two names. She will be Susan Buzan or Suzanne Suzanne. I am going to make a little black cape for her to wear. Just like Tony Buse and cape only smaller because she is not a living breathing maker of mind maps. She is just my little blind Dolly. I will find a small piece of cloth for the cape. And if it's not already black, I will have to dye it or smear it all over with black boot polish. I have got more black boot Polish than I know what to do with. I often think about that song by Jethro towel. Dr. Bogan broom, because I bought all the boot Polish from a cobbler named Mr. Bogan broom, when he shut up his shop. He told me he was going to see but he did not say which See, he meant it could have been the Baltic, the red or the dead, or one of the other ones. I didn't ask him because he was quite a frightening man. And in those days, I did not have my little blind Dolly to hide behind. But now I have a nothing will ever frighten me again.

From my little blind Dolly to my little blind crow. So there I was, kneading dough, thinking about Edgar Allan Poe, and my heart fit to burst about my little blind crow. The moon was full and it cast a glow. Santa's in the chimney said whoa, whoa, whoa. I wept hot tears for myself. Little blind crow. The wind death how the Gale death blow. They used to call Starling, Uncle Joe. But Starling never sobbed all night for my little blind crow. Parsley, sage, rosemary and time. Brother, can you spare a dime? Sister Are you too crumpled with Whoa, when you think about my little blind crow? They say that starlings, five year plans made Russia strong. But that has nothing to do with my song. I want it sector music by status quo, a sad sad song for my little blind crow.

This is called the adventures of tiny Enid. Tiny Enid knew all there was to know about the capture of ostriches. As we sat together, gulping down tumblers of lukewarm tap water, she gave me some tips. Here are some precautions she said. avoid excessive exertion and rough handling during capture. Otherwise, sudden death or permanent collapse will occur as a result of muscle damage. Or structures that go down as a result of capture stress, usually die of secondary problems, such as pneumonia or renal failure. It is imperative that stress factors be minimized. Capture only at low ambient temperature around 28 degrees centigrade. Prevent over exertion and minimize handling of the captured birds. when attempting to capture ostrich region camps or in small enclosures, be very careful not to herd the ostriches into the fence. The fence can be used as a guide to steer the bird into a capture Boma, but not as a net broken legs and lacerations are the usual outcome of a poorly planned capture operation. Ensure that iron standards and fallen trees are not in the path of the running birds. Once an ostrich is caught, always be aware that the powerful legs are effectively used for defense. The bird will try to dissemble or at least maintain its captors. Stay away from the front of the bird unless you have control of the head with the neck held at full extension and lower than the birds back. Those are very useful hints. Tiny Enid, I said and I was grateful to have heard them for who knew when I might be sent out to capture an ostrich I haven't finished yet Lancelot. She said my name is not Lancelot, but tiny Enid had for many years had a fixation upon the actor Lance Percival, and the symptoms of her mania cropped up in unexpected ways. I made a snap decision not to contradict her, for she had been known to throw fits and dribble when confused, and I hated having to mop up anybody's dribble, let alone tiny needs. Go on, I said for mass capture of ostriches in a large camp or in the wild, she continued, the use of the plastic capture Boma is very successful. Young ostriches up to two years of age are often found in large groups called crashes. These crash units can number up to 60 birds. Due to their strong herding instinct. These units can easily be manipulated and chased into a capture Boma using a helicopter. Once the ostriches are in the Boma, they should be allowed to rest for at least an hour before they are loaded. Excited and hot birds tend to panic when loaded immediately into mass crates and will pile on top of each other and trample each other. The use of a shield to force the birds gently forward and up the ramp will minimize injury to the birds and the handlers large aggressive male ostriches. can sometimes be problematic. They should be placed on their own in separate crates. That sounds like a very good idea. Tiny Enid, I said, as she paused for a sip of her water. across the fields, we could see wild hogs careering madly into the swamp, and the faint silhouette of a water colorist sat at their easel attempting to capture the scene. When time is not a factor, said tiny Enid, a pop up corral set up around a watering point or a small patch of Lucerne with supplemental feeding is a useful method for the capture of ostriches. The birds are allowed to enter the capture corral on their own, and stress levels are kept to a minimum as no chasing of the birds occurs. She paused again, took a cigarillo from her pocket and asked me if I had any matches. I fumbled for my little box, but it was damp.

Frank Key  16:06
I'm afraid my matches are damp, tiny Enid, I said. If you blow on them, they will eventually become dry Lancelot, she advised while you do so here are some final points. Never capture ostriches or high ambient temperatures. Do not handle ostriches, roughly during capture, do not chase the birds excessively during the capture procedure. Never use a net gun to capture ostriches. Never chase ostriches into a fence to capture them. Are your matches dry yet? No, they are not I painted. In that case said tiny Enid replacing the cigarillo in her pocket. I suppose I'll have to visit the newsagents. And she sipped the last of her water, rose from her chair, kissed me lightly on the forehead and walked away. years later in a secondhand shop, I found a watercolor painting of wild hogs in a swamp down in pinks and greens and pale yellows. And I bought it because I wondered if it was the painting made on that golden afternoon when I sat with tiny Enid talking about ostrich capture for the very last time.

Ever mindful of the benefits for well rounded education and hooting yard we tried to think of exciting new ways of sharing listeners and readers to the hooting yard website with interesting information. I quite like the idea of creating a hooting yd encyclopedia and the only thing that's stopping me is my indecision about classification or ordering. alphabetical is obvious, familiar but a bit boring I think thematic taxonomies can be helpful but how on earth am I to decide upon my themes? My other difficulty is that I don't want to limit the contents to bear fact in themselves facts can be arresting, fantastic, quaint, unbelievable. Just plain stupid, all sorts of things. But you know anyone can bash together a shots miscellany or a bumper book of wacky lists or something like that, can't they? What we want it hooting yard is something strange and unprecedented, almost frightening in its intensity, something you'd want to browse in while marooned in a weird and disconcerting fog. I'll think of something further the the encyclopedia But meanwhile, here are a couple of facts to be going on with plant fanciers may know this, but I was delighted to discover that there is a hybrid variety of orchid called the Richard Nixon. I don't know the Latin name for it, and I haven't been able to find a picture of it anywhere but my research reads have only just begun. And still in the world of foliage, hooting yards roving reporter Velma Nebraska, tells me that there was a London topia wrist early in the last century called William cut bush When I write my essay on topiary one of these days, I think I've dedicated to his memory.

Some rare editions of the Bible. Number one, scholars, theologians, and indeed plain old book lovers have long been intrigued by various anomalous additions of the Holy Bible in this new series, hooting yards own expert on such matters Fatima Gilley, Blatt will be examining some of her favorites. And she begins with a rare Bible from 1982. Fatima couldn't be with us today, so I'm having to read her little piece myself. The so called Emperor Roscoe Bible of 1982 is astonishingly rare. In fact, some people who ought to know better have suggested that it's a figment of my own fancy. Such accusers are hotheads unfit to lick my theological booties, and should be discouraged from making any pronouncements upon these matters whatsoever, at least until such time, as they have been forced to memorize all 89 chapters of the Codex Gilley, Blatty honor, where he and I expound my learning with Verve and wit. I recommend it as suitable holiday reading if you have a suitcase big enough to contain it. But enough of self advertisement. The Emperor Roscoe Bible is so called because the four gospels in the New Testament are comprehensively rewritten by a quartet of clapped out radio one disc jockeys, including the eponymous Emperor Roscoe, Matthew, Ed, strew. Pot Stewart, Mark, Dave Lee Travis, otherwise known at least by himself and his immediate family as the Harry cornflake and Luke. And finally, did he David Hamilton, john. The remainder of the New Testament and all of the Old Testament follows the standard do I've version except for the book of Isaiah, which has been expunged for no apparent reason. My copy is bound in blood stained bandages abstracted from a locker in the basement of a mysterious clinic high in the Swiss Alps. Only eight copies of the Emperor Roscoe Bible wherever made and they were given away as prizes at a radio one roadshow held in the North Yorkshire seaside town of Whitby. The combination of the bloodstains and the resonance of Bram Stoker's Dracula that still hangs over Whitby I find strangely appealing.

I must make a confession. Here in the hemoglobin towers Browns Office of hooting yard, where the where we put the website together, in fact is put together by a team of volunteers from the bulges spinny. Home for the bewildered the wizard and the fraud. There has lain neglected in a damp corner, a bulging sack full of letters, all of which are please from readers who seek urgent advice on their jars. I can offer no satisfactory excuse for having ignored them for so long as much as I would like to throw blame upon our temporary janitor for de frocked PayPal nonsense nuncio x Monsignor Chetry head I cannot do so. With his hacking cough boils and seeming on willingness ever to wash his hair, he makes an easy target. But despite his numberless crimes, we make every effort to bolster his self esteem. Only last week, Mrs. gubbins gave him her soiled copy of one of David x books about extraterrestrial lizard people and the crowd In our active x plugin division have been saving him their boiled sweet wrappers for a month. But that's you probably don't want to hear any more of our office gossip here with apologies for his lateness is the jar advice that so many readers and listeners have been waiting for. It's vitally important to keep all your substances in separate labeled jars. Nothing good can come of mistaking your terps for your suid or vice versa. It can also help to arrange your jars in alphabetical order to wit, blubber, crusts, curd, juice, grease, aughts, pips, spume, ollege, vapor, and whey. This of course, is only an example as you may own an entirely different set of substances. I trust that will suffice and that everyone who needs advice on what to do with their jobs is now satisfied.

I'd like to end today's program. I think we're, we're approaching the end. And this is a set of four, four pieces which were written long, long, long ago, possibly about 20 years ago, if not more, and they go like this. Number one. Red hops on the horizon stank of steam. Yours boil my belt more hollow. He went towards the lighthouse with paint from the hotel's bond spoke of coast guards and vils butter and your belt felt sick. Bond stank of starch. Your had his wax.
