Good afternoon. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. Sound rather grizzled and blur, as because I'm feeling like that, but I will do my best to spend the next half an hour reading to you and I have much, much new material this week, possibly because I wasn't even here last week. Anyway, this is called the Swiss Family Robinson. Have you ever met someone from Switzerland named Robinson? Someone named Robinson from Switzerland who's been shipwrecked. I have. I was sitting in a coffee bar in old grimy town up north. And as I sipped my cocoa and leave through yesterday's copy of the old grimy town Gazette. In walked fat head Robinson and poopy Robinson and their children, Ned gristle and sawdust. They sat at my table. We are the Swiss Family, Robinson said Flathead. We are from Switzerland, and we were shipwrecked. I looked at them one by one trying to see evidence of their ordeal. When was this? I asked. Oh, years ago, said poopy. We were rescued by a big boat of birds. A boat of birds? I asked. Yes, said Ned Robinson. It was a big boat. And there were no humans aboard it. Only birds, starlings and chaffinches and buntings and wagtails and corncrakes and limits and sparrows and swans was a swan the captain? I asked. Yes, said Ned, how did you guess? I fixed him with my one working I sipped the dregs of my cocoa and stood up saying nothing. I swept out of the coffee bar and went straight home to write in my diary. Today, I met the Swiss Family, Robinson, I wrote, and then I put down my pencil and became lacrimosa thinking about swans imperiled on the high seas, and my parrot Lascelles who yearned for Colombia, where he was born on a bright summer day so many years ago.

Yesterday, not sorry, not yesterday, Monday, Monday. We celebrated two birthdays. Never, never let it be said that Houdini odd is out of touch with popular culture. It's just that we're discriminating in what we pay attention to. So on Monday, we celebrated the double birthday of not just one of the finest male voice icons in 20th century cinema but to Christopher Plummer was 77 on Monday, and decades have passed since his bizarre strangulated bird like squawk kings as one path in the Royal hunt of the sun. I've actually spent hours upon hours trawling the internet to find out if a plumber maniac has posted I don't know sound samples from that film, but to no avail. But Happy birthday was born on the same day. Two years before plumber was Dick Van Dyke, the man who invented Cockney, or possibly mockney, or whatever that accent was that he used to such powerful effect in Mary Poppins. chim chiminey chim chiminey chim chim chiru. Indeed, one little known fact about dick, possibly because it's entirely spurious is that he signed a multi billion dollar deal to allow his initials to be used by the manufacturers of DVD technology. At one point, the now ubiquitous ubiquitous discs, we're going to be called EV DS, because chariots of the gods offer and wag Erich von daniken was asking for less money for the use of his initials. The full story is told in chimney sweep versus Spaceman, a gripping true life thriller of the business world, available from all good airports and the other the third birthday Yesterday was the first birthday not yet 77 or 79. But the first birthday of the hooting yard website where you can read many of the things that I read out to you here.

This is called one morning on the line that runs from point to town to cop to life. It was a sweltering day. I was strolling along the line that runs from pointy town to cop slosh. When I chanced upon a Jesuit priest sitting on a bench, I tipped my hat and greeted him. Hello, I said, What a sweltering day it is. Felix Randall the farrier Oh, is he dead? Then said the priest. And I realized that I was talking to Gerard Manley Hopkins. Father Hopkins, I cried perhaps a tad over enthusiastically for he frowned at me and said, My duty all ended. Whoever watched this his mold of man, big boned and Hardy, handsome, pining. Would you like a bite of my medlar I interrupted, and as I did, so a dappled long drawn Falcon flew past narrowly missing my head. Pioneer pining continued Hopkins' without taking a blind bit of notice of my fruit sharing initiative, till time or when reason rambled in it 10 some fatal four disorders fleshed they're all contended, swallowing a chunk of metal. I wondered about these four disorders. Would they be impetigo au the bloody flux and botsman syndrome? I asked. Father Hopkins, who was now fretting with his rosary beads. Sickness broke him, he said. I was beginning to wonder why the priest was chuntering on about a dead farrier. But I decided to sit down on the bench. He didn't flinch. He kept talking but I was no longer listening. I had become transfixed by the sight of a flock of weird unholy birds circling above us. They were black and purple and huge, with savage talents and a wingspan of monstrous proportions. Could they be the legendary birds of bog I had read about in my little primer when I was an infant at Sunday school. Suddenly, Father Hopkins tapped me on the shoulder. How far from then for thought of he was shouting, all thy more boisterous years, when thou at the random grim forge powerful amidst peers. It's federal for the great great dry horse. He's bright and battering sandal. The last few words were yelled so loudly that my hat nearly fell off my head. But it seemed as if the priesthood finished jabbering last, I felt a sudden urge to kiss his hand as if he were a bishop, but I decided not to. Instead, I thrust my last medal at him. Take it. Take it farther, Hopkins, I said, and I got up and walked away. All in all, it was quite an interesting morning.

Old daughtery Martin trudged through the park. his hat was askew. Of course, he blanched when he saw the vinegar man who came all the way from the outskirts of Minsk. Why was a Minsk man here in the park, a man who was jabbering at a crow in a tree. doddery Martin masked his hair. He went to feed the parks polar bear. He fed it with biscuits and nuts. I said he fed it with biscuits and nuts. Back in viet-nam old doddery Martin had gutted hearts. He'd been a keen marine in his time. Now he forged banknotes in a basement by the Sen in Paris, in Paris in the capital of France, where his banknotes were passed from hand to hand, by evil men. Banknotes made by daughtery Martin home last from viet-nam

Two weeks ago I read the adventures of tiny Enid and here is a another adventure of tiny Enid This is called tiny Enid confronts the Russian bear. Excuse me, tiny Enid put down her book and side. She was reading I think one of the later novels of Daphne du Maurier, and it was beginning to irritate her. She decided to go and check on the gloxinia in her garden. Stepping out through the French windows, she saw that the great Russian bear was prowling around at the bottom of her garden. When it saw tiny Enid it let out a fierce bellow. Tiny Enid sat down in her ugly but highly polished stainless steel garden chair, the one she had rescued from a burning building all those years ago. She lit a tree root, inhale deeply and fixed to the Russian bear with a supercilious, sneering look. She wondered if this was the same Russian bear. Excuse me. She wondered if this was the same Russian bear that had mauled to death. Vitale, Nikolai enko, one of Russia's best known bear researchers, and a man who spent 25 years living with the enormous brown bears of the wild Kamchatka Peninsula. He had been found dead in an apparent bear mauling the body of Nikolai enko 66, who's lonely journeys allowed him to compile one of the most exhaustive documentaries on the giant nine foot cousins of the North American Grizzly was found at the lake near his remote one room hut on the tick higher River. The six and a half inch pawprint of a medium sized male bear was found next to his body, along with an empty can of pepper spray, with which Nikolai anko had apparently tried to defend himself. Just two months before American bear researcher Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend were killed by a bear in Alaska's Katmai National Park. The diminutive Nikolai anko, a self educated researcher and photographer walked more than 620 miles a year through the remote river valleys and coastal plains of Kamchatka, whose giant brown bears while increasing threat from foreign hunters and poachers. A senior Ranger on the Chrome watsky Wildlife Reserve, Nicola yanko battled illegal hunting and fishing in the reserve. His patrols kept him in the wilderness for months on end. He spent each day from dawn to dusk following bears, documenting their feeding, mating and social habits. By night, he would return to his hat, lighter kerosene lamp and fill what became hundreds of journals, a body of work that eventually became one of the most important biographical records of brown bear behavior in existence. He documented an average of 800 Bear contacts each year, according to Los Angeles Times reporter Kim Murphy. Did you move Vitaly Nikolai yanko to death, asked tiny Enid. The Russian bear was now lumbering across the lawn towards her. But when it heard her high pitched voice, redolent of a terrified Crow, it stopped and Thrax its mighty paws against its own head. It is not easy for a Russian bear to look shamefaced and coy but the one in tiny Enid garden did so. Now get along with you, she said stubbing out her cheroot under her jetblack Manolo Blahnik pump, go and do something useful, like grubbing for worms in the muck by yonder pond. The Russian bear turned and fled. Tiny Enid got up and cross the lawn to shut the garden gate. Then she went to the airport to catch her flight to Madagascar, or possibly to Plovdiv. I'm not quite sure when she went that day.

Stairway to Heaven. Researchers claimed to have found a picture of one of Dobsons out of print. in print, I'm going to start again. Stairway to Heaven. Researchers claimed to have found a picture of one of Dobson's out of print pamphlets. One of the researchers is tall and Hungarian. The other is a lantern jawed and recently suffered from gastroenteritis. They have only been working together for a short time and have never met face to face communicating via a virtually redundant communication system involving pneumatics magnets and steam. I have seen this picture and I have to say it looks more like a book than a pamphlet, in which case it may be the unimaginably rare Stairway to Heaven. One of Dobson's most puzzling works. Stay away Stairway to Heaven was written in the first flush of Dobson's youth. The manuscript scribbled in a clutch of exercise books, the pamphleteer to be stole from an enormous locomotive stuck in a railway siding. The guards had apparently gone off to paddle in a pond and hunt wild boar while they waited for spare parts. The book is subtitled some conjectures on the possible location of an actual staircase that leads to the celestial sphere. And as a remarkably assured text for one so young, it begins with us. As I wander through the wilderness of this world, I often fall to wondering how I will get to heaven. I know it is there somewhere. For that is what my mama and papa have told me ever since I was taught. I know too, that every single thing I have ever told me is true, because they vowed It was so they made these vows to me on my sixth birthday, as per part cut my cake, and shortly after my mark clambered in through the window, after chasing away a robber with her high velocity sniper rifle. She came through the window of the kitchen because at that time the daughter the cottage was sealed shot against themes and demons known to prey upon good folk in the country said countryside where I grew. Popeye used quick drying cement for the job completing the work in just an hour on the one day that winter, when there was no rain nor snow, for we lived in a valley. If there is ever a second edition of this book, I will check a meteorological reference work to check the accuracy of that statement. There never was a second edition of course, a fact that sometimes finds me lying awake all night sobbing into my blankets, big blankets from Finland, where it is important to keep warm and snug through the long long winter night.

Ain't loopy cops when I was young, all golden weather shrubs and trees. All golden I remember them. And bonkers Maisie from the farm. Maisie was unkempt and mad, just like her brother and her dad. Her sister left them long ago, she went to join a music hall. She made it as a chorus girl, and then she graced the silence screen. She looked like Edna purviance and had a hat named after her. But bonkers Maisie never did, for she was always dressed in rags. The Golden trees of loopy cops in those blue summers long ago. I remember them with Whoa, as I sit here twirling my moustache. My wife is such that I may sob and mop my tears with my jacket cough. But both my cuffs are smeared with grease. I did them in the soup tureen I don't know why. I don't know when I don't know who knocks at my door. This bond hotel has stale air. The other guests are rakes and Fox. I'm sitting in my rocking chair. Recalling the gold of loopy cops. That's one of two pieces I've written In the last last week or so, which have this and I Why have this kind of looking back looking back to some kind of idealized rural past bucolic bliss, and the other one is called three blue days of imbecilic, glee. And this is it. The first blue day of imbecilic Glee, was a Tuesday towards the end of March. In truth, the day was not blue, for there was frightful storminess, a blizzard of hailstones, and much Tempest and rack. Nevertheless, when looking back, I remember other things. I remember how we laughed even though our picnic plans were dashed. I remember how we pretended the cow in the field was amigas. But witchiness I remember how we ran back to the house and spent the afternoon playing a game of Ayn Rand. Every time you shouted a sentence from the fountainhead, and I countered with one from atlas shrugged. The uproar was such that Mr. loog Oldham next door, took off his big black boots and hammered on the wall. I remember the embers at the end of that first blue day. The second blue day of imbecilic Glee, was that day we took our bicycles on the train to the fishing village at the end of the world, and painted watercolors of the post office and bought stamps and drank tiser and we will followed around the village by a one eyed dog with terrible fangs and you wanted to take it home. And all afternoon the shrill singing of the orphanage choir filled our ears, and I found a tiny toy plastic pig in a thicket of stinging nettles and we cycled all the way home along that dangerous road as huge container lorries thundered past us in both directions. The third blue day of imbecilic Lee is today.

Yesterday was get back to birthdays and things like that yesterday was not only the hooting yard websites first birthday. I suppose I should remind you the address it's hooting.yard.users.bt open world.com not only the website's first birthday the 14th of December yesterday, but also the feast day of St. JOHN of the cross, author of the classic work the dark night of the soul. I do recommend a thorough reading of the dark night of the soul if only to remind oneself that this is the original and is not to be confused with Park no lips, Korean underworld pulp potboiler the dark night of soul, which is in itself a classic but in a different way. Alas, in his dotage Dobson did get the books mixed up, which is why his pamphlet a full and Frank commentary on the dark night of the soul. We're in certain controversial theories of proposed which have led the author into fistfights with sailors outside tough drinking taverns in the Marseille dock yards out of print. It's such a scrappy piece of work. reading it, one can only rue the day that Dobson accepted medical advice from a charlatan and began to take regular infusions of a so called patterned embrocation for the cranium, which made his last day such a trial. Allah wishes nesting bird commented, if I ever get my hands on that quack, I will strangle him with string and fling his lifeless corpse off the end of one of the jetties to which I have the right of access after a series of lengthy court cases, which you don't want to hear about Believe you me. Next thing but said this to me spitting vitriol, while we rummaged around in a battered old bureau somewhere deep in the Dobson archives, trying to find evidence that the pamphleteer had ever actually visited the notorious French port that he wants spent an afternoon in lahav accompanied by a chuckling maniac we will new but must say. Could it be that the title of Dobson's late pamphlet was a piece of fabric tastic embroidery, if so his entire career would take on a new complexion and an unwelcome one. Before nesting bird and myself were able to complete our search of the Bureau. A hot and unexpected, lamentable thing happened, and we had to abandon the building. As we blended our way towards the perimeter fence, a messenger ran towards us, bearing news of a new Yoko Ono installation, there was only one thing to do. bafflingly, the Bureau has since disappeared, and without any chance of completing the magazine article was Dobson in marsay, a discursive analysis for which nesting burden I had been promised a few pounds, or if not that much, at least enough for a potato age, but penury, it seems, is destined to dog my footsteps.

And finally, this week, this is a story called Constance bereft. The pigs needed feeding. So Constance took a big crate full of apples and crashed out in the morning drizzle. The apples were pippins and mostly rotten, but she knew that the pigs would gobble them down. over by the aircraft hangar, a floppy eared bunny rabbit was hopping about among a pile of abandoned pots and pans. constantly worried about rust, but not today. She took the apples into the pigsty. Put the empty crate onto a pile of other empty crates and headed off towards the orchard as dawn was breaking. Constance had an acid donation in the orchard. The following day before her resignation, Constance not only fed the pigs with a crate full of overripe plums, but she gathered up all the pots and pans strewn around the door of the aircraft hangar and D rusted them with a D rusting solution of her own devising. The floppy bunny rabbit was nowhere to be seen, but she saw an Arctic hair on the horizon. Then she trotted off excitedly to the orchard. On the Thursday, she was late to get into the orchard for acid nation because one of the pigs had contracted a lethal pig disease, and she ran across the muddy fields to call the local veterinary surgeon and mutton chop gold for with watery eyes. He was still a bed and constantly knocked and knocked on his door to rouse him. When he eventually came down in his dressing down, gown, not quite awake and unlatched his door the following dialogue took place constants that vet I have a sick pig, veterinary surgeon. Let me get dressed and put all the necessaries in my bag and I will come with you. Constance, hurry hurry that the pig may die. veterinary surgeon, I will do my utmost to save your pig. Because Constance had run across the fields to call a veterinary surgeon, she was late for her acid donation in the orchard. When she got there at last she found a note fastened to a withered old pug tin tree. She read only half of it before hot tears welled up and she fled from the orchard sobbing and bereft. Back at the pigsty, the watery eyed veterinary surgeon was packing up his bag constantly blundered through the gate fraught and weeping and wild died. veterinary surgeon, I have cured the pig, Miss Constance, all will be well. The End constants bereft the motion picture is currently in production starring shirt as constants and Kevin Costner as the veterinary surgeon. And that's the end of the show for this week. Bye
