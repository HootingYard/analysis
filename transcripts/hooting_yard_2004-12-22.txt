Before this week's edition of hooting yard on the air, we'd like to broadcast and appeal. The quandary that beset Dennis apart from his conviction that in a previous life he was Veronica Lake was whether he was hinged or unhinged, or possibly neither. Most of us would not fret about such a thing. But Dennis did. There is a temptation to say that this fact in itself proves that Dennis was indeed unhinged, and to ponder why this had not occurred to him, but it had an added to his fretfulness. For there was so much about dentists that was hinged. For example, when he chanced upon poisonous toads, he scampered out of their way, rather than picking them up and taking them home with him as an unhinged person might. Dennis was adept at self preservation in a very hinged way. When he plunged out of an aircraft at high altitude without a parachute, he made sure that he lives upon an air current that allowed him to drift easily onto a bank of fresh fallen snow, thus, cushioning his landing and meaning that he only spent six weeks in hospital instead of being caffeined. Up and buried in that Baltimore churchyard where lie the remains of Edgar Allan Poe. Dennis had given much thought to the idea that he might be neither hinged nor unhinged, not in the sense that he fell somewhere in between. But the hinge Enos, or its opposite was foreign to him as an igloo to a Mari or a buyer Oh to a caveman. Dennis remembered in addition to being Veronica Lake, being a caveman. The Gulf of 1000s of years between these lives was a blank, however, and Dennis wondered if he had spent all that time in some kind of limbo. If he had, where was that Limbo, and had he been hinged or unhinged? or neither? While trapped in it? This seemed to Dennis so monumental a question that he could find no rest. Dennis needs your help. In particular, he needs your shoes, all of them. If Dennis's story has tugged at your heartstrings, please, please pass them up all your footwear and send the package to Dennis. care of the Veronica Lake building. Winnipeg. Thank you.

It's Christmas time soon anyway. I saw three ships. That's one of those Carol's isn't that I saw three ships. I saw three ships come sailing in. But what did I care about ships. I wasn't hanging around in the dock yards because I wanted to look at ships. I am an entomologist. And I was here to trap boll weevils. I watched them scuttling out of sacks of flour being unloaded from one of the three ships, so I pounced on them with my nylon boll weevil net and ferried them back to my lab. I cackled as I assembled my equipment, how they glistened my pincers and knives and scalpels, and clamps and suction tubes and petri dishes. pulling on my lab coat, the white starched cotton splattered here and there with the blood of insects, I scampered like an excited puppy over to the dansette and put on my favorite Ronnie milsap lp. I like to listen to country music as I disect boll weevils. I was just sharpening one of my scalpels when the door of the lab burst open. cursing that I had forgotten to lock it. I span around to find myself confronted by a trio of heavily armed thugs. They were to a man huge, very frightening and togged out in futuristic Robocop like uniforms. their helmets had been burnished to gleam that I could only envy. Drop the scalpel, pig dog shouted one of them loud enough to be heard over Ronnie milsap. I froze but managed to let the blade fall from my hand. It cluttered on the linoleum. I do not approve of carpets or rugs in an insect laboratory. A second thugs snatched up from my workbench the canvas bag in which I put the boll weevils. He lifted the visor from his helmet and looked at me with snarling contempt. When he spoke, I was disconcerted by the fluting gentility of his tone. Never ever trap boll weevils as they scaffold out of our flower sacks on the dark side. When three ships come sailing in, he said, crushed and piteous, I began to mumble something, but he waved a gauntlet and handed me and interrupted. If we ever catch you abducting our boll weevils again, we will do something unimaginably horrible to you, he said. so be warned. And with that, the three thugs swept out of the lab slamming the door behind them. I took a napkin from my pocket and mocked my brow. I was shaking, Ronnie milsap was singing. It was on the very same day that David Blunkett resigned as the Home Secretary.

Good afternoon. This is a belated introduction to booting out on the air on resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frankie, and I'm reading to you. And I'm going to read you now. Ah, oh, this is very, very good. children's story, particularly good for Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve, or sometime when the children are over excited. The only problem is is a dialogue for two voices. And I haven't got someone to read the other dialogue. So I'm going to try and do two voices just bear with me. This is the legend of the grumpy man. Now children, settle down your sleepy heads. And remember, you must be good. Because you know what happens to naughty children, don't you? What happens ma? Why the grunty man comes to get them of course. He comes bounding down from the dark terrible hills to snatch bad boys and girls away. But how does the grumpy man get in ma? He makes his grunting noise three times and all the doors and all the windows of the house just pop open like that. autopsy look like nobody who the grantee man snatches away ever ever comes back so nobody can say what he looks like children. Where does he take them ma he snatches them from their beds and tucks them under his arms and he bounds away with them up into the dark, terrible hills. And then he makes them work in his big furnace in a grim black cave, where he makes his grunting noise at them all day and all night. And it's so loud and horrible that birds fall out of the sky if they hear it. Are you fast asleep now little ones? Not yet ma tell us more about the grumpy man. The grumpy man is 10,000 years old, and even huge bears and bison and squid and creepy crawlies and weasels. And fierce wild animals are frightened of him. Does he snatch away bad animals to MMA? Yes, he does. And he keeps them in cages and sets them on the bad children when they don't work hard enough in his terrible belching furnace in the cave. Ooh, what is that eating the cave The grumpy man makes special cakes and buns to feed the naughty children, poisonous cakes and buns. With flies hovering over them and no icing. No icing at all. I think like fairy cakes. They are children, but poisonous fairy cakes and they taste horrible. We would be sick. You would be very sick, but you would never ever die because the grumpy man would keep you working at the furnace. clang clang clang. Imagine the giant advils and red hot bellows. That is what lies in store for you if you are bad children who do not fall asleep right now tucked up under your soft Ida downs. We understand ma for we are the spawn of the grumpy man and he has sent us to menace and haunt you for your every waking moment for as long as you shall live.

That was not the grantee man you just heard that was a crow. This is a story which needs to be read very slowly. For some reason. I'm not sure why I will try to read this slowly. It's called petrochemical Shiver me timbers conclave. Rookie pirates aboard containerships need to watch their backs. As a seaside doctor, I cannot count the number of cases I've had of youngsters fresh from their first sea voyage coming to me with Cutlass wounds or worse lead pellets from a blunderbuss embedded in their crania dangerously close to the brain. One such lad was Rufus Farjeon, who ran away to see when he was just seven. He ran from his parents, Gingerbread Cottage, all the way to the beach, panting, panting and he swam out to a container ship mod on the horizon, and clambered aboard, and in his tiny squeak of a voice, he said to the captain Rufus Farjeon age nine, reporting for duty captain. Captain CAC was not taken in by the boys lying about his age. But he placed an avuncular hand on the far Julian's shoulder and quizzed him on his knowledge of obscure marine in ponder abilities. The captain's right hand was the avuncular one his left hand was withered. Over the next few weeks, young Farjeon scrubbed the decks sloshed out nautical buckets, polished the railings to a gleam and learned all there was to know about bells at sea. He also sat at Captain cacs breakfast table, reading aloud to the old sea dog from Yoko Ono's book, grapefruit while the captain ate plentiful toast, hard tack biscuits and by coincidence, howls of grapefruit. Then, one Thursday, some weeks into the voyage. The blonde and brilliant team boson took the boy aside as he tried A clattering barrel through a narrow passageway between containers. A word of warning, muttered the boson in tones of menace. At eight bells the captain is holding a petrochemical Shiver me timbers conclave in his cabin. There may be trouble. Watch your back. But Rufus Farjeon, who's who had celebrated his eighth birthday a week ago, was by now puffed up, preening and reckless. And he ignored the bosoms words, reeking of grog and blinded by the pitiless tropical sun. He behaved at the Conclave in a foolhardy manner, so angering a blood thirsty Coursera that he was taken to the poop deck and shot in the head. And thus, he turned up at my seaside surgery. A few days later. I bandaged his wounds, and prescribed a course of Dr. Wayne right brain pills.

I well knew that just one pill was enough to stand an ostrich and I had the lead on 20 of them a day for his metabolism was inhuman. I needed to find out if he was a changeling he was. And now he sits like a little potentate on a throne on the jetty. facing out to see his bandages discarded and his eyes are glow. And mermaids come to go pat him and minnows swimming ribbons at his feet for he is Triton now and will always be throned festooned with seaweed and staring out to sea.

Um I mentioned Christmas earlier and I don't know if you're if you if you if you celebrate Christmas and if you do celebrate Christmas whether you have a special Christmas dinner and if you do, here is a recipe for a Christmas dinner taken from Dobson's pamphlet, things to eat in the bleak mid winter. And this is sorry, this is one of Dobson recipes. Boiled cormorant Allah Dobson. This is a splendid and satisfying dish, easy to prepare, highly nutritious, and the enemy of indigestion. First, ensure that your kitchen is free of verminous creeping things with hundreds of legs, suckers and and tenei. route them out and exterminate them. Gather the tiny little corpses, place them in a paper bag, seal the bag with glue, carry it out of the house and set fire to it. Do not go back indoors until every last speck has been consumed by the terrible flames. Now, back in the kitchen, take off your wind Cheetah and your big black boots and wash your hands with carbolic soap. Cover your hairstyle if you have one with a clean rag fixed in place by an elastic band. You are now ready to begin. Take one freshly slaughtered cormorant and place it on your work surface. vegetarians can substitute the bird with a pretend cormorant modeled in mozzie pan. I will not remind you of this point again. pluck all the feathers off and put them in a grinder. Grind them to find powder and using a funnel, pour the powder into a spare crew it if there is a ring around the cormorants neck, as there will be if it has been exploited by fisherfolk. Carefully remove the ring and throw it away. Unless it is old and decorative, in which case, you may wish to pop it in an envelope and send it to Antiques Roadshow veteran Hugh Scully, but do that later on Boxing Day. Step to boil a cormorant. While the bird is simmering away, prepare the source. Chop up into tiny bits for pomegranates, a plum, lots and lots of potatoes 16 bananas, another cormorant, some toffee apples and a choc ice. Place the tiny bits in a bowl and stir thoroughly. Then get the funnel again and pour the contents of the bowl into the grinder. Adjust the setting to moderately violent grinding and switch it on for no more than 10 seconds. Transfer back into the bowl and add water up to the brim and stir. Do not on any account to use tap water. You will ruin the recipe and end up with a bowl of inedible sludge unless you use the fantastically pure spring water drawn from the mysterious old well at pointy town. drain any remaining water from the pan with the boiled cormorant in it and take the contents of the bowl in making sure you do so in one swift steady movement. Ideally, it should sound like this glue glue

Now, put the bowl down somewhere bring the pan back to the boil and allow to simmer while you fry the cocktail sausages. They should be almost but not quite black. You are nearly done. Take a large oval platter and make a bed of shredded lettuce chives, spring onions, porridge oats, cream crackers and mayonnaise. have another look around the kitchen to make sure no creepy crawlies have appeared for many unhatched eggs you may have overlooked earlier. Turn off the heat and transfer the boiled cormorant and source onto the platter. Use a clean dish cloth to wipe around the edges in case any of the sources dribbling over the side. Take a Swiss Army knife out of your pocket, extract the sharpest blade and just in case the last time you used it was to dislodge a pebble from the soul of your boot. plunge it into boiling water to sterilize it. Excuse me, very carefully slice the blade across the cormorant as deep as you can and put the knife down. Insert the cocktail sausages into the bird then sew up the slit with edible butchers string. Try to remember where you left the spare crew it and sprinkle a powdered cormorant feathers evenly over the dish. Add salt and pepper to taste serve

Well, I think your kitchen should be a place of Wasserman Glee on Christmas morning if you make boiled cormorant Li Dobson the cardboard club. The cardboard club was an odd little society which met in the vicinity of bulges Spinney during the last century, some say that it still does so. Although the evidence for this is slight. Throughout its existence, it was difficult to pin it down to a test with any certainty who its members were and what they did. So those who claim that it continuance into the new millennium may indeed be correct. I have just noticed a hornet's nest in my rafters. We do know that the members of the cardboard club were fond of regalia, several crates and Trunks packed with badges, emblems, tassels, embroidery, pennants, flags and such like were discovered during excavation works on the blister lane bypass a couple of years ago, catalogued with care by that prematurely white haired mutant palyed man at the museum, that collection provides some clues as to the activities of the cardboard club. For example, it seems reasonably clear that the chief purpose of the club was to collect samples of cardboard, collect note not disperse. What is not yet understood is why this was blanketed in secrecy. After all, cardboard is no longer illegal in my country, nor are there any punitive taxes levied upon the possession of it. The mystery deepens when we consider that no cardboard whatsoever was found with the crates of regalia. One can only assume that the club's cardboard collection was squirreled away the most intriguing item to be found. Among all this stuff was a toward plasticine model of beaky from the 60s beat group, Dave Dee, dozy beaky, Mick and tich. a safety pin attached to his plasticine spinal column suggests that it was worn as a signal of honor, perhaps by the plenipotentiary Grand Vizier of the cardboard club. Alternatively, it may have found it Excuse me. Alternatively, it may have found its way into the crate by accident and have nothing to do with the club at all. This line of inquiry is well worth pursuing, but not now. Because the frantic buzzing of those Hornets is driving me crackers and I'm going to have to climb up on the roof and pick them off one by one with my deadly anti Hornet pellet rifle. I just want to correct something about the cardboard club. I appear to have misunderstood the heading which means that what I've just read to you is complete nonsense. The club the club have the title it's not a society or Association, it's a bludgeon. The cardboard club refers to a weapon made of cardboard which was used as a theatrical prop during the budget spinny variety theaters production of vans scrim drawers, Pinterest drama, a few people sitting around in the dark, hating each other. And that's all from hooting out this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. Have a have a splendid 25th of December and think of Dobson
