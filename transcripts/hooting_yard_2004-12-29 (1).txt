When I stood at the edge of the lake when I stood on the bridge when I looked at the water when I saw the broken fountain when I broke my neck when I lay awake all night, when I couldn't see a thing when my mind began to snap when I was spoon fed cocoa, when what I said went to skew when they proffered me jam when my tongue was hanging out, when I loitered in olm when the diving board cracked beneath me when I fell into a pond when I was all washed up when I ate too much chocolate when nothing broke my spirit. When I hosted a TV chat show when I went to a wedding when I broke down in tears when I was in despair when Bracken snagged my socks when illness cast a shadow when death appeared lascivious when sadness crushed my feelings. When I was struck by lightning, when all I did was worry when I threw in the towel when I was scorched in deserts when no one gave me biscuits when all I had was breathing when my gas bill sent me bonkers when you told me that I'd had it. All I wanted was an the next word, I'm afraid is illegible. Hello, my name is Frankie. This is hooting yard on the air, which means it's resonance 104 point four FM. And it's Wednesday afternoon. And now I'm going to introduce a piece which appears on the radio sort of website thing. It's a hooting yard website thing it's called online learning with hooting yard, so you will need to visit the website which is HTTP, colon, forward slash forward slash hooting.yard.users.bt. Open world.com. If you go there, you will find this online learning with hooting yard. Here is the first tranche of a new series in which we will attempt to provide a thorough and valuable learning experience for all our readers and listeners. Perhaps you failed to pay attention when you were at your community hub. Note, you may recall it being called a school that was thin. Online Learning with hooting yard can help you catch up with all the vital information that passed you by each lesson specially devised by a team headed by Fatima Geller Blatt consists of two questions to which model answers are given. They have been carefully researched and a guaranteed 100% correct. And I'm not kidding. No longer need to be stuck for an answer when accosted in the street or buttonholed at a fashionable cocktail party in a rotating restaurant at the top of a high building. Memorize the answers or if your memory is a sorry and puny thing. Write them down on the calf of your shirt or blouse on the same side as you wear your wristwatch. You will soon be sparkling in company and everyone will be envious of your cleverness. So here then is lesson one. Question one. I'm going to cough Hold on. Question one. Are crocodiles frightened of otters? Answer? Yes they are. If crocodiles roam into a stretch of river where otters are prevalent, they will hasten the way for crocodiles fear otters. Question two. How did a priest in Bolivia early in the last century supplement his income? Answer he divided his graveyard into three sections Heaven, purgatory, and hell, and charged for burials accordingly. And there endeth the first lesson.

Unknown Speaker  04:56
Well, we've just had Christmas, haven't we and perhaps you've Had some unwanted presence things that people gave you nice thoughtful gifts that you just didn't want. That's where our agony Uncle, uncle Dan comes in. Ask uncle Dan. And here is here is one of the letters he's received. dear uncle Dan, I have been given a burlap sack full of old crocus's, and I have no idea what to do with it. Please help your sincerely Valentine smooth. Uncle Dan says well Valentine, whenever I read the word crocus's, I think of icky Barna, the Japanese art of flower arranging, also called Cardo, or the way of the flowers. So get yourself a VAZ and transfer the crocus's from the sack, throw the sack away. Now be deft manipulate to the crocus's with delicacy taste and vision. There is of course the possibility that you lack these qualities, in which case you may be better occupied, throwing the crocus's away and retaining the burlap sack. With a pair of scissors and a sewing machine, you will soon be able to turn it into a mightily uncomfortable vest, which can be wrapped up and given as a Christmas or birthday gift to a devout Roman Catholic. Jesuit priests in particular are known to be fond of such garb. If you do not number any Jesuits, among your acquaintances, I would recommend visiting a website called the S j web, an excellent resource connecting Jesuits and friends around the world. And the Lord be with you Valentine's new.

Unknown Speaker  07:32
Well, that was about Christmas. But what about Boxing Day? Throughout his life Dobson always ignored Christmas but he loved to celebrate Boxing Day. Every year he made a point of marking the occasion differently. Here is his journal entry for one year during the 1950s. So this is how Dobson spent Boxing Day at least one year. on Boxing Day at last, what a glorious day it is. This year there is snow on the ground. Robin redbreast is hopping about and Dickensian scenes of what sail and cruising over by the old thatched tavern. That being the case I have nailed fast for shutters and I'm sitting in the gloom. I wired up a microphone next to the indoor wasps nest so hectic buzzing drowns out the intolerable sound of Carol singing and such like torments I breakfasted upon a platter of boiled leeks and steamed Viper heads. I will spend much of the day in the kitchen, boiling more leaks and steaming more Viper heads for my supper. I have a new telephone installed last week, and I intend to take a break from boiling and steaming to call the police. I'm going to read out my new pamphlet to the desk Sergeant or whoever answers the telephone, for it concerns police matters, specifically the legal position regarding the theft of leaks from the greengrocers and of vipers from the zoo. In the pamphlet, which I wrote in Pig Latin, just to show off and make a full confession to having used thievery to obtain my Boxing Day foodstuffs, and justify doing so with reference to certain historical and or mythological figures, including Hildegard von Bingen. So Herbert Beerbohm tree and the warrior king and AXA grow tax. I also make mention of the prince electors of the Holy Roman Empire as a way of throwing the coppers off the scent, should they determined to prosecute me at 60 pages, it may Take some time to read the complete text to the police officer. So I will attach an extension cord to the telephone and drag it into the bathroom and make my call while nestling in a tub of hot milk of magnesia. Over the past year, I have bought a couple of those little blue glass bottles every week, and should have enough to fill the bath. I will heat the milk of magnesia using professor to darkies submerged ion filament contraption, the label on which claims it can boil a few gallons of any known liquid within 30 seconds. Of course, I do not need to boil my bath Far from it. Too dark he does not provide a thermometer, but I have one somewhere in a cupboard and as soon as I have completed this journal entry, I shall go in search of it. After the telephone call the bath and my supper, I will put the thermometer back in the cupboard and set a roaring fire in the great as I have no coal nor would I will burn the beheaded Vipers for there are many of them and I suspect they will ignite well. I've dried them thoroughly by putting them in the airing cupboard under a pile of blankets. The blankets incidentally were not stolen. I wove them myself when I was a child and capable of weaving the loom for hours upon end humming old Latvian folk tunes to myself. In those long ago days, I could never remember the words to the songs except for one and that only partially in papayas translation. It went something like this. There is a shepherd in the hills. There is a something green, but black is the crow in the something tree and fork lightning blasts the sky. The shepherds last has golden hair.

Unknown Speaker  12:06
She something something milk, but the crow has flown away my love and the ducks have left the lake. It's time I made that telephone call. Um, most of what I read on the show is by me or by Dobson but I'd like to read something by someone called Norman Davis. A while ago I found a marvelous publication in a secondhand bookshop on Charing Cross Road. It's a 76 page, a six booklet spineless with a yellow card cover. And it's entitled further science book 20. written and published by Norman Davis in 2001. infuriatingly there is no other information, no address, contact details or anything. The contents include topics such as hedge orders, dragonflies, World monkeys, near death, world flag psychology, and national bill hooks. If anyone knows anything more about Norman Davis, or how I could obtain further science books, one to 19 I'd be very pleased to hear from you. Anyway, here is an extract. Here's one of the items from further science book 20. And it's called ancestral birds. And I'm going to read it exactly as it appears in the book. One that Australian birds represent ancestral European species to, and insight into their psychological differences would reveal how species psychologies evolve and new science psychological evolution.

Having your blood sucked by a vampire bat can be an alarming experience, and not at all like being Bled by leeches. In the latter case, you're likely to be attended by a kindly apothecary or physician, who will apply the leeches and make reassuring noises. Alternatively, you may be trudging through a swamp and leeches will fasten upon your legs and begin to drain your blood. But in such cases, you are unlikely to notice them as you will be half submerged in the swamp. Therefore, in your ignorance of the lectures, you will not be frightened. a vampire bat is likely to attack you without warning however, and so you will be alarmed. Many folk make the mistake of lumping in pipistrelle Egyptian fruit red long nose that little brown, pallid Western Mass diff Sarah teen pocketed free tailed woolly falls vampire Horry, Indiana northern ghost faced greater horseshoe Brandt, Honduran white natters Lapid Brown, nocturnal, Ipanema tent making big brown evening yellow spotted that fuzziness, pipistrelle and other bats with vampire bats and thus being fearful of the mall. But only the vampire bat will plunge its fangs into the soft white flesh of your neck and begin to drain you of your vital Gore. If you are awake, and especially if you are active, for example, playing Lawn Tennis, orienteering, or doing outdoor carpentry, you will be able to fight off the vampire bat. Remember, you are bigger and stronger vanities and be not afraid. On the other hand, if you're fast asleep and unprotected by an anti bat curtain of heavy purple brocade, the vampire bat may suck your blood uninterrupted until its thirst is sighted. If you are the bat first victim for a while, it may drink all of your blood and you will not wake up because you will be lifeless. Do not believe those foolish stories about waking after a visit from a vampire bat and tentatively feeling punctures in your neck and thence forth. A kind of undead human version with a blood lust of your own. That will only happen if you live in Transylvania and bear a resemblance to Bela Lugosi or long trainee notes that long cheney is not to be confused with Lynne Cheney, wife of the current US vice president.

Unknown Speaker  20:54
From birds, from birds to bats, and back to birds or specifically ducks. Imagine that you're standing beside a duck pond. Perhaps you're holding a plastic bag filled with the torn up remains of a loaf of bread with which you intend to feed the ducks.

Unknown Speaker  21:12
You have been known to do such a thing on a Sunday morning perhaps come rain or shine. Now, what I want you to consider is as follows. Do you think that there are any circumstances whether on a Sunday morning or any other time when you might look at the famished expectant ducks paddling towards you and single out one particular duck and say to yourself, hmm, that duck looks lagu breus. Canada duck take on a lagu breus air This is no idle question for whether the answer is yea or nay further and more cogent questions present themselves tumbling over each other in their urgency to be answered. If so, how? Or if not, why not? A clearly the next questions in line. But it doesn't stop there. To arrive at honest answers to all the succeeding questions. We'll take all your wit and insight and knowledge not only of ducks and other waterfowl, but of biology and psychology, and the engines of perception and optics and so on ad infinitum. You see, as each question begets another by the time you finished answering them not that you will ever really finish answering them more than your faint from exhaustion, you will know everything there is to know about everything in the universe. That being so the lagu breus doc has earned its crust of bread 1000 fold, so feed it now before you swoon.

Unknown Speaker  23:22
I don't really want to harp on about ducks, but I'm going to because, according to Alexander Dumas in his grand Dictionary of cuisine, he writes as follows. The young Wild Duck shot at the end of August it's called an all brand. All Brands which are to an ordinary duck as a partridge is to a hen are broiled on the spit and served on toast soaked in their own juices, to which are added the juice of bitter oranges, a little soy sauce, and some grains of fine pepper. That's the end of the dumar quote, but the thing that worries me about that is what is exact what exactly is contained in those packets of all brands sold by the Kellogg people. I mean, is it dead wild ducks knows. And here's another quotation. This is a completely different quotation, but this is a quotation from blood for the vampire dead. Still on that theme, by Robert Leslie Belem, about whom I know nothing, but this is what Robert Leslie bellum wrote. He heard only the sound of the wind for hissing pelt of raindrops in the scrub oak. Second fear assailed him then Fear not for himself, but for the girl he loved. He remembered the dark sinister threats offered by liji Gladwell, and he recalled how lightyear his daughter had died. Maybe Brenda was even now hanging suspended head downward somewhere. Her Life blood being drained from her veins, either by vengeful Klansmen or by something worse, such as an undead vampire corpse. until tonight, he would have scoffed at such an eldritch hellish fancy, but in view of what had already happened, a cold slime of horror slid into his marrow.

Unknown Speaker  25:47
Okay, no more about birds, no more about bats and no more about vampires. This is called at home with Tang quad shatavari and before I read it, I'm going to have a sip of tea so hold on.

Unknown Speaker  26:07
I went to the shops and bought some custard. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap. I went to the shops and bought some custard and approach and a flap and the pin of Pang. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of Pang and a copy of hoodoo brass. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of Pang and a copy of hoodoo brass and a jam tart. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of pain and a copy of hoody brass and a jam tart and four and 20 blackbirds. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of pain and a copy of hoodoo brass and a jam tart and foreign 20 blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of pain and a copy of hoodoo brass and a jam tart and foreign 20 blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. And then I went home and took each item out of its paper bag and put the paper bags on the fire

Unknown Speaker  28:06
and smoke billowed up the chimney. And I saw that it was good. And I declared that it was good. in a loud voice so loud that my neighbors came running. They tumbled into my room in their stocking feet. And I stood there like a jack o' lantern with my custard and brooch and flap, and the pin of pan and a copy of hoody brass, and my jam tart and four and 20 blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. And I said to my neighbors, Behold what I have bought at the shops, ye neighborly folk, behold and wonder. And they did. And I made a pot of tea and handed around cups, and I filled their cups from the pot and my shopping, I distributed to my neighbors as gifts, and their hearts grew warm. And that is what happened when I had what is called an at home in my simple cottage on the outskirts of the farm where cows graze and hens cluck and the farmer has gone to seed. And that's all from hooting yard for 2004 but we will be back next year in a week's time. See you then. Bye
