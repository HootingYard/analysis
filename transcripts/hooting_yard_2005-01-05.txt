Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to read to you for half an hour later in the program, it would be very helpful for listeners to

Unknown Speaker  01:03
be able to look at a reproduction of Rembrandt's painting, Belshazzar feast, which you may or may not know. So if you've got a book with a with a picture of that in it, go and dig that off the bookshelf, you might be able to find a copy online. Or if you're in London and listening on a transistor radio I suppose you could always go down to the National Gallery. But before that, this is a quotation from after London by Richard Jefferies. four kinds of wild pigs are found the most numerous or at least the most often seen, as it lies about our enclosures is the common Thorn hog. It is the largest of the wild pigs, long bodied and flat sided in color match the hue of the mud in which it wallows. Now coincidentally, that was the quotation from Richard Jefferies. Coincidentally, I was given a common Thorn hog as a Christmas present. It's a wild pig, long bodied and flat sided, in color much the hue of the mud in which follows that mud being my front garden mud, which is somewhat darker than my back garden mud. The mud along the side of the house is another shade again, but come forth, that's the pig's name seems to prefer the front garden, or at least the mud in the front garden. I did not name her can fourth, the benefactor who brought her to me at crack of dawn on Christmas morning, told me that she had been named before birth, like most Thorn hogs. The common practice I was informed is for these wild pigs to be called after iconic railway stations, and can't fourth is of course, where Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard filmed brief encounter. In addition to telling me my new pig's name, my benefactor gave me a little booklet in titled, so you've been given a wild pig, which is packed with useful information on how to care for it, or should I say her? Not that come forth need much

Unknown Speaker  03:28
care.

Unknown Speaker  03:28
She spends most of her time wallowing in the mud in my front garden, and twice a day. I unlock the gate to let her out so that she can go rampaging about the hills, grunting furiously and waylaying anything edible? She is after all, a wild pig. Ashley is fond of thorns. I took calm forth to the garden center when it opened for its Boxing Day Sale. And we had a lovely time looking at the rose bushes. I think I can tell from her prolonged and noisy grunts that she would like to go back there when they have restocked. I have not yet allowed my thorn hog into the house, as I'm in the middle of redecorating. Sometimes in the middle of the night, I can hear her thumping violently against the door trying to get in. But I want to finish her indoor sty first. Transforming the entire downstairs is going to be quite a job, but it will be such a nice surprise for her. The price of straw is high at the moment, so I may have to wait for the market to settle down. Meanwhile, I'm keeping an eagle eye on both hay and straw futures and counting up all the loose change in my jars. I would write a thank you letter to my benefactor for such a delightful gift. But he didn't leave a forwarding address. Indeed after delivering the wild Pig he scampered away at high speed shouting, Merry Christmas as if in the throes of a hysterical fit. And you know something. I've never set eyes on him before.

Unknown Speaker  05:39
In a cabin on a ship steaming into Harbor, were two glum men know, the ship was steaming away from the harbor or port, a port whose name ended in Damn. Do not try to guess which port I refer to, for your brain will become designed by the effort. And if you were an animation, little tweeting birds would circle around your head. Such would be your befuddlement. I know whereof I speak. So trust me. This ship now, the HMS important and grandiose flying many flags, had gravitas. If we can ascribe gravitas to a ship, and as it steamed out of the port of dam, it had many many flags flying. Some of the flags were blue, a surreal alien blue like the best skies on the most gorgeous summer days. If you stare at the bright sky on such a day for long enough, you will see that the air is teeming with spirits, as multitudinous as flakes in a snowstorm. According to a French person called Leo so waviness and look, many of the flags flying from the ship. Those that are blue and those of other shades have pictures of angels on them. You may scan the flags as carefully as you wish, but you will not find a skull and crossbones hidden among them. For this is not a pirate ship is or was. I fear I have veered from the past tense to the present without explanation. Unless I'm careful, which will hurtle into the future, and what is intended to be a sober piece of reportage will become science fiction, and you will toss it aside with a harrumph of displeasure. For if I know you well, dear reader, you would rather have me tell you that which is prosaic and mundane than be titillated with intergalactic space rockets captained by alien beings called thorgan zapping X ray beams that inexplicable foes, whose very geometry is on earthly why once when I had time to spare, and the ship was still in port, I tried to count all those magnificent flags, and found that I could never arrive at an exact number. Perhaps there were sailors aboard hoisting and lowering them so rapidly that I did not see. I did not have a pair of binoculars in those days. Indeed, I still don't for what use would they be to a cyclops like me who's left I was damaged in the Munich air disaster. I shall tell you about that another time. For now, I want you to picture that ship with its serried blue flags and its innumerable angels steaming out of dam and two glum men in a cabin below decks. The door is closed. The cabin has two portholes, and they are a frosted glass for no particular reason. One of the gloomy men is sitting on an upper bunk, dangling his spindly legs over the side. When he used to laugh years ago, he sounded like a bronco horse. And indeed, he suffered terribly from bronchitis. And often on his daily rounds. He walked past a field in which a tremendous number of horses were put out to fallow, if that's the correct word. I don't think it is, but I'll let it stand. I mean, that kind of mood. But that was long ago. Now glum and emaciated. He sits on the bunk in a cabin of the ship of many flags and clears his throat. He is about to introduce himself to the other miserable man in the cabin, who has just come in slamming the door behind him. This second man is wearing a top his pulsating cranium Dippy hat. For the last few hours, he has been thinking thinking so damn hard about ducks. For that's the sort of man he is. He wants to complete a catalogue of duck markings duck behavior and duck habitats, but has been unable to work on it for a while, as he has sprained his wrist and cannot write. This accounts for his glumness and also for his sling. The spraying occurred when he was trying to unscrew the jamb lid from a jar of

Unknown Speaker  10:27
hoody Maruti

Unknown Speaker  10:28
paste. We might ask at this point the cause of the other man's bloom, the man on the bunk who used to laugh like a horse Long, long ago. Sadly, his interior life is a thing of mystery to me at any rate, from bulkhead to poop hatch, instructions are being shouted back and forth by the ship's crew. The Mighty Sun is gleaming bronze flags are flying and the sky is alive with orcs and turns and guillemots below decks in the gloomy cabin. The two men reluctantly greet each other. This was the historic moment when Blodgett met Dobson. Speaking of Dobson, as I so often do, one of the more lamentable episodes in his career was the year he wasted trying to write a Tolkien ish fantasy novel. What on earth got into him? It was the year full Geneseo. Batiste fled Cuba, that Alaska and Hawaii joined the United States that Archbishop Makarios returned to Cyprus from exile, the year of a royal wedding in Belgium, and of the so called kitchen debate between Nikita Khrushchev and Richard Milhouse Nixon. It was the year which saw the debut of Rod Serling TV show The Twilight Zone, but also in February, the day the music died. JOHN McEnroe, yen's, Stoltenberg, Max desharnais and Magic Johnson were born during that 12 month while Frank Lloyd Wright, Mario Lanza, and blind Willie McTell all perished. And all the while Dobson was holed up in a hot in some Antarctic wasteland, writing something to which he gave the working title phantasmal quest thing. It's anybody's guess why he tried to write fantasy fiction. He simply had no feel for the genre. The reader will find here no elves, hobbits or wizards,

Unknown Speaker  13:22
just

Unknown Speaker  13:22
fleas and flies. Dobson seemed to think he could build 1000 page epic around a flea called Dave. The other characters if such they can be called have equally prosaic names. So instead of say Aragorn, Lego last and Gandalf we get Keith Collins, Sue and

Unknown Speaker  13:45
Jeff.

Unknown Speaker  13:46
In place of adventures, we get these barely anthropomorphized insects, accompanied by a few mages, ticks and blue bottles, flying and leaping around the place engaged in conversations, which report on action sequences further never themselves described. It's a soulless and tedious work phantasmal quest thing. And it's best to draw a veil over Dobson's habit during that year of dressing in cardigans and tweeds. Hanging around in taverns, drinking warm beer, and spouting politically reactionary drivel as a way of ingratiating himself with the fantasies he modeled himself upon. Let's just be thankful that marigold two snapped him out of it. On the 12th of October 1959. She bundled him onto a boat, locked him in the cabin, and through a coded system of knuckle wraps on the door, threatened him with a big fierce sword wielding pneumatic robot dervish. It was a turning point in his career. This is a very old piece written many many years ago and I'm just in the mood to read it today. It's called docking hack. may have read it on the show before but never mind. hats are off in docking caps are being doffed. The Council's got a town plan for maths or on a chart. pips have been spat out and drudgery is by bide. Chocolate puddings seem to be in everybody's pantry. And here comes traitor bill. He caught a shark in waters. His Southwest has been askew since 1954 ish. Bubbles surge from froth the chemists shop is shot. There's pills and pills and pills that no docking man could swallow. Suffering aborted the council in a caucus. The shaven heads of heads of state of battering The Doors Down the city gates, the turrets, the alleys roads and Muse docking has it is all go for Red Alert decisions. language has been no node the bamboo men are wailing, the breakage rate is sheduled for system has been broken. crayons pink and stacked. The Burnt Sienna packaged vandals clash at nightfall but docking has its crackers. Plastic wrapped in plastic the docking coffers emptied. Idiot brawl saloon bar, a gorgeous snag tooth babble prepared to dancer who cha not a tear or boohoo 1000s of museums stacked with golden maps misshapen trunk road closures, big stone reconstructions dockings cottoned on it's a town about a tower The frame is out of kilter the coffins filling coffins are but I want to go back to that docking docking hack. Perhaps that was a docking docking hack. Although it might have been that crow again. If you have your reproduction Rembrandt's Belshazzar feast to hand or even if you haven't, I'm going to read you a brief story called Belshazzar as feast. Will you come with me to Bell shadows feast? asked agneta I didn't know you've been invited, I'll have to ask Bjorn said Benny. Benny strode off into the mountains to find Bjorn agneta stayed at the hotel sipping her alcohol free absinthe. Wild winds were howling and storm clouds gathered.

Unknown Speaker  18:27
Benny found Bjorn sheltering in a declivity he was burning charcoal. agneta wants me to go with her to Belle Chasse as feast, said Benny, after tipping his hat to Bjorn in greeting. What do you think? The gods may throw a dice said beyond their minds as cold as ice. He stared off into the mist and shrouded distance towards the fireworks factory and the abandoned table tennis courts. I feel reflect on what you have said and come to a decision then said Benny, thank you. On the way back to the hotel, Benny was accosted on the mountain path by Frida. She was dressed like a Gaucho and looked as if she had been weeping. frieder whatever is the matter? asked Benny. Frida dabbed at her tears with a paper napkin from the hotel. her upper lip curled in a sneer, discomforted by her silence, Benny began to gamble agneta asked me to accompany her to Bell shows as feast he said and I asked Bjorn for his advice. He is up there in a declivity burning charcoal men a men a tech l you fasten, said Frieda and she promised away into the midst Now here's a question worth asking, did they once exist ions ago on a distant icy planet, a race of beings not unlike emperor penguins and appearance, if not size, for let us say that these beings were minuscule that 100 of them gathered together would be no bigger than a gnat. And that these beings were unfathomably stupid that their behavior patterns were inane and pointless, but they somehow managed to construct an intergalactic spacecraft built from Pac eyes, and used it to ferry themselves to other planets and other galaxies for no purpose other than what we might call sight seeing, and that over millions of years, visited hundreds of 1000s of planets without ever once alighting on Earth. For the pale blue.of our planet to use Carl Sagan his phrase was visually horrifying to these beings, whose eight eyes could not tolerate the color blue in any of its tints and shades, or green for that matter, given that their own planet bathed in a totally alien color spectrum, unimaginable to the human brain, unimaginable even to someone like self styled brain guru and Mind Map Maker Tony Buzan, and that one of these beings wearing a sort of rocket booster backpack jetted out of the spacecraft when it was near Earth. And this tiny emperor penguin like being collided with an asteroid and was pulled into Earth's magnetic field if that is possible, and that it came in to land on the towpath of the canal just outside my door last Wednesday, when I was on my way to buy a rake and a home for my allotment.

Unknown Speaker  22:24
Having counted

Unknown Speaker  22:24
my potatoes as I liked to do every morning, wearing a plastic Viking helmet with only one horn, the other horn having broken off when I was clambering down the hillside without pausing for breath. On that day I was pursued by an ill tempered giant badger Who said I had accidentally demolished answer me that and I'll give you six months. The piece about Dobson's meeting with Blodgett earlier mentioned an old freshman called Leo's waviness, who said that if you stared into a bright sky long enough, on a bright day, you would see angels and spirits teeming as multitudinous as slight snowflakes. And I read that in that in the greatest book in the English language, which I'm rereading at the moment, which is, of course, the anatomy of melancholy by Robert Burton, first published in 1621. And I'd like to read you a brief paragraph, which gives some indication of just why it's such a great book. So this is by Robert Burton, from almost 400 years ago. Cornelius gamma relates a young maid called Catherine gold her a Cooper's daughter, and oh 1571 that had such strange passions and convulsions. Three men could not sometimes hold her. She purged a live eel which he saw a foot and a half long, and touched it himself. But the eel afterwards vanished. She vomited some 24 pounds of fulsome stuff of all colors twice a day for 14 days. And after that, she voided Great Balls of hair, pieces of wood pigeons done parchment, goose dung, coals, and after them two pounds of pure blood, and then again colds and stones, on which some have inscriptions bigger than a walnut, some of them pieces of glass, brass, etc. Besides paroxysms of rules Laughing weeping and ecstasies et cetera. Et hop in quit calm Harare vidhi this I saw with horror.

Unknown Speaker  25:30
This is a detective story or something approaching it. No evildoer was safe when Special Agent rosters blocked was on the case. Never in the annals of crime and its detection has there been a more successful operative? Not for blot the ratty alternative methods of Sherlock Holmes or Prince zaleski nor the pathologically violent approach of spare lanes, Mike hammer, whether the dread deed was a polite country house murder, or a low life robbery, blot had a singular advantage over his rivals. Let us watch him at work and then children, I will quiz you to see if you can spot the wellspring of his genius. The crime a bloated janitor is found done to death in the locked boiler room of the Pang Hill spangle factory. His recent behavior had been irksome. The clues anomalous items discovered in the vicinity include an old wishbone ash LP minus its sleeve, a defaced railway timetable showing signs of having been ignored by a hamster or evolve the bones of an ospreay pick clean. A photographic still of Gary Cooper's Howard Roark in the film of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead and a reduced price jar of sump oil. witness statements indicated that during the previous night, a series of Banshee like cattle wallings could be heard coming from a yonder in the direction of the place of flapping and rumpus up in the sinister hills. For suspects nobody. Agent block was called in after the police drew a blank, greasy hair plastered flat on his head, his eyes milky with some hideous optical disease, and short of breath, blood demanded a slap up dinner consisting almost entirely of recovered meat products. He bought copies of all the local newspapers investigated a slab of masonry, took photographs of bees, wasps and Hornets and devoted three days to cutting a slot into a cardboard tube using a pair of scissors and a nail file. Dust gathered on his epaulettes and he made no attempt to brush it off. He went angling in brackish streams, accompanied by a slovenly farmer's wife and her slovenly dog. Easter was approaching, blocked had a number of prolonged fits. But whether they were genuine or feigned was open to question not least by the sheriff, a giant bear of a man whose beard was used as a floor mop. on the Saturday 18 townsfolk were arrested, charged with the murder of the bloated janitor and hanged from jibbitz in mid your square where their corpses were picked out by crows. And now, three questions. One, do you think Special Agent blot has panache to two would you like to be employed a special agent blots assistant? And number three, what precautions would you take before hungrily devouring recovered meat products?

Unknown Speaker  29:35
I'm going to end very briefly in a minute with a story called The Cabinet of Dr. Kelly CAG CAG and I'm going to read it quickly so I read it in the time available. It was a stormy and hideous night a ferocious girl uprooted Sycamores, hollyhocks, and strange unearthly shrubs which grow only in Finland. thunderclaps definite the major Damo of the orphanage lightning bolts blinded the crappier stuff funeral director. Then came the rain. A torrential downpour unleashed by storm clouds blacker than the blackest thing the human mind can comprehend. The temperature plummeted, rain turned to hail assailing with 10,000 merciless pinpricks, the pathetic figure of a man trudging through the streets of Helsinki dressed only in shirtsleeves in boxer shorts. The man was the notorious forger quack and Charlotte and innego hoist moments before he'd been denuded of the rest of his clothing and ejected from the hobble of his concubine, who were taken exception to the odor on his breath of salad custard and hibiscus. hoist managed to reach his doctor's surgery without being crushed by a felled Sycamore, he hammered on the door wailing desperately, long last Dr. Keller CAG CAG drew back the 14 bolts on his door and let hoist in. The good doctor was wearing a rhinoceros mask of beaten bronze. He cackled and shove this nibbling hoist into his sinister cabinet. Then he began to adjust the dials on the control panel. And that's the end of this week's show.
