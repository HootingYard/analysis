Good afternoon. This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frankie. And well well well, it's that time of Wednesday afternoon when we go to hooting yard, and I read to you for half an hour. So settled back. Close your eyes perhaps. And I'll read to you. There I was crumpled and decisive standing between two trees on the edge of the blister lane bypass. The trees were both of us, I think I was looking for curlews the first one I saw was made of plastic. It was a toy or perhaps a decorative figurine. It had been abandoned in the gutter. Then I saw a second Curlew sweeping across the blue blue sky. I did not know it then, but within hours there would be no blue to be seen. For dark and brooding thunder clouds would waft in from the east. A third Curlew appeared in my mind's eye. It was gigantic and ferocious and terrifying. I shuddered. I walked away from the yew trees in the direction of bulges spinny, pulling my resplendent teal cardigan tight about my torso. There was a fourth Curlew, an embroidered one on my neck tie. Why in the name of heaven was I wearing a necktie. All of a sudden, this length of fabric wrapped around my neck felt like a hangman's noose. I took it off with violent jerks and discarded it in a puddle, where it would remain until discovered later that day by a scavenging hobble the boy from the bashings. That gloomy cluster of huts which same people shirk. As the tide dropped into the puddle, I saw a fugitive reflection in the water of the embroidered Curlew. So that made five it was still only 10 in the morning. by five past 10 I had seen another dozen curl use, or it may have been a single curl you've seen 12 times. I cannot be altogether certain. I was standing on sawdust bridge at the time, feeling hopeless and disgruntled and cantankerous. The tunic I was wearing beneath my cardigan, which I had stolen from an ingrate, was playing havoc with my invented skin disease, and rashes were appearing. My doctor had prescribed a daily dose of some sort of been mashed up into a bowl of milk of magnesia and I had forgotten to take my dose that morning. so keen was I to see curve use. Later I took a mop and began to clean the floor of one of the corridors in an ugly building which shall remain nameless. I was indoors now so unlikely to see any curlews but lo little Maisie a polka dot dressed orphan whose parents perished in the Tet Offensive came rushing up to me clutching her stamp album and showed me her latest acquisitions, a set of 20 bird related thematics issued by the tan Tara beam interim authority. I could not help but note as I shared my Brazil nuts with starving Maisie that eight of the stamps depicted curlews on my way home as the evening closed in and dark thoughts of skullduggery frolicked in my throbbing skull, I saw a dead curly on the canal towpath bird detectives had already thrown a cordon around it. So I was unable to take a closer look. That night, by candlelight. I took out my ledger and gave names to each of the 26 curlews I had seen our societies BIM kampot dromedary I don't long flaps gash Helio gobblers in thawed. That is how I started my list. Then I recalled that I had set out to see 44 curlews i gnashed my teeth in misery and dejection, and I recalled that I had forgotten to wring out the mop

This next item you will either find are naturally boring or absolutely fascinating. There will be no half measures. I sense this because it's one of those topics which either is either met with unutterable boredom or absolute fascination. There are those who make fun of my continuing fascination with the Kennedy assassination. Good afternoon pansy, cradle Jew. As if that little pang of excitement I get when I read the words, grassy knoll, or umbrella man, or FBI agent Holstein. If you know as if that little pang of excitement I get when I hear those words means I'm some kind of bug guide conspiracy theorist of questionable personal habits. And I admit I am fascinated by the mountain of theories and documentation and poring over min UTI that conspiracy theorists do. I just don't subscribe to any of the theories myself. Anyway, for those and they are legion who like this sort of thing. Here is a Kennedy Assassination fact, which I recently discovered. In November 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald's wife, Marina and their two children, were staying in the house of Ruth Payne, a Quaker, in the suburb of Irving. Oswald himself stayed in a Dallas rooming house during the week and join them at weekends. He kept his mannlicher carcano rifle in Ruth Payne's garage, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, the interesting fact is as follows Ruth's husband, Michael Payne, who had moved out of the house for reasons unrelated to the Oswald was the great great grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and also a direct descendant of one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence, Robert treat pain. I am really glad that I know that smidgen of information useless as it is, and now you know it too.

This is called when I was interrogated. I don't remember much about my interrogation. But under the new Freedom of Information Act, I managed to get hold of a cassette tape for the best part of half an hour. It's a mishmash of hisses, squeaks muffled moment, and what sounds like a water vole knowing on a wet twig. One part of my interrogation has survived, however, and I have taken the trouble to transcribe it for you, so that you may study with care. I'm going to read the transcript now. Question. When was the last time you stood in the middle of a suspension bridge in a high wind? emptying your lungs and belting out the Uruguayan national anthem? The top of your voice? Answer last Thursday. Question. Where you accompanied on Piccolo by Vons through album z and encore on gray by tack answer. I was. question Are you aware that tack is wanted by the police of four continents for doing weird things with the pips of citrus fruits? Answer, I am not. Question or von straubing z is not driven strathalbyn Z's real name. Answer. I was not aware of that. Question. Do not be Curt. Answer. I am not being Curt. Question. We shall be the judges of your curtness. What is that noise in your pocket? Answer. That is my water vole, knowing a wet twig it eked from the riverbank just before I was placed under arrest. Question. Did constable Fang tell you you could bring a water vaulter the top secret interrogation center? Answer. He didn't say one way or the other question. That will be all we will call you back after several use cases have been issued. So anyway, I kept a close eye on the papers for the next few days waiting for the use cases to be issued. But they never were. nor was I ever dragged back to the top secret interrogation center. Tak vanished without trace. But a month or so later, I ran into Vaughn through album z outside the palace of churns. I asked him if it was true that his real name was not Vaughn straubing z. Van, he said van. He was of a delicate constitution, so I didn't press him further. Many years later, his sister told me that it was very important to him that his surname and his blood group were in alignment. As she put it. He was a great Piccolo player, and so was his sister. But my singing voice is not what it was. And I no longer sing. I just stand on the windswept suspension bridge and remember, with a lump in my throat, and another water bowl in my pocket, knowing on another wet twig.

This is an old favorite, an extract from the private memoirs and confessions of an ignorant ornithologist. Tuesday saw something sitting in a tree. It had a head, two legs and seemed to be covered in feathers. I only saw the back of the head so could not tell if it had a beak. I suspect it may have been a limit. Wednesday, trained my powerful binoculars on a speck up in the sky in the far distance. It was moving quite fast. Perhaps it was a Wren Thursday, saw a worm being dragged from the soil by something much bigger than it possibly with wings. rang Dennis to tell him about it. He said he'd come and check, but by the time he arrived, puffed out 10 minutes later, the thing was gone, and there was no sign of the worm. Dennis said it was probably a castle worry. Friday overheard a couple of people in the park talking about sedge warblers later, I discovered these are a life form which all authorities agree is a type of bird ticked off a box in my notepad. Saturday went to the church fair when I said how nice all the flags and bunting looked. Dennis said. That's also the name of a bird flags and bunting? I asked. No, you nitwit. He said just bunting. Also known as the auto land. I was very very impressed with the breadth of his knowledge. Sunday I woke up to find an owl sitting on my head.

This might be a slightly disturbing piece. It's it's eldritch and spooky baps? And it's called Earth spruce. Now rusty and squalid. Consider that for one day, you are Spry preening and spruce. Then knocked sideways cast down become rusty and squalid. How does it happen? Is there a moment a split second, when john tennis turns to sackcloth and ashes? What would your journal read? 11am Oh, such bliss and splendor? How blesses Am I to be among the animate and quick 1101 aim? Does Earth harbor wretches miserable as I one who crumbles in despair and is fit only to slither in the muck with the worms. How are we to make sense of such a catastrophic change? crystal balls may help Sears and soothsayers see into the future. But is it true as Some say that we can make sense of the present only by staring long and intently with our eyes wide open at the surface of a muddy pond overbite, bulges? spinny and not any of the ponds. They're just one of the most brackish of the ponds, the one which is inky black and fathomless. What will we see on the surface of that pond if we stare at it long enough? I will tell you ignore the flies, the mosquitoes and the mutant tadpoles that occasionally disturb the water. And sooner or later, you will be able to discern dimly at first but with increasing clarity. The incredible face of the psycho palmed dweller, shimmering, gaunt, bewitched, and bewitching and its expression will reveal to you the meaning of neither past nor future, but of the present moment, radical, decisive, and like the cockles and mussels in the old song. Alive alive. Oh,

Recently, two or three weeks ago I think I read a story called petrochemical Shiver me timbers conclave. The point about the story was that it included to the phrase I can't remember the word surrounding it but that included the phrase, the blood thirsty course air. And I received a letter of complaint This is for this was tomorrow. So the hooting yard website just to remind people that http colon double forward slash hooting.yd.users.bt, open world.com. And there's a serial complainant who often writes in called Dr. Ruth pastry and I hadn't actually heard from her for a long long time anyway. She was she was spurred into action by the story petrochemical Shiver me timbers conclave, or by that phrase in it, and I'll read you her letter, which I received Dear Mr. Key I was disturbed to note in your item headed petrochemical Shiver me timbers conclave 20th of December 2004 that you unthinkingly proceeded the word Coursera with bloodthirsty This is not only a cliche, but also panders to the stereotype of core says as violent maniacs who careen around the decks of sailing ships off the Barbary Coast, with gleaming cutlasses clenched between their equally gleaming teeth. I have met many courses in my time, and not one of them bears any resemblance to this nonsensical image. Indeed, the coarser with whom I was best acquainted, in that he was my fiance for a few months in the early 1970s was a gentle soul named Federico della Pickler, de Grunewald, who spoke with a pronounced Lisp, and his usual form of locomotion when he wasn't prancing was to mince. I do not think he had ever been near a Cutlass in his life. much of his time, whenever he was absent from his buccaneering privateer ship was spent raising rhododendrons and dalias holding raffles in aid of the local orphanage, and gambling or green fields with puppies and Flopsy tailed bunny rabbits. So next time you write about courses, please be more accurate. Yours fuming, Ruth pastry doctor.

This is an extract from little stories of charming people to warm the cockles of your heart. Very, very nice book, and it's called Meldrum Fonseca Uber trombonist. It's during the nose flute. Meldrum Fonseca first took up the trombone at the age of 70. Before this, his entire musical experience was limited to singing in the bath, or possibly singing in Bath. It's not quite clear. Having spent the best part of his life as a Plymouth magnate Meldrum was a rich man from Aleppo to zog, few cities or towns exist without at least one plinth from the Fonseca plinth factory, or one of its many franchised workshops dotted haphazardly around the globe. The conversation on that autumn day under an overcast sky went something like this. Mel drums paramour, Mrs. Fonseca asked him why he had never learned to play the trombone. This was a common verbal Sally of hers, keeping Meldrum alert by firing questions at him which he had never been asked before. On the same day, for example, she asked him if he knew the story. His thing about the skeletal structure of badges, and whether he could recommend a particular recording of a 19th century railway timetable being read aloud from cover to cover. Due to misses from seconds constant mental prodding, Meldrum, his brain was a superb mechanism thoroughly exercised almost like a champion Greyhound. Although often his answers to these constant questions might simply be yes or no, his response to the trombone inquiry was, well step my tribes Marjorie Susanna, that's a bloody good idea. I'm going to go out this very minute and buy myself a trombone. And he did. He engaged a tutor on the same day and unnerving milk SOP called Reynolds. Reynolds taught him daily for the next year, at which point Meldrum had become so adept that the tutor threw his hands in the air and said in his weedy little voice, Mr. Fonseca, I can teach you no more. Your skills have outstripped my own. And from that day on, Meldrum spent most of his time standing next to a hedge by the ring road, playing his trombone, and gladdening the hearts of all who passed him by

my name is Cedric sprang and I have inspected all the lighthouses of Hoon, this is my report. On the 14th of July, having had my crutches freshly varnished, I set out for the port of tongs, my knapsack packed with mustard cakes, celery stalks, a flask of slops my notebook and pencil several pins a length of string a wristwatch with a frayed scrap, and many many other things which would present I cannot divulge. I have to wait for three hours at the railway station, during which time I shunned the other human beings in the waiting room, preferring to crouch in an alcove to drop down some preparatory notes for my tour of lighthouse inspection. There are 26 lighthouses in Hoon, and rigorous planning would be necessary. I have decided to begin with the port of tongs Lighthouse for three reasons. One, it is the lighthouse furthest from my home in hooting yard, being precisely 46 and a half motes distant. That figure has been verified as have all the montages in my report by Dobson's bitten robot measuring device, each time I note the distance from one site to another. You may imagine this splendid metal birds soaring across the sky at unimaginable speed, its beak spewing forth ticker tape. To it is the oldest of the Hoon lighthouses by a good half century. Three there is a toad hospital on the outskirts of the port, and Lillian my Toad is sick. She has been struck by repeated fits of the trumpets, and I will be able to collect supplies of serum paste and Toad pills. The train journey was remarkably eventful. The guards van was struck by lightning, a pig wandered onto the track and missed death by second, a passenger Florida face and decked out in clerical garb, a Jesuit perhaps broke his ankle while attempting to step over a suitcase abandoned in the corridor. We suffered a temporary derailment. The toilets were flooded. Seven or eight handkerchiefs donated by passengers were needed to stem the ticket collectors nosebleed. A small child frantic with mysteries pulled the communication cord, causing a halt of some hours. Bacteria released from a mysterious package made all those in the rear carriage violently sick. A monomaniac with grubby fingernails walked up and down the length of the train declaiming his theories on colorless gases. There were other incidents To be sure, but eventually the train arrived at the port of tongs. And that is the end of my preamble. And that is also the end of this week's hooting yard. So have a good week and I'll see you next week. Bye.
