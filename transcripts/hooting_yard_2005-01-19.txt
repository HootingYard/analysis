Afternoon is 4pm in London This is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. As ever I shall be reading you instructive and, and entertaining pieces of prose. The first one is about pattern tree. I'm not averse to pageantry. So when a parade came past my door last Friday, I went to my window to watch. Although the pane of glass in my window is besmirched with grease, I had a splendid view. I saw a yellow brown three green Pan technicans, a brown cabriolet, at least half a dozen Crimson Sherif banks, a pair of white fight ons, and a blue chariot, each with its flags and bunting and streamers and ribbons, some with Hooters and klaxons making a terrible din. And they were followed by countless wagons and floats and cars, gigs, coaches, brakes Drush keys jalopies and land owls, drapes, bogeys and coupons, tres Palin kins and flavors, so many that before I knew it, hours had passed, and it was dusk, and there still seemed to be no end to the parade. I was beginning to wonder how I be able to cross the street. I wanted to go to the tobacconists to pick up a twist of nap under plug of slot. But the succession of characters, decorative snow plows unicycles and trackers showed no sign of abating. The crowd that had gathered to cheer and throw hats in the air and dance impromptu polkas was thicker than it had been all day. One mountebank had set up his stall close to my front gate, and was attracting custom with whoops and whistles. I decided to risk crossing the road thinking stupidly, that I could weave my way through the parade. So I put on my hat and stepped out of the door and was at once caught up in a surging mob of revelers, and borne aloft like some sort of mascot. They ignored my tremulous whimpers of protest, but eventually they dumped me on the curb about a mile down the road from my house. And here, the pattern tree and crowds were if anything more boisterous, colorful and noisy than ever. What is always in aid of I shouted at a black clad widow woman who was selling bundles of strange Herbes from a Barrow. She was reluctant to answer me until I'd forked out a handful of cash for a sprig of irk Bane. A potentate from a far distant land is visiting our town she told me and the council wanted to make him welcome. He is a terrible tyrant, and he has been known to kill a horse just by uttering its name. his palace is bigger than the tallest mountain and is built from the bones of enemies he has slain in combat. But they say that in his bailiwick, ship sheep may safely graze. The old crone continue to speak but she was drowned out by a band of Pipers on the back of a passing flatbed truck. I stuffed cotton wool into my ears, and Archon pressed a pennant into my hand, and I found myself waving it unthinkingly night had fallen now, but the town was bright with flares and gas and calcium nightlights. I stood at the roadside, hemmed in by cruising crowds and watched the passing parade. Somewhere, bells were clanging a mile away in the dark dark woods. owls swooped on field mice, badges, grubs for worms, and insects glowed a mile further on that potentates assassin tied a bandana around his head, litter cigarillo shouldered his rifle and began his heavy delibird trudge across the marshes towards the town.

Now, plant your brow in the muck on the floor of the ditch and cast your mind back to that golden happy childhood. When you clashed in the paddling pool on a Sunday glazed summer's day, the water was cool and delightful. The water in your paddling pool. Did you rush home wrapped in your big yellow towel and worship? norm? Did you thank norm for the coolness of the water? Dried and cooled? Did you clap your library ticket in your tiny hand and scamper excitedly to the public lending library to borrow a book of fairy stories. You would have looked for something with pictures of elves and wizards and parries and hobgoblins and found a compendium perhaps carried it on tippy toe to the issuing desk by in the glorious sunshine streaming through those enormous library windows. Had it stamped and born your borrowed book away out onto the path in the bright afternoon. When you got home, safe in your bedroom strewn with pillows and cushions and patchwork quilts and throws, did you cry out in gratitude to sesh at moot? Not Horace, Seth are nubus these are the gods all powerful and eternal. I can picture you a few summers later, older but no wiser. traipsing around in the park lunchtime. You have a bag of breadcrumbs and you intend to cast them upon the grass as food for sparrows and magpies and starlings for limits and ravens for bufflehead ducks and grebes. Sitting on the rusty bench with its rusty plaque in memory of one long dead who sat here often and adored the view the view of rooftops and chimneys and football fields and allotments of tennis courts and orchards rich in cherry trees. I see you casting your crumbs to the birds, and I know that you are not giving thanks to our 10 or to gab or to sec met or to tar. No. Still at this time. Despite your riches and your bravura. Your poor head is filled with visions of its Pappa Lacan coactivator que tenemos Kalki cloudlock Maya Wal k quartetto. Quick talky whack popocatepetl and the like. For these are your gods in the grip of your delusions. It is perhaps not coincidental that you like to sport a yellow Polo neck sweater like the one worn by Christopher Lee in The Wicker Man and even have your hair cut in a similar mop, though you are not yet going gray and you insist that you have not seen the film for you professor devotion to the silence screen in your Pantheon excuse me in your Pantheon.

The dens from which Sherlock Holmes emerged, twitching and shattered in the man with the twisted lip. Those fogging, shrouded days are as distant now as the bright summers of your paddling pool youth. Yet you cling to your false gods, as you feed the birds and ducks in the park, shaded from nuts glittering sky by the overhanging branches of Sycamore and Hazel trees on the bench by the magnificent iron railings, which were replaced after the war in which you were wounded thrice. You were shot in the stomach burned by flaming barrels and crushed by falling masonry. But now there is not a scratch on you. And you have forgotten that terrible day in shaven ingan.

There is much dust in your home for the air is never still there. drafts curly and under the doors and around the window frames for much of the world is rotting away under sustained attack by weevils and woodworm microscopic forms of life. You have ignored for too long, baleful, greasy, plump, a little cracked, you've shuffled from room to room pointlessly, as if you have been kenneled all your money is gone exhausted by your postwar debauchery is you have a blighted reputation and constant pins and needles. That is what accounts for your restlessness. This shuffling from bedroom to pantry to parlor to outhouse, from attic to cellar, and back again, up and down and round and round. And always with your liver spotted fist clamped around a little tin medallion of Montezuma, as if that might fend off the night for darkness, the vastness of eternity. You have a kitten but it hates you. You have not yet been subjugated by Bastet, but that time is drawing nigh. So you call your kitten, Karen Carpenter, and feed it with fish that you pluck from ponds, or with eels. You see from the back kitchens of canteens, and your kitten hisses at you and claws you unload the sight of you. You are fearful of the light in those green eyes, for you rightly sense that they see into your soul, your small and puny soul or curdled by a life of waste and the delusion that can pay off good would bring you corn that chante ko would warm your heart that the wind cried ahead cattle. The gods are in readiness for you. And the wind is cold. Yes, it is night now and you are in your ditch. The wind is cold and the sky is black. And there are no birds, not even crows.

You have sunk to your knees that blurred black and white image of Lillian Gish stricken by panic in the wind is fading fast. like Sherlock Holmes, you too are twitching and shattered. But no opiates brought you to this. Mart. Our 10 sec met half Thor, Horace. There is no longer any traffic, no car horns, no rattling carts, no clanking steamer plying across the Strait. Despite your wealth, you never did fly in an airplane across oceans and continents. You never did go and live in that house on stilts that you pictured in your mind's eye when you were young. Parks and ponds were your domain parks and ponds. And now this ditch a trickle of foul brackish water running through it. You kept some in your hands and splash it on your burning brow. But it is not the cool water from the paddling pool given to you by noon all those years ago. amort ISIS Bastet note

There came back Day last Thursday when your nerves were so brittle and the pins and needles became too much and you flung your Montezuma medallion across the pantry and cursed your gods. And the kitten crept up to you and fixed its green eyes on you. You retrieved your tin Google and fled to the park to watch the grebes but you were shaken. You have not been still since then. You were like the gust of air swirling around your house. The house you lived in then I mean, moot. Oh, Cyrus, amoun, Neff face. neath.

Some weeks ago, I read a story called one afternoon on the line that runs from pointy town to caulk lush, which was about an encounter with Gerard Manley Hopkins. This is a continuation of the story. Sorry, that piece was called one morning on the line. This is called one afternoon on the line that runs from Kok loss to pointy town. It was a sweltering day and I had spent a profitable hour or two rummaging in the market square at caulk galosh my have a sack was filled with purchases, including aniseed and bleach and curd, a dark enticing flap, do gore's a hat, Iceland jelly, kiwi fruit lozenges, mayonnaise and more items from the first half of the alphabet. Making my way home along the line that runs from cockcroft appointed town. I passed again the bench where that morning I had encountered the Victorian Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. Father Hopkins was no longer sitting on the bench. His place had been taken by a bespectacled chap with a high forehead at a glance. I took him to be a man of powerful intellect. Good afternoon, I said jauntily tipping my hat cat's foot ironclaw neurosurgeons scream for more. paranoia is poison door. He shouted. I beg your pardon. I asked disconcerted. 21st century scared side man. He bellowed. To my great excitement, it dawned on me that I was talking to cerebral pop God Robert Fripp of King Crimson. I had not been mistaken when I judged my interlocutor to be a man of great intellectual accomplishment. I'm thrilled to meet you, I babbled. For You are the man who managed to have an electric guitar technique named Fripp atronics after you, even though others have developed it and used it long before that shows chutzpah. bladderwrack barbed wire, he replied. Politicians funerals funeral pyre innocence raped with napalm fire 21st century scared side man. I tossed him a plum as I pondered the deep significance of his words. I treasured this moment. How rarely we find ourselves in the presence of genius. rarer still to meet genius, chutzpah, round spectacles and pop immortality commingled in one man, I was hanging on his every word. Death seed blind man's greed. he roared. I hastily scribbled it down in my notebook. poet's Starving Children bleed. He continued, as I gazed at him, Australia The afternoon some glistened on his spectacle lenses and shiny high forehead. Nothing he's got he really needs 21st century skin outside man, he growled. And with that he jumped up from the bench and head off down the lane. Sadly, he had ignored my gift of a plum, but I didn't let that spoil my glow of contentment. I walked briskly home to listen to my much treasured CD of toyah Wilcox his greatest hits.

The Robert Fripp fans among you may be pleased to know that after that piece appeared on the hooting od website, I got an email from my great friend Max desharnais, who told me about the website www.fripp.com which is actually run by Robert Fripp sister, who is a motivational business speaker in California. And there are many photographs of her doing her motivational business speaking, including her wearing her t shirt which says Get get flipped, not clipped, where she apparently gives haircuts at the same time as motivating her clients. absolutely superb I do recommend a visit to www.fripp.com. And yeah, this is a piece called boggo dan bourgault dan boggo dan, who will speak for boggo dan. I will speak for boggo dan? I will be boggo Dan's mouthpiece. I will say what I think boggo dan wants me to say something like there are cows in the field and trees at its edge. I think they are larges. And that is a hedge. When I say that I will point decisively or no not decisively but with a trembling finger as if I'm the terrified protagonist of a piece of spooky fiction in countering the ghost of one long dead. Then I will look back at boggo dan to make sure I have said what he would say in the circumstances if he but had a voice to speak with. Bogo Dan has been called my familiar. He is tiny and gray and flicks. The air around him is chill, but not unpleasantly so. He wears a little cap like a cadet in a small metal European army. He smokes disc blur to give himself I surmise a sophisticated Sheen, but the linings of his lungs are paper thin and I fear for his health. What will become of me without boggo dan, did you know that there is a special place for people who have been abandoned by their familiars? It is not a pretty place. Despite the fact that mirrored there are the cows, large trees and hedges of our own world. almost identical, but that they're all covered in Ecto plasm. Would I too, if deserted by boggo dan experienced the world through a refulgent film of white glue. Now there's a thought.
