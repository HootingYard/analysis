Good afternoon, this is resonance 104 point four FM. My name is Frank key. And this is hosting yard on the air. So as ever for the next half hour, I'm going to be reading various pieces of prose to you, interspersed with snatches of the Caucasian lullaby by Henry cow and slap Pappy from the 1975 album 30 years ago. desperate straits, those are the bits that go like this.

And then there's occasionally the the bits when I'm not talking, there's a sound of a crow. But that sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't. The reason for that is because the the technology that powers the the the music, or CRO interlude is frantically complicated. And I can't really explain how it works here, but it's kind of randomly generated by a top scientist. And before carrying on with today's show, I really need to hark back to last week. Last week, I read a piece called gods. And I did point out at the end that any listeners who felt that as tech Gods had been disparaged, should write to hooting yard at hooting yard, hooting dot yard at bt open world.com. To express their concern and I did get one letter. I got one letter from a listener named Maliki O'Neill. And he wrote demister key I was deeply upset to see as tech Gods compared unfavorably to ancient Egyptian gods on your program today. He must have written it soon after listening. He said. He says what the cloudlock and cats are collateral are if anything more valuable than raw, a nubus sesh at and Thoth if you are not more careful in future, you may well be placed on a stone slab and have your own trails ripped out as a sacrifice to the sun god. So that all sounds rather worrying. So I do apologize very deeply to Mr. O'Neill for perhaps being quite rude about as tech gods. I do suspect however, that he's probably an Aztec fundamentalist as opposed to one of those more liberal as Tech's who are a bit more like Quakers. Anyway, on with the show. And now I better read something to you. So I shall read a piece, which is entitled five tiny birds. Look, look, here are five tiny birds. That was a tiny bobolink I'm sure of it. I know a bobolink when I see one, which is not often admittedly, as I live in a hermit cave, though I am not a hermit by inclination. I am Gary jealous. Oh, and that looks like a tiny parula starlings favorite bird, according to the fat compendium of spurious bird related facts about the Soviet Union, my father's favorite book. My father was Gary Willis too, and no one ever asked him to live in a cave. He lived above a shop that sold prosthetic limbs. Now here comes another tiny bird. It is a tiny Scarlet tanager. Now that is a bird I've never heard of before. Gosh, hot on its heels comes a tiny painted bunting. Not that birds have heels as such. They have claws and talons or very thin little twig like feet. Some say that long. Long ago, human beings began to write by copying the tracks made by the feet of birds in snow or mud. There is one more tiny bird to come. I think it will be a tiny Harlequin duck. I can feel it in my water. Oops, I was wrong. It is a tiny mute swan. And now I too will become mute. For it is breakfast time. Time. For a bowl of roots and chaff, and I must concentrate on the effective working of my digestive juices.

And now some news or not news but new news ish sort of thing. facts as a perfect as opposed to fiction. That beacon of common sense and moderation the Reverend Ian Paisley described the recent 22 million pound bank robbery in Northern Ireland as the crime of the century, which made me think that things bode well for the next 95 years really. But his comments set me thinking about the crime of the century just gone. So I went to Google to have a look. There were 65,800 results, but I was able to discount the majority of these because they referred to songs by Shania Twain and Supertramp on second thoughts might be those titles were accurately self referential. Anyway, the usual suspects were predictably present JFK, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping Leopold and Loeb, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and more recently, the so called war on terror and the destruction of the rainforest. But I was more interested in the less celebrated misdeeds which had been described as the crime of the century. These included one government advice that people should take mineral and vitamin supplements to the demolition of a building in Missouri as part of the US Custom House and post office project. three and eight inch crawdads deposited in someone's grandmother's rain barrel. Just to remind you all of these things were described as the crime of the century for the recent Ukrainian elections. Junu kovitch supporter said of the view Shang COEs coup, this is the crime of the century worse than Hitler worse than Chernobyl. This is a battle to Armageddon. It's a battle between the Antichrist and Christian peoples. They are turning people into orange zombies, all of them have abnormal sexual energy must go to the Ukraine five the theft of an item of sporting memorabilia from Geelong football club. Six, the publication of the Kinsey reports sexual behavior in the human male 1948 and sexual behavior in the human female 1953. Kinsey is denounced on the website that describes this as the crime of the century as the patriarch of perversion. Next, because I've lost count, something I don't quite understand about cold fusion theories, to wit, and this is a quote, The hot fusion ears have made a fundamental error in judgment, because they are so thoroughly skilled in gas plasma physics, where light element fusion cannon does occur. They have expected that any fusion in an electrochemical cell on or near the surface of a metal lattice must be similar to fusion in a gas plasma. The only way the scientists could have been more seriously in error would be to condemn the discovery of cold fusion, which some did. And that's followed by an exclamation mark just to drive the point home that that was the crime of the century. Or was it that proposed sale of the kpfa radio station by its parent company, the Pacifica foundation? Or Finally, and I think this possibly could be the crime of the century. The theft from a photo shoot in the south of France, of an advanced copy of an album by a pop group called you two. Speaking of you too, is it just me or is there something faintly weird about a middle aged man going around calling himself v edge

This is a brief story entitled Blodgett fiendish X ray plot. Some say Blodgett conceived is fiendish X ray plot as revenge against a world that laughed at him because he was a short man, but they are wrong. Blodgett was not a diminutive stature. He was actually somewhere between six and seven feet tall. Although it's hard to be precise because he was resistant to tape measures. They would become knotted or twisted, or indeed simply burst into inexplicable flames when Blodgett was near at a snap of his fingers. similar devices, such as rulers or yard sticks would crumble the sawdust if they were wooden, or just dust if made of some other substance. Remember that Blodgett was a frightening frightening man. He conceived his fiendish X ray plot on a wild and windy Thursday, just a week after vilhelm Conrad orange Gunn discovered x rays accidentally while studying cathode rays in a high voltage gaseous discharge tube. Despite the fact that the tube was encased in a black cardboard box, runt can notice that a barium platino cyanide screen placed nearby by chance emitted fluorescent light whenever the tube was in operation, hearing the news on some sort of criminal grapevine. Blodgett immediately obtained a high voltage gaseous discharge tube and a barium platino cyanide screen, he sent his minions fanning out around town to steal a black cardboard box, and this led to his undoing. A disheveled plain clothes police officer, a protege of Chief Inspector kargh, Pan apprehended one of Blodgett 40 thieves trundling a stolen black cardboard box down on noise, some alleyway in the small hours of the morning. The box was not empty, it contained a tangle of enraged and venomous Vipers. The game was up. Sometimes when writing about failed criminal enterprises, one is tempted to embroider the bare facts in the interest of entertainment. Here, I'm content to let the facts speak for themselves. They may not speak eloquently, but they speak and that is enough 110 years after the foiling of Blodgett fiendish X ray plot. Although I would like to apologize for a piece of tautology in that piece, all Vipers are venomous. Apparently.

Back in the days of Starling, it was a brave soul who mocked the common turn. Uncle Joe and his myrmidons tended to get attacks of the vapors when ridiculed Svetlana B was not particularly brave. However. For one thing, she mocked the common turn from the comparative safety of a radio shack hidden in a village in the English fence, which she pronounced fence. Her regular nightly broadcasts were inaudible outside the shack itself, because none of her equipment was plugged into any kind of power source. Remember that we're talking here of Finland in the 1930s. You would be lucky to get hot water out of a spigot, let alone mock the common turn and be heard by dissident ham radio enthusiasts in Vladivostok, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, perm, or Omsk. Nevertheless, Svetlana B took no chances and her fierce mockeries of the common turn were delivered in two languages unfamiliar to starlings brutes she talked in got a variant of the crap spoken in the coastal towns of Eastern Ghana, and the subject of a fascinating grammar by sea problem published in Denmark in 1764. And she then repeated herself in avestan, the sacred language of Zoroastrianism. Small Zoroastrian communities still exist. In the Iranian towns of Yazd and Kerman, but these were strategically unimportant to the Soviet Empire, even if her words had been transmitted, however, more often than not, they would have been drowned out by the roaring icy gales sweeping across the flattened forbidding fens. Sometimes, the Radio Shack was so cold that Svetlana B took her samovar with her to brew up some steaming mugs of tea. No one had ever told her that it was an ornamental samovar. Svetlana B's husband had a Stalinist hat, a Stalinist mustache, and a heavily pockmarked face, just like Stalin. His appearance was the subject of much taunting by school aged Finland rascals, but that is another story, one that will keep for there is much else to tell about Svetlana B and her bilingual Comintern mockery, and her samovar and the fens, particularly the fens, the cold flats, spooky wet black fens, and the nocturnal animals which creep there and the phantoms that shimmer in the mist. I will tell you more another night children. For now it is time for your bedtime snack of fish heads and hot cocoa.

See, I told you that crow would turn up and this next piece is a quotation it's not written by me but I'm not gonna tell you who is written by until we get to the end of it. And what I want to do is quite long, and I want to try and read it very, very fast for some reason. So I'm going to have a cup of tea and then I'm going to try a sip of tea and then I'm going to try and read this very fast. So hold on. The Arabic word been within becomes when it means interval space been on this is the German and Dutch binnen and Saxon binnen, signifying within the Ethiopian word I off to fall asleep is the root of the word Morpheus, the God of sleep. The Hebrew word China to dwell is the parent of the Anglo Saxon in and Icelandic any a house and have our own word in a hotel. The Hebrew word navall or Nath owl signifies the fall from it is derived our word fall and fool one who falls. The chaldee word is not bow to make foul, and the Arabic word Nevada means to die, that is to fall from the last syllable of the chaldee. NASA to saw we can derive the Latin Sarah the hydro and Sargon, the Danish saga and our word to saw the Arabic Nikita to fade is the same as the Italian farto the Latin fatuous foolish, tasteless, the Dutch Abaddon and are to fade, the ethiopic word gabber to make to do and the Arabic word Jabara to make strong becomes the Welsh word God baru to work to operate the Latin operon and the English operate. The Arabic word abara signifies to practice thing we see this root in the world bar summit and part of spear and per spit. When's our word spear in the chaldee, Syriac and Arabic azog means to join to couple from this the Greeks obtain Zoo gos, the Romans dragon and the word yoke while the Germans obtained DRock or jog, the Dutch druk. The Swedes och, the Sanskrit is druga. The Arabic Santa to be old, reappears in the Latin senex the Welsh hen and are senile. The Hebrew bannerghatta build is the Irish bum Foundation and the Latin fondo from deruyter found the Arabic Baraka to bend the knee to fall on the breast is probably the Saxon breakout, the Danish BRAC, the Swedish braca wealth bhrigu and our word to break the Arabic Baraka also signifies to rain violently, and from this we get the sanctum or own to rain, Dutch Ragan terrain cambric Rocha rain Welsh reg rain, the chaldee would break a branch is the Irish BRAC or write an arm the Welsh break the Latin bracket and the English brace something which supports like an arm, the chaldee fraktur rub to try out grain is the same as the last in free co free oh and our word rake the Arabic word to rubbish cracker the child D rag rag means to dissolve along for it is the same as the Greek orig. The Latin pour again the rat, the Saxon ro con, the Icelandic Ratna, the German reichen and Otto reach to rage. The Arabic rocket a strain or purify as wine is precisely our English word rack to rack wine. The Hebrew word bra to create is our two best to bear children. A great number of words in all European languages contain this route and its various modifications. The Hebrew word cafardo cover is our word to cover and coffer something which covers and covert a secret place. From this route also comes the Latin coupe area, and the French couvrir. To cover the Arabic word shakaama. To bind under the belly is our word to shackle from the Arabic while Lada and Ethiopian while adds to be get to bring forth we get the wells road who are shouting out and hence our word lad, our word matter or pass is from the Arabic matter. Our word mature is originally from the chaldee meter, the Arabic word our meter signifies to end and from this comes the noun, a limit a termination, Latin meta and our words meat and meat. I might continue this list, but I have given enough to show that all the Atlantean races one spoke the same language and that's from Ignatius Donnelly's book, Atlantis, the antediluvian world.

Vat indefatigable Crone, Mrs. gubbins has announced the launch of a brand new subscription only magazine, and she's written a little piece to tell us all about it, but she couldn't be with us today, so I'm gonna have to read it on her behalf. Hello, listeners, Mrs. gubbins here. It was a dark and stormy night, just like in that novel by Edward bulwer Lytton and I was lying awake in bed, tossing and turning under my counterpane watching little fairies twinkling over by my washstand when I had one of my bright ideas, actually, the fairies may have been moths. Anyway, all of a sudden, I realized that there would be a huge market for a glossy magazine with a spine, probably devoted to Velcro dubbing and crayons. I jumped out of bed a bit critically, and went over to my escrow, rummage to my lawn yet found a pad and a pencil and scribbled down my idea is in the dark, because my little lamp is broken, and I was too excited to go all the way across the room to turn on the main light. I decided to call my magazine, a daily digest about Velcro dubbing and crayons by Bathsheba gubbins Mrs. That has a nice ring to it, don't you think? In the first issue, I thought I would tell my 1000s of subscribers. The story of how George de mestral invented Velcro in 1948. After taking his dog for a walk. I will design a unique two sided fastener he decided one side with stiff hooks like burrs and the other side with soft loops like the fabric of my pants. I think he must have been American. I will call my invention Velcro, a combination of the words very law and crochet, it will rival a zipper in its ability to fasten. So that first article would take up a few pages, then I would have a picture spread about dubbin a combination of oils, beeswax and other waxes. Hence the pleasant smell when opening the can. I would have to make a few telephone calls come morning to see if I could include a little scratch and sniff panel on page 14. The remainder of issue one would be an exciting article all about crayons, including the fact that Alice Binney came up with the brand name Crayola by combining two words that mean oily chalk. Cray in French means chalk and oleaginous means oily. By the time I had planned out the first issue, the storminess of the night had ceased, and it was still but before going to bed back to bed to have a good long smooth, I made a quick note about what should go on the cover. I decided that each issue should have a full color cover picture of a celebrity if possible. Shown holding or using or maybe just ruminating upon Velcro dabbing or crayons? Who could it be for the launch issue? It would have to be a toss up between new US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Glenn kornek. One time bass guitarist of Jethro towel.

collagen seems to get around. Here is an extract. This is the last piece on today's show. And hopefully I'll be back again next week if I haven't been sacrificed to the Sun God, but I haven't insulted any Aztec Gods this week so far. Here's an extract from a pamphlet Dobson wrote entitled portraits of eight pallid men with a complexion of curd. This pallid man with a complexion of curd held his listeners spell bound as standing upright in a high wind. He told them of the death of avise Center by taking nine clusters together in a fit of the colleague. his audience had no sooner digested this news than the good doctor moved on, informing them that all the air beyond food is thick, condensed and jellied looking just like sea lungs. They badgered him with questions, all of which he answered with good grace, and no little humor, before describing to them a snow piece of land and trees covered with snow and ice and mountains of ice floating in the sea, with bears, seals, foxes, and variety of rare fouls upon them. Then explaining the priests curing of mad dogs by burning them in the forehead with Saint balance key before describing the quite unrelated matter of a noble cause Vandross or stone taken out of a vouchers head. Brains bit designed by the doctors, magpie mind, his listeners were near replete, yet he had one more topic for them, ending his lecture with a 20 minute anecdote of bewildering complexity, about a glass of spirits made of a theory all salt, hermetically sealed up, kept continually in Quicksilver, of so volatile in nature, that it will scarce enjoy the light, and therefore only to be shown in winter, or by the light of a carbuncle, or barnone and stone. And then he was done, and he pulled his black cape about his shoulders, and he swept away into the wind, implacable and majestic of the finest fiber from which a man can be human, not withstanding his palette of curd

so that's all from hitting yard on the air for this week, next week, we should probably have pieces about St. mungo, who was assigned who is also known as Kenta gern we may have a brief extract from a lecture delivered by Knute hellhound A Guide to pointy town and possibly a little story called the file of broth that's file p h. i l for those of you taking notes, which I suspect is all of you, bye for now.
