Good afternoon you're listening to the radio more specific way you could be listening to a computer I suppose it most specifically you're listening to resonance 104 point four FM. And my name is Frank key and it's four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon here in London, which means it's time for hooting yard on the air. First item this week is I'm going to talk to you about scruffy Allah and penitence in the Middle Ages. scrofula is the Latin word for brood sow, and it's the term applied to a tuberculous infection of the chain of lymph glands in the neck, creating swellings between the angle of the jaw and the top of the breastbone. It has been known to afflict people since antiquity, and during the Middle Ages was known as the king's evil, because it was thought that the monarchs touch would cure it. We may scoff at such naivety, especially given the rather disturbing personal habits of kings and queens past and present. An early scoffer was a man named Valentine great rakes 1628 to 1666, a Cromwellian soldier during the English Civil War. In the revolutionary mood of the time, he correctly surmised that God could act through himself Valentine great rakes, as well as he could through the Royal personnage. And so he did his own scruffier healing by gently stroking his patience. He also applied poultices made from carrots, although it's unclear whether these were divinely inspired. Back in the Middle Ages, of course, when only the king was thought to be capable of curing scruffier by touch. There was also a great enthusiasm for penitence, natural calamities of all kinds, with thought to be the terrible judgment of an angry God, and not unreasonable idea in the circumstances. pestilence was met with penitence rather than with carrot poultices. Although perhaps I'm oversimplifying, no doubt there were some canny peasants who use both approaches. And what can we learn from this? Oh, tiny ones? Well, if you think you have contracted scruff ealer or indeed any other maladies such as Asiatic bird flu, a pandemic of which we are promised by World Health officials, you would be well advised to repent of your sins, preferably in a manner that involves the mortification of the flesh. And while doing so, you could great some carrots. Next week, we'll take a look at fundamentalist as tech sun worshipers and swamp fever.

Next, I'd like to give you a completely accurate account of a dream I had just before I woke up this morning. Usually, you know, you one has these dreams and you wake up and within seconds, it's gone. It's just vanished from from one's mind. So that's my experience anyway, but this morning, I somehow managed to remember it long enough to write it down. And this is what happened in the dream. I was in an unknown seaside resort with a companion whose identity was hazy. We were walking and past a couple of men of Mediterranean appearance gone and dressed in very plain neat brown coats and hats. But I had a film noir err. If they hadn't been so thin, Peter Lorre would have been a good choice to play one or both of them. You remember Peter Lorre from the Maltese Falcon, stop twisting my arm him. Anyway, I turned to my companion pointed at one of the men and said, he just said him. The manner whom I had pointed, thrust out his hand, clad in a brown leather glove and clutched me around the throat He fixed me with a stare more intense than menacing and withdrew his hand, leaving the glove mysteriously in place. That is the glove of ID he announced. Now read this. And he handed me a pamphlet, on which was written. He has weak bomba is bomba is not good. I understood that this referred to me. The words were printed in heavy black block capitals on brown paper and reminded me of a vortices tract like Windham Louis's blast, the glove of air around my neck was not uncomfortable, but I wanted to be rid of it. That Peter Lorre fingers had disappeared. time had passed, and I walked around the seaside resort alone now trying to find them. And then I woke up. Well, can it all mean? I should point out that I didn't wait to find myself being strangled nor had my neck become entangled by a stray dressing gown called or length of string. One thing of which I'm sure is that for the rest of to do you know that as of today, I've got to work have to work hard on strengthening my bomba. And a brief addendum to that last week, last week, I had one of those dreams. I don't know if you have those dreams, you have a dream in which you read or write something of absolutely breathtaking profundity. And usually, the earth shattering words are forgotten as soon as you wake up. And the whole morning is spent in a state of frustration, trying to retrieve what seemed so meaningful. On this occasion, I was lucky enough to recall what I had written in my dream, and I can thus share my dazzling insight with you. It was a poem, and in its entirety, it read as follows. I'm going to try and read this in a suitably profound tone of voice because it is very profound this poem that I dreamt that I wrote, We are steam, and we mean what we mean. This is a story in titled glib Hatter. One of the stories I grew up with that I heard 100 times that my mother's knee was the tail of the glib Hatter.

Unknown Speaker  08:09
When I say, my mother's knee, I'm using a cliche, of course, for one thing, I did not literally squat at my mother's knee. And in any case, she had two knees. If I wanted you to picture me so many years ago, hearing the tale of the glib Hatter, and if I had squatted as indicated, I would have been precise and said, at my mother's left knee or at my mother's right knee, not just at my mother's knee. Unless of course, she had only one knee due to amputation of one of her legs above the knee, which was happily not the case. Although even if it were, it would still be proper to indicate which knee the left or the right she retained after old Mr. sawbones had to chop the leg with the other one off and put it on a pyre to be burned. I heard my mother tell me the tale of the glib Hatter many times, but usually when I was tucked up in bed under my blankets ready for sleep. In fact, almost always, I drifted into sleepy land while my mother was in the middle of the story. Sometimes, she would only get as far as the bit whether Glebe Hatter steals a basket of potatoes from the ice maiden if I was a little more alert, for example, if I snuck into the pantry before bed and helped myself to a few glucose tablets, which I sometimes did, for I craved glucose as a child, and still do. I might be able to remain awake for as long as it took my mother to reach the point in the story, where the glib Hatter is attacked by a bison out on the savanna But usually I was so exhausted for my Canadian Air Force exercises that my eyelids were drooping almost as soon as that dulcet voice said once upon a time there was a hatter and the Hatter was glib.

Unknown Speaker  10:22
I do want you to be able to picture me all tucked up listening to my bedtime story. It is important that you can see in your mind's eye, the blankets, the bed, the carpet and the curtains, the floor, ceiling and walls, the chair and chest of drawers and all the other things in my room, and me with my towel mop of hair snug on the pillow. And my mother sat by my bedside her hair in a bun and her smoke filthy from cooking. One plump hand holding the book and the other plump hand holding a torch. It's faint beam aimed at the page from which he is reading. For we had no electricity in the house. We relied on that one torch and many many candles. I forgot to say that there would always be a dog on the floor at the foot of the bed. It was a Mastiff called Bob. My mother insisted in later years that it was named after President Nixon's disgraced indeed imprisoned Chief of Staff, HR Bob Haldeman. But she was wrong. She was also wrong. The master was called Bob for quite a different reason. It saddened me in those later years to argue over this so violently with my dear mother. After all those hours she had spent reading the tale of the glib Hatter to me by torchlight while I fell asleep in my bedroom, on the attic floor of the House on the edge of the marshes. That crumbling house that stood all alone, surrounded by will of the wisps, and eerie flickering lights.

Unknown Speaker  12:21
I remember that once I managed to stay awake for the whole story, my mom began to read after giving me my tumbler of hot milk at around nine o'clock. It was winter, so already pitch dark outside. mercifully, the shutters were closed tight, and all the doors had been locked and double locked. The only sounds with a tick tock of the clock on my bedroom wall. The wheezing breath of Bob the master foot, the foot of my bed. And, frankly and from across the marshes far far away, the bellowing of old farmer fracks barnyard animals as he herded them from one field to another, back and forth, over and over again throughout the night for no apparent purpose. One of the first things I ever learned was the old farmer Frank was a mad old man, and if I ever came face to face with him, I should turn and run like the wind. I don't know why I was so wakeful that night Why I listened so intently as my mother reached a bit in the story about the ice maidens potatoes, and then the bison attack. And still I lay why died lapping up every detail new things I had never heard before, because I always dropped off. Things like the glib Hatter falling down a pothole, and eating lettuce and the blind man getting his hair cut, and 1000s of frogs and the part where the glib Hatter treats cards when playing whist with the widow and the village where all the children wear pointy caps and the adventures of the pit pony and the part where a vaporous apparition of Ringo Starr floats over the rooftops and the glib Hatter gets mixed up with our lacks Potter and the shrubs and firestorms and cartoni. Astor and clay, an architecture and a new serum and Klondike Gold, and cows and crows and bauxite and birdseed, and huge ponds filled with teardrops, millions and billions of teardrops in millions and billions of sad and salty ponds. I think it must have been about four o'clock in the morning when my mother read and that is the end of the story of the glib Hatter She extinguish the torch and kissed my forehead and I shut my eyes at last and fell asleep.

Unknown Speaker  15:35
I have a letter last week from my mild maca, Max desharnais wit sage and originator of the well known catchphrase well tie me to a tree and call me Barry and singer and and and moving spirits in the band The Flaming stars. Anyway, Max wrote to tell me that he'd recently been in his recent reading, he learned of the now neglected British surrealist painter Robin Ironside. And Max writes, when he wasn't designing the four foot obelisk in seven Hampton churchyard, which commemorates Ian Fleming, Ironside painted pictures with titles that might appeal to you. They do they do. Here are the titles of six paintings by Robin Ironside from the 1940s Street entertainer playing threatening music to a cinemark you a picture to prove the Greeks only painted with three colors. wounded man in bed sitting room, crowd awaiting a portent famous statues visiting a museum of people. And finally, patients suffering from waxy insensibility. I've been trying to track these pictures down on the web but reproductions of them and I can't find them anywhere but maybe a listener can never have a look around and see if I can find something. But they do sound like they're really good paintings. I like the idea of them.

Last month on In fact, on the 14th of January, I I celebrated as I do the feast day of St. Mango. You ought to know that st mangoes Mother tenue was thrown from the top of crap brain law. A large Hill outside Edinburgh by her father lost. Because she survived the plunge. It was thought she was a witch. So she was cast adrift in a Caracal fetching up at St. surfs religious establishment on Cole Ross. She gave birth to mango on the beach. All of this happened by the way in the sixth century, ad. Mango had a bell. He's a very important saint to Robbins, because St. Surf had a pet Robin which was slaughtered by mangoes jealous classmates, who hope to pin the blame on him. But mango restored the bird to life. Later on, he swapped his pastoral stave with St. Columba. There is a special mass for St. mungo dating from the 13th century, which has been printed by the balandis. The balandis are an association of ecclesiastical scholars engaged in editing the act of sanctorum a great haghia graphical collection began during the first years of the 17th century and continued to our own day. The work was conceived by Heribert Roz Wade 1569 to 1629 under the title fasti sanctorum korum vitai in belgic is biblio tech is manuscript ti. He gave in a little volume published by the plant in press in Antwerp, an alphabetical list of the names of the saints whose acts had been either found by him or caught his attention in our manuscript collections. This list filled 50 pages. The preparatory notice in which he indicates the character and arrangement of his work takes up a further 14 Finally, the contains an appendix of 26 pages, containing the unpublished act of the passion of the Holy cillessen martyrs. Faris, Gus probis and Andronicus but not mango, who was not in any case, a holy silly see and martyr and I do apologize I mispronounced The first of those great Holy silicea martyrs it's fast circus. Anyway, Roz Wade planned supplementary volumes, which would include the authors of the lives the suffering of the martyrs. The images of the saints, liturgical rites and customs mentioned in hagiographical documents, profane customs to which allusions had been made questions of chronology, names of places encountered in the same documents, barbarous or obscure terms which might puzzle the readers and tables showing the names of the saints whose lives had been published in the proceeding volumes. The same names followed by notes indicating the place of the saints birth is station in life is titled the sanctity, the time and place in which he had lived and the author of his life, the state of life of the various saints, religious priest, Virgin widow, etc. Their position in the church, apostle, Bishop, Abbot, etc. The nomenclature of the saints according to the country's made it illustrious by their birth, postulate, sojourn burial, nomenclature of the places in which they are honored with a special cult enumeration of the maladies for the cure of which they are especially invoked. The professions placed under their patronage, the proper names of persons and places encountered in the published lives. The passages of Holy Scripture, they're explained, points which may be of use in religious controversies. Those applicable in the teaching of Christian doctrine, a general table of words and things in alphabetical order, and other still added to the author, if anything of importance presents itself, of which our readers may give us an idea. This is such an important topic that we shall return to it at a later date. Meanwhile, you the listener can commit to memory the little rhyme associated with St mango, which goes as follows. For tree that never grew. The bird that never flew the fish that never swam, the bell that never rang.

Unknown Speaker  23:03
Everything in that last item was entirely true, I hasten to add everything about some manga, as is this last week, I mentioned that Mrs. gubbins was about to issue a new magazine. All About Velcro dubbin and crayons, and she's just sent by a pneumatic packet and note to say that she has expanded the purview of her new publication. In addition to Velcro dubbing and crayons her daily digest will also cover a string grease bellows, plasma gas, methods of divination parcels, The Love Boat, different types of paste hints on horticulture, the lifecycle of bumble bees, Spring Heeled jack grizzly bears, cotton, cotton maver, shampoo recipes, tungsten railings, poop deck etiquette, the Lindbergh kidnapping hoax, towels blizzards, Coco genuflection hatred floppy things irked Klondike gold prospectors, The Legend of annexure grow tax, Inc. bales crumpled things the burger masters of Cali dots on a transparent plain geese why Jeff is now called safe.

Hark the herald angels sing. Hark. The Herald Angels are singing the song of staccato of the heroic worker. The Herald Angels are legion, but there are only two staccato elves. That's right to one staccato is busy at the Forge. Just like Felix Randall, a farrier, busy in his bellowing room, smelting iron or hammering a huge sheet of steel with implacable industry. The other staccato is a pale aesthete. He has a bow tie, luxuriant locks, a thin Ronald Coleman mustache, and he's lounging in a butter coffee meadow, propped on one immaculate elbow, reading a book of poetry. It is the collected lyrics of some forgotten noodling progressive rock group. What will become of the two staccato nerves? Hark. Let us listen to what the Herald Angels are singing. The hero worker at his Forge, the seat in a meadow lamp black one and the other in surge, but both and on the gallows. Gosh, so according to the Herald Angels, both stay con offs will come to a sticky end, we must assume that they can accurately predict the future being Herald Angels. When they had finished their song, we sent one of our reporters to interview them. They were not happy about this, but put forward one of their number, an angel named anger wreck Tom to act as their spokes Angel. Now you and I know that anger rectum is a fumigating angel rather than a true Herald Angel, so it should be no surprise that the interview was unsatisfactory. In any event, our reporter found that his tape recorder malfunctioned, and all he could hear when he played back the tape was the sound of mighty and glorious angelic hosannas, not unlike spam in Allium by Thomas Tallis. As Dobson once wrote, in another context, angels sing and devils make a din, but the heroic worker pounces hammer, and the poet praises Starling. I think that before too long, you and I and both stuck, Arnold's will be deafened by the Devil's Den. And to footnotes to that piece, footnote one. Alexey grigorii of extra struck on off was the heroic Soviet worker who, in 1935, extracted 102 tons of coal in a six hour shift, exceeding the norm more than seven fold. staccato was from the done yet basin, one of a number of basins which we will be examining here at hooting yard in the coming weeks. The abiding fascination of basins is subject to almost criminal neglect, a situation we hope to put right. Please note, however, that not all basins are sites of coal extraction, and certainly not of heroic works of heroic coal extraction by heroic Stakhanovite. And footnote number two, it is unlikely that Ronald Colman ever extracted coal from a basin in his life heroically or otherwise, but he had other talents, one of which led to him being known as the man with the velvet voice. Coleman will never be forgotten Of course, the starred alongside Greer Garson in the single most heart rending tear jerker of all time, random harvest, watch written, weep, and then watch it again and weep again. Is there another film with so preposterous a plot, which remains utterly and completely captivating at the umpteenth viewing? And that's all for this week. Thank you for listening. Bye bye
