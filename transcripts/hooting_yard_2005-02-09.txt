My name is Frank Kay, this is hooting out on the air yahveh who Sita is, of course the space greeting, which was communicated by extraterrestrial beings to Tony Wade, the founder of the staff fellowship, of which more later no music This week the Caucasian lullaby has been, has been has just been found. So there will be music isn't that good. But before the music, Tales of the uncanny, here are three brief Tales of the uncanny tale of the uncanny number one. I was sitting in a Bower on a bright summer's day, the air heady with verbena, eating my snack. All of a sudden, gruesome separations of foul smelling Extra Terrestrial hideousness began oozing from my jam sandwich, and I swooned when I came to. I had a tiny radio transmitter implanted in my forehead, but I remained unaware of it for the rest of my life. tale of the uncanny number two they called him mctavish, and he was the village wrestler. He lived in a room above the post office. No other living being ever set foot in the room until the day mctavish died. They found him lying on his bed, as if he were asleep, but there was no doubt that he was dead. For hovering above his chest was a baleful Phantom, emitting gruesome separations of foul smelling extraterrestrial hideousness, which it poured into a funnel inserted into mctavish his right ear. They closed up the room and nailed the door shot and it remained unopened for the next 100 years.

tale of the uncanny number three hand me that chaffinch young Cabot, said Jarvis to his lantern, jawed Asst. Jarvis was a top bird scientist. And every Tuesday he devoted to the study of chaffinches. They were out wandering the hills, Jarvis and Cabot and the boffin had spotted a chaffinch near a babbling brook as the knock kneed youth clumsily picked up the chaffinch. He heard a screen behind him, spinning around, dropping the chaffinch in the process. He saw Jarvis being engulfed by a giant fold. The poor lad scampered back to the lab and told what had happened to Mrs. purgative, the kindly old washer woman. Well, I never heard of such a thing. she exclaimed, and she hoisted her mop on her shoulder took Cabot by his withered hand, and led him far, far away, all the way to Gondwana land. And those three tails of the uncanny are taken from an out of print pamphlet by Dobson entitled 626 uncanny tales together with a pen portrayed of Victoria principle. You see, I told you we'd have music. The Caucasian lullaby Of course by slap happy and Henry cow from 1975. Last week, you may recall if you were listening to hooting yd on the air yahveh who Sita that's today's catchphrase, but from the star fellowship, and I must stop babbling listen. Last week, I explained about a dream I've had in which, among other things, I was handed a pamphlet by a man who looked like Peter Lorre. And the pamphlet said in big letters, he has weak bomba, his bomba is not good. And that this referred to me and I have been puzzling over what this might mean. Ever since I had the dream Really? Anyway, pansy cradle drew has provided a possible solution to the mystery. She wrote to the hooting yard website. And I'd like to read her letter which appears there on the website, which is, as you know, the address is http colon, two forward slashes hooting.yard.users.bt. Open world.com try to remember all those dots. Anyway, here is pansies letter. Dear Mr. Key, she wrote, by remarkable coincidence, on the very day that you addressed your weak bomba. I was doing some internet research on bees, as I often do when I find myself at a loose end. From the excellent website maintained by hanja and hands, I learned that bumble bees are of the genus Bombus. In case you're wondering, bumble bees are big and extremely hairy bees. A few species of bumblebees are being bred nowadays to take care of pollination in greenhouses. They turn out to be very useful in growing tomatoes and cucumbers. One can buy colonies in specialized chops and on the internet. When flying, most bumblebees are producing lots of noise attracting our attention that way, they belong to the most beloved of all insects, for they are the perfect messengers announcing spring is on the way.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
bumblebees have typical warning colors, black and yellow, or black and red. And it's true, all species are capable of stinging, but they are not very willing to do so. We can even take many species in our hand. As long as we don't squeeze them, they won't sting us at all. Only bumblebees laying on their back should never be touched. For this is their typical defense position, indicating they feel threatened and are ready to sting. The poison I inject is harmless except for those allergic to wasp poison. If you're not sure, arrange to have yourself stung by a wasp. While a team of experts in insect toxicity stand at the ready with bleepers. Bumblebee bumblebees are a typical insect of moderate climate zones. With a few species, even surviving Arctic conditions. You won't find them in the tropics, though. The hairs on the body ensure that they don't call off too soon. But there is more. Just like mammals. bumblebees control their own body temperature, they can detach the muscles used to move their wings. And by moving the detached muscles rapidly, they produce their own body heat. This is the reason you can sometimes find a motionless Bumblebee on the ground or a flower. It is not dying or sick. It does not, as you would say in your dream have weak bomba, but it is simply heating up its own body. But due to the fact that the wings are detached from their muscles, it is not capable of flying at a time. Anyway, it seems clear to me that your dream about bomba was a dream about two or more bumba says there is something bubbling bubbling away in your subconscious that makes you preoccupied with weak and not good bumblebees. Do you mean evil? Or Ill? I suggest Mr. key that you search your soul with rigor. Did you perhaps one stamp on our little bombas use astutely pansy cradle Joe and one brief note Pangea refers to a website run by hands and hanja the address of which you can get on the hosting yard website and hands on hanja are currently seeking help in identifying an identified wasps and bees. So if you think you could be of assistance in that project, go and find out and tell them the names of various unidentified wasps and bees. I first learned about Tony Wade, and the staff fellowship in a great pamphlet called cosmic friends by Jimmy got odd, which is absolutely genuine. In fact, I think Jimmy Goddard may have a website. Anyway, I think this is one of the most brilliant pieces of writing in the English language. It's a what? Six 812 page 12 page pamphlet, which includes a I'm holding it now includes a picture of a kind of rose winger. Rose rose Wingo Wenceslas boot, whatever that is. Anyway, I'd like to read a few are lots of dot the program this week with a few extracts from cosmic friends by Jimmy Goddard. Now and then, and here's one. Basically the book is all about Jimmy's pamphlet is all about Jimmy's ability to communicate with extraterrestrial beings. There was an interesting communication at of all places saulsbury railway station in 1966. I was advised by communications to build a copper cone to help my condition. having read of the apparent Atlantean cones in other tongues of a flesh by George humped Williamson with their complicated circuits, I felt unqualified to build one.

Unknown Speaker  11:45
The answer wrapped back, just build a simple cone of copper that's not beyond you is it? I set up with a start. Surely space people would not talk like that. But it jerked me out of my self pity. And I began a regular daily use of a cone, which my father made from a piece of scrap sheet copper.

Unknown Speaker  12:30
This is a story called Norwegian wall. Remember, mctavish the villa Dressler his ugly death was described in the second of the tales of the uncanny. Remember how it began, they called him mctavish. They did indeed call him mctavish. But mctavish was not his name. His name was Krista Berg. That's b u, r, h, g. And as well as being a village wrestler, he was the village knits man. The village had had a knit man ever since the invention of true knitting, which is to say around 1100 ad. If we accept that the first historical example of knitting as we know it today, as opposed to other kinds of textile work, is a pair of patterned cotton socks found in Egypt. This is not the place to investigate, have a craft traveled from the Nile Delta, via the English clergyman William Lee's knitting machine of 1589 to the godforsaken rustic signage. Depo, where Krista Berg lived all those centuries later, there was a village knits woman too, but by a curious tradition, it was forbidden for the to ever to meet. Because it was a very small village. Extraordinary precautions were taken involving fences, barricades, false walls, lanes blocked by herds of restless barnyard animals, clocks, wound misleadingly.

Unknown Speaker  14:11
undelivered

Unknown Speaker  14:12
telegrams, pits dog and camouflaged and in extremists eldritch tampering with the continuum. By that I mean of course the space time continuum. I was just trying to save my words as carefully as Krista Berg saved his wall. The village nets man always used Norwegian wall. Although the village was not a Norwegian one. Happy as I would be to report that it was in Finland near the karelian holiday resort of bomba. I have to admit that it was not even in Scandinavia. Be that as it may. Christopher hug was careful with his wall He was also careful with his food for poisoning was rife in this village. There had been many problems with ergot before the war, and afterwards, and there were many socio paths at large. Fortunately, they were easily identified because by decree they were all made to wear chaps spat and boxy jackets, and to live in a purple tent near a clump of gasworks. Careful with wool and careful with food. Christopher hug or mctavish, as they called him, was nevertheless a sitting duck when attacked by a ghoul with a funnel. As we've already seen.

Unknown Speaker  16:02
The Finnish or Korean kerela karelian seaside holiday resort of bomba is a genuine place. And maybe I was dreaming about that. And this is historical Claude serpentine Claude had been in a gale. I asked him what sort of girl it was. I've got a lot of time for serpentine Claude.

Unknown Speaker  16:28
howling

Unknown Speaker  16:29
he said, my my a howling Gale was the nabin of my reply. Was there a snap? Claude there was a plutocrat with a thing about Mary Pickford said there was a snap and it was cold. I was beginning to picture serpentine Claude in a howling Gale during a cold snap, but I was hungry for further details. Claude misinterpreted my expression and handed me a pie. He is serpentine but generous, as well as plutocratic. It was a very tasty pie, and I ate it at once. It was a puff pastry pie with a filling of filberts and be barage. While I crude, Claude told me that the Gale during the snap was accompanied by rain. I did not want to speak with my mouth full of pie. And before I could ask Claude to describe the nature of the rain, he rushed away along that old canal towpath hectic with foxgloves to a festival of Mary Pickford films being shown at the shipshape cinema in tentera BIM I swallowed the last of the pie, which did my binoculars and took careful note of a swallow perched on the bow of a sycamore over to the west. Or it may have been a Finch, I'm always getting the mixed up ever since the railway accident. I have a psychic premonition of the railway accident, just like the hundreds of people who foresaw in their dreams, the sinking of the Titanic in April 1912. There is a good book by George bear, he which catalogs them one day, I may find out if anyone else shared my premonition of the railway accident, and I too, might collect them into a book. Years later, I received a letter from serpentine, Claude, and this is what he wrote. Dear is fun. It has long been on my conscience through all the years that I ensnared the world in my plutocratic web, that I may have mistaken your lack of fixated curiosity about the Gale during the snap for one of simple hunger. That is why I gave you the last of my puff pastry fill button be boring pies. But I was wrong, wasn't I? I think I knew I was wrong within minutes of stalking off along that foxglove strewn towpath. But to my shame, I did not turn back to rectify my error. I was so hot for Mary Pickford, that I gave you nary another thought. Please accept my apologies. And let me along last tell you what your heart has burned to know through all the succeeding years through the rains on earth have a fair few pontiffs in the howling Gale during the cold snap. The rain was torrential. It fell intolerance. Yours faithfully, serpentine Claude.

Unknown Speaker  20:20
In the last, in the last extract I read from cosmic friends by Jimmy Goddard, he mentioned that he needed a cone to help his condition. You may have wondered what that condition was. So here's another brief extract. It must have been in 1962. That in looking into a mirror, I noticed the scar which I've had on my forehead since an injury at the age of five, and suddenly realized that it could extend into my brain and be causing the problem. problems that have dogged me throughout my life. I feel this must have been a communication. Much later, I was to realize myself to be virtually living on half a brain due to non cooperation of the medical profession. I eventually with advice and encouragement from my communicators, made a rudimentary brain scanner, which seemed to confirm this. So if we imagine Jimmy with his copper cone and his rudimentary brain scanner, let's move on. This is kind of careers advice. If anyone needs any careers advice it is possibly advertising but I hope not. It's called so you want to become a hero specs. If you're interested in becoming a hero specs, the first thing to do is to choose a sacrificial victim and slaughter it. Or, if you're squeamish, have it slaughtered for you. It might be a duck or a hen or a hair. And if you're having delusions of grandeur, you can always use a larger animal like a performing seal or a giraffe, Harris Percy's tend not to engage in human sacrifice. And it's well not to give the police any pretext to investigate your doings. In current law, there is no play of Harris, Beck's them to defend you against a murder rap.

Unknown Speaker  22:26
Remember that it's important. Now, once the victim has been slain, it's your job to interpret the end trails. You will be following in a long tradition. Back in ancient Etruscan times, the earliest Harris Percy's learned their art from tigers, a being who suddenly sprang from the ground near tarquini. Tigers always claimed to be the grandson of Jupiter. And there's no one ever challenged him on this. It must have been so I know what you're going to ask. Victim killed. Check, splattered with Gore, check. disposition of em trails visible check, but how to interpret them? Well, that's where your local library comes in. Early Horace Percy's sometimes known as x this, Percy's wrote a series of instructional manuals called Liberty harrows. Specifically, for gorillas and Tawny true alleys and copy should be available if you ask the librarian in a very quiet voice, making sure you maintain eye contact. Bear in mind that municipal librarians become rightly suspicious of shifty eyed borrowers. And if that means fixing them with a stare of unhinged mad capillary, so be it. These ancient tomes are not forbidden as far as I know, and you have every right to borrow them unless you owe outstanding fines. I should have told you to get copies of the Harris phocoena manuals before slaughtering your eel or bat or whatever creature you selected. Sorry. Anyway, by consulting the books, you will be well placed to interpret from the fresh end trails for will of the gods and that's all there is to it. If you're vegetarian or vegan, you can still qualify as a Harris specs by issuing and trails and instead interpreting pour tenter. That is lightning, earthquakes and all extraordinary phenomena in nature. Unlike those snotty nosed augers, with their professional association, Harris Percy's tend to be self employed. You can drum up business by advertising in the yellow pages or I noticed in your news agents or post offices window, good luck, and one satisfied customer Rosemary F of Swanage says, I followed the so you want to be a comma haruspex course. And I now employ eight people and take three ancient Etruscan holidays a year.

Unknown Speaker  25:56
Shall began with three uncanny three Tales of the uncanny, not three uncanny tales, three Tales of the uncanny, and I've already read a follow up to the one number two about the village wrestler called mctavish or Chris de Burgh. This is another story about the subject of story number three, which was about Jarvis and Kubot on and it goes as follows. The bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis, the bird scientist. Look you young tyke, there is a bird on the bell tower. He said his pneumonia erector system COVID, who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips. Drive is pointed at the bird expecting cupboard to look but the spindly youth was distracted by a passing Pan technicon all a clutter with pots and pans. It was the neighborhood when the man on his rounds. Jarvis hated the windy man, for his clattering pots and pans made a din that often frightened birds so that they flew away into the blue majestic skies, just as the ornithologist was creeping close with his tweezers and bird beaker. The windy man on the other hand, was passionately in love with Jarvis, and had been ever since he had seen the bird scientist standing on a dais making a bird related proclamation years ago. For all the world like an Apollonian God, or so he seemed to the windy man. But the windy man was shy and dead not speak of His love. So he pined and felt pangs and was in torment. Kubot knew nothing of what is related in that paragraph. By chance a snapshot exists at this precise moment. It was taken by a passing camera buff, whose fancy had been taken by a pirouetting mechanical new gutter vending machine, all pink and gleaming. There it is to the left in the black and white photograph in front of the bell tower. To the right in the foreground, we see the back of cupboards head next to a furious looking Jarvis. partially obscured behind them is the windy man's Pan technicon, on which some of the clattering pots and pans are visible. Sadly, the windy man's face is blurred by a smudge or a cloud of gnats or freakish erfolgen of mist and gas. It could be any of those things. In framing his photo, the enthusiasts did not include the upper part of the bell tower. So we do not know what kind of bird Jarvis was pointing at, nor whether it was a bird at all, or just a flattering black napkin born aloft on a gentle summer breeze. Given avian form through the power of Jarvis's unquenchable imagination, ever after he insisted it was a trumpeter swan.

Unknown Speaker  29:39
And that's all we have time for this week. So I'll be back next week and until then, Java who Sita
