Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. And my name is not Frank key. Frankie couldn't be worse this week. So instead, I'm his doppelganger. And I've come to do the show instead. I sound like Frank key. I look like Frankie to

Unknown Speaker  00:35
all intents and purposes on may as well be frank key. And for those of you who've read the true memoirs and Confessions of a justified sinner, by James Hogg, you will know just how frightening that can be. Anyway, what have we got on the agenda this week? Well, I'm gonna be reading to you about among other things, soup, and the Pope. And probably some other things too,

Unknown Speaker  01:09

devoted listeners to hooting yd on the air. Know that we do our utmost to bring you the very very best in modern cutting edge soup recipes. And here is here is a new one. This is alphabet soup. The so if you've got pen and paper, take notes and you can make this view of tea ingredients. One pound each of apricot breadcrumbs, coleslaw, dandelions, Edelweiss stalks, flapjacks, and goldfish brains. six tablespoons of honey, two ounces of icing glass, one pound each of jack door feathers, ketchup, love lies, bleeding, marmalade, nugget and ox lips. One p, one tub of quicklime four ounces, each of raisins spikenard and toffee. 15 teaspoons of unspeakable glue, one family size catering pack of vinegar, three whelks, as much xanthine as you can stomach 12 packets of yeast and 44 zinnias from your garden.

method. Pound everything beginning with a Val into a mulch. Smear it onto the inside of a big bowl. Put the bowl somewhere safe and below freezing point for a week. Cut everything else up into chunks the size of a newborn baby's fist, then chargrill go and get the bowl and toss the trunks in haphazardly. Place the bowl under an outside spigot and filled to the brim with water. Leave to stand for as long as you like depending on how hungry you are transferred to a cauldron. Bring to the boil and allow to simmer. Pour in some milk, re boil indefatigably ladle the scum of the top serve with hibiscus clumps and cocoa. That recipe could possibly have appeared

a book by Dobson. And I'd like to tell you about that now but I'm just going to have a sip of tea. Dobson rarely sought collaborators in his pamphleteering work, preferring to plow his Pharaoh alone. Occasionally, however, his schemes were so ambitious that it was necessary to call in help. One such plan led to the formation of what became known as the soup committee. Dobson woke up one wintry morning with an idea in his head. This was not uncommon, but usually his ideas could be and were dashed off in a brief pamphlet. Not so the gigantic multi volume work he pictured in his mind, a compendium of every known Soup Recipe ever conceived throughout human history, from the dawn of time to that day's date across all cultures and civilizations. Even Dobson realized that he could not accomplish so mighty a project single handed, so he asked marigold Chu to draw up a list of likely contributors. The soup committee was horizon idea, reasoning that if she invited people to take part in a Dobson plan, they would probably decline and thus shatter the pamphlet is already shattered nerves. She used her usual hardline tactics. The letter she sent out to over 800 unsuspecting souls is preserved in the Dobson archive. This soup person it read, this is to inform you that you have been impaneled onto the soup committee. Your empowerment is effective from today's date and remains in force until such time as you die. The full implications of your membership of the soup committee will follow by separate post but you had better start gathering soup recipes right now. Yours decisively, marigold, two pp. Dobson the pamphleteer himself decided to begin by garnering soup recipes from the Old and New Testaments, and set about rereading his Bible with pencil and notepad in hand. He was distraught, at the end of this exercise, to discover that the word soup appears nowhere in the Authorized Version, or King James Bible, which was the addition he swore by. He went back to the beginning, and realized that pottage was possibly a synonym for soup, although it might also mean what we know as stew. undeterred, Dobson was able to fill a couple of pages of his Notepad. In Genesis 25, for example, we have 29 and Jacob Saad pottage, and Esau came from the field and he was faint. 30 and Esau said to Jacob, feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for I am faint, therefore was his name called Eden, and 34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils, and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way. Thus, Esau despised his birthright. This is elsewhere translated as, and Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, of course, a resounding phrase, we would all do well to remember. Moving on to the second Book of Kings, chapter four, after having soup for lunch, Dobson, read 38 and Elijah came again to Gilgal and there was a dearth in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said unto His servant, set on the great pot, and seize pottage for the sons of the prophets. 39 and one went out into the field to gather Herbes, and found a wild vine and gather their of wild gourd his lap fall, and cavemen shred them into the pot of pottage, for they knew them not.

Unknown Speaker  08:27
And finally, 40 so they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, oh, there man of God, there is death in the pot, and they could not eat their own love. Towards the end of the Old Testament, Dobson found one last mention of soup or stew, in hag guy, too. 12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt, do touch bread or pottage or wine or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy, and the priests answered and said, No. Seven versus seven mentions of pottage but presumably only three different soups, the most interesting to Dobson being the one in Kings which has death in the pot. What was this poisonous potion? We know that Dobson was a vain even arrogant pamphleteer, but he did have some small shred of humility. He recognized that if his great work on soup was to be definitive. Every single recipe would have to be authorized by an expert marigold to send a second letter to the members of the committee. Dear impaneled soup committee person she wrote matter of urgency. further detail is required on the wild golds, which was shredded into the pottage mentioned in two kings 439 as well as the ingredients already in the pot, which as you know, contained death. Send your reply by Korea, yours tenaciously marigold to PP Dobson Not a single one of the recipients ever applied. Dobson himself soon lost interest in soup recipes, filed his notes away and embarked that very same winter on a series of pamphlets about sodium postage stamps, the manufacturer of church bells, loosely fitting cardigans, gutta percha price fluctuations, and Plovdiv. One by one over the years, the soup committee members died out. It is thought that only three of them are still alive. One in Bostwick, one in Cleves, and one now 104 years old, fit as a fiddle plying a ferry across an inlet at an unidentified seaside resort. battered by gales battered by storms, battered by gales battered

Unknown Speaker  11:39
it's always worth keeping an eye on Hansard, the official record of parliamentary debate, because every so often among the blather, there's a spot of illumination. Here, for example, is an exchange from a few days ago. Mr. JOHN Randall, the Conservative MP for Oxbridge said the minister claim that the Labour government have been good for birds. What are their plans for cormorants? And Ben Bradshaw, the Minister replied cormorants are one of the species that have done extremely well in the past 20 years. Even if the maximum number of licenses were issued, the cormoran population would still be far higher than it was under the Tories. The idea that enfranchised cormorants and other birds would be natural labor voters. Reminds me of a long ago comment in the house Journal of countryside bloodlust in the field, where someone wrote, If foxes could hear all sides in the debate on hunting, I think they would vote solidly for its continuance. And a similar sentiment was expressed around the same time I think this is just post war. In a letter to the Sussex Express and county Herald where one of the readers wrote in to say, I am convinced that if a fox could vote, he would vote conservative.

Unknown Speaker  13:25
Well, I never Blairite them cormorants and, and and conservative foxes, whatever next.

Unknown Speaker  13:34
I told you I'd

Unknown Speaker  13:36
read something about the Pope. And of course the Pope has been ill, as we know. And there was a great headline in the Daily Mail Of course, that sober Journal of record. gasping Pope minutes from death, which ended up with with my old friend Max desharnais wrote to me from Berlin where he lives to say how this reminded him of those early 80s tabloid headlines which got used as punk song titles by the likes of the exploited city baby attacked by rats is one that max quotes and of course there is always that great. I think it was the Daily Mail which have the immortal must we fling this filth at our pop kids? Anyway, Max goes on in his letter to remind me of the the winning ways of an earlier Pope Eugenio pacelli, alias Pius the 12th. And this is what max writes, I recommend john Caldwell's fascinating book Hitler's Pope. The Secret History of Pius the 12th. Senior Petrelli seems to have been a humble chap. He ordered that anyone in the clergy who was on the other end of the telephone to him should kneel throughout the call. conversation. And the gardeners in his private garden were instructed to hide in the bushes as he went past so he wouldn't have to look at them. Having, of course sworn an oath of poverty, he drove around in a huge limousine with no chairs in the back, just a large throne. He also seems to have regarded himself as an expert on all manner of subjects. Excuse me, and Max goes on to quote from a great paragraph from the book by john Cornwell available in penguin. This is wonderful. If he showed if he being pious Pope Pius the 12th. If he showed signs of grandiosity, it was in his tendency to expatiate on an ever expanding range of topics. So numerous and so beyond his competence, when he specialized talks, or Allo confusions that the practice seemed symptomatic of ripening delusions of omniscience. He lectured visiting groups on subjects such as dentistry, gymnastics, gynecology, aeronautics, cinematography, psychology, psychiatry, agriculture, plastic surgery, and the art of news casting. A visitor to his study once remarked on the piles of fat manuals around his desk, Pat Kelly responded that he was preparing a talk on gas central heating

Unknown Speaker  17:00
and people who know everything well, this is a transcript of a lecture, a brief lecture, which was held a few days ago. It was held in held in a college where I'm not entirely sure who gave the lecture, but it was held in a college where I learned that down in the labs, there are scientists who play recordings of this project this very program to some small ants and beetles and funnel web spiders in the labs for no apparent purpose. Anyway, here is here is this lecture, which I have a transcript of. In today's lecture, we shall attend to both entrate ons and then trade on stubs in their quiddity and morass. Flora pad wrote that in the collapsing is the penta tour, and those words hidden away in a footnote, yet ring down the ages. I gasped you gasp he she or it gasps much gasping and not a little panting we got you plural gasp vague gasp that is what happens when we try to extricate floral pad from the entangled porcupine of the past. And it is fair to say that it must be so when we take account of the duty imposed upon us by our collegiate pangeran drums to sequester what is mad from what is made, that which is made in the brain or with the counted limbs. consider for a moment a wild hog irksome as it can be to propel one's mind towards the twinkling stars of the incumbency of hen memmott beings. It must be done with grace and with an attunement to planetary winds. Flora Pat himself says in conditions with slots being as great doing as a pearl and it is well to remember that in the teeth of reverie

And titans of the rubber basin doused in caustic soda and then burned in their burning unexpected petrochemical add validations in trained within a caddy, the helmet and the patent on the prong made to measure and in the sky. You may recall a shock that greeted proof copies of tema, rare the propulsion that flimsy pamphlet so widely read by movers and shakers in hock, to those who gather cowslips, the resonance of tumbling hobbyhorses etched on a pain unjoined dots, fantastic spore have mazeppa, Duluth and Banyan to name but three. From sand comes not sand from the planet metal affinities. The law of the Bob and the barbel west or east hands across some mental ocean tied in time and tucked in folds that mimic the integuments of a grosser dispensation. That is what we work for. That is why we work. That is why one by one we see each pinprick star brilliant in the ether, our horses unsaddled buckles valiant dust, no longer dust. It's some time possibly months even since we've heard about the adventures of tiny Enid. And here is a another tale of tiny Enid tiny Enid extinguishes a volcano. One windy September morning, tiny Enid read in her daily newspaper that a big volcano might be about to erupt. volcanology was not her strong point. But some of the comments quoted in the story made her sit up with a start. A number of scientists from organizations with befuddling acronyms said things like it looks like it will erupt soon and we have recorded volcanic activity. Tiny Enid scoured the paper to see if there were any other signs or portents, such as unusual locust swarm formations, but there were none. Yet her mind was made up, she packed a bag with pythons hammers, extra socks and a flask of her secret Alex here. She left instructions for the milk delivery person and the topia wrist and call the taxi. The taxi took her from her house to the railway station, where she boarded a train to the port from where a small boat rounded the coastline to that part of the land where there was an airfield. Tiny Enid had allowed her pilot's license to expire, so she paid a man with a decisive mustache and a flying cap to take the controls of the little two seater pangloss diesel plane and flew into the wild blue yonder, with gritted teeth,

Unknown Speaker  24:18
and blazing eyes. Tiny Enid never wore goggles when flying, she thought the most sign of moral dereliction. Tiny Enid never let a day pass without reading a few pages of the imitation of Christ by Thomas a campus. Indeed, she kept a ragged copy of this devotional classic in her bag at all times. It is true that the Augustinian monk has nothing to say on the subject of flying goggles, given that he was writing in the 1420s and it's hard for us to comprehend how tiny Enid arrived at her interpretation It is hard and also unwise, for no less than a dozen harmless souls have gone crackers trying to correlate the contents of tiny Enid brain. They languish now in places of shutter relinquishment. Although it is too tiny he needs credit that she pays for their keep including porridge for breakfast, and a nurse who mops their brows. Thomas a campus suggests in chapter 50, that, quote, the desolate man should place himself in God's hands and quote, and tiny Enid agrees, but she has to a sense of her responsibility. Although these 12 men tried to make sense of her cerebral fumes and vapors, uninvited, that does not stop her doing what she can for them. When the pangloss landed at the foot of the volcano, tiny Enid clambered out, she put on her extra socks and ascended the volcano using her pythons and hammers. When she reached the summit, she found a pair of parallel events in which molten magma was bubbling and boiling, ready to erupt, just like the scientists had said. She also saw a great deal of tephra in the form of rocks and cinders, ashes and dust, as if there had already been a mini eruption. pausing only to scan the sky for birds, tiny Enid extinguished the volcano using a technique she had read about in the Reader's Digest. Then she started on the long journey home whistling, and only a little muddy.

Unknown Speaker  27:28
One day after a huge breakfast ignatz fondo had a Total Eclipse of the Heart, just like that songstress whose name escapes me, Bonnie Tyler. Anyway, he did not look as if it was happening, indeed, To the untrained eye ignatz fondo looked as if he was asleep, rather than in the throes of convulsive emotional turmoil accompanied by strident rock music. Adding to this disjuncture was the fact that ignatz fondo resembled Clement Attlee down to the finicky little moustache and an inadvertent inadvisable line in hats. Nevertheless, when he went to his priest for confession the following Sunday, there could be no doubt about the upheavals of his passion. Bless me father for I have sinned. He pleaded as he knelt facing the grill behind which the priest sat clutching his rosary beads and wishing he was Montgomery Clift in I confess, I have had a Total Eclipse of the Heart. Let me stop you there my child murmur the priest. I have heard enough, say three our fathers for Hail Marys and one and the evil cradling by Brian Keenan. Now get you gone. Ignite founder left the confessional soon afterwards, so did the priest his own heart not so much in total eclipse as heavy with the weight of the fat black sins he had had to listen to all morning. Terrible, terrible Sins of impiety and vain glory and greed of abandonment and lust of twiddly Moog synthesizer, solos, rape and pillage and rack. He imagined each sin as a lump of lead, and he stuffed them all into a sack. It was a burlap sack tied up with a knot, and he hoisted it onto his back. His back was broad and his shoulders were strong, and he carried the sack through all day long, the sack of sins as black as his heart and then nightfall he tossed it onto a cart. He rained up his horse in the Milky moons glow And off he rode with the sack on McCart ignite, fanned out tossed and turned in his attic of sin with his Total Eclipse of the Heart. And that's all for this week. Frank key. We'll be back next week. Bye.
