Ahoy. My name is Frank key and this is hosting yard on the air. Ahoy is what Alexander Graham Bell used to say when he answered the telephone. And he invented it apparently, at the end of last week's show, I was in the middle of reading a piece called Total Eclipse. And I got we were ran out of time. And I got to a point where I thought this is okay, it can stop here. And none of you would have known that. You didn't hear the end of the piece. So I'm going to start this week with total eclipse again, it's not that long, and this time you get to hear the whole thing. One day, after a huge breakfast ignatz Fado had a Total Eclipse of the Heart, just like that songstress whose name escapes me, actually is Bonnie Tyler. I've remembered that now. He did not look as if it was happening. Indeed, To the untrained eye. ignatz Fado looked as if he was asleep, rather than in the throes of convulsive emotional turmoil accompanied by strident rock music. Adding to the disjuncture was the fact that ignatz Fado resembled Clement Attlee, down to that finicky little mustache and an inadvisable line in hats. Nevertheless, when he went to his priest for confession the following Sunday, there could be no doubt about the upheavals of his passion. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. He pleaded, as he knelt, facing the grill, behind which the priest sat clutching his rosary beads, and wishing he was Montgomery Clift in I confess, bless me, Father, for I have had a Total Eclipse of the Heart. Let me stop you there, my child, murmured the priest. I have heard enough, say three our fathers for Hail Marys and one and evil cradling by Brian Keenan. Now get you gone. ignatz Sandow left the confessional soon afterwards, so did the priest, his own heart not so much in total eclipse as heavy with the weight of the fat black sins he had had to listen to all morning. Terrible, terrible Sins of impiety and vain glory and greed, of abandonment and last of twiddly Moog synthesizer solos, right pine pillage and rack. He imagined each sin as a lump of lead, and he stuffed them all into a sack. It was a burlap sack tied up with a knot, and he hoisted it onto his back. His back was broad, and his shoulders was strong, and he carried the sack through all the day long, the sack of sins as black as his heart, and at night fall he tossed it onto a cart. He rained up his horse in the Milky moons glow, And off he rode with the sack on the cart. Ignite fondo tossed and turned in his attic of sin with his Total Eclipse of the Heart. Dawn came ignite, fanned out or woke refreshed. All sin washed away. A man who now was pure, far, far away on the road to the limekilns the priest with his horse and cart and sack full of sin had stopped to drink water from a stream. It was a pretty real, as if in a dream, the songstress appeared standing in the long grass, dressed in no longer fashionable glam finery. There was a sudden din Was it the music of the spheres as conceived in the mind of Brian May. The priest clapped his hands over his ears, his horse reared up in terror, and the burlap sack exploded. It's incandescence, vaporizing the sun, the blast almost as loud as the songstress in her band belting out her anthem. This much have I seen this much have I heard

Another thing that was on last week's show, which I'd like to return to, was about Dobson's book of soup. And during the in the piece dealing with Dobson's a bought of soup encyclopedia, I mentioned in passing the Old Testament book of Haggai. And this brief text is a favorite of mine. It mentions pottage, of course, which is always a good thing. But it also includes the phrase, he that Earth wages, Earth wages, to put it into a bag with holes. That's chapter one, verse six. I've always felt a pang of sympathy, sympathy for that man, whoever he may be. He's the only person in the Bible who carries a bag with holes. A bag so unlike the ones mentioned in Luke 1233 bags which wax not old, where no thief approach eth, neither month corrupt eth. Clearly the hag Iron Man has allowed maths to corrupt his bag, and that's why it has holes in it. And I can't help wondering if he's a little simple, this man to be putting his wages into a mafia bag. Perhaps he's a prototype of the holy innocence or the holy fool, that mythic figure which had such resonance in Czarist Russia, among other times and places, Rasputin certainly exploited the idea for all it was worth. And although there is no reliable account of him roaming the corridors of the Winter Palace, carrying a bag with holes, I like to think he did. At the end, of course, his assassins had such trouble doing him to death, that they shot him at least three times. So it's possible that any bag he had with him at the time, would have had a hole or holes caused by gunfire, even if it had escaped corruption by moths. To my knowledge, no one has yet pursued a close study of moth infestations in the czarist palaces. But if someone with the requisite scholarly background were to do so, we may learn something of importance. I'm not sure whether the moths lying in wait to feed on Rasputin his bag would have been all the moths or antler or Terminal B, Black Mountain, black v. Black veined broom, cabbage, Crimson speckled, Cynthia. December, do drinker. Ear early Emperor, fissures esterline Fox, garden pebble, Ghost, goat, great peacock Gypsy heart, Hornet, leopard, lobster, March. Mele, mouse. Maslin NetID mountain, near northern winter, November. All right, rash, orange, pale November, peppered PERS, Spanish moon, swallow tailed sweet Gale, turnip wax, white satin, or winter moths. And I would like to top lepidopterist with some knowledge of the fall of the Romanovs to tell me listeners should know that the bag of deceitful weights is not mentioned in hag guy, but can be found in the book of my car. 611 it would not surprise me to learn that Rasputin had such a bag. To given that he was a deceitful monk as well as the Mad Monk of legend, his bag of deceitful weights and bag with holes may have been one on the same, of course, a possibility which makes the brain real. This is the kind of historical conundrum that Dobson ought to have written a pamphlet about, but never did. If he had, we might be a little further away from bag quandary. And then little closer to bag truth.

Bag truth sounds like a Yoko Ono escapade. So the still small voice of common sense whispers in my ear, be silent now be silent.

Speaking of Dobson it's hard to credit but it was exactly 50 years ago today that Dobson the out of print pamphleteer made his one and only appearance on the radio. He was booked to appear on the then popular show bad gas and forts. A sort of uncategorizable hour of talk static and field recordings, hosted by an anonymous spook, known only as the gravel voiced ghoul. Dobson's participation was the result of a long campaign by marigold Chu, who spent months standing outside the producers office building, holding a flag and haranguing passers by to sign a petition. The producer had sworn an oath that Dobson would never appear on the show, apparently because of some otherwise forgotten incident involving a rowing boat and a flock of bitterns. marigold Chu was eventually able to prove that the oath contravened the ancient law of civil and persuasive and D bailing, and it was struck down by magisterium bossa nova in Chancery. The show itself was broadcast live, and no recording was made. However, by pasting together the shreds of a hastily scribbled transcription, it's possible to get some idea of what took place. The gravel forest ghouls first guest was an elderly writer who had defected from the Soviet Union. In the immediate post revolutionary period, he had written a series of heartwarming tales about a peasant family under the title, little yogurt on the tundra. With the suppression of the two lakhs, and under pressure from the common turn, he rewrote these works as little foundry on the collective farm. If the transcript is reliable, the remarks he made were punctuated by loud hammering noises, possibly something like that. After about 10 minutes, the gravel voiced ghoul introduced, Dobson asked to continue the theme of cloying Family Centered storytelling. The pamphleteer embarked on a lengthy anecdote about the books his mom read to him as a child. Here, as far as can be pieced together is what he said. I'm going to read now from the transcript. My mom was a huge fan of detective fiction. So my bedtime stories tended to be whatever she was reading at the time. One of her favorites was Dorothy sleet, who wrote a series of who done it, featuring Rex shroud, oratory sleuth. shroud was a sleuth, all of whose cases involved in Arry at some point in the story. What is that hammering noise? Anyway, sleep created one of the classic detectives I think he may not be quite on a par with MP shields, Prince molesky. But she put a lot of thought into giving the oratory sleuth all sorts of idiosyncrasies to make him a memorable and fully rounded character. Not just a solver of puzzles. He has a false lung to many teeth, and is a daily practitioner of Baxter ism. his lantern is ruby red. At moments of high desperation, he will invariably fiddle about with a little tin of talcum powder. He keeps blotting paper in his pocket, and that hammering is really getting on my nerves. Perhaps the best story Dorothy sleep ever wrote was the Arry sleuth, and the pod people from the weird parallel world out of time and space. You think you're reading science fiction, but that's just narrative pyrotechnics? It is I think, both valiant and boisterous as the best prose always tries to be.

She was a woman of baleful countenance, Dorothy sleet, and kept many tortoises in her seaside bungalow. She married four times, and each of her husband's vanished on accountably. The first three simply vaporized in the kitchen while making omelets. And the fourth was last seen in Ireland in the vicinity of the wobbling Virgin of balance spittle. And that's the end of the transcript. Because at this point, the hammering noise is drowned out Dobson. And by the time they stopped, the show had come to an end and listeners were treated to a concert by Xavi a to gatt and his orchestra. Dobson never received a fee for his appearance. And then some years later, he and the gravel voiced ghoul past each other in the street. They did not acknowledge each other.

And what I like about today's show is that it's kind of flowing, you know it flows because each piece leads beautifully into the next one. This for example, is about Dorothy sleet and her fictional detective Rex shroud. Arry sleuth, because sadly, it came to my attention that not a single one of these tremendously exciting detective novels is still in print. And this is all the more puzzling when one learns that the Broadway show based on the books is breaking box office records. The plot of Arry sleuth the musical cobbled together incidents from the first three novels, with certain episodes from Dorothy sleeps life. Like Agatha Christie, she wants disappeared for a few weeks and was found in a seaside boarding house. Like Adolphe Hitler, she took seven sugars in her tea. Like the wild boy of Avalon. She shrieked when her potatoes were taken away from her. Like James Joyce, she hid underneath tables during thunderstorms. Like William you at Gladstone, she reduced from the works of Homer that all Ancient Greeks were colorblind. Like Pope Pius the 12th, she gave lectures on gas central heating, like heady Lamarr, she made a decisive scientific contribution that helped to win the Second World War. And like Alfred Hitchcock, she was frightened of eggs. And it's this last point that explains perhaps the scene in Act Two of the musical where Rex shroud the Arry sleuth, finds himself trapped in a little shed completely surrounded by hens. The menacing atmosphere is heightened by the music, a slow brooding theme on woodwinds, accompanied by the chorus, delivering a dirge about feathers, and then brilliantly the scene segues into a tap dancing extravaganza, and the show's hit number. I am an early sleuth, encircled by hens, which is of course a nod to chapter 16 of Antarctic death paste the second novel in the series. Tickets for the show are very hard to get. And they're changing hands for ridiculous prices on the Arry sleuth Bay website. animal rights activists should note that none of the hands which appears in the musical is a real bird. Some of them are electronic robots, some are made of plasticine, and the ones nearest the front of the stage, a construct of sponge and wire and string.

Now, having said excuse me, having said that the show was flowing, actually yeah, hens, eggs hens. This is eggs, hens, ducks. Yes, that works. Okay. This is a quotation from a book entitled A Short History of monks and monasteries. by Alfred wisely wizzart. Two monks took the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week. This they put into a file, one side of which consisted of a thin transparent crystal, the other thick and opaque. The Dark Side was shown until the sinners gold was exhausted. When presto change, the blood appeared by turning the other side of the file. innumerable toe pairings, bones, pieces of skin, three heads of St. Ursula and other anatomical relics of departed saints was set to cure every disease known to man. Now, that phrase to monks took the blood of a duck was appropriated by the poet Dennis beer pint as the title of a lengthy as yet unpublished work. It may be that he's still writing it, but my regular beer pint watcher who sends me information on what he's up to Dan sprawl, is currently in hospital with a case of jangling Kevin pag. So news is limited. What we do know is that the prose poem, beer pint prose poem, compares the images of monks draining blood from a duck with the concept of being washed in the blood of the Lamb. And here is a very brief extract. Remember, is a prose poem. Then brother Fabricius strangled another tale? Hand me that retort brother our pad so that I may decant into it this TEALS gore brother Arpad reached for the retort, and in so doing smashed an Olympic. There was the sound of bells. The monks were called to compline. For each canonical hour, they allocated a duck to be slaughtered for its blood at compline a tail at matins, a merganser. At prime, a pin tail, at tears, a shoveler. At sext a widgeon. At known as a smooth and that Vespers, a bufflehead. out in the fields, sweet little lambs, gambled and frolicked. They would not frolic for long for soon in the monastery, it would be bath time.

bloodthirsty wasn't it sacrificial lambs and ducks. So let's continue the theme. That's what we're doing this week. Last Friday thursday friday, possibly Saturday, I'm not sure. With Tanis Deanna and here is what to do. Get a pig's head and place it on top of a stone. This will protect you from thunder and lightning. When you've done that, go to your nearest pigpen. Leaning on the fence sing songs in celebration of the fertility of pigs. If you do not know any such songs, make one up. After lunch, bury the rest of the pig whose head is a top of the stone except for its feet. You will probably have eaten the head and the feet for lunch with or without a garnish. Make sure you refrain from needle work all day. And don't drink when you are at home. Keep an eye on the weather. If it's foggy, start gathering sandbags for soon there will be floods at all times. Bear in mind that you are in ancient Latvia and that today is Tanis Deanna the sacred pig holiday.

Well, well well, holy, some sacrificial animals. I think it's all a bit worrying, isn't it? So I think what we should do, is is ended the show this week. With something more life affirming, more life affirming, life after death, in fact, and this is a quotation again, not from not from Mr. wis heart, this is from a Wallis budge. And his book Egyptian ideas of the future life and he wrote as follows. Behold, teta hath arrived in the height of heaven. And the hand memmott beings have seen him the same cat at boat know with him, and it is teta who sailed with it. And the man check boat call it under him and it is tetteh who bring it to a standstill. teta has seen his body in the same ketut boat. he knoweth for your rayas which is in the Manchester boat. And God has called him in his name and has taken him in to raw. And with that, with that thought of raw. I shall leave you for this week. And I'll be back next week hopefully with a less blood drenched show. But at least hopefully at least one mention of Yoko Ono whose birthday it was last week.
