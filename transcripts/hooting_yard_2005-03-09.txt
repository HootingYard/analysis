Hello,

Unknown Speaker  00:17
it's it's for four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, which means it's hooting out on the air with me, Frank key. I wasn't here last week. I didn't feel very well. And I am here this week and I'm feeling very miserable and fell up and I'm sure that you wanted to know that in this in a new carry Sherry world where we'll talk about our feelings all the time anyway. Enough of that rubbish and onwards and on with. This is a piece called in a bog in a bug, we find Blodgett. we steal upon him when he does not expect us. He is floundering in the bog, a clumsy giant. One of us says, Blodgett, you have mud in your beard. Blodgett feigns not to hear. He puffs and grunts as he splutters bits of dried mud fall out of his beard. How long have you been in that bog Blodgett, we asked in unison. Now Blodgett scowls. His spectacles are mysteriously a gleam in spite of the muck in which he wallows. He does not reply. With great groans, he hosts himself almost to his feet, before falling back into the bog with a mighty splash. Now there is some mud on his spectacles to blog dritte Blodgett, there's mud on your spectacles, we sing to a little tune we have devised for such an occasion. This causes Blodgett to growl he sounds like a hog. we toss in one end of a rope. Desmond ties the other end of the rope to the trunk of a nearby nearby Sycamore. Blodgett pull yourself out of the bog using the rope, we cry. None of us can remember the rest of our tune. Blodgett hat has fallen off his head. He tries to wipe the mud off his spectacles with a fat finger, but only makes a smudge. Clouds scub across the sky, they are black and bring rain. Poor Blodgett flops around in the bog. He does not use our rope, for he does not know we are there. No matter how loud we shout his name, he cannot hear us. Even if his spectacles were smudged, he could not see us. We are always here at the edge of the bog through days and nights in every season of the year. But we are tiny children, and we are ghosts. And I'm following that with a piece that was in the book and this is at the hop. After clambering out of the bog Blodgett went to a hop, it was free of ghosts. Blodgett dancer who char with a bewitching floozy, she literally bewitched him using her turquoise earring magnets. For the next three weeks Blodgett was under her spell. She took him to the harbor and put him on a boat. It was a steam packet. They went on a voyage North until they encountered pack ice. The bewitching floozy, was skilled in the Mariners art, but even she poo pooed pack ice, they turned back and sail for home, and the hop. Blodgett in his intransparent had been commanded to keep the ship's log, and as they came into the harbor, the floozy snatched it from his hands, and with a twist of one turquoise earring magnet, she released him from her spell. They walked arm in arm from the harbour to the hop, and they danced the night away. Blodgett remembered nothing. He was astonished years later, passing through the town near the bog. To find it in a charm berry bargain bin, the ship's log in his distinctive curlicued handwriting. He bought it and took it home or put it on his mantelpiece were gathering dust was a fading snapshot of the floozy in her turquoises rings and her cloth hat. This is an exciting piece of detective fiction called the stench from outer space. Or maybe it's an exciting piece of science fiction Who knows? The stench from outer space? Detective Captain pond bed was a worried man. He flung himself into an armchair his pipe clenched between his jaws, then called out for mungo is factotum. Within seconds at all impossibly handsome fellow strode confidently into the detective study. Fetch me some bolts of wood wrapped pond bed to this rain mill and to know shore at once master sniffle mango before adding, you know, you're becoming as irritable as so Dennis Neyland Smith in the food and True Stories by sacks Roma. You want to take up a sport? I've heard it said that the Pang Hill bobsled team is looking for a new recruit. Pump bed almost bit the stem of his pipe into before shouting something unprintable at his servant, who had already glided out of the room. It was Thursday morning, and the weather outside was spectacular and frightening. By the time mango returned an hour later with a balsa wood crate packed with hundreds of sticks of balsa wood. Detective Captain pond bed had completed a pencil drawing of Mary Jo Capeci, who died at Chappaquiddick, thereby destroying the political career of Ted Kennedy. pond bed had begun the drawing some months earlier, but he was nothing if not a perfectionist, a trait he'd inherited from his mother, who he recalled with a curious admixture of fondness and regret, had been known to arrive at railway stations with more than four days to spare before the departure of her train in order to familiarize herself with the shift patterns of the Tea Room person's. The angle of the detectives hat caused mango concern, and he stooped over to straighten it. As he did so. pond bed grabbed the balsa wood crate. What is that hideous screeching noise mungo asked pond bed, his pallid face screwed into prune like wrinkles. The factotum looked out of the window. Oh, it's just one of the local hubballi hoys tormenting voles. He said, At that moment, there was a monstrous flash of lightning and a spacecraft landed outside the town swimming balls directly across the road. The spacecraft was one of those very smelly ones. The noise it made as it came into land was so loud, but pond beds spilled the sticks of balsa wood all over his recently shampooed carpet. confound these pesky alien interlopers, he wrapped, mango took the pencil drawing and pinned it to the wall above the fireplace. The invasion of Earth had begun in earnest. Here are three extracts from the book of NATS

so was a tempest loosed upon the city, and its very fabric uprooted from the mud was whirling and howling for city was dispersed upon the firmament, coming to arrest, none knew where and the mud spawned all manner of knowing. Some pests, squirming and wriggling to escape the gigantic puddles which were left in the wake of the storm. These were not puddles of water, no, nor of any liquid known to the human mind. And then my eyes saw standing fiery on a wooden plinth ringed by scum pools, the obscene figure of a vincula man. In his left hand he brandished a loft a scrap of burning linoleum. His right hand was made into a fist, and as dribbling I watched, the fist was slowly opened to reveal. I cannot say I do not know. For just at the moment my piercing watery eyes would have seen that bat thing. I was startled by a toad, which leapt up at my face and slapped me on the forehead, leaving an imprint which remains there to this day, like a brand.

Unknown Speaker  11:10
To the man with the toad Mark flapped his shattered wings in vain in vain, perched on the rock, beaten by harsh winds encrusted with seaweed, sightless, he was of a sudden assaulted by a voice roaring at him across 1000 continents. Man with the mark of the toad, no yeva song of the boll weevils, then sing dammy sing. whence came that monstrous voice? What hideous nursery had cosseted its owner what kitchen fed it man with a mark of the toad. It screamed again, pulverizing universe's hair up to me now, leave your drab rock, shed your cracked wings, sprout fins, smack the boiling sea with your flippers come to me. I hold in my now now hold hands, many gifts for you. I hold and conical bowls. I hold strangled curlews I hold pods and gum and pitch blend, spring forward now, go from your perch. I hold magnification instruments, Coddington lenses and towels for you. I hold pigeons blood crayons and Ising glass. The crayons are of colors no human eye could ever contemplate. The eyes in glass gleams and a charming handmade jar. The jar has your mark upon it man with the mark of the toad. Come. There were hours upon hours of this wretched jibberish enough to make an end die. The man with the toad Mark beat his useless wings against the wind and turned his head away. his brow was crawling with knots. The knots had come a long way from barely imaginable puddles of slop, where once a city had stood the city of Nath

three, ving Coleman strode importantly through the boulevards of the walled city. He kept trinkets and baubles to beggars and cripples holding a vermilion cravat over his nose as he did so. Worms slithered up his dainty anklets, only to be torn away by scruffy love ridden flunkies. imposing but haphazard winckelmann relied upon his most trusted attendant to lead him in the right direction. These boulevards all looked alike to him. He could be going anywhere where it not for Cygnus mundos genius. As a servant, he was a treasure. Safe is inexplicably habit of pissing on coinage, cigarettes, Mundo was faultless. In this world of pestilence streets, he knew precisely what to do, turn right by the trough. Ignore the screeching plaque artists beat the peddlers insensible with their own clubs smartly avoid the motorbikes. Before long, vinkle man and his retinue stood in the courtyard of the impossibly huge building. The stink was repellent but vincula new etiquette if he knew nothing else. With an effort, he removed the cryovac from his nose, and as a signal from Cygnus Mundo pushed an envelope stuffed full of flies into the grubby hand of the waiting Sergeant at Arms. A ludicrous ballet of bows and scrapes took place. Cygnus Mundo taking photographs the while. After what seemed like hours, vincula man was ushered into an inner chamber. His attendant was not allowed to accompany him. Without his trusted lackey at his side. vinkle manner was a little nervous, but his discomfiture did not last long. No more than 15 seconds passed before he was greeted by his hosts, a swarm of gigantic gnats whose thrashing wings knocked finkelman mercifully unconscious before they devoured him, every last bit of him, grinding him to dust between their powerful biting drawers. It was over in a flash, then buzzing and tagging, the swarm left the chamber as it had entered through a shoot through a shoot through a shoot.

Unknown Speaker  16:57
Here's another old story, very old story. Almost like a like an ancient, ancient folk tale. This is the Massacre of the Innocents at hoon. splattered with seagull droppings. The woman of twigs stood at the very edge of the cliff her back to the sea. barefoot, she rocked gently back and forth on her impromptu podium. The villagers were gathered about her wretched and sniffling some carried pitchforks or dainty little tin boxes full of bit. They were all ears as they waited for the woman of twigs to speak. She had blinded pode she had blindfolded herself, with a threadbare bandage, bound her hair into tuft with flax and yarn and roots, and held in her hands a ribbon of bloody silk, precisely at the moment that the 1,000th wave of the day crashed against the rocks below. The woman of twigs, ceased her rocking, cast the ribbon to the winds and shouting to make herself heard over the screeching goals began. You asked me to save your village from doom. I have communed with a variety of weird and tiresome shades to seek guidance. You are correct. Your village is imperiled. There is only one way to rescue it from the coming agony three of your number must travel many miles distant to the town of Hoon, there, they must find a churn possibly broken the churn of Hoon, which has had engraved upon it a likeness of myself. Do not ask why, having scoured Hoon for this churn and found in Hoon, this churn of Hoon, it must be brought back here with Drew haste and hold into the boiling sea from this very spot on the Cliff's edge. That task complete your village will once again known glee. I have left on mentioned one crucial point for three who will venture to Hoon there to find and return the Hoon churn must all be called Ned. That is all. Work began at once on building the chariot. In the kitchens the villages boiled up huge iron pans full of mud and silt dredged from the riverbed. trees were felled in the spinny. The Smithy and his Advil beat out a goodly number of nails, spikes and very sharp hooks. Within a week, the foul smelling but indestructible vehicle was ready. Volunteers fanned out across the countryside to trap a suitable beast of burden. Horses, oxen, even a cripple reindeer of great elegance was cited and stalked, but another week elapsed. without success. Eventually it was decided that the three Ned's would have to travel under their own steam pulling the chariot by themselves. Ned, Ned and Ned agreed, drooling with excitement in their eagerness to set out on so glorious a journey, one that would save their village and bring them renown. They left the village at a gallop in the middle of the night. Without maps, they really thought they relied entirely on local law and superstition. from infancy each Ned had been imbued with a long Catechism of saws and Proverbs. Now, each had engraved upon his skull, a different couplet handed down through the generations. If you wish to go to Hoon, spit three times and follow the moon hoons beyond young crumbled hedge, hemmed around by Gorsuch and sage. When you see a pebble strewn your eight days and nights from Hoon travelled without pause to dragging the stinking chariot, while a third lay bundled in it sleeping or feeding from a polythene bag full of curdled slops. First followed the course of the great frightening river until suddenly wormed its way underground. For 18 months they traveled through a desolate landscape. Flat gray, and curiously redolent of shirred. But as they end Oh, sorry, little mistake there.

Unknown Speaker  21:53
I'll be in that sentence again, though that, but as they entered hoons hinterland things changed. in rapid succession. They passed and asbestos works. a barrel of rainwater a customer's post damp Hector's elk encampments, fence posts, grotesque wooden carvings, horrifying shrubbery, improbable water tables, Jerry built huts, a kailyn quarry, lumps of disgust monstrous gulches nebulous stretches of pointed brambly things, ornithologists hideaways, parakeet enclosures, quarantine sheds, Rusk markets, strange gobbets of sludge, a tremendous farmyard urn burials a vacuum wrestling pythons extravagant banks of yellow fog, yeast traffickers and a zipper crushing factory, Ned said to Ned and Ned soon we shall be in Hoon, I can feel it in my water. He was not mistaken. The great South Gate of Hoon was over 1000 years old and completely overgrown by clumps of hideous fleshy foliage, oozing poisonous SAP. All attempts to destroy this abominable vegetation had met with failure, and it had not been possible to open the gate for at least 200 years. Rather than blasting a hole in the town wall, a ramshackle lift contraption was knocked up close by two wooden platforms. One either side of the Great Wall were raised and lowered by an exciting system of pistons pulleys and winches, operated by a team of gatekeepers wearing boa constrictor masks. In return for their labors, they exacted a hefty price. Unfortunately, the three Ned's were utterly panelists. muttering among themselves, our heroic trio decided to proffer gifts in lieu of payment. Ned offered the gatekeepers his cap, which was made of rusted whisks. Ned presented them with a sick toad. He had been pampering for the past month, and Ned gave them a handful of silt scraped from the underside of the chariot. well pleased with these superb gifts, the gatekeepers allowed the exhausted threesome to clamber onto the platform. Two days later, the three Ned's were lowered to the ground on the other side of the wall. At last they were in hoon. Finding the possibly broken churn of Hoon could only be a matter of time. They would be implacable ferreting into every corner of the ancient town. And then they would find the churn Hoon and return and save their village. As soon as they disembark from the wooden platform, they were set upon by a whirling tangle of rough Ian's, who bashed them senseless, stole the shirts off their backs, empty their polythene bags of slops into the gutter. Holy dismantled the chariot, had at them with ferocious scimitars and left them for dead. And indeed, Ned and Ned were dead. Named was carted off by a passing stretcher patrol, but panted his last breath. An hour later, by which time the ruthenians had scampered away, heading for the mountains. They stopped by the kale inquiry to eat their packed lunches. And then, as night came down, they strolled up the mountain side, these ruffins their gaze is fixed on the sky above, to look at the number of stars to view the boundless firmament.

There's something about the main net isn't there. This next piece also features someone called Ned, you'll be pleased to know. And it's called the Swiss Family Robinson. Just have a sip of tea and then I'll read it to you and that will be the last piece for this week. Have you ever met someone from Switzerland named Robinson? Someone named Robinson from Switzerland who's been shipwrecked. I have I was sitting in a coffee bar in old grimy town up north. And as I sipped my cocoa and leave through yesterday's copy of the old grimy town Gazette in walked fat head and poopy Robinson, and their children, Ned gristle and sawdust. They sat at my table. We have a Swiss Family, Robinson said fat head. We are from Switzerland, and we were shipwrecked. I looked at them one by one trying to see evidence of their ordeal. When was this? I asked. Our years ago, said poopy Robinson. We were rescued by a big boat of birds. A boat of birds? I asked. Yes, said Ned. It was a big boat. And there were no humans aboard it. Only birds, starlings and chaffinches and buntings and wagtails and corncrakes and linnets and sparrows and swans. Ah, was a swan the captain? I asked. Yes, said Ned. How did you guess? I fixed him with my one working I sipped the dregs of my cocoa and stood up saying nothing. I swept out of the coffee bar and went straight home to write in my diary. Today, I met the Swiss Family Robinson, I wrote, and then I put down my pencil, and I became tearful thinking about swans imperiled on the high seas, and my parrot Lascelles who yearned for Columbia where he was born on a bright summer day, so many many years ago.
