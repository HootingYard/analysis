Good afternoon This is hooting yard on the air with me, Frank key. I've been away for a few weeks. So there's been lots of repeats. But now I'm back. I might have to go away again fairly soon I might go to Rome. I read, to my surprise that you don't have to be a cardinal to be the new pope. Apparently, any male adult Catholic is eligible. And I was brought up as a Catholic. So it struck me that I might go to Rome hang out with the Conclave, and you know, state my case. And traditions are dying. I think in the Catholic Church. One tradition that they've overlooked was that apparently all previous Pope's, in order to make sure that they had gone to heaven. Some official of the Vatican would hit the day the pope on the head, on the forehead, I think with a special hammer three times to check that he was dead. It does strike me that if the pope wasn't already dead, three hammer blows to the head may kill him. Anyway, they didn't do that. On this occasion. Apparently, they just used various modern techniques. But enough of all this so this could be my last show before you know becoming the What is it? The Vicar of Christ? Will we'll see what happens. This is called in loopy cops. In loopy cops when I was young, all golden were the shrubs and trees. All golden I remember them and bunkers Maisie from the farm. Maisie was unkempt and mad, just like her brother and her dad. Her sister left them long ago, she went to join a music hall. She made it as a chorus girl. And then she graced the silent screen. She looked like Edna purviance and had a hat named after her. But bonkers Maisie never did, for she was always dressed in rags. The Golden trees of loopy cops in those blue summers long ago. I remember them with Whoa, as I sit here twirling my moustache. My bow is such that I may sob and mop my tears with my jacket cough. But both my cuffs are smeared with grease. I dip them in the soup tureen I don't know why. I don't know when I don't know who knocks at my door. This bond hotel has stale air. The other guests are rakes and flops. I'm sitting in my rocking chair, recalling the gold of a loopy cops.

One of the things I did while I was away other than think about becoming Pope was I caught up on my reading. And I'd like to share some of that with you now. Just the the the content the synopsis of the contents of a book called life in 1000 worlds by the Reverend Ws Harris. This was originally published exactly 100 years ago in 1905 by the mentor company in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the Reverend Ws Harris was also the author of sermons by the devil and a book called Mr. World and Miss church member. neither of which I've read. However, this is the this is the synopsis of the contents of life in 1000. worlds. Marvelous book, I think someone should republish it. 100 years old. Chapter one. Are there more worlds than one? Why are countless worlds swinging in the endless regions of space? The author believes that 1000s are inhabited by intelligent beings. Chapter Two, a visit to the moon a description of a novel city of over 60,000 Moon Knights. The inhabitants of the moon are described as dwarves having no noses because they live by eating solid air. They're odd houses, expressive paintings, strange religion, wonderful history, novel government, happy home life, etc. Interestingly described chapter three, a visit to Mars. Mars is described as giants needing four arms, the ultimate results of capitalistic oppression graphically portrayed by a curtain system. The description of the Mars light curtain system embodies a tremendous thrust at monopolistic trusts, and should be read by Americans by the millions, the author captured by Mars men. Chapter Four, a glimpse of Jupiter. Jupiter writes described as colossal giants evering, averaging 25 feet in height, their language a marvel of simplicity far surpassing the English language. What dhrupad right can see with their powerful magnifying lenses, the author looked through their largest telescope and saw sailing ships in New York City harbor. Chapter Five beautiful satin physical features. Woman the ruling genius excursions in airships, marvelous language music, churches on Saturn far better than those on Earth. Chapter Six, the nearest fixed star. The inhabitants of alpha Centaurus, live as comfortably in fire as Earth heights living air or fishes in water. One of their aerial fire carriages described chapter seven, the water world visited. I stress that has nothing to do with Kevin Costner on spezza that people live in water about as fishes do on Earth. their homes and cities underwater described fishing for land animals. Some of their inventions far surpassed those of our own world. Chapter Eight tore to a far more beautiful world than ours, the moral life of taught to the cleanest found in any world, and interesting reasons given chapter nine a problem in political economy on air as the inhabitants live on liquid air, and hence have neither noses nor lungs. monopolists control liquid air on air s as petroleum is controlled on Earth. method of breaking up the power of monopolies. This chapter is worth reading by millions of American men and women. Chapter 10 floating cities, palaces and large cities built on water. A number of wonderful inventions described far surpass our world in reform movements.

What you should know about the carpenters Karen played the drums and sang her brother Richard played keyboards and supplied backing vocals. Unfortunately, Karen died young Richard is still alive, still active in music, but the carpenters as a judo are no longer with us. These bare facts stated, astute listeners will note the remarkable similarities between the carpenters and the home and mimic the carpenters who were so successful during the 1970s with songs such as close to you and calling occupants of interplanetary craft. Neither of these songs were was recorded by the carpenters of whom we speak, for their music was somewhat different. A new tri blend of salsa, bluegrass, acid jazz bell ringing and caterwauling, often driven by motorized electric balalaika is programmed by Karen. Richard was known to be fond of factory Hooters. Their debut album, the carpenters play the music of James last from an abandoned salt mine includes the astonishing six minute dying be music number eight, which featured guests including Blodgett, Blodgett dentist, Blodgett, dentist, dentist, and a young impressionable Scottish lad called major your sales were few and a booking on a transatlantic cruise liner proved ill advised. Neither Kara nor Richard could swim, and when the ship sank off the Auckland islands, they spent six weeks marooned in a dingy fighting. Some say Karen's health problems stemmed from this ordeal, and they wait may well be right. But in the words of the old farmyard, saying, never put two carpenters in the same dingey. There Annus Mirabilis was probably 1975. In a nine month period, they released no less than 26 APS, each of which was conceived as a punitive retrenchment to use Richards phrase. Karen scoffed at this description Incidentally, preferring to think of these matchless works as lullabies for locust swarms. The most startling thing about the records is the pared down instrumentation. Karen thumping the soul of her boot on a giant drum, Richard, tentatively prodding the black keys on a plastic toy piano. Both of them sang, of course, or rather harmed gargled and choked. After Karen topping from a radio mast in 1981, Richard approved the release of just one further recording a set of minuets bagatelles and M pars arranged for brass band, and an electronically enhanced flock of chaffinches. Karen's drumming had been recorded pneumatically in the clinic, where she spent her final years, sitting slumped on a catbird seat, wrapped in a gaudy and enormous Poncho, which engulfed her tiny wasted body. We attempted to interview Richard for this short piece, but his people sent our people an email saying that he was far too peevish

news of Dobson now or not news, so much as an anecdote. Dobson was afraid of squirrels. Here's why. It was a damp and ruinous Thursday, and he had not had any breakfast. He slapped his hand on the table and shouted, I must have marmalade I must have some marmalade. There was nobody to hear his complaint, except for an ant, which was making its way across the floor of his hovel, and the ant didn't care being an insect. Dobson had not even noticed the end. In any case, he leaped out of his chair, put on his big reindeer hide anorak brought back from one of his Arctic expeditions, and trudged outside, muttering now instead of shouting. Have I ever told you that there were several important trees on the path outside Dobson's door, there was a sycamore and they you a large and a pine. Dobson was fond of trees, usually, although he was unable to tell the difference between them. Gone were the days when he would festoon his hair with fallen leaves and twigs, inviting ridicule from the local whippersnappers in the days of which I speak, Dobson had adopted a sober mean, indeed a gloomy one. Dobson Dobson don't look so dismayed. His acquaintances would say To which the out of print pamphlet his response was to look heavenward as if in great pain, adopting the era of an early Christian martyr, one lined up for some particularly bloodthirsty persecution. Dobson often skim through the pages of foxes Book of Martyrs to pick up tips. But I digress. On this damp marmalade less morning, Dobson walked past the sycamore, the U, the large and the pine on wood past a repulsive ditch, past the post office and the pig hearts and our rat pit and the Viper's nest, and the glue factory up the lane towards the big unexplained building on the hill. The wind how it always did. Back in the hovel. The aunt had vanished into a crevasse in the wainscot justice Dobson arrived at the gates of the building. These gates were enormous and forbidding, and strange and Rusty and locked and bolted and unnecessary. For there was a wooden door set in the base and setting the base and brick wall which skirted the building. And it was only a few feet away to the left of the gates, or to the right. I cannot remember precisely, I've never been there myself. I'm only reporting this as it was told to me by marigold true on the day after Dobson's death, after she had had her bath, and was sipping tea from an inelegant tin mug, in the shabby parlor of a horrible, horrible hotel, hard by the banks of the river wretched insubordinate web share. Dobson knew all about the wooden door. So why did he tarry by the strange rusty gates? Was he confused? Was his mind a jumble due to lack of marmalade? Or did he have a tryst? We do not know. We do know that Dobson stood at those gates on that damp Thursday, peering intently through them for a full quarter of an hour before turning around and heading off to old jack blockheads foodstuffs tent, where he bought a jar of marmalade and some pastry and a pot of some kind of edible paste, which old jack blockhead had left and labeled. The year was 1952. Dobson and the vendor of foodstuffs had the usual argument about the pamphleteers promissory note, a page torn from his notebook on which he had scrawled words to the effect that sooner or later he would do right by old jack blockhead. And if he did not, then May the heavens smite him and make all his days be leavened with Whoa.

It was advantageous for Dobson that old jack blockhead was a man of great charity and puny intellect, and after a few minutes, he left the 10th through its great grimy flaps. Armed with his jar and pot and a paper bag for the pastry. They would not fit into the single pocket of his anorak, so he carried them in his ungloved on mittened hands. What pangs led Dobson back to the strange enormous rusty gates of the big unexplained building on the hill. There was a fallen log, a log fallen from a trembling Poplar, slap bang next to the gates and Dobson sat on it and ate the pastry, and he stayed sitting there despite the fact that it began to rain heavily. He didn't even bother to pull up the hood of his anorak, although that may be because it was rife with holes made by starving moths, and his head would have got wet anyway. Wet but surely not as wet as it did get as he sat on the poplar log in the downpour eating pastry with his pot of paste and marmalade jar beside him outside the forbidding and strange and Rusty and locked and bolted gates of the big unexplained building on the hill on that Thursday morning in 1952 when he first became terrified of squirrels why I asked marigold Chu as she sipped her tea in the shabby hotel parlor. Why did Dobson become so fearful of squirrels on that particular morning? She glanced at me briefly, and I was disconcerted by the weird look in her eyes. Those bushy tails she began, then fell silent, turning to stare out of the window. I followed her gaze and saw the Grave Digger walking across the lawn, toting his spade jauntily over his shoulder. Those bushy bushy tails marigold to repeated. She drank the rest of her tea, put the mug down on the floor by her feet and stood up. I must go and have a few words with the Grave Digger, she said. And she swept out of the room, as breezily as a bereaved woman on crutches can sweep brazenly from a hotel parlor on the day after the death of her one true friend on this magnificent and baffling planet.

If you've got a Pepsi goal, it's extremely important to ensure that it gets the requisite amount of exercise. Have you got any idea how dangerous is for a seagull to become idle and listless? Many seabirds doctors have over the years been driven to despair by the negligence of certain people who keep seagulls as pets. One such medic, whose name by weird coincidence is a perfect anagram of Oct. Turn Guillemot gal has written a memoir in which he lambasts, some of the feckless seaside resort inhabitants whose goals he came to tend his languages at times violent, but what shines through the prose is a great love for seabirds, and an almost pathological loading of human beings. In an appendix, the doctor recommends certain exercises which the responsible goalkeeper ought to encourage a bird to perform as part of its fitness regime. mindful of the depressed economies of most coastal regions, all of the exercises are designed to cost little in the way of kit. For example, gal exercise number 10, which I'm about to read to you, involves nothing more than access to a limitless supply of corrugated cardboard. This then is goal exercise number 10. fetch a few. Excuse me, fetch a few large sheets of corrugated cardboard and take them to your seagull, announcing a loud voice that you will reward the bird with a bucket of fish heads and trails. If it tears the corrugated cardboard to pieces with its fearsome beak. Stand well back. Most well balanced seagulls will shred the corrugated cardboard in a matter of minutes. Note, if you do not actually have a bucket full of fish heads and trails with which to reward the goal at the end of its exercise. It may become angered and vengeful. So make sure you're wearing protective clothing and have removed all traces of fish odor from yourself by bathing in lemon juice. Or alternatively by keeping as far away from the harbor as you can, especially those times when the fishing boats come into port with their catch of sprats and

and that's all we have time for this week. And unless I'm hanging out with the Cardinals at the Conclave at the Vatican, I should be back next week. So listening again then bye
