Good afternoon This is hooting Jada on the air. My name is Frank key. By rights I shouldn't be here this week. If you were listening to the show last week, you'll know that I went, I wanted to go to Rome, hoping that by now I would have been elected as the new pope. Unfortunately, Cardinal rathi Ratzinger has beaten me to it. I read today that a theologian called Hans come described one of Ratzinger his earlier publications as a hotchpotch of medieval backwardness and folly, the grand year. I mean, I could have done that, couldn't I? Anyway, nevermind. In order to cope with my disappointment, I've been trying to learn some new skills. And luckily, the hooting yard educational outreach hub, has announced a brand new correspondence course in bird recognition skills. I'm able to have a taster and I'm able to read out module one on the air. Note that participants who successfully complete the entire course will be presented with an embossed certificate, which gives full accreditation for entry to upcoming courses on advanced bird recognition skills, and locust and killer bee recognition skills. Anyway, this is module one of bird recognition skills from the educational outreach hub. And it's entitled the beak. a surefire method of deciding whether the animal you are looking at is a bird is to check whether it has a beak. If it has, then nine times out of 10 it will be a bird. The beak otherwise known as the bill is the only device a bird has for consuming food. birds have no teeth, so they must swallow their food hole. A birds beak can vary in size and shape depending on the nature of their diet. Some birds such as Falcons, or Falcons, or however that word is pronounced, have evolved to have a cutting type beak, which allows them to tear through flesh with violence and blood crazed savagery. Whereas the hummingbird has a probe like beak which allows it to drink the nectar from certain flowers, such as primroses, buttercups, and elecampane. Although you would be advised to check the accuracy of those examples in a botanical dictionary, I can recommend an alphabetical guide to what every infant should know about the majesty of nature by Dobson. Unfortunately, it's out of print, but if you look in your library, you might find the copy. The beak is composed of an upper jaw called the maxilla and a lower jaw called a mandible. From this, the student can infer that all birds have to jaws. Remember that bird beaks are useful in other ways. For example, wood cutters use theirs to cut wood, surprisingly, and parrots have sharp swivel beaks to tear fruit, although they are ripping and tearing is not quite as maniacal as those Falcons or Falcons mentioned earlier. small mammals like hamsters and guinea pigs are quite safe from the average parrot, which is more likely to become ravenously. ferocious in the presence of a grapefruit or a fig. flamingos have long beaks to pull out fish from the water and ducks have flat beaks that allow them to retain all the fish and plants while draining out the water. Generally speaking, if it hasn't got a beak, it's unlikely to be a bird. Try not to confuse a beak with a beaker, which is a drinks container like a mug or a tumbler, often but not always made of plastic, or with the beaker people, which refers to an archeological culture present in prehistoric Europe, defined by a pottery style, a beaker with a distinctive bell shaped profile that many archaeologists believe spread across The western part of the continent during the third millennium BC.

Unknown Speaker  05:07
If you've been paying attention, you should be able to differentiate between those long dead people and present day birds. In closing, remember that although they can fly locusts do not have beaks. Therefore they're not birds. And here are two sample questions to test whether you have ingested the information just provided. One, complete the following sentence. That carbon based living organism over there perched on a tree branch has a beak, so it must be a weasel be a bird? See a big magnetic robot? And question two. Imagine you're living in the third millennium BC and you're holding a bell shaped piece of pottery. Are you a a member of the beaker people or be a category?

Unknown Speaker  06:41
Now, all of us are gonna need some something in the next few days and weeks to stop thinking about the Pope. I know I will. And this is a splendid exercise first developed by brain guru Dennis beer pint brother of the poet durveys beer pint and how how to think of things other than the pope

A top which lurks uranium pill squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic pan, containing phosphorus hoops, and a glamorous 11 trumpet pitched towards a cobalt beaker lit up by the McKenzie beam angle though bleakly next to a yellow fustian canopy covering a massive trellis to which are glued and appended cone of polythene veiled by cotton wall wrapped around the toy horse with a propeller caked in Mercury, powering the fulcrum and bails on the fractured tub counter sunk behind the crust of a feather on a stool with pins affixed to the leaching grill place to skew atop the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Now stand back and count to 100 you will have forgotten all about the Pope.

If that doesn't appeal, you can always play a parlor game. Here's a parlor game popular in Finland, in which the players must imagine themselves hopelessly trapped in an abandoned and waterlogged mineshaft. Quite alone apart from the company of a notorious psychopathic murderer. There are two sets of cards which must be shuffled mightily and placed facedown on the table. From the first pack, players are allowed to choose three cards each on which when turned over, they will find written the name of an object or implement, which may be used to affect an escape from their imaginary predicament. A typical selection of cards could read a pin cushion, innocent of pins, a small as a battery, dead and 12 postage stamps from the Plunkett collection non adhesive. a further three cards from the second pack event chosen. These will give further crucial information about each player's entrapment to wit, for example,

Unknown Speaker  13:42
your left

Unknown Speaker  13:42
leg is broken in three places, or you have been blind since birth, or a Starling has built its nest in your tremendous Buffon. Players are each given 45 seconds to describe their method of escape, which must be plausible, vivid, logically watertight, and lead to the apprehension of the murderous psychopath by Dowty, inspector Callaway and his lane bloodhound

Here's a potted biography. Captain flask of the HMS corrugated cardboard was a bad and dangerous man. He never washed his hair, and he was fond of tormenting badgers. his ship was falling apart because Whenever any of his miserable crew tried to repair something, like the rigging, or a focus on, or even the whole all up deck, he would fly into a rage like something out of the Old Testament, and the crew would be cowed and go back below decks to their scrimshaw and grown every day all day, and every night All night, Captain flask lurched around the deck shouting at the sky in the pocket of his Westgate, where his fob watch ought to have been, he kept a supply of tin baubles, and he would throw these at any birds that came within his range, particularly guillemots, which he loved and cormorants, which he did not understand. But his aim was not good, and he usually missed the birds. One of his arms was withered from scrofula. His faab watch lay abandoned in the untidy draw of his escrip suar. hidden among old pencils, bits of Calico drawing pins, bottle tops, cornflakes and dust. Every morning at six o'clock, or whatever time that is in maritime our got Captain flask drank a whole pint of milk of magnesia

Unknown Speaker  16:30
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  16:31
he was such a bad man. Such a dangerous man.

Unknown Speaker  17:03
Continuing on the bird theme this week, historical Mr. scrim draws aviary. Last Tuesday, Mr. scrimshaw realized his lifelong ambition 500 yards to the south of the Pang Hill orphanage, he threw open the gates of his aviary for Tots have been gathered outside for three hours. The tinier ones literally wetting themselves with excitement. The big fat son battered down, it was a cloudless day. Mr. scrimshaw had announced the opening of his aviary, only the day before, but work had been going on for months, if not years, that parentless infants had grown used to the site from the orphanage windows of a gigantic fence of corrugated iron. Suddenly, overnight, it was gone. The outer walls of the aviary visible at last. As they ate their breakfast porridge, they were told that they would be the very first visitors. Mr. scrimshaw did not even want to be paid. And now at noon, they marched solidly in their excitement replaced by or at first, there were no birds to be seen. Beyond the main gate, at the end of a muddy pathway, were to further gates, huge, have beaten bronze, and each with a sign upon it, a single word black on white, in letters so plain and clear that even the most myopic infant could read them if they could read at all, and many of them could not because the Pang Hill orphanage was a notoriously Ill run institution, that principle and unscrupulous ex Mariner, who picked his staff from wretched sinks of iniquity down by the docks. Between the gates stood Mr. scrimshaw wearing a peculiarly dainty hat. Hello, hello, hello, children. He cried. His jollity somewhat forced. You must come and see my birds, but you must choose, you may only enter through one gate. On one side, you will find cages containing specimens of all the birds that the Bible says are clean. And on the other birds that the Bible says are unclean, the choice is yours. The poor little godless, tinies looks at each other, and Mr. scrimshaw and at the gates, whatever may lie behind them. The gates themselves were identical. Neither glistening and shiny. Nor stained and splattered with Mark. The children did not know that behind one gate, they would find turtle doves, pigeons, quails, sparrows swallows, Cox and Hans partridges and cranes and that behind the other word Eagles or Selfridge, Ospreys vultures, gleeds, kites, ravens, owls, great owls, little owls, hawks, knighthawks, cuckoos, cormorants, swans, pelicans, Gaia, eagles, storks, herons, lapwings, bats, ostriches, peacocks, and bitterns. The poor little mites have no idea at all. And they could certainly not ask for guidance from the ruffians in whose charge they languished. No doubt dear listener, you have read your Bible and can run to the orphans aid. And while you're about it, release the backs which shouldn't be there in the first place.

Unknown Speaker  21:34
According to the Bible, bats are birds. I may have to write to Benedict the 16th about that one. Um, bats bats bats bat having your blood sucked by a vampire bat can be an alarming experience, and not at all like being Bled by leeches. In the latter case, you're likely to be attended by a kindly apothecary or physician, who will apply the leeches and make reassuring noises. Alternatively, you may be trudging through a swamp and leeches will fasten upon your legs and begin to drain your blood. But in such cases, you're unlikely to notice them as you will be half submerged in the swamp. Therefore, in your ignorance of the leeches, you will not be frightened. a vampire bat is likely to attack you without warning however, and so you will be alarmed. Many folk make the mistake of lumping in pipistrelle Egyptian fruit, red, long nosed little brown, pallid Western massive Sarah teen pocketed free tailed woolly falls vampire Horry, Indiana, Northern ghost faced greater horseshoe Brandt, Honduran white natters Lapid brown nocturnal, EPA, Ipanema 10th, making big brown evening yellow spotted nothing pipistrelle, and other bats with vampire bats. And that's being fearful of the mall. But only the vampire bat will plunge its fangs into the soft white flesh of your neck and begin to drain you of your vital Gore. If you are awake, and especially if you are active, for example, playing Lawn Tennis, orienteering, or doing outdoor carpentry, you will be able to fight off the vampire bat. Remember, you are bigger and stronger than it is and be not afraid. On the other hand, if you're fast asleep and unprotected by an anti bat curtain of heavy purple barricade, the vampire bat may suck your blood uninterrupted until its thirst is sated. If you are the bats first victim for a while, it may drink all of your blood and you will not wake up because you will be lifeless. Do not believe those foolish stories about waking after a visit from a vampire bat and tentatively feeling punctures in your neck and thence forth being a kind of undead human version with a blood lust of your own. That will only happen if you live in Transylvania and bear a resemblance to Bela Lugosi all Lon Chaney. And one further note, please note that long cheney is not to be confused with Lynne Cheney, wife of the current vice president of the United States of America.

horoscope time now, I know you've been waiting for that. Wondering what your fate brings over the next few days. Here at hooting yard. Our horoscopes are based on the so called Blodgett astrological system of six rather than 12 signs over many years, forecasts made under this system who have proved over 148 times more reliable than all that Pisces and Aquarius nonsense. You can work out which sign you are by referring to the online guide at the website the aggressive which is www dot Blodgett global domination.com forward slash human fate dot html site under construction. here then are the six signs and the predictions for this week. Fruit backed try to remember that you are lactose intolerant, the hours before Twilight will be significant for your pet stoat throw away that tub of swore fieger mayonnaise It is time to dig out your copy of Gordon sting sumners profound song.

Coathanger. Your recurrent nightmares about an albino hen will finally make sense. Don't go near any buildings large or small slot. At last your destiny will begin to unfold probably as you take a stroll along the towpath of the old canal. vengeful thoughts will assail your brain, but you should ignore them and devote your energies to making jam. A hollyhock may have special meaning for your kith and kin.

Unknown Speaker  27:49
Tarr boosh,

Unknown Speaker  27:52
oh, what can alle the horoscope reader alone and palely loitering? Make sure you treat yourself to an electric bath and a session in a sensory deprivation tank. The bale of gas in your house of stupidity has incalculable effects. You will stand on the steps of the insane asylum and hundreds of men and women will stand below you with their upturned faces. Among them will be old men crushed by sorrow and old men ruined by vise aged women with faces that seemed to plead for pity. Women that make you shrink from their unwomanly gaze lie on like young men made for heroes but caught in the devil's trap and changed into beasts and boys whose looks show that sin has already stamped them with its foul insignia and burned into their souls. The shame which is to be one of the elements of eternal punishment. Unless impressible person then you would feel moved at the sight of that throng of bruised and broken creatures. A him will be read and when the preachers strike up an old tune, voice after voice will join in the melody until it swells into a mighty volume of sacred song. You will notice that the faces of many are wet with tears. And there will be an indescribable pathos in their voices. That pitying God amid the rapturous hallelujah is of a heavenly host. She'll bend to listen to the music of these broken harps and the last star sign in the Blodgett system, Nixon vile dribbling goblins covered in boils will make life difficult today. And that's all we have time for this week. Yours in Christ, Frank Kay, bye bye
