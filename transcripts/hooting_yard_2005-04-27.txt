This is hooting yard on the air and my name is Frank key. I was gonna make this a special a special edition of the show this week all about fruit bats. But I changed my mind at the last minute. Sorry is not. This is a piece called an axe grow tax. My name is Axel rotex and I am the last survivor of a vanquished hoard. Like the rest of my hoard. I am neither and smooth man nor an hairy man, but somewhere in between. Our vanquish moment was bloody and violent as you might imagine. It was also very, very noisy. What with the clash of steel and the roar of cannon aids, and the howling and wailing of the wounded. I pray to my strange gods that never again will I witness such carnage. to my chagrin, it took me a single morning to vanquish my previously unconquerable Horde. As dawn broke on that terrible Thursday, there were 1000s of us hooting and whooping doorbird in the paint of ferocity, sharpening our implements and groaning a lot. We were well fed, tough, fearless, and bent on conquest. By noon, I was the only one left hiding in a patch of Bracken and I confess, shuttering in terror and grief. I was also bleeding from a contusion on my forehead, and possibly slightly concussed. All around me, the more land was a scene of corpses and hacked off limbs and blood. By mid afternoon, I was feeling a little more myself. A stray hen had wandered into the Bracken, and it was good to know that I was not the last living thing on earth. poultry can be consoling in such circumstances. I reflected that as a warrior in a barbaric and bloodthirsty Horde. I ought to have expected things to turn out this way. Sooner or later, I was quite certain that our vanquishes had now left the scene to go and vanquish elsewhere. So I stood up and saying goodbye to the hen began walking away from my dead, and in some cases, still dying comrades, in the direction of the palace. Perhaps it was callous of me to ignore the groans of those who were still alive, whose souls have not yet been plucked from their bodies by the hideous back faced God bed and placed in his capacious pouch. Try not to judge me by your own moral code if you have one. By nightfall I had reached the stream that runs into a pool near the palace. I sat down on a tuffet and missed a cigarette. The moon was full, and there were so many stars visible that they set my brain dizzy. I looked across the fields at the palace. reassuringly, the usual bonfire was blazing on the roof. A bowl water rat came to give me the once over, but soon scuttled away. I stubbed out my cigarette and made my way towards the palace at last. Gusts of wind, disheveled my hairstyle despite all the grease I had caked it with that morning. The morning it seemed so long, long ago. As I took my final wiry steps towards the gigantic wooden gates. My heart leaped when I saw that a great golden banner had been hung from the crenellations Welcome home and acts a grow tax it read in letters of vermilion and blue as I beat my great muscular fists on the palace gates, midnight struck Thursday was over

This is a folk song, but I can't sing so I'm just gonna read it. It's called on the Bonnie Bonnie banks. On the Bonnie Bonnie banks of the foul old law where a dredge applied from shorter shore, I saw my true love, pluck some furs and place it in her hair. My True Love was a wandering last of a clan that herded cows and she broke her back when she had a mishap with a trampoline for her folk herded cows through the seasons long, but they also jumped and leaped. They would wander into the market square of a town down in some Dale and they bounce up and down and gamble about wearing coats of many hues. And the songs they sang over songs they sang was strange a strange could be I remember one that went Vienna, it means nothing to me. All caked and painted were their cats yellow, green and blue. But my true loves cart was black as pitch as black as the raven and crow. I stand in the hills in an icy Gale wondering where Will my true love go? Green grow the rushes Oh, on those Bonnie Bonnie banks

This is a change a complete change of tone. This is a love story, and it's called pale flapper. What do you do with the drunken sailor is a question that's often been posed in the past, never having been to see except once or twice as a stowaway. It was not something Sidney paste had given much thought to. Yet when he awoke on that still September morning, pale sunlight leaching into his scandalous fantasy echelle bedroom. He was confronted by not one but a dozen drunken sailors dancing a sort of hornpipe on his balcony yet. It was dubbed a balcony yet because it was considerably smaller than the average balcony in that fair city. So tiny In fact, that it was a wonder that 12 drunken sailors had managed to cram themselves onto it, let alone to dance a sort of hornpipe one of the sailors hadn't one of the sailors had an accordion, and was drunkenly squeezing out the tune to which they danced. Sidney paste knew that tune Well, for it was the onion song by Ashford and Simpson memorably recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi terell. Although as we have seen, not given to pondering what he should do with the drunken sailor, Sidney paste often thought about the fact that pain and fear are the spices that make you cry. For in his life. He had known much pain and not a little fear. Was it fear of the drunken sailors that found him leaping from his bed now on this September mourn? Or was it that Sidney paste always leapt straight out of bed as soon as he awoke, eager to seize the day like some hyperactive toddler bent on gratification Yes, that was it for Look at him now filling the sink in his room with ice cold water and repeatedly plunging his head into it. But where is his towel? Ah, one of the drunken sailors has fashioned his towel into a piratical bandana, and wound it around his head to rein in his unruly locks. But he's dancing of the sort of hornpipe is so vigorous that the towel is coming loose, and within the next few seconds it will fall from his head and off the balcony yet into the street. So many stories below, where it will land on a passing flapper on her way home from an all night jitterbug party. In seeking to retrieve his towel, Sydney paste will meet this pale and enchanting flapper.

Let me tell you about the 26th living members of the rather eerie blocked family ever since the night of the 1958 Munich air disaster, sorry, that should be ever since the morning of the 1958 Munich air disaster which wiped out the Busby Babes. The curiously ageless blots have remained within the confines of the converted pigsty complex, just off the blister line bypass where they forage for food, do meteorological readings and ponderously intone ponderous incantations, field recordings of the most ponderous of their incantations, the 14 hour Amash our Tippi Hedren led to a mildly successful CD release.

All this of course has been fiction, apart from the mnemonic which is a mnemonic and his In fact, this is a history of starlings. A third of the world's Starling population lives in North America. The fact that possibly over a billion starlings roam the skies is due to one man, a rich New York drug manufacturer named Eugene schieffelin, who in 1890, released at imported starlings in Central Park as part of his fairly sensible plan to introduce to the United States, all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Those who do not love starlings see them as pests. And indeed, it's not unknown for our hungry flock to devour 20 tons of potatoes, spread histoplasmosis and make life difficult for bluebirds and woodpeckers attempts to reduce or scare off pesky starlings have included over the past 200 years, the use of artificial owls, radio broadcasts of the starlings alarm call Roman candles and a mass publicity drive to encourage people to eat Starling pie with recipes. Use of Dobson one of the more arresting facts about Dobson is that he spent a five year period living in an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg, such as the hold on him of this location that he devoted no less than 16 pamphlets to it. According to the statistician Aloysius nesting bird, Dobson wrote more words about this factory than on any other topic. What was it about the place that exerted such a fascination upon Dobson? How significant is the fact that during his stay there, the factory was still functioning, producing 1000s of tins of evaporated milk every week, and not as it is today, and abandoned ruin populated only by screeching birds? Was the workforce aware that the pamphleteer had taken up residence in an unused room on the mezzanine floor, and that he detached his own design of bolts and latches to the door to prevent his being disturbed? Or the carefully lettered sign on the door reading Sq Perkins, janitorial Padre was a fake of Dobson's own devising. Was Dobson responsible for the occasional small theft of a few tins of evaporated milk noted in a big ledger by the management security team. Was it really necessary for the security team to march about the premises in gangs of four dressed in uniforms, not unlike those of a fascist junta? accompanied by howling slobbering dogs, each as tall as a 10 year old? Were the dogs skittish when taken to their kennels at the end of a security tour? Did a wet behind the ears Jr. evaporated milk technical consultant take the rap for the missing tins. Was he dismissed? And did he have his epaulette thrown into the shredder? What in the name of heaven was Dobson doing in that room for five years? While the answers to these cogent questions entirely absent from Dobson's pamphlets? And most importantly, given that the factory is now an abandoned building full of birds? What birds screech there now. This is called the tale of gas Bard. Gas Bard worked for the gas board. In appearance he resembled the man dressed in red raising his left arm in Hieronymus Bosch is painting the ship of fools. Incidentally, while we're briefly on the subject of art, you may or may not know that the famous foot from the credit sequence of Monty Python's Flying Circus was taken from Angelo Brahm xenos allegory, Venus, Cupid folly and time. Gaspard was both dutiful and dismaying. An air of glumness hovered over him. To some it was visible aura flies and other tiny and noise things with wings seem to follow him around. Had he the wit gas Bard could have made himself useful to the world's entomologists, but he was different as well as being beautiful and dismaying. His gas board desk was a sorry piece of office furniture, rickety and fragile gas bar Saturday for many, many hours each day to no apparent purpose. There is a story by john Cheever, which ends with the question Oh, what can you do with a man like that? The same can be asked of gas Bard for there's something almost inhuman in his dullness. Let us whisk him away then and place him in the icy waste of northern Canada sitting on a felled log surrounded by frisky reindeer sipping from his flask of piping hot broth, a stars sparkle in the clear night sky. A voice booms from the heavens gasp BOD gasp BOD. He is stricken with terror.

Unknown Speaker  26:12
Yet he

Unknown Speaker  26:12
knows this is the most important thing that has ever happened to him. So he reaches into the pocket of his anorak and takes out a little notepad and a biuro irritatingly justice he's about to jot down whatever supernatural command he is to be given the voice fall silent, and the only sound is that of a pitiless Arctic and Gale roaring in his ears. So we shall leave him there as he drinks the last of his broth, and though he remains ignorant of his destiny, we can rest assured that gasp Bard is soon to become the stipendiary Vizier of CAC and no ot but waso and Glee for all eternity, for he is immortal. And he is magnificent. I'd like to leave you this week
