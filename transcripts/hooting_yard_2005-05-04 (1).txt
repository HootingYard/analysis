Hello, this is Frankie with hooting yard on the air, bit of a kerfuffle with all those people leaving the studio and me coming in. But I'll read you something I was going to I was going to talk about something that gets my goat. But I've never told you about my goat. I'll have to tell you about the goat another time. But one of the things that does get my goat is the fact that these days whenever you get business letters, people can't write anymore. Have you noticed that people just don't seem to know how to write a good business letter. So in order to help with that, I've got a here is an example of how to write a standard business letter. In this case, if one is asked to provide someone with a reference, so you get a letter saying, you know, so and so has written for a reference, how do you? How do you write that letter? Well, here's a here's a standard example of a reference letter. It's for someone called Mr. buzurg. And it reads as follows. Thank you for your letter of the 20th of July regarding Mr. bukh. I'm happy to provide him with a reference. I have known Mr. buke for 10 years, ever since he took up the position of Scrivener, dog's body and wreck in my gloomy factory perched on the hillside next to the lunatic asylum. At the time I engaged Mr. bukh. I suspected that he had some connection with that institution. And in the decade since I have had no reason to alter my opinion. You asked me to comment on my impression of Mr. buttes, quote, suitability for the job, unquote. Forgive me if I find this difficult, I do not wish to do violence to our native language. But to use the word suitability in conjunction with Mr. bukh is to mock the Queen's English. Indeed, it's to make a mockery of sense itself. My problems with Mr. buke began on his very first morning in my employ to settle him in I had instructed him to carry out a menial task, removing bits of glue from the interior walls of VAT. To facilitate his progress. He was supplied with a variety of tools, including a pencil sharpener, a pin cushion, and a decidedly ferocious blowtorch. No sooner had I turned my back then Mr. bude became embroiled in a tussle with my pet Panther, which, crazed with hunger, managed to slip it to the leash and embed its razor sharp fangs in his left leg. For this, I had no option but to dock Mr. buke his first month wages. It was not a good start. But I had had many ne'er do well working for me in the past, and believe that I could yet mold Mr. buzurg into a marginally less repellent specimen of human drags. To this end, I assigned him to work in the filthiest dankest wing of the factory, where he was expected to spend all day dragging sacks full of huge iron lumps backwards and forwards in infested tunnels for no apparent purpose. So ineptly did Mr. buke execute his duties that I was forced to withhold his pay for a further year. I run my hands with frustration, but the man was impossible. Given a simple task, he would be utterly incapable of completing it with the requisite speed, good humor and fawning obedience that one expect

to give just one example Mr. You failed to barge one particularly heavy sack containing a score of medium sized anvils a single inch, despite being given all of five minutes to drag it 800 yards along a tunnel in which small bonfires of sulfur had been ignited only moments before I set a wolf hound yapping at his heels, but to no avail. The man was purely and simply work shy. I'm a fair man, and I had no wish to consign him to that scrap heap of the unemployed and the unemployable and useless. So indeed, so instead, I agreed with Mr. bukh that he could embark upon a training scheme. In return for a modest fee to be paid to me daily in cash. I offered to provide him with a comprehensive course of training and a multiplicity of disciplines, both within the factory and in the adjoining administrative hellhole. In the first week alone, we covered a huge range of skills, licking my boots to lay Shawn prostrating himself on his stomach whenever I came within 100 yards of him and dribbling with happiness at the mere mention of my name. At this stage in what can only roughly be called his career, Mr. buke crawled into my palatial office one day to request my assistance with a personal matter. tempted though I was to have him savaged by Alsatians I reclined in my unbelievably comfortable executive armchair and heard him out. He confessed that he was in some financial difficulties and begged me to help. sipping my glass of ruinously expensive wine, I delivered a stern lecture on the virtues of Thrift, and idli beat him about the skull with a copy of self help by Samuel smiles. I admitted that I was in a position to repay his paltry debts a billion fold if I wish to. But that's such a course of action would not in the long run be of the slightest benefit to him. I then advised him that he could earn a few extra pounds by selling various of his bodily organs, and that's better his financial situation, while basking in the knowledge that he was being self reliant, rather than coming cap in hand to his employer. To prove my point, I offered to buy one of his kidneys and a pint of his blood on the spot, for which I would pay him for puns. As the bulk of his debts were monies owed to me, I generously dot before prints from his account. In this way, I was able to relieve him of the responsibility of handling any cash himself, and thereby falling prey to the inevitable temptation to fritter the money away on food, clothing or medicine. Only after this transaction had taken place, did I set the Alsatians on him. Not long after this incident, Mr. Big announced that he had found himself another job and wish to terminate his contract of employment. If he's inane, burbling was to be believed he had been offered the position of assistant slave at a charnel house, the main duties being to crawl on his hands and knees in foul pits of order from nine to five each day. While I listened patiently, he explained that he felt that this post would give him opportunities undreamed of in his current position, and that he was prepared to take a cut in salary in order to take up the offer. poking at him with a stick. I nodded my consent, I had no wish to stand in his way. My only concern was that he would have the decency to fulfill the terms and conditions of his contract before setting off for greener pastures. I then reminded him of the papers he had signed on his first day at the factory, the main clauses being that in order to leave, he would have to give 40 years notice and to repay every single penny of his salary since day one. To my surprise, Mr. Boo hoo, moments before, had been adamant that he wished to leave, said he'd like a few days further to consider the matter. Once again, I nodded my assent, then summon 14 of my assistants, who bundle the Mr. Boo out of my office and set him to work on his latest task, which was to lie face down in a muddy ditch while a herd of demented bison charged over him. In view of the above, then I must admit that I cannot in truth recommend Mr. bukh to you. His work is shoddy his attendance and punctuality leave much to be desired, and I have the greatest doubt about his character.

His sickness record is thoroughly unsatisfactory and I've been Put in the uncomfortable position of having to threaten various members of the medical profession with violence after they had the temerity to issue Mr. Big with sickness certificates. However, should you decide to ignore my warnings and offer a job to Mr. buke he will be available for work upon completion of his notice period in 40 years time, you will sincerely be good.

He sat on a cube of marble bestowing his teeth upon the scene. The prow of a pirate ship was fast approaching him from behind, but he paid it no mind. Golf screeched, fish leaped out of the water. Men with tongs hopped about on rafts under the jetty. He sat still beaming radiantly, exhibiting his teeth a little more. The pirate ship ran aground on the rocks, many perished, but some swam to safety. night fell. The inns and taverns opened their doors, dispensing free grog to the pirates, who rate repaid this hospitality by shelling peas, building a veranda and arching their backs in a most amusing manner. And still, this man sat on his marble cube, as if he were a statue or even a figment. in the dead of night, he burst with a tremendous explosion, unleashing a mad troupe of demons into the town, as the moon ranged away through mist and vapors.

was a brief extract from a very old piece called zest for crumpled things. And here's another extract from it. As a child, deranged, ma hoots attached a pair of antlers to his cranium. As the years passed, forks and branches sprouted with increasing rapidity, their momentum such that by his 30th birthday, he was effectively barred from entering his own house. A vivid circus tent was found for him, and he spent much of his adulthood patching up holes pierced in its fabric by the restless implacable antlers atop his skull. Eventually, the tent itself became too small, and he felt a wandering dejectedly and the vast purple hills of hoon. He was last seen seated in the glomming on the roots of an infamous yew tree on the road between Hoon and mins, the antlers mysteriously vanished as if they had never existed at all.

Right? Yes, we're back back on course now, with the show, after all, the flat noodle soup haven't spoken about soup for some time. This is a this is a sort of. Not exactly. It is a sort of recipe. It's a general general recipe for soup based on one of those texts where I write every other sentence and ever Other sentences from an original text. In this case, it's from an old reform the reform cookery book I think of about 1902. So every other sentence is from that, and I just inserted sentences to create a brand new text. Soup. The subject of today's harangue is the preparation of soup, so pinback your nasty fat little purple is and listen carefully. The following directions will be found generally applicable so that there will be no need to repeat the several details each time. In any case, I will distribute written notes later. And this time I'm feeling magnanimous, so they will be legible. seasonings are not specified, as these are a matter of individual tastes and circumstance. Some people think I'm over fond of very, very hot mustard. And that's blame me for everything from trivial lip burns to years spent in a lazaretto path. Some from considerations of health or otherwise have forbidden the use of salt cities. In such cases, a little sugar will help to bring out the flavor of the vegetables, but the less all the members of the household are alike, at best not be added before bringing to the table. Anyway, at first glance, salt and sugar look almost identical. So one route is to dim the lanterns or to light a batch of blubber candles, the fumes from which will be accurate enough to divert your diners attention. Where soup is to be strained whole pepper, mace etc is much preferable to ground, both as bread being free from adulteration and giving all the flavors without the grid. Some soup recipes of course, call for the inclusion of handfuls of grit, dust and pavement grease, so bear that in mind. The water in which cauliflower, green peas etc have been boiled should be added to the stock pot. But as we're now recognizing that all vegetables should be cooked as conservatively as possible. That is by steaming or in just as much water as they will absorb so as not to waste the valuable salts and juices. There will be not there will not be much of such liquid in a reform Minaj any water you do use is best brought to kitchen in an iron pail direct from the closest duck pond for springs and even wells harbor all sorts of tiny little beasties with far too many legs, and even wings, whereas all such creepy crawlies will have been removed from a duck pond by the eating habits of hungry and none to fastidious ducks. A stock must therefore be made from fresh materials. But as those are comparatively inexpensive, we need not grudge having them have the freshest and best. try never to eat anything that is more than five years old. listeners of readers of Thackeray will remember the little dinner at Timmins by his where that when the hired chef shed such consternation in the bosom of little Mrs. Timmons by his outrageous demands for a leg of beef, a leg of veil and a ham on behalf of the stockpot. Those who do not know their factory will wonder what in heaven's name I'm talking about. But the point is playing every kitchen must have a bound set of Victorian novels wrapped in greaseproof paper to avert the unexpected.

This is a piece about confidential confidential agent blot. One of confidential agent blot early investigative triumph was cracking the case of the disheveled marmalade man. Let us recall the facts. The winning of horses had destroyed the sleep of the little village of sprang for two months. There was a damp, hideous thing in the corner of the post office that none dared approach. Perhaps most jarring of all, an illegal cafeteria had been built slap in the middle of the village surrounded by menacing guard dogs, whose fangs glistened in the moonlight. confidential agent blot arrived on the scene on a Tuesday afternoon frantic with gales his dazzling cone shaped hat made the villagers wonder what frustum it had once topped. His complexion was paler, more drawn and anguished than usual, possibly because a change in diet had given him a recent attack of the seeds, from which he was not yet fully recovered. His breath was tagged with the fumes of his weird pills. Those tiny pink spangles Dr. Greg had insisted upon confidential agent blot, commandeered and abandoned bird seed silos his headquarters and subjected every single villager to a lengthy interrogation has been manner was charming, but curiously our nerving the clinic was soon filled with haunted looking patients, demanding to have their brains slowest with Baxter's terrible fluid. by Saturday afternoon, with no letup in the gales sprang had an era of almost biblical calamity. And yet, and yet, as soon as his last interview was done with confidential agent blot, sprang upon the disheveled marmalade man, and carted him off to the dungeon in his cave. The horses winning ceased, the thing in the post office evaporated, a law was passed to make the cafeteria legal, and the dogs bounded away across the hills, their atrocious, yapping, growing ever fainter, until it could no longer be heard at all.

Many years ago, I decided to write a series of called scenes from the lives of the poets and they were going to be 26 poets. Each who surnames began with the letters A to Zed, hence the 26 of them. And I wrote one and I never wrote any of the others. So this is the only one that exists, and it's seen from the lives of the poet's number one mod AB dab. My name is mod AB Deb. I am the woman who ate blood oranges with Enver hacia. We sat together in uncomfortable beach chairs without speaking.

Enver hacia directed my attention to the left. I looked and I saw a rowing boat and the rowing boats oars. The orders were too small for the rowing boat, or the rowing boat was too big for the oars. I turned to look at envoy hajah. After a pause, he rose and pulled from his pocket or length of goals. Then when he went he shook my hand, but he did not let fall the goals he spoke then, he said he had to go and draft some new Albanian laws are recall nothing more

This is called copied. copied is as you might expect, related to Cupid, although there is a lot more than that extra p to help you distinguish between them. copied is composed of both toxic and non toxic gases and tinkle the little Golden Bell whenever it lights upon the hairy back of a bison, which it often does. For carpets favorite haunts are the vast plains of North America. I say it because copied is if not exactly a hermaphrodite, neither male nor female. Although sometimes when it's gases cool and take on liquid form, it can bear a fugitive resemblance to Sanya Henny 1912 to 1969 the legendary Norwegian figure skating champion. such moments can be dangerous for COVID for it is volatile and seeks warmer air urgently to return to its gaseous state. copied is invoked by farmers and by those who work with timber, for it brings them luck. Conversely, wrestlers and plutocrats live in fear of a visitation by copied and tremble as its approach. You can be sure that if you see a trembling plutocrat copied is not far away. Some say carpet can be trapped in an envelope or small carton and used for both good and ill. The common feature of such tales is that not one of them has ever been verified.
