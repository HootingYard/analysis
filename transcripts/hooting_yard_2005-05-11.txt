Good afternoon. My name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Today, it's of decisive importance that I tell you about Blodgett esque farming methods. The techniques pioneered by Blodgett in his heyday are breathtaking. Consider just for example, the uses to which a blog jetty and farmer will put hay. There are many, many diagrams in the manual, which show bales of hay being commandeered for all sorts of inventive purposes all over the farmyard in all six seasons of the year. That's right six seasons. One of blogilates most telling innovations was his calendrical recalibration. If I'm using the word correctly, out go winter, spring summer and autumn income tally spate the time of Mighty remonstrations tak hub and bellisima so comm hub comm have a haywain as the saying goes with his big fat boots stuffed with straw. Sorry, I mean, hey, we ought not get diverted from this important essay by wandering down the byways of blog jetty and countryside parlance. But I can't resist sharing with you the rhyme that goes Don't forget to shut the gate on the 43rd of spate. The meaning of which is obvious, as you would realize, had you seen as I have an implacable army of our bino hens marching off into the sunset, because little version versus rhetorics the barnyard hubballi, hoy was too busy chewing on a sheaf of fronds to remember to close the gate behind him. As it happened, the frogs were poisonous and the miscreant was subject to convulsive fits for the next three weeks. As with hay so with mulch, blood, your Teske mulch is a thing of beauty, even if it does stink. Have you ever seen asparagus grown in Blodgett mulch? You would remember if you had for it is too common every day asparagus as a big shiny supersonic 26th century space rocket is to a shred of plankton. Preparation of mulch takes place mostly in business. When the winds how and thunderclaps shatter the eardrums of toiling farmworkers, Hardy folk with almost inhuman musculature as a result of regular doses of Blodgett serum, the recipe for which appears in an appendix to the manual. To begin farming the Blodgett way, all you will need is a hoe, a shapeless hat, iron determination and your own field, preferably one with a pond in it, and the ducks in the pond mergansers or teal, some of them real, some of them would carved decoyed ducks, and some of them just vaporous specters of your own imagining

this is a very old piece called the emotion man. The man with the hammers, the man with the flags, he has a second pair of shoes. He bought them in blister lane, he had them repaired. His head is the same size as two of anyone else's head, or a few pounds of oranges, plums or other fruit. It will take years. Once he decided to paint his ship with stolen paint, he could not look back for ship when painted would be burnt sienna in color stains apart. What a long ship it was and is and will be. It had sailed from shore to shore. He held sway at the helm and on deck. He spat plum stones into his flask. Much later he knew they would be crushed liquefied in his book Blender in his kitchen in his other heart, the heart he had built at the docks for those mornings when he did not set sail on his ship to reach some other shore where he had other hearts. In weather so suitable for breakfast on a lawn 18 bowls of Special K and a jellied jellied eel, he would ram the AWS home, force them into the muck, so they were perpendicular, not far away from the tallest of the six trees, which were poplars or larches, or even use AWS fixed in place he will paint them the oars with the delicate bristles of his Coddington brush. Its wooden handle has seen better days, particularly the days in Jutland, shaving ingan Reykjavik, other landmarks of or near Scandinavia. Those were the days before he was pulled towards the seas, who pulled him to the seas, who made his flag, who made his shoes that I cannot say not yet. The cattle maps were stacked in a rough wooden crate. The crate had been painted butter had been kept in this crate butter used in the sandwiches he had eaten that half time in all those pole vaulting or archery competitions he had entered. They had struck a medal for him. He was so keen, he had lost the medal. It was zinc. It had fallen out of his pocket in March. deep snow lay on the ground. He remembered the day well, because he had to it was potato de Villa Dressler. The one with the goiter had a big iron pot of gruul and slops as he always did. No one knew how old he was, but his birthday parties were marked by rectitude and spasms. He was extremely tall, he had to stoop to into his own house. It was a squalid house is stank of vinegar. This wrestler was wanting to sing remarkable songs as he sat on the jetty dangling his feet in the brackish water. For many years, he had attended his broken nose, applying a new set of bandages every day. He used bright red bandages, having smeared them first with ink or ointment. The bottles were identical and kept on the same shelf. The shelf was made of plastic, but it's sloped towards the left. Nothing heavier than two small bottles or some corks could be kept on it. He brushed his hair. The lake was hidden by trees a mile away from hemoglobin towers. for 1000 years the lake looked blue. One day when he was famished, he swam there. He wore water wings, rubber ones and yellow. He had to inflate them with his perfumed breath, it took all morning. By noon he was exhausted. Later, stealthily, he crept by torch light to the moorings. They had been varnished so thoroughly that he slipped and fell. No bones were broken. But Pang Hill was no longer his home, nor could it ever be so not while he was such preposterous trousers. Eating jam by the spoonful, he watched the branch giveaway. It fell to the ground. He was wearing tiny sandals three sizes too small. The stitching was coming loose on both of them and not before time, the man with the clarinets had arrived. He sprained his feet on legs. They mucked about with each other's pencil sharpeners all day. an ailing vulture circled overhead. It had splendid musculature or thought it did. Below on the pebbles. They don't skin diving equipment.

The pub was shot. The landlord had ruse is underneath his hair. He carried a selection of bats, pails, needles and vicuna nets, these he patted with a yearning. His one foot was shot in an enemy's shoe, a token of combat. It have a vulgar Greek, but squashed anthem earwigs on the paving slabs with the best of them. This was called hack slot B. It meant so much or it meant nothing. It was not sure. Long ago he had become entangled in the waterlogged corridors of the big damp building. And now there was no escape. the magnificence of it was breathtaking. It's taken centuries to build. But only last year was the tin bath warehouse added on. He spat in it and kept on spitting. He was unable to stop himself. feathers sprouted but did not grow. They were spindly and vicious. He could no longer remember How to speak Hungarian. If he ever knew his boxer shorts were blue from Budapest. There is a reason for everything but not for food. Food must be speared with big tin forks or so he thought. He poked the plankton with his fork. The plates had been smashed. It was in bits on the lolium. He intended to take up athletics. They would wrap him in flowers and other greenery and all because he had ruined his crayons when he was a tot. He was wicked, wicked, and he went on a cruise. The cruise took him north. Then it took him West. He was not sure which coinage to use. He had some change in his little pockets. It weighed so much he had to trudge. After careful planning, he set fire to all the maps. He put the cartons to one side. They would be useful to him later on, if at all, but it was time to hold a grudge. He lighted upon a fishmonger and wrapped him on the nose with a fountain pen. Maroon ink spurted out onto the fishmongers mouth and chin. He had locked jaw and some pianos. Where did he keep his pianos? I sent a detective to find out. One day he would brandish despicable wooden things inside his tent. It was a famous tent, but he had frayed it. It was decorated with a boa constrictor motif lacquered in mode. He came upon it on a mountain top, he held it into a sandpit. his skull was perfectly formed and bright blue. There had been much talk of this in 1000s of corridors, and on horseback. All the fruit had been chewed. He checked his dictionary for errors. Under B he found plenty. He pasted them up through back his head extricated some tax from the hardboard and shoved them into an envelope. This was stylish. He sat by the big clock, his sister arrived, she was an emigre. She buried three or four pelicans or yaks near a factory that had to be the factory. This must be an ambulance. It's bleepers are off pitch and ungodly. Bundled inside a blanket she sported a mask, half of it carved out of mahogany and the rest out of something metallic delicate tracer is a bit lace smeared on the gasworks for this was Raymond's village. His dubbing was better than the rest. He had come this far and had no sandwiches left. He was in agony. Darling, the beekeeping outfit had been no laughing matter. The reek of sandalwood and lavender was in the air. He was panelists wearing an altimeter instead of a wristwatch he Korea along the towpath of the canal. The immersion man was on his way.

News has reached us that someone has found extracts of a bit of an autobiography by Dobson which is quite a remarkable thing. No one realized that the out of print pamphleteer had written an autobiography. We've been able to get hold of for extract rather perplexing but nevertheless words from Dobson himself. I'll read the four extracts to now. This is the first one my mother's brooch was blue. She took me to the lake and punched my jaw. She threw my breakfast into a pond. I banged my head against a barge the day she showed me the canal and the second extract there were massive shutters in that room and I had never left it. Ah, I had brilliant in in my hair. There were roses. There were lockets I was lacking something so unnerved. But for my hatred she'd have seen it even eaten it, got it on her eyelash, crushed it broken it eat it out of someone's purse or loved it like Did after it. So here's my signifier. You can read it. You can keep it. You're so thick you don't even know what to do with it. Well, eyebrows hair, my pastels, then breakfast and a lover. Oh, come on, you must be getting or maybe you're just so fetching. I'm done with fleshing out my lying. My hair is in a tangle and I haven't paid the rent, but I had brilliant in in my hair and yours were better shutters. Dammit, I couldn't even see your rubbish but I had brilliant teen in my hair. Extract number three when the tiny Mexican house on stilts was revealed behind such rich brocade curtains and we fell in love. Captain snaps wooden leg was rammed between us. He was a brutish man, vengeful hirsute and loose mood, prone to piss and vinegar jars and to take our clocks to bits. I remember how he left the parts. Dial hands, cogs and springs littered about our flat smeared with marmalade peppered with talc and reeking of his dubbin we walked on either side of him mouthing words of Isaiah and loading as he limped stump, clunk stump, clunk stump, clunk by the wharf, jabbering and shouting. Oh, he never made any sense. Captain snaps wooden leg was rammed between us. I took a hunting rifle and shot him through the head. Then we were together darling, and he was good and dead. And this is the final extract. From Dobson's autobiography, a work in progress when when Dobson died, so we can't piece together when these when when these pieces refer to even when I stood at the edge of the lake when I stood on the bridge, when I looked at the water, when I saw the broken fountain when I broke my neck when I lay awake all night when I couldn't see a thing when my mind began to snap. When I was spoon fed cocoa when what I said went askew when they proffered me jam, when my tongue was hanging out. When I loitered in boom, when the diving board cracked beneath me when I fell into a pond when I was all washed up when I ate too much chocolate when nothing broke my spirit when I hosted a TV chat show when I went to a wedding when I broke down in tears when I was in despair. When Bracken snagged my socks when illness cast a shadow. When death appeared lascivious when sadness crushed my feelings when I was struck by lightning, when all I did was worry when I throw in the towel when I was scorched in deserts when no one gave me biscuits when all I had was breathing when my gas bill sent me bonkers when you told me that I'd had it all I wanted was and the next word is illegible

This is a an exciting story. Very exciting overexcited perhaps. And it's called petrochemical Shiver me timbers conclave. Rookie pirates aboard containerships need to watch their backs. As a seaside doctor. I cannot count the number of cases I've had of youngsters fresh from their first sea voyage coming to me with Cutlass wounds, or worse lead pellets from a blunderbuss embedded in their crania dangerously close to the brain. One such lad was Rufus Farjeon, who ran away to see when he was just seven. He ran from his parents Gingerbread Cottage, all the way to the beach, panting panting and he swam out to a container ship mod on the horizon and clambered aboard, and in his tiny, squeaky voice, he said to the captain. Rufus Farjeon how you fine reporting for duty captain. Captain CAC was not taken in by the boys lying about his age. He placed an avuncular hand on Farjeon shoulder and quizzed him on his knowledge of obscure marine and ponder abilities. The captain's right hand was the avuncular one, his left hand was withered. Over the next few weeks young Farjeon scrub the decks sloshed out nautical buckets, polished the railings to a gleam, and learned all there was to know about bells at sea. He also sat at Captain cacs breakfast table, reading aloud to the old sea dog from Yoko Ono's book grapefruit while the captain ate plentiful toast, hard tack biscuits and by coincidence, House of grapefruit. Then, one Thursday some weeks into the voyage, the blonde and brilliant in the boson took the boy aside as he crumbled a clattering barrel through a narrow passage between containers. A word of warning, muttered the boson in tones of menace. I bells the captain is holding a petrochemical Shiver me timbers conclave in his cabin, there may be trouble, watch your back. But Rufus Farjeon, who had celebrated his eighth birthday a week ago, was by now puffed up preening and reckless, and he ignored the Bolton's words, reeking of grog and blinded by the pitiless tropical sun, he behaved at the Conclave in a foolhardy manner, so angering a blood thirsty Coursera that he was taken to the poop deck and shot in their head. And thus, he turned up in my seaside surgery A few days later, I bandaged his wounds and prescribed a course of Dr. Wainwright's brain pills. I Well, I well knew that just one pill was enough to stand an ostrich and I had the lad on 20 of them a day for his metabolism was inhuman. I needed to find out if he was a changeling he was. And now he sits like a little potentate on a throne on the jetty, facing out to see his bandages discarded and his eyes are glow. And mermaids come to go pet him and minnows swimming ribbons at his feet, for he is trite on now and will always be throned festooned with seaweed and staring out to sea.

One thing that strikes struck me reading these things I've been picking things from something's written fairly recently and something's written many many many, many, many, many years ago. And the same words keep cropping up a brilliant team. Probably boy scene I don't know. I don't know what's going on there. But there's there's always words anyway, I don't know any if any of them are in this next piece, probably are. I went to the shops and bought some custard. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of Pang. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pain of pain and a copy of Voodoo brass. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of pain and a copy of hoodoo brass and a jam tart. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of pain and a copy of Voodoo brass and a jam tart and four and 20 blackbirds. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pain of pain and a copy of hoodoo brass and a jam tart and four and 20 blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the pin of Pang and a copy of hoodoo brass, and a jam tart and foreign 20 blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. And then I went home and took each item out of its paper bag and put the paper bags on the fire and smoke billowed up the chimney. And I saw that it was good. And I declared that it was good. in a loud voice so loud that my neighbors came running. They tumbled into my room in their stocking feet. And I stood there like a jack o' lantern with my custard and brooch and flap, and the pin of Pang and a copy of hoodoo brass, and my jam tart and foreign 20 blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. And I said to my neighbors Behold what I have bought at the shops, ye neighborly folk, behold and wonder. And they did. And I made a pot of tea and handed around cups, and I filled their cups with tea from the pot and my shopping, I distributed to my neighbors as gifts, and their hearts grew warm. And that is what happened when I had what is called an at home in my simple cottage on the outskirts of the farm where cows graze and hens clock and the farmer has gone to seed.

Finally this week, a guide to pointy town pointy town just lies just south of the port of tongs and is famous for its amusing biscuits and cakes, dustbin exhibitions, ferocious geese, horrible icing sugar jewelry, kaleidoscopic lettuce Museum, never open. Public quacking recitals, squalor, tortoises utopian vinegar works and Zan first yellow xanies the few squares that existed in pointy town before the revolution were used as ostrich colonies and horse laundries, rather than as they are today, places of lasciviousness and grotesquerie. the triumph of marmalade square in particular, fenced around with a rude wooden railing, interrupted by lumpfish brick piers at intervals of every half dozen yards, partakes more of the character of a pond than a partier. And that's for Kevin Costner square. It has very much the air of a sorry, cow yard, where black guards are to be seen assembled daily, playing at hustle cap up to their ankles in Maya and mud. And that's all we have time for this week. hooting yard we'll be returning next Wednesday at the same time. And of course, the show is repeated at 830 on Saturday morning, or at least it should be bye
