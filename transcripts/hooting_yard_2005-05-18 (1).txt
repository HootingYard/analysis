Good afternoon and here I am. Frank key with hooting out on the air. I'm going to read a single story this week. I think it takes about half an hour if it goes on too long I have to cut it and if it finishes early, I have something in reserve. Just one note about this story there's a character in it called Dobson. The Dobson in this story is not to be confused with the out of print pamphleteer. Think of it as evidence of my matchless ability to make up a character names. Anyway, this is this is a story called The Book of Nats. Originally published by flack and rather limited in 1926. The Book of NATS were written by the noted a Aviatrix and explorer mod glubb 1873 to 1958. Well known for her countless newspaper articles, travelogues and often indiscreet prefaces to other people's books. Maude glob wrote this her only work of fiction by the sputtering light of blubber candles. During the ill starred builds grew Antarctic expedition of 1911. Captain durveys bilge guru of the Royal scrofulous Hassan was, according to the dictionary of national biography, quote, perhaps the most incompetent person ever to lead a polar expedition, unquote. On the very day, the Explorer set out from the sprightly little port of mobster built grew burned all the charts broke the compass contaminated the pemmican supply and blinded the medical officer at the Commission of Inquiry held in 1913. Upon the expedition to return, he first insisted that these were unfortunate accidents, later changing his story under cross examination to play that he was only trying to run a tight ship. The full story of the disastrous expedition is told in kermans, polar habitude to the ends of the earth with a half wit, to which the listener is referred. mod glubb herself did not return to her homeland until 1919, for reasons which remain shrouded in mystery. Some reports have a leading rebel troops in the tantaran revolution of 1915. But they're unsubstantiated. glob herself never spoke of this missing period in her life. Her biographer, gravel slobber, despite years of prodigious research finally conceded that we're unlikely ever to learn precisely what happened to glove during this period. slobber notes that the great Aviatrix never intended the book of mats for publication. The manuscript was stored in a huge mahogany casket in the Belvedere of a country house, in which gloves friend laburnum bales worked as a piano tuner, interviewed shortly before her death in 1968. bales said that the manuscript would have remained forever locked away, had it not been for the intervention of crocus swac, sister of the notorious publisher, Toad collector and salt Wenceslas whack, like her brother crocus was both an alcoholic and a kleptomaniac at a weekend party hosted by bales his employer, she jimmied open the casket in the mistaken assumption that it contained a hidden supply of negus. Finding instead, the manuscript of the book of gnats, she stole it and later passed it on to her brother publisher in exchange for a crate of Grog. Why was Wenceslas swac interested in a virtually illegible manuscript every page blackened by blubber smoke, neither bales nor slobber can offer an adequate answer. Of course, glob was a public figure, and the newspapers often carried reports of her latest exploits, but flak and rubber had never published any fiction before. In those novel choked years, they had gained a reputation for issuing only ecclesiastical tract bell ringing manuals, and massive, erudite unreadable multivolume illustrated works on the obscure byways of beekeeping.

Whatever his reasons FLAC wrote to mod lab seeking have permission to publish by return of post he received an extraordinary reply. thanking him profusely commending his almost superhuman literary judgment, allowing him to edit the manuscript as he saw fit, and instructing him to pay all the royalties to a charitable institution for retired skin divers. glob always insisted that this letter was a forgery and pursued through ACH through the courts. In February 1928, two years after the book was published, she won her case swac and rather's remaining stock was pulped Glub. Her self employed a private detective named Dobson to track down and destroy all other copies of the book. Unless a man would have blanched at the prospect, but not Dobson. Within hours of accepting the job. He burgled the publishers offices coming away with sales, Ledger's files, invoices, receipts and threatening letters. His agents fanned out across the country, burning down bookshops, terrorizing librarians and breaking into houses at dead of night by staked out junk shops, bazaars and jumble sales. week by week, Dobson stuck pins into the enormous map on the wall of his office. As more and more copies were traced, purloined, ignited and obliterated he sent glubb regular monthly reports detailing successes, setbacks, near misses and red herrings when her money ran out, and she could no longer pay him. Dobson financed the operation himself. By November 1934, the task was complete swac and rubber had printed 10,000 copies of the book of Nats. And there were 10,000 pins in Dobson's map, a celebration fireworks party was held Glauben Dobson personally thanking all the agents who had been so unstinting in their efforts as they sapped IO and exchanged anecdotes. reliving the high points of the great pursuit. One agent remained strangely quiet, preoccupied. Ned mug bag, harbored a terrible doubt. One morning in July 1931, waking up in a grim Hotel in wicked Magna, Marburg had an attack of the jangles he was barely able to make it to the lobby. The standard procedure when an agent fell ill was to send Dobson a coded telegram, explaining that he would be out of action for a couple of days. Dobson was understanding. Usually he would arrange for a bouquet of petunias to be delivered with an encouraging note. On the other hand, if for any reason there was urgency, he would arrange for another agent to move in flame thrower at the ready. Fat heart an agonizing morning mud bag had not sent a telegram. Instead, his brain befuddled, he subcontracted the work to a complete stranger he met in the hotel lobby. It was madness. It was contrary to all his instructions to everything Dobson had ever taught him. Three years on poor mud bag could still not understand what on earth and made him do it. Yes, the stranger had seemed trustworthy. Yes, he had cradled mud bag in his arms and helped him back up to his room. Yes, he had spoon fed him custard and dabbed his feverish brow. But there was no excuse, and mudbug knew it. And he never had the courage to admit what he had done. The worst thing was the nagging doubt, he could never be certain that the copy of the book he was tracking that day have actually been destroyed.

Ironically, in view of what happened, the stranger was trustworthy. He listened attentively as my bag babbled the details of the task at hand. He swore that he would tell no one and he never did. He even gave away the crumpled banknotes which mud bag thrust into his hands to a pockmarked mendicant loitering outside the hotel. The stranger had only one floor. He was severely myopic. He nearly missed the library, entering the municipal baths by mistake, but a passing Jesuit stared him in the right direction. After an hour of squinting and peering along the shelves, the stranger located the book, he supposed, definitely concealed it under his Macintosh walks out of the library caught a bus to the town dump and unnoticed by the superintendent tossed onto the blazing bonfire. The stolen volume, a 1912 reprint of Schmid laps, the ambiguity of indigestion. The sole remaining copy of the book of gnats remained unburrow on the shelves of the wicked Magna Public Library until 1952 when it was withdrawn from stock and donated together with some 40 other bought books to the cardinal pre Mercy Home for demented paupers when that institution was closed down in 1966, its library was auctioned off. And the book of maps was part of a job lot bought by Grimes Pew, a secondhand book dealer with a shopping hooting yard. Pew died in 1973 and his business was taken over after much wrangling by Dr. f. x. duggleby, MD, who had been struck off the medical register in the same year for the illicit prescription of nose drops. duggleby his new career as a bookseller was not a success, and on New Year's Eve 1976 he closed up the shop, drank four pints of stout in a seedy tavern, threw himself into a canal and drowned. The shop was boarded up and the property condemned three days before demolition. A big van pulled up outside and took away the mildewed and rotting books which were piled in tottering heaps in the storeroom. Most of the stock ended up in a furnace, but sharp eyed scavengers plucked out the few volumes which were salvageable. The Book of mats was one of them. Eventually, by who knows what twists and turns, it found its way to a charity shopping pancakes were on the 14th of January 1987. I bought it for toughens. When some weeks later, I read the book I was thunderstruck. It seemed to be to be a work of art of the highest quality, tantalizing, majestic, profound and valiant. Since that first delirious reading, I have not shifted one jot for my opinion. At that time, I did not know the curious history of gloves masterpiece, but it did not take me long to discover that the book was long out of print, and unknown to seemingly all my literate cronies who are legion. I should explain that I am like swac, a publisher. I think it was during the fall autumn of 1988 that I decided to issue a new edition of the book of gnats. The previous summer had seen two of my titles selling unexpectedly high quantities, and for once I was flush with cash. I envisaged a deluxe edition bound in some exotic and possibly illegal animal hide with a cover designed by the noted gratia scrim jaw, a learned introduction by myself and an exhaustive commentary by gloves biographer gravel slobber. I'm a man of considerable integrity, and I did not wish to tempt the fate of Thrax addition by neglecting to seek permission from the copyright holders. Like most people, I was aware that mod glubb had met her death on the sixth of February 1958. She had accompanied the Busby Babes to their European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade. And on the return journey, she perished along with the flower of postwar British football in the Munich air disaster. apocryphal it may be, but I have heard that So Matt Busby's first words after the crash on coming to in the hospital ward were glob glob, glob.

Mood glob had died intestate, and she had no close relatives. The lawyers discovered that she appeared to have no distant relatives either. Despite the publicity surrounding her death, and a series of public announcements, notices in the press and radio bulletins, no one ever came forward to lay claim to her estate. No one that is except paitent frauds, such as a 12 year old boy from Idaho named Biff or chump, or some such epithet who was quickly revealed to be the victim of an experiment in mesmerism. His actions controlled by a sinister mastermind bent on world domination, this shadowy figure was apprehended and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Beth or Trump freed from his enhancement returns to Idaho, and when last heard of was a soda jerk, although quite what such a trade involves is not known to me. Control of gloves literary estate fell by who knows what our cane legal mechanism into the hands of a Dutch businessman named Yan Vander scrub. There. I have said the name of the monster who has reduced my life to misery and worse, far worse. deprive the world of the opportunity to read the book of gnats in its entirety. The three fragments which remain all which are all three fragments are all that remain of this work of towering genius. How so? Read on and I will tell you listen on. I'm going to have a sip of tea and we will listen on.

On Christmas Eve 1988 I received via a telephone call the information I had been waiting impatiently for weeks. tracking down gloves literary executor had been ludicrously difficult. But now at last I had a name and address. I fired off a letter to Vanda straw but once introducing myself, outlining my credentials, and proposing terms for the right to publish more gloves, only work of fiction. It was a polite businesslike letter, and I popped it in the post box on Christmas morning. On New Year's Eve, a sniper poised on a rooftop across the street shot me in the leg as I dangled my grandchild on my knee. seconds later, almost before I began to how I heard the unmistakable sound of a helicopter whirring above my house. It discouraged a troop of black clad commandos, who shimmy down rope ladders, kicked in my windows, and tumbled into my sitting room, panting and snorting like hogs. In my mind's eye, I see dozens of them, but I suppose they could only have been four or five. my grandchild scuttled for safety behind a large armchair. I was curled up on the floor, wailing hysterically and making rather a spectacle of myself. To my surprise, the commandos ignored me. Instead, they rampaged about the place, overturning furniture, smashing my ornaments and hurling books across the room. Next, NATS shouted one in a foreign accent. This was the first indication that the mayhem was in any way connected to mod gloves masterpiece, but I was in too much pain to notice it at the time. The commandos spent another half hour laying waste my house before departing through the windows herring up there rope ladders into the helicopter, which weld them away as suddenly as they had come. This extraordinary circumstance remained a mystery to me until some days later. The gunshot wound though bloody was superficial, and I was discharged from hospital after a few hours. I spent the first days of 1989 clearing up the mess. Then, on the fourth of January, I received another visit. This time at least my caller used a more conventional means of entry. He knocked at the door and waited to be allowed in. He even had a visiting card, an old fashioned touch of which I approved as he stood snuffling in the porch, I read it. It said, Gulliver, Whitlow, United Kingdom agent for Vanda strawbe International enterprises. Still with no thought in my head that the influenza racked gentleman in my porch had any connection with snipers or commandos. I showed him into my sitting room. How engaging I remember thinking for Vanda strobe to send an emissary was to be swiftly disillusioned. Whitlow refused to sit down, Sir, he said thickly. I believe you are in possession of a copy of the book of gnats by more glob published by flack and rather in 1920 6am. I correct. I nodded. Then our crack squad of commandos failed to discover this book when they visited you some days ago. Hence my visit. I must insist that you hand over to me the book together with any photos, stats and what have you this very instant you will have little difficulty imagining the parallettes which took place in my brain. Let's leap forward a minute or two. I have regained my composure outwardly. The book is not in my possession, Mr. Whitlow, I announced do not Dally with me, sir. The book is not in this house. If it was surely your band of thugs would have found it. commandos, not thugs commandos. he sneezed. Bless you, I said, I've always held great store by politeness. Very well spluttered Whitlow holding a surprisingly dainty handkerchief over his mouth. Where then is the book of gnats. is in a safe deposit box in an important in an important bank, I replied. I did not intend to divulge further details and half expected Mr. Winslow to start behaving like a comic book villain threatening me with unimaginable violence unless I spilled the beans. Instead still snuffling, he asked me if I have any aspirin. I told him that I allowed no such potions into my house. In that case, sir, I must bid you farewell. He said.

I showed him to the door and he was gone. In the next three days, every important bank in the country was looted by a skilled gang of thieves. The police were mightily puzzled by the fact that safe deposit boxes containing gold, jewels, cash, treasures and compromising documents were emptied, but their contents left strewn in heaps in the vaults. Nothing seemed was actually stolen. The newspapers hashed up this bizarre series of non robberies, so I did not find out about it until it was too late. On the third day, of course, Vanda scrubs minions have located my box, found my copy of the book of gnats and made away with it. To this day, I have not recovered it. I am a man bereft and you who tragically have not read this magnificent work may sympathize with my plight, but you cannot truly understand it. One day in February, I received a letter from Vanda strobe himself or innocence. He said that unfortunately, he was unable to grant me permission to reprint more gloves book for reasons bound up with the legal intricacies of her estate. Then, penciled in as a PS showing his true colors the Dutch hellhound had added. As for the manuscript, I personally incinerated it. The wreck one day, one day I shall assassinate him. After a prolonged stay in a home for the bewildered I set about rebuilding my life, I published books on ducks, spinette, and the great dismal Maroons, but glob, or rather, her book continues to haunt me. If only I had a good memory, I could recreate her timeless words in my head and damn Vanda strobe to perdition. But all that remains of the book of NATS are three paragraphs, which for some unknown reason, I copied out onto the crumpled wrapper of a boiled sweet during a thunderstorm in the summer of 1987. This scrap evaded the clutches of Vander strawbs, brutish pack, shoved as it was forgotten and unregarded in the tiniest drawer of my secret wall. So, listen to the sorry fragments and weep. And here are the only three fragments left of more gloves the book of NATS one, so was a tempest loosed upon the city, and its very fabric uprooted from the mud, whirling and howling, the city was dispersed upon the firmament coming to rest, none knew where, and the mud spawned all manner of noise and pests, squirming and wriggling to escape the gigantic puddles which were left in the wake of the storm. These were not puddles of water, no nor of any liquid known to the human mind. And then my eyes saw standing fiery on a wooden plinth ringed by puddles, the obscene figure a vinkle man. In his left hand, he brandished a loft a piece of burning linoleum. His right hand was made into a fist. As dribbling I watched, the fist was slowly opened to reveal. I cannot say, I do not know. For just at the moment, my piercing watery eyes could have seen that, that thing, I was startled by a toad which leapt up at my face and thrashed me on the forehead, leaving an imprint which remains there to this day, like a brand.

To the man with the toad Mark flapped his shattered wings in vain in vain, perched on the rock, beaten by harsh winds encrusted with seaweed blind, he was of a sudden assaulted by a voice roaring at him across 1000 continents. Man with the mark of the toad, no ye the song of the boll weevils. I then sing amii Singh whence came that monstrous voice? What hideous nursery had Casa said its owner what kitchen fed it man with the mark of the toad it screamed again. pulverizing universe's hair you to me now leave your drab rock shed your cracked wings, sprout fins smack the boiling sea with your flippers come to me.

I hope pigeons blood crayons and Ising glass, the eyes and glass gleams in a charming little handmade jar. The jaw has your mark on it man with the mark of the toad come. There were hours and hours of these wretched jibberish enough to make an ant die. The man with the toad Mark beat his useless wings against the wind and turned his head away. his brow was crawling with Nat that had come a long way from barely imaginable puddles of slop, where once a city had stood the city of NATS three vinculin strode importantly through the boulevards of the walled city, he chopped trinkets and baubles to beggars and cripples holding a vermilion cravat over his nose as he did so.

No more than 15 seconds passed before finkelman was greeted by his hosts, a swarm of gigantic gnats whose thrashing wings knocked him mercifully unconscious. Before they devoured him, every last bit of him, grinding him to dust between their powerful biting drawers. It was over in a flash, then buzzing and tagging, the swarm left the chamber as it entered through a shoot through a shoot through a shoot.

And that was the book of Matt, featuring a different Dobson. That's all from hooting out on the air for this week, and I'll be back next week with yet more pros. Bye for now.
