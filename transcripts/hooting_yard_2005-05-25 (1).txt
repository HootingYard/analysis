The time 1600 hours British summer time, the place a gleaming skyscraper in the middle of fashionable London town. The programme hooting yard on the air, the radio station resonance 104 point four FM, the presenter and only begetter. Me, Frank key. Good afternoon. This is a story for children, called Sidney the bat is awarded the Order of Lenin. So gather the little tots around the fire side. And listen to this story. Younger listeners possibly need to be remembered that the Order of Lenin was an award given in a 20th century regime known as the Soviet Union, which doesn't exist anymore. This is called Sydney the bat is awarded the Order of Lenin a tale for children. Like many bats, Sidney spent much of his time hanging upside down in a dark damp cave. both of his parents were still alive, and on Saturdays he would visit them. They lived in the attic of a museum and enjoyed swooping wings or flutter around the heads of any museum employees who came up to the attic, which was used as a clutter strewn storage area. The museum housed collections of electro magnetic operators galvanometers and cast iron mesmeric engines, it was the most renowned Museum of its kind in the land, numbering among its exhibit, not only von erichs patent transfer mechanism, but also an archive of papers from the Laboratory of the great salary scientist capisco. Professor Maude dweb was the chief curator. Her in tray was piled high with complaints about the bats in the attic. One young assistant janitor, on his first of a visit up there had been literally frightened out of his wits. He had been removed to a sanatorium in a remote mountainous country, and his family. Despite most of them being brain addled, had made known their intentions to prosecute the museum. One of the land's most relentless lawyers had already been paid a retainer. Professor dweb decided to act one Saturday evening, after the museum had closed, when to quote soon the full moon would swim up over the edge of the world and hang like a great golden trees. Quote, the words attributed to the shade of Oscar Wilde by the Spirit medium Hester travers Smith, the curator ascended the staircase to the gloomy attic. It was the work of minutes to set a number of backtracks in the darkness. As she made to leave, Professor dweb stumbled over a crate containing the world's only surviving example of pickerings superb a new hinge, banged her head on the wall and drop to the floor unconscious. Sydney's back parents swooped low and perched on her back. If bat perch I'm not sure about that. But if they do perch, they perched on more dweb back. At that very moment, Sydney flapped in through the skylight, he and his parents exchanged greetings in battle language. They told him what had happened to Professor dweb, who was sinking into a catatonic stupor. Sydney was most disappointed that he could not see any fan in flapping around someone who was unconscious. She wouldn't be scared at all. He resolved to arouse the curator, and at once began to make hideous back like squealing noises directly into her ear, flicking his wings against her temples. It took some time, but eventually more dweb woke with a start. Then she screeched flailing her arms. The mischievous bad, she fled the attic, slamming the trap door behind her, leaving the fiendish batch traps to do their work.

An hour later, she was back in the attic armed with a torch. She found Sydney hanging upside down from the rafters. Well, young bat she announced inadvertently you've performed a great service to your country. Had you not woken me for my stupor, thieves would have made off with the museum's most prized exhibit. I was only just in time to nab them. fleeing from you. I went downstairs to find a pair of counter revolutionary ne'er do wells about to make off with dodgy links anti imperialist galvanizing motor, you are as a mere bat, probably unaware that this machine is a potent symbol of our Glorious Revolution. I shall recommend to the general secretary of the party that you are given an Award in recognition of your deed well done. Sidney's parents patted him proudly on the head. Professor dweb dismantled the backdrops, the full moon shimmered through the skylight.

I have a letter from my old friend Max desharnais. The other day and I'd like to read it to you in full. Some years back, I bought an old book called New familiar and progressive English and French dialogues with dialogues on railway and steamboats traveling and a comparative table of monies and measure by Richard and Quetta. Published by Hachette in 1876. I was recently looking through it again and it remains one of the finest phrase books I've ever encountered. Some of it sounds like the dialogue from a porn film. For example, you oblige me in so willing a manner that it encourages me to apply to you again and again. I am delighted that you make use of me so freely. You may dispose of me as you will. It is impossible to do a favor in a more pleasing manner. I have never experienced such satisfaction. I believe I shall go mad with pleasure. Then there's the section entitled to express horror and fright. And it gives these examples. It is abominable, hurried, infamous. It is violating all what is most sacred in nature. It is enough to freeze one's blood with horror. There never was anything seems so abominable for mind revolts from the idea of such a crime. Or perhaps when visiting those tourist spots in Paris, and one feels the need to express displeasure and grief. These examples I am ruined beyond remedy. My misfortunes are at their height. I am swallowed up with affliction. After so many misfortunes, it only remains for me to die. Then select phrases for when one chances upon Michael Howard. His babbling absolutely splits my head. There is something repulsive in his address. It is difficult for me to surmount the disgust with which he inspires me. Has he sworn to teasers all day. Then, of course, when training for a post in the diplomatic service, there's the useful section headed of age and different periods of life. With these examples. Your aren't appears very aged. His brother who is younger than he is quite decrepit. He is in a state of extreme decay. He already has one foot in the grave. And of course, some random phrases which might come in useful among friends. What a quantity of asparagus and artichokes. My eldest sister had the whooping cough, the youngest had the measles, my eldest brother, the smallpox and the youngest a miliary fever. Shall I help you to undress? I will take charge of the bread and butter So, if ever you need to know the 19th century French expressions for Quinsey, colic tertian au hydrophobia, the falling sickness, scurvy, leprosy, the plague or dropsy, this book will be pleased to supply the answers. And in the section near the front where they're trying to teach the basics, there's a section called negatively and interrogative Lee, which reads a little like poetry. It goes like this. Have you know spoons? Have they know powder? Had he no scissors? Had we not looking glass? Had you know ribbons? Had they no chairs? Had he no reward? Had we no coaches? Will he have no Troika? Shall we not have curtains? Will you not have wax lights? Will they not have candlesticks? Would he have no pie?

I think the challenge would be to write a story composed entirely of the sentences for Max's phrase book. If I can do one under 700 words, in the next 48 hours I'll that might be something that I could use at an event, which I'm going to tell you about. I should remember to make this announcement before I forget. At on Friday evening, Friday the 27th I think, at 7pm on the second floor of foyles bookshop on Charing Cross Road. There's an event organized by Tales of the decongested, which is a London short story, organization. And I think they've been around for I think, possibly a year or so perhaps a bit less, perhaps a bit more. Tales of the decongested have these events in foyles bookshop on the last Friday evening of every month, and the one in two days time on Friday, the 27th is specially devoted to short, short stories. So all of the stories told on that evening will be under 700 words, one of them I'll be reading the one of my stories will be there, I shall be there. And I think it costs three pounds, or two pound 50 for concessions, and I'm sure it will be a splendid evening. Tales of the decongested and you can look them up on the web or@www.decongested.com. Anyway, here's a story which is a bit longer than 700 words. And it's all about football. Little is known of the origins of football, again, which is today one of the most popular sports throughout the northern lands. According to De Smet football began when tribal elders in the hinterland around Hoon took to mucking about after the annual ritual ostrich battering Thumper on the other hand, has argued in a number of persuasive essays, the sordid practices of a family living in a cave near bulges Spinney were the true origins of the game. Either of these theories may be true, as might 1000s upon 1000s of others. But let us not tarry in the past. The rules of football, a stupendously complex, the rubric itself fills hundreds of huge volumes, and interpretive texts, analyses and commentaries have accumulated at such a rate that entire libraries and are devoted to the subject. That being the case, it's impractical in this piece to do more than sketch the Marist outline. So let us draw breath take stock make a cup of tea Tango ukulele, skip frolicsome through Ling and haver rap curses at hunched louts sprinkled towel talc upon our scalps whisker egg brush our teeth in paella mothball cracker biscuit, mumble a homily tire ships not in a necklace.

there are two teams of 31 players each, plus a moderator to assistant moderators, a plinth sergeant, a Brazil nut attendant, and a person holding a tape measure. The teams are dubbed bark and sap. These terms are as arbitrary as the use of white and black to differentiate chess pieces, or the pigs and cones used in the game of Landon draw. Each team consists of 10 jack halibuts 10, Cicely Courtney badges, six badges, a winch, a hurdle, a cake, a denial and a pond. Only two badges may be fielded at one time, unless the winch is out of play. Players may make use of bats sticks, hooked poles, claw hammers, Lance's ball bearings, fence posts, swords, bayonets, door handles, fireworks and icing sugar. At the beginning of play, the moderator tosses onto the rink three balls, one is of leather, one of bladder, and one of zinc. Surprisingly, the rules say nothing about the size of the balls, and there is great variation among those commonly in use. The object of the game is for the barque team to puncture the lever and bladder balls beyond repair, and to hide the zinc ball for a period of 23 hours, while the sap team has tried to protect all three balls by putting them in wicker containers and keeping the opposing side away from them for an identical period. The field of play is called the pitch rink, arena, clat, Ford or basin. It is marked out with an intricate tangle of signs and symbols, and is usually waterlogged. A true appreciation of football is hampered by the difficulty of understanding the subsidiary objectives or planks as they're known of the game. Either of the assistant moderators may impose planks at the start of the game, or in the intervals between fits. There is an enormous list of planks and the rule books from which selections may be made. A brief sample here can do no more than suggest an idea of the subtlety of thought which has developed in this aspect of football over the years. taken at random. The list of planks includes the following data digging a trench across the rink, sawing off the handles of the opposing team swords, planning, preparing, cooking, serving and eating a garlic pie. synchronized palpitation, instilling an overwhelming sense of wistfulness in one's teammates, dismantling the wicket holding an accordion contest. Penalties for foul play a vicious, arbitrary and senseless. Only the moderator and the plinth Sergeant are permitted to impose penalties and they must consult with each other using an intricate system of hand signals before the penalty can be implemented. Please do not be given the impression that there is any element of violence and the penalties there viciousness, arbitrariness and senselessness are of a much higher order. inconceivable for those who have not themselves played the game. The kit or strip is of admirable simplicity, the sap team appears naked with the small concession to modesty of skin tight flesh colored tunics. In this case, flesh colored means precisely what it says. The garments are dyed to the exact shade of the individual players skin by experts retained by the Football Association. The bark team on the other hand, is kitted out in voluminous clothing suitable for an Antarctic Expedition, or fers hi hides and swaddling with plenty of pockets pouches, flaps, zips buttons toggles belts and buckles. As the game is played throughout the year, the sap team has a natural advantage in the summer months, while the bark team will tend to perform better in the biting chill of winter.

But enough of these confounded rules, as it is their elastic very elastic. So much depends upon the temperament of the Brazilian that attendant in whose hands the very nature of the game can be transformed, to the extent that the rules I have so patiently explained would be unrecognizable to you, dear listener, the commentaries on the role of this official, abstruse and profound and are deserving of years and years of study bagshawe and Tableau in their invaluable tome, the Brazil nut attendant, retribution and paralysis have come closest to providing a manageable overview of the topic, although their tendency to refer to the game as soccer is regrettable. So before bringing this piece to a sprightly close, it will be helpful to give the reader some idea of the games organization, particularly in the professional sphere, the two Chief Administrative bodies of the Football Association and the Football League. The format is a severe and monolithic body which ensures that the rules of the game are adhered to by all parties at all times. It has a staff of over 800 scriveners Clark's and lackeys who work by the light of just for Tilly lamps. These saintly men and women spend their working lives issuing lengthy directives couched in the language, so mesmeric that the recipients throw them up ones into the dustbin, without even trying to bring any sense out of them. This cavalier attitude has its repercussions of course, from time to time, the associate the association sends out special inspectors highly trained gets plucked from sinks of corruption with murder in their hearts and blackjacks in their fists. No football club visited by a Special Inspector as ever dead transgress the rules again. The association holds an annual competition, the winning team of which is awarded the Fred Jessen cup, named after Laura's husband in the film brief encounter. The cap is a model of a pollarded Willow, made out of battered tin. Bird holes mighty six volume from custody to wooziness provides a splendid history of the contest and bravely addresses the more arcane aspect of the marking system, contemplation of which has led countless devotees to a sordid Brink sudden demise. So that's the football associate association of the Football League. However, there is nothing remotely interesting to be said.

Here for your edification and instruction. I'm going to begin again because I said I said that in a very strange way, sort of started a bit. I'm going to begin again, hold on. Here, for your edification and instruction, is a translation of the war song of the wits. nohoch taken from Rig Veda americanas sacred songs of the ancient Mexicans, number eight in Britain's library of Aboriginal American literature, edited by dg Brinton and published in 1890. And this is the translation and each verse is numbered one what Whoa, my work is in the hole of arms. I listened to no mortal nor can any put me to shame. I know none such I am the terror. I know none other. I am where war is. My work is said to be in the hall of arms. Let no one cursed my children. To adornment comes from out the South it is varied in color as the clothing of the eagle. Three Whoa, whoa. abundance of youth doubly clothed. A Raven feathers are my captives. I deliver them up. I deliver them up my captives arrayed in feathers. For home, use youth have a quits now whack a raid in feathers. These are my captives. I deliver them up. I deliver them up a raid feathers, mic captives? Five youth from the south arrayed in feathers, my captives, I deliver them up. I deliver them up arrayed in feathers, my captives. Six, the god enters the Wits Nat HVAC he descends as an example, He shines forth, He shines forth, descending as an example seven, adorned like us, he enters as a god, he descends as an example, He shines forth, He shines forth, descending as an example so that we have the war song of the quits now whack from which I get the impression that the gods descends as an example and shines forth. And meanwhile, the youths arrayed in feathers are delivered lap, delivered up as captives, Arabian feathers delivered up anyway. An adaptation of the war song of the Whitner whack, with slightly amended word is slightly amended words and sung to the tune of carry on wayward son by stadium rockers Kansas, has been heard around hooting yard every day for the past couple of months. Ever since pansy cradle, Drew became an adaptive goon Fang, often confused with the traditional martial arts of the East. goon Fang is, as David Bowie once said, so regrettably, a completely different kettle of plants on I asked pansy to explain for listeners what it means to be an adept of this ancient mystic art. She couldn't come on the program, but she scribbled a few words on the discarded wrapper of a toughy apple. as follows. I'll read them out. She wrote. It is not without reason that goon Fang is shrouded in mystery. For when the powers of both goon and Fang are combined, the adept enters the plane of Verbeek, a state of being both terrifying and a bit frightening. If I tell you anything more, my goon energy will be dissipated, and my Fang plasma will curdle. The plasma is of course, invisible and mighty. But should it curdle, the very stars in their heavens will explode. So I'm keeping mum for the time being.

And that's all pansy wrote. She did agree, however, to allow a photograph of a trainee goon Fang workshop to appear on the hooting yard website. So perhaps you should go there and have a look. That's it. www No, it's not actually I'm going to start again, it's not there's no www in the hooting yard address. It's just hooting.yard.users.bt open world.com. So go go visit there, which is been resuscitated back to life in the last couple of days. And another reminder about decongest the tails of the decongested at foyles bookshop second floor, Friday evening, seven o'clock. And that's all for this week, actually. So hopefully many listeners will go away and become a depth of goon Fang before next week. Goodbye.
