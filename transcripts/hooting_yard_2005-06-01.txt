Good afternoon. My name is Frankie and this is hooting yard on the air as ever, a cornucopia of stories real Yes, it's story time this week, and I'm going to begin with a story called an outing. Listen tiny ones. If you are good, I will take you on an outing. I will take you to the old balsa wood factory on the edge of the Big Blue Lake. Every Thursday afternoon at two o'clock, there is a tour of the factory especially for Tots for Hooters sound, and everyone lines up at a kiosk in the car park, and Mr. verdigris appears in his towering hat with bells on his sleeves and ribbons and bunting and hamsters nestling in his pockets. And he takes the lucky people, the ones with tickets on a tour of the factory. I was sent some tickets in the post yesterday as a special treat. Now, I know that Tim the radio meteorologist says that Thursday will be a day of driving rain and howling gales and I know that it will be the fourth day of our fast and we will be famished but I'm determined that we go. The alternative is that we spend yet another afternoon trying to tether the wild goats. And I'm not sure I can take much more of that. So the balsa wood factory it will be first there was the grass verge of the carpark and then alone. Some derelict outbuildings including a shed were in rotted the remains of the hanged janitor and then the factory itself. Its cavernous interior lit by 1000s of gas jets, and eerily silent save for the occasional buzzing of a sore or the distant insistent pounding of a pulper from the annex over beyond the railway tracks, a sound bornean on the wind. After that, up the metal Stairway to the offices always deserted on Thursday afternoons, even tiny infant shoes making the floorboards creak and shelves upon shelves stacked with Higgledy Piggledy piles of files and papers and dockets. And Mr. verdigris took the hamsters from his pockets, and place them on a bed of straw next to an important looking desk. Its surface polished to such a gleam has left the children dumbfounded and resting on it, nothing but a fat new fountain pen, and the biggest bottle of ink you could imagine, and the pen had never been used, and the bottle never opened. For the lids of both were jammed by dint of mischievous sprites that scampered in the rafters overhead. And it was up to the rafters now, up to the attic, past boxes and crates filled with rusty and inexplicable machines, redundant cash registers and forgotten magnetic recording devices through a narrow corridor littered with broken brooms and hosts to a mysterious gurgling noise until we reached the chamber the end and our tour guide in his towering hat, kicked open the door Oh so violently, and we entered a room lit in a blue blue glow like heaven. And they're in the corner, sprawled on a divan. We saw Pinocchio dexterously plucking flies out of the blue air with his tiny fingers and biting the tiny head of each tiny fly with his tiny teeth. Pinocchio, they're like all the stories that I read or at least most of them.

Unknown Speaker  04:58
You can read them yourself. If you can't memorize them, you can read them for yourself on the hooting yard website which is at HTTP, colon forward slash our house, whatever that whatever the convention is, followed by hooting.yard.users.bt openworld.com. And speaking of the website, I had a letter the other day and that letter, I think it's of complaint. I'm not sure. Paul Emerson, never London and for wrote rather tersely, it must be said, Dear hooting yard.

Unknown Speaker  05:39
I have a swan to cook. The recipes are not on the website. Paul. That's what Paul wrote. There's a very good reason why there are no Swan recipes on the website. Paul, all of us here at hooting yard are very proud to support the eating swans is unacceptable campaign, and we've signed up to its charter. Most of us were the campaign ribbons which as you know, come in the form of a purple eating swans is unacceptable ribbon large enough to be wrapped around one's head as a bandana or head scarf. so keen Are we on this cause that next month or possibly the month after, we will be holding a special hooting yard open day all the proceeds from which will be donated to the campaign. Mrs. gubbins is in charge of the event, and she will be issuing a bulletin decorated with embroideries and brass rubbings of swans very very soon. Meanwhile, Paul Emerson of London and for please take your Swan to the Peter Maxwell Davis Swan sanctuary as soon as you can. Sir Peter, the master of the Queen's music has of course been known to eat the occasional Swan himself. See, for example, a story which you can follow a link on the hooting yard website a story called roasted swan song. Peter Maxwell Davis gets into legal trouble over an ill fated waterfowl. Apparently, he found a electrocuted whooper Swan and ate it. Anyway, yes, Peter Maxwell Davis has been known to eat the occasional Swan himself. But we sent little severing the mystic badge around a stare at him with honoring reproach for days on end. So he's seen the error of his ways, thank goodness. One of the great things about this show sometimes is the way that one theme segues into another. So we had swans and now we have a story entitled grebe. Both birds you see very, very well thought out very carefully calculated. Anyway, this is called grieb. The ghostly grebe that haunted the windswept coast of flapping never frightened Gunter the pipsqueak, Gunter had a rare medical condition, he was unable to perceive birds with any of his senses, including the sixth. Although he was a pipsqueak good to have an active Sixth Sense, as well as an eerie and befuddling Seventh Sense. But arion befuddling as it was, it was also incapable of apprehending any of the myriad forms of birdlife with which our planet is blessed. Or some would say,

Unknown Speaker  09:13
cursed.

Unknown Speaker  09:16
I think I must have been about 40 before I learned that there are people who hate birds. Of course, there are many folk who are frightened of all things avian, but theories not hate or not exactly. I was to discover, however, that there exists a subculture of bird haters, or more accurately, owl haters. They have their own samizdat Journal of surprisingly elegant typographic design, entitled The samizdat Journal of owl haters, which is available on subscription. Despite not having a clue what an hour was because of his medical condition. Gunter was a keen reader Have the journal for he had somehow got it into his head that through its lonely owl hating hearts columns, he might find himself a wife. He spent long evenings in his wood cutters cottage on the edge of the flapping forest, poring over the advertisements and penciling across next to the ones that attracted him. But so shy was he that he could never pluck up the courage to pick up the metal Tapping Machine to make contact. One Easter Sunday, after a night made miserable for all but Gunter by the Skirling of the ghostly grieb. That pipsqueaks Mar confronted him in his workshop. She was a splendid an example of genteel decay as one was ever likely to meet, and Gunter found himself trembling whenever she came a visiting. On her wrist, she wore a little leather cuff on which perched her tame Hummingbird. But of course, her son knew this not this morning. The purpose of her visit was to persuade Gunter to place his own advertisement in the personal columns. Knowing that he was functionally illiterate, she offered to write something for him. After 10 scans, she did so. A few weeks later, I was skulking along the sand banks on the flapping coastline. Armed with my ectoplasm bottling jar and a pair of spirit binoculars, hoping to catch a glimpse of the ghostly grebe. I sat down to rest on a sitting place, and a gust of wind blew a scrap of paper into my hair. It was a page torn from the samizdat Journal of owl haters. A publication new to me of as I read it with the avid curiosity, which is my defining quality. Here is what I read. pipsqueak oblivious of birds seeks soulmate, avid curiosity preferred contact metal Tapping Machine number 87341. I never did see the ghostly grebe. But within a week, dear reader, I'm married Gunter. And we have lived happily ever since in the woodcutters cottage, on that wind swept and griep haunted coastline.

Unknown Speaker  12:55
And

Unknown Speaker  12:56
this segue is from grebes to Dobson, which doesn't have quite the same beauty but it's something anyway, this is a about Dobson on sport. Dobson rarely showed any interest in sport. He did once begin an essay called why we say sport and maths while Americans say sports and math. But he wrote no more than four or five sentences before abandoning it. marigold Chu gives a fascinating insight into the workings of Dobson's pulsating cranium when she describes what happened next, I'd like to quote from her piece now. She writes, in spite of the fact that he had fed his scribblings into the fire, the mere act of writing the words sport and sports two or three times sent Dobson whirling off on a new track. It was a morning of torrential rain, as usual, but Dobson, Donda Macintosh and stomped out of the house. He was gone for hours. When he returned sopping wet, he announced that he intended to write an encyclopedia of sport based on an entirely novel classification. Instead of categorizing sports into team and solo games, those using balls and those shooing them, those that require bats, rackets, sticks and pucks, and those that don't. His work would instead approach the topic from what he called, somewhat immodestly, I felt a dog sonian angle.

Unknown Speaker  14:41
swallowing

Unknown Speaker  14:42
a mouthful of toasted blob cake. I asked him what he meant. He fixed me with those beady yet watery eyes and announced that he had while walking along the lane that leads to the ruinous sump devised six bags of sporting activities. spindly, apprehensive, dashing, clotted, baleful and monkey like there was no known human sport he shouted growing hot with excitement his arms windmilling, which could not be leave it into one of these categories. And his task would be to draw out to the earth characteristics of each past time. I tipped my plate of cake crumbs into the sink and asked the pamphleteer where in this system, he would place the various activities at a medieval torgny where lusty Jacqueline swains would tilted bagatelles and gamble with partridges, et cetera, et cetera. Dobson did not reply. Later that day by a curious COVID. In coincidence, he was attacked by a flock of partridges while waiting at the bus stop there after at least for the next few months. All his attention was fixated upon birds, and the sport encyclopedia was quietly forgotten. That's the quotation from marigold to, and devotees of Dobson will of course, be aware that the bird fixation period to which he refers resulted in some of the great man's best love pamphlets, including the matchless, how I was attacked by a flock of partridges at a bus stop, while on my way to the potato club, out of print. I'd like to continue with two quotations from other authors. The first is from Sydney DRI Fisher, from his book The Quaker colonies, and he writes, the German mind was then at the height of its emotional, unrestrained, and it produced a new sect or religious distinction almost every day. Many of these sects came to Pennsylvania, where new small religious bodies sprang up among them after their arrival, shrank Felder's tankers, the lab artists newborn new mooners, separatists, Zions brooder auronzo, Darfur inspired quietist, gift aliens, dip aliens, Mountain Men, river brethren bryndza Brethren, and the Society of the woman in the wilderness a names which occur in the annals of the province. And completely unrelated to that quotation is a great quote from how k wells and it reads as follows how k Wells was a pulp writer. Carlin's deep shadow dies with flaming pools of Mad menace. I could shoot you both down where you stand he rasped but that would be a foolish waste of valuable material. I shall turn the two of you over to the dweller in the pool. Dorothy lane cried aloud in terror. Carlin's thin lips rived in a snarling smile. Who or what is the dweller in the pool? demanded Kent. And what devil's work is Carlin doing here anyway? The dweller in the pool? Dorothy answered her low voice trembling is my brother, Raul. Small wonder that the throbbing agony of so many tortured minds should combine to taint the very air with a shuddering miasma of crepitus and dread. Isn't that marvelous? How k wells that's from a that's from a story by how Kay wells entitled black pool

Unknown Speaker  19:16
for hell maidens. He was a very measured writer and black pool for hell maidens, which includes chapters entitled The Claude ghoul House of grisly fear and Mad Pack of the maimed was the first in his series of gods to British seaside resorts, all of them featuring both hell maidens and the enigmatic role. Later titles included skag ness for hell, maidens, tot nez for hell, maidens and Raul and the hell maidens go wild in the great yar mouth

Unknown Speaker  20:43
is a story which does not have any kind of segue to it, which will use that word far too often today anyway, this is called glib Hatter one of the stories I grew up with that I heard 100 times at my mother's knee was the tail of the glib Hatter. When I say, at my mother's knee, I'm using a cliche Of course, for one thing, I didn't literally squat at my mother's knee. And in any case, she had two knees. If I wanted you to picture me so many years ago, hearing the tail of the globe Hatter, and if I had squatted as indicated, I would have been precise and written at my mother's left knee or at my mother's right knee, not just at my mother's knee. Unless of course she had only one the drew to amputation of one of her legs above the knee, which was happily not the case. Although even if it were it would still be proper to indicate which knee the left or the right she retained, after old Mr. sawbones chop the leg with the other one off and put it on a pyre to be burned. I heard my mother tell me the tale of the glib Hatter many times, but usually when I was tucked up in bed, under my blankets, ready for sleep. In fact, almost always I drifted into sleepy land while my mother was in the middle of the story. Sometimes, she would only get as far as the bit where the glib Hatter steals a basket of potatoes from the ice maiden if I was a little more alert, for example, if I snuck into the pantry before bed and help myself to a few glucose tablets, which are sometimes did for I craved glucose as a child, and still do, I might be able to remain awake for as long as it took my mother to reach the point in the story, where the glib Hatter is attacked by a bison out on the savanna. But usually I was so exhausted from my Canadian Air Force exercises that my eyelids were drooping. Almost as soon as that dulcet voice said once upon a time there was a hatter and the Hatter was glib. I do want you to be able to picture me all tucked up listening to my bedtime story. It's important that you can see in your mind's eye, the blankets, the bed, the carpet and the curtains, the floor, ceiling and walls, the chair and chest of drawers, and only other things in the room and may with my towel mop of hair snug on the pillow. And my mother sat by my bedside her hair in a bun and her smoke filthy from cooking. One plump hand holding the book and the other plump hand holding a torch. It's faint beam aimed at the page from which he is reading. For we had no electricity in the house. We relied on that one torch and many many candles. I forgot to say that there would always be a dog on the floor at the foot of the bed. It was a massive diff call Bob. My mother insisted in later years that it was named after President Nixon's disgraced indeed imprisoned Chief of Staff, HR Baba Haldeman. But she was wrong. She was oh so wrong. The master was called Bob for quite a different reason. It saddened me in those later years to argue over this so violently with my dear mother. After all those hours she had spent reading the tale of the glib Hatter to me by torchlight while I fell asleep in my bedroom on the attic floor of the House on the edge of the marshes. That crumbling house that stood all alone, surrounded by a will of the wisps, and eerie flickering lights. I remember that once I managed to stay awake for the whole story. My mom began to read after giving me my tumbler of hot milk at around nine o'clock. It was winter. So all right. pitch dark outside. mercifully, the shutters were closed tight, and all the doors have been locked and double locked. The only sounds with a tick tock of the clock on my bedroom wall, the wheezing breath of Bob the Mastiff at the foot of my bed, and faintly in from across the marshes far, far away, the bellowing of old farmer frac barnyard animals as he heard them from one field to another, back and forth, over and over again, for no apparent purpose.

Unknown Speaker  25:35
One of the first things I've ever learned was the old farmer frack was a mad old man, and they never I ever came face to face with him. I should turn and run like the wind. I don't know why I was so wakeful that night. Why I listened so intently as my mother reached the bit about the ice maidens, potatoes, and then the bison attack. And still I like why died lapping up every detail, new things I had never heard before, because I always dropped off. Things like the glib Hatter falling down a pothole, and eating lettuce, and the blind man getting his hair cut, and 1000s of frogs, and the part where the glib Hatter cheats at cards when playing whist with the widow, and the village where all the children were pointy caps, and the adventure of the pit pony and the part where a vaporous apparition of Ringo Starr floats over the rooftops and the glib Hatter gets mixed up with a lacks Potter and the shrubs and fire storms and cartoni Aster and clay and architecture, and a new serum and Klondike Gold, and cows and crows and bauxite, and bird seed, and huge ponds filled with teardrops, millions and billions of teardrops in millions and billions of sad and salty palms. I think it must have been about four o'clock in the morning when my mother read, and that is the end of the story of the glib Hatter and she extinguished the torch and kissed my forehead, and I shut my eyes at last and fell asleep.

Unknown Speaker  28:08
I'm gonna read this piece very quickly because we haven't got that long left. It's called crumpets and banners. Now and again, it will do you the power of good to spend a Wednesday morning cramping along a high Ridge blowing a trumpet and waving a banner. If you can persuade others to join you so much the better. It will not matter if you're tumulus and raggle taggle, the experience itself can pump vital energy into your blood oxygenating your brain and feeding crucial nutrients into your integuments. You know, I'm not going to continue with this story. I'm going to wait until next week. That because that stands by itself that paragraph because it's the advice I was given by my mentor, or at least by a book handed to be by my mentor on the day I said farewell to him for the last time. So to find out what I did about that advice. You'll have to listen to hooting yell on the air at four o'clock in the afternoon on Wednesday, next week. And that's all for now remember that if all is well the show will be repeated at 830 on Saturday morning.

Unknown Speaker  29:21
And

Unknown Speaker  29:22
now I'm going to go away and leave you with the Caucasian vallabhbhai by slap happy and Henry cow as ever. Bye
