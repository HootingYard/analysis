Good afternoon. My name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air, half an hour of prose read to you by the author. Last week, those of you who were listening last week may remember that I ended with a quotation and then didn't have time, there was no time left in the show because it had been so packed. There's no time left in the show to continue. So I'll just read that quotation again, and then explain it. Now and again, it will do your power of good to spend a Wednesday morning tramping along a high Ridge, blowing a trumpet and waving a banner. If you can persuade others to join you so much the better. It will not matter if you are tuned verse and raggle taggle, the experience itself can pump vital energy into your blood oxygenating your brain and feeding crucial nutrients into your integuments that is the advice I was given by my mentor, or at least by a book handed to me by my mentor. On the day I said farewell to him for the last time. It was not a day I'm ever likely to forget. After the dawn calisthenics, we had sausages for breakfast. I have never tasted the like before or since God only knows what they were made of. Ambrosia perhaps or Manor. My mentor was kind enough for once to overlook my disgusting table manners, even going so far as to hand me several extra extra napkins from his precious supply. When I had finished mopping up my drool and spillages he beckoned me with the claw

Unknown Speaker  02:03
of gak

Unknown Speaker  02:04
and we headed off up into the hills to that layer of his which until now had been forbidden to me. Had I not eaten such a gigantic breakfast, my heart would have been palpitating. As it was, my corporeal being was preoccupied with its digestive functions, freeing my brain to do the palpitations. Once inside the layer or cave, my mentor handed me a trumpet and a banner and the book which I have already mentioned. And then he vanished in a puff of inexplicable Rosi eight vapor. I was alone. I waited for the vapor to disperse, and then I strode out of the cave. No, I mustn't lie, I missed out of the cave. And I tumbled down the hillside, battering my trumpet in the process. And I rummaged around in my mentors pantry until I found more sausages. And while I cooked them, I practiced a few tips on the trumpet. And I read the book, The passage quoted above comprises the complete text. And then I unfold my banner. And when I had finished eating all of the sausages, I set out to make my own way in the world.

Unknown Speaker  03:56
Much of the rest of today's show is going to be devoted to four interlinked stories or interlinked pieces of prose. I'm not entirely sure what interlinks that maybe will all become clear. But anyway, take them one at a time. And if there's time at the end, then there'll be some more, but we'll we'll take this the first piece is called how I plunged into the bottomless Viper pit of God. For too many years to count, I traveled the world visiting bottomless Viper pits. I studied them, sketched them, photograph them, and wrote up lengthy and detailed descriptions of each and every one. My patience is almost inhuman, and it needed to be because sooner or later some well meaning numbskull would ask in relation to vissel that bottomless Viper pit Tell me Professor bindweed if the Viper pit is bottomless, we're in heaven's name of the Vipers. And each time I would sigh and give my interlocutor a look of saintly forbearance and reply on ledges Of course, from very near the top and then intervals of a few feet all the way down. For in my experience, this was invariably the case from the bottomless Viper pit of hooligans Wharf to the bottomless Viper pit of San Cristo bool. And then one day, armed only with the shreds of a map and a flask of brackish water. I came upon the bottomless Viper pit of Gar. One thing you must understand is that I had been at this work for so long, that very little surprised me anymore. So please do not think I'm exaggerating when I say that I was thunderstruck. But dazzled, giddy and incredulous, for I was all of those things and more. The amazing thing about the bottomless Viper pit of Gar, was that it had been turned into a sort of tourist attraction. Offense had been placed around it. Gigantic, gaudy signs flashed on and off, and fairground music bled out of stacks of loudspeakers. to exploit one of the remotest bottomless Viper pits in the world for commercial gain seemed wrong to me, and suddenly drained of my inhuman patients. I marched up to the person standing behind the counter of the ticket booth. I ranted and raved at him for at least five minutes shouting my head off and flailing my arms. And do you know what? He took absolutely no notice of me. This enraged me further, and I was about to give him a clean decent sock on the jaw. When I heard running footsteps behind me, and a withered voice croaking. Wait, wait. And I turned to see an unkempt beanpole of a fellow hastening towards me. He slowed up wheezing, and staggered the last few steps. Because I don't harm the lad, please, sir. He's a good worker takes the cash and hands out the tickets. His name is Tommy. He's a deaf, dumb and blind kid jaw plays a main pinball. I looked back at the urchin and sure enough, he bought a striking resemblance to Roger Daltrey circa 1969.

Unknown Speaker  07:43
I had rumped

Unknown Speaker  07:46
would you won't be wanting to buy a ticket then sir, asked to the beam pole.

Unknown Speaker  07:53
I think my reply

Unknown Speaker  07:54
a speech based on a lecture I had given at the bottom this Viper pit club of Helsinki a decade ago, took about an hour to deliver. I'm not sure how much of what I said got through to the lanky in great. I do know that he sat down on a nearby tuffet as exhaustion setting that Tommy packed up and went home that I inserted some new rhetorical tricks into my tirade, that clouds scattered across the sun, and that the sun itself set before I had finished. My listener had now fallen into a deep sleeper sprawl his tuffet. ignoring him, I clambered over the wicked gate that the pinball wizard had locked before he left and approached the bottomless Viper pit of Gar with mounting excitement. It was dark, and I had no torch, but I picked my way carefully towards the edge of the bottomless Viper pit. I laughed aloud with glee as I heard the familiar hiss of countless pit Vipers. The years seem to fall away, and I felt again that tingle of amyloid happiness that I experienced when, as a spindly 12 year old, I had accompanied my father to the bottomless Viper pit of shrubbery ness, my very first bottomless Viper pit. A knot of nostalgia tightened in my stomach. I put my hand up to my hat and doffed it. It was my father's hat, the one he had given to me on that very day, the same hat, which he had brandished to ward off a particularly malevolent pit viper that was about to sink its fangs into my heart. I dropped my father's hat, and I plunged into the bottomless Viper pit of Gar

Unknown Speaker  10:08
So that was the first in this set of four pieces. Bear in mind that they were originally written for the page as opposed to being read. So there are bits in them that may read or sound to the listener as if they're on the page, you get the idea. All of them of course are read are there for you to read on the hooting yard website at HTTP, colon forward slash whatever it is hooting.yard.users.bt openworld.com you can read all of these texts there. Meanwhile, here's the second piece which is called misprint. That piece by Professor bind weed, how I plunged into the bottomless Viper pit of Gar, contained a number of errors. These were due to production problems, escaping gas, unexpected tea bag mishap and the distractions of acquire belting out Shenandoah at top volume. At hooting yard, however, we pride ourselves in setting the record straight at the very earliest opportunity. In the printed version, there were three misprints and they were of a kind, as several readers pointed out with commendable promptness. There are no bottomless Viper pits at a hula Huns, Wharf, or shrubbery ness, and there is no such places San Cristo bool let us take each one of those in turn in reverse order. San Cristo bool does not exist, at least not in any Atlas I know of and it's difficult to know which bottomless Viper pit Professor bind we'd had in mind. It may Of course, be an anagram of bassoon clot Shire, but my well founded Gazetteer of that bosky paradise on earth states specifically on page 1249. That, and I quote, there are no Viper pits in the county, bottomless or otherwise. For shrubbery ness, read living sand ends. Think for one minute that there could be a bottomless Viper pit at Oh hooligans Wharf is so preposterous. I'm surprised that the globe kept spinning on its axis after that appeared. As soon as the error was brought to my attention. I fired off an apology to the five fiendish burgers of a hula Huns Wharf, terrified as I was of swift and brutal reprisals. And I received a very gracious acknowledgement, which I'm happy to read out on the air. It reads as follows. Okay, oui oui oui, oui, oui. The five fiendish burgers of our hula Hannes Wharf, that is first Gods Soke second pardue third can sigma Bal badet. Fourth, Pip, and fifth. Billy Strayhorn, do hereby say to you in arch, lewd, monstrous grating swine ish implacable horse declaration. And then in the Yulia library incantation of a meridian that we we we we we have taken under our biases and tunics the sentiments of your piteous government. And oui oui oui oui oui. The five fiendish burgers of our hooligans Wharf have pronounced it good. battalions of the Oh hooligans Wharf Avenger platoon have been called off before they even had time to mount their hideous macro answer. phallic horses.

Unknown Speaker  14:06
Yes.

Unknown Speaker  14:07
The hideous macro answer phallic horses with their fierce biting spittle flecked fangs that gallop at double the speed of light. Don't let it happen again. So that was the response I got and I promised my new powers the five fiendish burgers of Oh hooligans Wharf, who promised to come round to tea. Later on the day, that I write something accurate and complimentary about our hooligans Wharf in the very near future.

Unknown Speaker  14:59
Moving on Then, this place begins with a quotation from a very old book by Antoine Simone Maya, which is an account of the customs and manners of the MC Mackey's and marriage cheats. Savage nations now dependent on the government of Cape Breton and may are wrote who does not know that the low burlesque word of Hocus Pocus is an humorous corruption of their hock so corpus mayhem, by virtue of which they make a God out of a vile wafer, and think it finally solved by calling it a mystery. Which by the way, is but another name for nonsense. Is there anything amongst the savages half so absurd? Or so empires? So anyway, speaking of vile wafers reminds us that vile is one of the varieties of wafer available from the kiosk behind the post office, you know, hooligans Wharf. Unlike most wafers, which tend by definition to be thin, the viral wafer is thick, as thick as thick as the old Penguin, penguin English library edition of Moby Dick or the whale by Herman Melville, which with its introduction and commentary by Harold Beaver, comes to over 1000 pages. If I may digress for a moment, I've always been enamored of Mr. beavers note on the line on page 504. All bats and I'ma crow. The note is Mr. beavers note appears on page 885 of the penguin English library edition. And he writes as crow to the house of Caudill in the world Woods the last day of the year, Pip prophecies Doom all turned to bats at dusk, all screwy world all mad. According to the Oklahoma hands Wharf Market Research Bureau, whose office by the way is a shabby lean to tacked on to the post office. Sales of vial wafers it down this year, a worrying trend given that wafers in general are enjoying peak performance in the economy of this godforsaken hellhole by the boiling see. Forgive a very brief second digression. I know I said that I would write something complimentary about hooligans wolf but you know sometimes the truth will out. Anyone examining the pie charts, graphs, blots, man diagrams, and other impenetrable flummery in the latest edition of the Oh hula homes Wharf Market Research Bureau Bulletin of underlying trends in trading patterns of wafers from the kiosk behind the post office. As I have done repeatedly, we'll find it hard to disagree with the view of one focus group member who is reported as saying no one wants to buy the vial wafers because there is thick as a hefty paperback and we prefer our wafers thin. Is that so wrong? So the latest tracker poll suggests that the most popular wafers are hot wafers, clinging wafers, gas enhanced wafers, pituitary gland wafers, Pip strewn wafers, and tellingly are pads special wafer thin wafers. The latter, for example, outsold vile wafers by more than 10,000% if that actually means anything arithmetically or mathematically or both. I'm particularly charmed by the bulletin's graphic illustrating this point, because if you turn it sideways, it looks like a cartoon face of Jeb McGruder of Watergate fame. I dropped my copy of the bulletin into a puddle of bubbling viscous green fluid outside the convent of Our Lady of resignation and dismay. So unfortunately, I wasn't able to reproduce it on the hooting God website. But instead there's a photograph of Jeb McGruder taken before he went to prison and became a born again Christian.

Unknown Speaker  19:22
Interestingly, there are distinct parallels between the wafers on sale you know, hula hoops, Wharf and the Watergate scandal, not least among them being the kiosks owner's name is Chuck Colson just like President Nixon's special counsel. Now, our Colson the wafer merchant is a lifelong resident of Oh hooligans Wharf, and indeed, has only left That wretched Brian soaked eyesore once in his life, when he was mistaken me call to testify before judge john J. circa the hearings in Washington DC. Thankfully, the error was realized while killed Man was waiting at the railway station in strontium 90 Township just a few miles away. He returned home the same day, celebrating his near brush with fame by tucking into a slap up dinner of baked Swan Allah Maxwell Davis. Personally, I find it just a little unsettling that Colton never eats his own wafers, even the wafer thin ones. I decided to put this to him and I wrote a carefully worded letter requesting an interview but answer came there none. Now I'm not given to harrying wafer kiosk persons as a matter of course, but nor will I allow them to vend wafer reproduce they themselves astrue without giving me a damn good explanation. That's the kind of narrator I am unable to pursue Coulson myself having come down with a case of seeds in the vitals which necessitated complete bedrest. I employed a private detective by the name of Mr. Van Plunkett to act on my behalf. This Plunkett was a curious combination of elegance, readiness and allergies. I never did quite get the measure of him. As far as I could gather, he existed on a starvation diet, berries, mostly, and rainwater. Certainly, he was not a man to feed on swans, irrespective of whether they had been accidentally electrocuted or not. Tragically, the assignment on which I sent him prove to be Plunkett last case. I didn't hear from him for months on end, and was in any case losing interest in the doings of a self hating wafer salesman from Oh hooligans Wharf, having better things to do with my time, such as trying out that berries and rainwater diet myself. Then, one morning I read in the daily drip feed, a short item, noting that an elegant ratty and allergy prone private detective had been found dead in a thicket of gorse bushes and Bracken. Apparently, the wires of his portable metal Tapping Machine had become entangled in the foliage, and he had been too bloody cack handed to extricate himself. I crumpled up the newspaper and tossed it into a disposable shoot, and I said a prayer for Plunkett. It was not a long prayer, nor was it a well written one. I think it had been translated from Glocer, the artificial international language, which rivals Esperanto. And then I went home, and I opened my copy of Moby Dick or the whale by Herman Melville. And I read PIP prophecies, Doom all turned to bats at dusk, all screwy world all mad, and I sank my teeth into a vile wafer, and out in the spinny I knew that dozens upon dozens of swans were gathering, whooper, swans, whooping, whooping, magnificent, and so very alive. I'm finally part four, which I may have to read rather rapidly. I'm not sure I will read it so that you can hear. Don't worry. This is called a pedant righteous nostrums.

Unknown Speaker  23:54
It has to be said that most of the inhabitants of o hoolahan dwarf are not worth writing about. They are without, with very few exceptions, a great and insipid bunch. One of those exceptions, however, is the pedant from his pen streams, a series of righteous nostrums, or possibly nostre, regularly sent out into the world, or at least into this bilgewater befouled corner of it. posters. They are on a notice board outside the pet shop, from which they are rapidly torn down and stuffed into the pockets of those citizens who collect them with something approaching mania. Three questions present themselves to the inquiring mind. Who is this patent? What are his nostrums and are they righteous? I do not have an enquiring mind, at least not today, for I'm too busy putting the finishing touches to my taxonomy of swans in tin wood grease and sand and imposing sculpture which has not yet found a buyer and may therefore remain wedged into my bathroom for years to come. But I know that listeners will be curious about THE PENDANT AND HIS nostrums and their righteousness. So I asked Dr. Ruth pastry to investigate. Now, Dr. pastry and I have a somewhat fraught relationship. many moons ago, we got into an argument about that anonymous 18th century suicide note which read in its entirety. All this buttoning and unbuttoning. I can't recall the substance of our dispute, only that harsh and unforgiveable words were exchanged. saucepans held one still brim full of an appetizing soup, and threat leveled against pets, to wit, a tortoise and the goose. The tortoise was mine, that goose Dr. pastries. In the end, neither of them came to any harm, at least not immediately. Although of course, the ravages of the passing years took their toll, and both of them are now dead and gone. Diego the tortoise in a mile strong, and Rex the goose in a railway accident. very much alive though is the feud between me and Dr. pastry, and it was with a view to ending it that I invited her help with the patent and his righteous nostrums. It was the sort of assignment I thought she would enjoy, given her fondness for both patents and nostrums. I was wrong. Here's what she wrote in reply to my invitation. For the love of heaven key, what makes you think for one moment that I would ever again set foot in that confounded sea girt wasteland. The last time I went to Oh, hooligans Wharf. I was young, cheery, and full of beans, or blue stocking with the glint of glory in my bright blue eyes. Two hours after cycling into town with a pannier full of Proust, I was sprawled on a heap of pebbles stinking of the sea, a prematurely aged drudge with gnats in my hair pustules on my brow, and a belly full of 90% proof eggnog. Don't get me wrong. I don't blame the shriveled and witless Oh, hula hymns, war fights, it's simply the spirit of the place. It does that to a person even to me, well, never again, your parent with his nostrums can go hang. I'm going out to the cemetery now to place a bunch of peonies and flax on poor Rex's tomb. And as I do so, I will curse you again and again, as I have cursed you every single day since the buttoning and unbuttoning business first flared idea. Clearly, if I was going to satisfy my readers, curiosity about the pedant, his nostrums and their righteousness, I would have to think again. Dr. pastry seemed in no mood to make peace and I was not sure I'd be able to change her mind. All of which, I suppose goes to explain why I found myself hopelessly lost in the dark dark woods as midnight struck. With Dr. pastry down the pan as it were, I worked desalt orally at the taxonomy of swans, my mind buzzing away trying to think of someone else who might be able to help. As I tamped A Fistful of grease into a knothole I suddenly remembered the old blind woodcutter dipping my hands into a tub of swarf eager, I tried to recall his telephone number. He'd made me swear never to write it down. And I had honored my promise, partly out of rectitude, and partly because he said that if I broke my word, he would send a sloth of slow lumbering bears to smother me in my bed. His sightless eyes gleamed dangerously in the candlelighters he said this, and I realized that the story about how old Maher Bagshaw met her and suddenly made sense. My Word is my bond, I mumbled, and the old blind would cut a cackled. Now, though, 20 years later, with the Soviet Union long collapsed, I

Unknown Speaker  28:48
simply couldn't remember that damn number. I realized I'd have to set off in the dark dark woods and find the old blind wood cutters crumbling cottage and ask him face to face. I attack the end of a length of string to my gate, and paid it out behind me as I walked each step taking me further and further from the comforts of home, and the unfinished taxonomy of swans and closer to the perils of the dark dark woods. Had I known that my neighbor's Eagle Simon had swooped out of the sky within minutes of my departure, and bitten the end of the string, because it smelled of hamster I would have stopped then and there. In my ignorance, of course, I tramped on little knowing that like the answers my friend, my string, the string that should see me safely home was blowing in the wind. And the answers to my three questions about the pattern of Oh hooligans Wolf, and his nostrums and the righteousness of his nostrums, they too are blowing in the wind for what hope do I have of discovering them now in this Stygian darkness, it's midnight. I'm encircled by enormous trees, but Duff underfoot is musty and I'm alive with tiny biting creatures. There is no trace of the old blind wood cutters cottage, perhaps only ever, ever imagined him. My hands still stink of small finger. It's midnight and pitch black, and I've been wandering these dark dark woods for 100 years.
