Hello, my name is Frankie and it's hooting yard on the air once again, Wednesday afternoon, four o'clock, repeated on Saturday mornings at 830 if you miss it, but if you miss it, you won't have heard this announcement. So anyway, I'd like to begin with a quotation from a book by Henry H. Vale. entitled A History of the mcguffey readers. Now, I didn't know what the mcguffey readers were, but any American listeners will be highly familiar with them. They're I think they were like preschool, preschool books to help children to read the mcguffey readers. And Henry h Vale wrote a history of them. And one of the things he said was the first reader was mostly in words of one syllable. In this book, we find the story of the lame dog that when cured, brought another lame dog to be doctored of the kind of boy who freed his caged bird of the cruel boy who drowned the cat and pulled wings and legs from flies of the chimney sweep, who was tempted to steal a gold watch, but put it back and was thereafter educated by its owner of the whiskey boy, and of the mischievous boy who played ghost and made another boy insane. Nearly every lesson has a moral clearly stated in formal didactic words at its close. And it's in homage to the first of the mcguffey readers that I've tried to put all of them together. And this is called the story of the lame dog, the caged bird, the drowned cat, the gold watch the whiskey boy and the insane boy. Once upon a time, there was an insane boy who could only be becomed by listening to prog rock. On Monday, a Barkley James harvest album was played to him. On Tuesday, there was a power cut, and in his mania, the insane boy went out and attacked a lame dog. The dog's name was hoo boo goo. It was a winter ghost dog. On wetness day, electricity was restored, and the insane boy listened over and over and over again to pan tag girls Nativity by gentle giant. On Thursday, the insane boy absconded from his deep dark, dank cellar, and headed for the hills. With one swift in human movement, he plucked a Starling from the sky and put it in a birdcage. On Friday, his keepers forced the insane boy to listen to atomic rooster at almost imperceptible volume. On Saturday, the insane boy took advantage of a moment in attention on the part of his gods to drown a cat in a puddle. The cat was called fad followed flap, and it was 14 years old. On Sunday, Carl Palmer of Emerson lake and Palmer visited the insane boy and played a drum solo that lasted all day. On Monday, the insane boys smashed a gold watch into 1000 bits with his terrifyingly pale fists. On Tuesday, the insane boy had an iPod with only one track clamp to his head. The song was a plague of lighthouse keepers by Van de Graaff generator. On Wednesday, the insane boy managed to smuggle a bottle of spirits into his filthy cell. The waters wrote a report for Captain Jarvis, in which they called the insane Boy, that whiskey boy, inaccurately as the bottle contains terps. On Thursday, the insane boy begged to hear tales of topographic oceans by Yes. On Friday, he was pronounced incurable. That story was written in words of more than one syllable and it has no moral

I'm from baby grieving matter for children to a kind of exciting, adult, Thriller type of story. This is called the taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese is in a state of flux. Captain Baxter made one last desperate attempt to adjust the Hooters knobs and boosters on the console. For God's sake, man, the taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese is in a state of flux. He screamed, but it was too late. 10 days earlier, it all seemed so simple. Baxter had been summoned to the Admiralty on a hot Tuesday morning. The place was swarming with admirals, but by asking a series of increasingly astute questions, he tracked down the admiral he had come to see righteous rank Admiral o hoolahan, was a follow on and tawdry man. And Baxter found him lurking in a corner of his office where light never penetrated. He hissed at the captain to join him there. I'm glad you could come Baxter. He said. For months now I've been getting intelligence reports about a certain matter that I don't mind telling you has frozen the blood in my veins. That is why I skulk in corners. He shuddered, I skulk and as you can see, I shudder you would shudder to Baxter. If you knew what I know about a certain matter, and no you shall soon enough, I'm sending you on a mission. Baxter's nose began to bleed but he's staunched it with a large rectangular pad of cotton wall. It's lucky for you that I'm not a vampire, said the admiral mysteriously. His suit was cheap. His his great prominent flaps the color of death. His shoes had been ordered by weasels, and he lacked backbone. That was why he needed Baxter. Baxter's backbone was the talk of the Admiralty. Not just canteen gossip, but the subject of secret memoranda, bulging dossiers and meetings attended by every single Admiral in the building, all crammed into Admiral o hoolahan sunless refuge jostling for space. Baxter knew nothing of this. He knew a lot about ships, rigging, cables, hoses, decks, both poop and all up thingies oars, the fuse into which was a slotted and many other topics of maritime significance. His diet consisted chiefly of seaweed and ships biscuits until today. At moelleux hoolahan reached into the darkness which engulfed this corner of the room. And Baxter heard cranking noises before you attend to a certain matter, Baxter, we must have lunch, he said, trying unsuccessfully to disguise his full on this. His stick thin arms set to work winching up a crate of food from a pantry far far below. Baxter offered to help, but the admiral was a proud man in spite of his tawdriness long last he was able to hold the crate into the room, which will eat here in the shadows he announced and began unloading the food. The pair of them tucked into a feast of baps bands eggs fat jam, pie, beans, cake, chops, curd Flan, kale, pork, rice rolls rusks sago soup suid, tarts, bacon, bread, broth, cloves, cream, dough, flour, fudge, gravy. gruul, honey, icing, jelly, liver means prunes, pulses salad scons, syrup, toast, wafers, yeast batter, Bond bonds, butter cheese, confit eclairs faggots garlic greens junket kidneys, mousse noodles, new Gar oxtails, pastry, peppers, potatoes, Ragu raisins, simnel, sorbet, sponge toffee, walnuts and peppermint. At the end of which Baxter was given full details of his mission. It would be no easy task, but he kissed the admirals forehead as a sign that he accepted it.

Overland wedged himself even further into the corner as Baxter took his leave striding across the filthy office and placing his blood soaked rectangular pad of cotton wool into a basket before closing the door gently behind him. Little Did either of them know that in 10 days time, the taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese would be in a state of flux, and Baxter would face a peril greater than death itself.

cited by all the thrills and spills in that story, and a try a complete change of tone now a different a different kind of story entirely. This is called those gubernatorial bells have a clanged those gubernatorial bells. It's a few years now since their appeals sounded, but still I hear them in my head. They clanged ceaselessly, all day and all night. deafeningly loud for years on end, cows stood dazed in the fields around the belltower, many, many cows too many cows to count all dazed and stunned, and in those days, no cow herds came to give them sucker. In your tongue, gubernatorial refers to governorship, but in my land at that time, the gubernatorial bells were the ever clanging bells of the ferocious tyrants, known variously as the goob, or goob. Or goober net. Some said the goob was a themed in human form, but no one had ever seen it. So how could they be so sure, muttering darkly in the corner of the tavern? professing a knowledge they did not have rewarded with a refilled tankard by some credulous foreign person on an ill advised visit to our bell blasted village. Dogs Dobson came here once he crashed through the tavern doors, a clumsy adventurer for he was young then. And he jabbered anyone who would listen that he wanted to go up the hills of the castle to meet the goober net face to face. And what do you think you'll find? snared an old frog man in the last stages of drunken despair? Within seconds, he killed off his stall and laying sensible in the sawdust. Dobson answered him regardless. I know now I know not what I shall find old man, he announced. I know only that if those benighted bells are ever to stop clanging, the goober net must be dragged from its perch in the castle on top of the hill. Then you will know peace, as will a countless cows in your pretty fields, who now are dazed and stunned. Our fields are indeed pretty, muttered someone lurking in the gloom, as is your speech young Dobson. But the goob will never allow you into its presence. The last swashbuckling foreign person who came here on a mission such as yours, ran away jabbering along hollyhock Lane. They recovered his corpse from the duck pond the week later, when our neck crow pod woman made her examination. Do you know what she found? His brain had been sucked out into space. There is an art to saying, sure, with conviction later in life, as you know, Dobson was one of the great performers. But back then he was callow and shallow, and the poor sure he assured was a pitiful PIP on his lips. In truth, he was unnerved by this news, he resolved to obtain a letter of introduction from the goober net solicitors, buttercups and Todd, whose office he had passed on his way from the railway station. He pranced out of the tavern, and retraced his steps. Neither buttercups nor Todd was available he learned cow business kept them fully occupied, for there were numberless cows and only the pair of them the one greasy the other mute. Dobson sat on a lump of stone in the market square, biting his fingernails and praying for the insane clanging of the gubernatorial bells to stop. And that is how I found him so many years ago, on that gorgeous day when first we met when still a cow herd shun the cows, when the bells still clanged in that village far away, where I plied my trade is the niekro pod woman. fruitlessly searching for brains sucked into space, and for a pamphleteer, whose pamphlets had not yet been written, not yet.

The Assassination of an important world figure is so shocking that other events of the day, including other deaths tend to get overlooked. A notable example of this is the death of Aldous Huxley on the 22nd of November 1963. That day, of course, is recalled because of what happened near the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. So the demise of the astonishingly tall severely myopic Huxley went virtually unremarked, as incidentally did the fact that only a few weeks before the vacuum cleaner salesman who knocked on his door in Los Angeles was the young Don vanvleet seemed to become known to the world as Captain Beefheart. Never let it be said that hooting yard is stinting with the fact and there was another death that day that received even less attention, despite the fact that the cinema was robbed of one of its most Titanic talents. Few people today remember wolf dnz, overshadowed in death by Kennedy and Huxley and in posterity by his near namesake, who was a weird sociopath given to the production of sentimental pap. In his centenary year, it's only fitting that we should recall some of dem Z's great triumphs, and over the next few months, the hooting Our team of film buffs led by Fatima giller. Blatt, we'll be looking at each of these masterpieces in turn. Fatima is currently out of the country, sorry out in the country is doing her usual. Urban haunts for a summer spent mooching about in some godforsaken abandoned farm yard. But she found time to send in this brief note. Hello listeners, Fatima Gilly black here sprawled on a musty hay bale and thinking about Thomas Hardy fate, destiny and the granting of pigs at dawn. But I haven't forgotten my promise to write about the films of Walt dnz and I'm putting the finishing touches to a sprightly little essay on that timeless classic beauty in the bees. In my opinion, it's the finest killer bee attack film ever made. And I hope to communicate my over enthusiasm to you very very soon. Hey, ho. Green grow the roof is over.

Frank Key  17:44
Regular listeners will know that hear hooting yard we try to try to do really seamless segues from one piece to another Fatima gilla blatz note they're mentioning beauty in the bees, and more about killer bees. pansy cradle Jew who is tirelessly enthusiastic about researching such matters, has stumbled upon the solution to the mystery of killer bee attacks. She was reading that tremendous book the original chambers book of days, which I've spoken about before. The original chambers book of days was published in the late 19th century there is a new edition but it doesn't have quite the same. It's not quite the same LAN. Anyway, here is a quotation that pansy stumbled upon in the in the original tremors book of days, which is actually all on the internet and there's a link to it from the hooting yard website. This is what it said. It has been shown in a contemporary publication that it is customary in many parts of England when a death takes place to go and formally impart the fact to the bees to ask them to the funeral and to fix a piece of crepe upon their hives. That's treating these insects as beings possessed of something like human intelligence, and therefore entitled to all the respect which one member of a family pays to the rest. Not long before penning these notes, I met with an instance of this feeling about bees. A neighbor of mine had bought a hive of bees at an auction of the goods of a farmer who had recently died. The bees seemed very sickly and not likely to thrive. When my neighbor's servant bee thought him that they had never been put in mourning for their late master. On this, he got a piece of crepe and tied it to a stick which he fastened to the hive. After this, the bees recovered. And when I saw them, they were in a very flourishing state, a result which was unhesitatingly attributed to their having been put into mourning. So pansy read this in chambers book of days and she sees here the key to the anti social behavior of killer bees. Unlike what happened with the lucky hives in the quoted passage, most bereaved families in this day and age forget to include bees in the mourning process. If you doubt that try to recall the last time you saw a grief stricken relict tying a piece of crepe to a stick and attaching it to a beehive. As this sensible practices died out, so millions of bees are deprived of the opportunity to mourn their human powers are thrown into dangerous neurotic confusion, bereft, ignored, and not even given a piece of crap on a stick, let alone counseling. they're unable to achieve closure, and thus band together into swarms of homicidal buzzing frenzy, with predictable and catastrophe, catastrophic results.

That's absolutely true. The quotation about bees in mourning. Funny how that died out. Anyway, moving on. Moving on. What have we had we've had fictional stories we've had news of the Kennedy assassination, bees. Here's some here's some advice. Wearing a bag on your foot is an effective way of stopping water leaking into your boot. Such a disaster can occur when the soul of your boot is pitted with holes, and you step inadvertently into a puddle of rain water which has fallen out of the sky. The soul of your boots may be so pitted because it's old and worn. Or it may be that the holes appeared all together of a sudden. For example, if your boot came into contact with an industrial hole punch. Whatever the cause of the holes in the soul of your boot, which will allow water to seep into your sock, you will be very careful to watch out for puddles of rainwater, and other watery dangers, such as duck ponds, and the sea. But I would argue that it's a near certainty your vigilance will not be so acute as to withstand the unexpected. For example, you may be hailed by an acquaintance or bought a passing bus with a top deck open to the elements. A klaxon may sound or you may be temporarily blinded by a mysterious hovering ball of incandescent light. In these hypothetical cases, and numerous others, your whole boot may splash into a body of water, and your sock will become drenched as well your foot as likely as not, for It's rare for a sock to be watertight in this country. That's why a bag worn on your foot over your boot of course, can be such a boon. A judiciously chosen bag will stop water entering the holes in the soul of your boot and soaking into your sock making your foot wet. We all know what happened to those poor, terrified soldiers cowering in trenches during the Great War. Let's take precautions not available to them. Remember, they didn't have plastic bags. You'll have noticed that the words judiciously chosen in the previous that I just said, and I inserted them when preparing the final draft of this text when it struck me with tremendous force that to say merely a bag will stop water entering the holes in the soul of your boot and soaking into your sock. Making your foot wet was a laughably inadequate prescription. I didn't actually laugh but I thumped my forehead with the flat of my hand and groaned at my inexact attitude. Selecting the bag to wear on your foot is not onerous, you just have to ensure that it's a bag which will be impervious to water, hence the referenced plastic bags, think polythene or even rubber. It's tempting to advise you against using a paper bag, but you already know that a paper bag would be useless for our present purposes. If you don't know that using a paper bag will leave you with a leaking boot and a soaked sock and foot. You're either too young to be listening to this, or you have an almost inconceivable lack of common sense. Like Tim had put a paper bag on his boat when he dangled his foot into a paddling pool. It's for Tim and those like Tim that this article was written when you meet Tim and see at a glance that he has only One leg, you will understand why throughout I have referred to the boot and the sock and the foot in the singular. If you're a bipedal, you can still reap the benefits of my thoughtful advice by making the necessary adjustments to the text in your head. Because I'm in no mood, no mood to repeat the whole thing ever, even if flooding becomes widespread in these dismal fens, where we live out our dismal lives under a dismal sky that threatens rain again today.

This is a brief story to end the show, and it's called clot. ferric push gas, who shared his name with the legendary Hungarian footballer, was a beefy clot of a man. Unlike his namesake, he never played for Han Ved he never played football at all. Gas was what fascinated him to the point of Ruin, gas and eels. In his lecture, what Philately teaches us, john and laugh reminds us that quote, the connection between cows and postage stamps is not obvious. And the same might be said of eels and gas of gas and eels. Within ferric teeming scale. However, the two could not be disentangled, beefy clot he may have been, but he had an extraordinary ability to see linkages between things of which most of us are oblivious. There is a story about him that he wants Gaston eel, but it's been proved to be untrue. And how could it be true? We're dealing with a man who spoke to eels commune with them, in a way little understood even now half a century after his death. Because he salivated at four times the normal rate, push gases speaking voice was difficult to decipher. And he didn't help matters by forever sucking on gobstoppers even in his sleep. That's why the transcript of his one radio interview conducted in his harbour heart in 1931 is so patchy, acute and erudite questions pour forth. But of his replies only a few words are intelligible, punctuated by infuriating ellipses, hundreds of them more ellipses than one is ever likely to find in any other single text since the invention of the alphabet. That may sound like hyperbole, but and maybe it is, but I know what I'm talking about. I wrote a piece entitled a compendium of elliptical phrases in World Literature from the dawn of time to the present day. And you can read that if you doubt me. Anyway, so in the transcript, we get things like this interviewer, Mr. Push gas, it's been said that you communicate with eels, and that's the subject of most of your discussions with them is gas. You claim that most of your knowledge of gas comes from what eels tell you as a beefy clot, you have an error of saintly innocence, which makes it unlikely that you're lying. Could it be that you're deluded? And then the response from push gas, stoop bag, hat fopp, glue, pot gunk, inarticulate lump he may have been but we cannot simply dismiss ferric push gas. As long as there are men and women on this planet who care about eels and gas. His name will live on a beacon in the darkness shining brightly then sputtering fading until it's finally extinguished, and all his ruin. And hooting yard on the air is finally extinguished. Now that's the end of this week's show. Goodbye.
