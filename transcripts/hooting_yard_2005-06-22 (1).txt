Indeed it is hooting out on the air with me, Frank key. Why did we play the theme to the West Wing instead of the Caucasian alibi? I don't know when I think mere whim anyway, and I'll be more music actually coming up later in the show, which is unusual. But there you go. This is a piece called sieves and basins. I have long been promising a definitive series of articles on Basin's and I'm well aware that listeners are champing at the bit. Is there anything else other than a bit which one champs? I wish Dobson had written a pamphlet listing other items suitable for champing at but alas, he never did, to my knowledge, even had he done so it will be out of print, and I would have the devil of a job tracking it down. By the way, word reaches me that a complete listing of every single Dobson pamphlet has been posted on the internet, but I have yet to track it down. Google gives about two and a half million pages for Dobson and nearly 20,000 for Dobson plus pamphlet and finding time to look at that amount of information disease my tiny curdled brain I'm afraid it would help if we knew Dobson's first name of course, but I'm not sure he had one. Allah wishes nesting bird one spent a whole winter trying to find out if Dobson's parents ever called him anything except Dobson. nesting bird was working from the questionable premise that everyone has a first name and as a result, his health was ruined. They took him to hospital in a wheelbarrow because he was unable to walk and the ambulance persons were unable to get a stretcher into the hayloft where the scholar was holed up. He taken refuge they're covered in straw, as the nearest scenic fits brought on by overwork became more pronounced. nesting birds mental state was always fragile, as were his shin bones. As a youth he been an enthusiastic incompetent player of hockey, ice hockey, Water Polo, and other games involving hefty wooden sticks capable when wielded with sufficient force of smashing his bones to bit as they did regularly. is a bit of irony. He wrote that I acquired a second first name being known as Aloysius splinter veins, splinter bones, where I was unable to ever find just the one name for Dobson. Of course, splinter bones was not the only nickname that nesting bird picked up in a career that spanned more decades than I can recall with certainty. Whereas the provenance of splinter bones is easily explained. Some of the other nicknames are mysterious, while yet others are highly mysterious. Why, for example, that a little gang of infant band dity, who roamed the canal towpath always refer to nesting birders tab Hunter, when he bore no resemblance to that celebrated actor, we do not know. Anyway, I've not forgotten that you're champing at the bit for an essay about Basin's it would have been written by now had I not received a letter from a listener, asking a deceptively simple question. Dear Mr. Key, wrote someone signing himself Christa Berg. When you write your long awaited and no doubt superb piece about basins, will you be addressing the related issue of sieves? After all, surely a sieve is just a basin with holes in it. As soon as I read this, I rent my garments and read out a shrill cry like the wild boy of Am I wrong. My dejection was immense. I picked up a handful of pebbles and held them through the open window at the crows perched on the fence. Then I picked up another handful of pebbles, bigger ones, and threw them at the starlings on the lawn. I knew that both the crows and the starlings would take their revenge later by pecking at my uphole Street and my tower But the business with the pebbles relieved the pressure on my brain and lifted my spirits, albeit temporarily. I went and washed my hair with an exciting new shower product, then sat down and fired off a reply to my correspondent, Dear Mr. De Burgh, I wrote, you may think you've asked a simple question by raising the issue of sieves is nothing but basins with holes in them. But the simplicity is deceptive.

I will now have to rewrite the piece from scratch. so distraught was i was i on reading your letter that I rent my garments left out a shrill cry through pebbles at crows and starlings and washed my hair which is still dripping wet. My brain is now calm enough for me to put pencil to paper. I'm going to tear up everything I have written about basins and begin again. I signed the letter with wild stabbing thrust of the pencil, burst into tears became all floppy, like a rag doll neglected and abandoned by the side of a hateful pond.

This week, the hooting Yod fictional substance of the week is equal. Imagine you're in ancient Greece, taking a stroll on Mount Parnassus, one of the gods of Greek mythology suddenly appears in front of you. Imagine too, that you're not of a placid and thoughtful nature, as I'm sure you are. But a temperamental hothead, prone to violence. surprised by the sudden appearance of a deity, it doesn't really matter which one, your first instinct is to lash out in terror and alarm. You sock the God on its jaw, cutting its lip. Now, it's not blood which flows from the wound, but it caught a colorless ethereal fluid, which ran through the veins of all the Greek gods. If you're a vampiric bent, be sure not to suck the echo oozing from the gods cut from it. For though it confers immortality on the deities, it will be ruinous to you as a mere human for it will poison You. Lord Byron wrote, he pattered with his keys at a great rate and sweated through his APA systolic skin. Of course his preparation was but ecore or some such other spiritual likkle whether it or is the root of the word icky as in that sponge pudding was so icky that I felt a great wave of nausea. Oh, well me to the point of lovecraftian Horror is a moot point. Sometimes echo is not fictional. in geology echo is a technical term denoting a fluid or emanation from a magma which has helped cause granite as I granite eyes ation of rock. And in medical parlance, it means the water ooze from an abrasion scars or wound. Do not be mistaken next time such an ooze seeps from one of your wounds, that you have somehow been transformed into an immortal super being. Rather than saying, as the Emperor Vespasian did on his deathbed, I must be turning into a god. You should instead go and see your doctor. And all the better if your doctor's surgery is on my lip, I thought magma riddled volcano.

The title of the next piece is in German, so if there are any German speaking listeners, they're going to have to excuse my accent, which probably isn't very good. At the title of this pieces sag mill vodi bloomin Xin after breakfast I did a quick set of blocks Many exercises second Handbook, and then I hosted my rucksack on to my back and strode manfully off to the countryside to look at all the bloomin. The light connects to the decor airfield was full of decoy ducks. For the first time I noticed a shabby clapboard heart which, according to a sign on its roof with selling items of stationery at bargain prices. I strode manfully across the verdant meadows, stepping on innumerable bloomin as I went and pushed my way into the tenebrous interior of the heart. Wearing set a Crone sharpening a pencil. Hi, oh, Crone. I cried. Hail wayfaring. Rock sack person yelled the Crone. Definitely. I was disconcerted. From her withered old body festooned in noise some rags, pipe the voice of a youngster. I wondered with a start if my man full stride had led me inadvertently into the spooky land of Gar, reputed to be teeming with imps and sprites, spider gods and changelings, and with things that should not be. But I had faced peril before, and I had eaten a large breakfast. quick thinking has always been my trademark. So I nipped out of the hat, and that Bruce had a fistful of Calla Lilies to give to the Crone. If she was on my level and being from a parallel universe, the balloon would appease her. And if she was better, Crone, there would be no harm done. Hey, once more Crone. I declaimed, skipping back into the hat here have these Calla Lilies to brighten up your hovel. The Crown accepted my gift graciously, actually reached creepily to take the bloomin a slight dis arrangement of her rags revealed the source of arrestingly youthful voice. Wires trailed from her sleeve, and following their path across the floor. I saw that she was attached to a standard karpin voicebox mischievously, I turned the dial to the US vice presidents setting. So when next the Crone spoke, she would sound exactly like Spyro Agnew. I was about to ask the price of pencil sharpeners when a shelduck waddled into the heart. At least I thought it was a shelduck it may have been a tale. its arrival sent the Crone into a frenzy of terror. I had to turn down the volume on the Kirpan voice box so loudly did she scream, the teal or shelduck glared at her with uncanny purple eyes. And she carried on screaming there was little I could do. My training never prepared me to deal with terrifying ducks. Not that I was scared of the teal or shelduck myself, you understand? I fear nothing anymore. Not even those recurring nightmares I have about buttons for I have been following botsman second handbook for five years. That's why I'm able to stride manfully about the countryside, trampling on bloomin without a care in the world. I picked up a pencil sharpener and placed a handful of coins in its place. The Crone still screamed, the duck still stared. I left the heart and was blinded by the sun, bathing the fields in an unearthly light. As I approached gruesome ditch and my eyes adjusted, I saw that all the bloomin had vanished without trace, and no birds did sing. That's the end of that piece. But here is some singing. This is a very short piece of music played at the right speed, I hasten to add and it's by Ed Byrne and Luke dieth. And they're half of a band with a great name bloated janitor. So have a listen to this and I'll be back when it's over.

I know there are some listeners who like to go straight from listening to hooting out on the air to playing board games and card games and parlor games. Mustard custard is an exciting parlor game for all the family best played however in pitch darkness. While the lights are still on, each player is dealt a hand of six cards. These are then traded frantically until someone has a hand of a single suit. This player is designated the timekeeper and is also in charge of the light switch. Each person then places their cards facedown on the table. The timekeeper draws the curtains closes any shutters and turns off the light. Using hopes, counters and coat hangers that players dash wildly around the room, bumping into furniture, walls and each other all the while screaming At the tops of their voices, points again for blood curdling shrieks best deal howling, unbridled panic and Dionysian frenzy. After precisely three hours have passed, the timekeeper switches the lights back on, the players have 10 seconds to claw their way to the table and collect their cards. A non participating family member or friend then creeps into the room with a trolley on which there are two large bowls, one filled to the brim with mustard and the other with custard. Big iron spoons are distributed to each player. Starting with the person holding the best hand and then in descending order. Each player plunges their spoon into one of the bowls, gulps down the yellow goo and shouts, mustard or custard accordingly. When everyone has had their turn, the whole game is repeated from scratch with the important difference that at the end, those who devoured a spoonful of custard buzz choose the mustard and vice versa. There is no outright winner. As in all sports and past time, the important thing is taking part.

We heard about Dobson earlier and now this piece is about bloodroot when Blodgett worked as a brain analyst in the period immediately after a war, he became intrigued by cases of what was dubbed ornamental pond guilt. One Saturday afternoon pursuing his own project and an otherwise deserted lab. He discovered that by exposing samples of dead brain tissue to an all enveloping and I'll begin that sentence again. One Saturday afternoon pursuing his own project and an otherwise deserted lab. He discovered that by exposing samples of dead brain tissue to an all enveloping gas filtered through a CLI gland sieve, he could never achieve the same results twice. He made his way to the canteen notebook in hand and scribbled down both the data and his conclusions while drinking cup after cup of nettle tea. By chance the canteen employed as mop person a patient who suffered from ornamental pond guilt pabs dis v was one of the first recorded cases of the syndrome, and though by no means cured, his condition was such that he could perform simple tasks, such as mopping the floor of a canteen. Blodgett spilled some of his tea on the floor, and perhaps does v mopped it up. It is one of the most poignant moments in medical history. Blodgett was of course familiar with the case of perhaps this V. He knew that when following the instructions to assemble an ornamental pond in the garden of his invalid mother, the patient had been stricken with a monumental sense of guilt, which left him a jabbering wreckage of a man. Over the next eight months, a series of quacks prescribed various potions, tablets, infusions, and even injections. Although the story that leeches were applied to shoulder blades is apocryphal. Perhaps this V was eventually carted off to the clinic, but there was a little hope that he would ever recover. Well, the Blodgett know that it was the incredibly complex battery of techniques devised by Dr. Fang that had brought the patient so far that he could mop a canteen floor. What Blodgett did not know was that the impossibly handsome and stylishly dressed figure wielding the mop mop to mop up his net spilled nettle tea was perhaps this V. Dr. Fang, of course was ridiculously secretive about his methods. When he died after toppling into a crash during an ill advised hiking holiday. He left no records, not a shred of documentation to allow others to continue his work. There was a fear throughout the clinic that perhaps does V and the 34 other ornamental pond guilt patients would relapse and no longer be capable of mopping up canteen floors. Hence Blodgett Saturday sessions in the lab. He knew that if he could discover some way to reproduce Dr. Fang results his name would resound throughout the world of brain analysis. A small worlds to be sure, but it was the universe to Blodgett when he came face to face with Pabst as V but knew him not, that was the first nail in the coffin of Blodgett career. The second was when perhaps this V impossibly handsome and impossibly clumsy, accidentally whacked the brain analyst on the head with a wooden handle of his mop. Blodgett was knocked unconscious. When he came two hours later, he remembered nothing of the last 20 years of his life. He was like Ronald Coleman in random harvest. He thought he was still what he once had been, would be poet starving in a Garret and vents he returned to scribble twaddle instead of scribbling scientific data, and perhaps this V remained mopping the canteen floor a little recovered Yes, but still engulfed by ornamental pond guilt until his dying day

besides time to leave you soon, and we're going to leave you once again with the majestic theme to the West Wing button before I do I really need to do two advertisements. One advertisement of course is for the hosting yard website where you can read all this stuff, which is it HTTP, colon forward slash forward slash hooting.yd.users.bt. Open world.com and no WWE in there. And the second advert is for a new film, which is opening up the Excelsior cinema Oh, hooligans Wharf very, very soon. He's back. He's making grumpy noises. It's the grumpy man. Just when you thought it was safe to let go of your hat. June sees the return of the very, very frightening grunty man who stalks your nightmares, makes his grunting noises and then stalks some more. Well, may you shudder milk SOP shutter as much as you like, but make sure you hold on to your hat. It's been known for centuries that holding on to your hat is an effective way of stopping it flying off your head as you quake in fear. Something we have seen happen so often in times of terror. And no time is more terrible than the time when the grantee man comes a stalking, making his grunting noises. But wait. If you're in the habit of dyeing your hat, make sure the dye is dry before you hold it or you will get dye on your hand and being so marked. The grantee man will sniff you out as he comes stalking and grunting and you will be fodder for his more. The Passion of the grantee man opens at the Excelsior cinema hooligans Wharf. And that's all for this week. Goodbye.
