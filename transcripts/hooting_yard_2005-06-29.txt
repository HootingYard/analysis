Good afternoon. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frankie, and I'm going to read some pros to you. First of all I'm going to I'd like to tell you about those two great modernists, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf and they were exact contemporaries. Both were born in 1882, and both died in 1941. their reputations have survived indeed prospered in the 21st century. But the same cannot be said of a third writer who shares those dates of birth and death. They're now forgotten many crown lop but was many more modern German Genie. Some critics think so. This is what Teddy is glob said chronolock was a monomaniac who stuck to a preposterous Lee limited subject matter, but I am convinced that her name will ring down the ages, outlasting Homer, Beowulf and the Bible. Praise indeed from the man who dismissed as clots and nincompoops nearly every writer of note from the 17th century onwards. globe is certainly correct to refer to crown locks, preposterously limited range. In fact, all she ever wrote was stories featuring the sons of Noah. It is true that she placed Shem, Ham and Japheth in an astonishing variety of settings, but no other characters feature in her work, except for occasional appearances by a fictionalized version of Suez Canal visionary Ferdinand de les Epps, 1805 to 1894. If her work is unconventional, so to her career, many krumlov only began to write in the last decade of her life on the 14th of January 1931, to be precise. It was on the cold morning of this day that she wrote from beginning to end, one setting the famous story Shem, Ham and Japheth join a knitting circle, which appeared in the inaugural issue of mass bangs popular magazine of catastrophic flood fiction. Crime lop had met the self styled the deluge just orthok mass ban a few months previously, they had a passionate yet enigmatically unconsummated affair. Among the sweet nothings he whispered into her ear was his plan to publish two periodicals devoted to his pet topic, one containing fiction and the other fact. After a stroll among the bougainvilleas and fountains chronolock promised to pen a story based vaguely on Noah's Ark. On her way home, she bought a Bible, she'd never read it before locating the text she needed in Genesis, she tore it out and threw the handsome volume into a waste chute. Over the next week, she memorized the story of the flood, and thus began her singular literary career. Mass bangs magazines folded after just one issue each. He swept into many crumb lops parlor to announce their failure, only to find her scribbling away at her second tale shame and the dlss go pig hunting. Mess bang, darling I am ruined my periodicals are no more cease writing. crumble op. Oh dearest one. I could not stop even if I wanted to. For I feel the Muse inspiring me. I am going to spend the rest of my life writing strange little stories about Noah's three sons. It is my destiny. Mess bang. love of my life. Have you taken leave of your senses. Only I would publish your deranged jottings. And now I am on done. These were authentic mess bangs last words. he flung himself for many Kron locks window on the fifth floor of her shabby apartment building and was impaled on an iron spike in the street below. so consumed with crown lock with the vivacity of her tail telling that she did not hear the ungodly siren of the ambulance which carted her lover to the morgue. She remained at her escorts while penciling in a frenzy until her second story was finished. When Knight was drawing in.

Unknown Speaker  04:52
Mass bang had abandoned a wife now his widow in Dusseldorf or a similar city. She took solace in the fact that his final words were prophetic. For it seem that no one was interested in publishing many chronolock second story, nor the third, nor the fourth. For sure he had hit her stride now and spent every Thursday writing from dawn till dusk, conjuring new adventures for her heroes. She had plucked the three sons of Noah from that overcrowded Ark and was pitching them into new and dazzling adventures. shaman ham visit the glue factory, J fifth is buried alive, and deles Epson Hammond the mysterious bag of soil were all written before the end of the year. krumlov occasionally tried Hawking them to publishers without success, but every door slammed in her face seemed to inspire her to new heights of invention. She continued to eco living by boiling and darning flags actually had done since her release from prison just before the Great War. Critics today are understandably coy about many Kieron locks her life before she became a writer. The received wisdom is that her criminal past has nothing to tell us about her work. But we can separate the murderous psychopath from the storyteller as if they were two distinct kran lops. Indeed, it is difficult to square the gore drenched cutthroat, skulking in the alleyways of Dubrovnik, or somewhere like Dubrovnik, with the pencil wielding genius of the shabby apartment building. We must, I think, be grateful that King Vincenzo announced an amnesty just before the war, cynics say the king expected all those who released to perish on the battlefield, and most of them did, that many chronolock survived, for she spent the war years hiding in a hayloft near an orchard creeping out at night to eat her fill of pears and gooseberries and drinking from a spigot by the side of a bomb. Was this hayloft crown locked Ark. She shared it with a pair of geese and a pair of stoats, or at least that is what she said later, but then she claimed to have named the geese Shem and J. Firth, and the stoats de les, EPS and ham, and this is unlikely, given that she was as we have seen Bible ignorant at this point. In her last illness, when her brain was a fuming, hallucinatory miasma, she told all sorts of stories about her time in the hayloft. Indeed, she spoke of little ELS. incoherent babble, it may have been, but clearly this period after the killings and before the stories was of great significance for her. Over the years, there have been attempts to convert the wartime sanctuary into a mini chronolock museum or Memorial Library, but no one has ever been able to identify the actual site. Given that there are literally dozens of hayloft in bands near orchards throughout the country. Curiously, her writings give no clues. Throughout the canon, there is no mention of any kind of agricultural building. The reader will find plenty of Gordy palaces, space stations, skyscrapers, futuristic pods, Transylvanian castles, urban dystopias, and Victorian drawing rooms in crown locks fiction, but no bands in farmyards normal one find an ark of course. The only story that nods in a seafaring direction at all, is the elegiac a rowing boat and it's oars 1936, the first of crown locks works to win a prize. She had at long last found a publisher in the form of Dr. Gillespie's pedantic register and the Gazette. Dr. Gillespie was a fictional character who purported to edit and write most of this weekly periodical, which was heavily illustrated with mezzotints by the mezzotint test Rex tent. It was 10 to recommended chronolock to the genuine, non fictional editor of Dr. Gillespie's register a secretive plutocrat with a piratical eyepatch, who was to become her sole publisher.

Unknown Speaker  09:22
In the remaining four years of her active career, the tails poured out some of them only 50 words long, some close to novellas. It was an age of anxiety as Europe edged once again towards war. Many chronolock took to sporting an eyepatch in homage to her mentor. She went to visit dlss Suez Canal, where she wrote the groundbreaking hams rakish sneer she penned anonymous fan letters to Hollywood actor Claude Rains. Her shabby apartment building was given a new lick of paint or paints, or mold and yellow and a startling Saru in blue, she pondered writing a new type of story, one that would feature Neville Chamberlain, but abandoned it after a long and earnest discussion with Rex tent in the dining room of a majestic hotel, where the pair of them ate soup crackers and potted paste before running away without paying the bill. She exchanged her collection of pencils for a pen with an unbreakable nib, and promptly broke the nib. She was praised in an essay by capisco and large painted her portrayed, and King Vin Kenzo Sam. The new king, also called Vincenzo presented her with a metal. She wrote a marvelous tragic tear stained tale called Jay Firth is buried alive again. Her hair turned white. And then on the 14th of January 1941 10 years to the day since her writing career began, she was engulfed by a daze a days that could have been mistaken for a coma, where it not that within her days, she babbled incessantly about the hayloft and her geese, and her stoats and little else, and she never again picked up her broken pen, or any of the pencil she had retrieved from a rubbish tip. And she babbled away in her days for 40 days and 40 nights, arc time, and then she passed away. And now she's all about forgotten, so you must Mark her name and mark it well, mini cron lop.

From Vinnie Kron Lupton Mrs gubbins almost three decades on since the self styled northern white crap that talks back started making an unholy racket. Mrs. gubbins has belatedly discovered the fall. I'm sure that underneath that scowling grumpy exterior Mark E. Smith is a sweet little puppet. She says, adding he's like a frolicsome puppy, I'd be proud to have him as my son. So taken is Mrs gubbins with the ludicrously prolific Mancunian misanthrope that she has somehow managed to get hold of every record of the fall ever made, and is holed up in the Martello tower over by loopy cops passers by report that she's playing the disks in chronological order, over and over again all day and all night without pause. All attempts to get her to desist, or at least to turn the volume down on her supersonic booster sound system are ignored. Stories are circulating that birds have been dropping out of the sky, deaf and and dead in the vicinity of the cops. The police seem helpless, possibly because they're very frightened of Mrs. gubbins after what happened at last year's picnic for detectives. The octogenarian Crone telephone does yesterday. Although it was difficult to hear her given the hex induction hour was blasting away in the background, she said, I've decided to issue a series of compact discs featuring the complete works of the fall arranged for harp and flute, doing them as instrumentals will of course mean jettisoning Mr. Smith's lovely words. But I want to bring out the tweeters of the music

I just mentioned in passing the picnic for detectives. This annual event has become one of the key dates in the hooting yard calendar, which is somewhat surprising given its glorious beginnings. They're very first picnic for detectives was hardly a picnic at all. And the official historian of the event estimates that only a handful of those taking part were bonafide detectives. All we know for certain is that a small group of people no more than four or five, pitched up in a field with a couple of hampers and spent an afternoon there. meteorological record show the day was one of Arctic squalls, but the field was in a temperate zone inland in fact He was just across the road from Pang Hill orphanage. This anomaly has fascinated whether fixated picnic for detectives buffs who are legion so not only do we have just a few people with a couple of hampers, we do not even know what was in those hampers. If you're familiar with ordinary picnics, you would expect to open up a hamper to find sandwiches, savory flans, some fruit crackers, cheese related foodstuffs, cakes, bottles of refreshing barley water, hard boiled eggs would be likely to unless the film director Alfred Hitchcock was one of the picnickers but as we know from the many biographies, he was terrified of eggs. Hitchcock was not present at the picnic across the road from the orphanage that is counted now as the first picnic for detectives. But unfortunately, we do not know the names of those who were. In fact, the whole thing is shrouded in mystery. All we can say for certain is that the following year in the very same field, there was a second picnic, and this one was attended only by detectives, either by chance or design. This second picnic was blessed with what the records call humid barminess and scattered dappling sunlight. examination of surviving crumbs from the site indicates that all sorts of pies were eaten with or without cutlery. I for one hope they did use cutlery or at least forks wrote Sydney CAC. For there is something disconcerting and undignified in the mental image of a team of Tip Top detectives sprawled in a field shoveling pie into their mouths with their fingers. It seems that those resounding words picnic for detectives were first used a year later. The third picnic is the one that became legendary. Over 40 detectives gathered in the field and their hampers were each emblazoned with a bag, a heraldic device, a coat of arms, an emblem, each one caked in mud as a safeguard. The picnic menu was written down for the first time and to this day is recited at the crack of every dorm by the urchins in the orphanage. It was at this third picnic for detectives that a pack of beagles was employed to frighten off swooping crows, magpies goals and other scavenging creatures with beaks and wings. Nowadays, the beagles in the pack are bred specially in the detectives Beagle breeding compound, their psychological state carefully monitored while they are still puppies. One innovation that the third picnic for detectives which did not survive was musical accompaniment. The experimental percussionist zahlt and taplow was invited along despite having no background in police work. He was stationed in a corner of the field and asked to play suitable picnic music. His energetic thumping upon reconditioned metal drums and shamanic gongs was drowned out that day by howling winds and the steady convoy of cement mixer trucks, grayling along the road. There is one body of opinion which suggests that taplow was merely a figment of the overheated imagination of one of the detectives, a tall stooping forensics specialist who had spent too much of his career aboard ships. The absence of taplow from nearly all A to Zed directories of experimental percussionists tends to support this view. The music real or imagined was inaudible, but the picnic itself was a triumph. It is the subject of two novels a stage play a long running television serial, an opera, and no less than three films, the finest of which is probably picnic for detectives three, the title of which was changed to hot picnic for detectives impact by the distributors concerned that cinema goers would be confused into assuming that they had missed two earlier features.

Detective Captain sugery, who was given a sabbatical from the force to produce and direct the film disowned it, but he may not have done for it as a towering work. It may be that his critical faculties deserted him when immediately after completing the film, he was badly injured when attacked by a swarm. It is certainly true that his nerves never recovered, and he spent what ought to have been the prime of his career chewing toffee in the hot house of a nursing home surrounded by gigantic and abominable plants. By the time shutter ease film came out that third picnic for detectives was lost in The past a sepia tinge memory of tweed suits massive walrus mustaches, essence of violence organdy ruffles reticules and Gladstone bags from the fourth year onwards, with the introduction of lobsters on the menu picnic for detectives took on it startling cylindrical significance. Who today can imagine a hit? Who today can imagine a year in hooting yard without it. Remarkably little has changed over the years. Still, there is the ceremonial March passed of retired detectives on picnic for detectives Eve, where the wheelchairs of the infirm ancients are pushed along by teams of tots from Pang Hill orphanage. Still a lobster pots are made of beaten bronze in a factory far away. Still, the field is laced with buttercups and dandelions and spurge allowed to spread. Still anxious eyes are cast up to the skies in the morning. The weather discussed in almost insane detail by all who linger on the Pang Hill pathways. Still, the hampers bear badges which glisten under their caking of mud. And still there are detectives and still there is a picnic for them in hooting yard. But once a year come hell or high water come rain or shine.

The bifurcated root of the Mandrake plant, which has been called the insane route, resembles a human figure, or so people have thought throughout the ages. There is a legend that when the Mandrake person is pulled from the ground, it shrieks in pain, and this cry is able to Madden deaf and or even kill an unprotected human being. One way of pulling a Mandrake out of the ground safely, is as follows. And this is a quotation from an ancient tome. A Pharaoh must be dug around the root until its lower part is exposed, then a dog is tied to it, after which the person tying the dog must get away. The dog then endeavors to follow Him and so easily pulls up the root, but dies suddenly instead of his master. After this the route can be handled without fear. It does strike me that that means that for every every Mandrake plant you end up with you end up with a dead dog, but never mind. Anyway, being a miniature person, the Mandrake root is thus a type of home musculus. The first time Oculus was made by that old rascal paracelsus out of a bag of bones, sperm skin fragments and animal hair. These ingredients laid in the ground surrounded by horse manure for 40 days, at which point the embryo formed. It seems likely that paracelsus was making this up. As I tried it, I was looking forward to having a little homunculus running about the place, and was even thinking up a suitable name for it. But when I dug up the patch of manure, there was no sign of any such being. The Mandrake itself features in another ancient hohman culus recipe. The route has to be picked before dawn on a Friday morning by a black dog, then Washington fed with milk, honey and blood. I was going to try this approach to but I was unable to find a suitable dog. And that means that you know how many you've got to get you, you've got to get the dog to. It's all very complicated this business with dogs and dogs and Mandrake roots. Anyway, a particularly thrilling method of creating a home Oculus was given by Dr. David Christiana of guyson. In the 18th century, he suggested taking an egg laid by a Black Hand, poking a tiny hole through the shell, replacing a beam sized portion of the white with human sperm, sealing the opening with Virgin parchment and burying the egg in dung on the first day of the march lunar cycle. Do this he confidently announced an offer The 30 days a miniature humanoid would emerge, which would help and protect its creator in return for a steady diet of lavender seeds and earthworms. I'm going to have a bash at this method next March, and I'll let listeners know how I get on.

To end today's show. I'd like to tell you about Blodgett fiendish X ray plot. Some say Blodgett conceived his fiendish X ray plot as revenge against a world that laughed at him because he was a short man, but they're wrong. Blodgett was not of diminutive stature. He was actually somewhere between six and seven feet tall. Although it's hard to be precise, because he was resistant to tape measures. They would become knotted or twisted, or indeed simply burst into inexplicable flames when Blodgett was near, at a snap of his fingers. similar devices, such as rulers or yardsticks would crumble to sawdust, if they were wooden, or just dust if made of some other substance. Remember that Blodgett was a frightening frightening man. He conceived his fiendish X ray plot on a wild and windy Thursday, just a week after vilhelm Conrad earthscan discovered x rays accidentally while studying cathode rays in a high voltage gaseous discharge tube. Despite the fact that the tube was encased in a black cardboard box urrent can notice that a barium platino cyanide screen placed nearby by chance emitted fluorescent light whenever the tube was in operation, hearing the news on some sort of criminal grapevine. Blodgett immediately obtained a high voltage gaseous discharge tube and a barium platino cyanide screen. He sent his minions fanning out around town to steal a black cardboard box, and this LED is undoing. A disheveled plainclothes officer, a protege of Chief Inspector kargh pan apprehended one of Blodgett 40 thieves trundling a stolen black cardboard box down a noisy alleyway in the small hours of the morning. The box was not empty, it contained a tangle of enraged and venomous Vipers. The game was up. Sometimes when writing about failed criminal enterprises, one is tempted to embroider the bare facts in the interest of entertainment. Here, I'm content to let the facts speak for themselves. They may not speak eloquently, but they speak and that is enough 110 years after the filing of Blodgett fiendish X ray plot. And that's all we have time for this week. Thank you for listening. This has been hooting out on the air and we'll be back next week.
