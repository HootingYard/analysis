Good afternoon my name is Frankie and this is hooting out on the air. On Saturday, there was that live eight thing and I read something that Chris Martin, I think is the lead singer of Coldplay said and I think this is the direct quote. This is the greatest event ever organized, probably in the history of the world. I did like that probably. Anyway, this is the greatest radio program, probably broadcast on resonance FM, four o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon. I'm going to begin with probably, I'm probably going to begin with a piece called How to festoon yourself with old netting. Here's a surefire way to festoon yourself with old netting. First, buy a train ticket to the seaside, or more precisely to a fishing port. The more lovecraftian the better. ins mouth would be ideal, but anywhere thankfully sinister and maritime will do. As soon as you arrive, sidle insouciantly down to the key side, looking out for grizzled old fisherfolk. They may eye you with suspicion, but that's because you're a landlubber unfamiliar with the Law of the Sea. strike up a conversation, ask questions about their catch. At some point while sucking on his clay pipe or picking the bones of sprats out of his matted hair, your interlocutor will mention his fishing net. This is your chance, ask to see his net squelch across the sands with him when the tide is out. past the hour he smeared boys and the rotting tugboats and when you come to the old frayed net, slip the sea dog a fiver. He will trudge off to buy lug worms or maggots with this unexpected booty. And while he's gone, you can wrap yourself up in the net. But be sure to disentangle yourself and head back to the jetty before the tide comes in. Or you will meet a watery doom and miss your train home.

I'm suffering from a spiritual malaise. I am so sick. I haven't eaten any breakfast. I need to dine a hole in the sleeve of my jumper. But I have no further wall that matches. I feel in consequential and abandoned and remote. My cheeks blush furiously with an embarrassment born of pity. Every last pencil I have is blunt. I'm being driven crackers by my landlords drooling hound. My senses are atrophied, like a muscle unexercised. pots and pans are strewn haphazardly in my kitchen. My legs have given way I have an evil taste in my mouth. Hope is something for other people, not for me. My Tea Party is cracked and the cozy is stained and threadbare. No, the spasms can talk my features. I keep to the shadows if I have to move in the street. Do you hear that sound? It's my groan of despair. I've extinguished all the lanterns and I know in my cold base heart that they will never be lit again. The air is heavy with menace and all I can hear is the screaming of desolation and ruin. insect swarm about my face, but I cannot sleep Summon the energy to swap them away. I sprained my ankle, de-stabilize everywhere, ashes and dust. Desire her desire for me is not even a memory. feral cats hiss at me and extend their claws. Even my poultry is contaminated. All sense of urgency is lost and yet I cannot relax. My head is swimming. My shoes collecting rainwater, and my socks are soaking wet. The washbasin is cracked, the taps no longer work, even though as innocent and cherubic children spit at me. I gag on my own wretchedness. And then, with a mighty effort, I pull myself up and I trudge across Bulgaria like a whipped cooker. And I go to the central post office building in Plovdiv, and I look at the Yogi Bhajan loves mural. Yes, that D will be boschi love, whose nickname was salona, or elephant, a member of the so called Plovdiv fivesome. I gaze at the post office mural, and somehow I'm pulled back from the brink and I embrace life again, wholeheartedly. blissfully. Here is a map of the center of Plovdiv to help you find your way as I found mine.

Speaking of Plovdiv ooh go lived in Plovdiv in the fog to go goofed off. There you go. Ooh, go goofing off again said who goes Ma. It was foggy. Ego stepped in some guru. He got it on his boots. Ma I've got Google on my boots said Ugo. Who goes Maher gave him a rag to wipe the goo off his boots. She had a draw of Google's cue gauze and drags. Goes Maher was blind, so when to go goofed off and got goo on his boots. She opened the drawer of Googles and rags and rummaged feeling for a rag rather than a Google for if she gave Google a Google he wouldn't get the glue off his boots, but with a rag he would go sat in the porch after goofing off and wipe the goo off his boots with a rag in the fog in Plovdiv.

This is one of those weeks where there's a kind of splendid segue between each piece. So we had a piece mentioned in Plovdiv, and then another piece mentioning Plovdiv. That was a piece which mentioned a Google. And here is another piece, which mentions a Google. Of course, some could say that this is evidence that might I don't know what that noise was. Some would say that's evidence of my subject matter is is limited, but I prefer to see it as a very well thought out segue to make your listening experience all more pleasurable. And this is a story entitled, bronchitis person's helicopter journey. handed me that Google said the moolah the Mufti snatched the Google from the ayatollah and handed it to the Mullah. Are you going to Take the Google to the Grand Vizier asked them of the that I am said the Mullah, turning on the heel of his floppy booty and exiting through a rich brocade curtain. The ayatollahs stroked his tremendous hairy beard and looked at the Mufti. Do you have your portable two metal Tapping Machine on you? he asked. And on seeing the Mufti nod he added, I want you to contact them resin. The more resin cried the MFI, dumbfounded. The same, said the ayatollah leaving the Mufti to tap a message to the moon as in the ayatollah went out into the courtyard, almost hidden behind the luxuriant Mimosa Japonica, candy tuft matter lupins and oxen flip a whirring robot version of Big Bill broonzy was playing the blues. The Ayatollah was tolerant of music, so long as it was mournful. He sat down on a mat, and ran his fingers through his hairy beard again. Imagine hear a change of scene. Meanwhile, at the Grand visitors palace, the Grand Vizier was impatiently awaiting the Muller with the Google. Last week he had volunteered to undergo ideological reeducation. All the talk in the palace now was of the correct application of Mao Tatum thought. The Grand Vizier wanted the mulas Google to add to his collection of baubles, the significance of which was only now beginning to dawn on him. He popped a filbert into his mouth, and continued pacing up and down on his big and attractive carpet, his impatience growing change of scene once again. Just as the ayatollah was stroking his superb, hairy beard for the umpteenth time, the Mufti joined him in the courtyard, the Mufti had an abnormal growth on his forehead. strikingly disconcerting news, he announced, the meridian has bronchitis. The Ayatollah let go of his beard, disconcerting Indeed, he said, Go and switch off the broonzy robot, I need a bit of peace and quiet to think. In January, the remote control device for the robot had been left out in the rain, and no one had been able to repair it. So the Mufti had to fight his way through lilac flocks, cotoneaster hollyhocks, and Erica to reach the knob on the side of the machine to switch it off. Now the only sound in the courtyard was the insistent call of a corncrake. Far, far away. Suddenly, the ayatollahs ceased cogitating and spoke Mufti, he said, there is a helicopter idling on the helipad. Go to it, fetch them arisin then fly him to the Grand visitors palace. That is my clearly considered plan of how we should proceed. And so the scene was set for that historic meeting in the palace. When the Grand Vizier for Mullah the Bronx or murzin and the Mufti sat on demands in the room of baubles, their attentions fixed upon the Google

Rex tense mezzotint of the occasion, at work of the imagination, for of course he was not present, is one of his greatest mezzotints. It took him four years to complete it. And when he was done, he gave it as a gift to the ayatollah, who framed it and hung it on the wall of the courtyard, where it was soon obscured by burgeoning fleabane Veronica eglantine, hibiscus, poppies and daisies and Lady slipper an old man's beard, by saxifrage, and Narcissus, by orchids by briars, by creeping Jenny and viola, and it hangs there still, though the ayatollah is long dead on the faraway corncrake is no more

I've just been discussing with john the engineer the correct pronunciation whether it's Mufti or Mufti. I know that I think Muller is correct. Even though George W. Bush says Moore's Law, he always refers to the mu laws. And I was wondering about the difference between ayatollahs mu laws and molars and mathies or MFIs. I know that the meridian is the guy who calls the faithful to prayer Anyway, enough of this nonsense. This is called the grist. What is the Christ throughout the centuries, or to be more specific in the summer of 1127 during most of March 1784, and last week, human beings have asked this question, and I should be specific about those human beings to root and branch. I'm not entirely sure what root and branch means that I'm not entirely sure that root and branch means anything in that last sentence, but it slipped out soup to nuts, as did soup to nuts just then. This is what thinking about the grace does it seems love in our midst and toffee apples? I'm going to stop referring back times at midnight to the otherwise irrelevant phrases creeping into this serious attempt to explain to the listeners what the fourth measure growth is, or was or will be, or all three throughout the years on this delightful planet of ours, Henry. So picture yourself for a moment as a 12th century peasant scrabbling around in your accustomed mark, feel that smock, your hair will as likely as not be matted and washed and you will have several teeth missing. God be praised, brief encounter. There you are on a rain soaked morning trudging up or down the hillside to go to 10 your pigs or hens and all of a sudden the grossest invades your brain, you are understandably startled. And something this staff moment is what inspired some of history's mystics, lean and fat. That is a visitation from the grist it borrows into your brain Nestle's there a while then flees as suddenly as it came. St. Teresa of Avila may well have had an experience mutatis mutandis of the grossest. Ah, but when I said I would be specific, I was very specific. I pointed to only three occasions ghostrider Phantom pregnancy, when the Grace has made itself known. Was I right? No. That's another thing about the grace and its ability to startle is encourages us to say with certainty what is certainly not certain is still conjecture. Henry Henry. One thing we know that the grace does on its visitations, apart from making us think we have had mystic visions is to deter us from glob glob glob what is it exactly? a worm in the brain, beloved of distraction, and beloved to distraction to.

Back in the days of Starling, it was a brave soul who mocked the common term. Uncle Joe and his myrmidons tended to get attacks of the vapors when ridiculed Svetlana B was not particularly brave. However, for one thing, she mocked the common turn from the comparative safety of a radio shack hidden in a village in the English fence, which she pronounced fence. Her regular nightly broadcasts were inaudible outside the shack itself, because none of her equipment was plugged into any kind of power source. Remember that we're talking here of Finland in the 1930s you'd be lucky to get hot water out of a spigot, let alone mock the common turn and be heard by dissidents or ham radio enthusiasts in Vladivostok, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, perm or Omsk. Nevertheless, Svetlana B took no chances and her fierce mockeries of the comments were delivered in two languages unfamiliar to Stalin's brutes. She talked in Gar, a variety, a variant of mcra, spoken in the coastal towns of Eastern Ghana, and the subject of a fascinating grammar by sea Platon published in Danish in 1764. And then she repeated herself in avestan, the sacred language of Zoroastrianism. Small Zoroastrian communities still exist in the Iranian towns of Yazd and Kerman, but these were strategically unimportant to the Soviet Empire, even if her words had been transmitted, however, more often than not, they would have been drowned out by the roaring icy gales sweeping across the flat and forbidding fans. Sometimes, the Radio Shack was so cold that Svetlana B took her samovar with her to brew up some steaming mugs of tea. No one had ever told her that it was an ornamental samovar. Svetlana B's husband had a Stalinist hat, a Stalinist mustache, and a heavily pockmarked face just like Stalin. His appearance was the subject of much taunting by school age fan land rascals, but that's another story one that will keep for there is much else to tell about Svetlana B and her bilingual common turn mockery, and her samovar and defends particularly defends the cold flat, spooky, wet black friends and the nocturnal animals which creep there and the phantoms that shimmer in the mist. I will tell you more on another night children. For now it's time for your bedtime snack of fish heads and hot cocoa.

Two days in the life of Blodgett. It was a splendid Thursday morning, the schools and drizzle was over. I sat in my space space age brunch module having a key snacking occasion, not unaware that the price of Brent crude had shot through the roof. I kept a couple of barrels in the cellar under a tarpaulin and decided to go and check that they had not been disturbed. gulping down the last of my vitamin enhanced celery and watercress health drink with added ion. I was about to unlatch the pod in which I stored all the house keys when something appalling happened. Later that day, as I drove it unimaginable speed across the tundra, the sound of Tice Van lirs introspection one CD blaring out of the speakers. All thoughts of prog rock were forgotten when I had to swerve to avoid an obstacle which appeared suddenly in front of me. Such abrupt movements did not suit my turbo propulsion eight Wheeler and I knew immediately that the suspension was wrecked. I brought the vehicle to a halt, mopped my brow and looked back. What was that thing I had so nearly smashed into. It was the shape of a breakfast cereal packet, but much much bigger and emitted a glow. That Sixth Sense told me was dangerously radioactive. I flipped open my micro communicator, adjusted the nozzles and shouted into it. Bala slab I yelled. You'd better get down here at once. Next morning in the lab, I watched as Bala slab fiddled about with any number of complicated mechanical bitty Bobs. I was tired. I'm going to take a nap I told my pneumonia racked colleague. Wake me up if anything happens. I trudged weirdly through the corridors towards the stairwell bunk bed sector. How did I get lost? I thought I knew this place as well as I knew my reflection in the shaving mirror, but I was wrong. 10 minutes after leaving the lab, I was completely incapable of recognize my surroundings. exhaustion made me decisive. I slid open the next door I came to enter the chamber and found myself face to face with something indescribable.

That evening we had a dinner party, Snetterton was talking about hedge fund acquisition analysis models in his entertaining way. But I had other things on my mind. Earlier, I had read an E Codex, raising the specter of hectic global mayhem, and I was determined to put a stop to it. excusing myself from the table by muttering something about a missing fork. I headed for the pantry and switched on the secret receiver. Ignoring the blue sparks and crackles from this antiquated device. I placed my ear against the node. At that very moment, a terrified weasel bashed across the room and sprang at me. That was Thursday and Friday. I was looking forward to the weekend more than ever.

This is called How to look after a horse. It's in the form of question. Questions and Answers. Have you a horse? I have a horse. This horse you have has it been known to suffer from some common ailments of the horse? A horse I have a knowledge of horse health I have not better say horse ill health than horse health. Lack of horse ailment knowledge would suggest you know not of savins Sweeney, herringbone wind goals, pole evil callus cracked heels, goals of all kinds fresh wound sprains, bruises fistula set fast sand cracks, stains, lameness, foundered feet, scratches or grease, mange rheumatism, bites of animals, external poisons, painful nervous affections, frostbite boils, combs, wet clothes, burns and scalds, chill blanes chapped hands cramps, contraction of the muscles swellings, weakness of the joints, caked breast, etc. I know them not, but find it hard to credit they are all ailments of horse. They are indeed not entirely those of the horse. But of that no matter. My point is that by making purchase of George W merchants celebrated gargling oil unparalleled in the history of medicine as the most remarkable external application ever discovered for horses and human flesh, you will cure your horse of all a specified ailments. I suppose that could be considered an advertisement really. But if you've got a horse, and if it suffers from any of those things, apparently gargling oil is what you need. That's the end of this week's show. I do hope you've enjoyed listening. I'll be back next week. And remember, this is repeated at 830 on Saturday morning. Bye
