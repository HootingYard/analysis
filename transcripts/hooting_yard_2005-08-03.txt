Good afternoon This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key. I'd like to begin this week with a book review. Yeah, a book review is a thumping great tome. And it's nothing less than the incredibly detailed report of the Commission of Inquiry into the provision of public transport services in and around hooting yard, as requested by civic functionaries many, many years ago. It would want there'll be a kindness simply to burn the thing. After all, is anyone ever gonna read it? Apart from me? And I'm only reading it because I'm reviewing it. Did it not occur to its compilers that decades old research can't simply be written up over the succeeding years with agonizing slowness, and retain any validity. One notes that the authors have opted to remain anonymous or semi anonymous, in that they've given their identities only in the form of cryptic crossword crows. So for example, the general editor is spigot in lane gets Plank with Dutch cheese for eight the associate editors dad's pie on hinge six nine and P which churchgoer frantic with collapsed lung says monster there's a deputy editor tenebrous elk

1012 and then a picture editor sounds like miasma of clack or gruul hold sideways, seven, seven and some kind of assistant large pig on holiday Island six nine as Terry Thomas used to say one absolute shower. This enormous volume is basically a mishmash of risible twaddle. Take this quotation for example, the gorgeous Vaporetto O's which ply the canals of hooting yard, are run by a forward thinking company, which emblazoned all its vessels with a startling logo of a budgerigar. It's difficult to conceive of a sentence of similar length which contains so many errors. Or this the bus route between blister lane and the die works at true powervr has won many awards for its revolutionary approach to timetabling. Not least the employment of little Severin the mystic badger, a real badger, who predicts the timing of the buses by doing something or other with his paws. Little Severin is kept in touch at the bus Depo and has become a star of local press and radio. He's also become the official sponsor of the annual cake show. And then just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, how about this. Another quote, the infrastructure of the pneumatic railway system with its nerve center on Yoko Ono Boulevard was designed upon the territorial patterns of the funnel web spider, hence the breathtaking beauty of the interchanges, sidings and station t rooms. dismissing the text with a groan of disgust, the reader turns to the maps, charts, statistical tables and appendices, hoping that here at least some sense might be run from this preposterous book. All I can say is that it looks to me as if the work was farmed out to a gaggle of the younger inmates in the lunatic wing of Pang Hill orphanage. What we have here, and it takes up over a third of the book as a whole is a hideous collection of dorbz, blobs and scribbling. Nor does it help that most of the pages at least have the copy that I was given, appear to have been dusted with egg yolk and breadcrumbs. There are those who will say that this undoubtedly imposing publication is a bargain, costing just eight pounds 40 and that I am merely a cantankerous and grumpy reviewer with an axe to grind because my own essay the psychic significance of a flat face structure for all journeys on the fiendish Ponce with LNG and gas powered sub Aqua taxi service was refused by the publishers at the last minute on the clearly ridiculous grounds that it was pompous and self interested. Overall writing build.

For many years, I have been plagued by nightmares about Emily Dickinson. Sometimes, the belle of Amherst comes wafting towards me hovering in the air surrounded by malignant hens or similar poultry. Sometimes I dream that I'm sitting in a shaded Bower, scented by honeysuckle and lilac idli. reading some imaginary pamphlet of Dobsons when with terrifying suddenness, a Wraith like Emily Dickinson appears before me wailing, flailing a Cutlass or Scimitar at my head, a ghastly Rictus distorting her face. Other times I have woken with lovecraftian shutters, trying to expel horrible nightmare visions of Emily Dickinson sat in the crow's nest of a pirate ship, a necklace of teeth and bones around her white neck, dropping cake crumbs onto the heads of the sailors below. So every now and then, I find that by contemplation of the poet's tombstone with that wording, called back May the 15th 1886. I can remind myself that she is indeed dead and gone. And so for a few nights, at least, my sleep is untroubled by her restless spirit.

Unknown Speaker  07:40
Last week, I read an excerpt from from what I said was one of my favorite ever books, further science book 20 by Norman Davis, this mysterious little book I found in a secondhand shop. And I've complained about the fact that there's no information to tell you, you know, its origin, where it came from, and the content let me just give you an idea of the content, mammal bone structure, local recipe map. That's what I read last week, carnivore teeth, fashion sequence, vegetable weight sequence world proverbs pro and anti Lyme melting point sequence Atlantic fish and birds fly psychology world flag psychology and so it goes on the great thing about it is that each piece is completely self contained and the great Norman Davis Where is he now? And who is he never gives any kind of introductory comments no background no sources. You just get his wonderful numbered paragraphs and every single piece ends with the word etc. So I thought this week's this way I think I'll read it something from Norman Davis every week because it's very good stuff. And this is this is birthday month types. So you can listen as we go through the go through the months. And you can you can wait for your your birthday month and think Is that me? birthday month types by Norman Davis from further science book 21. January Dark Twisted tough to February. large open fair delicate, nervous smile. Three March.

Well, he is the he doesn't think he is just a great, great book.

Imagine just for a moment that you live in ancient Latvia. And imagine that it's Cassie Maria's DNI. The festival which commemorates the return of the larks being an ancient Latvian, you know for well what larks are passerine birds of the predominantly Old World family are loaded by small terrestrial birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. Often you have pointed out to your ancient Latvian powers that larks nest on the ground, laying between two to six speckled eggs. Sometimes you get into arguments with your ancient Latvian next hut neighbor, who insists that most locks are fairly dull in appearance. Both of you agree, however, that their food is insects and seeds. Now, Amity restored you set off arm in arm with your neighbor for the festival. Look are vids you say pointing to a nearby bird.

Unknown Speaker  13:11
a lark.

Unknown Speaker  13:14
Indeed, it is a Gil's says your neighbor. But what species of Lark do you suppose it is? Well, now Arvid you reply. I must confess I'm not entirely sure. There are so many different species of larks monotonous singing Bush, Australasian Bush, latter coup, white tailed Madagascar, Kordofan, Williams Freedmen's red winged Somali long build ashes, Angola Rufus night flap it clapper colored Indian bush gilets form colored Rufus winged Bush, Rusty pink breasted, two goatee and sobotta to name but 25 egg gills eggshells replies Arvid Are you not forgetting the Rufus rumped dusky archers Sidamo rods cape? The algo has Easton and Kuru long build Benguela short Claude Joon Kuru Barlow's ferruginous and spike Hill locks to say nothing of the sparrow locks. Sparrow locks are vids, you ask plaintively. Yes, Engels says of it's not just the black beard and the chestnut back but the black crowned and gray backed and chestnut headed and fishes and actually crowned. Oh, of course of IDs you say? Now you come to mention it. I used to have a tame chestnut headed Sparrow lock. Are you sure that's what it was a girl's challenges Arvid a theist look in his blazing eyes. Are you quite sure it wasn't a Bartell Rufus tailed desert grade greater or lesser hupo fick build caloundra by Matt culated Tibetan manga or white winged Lark you are now beginning to feel defeated by your neighbor's superior Lark knowledge. I suppose it might have been a black or a greater short Toad Lark of IDs, you whimper. Well that says may be says of IDs. But what about the lock over there which has now taken up a perch on the branch of that lightning struck punkten tree? Is it a Blanford Humes letter short toed red kept Asian short toed sand Somali short toed pink build both as Slater's Avia masked DUNS or Starks Lark do you think? Well, it's definitely not a Starks, you say confidence boosted a little, although perhaps it might be a DuPont facula Malabar, some torgny long build short tailed wood or Skylark ovens. For sure eggshells. You will be telling me next delivered a Japanese oriental or Razzle Skylark, or even a horned or short or temin Clark

Unknown Speaker  16:08
Well,

Unknown Speaker  16:08
at least I know it's not a magpie, Lark of its you say, which is actually neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant monarch fly catcher. I'm well aware of that eagles, your neighbor reposts By this time, the bird which in which was in fact a crested Lark has flown away, and raindrops are beginning to fall in ancient Latvia.

Unknown Speaker  17:01
This is an old favorite. This is a recipe for gruul you will need the following ingredients out water. You will need the following equipment. A big pot, a big spoon the Holy Bible. On a blustery winter's day, with a chill in the very marrow of your poor poor bones. Take the big pot and carry it trudging through snow to the rusty spigot on the other side of the village. weeping, use what little strength you have to turn the spigot until a woeful dribble of brackish water appears. Make sure you place the big iron pot under the drip so that water collecting it. With luck and prayer. You should find that the pot is about three quarters full before Twilight. When of course the village curfew comes into effect. The evil Grand Vizier proclaimed so in his UK case, to make sure that all pious people are behind their latched and bolted doors by nightfall. Place the big part on your oven and set it on full. Remember that it can take electric cookers longer to heat up and gas ones but do not despair. Once your ovens maximum heat is reached, the water will bubble away like nobody's business to prevent steam escaping. It's a splendid idea to cover the pot if long ago when you were feckless, you lost or mislaid the lid of your pot. Or if indeed your pot never had a lid for not all pots do. You can of course improvise a lid using all sorts of debary strewn Higgledy Piggledy about your hovel. Just be sure you use flame resistant debris please. Now then, while you're waiting for the water to come to the boil, you can go and find the oats while I take a well earned nap.

Unknown Speaker  19:18
Fully rested and in tip top condition. Let us press on without further ado, for by now, your pot of water should be boiling. Please pay attention as the next step if humbled will put paid to your dearest wish, which is to make a successful pot of gruel. with your right hand scoop some oats from the pail. Grasp the lid of the pot. If there is a lid in your left hand and lift it free of the pot. cast a handful of votes into the seething cauldron and Replace the lid. You may repeat this step once or twice, but on no account overdo the oats as this will start Boil your grill making it too thick. And as the only remedy for this would be to add more water, you would have to return to the spigot, breaking the village curfew, and so risk being clubbed within an inch of your life by merciless curfew cadets and your grill in perfect though it may be would then go to waste sin upon sin. You are now free to allow the contents of the pot to boil merrily away. Although of course from time to time you want to brandish the big spoon in your fist and give the rule to be a mighty stir. In the intervals between stirrings you must know on no account remain idle. This is the perfect time to read improving passages from the Bible. Indeed, why not throw open your door stand up bright and magnificent in your weed choked yard and to claim the scriptures in a booming voice for the benefit of whoever may be within earshot in the vast and pitiless night. To little reminders, though, however resounding your declaration, do not allow into your tone, even the most miniscule taint of vanity. Remember that you are merely a vessel and a singularly unlovely vessel at that, a tarnished urn, say, or a grubby Baker. Second, do not forget the pot. For if it is neglected, you're likely to make not gruul but an inferno. Oh, I said two reminders, but there's a third, use your calf to rub a modicum of grime from your hovel window. Do you see a bleak and illimitable Vista of ice and snow? Are you marooned in an Arctic wasteland? If so, you may succumb to the delusions of pi bloco in which case you should refrain from following the directions of this recipe until you are relieved of your symptoms and are restored to your usual vigor. I need hardly point out the dangers of cooking when you are bonkers. Though I have written an excellent little book entitled safe and simple snacks for the biddenden the fraud, which is charmingly illustrated. The original pencil sketch of a cream cracker has been framed and displayed on the wall of my splendid restaurant in hemoglobin towers. Where were we? Ah yes, once the once the grill is fully boiled, replace the Bible on your lectern or summer at any rate where it will be safe from defilement. If such a cranny exists in your hovel. Hold the spoon in your right hand, removing the pot lid with your left. Give the girl one last stir. Remove from heat. Allow to stand for 10 minutes. Using a big ladle transfer into preheated tin bowls and serve best eaten with a spoon

suitable for home freezing. Since you've been gone, all that's left is a band of gold LeMay suited troubadours. They arrived shortly after you flounced off with your Gordy reticule in one hand, and a map of 10 Tara beam in the other as Bob Dylan one saying, You left me standing in the doorway crying, but not for long. Soon the band of gold LeMay suited troubadours arrived quite unannounced and made themselves at home. I fed them with what was left in the fridge, basil, glucose tablets and chopped up Sue it and went up to the attic to consult Dobson's little known Tip Top Encyclopedia of Tip Top pop bands out of print. downstairs, I could hear the band tuning up for what turned out to be a jam session as the young people say. And what did I learn from Dobson's encyclopedia? I discovered that my uninvited but not unwelcome guests had began life as a skift skiffle, I'm going to start that sentence again. I discovered that my uninvited but not unwelcome guests had began life as a skiffle combo called the urbane. Blodgett seven writing the 16 why They tried out various styles until in 1969, they emerged utterly transformed as the pioneers of glob music. By now, they had settled on the name of the Hinduism nozzles after being told that there are other choices, among them fog hat, the carpenters, Petula Clark, and blogged when pig had already been nabbed by other acts. The 1970s were kind to them, and they had a string of hit albums including bail for porpoise, Jesuit Google handler, and IRQ, the Shibboleth. The release of their album brain salad surgery was postponed indefinitely after a rival album was released by a so called prog rock group, whose name Dobson could not remember, despite all the research materials listed in what nesting bird has dubbed his most exhaustive appendix. Curiously, that latter phrase most exhaustive appendix was used as the title of the hinges and nozzles compilation CD, which was released only days before they showed up at my house. And they're still there by the way, and have told me in no uncertain terms, as the saying goes, that they will not leave until you come back to me. Oh, my darling. Oh, baby, baby, please won't you come on home?

Unknown Speaker  27:11
That one began. Since you'd be gone, all that's left is a band of gold LeMay suited criminals. Free to paint I think saying that. You probably know the beginning of this one, too. Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river. She feeds you tea and oranges. It would be more accurate to say that she false feeds you the oranges, given that you've only just eaten and I've already told her that you have stomach cramps. Suzanne is feeding you oranges when what you asked her for was Dr. Boswell's Alexia promoted in television adverts as the most effective indigestion remedy of the 21st century. Although you suspect strongly that doctor Boswell is a fictional character rather than a real doctor, his white coated, bespectacled avuncular figure with that reassuring blend of piercing intelligence and a kindly bedside manner a little too good to be true. He still wants to take a draft of his Alex here, and all you get is a mug of tea and a bowl of oranges, which Suzanne starts ramming into your mouth without even peeling them first. Clearly, she's trying to choke you. What can you do? her place near the river is far away from any other buildings, and no one is going to come and help you even if you manage to spit out the oranges and scream your head off. Before you lose consciousness, you reflect ruefully if it's possible to be rueful, while panic stricken that you had absolutely no idea Suzanne was a homicidal maniac on the loose, whose modus operandi is the infliction of death by fruit. You can hear the boats go by. But that's not much solace now. For in about five minutes time, your body will end up in a cellar of Suzanne's place near the river, lying alongside the corpse of a man who was beaten to death with a kumquat.

And that's all we have time for from hooting out this week. More pros next week and and another selection from further science by Norman Davis, which might be limestone stroke, sandstone, or it might be Europe reds soups. Yeah, that's it.
