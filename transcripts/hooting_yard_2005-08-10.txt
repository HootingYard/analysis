Good afternoon. My name is Frankie and this is hooting yd on the air live from live from the resonance HQ in central London just down the road in fact from the Job Center where mass murderer Dennis Nilsen used to work. Not sure why I mentioned that but I do. before reading any stories or anything this week, I'd like to just announce an event. On Thursday next, Mr. taplow will be presenting a talk at sawdust bridge salvation Hall. He has made private arrangements to rent the building for the evening. So the usual manicuring session will not take place. Mr. Tableau intends to discuss the relative merits of blubber and tallow with specific reference to the manufacturer of candles. Most of you will know that Mr. taplow is blind. The talk is scheduled to begin at 7:30pm after which there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. Although Mr. taplow has indicated that he may not have time to answer more than a couple as he will have to dash off on horseback to a mountainous retreat by 9:45pm. The trustees of sawdust bridge salvation Hall have made arrangements for little snacks to be served to those attending. Although no crockery will be provided. Mr. Tap blows guide dog Agamemnon will be on hand to gobble up any spillages such as cake crumbs. Agamemnon will not be accompanying his master to the mountains, so if anyone can provide the hand with a comfortable place to sleep for a night, that would be appreciated. Mr. taplow says he will collect the dog within six working days. Those who know Mr. taplow only from his talks on ostriches fog, the brains of geese shrew polish and Crosby, Stills and Nash. Well, we hope be pleasantly surprised by his erudition in what is for him a brand new topic. As ever, state of the art technology will be used to make a recording of the talk for future releases a compact disc with a cover designed by noted local mezzotint test Rex tent. Please note that all those attending are asked to bring either a blubber candle or a tallow candle, but not both. stewards will be on hand to allocate seats on the night. The attic of sawdust bridge salvation Hall is still infested with weird bird like life forms which screech horribly, but rest assured they're quite harmless. Tickets for this exciting event are available from all those kiosks clustered around the Market Square, or by post from Mr. Tap close, exciting talks.

This is a story called it was dusk. And before I could have had a glass of water in that little break, but I didn't solve to that now. Bear with me. Much better. It was dusk. It was dusk and wantons had gathered in the spinny beyond the spinny across the lake, with the running track where Bob next to Vall had sprinted his way to immortality. The track side, where once a loop inside flamed forth, was now overgrown with tarrlok and bind weed and blackish Darnell clumps of which were thickest by the old Well, were long, long ago, the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo woman had cast her spells. When they marked out the track back in 1934. They'd forgotten about the well. They'd forgotten about the Hornets too, and the wasps and the bees, all of them drawn to the field for as long as anyone could remember, and never successfully exterminated. Even the sulfur bombs detonated by old halabi squad of flying insect killers failed. Back then, of course, old hollub was not yet old, but he had already cultivated a certain gravitas punk attilio came to him later. Now the ghost of old halb and that fictional and fictional sprint champion botnet to vault haunt that long abandoned athletics venue. That is why at dusk over in the spinny, the wantons gather, dressed in flowing gowns stitched together from fire damaged curtain material, the wantons descend upon the spinny with baskets of peppers and pea pods and potatoes bring me brimming baskets from which the peppers and peapods and potatoes tumbled and as strewn as the ones and skip along the path that leads to the spinny no wanton Stoops to pick up the fall and vege. As dusk falls, for they like to lay a trail. They make no secret of their gathering in the spinny across the lake from the route and running track. All the town's folk know they are heading there at dusk on the third Thursday of each month, the skipping wantons with their baskets, but they're never followed. In the town shutters are shot and lamps lit and in their gloomy rooms that people switch on their radios loud and listened to dance band music of the Golden Age, and distract themselves with card games and sharada. For they try not to think about the wantons in the spinny summoning up the ghosts of botnets tavole and old hollub. By the running track itself as dusk grows deeper, the Hornets and bees and wasps no longer stir. They go wherever flying insects go at night or they sleep if such creatures sleep in their nests, hidden in the brambles and the bind we'd often the field that once or Bob knit have all run round and round in record time is engulfed in mist, wider the wantons gathering the spinny across the lake instead of here. It is because they believe that phantoms are imbued with special powers if they're made to cross a body of water. The wantons want Bob in it to volt and hollub all their spirits to materialize among the slumbering Hornets and wasps and bees of the derelict running track, and then to pass over the still silent lake and thus to come to them in the spinny. These athletic ghosts empowered by water will be given offerings of peppers and pea pods and potatoes and then the wantons will send them into the town to do what the wantons want done. But nobody yet knows what the wantons want. From no third Thursday have the ghosts come shimmering across the lake to them. Know, the wantons wait all night skipping while they wait in circles, their gowns flowing and adorn, they skip away from the spinny their baskets empty back into the town where radios still blare, where the shutters are still shot into the door of another day, when no one will speak the names of halabi or botnet tavole. Not today nor ever more for of course, neither Wiley trainer nor his protege ever existed in the first place. And if they're ghosts do appear, it is only once a month, one misty night in the wild minds of the wanton to skipping the spinny.

I thought this week I was going to read a series of pieces about swarms of killer bees. But I decided against that and instead is a kind of ragbag of lots of short pieces, many of them very new, many of them written in the last week or so. And all of them available on the hooting yard website and I've decided the quickest way to get there is not for me to read out the rather lengthy web address but if you put hooting yard into Google is the very first site that comes up. This is called weathering the storm. Sometimes I think it's very important to weather a storm. Too often it's tempting to take the easy option and not to weather it but rather to succumb to it. Like You I have been battered by girls in the past and it's not a pretty sight. stumbling out of a tempest with a disheveled Buffon and wet clothing. I have taken refuge in the loopy cops tea rooms. Order the plate of boiled peas and a cup of cocoa wrung out my dripping hat and averted my eyes still stinging from the cold howling winds from the other customers who are dry and insouciance and frankly hostile. contrast between the elegant tea rooms with a harp, viola and Piccolo trio playing in the corner, and the clattering storm outside could not be greater. Well, it could be, the two rooms are not quite heaven and the tempest is not quite hell, but you should try pointing that out to the customers. I did just that and I bear the psychic bruises to show for it. There is no need to be so insouciant and faintly hostile. I said to the room in general as I slumped in my chair, and then I made the comparison just mentioned, a member of the loopy cops tea rooms, staff glided over to me smooth and silent, almost like a spectral being. Excuse me, sir, she said. But you slam the door as you came in. There is a puddle of rainwater at your feet where you run out your hat. Your bouffant, is disheveled and your clothing is wet. By taking refuge in here. It is as if your very presence has brought the storm into the peaceable kingdom of our tea rooms.

Unknown Speaker  11:08
I the storm,

Unknown Speaker  11:09
I shouted. She leaned to whisper into my air. pause a moment and take the time to pair deeply into your soul, she said, and it may become clear to you that there is much truth in my words. Now I'm going to fetch your dish of boiled peas. And Coco I asked, but she had already flitted away. I noticed now that the other customers were staring at me. There were only four of them sat together at a table holding hands as if in a seance, the trio struck up a new tune, one I did not recognize. I made a sort of huffing noise and pretended to examine the menu. Even though I had already ordered my snack. My thoughts were jumbled and incoherent. was either storm personified? Was the weather simply a projection of my inner being? Did I have unknown power over the elements? Was I a god. Suddenly, the dish of boiled peas was placed before me. They were poisoned peas, or perhaps I should say, in chanted peas, for after I had eaten them piping hot. I was transported to an ethereal plane, where it seemed the universe was loopy cops, tea rooms, and loopy cops. Tea rooms were the universe, eternal and illimitable. Somehow I knew that if I drank the cup of cocoa that was brought to me, the spell if spell it was would be broken, so I let it grow cold. I put my hat on my head, paid my bill and walk towards the door. Outside the storm had died away. Sky overcast, light, drizzle, temperature mild growing colder towards evening I declared, and lo, it came to pass.

Unknown Speaker  13:32
Regular listeners will know that I often like to rewrite the Bible, or at least take inspiration from it. And I've always liked that phrase, the agony in the garden. This is and this is well, this is about the agony in the garden. There was a man in my back garden and he was in agony. I'm going to tell you why. This man had speared his foot with a garden fork. One of the very sharp tines of the fork could plunge through his boot and sock and foot and more sock and the sole of the boot and into the muck forced downwards by the man's other foot, or rather by the muscular power of his leg bent at the knee. He was wearing a pair of Butcher's trousers this man, but he was not a butcher. He was a clumsy thief, inexperienced in the use of gardening implements. It was the middle of the night and there was no moon or I should say the moon was hidden by monstrous black clouds, so it was very, very dark. Nonetheless, one would have thought the thief who clambered over a fence to steal things from my back garden would have carried a torch or some other means of illuminating his criminal intent. But not only was he a clumsy thief, he was a thief who lacked foresight. Because the day was still night when he set out from the heart Oh ne'er do wells where he lived. He seems to have assumed would still be light when he approached the wooden fence which divides my back garden from the old muddy lane. But it was no longer light. I lived so far away from the heart that it took him hours and hours to reach my garden. His route was crooked and even convoluted, for he hugged the hedgerows and dared not stride across open fields, nor follow main roads, and nor did he risk using any of the public transport systems available. The pneumatic railways or the canal barges for being bent on crime he did not wish to be seen. He may have been clumsy and lacking in foresight, but the man in my back garden whose foot was impaled by a fork was a master of stealth. I'll give him that. In all the hours he sculpts across the land in his books, his trousers and pastry makers jacket and Dusty Springfield hat. He was not seen by a single other living being, except for some cows in a field and a passing goat and attentive birds, and countless tiny things that creep and fly and hover and buzz. But none of these can speak unlike human beings, who have they seen the thief might have denounced him to the police. For all his stealth, however, and irrespective of the CAC handedness of his folk digging, the clumsy thieves crime would never have succeeded. He had not made rigorous plans. had he done so he would have learned that I am a detective whose tenacity in tracking down malefactors is legendary. One of the things that makes me so good at my job is the fact that I never sleep. As a child at a fairground. On a hot September day, I toppled from the top of a Helter Skelter and landed on my head. I have never since then visited the land of nod. The metal plate in my skull is barely visible. And it's been one of the incidental pleasures of my life to a massive collection of strikingly colorful eye patches. So it was that in the middle of the night when all sensible people are fast asleep in their beds, I was wide awake. I can't remember what I was doing darling an eyepatch or sharpening a pencil perhaps, or carrying out experiments on a badger. When I heard the telltale sounds of a wrongdoer climbing over the fence from the old muddy lane, I went over to the window. My working eyes are superb mechanism. And I watched as in pitch darkness. The thief grabbed the fork from the pile of forks, searched the lawn for the big chalk x underneath which was buried the beauty of the Ballista line bank robberies and with his very first fork thrust, speed his foot and how old I promised to tell you how they came to be a man in my back garden, a man in agony, and now I've done so and you can't say fairer than that.

Unknown Speaker  19:15
We have a slightly longer break between pieces than usual because something really incredibly fascinating happened but I can't really tell you what it was. I might tell you next week through clenched teeth in municipal, yet Verdun Parkland, sprawled on grass. Blodgett recited the alphabet. A is for vinegar, he granted, B is for worms. C is for villains swinging from the gallows. A little voice inside blogilates had told him to stop. He knew he'd got it wrong again. He rolled himself down the gentle incline of the grass until he came to rest. Then he sat up and picked flecks of plant life out of his hair. The sun was shining But the park was almost deserted. He peered across the green towards the truck eyes and licked his lips when he splashed out on a choc ice. Blodgett fumbled in his pockets for change, but they were empty. He wondered if there was anybody in charge of the truck ice tent. Perhaps it too was deserted, and the truck offices were there for the taking. It was more likely there would be some kind of automatic truck ice dispenser. But Blodgett knew he could Jimmy open with his Jimmy, but he recalled that he had left his Jimmy at home in a cupboard with his empty yogurt cartons. Blodgett always pronounced yogurt as your cohort. He was that kind of guy. He laid down again and closed his eyes and clenched his teeth and made yet another attempt to the alphabet. A is for spinach. B is for the wildlife of the Great Lakes sea is for pol pot. It was no use. clambering to his feet. Blodgett ran across the green to the paddling pool. Though it was the height of summer the pool had been drained. All the water had been collected in a sort of giant concrete bath located a few feet below ground in accessible to anyone who was not employed by the municipal Park authorities. Had Blodgett known that several Park keepers were at that very moment enjoying frolics in the subterranean pool, he would have become angry, and had he become angry, he would have tilted his head up and stared boldly at the sun and let forth a stream of executions, and the sun would have shriveled up and died. Such was the force of Blodgett in human rage. But Blodgett did not know about the underground paddling pool, nor of the antics taking place down there. So the sun was safe. He turned away and headed for the gate in the fence. He had decided to go to the docks to watch the arrival and departure of gigantic container ships. It was Wednesday, and he was shorter, see big boxes of bananas and bales of fracks.

Those of you who visit the voting yard website will know that every day or at least every day that is updated, which is hopefully you know, three, four or five times a week away I always begin with a quotation from elsewhere. And the other day, I love this quotation is from an old book called The English gypsies in their language by Charles de Leyland. I may get I may get the pronunciation of some of this wrong, and I certainly have no idea what it means but it's just a really good quotation. The IV and Holly and pine rocks never poke at a lab when our Savior was gathering of his cocoa. And so they tools they're driven beans or the when and dig sell notes or the bash, but the ash like the saarela rock pocket attacked him where he was gathering. So they have to hatch mala D the van and so we Romany childs always hatches and the ash Yag saw the Borah devices for the techno duvel was Civ to address the previous like a Romany Tao and kister that prior Milo like a Romney and child pail the Tamar Mangan his Morrow like a ROM. And he was always a poor very Charo mush. Like we tell he was naturally by the gorgos. As I say, I may have pronounced some of those words wrong and but what you know, now should bother gorgos I wouldn't want that to happen to me, it doesn't sound good. I'm not sure what it does mean, but it doesn't sound good. And onwards to the educational spot in the program. Regular listeners know that we like to like to provide provide some useful information. Anyway, this is part one of bird recognition skills. It's a new course by the hooting yard educational outreach hub. If you complete this course you can do advanced bird recognition skills, and locust and killer bee recognition skills. But this is the first module of the first module of bird recognition skills. One of the beak a surefire method of deciding whether the animal you're looking at is a bird is to check whether it has a beak effect has their nine times out of 10 it will be a bird. The beak, otherwise known as the bill is the only device a bird has for consuming food. birds have no teeth, so they must swallow their food hole. A bird beak can vary in size and shape depending on the nature of their diet. Some birds such as Falcons or Falcons, and I never have known how to pronounce that properly, have evolved to have a cutting type beak, which allows them to tear through flesh with violent and blood crazed savagery, whereas the hummingbird has a probe like beak which allows it to drink the nectar from certain flowers, such as primroses, buttercups, and elecampane. Although you'd be advised to check the accuracy of those examples in a botanical dictionary, such as an alphabetical guide to what every infant should know about the majesty of nature by Dobson. The beak is composed of an upper jaw called the maxilla and a lower jaw called the mandible. From this the student can infer that all birds have two drawers. Remember that bird beaks are useful in other ways. For example, wood cutters use theirs to cut wood obviously, and parrots have sharp swiveled beaks to tear fruit, although they're ripping and tearing is not quite as maniacal as those Falcons or Falcons mentioned earlier. small mammals like hamsters and guinea pigs are quite safe from the average parrot, which is more likely to become ravenously ferocious in the presence of a grapefruit or a fig. flamingos have long beaks to pull out fish from water, and ducks have flat beaks that allow them to retain all the fish and plants while draining out the water. Generally speaking, if it hasn't got a beak, it's unlikely to be a bird. Try not to confuse a beak with a beaker, which is a drinks container like a mug or a tumbler, often but not always made of plastic, or with the beaker people which refers to an archeological culture present in prehistoric Europe, defined by a pottery style a beaker with a distinctive bell shaped profile that many archaeologists believe spread across the western part of the continent during the third millennium BC.

Unknown Speaker  27:25
If you've been paying attention, you should be able to differentiate between those long dead people and present day birds. In closing, please remember that although they can fly locusts do not have beaks. Therefore they're not birds. And to test your knowledge of what I've just read, there are two sample questions. Now you may wish to write these down and hand them around among the family or maybe you just, you know, answer them here and now. And I'm not going to give you the correct answers Until next week, one, complete the following sentence. That carbon based living organism over there perched on a tree branch has a beak. So it must be a a weasel be a big magnetic robot. See a bird. And question two. Imagine you're living in the third millennium BC and you're holding a bell shaped piece of pottery. Are you a a member of the beaker people or be a cancer worry?

Finally, this week witless Fabiola witless Fabiola is one of the archetypes in the complex mythology of the tongue list of the many stories about her perhaps the most important is the legend in which he sent out west on a tandis quest to find a hornet's nest, but becomes distressed and sits down to rest. And while she rests, she has a dream about her drawing bream swimming in a stream lit by a moonbeam the color of cream. In other tales witless. Fabiola does deeds of derring do fights Phantom crustacea in the tide pools of tan Tara beam, wraps herself in flags and in an apocryphal story turns into a zombie goddess who causes thunderstorms and blizzards and other meteorological phenomena. weightless Fabiola is usually depicted holding a trident in her left hand and some bird seed in her right. wearing a cape span of crocus stalks her left foot trampling on the neck of a subject gaited cormorant sometimes she is given a human head with a mop of frazzled black hair. Not unlike, say Robert Smith of the cure. In other images inspired by the breakaway pseudo tandis sect her head is that of a merganser duck or boobie. tandis scholar Ernesto who do who do Mojo has compiled an anthology of legends about witless Fabiola, none of which is longer than a couple of 100 words and all of which peter out. Quite irritatingly. Goodbye
