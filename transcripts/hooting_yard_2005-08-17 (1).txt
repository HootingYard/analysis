This is resonance 104 point four FM and this is the bob minute tavole variety half hour with this week's guests the chuckling maniacs. Hang on. Hang on. Sorry, I read the wrong cue card. This is I'm Frank key and this is hooting out on the air. No chuckling maniacs on this show. Just Just prose just prose for half an hour. Anyway, um, listeners in the United Kingdom know already know I expect that the shipping forecast which is broadcast on arrival radio station four times a day, to an audience, composed mainly of landlubbers ignorant of its meaning is one of our national treasures. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can always look up the shipping forecast on the Wikipedia, if you look on on the internet is a very good entry in the Wikipedia for the shipping forecast. A great part of the charm, of course, is those wonderful names Cromartie, Dogger German bite, and the other day it struck me that an equally delightful list is found in the stations on the Docklands Light Railway. Those of you who don't live in London, the Docklands Light Railway is a Light Railway in the Docklands. Anyway, here is today's DLR forecast.

I just mentioned among other stations on the DLR mudchute and I'm reminded that for many years in the last century, mudchute was the home of a mano maniac, actually to call Caspian Sea spangled bagaimana a maniac is not strictly true, for he had not one but two abiding obsessions. The first which is of little interest to us was his conviction that the tyrant of the Soviet Union was called Joseph Starling. While the heroine of Thomas Harris is novel Silence of the Lambs was named Clarice Starling being bonkers spangled Bagh was unmoved by the fact fact that the mustachioed and heavily pockmarked dictator chose than pseudonym Man of Steel in preference to his real name of Dzhugashvili. And the trouble FBI rookie is in fact a fictional character. But it was the mud shoots man's belief that hen Dyer This is a disease afflicting poultry rather than a figure of speech, which consumed most of his energies. I think it's pronounced tendinitis, although it may be handy artists but I will continue with hand diabeetus it would not be an exaggeration to say that spangled Bagg declared war on the makers of dictionaries, lexicons, grammars, and encyclopedias. Most of the major publishers of reference books have somewhere in their archives, a FAT file containing letters with that mudchute postmark, all written by pencil in tiny, tiny handwriting, their tone varying from mild complaint to violent menace. One example will suffice purchased the latest edition of your work but wordbook rights spangle bag on the 23rd of June 1989 and was surprised to see you define handedness as quote, a figure of speech in which two words connected by a conjunction are used to express a single notion that would normally be expressed by an adjective and a substantive the use of to conjoin nouns instead of a noun and a modifier. Unquote. You then go on to list instances from the Bible such as a mouth and wisdom in Luke 2115, and the hope and resurrection of the dead in Act 23. Six. I do not take kindly to spending money on such grivel and have torn your worthless book to shreds. And I would have scattered those reds to the winds from atop a hill. Were there any high hills in mud shoot, which there are not. So instead I steeped the shreds in buckets of water until they were pulp? Yes, pulp. Please correct your gruesome era in future additions or I will ensure that you become the laughingstock of the reference book world and you will weep with shame. Know that spangle bag sees no reason to advance his own belief that hen died this has something to do with sick poultry. To him it would have been to point out the obvious like saying that water is wet that the pope is Catholic, or as the Guardian announced yesterday that Victoria Beckham Posh Spice claims never have read a book in her life, not even a reference book destined for destruction by Caspian Sea spangle bag. How pertinent is the fact that this odd little man lived his whole life in mudchute, only rarely roaming farther afield. I think it's crucial. It made him what he was. Even before the construction of the Docklands Light Railway. It is as if he embodied the spirit of the place, mud shoots, mud and mud shoots shoot the caked black stinking mud and the gleaming metal shoot down which it slides and slivers and tumbles into God knows what foul pit of wretchedness and doom.

I don't know if you've come across on the internet fan fiction. It's a kind of fad. There's loads of websites where adherents of Harry Potter or the West Wing or Star Wars, etc pen their own stories about existing fictional creations. But most of the sources are from films and television rather than from books is I suppose a sign of the times, but at least these keyboard tapping enthusiasts are writing. Anyway, I was pleased to note the other day that hooting yard has attracted its own fan fiction. And here's a brief story I found about Dobson written by Ruth Hanrahan. Once upon a time there was a man called Dobson. He was a pamphleteer and all his pamphlets were out of print, at the time of which I right Dobson lived in a shack perched on a promise tree From where he could see in the far distance a lighthouse, the incessant flashing of the lights to top the lighthouse disturbed Dobson in the night, for his bedroom was on the side of the shack facing out to see and he could not afford curtains. In the town down the hill, there was a curtain shop and one day after yet another virtually sleepless night, Dobson went to the shop and asked if they had any curtains for rental. We don't rent out our curtains said the proprietor of the curtain shop curtly. Dobson was disappointed. He left the curtain shop and went across the road to the recently opened clinic of the brain doctor. Excuse me, said Dobson to the receptionist. His tone was icily calm. Would it be possible for the brain doctor to align the electrical pulsing of my brain with the rhythms of the flashing lights of the lighthouse over yonder? Yes, said the receptionist Gailey. So the brain doctor tweaked Dobson's brain that very afternoon because you're an out of print pamphleteer you don't have to pay said the receptionist as Dobson left the clinic. He marched up the hill to his track, looking forward to a good night's sleep but last, he was disconcerted then, to discover that another shack had been erected on the promontory slap bang next to his and that it was already occupied by a group of pagan percussionists whose rituals demanded that they pound their drums throughout the night to ward off I don't know something or other. Dobson was downcast until he discovered that miraculously, the rhythms of the lighthouse lights his pulsing brain and the drumming were identical. He slept well at night. And every night he spent in the shack on the prom and Cree thereafter until the following year, when he moved to a hotel in Winnipeg

mote note, Horace, Seth, and nubus these are Gods all powerful and eternal. I can picture you a few summers later, older but no wiser traipsing around in the park at lunchtime. You have a bag of breadcrumbs and you intend to cast them upon the grass as food for sparrows and magpies and starlings for Linux and ravens for bufflehead ducks and grebes sitting on the rusty bench with its rusty plaque in memory of one long dead who sat here often and adored the view the view of rooftops and chimneys and football fields and allotments of tennis courts and orchards rich in cherry trees. I see you casting your crumbs to the birds, and I know that you're not giving thanks to art and or gab or sec met or patar. No. Still at this time. Despite your riches and your bravura. Your poor head is filled with visions of its Papa local coact li que tenemos Kalki talaq Maya, Wal k ha Teto quick taco hackle popocatepetl and the like. For these are your gods in the grip of your delusions, it is perhaps not coincidental that you like to sport a yellow Polo neck sweater like the one worn by Christopher Lee in The Wicker Man and even have your hair cut in a similar mop, though you're not yet going gray and you insist that you have not seen the film for you professor devotion to the silence screen in your Pantheon.

You have seen broken blossoms more than a dozen times, and sometimes you like to pace the back streets of Limehouse, as if in search of the opium dens that are no longer there.

Yet you cling to your false gods as you feed the birds and ducks in the park shaded from notes glittering sky by the overhanging branches of Sycamores and Hazel trees on the bench by the magnificent iron railings which were replaced after the war in which you were wounded thrice. You were shot in the stomach burned by flaming barrels and crushed by Falling masonry. But now there is not a scratch on you. And you have forgotten that terrible day in shaving England. You were treated well in the field hospital. But what did you do once you could again use your hands, you scavenge scraps of wood and build a little toy altar and put it on your bedside shelf, praying to external Tom, your God of healing for having saved you from the realm of Mid Atlantic Tootle. So let us spring forward again now another 1020 years and now your hair is gray but no longer cut Allah Lord summer I'll in The Wicker Man.

You have a kitten but it hates you. You have not yet been subjugated by Bastet, but that time is drawing nigh. So you call your kitten Karen Carpenter and feed it with fish that you pluck from ponds or with eels, you feed from the back kitchens of canteens, and your kitten hisses at you and claws you and loads the sight of you.

Parks and ponds were your domain parks and ponds. And now there's a trickle of foul brackish water running through it.

Well after that I think it's probably appropriate to have a more serious note. accounts of dreams are rarely of interest to anyone other than the dreamer. We awake sometimes with memories of wonder and amazement and unutterable strangeness from time dream we've just woken from. But if you write it down in cold print, it loses all its luster. And it seems barely more intriguing than than mundane, everyday lives. Particularly when you tell these dreams to other people. I mean, it just gets boring. But last night, I had one of those seemingly endless episodic dreams which flick from one scene to another with remorseless unreason. And one part or only one part of it stayed with me after I woke. And despite what I've just said, I think it might be of interest to hooting yard listeners. This is what I this is part part, only part of a much longer dream. I was giving a talk and a huge auditorium to an audience of youngsters. They were gathered at one end of the hall, and I was in the middle. And immediately behind me, there was a sort of hardboard screen, beyond which was the workshop where my two assistants were located. One of these assistants was the light actor Roy Kinnear. He was sat at a table on which was a record turntable, and he kept playing snatches of an LP of classical music, piano and cello, I think. I wished for silence while addressing the use. And I kept ducking back behind the screen, asking Roy Kinnear to stop playing the record. But every time I return to my lectern, the music started up again. Eventually, I grabbed a wooden chair leg and ran at Roy Kinnear brandishing above my head and threatening to bash his head in if he didn't stop. That's it that then the dream went off at some tangent and I forget what happened next. The strange thing is I haven't thought about Roy Kinnear for years have it it's not as if I've recently seen him in anything. Sadly, of course, he died in 1988 on horseback while filming in Spain. So I'd like to offer him a posthumous apology, and assure his ghost that he can play snatches of cello and piano music for all eternity, without the threat of me clubbing him with a cheer leg.

Finally, I know I've been promising promising you more excerpts from further science book 20 by by Norman Davis. Instead, I just thought I'd mentioned that Dobson once wrote a pamphlet entitled, Netherlands Holland, Dutch. What's that about? The opening lines provide a summary of its subject matter. We call China China and its people Chinese. We call Finland Finland. And its people Finns, we call Germany Germany and its people Germans. I could go on but I won't. What I want to know is why do we have two interchangeable The Netherlands and Holland for the country whose inhabitants we call Dutch. Why don't we say Netherlands or hollanders? What's all that about? Anyway, the point about Dobson's pamphlet is it's a great book because for 40 pages, he tries desperately to conceal the fact that he's done no research whatsoever. Nor have I. So I don't know the answer to the question. Perhaps a listener can enlighten me. That's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. Next week will be a repeat show, and I'll be back in two weeks. Bye bye
