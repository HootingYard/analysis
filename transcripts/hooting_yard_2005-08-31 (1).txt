Greetings listeners, this is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frankie. And I'd like to begin this week as I never do with a quotation from the Bible. This is from the book of Proverbs, chapter 13, verse 20, he that walketh with wise men shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. Seems a bit harsh. Over the next half hour, you can work out whether you're walking with wise men, or you're going to be destroyed. Anyway, I'd like to begin with this piece, which is All right, we've had a slight problem all of a sudden. So hold on a second, we just have some.

From that we can probably gather that you are currently a companion of a fool rather than walking with wise men. Anyway, sorry about that. pansy cradle Jew has recently become enamored of the computer game bozen cat, which she'll play for hours at a time seemingly removed criminal earthly plane. I don't share her enthusiasm for this so called game of skill, tactics, problem solving and strategy. I tend not to play computer games. But pansy assures me that she's but one among a legion of devotees. She also says that as an expert player, she wants to reach out to those less adept than herself. And so she's asked me to read out a few little hints and tips. These shouldn't be considered as cheat she says, but as advisory notes for those bows and contesters, as we dug ourselves, who've not yet reached the exalted level in which I bask So here is an edited version of the dozens of dozens upon dozens of pages of scribbled jottings that she sent in.

This is called the smashed god poopsie Clutterbuck is not a suitable name for a god. For that reason it became a terrible blasphemy ever to speak the name of the God of God allowed. Those who disobeyed the law were banished from God forever. They were put into airtight pods, and the pods were stuffed into the side cars of gleaming motorcycles, and thence ferried far far away, though few knew where they were taken. Only that weeks or months later, the motorcycle would return to Gar, dead of night, and then now empty pod removed from the sidecar and taken to a secret place where the pods was steamed, clean and fumigated. I'm one of the few who know where the blast femurs were banished to. For I was one of the motorcyclists. Oh my, I can hardly believe how long ago it was. I'm decrepit, now decrepit and wizard, and I don't think I've kickstarted a motorcycle for 40 or 50 years. I loved that job. In those days, we had many gods in Gar, but only one was authentic, the one whose name could not be uttered. In addition, we had 15 green eyed weasel gods, a pair of plastic Marchmont gods, the hideous centipede god of Tuesday, evenings, Bosh, the crumpled God at squirrel gods, numberless Gods with two or more heads, even one God with no head at all, and a God whose breath ignited stars. We had the bucket garden, the athletics track God, the God of railway platforms and the God of puddles. Some gods were ephemeral, tiny things like your mayflies. Others were massive and solid and permanent. But only one God was real. The God with the uppercase G, the one whose name could not be spoken. Nowadays, those of us who rode the motorcycles in the side cars of which blasphemers languished muffled in pods are thought of as fanatics. I still get sidelong looks of contempt or loathing when I go to the post office or the green grocery. I was spat out in the street as recently as six months ago. When I buy my fireworks, they're never invariably tampered with so that they spatter rather than sparkle. I can't remember the last time one of my fireworks went wash. My favorite God was the gas God. It made a tremendous growling noise and it was usually 60 feet high, but sometimes smaller. Every now and then, because I was a motorcyclist. It would carry out its godlike doings in my back garden, and I would walk from the window entranced. Our windows then were made of cellophane, and I would prick holes in my window with the point of a sharpened pencil, the better to appreciate the misty wafts of the gas God. I was a believer, yes, but never a zealot. I got my job as a motorcyclist because my mother had been one because I was afraid of the weather. And because I prayed that it would be so some of my prayers involve animal sacrifice, the evisceration of poultry on a stone altar for example. But more often than not, I would be found squatting in an alleyway singing snatches of Nimrod, with not a head in sight, dead or alive. I've always wondered which of my prayers were answered, for answered they were on that joyous day when I was bundled out of bed and taken to motorcycle training school. I do recall sprawling in the muck in front of a statue of the beetle browed god of the railway sidings and the pewter chicken as a way of saying thank you, but I was young then. I'm all bent out of shape. Now. A breakfast bowl of tomato soup is scant solace when all the gods have gone away. And to think that every

God jack of them disappeared over the course of a single weekend. As dawn broke on Saturday, the very air of God was teeming with them. Slusher the back God the God of toffee apples Little postage stamp sized pneumatic gods, the cling film sausage God, a whole slew of Gods decked out in to Gould, wind treaters and funny little pointed hats, all those magnificent diocese, all devoted to God, and in turn, worshiped by all the good people of God. By Sunday night they were all gone. The uppercase g god of God, whose name can never be spoken was the last to go. It was smashed to pieces at midnight in the town square by some kind of elemental destructive Cataclysm. No human agency could have wrought such ruin. I sipped my cold tomato soup and mourn my Gods still. And now, only I know to what crumbling seaside town we took the blast femurs, and I will never tell a soul.

anecdote about Dobson it would be no exaggeration to say that Dobson was besotted with cinema. He was always a great film goer and on occasion his enthusiasm led him into typically preposterous escapades. There was a period when he became infatuated with Hollywood films about low life gangster determined CD urban hustling. One day he announced a marigold true that he was going to run a numbers racket. What are you talking about? asked marigold. Dobson explain that in many of the films have been watching characters were often employed as runners for the numbers racket, and that he found such a trade diverting, it will make a change from writing pamphlets he said. Having studied his sources carefully, Dobson worked out that running the numbers involved roaming the streets cracking down his clients and taking money from them. But first, he reasoned, they needed their numbers aside of the racket that was probably not shown in the films because it lacked drama. He approached his new career methodically first drawing up a list of people to whom he could give numbers. Deciding to limit himself to a dozen clients. He included his next door neighbors on both sides. The post office person, a crestfallen chap who walked his dog along the street every day, the bell foundry janitor, Mrs. Pardon the five orphans she taught in her ramshackle Sunday school, and because he could think of nobody else, marigold to this much accomplished, Dobson realized that he did not know which numbers he ought to give them. He spent a few weeks catching up on appropriate films, but learn nothing new. So he buried his head in ancient numerological and astrological texts, much as he suspected characters like two hats Magilligan did off screen before entering the numbers racket. Having chosen 12 numbers, Dobson wrote each one down on scraps of paper and spent an overcast afternoon distributing them to his clients. Only marigold asked him what he thought he was doing. To which he replied, I'm running a numbers racket. That's your number. Keep it safe. Dobson's excitement mounted as the week went past to calm himself down. He spent much of the time at a pigsty observing pigs doing what pigs do. Then, after seven days had elapsed, he went roaming around to collect his money. Life imitated art However, each of his 12 clients whined and wheedled and pleaded for more time to pay complaining of a lack of funds and promising that they would settle as soon as they could. Dobson found the whimpering of Mrs. pods, orphans particularly exasperating. So much so that within hours he decided to go back to pamphlet writing. About two years later, marigold true asked him about his numbers racket, but by then, Dobson cinematic enthusiasm was fulfilled about the earth being invaded by hostile extraterrestrial beings with suckers and tentacles. And he was busy writing an essay explaining why they always landed their spaceships, their major American cities, rather than say, by English seaside resorts or campsites.

And I shall walk along the pathways adjacent to Yoko Ono Boulevard all the days of my life. And as I pass the Hydros that line those pathways low, I will see many birds, the sorts of birds which make their nests in hedgerows, which I know not. And there will be the counting of the birds. Now here how lies the land, there is the path or the pathways, and then there are the hedgerows, and then there is the boulevard so that we might say the Hydros divide the pathways from the boulevard and in this division are the nesting birds, and they will be counted. If I have a hope it is that starlings are the sorts of birds that make their nests in hedgerows for it is to the counting of starlings that I am drawn. I shall not shirk from counting all the birds, but that is my hope. In the days now past I counted bees. The bees to be counted were beyond the boulevard many leagues distant out on the sand dunes, where their hives had been put. It came to pass that the clouds grew black and thunder cracked, and one by one the hives were struck by lightning, and no BS remained to be counted. For 20 days and 20 nights, I walked across the plains and the deserts away from the sand dunes until I came to Yoko Ono Boulevard. And I waited at the side of that great thoroughfare. I waited 20 more days and 20 more nights, but I could not pass. All along the boulevard was a ceaseless flow of cars and vans and pan technical vans and trucks and Shera banks, and I waited. And lo I heard the blast of a Trump and an angel appeared before me. Are you He who counted the bees of the kingdom? It asked. And I replied with full heart. And then the angel led me down towards a dark subterranean tunnel beneath the boulevard and led me through it. And I came up into the light on the other side. And I saw that I was upon a pathway and that yonder were hedgerows and that beyond the Hydros was the boulevard still roaring with cars and vans and pan technicans and trucks and Shera banks. And the angel spoke again. Here is the hedgerow that divides the pathway from the boulevard it said waxing likened to James Mason. And within this division, you will find many birds are nesting. And where once you counted the bees, you will henceforth be the count of the birds. And then the angel was gone and I took up my tally stick. And then you might Inquisitor, you with the green and golden hat stopped me on the pathway and asked me Do you know the way to the blister lane bypass? And I replied that I knew it's not. And then it happened that I clutched at the sleeve of your Raymond and I told you that I shall walk along the pathways adjacent to Yoko Ono Boulevard all the days of my life.

When I zoomed all the books from the barre library under the big field of cement. One of the volumes they found was the first edition of murder in the murk by chlorine Winslow, you probably know Winslow as the author of fangs. In the midst her most famous work, the one that won prizes, the one that sold 1000s of paperbacks, the one that was turned into an opera booth by booth. Booth himself is an intriguing character, but I don't want to get sidetracked. Perhaps I'll tell you about him another time. About his many operas, opera booths and Opera buffers, soap operas and light opera. It's about his pet Curlew desert Mondo once savage but domesticated by boof according to his own bird taming plan, based on Edward de Bono's revolutionary six hats system. About his love of both chocolates was rolling lemon meringue pie about the booth gates scandal. About the time booth visited a gigantic dam in a distant land, a dam that didn't work and how he never went back. Even though the dam managers implored him to about Desmond those birdseed preferences about six hats of different colors, and about booths musical adaptation of fangs in the mist by chlorine, Winslow. All that can wait because I want to tell you about murder in the Merck murder in the Merck is, as its title indicates a murder mystery. It features Winslow's, so called invisible detective, invariably known only as the invisible detective. Some critics of poo pooed Winslow's prose, particularly her dialogue, for passages such as this there are things that creep up on the face of the earth Dale Winton that it is best you God. heavens above the invisible detective screams Dale Winton the invisible detectives ruddy plump, ever reliable Asst. What is the matter? Fear not Dale Winton. I was merely saying, Yeah, to keep you on your toes, said the Invisible detective. Dale Winton mopped his brow with a large red, yellow green blue and black embroidered cotton neckerchief from Peru. For all her Latin prose, however, chlorine Winslow was a supreme divisor of plots in murder in the Merc a clerk armed with a Dirk lurking in the murk goes berserk, murdering many. Winslow gives each of the victims a quirk for example. The first to be slain has a tattoo of several cormorants on his torso. The second is a smarmy brilliant team to get who bathes in as his milk and toasts his crumpets over the fire. Using a replica of the magic five pronged fork of time Tara been part of the cutlery treasures in the museum at or near Act. The third victim is a poultry cow poke poultry man as we follow in the invisible footsteps of the invisible detective and the visible footsteps of the invisible detectives assistant Dale Winton. The twists and turns and thrills pile up page after page just like in a well thumbed library book you may remember reading when you were young and feckless and callow. Last, like Dobson's pamphlets, murder in the Merc is out of print.

This is a place to end the show called destinies darning needle pierced my very soul. Last Thursday at 1048 in the morning, my very soul was pierced by the darning needle of destiny. It was raining one of those summer showers and I was walking along near the canal thinking about trebizond Oh Culpepper, a recent enthusiasm of mine. If you do not know of Culpepper, it would be well worth you finding out. But right now I have no time to tell you why I had become so keen, some might say obsessive. There are other forms of trebizond. Oh, and indeed other culpepper's that much I know. You may recall that little Evo one sang about doing the locomotion. I was not doing it myself that morning. I was just walking or plodding. But at 1043 just ahead of me on the canal side, a large number of ghouls disembark from a yellow bus and they began to do the locomotion. They had to choose Somewhere getting from their bus to the barge they were due to board. Being ghouls. I thought they may just flit or shimmer. But no, they did the locomotion, and they did it slowly. In order to continue on my way, I would have to pass among the goals, and this caused me to pause. I've never been remotely frightened of Phantom forms, be they ghosts or ghouls are mere blobs of ectoplasm. dangling from a ribbon around my neck is a tungsten prong. tungsten is also called Wolfram, the only metallic element named after two quadruped Ed mammals, so you can see why I was safe from goals. The reason I paused was because I was concentrating so hard on trebizond Oh Cole pepper, and I could not help wonder I could not help wondering what the correct approach would be of a trebizond Oh, Cole pepper devotee to a busload of ghouls. I was not yet an adept, but I planned to be and I saw this as a test. It was now 1044 all the goals have now left the bus and they were doing the locomotion very slowly as they cross towards the canal where their Barger waited them. The bus was driven away by its top pattern driver. Its grounding engine alarmed some crows in a tree, and their wings made a loud flapping noise as they flew away. I had no wings to flap of course, but wouldn't adaptive trebizond Oh Cal pepper flaps something goals. I did not know the answer to this question. But I noticed that there was a pneumatic postal chute box on the ground only a few feet away. hastily I scribbled a note to my mentor and inserted it into the slit at top of the box. You will think me presumptuous perhaps to expect a reply from my mentor so rapidly, I think I had been spoiled. The mentor who had been assigned to me after that meeting in the Civic Center assured me that my questions and concerns would be answered by return of pneumatic post shoot that is almost instantaneously and for a month now, that had indeed been the case. So I stood like a ninny, shifting from foot to foot, fiddling with my tungsten prong. As the rain fell, and the ghouls locomotive with agonizing slowness across my path. I was not to know that my trebizond Oh, Culpepper, mentor, mentor lay sprawled on a mat in a distant time zone, his brain laid waste by the fumes from a jar of some expensive blissful gas. He had not seen fit to tell me of his holiday plans. I waited by the box for three minutes. The leaving goals have now boarded the barge, but there were so many of them that they still blocked the towpath, and some seem not to have moved at all from where the yellow bus had dropped them off. I knew somehow that I was not going to get the advice I sought from my mentor. I turned my back on the pneumatic postal chute box, disappointed and angry. And so I passed the final 60 seconds of my old life. It's all very clear to me. The rain was falling from puffy black clouds. There was not a patch of blue to be seen in the sky. The padlock on the box was rusty, and the yellow paint on the box itself was flaking.

Over in a field a cow stood staring blankly at a squirrel. gust of wind disturbed my hairstyle. But I'd left my coma at home on the mantelpiece. Jam sandwiches and paper cups of tiser were being distributed to the poor from a kiosk by the bridge. There was a bedraggled duck in a pond and a coat hanger in a puddle. The crows had flapped back to the tree, and they were perched coining the tenets of trebizond. Oh Cal pepper burned in my brain. I could hear the distant hum of milk floats and the whirring of bicycle wheels. The pathway was becoming ever muddy as the rain poured down, and a couple of earthworms slivered to the surface to wriggle blindly in the muck. I thought I saw the yellow bus again in the distance going in the direction of the abandoned vinegar brewery. I ran my tongue over my teeth and dislodged a fragment of sausage. And then I took a deep intake of breath and ran. I ran towards the slowly locomoting ribbon of ghouls strung across my path. I puffed out my chest and I world my arms and I thought of trebizond Oh Culpepper and at 1048. On that Thursday morning, I passed through the goals and the darling need live destiny pierced my very soul. It is a week later now Thursday again, and I'm sitting in a chalet on a wind wrecked beach staring out too. See, I'm holding my soul nestled on my lap and it is a glow pulsating with the glory of trebizond Oh Cole pepper and I am staring out to see
