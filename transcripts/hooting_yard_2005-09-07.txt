I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still. Do ron ron horse be gone? She cried. It was an incantation in a field. And sure enough, the horse to whom she addressed these words turned and cantered away until it could no longer be seen in the midst of the drizzle. Somebody told me that her name was Jill. But before I could ask her she was casting her spells again. Hootie hoo Dee woo cow be gone. She yelled at a cow. But this time without the desired effect. The cow just stared back at her chewing its cud. The way cows do. Hootie hoo Dee woo cow be gone. She repeated a little desperately, I thought. If I'd been the cow, I would have sensed a moment of panic of confidence drained drill. If Jill was her name, repeated her incantation too soon. The cow did not move. So I took the opportunity to stride purposefully across the field in my creaking black boots until I was face to face with her. Somebody told me that your name is Jill, I said. essaying a bow as if I was some sort of Regency fopp My name is not Jill she hissed. I am the Whoo hoo hoo Dee woo da doo ron ron woman fopp be gone. And I found myself propelled by some eldritch force into a weird nether world where I languish To this day, my only companion the horse, there is no sign of the cow.

Good afternoon. This is hooting out on the air. And I'm Frankie. And that last thing wasn't really true. I'm not languishing in another world because if I was, I wouldn't be here. I'm going to read some stories to you for the next half an hour. This one is called tattiness, capisco and his ears of wheat and I'm just going to clear my throat. In certain parts of the world, people still sit around their fires at dusk and tell each other stories. In the wretched village where marigold Chu grew up, there was one tale in particular that was told over and over again. This was the story of taggiasca Pisco and his his of wheat. It was told so often, sometimes three or four times in a single evening that it was embedded in marigold brain, and years later, she could recount it word for word, barely pausing for breath. Dobson always knew when she was about to launch into the yarn, because she sucked in her cheeks, and puckered her lips, in what he thought of as that capisco way. Curiously, the tale of tadi is capisco and his his of wheat was never written down. But if marigold chews memory is accurate, there was a record of sorts. She remembered as an infant, seeing pictorial representations of the main points of the story, ritually painted in crimson, surly, and blue and all pigment. Later in life. She tried to describe them. I recall she wrote that the first picture was of Teddy as capisco, half hidden behind a cow. It was decisively a French cow in Vash. I remember thinking how significant this was, even as a tiny tot. The second picture was the shape of a medallion. The painter overdid the ornament. But what I loved about this one was that it showed the exact moment of a hen's cluck. tadesse capisco is absent. I think we were meant to infer that he had already gone off to war. Certainly that's the input of the third picture, in which the capisco parents are shown filling rusty farmyard pails with their tears. I could almost taste the salt of this sobbing as they waited for the wheat. Picture for was missing. It had been torn out, you could still see the ghost shade of its adhesive. Some brutal vandal had scribbled over the fifth picture with an indelible black marker pen, and the six had been chewed by squirrels. So it was always a joy to look at the seventh in which we see taggiasca Pisco with his ears. Have wheat at last returned from the trenches minus one eye leaning against the shed in which all the rusty farmyard pails full of his parents tears are kept. He is smoking a tree root and looks the spitting image of Joseph Starling, though his hair has been painted in civilian blue with flecks of ornament, which may be accidental. The eighth picture is like a child's drawing. It shows the helicopters on the helipad for burning cities and the pit of doom, making the next picture all more alluring. The delightful wash of colors showing Meadows dotted with teasel spurge gente, Ian's camelias, Columbine bedstraw and Edelweiss honeysuckle lupins and flocks and hollyhocks, hollyhocks. Ooh mama Papa, I used to pipe as I turned to picture number 10 where a tattiness capisco is of wheat. And my parents would always smile conspiratorially, and place their fingers over their mouths. And I adored the anticipation of seeing the 11th and last picture, or crimson and surly and blue and opulent kings yellow, the frying pan and the hunchback. The countless pigs wallowing in their muck, the detective with his buttons and the unsheltered peas still smuggling their pods, the glockenspiel and the fire extinguisher, the tiny glittering ships of float on the soaking wet sea. And there if you looked ever so closely on the poop deck of the tiniest trip of all, triumphant in his galoshes with his ears of wheat, Tadeusz, capisco, brave and strong

that was about marigold crew written by marigold true and now suddenly something about Dobson himself. Some time ago I mentioned that Dobson compiled a Gazetteer of the land of nod, the place to where Cain was banished after he slew his brother, Abel Dobson, of course, never traveled to the Holy Land, nor indeed to nod. What he did, however, was to rent a field and build a scale model using firewood, netting, straw, plastic packaging, paint, plasticine, and corrugated cardboard among other things. careful analysis of the Bible and other historical records met the Dobson's model nod is probably as close as we could get to appreciating the blasted land in which the first murderer lived out his miserable days. Here is a charming old goat shade. Here is a clump of cypress trees shriveled by grout. Here is a Erich von daniken esque landing strip for an extra terrestrial spaceship. Here are tears and bushels ASPs and Vipers and a river of burning pitch. Dobson built not before writing has gathered here, which runs to eight closely typed pages, illustrated with cack handed pencil drawings. The text has been ridiculed by biblical scholars have accused Dobson of Paul trenary Andrew haste, credulousness and stupidity. Such criticisms were swatted aside by the out of print pamphleteer, like so many flies, majors, ticks, or similar tiny flying pests. well represented Incidentally, in the model land of nod, where Dobson had hit upon the idea of using chocolate flavored one hundreds and 1000s scattered hither and thither around the rented field to show swarms of buzzing and tagging insect life. For larger forms, such as locusts, he used cashew nuts, delicately carved by volunteers from the Pang Hill orphanage, some of whom lost their eyesight carrying out such painstaking miniature work for days on end in the dank and gloomy basement of the building. Dobson believe that receipts from visitors fees to his model land of nod would provide him with an income in his declining years. It was not to be on a damp and overcast Tuesday in 1964, the field was laid waste by an inexplicable Cataclysm the day before marigold Chu was due to focus To grow it using a borrowed camera. The land of nod was swept away, swept away and gone.

This is called when haddow haddow becomes Musto or the Greaves of wayo. Pack the pouch in which you keep your watch and listen while I tell you about the times when haddow haddow becomes Musto pouch pattered. all well and good and the time on your watch taking and talking. Attend to the tox My mother always said, but my father was rather a tech man. He was a poster boy for the Greaves of wayo big grinning fangs and a lopsided hat and no pal of haddow haddow. Every Thursday, he brought home an eel already dead, and he chopped it up on the sideboard with his mighty hatchet. And then he fed it to the cat. I was trained in botany because I became Musto. I was alert to both the ticks and the tox given my upbringing, I had a lot of lanterns. Remember, this was fennel and black and wet? No haddow haddow. Here. They used to give me a new borrow on my birthday, but I always lost them soon enough. The Greaves of wayo were big on biros, then I remember, especially in the fens, I had by Musto, my hate Penny salt tokens. In those days, my management skills were second to none. It was all like clockwork to me, but one thing I'm not going to talk about is the presence of toads and my presentments they're off. So Mark, well, the eel, the cat, the biros, the fens, that tick and Tock and your pattied pouch, and you can bet your own hatefully token on haddow haddow. Becoming Musto. All aboard the Greaves of wayo sigh. Now and that piece when that piece appeared on the hooting yard website, and also a few words about the website in a moment. I've got a letter from a reader called Tim thurn. Who wrote them Mr. Key, I enjoyed reading hooting yard and usually find it both instructive and enlightening. However, I must say that the piece entitled when haddow haddow becomes Musto left me somewhat jolt brained, it's unlikely that you'd write complete nonsense. So perhaps I'm missing something. Could I prevail upon you to provide some sort of glossary to help in my appreciation and understanding yours perplexed Tim thurn. Well, for you, Tim, anything. So here's a glossary of some of the crucial words and passages in that piece. The times when haddow haddow becomes Musto. This is usually between four o'clock and 4:30pm on Wednesday afternoons, particularly when it's raining or is about to rain. The tox This is suggestive of both toxin to XIN a poisonous substance generated in an animal body. Animals may include cows, crows, cormorants, squirrels and ducks, among many others, and toxin TOC s i n, and alarm bell. Dobson once began some notes on the topics of a toxin toxin, but discarded them and wisely so the Greaves of wayo this is completely impenetrable, and eel. The generation of eels has long been a mystery. Aristotle believed that they quote grew from the guts of wet soil, unquote, that they emerged unfertilized from mud. We now know that all eels are spawned in the Sargasso Sea, but no one has ever seen it happen. The cat now the definite article, not a cat but the cat signaling that a particular cat is being referred to teasingly we're not given the name of the cat. Popular cat names include heddles marmalade napolean boot polish and gravitas, so it may be one of them. Finland, not Finland but Finland. Are there any friends in Finland? I don't know, but I'll find out. A new borrow. A borrow is a writing implement named after Laszlo Joseph borrow 1899 to 1985, a Hungarian journalist.

the bio brothers moved to that country in 1943. And I'm not sure if it's pronounced by arrow or Bureau. Hi, please solve tokens. These work paper or cardboard tokens worth one half penny in pre decimal currency, worthless at today's prices, and though only 34 years dead, seemingly as historically distant as the Grote which could be exchanged for salt. How many grains or fistfuls of salt you got V or hatefully was subject to fluctuation. Some believe that the token to salt ratio moved in spooky parallel with planetary conjunctions. And at least one heightening salt token astrolabe is known to have been constructed, though, by whom, when, where, and why is not known, nor will it ever be known, yay, until the umpteenth generation toads, probably natterjack or golden, ah, all golden and poisonous.

I thought I'd mentioned something about the hooting od website. The for those of you who don't know the address is HTTP, colon forward slash forward slash hooting.yard.users.bt. Open world.com. And this week, and the this week the site had its 10,000th hit 10,000 visit which was very exciting. From from at least 28 different countries, apparently, including one unknown country. So I'm not sure what that is that from another world. And anyway, most, if not all of the things that I read on the on the show can be you can read them on the website, including this news item from a couple of weeks ago. Which is part of our well this is entitled nomenclature of diminutive persons who plunge down 150 foot cliffs and survive with hardly a scratch. This is an entirely true new story. The most recent addition to our list which attempts to complete nomenclature of diminutive persons who survive after toppling over the edge of cliffs is Demi Leigh Tweddle. The wonderfully named Ms. Tweddle meets the diminutive criteria diminutive pneus criterion in that she's a six year old child last week and that's probably now two or three weeks ago. She tumbled 150 feet down the cliffs at chimney hole near finally in North Yorkshire while playing rolie polie. When we reached the bottom, she simply picked herself up and walked around to find her parents. Demi Leigh Tweddle should not be confused with dairy Lee twaddle, which is a generic term for the advertising guff spouted by the makers of foil wrapped processed trees, triangles and similar produce. And rumors that I'm going to change my name to Demi Frank k are inaccurate and can be discounted

From twiddles to parallelograms hands up those of you who remember the cartoon character Billy parallelogram for decades in the last century, he appeared weekly in the pabulum, a comic which also featured magnet boy, the boy magnet. Whereas all magnet boy, the boy magnets adventures follow the strict and changing formula. You could never guess what might happen in a billy parallelograms script. Sometimes he was accompanied by his cousin Tilly dodecahedron, or by the mass towards of gruesome and frightening things from the pit of foulness. Sometimes the weekly adventure might be as simplistic as Billy parallelogram buying an accordion and learning how to play it. There were serial stories to spread over two or three months, where Billy parallelogram would be shown teaching children how to cultivate wheat, or to devise spring prong and lever mechanisms to automate household tasks, or even to compose majestic symphonies for full orchestra so emotionally charged that listeners would blob into their handkerchiefs. His cousin, Tilly dodecahedron his appearances, often signaled storylines involving bees, turpentine silhouettes, lists, farm implements and dakka dakka dakka. This last was a speciality of the Billy parallelograms scripts, an ill defined yet curiously unnerving monster Goblin, with bulging eyes and forehead seemingly bent on destroying the universe, but always distracted by parlor games, such as snakes and ladders or gluttons and rhubarb. My favorite Billy parallelogram story was the one in which he single handedly thwarts the evil designs of a mad scientist called Wiens. Weems is blond and has a really sparkling blue eyes, and is always dressed in a trench coat. There is an inference never made explicit that he is some kind of Nazi also never made explicit is precisely what his evil scheme is. Other than that it involves the enslavement of the world's entire population. how he's meant to accomplish this from the cockpit of an antiquated sea plane is unclear. But before we have time to consider such questions, Billy parallelogram heroically tampers with the fuel gauge, leading Weems to think he is out of petrol. The plane crashes into a mountainside, killing Weems and his fiendish crew. But not before Billy parallelogram bails out and lands in the courtyard of a pie shop, where he is hailed as a savior, and given free pies for the rest of his life.

This week's coating yard metal of the week is 10. many words rhyme with tin such as Ben Dean, sin, gin, Rumpelstiltskin, and pin. For this reason, it's quite easy to make up versus about 10. Harder though, to ensure that those verses have something arresting urgent and original to say, especially about 10 if it's the main subject of the poem. Let's imagine that you've been commissioned by a maker of Calico prints to sing the praises of tin chloride as a reducing agent. And as a mordant. I doubt very much that you'd be able to dash off a suitable poem just by listing the words that rhyme with 10. But perhaps you're more accomplished as a poet than I am.

In his pamphlet, astrochemistry a study of metal planet affinities, emergence press 1984, Nick colostrum writes 10 is the one message The seven which does not show much evidence of its planets signature. I asked an astrologer about this and he replied, Why, how could it the Jupiter attributes expansion joviality wisdom? How could a metal express these are indeed, it seems that with tin, we have to be content with only a very partial expression of the planet traditionally associated with it. Mr. colostrum does not explain our big lump of rock, metallic hydrogen, liquid hydrogen and gaseous hydrogen orbiting the Sun millions of miles away, expresses expansion joviality and wisdom, but I'm sure he knows what he's talking about, because he makes a point of stressing more than once that he is an MA cantab and thus, no ordinary mortal. Dobson was no ordinary mortal either for different reasons. as one might expect here, he turned his attentions to 10 on a number of occasions, chiefly in the pamphlet he called simply tin book. he set himself the task of mentioning 10, once on the first page, twice on the second page, and so on, until the final page included 44 mentions of the silvery, malleable poor metal that is not easily oxidized in air, and resists corrosion. But this leads to somewhat idiotic passages like this one from page 10. I stood on the mountainside in the rain, there was a crow perched on my head, and its talons clawed at my scalp. But I had swallowed an anti crow clawing pain pill an hour earlier. I peered into the rain Southern gloom until I could make out the weather vane in the far distance. conditions were perfect for the shouting the names of metals at the sky experiment. Tin, I yelled 10 1010 1010 1010 dobsonian scholars have got themselves into something of a tos arguing whether the out of print pamphleteer is describing actual events in tin book or just making them up. My own view is that it hardly matters. To end this fascinating look at our metal of the week, try to lodge the following fact in your cranium. at low temperatures 10 exists as gray or alpha tin, which has a cubic crystal structure similar to silicon. When warmed above 13.2 degrees centigrade, it changes into white or beater tin, which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure. Alpha 10 or not be confused with the alpha course created by the Reverend Nicky Gumbel, which prepares a reductive and distorted version of Christianity, known with alpha males. Dobson, by the way, once described himself as an epsilon male, but quite what he meant by that is far from clear.

Finally, this week, dietary news many years ago, I decided to experiment by living on a subsistence diet of gruul for a while, and I hope readers understand that this is a perfectly true story. I think I was pandering to my aesthetic puritanical streak for the duration of the exercise I extrude all other foodstuffs, even to the point where I was tempted neither by pap nor by slops around the same time I read somewhere that krill was the food of the future. This appealed to me hugely, but gruul seemed to be easier to come by than krill. This is by way of introduction to my recent discovery of another alleged food of the future in the form of toy, a fairly exciting dish from Hawaii. puoi is made from the taro plant which is apparently the 14th most cultivated crop on Earth. The root or calm of the taro is cooked by hours and hours and then pounded into a sticky goo that has the consistency of library paste, which makes it especially appealing to those of us who are bookish on the other great things about pointers that you can dispense with cutlery as it shoveled daintily into the mouth using your bare hands. So if you're on the lookout for a sour paste to serve as your staple diet ploy seems to be the thing. And maybe after eating a delicious bowl of it, you could you may wish to engage in fire dancing, fire twirling and fire spinning for all of which you can use fire boy. And that's all for me this week. I do hope you've enjoyed the show, and I'll be back next week. Bye bye.
