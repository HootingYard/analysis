This is resonance 104 point four FM and this is a special edition of hooting yard on the air Special Edition in two senses. One is because it's a kind of Snuffly cold, coughing, generally sick kind of episode. So if my voice sounds a bit strange and I sound as if I can't breathe. That's because that's how it is. And the other thing is that I have a special guest on this week's show. Max desharnais wit raconter and a man who knows beekeeping like the back of his hand, Max will be with us in a while but first I'd like to read you a thrilling yom I was invited to saw the sheds, so I wore a pair of gloves. Have you got that so far? sheds gloves. The snow was thick so we were preceded by a snow plow the engine of which ran on fuel have a certain amount of uncertain origin, sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, make a note when I say that the origin or provenance of the fuel was uncertain. I mean that I did not know of it. Not that it was unclear to those people who know their snowplows and other vehicles. Of course, they knew where their fuel came from. I didn't need to know. sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snow plows, other vehicles. Are you beginning to see where this leads. As soon as we got inside the first shed on the tour, I removed my gloves and put them on a shelf above a gas heater. How they managed to pipe gas out here with something else I didn't know. We were meant to have a picnic in this first shed but no one had remembered to bring the hamper. sheds gloves snow fuel snowplows, other vehicles, shelf gas picnic hamper. bursting within human carriage I volunteered to return to the bitty house alone to fetch the hamper. Various half hearted attempts were made to dissuade me, but I waved them aside with my now ungloved hands. It has to be said that my waves were theatrical, even melodramatic, but I enjoyed the sensation. I could feel my blood pumping through my veins. sheds, gloves snow, fuel, snow plows, other vehicles, shelf gas, picnic, hamper, bitty house waves blood. Stop me when you've cottoned on. I left my gloves on the shelf above the gas heater and went out into the snow. Without a compass. I strode off in what proved to be completely the wrong direction. Instead of reaching the bitty house where I would find the hamper and heave it onto my shoulder and take it back to shed number one for the picnic. I found myself lost and not only lost, but encircled by wolves. The wolves each had a dusting of fresh snow on their backs. I took this to mean that they had been standing around for a while waiting for me. sheds, gloves snow fuel, snowplows, other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic hamper, bitty house waves, blood campus wolves. I counted 17 snow covered wolves, they remained perfectly still looking at me. nursery rhymes are a godsend in such circumstances. At least that's been my experience. So I began with Ring a Ring of roses and then did little jack Horner, not a single wolf moved a muscle. It then dawned on me that they were all blind, blind wolves in the snow and me lost and without my gloves and it Learn to fuel sources and further than ever from the picnic hamper. What a predicament or was it? You be the judge? Now listen just once more. sheds, gloves, snow fuel, snowplows, other vehicles, shelf gas, picnic, hamper, bitty house waves, blood, campus, wolves, roses, muscles, dorm blind.

Frank Key  05:37
All should now be clear, as clear as the sky was on that cold bright morning in September 40 miles north of Helsinki, the capital city of Finland, founded as long ago as 1550 as a rival to the Hanseatic city of Tallinn.

Frank Key  06:31
I'm bound to forget this, so I better do it now at this point in the show. Are you a pod person? If you are a pod person looting yard on the air is one of the shows that you can get, you can subscribe for absolutely no fee to podcasts have go to www.resonance.com and click on podcasts or search for hooting yard on the iTunes Music Store. And if you do that, the joys of the hooting yard podcast and come to your very own computer. Meanwhile, this is a piece called Pabst, as tak perhaps does tack, perhaps to sludge. Pastors pastors have him we sing. We sing his praises, it seems to me for want of anything better to do, perhaps to tax it's on his great golden throne belching out light, a blinding light as gorgeous as it is uncanny. And yet it is an impure light that is certain, for with perhaps just tack comes perhaps to sludge. It is the latter who is the source of those scarcely perceptible low booming noises grave and deep and sinister. When perhaps does perhaps does was installed on his throne, there was Carnival and cruising fools danced around maypoles and Justin roster is roasted and dusted. As if tomorrow would never come. No one has ever been able to count the pies that were cooked that day. Many many people drowned at the swimming gala the old crumbling outdoor pool, and ravens were seen hovering in the sky. a post office person stuck pictures of perhaps just tacked to his hat and was chased across the fields by happily screeching children. But was there a trace of desperation in a screeching and tomorrow did come of course as everyone knew it had to that was when the first rumbles were heard of Pabst, US sludge. To appease him. The throne was moved to a higher point on the hill just above the coppice were moles betrayed their presence in their usual mole like way, a gang from the tavern headed further armed with rifles until perhaps perhaps this made it known that moles were sacred and must never be harmed. Some say the men turn their rifles on themselves in terror. Terror It is said is the only proper response to Pabst TAC into perhaps the sludge wrapped up tight in their cardigans, hanging Tilley lamps from the rafters of their cabins. The braver villages plot his overthrow. turnips a chewed cigarillos dangle from the blackened lips of the Vanguard. Secret anthems never written down a mumbled rather than Sung. Food poisoning has wiped out most of these souls since perhaps this perhaps this first emitted his light and his booms 17 years ago. The Throne has been moved again moved and reinforced Now it is perched on a sort of concrete veranda by the edge of a lake in which only puffy and bloated fish may swim. larval creatures are strewn on the shore watched over by one of pastors tax lieutenants. The air is thick, clotted far too hot for this region. With each faint boom from perhaps to sludge, the shoreline creatures Twitch, it is never dark here, thanks to perhaps this tack. Between the lake and the coppice lies the village, a deranged tangle of overhead wiring stretches beyond the horizon supported on high wooden poles which sway and Creek in the constant wind. Nowadays, children are no longer taught to sing. Perhaps this tack, perhaps to sludge, perhaps just perhaps dismayed the wind. Perhaps this made it because we seemed. But they should be taught that it's dangerous to forget.

Frank Key  11:50
very sick man, as you can probably tell from my voice, I'm going to take a rest now. And I'm going to hand you over to Max desharnais, who's going to? Well, I don't know what are you gonna do Max,

Unknown Speaker  12:01
I'm gonna read a little bit from it's an English French dictionary from 1876 that I brought along which I like I like dictionaries that try and tell you what you might need on your travels. And probably one of the best ones ever found was when when I bought a Japanese as a modern Japanese dictionary. And being for the modern traveler published in about 1999. They thought that you would need a section called chatting someone up. So you you get past the bit where they say Hello, and thank you and what's your name? to suddenly they launch into? Yes, you're very good looking. And then they have a phrase which goes, I don't know, katamon arakata Ne, which basically is we must be careful of AIDS, which I think in a in a chat up line is possibly extreme, but they were they were certainly acting in a fine tradition. Because if you read Richard and Cotton's new English and French dialogues from 1876, the situations that they expect that you might run into in in foreign climes are quite, quite amusing. They have a section called of antipathy and aversion. And the first phrase is just, I do not like that man. At which point you think Well, yeah, fair enough. But then they go into, I find is anything but prepossessing. He inspires me, a certain disgust, a sort of aversion. His look is not prepossessing and then you get into there his something repulsive in his address, I cannot surmount my antipathy to him, it is difficult for me to surmount the disgust with which he inspires me. This goes on then for about another two pages, which which the tiresome, Prater is as good as a sleeping draft, when gapes at the sight of him. What an insupportable fellow, should we never get rid of him rid of him? And has he swarmed teasers all day? Then of course, there's the bits where you're supposed to be just politely inquiring on the health of friends and family. And if someone was to say, Oh, yeah, the house, you know, How's everything? Is the wife doing fine? You're supposed to come out with a phrase which goes, yes. My eldest sister had the whooping cough, the youngest had the measles, my eldest brother, the smallpox, and the youngest and miliary fever. Frank, any idea what a military fever might possibly

Frank Key  14:35
it could be a military fever with a tee missing could be. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  14:39
there is actually a very handy list of sicknesses and disease that you might

Frank Key  14:44
I probably have most of them at the moment. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  14:47

Frank Key  15:36
Yes, sir. Yes, foil. Take it as read, please.

Unknown Speaker  15:42
So obviously going to France was a relatively dangerous proposition. In those days, there's there's phrases here that they read like poetry or that if you if you string them together the way they appear on the page. It goes, am I not modest? Is she not pretty? Are we not mortal? Are you not careless? Are they not languishing? Was I not pale? Was he not sullen? Will we not opulent? Were you not peremptory? Were they not proud? Was I not punctual? Was he not punctilious? were we not polite? We're not reasonable? Were they not crotchety?

Unknown Speaker  16:26
Shall I not be useful? Have you ever said Shall I not be useful? mostly about once a day Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  16:33
miseration bad routine? Was he not? Will he not be steady? Shall we not be wise and will you not be quarrelsome.

Frank Key  17:50
I think we're I not peremptory or crutches. He will hear from Max again later in the show but I just like to read this to you. Low. In that year of torrential rainfall and storm clouds I set out from the city carrying with me naught but a few rags. I saw cows grazing. I heard horses winning at the edges of farmyards. I hid behind hedges. My appearance was not one to encourage some cherry tricked farmer's wife to invite me in for a dish of scrambled eggs. for days on end I ate nothing but berries, or scraps of leftover cake from countryside wedding parties abandoned in a panic of the visitations from extraterrestrial beings dressed up in glistening metallic space clothing and armed with laser guns. Everywhere I went I saw evidence of burned out barnyard and terrified geese. After roaming aimlessly for about three months, I came to a city by the sea. I sat on a milestone and gazed at the unfamiliar skyline. Some of the masts of ships docked in the harbor were taller than the buildings. I found a handful of crumbs to the goose that had been accompanying me for the last few days and pattered eternally bobbing head. Let us march into that city and be bold. I announced to the goose pointlessly, for it did not understand the word of human language being a goose. Nevertheless, it followed me as I hoisted my bag of rags onto my back and strode towards the customs post on the edge of the city. The weather was still tempestuous, I cannot count the number of puddles I squelch through nor how many schools set that little goose or jitter the customs post when at last we lumbered up to it was deserted. But for a man of great illness lying sprawled on a pallet whose moans took only moments to irritate me, indeed, the sound of human whining after months of solitude set my teeth on edge to such an extent that I bid the goose stifle him as best it could. The goose sat on the sick man's head while I rifled through the filing cabinets. It was at this precise moment that the press photographer bounded through the door and took snaps of the scene which will be familiar to you. startled by camera flashes, the goose fled. I backed against the wall ragged and I must confess while died. The sick man was transmogrified. Only now did I become aware of his police uniform as he and the photographer exchanged a glance that conveyed some terrible significance. That is why I'm writing to you from a prison cell. Thus far I have fed my interrogators a pack of lies, but I do not know how much longer I can hold out. Please, please my darling try as best you can to smuggle in a package of sellotape soap, bleach, some pins, a map and a bale of plastic sheeting so that I can make good my escape.

Frank Key  21:39
This is probably not the best place to read. When when, when one is a sick man, but I'm going to read it anyway. Anyway. Attaching clamps to the slats with quarter inch Gulliver bolts I smeared the lattice work with a decoction of binding agents and threaded the netting through the 10 clips, allowing me to dislodge the hasp on the paddle in order to provide enough purchase on the metal flanges which were arranged in rotation. Beside the color coded pails, the white one being strapped to a clogged bracket, the red ones spinning on the torque engine, the blue one held in place by rubber frets and the black one timing against the Allen minium knob on the wicked, which had been fastened to the anchorage unit by a system of winches controlled by a clay handle on the bowl against which pellets were fired at pre arranged intervals by the steam gun just below the fourth set of novel nozzles cleverly positioned at such a distance from the first three sets to provide a constant stream of gases to pass over the tarpaulins in which punctures had been made to allow ease of passage for the and iron tubes carrying ball bearings to the spandrel and thus onto the rotating wooden platform upon which the greased hinges chafed against the pulleys sufficiently for the sparks to ignite sulfur bombs inside the Bakelite carriage without endangering the pads, bulbs and trucks on the hooter at the sounding of which the intricately wired snares with snap shot and entrap the oiled plasticine clumps first momentarily holding the recurrent biting movements of the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of Taj into the motor around where Dre had placed Canvas bags, packed with candles. In order to study the persistent rattling of the ticker on the back of the iron sledge underneath the trolley, carrying the double battery powered hammer which serves to agitate the drum, containing the four inch blade detached from the rusted bowl of the compass held in place by the rocket on a monstrous two titanium screw wedged against the plackets of the grips distributor I had earlier customized by locking its gut probes into position with no less than 26 separate multiple gate plugs on each of which a scorched zinc disc swiveled in response to the magnetic properties of the special basin receiving the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling out of the glass globe tethered to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate by chains, which ran parallel to the length of string tied at one end to the pirates Oriole and at the other to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags I had stolen from the same warehouse, which provided the hooks for the plank balanced on easily across the gap between the pinboard and the hot ometer fitted with small beeswax parcels lashed to the crane, from which dangled several springs and coils loaded with lead weights and enameled cubes, the purpose of which became apparent when the gleaming cork was plunged into the canister of boiling duck on water kept at constant temperature by hastily repaired piping fed by siphons and buttress by john prongs, from the surfaces of which had been expunged precisely engraved instructions for the use of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the Derrick next to the pumps. The tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange taffeta swaddling material as a sock to the gate who provided the jars, flakes, and asbestos free winged cranks are required for timing the bleaching operation on the plastic squirting mechanism molded out of discarded beetle caps salvaged from a manufacturer of resins, whose grotesque sponge hood had been incorporated into the workings of the shiny magnesium tripod, a top which looked a uranium pill squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic pan, containing phosphorus hoops, and a glamorous leather trumpet pitch towards the cobalt beaker lit up by the McKenzie beam angled obliquely next to a yellow fasti and canopy covering a massive trellis to which were glued and appended cone veiled by cotton wall wrapped around a toy horse with a propeller caked in Mercury, powering the fulcrum and bails on the fractured tub counter sunk behind the crust of a feather on a store with pins affixed to the leaching grill place to skew the a top the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Incredible as it may seem, I had stitched the flap to the basket with insufficiently strong cord, and it now became dangerously loose.

Frank Key  26:39
That is a long sentence. So I need a wrestler. So here's max.

Unknown Speaker  26:45
finish up with just a little bit from a section entitled to express displeasure and grief, which begins with a less and aa and what pain but then swiftly moves on to grief deprives me of all feeling, I am swallowed up in affliction. And my favorite after so many misfortunes, it only remains for me to die I mean exactly. How many times have you wished you could say that to whoever you happen to be trying to communicate with one of the other bits a section entitled negatively and interrogative Lee which which again reminds me of it reads like a poem and it reads like a poem that should be read in Norfolk strong Norfolk accent so we'll have you know velvet have we know knives have they know powder? Had you know scissors? How do we know our Looking Glass had you know ribbons had they know chairs had you know reward? How do we no coaches had no place had they no pension hachinohe spoons.

Frank Key  27:50
Marvelous. And possibly during the show, I'm not sure how much time we have left. But this is a quotation from ma chaplet scuzz book shaman ism in Siberia. I haven't read the entire text but certain parts of it are superb. Like this bit. The cam as if approaching of a Yata of Ehrlich and coming into His presence. boughs, brings his drum up to his forehead and says, more glue, more glue. Then he declares whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts. This is meant to indicate that Ehrlich is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his ureter. The frightened cam leaps backwards towards the door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches Ehrlich's throne. After this performance has been gone through three times. Ehrlich speaks winged creatures cannot fly however, beings with bones cannot come. How have you, Ill smelling black beetle made your way to my abode.

Unknown Speaker  29:10
Have you ever said that to anyone Max? No, in the last fortnight, but you know, on occasion, yes.

Frank Key  29:16
After dinner, winged creatures cannot fly other beings with bones cannot come. How have you, Ill smelling black beetle made your way to my abode.

Unknown Speaker  29:26
It reminds me to die.

Frank Key  29:28
Exactly. And that's all from hooting yard on the air for this week. I do hope that I feel a bit better next week. But if I don't, you'll just have to put up with my voice sounding like this. I hope you've enjoyed the show. I'd like to thank max very much for joining us. Thanks. And that's it. I'm afraid by
