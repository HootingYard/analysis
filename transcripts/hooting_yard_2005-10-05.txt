Good afternoon. My name is Frank key and this is hooting, you're on the air. Today, I'm going to talk to you at you about wisps and clumps. gaining an insight into wisps and clumps will not give you a complete understanding of the physical universe in all its matchless wonder, but it's a start. Indeed, I can think of few subjects which prove a better introduction. Some people might talk to you of toads or gazelles or coconut matting, perhaps, or have strange irrefragable lights in the maritime skies. But I'll stick to wisps and clumps with occasional forays into be world. So what is a Wisp and what is a clump? We should look at each in turn. A Wisp might be made of smoke or some other fume, for there are countless fumes, gaseous and otherwise. One guaranteed way of seeing a Wisp with your very own eyes is to stand next to a dying bonfire. If you go and stand there too early while the bonfire is still blazing, perhaps with an effigy of Roman Catholic martyr Guy Fawkes engulfed in the flames, you will not be able to see any wisps, or much else because the Smoke will be billowing, making your eyes water. And if some scamp has placed any noxious substances on the bonfire, such as anything made of rubber or plastic, things will be even worse. And you may feel like choking. Indeed, you may even choke uncontrollably, and topple to the ground, helpless, helpless, helpless, as Crosby, Stills Nash and young were wont to sing long ago on the west coast of America. They say that David Crosby's mustache has to be preserved as a national monument. But I digress. Basically, what I'm saying is keep away from the bonfire. While it is while it is at its height. You want to go and stand next to it as the last embers are dying for it's then that you'll be able to see wisps of smoke. What are their characteristics, these wisps? Well, they're light, delicate and fugitive, you will see a Wisp rising from the glowing ashes and it will slink upon the breeze for a few moments, and then it will be gone. All that is solid melts into air, according to Marx and Engels in the manifesto of the Communist Party 1848. And this is certainly true of wisps which are hardly solid in the first place. Some substances take longer to melt into air than others of course, and this brings us neatly to clumps. clumps can be made of all sorts of things. And for the moment I want you to direct your attention to clumps of Earth, or soil or mud. Such clumps are often called clods, particularly by the visionary poet William Blake, who wrote the cloud and the pebble. But I'm sticking with clumps for the purpose of this diverting talk. At least I hope it's diverting. Now, there you were standing next to the bonfire while it blazed having arrived far too early for the wisps. And your eyes was streaming with tears, and you were coughing and choking, helplessly, remember, and the next thing that happened was that you toppled over and fell to the ground, perhaps even rolling into a nearby ditch. Let's assume you are sprawled there on your front face down in the muck. At some point in the next few minutes, the effects of smoke inhalation wear off and you open your stinging eyes. Chances are that the first thing you will see there in the ditch is a clump of Earth. One glance at it should be enough to show you that it will take longer to melt into air than a Wisp but melt into air it shall one day as all solid things do. We examine the characteristics of the Wisp so we'll do the same with the clump. But I have to say that I'm reluctant to do so. I think it's worth celebrating the ephemeral and fugitive nature of wisps, much as one admires clouds, or falls of snow, or the all too brief life of a bee. But a clump is just a clump really a clump or clod fit only to be kicked or squashed underfoot, crushed beneath the mighty boots of history.

I do hope that you've gained valuable insight into both wisps and clumps. If you wish to do any further reading, don't bother with the King James Bible, the Authorized Version, as neither wisps nor clumps are mentioned in it at all. Strangely enough, you might you may find a richer Trove in Dobson's pamphlet, a pamphlet about wisps and clumps with Dr. plagiarized shamelessly for this talk.

This is called the administration of lighthouses. It is with great pleasure that I have come to this charming if windswept seaside resort, the invitation of the Dobson Memorial Lecture organizing committee to speak upon that most fascinating of topics, the administration of lighthouses. First of all, I must confess that it's a topic of which I'm almost wholly ignorant, asked me about ponds, or badgers, and I can rattle on like a maniac for days on end. But I've never even set foot in a lighthouse and can think of no conceivable reason why I should ever want to muchas I adore Pons I am terrified of the sea. For the sea is a fearsome and horrible thing. progenitor of countless nightmares, a vast and and pitying force of nature, hideous to behold and murderous in its immensity. Still, I've promised to speak of lighthouses, and I'm not a man to shy away from a challenge. As luck would have it, my oldest and dearest friend, the Reverend FX Helio gobblers, has spent the best part of his life engaged in the administration of lighthouses, and he's been kind enough to share with me some of the more thrilling details of his career. You may think it odd that an ordained clergyman indeed a Jesuit should devote his life to such a calling. Father Helio gobblers, spends his days on horseback galloping across the land from one lighthouse to another, his pipe clamped in his jaws, and his catechism tucked into the pocket of his soutine the man hardly knows the meaning of rest. Sometimes he will accept an invitation to sleep overnight when a kindly light housekeeper offers him a mattress upon which to sprawl. But more often, this most driven of priests will ride his trusty steed through the night, careering with alarming speed along clifftop paths, whose Tempest direct fences have been broken or uprooted, and where both man and horse are in constant danger of plunging hundreds of feet into the churning waters below. I beg your pardon, I must pause for a sip of milk of magnesia

what is Father helia gobblers up to charging from lighthouse to lighthouse? I've asked him this question many times, and he simply refuses to answer merely clamping that pipe in his drawers and raising his eyebrows in a manner I find confounded Lee vexing. Oh, there have been times when I felt like dashing the man to the ground in a fit of deranged violence, but he's much stronger than me and indeed much taller. At seven and a half feet in height. He's bigger than most people I have come across as I wind my way through life on this blissful and miraculous planet. But I digress. The invitation to give this talk prompted me to ask Helio gobblers once again about life as an administrator of lighthouses. I tracked him down to a filthy harbor south of hooting yard, where he was being forced to pause for a few days due to his horse having contracted lock jaw. Helio gobblers was curled up in a chair in the corner of the veterinarian's waiting room. It was the kind of chair Michael Caine might have sat in in one of those mid 1960s films about swinging London. A number of sick animals. A badger among them, I noted, huddled together fearfully in the opposite corner of the room, staring wild eyed at the gesture And every now and then emitting whimpers of abject terror. I have this effect upon beasts of the field, said Helio gobblers language and unconcerned, they regarded me with dread as well, they might. I wondered whether to pursue this comment and decided against it. I have said that Helio gapless was my oldest friend, but I admit that there are times when he scares me out of my wits, as it was, I had no opportunity to say anything as my old mucker continued to speak. I understand that you wish to know something of my lighthouse administration activities he sneered. Otherwise you will suffer humiliation when called upon to speak of the subject at some godforsaken seaside resort. Is that correct? He did not wait for a reply, but his voice growing louder and causing the pitiable assortment of ailing badgers, stoats, hedgehogs, lampreys pigs, cormorants, axolotl, owls and bison to start up a soul wrenching cacophony of squealing hissing, whining and other indescribable noises. He stood up, towering over me and thundered Imagine a world a godless world bereft of divine order, in which each lighthouse keeper is allowed to do as he or she wishes. Picture them hundreds nay 1000s of lighthouses each running to its own timetable, each setting it to lights flashing and rotating and signaling link signaling and whatnot. Whenever the keeper feels like it, what is the result? chaos, pure and simple chaos leading to shipwrecks, tugboat accidents, boy disasters, General nautical mayhem and the Lord knows what other kinds of marine catastrophe is that the world you wish to inhabit? You'd be no better off than one of these sickly beasts here. He gestured violently towards a tiny Hummingbird with a stab wound on its head, which was trying to hide behind the veterinarians chaise long. These foul beasts He continued, which quiver and quake at my every word. No, that's not the world we live wish to live in. In our world. In God's world, we must make sure that lighthouse keepers do their work according to a plan. I carry in my saddlebags, a thumping, great book of over 900 pages. It is a manual of lighthouse administration. I have memorized every word in that book. Indeed, though, it pains me to say it, I know it better than I know my Bible. So as I traverse this evil land astride my second neglected horse, I go from lighthouse to lighthouse to ensure that the keepers are following the rules laid down in the manual. And if they stray from its command, I smite them.

Frank Key  13:08
Think not that the commands are onerous, most of them are simply common sense. But the devil works to undermine the sensible workings of each and every light house. I have seen with my own eyes, for example, I like to housekeeper have many years experience failing to sharpen his pencil over a wastepaper basket. Does he not know that wood shavings are a cause of fire, but by his actions, he could burn down his lighthouse in a matter of minutes. Again, I have seen a light housekeeper using a frayed rope to tie his boat to his jetty. It's barely imaginable. Such was his excitement that Helio gobblers began to hurl pieces of cutlery at the carrying animals. Tell me, I ventured. Do you just call around to these lighthouses and declaim instructive passages from your manual? Why, no, he replied, chucking a sugar spoon at a weasel. I'm not a harsh man. While in one saddlebag, I keep the manual with which to strike terror into the hearts of ingrates and backsliders. In my other sidle bag, I carry a selection of useful supplies. The items the keepers do not receive in their regular hampers from the lighthouse equipment warehouse. I bring them things such as gigantic rolls of blotting paper, hard boiled eggs steeped in Maple syrup, especially damned flags from every continent. Buckets filled with a solution for the removal of dried ink from hair reticules for the blind nozzles to be attached to burst cartons. This point, the veterinary surgeon entered the room to announce that the Jesuits horse was fully recovered. Father healio gobblers took my hand and nearly crushed it in bidding me fair well, within seconds he was gone, galloping away to administer his peculiar justice tempered with mercy to the lighthouse keepers of the land. I'm glad I'm not one of them.

arobin The last point is known as the cemetery bird, by law, or graveyard in that land are situated at the seaside sun, so one might expect goals or guillemots or other seabirds to be most associated with the tombstones. Yet it's the lock with small tufted, brightly colored, that is invoked in the funeral practices of the people of tamped horrobin. Why, as so often, we can turn to the out of print pamphleteer Dobson to help us answer this question. It's true throughout his copious writings, he never addressed the subject directly. True to that his knowledge of Ornithology was poultry and lamentable and more often than not wholly inaccurate. with dogs and it's a case of knowing where to look. We won't find a pamphlet called why they call the lat quick the cemetery bird in tantaran. But now, with the long overdrew publication of Aloysius nesting birds, mighty concordance dogs sone Ana, we know that the answer to the question can be pieced together from a number of sources. There is that impertinent little footnote in an essay about bowls, dishes and pots. There is a majestic sweeping paragraph in a pamphlet of majestic sweeping paragraphs. There is a ham fisted pencil drawing in the appendix to why I smashed my copy of thick as a brick by Jethro Tull into 20,000 pieces with a geological hammer and then glued it back together again. And of course, there are the famous lines hidden away in Dobson's so called Uber pamphlet, in which he writes lot quits flocked to the seaside cemeteries of tan Tara been in search of spurge and souk bind. They manage these plants greedily if one can use the word Munch to describe the way they tear savagely at the foliage with their beaks and swallow each beak full whole. Having no teeth, for I can now reveal that in common with other birds. Lots of weeds are innocent of teeth. Would that I could say the same for myself. commentators have long been amused at Dobson's presumption in claiming to be the first person in history to point out the obvious fact that birds don't have teeth. Less remarked upon is the fact that he's completely wrong about the Lockwood's diet. These birds which are small, tufted and highly brightly colored, as we have seen, eat neither spurge nor sUq bind. If they did so, they would surely die of poisoning, for they do not produce the enzymes necessary to break down and digest these particular plants. You can look that up in the most basic Encyclopedia of avian digestive systems. Who knows why Dobson could not be bothered to do so? Dobson would often bang on about his devotion to research. It made him something of a trying companion for it was not beyond him to regale a taverns worth of peasants with a harangue. Do you people realize he might shout apropos of nothing. But before writing my pamphlet entitled notes on a shelf of test tubes containing the blood of squirrels, I read 14 different encyclopedias from cover to cover. Together with the collected works of Emily Dickinson, tea Lobsang Rampa and Harold Pinta. Of course, in remarks such as these which have been reported to us by marigold, Chu and others, Dobson unwittingly makes clear that his understanding of research is to put it kindly, somewhat witless if he genuinely intended to say anything meaning about it. If he genuinely intended to say anything meaningful about the blood of squirrels, what perverse impulse would make him think he could find any useful material in, for example, the works of a grumpy bespectacled North London misanthrope.

And yet, this was always the way he worked with his magpie mind to the despair of some and to the delight of others. And that's why this new concordance will prove such a boon to scholars. If you want to know what Dobson had to say about the cemetery birds of tanta arobin. There's no point looking in any of the 89 pamphlets which mentioned birds in the title, nor in either of the two monographs on 10 Tower BIM related topics, which Dobson wrote while holed up in that milk of magnesia warehouse in Winnipeg. Similarly, should you want to discover what the great pamphleteer had to say about obsolete punctuation marks, it may come as some surprise to find that there are at least 20 pages of pertinent remarks in the virtually forgotten early pamphlet, observations on cows from a great distance in the rain. Speaking of cows, it's worth mentioning here that in addition to the seaside cemeteries with their allotted lock wits, there was in old tantaran, a single inland cemetery far from the sea, known as the graveyard of cows. On this occasion, we need not consult Dobson for the story as well known cows grazed in the graveyard of cows to keep down the grass. And when they died, the same cows were buried there. The mezzotint just an amateur historian of Tantra been wrecked tent. On Earth, the mezzotint, which showed the big signboard which stood at the graveyard gates, and he translated the notice engraved there on which reads as follows Hey there, pass or buy in the day or night, stop now, rest your weary legs and know that he stand at the gates of the graveyard of cows. This plot of land was given in perpetuity to cows alive and cows dead by order of the Grand plenipotentiary, Vizier of old tan Tara beam, according to visions which beset him as he knelt in his Hanging Gardens, pruning his love Burnham's Nola, Burnham's must grow in the grounds of the graveyard of cows, nor sank foil, nor rhubarb nor lupins. Nay, thou shalt find in this field, only towering hollyhocks among the grass and cows feeding upon the grass, and the cow shall feed upon the grass among the hollyhocks of these fields until such time as they perish. And each time a graveyard cow leaves this mortal world. Six villagers shall come onto here and use big spades to dig for that cow a grave beneath the grass. To villagers shall be named Ned. Two shall be blind. One shall wear the hat of boo hoo Cha, and one shall be a puny person. And they shall dig the grave for the cow in the nighttime under a black and starless sky, and bury their cow by morning. Now, move on traveller wherever you are bound. But remember, always the cows of 10 Tara beam, as long as you ever show live.

The Knights are drawing in, and soon we'll all be looking for pastimes to entertain us through the long winter evenings as ever, hooting yard is delighted to bring you some marvelously exciting but little known parlor games. And I'm going to begin with a with the traditional Ukrainian be counting game. First of all, what you'll need to do is find a picture of some bees, any picture of bees will do. And then you need to make enough copies that every member of the family or all the people who are playing. So everyone is given one copy of the B picture, a sheet of paper and a pencil. in alphabetical order by name, each player takes it in turn to count the number of bees in the picture large and small. So the picture you need to have more than one B in it. While they're counting. While that player is counting, everyone else has to stay still and not say a word. The counting player finishes by writing their name and the number of bees they've counted on their sheet of paper, fold it in half twice, and places it in the pot, which can be an upturned hat or a cauldron or some similar container. Then the next player counts the bees in the picture, and so on until there are as many pieces of folded paper in the pot as there are players. One family member is then nominated to take the papers from the pot, put them in an envelope together with one of the pictures of the bees a fix a postage stamp and address the envelope to the local official be counting person. Remember to write your return address on the back of the envelope. A second player is then nominated to go out into the dark knight wild with gales and pop the envelope into the nearest postbox. While they're gone, the remaining players place the rest of the big pictures in a neat pile and tidy away the pencils. Some weeks later, the official be counting person will send the result giving a definitive tally of the number of bees large and small in the picture, and announcing which player got closest to the correct total. The winner is allowed to choose another B picture for the next round.

Frank Key  28:22
You can tell that's an old traditional Ukrainian parlor game or well at least a traditional parlor game because of course, you have to post the news you know use the normal post, you can't use email to the official beat counting person. That would spoil the fun. Anyway. That's all we have time for on hooting yard on the air this week. I'll be back next week. I do hope you've enjoyed the show and enjoy the next program on resonance 104 point four FM Baba
