Good afternoon this is indeed hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. It's the show that someone said to me is a fool's paradise, but I'm not sure what they meant by that. And I'm going to read to you for half an hour. Now, there are small, green solid, edible spheres and you eat them from pods. I'm talking about peas, of course. Let's sing their praises, or if not sing, at least say a rhyme. at the dinner tables of hooting yard. There's a food we hold in high regard. Oh, I wonder what can it be? It's the little green edible sphere called the P. The shelling of peas has long been recognized as a therapeutic activity on a par with pig observation. Some doctors of the brain recommend that neurasthenic patients should spend an hour each day shelling peas and another hour leaning over the fence of a sty watching pigs. The experimental psychiatrist top in Paltrow suggested doing both at the same time, with results that have been hotly debated ever since. It was poll pros student PK Spaceman, who coined the term p q four p quote isn't your pq is easily calculated. Take the number of peas you have eaten in your lifetime and divide it by your age. This figure can be plotted on a grid against for example, your body mass index rotunda T of head shoe size and various phenological data. Dr. Spaceman was fond of citing Lloyd George's view that Neville Chamberlain had a quote wrong shaped head and put this down to a lack of peas in the latter's diet. Sometimes he attributed to it. Sometimes he attributed it in that's really hard to say I'm going to try again. Sometimes he attributed it to a lack of peace in the former's diet too. Sorry about that. Anyway, in desperate circumstances, for example, when one's life is at risk, peas can become useful tools, or at least adjunct to tools. There is the story of the Antarctic Explorer, clinging by his frostbitten fingertips to the edge of a crevasse down which he was about to plunge, who managed to clamber up onto the ice by fashioning a harness using ribbons, elastic bands and frozen peas. The out of print pamphleteer Dobson once plan to write an encyclopedia of P varieties and P recipes. But he abandoned the project after cracking his shinbone on a metal drum. The drum had been left directly outside his front door by a peripatetic person who ought to have been shelling peas and observing pigs. For this person could say, as Stanley Baldwin did, my inside is a mess of cold, rumbling fluidity. My brain is cost of faith is dying. Hope is dead. so miserable was this traveling drum person that he could no longer bear to carry his drum from place to place. And so with a sign like a dying wind, he unhitched it from his back and place it in Dobson's driveway. Then he rolled it as far as the front door and scribbled a note on the wrapper of a toffee apple, waited to the note on the drum with a pebble and trudged away to begin his life and new as the man of bandages. You might be wondering what the note said, it was simple enough, I can no longer carry my metal drum from place to place, keep it or discard it, I cannot a jot it read. As we have seen upon discovering the drum, Dobson's first act was neither to keep nor to discard it, but to bang his leg against it with such force that he almost broke the bone of the shin of his right leg. Why did Dobson's leg meet the cold hard edge of the metal drum with such force? Because Dobson was charging out of his house at high speed, so Fast that he would have appeared to any passer by as a mere blur, like the comic book character, Billy Wiz Dobson was normally slow and even lumbering of gait. On what account was he in such a hurry?

Always a man with an eye for a bargain. Dobson had just received a message on his metal Tapping Machine, telling him that in a marquee tent pitched in a field beyond Pang Hill, and mountebank was selling many peas at prices that were described as insane given that he was thinking hard about his plan p book, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss. Hence the way in which he jumped up from his s Gregoire, sending his chair clattering behind him, kicked off his two fools with vim, and wrapped himself in his big black coat, stuck his feet into a pair of Canadian forestry service boots, and whizzed out of his front door. His momentum was at this point brought to a shocking halt by the unexpected metal drum blocking his path, making contact with it Dobson how many people in the vicinity said later that they thought what they heard was a dog being clubbed by a brute, Allah bill Sikes in Oliver Twist, as played by the late Oliver Reed in the film version of Lionel Bart's musical, Oliver persistent rumors that Lionel Bart intended to follow this with a setting of another Victorian literary gem, Gerard Manley Hopkins poem, the wreck of the Deutschland in titled The tomb, none are unfounded. Did Dobson read the notes left by the peripatetic person who had abandoned the metal drum? No, he did not. Nor once his shin wound was anointed with underpants and wrapped in a bandage, did he go to the marquee tent in the field to buy a piece from a mountebank at insane prices? had he done so? He would have discovered that the insanity of the prices lay not in their cheapness, but conversely, in the fact that each individual p was on sale for a sum so staggeringly expensive, that it beggars belief. Many historians of the social scene have pondered the motives of the mountebank who was not trying to pretend there was anything special about the piece he had for sale. Indeed, his patter if we can call it that consisted of the repeated phrase come Heather and buy yourself a p at an insanely expensive price. Towns people shouted in an accent difficult to pin down and shouted repeatedly throughout the long afternoon, as clouds scattered across the sky and birds sang and the planets span in space millions of miles away. Peas have been compared with planets, sometimes by poets. The author of the song we heard at the beginning of this piece wrote other p related verses, in one of which he takes each planet in turn, using the mnemonic mud vinegar ectoplasm more hands, Jasper strathalbyn Z, unspeakable Nixon, popinjay and contemplates them as peas in a pod, not yet shelled by one of Dr. Spaceman wild eyed brain sick patients. There is no mention of pigs in the poem. Make a VAT what you will.

Yesterday, the Booker Prize was announced wasn't it which makes this the or the Man Booker Prize. It always surprises me that none of the authors ever refused to accept man Booker's money than being a kind of sinister financial institution. Anyway, that being said, Here is a pertinent quotation. This is from a 19th century book entitled The lady's vase by an anonymous author known only as an American woman. If you wish to become weak headed, nervous and good for nothing, read novels. I have seen an account of a young lady who had become so nervous and excitable in consequence of reading novels, that her head would be turned by the least appearance of danger, real or imaginary, actually was riding in a carriage over a bridge in company with her mother and sister. She became frightened at some fancy danger, caught hold of the reins and back to the carriage of the bridge down a precipice dashing them to pieces.

So that's what happens if you read novels. One novel you might read is the Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann. And this next piece is called the Magic Mountain, but you'll be pleased to hear that it's not a complete recitation of that novel. It just shares a title with it. The Magic Mountain some listeners will be familiar with the career of the sino Dutch artist are Fang Vanda, who can drop the man who invented potato peel on grab viewer. Few people know, however, that he was a keen mountain err, keen and inept, that is, our Fang walls If nothing else, a visionary, and he had visions of a haunted mountain, its peak shrouded in inexplicable purple mists, like something out of a novel by empty shield. Whenever he sat shivering in his tent at base camp, our Fang wondered if this mountain, the one he was about to climb, was the haunted mountain of his mind's eye. He would poke his head out of the frayed flap of his tent, pair up at the majestic rock formation disappearing into the clouds above and wonder if this at last would be the one he had dreamed of since childhood, where he would come face to face with the uncanny and the ineffable. Physically, our Fang was not really cut out for mountaineering. He was described by a contemporary as a figure of untold puny Enos. And he was indeed tiny and weak, short sighted, lanky and prone to swooning fits. He was terrified of gnats, horseflies and fruit bats. He had an oversensitive digestive system, and had to subsist mostly on thin soup or broth. It was difficult to find a mountaineering team willing to recruit so record a specimen. So our fan did most of his clambering up share rock faces solo, a man alone, testing himself against the elements. What he lacked in physical prowess are Fang made up for with a genius for publicity. Each time he descended from some pitiless, escarpment, battered, bruised, hallucinating, and in the last stages of exhaustion, the puny our pianist would hold a press conference. At one of these in 1929, he was questioned closely by Dobson no one is quite sure what in heaven's name Dobson was doing, hanging about in the foothills of the giant, terrifying mountains of tan tower BIM at the time. We know from the journals of marigold true that Dobson was at work on a series of pamphlets about glue, breadcrumbs, and the composer William hurlstone, 1876 to 1906, who's bassoon Sonata made him weep, and that he collected the tears in what he called his hurlstone bucket. It is beyond doubt however, that Dobson bustled through the entrance flap of our Fang Vander hooven dogs tend within minutes of the mountain is returned from the jagad heights of giant terrifying mountain number eight, the most challenging of the peaks in the tan tower Bhim range. The transcript of their conversation has been preserved. Our Fang, welcome to my press conference. Dobson. With all due respect, you look very puny for a mountain here are Fang I have seen things up in Yon mists and clouds that no human being has ever seen. I want you to tell the world dopson the lenses of your spectacles are extremely thick and what I know of the ocular sciences would suggest to me that you are myopic added To which they are steamed up your claim to have seen anything at all, let alone something of great import is frankly somewhat dubious. Are Fang frankly dubious. It may well be a person with a notebook and pencil, but I know whereof I speak for I was upon that mighty peak engulfed in mists, and you will not Dobson. That's true enough. An hour ago, I was sitting in one of the huts in these foothills eating porridge. I fled the heart when I saw three bears approaching. I did not know bears roam these foothills. Were there more bears up on the mountain? Are Fang Yes, there were bears up there. And there were other things beginning with B.

Frank Key  15:51
Dobson? What were those things beginning with B. Are Fang. I could prattle a list of nouns beginning with be pamphlet person and you would scuffle away happy, but a greater input is the sort of general mental impression I gained within the midst an impression which impinged upon my brain in a manner that can only be described as uncanny and redoubtable, for I have witnessed that which I knew from infancy awaited me. Even as a tiny tot. I was aware that in some broiling high altitude mist, I would come upon the elixir of glory. Dobson let me stop you there puny mountain here. I need to sharpen my pencil. Do you have a pencil sharpener? Are Fang let me look in my voluminous kit bag. Dobson. Thank you. While you rummage, I'm going to hike up the mountain myself to add credence to your witterings. The transcript ends there for the rest of his life. Dobson never spoke of what he found at the top of that mystic and magical mountain. If asked he would stare balefully into the distance as if in pranced. But he did write an account of what he found when he returned to our fangs base camp. It appears as a lengthy footnote in his out of print pamphlet, he who plucks the strings of a banjo in wintry wintry weather, and it reads as follows. When I descended from giant terrifying mountain number eight, I expected to find puny alpinist our Fang Vander hougen dorp, awaiting me with a pencil sharpener in his frostbitten hand. I even thought he may have sharpened my pencil for me in my absence, as an act of benefit since I was in a reflective mood. whistling William Hill stones, Snow White death sleep from the magic mirror. As I trudged towards the tent. There were Grimm huge winged birds circling overhead, and I gripped harder the piece of putty in my pocket, bustling through the flap, as I always bustle through tent flaps, I found no trace of our Fang, nor of my pencil. The man had vanished with his kitbag, his pencil sharpener, and I juiced he had acted like a common thief by taking my pencil with him. I had lost track of time up on the mountain, so I could not guess how long he had been gone. I wondered if puny as he was, he had been waylaid by the bears who roam those ill starred foothills, and I half expected to find a pile of chewed bones as I made my sad way to the railway station along the luminous painted footpaths. But I saw no bones, no bears. Nothing at all. Beginning with B. In all the hours it took me to plod away from that weird unwelcoming place. I never saw our Fang Vander hougen dorp again, but a year later, I learned that he was a passenger aboard the airship, the L Zed 129 Hindenburg, which exploded in flames, while approaching a moring Master lakehurst Naval Air Station in the state of New Jersey in the United States of America, I often find myself wondering if the stub of my pencil was a board that doomed airship

Something else now. Occasionally if you observe closely, it's possible to watch a crisis developing in a clump of sedge. On any given day. The crisis may involve sedge warblers, a type of bird, but it's unlikely to match the features of any of the six crises examined by Richard Milhouse Nixon, in his 1962 book of that title. Said crises tend to be river bankey by definition, so in addition to the aforementioned sedge warblers, one may also find that otters, frogs or hand carved wooden decoyed ducks are involved. In the case of frogs, it's advisable to make tape recordings of their croaks. These can then be analyzed at leisure back in the comfort of one's laboratory attended by mungo, the disfigured factotum it is not recommended to make recordings of any quacks which seemed to have the de cordex as their source. As these are, of course, utterly fraudulent, and many hours diligent lab time will be wasted as a result, if one has to pay rental for the laboratory space, this can be financially ruinous, fast compromising one's ability to resolve a sedge crisis, in some instances, fatally. Now, the most common said crises can be dealt with quite effectively by the ammeter. And the whole thing should blow over within a week special patrol unit dedicated to this type of work, or to be called in if the crisis last any longer. telephone numbers for more than a dozen such teams can be found in the directory of sedge crisis resources available my mail order. Unfortunately, there are some imposters who prey on the naive and the credulous genuine crisis teams will always always wear caps with earflaps. As soon as possible after the crisis has been dealt with a full written report in the international standard format must be submitted to the authorities. This is a legal requirement, and failure to comply will result in criminal charges and deportation to a secret facility disguised as a cream cracker factory, where the malefactor will be poked out with forks and bashed on the head with a big iron utensil.

I have a little blind Dolly, she is stuffed with straw. I have not named her yet. I've only had her for half an hour. I found her on a patch of waste ground half an hour ago, I was out walking. I suppose I should say I was out limping because I limp when I walk. My left leg is shorter than my right leg on account of a mysterious childhood illness. I was limping along near the canal when I passed a patch of waste ground and saw the blind Dolly stuffed with straw. She had been abandoned possibly by some ungrateful infant in gratitude is the besetting sin of today's infants. That is my opinion not shared by all. rooting around on the waste ground, I noticed other things including a pair of blue buttons, I think I can say with some confidence that they were made of Bakelite. I suppose that they may have been the eyes of my little blind Dolly once upon a time, but they had become detached, perhaps when she was thrown with a certain amount of violence onto the patch of waste ground from the wound down window of a Chevrolet passing at high speed in the backseat of which an ungrateful infant was throwing a tantrum that would fit the factors I found them. I did think about selling the buttons back on to my little blind dollies cloth head about 25 minutes ago, but decided against doing so. She has been robbed of her sight and I do not presume to play God. I have placed both buttons in my pocket However, in case they come in handy for another purpose, a purpose which will be revealed to me at the true time. For the moment, I'm concerned with selecting a name for my little blind Dolly. No doubt the ungrateful infant who tossed her Side had a name for her, but in 20,000 years I would be unable to guess what it was. It is not as if she has her name embroidered on the soul of her cloth foot. At home, I have a whole shelf full of books by Tony Buzan. They are all packed with tips to make better use of my brain, but not one of them tells me how to pronounce the author's name is it Buse n or is it Busan until I find out my little blind Dolly will have to have two names. She will be Susan Busan or Suzanne Suzanne. I'm going to make a little black cape for her to wear just like Tony views and cape only smaller because she is not a living, breathing mindmap maker. She is just my little blind Dolly. I will find a small piece of cloth for the cape. And if it is not already black, I will have to dye it or smear it all over with black boot polish. I have got more black boot Polish than I know what to do with. I often think about that song by Jethro towel. Dr. Bogan broom, because I bought all the boot Polish from a cobbler named Mr. Bogan broom, when he shut up his shop. He told me he was going to see but he did not say which See, he meant it could have been the Baltic, the red or the dead, or one of the other ones. I didn't ask him because he was quite a frightening man. And in those days, I did not have my little blind Dolly to hide behind. But now I have and nothing will ever frighten me again.

I'd like to end today's show with one or possibly two quotations and more quotations from others. This is from a very old book by john Conrad, a man called the talking death man. The human voice is air impregnated and made sonorous by the impressed character of the life or is such as whilst it is in breathing fourth, the smite upon the organs of the voice. So as they tremble thereupon, for indeed, without this tremulous motion, no voices made, yay, not only the larynx or windpipe, death there upon tremble, but the whole skull also, yay. And sometimes all the bones of the whole body, which anyone may easily find in himself, by his applying his hand, his throat and laying it on the top of his head. So you can try that at home, see if you can, when you speak, you can make all the bones of your body tremble. I just tried it while I was reading that. And it works. That's all from hooting out on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. Remember, you can always visit the heating yard website, the quickest way there is probably just right hooting yard in Google takes you straight to the page. And yeah, I'll leave you to it. And thank you for listening and I'll be back next week with more stuff. Bye bye
