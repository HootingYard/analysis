resonance 104 point four FM. And this is a special edition of hooting yard on the air Special Edition in two senses. One is because it's a kind of sniffily cold, coughing, generally sick kind of episode. So if my voice sounds a bit strange and I sound as if I can't breathe. That's because that's how it is. And the other thing is that I have a special guest on this week's show. Max desharnais wit raconter and a man who knows beekeeping like the back of his hand, Max will be with us in a while, but first I'd like to read you a thrilling yarm. I was invited to saw the sheds so I wore a pair of gloves. Have you got that so far? sheds gloves. The snow was thick so we were preceded by a snow plow the engine of which ran on fuel of a certain amount of uncertain origin, sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, make a note when I say that the origin or provenance of the fuel was uncertain. I mean that I did not know of it. Not that it was unclear to those people who know their snowplows and other vehicles. Of course, they knew where their fuel came from. I didn't need to know. sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snow plows, other vehicles. Are you beginning to see where this leads? As soon as we got inside the first shed on the tour, I removed my gloves and put them on a shelf above a gas heater. Have I managed to pipe gas out here with something else? I didn't know. We were meant to have a picnic in this first shed but no one had remembered to bring the hamper. sheds gloves snow fuel snowplows, other vehicles shelf gas picnic hamper. bursting within human courage, I volunteered to return to the Biddy house alone to fetch the hamper. Various half hearted attempts were made to dissuade me, but I waved them aside with my now on gloved hands. It has to be said that my waves were theatrical, even melodramatic, but I enjoyed the sensation. I could feel my blood pumping through my veins. sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snow plows, other vehicles, shelf gas, picnic, hamper, bitty house waves blood. Stop me when you've cottoned on. I left my gloves on the shelf above the gas heater and went out into the snow. Without a compass. I strode off in what proved to be completely the wrong direction. Instead of reaching the bitty house where I would find the hamper and heave it onto my shoulder, and take it back to shed number one for the picnic. I found myself lost and not only lost, but encircled by wolves. The wolves each had a dusting of fresh snow on their backs. I took this to mean that they had been standing around for a while waiting for me. sheds, gloves snow, fuel, snow plows, other vehicles, shelf gas, picnic hamper Biddy house waves, blood compass wolves. I counted 17 snow covered wolves, they remained perfectly still looking at me. nursery rhymes are a godsend in such circumstances. At least that's been my experience. So I began with Ring a Ring of roses and then did little jack Horner, not a single wolf moved a muscle. It then dawned on me that they were all blind, blind wolves in the snow, and me lost and without my gloves and ignorant of fuel sources, and further than ever from the picnic hamper. What a predicament, or was it? You be the judge? Now listen, just once more. shades, gloves, snow, fuel, snow plows, other vehicles, shelf gas, picnic, hamper, bitty house waves, blood, compass, wolves, roses, muscles, Dawn, blind.

Unknown Speaker  04:52
All should now be clear, as clear as the sky was on that cold bright morning in September 40 miles north of health Key, the capital city of Finland founded as long ago as 1550. As a rival to the Hanseatic city of Tallinn.

Unknown Speaker  05:46
I'm bound to forget this, so I better do it now at this point in the show. Are you a pod person? If you are a pod person, coating yard on the air is one of the shows that you can get, you can subscribe for absolutely no fee to podcasts of go to www.resonance.com and click on podcasts or search for hooting yard on the iTunes Music Store. And if you do that, the joys of the hooting yard podcast can come to your very own computer. Meanwhile, this is a piece called Pabst TAC. Perhaps does tak perhaps to sludge, pastors pastors of him we sing. We sing his praises, it seems to me for want of anything better to do, perhaps to tax it's on his great golden throne belching out light, a blinding light as gorgeous as it is uncanny. And yet it is an impure light that is certain, for which perhaps this tack comes perhaps to sludge. It is the latter who is the source of those scarcely perceptible low booming noises, grave and deep and sinister. When perhaps to us, Perhaps this was installed on his throne, there was Carnival and cruising fools danced around maypoles and jesting roster is roasted and dusted, as if tomorrow would never come. No one has ever been able to count the pies that were cooked that day. Many, many people drowned at the swimming gala at the old crumbling outdoor pool, and ravens were seen hovering in the sky. a post office person stuck pictures of perhaps just tacked to his hat and was chased across the fields by happily screeching children. But was there a trace of desperation in their screeching and tomorrow did come Of course, as everyone knew it had to that was when the first rumbles were heard of pastor sludge. To appease him. The throne was moved to a higher point on the hill just above the coppice where moles betrayed their presence in their usual mole like way, a gang from the tavern headed further armed with rifles. Until perhaps Deus, perhaps Deus made it known that moles were sacred and must never be harmed. Some say the men turn their rifles on themselves in terror. Terror, it is said is the only proper response to perhaps to tack into perhaps the sludge wrapped up tight in their cardigans, hanging Tilley lamps from the rafters of their cabins. The braver villages plot his overthrow, turnips or chewed cigarillos dangle from the blackened lips of the vanguard secret anthems never written down, a mumbled rather than Sung. Food poisoning has wiped out most of these souls since perhaps, perhaps this first cat emitted his light and his booms 17 years ago. The Throne has been moved again moved and reinforced. Now it is perched on a sort of concrete veranda by the edge of a lake in which only puffy and bloated fish may swim. larval creatures are strewn on the shore watched over by one of popsters tax lieutenants. The air is thick, clotted far too hot for this region. With each faint boom from perhaps to sludge the shoreline creatures Twitch, it is never dark here, thanks to perhaps this tack. Between the lake and the coppice lies the village a deranged tangle of overhead wiring stretches beyond the horizon supported on high wooden poles which sway and Creek in the constant wind Nowadays, children are no longer taught to sing. Perhaps this tack, perhaps the sludge, perhaps this perhaps does made the wind. Perhaps this made it because we seemed that they should be taught that it's dangerous to forget.

Unknown Speaker  11:04
Because I'm a very sick man, as you can probably tell from my voice. I'm going to take a rest now. And I'm going to hand you over to Max desharnais, who's going to? Well, I don't know, what are you going to do next?

Unknown Speaker  11:16
I'm going to read a little bit from it's an English French dictionary from 1876 that I brought along, which I like I like dictionaries that try and tell you what you might need on your travels. And probably one of the best ones ever found was when when I bought a Japanese as a modern Japanese dictionary. And being for the modern traveler published in about 1999. They thought that you would need a section called chatting someone up. So you you get past the bit where they say Hello, and thank you and what's your name? to suddenly they launch into? Yes, you're very good looking. And then they have a phrase which goes I'd say Nakata, mo arikara. Ne, which basically is we must be careful of AIDS, which I think in a in a chat up line is possibly extreme, but they were, they were certainly acting in a fine tradition. Because if you read Richard and Cotton's new English and French dialogues from 1876, the situations that they expect that you might run into in in foreign climes are quite, quite amusing. They have a section called of antipathy and aversion. And the first phrase is just, I do not like that man. which point you think Well, yeah, fair enough. But then they go into I find his anything but prepossessing. He inspires in me, a certain disgust, a sort of aversion. His look is not prepossessing and then you get into there his something repulsive in his address, I cannot surmount my antipathy to him, it is difficult for me to surmount the disgust with which he inspires me. This goes on then for about another two pages, which which the tiresome, Prater is as good as a sleeping draft. One gapes at the sight of him. What an insupportable fellow, should we never get rid of him rid of him? And has he sworn to Jesus all day? Then, of course, there's the bits where you're supposed to be just politely inquiring on the health of friends and family. And if someone has just said, Oh, yeah, the house, you know, How's everything? Is the wife doing fine. You're supposed to come out with a phrase which goes, yes. My eldest sister had the whooping cough, the youngest had the measles, my eldest brother, the smallpox, and the youngest and miliary fever. Frank, any idea what a military fever might possibly

Unknown Speaker  13:50
it could be a military fever with a team meeting

Unknown Speaker  13:53
could be. I mean, there is actually a very handy list of sicknesses and disease that unite.

Unknown Speaker  14:00
I probably have most of them at the moment. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  14:02
Let's do checklists. If you have a pain, yeah, headache. Yeah. toothache? Yeah. stomach. Yeah. Sore throat. Yep. Quint Quinsey. Absolutely. Okay. Sick headache. Yep. colic, yep. Fever, flu, intermittent fever. And the aq.

Unknown Speaker  14:20
Yes, last

Unknown Speaker  14:21
time I checked, okay. tertian au.

Unknown Speaker  14:24
Yep. A cold fit.

Unknown Speaker  14:25
Mm hmm. shivering

Unknown Speaker  14:26
Yep. hydrophobia? Absolutely cold. Yeah. A cough. Yeah, hoarseness. Yes. Short breath.

Unknown Speaker  14:32
Yeah. The jaundice. Yes. Okay. The falling sickness. Yes, a fainting fit. Yeah, swim. Yeah, the scurvy. Yep. leprosy. Yes. The plague. Yes. The smallpox? Yes. The measles? Yes. dizziness. Yep. giddiness? Yeah, the dropsy.

Unknown Speaker  14:49
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  14:50
a swelling.

Unknown Speaker  14:51
Yes. Saw yes oil.

Unknown Speaker  14:56
Take it as read all these.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
So obviously going to France with was a relatively dangerous proposition. In those days, there's there's phrases here that they read like poetry or that if you if you string them together or the way they appear on the page, it goes, am I not modest? Is she not pretty? Are we not mortal? Are you not careless? Are they not languishing? Was I not pale? Was he not sullen? were we not opulent? Were you not peremptory? Were they not proud? Was I not punctual? Was he not punctilious? were we not polite? We are not reasonable. Were they not crotchety? Shall I not to be useful? Have you ever said Shall I not be useful?

Unknown Speaker  15:45
mostly about once a day? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:48
necessarily bad routine? And was he not? Will he not be steady? Shall we not be wise? And will you not be quarrelsome? I think

Unknown Speaker  17:06
we're not peremptory or crutches. He will hear from Max again later in the show, but I just like to read this to you. Low in that year of torrential rainfall and storm clouds I set out from the city carrying with me naught but a few rags. I saw cows grazing. I heard horses winning. At the edges of farmyards. I hid behind hedges. My appearance was not one to encourage some cherry trigged farmer's wife to invite me in for a dish of scrambled eggs. for days on end is nothing but berries, or scraps of leftover cake from countryside wedding parties abandoned in a panic after visitations from extraterrestrial beings dressed up in glistening metallic space, clothing and armed with laser guns. Everywhere I went, I saw evidence of burned out barnyard and terrified geese. After roaming aimlessly for about three months, I came to a city by the sea. I sat on a milestone and gazed at the unfamiliar skyline. Some of the masts of ships docked in the harbor were taller than the buildings. I fed a handful of crumbs to the goose that had been accompanying me for the last few days and patted eternally bobbing head. Let us march into that city and be bold. I announced to the goose pointlessly, for it did not understand the word of human language being a goose. Nevertheless, it followed me as I hoisted my bag of rags onto my back and strode towards the customs post on the edge of the city. The weather was still tempestuous, I cannot count the number of puddles I squelch through more how many schools set that little goose or jitter the customs post when at last we lumbered up to it was deserted. But for a man of great illness lying sprawled on a pallet, whose moans took only moments to irritate me. Indeed, the sound of human whining after months of solitude set my teeth on edge to such an extent that I bid the goose stifle him as best it could. The goose sat on the sick man's head while I rifled through the filing cabinets. It was at this precise moment that the press photographer bounded through the door and took snaps of the scene which will be familiar to you. startled by camera flashes, the goose fled. I backed against the wall ragged and I must confess, while died. The sick man was transmogrified. Only now did I become aware of his police uniform as he and the photographer exchange the glands that conveyed some terrible significance. That is why I'm writing to you from a prison cell. Thus far I have fed my interrogators a pack of lies, but I do not know how much longer I can hold out. Please, please my darling, try as best you can to smuggle in a package of sellotape soap, bleach, some pins, a map and a bale of plastic sheeting so that I can make good my escape.

Unknown Speaker  20:55
This is probably not the best place to read. When when, when one is a sick man, but I'm going to read it anyway. Anyway. Attaching clamps to the slats with quarter inch Gulliver bolts I smeared the lattice work with a decoction of binding agents and threaded the netting through the 10 clips, allowing me to dislodge the hasp on the paddle in order to provide enough purchase on the metal flanges which were arranged in rotation. Beside the color coded pails, the white one being strapped to a clogged bracket, the red ones spinning on the torque engine, the blue one held in place by rubber frets and the black one timing against the elementium knob on the Wicked Witch had been fastened to the anchorage unit by a system of winches controlled by a clay handle on the bowl against which pellets were fired at pre arranged intervals by the steam gun just below the fourth set of novel nozzles cleverly positioned at such a distance from the first three sets to provide a constant stream of gases to pass over the tarpaulin in which punctures had been made to allow ease of passage for the and iron tubes carrying ball bearings to the spandrel and thus onto the rotating wooden platform upon which the greased hinges chafed against the pulleys sufficiently for the sparks to ignite sulfur bombs inside the Bakelite carriage without endangering the pads, bulbs and trucks on the hooter of the sounding of which the intricately wired snares would snap shot and entrap the oil plasticine clumps thus momentarily halting the recurrent biting movements of the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of Taj into the motor around where Dre had placed Canvas bags, packed with candles. In order to steady the persistent rattling of the ticker on the back of the iron sledge underneath the trolley, carrying the double battery powered hammer which serves to agitate the drum, containing the four inch blades detached from the rusted bowl of the compass held in place by the rocket on a monstrous titanium screw wedged against the plackets of the grits distributor I had earlier customized by locking its gut probes into position with no less than 26 separate multiple gate plugs on each of which a scorched zinc disc swiveled in response to the magnetic properties of the special basin receiving the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling out of the glass globe tethered to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate by chains, which ran parallel to the length of string tied at one end to the pirates Oriole and at the other to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags I had stolen from the same warehouse, which provided the hooks for the plank balanced uneasily across the gap between the pinboard and the heart ometer fitted with small beeswax parcels lashed to the crane, from which dangled several springs and coils loaded with lead weights and enameled cubes, the purpose of which became apparent when the gleaming cork was plunged into the canister of boiling duck pond water kept at constant temperature by hastily repaired piping fed by siphons and buttress by giant prongs from the surfaces of which had been expunged precisely engraved instructions for the use of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the Derrick next to the pumps on the tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange taffeta swaddling material as a soft target who provided the jars, flakes and asbestos free wing cranks are required for timing the bleaching operation on the plastic squirting mechanism molded out of discarded beetle cat salvage from a manufacturer of resins, whose grotesque sponge hood had been incorporated into the workings of the shiny magnesium tripod, a top which looked a uranium pill squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic pan, containing phosphorus hoops, and a glamorous level trumpet pitch towards a cobalt beaker lit up by the McKenzie beam angled obliquely next to a yellow fasti and canopy covering a massive trellis to which were glued and appended cone, veiled by cotton wall wrapped around a toy horse with a propeller caked in mercury powering the fulcrum and bails on the fractured tub counter sunk behind the crust of a feather on a stall with pins affixed to the leaching grill place to skew the top, the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Incredible as it may seem, I had stitched the flap to the basket with insufficiently strong cord, and it now became dangerously loose. There is a long sentence, so I need a wrestler. So here's max.

Unknown Speaker  26:00
finish up with just a little bit from a section entitled to express displeasure and grief, which begins with a less and aa and what pain but then swiftly moves on to grief deprives me of all feeling, I am swallowed up in affliction. And my favorite after so many misfortunes, it only remains for me to die. I mean exactly. How many times have you wished could you could say that to whoever you happen to be trying to communicate with one of the other bits a section entitled negatively and interrogative Lee which which again reminds me of it reads like a poem. And it reads like a poem that should be read in Norfolk, strong Norfolk accent so I will hassey no velvet. Have we know knives, have to know powder. Had you know scissors, had you know a looking glass had you know, ribbons had no chairs hodja no reward had we no coaches had no place had they no pension hachinohe spoons.

Unknown Speaker  27:05
Marvelous. And possibly during the show I'm not sure how much time we have left. But this is a quotation from ma chaplets because book shamanism in Siberia. I haven't read the entire text but certain parts of it are superb. Like this bit. The cam as if approaching of a Yata of Ehrlich and coming into His presence. bows, brings his drum up to his forehead and says more glue more glue. Then he declares whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts. This is meant to indicate that Ehrlich is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his Yatta the frightened cam leaps backwards towards the door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches Ehrlich's throne. After this performance has been gone through three times. Ehrlich speaks winged creatures cannot fly however, beings with bones cannot come. How have you Ill smelling black beetle made your way to my abode. Have you ever said that to anyone Max?

Unknown Speaker  28:27
Not in the last fortnight but you know, on occasion. Yes. After dinner,

Unknown Speaker  28:33
winged creatures cannot fly other beings with bones cannot come. How have you Ill smelling black beetle made your way to my abode.

Unknown Speaker  28:42
It reminds me to die on. Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  28:46
And that's all from hooting yard on the air for this week. I do hope that I feel a bit better next week. But if I don't, you'll just have to put up with my voice sounding like this. I hope you've enjoyed the show. I'd like to thank max very much for joining us. Thanks. And that's it, I'm afraid. Bye.

Unknown Speaker  29:13
Now on resonance 104 point four FM. Mr. Richard Thomas presents an investigation into Chris Hill Park.

Unknown Speaker  29:22
All right. Here we are then steve wynn trestles Park. Golf green lanes is rather noisy.

Unknown Speaker  29:32
like playing cricket with his son there

Unknown Speaker  29:34
must be a very nice batting. Very dissatisfying experience. What would imagine a group of man over there all

Unknown Speaker  29:45
dressed in matching clothing?

Unknown Speaker  29:46
Yeah, maybe there's some kind of society. Both girlfriend and board, mother Hodgins watch

Unknown Speaker  29:54
is a woman and slightly a young girl with a video.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
husband and son coordinates a game of football.

Unknown Speaker  30:09
is doing the commentary, though is one isn't there? It does the commentary

Unknown Speaker  30:16
for kids with lots of different balloons that is quite peculiar. This is a cornfield you can see

Unknown Speaker  30:21
in Ghana because they're not blowing around and they're playing a game.

Unknown Speaker  30:23
So there's like five children, I think, for me, like, five, and they've got balloons pinned to the floor. The slope of the graph.

Unknown Speaker  30:34
Yeah. And then they've got big candles balloons themselves as

Unknown Speaker  30:38
well. And what clothes Can we see we see two orange, one pink, one red, one green, and one blue, which is kind of like a powder blue.

Unknown Speaker  30:48
They've got a good setup, though. At the back there. They've got the table chairs, Cooley box.

Unknown Speaker  30:56
Yes, it's so perfect. Nick, hang on. There is a there's a bourgeois premacy bourgeois pram? You don't know who I am. But you're spoiling the scene in Newington green. You're on the streets here in the shops. You're on the buses. You're on the tubes. You're in my face. You're in my mind. You're in my face or in my mind, and if I were a judge, you would be fine. That's all I've got Santa's

Unknown Speaker  31:27
awful stuff. Should

Unknown Speaker  31:30
I still got a coat of arms? But if they haven't, that should be part of it.

Unknown Speaker  31:51
Ignore the Luqman trying to get you. They're trying to get your day off. They are coming from the bottling. Go ask a fat burning green is defunct. Look at it and it's yellow. And it's got weeds grown and stuff. No cares about it.

Unknown Speaker  32:06
And it's prime. Those yobbos would have been replaced by old men and white outfits.

Unknown Speaker  32:11
What can we see? We can see? I tell you what I can see is a number of a castle over there. Yes, the climbing set one top video the climate centric was a some some form of couldn't be the penal institution it's like some form of a

Unknown Speaker  32:23
penal made

Unknown Speaker  32:27
some sort of

Unknown Speaker  32:29
the reservoir Holly

Unknown Speaker  32:30
kind of Victorian folly designs resembling a Norman castle and I think then what it was but it was something to do the reservoir and yeah, number of couples around in conversation. And then of course the because groups of people certainly grass. Kids, I won't give it an oversized football with blue spots on the blank.

Unknown Speaker  32:52
Respect in the perspective for

Unknown Speaker  32:56
people prams the pleasing work with kids spokes

Unknown Speaker  33:13
walk in the park

Unknown Speaker  33:16
looking at the opposite sex and

Unknown Speaker  33:21
in my time looking at the opposite

Unknown Speaker  33:22
of the same sex many people go cottaging in parks and

Unknown Speaker  33:25
I believe this is

Unknown Speaker  33:28
very action

Unknown Speaker  33:29
does it? Well, maybe maybe you'll get lucky go

Unknown Speaker  33:33
down the avenue Park Cemetery I believe

Unknown Speaker  33:35
Let's go and see what the animals I've got to say that with just approaching some deer. Today you can see tiny baby ones quite proud of them. quite unusual thing the Angelo isn't it? Actually, I don't think it's got a very much practical purpose. I believe that they will occasionally use in the form of weaponry.

Unknown Speaker  34:17
lock horns, famously.

Unknown Speaker  34:19
mating ritual. Ah, hello. Yeah, not too bad. All right. Yeah, I'm just I was just sort of enjoying your wisdom. I didn't realize you're recording. Yeah. I'm just random stuff. Yeah. As soon as you write

Unknown Speaker  34:47
Yeah, cool. Yeah, really get what you're up to tonight. busy.

Unknown Speaker  34:50
Um, maybe? Yeah, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  34:57
All right, maybe see Dan. Yeah, can look good. Should I buy?

Unknown Speaker  35:12
Some beast of some kind? is a chicken

Unknown Speaker  35:24
Where's your coxcomb? Where is your coxcomb? Chicken?

Unknown Speaker  35:40
Fried chicken is the stereotypical chicken, the bright red coxcomb and the white plumage and feathers.

Unknown Speaker  36:01
queueing should point out isn't from the chicken that would be quite odd. That's from two pigeons. Well, I think the noise is really from one pigeon. Trying to mate with another

Unknown Speaker  36:16
puffed up

Unknown Speaker  36:18
you've seen it before.

Unknown Speaker  36:58
So it becomes clear that parks in London even though they presented on the premise of space, they're actually quite densely populated places on there. There's quite a large amount of people in the pie he uses it it's quite noisy isn't it surprising? Yeah. Should we go that way? Close to

Unknown Speaker  37:17
the main drag as well.

Unknown Speaker  37:19
I think it's just because

Unknown Speaker  37:20
people fields into space you go that's

Unknown Speaker  37:25
Yeah, but I think he's worked as well as people covet a shelter. Oh, I defined spots so they go near trees and sand.

Unknown Speaker  37:35
No trees down there as well.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
Yeah, but it's near the road. In that case to be quite nice sounds in the park. Just hidden little girl pushing sort of small kids sort of type trends in. Yeah, dog wandering around to see if I can pick up the pad of his feet against the tarmac as a blank, Dutch dooryard. Rabbit.

Unknown Speaker  38:13
He said a bit of grass. You're taking chocolate cream. Bang. Very nice. Excellent Park choice. Steve. Chewing gum in the bin on the floor.

Unknown Speaker  38:30
We get near the Avery now. Many finches in this Avery. Let's have a listen. Yeah look at the state of the little stream live stream

Unknown Speaker  40:15
yes

Unknown Speaker  40:21
Val D on some of this pond. What can you see in the in the in the in the scum float in the floating in the scum

Unknown Speaker  40:29
there's a piece of bread

Unknown Speaker  40:32
kind of thought Pepsi plastic transparent water container or some things like avocado stems plank two bottles of ABS and

Unknown Speaker  40:50
leaves a water pistol were over there in the quarter next to the big being covered Hovis bread back.

Unknown Speaker  41:00
Yeah horrible bread back design, isn't it kind of coldness and behind so this is all

Unknown Speaker  41:04
bright white stuff the ducks remain remarkably clean despite swimming around in that filth.

Unknown Speaker  41:18
Let's walk on nothings this

Unknown Speaker  41:22
dank stretch of water. just got home from church. One of the reasons it's one of my favorite parks in London is that it's not a royal Park. It's not like Regent's Park or Hyde Park.

Unknown Speaker  41:47
Victoria Park

Unknown Speaker  41:49
wasn't it wasn't clear souls ground? Well, yeah, it might have been Oh, no, it's

Unknown Speaker  41:54
crap, but it's not been claimed by the Royal so this has not been deemed by gracious Majesty the Queen to be allowed to come here.

Unknown Speaker  42:04
This is a Hackney Borough Council.

Unknown Speaker  42:06
This is our pop by the people of Hackney and run for them by Hackney Borough Council.

Unknown Speaker  42:15
quite far away from me doing us a favor. Yeah. There's a few of them, I suppose is why London feels would be the other one.

Unknown Speaker  42:23
Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Quite a tradition of the non raw Park and happening.

Unknown Speaker  42:37
Kid chasing the pigeon. As he chased him he didn't he kind of extended his arms if he were flying to make a move to the Benson. Yeah, I'm

Unknown Speaker  42:50
laying money stop there. Now.

Unknown Speaker  42:53
There's a big plastic ice cream.

Unknown Speaker  42:57
Yeah. No bandstand.

Unknown Speaker  43:00
All right. Let's count the balls. A quite an abstract practice or entity and themselves, aren't they? But they were the guardian of nothing. They wouldn't look out of place. filmed at an obtuse angle in black and white in some, some some sort of Michelangelo Antonioni film was only that odd looking tree. Yeah, there's a tree that's been beheaded, essentially. So you just get the trunk and the roots still embedded in the ground. And you see a large x and above it

Unknown Speaker  43:30
as a piece of flat word on the top.

Unknown Speaker  43:33
Yeah. As if two is your sort of keeping something in it. Yeah, that's fine. It looks like a chimney, doesn't it? Anyway, let's count the bottles. I say 1-234-567-8910 1112 1314 1516 1718 19
