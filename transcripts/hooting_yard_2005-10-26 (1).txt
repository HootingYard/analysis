Good afternoon. This is holding out on the air My name is Frank key. This week show bit of a bit of a hotchpotch bit of a rag bag of mostly short pieces. And if you're listening to this and feeling a bit listless, don't worry because they'll probably be quite a few lists involved. And then you won't be listless. This is called my little blind crow. So there I was kneading dough, thinking about Edgar Allan Poe, and my heart fit to burst about my little blind crow. The moon was full, and it cast a glow. Santa's in the chimney said, Whoa, whoa, whoa, I wept hot tears for my little blind crow. The wind does how the Gale death blow. They used to call starlin Uncle Joe. But Starling never sobbed all night for my little blind crow. Parsley, sage, rosemary and time. Brother, can you spare a dime? Sister? Are you too crumpled with Whoa, when you think about my little blind crow? They say that starlings, five year plans made Russia strong. But that has nothing to do with my song. I want it set to music by status quo. The sad sad song for my little blind crow.

The lady in the lake kept a beak, the beak of a bird. The third bird. The first bird was a chaffinch. The second was a vulture, the third bird was dead. its beak had been detached and she kept it as a keepsake in her locket in her pocket. The quick and the dead, the dead and the sick, the sick and the sad. The sick man was sad. He wrote his will. He planted His truth. He was a sick as a dog. He was sick in the trough. The truth of the truth, those shoes of his his shoes, the truth of boots and shoes. A boot is a shoe, the beauty of boots, the Mutiny on the Bounty, a bountiful feast, the test of the best. deceit is a crime, the crime of the truth, the truth of the crime in much haddam Is that true? I've not checked the check on the stripe, the striped and the hooped the patent and plane, the brain drain, the drain at the curb, the curb of the path, the path of life, the death of Earth, the depth of crime, the crime of passion, the Scarlet Pimpernel, the pimpled and sick, the sickness unto death.

But enough of always poetry, if that's what it is. We will probably want a fact and Here's a fact is a fact about the tantaran carton. The tanto arobin carton was recovered from an old potting shed by Dobson during one of his forays into what he called a narco patter psycho archeo ontology. It's a ceremonial carton, which was used for unknown purposes during ceremonies prosecuted by the bleach splatters. Tan tar have been priesthood grim and horrifying these rituals may have been but not the carton. It is 45 centimeters in height has a jewel encrusted Crimplene bass, ivory fluting rooster silk under belts, hectic trimmings, a delightful milky green ribbed spandrel villainous scraping marks and gutta percha rim, opalescent bison head motifs swiveling glutinous beads inlaid with serried gems fluidly hatching precise web and tuck to fragment talc staples, a ribbon nightside opening on the velvetine casing. Some Robert Bruce kailyn relief work tiny cacti and clips Barry lagging a splendid gilt Spode handle and cokie frets on the overselling. Dobson tried to present his find to an art gallery somewhere on the hard unyielding banks of a river in Yukon country, but he was chased away by burly men with bludgeoned and was lucky to escape with his life. He subsequently wrote up the episode in his pamphlet, chuckle some fripperies from my notebooks lavinda series.

Of course, those were made up fact. But this next bit completely unrelated. Another chuckles and frippery, but this time it's true. For many years, I believed that the most startling open opening line in theater was when boo boo says mad in Alfred Jerry's, ooh boo. Ah, but no, it's not. Isn't this a great opening line? Aldi bought on toe fasco fornia were left you Crone on hot on Folgers. Isn't that great? Those are the opening words from Henry Kerry's play, Crone on hot on follow Gus or follow just spoken by rigden funny dos. The plate is not unlike Uber in the title characters a greedy bad tempered and violent king. The final scene leaves the stage littered with corpses. This memorable line will give you some idea. Oh horrid, horrible and horridest horror. Our King our general our cook our doctor all dead stone dead, irrevocably dead. Oh, all grown a tragedy grown. The play also includes my favorite musical direction, which is as follows seen a bed chamber, Crone on hot on falling asleep. Rough music there's salt boxes and rolling pins, grid irons and tongs, sound gilders horns, marrow bones and cleavers etc. He wakes Henry Carey circa 1687 to 1743 also wrote among much else the words to God save the king or God Save the Queen. crown on hot orthologous was so popular in its day that the title entered the language as a synonym for furious, violent, demanding and self centered sounds just like part booboo. And it appeared in earlier editions of Roget's thesaurus, but it appears never to have made it into the OED

later on in the program, and now that I've gone off into into old, old works, I will dramatic works. I thought I'd read a series of quotations from other writers. Always Why some fun and also very useful when I haven't written lots of new things recently. But first, here's a piece called Hoon, hang boom, bang, bang tap, tap, tap, clunk tippity tap, tap, tap clunk Oh huning boom BANG BANG a pudding basin haircut on the truck tour man. a goat in distress in a faraway place. pins and needles and rigorous thought. Hoon hing boom, bang, bang. When you fall from a tree you've been climbing and your headache is thumping, thump, thump. And a pig has a snout and a tail, and there's leakage and victims and loss. how you're going to decide the right time to set fire to everything that has to reset fire to food and shelter and clothing. 1000s of seaside resorts Celine Dion's autograph Lake Winnipeg, and that putting bass and haircut on the truck tour man, his father's gaze and his mother's tongue. His brother's axe and his sisters stick his daughter's Bell and his other daughters Bell as well. Both the bells charming away. Oh Hoon hing tap tap tap. Hoon, hang clunk Tap, tap tap clunk clunk hooning boom, bang a bang. I went to oswestry and I went to dawlish, I took my library books back. Gigantic screeching vultures scraped across the sky, and the sky was blue. And the library sat on a hill near a lake, that legendary drained lake where they found the big white bones of something that they did not know had ever lived. They drew around the bones with chalk and then they took the bones away. They were big and wide and boxed in crates and tap tap tap tippity tap clunk clunk. Hi there.

That was me in all my glory, tap clunk. Boom, bang, bang.

Now, as promised, some quotations, fairly random, picked simply because I like them. The first is from Norton, the first the emperor of the United States. Some listeners may know of him he lived in San Francisco. I think he was originally English, but he just declared himself the emperor of the United States and issued many decrees and the citizens of San Francisco to their credit, basically, fed and clothed him and treated him Imperioli. Anyway, one of the things Northen the first said was, and I think this is well worth remembering. I could argue all day about the significance of facing Eastern religious rituals. But a clean table is a clean table. This is the next is not so much a quotation really. It's just a fact a little fact, about Sir Isaac Newton. In 1689. Newton was elected member of parliament for Cambridge University. He held the post for just one year, during which time he spoke in Parliament only once when he asked someone to close the windows as he could feel a draft

This is from a book called former todavia by anonymous, in which anonymous writes, the other case as related by events Phaeton, in his commentaries upon boerhaave is that of a learned man who had studied till he fancied his legs to be a glass, in consequence of which he does not attempt to stir, but was constantly under anxiety about them. His made bringing one day some wood to the fire, threw it carelessly down, and was severely reprimanded by her master, who was terrified, not a little for his legs of glass. For certainly wench out of all patients with his mid grins, as she called them, gave him a blow with a log upon the parts affected, which so enraged him that he instantly rose up, and from that moment, recovered the use of his legs. So if you think your legs are made of glass, that's one way of dealing with it. Harold Nicholson now from a book or an essay entitled men's clothes. It is related of Mr. Herbert Spencer, that he possessed a suit which had been specially made for him. He only wore this suit when he was feeling irritable, but he sometimes wore it for weeks at a time. And perhaps we'll have some more quotations later on. But finally, for this little section, one of Pascal's Ponce's from 1657 and one which I think series we think is extremely wise. Pascal said, all the misfortunes of people derived from one single thing, and that is their inability to sit still in a room.

There was a man named gervaise birdly president at that time in New coxeter. He hails originally from Helsinki, where his parents used to polish shields with old rags. Bird lip had lived for many years in a caravan on the outskirts of Helsinki. It was a dilapidated caravan. Nobody knew why he had moved to utakata nobody knew whether or not his papers were in order. Nobody knew for how many years he had been alive on this terrifying and yet miraculous planet. Nobody knew why his teapot leaked. Nobody knew why his left shoulder blade was emblazoned with a magnificent tattoo of a cormorant. Nobody knew why his gas bills were so preposterous. Nobody knew that he was ashamed of his clubfoot. Nobody knew that he sculpt about in the orchard. Nobody knew what he kept in that mysterious iron pail. Nobody knew the angle of his hat. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. It's a sad story.

Some more quotations. Now, from Christopher Plummer to Dennis plimmer. Dennis plimmer was the author of a story excitingly entitled man from the wrong time track. Sounds like sting. Which reminds me, my favorite sting quotation is Well, a quotation about steam really from from my friend Max shonai, who was on the show just a few weeks ago. Max has often been known to exclaim Oh Sting, where is thy death? Anyway, um, this is from Dennis polymers man from the wrong time track. You say he mused, that Mach came from some land once ravaged by war, in which for 500 years literacy had been a monopoly of the priesthood in which the inhabitants lived in stone huts, and that they were unfamiliar with bow ties. thrilling a and Roddy Doyle, the Irish writer, already right, commitment, something like that written various things. Anyway, he had the gall to say that he thought that Ulysses by James Joyce was, was too long and could have done with a good editor. Just a fairly preposterous thing to say. But if you're going to criticize Ulysses, at least do it. Well. Here are two comments on Ulysses that were made when it was first published. The teachers World Magazine called it an immense mass of clotted nonsense. And the sphere magazine wrote the maddest. muddiest most remote some books issued in our own or any other time, in artistic, incoherent, unquote ugly, nasty, a book that one would have thought could only emanate from a criminal lunatic asylum. That's the kind of write up you want, isn't it? And onto more spiritual things since Bernard of clairvaux, medieval monk and holy man, great Christian, and some Bernard of clairvaux wrote, a man fond of jugglers will soon enough, possess a wife whose name is poverty. If it happens, that the tricks of jugglers are forced upon your notice, endeavor to avoid them, and think of other things. So next time you see a juggler, you know what to do. And I have read this quotation many a time before but it's so great. I'm going to read it again. This is from the thing that dined on death by john H. Knox, who wrote, it was marrow dark, the fashionable radio astrologer, whose name was on every woman's tongue. slayed had seen him often passing through the village in his big foreign made car with his jaded and debauch companions, on whose neurotic faces slades I had read the imprint of sickening abnormalities did the Audrey's which was said to go on in Mero darks House have any bearing on these best deal atrocities slayed plotted back to his car. His brain was a whirling chaos.
