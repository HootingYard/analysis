Thank you for that delightful announcement. JOHN. This is indeed Frank key with hooting Yod on the air. No Dobson, or Blodgett and possibly no Jesuits at all this week. And if I sound a little breathless, it's because well, hooting out on the air, as you know, is a live experience. And I've just sprinted here to get here on time. Actually, sprinters probably exaggerating, but moved slightly faster than I normally do. This week and next week, hooting out on the air is a special edition in which I'm going to be reading a very old story so old, such an old story that as far as I can recall, Margaret Thatcher was still the Prime Minister when this was written. So that takes you back a bit. Younger listeners may not remember who I'm talking about and lucky for you. And this is called the reason it's gonna it's too long to be read in one. One shot. I think I'll see how far along we get today.

Unknown Speaker  01:22
Anyway,

Unknown Speaker  01:23
this is House of terps chapter one. If you drew a straight line between hooting yard and barges spinny, and your pen wobbled slightly around the halfway mark. You might with a bit of luck hit the spot on the map where a century ago, Slava, Dan karpin, planted a wooden flagpole in the sod and tied to it a rudimentary cotton wind sock. In itself, this was an unremarkable act. It was after all, a century for wind socks, hailstone detectors, Thunderbolt spindles, crampons, tare and lit and wheeled enormities what once had been a barren tract, overgrown with knots of furs, Bracken and scrog, was now the stamping ground of a collection of fanatical experimenters, each with a vision of incandescent truth. Why this mob of boffins have chosen so I'm promising a sight for the blooming of their delusions is far from clear. Although the proximity of hoons purple hills with their legendary aura may well be pertinent. Whatever the reason might be, each of these palatial trousered halfwits had arrived independently at this place of downpour and dizzy were chewed, scouring the landscape for the opportunities to test their Madcap theories. On a stroll across the land, the innocent observer would be beset by visions, both arcane and incomprehensible. amount of boulders died brilliant, both surrounded by wisps of gossamer nailed to charge twigs and branches. The hole topped by a shallow basin into which would be dripped minute quantities of medicinal liquids and gooey ointments. passing a half mile further on, our traveler would find rising ferociously from the ground as if the very mud had spawned it and impossibly intricate contraction of leavers, winches, spigots, pulleys and other gubbins designed to uproot the tiniest specks of foliage and send them hurtling through the air into a massive pit, the walls of which were lined with battered gold plate on which had been engraved selected verses from Leviticus another half mile, and are baffled Rambler would be forced to negotiate a series of shallow trenches dug according to a scheme of Mad complexity, each one having implanted in it, a lozenge of goals, smeared with a foul undo and paste, capable of conducting electricity, the whole system of trenches and lozenges transforming the area into a gigantic electric battery, powering an engine hidden inside a ramshackle half the batteries core. The purpose of the engine would presumably become apparent when it's invented deigned to unleash its demonic power. Surrounded by these fearsome contraptions karpin cotton wind sock, raised proudly aloft appeared as little more than a sign of its creators poverty of imagination. Yet truth sat hunched and fretting just over there right over the horror Rising. Can we doubt that karpin was well aware of the ramifications of his simple deed? Yes, we can, we must.

House of terps chapter two is when was hidden by a poultice of his own recipe. For years he had been preoccupied with the task of creating a universal poultice applicable to all Wen's, Boyles souls, cysts, Fern angles and blebs. The standard mustard plaster was to him a wretched thing, and he was determined to improve upon it. In his late teens, while apprenticed to a rust scraping factory, he became obsessed with a future vision of apothecary shelves groaning under the weight of jar upon jar of his magnificent invention. terpenes improved curative bandage paste. During the long tormented hours he spent in the factory cellar, scraping up patches of rust with a variety of huge utensils. These dreams came crowding into his head until there was room for little else. In his leisure hours, he brewed up numberless pot falls of disgusting concoctions. The early recipes were undistinguished although the germ of karpin related genius was present. He sought out rare and unlikely ingredients refining, refining, until there was hardly any matter, vegetable or mineral to be found in the village of aq, a sample of which had not been boiled to a paste in karpin huge iron pot. Yet he was dissatisfied. Two decades had passed since first this mania had beset him, but all he had to show for it was a mountain of pails filled with the discarded results of over 10,000 experiments. despite warnings of Ruin and doom from his family, karpin left the employ of the rust scraping factory, and with his meager savings, enrolled for a chemistry course at the University of ik. In retrospect, we must be thankful that he ignored the frenzied bit wailings of his kinfolk for it was at ik that the Kirpan of history was born. He proved to be the most brilliant student the university had ever taught. Day and night he toiled at his studies. And there's a gap in the text at this point several pages of or not a gap in the text, but a gap in my reading. There's several pages of scientific gibberish and mumbo jumbo, providing a sort of comprehensive outline of his studies. listeners who really want the details can just consult any standard chemistry textbook of the period and was awarded his final degree at the age of 53. As was the customer Eric, he squatted on his haunches, a top of podium hewn from base old flags and pennants were dangled about his head, and from time to time, after a verbal prod from the project, or karpin, would snatch up one of the pennants in his teeth, and Nash at it with gumption. The role of honor was then read and one by one, the graduates drew themselves up right, leaped down from their podia and prostrated themselves before the vice prime elect or in abundance, who lashed the certificates have confirmed to their bodices with frayed ribbons. Slava, Dan karpin, the man who had entered ik, dismal and jaundiced was now a doctor of chemistry. He had had half his teeth extracted two years before.

Unknown Speaker  09:26
At first, the doctorate seemed to be a curse. So indefatigable was karpin in his search for an omnipotent poultice that the years of study the widened intellectual horizons had done nothing to divert him from his chosen course. On the contrary, his mania had intensified. But where before he would have been content to muck about with orris, root and be barage. Now he sought to synthesize ever more preposterous substances, weird rare things, not easily found. In his usual homes, seeking finance from anyone who would listen karpin set out on a mad Odyssey. In his rucksack he carried retorts, Bunsen burners, test tubes, Rebs Olympics and hellebore cramps. he strode across opulent landscapes, hardly aware where he was going. Every so often some thrilling blob would cause him to hold, unpack his rucksack and carry out a variety of ludicrous experiments. It was a harsh existence, and wracked as he was by hunger and exhaustion. karpin became a physical wreck. He found solace However, in the fact that his piteous frame erupted in enough sores, winds and blebs to make him his own best guinea pig. All the while, he filled countless notebooks with the details of his experiments, taking off different substances as he wrenched the curative properties from them. Devil starch quack jelly Tasmanian goo spent bales for ad and then he was beckoned by the Arctic

Unknown Speaker  12:10
House of terps chapter three. In his diary karpin gave the following account of his first weeks in the Arctic. At Stavanger, I came upon a man who sold me a curious garment, which he claimed would protect me from the icy cold. It appeared to be made out of wood. Although I cannot be certain there was a springiness about it, which is alien to most if not all of the wood I have come across in my time. It also appeared to be rather thin for a piece of protective clothing. I handed my rucksack to this rum fellow, who seemed to spit whenever he spoke. Not only spit, mind you, but let fly a gobbets directly at my tremendous hairstyle. I digress, handing my rucksack to him as I say I clambered into this wooden overall, he demonstrated to me how to wedge my knees in the cramped jointed sections of the legs. And similarly how to adjust the purchase in the arms by twiddling a small metal flange located at either elbow. The hood came separately from the rest of the outfit, and was fixed in place by a devilishly complicated mechanism which locked and jam as soon as I had done it, I have yet to discover how to dislodge it lurching to one side to aspire my Norwegian friend through the narrow slit provided for vision. I took my rucksack back from him and rummage through one of the pockets for money. I was dismayed to note that I had only just enough cash left to buy this suit, and to pay a jolly jack tar to provide my passage northward. However, there was no time to waste, pressing some grubby coins into the man's hand, I bade him farewell and wheeling myself about turn causing my skeleton no little agony, I set off for the docks. Before I had gone 10 paces, I realized that it would be easier to carry my rucksack if I merely nailed it to my suit, chest level on my left side. Once again, I will about and headed for the Smithy shed I had noticed earlier, I will surely find out hammer and nails there. To my surprise, the man who looks up at me from his Advil was an old colleague of mine from Eric, we had studied latent phosphorescence together and burned dogs of clay. He did not recognize me in case as I was in wood, I blurted out a greeting to which he did not react. I had not realized that my suit was heavily soundproof. And then if I wish to make myself heard, I had to screech at the top of my voice. An old man's lungs are not designed for such exertion. And I have had much need of soothing linctus in the weeks since I donned this apparel. But as I say, I did not realize immediately that my wooden cocoon was loath to admit sound, and I'm afraid that I interpreted my erstwhile colleagues bewilderment as evidence of Cretan eyes ation. In patient to be away, I held myself to a hammer and some nails and rammed the rucksack home, rather to energetically as it happened, since I managed to inflict a lesion in the flesh of my left upper torso, which still gives me some grip as I write. When I have worked out how to extricate myself from this warming wouldn't affair, I must apply some experimental policies. 10 hours later, I arrived at the docks and met Enrico over the last few months I have come to know him as well as I have ever known any of my fellow creatures. In another age, perhaps they would have made a saint of him. He seems to be imbued with the sort of innocent goodness one associated with congenital idiots, and yet he has a first class intellect. He has a steady command of 16 languages 11 of which I find utterly incomprehensible. Some of them seem to consist mostly of coughs, groans, and a kind of strangulated choking, which vote on attractive is enough to wake the dead, and has saved my bacon on more than one occasion. ringing out ghastly warnings at the approach of nameless terrors in the darkness, which otherwise would have fallen upon me and torn out my throat or somesuch macabre business also Enrico tells me at any rate, splendid fellow in this icy nothing world. He has become my ears and eyes, my voice, my guide and helping hand were it not for him? I do not know how I would cope in this godforsaken place.

Unknown Speaker  17:09
In the evenings we sit hunched over the campfires, which Enrico sets with such elegance from the most surprising materials. Never in all my years have I met another man able to transform a handful of slush into a raging inferno in under a minute. So naturally does this ability come to him that he greets my astonished inquiries with a sort of superior distain. We have had many interesting chats, sat around the fire, and Rico belching and drooling in four or five languages simultaneously. I have learned to await the most pertinent points in his discourse to interject with a barrage of ferocious shouting. If I spoke any lower, my friend would not hear a word I said from inside my wooden world. And although my throat is read roar from the effort, I do not wish to deprive and Rico of the benefits of convivial discussion and debate. We have arranged over all sorts of subjects, and though I fear at times that Enrico is something of a cynic, he has a plentiful store of anecdotes, which are both entertaining and instructive. I realize now how little I knew of life in a Norwegian dockyard.

House of tubs chapter four. I hope you're enjoying this. I certainly am reading something that was written so long ago. Where was I? I told you it was live. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:22
Yes. House of terps chapter four. It was not until he reached that barren stretch of ice known as van globs land that karpin realized he was alone. All along, and Rico had been a figment spawned by his feverish brain. It is a testament to his implacability that once this truth had dawned on him, he was undaunted and trudged ever Northwood with renewed energy. And knothole in the right leg of his gob caused a small patch of frostbite to way lay his ankle, but this only increased sense of urgency. He had developed an intricate method of applying test pulses to his wood encased body by feeding them in through the mouth slit and then shimmying and wiggling in a precisely coordinated manner until the pulses reached the required area. Thus sandwich between his skin and the wood. The pulses could be gently tapped into place in order to pack snugly against his flesh. extricating the test pieces was another matter, and the dreadful difficulty of doing so led Kirpan to invent and evaporating pulses by harnessing the illegible properties of some vermillion crystals he had discovered wedged in a crevasse. One day, while bent over his crucible mucking about with shards of tahj karpin was astonished to hear footsteps behind him, spinning around as fast as his wouldn't suit would allow. He was confronted by an enormous creature, almost twice his height, burbling, incomprehensible noises which sounded at once like the tinkling of glass and the hooting of a fog home. It had appeared as if from nowhere, his brain pulsating karpin wondered momentarily if this proposal is being was another product of his febrile imagining another and Rico. And yet, as it continued to burble tinkling hooting, the truth of its corporate lack corporately ality became evident. Adjusting his elbow flange karpin held out his hand in greeting. The Beast was silent for a moment, then 12 wisps of cold blue fragrance around copings body beckoning him to follow. It turned on what could only be roughly be called it heel and waddled away. hastily shoving his crucible and Todd shards into the rucksack karpin set off in pursuit. The creature stayed well ahead of him, but once he had hit his stride, karpin was able to make a rudimentary study of its main features. It was a sort of cross between a penguin, an ape and a trout, huge matted with rougher its head and neck covered in silvery scales and strange black ringlets. One arm tapered to a thin or flap, while the other was thick and hairy, and ended in an almost humanoid hand. As it wobbled onward its massive bushy tail thumped along the ground behind it, sending up flurries of thin snow, which settling covered its tracks. It was the most asymmetrical beast karpin had ever seen. And yet he was aware of a tremendous feeling of kinship with it. After all, it was the first life form he had come upon in 18, lonely month in the Arctic, and its presence overwhelmed him, he scurried after it with almost slavish eagerness. Two weeks later, having trekked across the featureless expanse, the beast with its human acolyte in tow, arrived at a gaping pit, turning to face curbing the ludicrous creature tinkled and hooted, then suddenly hurled itself over the edge into the icy more. The great chemist had no idea how to react, peering over the rim, he could see nothing at all, nor did any sound issue forth from below. The compass nailed to his wrist was broken, so he was unable to ascertain whether or not he had reached the pole. Once again alone in the vastness karpin hummed his favorite him. Then, with a certainly certainty born only of dementia, he threw himself after the beast into the pit. As he plummeted, his very being was invaded by bit and fromage, and then he lost consciousness.

elsif terps chapter five introductory note. Chapter five is extracted from a bucket of wisdom by mod firebrand. The text which we'll follow is self explanatory, but it's worth taking the opportunity here to retail a brief anecdote concerning Dr. firebrand which is unpublished elsewhere. It said that during her first year as a lecturer at the University of Van globs land, Dr. firebrand was piloting her biplane over the icy wastes when she was forced to crash land in pretty sticky circumstances. marooned in this frozen hell, her chances of survival was slide. For provisions. She had only a packet of boiled sweets and a flask of sour cocoa. resourceful as ever, the plucky ethnologist injected her faithful Husky, Desmond, with a hot dose of helium. Not so much that it exploded, but enough for it to float balloon like over the ice until it came into land on the ramshackle tin roof of the university volleyball court. From there, Desmond scampered hotfoot to the Medical Center, where he interrupted a three way wrestling match between Dr. bilge Dr. grudge and Dr. strabismus. The contest had been occasioned by the use of some choice language of the gutter by Doctor bilge during an astounding and dangerous operation to remove the inflamed upper frac from an elderly doyen of the van gloves land pole vaulting club, the patient bore an uncanny resemblance to the film actor bill purge. He have the brilliant team blocks and puckish errs, Dr. Build remonstrated with the patient screeching and blaspheming and was bundled out of the operating theater by his colleagues who leaving the inflamed upper frac throbbing venomously on aside Crowley proceeded to bash Dr. belch, about the head with a variety of surgical equipment. So it was that a fortnight later, Dr. Build sought satisfaction by challenging his tormentors to a three way wrestling match, announcing that he would fight the pair of them assemble taneous Lee he was on the brink of a veritable pounding when Dr. firebrands trustee pooch, Desmond, howling like a demon entered the fray and brought the fight to an immediate halt. Dealing build review hefty blows to the head. graduand strabismus carried over to the feisty hound and expelling the last remnants of helium from its body scanned the message scrawled on a yogurt carton tied around its neck, shoving a dish of bone meal under the dog's snout. The two doctors scrambled their airplane and flew off to rescue dr firebrand, making use of the map reference points given in the scroll message. They found her half buried in the snow sucking one of her boiled sweets and monstrously unperturbed. Later swooping in over the campus. There mercy dash completed, the airborne doctors were amazed to see Dr. Build standing on the roof of the university turnip warehouse, armed to the teeth with a blunderbuss and a sack of hay. Whatever demented scheme he had in mind was swiftly a noun. However, all of a sudden, an enormous enville plummeted from the heavens, crashing straight on his skull, and propelling him through the roof and through the topmost layer of a mountain of turnips. And so he expired, mashed in among the vegetable he had adored since boyhood. But let us not dwell on his atrocious fate. All calls itself human was hateful to him. We must proceed with the promised extract from Dr. firebrands seminal pop array, a bucket of wisdom. And as I said, that's the introductory note to chapter five of House of turret. Chapter five, followed by six, seven and eight will follow in hooting out on the next week. That's the end of the show for this week. One brief note, I think I should point out that just in that last piece, there was a sentence or phrase where I talked about the message scrawled on a yogurt carton tied around his neck. I'd like to apologize for that. And we all know of course that the correct pronunciation of the word is your hort, not yogurt to your heart. Do remember that next time you're in your grocery. That's the end of the show. I do hope you've enjoyed it. Tune in again next week. Bye bye.
