Last week I read the first half of a story called House of terps. What happened was that we met the the main figure slobber Dan karpin learned that he studied chemistry, went to the Arctic, followed a misshapen beast across the icy wastes and plummeted down a pit after it. The beginning of chapter five is it takes us away from the main story into an extract a historical extract from mod firebrands book a bucket of wisdom. And that's where we take up the story now with trap House of terps chapter five. And the name of that place was hoon. And at that time, Hoon was plagued by bores shelled rakes, and enormous moth like beings which emitted jets of gaseous yellow poison. The townsfolk were in a state of terror. All attempts to read Hoon of the beasts which beset it had met with failure. At San Jose and 13 of the citizens declared that Hoon held no hope for them, and they packed up their belongings bade farewell to their neighbors and left Hoon forever they're not names were recorded in a ledger by the town get.

Unknown Speaker  06:17
Are you is this exciting?

Unknown Speaker  06:18
I'm excited reading it. It's that kind of story. Anyway, House of terps chapter six karpin said but why do you wear such an outlandish costume to the innocent I you appear like some misshapen beasts spawned in the laboratory of a maniac yet here we sit in ridiculously comfortable armchairs, sipping glasses of port. I am bewildered. Maude Hargreaves said, I can imagine how you feel. This sort of thing has happened before. 20 years ago, our little settlement had the pleasure to welcome another loan visitor. He was an unkempt, bubble bearded Professor with a passion for cocoa. He nearly drank us dry. I remember we had to replace all the spindles on the mulching engine while he was here. I found him very difficult to fathom. He was not a happy man. On the day we foisted the chieftainship upon him. He flew into a rage. He slobbered and stamped his feet. I took him into the Flamingo tend to calm him down, only for him to berate me in a series of verses sung in a grating wine. Mud had to be wedged into his mouth in order to silence him. Whoa, whoa, whoa. But since he met his end, we have had no more visitors and therefore no chieftain. Your arrival among us is most welcome Slava. Dan. Slobodan karpin said, little did I know when I held myself after you into that gaping pit, that I was entering a vast subterranean network of chambers, caverns and tunnels that our whole society existed beneath the frozen wastes. But now that I'm here, it seems perfectly reasonable that you should dub me your chieftain. After all, my scientific genius knows no bounds. I can only hope that your faith in me will be repaid. mod Oh Hargreaves, said slobbered. And I don't think you understand. Your scientific abilities have nothing to do with your chieftainship The mere fact that you come from the outside world is enough. any old harebrained gift wandering aimlessly about the Arctic would have served as well. I don't mean to disparage your scientific gifts. I simply don't care about them. normally find anyone here who does. We need a stranger to become our chieftain in order to carry out a demented and violent ritual. You see 300 years ago when our ancestors the 12 exiles of Hoon first settled here, their brains had been ravaged by their massive consumption of pragmatic leaves. As a result, whenever outsiders come among us, we install them as chieftain for student them with plumage cake their hair with Garmin tauchen ambergris. deafen them with a name chanting. praise them. Have them cascading jalopies over imaginary sand dunes and then put them to an unspeakably grisly death. Here, have another glass of this ruinously expensive port. Slobodan karpin said, I don't understand. To be quite frank, I failed to see the connection between your ancestors eating too much shrubbery and your desire to act in what strikes me as a highly uncivilized manner. mod. Oh Hargreaves said, huh? funnily enough, the cocoa swilling chap said the very same thing. There simply wasn't the time to explain it to him though. I've tried to give him a sort of Crash Course. We began with the basics. I showed him the valves of different ages attached to a block of wood and the tentacles bright red Saviola, propelled with such vigor and promptitude the size of Aristotle's lanton. Then I explained how the vagrant of a light shivering texture furnished with several arms attached to the mother stem like a branch was intended as an outlet for the product of digestion. Every specimen of resplendent purple globular appendage was pierced with holes. Milner and cask were invoked. The oblique notch on the tooth was large, thick, internally dilated, folded and with a semicircular horned operculum broken shells from broken seas. filamentous substances longitudinally Sal kated the edges of the base chlorinated absorbent burned portion by portion, but it was no use. Before we could progress to the more complicated material after chieftain was given his last cup of cocoa print and print in his finery, and had his head boiled. I can still hear his house ringing in my ears, or rather, ear

Unknown Speaker  11:13
slobbered Slava, Diane karpin said, but this is preposterous. What makes you think I'll submit to this barbarism. Mordo Hargreaves said, It is written on the day of Curlew. Most, the ritual must take place. And so it shall, until that day, you're free to do as you wish. It's only forbidden that you should leave here. Not that you'd ever be able to discover an exit. Slava, Dan karpin said, why not? More, oh Hargreaves said, Because slobber Damn, there is no exit. Slava Dan karpin said. Crikey the canopy, press Ctrl Shift repeatedly to capture the goat tranche. 11 to avoid the bees hold down all the numeric keys and move your avatar to the square beside the pillows. tranche. Slight technical error bear with us. That's the great thing about live shows on resonance you never know what's going to happen next. Anyway, onwards with House of terps chapter seven. What a terrible predicament. How on earth did karpin escape? What Wiles did he employed to evade the clutches of these subterranean devils? Was it really necessary for him to dye his head a shade of lavender, and to stand in elegantly upon one leg, chewing on the pips of a blood orange? Where had he acquired the blood orange? Was it fresh? If so, through what conduit had its found its way to a community living hundreds of feet below the Arctic ice. If such a conduit existed, could karpin not take advantage of it? If fresh fruit and in all likelihood veget vegetables could travel one way, surely it would be possible for Kirpan to travel the other way out of his prison away from certain death beyond the reaches of the macabre hooded figure whose ritual task was to boil Caribbean's head. How could kerpen discover what he needed to know? What did karpin need to know? Would it do to have only a vague idea of what was going on? Or would it be necessary for him to amass a copious body of information on sites, routes, timetables, sheduled, inventories, tallies and registers what he needed gathered here? How much time would he need in order to gather all the necessary information? Where could he begin? Could kerbin bribe the surly snag tooth varlet whose job it was to monitor his every move? With what could the wrench be bribed? With a packet of boiled sweets suffice? was the man partial to linseed oil? Did he own a pencil case? Did karpin still have his pencil case? Anyway, what had happened to his rucksack was his mind failing. Why did his brain throb so How long have they been in this place? Why did the refreshments with which they plied him tastes so strange. With what infusion? Was he being poisoned? Was he being poisoned? Was this an awful preliminary test execution? Why had they removed the aglets from his shoe laces? aglets are the little plastic bits on the end of your laces? That's the technical term.

Unknown Speaker  15:29
Why have they

Unknown Speaker  15:30
removed the aglets from his shoe laces? Why have they returned them? A few hours later, brightly gleaming as if they had been polished heartily with beeswax and formed over by our Wang Li smiling grudge. Had they been so polished? So formed over? Did it matter? Where was Kirby unable to get hold of the lavender dye? Why did he not arouse the suspicions of his captors? Or did he did they only pretend to see nothing suspicious when he absented himself for four hours from the potato gala? Were they in fact conniving against him all the time, lulling him into a false sense of security, allowing him access to the dye buckets, the blood oranges and the Flamingo tents in order to mislead him? Was he barking up the wrong scent? Had he been thrown off the alley? Was he being led up a blind tree was walled what mattered had his hair been shown? Could corncrakes take shape, shimmering in his fancy blue and blurred, baleful woozy creaking. By took out the rest of his teeth. They fed him slops. They smeared new guard on his forehead and line in his path. He was shown engravings of great deeds, strange creatures, fearsome engines, hideous disasters, fibs and lies, lies and fibs. Rain flashed on his head and the water in his cup turned to ice. The clanging of bells announced is coming, but his ears were stuffed with putty and he heard them not. Then the word goes broke. It made a dreadful sound karpin had he known it would have been thankful for his party. The word go intoned a monstrous litany, its assistant screeching out the provenance of each verse, while the word go drew breath. The word goes mask shocked because it spilled forth it awful words, reading from a completely incomprehensible manuscript on earth that morning from an iron chest sprinkled with vinegar and drew lip, ceremonially chewed at the edges stained with smoke. When at last the word go ceased, drapes were pulled around Kirpan and death stole upon him with Southern ferocity. After the requisite period of mourning for the dead chieftain, the ritual ran its course, the chambers he had inhabited during his brief stay among the people was sealed off huge titanium port calluses barring the doors, they would remain in place for 40 years. If another chieftain came among them. within that time, other chambers would be found less well appointed smaller and smellier perhaps, but adequate, no chieftain had yet lasted more than a fortnight before being executed. Once the port calluses were in place, every single churn in the community was used for making the butter of grievance flags were burned. Toy socks were given to all the children with an inky likeness of the word goes mask stamped upon them. Somehow, one of the Sox found its way into Kirby's rucksack. And the rucksack instead of being placed on the pyre, along with every other trace of his existence, was accidentally lodged in a crevasse by Mordo Hargreaves on her next incognito mission to the surface, many months later. Accidentally, it seems doubtful, but they're the rucksack lay frozen a time capsule awaiting discovery.

Unknown Speaker  20:20
And now, finally House of terps chapter eight, the last and final chapter. Apparently, there were two slobber down karpin flourishing at the same period, where you followed the career of the so called chemist chieftain, the legendary figure whose rucksack was discovered in a crevasse by last touts expedition party in 1907. town himself pieced together the known facts of Kirby's life, and it is upon his work that the proceeding prose has been based. There has to be said that much of the detail of karpin last days, including the supposed diary entry is pure conjecture. In the Welcome to the Drudge talc apologist gravel slobber, casts an intriguing light on his intuitive biographical methods. I quote, faced with seemingly insurmountable hurdles to his narrative, ie utter lack of evidence, uncorroborated anecdotes, etc, etc. Towel could always follow the same procedures. Rising at dawn, he would armed himself with a high velocity rifle and set out for the malls, spending the morning letting off a dozen rounds of ammunition to spectacularly small effect. He was once known to bag a muskrat, but later admitted that it was half dead when he found it. Returning by way of a hostelry town could drink innumerable pints of stout and chew on a hunk of black bread. belching and reeling, he would stagger home bolt fast the doors of his study, and at once set about scrawling whatever pitiful nonsense came into his head, writing with a cheap borrow on massive sheets of bleach newspaper. These semi spontaneous cracklings would be revised in the calm of the evening by sludge is factotum using a variety of dictionaries, encyclopedias, three weeks and lexicons. On a number of occasions, more conventional scholars have covered some of taupes ground and his in Juba, tably, stupid working methods were found to be surprisingly effective. For example, He correctly guessed the reasons for build groose pumice mania, which Mac and gubbins were able to corroborate in their posthumous study, talc cannot have had access to the archive. And even if he had, his command of Flemish was never up too much finish was another matter. That's the end of the quotation from gravels slobber. slobber is generous in his assessment, but in the absence of any other material, we have to give talc the benefit of the doubt. He did after all, discover kerbin rucksack wedged in an Arctic kvass. In his book he gives the precise map reference. In 1913, talc held an exhibition in which he claimed that the entire contents of the rucksack were on show. Sure enough, the catalog lists all of copings ludicrous aquapark and many little bags of rotted matter once presumably samples to be used in poultice manufacturer and there is mentioned to a various notebooks and diaries. tantalizing indeed, though not a living soul recall seeing them and no trace of them has ever been found. Of course, we know that malefactors ransacked tax country pile a week after his death. But would they have taken old papers yellowing, Ledger's crumbling notebooks all the evidence suggests that they were mentally defective opportunists whose loot consisted only of three source bins, a tray of worms, and some grit. For coping, then we must rely on talc. To date his drunken ramblings are all we have. Even the earlier period of Kirby's life has been covered over by history with a shroud of neglect. Wherever we turn, his life seems to have been raised. records have been lost or burned, or half eaten by grubs and mildew. All those who knew him and they were not many a long dead, and they have left nothing but dust and Ashes, ashes and dust. So our knowledge of Kirpan is touted Knowledge and talc to his in his tomb. Sadly, even less is known about the other slobber down karpin, the one we encountered at the beginning implanting a wooden flagpole in the sword.

Unknown Speaker  25:16
Indeed, we know nothing of him at all save for that one solitary act. Our source in this case is the hooting yard Gazette for the 14th of January 1894, which carried a small paragraph on an inside page mentioning his deed thought worthy of note because the perpetrator had, quote, a lantern draw and a translucent yellow fog watch, unquote. But this is all we know of the other Kirpan. And it is only worth knowing because quite by chance, he planted his flag pole on the very spot where a year later the foundation stone was laid off the house of terps.

Unknown Speaker  26:49
Saudi Arabia you are that was two weeks worth of the House of terps. We've got a few minutes left of this week show. And I hadn't got I thought I thought that it would take a half hour so I'm kind of filling in with little bits and scraps. I just found this notebook and includes includes in it. horoscopes based on alternative cosmological astrological system derived from the work of then it's blank, and then it I've scribbled down six signs. fruit bat, tar, boosh, mayonnaise, klaxon slot, and Nixon. What can that mean? And also is the first draft here of a story featuring your old your old favor and mine, Ugo of Plovdiv. And it goes like this. In the Old Town of Plovdiv, ooh, go plopped his pod onto a stool. Who goes Mark said, ooh, go, why are you using a pod instead of a jar? Who goes Maher was blind, but she knew that the plot of egos pod was different to the plot of his jar. Omar said, ooh, go My job is in the shade. Who goes mob bashed who go on their head? Never leave your job in the shed. Ooh, go. She said. Sorry. Ma said, ooh, go. My power off. Put it there. Ah, said who goes ma on Friday lost in their hovel in the old town of Plovdiv. And I'll end the show with this is not by me it's an inscription on a grave in southern Cathedral. Here lochia lies in turd enough, his name speaks one has few competitors in fame. A name so great. So generals may scorn inscriptions which do vulgar tombs adorn a diminution. To write inverse has eulogies which most men's mouths rehearse his virtues and his pills are so well known that envy can't confine them under stone, but they'll survive his dust and not expire to all things else at the universal fire. This verse is lost his pills in bomb him safe to future times without an epitaph and lochia, who made pills and he died early. In 1672, at the age of 72, and that's all for this week. Bye bye
