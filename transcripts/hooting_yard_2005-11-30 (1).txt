Greetings listeners, this is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And as usual, I'm going to read to you for about half an hour. It might be a good idea to have pen and paper at hand. Not for any particular reason, but you might want to make little notes or jot down particularly illuminating passages, anything you like, really. So go and get your pen and paper. And I'll continue. I'm going to begin this week by talking to you about the novels of low thar preen. Those listeners who have heard of lowth are praying probably know him best as the extravagantly bouffant. ated musical conductor and impresario but he also wrote a series of novels, and we'll take them one by one. But we'll do it by coumarins 1950. Just 99 pages long, Lothar preens first novel is slim, even throwaway and was completely ignored by both reviewers and the reading public. It's a particularly hackneyed example of the looking for cormorants genre. For hero, paler Hornet, an anagram of the author's name is a young explorer charged by his father with going in search of cormorants. In a series of suppose journal entries, Hornet describes his failure in prose that is listless, turgid, and littered with innumerable misuses of the prepositions, by and with. Although he was characteristically contemptuous of his detractors, it is no surprise that lowth are praying waited nearly two decades to publish again. But when he did, what a revelation bamboozled by curlews 1968. unleashed upon the world at the height of laissez von the month of May 1968. Print second novel casts a glaring eye upon bourgeois society. By turns caustic, pitiless and scathing and superbly comic. preen lashes out at sacred cows and shibboleths in a manner described by one critic at the time as quote, like something written by the idiot bastard offspring of Ford Madox Ford and Veronica Lake during the final gasps of Stalinism. Unquote. At 1844 pages It is one of the longest novels of the 20th century. cunningly and preen can be the most artful of writers. This matchless stream of invective is disguised as a series of letters home from a peripatetic ornithologist engaged in a study of the nesting habits of the Curlew. preen uses the narrator's weightlessness myopia, an inability to tell one bird from another as a metaphor for a society in chains. an abridged version for children with four lovely color plates by preens acolyte marigold true, was issued in 1983 perplexed by starlings 1970 as if to confound those who saw him as a radical lowth are preens next book was a delicate miniaturists evocation of domesticity set in an idyllic barnyard full of countryside wisdom and buskey charm. It was condemned as trash, and rightly so. befuddled by linnets 1974. loathsome Ah, loathsome is the man whose flesh is the color of spinach, whose hat Spinks, who sharpens pencils by daylight, and whose nights are beset by dreams of Erie, our bino hands. Those the opening lines of prins fourth novel have been quoted so widely and so often that it comes as a shock to learn that they're absent from all but the very, very final draft of this majestic tour de force, which won the Groot, Pang, fledgling Garbo and musty spillage awards to name only a few for if I were to list honors lavished on this mighty tome. We would be here all day, and even you gentle listener, even you would begin to yawn and scratch your head, from which no doubt Beatles would fall

where in lies the peculiar genius of befuddled by linnets first glance, it's a simple tale. Indeed, the Korean critic Park no lip dismissed it as cretinous, although he later wrote a lengthy retraction before swallowing poison in the laundry room of a shabby hotel. His widow is imprisoned and his children languished in an orphanage, a point to ponder for those who dare to cross loath are praying. The novel divided into no less than 4000 short chapters, arranged alphabetically by opening lines, follows the progress of a would be scientist named pearl he Thorn or she trudges through various patches of woodland, listening out for the characteristic gg gg song of the limit. But Thorne is no ornithologist, she is an oceanographer with a sideline and amateur map making and trees also hard of hearing. According to notes, rescued from the charred shell of preens, so called potato building, where he lived and worked for nearly 30 years before it burned down in 1989. The character was originally intended to be profoundly deaf, and by the by one legged once again prayin appears to have made an incredible number of changes to the final draft, restoring not only some hearing to his heroine in her right ear, the left remains useless, but completely rewriting the long central section in which what appears to be a flock of cassowaries is yoked irreversibly to the heroines dismal fate. It is a moot point whether flock is the correct noun of assemblage for the category, but research must come to a stop somewhere, and I've now got a headache as you can imagine, you would too if you were to read all of lowth preens books at one sitting. Be that as it may, there's an unbearable poignancy in pearly thorns growing realization, that tree is unable to distinguish between the exquisite song of the linnet and the raucousness of crows, corncrakes, and all those other birds that make such a gruesome racket. preens adoption of a female narrative voice was much praised for its authenticity. All I have to say that for me, it's woefully unconvincing. I side with the anonymous reviewer who disparage the author's attempt to join the brothers Johnson in the land of ladies. At amusing reference to the American funk drew who had a measure of popularity in the 1970s. preen Of course, despised funk, as evidenced by his ferocious essay, thunderous executions of things, both abominable and ripe for obliteration, which I would willingly tear to smithereens with my bare hands cackling with obscene Glee as I did so 1977

discombobulated by more hens 1980s dismissed as worthless when published 30 years to the day after preens fictional debut, time has been kind to his fifth novel, written in the form of an instructional manual for children. It has all the trauma of a catechism mixed with the faintly sordid air of Bella POC pornography. It is also preens only foray into science fiction, unexpected departure to be sure, given that he clearly had no sympathy for not understanding of the genre. Yet somehow, the writing has a mischievousness, which made it Prinze most popular book. The more hands of the title Incidentally, only look like more hands, or at least what preen fondly imagined the more hands to look like. They are in fact a race of super ignorant beings from a dying planet in a distant galaxy. The author quotes freely from both epic taters and Gerard Manley Hopkins, though not to any apparent purpose nevertheless, Less, it's an entertaining enough romp and perfect holiday reading. flummoxed by owls 1981. Frankly, indigestible this monstrous work at 1748 pages, only a little shorter than bamboozled by curlews has divided its critics since that strange day at the end of March 1981, when it hit the bookshops, just as the news was announced of the death of DeWitt Wallace, the founder of the Reader's Digest, much blood has been spilled over the placing of the apostrophe in readers, not least Lothar preens throughout his life, the novelist was a fanatical devotee of the magazine. Regularly penning articles such as I am John's cardigan, and it pays to incite your witch doctor, none of which was ever published. Legend has it that there exists somewhere an archive of DeWitt Wallace his letters to his indomitable if unsolicited contributor, from the early polite rejections to the last desperate, please, insults and threats, loath are praying ignored all of them, firing off ill written dribbles of the magazine virtually every month for decades. We are perhaps fortunate that he kept copies of only a fraction of his output, and that the Reader's Digest consigned to every last scrap of it to the bonfire. When he heard of Wallace's death, praying locked himself in the potato building for a period of mourning, and refuse to appear in public to promote his new novel, about which I shall say only this, there is a mildly amusing paragraph on page 16. a superb neologism at the end of chapter 53 a strange pause Just then, and a misprint in the very last line. pastry of death 1983. Having turned his hand to science fiction, Lothar preen, unwisely decided to have a bash at a crime novel. surmising that all fictional detectives must have trademark idiosyncrasies or foibles, he made his Captain earn a plethora, a retired Jesuit whaling ships, Chaplin with a clubfoot, and a tattoo of a star on his forehead, whose hobbies included pole vaulting, testing for pH values, and repairing churns. In fact, so many pages are spent trying to elicit the readers interest in this preposterous figure that print quite forgets about his plot, which begins in incoherence, and Peters out into what I have elsewhere, dubbed grandiloquent stupidity, I repeat this remark on air despite the fact that when it first appeared in print, one of print trained brutes abducted me and nearly drowned me in an ornamental pond somewhere near blister line gasp gasworks

dumbstruck by bitterns 1988. By the late 1980s, as lowth are praying, the musician became ever more lauded. This was lest we forget the decade of the sonatina and variations on Mars are Ricardo montell ban, praying the novelist was considered largely a spent force. Not one of his books was still in print, and no publisher of repute would touch him. Indeed, it was only through his criminal connections in the taverns of marsay. That dumbstruck by bitterns ever saw the light of day. The eternal palace of literature must forever be grateful to the grimy pursuit matter lot, whose nefarious intrigues led to the meeting of lowth are preen and f x duggleby. It was duggleby, deranged, revolting, and crap eolus but also erudite, wealthy, and given to wearing particularly decisive cravats who became Prince champion, setting up his additions, the duggleby imprint to issue the now monarchial author's work. The first fruit of the partnership was this awe inspiring novel in which print creates an alternative history of 19th century Greenland. Those new to preme are invariably astonished at the facility. The lightness with which a straightforward story about a team of birds spotters on futile expedition to find bitterns above the Arctic Circle is transformed into a multi layered prose Fantasia of matchless genius. vivid and towering, it remains prins greatest achievement, and it's somehow fitting that all royalties he earned from it were used to fund a string of gambling dens in iniquitous ports and grubby harbors. confounded by guillemots 1990. to sail the sea is an occupation at once repulsive and attractive, wrote la Belloc. It's a sentiment with which lowth are preme concurred. The maritime world was one which informed so much of his music, yet his fiction remains stubbornly landlocked, until the sudden light glory of his ninth novel. Its conception we owe to duggleby the drink crazed billionaire Lord preen onto his crumbling wooden yacht and headed for the middle of one of the oceans. I'm not sure which one refusing to let the aging author ashore until he had written a tale of the sea. For the first three weeks preme cursed and soaked by turns, until he collapsed with a fever brought on by proximity to bilge water. Once recovered, he said to his task sitting at a worm eaten escrow terroir on the all up deck, lashed by tropical storms, or possibly icy gales depending upon which of the oceans it was. The result was this brief 102 page spine tingler in which guillemots confound the splattering pneumonia racked author unnerved by Rennes 1996 Lothar preens final work of fiction is unreadable self consciously experimental. It was written in the space of five hours on the upper deck of a bus plying the route between some godforsaken village full of priests and imbeciles, and the hot air balloon launch station that mustered power by now a cantankerous and bitter old man. Praying was estranged from duggleby and his tough sailor pals. Even the loyal marigold true was fed up to the back teeth with him. In a previously unpublished letter, written from her deathbed, true wrote, by then, ie the year of our Lord mc MXC VI, he was having constant pains. his brow had become ignoble and His hair was often rife with breadcrumbs. he lacked dash, I would place pots of soup in front of his cyclopean vazov, only to discover him hours later, wandering aimlessly around shops that sold or rented camping equipment. His blotchy flesh was blocked Tria still. He used to Creek when he brushed those ones glistening teeth. I had thought them superb long ago, those preen fangs. My star

This is called some ponds or hotel. The Holly hawks won some ponds. There are seven ponds, their names are brink, cramped, dribble, Lamont presumption, ravenous and unholy. In a lead box at the bottom of one of the ponds and Icelandic fun tune in Lies sealed against the elements, but which palmed the fun tune is made of some nameless metallic alloy, and it has a long history. Countless learned tones have been devoted to pondering its existence, location, significance, color smell, in controverted, bility and malevolence. Its value is incalculable. A facsimile made of petrified dough was sold by the museum and act on the vog for an undisclosed sum, the identity of the buyer was also undisclosed at the time. Now, this shadowy figure has the true fond tune almost in his clutches. He has booked into a hotel just 400 yards away from the palms. to a hotel, the major Damo the hotel stared out of the dining room window, the sky was overcast. Soon the drizzle would begin. It always did. He hooted once and once only. He was afraid of sheep, baffled by corkage continually muttering about the gasworks defined elegantly ragged, flat bubble during snowstorms, grotesquely carnivorous, helpless with starch, ignoble, just dying to shake hands with lion tamer, kept waiting for hours by guests late for breakfast. lascivious, yet hard of hearing, mistakenly shot at by poachers, nerve racked overcoated, pitiful, quite likely to Hoot for a second time, risibly be muffled, still awaiting a voyage around the world tempestuous every Thursday, unbelievably festooned with old sacking and netting vigilant week zero fellas despite the rain, young at heart, and zestful the prospect of his daily milk supplement. He hooted for a second time, much louder. The hotel was fully occupied. Among the guests were anthropomorphic beings, bauxite, miners, cartographers, dribbling thugs, elk fancies, fun tune hunters, genuflecting, dolts heroic chefs, edea savon jugglers, kailyn quarry workers, lopsided people, marionettes, nautical commandments, old besmirched grave diggers, cons draggers, quicklime spreaders, ruffians, sink, bashes taloned, maniacs, untidy throwbacks, vinegar brewers wax and image igniters xylophone construction experts, yellow bellied burglars and zinc inspectors watching them all gobbling down there breakfast porridge, the major Domo tried to work out who was who? There appeared to be some trouble at one of the tables in the far corner. An aged couple rattled and with frenzied gleams in their eyes, were raising their voices at a palette and neurasthenic get still wearing his night shirt. This man was Richard Widmark implacable seeker of the Icelandic fun tune. His antagonists were a cartographer and a lopsided person. Their names were respectively, Eileen and Wolfgang hollyhock. Three, the holly Hawks. Widmark did not realize that for over 40 years, the holly hawks had also been searching desperately for the Icelandic fine tune. their interest had been ignited by Ireland's discovery of a tiny zinc fun tune in the Serengeti. It appeared to have talismanic properties, which Wolfgang had catalogued into seven basic groupings, elemental disheveled, yellow, crimped, congruent, dismal and vagabond.

Among their luggage for hollyhocks carried the fruits of years of research 800 Ledger's and the voluminous card index system containing information on all manner of fun tunes voiles westney odd slabs, forensic triumphs and choir stalls scrapings, a parallel compendium of exciting facts about flags. pennants and bunting had fallen over the edge of their raft some years ago, or perhaps it had been lost in a swamp. After the altercation at the breakfast table, the hollyhocks realized that Richard weird Mark was like them on the verge Discovering the sunken lead box containing the Icelandic from tune. They immediately set out in the drizzle to drag the palms. They wore horrifying macintoshes. When they reached Lamont, the nearest of the ponds, they were outraged to find weird Mark already. They're equipped with a thrilling collection of nets, poles, metal detectors, rotating things, crimping irons and booster guns. The major Damo stood at the dining room window, peering out through the drizzle towards the seven palms. A fight had broken out among three of the guests macintoshes had been removed, and boxing gloves dawn, there were fisticuffs, there were gunshots. There was wailing. Before long, all three had managed to drown one another, and all in the same pond. But which pond and was it the same pond at the bottom of which a lead box lay? The major Damo turned away, hooting quietly, he project into the kitchen and made a start on the porridge in crusted bowls. He had work to do.

The Tale of gas barred, gas powered worked for the gas board. In appearance he resembled the man dressed in red raising his left arm in Hieronymus Bosch is painting the ship of fools. Incidentally, while we're briefly on the subject of art, you may or may not know that the famous foot from the credit sequence of Monty Python's Flying Circus was taken from Angelo bronzy knows allegory, Venus, Cupid, folly and time. But enough of that, back to gas Bard who worked for the gas board. Gas Bard was both beautiful and dismaying. An air of glumness hovered over him. To some it was visible aura flies and other tiny annoying things with wings seemed to follow him around. Had he the wit, gas Bard could have made himself useful for the world's entomologists, but he was different, as well as being dutiful and dismaying. His gas board desk was a sorry piece of furniture, rickety and fragile. gas. Bard sat at it for many, many hours each day to no apparent purpose. There's a story by john Cheever. I can't remember the title but it ends with the question are what can you do with a man like that? The same can be asked of gas barred, for there is something almost inhuman in his dullness. Let us whisk him away then and place him in the icy wastes of northern Canada sitting on a fell blog surrounded by frisky reindeer sipping from his flask of piping hot broth, the stars sparkle in the clear night sky. A voice booms from the heavens. Gas Bard gas Bard. He is stricken with terror yet he knows this is the most important thing that has ever happened to him. So he reaches into the pocket of his anorak and takes out a little notepad on a borrow irritatingly justice he is about to drop down whatever supernatural command he is to be given for his fall silent and the only sound is that of pitiless Arctic gales roaring in his ears. So we shall leave him there as he drinks the last of his broth, and though he remains ignorant of his destiny, we can rest assured that gas BOD is soon to become the stipendiary Vizier of CAC and no ot but wassail and Glee for all eternity, for he is immortal and he is magnificent.
