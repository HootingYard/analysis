Greetings listeners, this is hooting yelled on the air. My name is Frank key, and it's four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon. Every now and then, I'm asked by people where did the name where the title hooting yd come from? And I avoid answering the question I have two methods of avoiding answering it. The first is to admit a very low, almost inaudible groan of despair. bit like accent except less audible than that. And the other thing I do if someone says that to me is I point up into the sky and say, Look, look, a flock of seagulls, and the person turns to look, and then cleverly, I've managed to divert the conversation onto an extravagantly boof haunted pop group from the 1980s. Anyway, enough of that, two weeks ago on the show, I read a story entitled some palms or hotel for hollyhocks. This story is called some hotels are hollyhock, the pons, one, some hotels, there are seven hotels. Their names are Crone crustacean, flask, infection, miasma, unbearable, and vagabond. He is built of cheapened rusty metal and perched on the edge of a precipice. There are seven precipices over each of which a scientist of note has plunged to a watery death during the past two weeks. in chronological order, those who plummeted were a botanist, a physicist, a friend ologists and audiologist, a laboratory get a bacteriologist, and an unspeakably mustachioed vivisection Ernest. Each had been a paying guest at one of the hotels, though none of them hurtled over the precipice upon which their own hotel teetered the phrenologist for example, breakfast did upon porridge in the hotel miasma, then threw herself from the pocked and crumbling cliff face adjacent to the Crone hotel, or she pushed. It is in hope of answering this question that the indefatigable Hungarian detective Buland held bag has trudged on to the scene. He is seven feet tall sports are raffish wind treater, and has booked into all seven hotels within the space of half an hour, using a variety of aliases and disguises at the infection hotel. He is known to the desk staff as Mr. B McGrew, a Scottish safety engineer of sober mean and modest wealth is only luggage, a small orange tote bag. at the hotel vagabond he has them convinced that he is barren glub glub a fanatical winter sports enthusiast lewd and boisterous, who displays a fine array of Bob slay championship medals upon his turquoise tunic. For these and for his five other identities, Detective hell bag has all the required documentation, forged passports and letters of transit, doctored photographs, Beatle diagrams, and other seemingly personal paperwork at 4pm, firmly established in all seven hotels, he is to be found pasting a piece of blotting paper at head height to the outside wall of the crustacean hotel laundry room. Such attention to detail is the mark of the great detective, and hell bag is in no doubt as to the sheer magnitude of his ratty alternative genius. As ever, he has imposed upon himself a strict timetable for solving this case, he is confident that he can wrap it up within 48 hours. Indeed, such as his arrogance that he has overlooked one startling fact. The major Damo at the hotel unbearable, is hell bags brother Rolfe, whom he has not seen for 10 years. The last time they met in vegetation and in or they made a handshake last for hours. Then, two days later, Ralph was sentenced to hang For the brutal slaying of a loopy cops a ship's captain who scowl he smashed to pieces with a stolen windy go to a hollyhock.

The most luxurious of the hotels is the one beginning with B. It's tremendous gardens festooned with foliage well until recently tended by a retired cake person whose glaucoma and rickets gave him increasing grip. Following a series of incidents involving his shark, or his cardigan, he was on I'm sorry, none of the hotels has a name beginning with B. And I'll start the start again. To a hollyhock. The least repugnant of the hotels is the one beginning with F. Its gardens are neither tremendous nor foliage riddled nor attended by a half blind shark owning person of cake. Indeed, it can hardly be said to have a garden at all. The floor of the lobby is covered in soil or mud, and ridiculous chaffinches Witter from the rooftops but the only foliage to be seen in the flask hotel is a huge cement hollyhock in the dining room, placed there by a permanent resident in the sedge by name, who's often truculent gob, Ill befits a man of the cloth. cleverly conceal the top, the very pinnacle of the cement hollyhock is a sliver of pugsley imbued with monstrous properties. It is at once refulgent and count serious, dismaying and arcane. In years past, those who sought to possess it had had their heads boiled. Three weeks ago, the surly in the sage implanted the hollyhock in the hotel, which he called home and proceeded to paint it with a thick impasto of gaudy colors. He had stolen the paint from a wooden heart next to one of the nearby palms, not realizing that in doing so, he was burgling the nerve center of Rolfe, hell bags frantic and unholy criminal schemes. Within days of surgeries theft, a stench of vinegar hung in the air about his head, and his tongue grew furry. Three the pond on Wednesday Buland hellberg toward the nearby palms. His Bakelite sexual contain the tools of his trade and adds broaches child suddenly a dubbing tray experimental poultices from tunes Googles of every description, hat paste, illegal Spode a javelin caca lettuce, monkey puzzles and knights oil old gas potato peel courts recent newspaper cuttings stigmata, a tapeworm uncanny torqueflite vestiges of trouser, wild glue, as I Floyd rug, Yorkshire pudding and sibylline he knew his onions. The wind came in from the sea echoing with the whales of the ghosts of perished. Scientists hellberg placed his sexual on a lot of furs and carefully untied the rope with which he had bound the massive cement hollyhock to his body, easing it to the ground, he spat and spat and spat. Then he held the hollyhock into the deepest of the 26 pounds. preening in the drizzle held back congratulated himself on another case successfully concluded minutes earlier. A ferocious pack of half starved Brontosaurus is had been unleashed from his brother Rolf's laboratory in the cellars of the hotel unbearable. As the great detective puffed on a trip route, they lurched over the brow of the hill, lumbering towards him relentless, and fast.

And now as a special treat, I'm going to read some hooting yd fan fiction. This recently appeared on the Internet at http colon, two forward slashes shatavari.blogspot.com hooting yard fanfiction, a collection of short fiction intended as a tribute to the denizens of hooting yard, written by someone called Kristen shrubbery. And I have to say I read this and other I must have written this. It's so I don't know. Anyway, here it is. It's a story called Dobson's uncanny time pod by Kristen choudry. And I swear I did not write this myself. Dobson was prone to listlessness, lacking inspiration, he would generally astrue his escrow tois and visit sawdust strewn dockside taverns when these moods took him, he could be found swilling style grog and exchanging apocryphal nautical tales with pegleg sea dogs. Indeed, it was under such circumstances in the Arctic port of Murmansk that marigolds true once again located Dobson, and bade him translocate to climes more pleasant. Why then did he choose a milk Processing Factory as his next home? It is clear that Dobson found this local arresting, however, our sources do not state what caused his infatuation with this dilapidated industrial building on the frozen shores of Lake Winnipeg. Dobson's surviving work from that period provides few clues. On his arrival, he began work on an incomplete series of EU trade ornithological tracks, describing such topics as the nesting mating and flight patterns of mythical hypothetical and imaginary pond fowl. Growing weary of all things feathered his later factory works with obscure ontological and theological essays, fragments of a treatise, comparing the theories of trebizond doe Cal pepper with those of goon Fang and Tunde ism suggests that Dobson's mood was becoming more introspective than usual. None of these texts provide any clues as to the purpose for Dobson seclusion, even their hellishly rigorous concordance daab. Sonia merely arms an arms around these most perplexing issues, it is likely that our sorry state of ignorance would have persisted. We're at not for a single remarkable discovery made on the eve of Benitez feast five years ago. A weed festoon pod was drained from the Tidal Basin of the great frightening River. It was taken to the Institute for the Study of uncanny pods part of the University at or near ACC, where professors bind Weedon to darky stripped it of its maritime encrustations the professor's pointy tungsten tweezers removed barnacles and kelp, eventually revealing a glimmering metallic lozenge shaped pod. further studies revealed that the container was made from an alloy of tin and zinc with gaskets of gutta percha. on what the professor's assumed to be its front could be observed and around the device, a plummeting cormorant traced in some Boolean bip, such as the quality of this pods construction, the pod scientists opined that it could have withstood the lashings of the frightening river for another 100 years before succumbing to its icy waters. It was sealed with monstrous wells, and require the combined might of the village wrestling team to rent it asunder. Finally, the uncanny pods contents were exposed. It contained a single burlap gunny sack, which in turn held a collection of scrolling knickknacks and bitty bugs. The professor's discovered a trove of original dog Sonia. They found unsent letters to legendary luminaries and accepted invitations to Camp rhinology conventions, incomprehensible drafts of unpublished pamphlets, empty files of gakken goop. More importantly, they discovered answers to all pertinent questions about Dobson's lonely vigil in a milk evaporation plant on the western shore of Lake Winnipeg. questions such as? What Erie phosphorescence Luda Dobson to his industrial retreat?

How did he write with North but utterly lamp to illuminate his scribbling? From which spigot Did he eat sustenance over the long frostbitten nights? Why did he then need to steal evaporated milk cans and what possessed him to weld them into a pod? From whence did he obtain his welding gear? What possessed him to take his few remaining possessions and seal them in that pod? And how did that pod having been sealed come to be sunk beneath the treacherous waves of the great frightening river, the river upon which I plied my trade as the dredge Meister all those years ago. I now know all of the answers to these questions plus many more, which would no doubt befuddle your puny mind Where I even depose them, if you were to glimpse but once the Dobson Trove which has been entrusted to me as curator, all this and more would be made plain, but you shall never see the treasures of which I speak. They are interred within the locked display cabinet in the basement of the museum at or near the gruesome cops at ACC. The museum will be forever closed and barred to you, for you are a landlubber and has been judged unworthy of its secrets. Be gone.

This is the only problem with this is that it's news from Sweden and on must apologize in advance for the no doubt appalling nature of my pronunciation of Swedish Words. But there's a there's a sort of poetry to this that is quite remarkable.

In 1991, the goat was accompanied by an advertising slay, which turned out to be an unauthorized construction. It burned on Christmas Eve morning. It was rebuilt, rebuilt to be sent to Stockholm in a campaign to stop the closing of the 114 regiment. In 1992, the goat burned after eight days, the Vasseur colon goat burned the same night.

So that's the story of the straw goat The only thing I'm a bit puzzled about there is the Guinness Book of Records reference. I mean is it is it. Is there a record for the biggest straw biggest goat made out of straw. I can't think that there be that many competitors but maybe there are who knows. Anyway. Go to gab lay next Christmas and you might get a chance to see the giant burning straw goat

This is a story about his van and his all time. This is his van and Zoltan on Monday afternoon. Crying Crikey, exclaimed his van. What is the name of Heaven is that his twin brother Zoltan looked up from the book. He was reading his plan Calm down, he drawled. You know, I hate to be interrupted in my reading, especially when the book in my hands is the journals of Gerard Manley Hopkins. And I have just got to the entry for that most exciting day, the 27th of April 1871, when the poet quote, mesmerized a duck with chalk lines drawn from her beak, sometimes level and sometimes forwards on a black table. Unquote. How on earth can you immerse yourself in the pros of the Victorian Jesuit screeched his van when I am about to be waylaid by preposterously complicated mechanical contraption somehow imbued with almost human malevolence? Zoltan youand I've long been fascinated by Hopkins, he averred Incidentally, were you aware Oh twin that the nuns who's drowning was commemorated in that majestic poem, the wreck of the Deutschland live buried in St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Leytonstone, East London, and that I have placed flowers on the grave peonies, I recall, or may have they were pinks or pansies, eek yelled his van zahlt and cast his eyes in the direction indicated by the frantic gesticulations his twin brother made to compliment his frightful eek golly gasps zahlt and his eyes popping for crumbling at inhuman speed towards his van was a monstrous steam powered engine, bulky and strange, built of tungsten, titanium and tin and seemingly alive with a perplexing array of Hooters, leavers, flaps, nozzles, chains, bleepers consoles, klaxons, trucks struts, decor shield, Coddington lenses, batteries, prongs, bits of corrugated cardboard and McKenzie beams. It was the indigestion machine.

And I thought I'd end this week's show with a couple of quotations from some of my favorite authors. Laugh catio Hearn, of course, the author of many books, including New Orleans, superstitions, and laugh Carrie O'Hearn wrote, it is bad luck to carry a spade through our house. It is bad luck to travel with a priest. This idea idea seems to me of Spanish importation. And I'm inclined to attribute a similar origin to the strange tropical superstition about the banana which I obtained nevertheless, from an Italian You must not cut a banana but simply break it with the fingers because in cutting it, you cut the cross. It does not require A very powerful imagination to discern in a severed section of the banana, the ghostly suggestion of the crucifixion. And that's all we have time for this week. Don't cut any bananas. And I'll be with you again. For more pros and and stuff next week. Bye bye
