Good afternoon, it's time for hooting yard on the air with me Frank key as ever. And today as a special treat I'm going to read to you from another offer, not me. I'm going to read a lengthy excerpt from bygone beliefs being a series of excursions in the byways of thought, by H. Stanley red Grove, and this was first published in 1920. And this is the chapter superstitions concerning birds. amongst the most remarkable of natural occurrences must be included many of the phenomena connected with the behavior of birds. Undoubtedly, numerous species of birds are susceptible to atmospheric changes of an electrical and barometric nature, too slight to be observed by man's unaided senses. Thus only is to be explained the phenomenon of migration, and also the many other peculiarities in the behavior of birds, whereby approaching changes in the weather may be foretold. Probably also, this fact has much to do with the extraordinary homing instinct of pigeons. But of course, in the days when meteorological science had yet to be born, no such explanation as this could be known. The ancients observed that birds by their migrations or by other peculiarities in their behavior, prognosticated coming changes in the seasons of the year, and other changes connected with the weather, such as storms, etc. They saw to in the homing instinct of pigeons, and apparent exhibition of intelligence exceeding that of man, what more natural land for them to attribute foresight to birds, and to suppose that all sorts of coming events other than those of an atmospheric nature might be foretold by careful observation of their flight and song. auguri that is the art of divination by observing the behavior of birds was extremely extensively cultivated by the Koreans and Romans. And there's a footnote there. There's many footnotes, but this is the only footnote I'm going to read. The footnote says, This is not quite an accurate definition as auguries were also obtained from other animals and from celestial phenomena, Eg lightning, etc. auger is still used, I believe, by the natives of Samoa. The Romans had an official College of augers, the members of which were originally three patricians. About 300 BC, the number of patrician augers was increased by one and five plebeian augers were added. Later, the number was again increased to 15. The objective auguri was not so much to foretell the future as to indicate what line of action should be followed in any given circumstances by the nation. The augers were consulted on all matters of importance, and the position of augur was fast one of great consequence, in what appears to be the oldest method, the auger arrayed in a special costume and carrying a staff with which to mark out the visible heavens into houses, proceeded to an elevated piece of ground where a sacrifice was made, and a prayer repeated.

Unknown Speaker  04:30
Then,

Unknown Speaker  04:31
gazing towards the sky, he waited until a bird appeared. The point in the heavens where it first made its appearance was carefully noted also the manner and direction of its flight, and the point where it was lost sight of from these particulars, an augury was derived, but in order to be of effect, it had to be confirmed by a further one. auguries were also drawn from the novel of birds, birds being divided by the augers into two classes, one oski neighs. Those which gave omens by their note, and two, alley tears, those which afford presages by their flight. Another method of augury was performed by the feeding of chickens specially kept for this purpose. This was done just before sunrise by the pool, aureus or feeder, strict silence being observed. If the birds manifested no desire for their food, The Omen was most dire for nature. On the other hand, if from the greediness of the chickens the grain fell from their beaks and rebounded from the ground, the augury was most failure favorable. The latter augury was known as trapezium solid system. Any fraud practice bother to Laureus writes the Reverend Edward Smedley, reverted to his own head. of this we have a memorable instance in the great battle between purpureus kersal and the SAM Knights in the year of Rome 459 so anxious with the troops for battle, that the hilarious dad to announce to the console a trip Eutteum solicited mum. Although the chickens refused to eat, purpureus unhesitatingly gave the signal for fight, when his son having discovered the false auguri hastened to communicate it to his father. Do thy part well, was his reply, and let the deceit of the auger fall on himself. The trapezium has been announced to me and no Omen could be better for the Roman army and people. As the troops advanced, a javelin thrown at random struck the polari is dead. The hand of Heaven is in the battle, cried purpureus. The guilty is punished, and he advanced and conquered. A coincidence of this sword, if it really occurred, would very greatly strengthen the popular belief in auguries.

The COC has always been racking the bird possessed of magic power. At its crowing we are told or unquiet spirit to roam the earth depart to their dismal abodes, and the Audrey's of the witches Sabbath terminate. A cock is the favorite sacrifice offered to evil spirits in Ceylon and elsewhere. electro Mansi was an ancient and peculiar, peculiar, peculiarly senseless method of divination, so called, in which a cock was employed. The bird had to be young and quite wide, its feet were cut off and crammed down its throat with a piece of parchment, on which were written certain Hebrew words. The caulk after the repetition of a prayer by the operator was placed in a circle divided into parts corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. In each of which a grain of wheat was placed. A certain Psalm was recited, and then the letters were noted from which the caulk picked up the grains, a fresh grain being put down for each one picked up these letters, properly arranged was said to give the answer to the inquiry for which divination was made. I am not sure what one was supposed to do if, as seems likely, the COC refused to act in the required manner.

Unknown Speaker  09:01
The owl was reckoned a bird of evil Omen with the Romans, who derive this opinion from the turians, along with much else of their so called science of auguri. It was particularly dreaded if seen in a city or indeed, anywhere by day. Plenty informs us that on one occasion, a horned owl enter the very sanctuary of the Capitol, in consequence of which Rome was purified on unknown as of March in that year. The folklore of the British Isles are bound with quaint beliefs and stories concerning birds. There is a charming Welsh legend concerning the Robin, which the Reverend t f t, Dyer quotes. Far far away, is a land of Whoa, darkness, spirits of evil and fire. Day by day goes this little Does this little bird bear in his bill, a drop of water to quench the flame? So near the burning stream does he fly that his dear little feathers are scorched, and hence he is named Bru Radin, breast burned. To serve little children, the Robin dares approach the infernal pit. No good child will hurt the devoted benefactor of man, the Robin returns from the Land of Fire, and therefore he feels the cold of winter, far more than his brother birds. His shivers in the brutal blast, hungry, he chirps before your door. Another legend accounts for the Robin's redbreast by supposing this bird to have tried to pluck a thorn from the crown and circling the brow of the crucified Christ, in order to alleviate his sufferings. No doubt it is on account of these legends, that it is considered a crime, which will be punished with great misfortune to kill a Robin. In some places, the same prohibition extends to the rain, which is popularly believed to be the wife of the Robin. In other parts, however, the rain is or at least was cruelly hunted on certain days. In the Isle of Man. The Wren hunt took place on Christmas Eve and since Stevens day, and is accounted for by a legend, concerning an evil fairy, who lured many men to destruction, but had to assume the form of a Ren to escape punishment at the hands of an ingenious knight errant.

Unknown Speaker  12:13
For several centuries, there was prevalent over the whole of civilized Europe a most extraordinary superstition concerning the small Arctic bird resembling but not so large as the common wild goose, known as the barnacle or barnacle goose. Max Mueller, has suggested that this word was really derived from his vernacular, the name of us, referring to Ireland, where the birds were caught, but common opinion associated the barnacle goose with the shellfish known as the barnacle, which is found on timber exposed to the sea, supposing that the former was generated out of the latter. Thus, in one old medical writer, we find this there are found in the north part of Scotland and the islands adjacent called Orca DS, the Orkney Islands, certain trees were on do grow certain shell fishes of a white color tending to Russ it. Were in a contained little living creatures, with shells in time of maturity you do open and out of them grow those little living things, which falling into the water do become fouls, who we call barnacles. But the other that do fall upon the land, perish and come to nothing. This much by the writings of others, and also from the mouths of the people of those parts. The writer, however, who was a well known surgeon and botanist of his day, adds that he had personally examine certain shellfish from Lancashire, and on opening the shells had observed within birds in various stages of development. No doubt he was deceived by some purely superficial resemblances. For example, the feet of the barnacle fish resemble somewhat the feathers of a bird. He gives an imaginative illustration of the barnacle fowl escaping from its shell. Turning now from superstitions concerning actual birds, to legends of those that are purely mythical, passing reference must be made to the rock, a bird existing in Arabian legend, which we made in the Arabian Nights, and which is chiefly remarkable for its size and strength. The Phoenix Babs is of more interest of that famous bird of Arabia, plenty writes as follows prefixing his description of it with the cautious remark, I am not quite sure that its existence is not all a fable. It is said that there is only one Phoenix in existence. In the whole world, and that one has not been seen very often, we're told that this bird is of the size of an eagle and has a brilliant golden plumage around the neck, while the rest of the body is of a purple color, except the tail which is zero. With long feathers intermingled, have a rosy hue. The throat is adorned with a crest and the head with a tuft of feathers. The first Roman who described this bird was the Senator manlius. He tells us that no person has ever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia, it is looked upon as sacred to the sun, that it lives 540 years. But when it becomes old, it builds a nest of kaseya and sprigs of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays its body down upon them to die, that from its bones and marrow, their springs at first a sort of small worm, which in time changes into a little bird, that the first thing that it does is to perform the obsequies of its predecessor, and to carry the next nest entire to the city of the Sun near Pankaj fire, and they're deposited upon the altar of that divinity. The same Manila's states also that the revolution of the great year is completed with the life of this bird. And then a new cycle comes around again, with the same characteristics as the former one in the seasons and in the appearances of the stars. This bird was brought to Rome in the censorship of the Emperor Claudius, and was exposed to public view. This fact is attested by the public annals, but there is no one that doubts that it was a fictitious Phoenix only.

Unknown Speaker  16:51
The description of the plumage, etc of this bird applies fairly well as kuvira has pointed out to the golden pheasant. And a specimen of the latter may have been the fictitious Phoenix referred to above that this bird should have been credited with the extraordinary and the holy, fabulous properties related by plenty and others is not however, easy to understand. The Phoenix was frequently used to illustrate the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. For example, in Clements first epistle to the Corinthians, and it is not impossible it originally it was nothing more than a symbol of immortality, which in time, came to be believed in as a really existing bird. The fact however, that there was supposed to be only one Phoenix and also that the length of each of its lives coincided with what the ancient termed a great year may indicate that the Phoenix was a symbol of cosmological periodicity. On the other hand, some ancient writers, for example, tacitus explicitly refer to the Phoenix as a symbol of the sun. And in the minds of the ancients, the sun was closely connected with the idea of immortality. Certainly, the accounts of the gorgeous colors of the plumage of the Phoenix might well be descriptions of the rising sun. It appears, however, that the Egyptian hieroglyphic banners, which is a figure of a Heron or crane, and that's akin to the Phoenix was employed to designate the rising sun.

Unknown Speaker  19:01
There are some curious Jewish legends to account for the supposed immortality of the Phoenix. According to one it was the sole animal that refused to eat of the forbidden tree when tempted by Eve. According to another immortality was conferred on it by Noah, because of its considerate behavior in the ark. The Phoenix not clamoring for food, like all the other animals. There is a celebrated bird in Chinese tradition, the Fung Wang, which some sino logs identify with the Phoenix of the West. According to the commentator on the Yarra, this felicitous and perfect bird has a coxhead a snake's neck, a swallows beak, a tortoise whose back is a five different colors and more than six feet high. Another account that in the learn, you'd say schweiss tells us that its head resembles heaven. It's either sun, its back the moon, its wings, the wind, its foot, the ground and its tail The world. Furthermore, its mouth contains commands its heart is conformable. To regulations. Its air is thoroughly acute in hearing its tongue utter sincerity. Its color is luminous. Its comb resembles uprightness. Its spur is a sharpened, curved, its voices sonorous, and its belly is the treasure of literature. Like the dragon, tortoise and unicorn, it was considered to be a spiritual creature. But unlike the western Phoenix, more than one phone, Wang was, as I have pointed out, believed to exist. The birds were not always to be seen. But according to Chinese records, they made their appearance during the rains of certain sovereigns. The foam Wang is regarded by the Chinese as an omen of great happiness and prosperity, and its likeness is embroidered on the robes of empresses to ensure success. Probably, if the bird is not to be regarded as purely mythological and symbolic in origin, we have in the stories of it no more than exaggerated accounts of some species of pheasant. Japanese literature contains similar stories of other fabulous bird forms mentioned may be made of the Griffin and the Harpy. The former was a creature half Eagle, half lion, popularly supposed to be by the progeny of the union of these two latter. It is described in the so called Voyager and travels of Sir john Mandeville in the following terms. Some men saying that they hand the body upward as an eagle, and beneath as a lion, and truly they sign so that they then have that shap.

Unknown Speaker  22:06
But our Griffin half the body more gret and is more strong than eight Lions have such lions as Ben or this half and more Gretton stronger than 11 Eagles such as we have among us. For a Griffin there will bear flame to his nest, a great horse or two oxen zoekt together as they gone at the plow, for he has his talent so long and so large and great upon his feet, as though they were in homes of great oxen or bugles or of Kisan, so that men making cups of him to be broken off, and of higher rebels and of the pens of her wings. men make bows fall strong to shoot with arrows and coral. The special characteristic of the Griffin was its watchfulness, its tree function being thought to be that of guarding secret treasure. This characteristic no doubt accounts for its frequent use in heraldry. As a supporter of arms. It was sacred to Apollo, the sun god, whose chariot was according to early sculptures drawn by Griffin's plenty who speaks of it as a bird having long ears on a hooked beak regarded is fabulous.

Unknown Speaker  24:05
This work, that's the voyage and travels of Citroen Mandeville is mainly a compilation from the writings of William of Bolden Salle friar goderich of Porter name, Hatoum of Armenia, Vincent de Beauvais and other geographers. It is probable that the name john de Mandeville should be regarded as a pseudonym concealing the identity of Rhonda Borg on a physician at the age mentioned under the name of yohannes ad bar bam, in the vulgate Latin version of the travels. Note in British Museum catalog. The work which was first published in French during the latter part of the 14th century, achieved an immense popularity, the marvels that it relates being readily received by the credulous folk of that and many are succeeding day. The harpies He snatches in Greek mythology a creatures like vultures as to their bodies, but with the faces of women and armed with sharp claws of monsters all most monstrous this no greater wrath of God sends amongst men. It comes from depth of picture you hell, and virgins face but womb like girl fan satiate Her hands are griping claws, color pale and fell. We meet with the harpies in the story of Phineas a son of Agon, or king of thrice. At the bidding of his jealous wife idalia, daughter of Dar dharnas, Phineas put out the sight of his children by his former wife, Cleopatra, daughter of Borealis. To punish this cruelty, the gods caused him to become blind, and the harpies were sent continually to Harrison a fright him and to snatch away his food or defile it by their presence. They were afterwards driven away by his brothers in law zTs and kallyas. It has been suggested that originally the harpies were nothing more than personifications of the swift storm winds, and few of the old naturalists credulous as they were regarded them as real creatures, though this cannot be said of all some other fabulous bird forms that have been met with in Greek and Arabian mythologies, but they're not of any particular interest. And it's time for us to conclude our present excursion and to seek for other byways.

Unknown Speaker  26:56
So that was bygone beliefs and superstitions about birds by Ah, Stanley red Grove. I did like his tone that kind of, we might as well mention the rock but it's not very interesting. And then the way he says that there are no other myths that are particularly interesting, which I think is quite good. And I'm going to end this week show by beginning to read the immense duck pond pamphlet and the reading of this will continue next week, so it'll kind of straddle Christmas Day. But before I do, I think I should probably read the potted biography of myself, which appeared on the back cover of the first edition. Frankie was born in a lighthouse. As a callow youth, he was attacked by a flock of ravens. His brother stank of camphor. His parents sent him to have an injection, and he never returned home. Cry during the hideous landscape around slot, Frank came upon a fairground and embarked on a successful career as an Undertaker's mute. Today he lives dejected and mundane on the upper floors of an abandoned hotel. Frank's brother still reeking of camphor, entertains him with Piccolo recitals, and the chewing of Brazil nuts. So this then is the beginning of the immense duck pond pamphlet to be concluded next week. A is for a minute dab. like Hitler, he took seven sugars in his tea. This of course, some embarrassment on his first day at the house, they had to send an urge in scurrying down to the sellers to fetch up a fresh tub of sugar. The tune returned empty handed, explaining that the larder was heavily padlocked. Blodgett was furious, his face reddening, he apologized to the new arrival, rummaged in a cupboard for a pickaxe and commanding the urge into dark is every footstep. He thundered down the stairs to the cellar. Shortly afterwards, a minute I've heard the noise of a wooden door being smashed to pieces with a metal pickaxe. By the time he was able to drop seven lumps of sugar into his cup, his tea was screwed and cold. Blodgett affected not to notice and busied himself with a new flytrap. So next week, we'll continue with B is for bloodroot C is for corpse D. For Dr. minge and all the other chapters in the immense.com pamphlet, which agile have gathered, is an alphabetical work. But that's all from me for this week, and we'll play you out as ever with the Keynesian lullaby by slap happy and Henry cow from as long ago as 1974
