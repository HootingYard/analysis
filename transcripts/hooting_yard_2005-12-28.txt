Unknown Speaker  11:24
Whoo hoo.

Unknown Speaker  12:54
What you should know about the carpenters. Karen played the drums and sang her brother Richard played keyboards and sang backing vocals. Unfortunately, Karen died when still young. Richard is still alive, still active in music, but the carpenters as a judo are no longer with us. These bare facts stated, astute listeners will note the remarkable similarities between the carpenters and the Homer nimic. The carpenters who were so successful during the 1970s with songs such as close to you and calling occupants of interplanetary craft. Neither of these was songs was recorded by the carpenters of whom I speak, for their music was somewhat different. A new tray blend of salsa, bluegrass, acid jazz bell ringing and caterwauling, often driven by motorized electronic balalaika is programmed by Karen. Richard was known to be fond of factory Hooters. Their debut album, the carpenters play the music of James last from an abandoned salt mine included the astonishing 16 minute dying be music number eight, which featured guests including Blodgett, Blodgett, dentist and Blodgett, dentists dentist. sales were few and a booking on a transatlantic Cruise Line approved ill advised neither Karen or Richard could swim, and when the ship sank off the Auckland islands, they spent six weeks marooned in a dingey fighting. Some say Karen's health problems stemmed from this ordeal, and they may well be right. But in the words of the old farmyard, saying, never put two carpenters in the same dingey there Annus Mirabilis was probably 1975 in an month period they've released no less than 26 he pays, each of which was conceived as a punitive retrenchment to use Richards phrase. Karen scoffed at this description Incidentally, preferring to think of these matchless works as lullabies for locust swarms. The most startling thing about the records is the pared down instrumentation. Karen thumping the soul of her boots on a giant drum. Richard tentatively prodding the black keys on a plastic toy piano. Both of them sang Of course, or rather, hummed, gargled and choked. After Karen toppled from a radio mast in 1981, Richard approved the release of just one further recording a set of minuets and bagatelles arranged for brass band, and an electrically enhanced flock of chaffinches. Karen's drumming had been recorded pneumatically in the clinic, where she spent her final years. We attempted to interview Richard for this short piece, but his people sent an email saying that he was far too peevish.

I just like to read two quotations now. The first is from what British cats think about television, which is a genuine pamphlet written in the 60s by Maria de Clifford. And she wrote, most cats show an interest of some kind, though it is often of hostility. A significant reaction is the display of excitement when any picture, especially of birds, moves quickly across the screen. One of the things I'm particularly fond of varies the title of the pamphlet, what British cats think about television as this. Obviously, foreign cats have completely different views. And the second quotation completely unrelated is from a book called from the timeless see by William hope Hodgson. I am writing this in the saloon of the sailing ship, home bird, and writing with but little hope of human I ever seeing that which I write, for we are in the heart of the dread Sargasso Sea, the tidal sea of the North Atlantic. From the stump of our Muslim mast, one may see spread out to the far horizon. An interminable waste of weed, a treacherous silent, vast attitude of slime and hideousness.

Unknown Speaker  18:35
Avast attitude of slime and hideousness indeed, but you won't find that on Blodgett Island. Here is another episode lowth are prayin is looking soulful. Mrs. gubbins is tending our Fang Vanda hougen dogs corpse we shall not see those eyebrows again. loath our brain is looking even more soulful. lowth our pre Intel's Mrs gubbins that are Fang Vanda hougen dog was very brave. If there is anything I can do for you, he says soulfully flashback, Lofa prune is under military arrest at loopy cops aerodrome he is taken into a room where a female CIA agent and a male part of Tom's Secret Service agent tell him they want him to help crack a terrorist cell in hoon. One of the members is an old pal of his from the tanto arobin Republican Guard. It's seven years since you left tantaran and you've been traveling ever since. You're either running away from something or you're looking for something. Yes, indeed. He is looking for cloris preen, though mysteriously. No one ever called her that Spitz. lowth are preen angrily. So they're all After Hoon marigold Chu is in the forest. She comes upon exhausted desperate Dobson. marigold Chu says, Come back. Dobson says I'm looking for Blodgett. He lied. Why did he lie? I based my medical treatment on his lie. marigold Chu says people are scared and upset. They need you back. The beach solid music are Fang Vander hougen dogs funeral. Everyone is looking very deep and meaningful holding hands and comforting one another lowth are praying is now looking even more soulful than before if such a thing is possible. Dobson is back and in charge of the arrangement. He asks Mrs gubbins if he wants to say anything. She looks sulky, but I think it's meant to be grief and shakes her head lowth our pre launches into a speech about what a great guy our Fang Vanda hougen dorp was even though he didn't get to know him. Blodgett arrives still soaked in our Fang Vanda who can dogs blood. It was my fault. We found a plane, I would have gone but my leg was hurt. He was a hero. Dobson loses it runs over and knocks Blodgett to the ground and begins to beat him up shouting,

Unknown Speaker  21:31

They go back to the panels flat where he lives with three other men. Clearly an active terrorist cell lowth are praying removes a listening device from their smoke alarm, and then they all talk about the upcoming attack. Of course, it strikes me that not one of the gang realizes that their plans must be known to the CIA if they've been bugged. They just carry on as before mini cron, lopping her baby tiny Enid and perhaps does tack trying to get her to rest perhaps does tack calls the baby turnip head. Eventually, many cron lop is persuaded to go to sleep until it perhaps does tak look after the baby. blood splattered Blodgett gives our Fang Vander hougen dogs rucksack and Mrs. gubbins. He sits down next to her on the beach, and they stare out to see Blodgett says various Blodgett like pearls of wisdom and ends. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sorry. He walks away while Mrs. gubbins sulks, sorry, grieves. Then she goes to Lofa prain who is fiddling about making something with bits of metal as usual. You said you do something for me. Blodgett killed my brother. Will you do something about that? marigold Chu is trying to normalize Dobson's blood sugar. He tries to stand up but is too wobbly. marigold true tells him she put crushed sleeping pills in his juice. He nods off. Blodgett is ringing out his gore splattered shirt, loath. Our preen arrives and asks him how he got that scar on his torso. It's a war wound. It looks more like a surgical scar. Both are praying wants Blodgett to take him to the plane so he can collect what's left of the radio for parts. They set off through the forest. lowth are praying using his interrogation skills to Winkle information out of Blodgett as they walk and bloodroot realizing this, they arrive at the plane. flashback lowth are praying and his powers are playing football in a Hoon Park.
