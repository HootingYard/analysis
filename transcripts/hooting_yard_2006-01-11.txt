So before the next episode of Blodgett our island, with its narrative complexity, Hero here as promised, as a story called The evil bakery eek eek trilled the twins as they turned a corner by the Market Square, and saw looming above them the big dark walls of the evil bakery. It was a sinister if familiar sight. Instinctively, the twins clutched each other's hands, as from behind the iron gates. They heard what they knew was the bellowing of the hairy man. They hoped they would be able to pass by without him seeing them, but they suspected that as ever, the hairy man would be peering out at the street through his powerful binoculars. And they were right. As they tried to flit past, wishing themselves invisible, the hairy man thrust one of his massive hairy paws through the railings, and beckoned them. He stopped bellowing for a moment, the twins legs had turned to jelly. Clouds scudded across the sky. across the way, a French impressionist painter captured the scene with swift shore brushstrokes. The twins, the hairy man, even the vast, gloomy bakery itself are all just a blur as they are in my memory. It's hard to believe that 50 years have passed since this scene took place. I should be here telling you about tin, tin and zinc and titanium. But I'm ever drawn back to the evil bakery and the twins and their hairy man with his binoculars. What did he say to them when terrified? They responded to his beckoning pour as if drawn by magnetism. Is it true that he merely gave them each a pastry and sent them on their way? That later as they sat outside the our library, they chuckled as the fruit filling of the pastries dribbled down their chins. What exactly did undersheriff Calgary mean? When he testified later, but the very air of the town that day had a tank of rare oriental spices and diesel fumes. I'm standing on the bridge now. And hailstones are pinging off my hat, and still, the mystery remains. For hairy man lies buried in the churchyard. The twins of course are entombed in some giant foreign Cathedral, and the evil bakery itself is no more. It was torn down after the events of that day in riots. And on the site there now stands a teenage milk bar wherein scruffy youngsters strum guitars and sing in names song lifts oblivious to the evil spirits flying round and round invisible

And finally, on this week's show, it's a gun about elsewhere in the world, but here in London is fairly gloomy and cold and wretched. And anyway, yes, I thought well, something seasonal. So this is what to do on a winter's day in tanta arobin. This handy guide has been produced by the tantaros bimm Tourist Board a body riddled with corruption from top to toe. Although its internal politics need not concern the innocent listener, who really merely wishes to spend a few joyous hours in the bailiwick of tanto arobin on a cold and blustery winter's day smuggled in woolen garments against the elements that start again. This is a handy guide to the sorts of activities you and your family can enjoy in tanta BIM during the winter months. Should you be unlucky enough to have your plane maker forced landing there drew to storminess, surely the only reason to go anywhere near tan Tara beam in the first place, given how frightening it is. Having said that, for the tourist who does not mind discomfort and privations. tanto arobin can be a source of much entertainment and interest if the words are used loosely, very loosely. So put on your hat and come with me now, as we creep past the golf splattered beasts with venomous fangs which guard all approaches to the town and I shall list at least five things you can do when stuck in tanta or BIM during a blizzard. One, plummet helplessly down one of the many hidden shoots which deliver you into a flaming pit to be poked at with pointed sticks by cloven hooved emps, spitting sulfur, you'll have lots of fun trying to shake them off, but we guarantee you won't succeed. Three take a guided tour of the choc ice factory. The price includes the opportunity to taste their wares for become embroiled in a fight to the death with bone Crusher, Tim, an untamed Python, which has been deprived of food for months. And finally, number five, spend a night in one of 10 Tower beams many ins where you will be entranced by the primitive Gaslight, inexplicable nighttime banging and crashing noises, swarms of Phantom locusts and walls and ceilings that seemed to move when you're not looking. Most inns do not charge for children under 16 probably because they're likely to be abducted by strange amphibious monsters and dragged into the sea.

So that's all from hooting yard on the air for this week. I do hope you've enjoyed it. I'm going to leave you with a quotation from Milo Hastings, whoever he may have been, in his preface to Bran, the iconoclast. And he wrote as follows. Take these words to heart, colossal, crude, terrible and sublime. Bran opened the ears of the people by the mighty power of his untamed language, but the smashing fury of his Roth of words, waste few Thailand plan lists mere howling, empty, chaotic waste for no purpose under heaven, but to serve as food for idle fancies as to what might have been such to me is the death of Bran and my throat chokes with sorrow, and my soul is sick with vain despair. Bye bye, listeners.
