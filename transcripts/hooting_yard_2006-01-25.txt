Good afternoon my name is Frankie and this is hooting yard on the air as ever, at four o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon in London. And the show's repeated at half past eight on Saturday mornings. And it also old. Past episodes of the show can now be podcasted. If you're a pod kind of person, go to the resonance website and look under podcasts. And you'll find all the details you need some brand new stuff this week, after I've been rather idle of late, but I've recently started started back on course and so this piece I'm about to read the first piece I'm about to read this week was written this morning at about 10 o'clock. You might want pen and paper because there'll be questions afterwards. This is called a series of unfortunate cows. misfortune can strike a cow out of the blue to give but one example the field in which it is standing may become flooded after heavy rainfall or, if not flooded exactly, then pitted with many many puddles. No cow likes to stand in water. So such a circumstance must be counted a misfortune. The cow in the puddle however, is una Xiaoli Vash compared to the cow which in attentively wanders onto some railway tracks, and then comes to a halt. Continuing across the tracks would be the wiser, wiser option, for as long as the cow remains where it is, it is an imperiled cow. But unlike ours, cows are not noted for wisdom. The imperiled cow on the railway tracks may suffer the misfortune of being killed by a runaway locomotive, without a cow conscious driver at the helm. I'm not sure Helm is the correct word for the little cabin in which a train driver, cow conscious or otherwise sits or stands. But let that pass. What we can say with certainty is that a motionless cow in the path of a runaway train will suffer the greatest of misfortunes, that is, a violent death. By comparison, the previous cow, the one standing in the puddle is almost as happy a cow as the laughing cow that mysteriously appears on the wrappers of a brand of processed cheese triangles in this country, and perhaps in other countries too. if my memory serves, that laughing cow is red and white. If a real cow was red and white, it too would probably suffer misfortune, for its coloration would make it an easy target for predators. larger, more savage beasts, ones with vision alert to bright primary colors. In this case read would be far more likely to attack the laughing cow than a neighboring cow that was say beige or dumb, or even dappled. Fat being the case, one wonders why the red and white cow is laughing. The fourth in our series of unfortunate cows is the one that is stricken by disease. In the popular mind, the most notable Cow Disease is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. I for one can never read the technical phrase without visualizing a cow with a brain that has turned to sponge. But maybe because I'm mispronouncing the word spongiform. Either way, I think we can agree that this is the least fortunate cow we've encountered so far. Next week, we'll be taking a stroll down a pathway that leads to for more cows assailed by misfortune. Until then, your homework is as follows. answer the following questions to the best of your ability and with a certain dash. One, if through some eldritch soul transfer conjured by a warlock, you swapped places with one of the four unfortunate cows mentioned. Which one would it be? And why? To too, would you follow the example of the red and white cow and laugh in the face of misfortune or would you take steps to avert it So,

Unknown Speaker  05:00
how?

Unknown Speaker  05:04
Question three, what tips would you give to a cow standing in a puddle? And finally, the fourth and last question. Imagine you're a train driver. Would you be cow conscious? If so, list six examples of your cow consciousness, the nude and the trude. Dogs Dobson was hopeless at identifying bones which had been ignored by wild animals. But that did not stop him trying. Sometimes if he tired of leaning on a fence watching pigs in a sty, he would go and get his big spade and dig up bones. He had a few favorite locations, such as the perimeter fence of the zoo, and the aerodrome, and he always came home with a sackful.

Unknown Speaker  06:40
Look,

Unknown Speaker  06:41
he would shout brandishing one of his finds at marigold true. If I'm not mistaken, this is the leg bone of a weasel which has been noted by a pony. Or look, he might say, oh wager This is the tibia of an Arctic hair that has been ignored by a squirrel. He was invariably wrong. Dobson mounted his bones on rectangular pieces of hardboard, which he then hung on the walls of what pastors his study, he added a carefully written label to each one on which he inscribed the date and location on which he exuded the animal he supposed it came from the animal whose teeth marks he purported to see as evidence of knowing often these striations were not teeth marks at all, but Dobson was adamant. One wet February Friday, Dobson and marigold true received a visit from blasto piss Meyer, a man who bore an uncanny resemblance to the meteorite obsessed and liberal democrat MP Lembit opik peice Maya supplied cocoa to surfaces. Having heard erroneously that marigold, true was a past queen bee of the Flying Trapeze. He was hoping to sell her cocoa for old times sake, quickly apprised of his mistake. pismo was about to leave. When Dobson in an uncharacteristic fit of generosity invited him to stay for dinner. He stayed not only for dinner, but for the next four months, during which time he barely stopped talking, instead of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but he could talk for hours fluently entrancingly with barely a pause, but without his interlocutors, having the faintest idea what on earth he was going on about. Piss Meyer was a man of the same kidney. And Dobson found him fascinating. on that first evening as they sat around the table, eating paps and slops, peice Maya, having been shown Dobson's collection of labelled bones, said, I find it interesting that your surname marigold is true, while in that other room there are all those bones which have been ignored. Are you sure that your name is not marigold nor and that the bones have been chewed, but of course not I dressed if my memory serves. The OED defines true as to crush bruise and grind to pulp by the continued action of the molar teeth with help of the tongue, cheeks and saliva and nor as to bite something persistently, so as to injure it or remove portions of it to wear away by a continued biting or nibbling. So whereas one may idli think of chewing and knowing as similar activities, they are in fact radically different. Equally worthy of note is the fact that in this house of true and the Nord, the dinner you have both so kindly provided requires and Neither chewing nor annoying. Being a bland thin sludge one can gulp down bowl after bowl without involving one's teeth one whit. It's the kind of dinner I approve of, for I like to rest my teeth as others rest their weary limbs, the better to preserve them. Speaking of which, if I were you Dobson, I would start collecting animals teeth as well as bones. So you could match up the nor with the Nord. Dobson never followed this advice, but it did inspire the coda to one of his finest out of print pamphlet, which we began writing on the wet June day later that year, when the cocoa man finally left the house. The circumstances of his departure were curious. marigold true had embarked upon a mural painting of eels, using one of the walls of the dining room, because he seemed to need no sleep. PES Maya had barely moved from the dinner table throughout his stay comfortable in his chair and prattling away irrespective of an audience. It had occurred to both Dobson and marigold true that perhaps he existed in a separate time continuum, and that he thought they were still having the same meal as when he had arrived in February. The fact that he never removed the napkin tucked into his shirt front

Unknown Speaker  11:23
supported this view. What I find puzzling, said marigolds true to Dobson on the morning of that dream day as they trudged along the old canal towpath is that when he sat down the walls were bare. Now they're teeming with eels yet he appears not to notice. Perhaps he is a blind cocoa man suggested to Dobson. Don't be ridiculous. Dobson snorted marigold true. As they approached the house on their return, they were astonished to find the Lembit opik look alike hurrying out of the front door. I can no longer remain in a house full of painted eels. He shouted, looking stricken, for I have long feared evil depictions of all kinds. If ever you invite me to dinner again, I will tell you why. He carried on talking but as he scurried away, his words were lost on the wild winds. within the hour, Dobson had written the first six pages of his pamphlet, true nor eel teeth, papen, slops for dinner, a memoir of elasto PES Maya, the only known copy of which is rumored to be in the possession of the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery shear. He keeps it under lock and key and will deny its existence if questioned.

Unknown Speaker  13:21
This Friday, the this Friday, the 27th of January, is the first anniversary of a great dream I had. And I it's very rare that you want to share your dreams well of people because they tend to be what saint what seems so exciting when you wake up in the morning soon becomes apparently completely boring. And but this was such a great dream. I'd like to repeat it. So after a little burst of music, I will reread the dream I had on the 27th of January last year.

Unknown Speaker  14:31
The glove of Arab I was in an unknown seaside resort with a companion whose identity was hazy. We were walking and past a couple of men of Mediterranean appearance, gaunt and dressed in very plain, neat brown coats and hats. I have a film noir air. If I hadn't been so thin, Peter Lorre would have been a good choice to play one or both of them. In this dream, I turned to my companion pointed at one of the men and said He just said in the manner whom I pointed thrust out his hand, clad in a brown leather glove and clutched me around the throat. He fixed me with a stare more intense than menacing, and withdrew his hand leaving the glove in place. That is the glove of him, he announced. Now read this. He handed me a pamphlet, on which was written, he has weak bomba. His bomba is not good. I understood that this referred to me. The words were printed in heavy Black Bloc capitals on brown paper, and reminded me of a vortices track like Windham Louis's blast, the glove of eba around my neck was not uncomfortable, but I wanted to be rid of it. That Peter Lorre figures had disappeared. time had passed, and I walked around the seaside resort alone now trying to find them. Then I woke up. What can it all mean? I should point out that I didn't wake to find myself being strangled, nor had my neck become entangled in a strange dressing count chord or length of string. The only thing I'm sure of is that from now on, I must work hard on strengthening my bomba. And that was the dream I had on two days short of a year ago today, and you'll be pleased to hear that my bomba is now much stronger.

Unknown Speaker  16:53
This is a story another very recent story called stand starlings, pockmarked, mustachioed, and bonkers evil tyrant Uncle Joe Starling stepped out onto the balcony of his data. He sat down in his data deck chair and peered in his bonkers and evil way of a flock of starlings soaring through this blue sky above him. Uncle Joe liked curlews more than he liked starlings. And he had once ordered the firing squad for a bird hating apparatchik, who served him Curlew soup at a ceremonial picnic lunch one summer's afternoon. But he liked starlings well enough, and his lips curled into a smile as the birds vanished behind some trees over by the Black Lake. There were bones at the bottom of the Black Lake, not only the bones of small animals, which had inadvertently fallen into the lake and been eaten by the carnivorous fish that swam there, but the bones of the Curlew super maker, whose bullet riddled corpse Uncle Joe had had tossed into the turning black water by his minions. The Chief Data minion was halabi father of old halaal, who became famous as the irascible trainer of fictional athlete Bob net to Vol. halab the minion was a Wheezy crumpled man, whose tunic was often stained with egg and beetroot, for these were his favorite foods. Though he had few teeth left in his head. halaal was a perfect minion, for within his soul burnden indestructible love for Uncle Joe styling, a love so pure that it had been celebrated inverse by national poet Eagles Zoo averse that was proclaimed now at the marriage ceremonies of even the most fabulous young peasant couples. There was a wedding taking place in a village near the data later today, and Uncle Joe had decided to attend as he watched the flock of starlings crossing the sky again, flying back from whence they came. He twisted the little red pneumatic knob on the arm of his data deck chair to summon his minion halabi arrived on the balcony within seconds. creaking a little your bones Creek halb observed styling. And then he cackled. Unlike the bones of the Curlew soup maker which lie rotting at the bottom of the Black Lake halb cackled to he always cackled when styling cackled. They cackles together often at least four or five times a day, whenever they recalled the number of victims of uncle Joe's firing squads, for they were cruel men. Have them despite the purity of halabi love. I have decided to perform a song at the wedding this afternoon, said Uncle Joe. So get me the sheet music halab nodding, nodding in acknowledgment Hello headed back inside the data to do as he was bed. He did not need to ask which sheet music to fetch for his beloved for styling only had one song in his repertoire. The song he liked to sing was the windmills of your mind, made famous by Noel Harrison, son of the actor Rex Harrison. Rex had many wives, both real and fictional, and though it would not be difficult to ascertain which of the wives was Knowles, Mother, I can't be bothered to find out. I can, however, tell you that this is a true fact. Rex and Noah were watching a storm one evening when a bolt of lightning utterly obliterated a tree directly in front of them what sort of tree it was, and whether this act of God was related in any way to the Lord's displeasure. At Rex's performances. The Pope in the agony and the ecstasy are both important matters which require further investigation for hooting yd Rex Harrison Research Institute is however, understaffed at present. So unless a volunteer sidles up to the entrance flap of the institute's somewhat bedraggled tent in the near future, we're gonna have to put this on hold.

Unknown Speaker  21:37
Now, listen carefully. On the afternoon of that country wedding when Uncle Joe Starling startled the feckless young peasants by striding into their reception, and then delighted them by singing the windmills of your mind. His minion made a tape recording. years later on his deathbed halabi entrusted the precious piece of magnetic tape to his son, old halb, who in turn passed it on to fictional athlete Bob net to Vol. As a gift for coming second, in a particularly close fought 500 meter sprint final. Win fictional athlete Bob net to Vols non fictional belongings were put up for auction in an old barn in a field somewhere near where many sinister cows were grazing. The tape fell into the hands of the Korean dance band leader Park no lip. He gave it to his daughter, who was at the time emerging as a key figure. In the boop boop boutrous seen her beat combo, the standard starlings sampled uncle Joe's vocals on their cover version of Rex Harrison's sons worldwide smash hit. Sadly, however, their record failed to interest anyone except their close knit pals, and you will search iTunes and other online music download resources in vain.

Unknown Speaker  23:03
Listen to you. Here are three brief Tales of the uncanny tale of the uncanny number one. I was sitting in a Bower on a bright summer's day, the air heavy with a verbena eating my snack.

Unknown Speaker  23:45
All of a sudden, gruesome separations of foul smelling extraterrestrial hideousness began oozing from my jam sandwich, and I swooned when I came to. I had a tiny radio transmitter implanted in my forehead, but I remained unaware of it for the rest of my life.

Unknown Speaker  24:12
tale of the uncanny number two they called him mctavish, and he was the village wrestler. He lived in a room above the post office. No other living being ever set foot in the room until the day mctavish died. They found him lying on his bed, as if he were asleep, but there was no doubt that he was dead for hovering above his chest, was a baleful Phantom, emitting gruesome separations of foul smelling Extra Terrestrial hideousness which poured into a funnel inserted into mctavish his right ear. They closed up the room and nailed the door shot and it remained unopened for the next 100 years.

Unknown Speaker  25:03
tale of the uncanny number three handed me that chaffinch young cub it, said Jarvis to his lantern jawed assistant. Jarvis was a top bird scientist. And every Tuesday he devoted to the study of chaffinches. They were out wandering the hills, Jarvis and covet and the boffin had spotted a chaffinch near a babbling brook as the knock kneed youth clumsily picked up the chaffinch. He heard a scream behind him. spinning round, dropping the trap engine the process, he saw Jarvis being engulfed by a giant fog. The poor lads scampered back to the lab, and told what had happened to Mrs. purgative that kindly old washerwoman Well, I never heard of such a thing. she exclaimed, and she hoisted her mop on her shoulder, took Cabot by his withered hand, and led him far, far away, all the way to gondwanaland.

Unknown Speaker  26:11
And the source of those three Tales of the uncanny was a book entitled 620 uncanny tales, together with a pen portrait of Victoria principle, by Dobson out of print. Last week, I bumped into an old acquaintance in the street, and almost the first thing he said to me was, Frank, tell me about nid. Or Luckily, I just been reading Blodgett book of animal sacrifice, and was able to spout forth much wisdom on the subject. And it seems only fair to repeat it. You hear the information which allowed me to impress my old pal

Unknown Speaker  27:30
This is an extract them from Blodgett book of animal sacrifice. There's nothing better to put some zing into an overcast Thursday morning after a night of fitful sleep, then to wander into the desert and sacrifice a quadruped Ed. Goats I feel has been a little overdone, excuse the pun, as have RAMs, why not try a bison or even a dromedary before you can smell the wafting nted or have charred animal flesh. However, you'll need to set up a sacrificial altar. stone slabs are useful, but if there are none to hand, you can improvise using sticks and branches. Don't build your altar too high. Remember, you'll have to tether your beast to it prior to slaughter. Once the altar is satisfactorily completed, I recommend that you ritually cleanse it. There are several very effective ritual cleansing agents on the market, which shouldn't put too big a dent in your pocket. I usually use Dr. Gillespie's aromatic camfil and more preparation, but then I'm very fond of the packaging. Some whaling and you you ulation. I'm going to begin that sentence again, some wailing and ulation while you scrub never goes amiss. Now, tie your bison dromedary or other quadrupeds to the altar, and sprinkle it with something Herbes talc, space, age, glitter, dust, anything you like, and slaughter it. Making very careful use of your safety matches ignite to the day the beast and do a bit more wailing. The air will soon be heavy with nid or especially if you fanned the flames with palm leaves. When the fire has utterly consumed your sacrificial animal do tidy up after you. The ashes may be cast onto the winds. Or you may prefer to use a dustpan and brush to place them in an AMP fora.
