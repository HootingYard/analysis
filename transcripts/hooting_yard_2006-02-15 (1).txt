Good afternoon that was mine exciting new theme music, which is a low harm like that. This is hurting out on the air. My name is Frank key live from London as ever on four o'clock on at four o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon. Some legal advice. If you're suspected of having committed a crime and are placed under arrest by law enforcement officers never provide an alibi, which is bonkers. This advice holds true whether you're innocent or guilty, or even in that gray area between the two like a character in a Franz Kafka story. Let's assume for the purposes of our argument that you were indeed the shady limping figure. Eyewitnesses recalled seeing emerging from the pastry shop, clutching a handful of banknotes fresh from the open till over which is now slumped for grievously but not fatally wounded pastry shop proprietor. The pastry shop is a couple of miles north of barges spinny. In that little arcade known as for one time home to flappers. You moated away in the sidecar of your accomplices getaway motorbike and just 20 minutes later, you were sat in the snog of the cow and pins squandering your dishonestly obtained banknotes on bottled stout when the police come to arrest you, whether it be that very day or weeks, months or years hence, do not say. At the time of the pastry shop robbery, I was clambering up a mountainside in the Himalayas carrying a crate of exotic perfumes in preparation for a long overdue performance of scribbins. unfinished mysterium. Officer. This is what we call a bonkers alibi. It's needlessly avoided, easily disproved, and demonstrably untrue. Also, many Tavern goers will have seen you swilling stout in the cow and pins within half an hour of the pastry shop robbery. And you could not have been in the Himalayan mountain range at that time, unless you had access to an exciting Space Age mode of transport, which does not yet exist. Yes, I know that we were all promised our own personal boosterjet backpacks by about 1967. But it didn't happen. Equally, you should be aware of using a bonkers alibi if you're accused of a crime of which you are wholly innocent. In these cases, telling the truth is by far the best option. Imagine you're sitting at home one day feet up reading celebrity pap to find out the latest doings of steak and fold Geneseo and Agamemnon and nawbo or perhaps other lesser known celebrities, ones with besmirched careers, or no careers at all. Suddenly smashing their way through your window comes a heavily armed SWAT team descending on rope ladders from a sinister black helicopter. A hood is pulled over your head, and by the time it's removed, you're sitting on a chair in a basement, you know not were being interrogated about your participation in the slaying of president john F. Kennedy in Dallas on the 22nd of November 1963. Now remember, you were not there. At the time of the shooting 43 years ago, you were paddling in the brackish water of fiendish inky black pond with other tots from the orphanage. So it would be completely bonkers for your alibi to be. I was standing in Dealey Plaza next to umbrella man or perhaps Mary Moon Man. And then I strolled over to the white picket fence where I took the gunpowder stained hand of where I shook the gunpowder stained hand of Batman. And then I walked off towards the triple underpass and the stemmons freeway officer. Quick as a flash, your interrogators will arrange for a screening of the Zapruder footage. Find out that you have been lying through your teeth and charged you were being part of a huge conspiracy and cover up and always because you gave a bonkers alibi. Next week, Madcap 11th hour plea bargains

This is a story called blazing xcelsius saturated with turpentine. The best way to illuminate the pitch black pit of Doom is to toss into it some blazing accelsior or saturated with turpentine. But that is not as easy as it sounds, mark my words. I have long argued that the pit of doom becomes less Doom laden when illumined despite the Craven voices of my opponents, and they are many, they have used the correspondence columns of many distinguished journals to attack my views, and I have until now refrain from answering their charges. They are a hectic bunch of cowards ignoramuses and pond life, and I have had better things to do with my time. Why then, you might ask, Do I now deign to respond to them? I have no intention of answering that question. But perhaps all will become clear to you, as I read on, or not. What I'd like to do is demonstrate how you can illuminate the pit of doom yourself using blazing Excelsior or saturated with turpentine. By following my instructions carefully, you will be able to reach your own decision regarding the Dumanis of the pit once it is illumined. My hope is that you will agree with me that it is stripped of much if not all of its Doom once lit. First of all, of course you need to locate the pit of doom. There are many pits which seemingly fit the bill and many of them are shrouded in luminous, being bleak, unforgiving, dank, dark and hideous to behold. One of Dobson's out of print pamphlets attempted to catalog the pitch in a huge geographical area which might qualify as Doom laden and it was an impressive piece of work. But the pamphleteer overlook the fact that when one stands on the brink of the pit of doom itself, all doubts vanish. There is a curdling of the guts that tells you exactly where you are. No other pit comes close. This you say to yourself, peering into the pitch black more of the pit of doom. This indeed, is the pit of doom. You teeter on the edge, terrified of losing your balance, every nerve in your body ready to snap. But you step back, if you're me anyway, and resolve to banish Doom, by the simple agency of Blazing Excelsior saturated with turpentine. And that's your next challenge. Having located the pit of doom, you must now get your hands on Excelsior, turpentine, and a box of matches or some equivalent means of ignition. And so you turn your back on the pit of doom, almost insolently and you stride across the Moore's to the little hovel you noted earlier, and you wrap your knuckles on the door. That was a cough not a wrap, but you know what I mean? You are expecting a snag, tooth peasant person to answer your wrapping. And so you are momentarily disconcerted. When the hovel door creaks open and you're confronted by a winsome young woman who bears a striking resemblance to choose day well, old. Greetings, you manage to say, I come in search of Excelsior, turpentine and a means of ignition. Then you have come to the right place says the Tuesday Weld like a woman for hearing my hovel, I have all those things. She assures you inside and you are stunned by the interior, which is done out with much velvet and satin and silk with vases of cut flowers, with space age, plastic furniture in a dazzle of colors, all bathed in a non earthly shimmering light. You are mesmerized by this light. entire days pass by of which you are unconscious, for you have been captivated by our woohoo woman who is rearranging your brain cells one by one for purposes either malignant or beneficial, depending on what kind of Whoo hoo woman she is. When you wake from your enhancement, you find that she has placed in your hand a bag of Excelsior or a bottle of turpentine and a box of lucifers. You have been fortunate. She is a woohoo woman devoted to good go now she said And do what you must do. You are not aware that your brain has been tampered with, nor indeed that you have been entranced.

You step out of the light out of the hovel, and make your way across the malls to the pit of doom. crouching near its edge, you open the bag of Excelsior. It is imperative that you check that it is uninhabited for hamsters sleep all curled and comfortable in Excelsior, as do hibernating tortoises, and other creatures accepting those whose domain is the see. You rummage through the Excelsior until you are completely satisfied that it is innocent of life, hamster or otherwise. Then you open the bottle of turpentine and pour in such an amount that the Excelsior is saturated. Then you seal the bag to ensure that the turpentine does not evaporate. Then you set fire to it with one of the lucifers and then you toss it into the pit of doom. Now you step even closer to the edge and you pare down into what was until a moment ago, an evil pitch black vent into the underworld, but now is lit. What do you see? I could tell you what I saw on the day last September that I illumined the pit of doom with blazing Excelsior saturated with turpentine. I could speak of the unimaginable horrors I saw writhing in terror of the light of the howling that beset my ears. I could had I to not had my brain jimmied by the very same Tuesday. Well, boohoo woman whose mercy means that everything I saw or heard in the pit of doom licked by blazing Excelsior is forgotten forevermore. For now I bask in that shimmering light, dressed in my peasant smoke, chewing on a piece of straw at long lost the idiot. I always hankered to be.

This is called elegant smudges. It was he thought a very elegant smudge as smudges go. Look at this smudge, he said to his companion, pointing at the smudge with his four finger. Do you not think it elegant? his companion looked at the smudge, tossed her head and then fixed him with an inscrutable gaze. You do not think it elegant, he said. As a Beatle crawled out of his towel hair and launched itself into the shimmering air. It was a flying beetle.

So begins one of Dobson's few attempts at writing fiction, and so too, does it end. He never wrote another word of what I knew that morning he had confided to his diary was to be an I quote, a brilliant money spinning scheme. I will write a potboiler a guaranteed bestseller, a novel of triumph over adversity with a dashing hero and assault free heroine as a Helter Skelter adventure of international intrigue, high finance, technological wizardry and scrupulously researched background detail, it cannot fail. He scribbled those last three words with such vim that he rent the paper in his journal and it was thick, creamy paper to boot not easily rent. Forensic Dobson is Jim pond sees the rendering as evidence of just how excited the out of print pamphleteer was on that March morning of glistening torrential showers and fractious gales Dobson often lost all sense of reason when hatching a new scheme right to Mr. pond in a new article, but seldom can he have been so diluted as this for at least four hours on that Rain Man March morning. He seems to have been utterly convinced that the novel he called elegant smudges would not only be bought in the millions by an adoring public, but the that he would actually write the damn thing in the first place. as is evident from the opening, and only lines Dobson managed to drop down The brilliant pamphleteer was a hopeless fiction here. Mr. pond has on Earth a few working notes that Dobson made in the hours between his paper rending journal entry and the abandoned beginning of the novel. I think we're lucky. He writes, that Dobson stopped when he did, flung his pencil across the room and strode out of the house in his big Canadian forestry service boots to enjoy the downpour. According to Mr. pond, Dobson was under the impression that a series of 59 chapters in each of which two unnamed protagonists examine a smudge and disagree as to whether or not the smudge elegant, constituted the makings of an unputdownable novel. Granted, each chapter was to be set in a different melior the smudges, elegant or otherwise to be found in a bewildering variety of locations. But as Mr. pond points out, Dobson's notes list only, International Airport and municipal bus Depo where the other 57 smartbridge were to be is, as Alexander Scriabin might have put it on mysterium and did Dobson really think that readers would be turning the pages breathless with excitement awaiting the appearance in each chapter of a flying beetle. meteorological records for that day in March indicate that the teeming rainfall lasted until well into the afternoon. Having cast aside his pencil, and his aborted novel dopson, as we had seen headed out into the soaking wet world. He returned, drenched Of course, some hours later, having somehow managed to obtain certain obscure pastries from an unknown pie shop. These diverted his attention for the rest of the day. And by the time he collapsed in an exhausted heap onto his mattress of straw. The elegant smudges were forgotten. In an infuriating addendum to his article, Mr. pond notes that the word smudge only occurs once more in the entire corpus of the pamphlet his work, but he doesn't tell us where this sort of thing makes my blood boil. So I'm going to go out and throw things at squirrels until I've calmed down.

Just to remind listeners that everything I read on here can be found on the hooting yard website. I can't be bothered to give you the address, put hooting yard in Google, and you'll get there immediately. Or there's a link to it on the resonance FM page. And there's also now a routing yard annex, which you can reach via the routing yard page. And the annexes are sort of sort of research source reference and research source, lots of additional information, competitions, interactive stuff on I go there and find out. This is called 10 days in a ditch. Sometimes you just have to go and lie down in a ditch. That's what I did a week or so ago. And I've only just returned. It's definitely time for a bath. But I have to say that my dictum was thoroughly splendid in every way. For one thing, the ditch was a muddy one muddy and puddles strewn and such gorgeous puddles. I studied puddles in an academic context some years ago. So I know for example, that the Latin for paddle is lacquer skillers, which may more accurately be translated as little pool, but will do for our present purposes. Some of the lacquer ski lie in my ditch were foul and deep. Others were shallow little things, almost vestiges of puddle. Each one had its own character, and I would have enjoyed counting them if I could remember how to count. Did you notice how easily I said my deck. I had not been lying in it for very long before it lost its anonymity and became my treasured if temporary possession. The way a medieval Baron would boast of huge tracts of forest as being his possessions. It was in medieval times. That a map was made of this area, which shows some of the many decades and even gives them names. Some of the ditches have vanished Of course, while new ones have come into being. But there are a few that have existed for hundreds of years. I cannot be sure whether the ditch I chose was called Bentley or Abercrombie. So I may make a trip to the library to consult a facsimile of the old map after I've had my bath. While I was lying in the ditch, I didn't give much thought to its name. I admired the puzzles as I have said, and I looked at the sky of fugitive clouds of birds in flight, particularly hummingbirds and Rennes, for I have always favored smaller birds. Large birds terrify me. I fear being packed and I begin to tremble. When I saw large birds overhead, I rolled over onto my front and looked at the mud or closed my eyes. With I shot I sometimes fell into a dictionary fitful sleep, but more often, I allowed my mind to wander. I've been preoccupied lately with the fictional athlete Bob net to vole, having found a whole stash of illustrated booklets about him underneath the sink in the kitchen of my new set of rooms, reading them avidly at a single sitting. I had been perplexed to discover that as well as being a champion sprinter fictional athlete, Bob Mitch Stovall has also won a number of medals and cups for the pole vault. Fast I had to alter my mental image of him, and I admit I found this difficult. For so long he had inhabited my brain breasting the tape after a particularly grueling sprint, a bit like the famous photograph of Roger Bannister, breaking the four minute mile iffley road running track on the sixth of may 1954. I say a bit like because, of course, fictional athletes Bob net to volt sported a huge beard, a piratical eyepatch, and often and mysteriously had breadcrumbs in his hair. nor should we forget that wherever he ran, he always took his little gaggle of pet poultry with him, which would wait clucking near the finishing line, much to the consternation of various athletics officials in their sparkles, blazers, some of them with whistles on lanyards around their necks, and some without.

Frank Key  22:35
So this was the idea a lot of fictional athlete Bob net tavole that I had cherished for years and years. And now it had to be revised. I have to try to imagine him pole vaulting, you may now be able to appreciate why I spent 10 days lying in that ditch, Bentley or Abercrombie without once getting bored. I will confess that I did not maintain my concentration uninterrupted, for there were many distractions. Leaving aside for a moment the birds large and small, which I could see as they flew overhead. There were earthworms beetles, the occasional mole, just one ant all by itself, which had obviously strayed from its fellows and a number of other life forms which I did not recognize or cannot remember. There were gusts of wind which rippled the surfaces of the puddles. There was one spectacular rainstorm from which are sheltered by intoning a spell and then there was Codrington. I do not wish to dwell upon Codrington for to do so is very painful. Suffice it to say that I cannot shake him off. He's been following me now for at least 17 years. I thought I was safe in my ditch. And for the first four days I was then at dawn on the fifth day, I see tentacles clawed at my heart. As I heard the unmistakable sound of his humming his footsteps, his creaking bones. And there he was clambering down into my ditch, squatting a few feet away from me, his gleaming black boots submerged in one of my favorite puddles. He pretended to ignore me Of course, as he always does, he hummed and creaked and creaked and hummed. It took a titanic effort of will for me to remain lying in my ditch. Bentley or Abercrombie now supine staring at the sky and the birds in the sky. Now prone my face in the mud, summoning the image of fictional athlete Bob needs to roll both sprinting and pole vaulting. His poultry loyally at his side. And listeners. I succeeded yesterday My last day in the ditch, that new image swam before my eyes at the very moment that Codrington with a final Creek and hum stood up, hoisted himself out of the ditch and stalked away across the fields, frightening some cows as he passed, but allowing me some respite from his gruesome presence. And now I'm at home and about to have a bath, and there is a mud splattered envelope addressed to me resting on the mantelpiece. I know that the handwriting is called ringtones. He has left one of his communiques. Do I read it or set fire to it? Or do I do neither? and go back to my deck? What would a fictional athlete Bob net tavole have done? He shall be my guide.

I'd like to end today with a quotation from a book by john M. Gould called How to camp out. So if you're planning on going camping, you know somebody's March, April, good camping weather. This would be very useful information for you. Because what he does is he gives a list of all the things that you should take with you on a camping trip. These are the essential items.
