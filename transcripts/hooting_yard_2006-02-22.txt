Good afternoon my name is Frank key and this is hooting yard on the air. Last week, I had an extraordinary stroke of good fortune. Ever since the afternoon of last Friday, I've been engulfed in a flood of memories, and I'm discombobulated, and I differ quite unlike my usual self. I was wandering the streets of pointy town somewhat aimlessly, and as I found a particular corner I felt compelled there's no other word for it. to head off down a dark narrow alleyway were looked a strange little shop. Do you remember the scene towards the end of random harvest moving Leroy's film from 1942 were Charles Rainier, played by Ronald Coleman turns down a side street to go to a tobacconist and then wonders how he knew it was there, this being a town he's never knowingly visited before. And how his consternation is the spurt or his gradual recollection of the life that a traffic accident has wiped from his memory, leaving within a few minutes of film time, to the tear stained scene where he and Paula Greer Garson are reunited at the gates of their idyllic country cottage. Well, as I entered the shop in that pointy town alleyway, I had a very similar jolt to my memory. Although I'm not a veteran of the First World War, whose shell shock could lead to total amnesia and a reluctance to speak like Charles renia. listeners who have no idea what I'm gambling on about should take steps to see this magnificent film at the earliest opportunity. I guarantee that even those with the flimsiest of hearts will be sobbing copiously by the end. Not the hooting yard listeners tend to be flaunted hot, flinty hearted as a general rule, according to the latest listener profiles gathered by Fatima giller. Blatt and her team of wasp rules anyway, the shop into which I tottered, having tripped on a thing discarded in the alleyway was not a tobacconist. It was called I noted this veil of tears, and it's unexpectedly neon bright interior contained a hetero clight jumble of items for sale. I can only call them odds and ends. battered biscuit tins, dish cloths. Iron utensils have no apparent utility bags full of Swan feathers, rubber inhaling tubes, dog eared snapshots of goats, pigs and barnyard animals in general. buckets and pails, packets of cupcake mixture form over slings from a stage production of tap or spigot, fruit made out of wax foldout wiring diagrams, wiring, trees, cloth pastry cases, bound copies of the propeller, abandoned and in some cases, broken sandwich boards, or stuffed crow litmus paper, human hair braided into rope for ships, surgery ready canisters, pin cushions, TOC h lamps, Fahrenheit converters, big forks rotating wooden cubes on a spindle, frozen blogs and information poster showing the correct pronunciation of yogurt that is yo hort tassels, baubles and bells, some of them enormous bells from a famous foundry annals of jurisprudence, kitchen whisks repair kits for the irrepairable teaspoons marzipan clock springs, grease in balls, a thumb natto for a marble bust of the head of Ringo Starr lanterns, rattles, fripperies saws, starched white butchers curtains, and they're in among it all still in its dust cake packaging, but otherwise pristine, an original series oglesby's steering panel. Were you lucky enough when you were a tiny tot to receive an auxbeam steering panel as a birthday gift? I was. I still remember with absolute clarity waking on the icy cold morning of my 10th birthday. And finding at the foot of my bed, a rectangular object wrapped in old newspaper on which either my father or my mother had scribbled in crayon. Happy birthday to our 10 year old. I was a beautiful and pious child. So before tearing the package open a repair to the bathroom to brush my teeth and to plunge my head into a sink. Full of icy water, and then I went downstairs to find my parents.

Unknown Speaker  05:06
My mother within the garden slaughtering insects. I thanked her for my gift and asked where my father was so I could thank him to my mother gave me a woebegone look and patted me on the head, massing my hair in which icicles were beginning to form. I'm afraid your father had to take the dorm train to a secret military establishment at an undisclosed coastal location. towering cliffs monstrous waves shingle, where he will be cooped up for the next six months, helping to devise counterintelligence techniques for use against an enemy so powerful, so ruthless, so fiendish that it beggars belief, said my mother, and she tapped the side of her nose, indicating that this startling news was to be kept under my hat. Had I better had to keep it under. Gosh, I replied. So part is not as he appears to all and sundry a simple village potato shop person that is but a cover for his real work, which is of national, no international importance. Well, I never. It is indeed so said my mother. And as it's your birthday, I'm going to make a present to you of a hat. And you must promise like the dutiful and pious child you are to keep this world shattering revelation underneath it until you reach your majority. I will do so Mama, I promised her mention of a present record my mind to the rectangular package at the foot of my bed, it seemed unlikely that it contained a hat. It was as if my mother read my thoughts. The hat is an extra gift she said for your proper present is the one in the rectangular newspaper wrapped package at the foot of your bed. Go and open it now and leave me to my slaughter of aphids. I ran upstairs and tore open the rectangular newspaper wrapped package at the foot of my bed. Is it possible to convey to you the sheer joy with which my entire being was convulsed? When I saw that I've been given an original series oglesby's steering panel. There it was new and gleaming with its little knobs and levers and the red Bakelite prong on one side and the rubber speaking funnel on the other. The Braille like raised round nodes next to the hooter the metal snags, the clip on flaps, and so many many dials. I think I played with it constantly for the next three hours, until the terrible moment when my father suddenly crashed through the door of my room. ashen faced and trembling, until the original series auxbeam steering panel from my puny little hands. I have had to jet back here suddenly some, he said in a voice broken by strain. Our powerful, ruthless and fiendish enemy is within minutes of unleashing a plot so intricate, so tangled, just so damn bonkers, that the very future of the globe is in diarist peril. Only by dismantling your new original series auxbeam steering panel and using the parts for our top secret counter attack machine, will the world be saved to guarantee that children like you have a future free from fear of all that is fiendish I'm sure you understand. And he was gone. And I was left alone on the floor of my room, dutiful and pious, and I never saw my birthday gift again. Oh yeah, the world was saved. The powerful and ruthless and fiendish enemy was foiled, my heroic father resumed his humble potato shop person persona, and my mother eradicated all insect life from our domain. But I always felt a sense of unbearable loss. Until last week, when I stumbled upon that original series oglesby's steering panel hidden behind an array of Pappy and mash a dustbin lids in this veil of tears in that gloomy alley in pointy town, and the long, insufferable, melancholy years was swept away, and I was a child of 10 again, with icicles in my hair.

Unknown Speaker  10:03
I do recommend random harvest. It's a marvelous film and topical stuff now. And as the deadly bird flu virus sweeps inexorably westward, France apparently is the latest country to report a case. It's vitally important that you take preventative measures to ensure that your pet Swan or swans do not fall victim to the virus. If you act in time, your Swan will not have to be called by a Wellington booted government official armed with a gum or some poison pellets. The simplest way to save the life of your Swan is to your it indoors and keep it there. If you do so, the virus can lay waste all outdoor birdlife for as far as you can see, but your indoor Swan will be snug and secure. So long as you batten down the hatches and allow no other birds into your house. There will be no point keeping your Swan indoors. If you then invite in any passing Eagle chaffinch vulture Starling or peewit. I'm assuming for the purposes of this advisory note that you have only one Swan, but if you have two or more pet swans, you will find the technique outlined here equally effective. swans are independent minded birds and no matter how devoted a swan keeper you are, they will always prefer to glide up and down the river or lake looking graceful and showing off their beautiful profiles than to be house bound and cloistered. You might think it's a simple matter of plucking your Swan from the water, tucking it under your arm, carrying indoors and putting it on the sofa. Do try to remember, however, that swans can be very aggressive. Next time you're with your Swan look at its face very close to and tell me if you do not see a cold, hard, alien savagery. You're probably thinking that luring your Swan indoors is a simple matter of laying a trail of breadcrumbs and millet or other seeds from the edge of the lake, across the muddy field and in through your front door to the living room. Not so most swans however famished will balk at entering a building. They will Peck eagerly away until they get to the door but then almost certain to turn around and return to the lake trancing more food will appear there before long and it will you can be sure of that. Can a swan be lewd indoors by placing a decoys Swan in your living room. This is possible, but your decoyed must be thoroughly convincing. It not only needs to look like a swan and sound like a swan. But ideally it should smell like a swan to you're not going to succeed by bundling up some old neck curtains blackening a portion with charcoal to resemble the head and covering in weeds drag from the lake. Your Swan will take one cold pitiless look at it, turn around and waddle back to the lake, possibly landing to bite your hand as it leaves. What you need to do if you're to have an indoor Swan safe from bird flu, is to make your living room a more attractive environment for it than its usual like pond or river habitat. This is where a bank of loudspeakers and a tape loop of music by Sir Peter Maxwell Davis comes in. The master of the Queen's music is well known for his Swan eating habits and no sane Swan wants to be boiled and gobbled down for dinner, whether by an important contemporary composer or by a tone deaf in great like you. swans have a collective unconscious that baffles ornithologist and ever since Maxwell Davis found an electrocuted whooper Swan and took it back to his kitchen. His music strikes terror into their palpitating Swan hearts. The non stop racket of for example, His work the yellow cake review from 1980 played at top volume in the vicinity of the pond will soon have your Swan seeking shelter. By angling the loudspeakers correctly, you can make your living room for haven the poor panic stricken swarm yearns for you will of course need to keep the music piping across the pond until such time as the government announces and all clear but that's the least of your worries. The important thing is that your swamp will be safe.

I am gluten free jabbering man and I jabber in the corridors of power like a L'Oreal product. I am armed with light reflecting booster technology. I use it wisely and do not abuse the advantages it gives me how easy it would be for me to take a Member of Parliament like Lembit opik say or dawn Primarolo and not only boost the light reflecting off them, but jabber at them until they too are gluten free. I could if I wished do the same with captains of industry media moguls big players in the world of sport. with anyone you care to mention who has even the tiniest smidgen of power and influence in the world. I have often been tempted to wreak my weird magic on Lionel Richie for example. And yet I restrained myself. Now, I just do the drab boring, a quiet sort of jabbering and I jabber only at the little bugs and creepy crawlies that scurry unnoticed in the corridors of power. unnoticed that is by all but me and by the pest controllers to whom I refrain from jabbering. But even with my light reflecting booster technology, I suspect they would outwit me with their fearsome engines of destruction, their sprays and rays and fumes and beams. I covet such weaponry, but it would be too dangerous in my hands. And in any case, I am the personification of mercy. And I am replete. I recently discovered a website called teen angst. And it's quite marvelous. It's a collection of magnificently intense verse contributed by people 18 and over who have overcome their anxiety, and are able to laugh at their past and the product of their angst. And I thought I choose one an excerpt from one poem. This is from Aaron Miller's poem, a butter cup in a field of flame. And it's only it's only a it's not the whole poem, but it's great. I am a Buttercup, golden and free standing in a field of flame. Strange and hideous beast wander through the fire, and I want to be a rose. And I chose Aaron Miller's piece because I too have often identified myself with the Buttercup. This is an extract from an interview that I gave some years ago.

Unknown Speaker  19:22
So then, Frank, if you weren't a flower of the field, what flower of the field would you be?

Unknown Speaker  19:27
I would be a Buttercup.

Unknown Speaker  19:29
So are you saying that you would like to poison GaNS? Or at least cause cows, indigestion or other mild gastric ailments?

Unknown Speaker  19:37
Sometimes Yes, if the weight of the world hangs heavy on my shoulders, and I lose all sense of moral purpose, that would be true. Regrettably,

Unknown Speaker  19:46
I commend you for the brutal honesty of your reply, Frank, but you do realize that I could turn you over to the police as a potential danger to cags

Unknown Speaker  19:53
Crocker. I hadn't thought of that.

Unknown Speaker  19:55
Is there any particular type of Buttercup you particularly identify with?

Unknown Speaker  19:59
Yes, there is. I would be happiest I think as a celery leaf Buttercup, because it's also known as cursed crowfoot.

Unknown Speaker  20:08
Well, that's all we have time for. Thanks, Frank. If there are any cannons listening, don't have nightmares. Frank isn't really a Buttercup and he's not going to come and poison you.

Unknown Speaker  20:42
Just one point,

Unknown Speaker  20:44
in case anyone writes in complaining that I have produced the reputation of Peter Maxwell Davis, Sir Peter Maxwell Davis, the master of the Queen's music, he did eat a swarm there's a newspaper report if you want the if you want the full details, go to the hooting owl website. And there's a link to the original newspaper report of the master of the Queen's music, finding an electrocuted whooper Swan and eating it. This piece that follows really needed to be read. Excuse me, on February the sixth. So just pretend do a bit of time travel and pretend it's the sixth of February. Today my thoughts turned to custard. I do not mean by this that my brain is curling into mush, though that may well happen as the day goes on. This is after all early 21st century Britain. And I'm assailed by twaddle and pap Wherever I look. It wouldn't be surprising if I succumb to it and began to dribble and draw. That's why I've concentrated my mind on custard. Let us recall the words of Ned Ward 1667 to 1731 who wrote custard that noble cooling food so toothsome, wholesome and so good. That dainty so approved of old, whose yellow surface shines like gold. Ned Ward was a poet and a publican described as follows in volume nine of the first edition of the Cambridge history of English and American literature. He was no wizard, but a pedestrian jog trot writer of doggerel, whom criticism could not have fright, no opposition book, yet his Huda brass is a wonderful achievement. It's fast style fluent ease marks diversifier who could write 200 lines standing on one foot, his language is common enough. Neither brown nor moto surpasses him in knowledge of the slang which was heard in the tavern or at the street corner. Had he lived today, he might have been an ornament of the sporting press, living when he did, he supported the cause of church and state in such couplets as jingle in the brain and trip readily to the tongue. The custard soaked quotation is for more British wonders, or a poetical description of the several prodigies and most remarkable accidents that have happened in Britain since the death of Queen Anne 1717. Incidentally, do you lament as I do the passing of long, even unwieldy book titles? Nowadays, everything has to be snappy and memorable, presumably so it can be marketed by zadkine bean counters. If someone published a history of ink today, for example, it would no doubt be called ink the liquid that changed the world. When David and Carvalho addressed the topic in 1904, his book had the majestic title 40 centuries of ink, or a chronological narrative concerning ink and its background, introducing incidental observations and deductions, parallels of time and color phenomena, Bibliography chemistry, poetical effusions, citations, anecdotes and curiosa. Together with some evidence respecting the evanescent character of most inks of today, and an epitome of chemical legal ink. That wouldn't get past them today, would it? ink custard? Could custard ever be called the yellow goo that changed the world? Possibly not? It's difficult to think of any earth shattering events in which custard has played a pivotal role, or indeni, or indeed any role at all. I know that I could make some app if I so desired, but I'm not going to. Not today. Anyway, for today It seems important to cleave to the truth. What is custard anyway? According to the Wikipedia, it's a family of preparations based on milk and eggs thickened with heat. Most commonly, it refers to a desert or desert source. But custard bases are also used for creatures and other savory foods. Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency from a thin pouring source to a thick blonde. Most custard is cooked in a double boiler BAM Marie,

Unknown Speaker  25:31
or heated very gently on the stove in a saucepan. But custard can also be steamed or baked in the oven, with or without a hot water bath. Instant and ready made custards are also marketed. though they're not true custards, if they are not thickened with egg. I think we can agree that any true custard is worthy of our attention, particularly on this day devoted to truth. Listeners may wonder why today of all days, the sixth of February, I'm so insistent on truth telling. My reasons I should say are entirely non custard related. Exactly 48 years ago on the sixth of February 1958, the Busby Babes, the flower of post war British Football World wiped out in the Munich a disaster. hang your head in their memory for a moment. Come on, hang your head a bit longer than that. Okay. I've never cared a lot about football myself, but my uncle Ned was a fierce adherent of the sport. Ned was not named after Ned Ward, by the way, in case you were wondering, deeply affected by the tragedy that unfolded at that Blizzard racked German airfield, Ned cajoled our whole extended family into joining him in his annual remembrance of the crash throughout my childhood, throughout my life, the sixth of February has been the most significant day of the year. It means more to me than Christmas, or Easter, or even my own birthday. I can blindly let feast days and holy days pass unremarked. You'll find me unmoved on national potato day, the 29th of January, penguin Awareness Day, the 20th of January, and national punctuation day, the 24th of September. Yet the shade of dead uncle Ned hovers over me on this day, and perhaps it's in homage to him, rather than to those last young footballers that I promised to speak only the truth from midnight to midnight. And that's why I'm speaking only of true custard, not over the wretched synthetic slop that seeks to deceive the custard innocent palate. We would do well to remember here that Thomas More's wife, or was it his daughter took custody to him when he was imprisoned by King Henry the Eighth. Those would have been true custards without a doubt. Admittedly, my sources semi fictional, being an ill remembered reading of Robert bolts play a man for all seasons. What's clear in my memory is that this was my first encounter with the construction a custard, as opposed to some custard or a bowl of custard, or, of course, simply custard. I was about 14 years old at the time, given the plate to read as part of my schoolwork, and all I recall of it is the curious fascination I felt for that indefinite article. A custard. It was so unexpected. It made me think of custard in a new way. I tried to visualize what this centuries old custard would have looked like. If it was not in a bowl or a dish. It must have some solid form. Was it wrapped up in a bag, a bag of warlow burlap? Years passed before I learned that the very word custard is derived from Chris Dodd, which is a tart with a crust. So doomed Thomas More's custards would have been encased in pastry, I surmise. One final note, not exactly about custard, but about yellow the color of custard. However pale it may be true custard has at least a yellow tinge. The French painter Pierre Boehner once remarked our yellow I can't get enough of it. listeners. Can you say the same for custard? And that's all we have time for on hooting yard on the air this week. I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope it's been very instructive that you've learned about custard and how to protect your Swan in the event of bird flu and other stuff. I'll be back next week. Bye bye. Oh and thank you to Richard Thomas for playing the part of interviewer That's thrilling interview bye bye
