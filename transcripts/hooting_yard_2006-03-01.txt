Good afternoon my name is Frank key and this is hooting out on the air half an hour of prose. I read in the paper today that the national the Natural History Museum have got a giant squid, which they're going to put on display, sort of pickled in brine. And it's got 20 foot long tentacles. And it there's a little photo of it in The Guardian and it looks marvelous, which makes this story all the more topical. I think. This is called bucephalus and the cephalopods in the Bosphorus The weather was foul on that day in the ancient world that Thursday when an unaccompanied horse can't cantered to a halt at the bank of a mighty waterway. The horse was Alexander the Great steed bucephalus, sent by the Macedonian hero for a recuperative holiday. The river was the Bosphorus, the strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. Alex Alexander was a firm believer in horse holidays, when young bucephalus had been skittish and temperamental, frightened of his own shadow, and Alexander's ministrations had become him. But even as the mature horse he was now There were times when he needed a break from campaigning and battle. Thus it was that Alexander had waved him off to, as he put it, enjoy the mysteriously sultry atmosphere of a few nights by the Bosphorus. But it was not nighttime psaltery or otherwise. When bucephalus arrived at his destination, it was de bleak, grey and wretched and the majestic horse stood still at the river's edge snorting. Alexander the Great did not expect him back in Macedonia for a week. Remember, this is the ancient world. So such landmarks as lying the Bosphorus as the Galata Tower, the palaces of Dharma bar tre, Sarah gan guildies and beylerbeyi. The rebellion Anatolian fortresses and the Cooley military high school had not yet been built. bucephalus began to trot following the reverse course hoping to find a field where he could have a restful time munching nutritious foliage. It was late afternoon on that Thursday when the horse decided to rest and planted his hooves in the mud at the edge of the Bosphorus where today one finds the bug as a tree suspension toll bridge. He noticed a churning in the waters of the mighty river and turned his horse head to look more intently. He was astonished to see a tangle of cephalopods thrashing around in the river. cephalopods large and small octopuses, squids, cuttlefish and chambered. Nautilus is in between clouds of ink tentacles flailing. What were they doing at river rather than in the dark, colder pieces of the sea? Were they lost? And did this explain their frantic activity? cephalopods are probably the most intelligent of invertebrates with huge pulsating brains. And it's easy to imagine that the realization of being lost in the Bosphorus could induce panic among them. bucephalus had devoted his life to the service of Alexander the Great, but now he wondered how he might help these strange sea creatures, so much more ancient than he or Alexander or even the ancient world in which he lived. Could he somehow take them all back to the sea and release them into the vast pitiless oceans that there were their natural home from the warm waters of the tropics to the icy chill of the poles. Being a horse bucephalus could not think how he might lay a trail of plankton and krill for the cephalopods to pursue, he could not think of any way at all to lead them to the sea. So on the spur of the moment, he decided to gallop back to Macedonia to fetch Alexander the Great, confident that his master would know exactly what to do. Last when he got to Macedonia bucephalus was told that Alexander was in the ancient Phrygian capital of gaudium, puzzling out how to undo the Gordian knot so he could become the future king of Asia. So the brave horse charged tirelessly onward, collected Alexander, who had either worked out how to undo the knot or Just hacked it apart with his sword depending on whose story you believe, and sped with him all the way back to the Bosphorus when I got there, they found no sign of the cephalopods. If a horse can feel sheepish bucephalus certainly did. He watched as Alexander dismounted and strode off his armor clanking into the field where the horse had munched his lunch. The Macedonian warlord plucked

a plant from the earth and brought it over to the horse. This bucephalus, he said, Is henbane it is not only the bane of hands, but of horses to one day when the ancient world has passed away, and the new times are known as medieval. It will be used in the bruise concocted by witches to cause visual hallucinations and the sensation of flight. This I know. Alexander smiled and pattered bucephalus affectionately on the main poor, deluded horse, he continued, you saw no cephalopods, you were seeing visions of things that cannot be come. Let us return to Macedonia at a canter and I will give you healthy hate to eat. And as night fell on the sultry, mysterious Bosphorus Alexander and bucephalus began their long journey home. And in the depths of the river, the waters stirred and a squid slithered through a tiny crack in a riverbed rock. It's black fathomless malevolent eye, piercing the underwater world Long, long ago and far into the future for eternity.

And that story will soon be available as a separate podcast. Reiner vana ring binder did not invent the ring binder, but he claimed to have done so. He also tried to take credit for being the first person on earth to devise staplers hold punches, Treasury tags, pencil sharpeners, and all sorts of other stationery items which are last a falling into disuse. as administrators and office workers spend more and more time staring at screens and less and less time fiddling about with tangible things. Rather than a ring binder was a heavyset man with cow like eyes, who looks a little like Oscar homolka. The Viennese actor who played Volokh in Alfred Hitchcock's sabotage 1936, an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent 1907. confusingly, Hitchcock made a film called secret agent, also 1936, which has nothing to do with Conrad's novel. And also saboteur 1942 which was nothing to do with sabotage. Secret Agent the film not the book, starring john Gill good Peter Lorre and Percy Marchmont, none of whom looked like Rhino one ring binder at all. Peter, Lori's daughter Catherine nearly fell victim to the so called hillside Stranglers, Angela buono and Kenneth be angry, but was left unharmed when the fiends realized that her father's status as a film star would mean unwelcome publicity for their homicidal frenzy. It goes to show that having the right name can get you out of all sorts of trouble, even when it isn't the right name at all. In St. Petersburg in 1918. The writer William Gerhardt he was about to be set upon by a tangle of angry Bolsheviks when one of them recognized him and pointed out to his pals that it was gear hardy gear Hardy, mistaking the foppish young Englishman for care Hardy, founder of the Labour Party and socialist St. The revolutionaries shock gear go hardy by the hand instead of tearing him limb from limb. Gerhard, his first novel was futility 1922. And this would have made an opposite title for a biography of Raina van a ring binder, where anyone foolish enough to write one a man like ring binder does not have friends Exactly. But the closest he came to one was his acquaintance price. montmarte. Not to be confused with Percy Marchmont, who said, Everything about Raina vana was futile from his cradle to his grave. He was the most hopelessly out necessary person I ever met. Why he pretended within to have invented many standard items of stationery is anybody's guess. The infuriating thing is that he had a first class intellect, and he squandered it on futility. And so the seasons turn on the globe spins on its axis. And so dust settles on the past and on tangible things, and still stars blaze with light in the boundless firmament.

One other thing I'll tell you about the cephalic podcast. If you want to keep up with the latest news, there's a great website called cephalopod news. Just put that in Google and you can go straight there and it's magnificent. All you need to know that the latest doings of squids and cuttlefish etc. Speaking of podcasts, this show goes out live as you know, which means that my reading is sometimes accompanied by banging crashing and buzzing noises, or interrupted by me having a choking fit or by other disturbances. It seems far more exciting than a rehearsed cleaned up recording. You'll also know particularly if you're a pod person, that the archive of past shows are being made available in the form of podcasts, or even several podcasts, which you can have sent to your computer before transferring to your pod. Anyway, I thought it might interest you to know how the podcasts are created. Many people think that it's simply a case of taking the archive recordings of a show and making it available as an mp3 file. Would that it was so simple. The truth is that in order for the original live broadcast like this one to be made pod castable a number of extremely delicate and complicated operations need to be carried out. And that's why about once a month, I'm summon that dead of night to the gleaming, high tech skyscraper wearing looks resonance FM podcasting Maestro. The first time I went there, it took me about an hour to find him for the skyscraper is enormous and wholly lacking in informative signage. What signs there are either baffling or redundant. I don't know why this is so and I've never had the courage to ask. I've learned to accept that the front desk in the lobby is labeled simply the front desk in the lobby. And that the person sitting at the desk was a badge reading the person sitting at the front desk in the lobby. This person has not been authorized to answer any questions whatsoever. So when on this first nighttime visit, I asked excuse me, where will I find the podcasting Maestro, I may as well have been shouting into the wind, as indeed I was for the lobby actors both lobby and experimental wind tunnel. Apparently sound recordings are made of the wind in preparation for one of the podcasting maestro's planned podcasts, tentatively titled wind in a wind tunnel. Now, I was used to the more homespun atmosphere of the station's main studio, and was somehow somewhat unnerved by the grandiosity of my surroundings. I took a chance, however, walked past the person sitting at the front desk in the lobby, who was immersed in reading a battered copy of Stockhausen. servs. imperialism by Cornelius Cardew took the lift up hitting a floor number at random and skidded off down the corridor I found myself in. There were numerous doors along this corridor all marked door. There was also I noticed an overly overpowering smell of guinea pig though I saw no guinea pigs and I've not seen any on my subsequent visits. I pushed open doors at random and peeked into each room hoping to discover the resonance podcast my stroke, but all I found were bales of fuse wire, discarded yogurt cartons, and toy crustaceans made of plasticine. There was a lobster that took my fancy, but it was high up on a shelf, and I have an aversion to teetering on step ladders. I think I checked every room on that floor before getting back into the lift and choosing another level again at random. This one was different. It had no corridor was just a vast open plan area with a sign of course reading a vast open plan area empty except for a small patch of Ecto plasm.

I said that it took me about an hour wandering the skyscraper to find the podcast my stroke, but in truth he found me I was stumbling for Fully around what seemed like the umpteenth floor when I heard a loud electronic crackling noise and then a disembodied voice podcast Maestro to Frank key podcast my astrologer Frank key floor. 96 rectangles own it called. So that's where I went. The podcast Maestro was sitting at a console from which occasional puffs of vapor jetted up to the ceiling and slowly dispersed. He was wearing a metal hat and taking ravenous bites from a toffee apple. Glad you could make it he said, you'd better put on these mittens, And he tossed a pair of mittens to me. If I were woven from a material I was unable to identify, and I worried for a moment that I might suffer an allergic reaction. For in the past I have had allergic reactions to mittens woven from unfamiliar materials. On this occasion, however, was well, the podcast Maestro with a great deal of effort pull the big lever on his console to no apparent purpose. Now he said it's nearly three o'clock in the morning at precisely two minutes past we will begin affecting the transfer of one of your past shows into pod castable format. It should take about an hour. You will need to attune a Flim Flam and steady the rattling. Just watch me You'll soon get the idea. And you know what? He was right. I did. And by four o'clock we had a complete recording of hooting out on the air already for podcasting. Since then, I've been back to the skyscraper regularly whenever I get the summons online metal Tapping Machine. I wouldn't say I've become friends with the podcast Maestro, exactly, for there's something formidable about him, emphasized by his metal hat. But we do engage in affable banter as the clock ticks towards 3:02am. After that, of course, we are silent, concentrated, actively involved in our task. And I hope that the pod people among you, when you listen to each new podcast, are also silent, concentrated and utterly involved, born away from the dole cares of your day into the realms of instructive and sensible prose.

It has been said that Dobson the out of print pamphleteer bestrode of the 20th century like a Colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself when still a young man at the age of 20. He published a pamphlet resoundingly titled Why I shall bestride this century like a Colossus it's a curious work out of print, of course, a thin tract with a picture of a whooper Swan on the cover. It begins thus, and I'm just going to have one of those choking fits I mentioned earlier. Well, it begins Thus, I shall describe this century like a Colossus My name will ring out like a clarion in years to come. Whenever two or three are gathered together to discuss pamphleteers there will be but one name on their lips Dobson. Such self belief in so Calloway youth is touching, looking back in his dotage. Dobson found it touching to and he took to sitting with his one remaining copy of the pamphlet clutched to his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end. When marigold Tru found him thus, she flung open the windows, whatever the weather and stamped around the room singing loud, tuneless sea shanties, one that involved pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sail, cloth and shipwreck. Invariably, Dobson's self pitying lassitude would be broken, and he would fling the curiously pristine pamphlet towards the fireplace, wipe away his tears, Dawn his Bolivian military boots in his Stalinist cardigan, and crash out of the house to go on one of his joints. Dobson's joints in the latter part of his life usually took him to the nearest pigsty, but there was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction. He walked so far that day, that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where all the streets had two names. One both illegible and unpronounceable and the other devised by Yoko No. Postal delivery persons in that city were required by law to learn all the double street names by heart or to face summary dismissal if they failed. Often those who did fail, and there were many would flounce around on the outskirts of the city warning travelers away. It was a paltry sort of revenge and seldom succeeded for the delights of that shining city attracted wayfarers from near and far daily in their 1000s. It is a wonder that Dobson had never been there before this particular Tuesday. A dismissed postal delivery person stopped the out of print pamphleteer as he was about to cross a bridge that would take him into the most boisterous quarter of the city. go no further old man, said this vengeful figure whose yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of apparently whiteness. But these luxuriance is only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same color as the done white sockets in which they were set, his shriveled complexion and his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. This city you approach is no close for out of print pamphleteers ever sensitive to warnings from spooks and writes, Dobson turned around and went home. He found marigold true in the back garden, drilling holes in an enormous sheet of corrugated cardboard. I was walking away from a shining city on a hill he said, Is it a city you have visited? marigold true, stop drilling, reset the safety catch and removed a protective goggles. You're a foolish old man in your dotage Dobson she said, though there was kindness in her voice. And it's well you were warned away for that city you think you saw is illusory. Some say the hill it sits atop is hollow and contains heaven. And some say hell. Either way. I'm pleased to see you home. Let us clear the nettles from the vegetable patch. That was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th century, did Dobson indeed bestride it as a Colossus, he was not the only person to think so. But the names of the others escaped me for the time being. When I remember them, I'll tell you.

I've never really understood or cared about computer hacking. As far as I can gather, it's a world of socially inept and probably sociopathic young men who want to spend more time in the shower. But I learned something recently, which means I'm going to have to take a crash course in computer science and become a hacker, for I intend to wiggle my way into the systems of all the major High Street banks. I hope hooting yard listeners know me better than to think there's some base financial motive behind my plan. Of course there isn't. I do however, need to be able to access the throbbing electronic brain which controls untold 1000s of cash points, or cash dispensers, or ATMs, or whatever you wish to call them. Why? Because I want to make every single cash point up and down the land operate just like the ones in the Vatican City. The splendid thing about these PayPal cash dispensers is that the default or principal display language is a Latin Wouldn't you love to go and withdraw your money if you have any and be faced with the rigorous beauty of that ancient language life would somehow become measurably less wretched where it's so

certain aspects of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting is one of those out of print pamphlets by Dobson that has acquired the aura of legend. Not even the most indefatigable of Dobson esters claims ever to have seen a copy, let alone read it and some of Authorities doubt that it ever existed at all. There is of course the famous alleged cover of the pamphlet which was included in an exhibition held at the Museum at or near ACC on the vog in 1992 to celebrate the inauguration of the cones hotline, but this is almost certainly a fake. JOHN major's government had introduced the cones hotline a few weeks before the show opened, and cones were much in people's thoughts. Dobson had an abiding interest in cones of all kinds, not just those used for traffic control, and we know that he drafted some notes on cones made of plastic, though these two are mysteriously missing from the archives. Is it likely that the pamphleteer would have addressed the topic of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting, without finding room for plastic cones as well? The enfant terrible of Dobson studies gassed On peut has this to say, there can be no doubt in my mind that certain aspect of plastic baubles and plastic sheeting only exists in the febrile minds of older wisdom Dobson scholars whose brains have been laid waste long ago, they would have downed tonics and invigorated to combat dyspepsia low spirits nervousness heartburn, colic pains, wind in the stomach or pains in the bowels, headache, drowsiness, kidney and liver complaints, melancholy delirium tremens and intemperance. Now they cannot get their hands on such potions. they pursue hopeless shimmers. I neither know nor care which ancient slobbering poop head inserted a counterfeit pamphlet, cover into the cones hotline exhibition. What I know is that whoever did so was trying to feed them misplaced vanity and score points of a young up and coming dogs ministers like myself, even though at that time, I had yet to publish my groundbreaking reappraisal of the outcome.
