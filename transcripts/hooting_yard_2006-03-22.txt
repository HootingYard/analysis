Good afternoon Welcome to hooting out on the air with me, Frank key. For those of you who don't know the format of the show is that well, I read for half an hour. And you listen, hopefully. And every now and then in between bits of reading, we have that spooky music, which is the core kadian lullaby by slap happy and Henry care. And that comes on. By basically when I stopped breeding, and our trusty engineer Alistair Dixon turns the music up and then turns it down again. Brilliant. I don't know how this all works, but it's very good. So what am I going to talk about this week? squirrels, emissaries from the beyond. In the latest issue of the superb chat magazine, Ruth, the truth, the psychic agony art has this advice for Janice from Pembroke. The squirrel in your garden has a message. Skeptics and naysayers and other blighters will retort that the squirrels message is likely to be give me some nuts, or give me some more nuts. But Ruth, the truth, and the squirrel fanciers among us at hooting yard, no better. I can only speak from my own experience, but it's long been apparent to me that squirrels are in fact, emissaries from the beyond. All that hectic, twitching and scampering is evidence not merely of a high metabolic rate, but of the fact that their tiny squirrel brains are jam packed with pulsating psychic energy. I don't don't deny that they want nuts either to nibble right away or to put in storage for a long hard winter. But that's not the whole story. Consider those bushy tails. Have you ever wondered why they stick up Woods rather than thumping along the ground like the tails of so many other animals? Well, it's because each hair of a squirrel's tail ends in a miniscule receptor, designed by nature to pick up and capture some of the billions of psychic messages swirling around the ether. These spooky thought phenomena, invisible, fugitive and volatile, unnoticed by us humans with our puny minds, but they're the very atmosphere of the squirrels world. Those quivering psychic nodes in their tails strained to pick up signals from those who have passed over to the other side. Be they other squirrels,

Unknown Speaker  03:41
stoats, weasels, birds, insect or indeed, humans. Ruth the truth in chat does not divulge what message the squirrel in her

Unknown Speaker  03:55
garden has for Janice from Pembroke and it would be no doubt foolish to try to guess. But I'm foolish sometimes. Perhaps Janice is a widow, and her departed husband has sent reassuring news from heaven or more worryingly, a stricken from the pit of doom and desolation. Maybe Janice had a pet Swan which succumbed to bird flu, and it has sent via the squirrel in the garden news from that place to which perished swans are consigned when they leave the mortal world. It could even be that Janice from Pembroke trod accidentally upon a dozing bee on her garden path last summer, and the bee is telling her she is forgiven. It's unlikely that Janice from Pembroke is listening to hooting yard on the air this week. But if she is I'd like to invite her to share with us the message she has received from the squirrel in her garden. It may be indeed that she's unable to translate the message from the office. Gotta have squirrels in which it's couched. and here we can help for Mrs. gubbins hooting. God is a skilled interpreter of these things.

Unknown Speaker  05:39
The the roof, the truth and trap magazine and her message to all the squirrels message to Janice from Pembroke are all absolutely genuine. I hasten to add, and also genuine and I'm not lying to you is that after that appeared on the hooting yard website, I received an email from Ruth the truth herself. She was obviously looking for her name on Google. And she told me what the message was, but I'm afraid I can't divulge that to you. This is a piece called the crooked timber of humanity. His frostbitten limbs, Sappho in the doldrums bad gas and forts. If these phrases do not stir you, you're clearly not a devotee of urbaine geister Geist, who was born 100 years ago today. If on the other hand, your brain lit up like a beacon on hearing those words, you will be one of that little band who rightfully acknowledge urbaine Geist as a key figure in 20th century popular music. Popular is perhaps not the most appropriate word. Although he worked within such fields as jazz folk rock who char pop and swing. Geist music never won mass acceptance. He was only ever a cult figure. But it's to be hoped that with the celebration of his centenary, the his of the world can be opened to his extraordinary accomplishment. Who would have thought that an obscure cadet in the Bolivian army would become in the words of one perceptive commentator across between Yoko Ono Xavi a coup gat and Mark E. Smith. We need not dwell here on guys to military career, except to note that he learned to play his first instrument, the glockenspiel when he came under the wing of the legendary Bolivian army glockenspiel instructor, Captain Enrique finished their Bell backwards, a man of whom It has been said that if he did not exist, the staff of the Bolivian army glockenspiel training school would have had to invent him. One body of opinion attests that that's precisely what they did, creating a fictional character, not unlike the supposed agent, George Catlin in Hitchcock's North by Northwest, for whom the Cary Grant character, Roger Thornhill is mistaken. This theory has never satisfactorily answered the obvious question, if Bell backward did not exist, who exactly did teach guys to formidable glockenspiel technique. After being thrown out of the Bolivian army because of his flawed cadetship and shapeshifting, Geist hitchhiked to Paraguay, where he soon fell in with a criminal gang, who, when they weren't cutting throats and pushing widows into the paths of oncoming trains, toted their piccolos and banjos around this market squares of provincial towns, playing an infectious combination of bluegrass and light opera. This raggle taggle peasant band became improbably enough, the first incarnation of the crooked timber of humanity.

Unknown Speaker  09:10
Just clearing my throat. There has been much speculation regarding guy's lifelong insistence that the groups he led, no matter how often he changed personnel must always go by the same appellation. Sometimes there's just the crooked timber of humanity. And sometimes as Bolivian army cadet, urbane guys took a Geist and the crooked timber of humanity. He took the name from Emmanuelle Kant's observation, that quote, out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made. Unquote. And it's tempting to see this as a less than subtle comment on that very first lineup of evil hearted robbers and violent thugs. Incidentally, Dobson once wrote An out of print pamphlet entitled nomenclature of Paraguayan bandit musicians and Soviet collective farm administrators compared in which he proposed that Geist arrived at the name during a tarot reading. This is piffle. Sadly no recording exists of that very first group. By the time the LP pelf and Kant was released with its magnificent trumpets driven melodies. All but one of the original band was either dead, imprisoned or hiding in the hills. Geist was supremely unconcerned at the almost total loss of his group, demonstrating for the first time the ruthlessness which was to make him so feared. As Dave pod puts it in his oral history of the crooked timber of humanity. You could always tell when someone had done their time with Geist band, their hair was prematurely white, most of their teeth had fallen out, and they walked if they were able to walk at all on spavined legs. They trembled uncontrollably burst into tears every five minutes and was unable to retrieve closure on their issues. Despite extensive and expensive therapy. Dave pods own band became a sort of rest home for injected crooked timber, though artistically he's not fit to lick Geist boots. Nonetheless, one should not overlook the fact that by throwing in their lot with the Dave pod, the wreck survivors of the crooked timber of humanity were given a chance to play the Eurovision Song Contest, something that was unlikely to happen under Geist iron rule. Although he did notoriously attempt to enter the competition when he kidnapped Kathy Kirby, but an international police operation foiled his reprehensible if entertaining scheme. Many of us I know would have given our eyeteeth to witness that superb 26 strong lineup of the band, or accordions, trombones and pounding drums backing the British songstress in the specially written song, black rubber, Beelzebub his frostbitten limbs, Sappho in the doldrums, bad gas and faults. This was the trio of LPs that for many of us cemented guys to reputation released within the space of a single month, containing between them no fewer than 100 songs shanties and pop madrigals they still stand as one of the commanding achievements of 20th century music in any genre, vibrant, vivacious, vivid, and even at times, deceptively cloth feared. The story of those fractures recording sessions has been told many times, notably in the memoir by lutenist Julian beam, one of the few band members who managed to remain in favor with Geist and appear on all three LPs. Although his contribution to bad gas and forts consists of a single string pluck in the middle eight of the Gregory Peck protein imbalance song. By the time the crooked timber of humanity appeared on the television show pop fabulousness to promote its release as a single beam had been consigned to the outer darkness as Geist always put it, and was Hawking his loot playing skills at a variety of seaside resorts in exchange for the price of a cake or bang for his dinner. By the time he came to write his book, his arm was withered his prematurely white hair was infested with beetles, and he had all the telltale signs of an X Geist test.

Unknown Speaker  13:58
When we recorded the songs on side, one of his frostbitten limbs, wrote beam guys to devise some new ideas. He made us sleep in tents on the sloping roof of the studio, were bells on lanyards around our necks, and force fed us a great tasteless paste of his own recipe. Every member of the band ballooned in weight, and the constant clanging of those bells slowly tried the sound engineer who had to erase their clamor from the tapes. The tents could not be properly secured to the concrete roof, and there were violent gales throughout the month, so we got little sleep. Only the hammer and tongs players, all six of them were exempt from this regime. They were put up in a luxury hotel and taken to exciting sporting events during breaks. Guys himself spent most of the sessions smoking his pipe and making lascivious phone calls to a floozy. LLC When Julian beam declared that no recording session ever had given him such great joy, and he continued to idolize Geist for the remainder of his life, until the day his pitiful, wasted body collapsed in a heap in a post office near the blister line bypass, and he was pronounced dead. Reportedly, his dying words were urbane guys Tucker Geist is a profound and matchless genius and everyone should devote their lives to his work as I have been honored to do. Despite the feeble and broken carcass you see expiring before your eyes on this post office floor near the blister lane bypass. Gate guys himself was to die within a week he had recorded over 120 LPs played concerts in almost every country on Earth, won the esteem of a dedicated troop of followers and been appointed as at chevalley a de Leo Sayer in perpetuity. Countless times, it had been foretold that he would meet his end at the hands of a vengeful dismissed member of the crooked timber of humanity. fingers were pointed, even while the bandleader was still alive at bassoonist Ned Knight shade, the man who had played such a wonderful solo on a reworking of the snapping turtles of old caddies, yet whose heart had shriveled and rotted when guys sent him packing. suspicions were raised to about Hetty, and Ingmar the Norwegian teenagers who sang on over a dozen LPs, but were sacked from the band when Geist got himself into a flap about something or other. In the event, the maestro was not murdered. One damp Sunday, he was wheeling a barrel of nettles over Bracken whistling the showstopper from his stage musical version of foxes Book of Martyrs when a bee landed on his hat, Geist had always worn bee proof hats until this fateful day, when I mix up at the dry cleaners found him for once in his life, unprotected from bees. In a panic he stopped whistling and flew into convulsions. His head flushed purple. he gasped for breath, and his tongue became puffy. He did not remove his hat the fall. He became snagged in the Bracken miles from civilization. And by the time the bee flew back to its hive urbaine Geist had become hopelessly entangled. Unable to free himself, he lay on his back, staring at the sky and sang roll along covered wagon over and over again until his last breath roll along covered wagon roll along to the turn of your wheels. I sing a song city ladies may be fine, but give me that girl of mine roll along covered wagon roll along. Going home covered wagon going home for this cowboy was never born to roam long the road that doesn't change. So that old bar 20 range roll along covered wagon roll along up IO old timers heading for your ranch house door. Up ti old timers corral me so I'll never stray no more.

I mentioned in that last piece North by Northwest by Alfred Hitchcock's film. And apropos of that, a new property development has recently appeared near where I live, and it's a block of flats called Marnie court. So I suppose all the residents will be deranged blonde kleptomaniacs who tried to suppress memories of having murdered a sailor when they were tiny tots. I do like the idea though of naming a block of flats after a Hitchcock film. Wouldn't you love to live in psycho house rich and strange villas, spell bound court, notorious buildings, torn curtain court or maybe frenzy flat Anyway, occasionally the hitting yard postbox is choked with letters from readers, all of which say in so many words. Frank, tell us what you're really like. My natural diffidence makes me reluctant to respond to such plays, but today I've changed my mind. So here is a brief but devastatingly accurate pen portrait of Mr. hooting yard. Unlike Maya Angelou, I have no idea why the caged bird sings, nor am I particularly given to singing and swinging and getting married like Christmas. On the contrary, I have an almost fathomless ignorance of ornithological matters, and the Yuletide season will find me moping and lugubrious. So if I'm ever to write a series of memoirs, it won't do for me to plagiarize Maya Angelou catchy titles, I'll have to come up with my own ideas. And the strain of doing so makes it unlikely that I'll be in a fit state to continue writing once I've hit upon the perfect title for the story of my own life. Last week, I mentioned our Victorian adverts for various brain tonics and things. And I do feel that if I was able to get my hands on the Cordy, or balm of Siri Arkham that might provide the Philip I need and I'd be able to type away energetically, and then regale you with anecdotes from my past. attempt an amusing at cogent dissection of my current state, and even look forward to the future with the aid of psychic messages from a squirrel. So I beg you to wait patiently while I seek a reliable supply of the Cody or Cody or bomb of Syria. Arkham and when I've got some, I'll continue with my potty autobiography.

dopson a visionary William Blake. So an angel in a tree in Peckham Dobson, as far as we know, never went to Peckham, but he did see other But did he see other angels in other trees elsewhere? If he did, he never wrote about them. He wrote about all sorts of things propellers, dust, ringworm, Roger McEwen, spillages gloom and magnetism for example. Dobson's pamphlet on Rob McEwen is one of his most extraordinary works. He took a single line from a poem by the gravel voiced Bard of sentimental pap and spun from it a dizzying x addresses. The Critic lavendar Thor has praised Dobson's essay as the verbal equivalent of a Bebop jazz improvisation. Although Ashley is profoundly deaf and has been since birth, one wonders how she arrived at this conclusion. One wonders to why she treasures a crumpled photograph of the jazz obsessed armaments manufacturer chevin x p glue on the back of which she has scribbled an illegible couplet. The line Dobson choses the starting point for his majestic pamphlet is from Roger McLuhan's poem morning's enough, where the cloying diversifier writes the hedgehog grumbling back to darkness is known by me and loved by me. In sweeping prose Dobson notes that sleeping hedgehogs are often torn to pieces by badgers, and pandas on savagery in the world of small mammals. would rob McEwen, he asks, declare his love for a badger with bloody fangs, fresh from gorging itself on the end trails or recently slaughtered hedgehog. From there. The out of print pamphleteer poses a series of questions about love badgers blood gravel pathways wax being unstinting about something pantomime, poisonous toads, the Duchess of malfi, gloves, fruit with pips, fruit without pips, and the methods we use to measure horses. It is a bravura performance, even though Dobson refuses to answer any of the questions he raises. Indeed, on page 66, he writes, I refuse to answer any of these questions. You can put me in a sack and seal the sack with knotted rope and fling the sack containing me into a darkened, horrible pond, or even into the vast abominable sea, but I shall remain steadfast in my silence. Why did Dobson choose to end that sentence with three exclamation marks Do I know the answer to that question? If I do, will I tell you? Or will I like Dobson invite you to put me in a sack and seal the sack with knotted rope and fling the sack containing me into a dark and horrible pond, or even into the vast abominable sea.

If an object form is roughly akin to the shape of a ship, we can say with some confidence that its Ship Shape. Ship Shape ought not be confused with shape shift. to shape shift the verb means to engage in shape shifting, a practice of which various phantoms and ghouls are formed, the better to terrify us with intimations of the uncanny. Ah, I hear you say, but is that not precisely what might happen on a ghost trip, where one may encounter Ship Shape and shape shift in the same context? I can only answer in the affirmative. Goes trips are a particularly chilling subcategory of ghoulish terror. But what are they exactly? Some contend that the ghost ship need have no phantoms nor shapeshifters aboard, but earns the description merely by being abandoned, emptied in a mysterious fashionable life safe perhaps for a few rats scurrying and the cargo hold. The classic example is the Marie Celeste, which owes its fame to Arthur Conan Doyle story, J Habakkuk. Jetsons statement 1884. Then there are true ghost ships, ones crewed by phantoms and ghouls, often piratical in nature, and usually seen at night or in gales. The archetype here is the Flying Dutchman. Not to be confused with the Fledermaus or flying mouse, which is a literal translation of the German for bat. And the name of Strauss is comic operetta of 1874 which has nothing to do with aerial nederlanders as far as I recall. Bats poor innocent creatures that they are have often been considered spooky and
