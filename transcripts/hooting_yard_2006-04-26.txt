Good afternoon Welcome to hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm going to repros to you five an hour previously on hooting yard, as they say, at the end of last week show I was halfway through a piece. And due to my consummate professionalism in broadcasting, of course, I completely miss timed everything, didn't have time to read it before the next show began. And the person doing their next show was actually sat here in the studio next to me rustling his papers. So I had to curtail that piece in the middle. So I thought I'd just read it again really from from the top, as they say, this is called grots. The poet john Keats had his elfin grot the poet Owen Barfield had a folded grot there are a number of other grots deserving of attention, poetic and otherwise, drove as beer pints fuming hapless grot springs to mind, at least in my mind, as an example of a so called poetic grotto that we really could have done without. It's the setting for one of his earliest poems included in crew Tom as exemplar, the collection of beer pint teenage grivel, which is mercifully out of print. A more appealing poetic grot is scrim drawers. 10 inch tall toy plastic grot the abiding image from his astonishing narrative tour de force, how I lost my bus pass, and found it again last Tuesday, not without certain hazards. For me, this is one of the greatest poems of the late 20th century, and its annual recitation at the hooting guard festival of texts related to bus travel never fails to warm the cockles of my heart. That's for non poetic grots who can fail to be excited by Dobson's grot. Dobson went on one of his walks, taking with him a copy of Cliff castles and cave dwellings of Europe by say buying bearing gold, which was at the time his favorite reading. Upon his return, his brain was awash with it. I must leave this building and find a grace in which to live out the rest of my days he shouted, and began poring over geological maps of the coast. All attempts to divert him from this mania were fruitless. He thought he'd identified a suitable grot one which was flooded by the violent incoming tide for only a few hours each day and began moving his belongings further, employing a local peasant who had a pony and trap. Only after four trips did this man demand payment from the impoverished pamphleteer who thrust a spare bottle of vinegar dressing into his paws and begged him to continue. The peasant was understandably enraged and threw the bottle back at Dobson Dobson's next ploy was to try to convince the railway authorities to build a new Terminus within yards of his grot they laughed in his face. He made one attempt to make the journey by bicycle with a few kitchen utensils stuffed into his panniers but his knees gave out before he was halfway there, and he abandoned the idea as hopeless. What to do everything beginning with the letters A to J that Dobson owned was stacked in cardboard cartons in the faraway grot subject to the relentless destructive power of the crashing waves, which twice a day engulfed what he's still thought of as his future home. For the peasant Ted ignored the instructions to suspend the cartons by chains from several handy stalactites. Dobson calculated how much cash he would need to take cab rides from his building to his grot and was appalled. indefatigable as ever, he decided to publish a new series of tracks on popular subject, deluding himself that he would make enough sales to cover the cost of regular taxi fares. marigold, choose printing press churned out copies of some hurried notes on tab Hunter, and eight things you never knew about Tuesday Weld those anomalies in the Dobson erver, but to no avail. Not a single copy was a Ever Sold.

The dream came to an end on a particularly wet Tuesday in March, tucking another bottle of vinegar dressing into his pocket. Dobson went to parlay with the peasant. He bashed on the door of a tumbled down hut next to a ditch by the canal, forcing his mouth into a queasy smile. There was no answer, nor would there ever be an answer. For unbeknown to Dobson, the peasant had fallen victim to ergot poisoning, gone crackers and run a mock in the purple hills. The pamphleteer trudged home, sat with his head in his hand, crank 14 mugs of tea, abandoned all thought of living in his garage and set to work on his matchless si. Why I do not live in a grot, elfin or otherwise it was to prove a turning point in his career.

Regular listeners will know that we normally astrue poetry on this, on this program. Poetry is not really our thing, much more prose. However, I mentioned in that last piece grots the poet Dennis beer pint there's a book of dentist but beer pints verse called the vitamin B pirate gang and other maritime doggerel and this is one of the pieces from it. traps oozing charm wedged in a chest. There's no knowing who come best. I'm going to start that again because I completely missed the word out. Ready? Let's go. chaps oozing charm wedged in a chest. There is no knowing who will come out best. One is called Billy head made of cork, shoulders, cast iron, arms and legs chalk, mythology and wrapped him like a shroud. His voice is grating and horribly loud. And then there is Cedric aquatic with fins. He likes to muck about with a box of pins. He has no ears but his feet are huge. His entire head is covered in ruse. hummingbirds paint him as do owls. He's always had trouble pronouncing his vowels. The third of our trio is swiveling down. His head is the shape of a frying pan. He wants went south looking for bees, but all his dreams blew away on a breeze. You have to give credit where it's due, but not to Dan when he's dribbling glue. Three of them then wedged in a chest, each one wearing a red sat invest, losing insouciance polish and charm. Let's hope they do not come to harm. But the chest has been stowed in the hole of a ship whose captain is moody and kills his lip as they sail out from Port the captain growls dam the beakers dam the owls dam the crackers. dam the flaps dam the chest of charming chaps. Two hours later, the ship just sank and all that remained was a single plank. it floated for weeks and then was washed ashore. I found it on the beach and used it for a door. So when you come to my stinking hot bringing some food for my stinking mat go careful by the door and remember your prayers get waged in a chest he who dares

So anyway, that was Dennis beer pints grivel back to more enlightening pros now intensive and scrupulous new biographical research on old halab the crusty and cantankerous sporting legend who was for many years the coach and mentor of fictional athlete Bob net to vol has revealed an amazing fact. According to a recently published monograph by Pierre sugam all halabi worked with fictional athlete Bob net to evolve for 40 years. Without ever suspecting that his protege was not actually real. The Wizard and untidy Trainer with his mouth eaten clothing and offensive hair oil seems to have overlooked the Weekly Comic magazine fictional athlete botnet to Vols Weekly Comic magazine for girls and boys. Were in the sprinter and sometime pole vaulters breathtaking athletic feats were chronicled by a series of pseudonymous writers and illustrators. Professor sugam has also unearthed compelling evidence that one of these pseudonymous writers may have been Dobson. If this is so it would have been one of the few paying jobs the out of print pamphleteer ever held along with his hectic janitorial escapades in that tin milk of magnesia factory in Winnipeg. sugam is reluctant to say for certain that Dobson wrote the early stories, fictional athlete botnet to vote on the pole vaulting pole that snapped into and fictional athlete botnet to evolve buffs his latest metal with a frayed rag, leaving it to readers to judge the merits of the case. It is old halabi ignorance of the athletes fictional status which is the most astounding revelation of the article, one has always been tempted to conclude that the wily coach knew more than he let on. And yet this view is comprehensively demolished by sugam in a couple of sentences. I wish I could read out to you extract from this groundbreaking essay here. But I have been informed that Professor sugam is highly litigious, a monster of depravity on wallows in a foul pit of moral turpitude, so it would be foolhardy to antagonize him.

Next up, this is an old, an old piece, but I just felt that I wanted to read it again early so I'm going to it goes like this. You might know the opening lines, Dark Star crashes, pouring its light into ashes, reason tatters. These are weighty matters, so weighty indeed that you must note them in your daughter. But horror of horrors, with what will you jot? You recall with a Pang that your borrow is lost, or perhaps has been purloined by the borrow thief whose exploits have so in Thrall, the readers of the daily clang. Your draw, of course is innocent of pencils. It has been so since childhood, your papa would have no pencils in his house, you recall. And yet he never revealed the wellspring of his loading. Once you tried to write about it with your borrow, and your book, his loading, its Wellspring was well, well received up to a point, though there were those who said it lacked a certain dash. To your shame. You blamed your powers chlamydia, a conclusion so preposterous that your uncle sued you in a court of law. Behind the door of the court of law lucht are lactose intolerant. nytro gristle nitroglycerin boffin, a bluestocking, who became your wife and changed your life. You parked all copies of your book and sat in steam. You have a hideous headache for a week. But planning as you did to raise no storms. You kept all pencils from your house, just as your father did. Your wife asked why you use the nib to drop down your reply. I am my father's son, you wrote, he died a pauper. He was that kind of guy.

Actually, that last piece rhymed to didn't have to put a stop to this. We'll put a stop to this with medical notes on a mezzotint test. My lung has just collapsed is not a statement you're likely to hear spoken for the simple reason that when someone Lung has collapsed, they will not be able to do much more than gasp for breath. Think of the lung like an airbag, which when punctured, shrivels up with a Wheezy noise. Sort of. This is pretty much common sense and does not require extensive medical knowledge. Now, imagine for a moment that you do have extensive medical knowledge that you are for present purposes, a senior medico in an important hospital. You were sitting at your big desk in your big office, leafing through a sheaf of complicated diagrams, which wouldn't mean nothing to a lay person. years of training and an acute and piercing mind, allow you to interpret the massive medical information contained in these colorful charts and to reach Swift, startling and expert conclusions. You are about to press a blue knob on the desk console which pipes your instructions to less expert doctors elsewhere in the hospital. When you are interrupted. A man enters your office unannounced. He is blubbery and Shaggy haired, and his clothing is creased and crumpled. And he has a woebegone yet desperate air, and His face is the color of tallow, and he smells of disinfectant. And he says, Doctor, Doctor, my lung has just collapsed. You look up at him into his watery eyes, and you press the green knob on your console instead of the blue one. And as soon as you hear the gentle hum that indicates you're connected to the system, you say, please come and get my brother and take him home. There is no exasperation in your voice, just in human patience, and a trace perhaps of a love that is fathomless and bold. For you are dr tint and your visitor is Rex tint. He is known to the world as a supremely talented mezzotint test. To you. He is a hypochondriac, constantly assailed by Phantom maladies and imagined injuries. He is taken home by paramedics and tucked into bed on the mezzanine floor of his mezzotint strewn flat, where he falls asleep. When he awakes, there is a chance that he may yet set to work on his latest mezzotint. Equally, he may be convinced that he is subject to black bile and the flux and hair at high speed back to the hospital or to a clinic or to a soothsayer rx 10 has much in common with the current Poet Laureate Andrew motion, who likes to drink Lemsip while he works, because it makes him imagine that he is slightly ill. I read in a biography of a Houseman that he wrote most of a Shropshire lad while he had a cold motion told the BBC and I thought Yes, I know about that. That sort of slightly introverted, self pitying mood that a mild illness can give. It's absolutely conducive to poems. Rex tent, however, felt that when mezzo tinting he needed something more than a mild illness he needed he needed to be in trauma, close to death face to face with extinction. Whether this genuinely improved the quality of his work is hard to say. For so matchless or mezzotint test was he did an open mouth gasp of or was and remains the only fitting reaction. Somewhere between Andrew motions self pitying mood and the mezzotint is direct, tense, counterfeit death agony comes Dobson's approach to creativity. He had read about the Vatican's practice of ensuring that the pope is dead by hitting him on the head three times with a special ceremonial hammer while shouting his name in his ear. If the pontiff fails to respond, he is pronounced dead, and cardinals a summon from around the world to choose a successor. Dobson was fascinated by this and whenever he felt a pamphlet coming on, he asked marigold to to beat him thrice on the head with a hammer and shout, Dobson Dobson Dobson. No singer throbbing scowl, he would sit down at his escritor and set to work.

I haven't yet decided which of these three methods would suit me best. So I've decided to nurture a slight head cold fine, a collapsed lung, and get backed on the head with a hammer all at the same time. With a dose of bird flu thrown in for good measure. As the listener you will be able to judge the success So otherwise as my courageous plan

first instance you were walking along a country lane as dusk descends. The path is muddy, but you're wearing a pair of stout Canadian forestry service boots, crows core from the trees, and from the direction of the lake. You hear the demented cry of loons jauntily, you swing your stick through the air and westerleigh half remembered Troon from the golden age of the hoochie coochie dance band era. All of a sudden, your path is blocked by a diminutive figure. He is wearing a thrum nightcap, and an ill fitting suit of clothes. He has a goatee beard, a pasty complexion, and while one of his eyes is mischievously, a twinkle, the other seems dead as if it were made of glass. He is carrying a little drum and as he stands in front of you, he begins to pound it with his strangely muscular fist, a rhythmically even PascalI. You step to one side to strike past him, but he dodged in front of you. You step to the other side, but he springs sideways to forestall you all the while banging his drum. your temper rises, brandishing your stick. You are about to belabor him about the head, but he anticipates your move emits a sinister gurgling noise and flitz off into the trees as suddenly as he appeared. You walk on no longer, jaunty, but fractious and grim.

second instance. The arena is packed and you stand at your lectern looking out at the 1000s of devotees who have gathered to hear your lecture. You enjoy nothing more than demolishing David x theory of intergalactic lizard people. And the talk you have prepared for tonight is perhaps your most cogent one to date. you clear your throat and the huge crowd Russell's into silence. All of a sudden, a diminutive figure crashes onto the stage at your side. He is wearing a thrum nightcap and an ill fitting suit of clothes. He has a goatee beard, a pasty complexion, and while one of his eyes is mischievously, a twinkle, the other seems dead as if it were made of glass. He snatches your lecture notes from the lectern, rips them into 1000 pieces and casts them onto the floor at your feet. momentarily discombobulated you become apoplectic with rage and lurch towards the tiny man intending to wring his neck. But before you can reach him, he flicked away and is instantly lost in the crowd. You had felt in such high spirits, and now you are fractious and grim. These two instances are fictional Of course, for you, the listener have never been provoked in such a brazen manner by so diminutive a fellow in a throne nightcap. My purpose in inventing these scenes was to give you an idea of what it was like to be accosted by Pindar Widgery, the pint sized provocateur, countless of those who have been so accosted. Each tells a similar story, that their mood was good they would jaunty in high spirits. When this tiny goateed man in an ill fitting suit. With that in Congress thrum nightcap atop his tiny head, appeared out of nowhere and provoked them to violence, violence, he escaped by vanishing into a forest or into a crowd, or even according to some accounts, just going in a puff of inexplicable vapor. inexplicable indeed, is the vapor into which he has now disappeared for the last time on here to tell his obituary. I know that by convention I ought to have began by saying, Pindar Widgery, who has died 92 in a box light accident was known as the pint sized provocateur. That would have been the conventional way to begin, but I wanted to break the news gently. And in truth I wanted to fill my allotted space with something. And good grief we know so little about Pindar with juries life, ancestry unknown year of birth, unknown childhood, a mystery savor an unreliable anecdote buried in a footnote and a biography of silver screen siren Edna Peruvians formative influences unknown, and so it goes on. We do not know when he decided to vote to devote his life to pointless provocations nor why we can only guess that a smile crossed his lips when he was described in print as the most exasperating man on the planet. We don't even know if that dead eye was made of glass. Perhaps all we can be sure of was that his presence at such an advanced age on a fully crewed bobsled careering at terrifying speed in the snow capped mountains of a cold and distant Winter Sports Resort must have been yet another provocative act. Oh, one other thing we know. Many witnesses have placed him indisputably on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository on Dealey Plaza in Dallas at noon on the 22nd of November 1962. I know this was exactly a year before the assassination of john F. Kennedy, but still

think I'd like to leave you this week with some quotations from other writers. Well, we already had Dennis beer pint but proper writers. So yes, this is from Drea L. Allison's book, the social history of smoking. It's a little curious, considering the devotion of Latter Day men of letters to tobacco, that in the early days, so many of the men who wrote on the subject attacked the social use of tobacco with violence and violence, their titles a characteristic of their style, a writer named Deacon, published in 1616, a quarter entitled tobacco tortured in the filthy fumes of tobacco refined. But Joshua Sylvester had easily surpassed this when he wrote his tobacco battered and the pipes shattered about there is that idli idolized so bass and barbarous or weed, or at least over love so loathsome avanity by a volley of holy shot thundered from Mount helicon, published in 19 1615 controversialist of that period, rejoiced in full worded titles, and in full blooded praise or abuse.

Another quotation from Elliot O'Donnell, whose book by ways of ghost land includes this, were it not for the lower order of spirit brains, there would be comparatively few drunkards, gamblers, adulterers, fornicators, murderers and suicides. It is they who excite man's animal senses by conjuring up alluring pictures of drink and gold and sexual happiness. By the aid of the higher type of spirit brains, I have been unable to perceive the atmosphere surrounding drinking dens and brothels full of all kinds of bestie or influences from ella mentals, who allow men by presenting to their minds all kinds of attractive Tableau to the earthbound spirits of drunkards and libertines, transformed into horrors of the subhuman sub animal order of phantasms, things with bloated nude bodies and pig's faces, Shaggy bears with fulsome watery eyes, mangy dogs, et cetera. I think that's a very, very good etc, that, you know, let him sell off there. Anyway, that was Elliot O'Donnell from barwise of ghost land. This was Frankie with hooting yard on the air. I'll be back next week. I do hope you've enjoyed the show. Bye bye
