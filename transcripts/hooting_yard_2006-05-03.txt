Unknown Speaker  00:14
Good afternoon Welcome to hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. many moons ago. I ended one of the shows with chapter one of a lengthy story and I said, I'll be continuing that next week. But of course I didn't. I broke my promise to listeners, and you haven't heard any more of it in months and months. So I'm going to devote this week's show and next week's most of next week's to this single piece called the immense duck pond pamphlet. I is for a minute dab. like Hitler, he took seven sugars in his tea. This had caused some embarrassment on his first day at the house. I had to send an urchin scurrying down to the cellars to fetch up a fresh tub of sugar. The urchin returned empty handed, explaining that the sugar ladder was heavily padlocked. Blodgett was furious, his face growing purple, he apologized to him in a dab, rummaged in the cupboard for a stout pickaxe and commanding the urchin to dog his every footstep. He sanded down the stairs to the cellar. Shortly afterwards, a minute I've heard the noise of a wooden door being smashed to pieces with a metal pickaxe. By the time he was able to drop seven months of sugar in his cup, the tea was stewed and cold. Blodgett affected not to notice and busied himself with a new trap for flying insect beings. Bay is for Blodgett. Blodgett had been at the house since infancy, he was dyspeptic and cruel. Like Madame Russo. He had never learned to tell the time and rarely knew what day of the week it was. This was surprising for a man in his position, charged as he was with running the lower floors of the house. His Bally wick included the frightening rooms on the first floor, the whole of the ground floor, the cellars and underground passages, except for the secret ones, and various ill defined sections of the ground, possibly including the boneyard, the engine room, and the pointless heart. The arrival of a minute damn dismayed him. He had not been told what on earth to do with this lopsided person, which meant that he would have to seek instructions from Dr. CAC, or one of his cronies. He could barely bring himself to speak to them with their supercilious manners, spotless, frock coat, and not tying expertise. Blodgett blood boiled, without bothering to tell a minute where he was going, he shoved the trap for flying insect beings back in the kitchen drawer, slammed the door shut behind him and headed off for Dr. cacs headquarters. See is the corpse Oh dear, hidden behind an iron chest in the pointless heart bundled up in sacking there is a dead body. The cause of death is not immediately apparent in a few weeks time. an inquest will be told that the esophagus contains three or four small items of ironmongery the sacking is mostly burlap.

Unknown Speaker  04:36
D is for Dr. CAC. Dr. CAC was the foremost potato scientist of his day, he rented a disused, leaking building in the grounds of the house, together with a number of surrounding hearts, in which he and his team of top flight tuber ologists lived and worked most of their unbearably exciting scientific equipment We're located in the leaking building through the door of which Blodgett now crashed, breathing heavily through his purple nose.

Unknown Speaker  05:10
CAC,

Unknown Speaker  05:11
he shouted, pronouncing the good doctor's name as if he were a chocolate swiss roll. You know? You know, this is a live show, and every now and then I make little errors. Now how can I say CAC and then say it was pronounced differently? I'm going to start that paragraph again. Bear with me. So here we have Blodgett crashing through the door. Cake. He shouted, pronouncing the good doctor's name as if he were a chocolate swiss roll or a battenburg. towards the back of the leaking building stood an enormous table on which were stacked flasks, test tubes, scientific hammers, all's retorts, died bucket crew it set turanians shards of proper light, ln Bix, jars, lenses and the burnt quintain. From behind this agglomeration of rubbish Rahu goos head appeared then the rest of his body. He peered at Blodgett with this taste. Whereas cake, yelled Blodgett repeating his mispronunciation rue, who was one of Dr. cacs assistance, perhaps the most fanatical. It's CAC, he said, to rhyme with snack. Blodgett trembled with rage. I'll give you snack he rasped although what he meant by this was not entirely clear, even to him. CAC snack, it's all the same to me. He continued, I don't care if he's called pack rack or glac he's still a get he paused long enough for Whoo hoo goo to interrupt. The doctor is not here at the moment. Why are you flailing your arms around in such an alarming fashion? momentarily disconcerted Blodgett maneuvered his hands into his filthy pockets. Thank you, said Rahul goo. Now, as I explained, Dr. CAC is away, I have important potato matters to attend to so I'd be very grateful if you would turn on your heel and be gone. Blodgett tempo was getting hotter. Oh, how he would like to immerse Rahu in a vat of custard, bind him with manacles, belabor him about the temples and abandon him in a ditch. Not necessarily in that order. But of course, Blodgett was a terrible coward and would only attack defenseless tinies small, frail animals and inanimate objects, and only then if he was sure no vengeance would be exacted by some gigantic protector. He spat on the floor world around and clumped out of the leaking building, cracking his head on the lintel as he did so. He is for you eager. In the scullery, a minute damp sat slumped at the table. his elbows rested on a grimy placemat one of a set depicting scenes of Thuringian history. Blodgett had stacked most of the set on the dresser, leaving two on the table. A minute ABS Matt showed the execution of Conrad Schmitt flagellant, king of Thuringia, who predicted inaccurately as it turned out, that the Last Judgement would occur in 1369. In colors that were no longer vivid Schmitz gruesome face lifted out of the flames, which we're about to engulf him. The six other heretics who were burned alongside him at nordhausen in 1368, were curiously absent. A minute dab who had poured his cold tea down the sink was about to fall asleep. When you agar enter the room. She was wrapped in a blotchy shawl so huge that it trailed along the floor behind her. Her corduroy boots had been strengthened with scraps of inexpertly sewn hide from an unidentified quadruped Ed. As she removed her hat, she shattered, her sightless eyes directed at the ceiling. You must come with me, she said. A minute I've looked up. Shall I bring my luggage? he asked. It might well be for the best, replied you eager in a mysterious tone.

Unknown Speaker  09:37
Amina dab loaded himself with his three suitcases have a sack to satchels purses, vanity bag, cloth hammock bandbox band, your teen caddies and punnets gunny sack, reticule vasculature and duffel bag, tottering under the weight he made to follow you eager, but was immediately halted in his tracks when the scullery bank shot behind her. She did not respond to his cries for help. So he was forced to drop the vanity bag, bandbox, reticule, and one of the punnets wedge the door open with a handy utensil pick up the items he had let fall, noting that the bandbox was irreparably dented and hurry after. So bulky was the hammer sack, however, that a minute dad was unable to negotiate the doorway without a struggle, and by the time he was free, ubica had vanished around the corner of a sulfurous curry door. By the time he reached the spot, she was nowhere to be seen. Thinking he could hear her shawl trailing across the floorboard, somewhere in the distance, he followed on through dingy unlit corridors, up and down rotten staircases, through rooms empty of furniture or life, past gigantic indoor fountains, conservatories filled with stinking poisonous spiky foliage, lumber rooms, bookcases stacked with additions of the novels of Ayn Rand. cavernous halls, store rooms full of half dismantled pry sickles ladders, crammed with tins of soup, chambers, parlors and cubicles, ventilation shafts, dust holes, and laundry rooms. hours passed before he admitted to himself that he was lost

Unknown Speaker  12:02
is for food. In dietary matters, Blodgett deferred to the cook Mrs. purgative. She was a woman of regular habits and iron will. Every day she prepared for cauldrons of boiling soup for consumption at dawn, mid morning, mid afternoon and dusk. Each soup was prepared from a different recipe, though Mrs. purgative preferred the antique spelling receipt. The first soup was a thin, clear broth flavored with kidneys, minnows and saffron. The second soup was thick and lumpy, more like a stew or what the Bible calls a pottage. Its main ingredients were curds, feverfew, whelks, gin, blood oranges, and a sort of putting a sponge of unknown provenance. The third soup consisted mostly of duck pond water into which Mrs. purgative hold delphiniums muffins, pike and herring lights, parsley, cocoa and masa harina eggs, toffee apples and cake crumbs. her greatest achievement though was the fourth soup. The recipe had taken her years to bring to perfection. The base was a thick paste of mugwort the pulp of runner beans, finely ground crocus's and mustard. This was diluted with boiling duck pond water and left to stand for a week uncovered out in a field brought back to the kitchen, the topmost layer of scurf and froth would be drawn off and used as a filling for small pancakes with an OTC flavor. The pancakes would be tossed into the soup together with mayonnaise cream crackers, bloaters pemmican, tulip brutes agar, an ox head krill, the crushed bones of a swan way turmeric marmalade grossed badgers, brains and spinach boiled until it had the consistency of mush, the soup would be thinned out with the addition of yet more duck pond water and egg custard Sherry, and then garnished with Brazil nuts and semi chewed celery sticks. Mrs. purgative usually asked Blodgett to do the preparatory chewing. At quarterly intervals through the year, she cooked an ample supply of each of the four soups. She then supervise the canning process, which was carried out in a small factory in the grounds of the house. Once tinned the soup was stored in ladders from where Blodgett or other Blodgett like figures would collect daily supplies. As far as can be ascertained, the soup was the only sustenance officially available in there. House. Oh, apart from cups of tea Of course. Je is for Gabby TAs. The bloodroot figure on the second and third floors of the house was known as Gabby TAs, although this was not the name he had been born with. Like Blodgett he had been in place for as long as anyone could remember. His nose ran. He was clumsy, His disposition was as bleak and unforgiving as Blodgett. Gabby TAs was astonishingly tall, almost seven and a half feet, and his eyes were permanently bloodshot, which we'll meet with him again, you can count on it. I is for her Bruce Percy's. In ancient Rome, the heresies were an order of priests who made prophecies by examining the steaming and trails of sacrificially slaughtered animals. Dr. cat had made a thorough study of their methods, and for the last 10 years, had been engaging in experiments to carry out successful her Russification, using mashed potatoes instead of n trails. ably assisted by Rahu gu and others, Dr. CAC would lay out the field, a triangular cloth weighted down at each corner by a small piece of Bakelite. onto this, a precisely measured amount of mashed potato would be splattered with the agency of an iron spatula. A second triangular cloth would be placed to top the resulting mess and pressed down evenly. The upper cloth would then be turned over, and the pattern created by the mashed potato which had adhered to it would be examined with great care. Roo who used his box camera to make a photographic record.

Unknown Speaker  16:58
divination completed and notes and annotations penciled into the foolscap ledger, the cloth triangles would be scrubbed clean with a special detergent in readiness for the next experiment. There were arguments of course, move insisted that only certain potato varieties were sufficiently numinous. As she put it, Maris Pipers majestics and Aaron banners met with her approval. trellis maintained that the waxy texture of the red Craig royal potato made it the only suitable variety. strobe said the cloth sought to be hexagonal. The unhinged juggle went so far as to suggest using boiled and mashed celery instead. Whoo hoo hoo mediated between the factions protecting Dr. CAC from turmoil and strife, leaving him free to pour over the foolscap ledger, frowning, wrapped, determined to eat from it, whatever revelations it harbored.

Unknown Speaker  18:31
I is for index. Like the novelist Samuel Richardson, Dr. CAC was an enthusiastic indexer of his own work. Even before he arrived at the house, he had been issuing his Bulletin of potato science and related matters every quarter, the bulk of the content he wrote himself, allowing the occasional contribution from Rahu moop trellis and the others. Only jable had been barred from its pages because jable was unhinged. Every five years Dr. CAC, published as a separate volume, a Cumulative Index to the bullet in his skills lay in thematic rather than purely alphabetic indexing. Indeed, Scrooge has remarked that like Prinz history Oh mastics 1633 Dr. cacs indices are often more readable than the texts from which they are. of the most recent edition of the quinquennial collection of instructive sentiments Maxim's descriptions, footnotes evasions, queries and accusations contained in the bulletin of potato science and related matters, digested under proper heads screwed reported that he was, quote, driven to hilarity unquote, by the entry for potato cyst eel worm an infection which stunts and withers the crop, with home dying down prematurely and tubers, the size of marbles resulting. Of course, Scrooge cannot always be trusted for he is a deceitful toad. There are those who assert that he has never read a single word of Dr. cacs. majestic works, indeed, that he has never read a single potato related text in his entire sorry life.

Unknown Speaker  20:34
Try is for trouble. You are already aware that drawable was unhinged. This had come to light very early in his days at the house so long ago that no one not even Blodgett could recall precisely what had happened. There were occasional mutterings about a cravat and a thunderstorm, but nothing of substance. When Dr. cat had arrived with his hideously food splattered entourage, trouble had ingratiated himself immediately, he helped the true biologists to move into the leaking building, tirelessly destroying with his bazooka, the piles of accumulated waste materials that had been stored there. He hung their hats up to dry after rainfall. He sharpen their pencils. There were other kindnesses within weeks Dr. Cat could formerly pronounced him as a bona fide asst potato person, job all busied himself researching powdery scab wireworm and sprang he worked hard, and Dr. CAC began to trust him with the more tray aspect of potato science. But As the years passed, Jabal became ever more unhinged. He was often to be found in uproarious Caruso with you eager, the two of them pouring vast quantities of dandelion and burdock down their throats and singing in human songs. his moustache grew outlandish, and was forever smeared with lemon curd and other sinister curds. He will Hawthorns in his hair and carried tiny abominable her monkey lie in the pockets of his Macintosh. Dr Kak had to have words with him on this score for the potato scientist was not a man to tolerate orthodox raincoats. K is for kleptomania morose and insignificant dyspeptic and cruel. Blodgett was also a kleptomaniac. He would have stolen his own head given the opportunity. Oh, the things the man brought back from his robberies, pins, litmus paper, zinc, gorse pie crust, not even you eager knew where Blodgett stashed everything or how he disposed of it all. yubico was relentless. She listened out for Blodgett concealed behind parapets, shrubberies false ceilings, she pride and spied without success. Then she questioned him directly. She tied him to a chair and shrubbery tuck a lamp into his eyes, puffing the smoke from her cheroot into his face. He coughed, but was otherwise uncommunicative. Later, she tried wheeling and dealing, but that didn't work either. Blodgett remained wholly uncannily silent. And still, he accumulated tuning forks, dish cloths, courses, own and ironmongery tin baths, cupcake mixture, the heads of oxen, and whisks, and still these things vanished somehow, as if they had never existed in the first place like trellis. L is for ladders. The tins of soup was stored in a plethora of ladders dotted throughout the house. Although the location of each ladder seemed random, to adjacent here, another just down the corridor and around the corner, one tiny solitary larder in the West Wing. In fact, they were distributed according to a system so stupendous and abstruse that only Mrs. purgative understood it. Blodgett claim to understand it, and no one was confident enough of their own knowledge to challenge in a minute dad, having arrived at the house and the hours before was unaware that there was even a system in the first place. All he knew for certain was that he was slumped queasy with exhaustion on the floor of a ladder stacked floor to ceiling with soup tins marked number three. He had given up the quest for you ago, half his luggage had been abandoned somewhere back in an illness. corridor which stank of porridge. Although there was no porridge to be found in it, he still have the other half of his belongings with him and was rummaging frantically in one of his satchels for the bag of gobstoppers. He had packed at the start of his journey three weeks ago. As his trembling fingers lit at last upon the crumpled bag, he heard footsteps approaching. lurching to his feet, he threw up in the door of the ladder in desperation, had you eager come to rescue him?

Unknown Speaker  25:39
M is for moop moves shoes had been shoved into a red plastic base and on the floor underneath her sink. Each true biologist had their own sink. Dr. CAC, who had two sinks had insisted upon it moop did not use her sink very often. She was more of a field worker scurrying about the grounds armed with a plethora of ludicrous scientific equipment, trailing wires and molds behind her as she darted from potato patch to potato patch, scribbling drivel into her notebook with an exciting new propelling pencil. She was a sly one was moop she wrote in glagolitic script to safeguard her memoranda from prying eyes. Several of her project had only a tangential relationship to Dr. Katz researches had he been known

Unknown Speaker  27:08
and is for night. High above the house fat stars sparkled in the firmament, unimaginable life forms, how old and how old in the darkness. colonies of nocturnal insects hovered in the air at human head height, buzzing and tagging. Blodgett patrolled the ground floor, rattling a monstrous collection of keys, slamming door shot, sounding the toxins, testing the shutters, checking his fly traps. As he passed the room of distressed wooden bitterns, he heard the unmistakable sound of you eager and juggle, slurping and belching. They had locked themselves in of course, and barred the door with one of the dandelion and burdock barrels from which they would drink until they were a gaseous, gassy, could be. Blodgett loath to them. On the floor above, in one of the ladders a minute I was embroiled in a fervent debate with trellis who would come upon him quite by accident. After some initial hesitation, they have discovered a mutual interest in something or other Beatles poisonous golden toads, David Blunkett, the darling of frayed flags, it could have been anything, it hardly matters. It's also tiresome. You may as well be listening to penitential tracked by a horse for all the good It will do you. Night has fallen about the house under the twinkling stars. That will do and that will indeed do for this week. That was the first half of the immense duck pond pamphlet. The second half beginning out is for Olga, and ending with Zed is for something I'm not going to tell you. Same time next week, four o'clock on resonance 104 point four event. Have a good week. Bye bye
