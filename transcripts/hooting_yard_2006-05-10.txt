Good afternoon. This is hooting out on the air. My name is Frank key, and I'm gonna read to you for half an hour. Last week's show was the first half of the immense duck pond pamphlet. Beginning with a is for a minute dab and ending with n is for night. Fact it went just over halfway got to N in the alphabet. And the ended night has fallen about the house under the twinkling stars that will do and so we move on with Oh is for Olga. The next day all hell broke loose. Early in the morning as Blodgett polished the outside spigots an ogre or wild man Hove interview atop the southern hills. Its progress towards the house was implacable. It stamped through the Bracken vaulted the haha with a single bound, negotiated the massive bass old wall with surprising elegance and sprang towards the terrified Blodgett whirling its hirsute arms alarmingly, and making disgusting guttural noises. It was matted with filth, flies, gnats, and tiny things emitting poisonous goo crawled all over its flesh. It seemed to be decomposing it drawled. It picked up Blodgett sank its fangs into his skull, and hold him aside. pausing momentarily to spit out particles of Blodgett head, it smashed its way through the wall of the house, oblivious to the fact that there was an ajar door three feet to its right. Once inside the house, its rage seemed to increase. It rushed wildly from room to room, obliterating the furniture, tearing up floorboards, destroying chandeliers, bashing holes into walls and ceilings, sucking the wallpaper off the walls. It chewed up Bannister rails and regurgitated them, discouraging them with such force that each rail acted as a lethal projectile. At least one urchin was impaled as a result. Five minutes after the ogres arrival, much of the lower part of the house lay in ruins. Small files were starting, but they were doused by water spurting from uprooted taps. You hugger and dribble was still sprawled in the room of distressed wooden bitterns. When the ogre eventually came upon them, it left out an inhuman cry. It picked us it's sores, it became becomed. fixing it with a bemused stare jable rose to his feet. You know, there might still be some dandelion and burdock left, he said, Would you care for a drop? The ogre pounded its fists against its own head. Then it blinked shuddered, twitched. Trouble pushed a tin mug into its poor. It got the sweet mark down greedily, then threw the mug back at dribble, missing his air by whisker something and it's manner seem to change by now blind you eager to was on her feet. She sniffed at the violent pongs emanating from the ogre, then stepped towards it. Thank heaven you have come, she said. trouble. Meet my dear friend, Detective Captain undescribed not Taub. He comes from a far country and his brain is hot.

P is for plan area. glagolitic script was invented in the latter half of the ninth century by the monk several, who is better known for having devised the alphabet which bears his name Cyrillic glagolitic was designed to provide a written rendering of old Slavonic, the language spoken by the moravians, among whom Cyril and his brother methodius were carrying out their holy work the word galego or Wow, cannot easily be translated into English. Its meaning involve the sound of bells and the call to the glory of God in worship. moop seems not to have considered such associations when one considers the subject matter of her secretive glagolitic scribblings she was embroiled in the study of a fiendish species of flatworms known as plan area, which kill and feed on earthworms. The vile flatworms excrete an enzyme like a narcotic drug that paralyzes an earthworm completely. Then they excrete another that dissolve the worm into a sort of soup. Then they suck it up in the space of half an hour. All that remains is a trace of soil from the earthworms stomach. Plan area are successful because they have no known predators. Having no muscles, these hideous flatworms simply fall apart if any attempt is made to eat them, like a vagabond horde plan area are highly mobile wiping out all the earthworms in one area before moving on relentlessly to another. It is not difficult to imagine what havoc moop could wreak in Dr. cacs potato patches by introducing a gang of killer flatworms. Let us remember that the good doctor had entitled A special issue of his bulletin. Let us now sing the praises of the humble earthworm. So essential was its contribution to potato cultivation. Q is for quintain. Roo who goes tank rumbles to a halt outside the leaking building. He clambered to the ground the burnt quintain steady in his grasp. He no longer cared that jable had almost destroyed it on one of his bonfires. Rue who had managed to rescue it it rescue it in the nick of time, singeing his elegantly manicured hands as he did so he knew that he would need the quintain again. Otherwise, he would have nothing to tilt at on the day of the torgny. So now he seldom let it out of his sight, taking it with him even on his regular tank maneuvers. Of course, Rue who had reported troubles pyromaniac or tendencies to Dr. CAC, but his mentor had been preoccupied so often in recent weeks, Dr. CAC seemed a world away. ruhiger thought it best to leave in B. As the doctor moped and frowned. his brow furrowed, a petite a potato in each hand, a potato in each of his innumerable pockets, a potato balanced precariously atop his hat. Even a small potato lodged in his mouth. Like the wild boy of Evo ROM. He would utter shrill cries if his potatoes were taken away from him. Ah is for rigor mortis. It will come as no surprise to reveal that the corpse bundled up in burlap in the pointless heart was that of Dr. CAC, he had not been seen for some days. It is worth noting that because of the presence of potatoes in and about his body, rigor mortis had been delayed. Dr. cacs corpse was floppy and malleable, like a floppy and malleable thing by dint of a variety of chemical compounds present within the experimental potatoes and their interaction, both with the cadaver and with the stifling fog of the pointless heart. The names of the chemical compounds are so lengthy and so hard to pronounce, that they shall not detain us here.

As is for Spats in the room of distressed wooden bitterns. You get cracked open another bottle of dandelion and burdock celebrations were in order. She and detective Captain unstrap. Bernard Taub had not met for 15 years since that time in the airplane hangar then You ago had just returned from slot where she had torn some paper, arched her back like a cat and stood next to a damn. Um, scrub not towel was at the hangar to meet her brandishing a trumpet. At this stage in his career, he looked not unlike a Hungarian fairground proprietor. He was Spats. He had gambled at you bigger importantly, but his command of human languages was not good. And she had difficulty understanding him. Eventually, she had snatched the trumpet from him and beat him over their head with it repeatedly stopping him in made a gavel. Then she pushed him into a cart and rattled off to the house. Now, after all those years, they had a lot to catch up on. The walls of the room shook his unstrapping Taleb told his anecdotes in booming cataclysmic roars. troubles shoved party in tears is to double a racket. But you eager seemed unperturbed, regularly refilling their 10 mugs and badgering the detective Captain with questions. What had happened to his spat? Was it true that he had arrested the notorious strangler babinski and shaved off his bristly side whiskers? Was his brain hot. Did moths fly about his head? Did he make crunching noises? Why had he not come sooner? Um, strobe nods Taub, flicking gnats and Hornets away from his head smashed up the empty dandelion and burdock bottles with a single flak from his huge and hairy fists. He had his own question for you ago. What had become of his trusty assistant aminah dab. T is for trellis. trellis was May a figment vapor. He appeared to different people at different times as a sort of Phantom. He was a tabula rasa, onto which those who met him inscribe their dreams, their yearnings, their hallucinations. All that is except Blodgett, in whose presence trellis took on a terrifying reality. He would sniffle and Blodgett would have to mop up the snellings with his filthy shirt cuff. He would mule and Blodgett would thump him on the head, bruising his fist in the process. After detective Captain unstrap nods towel chewed up part of his head, Blodgett relationship with trellis became even more intimate. trellis would tell Blodgett all about the weather in Finland, and the nature of ice and give him planks and show him our bee men. He would invoke disastrous plutonian gods and have them frolic miniaturized before Blodgett sighs, occasionally tweaking their hairs from his nostrils. In return, Blodgett gave trellis extra helpings of soup when stirred his frail illness, concocted, diverting bedtime stories and nautical yarns and plied him with raspberries. Together, they plotted dark and criminal deeds.

You is for unstrap not town. I shall soon be in a position to make an arrest. growled detective Captain unstrapping. Not towel but breakfast the next morning. hummingbirds revolved around his head. The scullery had been all but obliterated during the master detectives frenzied arrival, and for their breakfast soup. The relevant characters had gathered in the stinking yard. Like the previous night, as the moon shimmered in the black sky, unstrap an old towel, but come upon Dr. cacs. Cortes using detection magnets and guided by his back like in a radar. It had taken him just minutes to pinpoint the whereabouts of the dead potato scientist. his immediate diagnosis was that Dr. cat had been slain with a whelk, a battery and a puddle of bleach. further than that he would not go for the time being. The mysterious presence of on mangry escaped his notice his confidence that breakfast astonished even you eager, you know who did the deed she screeched. Let me say this how old scribbling or detailed shoveling small insects down his gullet and uprooting Titanic cedars from the mud. I delay only so that I can compare notes with my esteemed colleague, the sleuth amminadab. He may be in possession of facts material to this foul deed of information to which I am not privy despite my genius. His methods are obscure but unfailing in their accuracy. For sleuth amminadab, always carries with him in either his satchel or his reticule, a small rectangular tin filled with pastels of a bauxite like substance, which is not actually bauxite itself. He carries to a portable kiln ignited with a simple household match. The kiln is coated on the inside with a fuel which produces a temperature of 1000s of degrees Fahrenheit, within two seconds of being lit. It is most uncanny, but I have witnessed this happen with my own eyes, or rather I into this tiny furnace. amminadab places one of his non bauxite pastels using a long thin pair of tongs, which he carried about with him in a special compartment sewn into one leg of his pantaloons. He is a resourceful fellow, the sleuth amminadab 10 hours later, when the kiln has cooled, he prizes open it tiny hatch extracts the charred remains of the pastel and smears it in his hair and upon his brow. Then he packs up the portable kiln after applying a fresh coating of his inexplicable fuel, replaces it in his reticule or sexual and goes about his business. Detective Captain on streb No, Taub stopped howling and beat his fists on the table, smashing it to pieces. And how does this help him solve the case? asked the language juggle. And streb not talb sank his fangs into a passing horse before responding. It has nothing to do with the deductive abilities of the sleuth amminadab. he roared. I merely wish to entertain you at breakfast with an anecdote about his untoward personal habits. It began to rain.

The is for violence, and the violence is such that this entire section of the story has been obliterated. W is for water. There were 26 ponds in the grounds of the house of varying sizes. 16 of them were ponds and 10 wood duck ponds. One of the duck pond was immense. It had claims to be a lake there was so much water in it. Move trudged around this immense duck pond, her gaze fixed on the mud through which she tried an hour earlier, she had stolen Blodgett windcheater while his back was turned, it was far too big for it was far too big for Blodgett, and the hood hid her head completely. She was plunged in reverie. Every now and then she stops charging and picks up a pebble to hurl into the immense duck pond, disturbing the eerily calm surface of the water. She wondered if the frenzied creature on strep not Taub would arrest trellis actually began her 15 circuit of the duck pond. The water was disturbed by something larger than her pebbles. With a sonic churning and squelching something hideous and scarcely describable rose to the surface. It was thinned and scaled, but moved with robotic precision. It appeared to have a teeming mass of eyes 1000s of jellied globules quivering on this stalks, it made no noise. At the sight of it, nearby ducks suffered heart attacks and perished. Moon had more presence of mind than a duck, unleashing a large net she threw it over the hell spawn the aquatic beast thing, then standard with a dart from her blowpipe binding it firmly with a length of stolen rope. She found curled in a pocket of Blodgett wind treater, she began to drag the nightmare being back to the lake building it might possibly prove useful in her anti potato research, she reflected. She had gone barely 10 paces when the duck pond monster unaccountably slipped its bonds and whacked her on the skull with one of its mighty flippers, knocking her unconscious.

X is for x. With his mighty pour detective Captain unstrap, nada towel was about to scratch a bloody x on the forehead of Dr. cacs murderer. When his esteemed colleague the sleuth amminadab, came crashing onto the scene. He was carrying a Punnett full to the brim with Alden in quencher control, old and in consequential object, which we proceeded to describe to unstrap not Talbot length. Listeners avid for the detailed should send me an email headed, please tell me what was in the sleuth a minute dad is bringing Punnett to which I will reply individually to the point of tedium. But a minute ABS rambling drivel cannot be allowed to keep us from the denouement of this exciting story. Harsh, harsh amminadab you are a sleuth about whom legends will accrete, but for but for the love of god Hold your tongue screeched on scribblenauts town, setting fire to a small herb garden with a blast of his breath. I mean, a dab unzipped himself from his terrifying aquatic monster costume and placed his palate on a flagstone next to one of Blodgett flytraps you would do well to pay attention to my rambling drivel detective Captain unstrapped Ned towel he said. For it is me because I carry with me at all times a vial of cassava serum that I'm able to assist you in bringing this case to a satisfactory conclusion. The deranged potato scientist moop stunned me with an incredibly powerful poisonous Dart from her blowpipe by writes, I should be in a coma. As it is. I have a split second in which to bite on a serum pill and thus, outwit her detective Captain on streb nada Taub clawed at the sky wailing horribly, very clever. I'm in a dab, but stop calling me on the scrub needs towel. Damn you. While the two detectives were occupied with this banter, the culprit fled into the crumbling ruins of the house forehead, yet are marked with an x. y is for yours. Blodgett suffered dreadfully from yours, but the condition cannot excuse his behavior. Yours is also known as Fran Vizier. Blodgett was also known as jable. The deception had been difficult. Sometimes he'd had to be in two places at once. moop had been willing to impersonate him from time to time, no questions asked. She had been a useful ally, but he had begun to distrust her. She would be the next to go after Rahu preening his mustachios he cackled as if he were a character in a 19th century melodrama. Zed is for zinco graph. The sleuth amminadab felt it was time to retire. This had been his 10,000th case quite enough for any detective he unstrapped Ned Taub or unstrap not towel, whatever his name was, had parted as dawn broke on the Thursday morning. They had stood triumphantly arm in arm, each with a foot or in unstrap not towns case, more properly, a hoof planted on the dead body of Blodgett or dribble. The End had been horrifying and very messy. They had had to call on you eager to help. And by the time they realized the Scimitar had not been sharpened, it was too late. Afterwards, you will get a MOOC got rid of the corpse, the distance splash lead amminadab to conclude that Blodgett juggles body ended up in one of the 26 palms, but he didn't really care which one. Three weeks later, when he returned home, he wrote up the Cases usual, fueled by dandelion and burdock, and Bill's grew burns. He sat late into the night engraving his zinco graphs. Half of what he wrote was lies Of course, and streb, not Tarot, partly featured in the aminuddin version, movement trellis virtually disappeared. Although he awarded them a footnote in a sentimental moment.

He was as usual, merciless with himself. If anyone ever bothered to read the narrative, they would surely conclude that the sleuth amminadab didn't have a clue what was going on, and still didn't twig what it actually happened. Even at the end, as he bid farewell to detective Captain unstrapped not town is absurd agglomeration of luggage long abandoned, safe for the planet and reticule, enormous birds beating their enormous wings around him as he stood ankle deep in mud, weird and hapless at the very edge of the immense duck pond.

So that was the end of the immense duck pond pamphlet. And and there's a little bit of time left over. So I thought the hooting er postbag was Nord by shrews over the weekend, rendering much of the correspondence indecipherable still, it's a timely reminder that many listeners have been waiting patiently for answers to their questions. So here's a quick Roundup. I don't really have time for the questions. So. For those listeners, who sent in questions, they will know the answer to your question. Tim from Swanage stay in your pod. Maisie from crows an RA, I think you may have inadvertently downloaded this fellow podcast, put it in a bucket filled to the brim with brine and take it to the seaside Arpad from Helsinki. The correct pronunciation is new Gar Dave from the old boathouse, you are in grave peril. Try to escape from your pod as soon as you can. Constance from Verona. I'm afraid your letter is one of the most thoroughly Nord ones and I'm unable to read a word of it. Ingmar from Spokane trip up the salary first, then trap the flies. Your mother's brooch has fallen behind the dresser. You will find solace in pole vaulting. On Thursday, you will receive news from afar, but do not act upon it, or the cosmos will be plunged into 20 billion years of apocalyptic ballyhoo.

That's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week. I'll leave you with a brief quotation from ello Howard and FC bishops extremely useful book the house fly and how to suppress it. The true housefly is very abundant in localities, where little or no horse manure is found. And in such cases, it breeds in other manure, such as chicken manure in backyard poultry lots, or in slops, or fermenting vegetable material, such as spent hot, moist brand in stylage, or rotting potatoes. And I've promised not to mention potatoes for at least another two weeks, or possibly three. That's all for this week. Bye bye.
