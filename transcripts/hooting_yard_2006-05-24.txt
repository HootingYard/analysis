Good afternoon This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. I'm going to devote this week's show to reading a lengthy story called 40 visits to the worm farm given the the the lovably, slapdash, amateur ism of looting yard, I'm not entirely sure, but there's time to read the whole story in this show. I haven't worked that out. I'm sure you don't mind. And if I don't finish it, I just finished it next week. The story is from a paperback book of mine called twitching and shattered. And this was published as long ago as 1989. Very rare, there were only over 300 copies printed and if you would like a chance to own a rare copy of this one has been found and mint copy. And it's currently being auctioned on eBay. With all proceeds going to the hooting yard, but Neverland fund for distressed out of print pamphlet is if you go to podcasts dot resonance fm.com scroll down and you'll find further details of how to how to put in your bed for this wonderful book. Anyway, I'm going to read some of it to you. And this is called 40 visits to the worm farm. One by bicycle, a number of the spokes went awry and I had to walk the last half mile. A member of staff at the worm farm promised to have the bicycle fixed for me. I handed over a soiled five pound notes to cover the cost of repair and caught the bus home to by bus thrilled to distraction at the prospect of the return of my trusty bicycle. The past week had been harrowing. I had hardly stepped outside my allotment shed. It was pouring with rain. A party of disheveled geese had set up a temporary shelter the entrance to the worm farm. The farm itself was in disarray. Canute hellhound, Director of Research had locked himself inside the staff canteen, brandishing a pitchfork and threatening to impale several members of staff on it. desperate attempts were being made to contact his doctor. I felt ravaged by my insignificance and left the scene at once. on the bus home, I realized that a diet that I did not know the name of the woman who had promised to mend my bicycle, and had only a dim recollection of her appearance. Three The next day, the man who grows turnips on the allotment next to mine offered to give me a lift to the worm farm. He said he would be passing that way. In the car. He told me that his son worked as an engineer in Swanage, and that his daughter had been awarded the Order of Lenin. I wanted to ask him why he grew nothing but turnips on his plot, but was unable to steer the conversation in the right direction. He was unable to steer his car in the right direction. We arrived at hooting yard without having passed the worm farm. He seemed dreadfully embarrassed and began to unfold an enormous roadmap. It was so dog eared that the fold threatened to become rips and in some cases had already done so. His forefinger trailed aimlessly over the map. unable to locate the worm farm. He apologized with a sincerity that rattled me. I said that it really didn't matter, and that I would find my way on foot. I got out of the car. I had no idea where I was. I spoke to a few passers by to ask directions, and was all struck by their ram accents and bearing no one was able to help me. I was unnerved by the lopsided gait which seemed to afflict all the inhabitants of hooting yard and by their sickly powers, I felt as if I was in a foreign land. The smell of turpentine hung heavy in the air. I took refuge in a pub, instead of carpeting or floorboards that was sticky gravel underfoot. The beer tasted vile, but I settled to it and got riotously drunk, so much so that my memory is impaired. Oh, I get the occasional shudder of recollection. A pack of Wolfhounds, two men carrying a winding sheet, a bottle of bleach with a loose lid, but I'm still unable to work out quite what happened. Later that day, or perhaps another day, I don't know. I came to with a massive hangover at my mother's house. She screwed my room with temperance tracked and refused to speak to me for a week.

For another abortive trip to the worm farm, the bus was waylaid by highwayman in period costume. They took my watch and an aisle by row which I treasured. Following this incident, the bus driver immediately turned around and drove back to the Depo to file a full report. Five, weighed down by a huge roll of bays which I had promised to deliver to my aunt. I waited an hour for the bus. Luckily, the trip passed without incident. Arriving at the worm farm, I was met at the gates by Knute hellhound. He took me to one side and began to decline at length on the need for more whisks. Something in his manner transfixed me, his high pitched jabbering, rising to shrieks and how's that particularly pertinent moments in his discourse, was absolutely hypnotic. I think we must have walked around the perimeter fence 12 or 13 times as his infused proclamations made me more and more convinced that there were not enough whisks. Then I realized that I had left my babies on the bus. I panicked, and stammering apologetic rubbish to Knute hellhound made off at once to catch the bus to the Depo. an hour or so later, I arrived to find that the Depo had been struck by lightning. damage was limited, but my base had been entirely incinerated. I wept. First my bicycle, which as time went on, seemed lost forever. And now the bays. Perhaps everything I owned, that began with be would be taken from me. Some malign figure who did no doubt interact in a grisly shift would steal away my books, my balaclava, my beekeeping utensils, and my blunderbuss. Tears streamed down my face. Perhaps even my breakfast would be whipped away from the table before I had a chance to tuck into it. ghastly visions of the future swept before me. I swooned.

Six Monday, can you hellhound arrived for his first day at work? He had been overjoyed to gain this appointment, Director of Research at the finest worm farm in the land. He drooled at the very thought he can use impetigo hellhound son of humble tourniquet listeners had scaled the heights. A Salah urchin ushered him into his office, and the first blow of disappointment hit him. There was too much wood in the room, nearly all of the furniture and most of the fixtures or wooden, it could not be countenanced. He must make a firm stand from the very beginning. beckoning the urge in back into the office, he delivered his first command in ringing tones. Factory a flame thrower, you young scallywag, Rod hellhound. Seven Tuesday, Knute hellhound sat on the floor in the charred shell of his office, dallying with an ear wig, which he had interrupted in its innocent track across the room. He wondered if it was a deformed worm. Here was something he could research thoroughly placing the earwig in a small dish he strode off to the lab, it was deserted. Most of the exciting scientific equipment had been packed away Higgledy Piggledy in cupboards to make room for about 30 broken bicycles, which was strewn all over the lab, can you hellhound pondered the meaning of these funny metallic constructions. Even one from the floor he laid it on its side on a worktop and mucked about with the wheels and the saddle height adjuster. He was deeply impressed, carefully placing the earwig on one of the flat tires. He rummaged around in the cupboards until he found the time lapse photography equipment. It took him all afternoon to set it up. Ah, but what an afternoon worth at least a page or two when the definitive history of scientific achievement came to be written. hellhound begins smugly he could feel his destiny beginning to enfold him in it's warm and muskie wraps. Eight wetness day hellhound failed to turn up for work. Research at the worm farm came to a standstill. At 10:30am. The personnel and plumbing director rang his home. There was no reply. In fact, Canute hellhound was on the premises. Since the small hours he had been perched unsteadily on the roof of the worm farm staff dancehall whittling away at a plank of wood. From time to time, he peered off into the distance through his homemade rubbery telescope. His vantage point afforded him a stupendous view. Although a chill had began to set into his bones. Nine, the pitchfork canteen incident Thursday, many questions remain. Where did hellhound acquire the pitchfork? Why did he paint it blue? Whose paint did he use? Was the paint bought or stolen? Was the paint still wet? If so, did it stain hellhounds hands? Or was he wearing gloves? Of what fabric? Whether gloves woven? Was it wool? If so had hellhound personally shared a sheep? Did he know how to without injuring the sheep? If he did injure the sheep? Did the sheep survive? If not, was it death mourned? Where was it buried? Did hellhound accept responsibility? Did he attend a short service in commemoration of the sheep? Did he read out a moving prayer from the pulpit? Was he a religious man at the best of times? When were the best of times? Did hellhound realize they were the best? Or did he think them merely mediocre? How did he arrive at this judgment? Why was he so averse to would 10 Friday extract from Knute hellhounds for our lecture delivered to the 2000 staff of the worm farm in the great worm farm assembly hall. Good morning. He said I stand before you wearing a tweed suit. tweed suits me I know. I know too, that it is the cloth of weakness of dispersal does your truth and ruin. But I'm not here to discuss the language of fabric. I am here to give you the benefit of my long years of research into our friends the worms. At this point, hellhound flourishes a set of superbly intricate diagrams from beneath his jacket and hangs them up with clothes pegs. He talks at length on each diagram. His voice rises with excitement. His eyes become glazed with fanaticism. His arms gesticulate in an infused manner. He says things like

40 visits to the worm farm part 11 Violetta returned to the worm farm Night carrying her puncture repair kit and made straight for the lab. Luckily the search lights were broken. She jimmied the door open with her spatula and stepped inside. She could not risk turning the lights on. So she paused to allow her eyes to become accustomed to the darkness. When they had done so, she was nonplussed. Her bicycles had vanished. in their place, a massive contraction of indeterminate purpose had been installed. At one point the ceiling had been knocked through to make room for it. It took her a few moments to realize what had happened. The bicycles, or at least their constituent parts, were still there in the lab, they had been systematically taken to pieces and reassembled into this monstrous mechanism. She was unsure how to react if she made overt investigations or tampered with the contraption, her calumny would surely come to light. Yet, how could she bear to abandon her scheme now? It's so crucial juncture. tiptoeing from the lab, she crept away from the worm farm in the darkness to ponder her dilemma. 12 she returned to the lab The following night. This time she brought with her a panoply of tools and mechanical bits and pieces, capable of carrying out almost any technical reconstruction work she could think of. She had decided to take the purposeless contraption to bits and to reassemble her bicycles one by one, it would not be possible to complete her task in a single night, but she had contingency plans. demented violence was not beyond her. nerve gas and dangerous chemical compounds were a language she understood. Before entering the lab, she made a detour to the squalid outbuildings on the edge of the worm farm and collected a few bags of cement, animal waste and gritty particles. She had been awake all day plotting this escapade in fine detail and left nothing to chance. stowing the sacks by the porch, she entered the lab as before. Again, she was nonplussed. This time, that contraption itself had vanished. All trace of her broken bicycles was gone. The hole in the ceiling had been repaired in a rudimentary fashion with rush matting. She spent four hours searching the entire premises until dawn, she found nothing 13 her sawtooth jet with it delicate knobs and extra sensitive Rosie h bellerophon system circle low over the worm farm. bleeping monitors in the cockpit recorded triggered signal delay codes and converted them into a veritable broth of gobbledygook, which we would later be able to decipher the potato building. The scanners picked up something lascivious and untoward from the worm farm chaplaincy. She stared the plane around and swoop in low once more. Below, she could see Knute hellhound, skirting the perimeter fence of wooden carving of a swordfish tucked under his arm. She had grounds for suspecting that he was the man who had tampered with her bicycles. on impulse, she decided to strafe him, setting the control so automatic she climbed up into the gun turret. Just as she was about to let loose a volley of lethal gunfire. The jet nosedived unaccountably and plunged into a lake. She was lucky to escape with her life. 14 assuming the sallow urge in disguise took about an hour. In an ante room within the potato building. She greased her hair down applied flour and a yellow waxy substance to her face and donned the grayish brown rags. Their stench repelled her but the deceit was necessary. Once the disguise was complete, with a steel rod shoved down one trouser leg. She practiced her drool in front of the mirror and gave her greasy for log a few experimental tugs perfect lurching and limping urchin like to hell hounds office she snuggled and hung her head as expected, he summoned her at once.

There you are, young fellow me, lad. Go and get me some mountaineering pythons this instant. She had grown used to his despotic manner, and bowing her head made as if to scamper off in self effacing fashion. As soon as she was out of the door, she heard Canute hellhound pick up the phone and dial. She waited, listening intently. She heard only snatches of his conversation. Another swindling attack bauxite clumps of hay destitution is febrifuge German blood oranges halitosis, impermanence, Judgment Day kept hooting laboratorial mishmash no drugs worth their salt obesogens pestilential Quisling mouths flibbertigibbet rented socks smudged turnip soup, ungodly vilela by the minute whisks. x rays are not hollyhocks. You can marginally swine Zoo brain pack. He was on the phone to that elderberry wrench again, obviously, Violetta made a low huffing sound and set off for the warehouse actually crossed the grit circles she stopped in her tracks. Perhaps elderberry was an accomplice in the heinous mutilation of her bicycles. tearing off her greasy wagon, wrenching the steel rod out of a trouser leg, she turned around and pelted back to the potato building. Strictly speaking, it was not part of the worm farm, but it had been next to it and the big fence enclosed it within the precinct. panting she threw open the doors, the monitors were bleeping away happily to themselves. She sat down at the Westfield console, frantically tapping measured cross referencing data into the wafer information banks, all the while throwing switches, adjusting the intricate system of pulleys and wrenching the red sarcophagus leavers off of their pointy hinges. That last her work was complete. a blip indicated that the enormous printer was about to chug out the results. Smoking desperately she waited to see what malevolence would be brought to light 15 she clambered onto the roof of the latrine. The canisters were still there, but the pods had been disturbed. That much was obvious. A Heron stood preening on the horizon, silhouetted against the setting some were was can you tell hound

40 visits to the worm farm visit number 16. He tugged at the piece of string and heard distant clanking. So far so good. That would be enough for one day. Replacing the iron helmet on his head. He fixed the bolts back into place and let dangle a delicate ribbon over the opening as a safeguard. sighing he started up the huge granite staircase holding carefully to the rail. The battery on his torch was running low. wheezing, he finally reached the top. he squeezed past the rusted portcullis and whacked the 10 tray set into the wall. There was a whirring noise and the find grille and plastic covering shifted to the left. He emerged into the light and found himself standing 10 yards away from Knute hellhound. The director of research greeted him with a grim and gritty smile. The pair shook hands.

17 elderberries canonization was not unexpected. Three Pope's had testified to being spiritually spiritually uplifted by his collected sermons, and a small religious publishing house continued to issue his diaries with their fanatic itemization of acts of charity and compassion on a regular basis. Some felt that his alleged self seeking character would disqualify him for the sainthood while still living. But the new pope had scotch these rumors in the most decisive manner. elderberries name was now ensconced firmly in the list of saints between St. eggwin and St. Elias. It had been at his own suggestion that he had been officially proclaimed the patron saint of worms, which was a partial explanation of his now daily visits to the worm farm. Here he would sprinkle holy water from the sacred wells at cocked lush on any worm whose path he happened to cross and offer devotional prayers in the worm farm chaplaincy at noon each day. Knute hellhound had issued a memorandum to the effect that any member of staff not attending these services, nor saying the prayers with sufficient gusto would be dismissed instantly, never to Sally the worm farm with their heathen presence forever more. elderberries, evangelical enthusiasm was truly infectious. members of staff were forever volunteering new ways to pay obedience to the patron saint. Huge craze of worms were carried into the daily service that they too might benefit from the light of faith shed incandescently about lavish floral decorations were hung from the entrance gates, small plaster statuettes of elderberry decked out archaically in robes and tunics were manufactured for sale in the worm farm souvenir shop. And yet, there was a more sinister purpose to the saints daily visitations he and hellhound were colluding and a project of no mean dimensions destined to shake the world. 18 Two days later, elderberry again drove to a deserted spot some three miles away from the worm farm and parked his car under a shelter of wild foliage and greenery. whacking a tin tray set into the ground. He made entrance to a fabulous network of tunnels, weaving for miles below the surface. One route took him to the wells at Cox slosh, one to turn it patch yet another to the dank cellars beneath the worm farm. It was along this third tunnel that elderberry repaired dragging along behind him the Infernal Machine made out of whisks, which he hoped would bring him another step closer to the accomplishment of his grand design. 19 via letter returning a tray of worms to its rightful abode in alpha blue wormery saw elderberry limping decisively towards the outbuildings foisting the tray upon a grizzled accomplice she made to follow him simultaneously setting the controls on her portable, arcane hooter. This would transmit anything important, back to the bleeping consoles in the potato building. elderberries frayed gray Khattak billowed behind him in the wind. Snow was forecast but have not yet fallen. He entered the most sordid of the huts, and after various complicated adjustments to a series of occult mechanisms concealed behind a rotting pile of rotting turnips, began the log and trudge down the granite staircase to the cellars as the trap door clang shot behind him. He heard the muffled sound of the hut door creaking open on its hinges. Had he been followed. He had Violetta stood in the stinking gloom bit flummoxed she had seen elderberry enter this heart, yet all trace of him advantaged dialing calculations onto the arcane hooter. She listened out for the tiniest noise, elderberry a few feet underneath her cursing that hellhound had not yet installed adequate soundproofing, tried to stifle the sound of his wheezing. Both remained like this for about a quarter of an hour, until it dawned on Violetta that her arcane hooter had been deliberately incapacitated. Her fury was demoniac she smashed the huts to pieces in her rage, thereby unknowingly destroying elderberry elderberries entry and exit system. For this rank and vital heart house the intricate network of technological mumbo jumbo, which controlled all the entrances to the sellers and their tributary tunnels. the patron saint of worms was hopelessly trapped 20

covered in old sail cloth and sacking elderberry lay shivering in the dismal cellars, the fruits of years of impossibly brilliant work stacked around him. The machine made of alabaster, the machine made of bicycles. The machine made of cork, the machine made of derailments they were all here splendid in their uselessness without the final one, the machine made of zuri buzz, which still lay in fragmentary bits of jumble in and around the turnit patch at the allotments. And now trapped as he was, he had no way of collecting it, bringing it here to assume its place among the others, he would no longer be able to carry out the last and most crucial phase of the project, the majestic synthesis of the 26 machines to create the alphabet monster, which would build a new heaven and a new earth.

As I suspected, there's just not time to finish the story this week, that was 20, the 40 visits the worm farm, there isn't actually very much of the story left, but um, no time to do it this week. And that's kind of incentive for you to tune in at the same time next week to hear the end of this and whatever else I might decide to read. So that's all for this This week. I hope you've enjoyed it. Bye bye
