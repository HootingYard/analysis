Good afternoon. This is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. And I'm going to read to you for half an hour as normal with some surprises this week, possibly. And I'm going to begin where we left off last week last week show was devoted entirely to a reading of 40 visits to the worm farm. And we got from visits number one to number 20. And I promised that I would begin this show with visits 2140. So here is the conclusion, Clint, I'm going to start again, here is the conclusion of 40 visits to the worm farm. Over the next year or so, I made desperate and repeated attempts to retrieve my bicycle. I think I must have visited the worm farm about 20 times in all eventually on st elderberries day, I lost track down the woman who so long ago had promised to mend my trusty steed. I was roaming disconsolately around the very edge of the worm farm when I saw her emerging from a sort of annex building, carrying a massive crate. Upon being confronted, she pulled out a sorry tale of such uncompromising stupidity, that I had no choice but to believe it gracefully, she returned my soiled fiver she then announced that she was leaving the worm farm to take up an appointment elsewhere. I don't know why she told me this. Apparently, she was off to Greenland to do some work involving ice, snow plows and Huskies. It seemed a bit of a change from worms I thought. She explained that she felt very bitter about the past months at the worm farm ever since Knute hellhound had taken over as director of research. I've remembered that I had had once had an exciting conversation with this man on the subject of whisks bidding via letter farewell and good luck. I walked over to hell hounds office, it seemed to have suffered from fire damage. The man who made a half hearted attempt at greeting me was better shadow, no longer declaiming in vigorous terms about whisks, or anything else come to that he sat slumped in a rickety metal chair, knocking back the best part of a bottle of hooch. There was a dead end look in his eyes, and he kept up a pathetic dirge, like moaning all the time I remained with him. After a while, I realized that he was forming, albeit in broken in articulate fashion, the same two phrases over and over again. He's in heaven, and I'm not. I tried to find out what in God's name he was going on about, but he met my inquiries with a stare of formidable, formidable vacancy. In the end, I could bear it no longer with an absurd display of affection. I patted him on the head, and must his filthy hair. Then I left the worm farm for the last time. I caught the bus back to my allotment, and spent the rest of the day in my shed planning marvelous feats with root vegetables. It began to rain, and I looked across at the ruinous state of the turnip patch. I hadn't seen my neighbor since the day he gave me an abortive lift to the worm farm. I made a sudden decision to put his allotment back into good order. eyeing the packets of turnip seeds on my shelf, I stood up, grabbed hold of my home, and walked out of the shed into the downpour.

So that was last week. And this, the entire story 40 visits of the worm farm. And now I'd like to announce a special treat the hooting yard Music Prize 2006 the rules for entry are very, very simple. You have to compose and perform a piece of music with words taken from anywhere you like on hooting yard, all the texts are read here. You can find on the hooting yard website. I'm sure regular listeners know that. So that's the first rule words from hooting yard. Second Rule is slightly more complicated. Second role is as follows. In 1895, Marie Corelli published the novel the sorrows of Satan. And in the book there is a passage in which the narrator Jeffrey Tempest, describes listening to a piece of music, which is played by a character who we don't know, but strongly suspect may be the devil. Now, this is a piece of music played at a piano. But your entry doesn't need to be a piano piece. It can be whatever you like. But the way Geoffrey Tempest, the narrator of the book describes the effect this music had listening to it. This is what you should be aiming for. So I just like to read this to you now. The music swelled into passionate cadence, melodies crossed and recrossed each other like rays of light glittering among green leaves, voices of birds and streams and tossing waterfalls chimed in with songs of love and playful merriment and non came while the strains of grief and angry clamor. cries of despair were heard echoing through the thunderous noise of some relentless storm, farewells. everlastingly shriek to mid sobs of reluctant shuttering agony. And then, as I listened before, my eyes are black mist gathered slowly, and I thought I saw great rocks bursting asunder into flame, and drifting islands in a sea of fire. faces wonderful, hideous, beautiful, peered at me out of a darkness dense of the night. And in the midst of this, there came a tune, complete in sweetness and suggestion, a piercing sword like tune that plunged into my very heart and rankled there. My breath failed me. My senses swam, I felt that I must move, speak, cry out, and implore that this music, this horribly insidious music should cease. I swooned with the voluptuous poison of it, when, with a full chord of splendid harmony, that rolled out upon the air, like a breaking wave, the intoxicating sounds ebbed away into silence. No one spoke. Our hearts were yet beating too wildly, with the pulsations roused by that wondrous lyric storm. Diana Chesney was the first to break the spell. Well, that beats everything I've heard, she murmured. So if you think your piece of music can elicit that kind of response please do enter and astonishingly enough and what's happened while I was reading that someone actually came into the studio, clutching a banjo and your you are,

Unknown Speaker  08:09

On the right, I saw blue whale within this dock at all nights. I feel no thunder in my house holds

Frank Key  11:38
well that we have a surprise early entry for the hooting on Music Prize 2006 if you like to enter remember the rules you will have to go and buy your copy of a copy of the sorrows of Satan by Marie Corelli page. 123 of the world Oxford world's classics edition if you wish to familiarize yourself again with the rules and words from something on hooting yard. You might want to choose words from this which is a new story called fought hoity came the day the fanatical adherents of trebizond Oh Cal pepper smashed their way by main force through the huge iron gates of fought hoity. They were both astonished and disappointed to find the fort deserted, safer, a tethered goat in the courtyard. The go to tether extended far enough for it to be able to reach a flowerbed by one fourth wall. So it was a well nourished goat as well as a tethered goat. That goat said the fanatical trebizond Oh Culpepper adherents they call Bhim has eaten half the flowers in that flower bed, and has not even begun on the weeds. His companions jotted this observation down in their logbooks, under be for BIM. They each use the spidery handwriting they had learned at the feet of trebizond Oh cow peppers penciling Master, the nameless gravel voiced Peruvian laundry basket man who had inadvertently sent them to Fort hoity in the first place, replacing their logbooks in their pockets. The adherence gathered about BIM who was now lolling by a brazier, in which hot coals burned still, clearly the fort had not been long abandoned. This fort has not long been abandoned, said bem for the coals in this brazier burns still, but how did the fort people flee? If they had left by the huge iron gate? We would have seen them when we were standing on the hill as dawn broke and we ate our breakfasts the plans of the fort which we have studied so conscientiously show no other exits. This then is a highly perplexing circumstance. I wonder if that goat in addition to being tethered and well fed is also a talking goat. The fanatical adherents known as a ban slapped his forehead. For crying out loud BIM. He shouted, have you taken leave of your senses? There's no such thing under the heavens as a goat that speaks human languages. That is the stuff of fairytales. The other fanatical adherents mumbled together as a group, both BAM and bam had them confused now, for they had expected to enter fort hoity through main force and to be chopping and slashing and unleashing Madcap havoc. Instead, they were standing around, mumbling and pondering the connection if there was one between fairies, elves, sprites and goats. The fanatical adherents named Diocletian much mustachios raised the topic of tethering if one could tether a goat as the fort hoity goat had been tethered, could one tether a fairy? Would a fairy not be nimble enough to slip its bonds to this Pembroke cat suggested that a fairy could surely be tethered by using gossamer thin magical thread. The mumbling grew louder. Time was passing BIM made an announcement. Not many leagues yonder is fought toity, I know in my bones that that is where the fort whitey people have gone. I know not how they got there, but that is where they must be. We shall leave a team here to secure the place, and the rest of us will march like the clappers to Fort toity, and we shall untether that goat and take it with us.

Frank Key  15:50
And so over two days, Ben and his bedraggled gang of fanatical trebizond Oh, Culpepper adherents began traipsing across the plane whistling as they marched those who had not undergone whistling training parked Hooters instead, or imitated crows corncrakes and loons. Every so often, they would stop and sit and eat from their bags of confectionery and bam or BAM would make pronouncements and the band of fanatical adherents would jot down their a pursues all sorts of subjects related to the teachings of trebizond. Oh Cal pepper were covered from dishwater and clanging noises to oil slicks, and the bossa nova from freckles and optometry to Khadi and tack. They tied a colorful and perfume rag to one ear of the untethered goat and let it lead the way across the plane towards fort toity. So who were they, the people they pursued who had fled from home 40 to 4020. And who were now being born down upon slowly but surely by the fanatical adherents of trebizond. Oh Cal pepper and an untethered goat? Well, first, they were the people who made miniature cardboard hens and place them on the sides of paths. And second, they executed the very name of trebizond. Oh, Culpepper, regularly every night In fact, as they sat around there, brazier of hot coals staring at the moon, if it was visible through the clouds. If the moon was not visible, they shut their eyes. They would sit quite still, for so long that birds would nest in their hair and Moss grow upon their feet. There were more than 100 of them, and they worship nothing, not even the tethered goat they had so cruelly abandoned back at Fort hoity. Why did they not take the goat with them as they fled? This is the kind of question the out of print pamphleteer Dobson would have addressed had he been alive at the time of which I write, but he was yet to be born. It's hard for us to imagine a world without Dobson a world where inexplicable things could happen did happen, and there was no hastily scribbled pamphlet issued within days or weeks to make sense of events. how one would have longed for even a few precious pages entitled, why those who fled fought hoity for fought toity to escape the fanatical adherents of trebizond. Though Culpepper cruelly abandoned their tethered goat with footnotes and a map. A map would certainly have been abused to the pursuers who became utterly lost on that barren plain. Try as they might, they could not find fought toity. They wondered for months, led by the goat until their confectionery bags were empty, and the batteries on bims portable metal Tapping Machine were dead. They were far from home, exhausted and hungry, and increasingly rancorous. Pembroke it in particular, was thoroughly frazzled, and took the poking his fellows with a pointy stick until I took it away from him and stamped on his toes until he promised to desist and desist he did, for he fell victim to an au sweating and shaking and babbling incoherent gibberish. Bam accused him of having a spurious au to elicit sympathy. Diocletian said, This is not the first time you have made an accusation of spurious aq bam. Do you have an ID a fix a? Bam replied, Yes, I do. Is that so wrong? But Pembroke gets au was all too real. And it was on the Thursday morning he expired out on that plane, that the fanatical adherence of trebizond Oh Culpepper, were plunged into despair. And one by one, they all perished. And with them perished, the cult of trebizond cold pepper

Frank Key  20:57
Every now and then of course, it's very useful on hooting yard to entertain you with a moral tale. And here is a moral here is a moral fable, I'm sure that you'll be able to take this on board. Brethren, we find ourselves today in a village in China. Perhaps some would feel inclined to ridicule rather than applaud the patience of a poor Chinese woman who tried to make a needle from a rod of iron by rubbing it against a stone. We may scoff, and laugh and snicker like rude and common folk do. It is doubtful whether she succeeded or not. But so the story runs, the site of the worker plying her seemingly hopeless task, put new courage and determination into the heart of a young Chinese student, who in deep despondency stood watching her. He was a spindly little chap, whose greatest joy was to be found in the study of industrious leaf cutter ants, of which he kept teeming 1000s in a glass case in the pilot of his pneumonia racked mother. Because of repeated failures in his studies, ambition and hope had left him he could think only of ant bitterly disappointed with himself, and despairing of ever accomplishing anything. The young man had thrown his books aside in disgust. He had even cast aside a five volume encyclopedia devoted entirely to the world of insect ants alone filled the pages of books one and two. put to shame However, by the lesson taught by the old woman, he gathered his scattered forces together, went to work with renewed ardor, and wedding patience and energy, became in time, one of the great scholars in China. Actually, that's not strictly true, he ended up selling cummerbunds for export in a batavian sweatshop. When you know you're on the right track. Do not let any failures dim your vision or discourage you, for you cannot tell how close you may be to victory. And even if every damn thing goes wrong, there is no shame in being a deluded pauper. Have patience and stick stick stick, then stick a bit more. It is eternally true that he who steers right on will gain at length however far the port, though he be seasick all the way and quite bereft of thought.

It's not often at the show closes with a preamble.
