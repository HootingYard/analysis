Good afternoon. This is hooting out on the air. I hate to disappoint you. But I'm exactly the same Frank key who, if you were listening quarter an hour ago would have heard talking about Bob Drake on that exciting show we've just heard. Anyway, this week as usual, I'm going to read you some pros for half an hour. The first piece I'm going to read this week is called the brink of cramp. And for those of you interested in such things, this story was first published many years ago, in an edition of eight copies. Each of the copies was in a ring binder. It was handwritten, and it's an alphabetical story. And each of the letters was hand illuminated in watercolor. Just think if you've got a copy of that it could be worth all eu 25 p by now. Anyway, this is the brink of cramp an alphabetical guide to all been linseeds great novel. A is for ends, which are small social insects of the hymenoptera order. Chapter x x v AI of linseeds great novel is an extended celebration of the life cycle of the end. Unfortunately, linseeds understanding of the natural world was one of profound ignorance, and his magnificent list of ant fact is almost entirely inaccurate. For example, the author would have us believe that quote, ants have seven hearts three brains and bear upon their indented backs a puddle of milk, and quote, and that quote, the cheers Atlantic and is spawned from mud, and collapses in on itself into a dry husk after living for 18 years. Unquote. That said, the so called aunt chapter can be seen as pivotal in the course of the novel. Be is for Bosket. linseed places many of the important scenes of the book in a basket or thicket of stunted and dying shrubs. Its precise location is given a map on page 66, which the author commissioned from a professional cartographer named Dennis snop snop, who died on Easter Sunday. 1955 is one of the more preposterous figures on the fringes of linseeds circle. His bath was made of wood. He suffered dreadfully from nosebleeds. His hair was like straw, and he could not play the ukulele trials he might. Despite his many disadvantages, and his diminutive stature, he's noted for having felled A u boat captain with a single blow from his cambric gloved fist. C is for cake, wouldn't it just be for cake. It is one of the more intriguing features of this great encyclopedic novel that nowhere in it does linseed mentioned cake. And yet we have evidence of plenty that the great author was a fanatical cake eater, often guzzling five or six chocolate Swiss rolls for breakfast. Critics have puzzled over the resounding absence of cake in the novel, far been seized seeds in it sunk retinue although what she means by this is unclear. D is for deduction. linseed was an avid reader of crime fiction. And in part seven of the novel, he saved his only attempt at creating a super sleuth along the lines of the great fictional detectives. It has to be said that he failed. His detective whose name escapes me is woefully lacking and the qualities we expect to find in such characters. most striking is the detectives inability to make the most elementary deductions faced with a murder victim who has been impaled on tungsten railings, pages 481 to 483 linseeds sleuth concludes that the man is one not dead to an employee of the post office and three rubbery

the brink of cramp continued. He is for electroencephalogram. That is a record made of electric currents in the brain. linseed makes use of electroencephalograms or he G's in a number of novel ways in this tremendous book. Having stolen a cache of E trees from his local hospital. linseed used them to plan the peaks and troughs of plot development in parts four to eight. On occasion, this has wonderfully inventive consequences, as in chapter l XXV, where he is forced to kill off mapa only to resurrect him 60 pages later. linseed was eventually prosecuted for the theft of the E GS and was banged up in stir as he put it for three nightmarish weeks. F is for flamboyance with which the novel is fairly riddled. I'm particularly fond of linseeds predilection for having many of his characters plunged into situations of utmost peril from which they're extricated not by their own efforts, but by the author's Cavalier manner of ignoring or denying the existence of earlier scenes. On page 72, for example, wicked loses his footing on a cliff edge, and he's actually falling in midair as the chapter ends. On page 178. However, he is to be found sitting in an armchair at the rectory swinging from a flask of gin and no reference is ever made his earlier calamity. Ah, such Li. G is not for cake. C is. H is for hack. Mango hack is arguably the key character in the book. One hesitates to dub him a hero, although linseed himself used the word in his notebooks. It is hack who at the beginning of the novel falls out of a boat and bangs his jaw on an or hack who delivers the mustard to Wensleydale hack indeed, who in chapter x x phi is described as entirely festooned with blankets, rugs, swaddling and netting. linseed plans to write another novel in which hack would join the Mounties but a gunshot wound and trellis work put paid to that scheme as we know. I is for ink. linseed wrote the first draft of his novel using black rotating ink, technically known as drawing ink for tracing paper and line board zeichen touche vas I can appear on chrodis shimpo peppier, Desa or tyntec kena peripapillary de buho. He was assured that it was waterproof, but to my knowledge, never tested this by latching the pages to the top of his umbrella during a downpour. J is for jumpers when not writing, reading, loosening thoughts or hacking pieces of wood, linseed relaxed by knitting. His sister has estimated that the renowned author probably produced something in the region of 10,000 items of knitwear during his lifetime adapted balaclavas, maths and shawls, he could never crack the technique of knitting jumpers. His many delirious attempt, which he insisted on wearing public gatherings are the best evidence of his inability. All his jumpers were either too big or too small, have three or more sleeves, no hole at the neck or gaping holes in unlikely places. linseed scholar gravel slobber has recently published an entertaining picture book containing full color photographs of over 100 examples.

the brink of cramp continued still, k is a cat A plat, a disease caused by prolonged exposure to mark. Although he had no personal experience of this malady, linseed makes it a recurrent motif in his novel. Indeed, as Hummingbird has pointed out, it's worth noting that more people suffer from cataplana in linseeds novel than in any comparable work of fiction. This has been contested by Thorburn, who points to her work by Perkins at the at the denouement of which only inhabit buttons have a massive city a struck down by cataplana. bus, bringing the puck to an apocalyptic if somewhat overwritten, close. L is for lemonade. In chapter c LX VIII how bag enters the butcher shop clutching a bottle of lemonade, from which he takes regular swigs, the butcher accidentally brushes against him, knocking the bottle to the floor, dashing it to smithereens. a puddle of lemonade forms on the tiled floor spreading and reveal it along the grouting hell bag sobs and does not buy any sausages for the picnic as planned. The ramifications of this seemingly innocuous incident are many and untoward. It is one of the few scenes in the novel which is purely autobiographical and M is for mapa. A number of critics have pointed out that the character of the winsome sniper mapa is based on linseeds friend and confidante hinges O. Shaughnessy. his poetry is little read today. Although during his 30s o Shaughnessy was lionized by bespectacled terrorists. The major themes of his poetry are hopelessness, enmity, bath salts, paneling, crustacea morbidity, and brown spiny flakes of unknown provenance. He lived in a lighthouse and burned most of his manuscripts. And it's for nothing at all in the book. Oh is for auto land or bunting? A bird of some description. linseed who knew absolutely nothing about ornithology was a great one for bunting of a different sort. The little flags and pennants hung decoratively at Garland's fairs and garden parties. He was known to strew such bunting wherever he went on page 991. Mini opens a bunting shop. But how this enterprise fares we never learn. Excuse me, P is for plot. For decades, I've tussled with the near insurmountable task of summarizing the plot of this awesome novel. Such a summary would be a boon to students throughout the globe, I'm pleased to announce that my first draft is now complete, however, so intricate of the weaves and strands of linseeds masterpiece that my summary is in fact longer than the novel itself. I have now set to work on a precis of my summary, which I hope to have ready for publication within the next 40 years. Q is for classier, an American tropical tree which yields a bitter tonic. linseed goes out of his way to inform us that there are many classes in the basket, and it is not hard to see the reason for his insistence. It's not hard, but try as they might. None of the Legion of critics and exegesis of the novel has managed to come up with a convincing answer. And nor have I. Perhaps, flake comes closest in the interminable footnote on pages 64 to 81 of his study, where he points out that linseed mistook classier for elk bolt. Although an elk bolt is a flint Arrowhead, and quite unlike a tree. flake argues his case with precision and vivacity are is for requests get a prayer for the repose of the dead. At linseeds funeral, the rescue s cat was read by his cat. Few cats in history has been gifted with human speech, and linseeds was no exception. It's woebegone mules were later Translated by the notorious fraud toggle bath, who came to a bad end when he was set upon by a pack of ferocious geese while strolling along the towpath of a canal. S is for scooted, attacks paid by a feudal tenant in lieu of military service. One of linseeds more enduring habits was his annual payment of scooted to a snag

The widow could never understand linseeds motives for country anxiously paying an anachronistic tax to someone who was in no position to press him into military service. Neither can I

the brink of cramp the final part T is for 347, which is the number of chapters in linseeds timeless masterpiece, careful study of his notebooks shows that the author originally planned just eight chapters, but then he got carried away following the windigo. Putting incident in chapter six. Sorry, Chapter v i. Peruvian editions of the novel, give 346 chapters running together chapters XCXLI and CXL ai. The same additions have the added quirk of altering the names of all the characters except mapa, and inserting implausible strings of adjectives before many of the nouns even when linseed has already supplied his own. Excuse me, u is for umiak, a large Eskimo canoe. It is not generally known that linseed wrote much of the novel while squatting in an umiak which he had had built inside his house. He had planned on completion of his work to knock down his home and toe that umiak to a canal further than this is thought did not go. As it was, however, the umiak perished in a conflagration which laid waste linseeds house in September 1956. His final draft, having been carved on fireproof boards survived the flames, for which the world of literature must surely rejoice. The is for vagabond. There are a number of vagabond, ruffians, miscreants and ergens in the novel, non more memorable than the unnamed character who first appears in chapter x eye picking his teeth and rummaging about in Wensleydale have a sack. Later in chapter x c VI, we find him drenched by bilgewater picking his teeth and rummaging in hacks rucksack. His last appearance is in chapter cc x VI, where RoseMarie is astonished to find him playing the Cournot in an amateur dance band, picking his teeth and later rummaging in ring molds satchel. W is for wax, a solid insoluble non greasy substance which softens and melts at low temperature. On page 1496. glove edge drops a small wax and lozenge into a titanium cylinder, which she then wrapped in cellophane paper and conceals behind the horse trough. The cylinder remains maddeningly undiscovered for the remainder of this majestic novel. X is for zoster, a surgical instrument for scraping bones at the same time as he stole the electroencephalograms from the hospital. linseed also made off with a crate of newly sterilized disasters. It is not known to what use he put them. Interestingly enough, there is no mention of disasters in the novel lincy provides a description of the bone structure of each of his main characters going to into inordinate detail on each part of the skeleton. It is assumed that he appropriated this information from a volume of poetry by hinges o Shaughnessy, entitled The insanitary Pew Why is for you, the listener? As soon as you finished listening to this alphabetical guide soon soon, please put your library ticket in your pocket and hurry along to your library, swinging your arms and smiling beatifically and once through those massive oak doors, borrow linseeds novel, take it home and read it from cover to cover and then read it again and then again until you can recite it from memory. Zed is for zombie the Python God to which linseed paid a BS ns throughout his life.

So that was the brink of cramp and here's an old favorite. I do like to throw in some old favorites from time to time, apart from anything else means I don't always have to come up with half an hour of brand new material every week and this is called massacre of the innocence that Hoon splattered with seagull droppings. The woman of twigs stood at the very edge of the cliff, her back to the sea. barefoot, she rocked gently back and forth on her impromptu podium. The villagers were gathered about her wretched and snuggling. Some carried pitchforks or dainty little tin boxes full of bit. They were all ears as they waited for the woman of twigs to speak. She had blindfolded herself, with a threadbare bandage, bound her hair into tuft with yarn and roots, and held in her hands a ribbon of bloody silk, precisely the moment that the 1,000th wave of the day crashed against the rocks below. The woman of twigs seest her rocking, cast the ribbon to the winds, and shouting to make herself heard over the screeching goals began.

You asked me to save the village from doom. I have communed with a variety of weird and tiresome shades to seek guidance. You are correct, your village is imperiled. There is only one way to rescue it from the coming agony. Three of your number must travel many miles distant to the town of Hoon, there, they must find a churn, possibly broken the churn of Hoon, which has had engraved upon it a rather fetching likeness of myself. Do not ask why. Having scoured Hoon for this churn and found in Hoon, this churn of Hoon, it must be brought back here with Drew haste and hurled into the boiling sea from this very spot on the Cliff's edge. That task complete, your village will once again no Glee, I have left unmentioned one crucial point, the three who will venture to Hoon there to find and return the Hoon turn, must all be called Ned. That is all. Work began at once on building the chariot. In the kitchens. The village is boiled up huge iron pans full of mud and silt dredged from the riverbed. trees were felled in the spinny. The Smithy at his Advil, beat out a goodly number of nails, spikes and very sharp hooks. Within a week, the foul smelling but indestructible vehicle was ready. Volunteers fanned out across the countryside to trap a suitable beast of burden. Horses, oxen, even a crippled reindeer of great elegance was sighted and stoked, but another week elapsed without success. Eventually, it was decided that the three Ned's would have to travel under their own steam pulling the chariot by themselves. Ned, Ned and Ned agreed, drooling with excitement in their eagerness to set out on so glorious a journey, one that would save the village and bring them renown they left the village at a gallop in the middle of the night. Without maps they relied entirely on local law and superstition. from infancy each net had been imbued with a long Catechism of saws and Proverbs. Now, each had engraved upon his skull, a different couplet handed down through the generations. If you wish to go to Hoon, spit three times and follow the moon hoons beyond young crumpled hedge, hemmed around by gossen sedge. When you see a pebble strewn, your eight days and nights from Hoon

They traveled without pause to dragging the stinking chariot, while the third lay bundled in it, sleeping or feeding from a polythene bag full of curdled slops. First, they followed the course of the great frightening river until suddenly it wormed its way underground. For 18 months, they traveled through a desolate landscape, flat, gray, and curiously redolent of shirred. But as they entered hoons hinterland, things changed. in rapid succession, they passed and asbestos works. a barrel of rainwater a customer's post. damp Hector's elk encampments, fence posts, grotesque wooden carvings, horrifying shrubbery, improbable water tables, Jerry built hearts, a kailyn quarry lumps of disgust monstrous gulches nebulous stretches of pointed brambly things, ornithologists hideaways, parakeet enclosures, quarantines, sheds, Rusk markets, strange gobbets of sludge, a tremendous farmyard urn burials a vacuum wrestling pythons extravagant banks of yellow fog, yeast traffickers and a zipper crushing factory, Ned said to net a net soon which will be in Hoon, I can feel it in my water. He was not mistaken. The great South Gate of Hoon was over 1000 years old and completely overgrown by clumps of hideous fleshy foliage using poisonous SAP. All attempts to destroy this abominable vegetation had met with failure, and it had not been possible to open the gate for at least two centuries. Rather than blasting a hole in the town wall, a ramshackle lift contraption was knocked up close by two wooden platforms. One other saw one either side of the Great Wall were raised and lowered by an exciting system of pistons pulleys and winches operated by a team of gatekeepers wearing boa constrictor masks. In return for their labors. They exactly have a hefty price. Unfortunately, the three Ned's were utterly penalise muttering among themselves are heroic trio decided to profit gift in lieu of payment. Ned offered the gatekeepers his cap, which was made of rusted whisks. Ned presented them with a sick Toad he had been pampering for the past month, Ned gave them a handful of silt scraped from the underside of the chariot. well pleased with these gifts, the gatekeepers allowed the exhausted threesome to clamber onto the platform. Two days later, the three nodes will lower to the ground on the other side of the wall. At last they were in hoon. Finding the possibly broken turn of Hoon could only be a matter of time. They would be implacable ferreting into every corner of the ancient town. As soon as they disembark from the wooden platform, they were set upon by our whirling tangle of ruffians, who bashed them senseless, stole the shirts off their backs, empty their polythene bags of slops, and pap into the gutter. Holy dismantle the chariot, had at them with ferocious scimitars and left them for dead. And indeed, Ned and Ned were dead. Ned was carted off by a passing stretcher patrol, but painted his last breath An hour later, by which time the ruthian scampered away, heading for the mountains. They stopped by the kaylin quarry to eat their pack lunches. And then, as night came down, they strode up the mountainside, these ruffins their gaze is fixed on the sky above, to look at the number of stars to view the boundless firmament.

And that's the end of hooting yard on the air for this week, two stories there. What will I have for you next week? Well, one thing I know for sure, will be very useful.
