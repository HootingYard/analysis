jurco leko caca sorry. Sorry about that I was just sort of listing certain World Cup footballers names. Instead of getting on with the show. This is hosting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. My name is Frankie. And this is a story called fiends have the farm yard.

Unknown Speaker  00:38
And I wrote this this morning. There is or may have been an old superstition that every farm yard has its own themed. It is said that blg Bob personally allotted each themed to its farm yard and ratcheted up the fiendish pneus of his dastardly plan by making the themes extremely hard to identify. So for example, neighboring farmyards may have very, very different resident themes. A pig here, an old rusty iron pail, they're a one legged hand in one farm yard, and a big, bright red tractor belching smoke in another. exorcising a farm yard of its fiend is thus fraught with difficulty for the average countryside exocyst stepping through the gate of a farm yard for the first time does not know where to begin to look. There is great disparity in the fiendish pneus of farmyard fiends and some diabliss have argued that Beelzebub treated the whole matter with an uncharacteristic lack of diabolic concentration. For every farmyard that is stricken by an energetic fiend. There are many more that can pass for years, even decades in untroubled, bucolic peace. But of course, it is the former that gain attention, Who can forget the ruination visited upon screwin hunahpu farm yard in the 1930s all those crop failures, diseases, fires, murders, contaminations, and inexplicable bond collapses, which ceased only when a marauding nighttime squirrel was captured in a net by Father Dermot Boggess and subjected to the full rigor of his holy Roth. It took six months for the exocyst to expel every last vestige of fiendish pneus from the squirrel, leaving the poor, bushy tailed mammal thin and exhausted and close to death. And yet, as it was slowly revived by the coddling of old mar purgative at her verdant squirrel sanctuary, so too, did the farm yard flourish and new with majestic fields of golden wheat, gleaming new buckets replacing the old rusty pails and happy happy pigs. There's a cough you would be forgiven for thinking that the taxonomy of farmyard fiends is precisely the kind of subject to which Dobson would have devoted a pamphlet or two. Indeed, marigold to often pressed him to tackle the topic, supplying the out of print pamphleteer with a constant stream of newspaper cuttings about hideous devastations of an agricultural kidney. She was a subscriber to the ones popular monthly magazine, glimpses of farmyard ruin, and wrote many letters to the editor, some of which were published, and one of which October 1954 was selected as letter of the week, or month, for which marigold received a prize. Unfortunately, the prize was a very large hog with a brain disease, which went rampaging about the house. mischievously, the editor of the magazine, who had his own farm yard regularly used the monthly prize to rid himself of his farm yard fiends. Yes, now the plural what happens you will ask when a fiend of the farmyard is identified and destroyed, whether by slaughter exorcism or big or being given away as a prize in a raffle tombola or by some other means, as happened with marigold true. Did screwin hoon Puj farmyard stay themed free once it sinister squirrel habits demons cast out? How attentive was Beelzebub to the welfare of those he had sent to wreak havoc in our boschi rural domains were new themes recruited and trained to carry out various infernal farmyard acts of fiendish pneus. These and other questions were answered by fathered Dermot Boggess himself, in his deathbed ravings, carefully transcribed by his wrinkled old helpmeet, the widow popsicle. Among the 1000s of pages she scribbled. We find this startling passage of disconnected rantings gas. Gah. Gah, in explicable torment of the devil's long poking fork is ladle Catechism of shuttering a basement in the pit. When did you last see your potatoes

Unknown Speaker  05:34
gap?

Unknown Speaker  05:35
Have the fields been hold? I see hundreds of cows 1000s of cows, millions of cows, brutes, the flames of the fiery furnace, a crow on a branch of a dead tree blast of lightning, no diesel for the tractor, blight, blight. Worms eating the flesh of resurrected horses. Never resurrect a horse never passed me that feeble lamp, puddles of sludge and slop and constant rainfall 40 days and 40 nights flooded fields. The week ruined a god poisoning a gruesome figure in the shroud of death. Find me a lonely cave remote from humankind dark as the midnight grave and dismal as my mind guy. And with that last brief flash of lucidity, the remembered words of john Eccles circa 1688. To 1735 father Dermott Boggess relapsed into insanity. 400 pages worth of the widow popsicles, palsy pencils scroll the clue to the farmyard things damageable resilience is I think, in that reference to the CRO perched on the branch of a dead tree. Dawn is near the sun will soon be lighting your path to the far flung fields. Go and tell and plow and herro feed your horses and your cows and your happy happy pigs. You may spit upon your farmyard fiend it will pass to you no more. It was only ever a superstition or it might have been

Unknown Speaker  07:41
pencil and paper caca players to watch this is called the big metal fence. freakishly tall drapes in a soutien my brain pounding I found myself standing before a trench full of sludge in each hand. I discovered that I was holding a bucket of pungent glue. My feet were encased in sturdy plastic booties and at least two pairs of socks. I squelched across the trench, each step expelling from the sludge, noise and fumes, which wafted in the air behind me shimmering and stinking. After some minutes, I clambered onto the other side and rested the buckets upon the ground. sulfurous fires ablaze within my skull, I had made the crossing from life into death, eternity was before me. That was six weeks ago, and I have now prepared this preliminary report of my impressions. I don't doubt that as further ions pass, what follows may appear naive, churlish and inaccurate. I'll file a more detailed report in 10 billion years or so. And it will be instructive for scholars to compare the two documents are repeat. These are very much first impressions. In marshaling my material, I've plunged the majority of my notes into the shoot of wrack and ruin, which is on the mezzanine floor of the larger of the two damp buildings. First, because to include everything would make this report too long and unwieldy. Second, because I've come to enjoy the worrying and clanking noises emitted by the shoot when it's put into operation. It is my fondest hope that however limited and fragmentary the material, my listeners will nonetheless gain a useful insight into what awaits them after death. So far, I've discovered four pubs, the butcher's vest, the consumptive Stalinist, the 10th, chaffinch and the smoldering pit. To get into the latter, you must be in possession of a special ticket issued by the river police, whose headquarters is in a small heart at the bottom of a flight of stone steps a few 100 yards north of the moribund dam. To get into the heart however, you need a license. From the buffed up shield Committee, which meets only once every 4000 years, it's typical of my luck that they met just two days before I arrived here. From what I've heard, the smoldering pit has the very best drinks in the afterlife. And what's more there free. My friend green chalk, who's been here for untold centuries, recommends a particular brew they serve called the hoist. It is effervescent, curdled of a startling lavender tinge. And after four pints you get to draw in Captain snaps committee of which more later I have been able to get into the other three pubs mentioned, none of which has any restrictions on entry. The Butcher's vest is the only one worthy of repeated visits. It's a landlord, a battered Titan, whose name is unpronounceable comes from the same villages me although he lived there many centuries before I was born. We've had many little chats, although his speech is hard for me to follow, as he is toothless and slobbers uncontrollably. The range of drinks is somewhat limited, but the landlord provides enticing snacks for his regular customers. Each of the tables has a bowl of boiling hot custard on it into which one can dip a staggering selection of biscuits, crackers, bands, tarts, and pastries. Often these are stale, but when moistened with sufficient custard, they're quite palatable. The tables are rickety, though, so one must be careful to avoid spillages which enraged the landlord to the point where his hair stands on end, his face turns purple and he gets his cronies to wholly offender into an open sewer which runs past the back door. You may find it hard to believe but absolutely everyone here is dressed from head to foot in corduroy. When I made the crossing, you will recall that I was wearing a suit stain. I have no idea why. at reception, however, I was ushered into a little cubicle and given a set of corduroy apparel to change into hat shirt gerkin underpants, pantaloons, socks and moccasins. The soutien was taken away and I have not seen it since. Later, when I was taken to my quarters, I discovered a wardrobe full of corduroy clothing.

Unknown Speaker  12:24
Ah, yes, my quarters. What is accommodation like on the other side of the grave? Well poki the population is of course ever increasing. So overcrowding is a seemingly insoluble problem. Contrary to popular belief, as far as I can remember, we do not have unlimited space. Those who've been here for an unimaginably long time can only dimly remember when they had a small room all for themselves. I share my cabin with seven others bins was a whaling captain. Our act booze ran a luxury hotel, RoseMarie and lettice, who perished together in one of the earliest railway accidents were distressed, gentle women. They still are come to that. Scrat was some sort of Hill peasant nog, our longest serving resident appears to have been a caveman as far as any of us can tell. These smells astonishing, astonishingly unpleasant. mean top thing babbles endlessly about her glorious life in an Imperial Palace of the ancient orient, and treat the rest of us with contempt. thrown together with dead people whose lives were so different, it might be thought that the afterlife is one long round of fascinating conversations, broaden horizons, and limitless opportunity to compare ideas, ideas, feelings, throbs, pangs, perceptions, and beliefs would that it was so unfortunately, language acquisition, and indeed any kind of mental development simply doesn't happen here. So nog is locked in his strange and distant world goes out of his mind with confusion when he sees for example, a wheel and spends most of the time grunting, hammering his fists on the floor and making his toilet where the fancy takes him. bins told me an uproarious story about how he wants took nag with him to the butcher's vest, and forced eight pints of grass down the poor Richard's throat. In the resulting mayhem nog smashed the pub to smithereens before passing out quite happily in the sewer, where he spent the next year or so recovering. The fact that we all were virtually identical corduroy clothing also makes things difficult. You simply can't tell whether the person lounging by the bus stop is a 13th century Mongolian warlord, a Victorian entomologist that murdered air to the Throne of Finland, a milkmen from Wivenhoe a druid, a CIA assassin, a Baltic potato farmer, one of Hannibal's ma hoots. Ethel read the unready or an ex Pope. The chances are that any attempt to make it light conversation will be doomed from the start through mutual unintelligibility. So after a while you don't even bother to try. I've only been here for six weeks, and I'm already affected by this social lethargy. Our cramped living conditions are intolerable. And it's not surprising that fights and squabbles are common. I tried to spend most of my time out and about going back home only to sleep. In my first week, I made inquiries about changing cabins, but to do so is apparently impossible. They have a massive ledger at reception, and they pencil in your name against whatever accommodation is available. And that's it forever and ever and ever and ever. I have been given a job at the dairy, we have 1000s of cows and efficient bottling plant, good refrigeration facilities, and a delivery system that runs like clockwork. buttermilk is increasingly popular. And we also produce sour cream, cheeses, yogurt and a very nice and very nice little cartons of way. Of course fresh milk forms the bulk of our production. And although we no longer do home deliveries, we make sure that the milk kiosks are always fully stocked after a sink after a month in the single cream department. I was promoted. I am now captain of the turns and I wear a special badge. The spirit trip spiritualists among you will be pleased to note that this place is fairly riddled with Ecto plasm. viscous refulgent and shimmering it hovers above the rooftops curls in wisps in every room darts hither and thither in the air wherever one cares to look what purpose it serves as a mystery. There are scholars here of course, and many of them are using eternity to puzzle over this enigmatic substance. Books roll off the presses in frightening quantities. On a visit to the library. Last week,

Unknown Speaker  17:20
I noted the following titles, all of them published since my arrival, the Ecto plasmic gasm tear, the luster of Ecto plasm Ecto plasmas, heavens porridge Ecto plasmic phantasms, and Ecto plasm new hub, learned journals devoted to the subject a piled high in corridors and pavilions. Hot and hate filled debates are broadcast on the radio. As two or more experts dispute each other's theories shouting their heads off and resorting to infantile bickering. True fanatics spend months at a time in the echo plasm Park near the railway sidings with a gleaming substance has somehow been corralled and controlled, hanging low in the air above a large circle of verdant lawns. The visitor to the park is literally enveloped in ectoplasm, breathing it in through every pore. What the effects are of such exposure, I do not know as I have yet to experience them. Needless to say, those who visit the park come away with wildly different stories to tell. The letters columns of the Ecto plasm journals are full of first hand reports the writers reactions varying from blinding ecstasy to stultifying boredom, I'll not bother to reproduce any of this verbiage here, you'll have time enough to read about it when you're dead. I have yet to meet Captain snap, but stories about him arrived. Most of them seem to be about the various high drinks and scamper ease he got up to when he was alive, asked about his role in the afterlife, and there is an ominous, even terrified silence. No one seems to know which cabin he lives in, if indeed he lives in a cabin at all. On a promontory by the mud wastes, there stands an enormous misshapen castle like something out of a child's nightmare. Some attest to that Captain snap inhabitants inhabited, surrounded by minions, but this seems unlikely. Every month, there are Shera bank outings to the castle and the tourists chosen by raffle are able to roam about all around it at will. Perhaps Captain snap hides in a broom cupboard or makes himself scarce during these visits. Who knows. Most people are only able to drink half a pint of the hoist before passing out. So rigorous training is necessary if one aspires to join Captain snaps committee. As with so much else Hear the committee's role is a mystery. Opinions vary, there are those who accuse the committee of regulating every aspect of the afterlife. Others say it's merely a drinking club. Beans swears blind that the members are able to return to Earth for short periods as ghosts, but but that for some reason, they're only able to haunt and deselect a winter racked seaside resorts. I'm sure he's just making that up. As with Ecto plasm. So with grace, there is a vast amount of it here. When I was alive, I remember that Christians used to bang on about grace all the time. But I must admit that I never worked out precisely what it was. From what I did gather however, I can confidently say that as with many aspects of the afterlife, they were very wide of the mark. at reception, they give you a large tub of grace and tell you to look after it very carefully and not to open it until you get the word. Not that they're trusting. Being a curious sort. I tried to open my tab as soon as I got to my cabin and discovered that it had a safety catch on the lid and nasty little mechanism which snapped over my fingers and clamp them tight against the tubs that are held with agony. bins chuckling at my naivety sent me off to the tub inspectors who freed my fingers, dab them with ointment resets the catch and gave me a ticking off. As for the word upon receipt of which I can open my top. To date, I have not met a single person who has ever received it. Everyone has their pristine unopened tab. Some people carry them around, though personally I find the pockets on our clothing are not roomy enough. You can buy little wicker baskets into which the tubs fit quite snugly, and you see those quite often. But like most people, I keep my tub of grace in a little wooden locker in my cabin.

Unknown Speaker  21:58
The postal system is charming rickshaws stacked with packets and parcels and pulled along by brightly uniformed passions career through the streets. If streets is the correct word for the stinking muddy channels which criss cross our domain. For some reason, you have to be a Prussian who died during the 19th century in order to get a job as a postal worker. This seems to be rather unfair, and we're not so happy at the dairy, I would raise a stink about it. When I first learned about this exclusive employment practice. I assumed that the Russians got the jobs because with their stereotypical passion for order, they would run a tight ship and keep stern bureaucratic control of so potentially chaotic a system as the postal deliveries I soon discovered how wrong my assumptions were. The great thing about the postal service here is that it is entirely random. You can write a letter, tie up a parcel, shove a few knickknacks into a packet and deposit it in the post box. And you simply never know who the recipient will be. If naively you waste your time carefully addressing your mail to a particular individual. You're summoned to the post office HQ and made to do an hour's stamp licking Judy.

Unknown Speaker  23:14
Well,

Unknown Speaker  23:15
ferocious hounds buy it to you from an adjoining room. There is a big metal fence completely surrounding this place. It is electrified, I have spent long hours peering through its criss cross of lethal wires trying to see what lies beyond it. But all I can make out is an indistinct Bayesian motion blur. A distant mesmerizing clamor is just audible. Those who through nefarious means have attempted to cross it have found themselves instantly surrounded by gangs of brutish myrmidons, whose golden helmets are burnished and gleaming, merciless and inexplicable. They unwrap their captives in gray corduroy shrouds in toner litany of awfulness and dread and convey them at hideous speed to the mezzanine floor of the big damp building, whence they are dispatched, muffled stricken and gassed into the chute of wrack and ruin and as it was an clanks, they are forever swept away, they are swept away and gone. Every now and then, on the show, as regular listeners will know I like to read from quotations from the work of others. Normally I tend to read things by less well known writers, but I thought today I'd end the program by treating you to an excerpt from Mrs. Burton's book of household management by Isabella beaten Of course 1861 a classic book, and I've always enjoyed the syrup the section, a few rules to be observed in cooking for invalids. Not sure we have time for the whole thing. But and I think well before reading the rules themselves. Mrs. Beeton has a wonderful recipe in this section. Invalid jelly so if you know anyone who's not feeling too well but off color bit peaky with the heat I think you should you would do better than to make them some invalid jelly. This will make this will perk anyone up. Ingredients 12 Shanks of mutton, three quarts of water, a bunch of sweet Herbes pepper and salt to taste. three blades of mace one onion, one pound of lean beef and a crust of bread toasted brown soak the Shanks in plenty of water for some hours and scrub them well. Put them with the beef and other ingredients into a saucepan with the water and let them simmer very gently for five hours. Strain the broth and when cold take off all the fat. It may be eaten either warmed up or cold as a jelly Doesn't that sound huh? Delicious. Anyway, here are some of Mrs Bateman's rules to be observed in cooking invalids. Let's all the kitchen utensils used in the preparation of invalid cookery be delicately and scrupulously clean. If this is not the case, a disagreeable flavor may be imparted to the preparation, which flavor may disgust and prevent the patient from partaking of the refreshment when brought to him or her. Always have something in resonance, a little beef t nicely made and nicely skimmed a few spoonfuls of jelly etc, that it may be administered as soon almost as the invalid wishes for it. If obliged to wait a long time, the patient loses the desire to eat and often turns against the food when brought to him or her. In sending dishes or preparations up to invalids. Let everything look As tempting as possible. Have a clean tray cloth laid smoothly over the tray. Let the spoons tumblers, caps and sauces etc. Be very clean and bright. gruel served in a tumbler is more appetizing than when served in a basin or a cup and saucer. Never leave food about a sick room. If the patient cannot eat it when brought to him, take it away and bring it to him in an hour or twos time. Miss Nightingale says to leave the patient and tasted food by his side for meal to meal in hopes that he will eat it in the interval is simply to prevent him from taking any food at all. She says I have known patients literally incapacitated from taking one article of food after another by this piece of ignorance. Let the food come at the right time and be taken away eaten or and eaten at the right time. But never let a patient have something always standing by him if you don't wish to discuss him of everything. Why his words I think and I hope you take them with you in the week ahead and think about them as you make your invalid jelly. I'll be back next week. Thank you for listening. Bye bye
