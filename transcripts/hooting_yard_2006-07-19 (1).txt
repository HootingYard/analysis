Good afternoon This is resonance 104 point four FM and this is hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. I got a letter from one of the cast members of last, who doesn't wish to be identified further. And the letter is as follows. Dear Mr. Qi, I'm a keen listener to your radio show on resonance FM. And I couldn't help noticing. But for the past two weeks, you've been talking about birds to the exclusion of virtually all other topics. a fortnight ago, you regale listeners with a catalogue of 53 birds. And this week or last week, in fact, you devoted your entire allotment of half an hour to the recitation of a list of over 600 birds. Are you a top ornithologist? Or are you trying to pull the wool over our eyes by pretending knowledge where there is only a stagnant pond of ignorance? Well, in all fairness, the list that I read out last week was a list of five film directors to Jasmine, one astronomer, one newsreader Brent Sadler, 34, stars of stars of stage screen and television and 601 birds, there ought to have been 602 birds, but one was inadvertently duplicated. But in any case, it's always nice to receive letters from the cast members have lost even when as here There seems to be an inference that I don't know what I'm talking about. And I have to say that this is not the first time my own or theological credentials have been called into question. It's an accusation that I'm getting used to Sadly, many writers have an avian bent toward throw in the towel if they face this sort of kneeling, day in, day out, but I'm a man of almost saintly forbearance, and I shrug off such pinpricks especially it has to be said when they come for people who spend their time pretending to be members were frankly unbelievable fictional rock and roll band called something like crank shaft and whose guitar strumming is tuneless and vapid. Perhaps I can end the malicious gossip for once and for all by summarizing my ornithological experience. My first paid job after leaving school, it was still called a school in those days rather than a community education hub was as a filing clerk for the pointy town seabird Rescue Service. pointy town is of course, a long, long way from the sea. So during my three exciting years there, only a handful of seabird rescues took place. I remember vividly vividly a guillemots that became entangled in many bright crepe paper ribbons, and was set free by judicious snipping with a pair of embroidery scissors. Incidentally, speaking of guillemots, I certainly know more about them than the writer for The Guardian who seems unaware that they're a type of bird. He wrote a review of a, an album by the band called guillemots, and wondered if it was pronounced gi Mo. Does the Guardian employ anyone over the age of 12 these days? Anyway, as a filing clerk, I became familiar with all sorts of seabirds, not just guillemots, terms, orcs skewers, Kitty wakes, and hundreds of different types of goals came within my purview. Then I'm ashamed to say I fell in with a low crowd and rapidly became a denizen of the underworld. Luckily, this did not put a stop to my own or theological education. As I became involved in a numbers racket. A, you ask, isn't that a non sequitur? Well, it would be of course, except that the numbers in our numbers racket were based on bird populations. Every morning I was bitten to go out and about counting starlings. Rennes linnets and what have you, that's arriving at that day's numbers for the racket.

After a brush with some very tough coppers, I decided to go straight. I applied for a job as personal chef to Peter Maxwell Davis, the eminent composer, thinking that this would provide me with an opportunity to find out all about swans, including how to cook them, but he turned me down in favor of some uppity kitchen person who is Now a famous television personality. I mooched about idly for a while, and then enrolled on a course of bird recognition skills at the van dongle Brack School of bird related studies in 10. Tara beam to meet the tutorial fees and supplement my income, I worked at nights for a company that carried out our investigations, thus extending my knowledge to birds of prey. It was around this time to that I have a number of singular encounters with cassowaries. I pass the van dongle BRAC horse with distinction, umpteen gold stars and a bag with a profile view of a trumpeter Swan in silhouette, and thus secured a position as assistant bird counting person at the newly established hemoglobin towers bird counting Institute, generously funded with a grant from Yoko Ono. One Thursday morning, we learned that the senior bird counting person had been pushed by an unknown malefactor into the path of an out of control pneumatic railway train. So by Thursday afternoon, I was installed in his place and given his talismanic feather and bird bone necklace. Subsequent investigations by the very same tough coppers who had once pummeled me under a spotlight in an underground cellar failed to prove that I was the unknown malefactor. Thank heavens. A couple of weeks later, the gubernatorial board of the Institute recommended that my job title be changed to Uber omnisend bird chieftain the Bleep Scala vulture was added to my talismanic necklace. I was given a personal hand, who's clucks warned me of the approach of unauthorized visitors to my palatial suite of offices at the pinnacle of hemoglobin towers. My binoculars are encrusted with gemstones. Tiny hummingbirds pick grains of wheat from my hand. A boobie nests in my tremendous Buffon. Soon I will become indistinguishable from the ancient Egyptian bird god Horus and thou shalt bow down thou shalt better down before me and thou shalt tremble.

A haggard wisdom, the old man impossibly ancient creaks across the stage, barely able to support himself on his battered crutches, which give off a powerful stench of linseed oil and dubbin. One of his eyes, his doll, even dead, the other gleams with ferocity, the lights dim, and he crumbles to the floor curtain. This is of course, the end of I was puny vercingetorix a play forever associated with the great child method actor Tad Wensleydale. Some still find it hard to credit for the tiny tot of six could be so convincing as the 140 year old antihero. But whatever happened to Tad Wensleydale did he, like so many child actors succumb to booze and pills before taking up an important post in the diplomatic service or the United Nations? Did he attempt to revitalize his acting career later in life? By accepting cameo roles in witless films? Did he get a ghost to write a confessional autobiography freighted with implausible scenes of childhood misery. Tad did none of these things. It's well known that he retired from stage and screen at the age of nine, after his barnstorming appearance as the Demi mundane flapper in the barn in the storm, and award winning drama about an old barn reduced to match wood after being engulfed by a violent storm. As he took his umpteenth curtain call, the diminutive thespian announced that he would never appear in public again, and swept melodramatically off the stage. And indeed, it was as if he had vanished forever more. As days turned to weeks turn to years, with not a jot of news of the mighty stage might so inevitably, that speculative stories begin to circulate. It was said that Tad had become a full time Buzz Aldrin impersonator, in a scheme cooked up by the astronaut himself. A rumor regularly scorched by Aldrin, who socked more than one inquiring busybody on the draw. Another tale had Tad grown mad and bad, filleting his foes with a shave in a dive, a master of disguise with murderous eyes and mustard breath. Some said he'd fallen in with goblins and lived among them as their king in a sort of Goblin pod, now underground, now high in the sky. But this was clearly codswallop. The truth was more prosaic. tabs changed his name to Gussy ditch, opened a pie shop in Pang Hill, and lived out the rest of his days baking and selling Pang Hill pies to the pie eating people of Pang Hill. It wasn't an unremarkable and irreproachable life. But now even a life filled with pies and pie fillings. Tad or Gussy rarely alluded to the meteorite that was those first nine years, an infant actually glory, comparable only to the career of William Betty, the young roseus, whose grave in Highgate Cemetery is now sadly overgrown. Tad Wensleydale his own tomb, on witches solitary chaffinches, always perched is as he wished, a barrack excrescence in questionable taste, in the words of his own last will and testament, a remarkable document, baked in a page baked in pastry letters filled with raspberry jam and lemon curd and put into a pie. two notes on that William Betty 1791 to 1874 the proto Tad of him it was said he is not yet mature but matchless, a British trilogy dealing with feeling and propriety he astonishes the judicious observers of human nature. And Tad Wensleydale appears to have stolen the name, gassy ditch, from a woman who's buried in Kensal green cemetery.

This is a story called The thing. It was blue, it rotated and it smelled of birds. The blue was Sarah Julian. The rotation was slow in January. It was a general sort of bird smell, one could not with any certainty, say, ostrich or guillemots, much as one might wish to. That slow juddery rotation was accompanied by a very faint clanking noise, so faint that a pastor by huffing and puffing up the hill might think he imagined it. As he reached the top, put down his bag and lit his pipe, perplexity farrowing his forehead as he puffed on the savagely bitter cheap Serbian tobacco, the flesh around his piggy eyes crinkling if molds or other burrowing creatures had created a temporary tuck on the hilltop, the passer by might sit on it a while to rest his legs, perhaps take off his big boots and socks, and peck in a dissolve very way at the sock wall before examining his feet with greater diligence. Flesh the color of beancurd little red sores on his toes, but his eyes would be drawn to that surreal alien blue and he would forget his feet. his socks were blue too, but that was just a coincidence. his boots were dappled and done. Like a cows coloring book. Like be in a land where there were cows to be seen, unlike this land. If folk came down and swirled about our pasture by, he would be reluctant to move. With his piggy i'd vision occluded, that clanking noise would seem less faint, as his hearing grew sharper, perhaps too. Once he had tapped out his pipe on a stone, and the last wisps of the accurate Serbian smoke dispersed, he would become aware of the smell of birds, where there were no birds nests. At the bottom of the hill, there is a sordid Tavern where miscreants and ne'er do wells plot act of the utmost fiendish, pneus and cackle as they do so. The taverns walls attempt with GIMP pass mentary it is Shrove Tuesday, so pancakes are being served. Unfortunately, the pancakes have been made with contaminated flour, and in days to come. This scene will be referred to as the mass poisoning horror of CAC, pod, CAC pod being the name of the village, the bottom of the hill, or one of its names for his for it has others in other tongues. This being a country of 10 different languages, some of them spoken by only a smattering of citizens and that smattering in its collective dotage. Are Traveler with his foul pipe tobacco is not in his dotage, and he crashes excitedly through the tavern door having scurried down the hillside the first hint of the fog lifting. There is something in his manner that suggests he is I'm used to the company of ruffians. There is a throbbing in his pituitary gland and beads of sweat upon his brow. He has of course, put back on his socks and boots, and tucked his pipe into the breast pocket of his Austrian Postal Service jacket. Standing at the bar of this repulsive tavern, he asks the landlady for a refreshing minty pottage with foam on top. He is thinking about civilian blue, jhaveri rotation and the smell of birds. And in his frazzled mind, he is swept back to that day, years and years ago, when he danced a Fandango aide who charged with a floozy who will research alien blue frog, and span around like a wild thing as she danced, and though she did not smell of birds, she had something of the look of a crow, bright black eyes, and a core vine nose. And yes, her hat was made of feathers, was it not? The near do wells ignore the new karma for they're too busy gobbling down the poisoned pancakes, which, within hours will find them arriving and groaning in the sawdust of the tavern floor. emboldened by the first few sips of his foamy portation, however, the traveler asks the landlady. I say, What is that thing on top of Yon hill? That blue rotating thing that clanks and smells of birds?

His voice is loud, and resound in the stifling fog of the tavern, and there is a sudden silence. The landlady busies herself, pointedly polishing a tankard with a rag. Every single rapscallion stopped chewing on his pancake. A dog that had been curled asleep at the foot of the pianola gets to its feet and pads slowly out of sight into a dark back room. The clock above the bar stops ticking, a will is still and silent and heavy with menace. Eventually, it seems as if hours have passed, the ancient dog reappears and lies down in the doorway. The sounds of chewing and munching and clinking tankard start up again. The landlady flings her rag onto the floor, and dishes up more plates piled with pancakes. queasily aware that he has said something untoward, the traveler slurps down his pottage and takes his leave edging past the sleeping hound. He does not know that within hours, all the pancake eaters will be dead and gone. But the dog is tormented by nightmares that the tavern will be condemned and falls or ruin. He steps outside the sky is black. He pairs with piggy eyes up to the top of the hill. But the blue rotating thing that smells of birds is engulfed in darkness and no longer visible He turns to trudge towards khakpour railway station. The image of that floozy flickers before him. And now he remembers how she winched him onto a ship from the rock where he had been abandoned for 40 days, and how they danced and danced the Terran Taylor, and how her frock was blue, and how you span and how as midnight struck on my time on the clock, she turned into a crow.

Regular listeners will have gathered the bulk of the prose in hooting yard is the result of many, many hours of painstaking research. A few weeks ago, I read a story called pipistrelle per suivent. For example, and before I wrote that I needed to know a lot more about heraldic bats than I did when I woke up that morning. Indeed, I had much to learn about bats, and even more about heraldry. So to find out about heraldry, one of my sources was a book entitled pimp Lee's Dictionary of heraldry. And I must say that having read it in full, it's the very model of what a dictionary can be. Seldom have I found such a rigorous approach to the act of definition. The definitions in pymble is a clear, succinct and remarkable. Take this as just one example. There you are thumbing through your heraldic dictionary wanting, perhaps even needing to know what is meant by the phrase, Bari bendy, Dexter and sinister. pimply defines it as a combination of Bari and bendy Dexter and sinister. Isn't that perfect? you close the book thump your fist on your escritor And Pharaoh your brow older and wiser than you were but a minute ago. You want to know what Barry bendy Dexter and sinister means? It means a combination of Barry and bendy dextra and sinister.

When I was young, and they packed me off to school, and they taught me how to begin prose pieces with quotations from Jethro Tull songs. I came under the spell of a remarkable docent. He was a shriveled partly collapsed person with hair the color of a gorgeous sunset over the Serengeti. I think he used dye and his bloodless lips were always puckered. He was ill fitting suits woven from the wool of red goats extrude spectacles in favor of some floor mounted light reflecting contraption of many mirrors and lenses. And he never varied in his lunchtime preferences, which were pie related, and frankly unspeakable. Sometimes he sported a mustache. Sometimes, when his duty was to clang bells, he claimed bells with a vigor which belied his frail health. For this dosent was in fact, clinging to life bias straw, had we but known it. He was the finest teacher I ever had. And yet I never understood a word he said, for he had a jarring speech impediment. A fuse in his head had snapped I think, so that somewhere between his brain and his mouth, perfectly sensible words were turned into gibberish. Good Ah, snowed poot Hor Bongo, he might say, or nurnberg gap, pit pit pit pit pit pit Crusher, Tom Tom, for example. Sometimes it was as if he was reciting a list of monsters beings from the works of HP Lovecraft glob glob glob he would matter as a thought nihilo SAP shrug off as an athlete If he entered the classroom with a sickly power, you could almost guarantee that the only sound issue forth would be a low ground, monotonous, goon goon goon goon, huh. It was never entirely clear to me whether the docent realized that when he thought he was saying, Let us now examine in formidable detail the film career of heady Lamarr what his listeners heard was doggone podcast Gobbo Gobbo forlag. In a sense, it doesn't matter. What made him such a superb educator, whether diagrams he would chalk on the blackboard as he jaybird majestic, sweeping concatenations of lines and arcs and shapes and colors, and arrows and letters and numbers, and boxes and circles, and triangles, and cross hatching, and dots and dashes and angles, and planes and squiggles, and Tony Buzan entities. fearsomely complicated, yes at the same time, explaining every last spark of human thought to a roomful of tinies like myself. What a wonder he was. He only taught at the school for a week and then he was gone. It was said by some that he was poached by the Hungarian football club Han Ved where he wielded the magic sponge and taught legendary striker fairing push gas, everything he knew. Others claimed the docent, like Sherlock Holmes devoted his final years to beekeeping. As for me, whenever I look at the Zapruder footage, there seems to be something very, very familiar about umbrella man. And by the way, the quotation from the Jethro Tull song with which that piece opened when I was young, and they packed me off to school, and they taught me.dot.is of course from wind up which appears on aqualung, Words and Music by the noted fish farm proprietor, Ian Anderson.

I thought I'd bring this week show to an end with a couple of quotations from other writers. For the first one, I have my old maca, Max desharnais to thank who sent me this splendid quotation from the history of England and Great Britain by one Professor Michael john. I think there's a late 19th century or very early 20th century, but I think it's late 19th century, where he writes, Charles the second smilingly remarked that it must surely have been his own fault that he did not come back sooner for his own no one who did not protest that he had always longed for his return. One Dobson, a Miller at Charlton in Kent, burnt his windmill as a bonfire for joy. very sensible way of celebrating I think burning or windmill, makes you wonder what Dobson did for a living afterwards. And another quote from spying in guru land by William shore, which is an amusing book about various cults and sects and things in Britain, where he writes about so George King. Sometimes the communications came from a Martian bearing the rank Mars sector six in a tremulous, deep voice, so George would relay these fantastical messages from outer space. He advised against sitting with your back to the engine whilst on train journeys. In his predictions for 1956. He warned of the danger of hurricanes, but added that it was possibly going to be an excellent season for wall. I think that's precisely the kind of information that we would expect from Martians, isn't it? telling us the best way to sit on train journeys, and when wall would be excellent or otherwise? And that's the end of history. Out on the air for this week I do hope you found it educating educative, educative, I think is the word and enjoyable and I'll be back next week. Bye bye
