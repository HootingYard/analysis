Out on the air Welcome to half an hour of exciting new stories brand new prose this week, beginning with a short story very short story called The weird spinny there is something very weird about this spinny but I have a toothache so I'm oblivious to the weirdness. I have come to the spinny at the suggestion of my dentist. She is a so called New dentist, one of the growing band of revolutionary tooth interventionists who've torn up the rulebook. Go home, she said, ushering me out of her waiting room at none to gently boil up a paste of sorghum, goat's milk and raspberry jam, sprinkled with hundreds and 1000s molded into a Brazil nut sized blob and tuck it into a tiny Muslim bag tied at the top with butchered string. Go to the weird spinny and put the bag on the ground near one of the beach or sycamore trees. Then go and conceal yourself behind shrubbery. into time, a squirrel will come to get the bag to add to its winter store. Oh, I forgot to tell you to have your camera with you. Grab a snapshot of the squirrel as it frisks away with your bag of paste. When you have developed the photo. Make it the centerpiece of a shrine in your living room. You may add to the shrine, whatever for students take your fancy, four times a day, prostrate yourself before the squirrel shrine and plead to have your toothache taken away. I have written down on this card the recommended form of words for your pleading. Now Off you go. And with that she propelled me out into the street. Now here I am in the weird spinny and a squirrel has taken away the bag of paste I prepared exactly as my new dentist prescribed. I have taken the photograph. But rather than sprinting home, I'm somehow compelled to stay here squatting in the shrubs. Perhaps that's why it's called the weird spinny because of this overpowering sense that I'm rooted to the spot, unable to leave that somehow great peril is in store Should I try to stride away across the heath to home. I take my portable metal Tapping Machine from my jacket pocket and try to make contact with my dentist. But all I'm able to receive that eerie howling noises like a mighty wind announcing the apocalypse. I'm about to try again. When I noticed that I'm surrounded by squirrels hundreds upon hundreds of them. Savage squirrels with sharpened claws. Ghosts squirrels from an unimaginable past phantoms in a phantom spinny and the aching in my two three doubles on the sun is blotted out of the sky is black.

The sky blotted out under the sun blotted out in the sky black we could do with that now I think we could do that I certainly could unbearable with hate anyway, who is the typical reader or listener of hooting yard? I'm sure you know by now that all the texts that I read here can be found on the hunting yard website@hooting.yard.users.bt open world.com But anyway, I was wondering to myself, who is the typical reader of hunting yard? Anyway, I decided to find out. My initial thought was to do a reader survey and subject the results to careful analysis. But instead I employed a so called consultant a private detective named Zoltan cuspid or What attracted me to Zoltan was that he was cheap. He asked only that I keep him supplied with breakfast cereal and butchers pencils. indefatigable, having had his skull trip and he never needed to sleep. And he was a man of limitless charm. No examples provided. We arranged to meet in a cow strewn fields during a thunderstorm talk for over an hour and later exchange letters, which I'll read out to you, dear Zoltan, I wrote, it was a great pleasure to meet you in a cow strewn fields during a thunderstorm. I'm looking forward to the results of your investigation. I enclosed some vouchers, which you can take to that kiosk near the baking soda factory and exchange for breakfast cereal and butchers pencils. Let me know when you need to replenish your supplies. Dear Frank, he replied, thank you for the vouchers. already. I have made great strides. I am reluctant to divulge my methods, but you should be aware that they are sinister, perilous, hugely complicated, troubling fiendish, unfailingly accurate, and dastardly. Rest assured that not one of your readers will ever suspect that that clever piece of software I took the liberty of installing on your website sends an invisible pneumatic beam shooting out of the screen straight into their brains. I have much material to assess. And in fact, my printer is still chugging out rings upon reams of neuro data. One finding you ought to be aware of is that mind map wizard Tony Buzan is not the typical hooting yard reader. Indeed, he does not appear to be a hooting yard reader at all, an anomaly even I find perplexing, but I'm sure I'll get to the bottom of it. At the beginning of May, Zoltan requested another meeting, this time at an abandoned ice rink. The ice had melted and knots of Bracken unbind weed was spreading over the site. There will be cows here soon observed Zoltan in whose beard I could see Tad's of Special K coco pops and Kellogg's cornflakes. I handed him some more vouchers. I have news he added. I was unreasonably excited by this and began to jump about. The pneumatic brain beam software is clogged, said Zoltan. It's been completely clogged up for the past three weeks, and when it gets clogged, the data becomes contaminated and useless. I knew something was wrong when I tried a test and that typical hooting yard reader profile came out as Ghanaian football hero john pencil. I know for a fact that he's never read a word of the site as he's a confirmed pristine with leanings towards Widdecombe Widdecombe? I asked as you can imagine I was no longer jumping about. I was peering into the distance watching has a few timid cows lumbered towards us just as Zoltan had predicted. And Widdecombe he said also known as Doris Karloff, the combative conservative Member of Parliament and sometime novelist. Her debut the clematis tree was well received, but it's not exactly what we would call a dog sonian Uber text anyway, fair not. I shall unclog that which is clogged and press on with my invaluable work. I just wanted to keep you informed. Oh, and thank you for the vouchers. That was the last time I saw salt and cuspid or a month later, I received another letter.

Unknown Speaker  08:50
Dear Frank, he wrote, something happened when I unclogged the clogging that increased the effectiveness of my program in unexpected ways. That's why I'm able to send you my definitive results. So soon. You do not have just one typical reader, but a family of 18. This group is so homogenous, that I cannot pluck one of them away from the others without bringing the whole house of cards crashing down if you see what I mean. And so to my announcement, the typical hooting yard readers are a family of God fearing republicans from the state of Arkansas. They are Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their children Joshua Jana, john David, Jill Jessa Jingu Joseph Josiah joy Anna Jedediah, Jeremiah, Jason James, Justin Jackson and Joe Hannah. If you visit their website splendidly named www dot jimbob dot info. I think you'll agree that they're wholesome, toothsome and quite quite lovely. In every way, I was a little perturbed that they make no mention of their fanatical devotion to all things hooting yard on their site, until it occurred to me that even the happiest of families has a dark secret gnawing away at their vitals. And for the duggars it is clearly Dobson, Blodgett, fictional athlete, Bob net tivol, the gods of God and all of your other amusing characters. My work is done, but another stack of breakfast cereal and butchers pencil vouchers wouldn't go amiss. And when you have a few spare moments, I do recommend that you visit WWW dot Jim Bob dot info. It's

Unknown Speaker  11:02
very,

Unknown Speaker  11:03
very interesting website and you can see all of the 16 children whose names begin with J. Anyway, this is a story called cake and pastry person. Many many years ago so long ago that you were probably not yet born. There was a cake and pastry person who drove the van around Pang Hill and blister lane, tooting our horn in the summer afternoons, for it seemed the sun was always shining in those far away days. Those were times when children still bought cakes and pastries from a van. A big pantechnicon painted yellow and red and pink and move and black. It was also of course, the time when people worshiped the hideous bad God fatso and walked the earth in fear of his flapping wings and his shrill squeaking that turned up the innards and pierced the soul. Where in other lands, the roads would be lined by milestones, telling the distance to an important town or port. Here there were hundreds and hundreds of huge stone carvings of fatso, the visible reminder of his terrible and terribly haphazard power. Children were protected from the worst of his Roth for fat so the bat God did not fully reveal himself until a person reached adulthood. For tinies, the stone statues were simply part of the landscape, like trees, or kiosks or pneumatic power towers. Although the bat God is forgotten today, everyone remembers the resin hoops that were the favorite placing of young and old alike. I'm sure you know the words to the old song. We skip and frolic and Loop The Loops along Pang hill with our resin hoops. We skip and frolic on blister lane with our resin hoops we loop again. Sometimes children would play at tossing their hoops over a fatso statue, giving the bat God a necklace. Everyone knew that our hoops resin once resting around the stone neck of the God would begin immediately to rot and that by the next morning, nothing would remain but a squelchy foul smelling string of glutinous goo, drippy, dripping onto the ground, where soon vile, prickly poisonous weeds would sprout. These were the roads up and down which the cake and pastry person's van would crumble, slowing to a halt whenever a little crowd of tinies gathered each child clutching a cake and pastry token. In an excited gaggle, the children would exchange their tokens for cakes and pastries, and the cake and pastry person would collect the tokens in his token tin, which rattled when he shook it and shake it he did to hear that pleasing rattle. He beamed at the children as he handed out his cakes and pastries and took their tokens and rattled his token tin. But an acute observer might see that the beam was a fault. Rictus grin for the cake and pastry person was plunged in melancholy. He remembered the innocent times when he too had been able to eat cakes and pastries without a care. Now, like every adult in the land, his days were consumed by a desperate need to locate fat so they're hideous bad God. It seemed that fatso needed more and more tokens every day, and the cake and pastry person was seldom satisfied until his 10 was so crammed with tokens that it no longer rattled. Only then could he sees driving his pan technique on round and round the roads and parked by the perimeter fence of the swan sanctuary and take his 10 on foot along the lane to fat souls cave and wait with all the other supplicants For night to fall and for the bat God's lieutenants to Shema interview.

Unknown Speaker  15:06
When at last his turn came, he would empty the tin into the outstretched paws of a gradient grasping Lieutenant and plead for benediction. But benediction rarely came tomorrow, a bigger tin more tokens. Thus was he commanded in the horrible high pitched squeals of fat toes in human myrmidons one by one, then they would flit away with their booty into the deepest, darkest recesses of the cave, and the cake and pastry person and all the other hunched and sorry believers would traipse away back to their hats and shacks and cabins and tries to snatch a few brief hours of sleep before dawn broke, and they faced a new day with redoubled effort. As they slept, the resin hoops rotted on the statues of their back God. poisonous weeds crept and curled along the ground and in the nurseries on the cover of the night. Tiny children giggled with delight, happy that they had bolstered fat toes power for another day, sure in the knowledge that tomorrow would bring more looping the loop with their resin hoops, more sunshine, and more cakes and pastries from the cake and pastry persons yellow and red and pink and Motovun black cake and pastry van

technical problems as withering in the heat here means that you might not have heard me the full address of hitting our website earlier. It's hooting.yard.users.bt open world.com. Meanwhile, I'm going to read you about Shem ham j fifth and many crumb lop. Those two great modernists, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf well exact contemporaries, both born in 1882 and dying in 1941. their reputations have survived indeed, prospered in the 21st century. The same cannot be said of a third writer who shares those dates of birth and death for now forgotten many krung lop but was many more modern than German Jenny. Some critics think so. Here is tadi as glob chronolock was a mono maniac who struck to a preposterous Lee limited subject matter, but I'm convinced that her name will ring down the ages outlasting Homer Beowulf and the Bible praising deed from the man who dismissed as clots and nincompoops nearly every writer of note from the 17th century onward. glob is certainly correct to refer to crown locks preposterous Lee limited range. In fact, all she ever wrote was stories featuring the sons of Noah. It's true that she placed Shem, Ham and Japheth in an astonishing variety of settings, but no other characters feature in her work, except for occasional appearances by a fictionalized version of Suez Canal visionary Ferdinand de les Epps, 1805 to 1894. If work is unconventional, so to her career, many krumlov only began to write in the last decade of her life on the 14th of January 1931, to be precise. It was on the cold morning of this day that she wrote from beginning to end, the famous story Shem, Ham and Japheth join a knitting circle, which appeared in the inaugural issue of mass bangs popular magazine of catastrophic flood fiction. Kron lop had met the self styled deluge, just authentic mess bang a few months previously, they have a passionate yet enigmatically unconsummated affair. Among the sweet nothings he whispered into her ear was his plan to publish two periodicals devoted to his pet topic, one containing fiction and the other fact. After a stroll among the bougainvilleas and foundings chronolock promised to pen a story based vaguely on Noah's Ark. On her way home, she bought a Bible. She'd never read it before locating the text she needed in Genesis, she tore it out and threw the handsome volume into a waste shoot over the next week. She memorized the story of the flood, and thus began her singular literary career. Mass bangs magazines folded after just one issue each. He swept into mini chronolock parlor to announce their failure, only to find her scribbling away at her second tail. shamans deles EPS go pig hunting. Mess bang, darling I am ruined my periodicals are no more cease writing krumlov Oh, dearest one, I could not stop even if I wanted to, for I feel the Muse inspiring me. I am going to spend the rest of my life writing strange little stories about Noah's three sons. It is my destiny. Mess bang, love of my life. Have you taken leave of your senses. Only I would publish your deranged jottings. And now I'm done. These were authentic mess bangs last words. he flung himself for many crown walks window on the fifth floor of her shabby apartment building and was impaled on an iron spike in the street below. So consumed was crown lop with the vivacity of her tail telling that she did not hear the ungodly siren of the ambulance, which carted her lover to the morgue. She remained at her s Gregoire penciling in a frenzy until her second story was finished. When Knight was drawing in. Mass bang had abandoned the wife now his widow in Dusseldorf or a similar city, who

Unknown Speaker  21:38
took some solace in the fact that his final words were prophetic, for it seemed that no one was interested in publishing many promotes second story, nor the third nor the third, nor the fourth. She had hit her stride now and spent every Thursday writing from dawn till dusk, conjuring new adventures for her heroes. She had plucked the three sons of Noah from that overcrowded arc and was pitching them into new and dazzling adventures. Share them and ham visit the glue factory. Jay Firth is buried alive, and deles, EPS and ham and the mysterious bag of soil what all written before the end of the year chronolock occasionally tried hooking them to publishers without success, but every door slammed in her face seemed to inspire her to new heights of invention. She continued to eke a living by boiling and darling flags, as she had done since her release from prison just before the Great War. Critics today are understandably coy about many Kieron lops life before she became a writer. The received wisdom is that her criminal past has nothing to tell us about her work, that we can separate the murderous psychopath from the storyteller as if they were two distinct chromebox. Indeed, it's difficult to square the gore drenched cutthroat, skulking in the alleyways of Dubrovnik, or somewhere like Dubrovnik, with the pencil wielding genius of the shabby apartment building. We must, I think, be grateful that King Vincenzo announced an amnesty just before the war, cynics say the king expected all those he released to perish on the battlefield, and most of them did, but many crown lots survived, for she spent the war years hiding in a hayloft near an orchard, creeping out at night to eat her fill of pears and gooseberries. And drinking from a spigot by the side of a bomb. Was this hayloft crumb locks Ark, she shared it with a pair of geese and a pair of spokes, or at least that's what she said later, but then she claimed to have named the geese shaman J. Fifth, and the stoats de les Epps, and ham. And this is unlikely given that she was as we have seen Bible ignorant at this point. In her last illness, when her brain was a fuming, hallucinatory miasma. She told all sorts of stories about her time in the high loft. Indeed, she spoke of little ELLs. incoherent babble, it may have been, but clearly this period after the killings and before the stories was of great significance for her. Over the years, there have been attempts to convert the wartime sanctuary into a mini chronolock museum or Memorial Library, but no one has ever been able to identify the actual site. Given that there are literally dozens of hayloft in barns near orchards in the country. Curiously, her writings give no clues. Throughout the canon, there is no mention of any kind of agricultural building. The reader will find plenty of gaudy palaces, space stations, skyscrapers, futuristic pods, Transylvanian cars, Urban dystopias and Victorian drawing rooms in CRAN lops fiction, but no bands or in farmyards nor will one find an arc. Of course, the only story that nods in a seafaring direction is the elegaic a rowing boat and its oars 1936 the first of Chromebooks works to win a prize. She had at long last found a publisher in the form of Dr. Gillespie's pedantic register and the Gazette. Dr. Gillespie was a fictional character who purported to edit and write most of this weekly periodical, which was heavily illustrated with mezzotints by the mezzotint is Rex tent. It was 10 to recommended chronolock to the genuine, non fictional editor, a secretive plutocrat with a piratical eyepatch, who was to become her sole publisher. In the remaining four years of active career, the tails poured out some of them only 50 words long, some close to novellas. It was an age of anxiety as Europe aged once again towards war. Many krung lopped off to sporting an eyepatch in homage to her mentor. She went to visit de les Epps Suez Canal, where she wrote the groundbreaking hams rakish sneer she penned anonymous fan letters to Hollywood actor Claude Rains, her shabby apartment building was given a new lick of paint, or paints, or mold and yellow and a startling civilian blue. She pondered writing a new type of story, one that would feature Neville Chamberlain, but abandoned it after a long and earnest discussion with Rex tent in the dining room of a majestic hotel, with a pair of them ate soup, crackers and potted paste, before running away without paying the bill. She exchanged her collection of pencils for a pen with an unbreakable nib and promptly broke the nib. She was praised in an ESA essay by capisco and large painted her portrayed and kingpin genzo. Some the new king also called Vincenzo presented her with a medal. She wrote a marvelous tragic tear stained tale called j faith is buried alive again. Her hair turned white. And then on the 14th of January 1941 10 years to the day since her writing career began, she was engulfed by a daze a days that could have been mistaken for a coma. Were it not that within her days, she babbled incessantly about the hailer hayloft, and her geese and her stoats and little ELLs, and she never again picked up her broken pen, nor any of the pencils she had retrieved from a rubbish tip. And she babbled away in her days for 40 days and 40 nights, arc time, and then she passed away. And now she is all but forgotten. So you must Mark her name and market Well, many krumlov Finally, this week, If like me, you harbor ambitions to be a sort of 21st century Madame blavatsky figure offering an all embracing synthesis of belief systems to the credulous and wealthy. It's worth keeping an eye on the religion news blog, put religion news blog into Google and you'll find it. After all, in a god eat God world. You can stay one step ahead by clutching every new twitching tendril of faith to your capacious blood that scares bosom as soon as it appears. recent news items alert us to some must have additions to your cult. So for example, ensure that your sect incorporates a blot, a sacrificial meat offering to the ancient Norse gods as practiced by adherents of a Satguru. You might also want to smash statues and tear up baptismal gowns and wedding veils, like the devotees of cresci, endo and grassier, for whom 59 year old Puerto Rican Jose Luis dejesus. Miranda is Christ. Like Jesus of Nazareth, he wears fine suits and diamond encrusted rings drives a seven series BMW and until recently lived in a 5000 square foot Miramar home with Corinthian columns and vaulted ceilings. He also travels with a battalion of guards who wear dark suits and conspicuous earpieces. But the running cost of this security detail is only about $300,000 per annum. So it's completely affordable if you tie the your followers at the appropriate level. That's enough about Gods for this week. More, more about Gods and other things. Squirrels, bats. usual stuff next week. Bye bye
