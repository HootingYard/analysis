Good afternoon This is Rosemount 104 point four FM My name is Frankie and this is hooting out on the air. Regular listeners will know that I've been away for a couple of weeks. I wish I could say that I've been somewhere interesting as tech ruins or the Magic Mountain, or even a chalet on the shingle beach trip pointy town. But alas, I've been a pallid, sickly wreck suffering from risings in the spleen and the AU and black bile and the bloody flux and vapors in the cranial integuments. A times like these, I tend to rely on the regular infusion of Baxter's terrible fluid, or Dr. Gillespie's vital nerve powders. The latter, sprinkled on to a plum or a conference pair can work wonders on even the puny just constitution. And indeed, here I am back behind the microphone on a Wednesday afternoon, bringing the show to you live from the gleaming skyscraper, which houses the resonance FM studio. Yes, I struggled my way through the weird pneumatic doors. I painted for breath as I staggered onto the moving walkway. There was a ringing in my ears as I slumped on the floor of the turbo elevator which shot me to the top of the building in just four seconds. And I needed a bowl of energizing vitamin soup before I could speak. But here I am ready to provide you with half an hour of instructive prose to inspire your Moral Sentiments excuse me a moment while I mop my still fevered brow there. Now, one consequence of lying a bed groaning and whimpering in the throes of neurasthenic horrors, is a disinclination to write. Some might choose to call this writer's block or even idleness, but they know not where have they speak. At least one acquaintance made this accusation in the past fortnight As I tossed and turned in an agony of twitching fit, I became aware of a message on my metal Tapping Machine. Weekly, I reached for it nearly falling from my rumpled palate as I did so. And when I read the message I was convulsed a new as if 100 demons with 100 forks were pricking me 100 times. For crying out loud key, I read through my tears, Scott beings that are milk toast winter, there's nothing wrong with you that a brisk walk around a duck pond in a hailstorm won't fix, put on your boots and seize the day. I tossed my metal Tapping Machine onto the floor among the piles of rags and sobbed some hours later, when I'd stopped sobbing. I did indeed clamor for my sick bed, put on my boots, and I launched myself towards the duck pond. I got as far as the garden gate before collapsing in a mewling heap. I shuddered and shook, twitching and shattered and hideous vision swam in my brain. I knew there were visions, because there are no giant golden poisonous toads in this neck of the woods. But still, even though I sensed they were the product of my fuming brain. They were frightening enough, particularly the one called Graham, which had more eyes than you normally see on a toad, even a giant golden poisonous one. And each eye was quivering on the end of a stalk, which again is untold, like, as far as I know, not that I've ever made a study of the world's toads, though it's on my list of things to do. Anyway, there I was cutting the opposite of a dash. When the post he bashed his way through the garden gate, clunking me on the head. That hallucinatory toads vanished, and I sat up on the gravel rubbing the lump that was already swelling where I had been clunked. Oh, sorry, I clumped you on the head, said the posty. Here I have a letter for you. Even in the most trying of circumstances, I tried to be polite. So as I took the envelope from the post, he I thanked him. He recoiled from me as if I had scraped some blasphemous Execration. As indeed I had, for the clock on my head had dislodged some of the nerve wirings in my brain, and for the next three days, whenever I spoke, whatever I tried to say, I spewed forth a tirade of foulness. Luckily, a cure was affected before I had to do this show. Otherwise, resonance would be shut down by the authorities for broadcasting disgusting language in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon, when innocent and sensitive ears would be appalled, and rightly so. I was able to treat the dislodged brain wiring by myself.

Frank Key  08:00
For though I have neglected to learn about the toads of the world. I do know a thing or two about the magnificent complexity of the human brain. I had a good teacher. years ago, I attended a two day course at the blockman Institute, where I learned among other things, that if you immerse your head in a bucket of warm soapy water, and do the cold pepper maneuvers until at the point of drowning, most of your brain problems will be solved. It certainly works for me. Now, where was I? I took the letter from the posty and crawled back into the house somehow managing to hoist myself into a chair at the kitchen table. I did not like the look of the handwriting on the envelope. It spoke to me of theft, spasms and cruelty. It spoke of moral turpitude. It spoke of rubber truncheons and contempt. You might ask how I could read so much into the few scribbled lines of my name and address, but I'm not going to tell you. Instead, I'm going to soak while we have a short interval.

Frank Key  09:26
That's better. I'll get back to how I overcame what might have been writer's block or might have been something far more lethal. Something almost too awful to contemplate in a moment. But I want to mention that in between recovering from my numerous scenic terrorism coming in to do today's show, I went to see the film Snakes on a Plane. Most of the critics have with the customary laziness made a big deal of Samuel L. Jackson's line. I'm sick and tired of these beeping snakes on this beeping plane but for There was a much better moment in the screenplay. One of the stewardesses enters the cockpit where the copilot is trying to control the plane. The captain's already been bitten by a poisonous snake. She says, What would the oxygen mask deploying? Now, put yourself in the scene? You are that stewardess? You're wondering why all the oxygen masks have been released for no apparent purpose. So you go to the cockpit to find out. Come on. Now. Think yourself into the situation? What do you say? What words come out of your mouth? What's with the oxygen masks, you might say? Or add a push? What's with the oxygen mask deployment? But what's with the oxygen mask deploying? I think not a great moment in a foolish but amusing film. While we're on the subject of cinema, I've recently become obsessed with the man who does the voiceovers for all Hollywood comedies and romances. You know, the one

Unknown Speaker  11:03
failure to launch. It's the movie everyone's talking about Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn. My super ex girlfriend. You'll laugh until you cry. Sandra Bullock is amazing.

Frank Key  11:21
You know the voice. I was thinking that he ought to be used for a wider range of films.

Unknown Speaker  11:27
Krzysztof kieslowski his masterpiece, a short film about killing. Everyone's talking about Peter Greenaway his new movie, the tough loopers suitcases. Your just love intolerance by veteran dw Griffith

Frank Key  11:48
Hmm, time for another break.

Frank Key  12:18
So anyway, I sat at my table glaring at this envelope with its repellant handwriting. I plucked a plum from my plum bowl, sprinkled it with Dr. Gillespie's vital nerve powders took a bite and glared at the envelopes and more. I turned it over to see if there was a return address and there was but it was badly smudged and illegible. I cursed the posty I flap my arms as if I were a bird, a big legendry bird like a rock. I pulled a piece of straw out of my hair. I pondered the implications of that anonymous 18th century suicide note which read in its entirety, all this buttoning and unbuttoning. I couldn't remember if there was an exclamation mark appended to it. So I taught it to my feet and headed for the bookshelves. Were on Nestle the dictionary of quotations. I never made it across the room, because as I took a few unsteady steps, I was confronted by a phantom. It may have been a ghoul, but I think it was a phantom. It was great and the ethereal and shimmering and damp and cold and mournful and it was clutching and it's slender, bloodless hand, the key to a hotel room. through some kind of ghostly thought transference. It told me that the hotel it belong to was far away in Winnipeg, and that I must go there immediately. I tried a bit of thought transference myself to explain that my passport had expired, and that I was too sick to go to Winnipeg In any case, but I made a batch of it and transferred my thoughts not to the Phantom, but to a carpet beetle near the skirting board, which was so traumatized by being suddenly zapped with alien thought processes, that it had a heart attack and perished. Flipping onto its back and wiggling its many, many little legs hopelessly in the air. Can carpet beetles have heart attacks? Or did I miss read the signs? Who knows? Apart from entomologists? What I do know is that the carpet beetle was dead, and the Phantom was still looming there, reproachful and anguished. It was by the way, a duck Phantom, a Rotterdam Phantom, one of the phantoms of Rotterdam. What was it doing in my house? Why was it imploring me to go to a hotel in Winnipeg? what awaited me in the hotel room. I tried to remove a sliver of Plum peel that was caught in my teeth without success. The router I'm Phantom shifted suddenly spine tingling Lee. Now it was behind me. I span around. The Phantom was dissolving slowly, but it had left the Winnipeg hotel key on the mantelpiece. I opened a window. From my neighbor's house, I could hear the strains of 20 great TV themes by the Dennis drivel, accordion and pan pipe orchestra. I realized it was the limited edition version, including the theme from it shouldn't happen to Yvette. My head cleared, everything seemed to fall into place. I had been sick, but now I was well, I flapped my arms again, like wings, but not like the wings of a legendary bird like a rock. I flap my arms as if they were Angel's wings, and I was being born to heaven. And I took the dead carpet beetle with me for why should insect not share in the rapture of paradise?

Frank Key  16:27
Here's a different story. The pigs needed feeding so Constance took a big crate full of apples and trudged out in the morning drizzle. The apples were pippins and mostly rotten, but she knew that the pigs would guzzle them down. over by the aircraft hangar, a floppy eared bunny rabbit was hopping about among a pile of abandoned pots and pans. Constance worried about rust, but not today. She took the apples into the pigsty put the empty crate onto a pile of other empty crates and headed off towards the orchard. As dawn was breaking. Constance had an asik nation in the orchard. The following day before her acid nation, Constance not only fed the pigs with a crate full of overripe plums, but she gathered up all the pots and pans strewn around the door of the aircraft hangar and D rusted them with a D rusting solution of her own devising the floppier the bunny rabbit was nowhere to be seen, but she saw an Arctic hair on the horizon. Then she trotted off excitedly to the orchard. On the Thursday, she was late getting to the orchard for her assignation because one of the pigs had contracted a lethal pig disease, and she ran across the muddy fields to call a local veterinarian. I'm going to start that sentence again. On the Thursday, she was late getting to the orchard for her acid nation because one of the pigs had contracted a lethal pig disease. And she ran across the muddy fields to call the local veterinary surgeon and mutton chopped old fool with watery eyes. He was still a bed and Constance knocked and knocked on his door to rouse him. When he eventually came down in his dressing gown, not quite awake and unlatched his door the following dialogue took place. Constance that vet I have a sick pig. veterinary surgeon. Let me get dressed and put all the necessaries in my bag and I will come with you. Constance, hurry, hurry vet the pig may die. veterinary surgeon, I will do my utmost to save your pig. Because Constance had run across the fields to call a veterinary surgeon, she was late for her acid donation in the orchard. When she got there. At last. She found a note fasteners to a withered old punkten tree. She read only half of it before Hots tears welled up and she fled from the orchard sobbing and bereft. Back at the pigsty, the watery eyed veterinary surgeon was packing up his bag. Constance blundered through the gate frost and weeping and wild died. veterinary surgeon, I have cured your pig, Miss Constance. All will be well

Frank Key  20:24
Here's something I've read before, but I'm gonna read it again because it's one of the. For some reason, a number of listeners are very fond of this piece. The annual picnic for detectives event has become one of the key dates in the hooting art calendar, which is somewhat surprising given it in glorious beginnings. The very first picnic for detectives was hardly a picnic at all. And the official historian of the event estimates that only a handful of those taking part were bona fide are detectives. And we know for certain is that a small group of people, no more than four or five, pitched up in a field with a couple of hampers and spent an afternoon there. meteorological records show the day was one of Arctic schools, but the field was in a temperate zone inland. In fact, it was just across the road from Pang Hill orphanage. This anomaly has fascinated whether fixated picnic for detectives buffs who are legion so not only do we have just a few people with a couple of hampers, we do not even know what was in those hampers. If you're familiar with ordinary picnics, you would expect to open up a hamper to find sandwiches, savory flans, some fruit crackers, cheese related foodstuffs, cake and bottles of refreshing barley water, hard boiled eggs would be likely to unless the film director Alfred Hitchcock was one of the picnickers fat as we know from the many biographies, he was terrified of eggs. Hitchcock was not present at the picnic across the road from the Pang Hill orphanage, that is counted now as the first picnic for detectives. But unfortunately, we do not know the names of those who were. In fact, the whole thing is shrouded in mystery. All we can say for certain is that the following year, in the very same field, there was a second picnic and this one was attended only by detectives, either by chance or design. This second picnic was blessed with what the record called humid, voluminous and scattered dappling sunlight. examination of surviving crumbs from the site indicates that all sorts of pies were eaten with or without cutlery. I for one hope they did use cutlery or at least forks wrote Sidney Kak, for there is something disconcerting and undignified in the mental image of a team of tip doc detectives sprawled in a field shoveling pie into their mouths with their fingers. It seems those resounding word picnic for detectives were first used a year later. The third picnic is the one that became legendary. Over 40 detectives gathered in the field and their hampers were each emblazoned with a badge a heraldic device, a coat of arms, an emblem, each one caked in mud as a safeguard. The picnic menu was written down for the first time and to this day, it is recited at the crack of every dorm by the urchins in the Pang Hill orphanage. It was a this third picnic detector for detectives that a pack of beagles was employed to frighten off swooping crows, magpies girls and other scavenging creatures with beaks and wings. Nowadays, the beagles in the pack have bred specially in the detectives Beagle breeding compound, their psychological state carefully monitored while they're still puppies. One innovation that the third picnic for detectives which did not survive was musical accompaniment. The experimental percussionist Zoltan taplow, was invited along despite having no background in police work. He was stationed in a corner of the field and asked to play suitable picnic music is energetic thumping upon reconditioned metal drums and shamanic gongs was drowned out that day by howling winds and the steady convoy of cement mix of trucks, grayling along the road. There is one body of opinion which suggests that taplow was merely a figment of the overheated imagination of one of the detectives. A tall stooping forensics specialist who'd spent too much of his career aboard ships. The absence of taplow from nearly all A to Zed died directories of experimental percussionists tend to support this view. The music real or imagined was inaudible

but the picnic itself was a triumph. It is the subject of two novels a stage play a long running television cereal, an opera and no less than three films, the finest of which is probably picnic for detectives three, the title of which was changed to hot picnic for detectives impact by the distributors concerned that cinema goers would be confused into assuming they'd missed two earlier features. Detective Captain shatavari, who was given a sabbatical from the force to produce and direct the film disowned it, but he need not have done for it's a towering work. It may be that his critical faculties deserted him when immediately after completing the film, it was badly injured when attacked by

Unknown Speaker  25:57
a swarm.

Frank Key  25:58
It is certainly true that his nerves never recovered, and he spent what ought to have been the prime of his career chewing toffee in the hot house of a nursing home, surrounded by gigantic and abominable plants. By the time shutter is film came out. The third picnic for detectives was lost in the past, a sepia tinge to memory of tweed suits, massive walrus mustaches, essence of violence organdy ruffles reticules and Gladstone bags from the fourth year onwards with the introduction of lobsters on the menu picnic for detectives took on it startling kaelin recall significance, who today can imagine a year in hooting yard without it. Remarkably little has changed over the years. Still, there is the ceremonial March past have retired detectives on picnic for detectives Eve, whether wheelchairs of the infirm agents are pushed along by teams of tots from Pang Hill orphanage. Still the lobster pots are made of beaten bronze in a factory far away. Still, the field is laced with buttercups and dandelions and spurge allowed to spread. Still, anxious eyes are cast up to the skies in the morning. The weather discussed in almost insane detail by all who linger on the Pang Hill pathways. Still hampers bear badges which glisten under their caking of mud. And still there are detectives. And still there is a picnic for them in hooting yard. But once a year come hell or high water come rain or shine.

Frank Key  28:10
I don't know if you've noticed the very interesting little segues from one piece to another this week. plums plums have turned up more than once as have bags. And it's bags that we're going to move to here.

Frank Key  28:30
The Old Testament book of Haggai that's a brief text. It's a favorite of mine. It mentioned pottage Of course, which is always a good thing. But it also includes the phrase, he that earned wages. Sorry, he that earned wages, Earth wages to put it into a bag with holes. That had guy chapter one, verse six. He that Earth wages, Earth wages to put it into a bag with holes. I've always felt a pang of sympathy for that man, whoever he may have been. He's the only person in the Bible who carries a bag with holes a bag so unlike the ones mentioned in Luke 1233 bags which wax not old, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupters. Clearly the hag guy man has allowed moths to corrupt his bag, and that's why it has holes in it. I can't help wondering if he's a little simple. This man to be putting his wages into a moth eaten bag is a prototype of the holy, innocent or the holy fool. Perhaps that mythic figure which had such resonance in Czarist Russia, among other times and places. Rasputin certainly exploited the idea for all it was worth and although there is no reliable account of him roaming the corridors of the Winter Palace, carry A bag with holes I like to think he did. At the end. Of course, his assassins had such trouble doing him to death that they shot him at least three times. So it's possible any bag he had with him at the time would have had a hole or holes caused by gunfire, even if it had escaped corruption by moths. To my knowledge, no one has yet pursued a close study of moth infestations in the czarist palaces. But if someone with the requisite scholarly background were to do so, we may learn something of importance. I'm not sure whether the moths lying in wait to feed on Rasputin his bag would have been all the moths or antler, or Terminal B Black Mountain black v. Black veined broom, cabbage, Crimson speckled, Cynthia December. Do you drink a ear early Emperor fishes estuarine Fox garden pebble ghost goat great peacock Gypsy heart, Hornet, leopard lobster, Mark Mele mouse, Maslin NetID mountain, near me northern winter, November aurash, orange, pale November, peppered Perce, Spanish moon, swallow tailed sweet Gale, turn it wax, white satin, or winter moths. And I would like a top lepidopterist with some knowledge of the fall of the Romanovs to tell me listeners should know that the bag of deceitful weights is not mentioned in hag guy but can be found in my car. Chapter Six verse 11. It would not surprise me to learn that Raspbian had such a bag to give him that he was a deceitful monk as well as the Mad Monk of legend. his bag of deceitful weights and bag with holes may have been one on the same, of course, a possibility which makes the brain real. This is the kind of historical conundrum that Dobson ought to have written a pamphlet about, but never did. If he had, we might be a little further away from bag quandary, and a little closer to a bag truth. Bag truth sounds like a Yoko Ono escapade. So the still small voice of common sense whispers in my ear. Be silent now.

Frank Key  32:28
Be silent.

Unknown Speaker  32:31
Bye bye
